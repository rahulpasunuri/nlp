Very very good. Only suggestion is to cook the onion mixture for 20-25 minutes instead of 5. Also its very spicy using a tsp of hot pepper flakes. If you don't like it that hot reduce to 1/2 tsp. I also added the mango as they were in season.

I rarely give a review, but this chutney is very unique. There is a generous flavor profile of sweet,salty, sour and spicy. The ingredients lend themselves to a multitude of adjustments to fit the individuals palate.This is filled with, as the Japanese say, umami!

I have made other pear chutneys but roasting the pears really adds a unique and truly delicious note. This is dreamy. I served as part of a cheese course with some flavorful cheeses, and it was a knock-out. I minorly changed things based on what I didn't have in the pantry: I used yellow onions for red. I used brown sugar plus real maple extract for the maple syrup, and white balsamic vinegar for the white wine vinegar. I also cooked the onions first, added the zest from the lemon I squeezed, and added the extra juice + spices from tossing the pears to the onion mixture. I made a triple batch and canned it in half-pint jars to use for gifts. Yum!

I just made this last night for my niece to give away as part of Xmas Hampers Not being a lover of Chutney my view doesn't count BUT the look on my sisters face after she tried it- Can one have an orgasm over food? I thought she was going to have one right there in the club! My only valued comment would be I DOUBLED up on all EXCEPT I stayed with original amount for dried chilli peppers & I used 1 tspn dried thyme & being that in Sydney we are in Mango season i added one full diced mango I also added 2 Tblspn BROWN SUGAR to the syrup mixture as I did not feel it was sweet enough Just tried it after being left in fridge overnight YES IT IS EXCELLENT

As others have stated, this is a wonderful recipe as written. I used dried mangos and rehydrated them for about 1 hour and diced. Really gives a beautiful color so I would add. Make it just as written. My chutney definately thickened as it cooled but I did drain about 1/4 cup of liquid off after cooking the fruit. Will make for Thanksgiving!

Really fabulous! Followed the recipe very closely-- did not lessen the cinnamon. Substituted dried tart cherries for the currents and did not add the mango. I'm going to try this again at the holidays and give it as gifts. Yum!

May last asian pear tree (the latest of 5 varieties) is just overloaded and I had to do something, and we love chutney. I made 10x the amount called for and hot packed 12 pints for down the road. This still left about 2 pints for immediate consumption. I followed the directions except backed down from a full 10x cinnamon and couldn't find currents so used dried tart cherries. The sauce didn't thicken up much after letting it sleep in the frig. but the flavor was still fantastic and had just enough after-kick to remind me I added the pepper flakes. I didn't want to boil it down to thicken it up as some suggested, because the additional hot packing might have turned it to mush, and I like a firm fruit chutney. Part of the excess chutney was generously lavished into two long butterflied pork tenderloins which we then laid in teriyaki sauce for 30 min. before hitting a med. hot mesquite BBQ grill for 30 min. Man-oh-man life is good, and the left over lunches were better.

Yumm! I used fresh pitted Bing cherries and chopped dried mango slices to keep down the juices. Then processed jars in a hot water bath to give to my greedy mouthed friends. Fantastic!

This chutney is so good on so many things--I recently made this to go with the pancetta crisps and pear appetizer on this site.(in place of the pear) I put the pancetta in muffin cups and baked, put goat cheese in the cups and topped with a small dollop of the chutney---AWESOME. Easy bite sized appetizer. Didn't use mangos last time b/c none were ripe, but am going to this time. I am sure it will be wonderful!

i had two beautiful pears that needed to be used immediately, and this recipe was perfect! it was my first time making chutney and it was amazing. the sweetness was balanced out by the tartness from the lemon juice and white wine vinegar, with a slight heat from the pepper flakes. the textures were also pleasing. served alongside a brined pork roast from bobby flay, it was an absolute crowd pleaser!

CRAZY GOOD!!!

I found a forgotten jar of this lurking in my cupboard where it had been sitting (processed) since December, it was spectacular. I followed the recipe exactly, and will do so again.

I love this recipe, but I reduced the mixture for about 45 minutes to cook off most of the liquid, tastes great though and I will definitely make this again.

Yummy! Made this spur of the moment as an accompaniment to the pork crown roast with apples also on this site. Didn't use the mangoes but will try them next time. Delicious! And so good on a turkey sandwich, too!

I agree with Z from Irvine - this was delicious as is but my tastebuds would prefer more pears- double at least. (After all, it is called Roasted Pear Chutney). Substituted the white wine vinegar with 1/2 apple cider vinegar & 1/2 sherry. Used the mango, cannot even imagine this without it.

I didn't have white wine vinegar on hand so I subbed in apple cider vinegar and it worked really well. Yes, a little too much liquid though.

Rating: 3
I thought it was quite good but it seemed to have more liquid than other chutneys. I followed others advice and cooked it for 45 min. and kept the lid on the pot 1/2 the time-- maybe I should have cooked it uncovered for the entire time. I will try it again. I also used bartlett pears which may have been juicier.

This chutney is delicious. A client had sent me a box of pears for the holidays and they got ripe before I could eat them so I looked for something to make and tried this. I doubled the receipe. The combination of sweet and hot is very nice. I didn't have a mango to add so next time would like to try that, I bet it will be even better.

Used Asian pears, substituted dried bing cherries for the currants, and (unfortunately) couldn't find a mango that wasn't rock-hard, otherwise made as directed. Absolutely spectacular; will definitely make again.

If you like chutneys, you'll probably enjoy this one using pears. I made it as specified in recipe. Next time, I personally would increase the pear to onion ratio and reduce the vinegar by a third.

Absolutely delicious. Easy to make in advance. I followed other reviewer's advice and included the mango and also found it took about 40-45 minutes to reduce.

Making this for the third time! I use it on my chicken curry dish and now sadly cannot live without it! Have not tried it with the mango, but I just might this time!

This chutney was unbelievable good. Even my sons enjoyed it with the Maple-Brined Pork Chops. The mango is a must!

I'm making this tonight. Did everyone use the mango? and, did you cook it with the syrup etc? Thanks for the help.

Wow. This chutney is excellent. I made it almost exactly as written, except that I used Bartlett pears and 2 small forelle pears that I had left over from other pear recipes. Fabulous and full of flavor. TRY IT!

I've made this chutney several times now and everytime I make it, everyone raves about for weeks. The flavor has amazing depth and even impresses the most selective and refined tastes

I doubled up on the pears, and roasted what seemed like forever! (At least 1 hour), It thickend nicely after 3 days in fridge, great with grilled pork chops.

Rating: 3
I agree on the liquid content; more reducing required before the pears are added. The maple is an interesting flavour addition. My tree is a Bartlett and these pears substituted very well. I had a little difficulty getting them to carmelize so they ended up under the broiler for a few moments.

Excellent with the Grilled Maple-Brined Pork Chops (also from this site). I used the leftover chutney from that meal with grilled chicken breasts a couple of days later, and it was wonderful. I couldn't get bosc pears at my grocery store, though, and substituted Asian pears, which worked beautifully.

Roasting the pears really gave them a nice flavor. I didn't add the hot pepper flakes, however, as I was serving it with a spicy main dish.

I substitited dark raisins, for golden, and balsamic for white wine vinegar (availability).. Warning: the recipe requires additional time to reduce the liquid or else it will come out runny..I cooked it down an additional 45 minutes until I got it to the consistency I wanted.. Great with Lamb, smoked Pork or Beef!
