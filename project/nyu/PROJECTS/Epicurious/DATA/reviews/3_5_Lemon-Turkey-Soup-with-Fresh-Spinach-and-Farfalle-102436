Pretty good when made with with a rich, homemade turkey stock. I was sorry that I added all the lemon as it was a little overwhelming. Next time I'll start with less and taste my way up to the right level.

I love, love, love this soup. I put 1 cup of pasta and double down on the lemon. It's the best way to give the end of the Thanksgiving turkey a good home.

Delicious soup! I added a tablespoon of chicken soup base, a teaspoon of dried oregano, and used mini-farfalle instead of full-sized pasta, but otherwise made the recipe as written. Hearty but not decadent like my favorite post-Thanksgiving, cream-based turkey and wild rice soup. I will definitely try this in the future with a deli roaster and kale. http://lindseysluscious.blogspot.com

I bought a 2 1/2 lb. bone-in turkey breast and made my own stock by simmering it for an hour with 9 cups water, 1 t. salt, a few peppercorns, and celery, onion, and carrot. This resulted in a generous amount of leftover turkey for sandwiches or whatever in addition to the 2 c. used in this recipe. I then strained the vegetables out and made the rest of the soup mostly as directed, but instead of the farfalle I used about 1 c. orzo. I think the reason some reviewers felt this was tasteless is that the recipe calls for no added salt during cooking, so in addition to the salt I used in the broth, I added 1/2 t. of ground sea salt and 1/4 t. freshly ground pepper when sauteeing the carrots/celery/onion. It is also important to sautee the vegetables at a high temperature, stirring constantly to avoid burning them, to develop a nice rich flavor before adding the broth. The entire family, including teens, loved this soup. A keeper for sure.

This is the only turkey soup I have made since I found this two years ago. It is wonderful. I usually use orzo pasta because that's what I had on hand the first time I made it and now our family knows it as the lemon turkey soup with orzo pasta. I prefer smaller pasta so it works for us. I don't measure the lemon as I love it and just put it in to taste. I also make the broth by boiling the turkey carcass. A really terrific soup on a cold night.

This was so easy to make and very delicious. I omitted the garlic only because I rarely like it in soups. I will make this one again.

This recipe is fantastic. I add a pinch of thyme to the veggies while sauteing. I use about 10 cups broth. And because I love it lemony... all the lemon zest from one med-large lemon and about 3 Tbsp lemon juice. This freezes well. My husbands rates this as one of the best soups he has eaten.

I use this recipe frequently, once with turkey left overs and now many times with chicken. My family loves this and its reasonably healthy. I chop all veggies (not together) in a processor. I use 1 fresh lemon ( grated and squeezed) so the flavor is better than that of store bought.. I have never had a problem with a lack of flavor. As I've made this many times, I do use 1/2 the pasta and add 1C of broth; I don't like it too thick. I also heat soup as directed then place spinach in the bowl (not the pot) before adding soup. It wilts perfectly and leaves remaining soup without over-done spinach. This way left overs are still great. Despite adding extra broth this soup has always had great flavor, don't know what the previous reviewer didn't do. but you cant please everyone...

I was very disappointed with this soup. It really had zero flavor. I realize that other reviewers added various seasonings and were happy with the result but I think I should be able to use the recipe as written. Otherwise, it's a different recipe.

I used turkey broth that I had made from the turkey carcass, skimmed the fat after cooling, and that made a wonderfully fragrant base. I also used whole wheat spaghetti broken into small pieces insead of bowtie pasta. Added thyme and marjoram for increased flavor.

Rating: 4
In my version, I did the following: While sauteeing the vegetables, I added cumin, a little cinnamon (a little secret from my Greek X), rosemary, a bunch of fresh thyme and parsley... then, after adding the stock (made fresh from the thanksgiving turkey), I also added what was left of the white wine turkey gravy. Then at the end, when I added the shredded turkey meat, I included the juice and zest from an entire lemon. I also used very high quality mini farfalle. Beautiful and EXCELLENT! This will be an annual tradition. And I will also make this the next time I roast a chicken.

I used the suggested modifications when I made this soup the first time: added bayleaf, cumin, rosemary, and thyme. I also used 5 cups of turkey stock (after Thanksgiving) plus 3 cups of water rather than 8 c of chicken stock. This was a delightful recipe. The second time I made this, I was out of leftover turkey. So, rather than than the pasta I used a potato and a parsnip, added with the vegetables at the beginning. At the point it called for turkey, I added cubed tofu instead. Another terrific recipe.

One of the few times the Epicurious reviews have let me down! This soup was bland, boring and a waste of time and ingredients. Seriously: a can of Progresso is more interesting. I used the reviewer recommendations, and added extra lemon juice and cumin.

Very good! I don't like to rate w/ forks recipes that I altered, but this was great. Didn't have turkey or chicken, so I added some chickpeas at same time as broth (to pick up flavors), and had kale on hand instead of spinach. Was exactly what I hoped for - lovely bright flavor with a little touch of thickness in the broth thanks to the pasta, and a substantial soup. Absolutely a keeper.

Great flavor and a wonderful way to use leftover turkey - not your standard day-after-holiday turkey soup! We also used this recipe to use leftover roasted chicken. It really could be used any cool time of the year.

I made this with turkey stock (of course...post-Thanksgiving), but it was still pretty blah. The second time around, I simmered it with a rosemary stem or two, added cumin and extra lemon juice, used leftover rice instead of pasta, and added a few leeks with the carrots. It's a good dinner soup with some thick toasted sourdough bread.

Used the recipe for turkey stock in turkey watercress soup recipe on this site. This was light and delicious after a heavy Thanksgiving meal. Great way to use left over turkey. I also added a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes.

I make this all the time with a rotisserie chicken. I pressure cook my own stock while I prepare the veggies. This way I have extra stock for the very few leftovers. I juice and grate a whole lemon, buy unpackaged spinach. I is a colorful, delicious soup.

I liked this a lot in theory but have tweaked it as follows. I substituted store-bought rotisserie chicken for the turkey. I omitted the red pepper. I added two bay leaves to the onions, garlic, celery, and carrots. I deglazed the pan with a cup or two of dry, white wine before adding the chicken broth. I added one 15 oz. can diced tomatoes and a large sprig of fresh thyme with the chicken broth. Other than that I left it alone except for garnishing with a very small drizzle of olive oil and always using parmigiano reggiano. Keep plenty of extra broth on hand for thinning; the pasta absorbs a lot. This is a fantastic alternative to traditional chicken noodle soup. Delicious.

I have never written a review before, but wanted to note my slightly different take on this soup. I used chicken instead of turkey and doubled the amount of lemon juice, like many others. I added two handfuls of grape tomatoes and some chopped fresh rosemary with the spinach. As a finishing touch, I sprinkled crumbled feta cheese on top of each bowl instead of the parmesan. Delicious!

Rating: 4
Really, really good. Added twice the lemon juice and a dash of cumin, as recommended by others. Didn't need the cheese. Doesn't keep super well, so we cut in half and it serves two quite well with a dinner salad. Served with Pinot Grigio.

My family and I love this soup. Great way to use leftover turkey or chicken and to get the little ones to eat veggies. I try to use all the pasta during the initial serving so leftovers won't get too mushy but find it so easy to add in rice or other pasta the next day. Yummy on a cold night.

Really liked the addition of lemon to brighten the flavors. Will try this many times, substituting various vegetables - whatever I have in the fridge.

This is a great soup base to add and create any type of flavor. I didn't have farfalle or red bell pepper. So I added basil and arborio. More lemon as suggested, GREAT!

We just made this soup with our leftover turkey (organic free range of course). Used organic whole grain pasta and cooked it in soup but used less than the recipe called for. We loved the lemon flavor and used 4T. As mentioned by other reviewers, cumin makes a good soup great in this case. This soup will be our new post-Turkey day tradition.

Rating: 3
This is a very interesting soup with great qualities...light, yet full bodied at the same time; very colorful, white with strong greens and reds. I added more spinach because I love it, along with lemon. I cooked the pasta in the soup which will give you that chuncky style soup. If your preference is a lighter soup cook the pasta seperately. I needed about 4 extra cans of broth as it really did thicken up from cooking the pasta in the soup. Lastly, I do think this soup will only be as good as the turkey you add to it. I made a small turkey that turned out great and used the best of the white meat. The lemon flavor was a great surprise, however, be careful to taste it as you go, in this recipe the lemon flavor is easy to over due, everything in balance! I would make this again.

I really liked this soup. One reviewer was absolutely right about the cumin, it really takes this soup up a notch in flavor. I also just used plain old fashioned egg noodles (cooked separately) instead of the pasta. The leftovers are even better!

Making this soup was the perfect way to use leftover turkey after Thanksgiving. The recipe was easy, quick, and quite tasty. The lemon juice added a nice spin. The end result was a combination of a "traditional chicken soup" with that of a "greek chicken soup." I will make this again without a doubt!

Agree with another reviewer that this is a great way to utilize Thanksgiving leftovers. I made stock from the turkey, then used turkey leftovers for the soup itself. Delicious! This one's good for the whole family too, my toddler daughter enjoyed it as much as my wife.

Lovely to look at and tastes so fresh you would never guess it was made with leftovers! Made a couple of alterations: added some freshy thyme and ground white pepper, and did tomatoes instead of red pepper. I added two tablespoons of butter at the end which really smoothed out the flavors. I also used homemade stock from the turkey carcass, and cooked the pasta prior to adding it to the soup so it wouldn't soak up the broth. Excellent with a crusty baguette!

The antithesis of Thanksgiving: bright, refreshing, healthy. I felt it was missing a layer of flavor, and added 1 T. cumin; this added nice complexity and cut the lemon flavor a bit. Will make each year with leftover turkey.

My husband and I just loved this soup! It's a nice change from the traditional turkey soup made with Thanksgiving leftovers. I made my own stock and used 3/4 cup of barley instead of the pasta. The lemon, red bell pepper and spinach really make this soup fresh and interesting. Don't forget the fresh Parmesan... Yummy!

Prepared this recipe with pre-formed frozen turkey burgers, and orzo in place of farfalle. Delicious soup made from "spare" ingredients from the vegetable bin, and pantry. Would work with various combinations of veggies, and pasta. Used zest from 1 large lemon, and lemon juice to taste. Quick and easy recipe.

Rating: 3
Easy, simple, nutrious fare, great for a bone-cold night. The lemon makes it taste like "spring" food to me though. Used only a cup of pasta -- but used the tiny orzo so think it was too much pasta (and drank up all the broth) though the specified amount of bowties may be fine.

I'm not a big soup maker, but I regularly boil up the Thanksgiving turkey carcass for an annual avgolemono-type soup. This was an interesting, hearty--yet light--soup that the whole family loved. Lovely to look at, healthy, and tasty. I substituted garbanzo beans for the pasta and would continue to do that next time I make this. I plan to share this with friends.

Made this with Thanksgiving leftover turkey and stock. It was easy to make and did not take much time. It had a nice clean light taste. I used tri-color gemelli, added some cajun spice-- it was a bit bland for my taste at first. I also added fresh oregano and lavender thyme.

Think carefully before making this soup a day or two following a holiday as it is very work intensive with all the chopping, peeling, juicing, grating, etc. You've probably worked for days, as I did, preparing a holiday meal, and there are many easier ways to use up the turkey leftovers, including soups. I did make a bit more work for myself by making half of the stock called for with the turkey carcass and the usual stock vegetables. That being said, the soup was very tasty indeed!

Just about as good as soup can get. I used a leftover turkey bones and meat. I was also liberal with the Lemon and it was perfect. Instead of Farfale, I used whole wheat pasta. The big test was my finicky wife; she loved it too! She suggests fresh Cilantro added at the end next time.

What a great way to use left-over turkey! Took one of the reviewer's advice and made my own stock. This soup was so good it'll be one my family's favorites. I'll make it with chicken next time so we won't have to wait till next Thanksgiving or Chrismas, though!

This soup is delicious - light yet very flavorful. I have a few suggestions though - instead of canned chicken stock, I made a rich turkey stock with the Thanksgiving carcass and veggies in the crock pot over 24 hrs and used a defrosted package of frozen chopped spinach instead of fresh.

Great way to use leftover turkey. Casseroles are usually such a fattening way to eat the leftovers. This soup is healthy and tastes great (although I would add more seasoned salt and spices).
