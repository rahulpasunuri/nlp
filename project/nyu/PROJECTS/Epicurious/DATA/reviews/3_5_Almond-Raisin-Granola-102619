Great springboard recipe. Doesn't make big chunks of granola but I'm fine with that. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and added cinnamon and nutmeg. Could easily change to suit your particular tastes. May reduce the sugar some next time around.

The best way to use this recipe is as a template. You can easily change the nuts, change the dried fruit, change the liquid sweetener (honey, maple syrup)... personalize it. I always add a teaspoon of vanilla. And another half teaspoon salt. And some cinnamon or other coordinating spice. Today I made it into "Honey Walnut Cranberry Granola". Two weeks ago it was "Maple Almond Ginger" (with diced crystalized ginger). Play with it. You won't be sorry.

hands-down, the best receipe i've tried so far--and i've tried a few. it makes very crunchy/chunky granola, with lots of flavor. i add cinnamon and nutmeg, or i make it with vanilla and aprocots instead of raisins. fantastic.

i make this when i'm on vacation with many friends at the beach every year and every year i am begged for the recipe. of course i don't tell them anything about it!

This is a great basic granola recipe that modifies well. I add cinn. and nutmeg - lots of nuts, brazil [chopped] pecans, almonds. I use sunflower seed in place of sesame. I also have taken to using only honey - 6 - 8 Tbls at that as I don't need it real sweet. I add different dried fruit each time, dried pineapple, cranberries were great at christmas with the golden raisens. Great by the handful or with fruit and yogurt. You've spoiled me - no store bought will do any more!

That was a very nice tip from jgever of Marin County to cook the granola on the stovetop over med. heat for a couple minutes. I've made this recipe before and love it, but got actual chunks with this method. I actually made it in my roasting pan, so I was able to put it over the burners.

I have made this recipe 3 times already and have tried molasses, brown suger, maple syrup and honey in various relationships trying to get chunks. It does not matter what you use for the sugar part, because the only way you can get true big chunks of granola is this way - After mixing all the ingredients, put in a pot on the stovetop. On medium heat, slowly mix up the ingredients and let them cook for a minute or 2. As you stir, you will see chunks develop as the granola binds together. After a couple of minutes, spoon out the granola onto a cookie sheet, spread out and bake at 275. You will not get proper granola with a higher heat, just burnt bits, so keep it at 275 for 60-70 minutes. Lots of chunks require longer cooking. Just poke your head in the oven to see if the bits are toasty yet. I add chocolate chips, cranberries and fruit bits when the granola has completely cooled.

This is great and very simple. In place of 1 c. each of raisins/almonds I used 2 cups of Trader Joe's Cashew, Almond & Cranberry mix. Per another reviewer's suggestion, I used honey & increased the amount of honey/brown sugar to 7 Tbs. and 4 Tbs. water, and heated it in a saucepan until it was a thin, pourable consistency. I avoided stirring for the first 20 minutes, baked at 325 and got nice, big chunks of granola. It had great flavor and, with the honey, wasn't too sweet. I'm making it for the second time this week!

This is a great recipe! I cut the oil in half and use sunflower seeds instead of sesame seeds. Top with mixed berries and plain yogurt and it is quite a treat. If you want it to bake faster, turn up the heat to 325 and stir every 15 minutes until evenly browned. It takes about 45 minutes.

I've made this many times since I found this recipe in April and it's been hard to keep my granola jar full. My only question is why does this recipe require such a long baking time - 1 hr 15 mins as opposed to the half-hour average of other recipes?

Rating: 4
This granola is soooo good! I especially liked the maple syrup element. I made it a little more healthy by cutting down the oil by about a third and it is still fantastic. The only semi-complaint is that the sesame seeds don't bind well to the granola and I have hundreds of them floating in my cereal bowl. I don't mind them, but I would add more syrup and/or honey next time.

Great recipe and very easy. I used sunflower seeds instead of sesame seeds and honey instead of maple syrup just because that's what I had in the pantry. Used a mixture of raisins and craisins. Made a double batch and took to work. People were asking for more and for the recipe. Am taking the advice of the cook from Canada and will make for Christmas gifts this year.

This granola has quickly become a family must-have. I made quite a few adjustments to the recipe. I substituted pine nuts for almonds and dried cherries (or cherries mixed with golden raisins) for the raisins. I increased the brown sugar and the maple syrup to 7 Tbsp. and the water to 4 Tbsp. I also added 1 cup of pecan pieces and 1 teaspoon each of ground cinnamon and vanilla extract. The cherries are mixed in to bake for the last 20 minutes. Letting the granola sit undisturbed in the pan unitl it cools completely will yield more chunks.

This was good. I am a fan of low-carb eating, so I substituted agave nectar for the sugars. It was very good - haven't made granola in 20 years!

I followed the recipe with only one change - used flax seeds and just a tablespoon or so of sesame seeds. It was really delicious! I love the maple syrup flavor. Makes the kitchen smell soooo good.

Delicious, easy and versatile. Didn't have pure maple suyrup, but Aunt Jemima got the job done just as well. Honey and molasses are good substitutes too.

delicious! used sunflower seeds instead of sesame, and added a tsp of vanilla and cinnamon. i added a bit more water too (as per another reviewer's suggestion for getting chunkier granola). looking forward to trying it with the sesame next time, and different combinations of nuts.

i make granola every week from a mix of these recipes: suggest 3 cups oats, about a cup and a half of at least three nuts - i like to use hazelnuts or macadamia and then also sunflower seeds, almonds, sesame seeds. cashews are nice too. then i use a 1/3 cup of dark brown sugar and about 1/2 cup of dessicated coconut. (or fresh). next heat up about 1-2 tbsp of butter and add a little cinnamon, vanilla and about 2tbsp honey. Then add some water so that it will coat the mixture. Stir it all up and spread on baking trays for about half an hour at 350-400, stirring frequently. it's nice to pour a little maple syrup or honey on too. just a little. I try to use as little butter as possible but am probably killing myself with sugar instead! tastes fab though and i urge everyone to try making their own granola! i like it really chunky and this combo seems to work. i think adding water is key so that you get a mixture almost like a thick oatmeal and it toast up nicely in big chunks.

For my first attempt at making granola, I was pleased with the results. If you're not a fan of sesame seeds I would suggest leaving them out entirely, and perhaps substituting with something else small and crunchy (sunflower seeds?) The sesame does have a strong taste.

For the chunky bits, pour the mixture into the pan, and, before baking, take handfuls and squeeze into balls of stuff. They will fall apart a little, but you'll get some chunks. Don't stir it for about 20 minutes at the beginning of the baking. Worked for me, I hope that works for you! Try playing with substitutions for the nuts - walnuts, hazelnuts and pecans were each good. For the raisins - cherries, dry sweet cranberries and white raisins were good. For the maple syrup - honey was good. I also tend to add some coconut at the end too, so there's some toasted and some not. I'm looking forward to trying a previously mentioned ginger flavored version with dried ginger. Anyone else making this weekly now? I am.

Very good - try it without sesame seeds. I have made this with unsweetened cranberries & like the contrast of the tart flavors. I have also tried it with honey

I made this with two other recipes and this was the best. Compared to the other recipes it also had the lowest oil content as well. Will definately make this on a regular basis.

3.5 forks! This is better than the Chunky Date, Coconut, and Almond Granola I tried making yesterday. Looking forward to trying variations! P.S. I like sesame seeds and I didn't get any big chunks of granola, either.

Great recipe, but a bit heavy on the sesame seeds; use a scant 1/3 c. or it tastes too strong. Followed other reviewers' advice & added 1/2 c. coarsely chopped almonds & 1/2 c. slivered. Didn't get big chunks of granola though. Any suggestions? Did I stir too much?

Excellent! I had no idea granola was so easy to make, and this is so much better than anything I've purchased. I made my own substitutions to suit my tastes (and what I had on hand). I replaced half the raisins with chopped rolled dates, and replaced the sesame seeds with chopped cashews. It was terrific. This will almost certainly become a staple in our home.

I am a true granola lover & I've been searching for a really good recipe for a long time. This recipe satisfies my search. It compares to granolas searved in some of the finer bistro-ype restaurants. My husband is not a real granola eater & he quite likes it too. Highly recommended!

I made this for the first time a month ago and can see that topping up the empty cereal jar is going to be part of my routine every few weeks! I ommit the brown sugar from ours as we prefer it not too sweet and have added dried sour cherries to one, dried apples to another - whatever you chooseits all delicious!
