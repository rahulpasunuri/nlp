I made the celery root remoulade and it was delicious!

Good not great. The remoulade would have been better if the celery root had been parboiled a little. As is it was too crisp. For 2 of us I added about 1 cup of matchstick celery root to half a recipe of remoulade. The consistency was good. The seared scallops were not at all unique but I love seared scallops.

I made this for a starter at Thanksgiving and have made it several times since. It is a winner!
