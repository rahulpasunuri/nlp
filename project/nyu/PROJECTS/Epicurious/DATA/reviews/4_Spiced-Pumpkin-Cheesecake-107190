Made this for halloween, adding a sour cream topping. Melted chocolate used for candy coatings, then used a pastry bag to draw a spider web into the topping. Baked that for 6 mins. Chilled overnight. Topped it with a chocolate spider made with a Ferrero Rocher truffle as seen in a BH+G magazine couple of years ago. (Make 8 chevrons to use as spider legs. While they chill in the fridge, make a round base for the body. Set the truffle into the base. Work quickly and set the legs into the base. Finish with two orange eyes made from icing in a tube.) Bwahaha! This was a huge hit served amongst other "scary" foods.

Used 4 oz. of crushed ginger snaps, halved the whipping cream, and cut the cake into 1 1/2 inch squares, plated, and served for a ladies coffee. A huge hit! Decadent is the operative word. B.J. Harrick

Everyone loved this dessert. Only thing I would mention is that I should have removed the foil from the outside of the pan before putting in refrigerator overnight. There was water left between the foil and pan and made the crust a little soggy.

Love this recipe! I've made it twice, and both times everyone was swooning. I made just one change. We love the crust, so I doubled the ingredients for the crust only, and the second time I made it substituted ginger snaps for graham crackers. Divine. Absolute heaven! Making it again this weekend to give as a gift!

This recipe is just okay. It isn't really a pumpkin pie or a cheesecake, and neither is it a new taste. It is just a watered-down version of both flavors. For all the calories and cost for this cake, I wish I would have left out the pumpkin and spices, so as to enjoy the creamy indulgence of a plain cheesecake.

This was well received at my Thanksgiving table. The only change I made was to cut the recipe by 25% and use an 8 inch springform pan.

I have been making this every year for the past 5 years and it is anticipated by everyone. The only adjustment I made is to use 1/2 cup heavy cream instead of 1 cup because the cake was coming out too soft. It's a little firmer if you use less cream.

This is easy ad wonderful. I used the purchased graham cracker crumbs, even easier. The filling is delicious, not too sweet. this is a light and fluffy cheesecake. I prefer a denser cheesecake, but, after a big dinner, this is perfect. Made one the other day for work and everyone raved.

I was extremely excited for this cheesecake, but I have to admit that I am a bit disappointed in how it turned out. I expected it to have a combination of pumpkin and cheesecake flavor, but my family found it to be overwhelmingly pumpkin. The consistency was smooth as silk and quite nice, but I wish there was more crust and that there was a bit more of a complex flavor to it.

Used gingersnaps instead of graham crackers, would probably halve the whipping cream when I prepare this again. Absolutely, decadently rich and delicious, if, of course, you like a faux pumpkin pie flavor. Recipe is a keeper! B.J. Harrick

I have made this a few times, most recently as mini-cupcakes like the earlier reviewer. The filling is enough for 48 - so I had to double the crust recipe to accommodate. This is my go-to cheesecake recipe.

This was delish! If you like pumpkin pie, you'll love this. Thanks to Chicago cook for ideas. I thought it could have used a tiny bit more spice. Next time I'll use 1.5 x of them. I used a 9" pan, so cooked for 85 minutes, turned off the oven, cracked the door open for 15 mins, then opened more and let sit another 15 minutes before taking out. No cracks, and not overdone. Served w/bourbon carmel sauce also on this site.

Just made this reciepe recently and was a big hit! Actually made mini cheesecake cupcakes and topped them with whipped cream sweetened with a little confection sugar and cinnimon. As cupcakes they need to cook for 30-35 minutes at 350 degree oven.

DROOOOL! This recipe is awesome. Everyone at the table (including all the kids!) raved. Like others I avoided the "dunk your cheesecake" suggestion and instead did what a prior reviewer suggested, which was to cool the oven down slowly -- worked perfectly, no cracks. The cheesecake was really light and fluffy, unlike most cheesecakes, and the taste was to die for. I wondered if maybe it might have been better with another day in the fridge -- I'll let you know tomorrow! Accompanied with whipped cream, icing sugar, hint of ginger, hint of allspice - nice add.

I've made this recipe for the past few years during the holidays, and my family loves it. My father dislikes cheesecake, but asks me to make this recipe for Thanksgiving. I like to use gingersnaps for the crust, when they are on hand, but otherwise I just add some cinnamon and ginger when I am mixing the graham crackers.

This recipe turned out great. It was a tad too sweet for my tastes though, so if I were to make it again I would cut the sugar back to 1 cup for the filling. Other than that, it turned out great.

I made this for my husband's pot luck at work and several people tracked me down to tell me how good it was. One person said "I put my foot in it," which is probably one of the best compliments of my cooking career. I followed instructions exactly, but baked at 425 for 10 minutes, then 225 for an hour, and removed when the very center was still a bit jiggly. I allowed to cool overnight in the oven, then chilled the next day in the fridge until lunch. No cracks, it came out sublime.

This is everybody's favorite cheesecake recipe. I follow the recipe exactly exact I use gingersnaps for the crust ( I keep all other ingredients in the crust the same.

The perfect holiday cheesecake.

I made this cheesecake for our Thanksgiving meal and everyone said they loved it, even people who don't care for cheesecake. I loved it too. (In fact, I was only unhappy that there was none left over!) Per a recommendation below, I used ginger snap cookies and butter for the crust instead of graham crakcers, sugar, cinnamon and butter. I didn't add the ground ginger to the filling either, but found that the ginger snap crust was a much loved component to this dish.

Rating: 4
Easy and absolutely delicious ! Turned out perfectly with very small crack. Several guests asked for recipe...some said they thought it the best dessert they'd ever had!! Only changes I made were to the crust (oh, and water bath in rack below) - cinnamin graham crackers and gingers snaps - the ginger snaps make it imho. We don't make a lot of desserts at home, but this is a splurge I will keep in the repertoire for sure !!!

We have made four of these, three for company. This is a wonderful treat. I had to change quantities up for an 11 inch spring pan, but not a problem. This is now one of the two "must have" holiday deserts. We are going to make our fifth of this tomorrow. I think it is outstanding.

Rating: 4
This was easy to make and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, except for immersing the springform pan in the water bath (I didn't trust the foil wrapping to prevent leakage, and chose to put a water bath on the rack below instead). Next time, I might try adding some pecans to the graham cracker crust, but really don't think that it needs tinkering to be a big success with your family or guests.

I had never made a cheesecake before I tried this and I was surprised by how easy it was! After reading the reviews, I used gingersnaps (which coincidentally I'm utterly addicted to) instead of graham crackers, and I skipped the cloves because I didn't have them. My oven is super tiny though, and I didn't have a big enough roasting pan, so I didn't use a water bath - instead i put a pan of boiling water on the rack immediately below the cake. It must have worked, since there was no cracking. Baked for 80 minutes, turned off the oven and let it set for another hour or so, then into the fridge overnight. Drizzled caramel on top and crushed some more gingersnaps over it - and voila, a totally fancy looking dessert that was embarrassingly easy and was totally delicious.

One small shallow crack. Added a bit more spice for family's personal taste- turned out excellent. Made for Christmas, making again one week later!

I chose this recipe because it had the most spices involved of the recipes I looked at - I really like a pumpkin cheesecake that has a lot of pumpkin pie flavor. I ended up doing the crust differently - because I wanted to use my favorite gingersnaps. The filling was great - the only change I made was that I used about 1/4 C more pumpkin and reduced the whipping cream also by 1/4 C. I didn't bother with the water bath because I don't mind it cracking. The texture was still creamy. Overall, it was awesome and I would definitely make it again.

A great and forgiving recipe. Since the local grocery stores were out of whipping cream I substituted plain yoghurt - no problem. I also accidentally let it bake a tad too long and it cracked - but as it cooled overnight the crack resealed and was easily hidden with ome chocolate leaves. A big hit with my friends.

First time, water bath leaked into the cheesecake, making a nice flavor but soggy cheesecake. My aluminum foil had not seams, so don't see how it happened. Second time, no water bath. Cracked same as first cake, but no soggy. Flavor was good, but not exceptional. The resto of the family said it was delicious and should make it again.

Super easy and wonderful cheesecake. Everybody loved it. I reduced sugar from 1/4C to 2TBS for crust, 1-1/2C to 1-1/4C for filling. I took review comments and increased ground cinnamon from 2tsp to 3tsp. Again, I took review comment and skipped water bath and baked 1hr 20min and shut off heat and left cake in the oven for another 30minutes or so to reduce sinking/cracking. It worked wonderfully:) It seems a little too wet for my liking...(everybody else really loved this cake though) so I am planning to reduce the amount of heavy whipping cream next time. This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent. Followed the recipe, with the exception of the water bath. Took the suggestion of others, and placed a pan of water in the oven-- came out perfectly - no cracks. Others are right, the cheesecake sets wonderfully in the fridge. I took it out when it was still very wobbly (after 1.5 hours). The browning of the top was a good guide. Served it with simple whipped cream, and it was a big hit at Thanksgiving.

This is a fabulous recipe. Two of my guests said they don't like pumpkin but were willing to try it. They loved it, finished their servings and asked for more. One asked me for the recipe. Also, we had a self-described pumpkin pie fiend who decided he likes this recipe even better than pie. I'm going to try this with a touch of semisweet chocolate drizzled over it next time. As for the water -- whenever I make cheesecake, I fill the bottom part of my broiler pan with water and put it on the rack just under my cheesecake. It does not make the cake soggy -- it just keeps it from cracking. Further crack prevention: about ten minutes early, turn the oven off. After 15-20 minutes, open the oven door but don't move the cake. Then open the door wider. Then, finally, take the cake out and let it sit for a long time. The idea is to reduce the temperature very slowly.

My husband said this was "the best cheesecake I've ever had, and I've had my share of cheesecakes," so of course I have to give it four forks. I only had a nine-inch springform pan, so I baked for a little longer. I did use the water bath, and there were no cracks. It came out beautiful.

This was a delicious cheesecake--creamy and flavorful. I followed others' recommendations and tried to make a ginger snap crust. It tasted OK but was soggy.

I don't usually like cheesecake but I just made this for Thanksgiving and it was extremely easy and delicious! I used a pre-made 9" graham cracker pie crust (which I pre-baked for 10 min) and reduced all of the ingrediants (except for the eggs) by 25% since the crust was smaller than the recipe called for. I still had a little bit of batter leftover. Also, I used a combination of low-fat and non-fat Philadelphia cream cheese and the texture was very smooth.

Out of all the cheesecakes I have made, I believe this one has the creamiest texture. I just took it to our Thanksgiving and received compliments from some very good cooks in our family. I let the ingredients set out for two hours to get at room temperature, and I used cinnamon graham crackers in the crust without adding more cinnamon. I also used fresh pumpkin instead of canned. A relatively easy way to do that is to take a four to eight pound pumpkin, remove the stob, and cut in half. Scoop out the seeds, then the "stringy stuff" with a big spoon. Place in a roasting pan with two cups water, and bake at 350 degrees for an hour and a half. Scoop out the pumpkin and blend in a blender or food processor. Push through a sieve into a bowl; measure 15 oz (almost two cups). This is extra work - it added another day to my recipe, but our grocery was out of pumpkin, and I already had a white "ghost pumpkin" from Halloween (the dark orange "jack-a-lantern" pumpkins don't do as well this way). Doing a pumpkin in the oven is a lot easier than the way my mother and grandmother did it by peeling, cubing, and boiling. I think the fresh pumpkin made a good cheesecake. My three layers of foil leaked; next time, I plan to put the water under the pan as suggested by some earlier reviewers. Thank you, everyone, for the advice - this cheesecake is delicious!

I haven't tried the cheesecake yet as it's still cooling down, but I tried some of the 'film' on top and if a little burned film is any indication, this cheesecake is amazing!

This is an awesome cheesecake. I got the recipe from a friend and I've made it several times. It is delicious. The one thing I noticed is that it pays to buy Philadelphia cream cheese.

I made this for a fall hors d'oeuvres and dessert party and this turned out phenomenally well. Lots of rave reviews, including one from a pastry chef! Made a few minor modifications: decreased sugar by 1/4 cup, replaced whipping cream with sour cream (I don't like too-sweet cheesecakes), and used the gingersnap crust recommended by another cook. It helps to have extra-wide aluminum foil for wrapping the springform pan to prevent water leaks. A great recipe with way better flavor and texture than the Cheesecake Factory!

Served at a dinner party for 14 tonight, and everyone raved. One guest commented that he doesn't usually like cheesecake because of its richness, but this one is light (because of the pumpkin?). I topped it with whipped cream flavored with vanilla, sugar, and a bit of cinnamon. The only problem: I didn't wrap the springform pan tightly enough with alum foil, and the water bath leaked onto the crust. :( Didn't seem to affect the cheesecake.

This is a truly wonderful cheescake! I have only made it once, for a Christmas party, and I did make a few successful changes to fit the situation: I pulverized about 3 cups of gingersnaps and mixed with the butter for the crust, no additional sugar necessary. I baked it in a jelly roll pan for 30 minutes and refrigerated overnight. To serve, I melted 8 oz of white chocolate in the microwave for about 2 min, and drizzled it over the top of the cake. This makes 96 two-bite pieces.

I have tried to make pumpkin cheesecake in the past and it just wasnt pumkiny enough. I'm happy to say that this was good n' pumpkiny! had just the right amount of spices and real pumpkin flavor. The consistency was semi-thick and creamy. I didnt do a water bath because I topped the cake with the sour cream/bourbon topping from another recipe so a crack didnt matter.

1) To waterproof your cake, use a single piece of heavy duty foil, doubled, and make sure it comes all the way up the sides of the pan. 2) Since we have several diabetics to serve, I substituted Splenda for all the sugar and added a tablespoon of molasses to the filling - it turned out wonderfully. 3) The crust could definitely be thicker; I would double the recipe and line the springform with parchment paper to prevent sticking.

Just a note about cracked cheesecakes...almost always it's because they're over baked. Bake cheesecakes just like custards, only until they're set. When you shake the pan, the filling should jiggle (in one mass), but not look liquidy. Hope this helps.

I made this for a household of friends who devoured it voraciously. It was a tad bit shy of perfect because the top was cracked; I didn't have the cookware to create a proper bain-marie and followed the advice to use a pyrex pan filled with water placed on the floor of the oven. Nonetheless, the consistency was smooth and fluffy, and it tasted incredible.

Pumpkin cheesecake is a great cheesecake for those afraid of pure creamy-cheese flavour, and this recipe does pumpkin some serious justice! I used a different graham cracker crust recipe on this website (roughly doubles yield of above recipe) since I like that part best. I found the cake part to be a bit mushy after 1.5 hours of baking. I didn't want large cracks and perhaps underbaked, so next time I would accept cracks in the name of a firmer cheesecake! Maybe no water bath for those wanting a firmer cake?

Definitely do what they say and put the cake directly in the pan of water. The resulting cake is lighter, prettier and more delicious when cooked in the water bath.

A nice change from pumpkin pie. I substituted the whipping cream with the fat free half and half just to save some calories.

I missed Thanksgiving and instead celebrated this recipe in the UK at Xmas with my company not knowing anything about the joys of pumpkin! My only criticism would be that it is a little rich following Xmas Pudding and Trifle but it still went down very well! Even the Brits had seconds.....I have been inundated with requests for the recipe since. It was a pleasure to make and once the 5 pounds i put on over Xmas go away i will be back on the Pumpkin trail

Big hit! Serves 20 hungry people or 40 overly-stuffed post-party revellers. Days later people were stopping by to see if any cake remained. Freshly hand-whipped cream for topping is a must. Advice - I had to bake it 2 hours or more to ensure a proper set.

I made this for Christmas, and it was delicious. I used made a gingersnap crust instead of the graham cracker crust, used half and half instead of the heavy cream (it was what I had). I followed the advice of other reviewers who suggested baking it above a pan of water, rather than in a water bath. It has a nice, light texture but still tastes rich, and a delicate "pumpkin pie" flavor.

This cake was a hit over Thanksgiving; I made it exactly as the recipe stated. I garnished it with piped-on whipped cream and pecan brittle pieces and it was simply gorgeous. I don't think this needs any changes; it was creamy and pumpkin-y and delicious! And easy on top of it, so all you beginner chefs out there, give this one a try!

I figured out why some of us were having trouble with this recipe: You must make sure that the entire bottom of the spring form pan is covered with foil. I used foil that was somewhat shorter that the width of the pan, leaving seams, and my cake absorbed water from the bain marie. Total disaster. Next time I will either use larger/wider foil, or skip the water bath altogether. It does smell delicious, though.

Wow. That was great. BUT -- I had a hard time figuring out when it was ready to come out of the oven -- it was still very wiggly after the 1.5 hours. Also -- I doubled the crust and put it up the sides and it worked really well. I put the water in a pan underneath rather than using the bath and the cake totally cracked... not sure how I could have fixed that but I'd rather a cracked top to a soggy bottom. Thanks to all those of you who wrote comments -- I wouldn't have made it without you and this is a keeper!!!!

Since Nov 1, I have made this cheesecake 4 times. Everyones raves about it. I plan to make 2 more this Christmas. I placed a pan of water in the bottom of my oven & it worked beautifully.

This is a very flavorful cheesecake. I ended up making it twice over the Thanksgiving weekend. I added some slivered almonds to the crust for an added crunch and it came out wonderful. This cheesecake is going to be a staple for the holidays.

This is my second time making this cheesecake and I just love the flavor of it. However, both times it turned out a bit too wet inside, and when I cut it, it all collapsed. Any suggestions on how to make this a bit firmer?

I adapted this recipe for low carb dieters and a diabetic family member - making it crustless and with a sugar substitute. It was amazing - very satisfying and enjoyed by all. Be careful that the "sugar" you use is good for baking.

I loved tis recipe. Although i altered it a bit as well. I used ground ginger snaps and butter as the crust and made half of the recipe as called and the other half regular cheesecake and swirled it together. It came out beautiful and was a huge success.

Tested this cheesecake out at my husbands work! Received rave reviews...made it exactly as the recipe calls for. Looking forward to adding this to our Thanksgiving table.

I really liked the flavor of this, but I only gave it three forks because I prefer a denser cheesecake. I layered this with a chocolate cheesecake and coated it with chocolate ganache for a baby shower luncheon. It received a mass of compliments. Everyone wondered where I got the receipe. I think I'll make it for Thanksgiving as an alternative to pumpkin pie.

I think this is the best pumpkin cheesecake recipe ever printed in Bon Appetit. I give it three forks because it is a bit sweet. Everybody I've served it to considers it a four-forker. My German in-laws particularly request this cake when they visit.

I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream and the result was superb - the texture was light and almost mousse like, but still with the delicious flavor of cream cheese. I would also recommend adding some more graham crackers to the crust, as it came out a bit thin, especially as I'd finely ground the grahams.

Rating: 4
This was very good and guests loved it. It took quite a bit longer to cook than suggested and I would have doubled the crust part of the recipe to make it thicker and more noticible. I used low fat cream cheese for half of what was called for and don't think the flavor could have been improved.

This is a great cheesecake recipe. I follow the atkins diet, so I made a few variations....I used a macadamia/pine nut crust and used a sugar substitute (splenda - 10 packets) for the sugar called out in the recipe, I also used "pumkin pie spice" in lieu of buying all the other spices. I cut the recipe in half, because I like a thinner cheesecake, so I only baked it for 40 minutes and let it sit in the oven for an hour to cool down. It turned out wonderful.

This was an amazing dessert. I too used a few ginger snaps in the crust which added a delightful hint of spice. It was a huge hit at a dinner party where all of the guests requested the recipe. I will make this in place of pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving.

WOW- This is a great cheesecake. I replaced some of the graham crakers with ginger snaps and skipped the water bath, as suggested in previous reviews. I served it with spiced whipped cream and the caramel sauce from the pumpkin bread pudding recipe. EVERYONE loved it! EASY to make. Thanks for all the great suggestions.

Absolutely fantastic! The consistency is perfect. I too, used a gingersnap crust. I will use the basics of this recipe for other cheesecake variations. I will never again make pumpkin pie. In short, everyone loved it. Thank you!! ps: read the "Joy of Cooking" for cheesecake baking tips. It explains all the questions and guesswork that I've been reading from others about this recipe. Pros & cons of water bath, oven temp, etc.

Read all the rave reviews, and was disappointed. It met with all the accolades of your average Pumpkin Pie, not worth the extra effort or expense.

I served this for dessert when we hosted a pumpkin carving party last night...it is bound to become an autumn tradition at our house. It is so rich that you only need a little piece, but it is HEAVENLY! I did find that I had to bake it about 25 minutes longer than called for, each time I checked on it it was still jiggling in the middle. I wonder if this is because I skipped the waterbath step....anyway, it still turned out to be a total hit. The crust tastes like cinnamon teddy grahams!

I made this cheesecake for a wedding rehearsal. Everyone loved it! Several asked for the recipe to make it at Thanksgiving. It was so easy to make. Instead of placing the cheesecake in a pan of water, I placed the pan of water on the rack below. It turned out great! It had a creamy texture, just like a New York style cheesecake. I will definitely be making this again!

Served this at a party, and the next day a guest told us "your cheesecake was so good I dreamt about it!" It was a huge hit. We also used gingersnaps for the crust, and did not use the water bath, OR tinfoil. Delicious!

Simple to prepare. Fantastic cheesecake recipe! Consider placing a pan of water on the lower rack instead of using the water bath. Crust could have been a little firmer that way.

Very good! Our kids liked this too. Inspired by other reviews, I made a gingersnap crust, which was really delicious. This cheesecake is creamy and not overly dense, which I liked. I put a pan of water in the oven with it instead of using a water bath, but I still wrapped the pan in tinfoil, and it's lucky I did because it had a pool of grease (butter? or oil from the gingersnaps)in it that would've ended up in my oven otherwise. I think next time I'm going to think about putting some toasted or praline pecans on top as a garnish/enhancement.

Wonderful delicate texture - not dry and hard like so many. Pumpkin is just great. I added finely chopped pecans to grahamcracker crust for additional crunch and flavor.

This was delicious and surprisingly easy. Made the crust w/ gingersnaps and didn't use the water bath. It baked just fine. I highly recommend it as an alternative to pumpkin pie at the Holidays. My guests loved it and took home all the leftovers.

This was a delicious cheesecake. I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted a gingersnap crust for the graham cracker crust. I wrapped the springform pan in two layers of heavy duty foil using foil that was wide enough that there was no overlapping or seams. There was a slight amount of condensation between the foil and the bottom of the pan when I removed the foil right after taking the cake from the oven. Alas, my crust was very soggy and hard to get out of the pan (although it was delicious when I scraped it out later). YUM. The cheescake was good but I wonder what the purpose of the water bath is. Is it to keep the cake from cracking on top ( a problem I've had with other recipes that don't call for the water bath)?Will a small pan of water in the oven keep the top from cracking just as well as the water bath?

Divided crust and batter into 2 smaller pans. Turned out great. (Adjusted baking time). Nice combination of pumpkin pie and cheesecake, two of my favorites.

If you are one of the holiday traditionalists, (it MUST be a sweet potato pie, it MUST be apple, or pumpkin)...WELCOME to a menu makeover. Growing up we had the former for years, and I am very pleased to say I have a new tradition in my home. I made this for Thanksgiving '02, and now have 7 requests from family/friends to bring to Mom's this Christmas. (I'm only making 4). The recipe is easy, I processed slivered almonds with the graham crackers, and omitted the ground cloves. Very nice.

Stunning flavor. I used gingersnaps for my crust, too and say "thanks!" to whoever dreamed that up. After eating this, I'd never bother with plain old hum drum pumpkin pie again. A couple notes: I cut cheesecake with dental floss and found this crust too hard to break with it. That meant I struggled to serve it in attractive portions until I remembered that God made whipped cream specifically to hide those errors. And although there was water in my foil layers, it appeared none of it actually got into the springform pan. Oh, my spring form pan was too large for my roaster, so I lowered the whole thing into a soup pot and stuck it in the oven. Worked like a charm.

Absolutely outstanding dessert! I followed the recipe exactly and did have a slightly soggy crust, but it tasted so good that no one cared. My family insists this cheesecake be on our table every Thanksgiving and Christmas from now on! I too will try the pan of water instead of the water bath next time.

I researched several pumpkin cheesecake recipes before choosing the one I wanted to try. I followed the advice of another cook and used a ginger snap crust. I used gingersnaps and butter only. No extra spices or sugar. Otherwise, I followed the rest of the recipe as stated. It was great. I will make it again and again.

I made this for thanksgiving, and it was the best thanksgiving desert I have ever had! I didn't do the water bath, and it cracked, but this is only the 2nd cheesecake I have made, and it tasted wonderful! Next time I make it (Christams) I will put a pan with water underneat it so it won't crack.

Even the Thanksgiving dinner guest who claims not to like pumpkin said it was delicious! The combination of spices is what makes this cheesecake so tasty. I served it with creamy caramel sauce(recipe also from epicurious).

Made this for a Halloween party and it was gone within the first hour. Big Hit. I didn't use the foil method, but did fill an 8x8 pan with water and put it on the bottom shelf in the oven and it worked well, no cracks in the cheesecake! Oh, and I forgot to put in the whipping cream, but didn't notice in flavor or consistency, although I will remember it when I make it again this week.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I cut down the sugar in the crust to 2 tablespoons, and cut the sugar in the cake to about 1 or 1 and a quarter cups.I did this only because I've made a lot of cheesecakes in the past and this one seemed to call for more suger than most. I was worried about water soaking into the cake while it was baking in the water bath, so I used 3 or four layers of tin foil and wrapped the foil around the springform very carefully. The cake tasted great, the spices were just right, but my only complaint was that the lower outside of the crust was slightly soggy from water bath leak through. I had let the cake cool for maybe half hour to one hour before peeling away the foil. When I did remove it, it was full of water. I received many compliments on my cake, but next time I make this, I may just see what happens if I skip the water bath completely.Also, be sure to serve this at room temperature, otherwise the flavors can't be appreciated.
