We used this as a quick-fix recipe when our mangoes weren't ripe, and it was great. Maybe not the best salsa out there, but definitely worth making.

This recipe got rave reviews from teenagers and adults alike. I had to use dried sour cherries which are sweetened so I left out the sugar. Where can you find fresh or frozen sour cherries in Houston, Texas? I used it like a dip with corn chips but it went well the ham we also had.

Novel, but not amazing. This recipe solicits a mediocre "Isn't that nice". Most of my guests enjoyed the salsa without realizing it had a sour cherry base. A good condiment, but if I were a sour cherry, I wouldn't want to be represented this way.
