I used fresh dill weed and had fresh mint from my garden. This was easy and very good. TJ for great goat cheese.

I couldn't find any dill, dried or fresh, and so used some fresh thyme I had. Served it with raisin/sunflower seed crackers from Trader Joe's and the combination of sweet with the creamy spiciness of the spread was great with the Sangria served. Very popular. I'll definitely make it again and everyone at the party asked for the recipe.

Followed the recipe to a T. Except added cumin powder and fresh chopped dill. We made it to cool overnight. Next day, we sandwiched the spread between two Ritz crackers. We garnished the cracker sandwiches with fresh dill. They were a HIT!

Delicious appetizer. Gone in a flash. I used my mini-cuisinart for mixing.

I made this the night before I served it, and I shaped the cheese into a flower by putting a tablespoon of olive oil in a quart freezer bag that I had cut the end off of, put the cheese mix in the bag, and squeezed it through while it was still very soft. It was very cute- better than just sitting in a bowl, at least. Oh, and it tasted very good, too! Nice herb flavors.

I made this as part of a three dip spread I served at a holiday party (the other two were the Feta-Pine Nut and the Smoky Chipotle Hummus, both from this site). The simplest of the three, it is also the most delicious. The dill really stands out in the recipe (because I used FRESH, not dried. I am not sure why this recipe calls for dried but I never use dried herbs if I have the option of using fresh instead). I served the three dips with toasted sliced french bread drizzled with olive oil. Big hit!

I gave this 4 forks because it was a snap to make and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my family literally scraped the serving bowl clean. I am making it again today for weekend guests.
