Such a fine blend of flavors! My fresh rosemary got a little dry so I snipped it off the branch with scissors into little pieces and poured a little hot water on it for a few minutes. Then I strained it blended it with the olive oil and tossed it with everything, it worked okay but fresher would be better, I think.

Super easy and delicious. I didn't have fresh rosemary but like the other reviewer said, dried worked just as well. Everyone loved it and I can't wait to make it again.

Good, easy, and simple! You can use dried or fresh rosemary and either way is yummy! To keep garlic from burning just use a bit more oil, the garlic should get pretty toasty but not burnt.

Really delicious! The cook time was spot on so the insides of the vegetables were soft. But, my garlic burned. I think you can also get away with using dried rosemary, as the oven dries it out anyway.

This is a great recipe, I made it for the family last night and everyone loved them, they were gone instantly. The 47 year old, 1 year old, 2 year old, and three 13 year olds all enjoyed and will be making these again very soon!
