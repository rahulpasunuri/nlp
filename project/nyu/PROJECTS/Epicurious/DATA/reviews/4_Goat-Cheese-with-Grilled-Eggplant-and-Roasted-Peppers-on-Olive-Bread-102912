I bought some eggplant for parm...too hot and humid to bake? So I went to my Epi app and found this recipe. Fresh local goat cheese from down the street, on Italian bread (sorry) grilled and I roasted my own red pepper over the gas stove. Incredible fusions of taste! Perfect meal if you want to impress guests..or yourself. With a boiled ear of local corn??? Argggh.

This is a fantastic sandwich. It has become a late summer treat- when the eggplants and peppers are in season. Rave reviews and requests from family to make it over and over again. The recipe is perfect the way it is.

OMG...I love goat cheese so much I want to marry it and then consummate the relationship. The only thing I did differently was use a herbed goat cheese and make the sandwiches open faced. I took a slice of bread, smeared it with butter I had infused with garlic, then put on the eggplant, the red peppers then I put goat cheese on top and broiled the whole thing. DAYYUM!

I made eggplant parmesan first and had extra eggplant leftover and this was a great way to use it. Very quick and simple preparation since I already had the eggplant prepared. I used fresh olive loaf bread so when it was grilled, it turned out delicious and the bread was not too crunchy or crumbly.

This was my best laugh of the day! The esteemed previous reviewer said it all . . . "nice photo". However, the recipie sounds wonderful too.
