This was perfect! Easy to make and the results were just a classic and delicious dish that everyone loved. I live outside the US so there's no Stovetop available and I was a little nervous about making stuffing from scratch. It was super easy though and I'm very pleased with the results. I used a combination of old bread and croutons.

This is it - the dressing/stuffing recipe - no need to look further or add anything else. This is exactly what I love about dressing, it was moist, a bit crunchy on the top, very flavorful, and easy to make! I toasted my day old bread until it was completely dry, and I definitely recommend it, really holds up well to soaking up the stock but not turning to mush. I used turkey stock (turkey bouillon cube) and it was delicious! I made it twice, once for dinner and again the day after because there were no leftovers but everyone wanted more! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

Made this with challah. Every year I use a different stuffing recipe. They've been good, but this is THE ONE. I increased the recipe by 50% because I was using a 15x11 pan. I also used homemade stock, which wasn't salted at all. So in all I doubled the salt, and it worked out well.

Love it. Only drawback is that we had NONE for leftovers, it was such a big hit!

This is the closest thing to old fashioned cooked in the bird stuffing I've had in a while. I did use homemade stock which I think makes a difference because the flavors are very simnple and I did use more stock than called for, but very tasty!

This is it! The dressing mom made when I was a kid. SOOO yummy! I used "poultry seasoning" as a substitute for some of the spices like mom did, since it has them in it anyway, and it was wonderful... FINALLY, dressing like Mom's!

This got rave reviews at our Thanksgiving. It is definitely simple and traditional, but I think that's the appeal. The only change I made was to use sourdough instead of white. It was easy to make the day before and bake off while the turkey cooked.

I made and cooked the entire dish the day before as it said in the recipe. I let it cool and then kept it in fridge overnight. Took it out first thing to let it come to room temp and then cooked the remainder of the time, without foil, when turkey came out. It was fabulous and crispy...not soggy at all. I used vegetarian broth instead and added some baby kale and toasted pine nuts. Finally, a delicious and vegetarian dressing option!! It was a hit. (I also followed the directions in the magazine about the bread...used a really good peasant bread that was about a week old and ripped the pieces with my hands rather than cut with a knife.)

reminded me of the dressing I had as a kid only better. I did cut the butter a bit and didn't miss it. I made the coornbread sausage dressing also, but this one was the hit of the day. This will be my every year dressing from now on.

Absolutely delicious. First time I made a dressing instead of stuffing, and I wanted something without sausage. So much butter it was almost like a savory bread pudding. Everything else on the menu was pretty healthy, so it was good to have one rich item. I baked it in two stages because I only have one oven. Baked it covered, then kept it covered in the warming oven (high setting) while the turkey cooked. The put it back in the oven uncovered while the turkey rested and I made the roasted potatoes & veggies.

This was a hit here. I made as written except for making and freezing (separately) the bread cubes and the celery and onion mixture a week early. Thawed both and continued preparation the day before Turkey Day. Reheated as directed. Four people devoured most of the recipe amount.

Great flavor, but be mindful of adding ANY additional liquid, as mine turned out very moist/gummy at the bottom, despite a longer turn in the oven. The flavors were great, the proportions of veggies & herbs were as well, but we prefer more crispy-ness, so I'll not add a drop more broth next time.

What I really want at Thanksgiving is stuffing that tates like mom's. This is IT but even better because of the fresh herbs. I've made it twice already. I like dressing to be moist with a crispy top so I add two additional eggs and 1 cup extra chicken broth and bake for just a bit longer.

For a different, delicious combination: 1. Use only 1 stick of butter - add 1oz olive oil 2. Only one teaspoon of salt, preferably sea salt and better grey sea salt 3. Add 1/2 pound of pre-cooked, pork sausage - hot or mild 4. Add one cup of wild rice - pre-cooked 45 minutes - to bread mixture 5. A touch of all spice (1/2 teaspoon) Follow all the same directions. I also like to broil pre-cooked, skinned chestnuts in a touch of brandy and sprinkle on top before baking. Less butter makes it less mushy. I don't suggest adding all the stock right away, and I use egg whites instead of whole eggs.

I haven't made this yet, but plan to make it using the 2-day method. I will revise my review once I'm done, but I wanted to jump on now because I don't think that @CookingMamaInRM, who gave it 2 forks, read the recipe correctly. For the 2-day method, my understanding is that the first 40-45 minutes can be cooked in advance, THEN another 40-45, and an ADDITIONAL 10-15 minutes if you're starting from a cooled mixture rather than one that has just come hot out of the oven. The foil is on top for the first set, and it's uncovered for the second set. It appears as though this person just mixed it on day one, let it sit and get mushy in the refrigerator, then try and cook it fully the next day. No wonder it turned out mushy...

I made this as a trial run for Thanksgiving dinner. I followed the recipe exactly. However, I did make it ahead yesterday (completely assembled) and then put it into the oven today to cook. It says in the direction you can do this but to just cook it 10-15 minutes longer. It took nearly 2 hours to cook and still it was very mushy. I kicked up the heat to 450 to get any crunch at all. Maybe it can be assembled the night before without the chicken broth added... Not sure.. The flavor is outstanding, if I didnt have this issue of it taking 2 hours, I would have rated it much higher.

the 'stuffing' of my youth, bringing back memories of my grandmother at 5 in the morning, starting her turkey! it may be simple, but to me it is simply delicious; and of all the dressings i have made over the years, this one is my favorite, and based on what is left over (nothing-unless i have hidden extra in the back of the frig...) others love it as well. i will be making it this again this year, with a good quality artisan white-and will fill another loaf pan, sliced it makes a fabulous base for hot turkey sandwiches or cold turkey sandwiches with cranberry mayonnaise, yum...
