There are readers out there that feel it is a sin to tinker with recipes. Get over it!!! I view recipes as the starting point to be altered based on what's in one's imagination and culinary skills, the pantry, and the fridge. To this one, I added 8-oz. of wild mushrooms which I sauteed with the onions, 2 8-oz. cans of minced clams with their juices (since the store had only 8-oz. of fresh bay scallops), chicken stock in place of the yucky bottled clam juice, one cup of half & half in place of the heavy cream, and about a cup of frozen baby corn. To die for!!!! Be adventuresome and experiment.

The recipe was good but asks," why couldn't it be more". Not worth the price to make

Fabulous! I used 2 cups of half and half and 2 cups of clam juice. As suggested, I doubled the potatoes and mashed them a bit in their liquid when done. While I cooked the scallops, the potatoes simmered and thickened the broth. The result was perfect scallop chowder. A keeper!

Delicious! Nantucket bay scallops are fresh now... try this recipe. I used a combination of bacon and ventreche & added a bit of finely chopped red bell pepper. Add a few drops of Pernod before serving.

Fantastic! This has become a favorite in my home. I sometimes add crawfish tails, shrimp, clams, or even lobster meat to make it a seafood chowder.

I used one cup of good clam juice and 2 1/2 cups homemade shrimp stock (plus water for the desired thickness). The shrimp stock added a great sweetness along with the use of maple-cured bacon. Also, added a little heat with a generous splash (maybe a 1/2 tsp) of tabasco. I only had small Yukon gold potatoes, so I left the peel on, which held them together nicely. Served with a crusty bread...this chowder is out of this world!

I used one bottle of clam juice and chicken broth for the remaining liquid, 3 large potatoes which I pureed about half of to thicken the soup, 1 T. cornstarch, whole milk instead of cream, thawed frozen scallops, which should be thouroughly drained so that they can brown in the pan, and added a cup of frozen corn kernels. Delicious.

My husband absolutely loved this dish. He asked if we could have it again next week. I did double the potatoes because we kind of like extra potatoes and I used a little corn starch to thicken not because there was anything wrong with it before but because we like thicker chowders.

This was quick and easy. I made half the recipe...and used red skinned potatos, not peeled and also added two ears of fresh corn. I did substitute Vermouth for the wine. Will make again.

This was fantastic! Expensive to make, but worth every penny. I used frozen sea scallops and they were delicious. Next time I would leave out 1/2 cup of the clam juice and add another potato, just to make it thicker. I'll also try adding some corn as another reviewer suggested. I can't wait to make this chowder again. Very impressive for company.

I LOVE this chowder. My boyfriend, who doesn't like chowder, also loves it! It is not too heavy and the flavors are excellent. I have made it many times, and I usually cut the recipe in half. I just use frozen scallops. My boyfriend and I agree that this is better the next day.

Definately a hit. I double up on the potato and puree with an immersion blender right in the pot until I reach the desired consistancy. Then I add the corn. I use the frozen bay scallops from Trader Joe's, to keep the budget down, and splurge on a good loaf of bread.Yum!

This is excellent. I love it. I have used frozen scallops and it turned out great. My bf doesn't like chowder, and he LOVES this. Definitely one of my favorites.

I have been making this recipe since it appeared in 95. Lost it recently and was thrilled to find it again. I splurge and use fresh Nantucket Bay scallops and don't always need to thicken. Save that for bisques. Serve with a good sherry at the table for thos inclined.

Very good. I did use frozen bay scallops and added corn per another suggestion.

Has anyone tried with frozen scallops ?

Absolutely the best chowder! Just a little tweaking, that is, it does need to be thickened a little as others have said. I'm always asked for the recipe. It never fails to get rave reviews, and I must have made it a dozen times in the last few years.

Since I omitted the bacon (intentionally), I will not rate this recipe and mess up the average ;-) It was good, though I would like to find a way to improve the flavor without resorting to bacon. And yes, it would be nice to make the soup thicker, whether via cornstarch or pureed potatoes.

Incredible! I changed the recipe slightly - instead of 2 potatoes I used one and added fresh corn from 3 small cobs which added a wonderful sweet taste and great color. Also, since I ran out of clam juice, I added water which left the flavor bland so I added some beef bouillon and it was fantastique.

Excellent and easy to make! I've made this recipe many, many times since I first saw it in the magazine 7 years ago.

This dish won a neighborhood chowder cook-off. All the other chowders were complicated broths with a myriad of shellfish, but everyone was raving how great the base/broth of my chowder was. Given the amount of time and effort everyone else had expended, I was a little embarrassed to admit that all I did was open some bottles -- clam juice, white wine and whipping cream. I adjusted the recipie only slightly -- using a maplewood smoked bacon instead of regular. I also made the broth thicker, first pureeing a portion of the soup with extra potatoes and adding it back and then, when it still wasn't thick enough for my taste, by adding some corn starch, which worked like a charm. Next time I'm going to try the same base with some salmon fish, corn and dill.

After the onions were sauteed I added a couple of teaspoons of flour to make a roux before adding the liquid. I also pureed a portion of the potatoes to help thicken. I added some spices to give it a little more of a zing. I don't eat scallops but my hubby and kids thought this was super!

This was a very easy and delicious recipe -- the only complaint I received was that it was little too watery. I added some cornstarch blended with hot water (about 2-3 teaspoons to 1 cup of water) and that improved the texture. Very tasty!

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was outstanding! Nice because a lot of it can be done in advance and the scallops are added at the last minute. It was a real hit!

I left out the bacon (forgot to purchase at the grocery store). Chowder turned out delicious anyway. Served it with french bread hot out of the oven. Next time I'll have to try it with the bacon.

I cut the bacon fat to 1 tbsp and used whole milk instead of cream. Made for a lighter version, but still very tasty.

I should preface this by saying that maybe I just don't like bacon with scallops - but it seemed to overpower the delicacy of the seafood flavor for me. At the same time, if found it weirdly bland in other ways - added sherry and that made it a bit more flavorful for me. My boyfriend thought it was great though, so I think maybe its just me.

We enjoyed this wonderful chowder on Boxing Day. It was made with fresh scallops shipped in from Maine. I am looking forward to making this again and again!!

Being a wholesale seafood dealer on the Maine coast..this is one of the best scallop chowder/stew recipes I've ever had!!!

I think this recipe is delicious because it has a sweet, creamy, smokey taste. I recommend using a thick slice quality bacon.
