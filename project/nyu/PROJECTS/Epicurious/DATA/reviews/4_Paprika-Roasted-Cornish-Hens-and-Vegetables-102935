Served as Christmas Eve dinner and it was excellent. This is the second time I've made this. I used smoked paprika this time and was pleasantly suprised at the great flavor. Threw in a turnip and some brussel sprouts with everything else and it worked. The temperature for the hens doesn't seem right and I stuck with the suggestion of 375, but needed more time for the hens to cook through. Will definitely make again; nice, simple and delicious.

This has become our favorite recipe ever!! The only thing we do different is double the amouth of oil & seasonings. This just didn't seem like enough. We also add a cut up parsnip. It's awesome!

It was a last minute choice for my cornish hens and I, too, used what veggies I had - parsnips, carrots, red pepper, brussel sprouts and acorn squash. I used half the cayenne called for and found some of the veggies a little spicy. I cooked it in the upper third of the oven at 400 and mine took an hour

This was super delicious and easy. I do agree that the temp is wrong, should be 375, and the cooking time is excessive. Everything was done in 45 minutes for me at 375.

This was a really great recipe! I did decrease the temperature to 375. Used vegetables I had around: sweet onion, celery, squash, carrot. Did not use sour cream and did not miss it.

This recipe is easy and full of flavor. I decreased the temperature to 375 and everything came out perfect. I used turnips, brussel sprouts, celery root and the red peppers. I accidently bought hot hungarian paprika, but it tasted great! I also added a little lemon juice to the herbed oil. I went without the cayenne. I also made a sauce with the pan jiuices and sour cream. I may omit the sour cream next time around and add some white wine.

I would have rated this higher if the recipe had given the correct temperature! I figured 475 was way too high, and it was! They were nearly burned after just 10-15 minutes! Turned it down to 375 on convection, and they were done in about 35 minutes. They tasted great!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. My Indian-born mother was in heaven over it. I didn't have caraway seeds and used whatever veggies were in the house -- still great. Had to turn down the temperature or those birds would surely have burned -- not sure what the thinking is there. Be sure to use Hungarian paprika.

This dish was excellent!! I added an onion and turnip. The turnip really infused great flavor. A great root vegetable comfort food dish. The sour cream doesn't add anything, in my opinion, and I won't bother with it next time.

I thought this was really excellent. It is beautiful to look at and so delicious. I got a little nervous about the vegetables cooking too fast, so I added water to the pan a couple of times. This created about 1 cup of sauce by the end, so I put it in a small pitcher that people could pass around at the table. I'll definitely make again.

To my mind, the sour cream should be mixed with the pan juices and reheated to make a sauce for the chicken and vegetables. We really liked it that way.

Celery root was not available so was omitted. Reduced the temp to 400 F (I also had bread in the oven, which typically doesn't do well at 475) after adding the hens. I basted twice during the cooking, and the hens were done about 10 minutes early even at the lower temperature. This is a beautiful dish and gorgeous presentation and it tastes absolutely divine! Garlic lovers might consider stuffing the birds with about 3 cloves of crushed (not minced) garlic for a little extra flavour. Personally, I liked the sour cream with the roasted vegetables.

I was presently surprised at the difference the caraway seeds make with this. The flavor of the whole dish is wonderful. I have also made this omitting some of the vegetables and substituting others for some of those called for in the recipe.

My family enjoyed this recipe but, I did not care for the combination of cayenne pepper and caraway seed and consider this recipe to be OK.

This recipe is fabulous. The only change I would make is a little less salt. I used turnip instead of potato and you can definitely vary the vegetables. I'm sure rutabaga, parsnips or brussels sprouts would also be good, but keep the carrots and red peppers for the nice color. I cooked the veggies for 15 minutes before adding the hens, then reduced temp to 450 and cooked the hens for a total of 50 minutes. So easy and delicious!

I've made this quite a few times and every time it's been a winner!! I even impressed my folks. It has a great presentation for a dinner party. I wouldn't change a thing.

I had to make a lot of adjustments to this recipe. First, I couldn't find celery root in the store soI left it out. I also wanted to make only two cornish hens so I tried to decrease all of the seasonings by a third.Then, everything seemed to cook much faster than the recipe stated. I took the vegetables out after the first 1/2 hour of cooking with the meat and I decreased the temperature for the hens to 425 degrees on my convestion oven. I still had to take the cornish hens out 10 minutes earlier than stated. All that said and done, this recipe came out pretty good. The vegetables were tasty. The meat came out tender and was delicious dipped in the pan juices. The sour cream added a nice contrast to the vegetables but I preferred the dish without it.

This is an excellent dish! I had to cut down on the cayenne; the first time I made it, it was so hot that it was barely edible, but we could tell that it was good (maybe our cayenne is old, making it stronger?) I also cut down the cooking time for both the vegetables & the hens.

We made this dish for our New Year's Eve party--Extremely elegant and easy and absolutely delicious. Hint--line your pan with foil if it's non-stick so the pan isn't so messy to clean up

This is delicious, however I shortened the cooking time.
