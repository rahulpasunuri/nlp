This is a very good weekday recipe. It is quick, easy to make and very tasty. One addition I made was to add a grilled and chopped chicken breast.

This came out great, but I made a few changes. I replaced onions with shallots and added some grated lemon peel. I also used homemade chicken broth. And I had some fresh sheep's milk cheese so I stirred some of that in at the end. I also normally don't add most of the liquid in the beginning of a risotto, but for this one it seems helpful to do so to incorporate all the Swiss chard. I didn't measure it, but I probably had more than 4 cups of chard and a rather small pan so the liquid helped wilt it fast so I could get it all in.

This was a great way to use up chard. I would make it again. I think maybe next time I would look into adding garlic or some other spice.

I used rainbow chard and made a couple of minor modifications to the recipe. I diced the stems of the chard and cooked them with the onion. I also stirred in a tablespoon of butter at the end with the cheese. Served as a side dish with a beef tenderloin roast with a Creole spice rub. The dish was visually appealing and delicious.

This recipe needed something more, it was a little unexciting. I also felt like the chard got overcooked. Next time I might add some of the chard stems at the beginning and then save the leaved to add near the end.

I used Rainbow Swiss Chard. Made the recipe exactly as written. It was very tasty, but subtle. An easy risotto. Good way to use up all the greens from the CSA.

I have never made a risotto before and I found this very easy to make and was very pleased with the results. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and was very pleased.

This recipe was OK. It didn't have any distinctive flavor that really set it apart from other risottos. If you are interested in a great risotto, make the yellow pepper risotto on epicurious. That is a wonderful recipe.

Made this for tonight's main course... I was a bit doubtful, I was worried it would be bland, but it turned out really well. I used white chard, added 2 cloves of coarsely chopped garlic and a bit of freshly ground white pepper, and used homemade chicken stock. I also added a knob of butter at the end with the cheese. Really yummy. Have made lots of risotto and tried many different recipes... this one ties for first place. A german Mosel Riesling was a great pairing. Dinner tonight: success! :)

This was a full proof risotto that everyone enjoyed. My vegetarian son loved it. I substatuted the chicken broth with a veggie. Great Flavor

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it turned out okay. I really do appreciate the short list of ingredients (all were on-hand except for the chard) and found the recipe really easy to pull together. Overall, though, I thought it was good but not great. I think leeks, as suggested by a previous reviewer, would help nudge the recipe toward three forks. I will try again with this one.

Terrific and easy. I used all chicken broth (no wine) - about 4 cups. I added the broth more gradually than directed (not most all at once), and it was great. I also added about 3/4 cups mushrooms, sliced, which I sauteed with the onions. I imagine you could adapt it to a variety of additions. A good way to sneak in those greens like chard.

So simple and so delicious! I followed the recipe without deviation, except that I used chopped and cleaned mixed chard from Trader Joe's. Stirring risotto is therapeutic, eating it is heavenly!

I combined this with the radicchio risotto recipe, to an excellent result. I did the gradual addition of the broth, used red wine, and added leeks with the onion. Absolutely fantastic.

I rarely cook, and more than once I've spent a lot of time in the kitchen only to end up with something bland and disappointing. This was very easy to make, and really tasty. I used arborio rice, which cooked up nice and creamy.

If you were ever intimidated of making risotto, this recipe is for you! It is super easy and so good. A couple of minor changes I made. First, I used vegetable broth, about 5 1/2 cups rather than 5 and I used a mixture of red and white chard and it was great. Enjoy!

It was a good combination, but adding in all the liquid at once didnt work for me--I ended uphaving to add lots more liquid slowly so that the whole dish took longer than it should have. It needs a lot of salt.

This is a great risotto to serve with seafood. I replaced the chicken stock with fish stock in the preparation, and then served it with muscles, clams and prawns. A very simple risotto.

This dish is eay and doesn't take alot of preparation. The red chard taste doesn't stand out in this dish so I suggest an additional cup.

Very simple and delicious. I was skeptical about putting most of the water in right at first, as I was taught to make risotto by adding little bits of water at a time and stirring like crazy. This recipe worked out just fine as written, although I used a vegetable stock rather than chicken stock.
