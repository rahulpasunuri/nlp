I liked this, but be aware that not all fish sauce is created equal. We had some Filipino fish sauce and two tablespoons of that turned out to be very salty. The Thai stuff may be less salty. Be prepared to cut the fish sauce back to one tablespoon or even one teaspoon.

I made this recipe as written - it didn't blow me away, but it is a nice side dish.

I liked this dish quite a bit -- it was super easy and fast to make, and packed a fair amount of flavor. I skipped the onion because I didn't have any and substituted red pepper flakes for the dried red chiles, and it worked fine by my standards. This makes a nice side dish! I would make it again.

Gentle flavors but very well balanced against the broccolini - I will make this again for sure.

Awesome recipe!!! The flavors are amazing and very easy to make. I halved the quantity but kicked up the spice.

I think the flavors are too one- dimensional. Mostly just a hot, slightly fishy flavor in my opinion.
