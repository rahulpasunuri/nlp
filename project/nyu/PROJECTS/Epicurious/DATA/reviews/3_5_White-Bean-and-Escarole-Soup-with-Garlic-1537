I make this in the slow cooker and add a pinch of red pepper flakes for a little more flavor, and it is delicious!

I agree with everyone who said that the basic recipe is a little bland, but adding parmesan cheese when the soup was served solved the problem. It was delicious and hearty! Next time, I may use a broth made from beef bones.

Made this today on our first REAL snow day of winter. Had some baby bok choy so I used that and it came out so lovely and creamy. Also, had yellow eye beans that I cooked first, and flash-frozen roasted tomatoes from this summer's harvest. Yum!

Very nice recipe. I also added the juice of 2 lemons to give it a bit more flavor. As other reviewers suggested, I also added a Parmesean rind and doubled the garlic. I love escarole so I used 2 whole heads of escarole -- it shrinks down a lot and thickens it to more of stew-like texture. Served with some polenta croutons and it was a delicious meal!

So quick and delicious! This is a one-pot recipe that I wish I had tried earlier. I used Swiss chard instead of escarole to add more nutrition and added a dash of cayenne pepper. The pepper made the soup taste even better. So, so tasty!! I'm gonna serve leftovers over quinoa. Have fun with this recipe and you'll love the end result!

This is so simple, and with several of the suggestions from earlier reviewers, it really is exceptional - because of the ease of making it. I added the cheese rind and celery as suggested, and upped the garlic a bit (and kept it in the soup).

This is a good basic soup and with a few tweaks, it can become fantastic. I like how simple it is and the flavors of the beans & tomatoes and greens aren't hidden with too much spice/herbs. I have tried it a few times and find that if I use collards, it's delicious (couldn't find escarole, and kale was too mushy). Adding the parm rind is a wonderful idea and I agree with another review about leaving the garlic in (why take it out?). I also use a good quality vegetable broth (Kitchen Basics) and add more than 4 cups, maybe 6. I love this when I'm feeling like being "vegetarian-for-a-day"!

Forgot to say that I also followed reviewers and put some cheese rind in. Have used thick slices of cheese (not just a rind) and its great. Made it without the cheese when I was not at home, and it still earns kudos...

This was SO good, exceeded my best expectations! My vegetarian daughter and I could NOT get enough of this! I have a bag of leftover escarole lettuce and I plan a repeat this week SOOOOOO good! I did, of course, leave the garlic in, and I had it very thinly sliced. This is for sure a keeper, it reminds me of my old Tuscan vacations...

This is one of my favorite soups. By all means cook the soup with the rind of reggiano parmigiana cheese wrapped in cheesecloth. The flavor it adds is fabulous. And I definitely leave the garlic in. It mellows beautifully after cooking. Enjoy!

yummy soup. added celery with the carrots, onions and garlic. left garlic in...why would you ever take garlic out of a dish!?!? Soup is hearty, homey and healthy!!!

I'd probably give it about 3.5 stars as-is, but with a few added touches, this was really 4-star delicious, tons of flavor. I added a stalk of celery, a pinch of red pepper flakes, and a bit of crushed fennel seed and rosemary at the beginning with the sautéed vegetables. I also left in the garlic as was suggested. Towards the end of cooking, I threw in a Parmesan rind. Yum.

Great soup! I did make a few changes. Added parmesan turkey meatballs from another escarole soup on this website. I also added two stalks of celery and minced the garlic and left it in the soup. finally I added a small rind of parmesan cheese while it was cooking. delicious.

Rating: 1
I made this tonight - with Kale - and thought it was totally boring. Reminded me of soups I used to make in college. Definitely needs more spicing to make it more interesting. If I were to make it again, I'd probably use dried red pepper to spice it up a bit, bay leaves, and some fresh herbs. Meat would help too. And maybe mashing up the beans. But seriously - why not just make a different soup all together? Pass.

Rating: 3
This is a yummy soup, but some extra tweaking made the recipe 4-star worthy. Tweaking included: 1) made my own beans instead of using canned; 2) based on previous reviews, added a chunky parm rind; 3) pureed, then added, an extra cup of beans to make the broth really hearty; 4) since we made this a few days after Thanksgiving, we added some leftover turkey as well - the soup would have been terrific without the turkey, but it was pretty darn delicious in the soup. Definitely will made this one again, and may tweak it completely differently next time!

One of the best soups I have ever made. I made it using homemade vegetable broth and dried beans and made a HUGE pot for 6 girls to snack on all weekend. very yummy

I have made this soup several times, but the last time I minced the garlic and left it in the soup. Why did I not do that before? My husband, who merely tolerated the soup before, because it's healthy, actually enjoyed it, and my son, who loves practically everything... well, he still loves it.

Rating: 4
absolutely loved this soup. I did use arugula as I couldn't find escarole. I chopped a clove of garlic to saute and frankly left the cloves in the soup instead of taking them out as instructed. I think that throwing out garlic is some kind of sin :). I did have to add extra broth. One of the best soup recipes ever. Hardy, simple, delicious. Tastes like something your grandmother made. This one's a keeper.

Rating: 3
Mmm, this soup was delicious. I made my own vegetable stock by simmering onions, garlic, carrots, celery, and potatoes, and I used Muir Glen fire-roasted tomatoes. I also added some Parmesan rind to my broth. The grocery store had no escarole, so I used kale and it was wonderful. I strongly recommend this recipe -- it's easy, delicious, and healthful. What more could you want?

did not have escarole so made it with savoy cabbage and it was still very very good. Parm. Cheese really makes it.

This is our favorite soup. We usually add a pinch of red pepper flakes and a bit of browned, drained sausage - Make sure to simmer a good 60 min to blend the flavors. You can substitute any green for the escarole. SO GOOD!

Delightful soup that is both simple to make and rewarding. I substituted spinach for escarole (surely other greens would do as well, like Swiss chard), and made the beans from scratch.

I made this with homemade chicken stock and less tomato than called for. Served with a sprinkle of good parmesan, this was a DELICIOUS, healthy dinner.

Rating: 3
Very quick, easy, healthy, and tasty. Of course a recipe with canned vegetables and canned broth won't compare to one with homemade stock and beans, but given the ease of preparation this is a winner. I do crush 3 cloves of garlic, sometimes add celery with the onion and carrot, and added thyme this time as well. I usually add a parmesan rind along with the beans for flavor.

Rating: 3
Quick, easy and a big hit. I'm not usually much of a veg. soup fan, but I loved this. As recommended, I left the garlic in and added a couple of bay leaves. We're trying to cut down on fat, so I didn't add the suggested sausage or ham, but did add a cpl.. extra cups of broth and a half- bag of whole wheat pasta. I will *definitely* make this again!

Rating: 3
An excellent soup, do keep the garlic in, do add a bay leaf. I made this recipe with smoked ham shanks. Cook the ham shanks (4)for about 45 minutes and save the cooking liquid. Cool it, skim off the fat and substitute the chicken broth with this, it will make a world of difference. If you need more liquid, you can add some chicken stock. Now, it's a really delishious soup!!!!

Rating: 3
If you want a more creamy texture without adding dairy, try removing some of the beans and pureeing them. (Don't get the escarole, though--it turns the soup an odd green color if it's pureed and added back in.)

Rating: 2
I was trying to re-create a Chicken Escarole soup from a restaurant in SoHo... this wasn't quite it but it was alright. I added more garlic and used canned beans. The restaurant version had a creaminess (non-dairy) that I can't quite figure out. Any suggestions?

This recipe was kinda bland....I added parm while I was cooking it to increase the flavor....I'll make it again because it's healthy and sometimes I like a lighter soup....I think it could be enhanced with some zuchini and some pasta and a dash of hot sauce.

You can improve this good recipe immensely by substituting crumbled (large pieces) of Italian sausage - brained and well drained. Also add 1/2 to 1 cup of chopped fresh anise (fennel) and cook with the onions etc. Adds great flavor dimensions!

Zero forks. Take heed and do NOT make this soup. If you scroll down the ratings, you will see one that says "blech". Our sentiments precisely. Easy to make, perfectly bland (dare I say almost inedible?) soup. I am afraid I was carried away by the stellar ratings instead of using my commone sense whilst assessing the recipe. I used top notch ingredients, virtually all organic. But the canned toms and canned beans should have been a giveaway. Open up a can of soup and save yourself the bother. Please, please don't waste your time.

Rating: 3
Really delicious! I used the previous cook's recipe (just substituting parsnips for carrots). This is also a great dish for leftover Thanksgiving ingredients. I add celery in with the veggies, some shredded turkey while simmering, and herbed croutons and fresh parsley on top.

Rating: 3
surprisingly delicious! I integrated the previous suggestions into the following changes; kept garlic in broth, added sprig of fresh rosemary and 1 bay leaf in the oil and left in soup, added 1 small turnip chopped fairly fine, put one can of beans in w/ liquid, one drained, added a dash of chili flakes and a bit of white wine, and used chicken better than bouillon instead of broth. (great space saver for small kitchens) a perfect fall soup!

Rating: 4
Very fast, very easy, very healthy, and very good. I added small sprigs of fresh sage and rosemary at the beginning to flavor the olive oil. I also kept the garlic and tossed in some small pasta shells near the end. By the way, adding the rind of Parmigiano Reggiano is a great secret ingredient that really adds something special to most soups. The VERY best thing you can do to this soup, however, is when it's warm and steaming in individual bowls: DRIZZLE IT WITH GOOD QUALITY EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL. Raw olive oil is a circus full of good things for your body, and it also brings the taste and feel of this soup to a whole new level. Loved it.

Rating: 1
This didn't impress us at all! Basically it tasted like escarole in chicken broth. I used extra garlic and chicken broth for most of the liquid and still it was one of the most boring soups I've ever made. I even used freshly grated Asiago cheese and none of my family members were impressed. Definitely won't make this again. Blech.

Rating: 3
I made this soup last night with some very good dried beans from Sicily and it made a huge difference. Just soak the beans the night before, then cook and continue the recipe as for canned beans. The entire family loved it. I also added fresh sage and two bay leaves when sauteeing the vegetables, and did not remove the garlic.

Didn't see escarole in the Safeway. Used a 1LB bag of frozen kale and 8 cups of veggie broth. Very easy soup to make. Threw in some italian seasoning based on other users' recommendations. But still could use something else...not sure what. Definitely loaded up the parmesan cheese on top. Feels very healthy and satisfying.

This soup turned out great. I guess I'm a tough rater, since I'd definitely make it again and I love it, but four forks is defined as "a dish beyond compare," which is a pretty high standard. I'll admit, I didn't make the recipe as written - and I often wonder about some of the comments that seem to be about totally different recipes, but stick with me. Since many of the reviewers had made substitutions for the escarole, I felt free to do so as well. I found this soup because of a soup I had for lunch at work this week which was white bean, tomato and broccoli rabe. So I substituted a whole bunch of chopped (in the food processor) broccoli rabe for the escarole. Chopped whatever baby carrots were on hand and a whole onion in the food processor - sauted them in more than 1T olive oil. Added the broccoli rabe and a few pinches of red pepper flakes. Minced the garlic as others had suggested and added it in toward the end. A full 28 oz box of Pomi chopped tomatoes (I prefer that brad since they're no salt added and it's sometimes hard to find in other brands.) Finally, used a 40 oz box of low salt/fat chicken broth (and might have been able to use another cup or 2 and a third can of beans. I also through in a bay leaf, a thyme spring and a few parsley sprigs which I'll pull out for serving. With the base recipe, everyone's comments and the changes I through in, I thought it might be a disaster, but it was absolutely delicious. Took a little more simmering, but I probably have soupr for 6 to 8 rather than 4, so that makes sense. Go wild. Try it. P.S. - I love the idea of the parmesan rind, just didn't have one.

i wouldn't call this soup fantastic, but it was fast and easy to make. the only change i made was to leave the garlic in and add a bit of oregeno and thyme. it was pretty boring, it didn't have anything that jumped out at us as a great flavor.

Delicious, beautiful and easy! I did follows some reviews and 1)left the garlic in, 2) put the beans in with their juice and 3) added little mini egg bow tie pasta (cooked it first, then threw it in at the end). This will became a staple in my house. Now the question is, does it freeze well?

Outstanding. The only change I made was to leave the garlic cloves in the soup, and to chop the carrots coarsely in the food processor instead of dicing. Definitely a keeper.

I've made this soup several times with kale from the garden. After the first time, I doubled the recipe and made it for a pumpkin carving party. Needless to say, it was a hit. This soup is amazing the first day and even better the second. I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. Instead of canned broth I used powdered, I used baby carrots in place of one large, and I didn't bother with the parm cheese. I'm making it again tonight. It is the perfect Fall/Winter soup.

Delicious! I made a couple of changes: mince garlic and leave it in the soup, add a celery stalk, keep the juices of the tomatoes in the soup and add a parmesan rind to the soup as a great flavor and thickener! I substituted kale for the escarole because the texture really held up as apposed to the escarole wilting right away. A great soup!

The soup was delicious. The perfect meal for a cold winter night. I followed the rceipe pretty closely except I added some fresh chopped tomatoes, red pepper flakes, and some tomato paste to the soup. It probably didn't need the additions, but the tomatoes would have gone bad if I hadn't used them. Serve with some crusty bread.

This was a really nice soup to come home and make on a cold day. I would give it 4 forks, but I only loved it after I made some of the recommended changes, and a few of my own - I thickened it up with some baby bow tie pasta (about 2/3 cup), added an extra carrot, one celery stalk, about half a turnip, and a dash of crushed red pepper flakes just to give it a little pizzazz. I also did not drain the beans - I used two cans of cannellinis. We ate it with some foccaccia bread and it was very filling and robust. Would def. make it again, but I recommend tweaking it if you want a really hearty soup.

I loved this soup! I did add a half of a link of andouille (smoked meaty cajun sausage),chopped. It gave it a nice smoky depth. I left the garlic in but chopped it. I didn't have escarole but I added chopped collard greens. They hold up well in soup. I forgot to drain the tomatoes but it still came out delicious. I would definitely recommend a good aged Parmesan to add to each bowl! So quick, easy and wonderful homemade, cooked all day taste!

All the reviewers are correct; the recipe is great but needs doctoring. I used the entire head of escarole, chopped in the food processor. I used the processor for chopping onion, garlic and carrots as well so prep was easy. I found the soup needed lots of xtra spicing: lemon juice, rosemary, oregano, thyme - but that was easy and made the soup delicious. Everyone enjoyed it with a little grated parmesan, a chopped mediterranean salad, and a crusty bread.

This soup is so amazing I can't even stand it!!! Here are my tips, chop and keep in the garlic, add basil and oregano with the onions and carrots and add 1/2 C small shaped pasta, also, feel free to use any kind of small bean, I've used navy and black-eyed peas and it's been great!!!!! Also, I used 6 C veggie broth, super low fat!!

I am addicted to this soup!!! I do add: 1 cup of acini pasta, 4 cans of chicken broth (because of the added pasta), I keep the garlic in, I also add salt, pepper, oregano, basil and a couple of bay leaves, and I like to chop the escarole in very small pieces.

This soup was really delicious and quick to make. I only made a few changes. I chopped the garlic, mixed some of the bean cooking liquid with chicken stock, used a fresh tomato (somehow left over from my garden) and took other's advice and added italian seasoning and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes. Oh, and I couldn't resist a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. You won't be disappointed!

Fabulous soup! I used only one can of cannelini beans and 6 cups of chicken stock. I too, added the basil, oregano, rosemary and thyme and 1/2 C. of elbow macaroni. Added a can of niblets and their water as well to make it more appetizing to the kids. Everyone lapped it up!

Great soup - delicious and easy! I pressed 3 cloves of garlic and sauteed them with the onions and carrots (didn't bother with smashing and removing). I used spinach in place of escarole, 3 cans of beans, and pureed a bit with the hand blender (everything else according to recipe.) Served with tomato-rosemary bread and salad. Even my picky kids liked it.

Can't agree with other positive reviews more! This is truly outstanding. And easy, lowfat, cheap. I used dried beans, rather than canned, but I doubt it made any difference. Do leave the garlic in the soup. Consider adding some thyme, parsley and bay leaf, fresh or in a bouquet garni, while the vegies are cooking. Take these spices out just before serving. The flavor of the spices gets into the soup without overpowering it. Consider also using a bit of gremolata on the side (lemon,garlic, parsley mix -- can find recipe on this site, traditional addition to white beans with lamb shanks.) This soup is truly a wonderful thing. Even in Arizona in the middle of summer (108 degrees).

This dish was a result of a I Need Dinner Fast and I have only the pantry to find it. I made half the recipe, and it made four generous portions (served with a green salad and Garlic Bread). I used cannellini beans, a package of frozen spinach (I was desperate), minced the garlic, added few pinches of crushed red pepper, and a few springs of rosemary and sage from my garden. The dish was filling and delicous, my boyfriend (the vegetable and legume hater) loved it!

Thanks to the reviews I didn't miss out on this great recipe. 10 min of prep work and you have a pot of peasanty Italian grandma soup that looks and tastes like you've slaved over the proverbial hot stove all day.
