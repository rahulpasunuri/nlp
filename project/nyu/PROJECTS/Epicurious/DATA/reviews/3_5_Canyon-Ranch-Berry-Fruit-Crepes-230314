I made the filling but used a Martha Stewart crepe recipe. Just like the other reviewers have noted, the filing has a grainy texture that's a bit of a turn off. I ran it through the food processor which made it much better. Next time I'll mix it right in the food processor.

Loved this recipe. I followed it exactly except I used whole wheat pastry flour. Didn't need the tbl of oil for the pan, just a little cooking spray. In addition to the berry/ricotta mixture I tried one with nutella and bananas. Excellent.

I made these for dessert last night, and had them for breakfast, too. I cut down on the saturated fat by using egg substitute, and it worked just fine. I also used whole wheat pastry flour, 1% milk, and let the crepe batter sit out for an hour before making them (I don't know if this made a difference, it's just what the other recipes I've used have called for). Taking note of the "grainy" texture described by others, I ran the filling (which I made with cottage cheese) through the food processor. This is a wonderful, delicious recipe, that I will use many times during the upcoming strawberry season! (Since I made some changes to the original recipe, I tried not to give it a "fork" rating, but my computer skills aren't up to the task!)

Fantastic crepes. I used 3.25 milk. Worked like a charm. For topping i chopped up a peach and tossed it with yogurt a touch of sugar and some cherry preserves I had in the fridge. Great escape from a horrid day at the office.

Very delicious and an easy, healthy weekday breakfast. Made the batter the night before and let it warm while the coffee brewed and the skillet heated. I used cottage cheese (blended) as suggested since I can never use up ricotta before it goes bad. Had fresh raspberries but I look forward to trying other fruits. Num!

Meh, this was just OK. The crepes came out perfectly, but the filling was odd combination of flavors and the texture was a bit grainy like the other reviewer mentioned. I'd make the crepes again, but definitely find a different filling.

This is one of the first whole-wheat crepe recipes I've found. We liked these because the crepe was tender and the filling was just enough. Perfect for 2 when halved as suggested by another rater.

Easy and excellent. They do stick more than normal crepes.

I cut this recipe in half for two of us and made these changes: added two large spoonfuls of crepe batter and threw out the first one which always overly absorbs the oil, used 2% fat cottage cheese (buzz it if you don't like the curd look), used honey where noted,used the three berries listed and bananas and mangoes, and topped with lots of powdered sugar. Voila, a lovely Sunday brunch.

I thought this was an exceptional recipe - all the flavors in the ricotta filling complimented each other (the cinnamon,lemon & sugar). It takes some time to cook the crepes but they were well worth it. The crepes stuck to the pan a bit, so I had to use the non-stick spray each time I made a crepe.

So delicious - I substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta, and it was fantastic. Even my boyfriend, who hates all things dairy, loved it! I've made them several times and they always turn out perfectly.

I used 1/4 cup of batter and held to hold the pan off the burner to make sure that it didn't start cooking right away. The ricotta filling was a bit grainy but other than that they were easy to make and pretty yummy and healthy.

I made these crepes for breakfast this morning and they are soooo delicious! I used the honey instead of confectioner's sugar in the ricotta filling to make it healthier, and frozen berries since berries aren't in season here. As the person below said, the batter starts cooking as soon as you spoon it in the pan, so instead of lowering the heat, I would hold the pan off of the burner as you spoon, tilt it to cover, then set it back on the burner.

I just got done making these. The whole wheat crepes were great. This was my first time making crepes and they were easy and came out tasting great. (I didn't tell my husband they were whole wheat and he LOVED them!). But, neither of us liked the ricotta cheese filling. we found it quite grainy quite grainy.

I can't stop making these! They're so easy and so fabulous! I've started to use nonfat ricotta, and they come out just as good with even less guilt. The crepes are great in general - I've used the recipe for savory crepes in addition to these. Very tastey!

I thought the consistency was perfect, but it was not as thick as pancake batter, but for crepes you don't want it that thick. The flavor was okay. Very easy to make!

My batter was not as runny as I expected and I had to tinker with it a bit.

I made this recipe for my mom on her birthday, and she LOVED it! She has been to canyon ranch many times and she told me that it tasted just like the crepes served there. Fabulous. The only problem was that once the batter was spooned into the pan, it startedcooking right away and there was no time to let it spread around the pan, so I guess next time I will cook it ona lower temp, otherwize, they were fruity and delightful!

ob so yummy! regular sugar can be used but the texture wont be as smooth. use with "marilyn's manicotti" as a way to effectly use all of your ricotta cheese.
