An average tomato bruschetta recipe. There are better ones.

Easy there. Calm down. You guys are pretty harsh on GA. This is a place to express your opinions, ask questions and perhaps add a bit of insight. Why can't we all just get along. Oh, by the way, I used a microplane to add a bit of good cheese on top before serving...yummy.

Do they not serve bruscetta in Suwanee, GA? Of course the toppings fall off! Add bread crumbs? Puree the toppings? Who are you people?

Good recipe. i love fennel. The "hair" as we call it is better for a garnish than an ingredient, especially to those for whom fennel may be new... To keep it on the bread: few possibilities... mix in plain bread crumbs to give the veggies a "base" and use it more as a chunky spread, or, emulsify a third of the tomatoes alone or with some oil and herbs in a processor, then toss with remaining diced tomatoes,fennel for a "salsa" effect. If nothing else, buy some good oiled bread, slice it 3/4" thick and press a spoon in the whites to form a "cup." Toast the cups and you have a little seat for a mound of bruschetta that will stay put.

A GREAT WAY TO USE UP FENNEL; I USED TOASTED FRENCH BAGUETTE SLICES WHICH MADE IT JUST THE RIGHT SIZE. EVEN THOUGH THE FILLING TENDED TO FALL WE OFF SCOOPED IT UP AND ATE IT ALL

This is a really good recipie. I would definaly make it again, no question. For those of you that said it fell of.. that's what almost all Bruschetta does.. hello. Get a freakin' life and stop complaining, if it's really all that freakin' horrible that you can't spend a little extra time to put it back on.. than that's pretty sad. just don't make it again.. no one's stopping you from not making it.. get a life losers!

Well, bruschetta is just that way....the toppings tend to fall off. There is really nothing that can be done to stop it altogether, but it may be easier to keep more of the topping on the bread if you serve the toasted bread ALONGSIDE it. If you put the topping in the middle of a plate and scoop it up with the bread, then it is more likely to stay on the bread. it's just hard to keep a whole lot of stuff on a large piece of bread. So-- my suggestion is to make the topping and to place that in the center of the plate, using the bread as an edible utensil.

I liked the fresh flavor of this recipe, but I found it impossible to eat it without the mixture falling off the bread before I could get it into my mouth! This makes me not want to repeat the recipe. Perhaps somebody has a solution to make the mixture stay on the bread?

Wonderful, very different foil for garlicky Italian dishes. The fennel adds a freshness to the tomatoes that is really neet. Very light, easy to prepare. I might add a little dried mint next time, just to enhance the fennel flavor. Didn't use the tops, though; looked funny, and smelled worse.

I really liked the licorice flavor the fennel imparts. I like to mix the ingredients and let them blend for awhile before spreading on the toasted bread. This is a good recipe.
