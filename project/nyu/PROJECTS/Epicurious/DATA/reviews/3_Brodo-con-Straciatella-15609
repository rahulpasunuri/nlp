Great simple recipe but encourage all cooks to omit the flour. I've made it with and without. With flour tends to end up a clumpy soup; not pretty. Without flour ends up with egg strings just as you'd expect. Otherwise, if you've already made your stock this is a really quick and flavorful soup,

Just drop the egg mixture in and give it a quick stir. I added 4oz. of oyster mushrooms and served it with crostini. Everyone loved it. I will definitely make it again.

A simple chicken, beef or vegetable broth to which some small noodles are added can be easily converted into a straciatella soup. Once the noodles are cooked, pour in beaten egg(s) slowly whisking slightly. There is no need to use a colander to pour the egg.

Delicious and easy to make.

Don't know where the others went wrong but I was happy with the results. I just used a chicken cube to make the broth, added the thinly sliced spinach leaves to cook for 2 min. and stirred in the egg-parmesan cheese mixture. Omitted the seasonings and flour. Very good. Your broth has to be tasty to start with and don't use too much spinach. I only used 2 handfuls.

I was hoping this recipe would be bring back memories of grandma's soup. No dice...a bit too bland, but I think the fault lies in the broth. If your broth has a strong flavor, the soup will be very good. As far as pouring the egg mixture through a colander--faggetaboutit!! Mine clogged up faster than you can say, "Mamma mia, what a mess!" Next time, I'll stream it into the broth while whisking feverishly. That should do the trick.

My fiance loved this soup. It is very easy to make and tasty. I think this soup is better with the chicken stock. I've made the garlic soup and I love it but not for this dish.

This recipe was terrible. I attempted to make it for some friends, and I ended up getting extremely embarassed. I followed the directions very closely....I just can't figure out what went wrong. It wasn't tasty or substantial. Maybe there is something that I did wrong while preparing the garlic broth....oh well, I hope that others have better luck.
