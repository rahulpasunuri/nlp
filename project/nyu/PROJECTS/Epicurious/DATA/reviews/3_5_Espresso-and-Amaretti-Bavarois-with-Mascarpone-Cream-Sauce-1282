Make sure not to over-crush the amaretti. "Crumbled, not crushed" would have been better. I think I over-crushed and did not end up with the best result. Also, this does NOT make eight portions. 5 max.

This is a rich and wonderful dessert, but may be difficult for the novice cook. I would definitely recommend making this recipe if you wish to impress your dinner guests (and yourself!).
