Served the salsa with the Pork Tenderloin Churrasco. I did find the Aji Amarillo paste at a local Latin market. This was a great salsa and I strongly dislike all bell peppers, but had no problem with the yellow bell pepper in this salsa. So good and easy.

I have never been able to find the aji amarillo paste (and I've made this many times), but it is still very good without it. I've tried it with pork, but I prefer it with chicken fajitas. Very good!!

I've made this salsa twice. And it is beautiful. So colorful. And yet, no one ever seems to go for it. They just pick out the pineapple pieces. In reality, this salsa is too spicy and has too many ingredients. It's also very pungent. The cilantro and raw onion make this smell like dirty dish water. I believe toned down this salsa would be a keeper; as some of the flavors do go well with "pork tenderloin churrasco". Next time, I want to omit the cilantro and chilies and only use one type of onion.

Wonderful salsa. Goes so well with the pork tenderloin. I could not find Aji Amarillo paste, so I used tomato paste which I flavored with Ancho pepper spice. I pureed about a quarter of the salsa, and instead of red jalopenos I used green (again, could not find). I wasn't sure how it would turn out with the substitutions, but I'm so glad I tried it because it was just great and very easy.

I am allergic to pineapple so I substituted mango. Wonderful! The sweet and the pungent together are such a compliment to savory meats like pork. I'm sure it would be a 4 forker with the use of pineapple!

Yummy. It really does go great with the Pork Tenderloin. Try it!

Exactly! Don't reward such people & their rude behavior by even acknowledging that they are present or exist! Once they realize that they are not getting the attention they want, they slink away to find another hole.

wow! what a great spicy salsa. this is definitely a keeper. i found the aji-amarillo paste at a local latin grocery store. it was in the peruvian section. it's in a jar. i also only used one Tbsp of finely chopped jalapeno pepper. it was the perfect degree of hotness. i think two Tbsp. would have been too hot.
