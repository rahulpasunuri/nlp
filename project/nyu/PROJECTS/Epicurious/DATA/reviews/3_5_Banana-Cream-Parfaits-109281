This really is very yummy and quite easy to make. I could not find creme fraiche so made a mixture of cream, yoghurt and creme cheese, worked out well enough. Biscuits are a must!!

I made this about a year ago and everyone is still talking about it! The cookies are wonderful too.

First of all, this is very, very good. However, the recipe states to simmer until liquid is reduced to 1 1/3 cups, about 15 minutes. Maybe the recipe takes simmer to mean a full rolling-boil but I simmered my liquid for nearly an hour until it was reduced completely and it would have been the perfect consistency had we eaten hot (like pudding). But the next day, when it was cool, the liquid was as thick as bread dough (but still yummy). So I would suggest to really only simmer for 15 minutes (maybe 30) and not worry about the actual measurement of the liquid. Also, the creme fraiche really brings all the flavors together, don't be tempted to substitute whipped cream.

I make a very much easier version of this.. All I do is cut the ripe bananas put them in a bowl with a bit of lemon juice to prevent browning..I also add a bit of cuban rum to bring out the flavour of the bananas... then I just puree the bananas with the sugar syrup, the cream and vanilla, and churn it in an icecream maker.. come out perfect

This was a fabulous dessert! Simple to make; the shortbread cookies were wonderful (hard to save for the actual dessert). Fabulous flavours! Can't wait to eat it again!

This is an excellent dessert, but very rich. I made it to follow a light meal with a main dish salad (lobster,pink grapefruit and avocado salad from this site.) The coconut shortbread cookies (and the creme fraiche) are essential to the overall decadence of the dish. I don't care much for bananas but even I loved this dessert!
