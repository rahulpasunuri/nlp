Very tasty and very pretty. But double the chocolate on the cake and half the vanilla extract on the frosting.

By using 2 c of powdered sugar instead of 2.5 cups, I avoided the excessive sweetness of most cream cheese icings. I also had only 8", not 9" cake pans, and baked it for 32 minutes. I cut each of the cakes into an additional layer for a 4-layer New Year's Eve dessert that was a big hit.

LOVE this cake. Red Velvet has always been my favorite and this recipes is great. The only variations for me: remove the berries and add chopped pecans to the frosting. It was otherwise perfect for me. Very moist.

I used this recipe for the cake and frosting part of it and skipped the berries. Te cake wasn't very moist despite having added an extra splash of buttermilk. I'm sure the berries would have helped in giving it a juicer taste so I can't really say I wouldn't make this again. On the other hand, the frosting was very delicious and I will use the recipe for it again.

This turned out wonderfully delicious! I made cupcakes and topped it with raspberries & blueberries. I followed the suggestions for adding 2 T more of cocoa, 1/3 C more of buttermilk and 1 T instead of 1 tsp of vanilla extract. I didn't have enough red food coloring but it still turned out great. My family & friends loved it!!!

Delicious! I, too, substituted some of the buttermilk with oil and upped the cocoa powder. The cake was moist and cohesive. I iced it with chocolate ganache, which complimented it quite nicely.

I've made this recipe twice now (once as a layer cake and once as cupcakes). The fresh berries and frosting really make it sing. The cake itself isn't all that flavorful and the crumb is a little bit dry. I suppose a couple of simple tweaks could fix that pretty easily. But, a cake that's a little on the dry side (and I really do mean a little) can always be remedied by adding a little more delicious frosting and berries!

I made these--followed the recipe exactly (made them into cupcakes instead) and wasn't happy with them. My guests enjoyed them but I am a homemade dessert snob and thought the cake was slightly dry and the icing could have used more vanilla or something...maybe some lemon zest? I also cooked them for only 20 minutes and they were slightly overcooked. I have had box-made versions that came out much better than these, which is sad because I swear by making things from scratch. I'll be on the look out for a better recipe!

Definitely a keeper! Have made this three times all with much success! I followed MonneyD's recomm., that being: -4 tbsp cocoa -3 tbsp red food colouring -1 tbsp vanilla essence -1/4 cup veg oil (mix into egg mixture with wet ingr.) -1 1/3 cup butter milk. Only had low fat buttermilk on hand so I also added a couple tbsp of sour cream. Made for a wonderful treat! Happy baking!

This cake was a huge hit with my family. However, two layers were not enough. I made three by adding another half-recipe (cake and icing). And unless you are going to serve/eat the entire cake in one day, I would just put the berries on the side. I didn't make any changes or additions to the recipe and it was moist and delicious. The icing was also fantastic.

Delicious Cake! However, I did not have raspberries, so I used blueberries and blackberries. It tasted great, but next time I will leave out the fruit. That is my preference.

I was really disappointed in this recipe. Red velvet cake is supposed to be a chocolate cake and I went with the recipe because it had 3 1/2 forks without paying attention to the fact that the only chocolate in the whole thing was 2 T. of cocoa powder. I did add the extra 1/2 C of buttermilk so it was definitely moist, but it didn't have much flavor. it did taste a little better a day later, but when a 16 year old boy doesn't want any in his lunch the next day I think that says everything. Next time I think I'll go with a guaranteed great chocolate cake like the Barefoot Contessa's ' Beatty's chocolate cake' and add red food coloring then simply make a cream cheese icing. This icing was good, but I would like to try the icing that has marscapone cheese in it that got rave reviews that goes with red velvet cupcakes. Finally, as soon as I flipped the cakes out of the pans, I realized that they didn't have much flavor so on 1/2 of the cake I added raspberry jam in addition to the cream cheese icing for the middle layer as someone had suggested and that was the one redeeming feature of the cake along with the moistness.

Rating: 4
Would like to thank all the helpful reviewers! Used some tips from the reviews, summary of changes being: 4 tbsp cocoa, 3 tbsp red food coloring, 1 tbsp vanilla, added 1/4 cup veg. oil, 1 1/3 cup buttermilk to cake recipe. Reduced powdered sugar in icing to 1 1/2 cups, and made it a winter cake by roasting pecans with butter and topping the cake with them. Cake was moist, nuts were crunchy - birthday guests were thrilled.

I have tried many different recipes for RVC and I like this one the best. After making the cake exactly as written, I made it again adding 1/4 cup of whole milk yogurt (Fage brand), in addition to the buttermilk, as others have suggested. It definitely improves the recipe by adding moistness. The berries also make it moist and delicious. The cream cheese frosting it just right. You don't end up with so much left over as with some recipes. You don't need so much frosting between layers because of the addition of berries.

Rating: 4
I wasn't sure how I was going to like this. A friend at work suggested it. I had never tried it before or even had it to eat. But I have to say it's quite a bit better than I expected. The chocolate flavor does come through along with the slight buttermilk. I do like this and would probably make it again.

Used vanilla bean paste instead of extract & loved how it came out in the frosting. Topped w/ Trader Joes chocolate pearls. I had extra icing & would probably put more in the center next time. Used 1/4 more butter but next time might try 1/2 a stick more b/c it was a bit dry. Used extra coco as well. Refrigerated well overnight. Amazing overall!

Rating: 4
I really liked this base recipe but I would follow all of MooneyD's tips, otherwise I probably would have ended up with a brownish cake that lacked flavor. It came out very moist with the alterations that MooneyD suggested. As far as the icing I used one bar of cream cheese and upped the powdered sugar to almost 2 cups of sifted powdered sugar for that one bar. I also added about a 1/2 tsp of vanilla because I increased the powdered sugar so much. With these alterations, the cake was fantastic!

I have made this cake on many occasions as directed in the recipe..no substituions/deviations. It is the best red velvet cake ever...moist and delicate without any bitterness..which I have found with other red velvet cakes. Yummy!

I loved the presentation of this cake and the fruit in between the layers was amazing. But... the cake was so dry! Even with some adjustments as others recommended (extra cocoa, butter, etc). I guess I could try it again with oil, but I'd rather try a different recipe. I thought the frosting was too thick and difficult to spread. It might need an extra stick of butter for a creamier consistency. We ate the whole thing, but I'll use different cake and frosting recipes next time and just keep the fruit layer method.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe countless time always to great success. I would suggest adding 1-2 extra tablespoons of coco powder as well as 1 extra tablespoon of vanilla. To make this cake super yummy I add a layer of Raspberry or Strawberry Jam between the Layer with the Cream Cheese, I find it adds a little extra berry flavour (especially when berries are not in season).

this was a bit of a workout, but I enjoyed it, especially it came out delicious and good looking:) I only used raspberries for decoration. also it was a little dry, maybe add extra butter and drizzle more syrup on both halves before filling it.

I hosted a True Blood Party last night and I thought what a yummy idea a Red Velvet cake to sink our fangs into! I made a test cake the night before. I used all the other suggestions of the other reviewers. They really know cake. I added more butter, coco and used apple vinegar and all I can say is yum!My girlfriend insisted something was missing to give it that wow! She suggested more vanilla needless to say the test cake only lasted a few hours before the cake plate was empty:) So was it really missing something? I don't think so. The next morning I made the cake for the party and my guest were wishing I made two as they wanted some to take home! This recipe is under lock and key! It's a very moist cake. Not too sweet. Just right. I give it Four folks. I didn't serve with the berries as friends suggested that really isn't a southern way to serve this cake.

Went with the recomm. increases in ingredients: 4 tbsp cocoa, 3 tbsp red food coloring, 1 tbsp vanilla, 1/4 cup veg. oil (in addition to existing butter), 1 1/3 cup buttermilk (my additional change due to thickness of batter) ... Resulted in great color and moist flavorful cake. HOWEVER, FROSTING RECIPE HAS A PROBLEM: Was quite soft and sloppy - ended up adding an additional 1 1/2 cups icing sugar - this helped but still softer and sloppier than you would want. Next time I will try using only one 8 oz package of cream cheese to see if the consistancy improves.

Good red velvet recipe! I tried Martha Stewart's recipe first and was disappointed. The cupcakes didn't have much flavour and they turned out more brown rather than red in colour. I used the cake recipe for my cupcakes... I added an extra tbsp of cocoa, extra tsp of vanilla and full 1oz of red gel paste rather than the liquid colouring. The cupcakes came out perfectly moist and in a perfect red colour! Unfortunately, still doesn't have a deep chocolate flavour but they are good! Will use this recipe again. Frosting is also yummy.

Love this recipe. Have made it dozens of times. Added butter good. I use fresh full fat buttermilk from the farmer's market and it's terrific. If you can only get low fat buttermilk add a couple of tablespoons of heavy cream to make the cake moister. High-quality ingredients are the secret to making this cake fabulous.

made this today for my brother's 15th birthday, with a few modifications as per other reviewers' useful tips: added 1/2 c butter to starting butter/sugar mixture; added I T extra cocoa powder to dry ingredients; instead of 1 c buttermilk used 1 c full fat sour cream. Also - baking time: after 27 minutes, inserted tester and very wet, so baked an additional 7 minutes, cakes came out perfect... moist, spongy, and light. The icing is rich but delightfully tangy and finger-lickingly addictive.. fresh berries adorning the top and along the middle of the cake looked excellent after 5 hours chilling time. I am so pleased with the results of this recipe. Also, cake NEEDS 2-3 T of red food coloring, or it will be brown. Not that anyone who tried it cared, for the flavor and texture were fantastic! Brilliant recipe, a great summer birthday cake!

Took advice of other reviews and added more cocoa powder. I am glad that I did. It wouldn't have been chocolate-y enough. Got rave reviews. I even assembled the whole thing the night before (stuck it in fridge overnight) and it still held together.

Fantastic. I made this yesterday for my cowowrker's little family get together for the Fourth. (I'm working on developing a neighborhood reputation as the cake baker) Unfortunately, I was out of red dye, and I was wary of using my four bottles of liquid blue-- a previous attempt by my mother yielded something like "swamp-velvet". The key is to use A LOT of blue and a small dose of violet; the batter was the color of duct tape, which made a sort of a denim-colored cake (very Americana, no?) one it came out of the oven. The coloring made it a bit watery, so I gave it a few liberal sprinkles of AP flour. I frosted the three 8" layers with a vanilla-with-sweetened-coconut buttercream and stenciled a star on the surface with red sprinkles... It was quite the presentation! Very well recieved, although the dye did turn tongues blue... As a note, I did use cornstarch and AP flour: 1/4 cup starch and 1 3/4 cup AP flour for 2 cups cake flour. Hope all of this helps!

As per many reviews, I sifted twice, and added 1/2 cup butter and 1 Tbsp cocoa. The cake came out extremely moist and delicious. Also, I didn't use liquid buttermilk - I sifted the powdered stuff with the dry ingredients, and added the water with the wets. For people complaining about dryness...if you are only familiar with grocery store cakes and mixes from a box, homemade cake tends to be slightly drier. This is due to the lack of emulsifiers and mile-long list of chemicals in homemade cakes. I guess it's a tradeoff for flavor, freshness, and healthfulness. I always have problems with cream cheese frosting being kind of squishy, and not nearly as easy to work with as buttercream. However, this one has a nice tang to it.

Yum, yum, yum! I made this cake over the weekend to compete against my neighbors in a fun Cake Cook-Off! My cake won! I really wanted an impressive looking cake, so I doubled the recipe to make 3 1/2 - layers. The extra 1/2 layer was a tester. I also modified the recipe according to some of the tips found in reviews of this cake. So, with a doubled recipe, I used 6 heaping tablespoons of cocoa powder added an extra 1/4 cup of buttermilk, 1/4 cup of vegetable oil. I used food coloring gel (Duffs, found at Michaels) and dropped in 1/2 of a vial to get a beautiful red cake, 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract and 3 sticks of unsalted butter. For the frosting, I only used 4 cups of powdered sugar instead of doubling. I will definitely make this cake again!

Using the suggested extra cocoa, oil and butter, this cake turned out as the lightest cake; moist and delicious. The problem that reviewers have had could well be with the measurement of the cake flour. I measured 2-1/4 cups,sifted it and then took 2-1/4 cups from the sifted flour and had about 2/3 cup left over. I imagine that the extra 2/3 cup of flour would make the cake heavier. Indeed, I think that I could get away with using 3/4 cup of butter and still end up with a light cake.

This cake is absolutely wonderful. It is simply the best Red Velvet Cake recipe. I found it to be moist, flavorful, perfect balance of chocolate and cream cheese. Absolute heaven!!

Having made this recipe once before and enjoyed it, I decided to do so again yesterday and (prepare to laugh at me) added an extra stick of butter to the cake by accident. I left two sticks out to come to room temperature, one for the cake and one for the frosting, and realized only when preparing to make the frosting that I had put both sticks into the cake! But more butter is never a bad thing, and it came out wonderfully moist and delicious. If you're willing to add the extra fat and calories I highly recommend the extra stick of butter!

I made this recipe & if I had more time I should have read through all of the suggestions first. The cake was not as red as I thought it would be. I found that although I reduced the baking time it still seemed a tad dry. I would definitely tweak the recipe & attempt it again. The combination of the frosting & cake was delicious. I also loved that it was not a very sweet cake.

I made this recipe last night and I must admit the cake was absolutely beautiful to look at (so pretty, in fact, that I took pictures). I made the following changes to the recipe (based on the suggestions of other reviewers): 3 TBS of Cocoa Powder, 1 TBS Vanilla, 2.5 TBS red food coloring, Extra 1/4 cup of butter, 1/8 cup oil. The cake had a delicious flavor but, to me, it still tasted a little dry (though my guests raved about it). If I make this again, I will definitely add in sour cream or creme fraiche to make it more moist. Frosting and berries make the cake, no doubt.

This cake tasted like most red velvet cakes I've had, but mine was a bit dry (probably my fault). I added 4+Tbls of Cocoa and 6Tbls red. Color was perfect and flavor was fine. I think it would have been bland w/out the extra cocoa. I meant to add the additional butter that 2 reviewers had mentioned, but I forgot. The cake was fine... it was just not WOW. I did make the icing as wel and while it was slightly thin, it was fine and I was even able to make small decorations with it. I did not add the fruit. Overall this is a C+/B- cake. Not stellar. I think you get better from a box cake.

I took a risk and blindly followed one reviewer's recommendation and added a 1/4 C of oil, 1 EXTRA Tbl of cocoa powder, 2 EXTRA Tbl of red food coloring, and used apple cider vinegar instead of distilled. The reviewer also recommended adding an additional 1/4 C of butter. I accidentally added an extra 1/2 C (a whole stick). yikes. The recipe yielded about 24 cupcakes. I noticed that the cupcake paper got a little oily (for the obvious reasons). Regardless, the results were pretty tasty! I noticed the cupcakes tasted better the next day. So I would say this is one of those desert recipes that will hold up if you bake in advance.

I made this into cupcakes for my family and they all LOVED them! The cream cheese frosting was amazing. I gave it 3 forks because I had to double the vanilla, cocoa, and add some extra sugar. With these additions, the flavor was still subtle and delicious, so I think following the recipe directly would result in a plain tasting cake. Thanks so much!

Rating: 2
I like the way it came out, but have some stipulations, which take a 2 fork recipe and make it 3: I'm in Scotland, where cake flour doesn't exist, so I followed another reviewer's suggestion to use 2 cups of plain/all-purpose flour + 1/4 cup of cornflour. The cake turned out fairly dense, instead of the tall, airy looking specimen in the picture. This could also be partly because I also followed advice to increase the amounts of butter, cocoa, vanilla, and food coloring. Using a whole bottle of maybe 6 TBSP of food coloring did not produce a red cake, but I assume that's because of all the extra cocoa. I don't regret the cocoa at all though, because my boyfriend says it tastes perfect (and since it's for his birthday cake, that's all that matters). Because he loves coconut, I added some to the frosting, but found the frosting to be kind of goopy. It left me worried that gravity would pull it all right off the cake. I'm hoping I don't wake up in the morning to find a cake sitting in a puddle. If I had more powdered sugar, I'd add it, but as it is, I have to just hope it'll be okay.

this really turned out! I rarely make cakes, as I find the process intimidating and they usually turn out lopsided. this recipe however, yielded great results - the only criticism I have is that it wasn't really that red. I did add extra food coloring, but it turned out more of a brown color, probably because of the cocoa. next time I'll add the whole vial of coloring, because I do want it to be really red. Note on the berries: use only FRESH berries. I used thawed frozen ones, and it was pretty messy. Great for a beginner baker - if I can do it, you can too!

I liked this cake and would make it again. I made it for a friend's surprise b-day party and it was a hit. However, I did change the recipe a bit. I grew up watching my mom make cakes from scratch, and I know there is something to switching it up. For me that meant adding about 1/3 to 1/2 more cocoa powder and a dash or two more of vanilla. That definitely intensified the flavor. I also added about a teaspoon more of vanilla to the cream cheese frosting. I wanted to cook the cake the night before to give it some time to mellow, but I ran out of time. Instead, I made it first thing in the morning, let it cool, frosted it and let it sit in the fridge for about 6 or so hours. I added only fresh blueberries to the middle layer and adding the raspberries only just before I was ready to go. I didn't like using so much red food coloring and next time I'm going to experiment a bit more. I'm going to try one version with none at all and then try another with the gel tints. Red food coloring add a taste I just don't like. I think everyone I served it to had been drinking and kept drinking, so I had the right audience. ;) However, I had one drink and could taste a tinge of aftertaste...not good.

Rating: 2
The icing was good, but the cake itself didn't seem to have any flavor. I left out the fruit since I wanted to try just the red velvet cake, so this may have tasted much better if I had used fruit. If you are looking for just a red velvet cake sans fruit, pass this one by.

My first red velvet cake to make or eat... must say it was wonder and moist. Took a couple tips from other reviews.. added 4 Tablespoons of Coco and a 1/4 c more butter. Love the dark rich color. I'm not a big fan of 'sweet' frosting, so I cut the sugar way back. I only used 1 cup of powdered sugar.. gives the cream cheese a nice highlight. Oh and the berries!!!! Went with Black and Rasp!! Fantastic! This cake presents very well too!

I have made this cake several times using the recommended adjustments, but have found that using the following additions make for an extraordinary cake! I used an additional 1/4 cup of butter, 1/4 cup of oil, 1 extra TBS of cocoa powder, 2 extra TBS of red food coloring and apple cider vinegar instead of distilled! By far the best cake ever with a deep red color! A holiday favorite!

Honestly, I wasn't impressed by the flavor. Tasted sort of blah, I had also doubled the coca, added a 1/2 stick of butter, and 1/3 cup of sour cream. The cake was very moist and everyone else in the party gave it rave reviews. The berries made the cake. I would make it again as it did get some super comments.

My only tweak I usually make with red velvet, regardless of who's recipe it is, is substituting gel icing tints for the food coloring. That much food coloring creeps me out and with the gel, I can make the cake as deep and dark or bright and cheerful as I want with just a tiny bit of icing tint. You can find these at specialty bake shops and Michaels.

With a couple of alterations, this is my favorite red velvet recipe. I add one more stick of butter making it a total of two, and I add two more tablespoons of cocoa. It always comes out moist and delicious. Try adding a big squeeze of lemon juice to the frosting. It really brightens it up. Oh, and I never make it with the fruit because I always make them cupcakes.

This cake was delicious - but it turned out fuschia, not red, even though I added quite a lot more food colouring than called for. It was very moist and a hit at my husbands birthday party. The icing was a bit heavy - will probably combine it with whipped cream next time to make it lighter.

This cake was great! I made half the frosting and only bought 1 container each of blueberries and raspberries. I don't make layer cakes so I did it in a 13 x 9, so berries only on top. I did add 1 cup mini choc chips for fun. The cake flour makes it so light, I think some people confuse it with being dry, but it's not. Huge hit at my 17 yr old's bday party.

Hi, I made this delicious treat for my wife for her birthday. She and my two boys ages 8 and 16 + a visiting 16yr old friend loved it. It is so different from the regular cake we are used to. At first I was leery just tasting the batter, but once you put on the delicious (easy) frosting and the fresh fruit it all came together for a unique treat. Try this cake you wont be disappointed, very nice for a special occasion. One caveat, I didnt see the need for all the fruit unless you just wanted the presentation to have a certain wow factor. I used two 6oz containers (1 Raspberries, 1 Blueberries) that was enough to fill the middle and sprinkle a couple on top for look..So use your own discretion with this.. Enjoy

I am so disappointed! I followed this recipe to the tee! I can't figure out why it tastes so funny. Almost like cardboard! I double checked my ingredience.

I didn't think this was a very good red velvet cake and I've made a few. Red velvet cakes are dense but this cake was dry and I thought the cream cheese frosting was off. The fruit was a nice touch and it did look pretty.

Extremely bland cake, very disappointing. I doubled the food color and still it was a medium brownish red, not the deep red I was hoping for. The frosting was too sweet. The only thing positive I can say about this recipe is that the frosting was very easy to spread. Other than that, I would never waste my time or efforts on this very underwhelming cake again. Note: I halved the amount of frosting per other reviewers' comments and it was still plenty to cover a cake.

Tasty tasty! I used just raspberries - I have a deep-seeded hatred of blueberries - and it was phenomenal! The cake itself was just dense enough, just moist enough, just PERFECT. The cream cheese frosting was the perfect counterpoint. It was the best frosting - I absolutely hate how sugary and gross buttercreams can be but this was awesome. Perfect cake, perfect frosting and the raspberries are an inspired touch. Make it - you'll love it!

I live in the tropics, so the berries I got were from the frozen section. I skipped putting them in the middle layer, but I'm about to make it for the 2nd time and I think that I'll definitely pile them on in the middle this time. I find that the berries really made it stand out. Not a huge cake fan myself, but it was an 'exciting' cake for those who ate it. Great texture too. The frozen berries sort of leaked red juice down the cake, i thought it was a disaster but it ended up looking a bit artsy. Not too shabby for my first red velvet ;)

CUPCAKES!!!! I took the advice from another user and substituted 2 cups all-purpose flour and 1/4 cup corn starch for the cake flour, as well as only making half of the frosting. Perfection!

I made this recipe as cupcakes without the fruit for a photo assignment. I wasn't overwhelmed or underwhelmed, which I guess makes me just...whelmed. I followed the directions as written but doubled the cocoa for a darker, richer color. The texture is dense but soft, not dry, not moist. (I did sift before measuring the cake flour and was careful not to overcook.) I'm not sure what the draw is for red velvet cake. The reddish color ranges from obviously artificial to garishly artificial and the flavor is only mildly chocolatey. There's not much to recommend it, in my opinion. The cream cheese and creme fraiche frosting I made was to die for, though. Here again, cake serves as a substrate for snarfing unhealthy amounts of frosting.

all the reviews sounded great so i decided to try it...turns out having followed the instructions exactly (apart from sifting the flour as i didn't have a sifter) got me a rather dry cake, in complete contradiction to what some others said! i'm starting to think perhaps I did something wrong...i'm new to making fancy cakes like this one so i'm wondering if anyone can perhaps point to some areas in which a slight tweak could lead to a disappointingly dry cake?

This cake was DIVINE! Very moist. I followed the recipe exactly, only I added more food coloring (the past kind) to give it a really rich, dark red color. The berries add so much to the flavor, I wouldn't leave them out. The cream cheese frosting is such a perfect pair for this cake. Word of caution, though: Don't remove the cakes from the pans too soon! My bottom layer had to be stitched back together with frosting after a mishap.

A hit. Not that hard and worth it for a special event; many people had not had red velvet cake before and loved it. I used strawberries and blackberries on top only. I think using cake flour is key. One cake layer stuck a bit so use plenty of butter in the pan.

My mother has made red velvet cakes for our family on every bithday since I was a child and I am now 47 years old. My mother turned 80 on May 18th and I thought it was time I made her one. I wanted it to be a surprise so I did not ask for her recipe. I made this one and it was delicious, even better than hers. My husband says the berries make it and I agree they add a nice freshness. Do not skip them. This cake is bealutiful. It will make a nice 4th of July cake, red cake, white frosting, and the blueberries and raspberries. I made it according to the recipe and would not change a thing, worth the effort.

This recipe requires no modifications in my opinion. I flound it to be moist and delicious. As far as flavor is concerned, I personally wouldn't reduce the cocoa. Is it the reddest? No, but personally I prefer the brownish-red as it looks more natural. Definitely the freshest (with the addition of the fruit) and most delicious red velvet cake I've ever tasted. Equally delicious with strawberries in place of the raspberries.

This was delicious. Sifting flour is essential. I did add the extra stick of butter and 1/2 cup sour cream to ensure moistness. It did keep it moist. Frosting very good. I did cupcakes and made 24 2.5 inch cupcakes and 21 mini cupcakes from this recipe. Husband has eaten four of the big ones so far!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't add berries between layers. I used cake flour and sifted before measuring. The cake sank in the middle while baking. I thought I may have used too little flour, but it tasted delicious and was moist. The top was flat when frosted, but I added a bunch of berries to the top and it presented well.

I've made this recipe many times and i've even done 1.5 times the recipe to make it a tall 3 layer cake. The only change I make is to add more red food coloring. The cake always comes out perfectly moist and delicious. I've never had to change the frosting recipe. The cream cheese frosting tastes best with this cake. I've received numerous compliments and even marriage proposals after people taste it.

I used the suggestions of increasing the butter by 1/2 stick, adding 1/2C sour cream, an extra 1/4C cake flour, and only 1T cocoa, and it was the best and moistest cake I ever made! The red color was gorgeous, so I think only having 1T of cocoa really paid off! EVERYONE loved it!

Since some people in the reviews seemed to be worried about dryness, I went ahead and followed suggestions adding an additional 1/4 c butter and 1/2 cup sour cream to the mix. I used cake flour and sifted twice and didn't have an issue with dryness, (even with the miniatures!) The frosting was a little difficult to set up(maybe less butter next time) and I would consider beating a little more to add air or chilling slightly before piping. Otherwise all the detail is lost. Overall, with suggestions, very good!

WOW! I followed the recipe to a T and turned them into cupcakes. I only needed to bake them for 18 mins. They came out FLUFFY and delicious. People were raving about them and the cream cheese frosting is delicious! The frosting is very thick so be careful as to how much you want to layer on. I'm considering thinning out the frosting and whipping it more to make it a lighter consistency.

This recipe is great! I bought red coloring from a local cake supply store. It was cheaper than the grocery store brand and the color is more concentrated so it gave me a brighter, more vibrant red.

It's important to sift the flour. You'll see that you will use much less. This is probably what accounts for the dryness that some are complaining about.

After getting a craving for cupcakes, I was seriously disappointed by this recipe. They came out dry (think prepackaged gas station muffin dry), a sickly pink color, and weren't sweet enough. I used a different icing - the Creamy Vanilla Icing recipe from Magnolia bakery - and the combination was pretty gross. Unfortunately, this made 24 cupcakes for me - aside from the 1 I ate to see if they were actually worth sharing, I still have 23 to go and will probably just toss 'em. Sad.

This came out AMAZING! Like many of the other reviewers suggested, I added an additional 1/2 stick of butter, 1/2 cup of creme fraiche (I didn't have sour cream), reduced to sugar by 1/4 cup (I don't like it too sweet) and reduced the cooking time to 24-min (checking after 20). It came out PERFECTLY moist and the color was gorgeous! I also reduced the sugar in the frosting as well. Will definitely be making this one again.

this recipe is super tasty. i made cupcakes and boy where they moist. i used coarse sea salt instead of regular salt. it worked wonderfully in contrast with the sweet frosting. i also used a table spoon of vinegar instead of a teaspoon. i think this made them extra fluffy. so good. so. good.

for Christmas I added green food coloring to the frosting, beautiful. for best results sift twice. I've made this cake maybe 5 or 6 times as mini-cakes, layered cakes and cupcakes and each time it gets better. I'm generous with the buttermilk. also, you may need more food coloring. great cake, AMAZING frosting. blueberries set this cake off.

Very good. Followed the recipe exactly except I made cupcakes instead of 9-inch cakes (cooked for 17 mins). Red velvet cake is not an easy or mess-free recipe but if you like the flavor, it's worth it. Also, frosting is divine! For those who said it was dry...you MUST use cake flour and you MUST sift for red velvet cake. I didn't have this problem, but I both sifted and used cake flour so it came out fine. Overall, great recipe.

I made this for Christmas dinner but changed it a bit. As per another recipe, I used 2 T. red food coloring, and the color was great. Also, I made it in 3 pans instead of 2, adding height and a bit of panache for the holiday. And lastly, I made a ganache of 1/2 C. heavy cream, heated to boiling, to which I added 8 oz. of dark chocolate. After a few minutes, I poured this over the top of the cake, allowing it to drip down the sides for a rustic, homemade presentation. Looked lovely on a pretty Christmas plate served with a scoop of either vanilla or peppermint stick ice cream.

I made this cake in the summer, at the height of the berry season - I used red raspberries, black raspberries and blueberries. I used lowfat buttermilk and thought the cake was slightly dry (as the other reviewers did), but I think if I use part full-fat buttermilk and some yoghurt or sour cream next time, that will do the trick. I thought it was delicious (as did everyone else - even my mom who doesnt like cake) but better after a day in the fridge to have all the flavors meld a little. And oh my! what a BEAUTIFUL cake!!!

I just made this cake last night. My friends loved it, especially the frosting. We all thought the cake had the perfect amount of sweetness since we don't like cakes that are too sweet.

The family loved it, but my friend from the south said it was not as sweet as southern red velvet cake, so she did not think it was true red velevt cake. I thought it was better than most red velevet cake & cupcakes I have eaten at bakeries and restaurants.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cake component was slightly dry which influenced my rating of only two forks. If the cake had been more moist I would have given it 3.5. I took the cake out a couple minutes before the estimated time in the recipe, and I think that was still was slightly too late, which is most likely the cause of the dryness. Start checking very early . Did not need to add extra red dye, cake was very red. I don't reccommend using more cocoa powder, as this will make it taste more like a chocolate cake, than a red velvet cake.

This is the best red velvet cake I have EVER eaten...far better than any of the expensive bakery cupcakes I've tried. I've made it three times now, and it's truly splendid. I made some of the changes suggested by previous reviews, and it comes out perfect every time: 1) increase cocoa to 1/3 cup (I use Green & Black's organic cocoa), 2) increase food coloring to 2 tbsp., 3) increase butter to 2 sticks, 4) I also add a pinch of salt to the frosting, along with an extra 1/2 cup of powdered sugar. For cupcakes, this recipe yields 22 cupcakes, which only require 18 minutes baking time.

cake came together in an almost foolproof manner. prefer this recipe b/c it goes easy on the red food coloring, compared to other recipes. cake was exceptionally moist and pretty much perfect in texture. i prefer a buttercream style frosting, in terms of both taste and texture. tried the cream cheese frosting with this recipe; taste was great but it was a challenge to get the icing to set on a warm humid summer afternoon. presentation was beautiful and it was nice to be able to take advantage of in-season fruit (also great to sneak in anti-oxidants for the kids/stubborn adults). I'll definitely make this cake again, but use a more traditional buttercream.

I was a little confused reading all the previous reviews and different substitutions people had tried so decided to just follow the recipe very carefully and it came out great! The only reason I can think that other people's cakes are coming out so dry is that perhaps they weren't using cake flour? I didn't have any cake flour so looked up a substitution here on epicurious - just involves substituting some All-Purpose flour with corn starch. I guess this lowers the protein content of the flour and allows it to retain more moisture. I had no problem with the color or flavor of the cake. The one thing I did decide to change was to use only 1 cup of powdered sugar in the frosting instead of the 2 1/2 cups stated in the recipe. 1 cup was ample (in fact I'd use slightly less the next time round), I can't imagine how horrendously sweet it would have been with 2 1/2 cups!

This was not very good. My daughter made it for Easter. It was super dry- wish we would have read the suggestions of other reviewers on how to make it more moist. It was a dreary color too, the 1 tablespoon of red food coloring just didn't do it and we ended up adding way more and still the color was muddy- not red red! I won't make this again. Would rather try other red velvet recipes!

Once I made some tweaks to the recipe, It came out great. First, in total I used 1 1/2 sticks of butter and 1/2 cup of Sour Cream. I always add sour cream to my cake recipes and, No, you can't taste it...AT All...IMHO it makes cakes a lot more moist.... I also reduced the Cocoa to only 1 heeping tbl...b/c originally, Cocoa was only added to red velvet to give it color, not flavor...Also in total I used 2 1/2 cups of cake flour. For the coloring I used 3/4 of a container of Wilton No Taste Red coloring. The cake came out just as pictured. Also, just to make things easier. Line your cake pan with parchment paper and then spray/butter/flour (whatever process you use) it. Your cake will not stick and it makes clean up waaay easier. Only gave this 3 stars b/c the original recipes definitely needs some tweaking, mainly with the butter amount...

Rating: 4
I love this recipe! If I make a cake, this is the recipe I use 90% of the time. Like other reviewers, I use 1/3 cup of cocoa and 1/3 cup of vegetable oil. I also think it gives the cake a darker red look which I think looks better than the bright red that you normally see in red velvet cakes. I also use this recipe to make cupcakes and it's still so delicious! The frosting is very good as well, but a little too cheesy for my boyfriend, so I cut it down to 1 1/2 packages of cream cheese. So good!!!

Rating: 4
I read the reviews and really felt the cake needed more chocolate but was not wanting to add that much more fat ( the 1/2 cup suggested by other reviewers). I decided to use 1/4 cup melted dark chocolate and keep everything else the same. I added the melted chocolate after the eggs into the butter and sugar. Great results. It is a very tasty, a bit darker red due to the dark chocolate and moist. I am at 6500 feet and my cooking time was 21 minutes.

Taking the feedback from other reviewers, I used 2 sticks unsalted butter, almost 1/4 cup cocoa, and reduced the powdered sugar in the frosting to a bit less than 2 cups, per my taste. I also thought the batter was a bit thick so I threw in an extra splash of buttermilk at the end. All in all, a perfectly moist cake even the day after. I'd try to reduce the butter to 1-1/2 sticks next time and increase the buttermilk a bit more to maintain the moisture and reduce the fat. I REALLY liked the frosting. I sifted the powdered sugar before adding which makes a really creamy frosting without lumps. After many attempts at lumpy frosting, this finally dawned on me! Oh, I also triple sifted the flour as suggested and noticed that my 2-1/2 cups was reduced quite a bit after measuring again. I also used a bottle and a half of food coloring, because I wanted a deep red color, instead of blood red (to match the photo on this site). DEFINITELY will bake this cake again.

As a Pastry Chef student, may I mention to all who try this recipe and decide to "tweak" the cocoa content by upping it more than a small amount (like, for example, burntchick3n's 1/4 cup): Cocoa is a "drying" ingredient, and should be treated the same as flour. Whenever you add more cocoa to a recipe, you are upsetting the moisture balance, unless you *subtract* the equivalent amount of flour from the recipe to compensate. Otherwise you will get a VERY dry cake, as I see some disappointed reviewers reported.

Rating: 4
This recipe is great with the added tweakings of another stick of butter, 1/4 cup of cocoa, a whole bottle and a half of food colouring and 1/3 cup of vegetable oil. It makes it very moist. Is a crowd pleaser with the cream cheese icing and in fact, it's been my most requested cake for any gathering.

Red Velvet Cake is hard! It can develop holes if there's too much leavening and if it's beaten too much. I made this recipe with European-style butter (1 stick) and it was moist and dense. Try not to mix it too much - stop mixing as soon as the flour is barely incorporated. Made my frosting with Eu-style butter and mascarpone. It was very well received.

this cake might be the best i've ever made! i made cupcakes, and used about 220g of butter, think that's ever so slightly less than 2 sticks/1cup and increased the cocoa to a heaping 1/4 cup, both as recommended by the reviews. also cut the sugar to about 1 cup and 1 tbspn cause i don't like my cake too sweet and it was AWESOME!!! for the frosting i mixed about 3/4 of a block of philly cream cheese, the remaining 20g of butter, and about 1/2 a cup of icing sugar and added more as i went along.

RED VELVET TORTE I followed others' suggestions by upping the butter and cocoa content. Since the only fresh raspberries were horribly pale, I skipped the berries. Instead, I increased the icing by half (ie., using 3 pkgs of cream cheese etc.), gently split the layers and dotted the opened layers of cake with the icing before spreading (to get around the problem of the crumbliness of the cake). The four layers looked amazing and everyone thought this was the PROPER amount of icing!

I upped the cocoa to 1/4 c, so the flavor was fine. However, this cake was INSANELY dry, and I never overbake stuff. I felt like I was eating red sawdust. Not too enjoyable... adding more butter would help. If you can fix the moisture problem, go for it.

It is the first time I have ever baked a cake from scratch, but I followed the suggestions of others and this recipe came out great! For the cake portion I used 1/4 C unsweetened cocoa powder, a whole bottle (1 oz.) of red food coloring, and 2 sticks of unsalted butter. I also only filled the cake pans halfway and then shook them flat. (They rose when baking and filled the pans. Anymore and they would have overflowed.) I had enough batter left for one cupcake - which allowed me a "taster". Yum! The cupcake only took 25 minutes to bake, but the cakes took 37 minutes. It was a cold, rainy day so maybe that effected it. I would definitely recommend trying it! I baked it for my husband's birthday and everyone loved it!!

Rating: 3
Overall a tasty cake. I used 2 sticks of butter, a heaping 1/4 cup of cocoa, and a whole tube of food coloring. I baked it for 29.5 minutes (it didn't seem done after 27), but it was a little dry, and next time I will remove it promptly. I might use a little less cocoa also - there was just enough chocolate flavor to make you wonder why it wasn't just a chocolate cake. My cake had a very coarse crumb - not sure if it was the recipe or the mediocre mixer not creaming things well enough. The frosting was good, and there was just the right amount. I didn't have any berries, but I'm sure they would have been delicious. Random note - my bf wanted a blue velvet cake, and so I used blue food coloring, but I got a deep forest green. Not sure if it was weak food coloring, or some strange chemical reaction. Green velvet cake is yummy anyway!

I took note of the other reviewers comments and altered the recipe as follows: 1. Triple sifted the flour before measuring 2. Substituted cider vinegar for regular vinegar 3. Doubled the food coloring 4. Increased the cocoa to 1/4 c. I used this for 2 dozen cupcakes and it was great. I baked them for 20 minutes and they were perfect. The cupcakes were flavorful and moist, but a little greasy. I may cut the butter down to 1 3/4 sticks of butter.

I'd never made red velvet cake before, but made basically the same modifications that others did: an extra stick of butter, an extra tablespoon of cocoa and another teaspoon or so of food coloring. I'm glad I added the extra butter, because the cake was just slightly dry even with that, but people loved it anyway. The cream cheese frosting is delicious.

I also made cupcakes from this batter, used the extra cocoa powder, extra butter and a concentrated food coloring. I thought the taste was pretty good and texture was perfect for my taste. (I did sift twice, however.) The coloring wasn't very red as the extra cocoa made it pretty dark. Wasn't SUPER flavorful, but was pretty good. Will make again until I find a better recipe!

I made this recipe after have a very unsuccessful attempt at another red velvet recipe.

I added an extra stick of butter, an extra tablespoon of cocoa, and an extra tablespoon of food coloring. The cake is delicious and moist, but a bit crumbly, and is a dark red- brown rather than a bright red. I may try 1.5 sticks of butter next time to see if it is less crumbly.

I've made this cake several times with modifications as recommended and have received rave reviews. I add an extra stick of butter and also mix an extra heaping tablespoon of cocoa with the food coloring (an entire bottle) before adding it to the liquid mixture. I also use cake flour and sift twice. The end result is a delicious, moist, and very red cake. Fresh berries are a must. I just don't know if it would be the same without them. The only problem I have had is that I have frequently undercooked it (afraid of dryness) which causes a problem when cooling on a wire rack.

I'd do this again, but pay more attention to the reviews that addressed dryness. I was horrified by how dry the cake was, but served it with a dollop of berries. I also made it as a Blue Velvet cake, for a group of friends, using blue food coloring.

I too added the extra stick of butter and increased the cocoa to a heaping 1/4 cup as recommended by other reviewers. the cake was good but when I make it again I will stick to the 2 T. of cocoa in the recipe. I think the extra cocoa made the cake too brown in color and as a result it did not have the vibrant red color that I was hoping for. I also thought the batter seemed to be too little (it only filled the pans barely halfway) for the 9" pans, but it rose to the top and had I used smaller pans it would have overflowed. Also the berries were a real + and made it extra special.

Rating: 2
I read the reviews, tried to incorporate the tweaks, and it still failed! I only used one and a half sticks of butter (because that's all I had) and the cake was dry and hard. Next time (I will try again!) I will do the 2 sticks of butter and perhaps even extra buttermilk. The 1/4 cup of cocoa didn't seem like enough, so I'll add more. The color was good with 2 tbsp of red color. The icing was terrific! If you are thinking of making this cake, be sure to use the extra butter and cocoa. Learn from my mistake!

I have made this cake many many times and I always use the recommended tweaks to get it exactly right -- extra cocoa, red food coloring and oil. Each time I've made it I've filled the pans too full, resulting in hard to handle layers. The last time, I only filled the pans 3/4 of the way full, shook flat and baked a few cupcakes iwth the remaining batter. Instead of fruit, I crumbled the cupcakes up and pressed the crumbs into the top and sides of cake, then lined the bottom with raspberries. You could also line the bottom of your cake platter with flowers, like gerber daisies. Nice presentation and ALWAYS a hit. I have friends request this cake all the time.

I did exactly what you said and went with the 1/3 cup of cocoa. I used strawberries because eddie loves--it was fabulous without, but a little better with them. Thank-you

Oh yea...I left all the berries out too. It's great all by its self!

I was really nervous attempting this recipe after reading so many reviews. I too, did some tweaking and I must say the cake came out just AMAZING. I sifted my flour several times before measuring it out. I then sifted all of my dry ingredients together minus the baking soda. I mixed the soda and vinegar together in a small cup and folded that into my batter at the very end. I used 2 sticks of butter and a heaping 1/4 cup of cocoa. I also added an additional tablespoon of red dye. I baked my cake for 25-26 minutes and it came out perfect. Very moist and delicious. I actually wound up wrapping the cakes in saran and refrigerated them overnight. The next morning I took them out and made the frosting. This was a birthday cake for my husband as per his request and he absolutely loved it. I gave the recipe only 3 forks because I had to tweak it so much but I will definitely make this cake again. Perhaps next time I will use 1/3 cups of cocoa. Good Luck and do try these little tweaks. They make all the difference in the world!

Thanks to reading previous reviews, this cake was fabulous! A must is the extra cocoa and butter. The recipe is perfect to bake in a 9x13 pan. I made two and stacked one cake on the other. Party guests were eating crumbs from plates and the serving platter. A keeper of a recipe.

I gave it three forks, because it was too sweet for me. However, I made this for my friend, and the important thing is that she absolutely loved it. I actually saw people picking up the crumbs from the cake plate. I added a bit of canola oil and more cocoa - mostly because I wanted a strong color since I wasn't using food dye. The great taste came from the fabulous high quality cocoa powder used. I didn't really have cake-flour, so I added one teaspoon of baking powder per cup of flour- plus one teaspoon. But I didn't have cornstarch (to make cake flour) but still received no complaints. For the fruit, a pint of each suffices unless you want the focus to be the fruit and not the cake. I added a pint of blackberries in between layers, covered the top with carefully placed raspberries and the rim of the platter with blueberries. I also had no white vinegar...so cider vinegar did the trick. I've been "commissioned" already to do it again. To do the frosting...I'm terrible at frosting cakes, but I find it easier if the cake is cold and the frosting is room temperature. Next time, I think I'll substitute a bit of Splenda for at least part of the powdered sugar in the frosting. I found it the sugar content was very high.

I made this last night for a celebration and the cake was received with raving reviews. Our friends are true Southerners and it was a coup to have this cake "taste like one from home." I added 1/4 cup cocoa powder and 1 cup butter, all other ingredients were the same. Next time I will bake for 3-5 minutes less. Moist and delicious.

Rating: 3
I have made this a few times as cupcakes to rave reviews each & every time. Like other reviewers, I add another tbsp of cocoa and a half stick of butter (although I have made it without the extra butter and it was still moist). The cream cheese frosting is yummy too. The trick I found from Joy of Cooking is to actually have the cream cheese cold (cut into small cubes) to get fluffy frosting.

I made this for an anniversary party yesterday and it was great! I added an extra Tbsp. of cocoa and an extra stick of butter as suggested in the other reviews. I didn't use oil because it said not to use oil on the cake flour box. I only have 8" round cake pans and thought it would be ok but that was a mistake, the cakes bubbled over the pans and started spilling out into the oven. I also had to bake this for 42 minutes - not sure if it's my oven or what but they were still liquid inside at 27 minutes. I thought this was going to be a disaster but it turned out so great! The frosting was perfect too. I will definitely make this again but I will invest in 9" cake pans first!

This recipe definitely made a good red velvet cake after being tweaked as suggested by other reviewers (extra butter and cocoa powder). Sifting the dry ingredients is really important, and not that time consuming, really. Another important thing is to be sure not to overmix the batter. Set the mixer on low, and mix only until combined, not too long. Overmixing is guaranteed to result in a dense, tough cake. Oh! And to the person who was reluctant to use buttermilk, I would say USE IT! I use buttermilk in just about every cake/muffin/quick bread recipe I make. It makes a big difference in the taste and texture, not sour at all, and I will never go back to using plain milk again!

Rating: 3
I added 1/3 c oil and 1/4 c cocoa powder. It still came out very dry and I am sure I did not overbake it. Next time I might go for the extra stick of butter instead of using only 1/3 c oil. This recipe makes the perfect frosting and just the right amount. For once I did not have extra frosting left over.

Rating: 3
Ok, so everybody's hints were very helpful. You should double the amount of cocoa powder and add 1/3 cup of oil. I am not sure that the extra food coloring is necessary, I ran out so didn't double it and the cake was very red. I actually forgot to add the oil for the bottom layer of the cake although remembered by the time the second layer was ready to be baked and the difference between the 2 layers was like night and day. The frosting is very enjoyable and the cake was a success even without the berries.

Rating: 3
This was a really tasty cake! I added the extra cocoa powder and butter as suggested, but my cake still came out a little bit dry. I may have overbaked it a bit even though I did reduce the bake time to 24 minutes. Would a extra egg help? I plan on making this again with a few minor tweaks!

Rating: 4
Now THIS is what red velvet cake should taste like! I followed other recommendations and increased the cocoa to a heaping 1/4 cup, added the entire bottle of food coloring, and added an additional stick of butter to the cake mix. The outcome was divine - - exactly the moist red velvet cake I was looking for. The frosting was especially good after beating for a long while to a very fluffy consistency.

I use this recipe to make red velvet cupcakes with just a few tweaks. I love my red velvet to be deep blood red, so I substitute concentrated gel icing dye in place of the regular liquid food coloring the recipe calls for. In addition, an added touch that I've always found to be a crowd-pleaser is to top off the rich cream cheese frosting with sugared rose petals. Red velvet should never, ever be anything less than spectacular! :) Bon apetit!

I've been on the hunt for red velvet cake and find that this is the one I'll keep. Like the other bakers, I added one stick of butter more for a total of 2 sticks of butter and increased the cocoa to a heaping 1/4 cup. Texture was perfect. Whipping the butter, sugar, and eggs until fluffy also is very important

I love this cake, and I love this recipe! To the cook from CT whose cake stuck to the silicone mold, you probably don't have a real silicone mold! Invest in the good stuff, it won't stick or burn, and it'll last longer (don't ever ever EVER scrub it, though). Also, every oven is different, you need to find whether you have to turn the dial up or down compared to the recipe. To those that found the cake dry, try imbibing the layers with sugar syrup (this tip will take any cake from dry to delicious).

great cake, and you don't need to add the extra food coloring, 1tbs of food coloring is enough, i promise! the batter will look light but it will bake up deep red. do add the oil and extra cocoa.

I made both the layered cake previously and just today cupcakes using this recipe and adding 1/3 cup of oil. It helped to moisten the cake quite a bit (as compared to my first try). I didn't even need berries, as the icing is so delicious. I'm so excited to take the cupcakes to a party tomorrow. I know my medical school friends will appreciate it! :)

I made this cake for my family on Mothers Day. I read all the reviews and edited the recipe accordingly. I also used strawberries instead as the other berries werent in season. The cake was delicious and loved by everyone but the icing was the biggest hit! I would definitely make this cake again even though it took some time.

I made these for my boyfriend's birthday, as he is a red velvet lover. I did not use any of the suggestions of other reviewers, just made them as the recipe indicated, but since I used a gel food coloring rather than a liquid i used less than i probably should have and they were not very dark. I also made them as cupcakes, and added chocolate chips to half the batter, which was yummy. They were a bit dry and only got drier as a few days passed, and honestly they were not as good as the red velvet we usually get from Doughboys, a local restaurant/bakery (they ship!) so I will just buy red velvet next time or look for another recipe.

Rating: 3
I prepared this with strawberries since the other berries were missing at the grocery and it was very well received. I think it might be a little dry, but perhaps it was because I had to substitute a yogurt/milk combo for the buttermilk. I will make it again with greater accuracy.

Made cupcakes using this recipe, adding oil and cocoa as others have mentioned, omitting berries since they'd been eaten (!) when I went to cook with them. Only used 2 8 oz cream cheese containers for frosting, and despite generous frosting there was much left over. These were delicious -- I like to spoil myself and my family on mother's day so these trippy unusual cupcakes were just the thing.

I had to bake a dessert for a Silent Auction prize our Dance Company awarded. I made the cake in a bundt pan, so I had leftover icing (the cake recipe fills one bundt pan perfectly). My six year old and I dipped fresh apple slices in the extra icing and I have spread it between 2 chocolate wafers for a mini Oreo cheesecake bite! Delicious and an excellent source of calcium from the cream cheese. I still don't know what a Red Velvet cake tastes like... but the icing was a huge hit!

I made this cake for the first time and it was a hit! It was so moist! I added a 1/3 more of cocoa powder and added the whole bottle of red food coloring as others suggested. The icing complemented the berries perfectly! Next time, i'm going to try another icing to be creative!

I'm a college student and this recipe was my first foray into baking. I read through the comments and added 1/4 cup of oil and 1 tablespoon cocoa powder to the recipe. I also used the whole 1 oz bottle of red food dye. For the frosting I used two sticks of butter and a whole box of sugar. Lacking the proper pan for a cake, I made cupcakes instead. I had to stop my roommates from eating all of them right out of the oven! They were delicious and I'll definitely be making them again!

After reading the reviews I was really concerned about making this recipe... However, I decided to go as is and it worked wonderfully! I sifted the flour and dry mixtures several times- time consuming but worth it. Baking time was also less than indicated. The cake was moist, fluffy and eaten very quickly. I only used blueberries and the flavor mixed well with the cake. Great recipe!

This cake was relatively easy to make. It was a bit on the dry side for me. Next time I'll decrease the cooking time to see if that is why it was dry. I used my own cream cheese icing recipe. Everyone loved it and the raspberries & blueberries in the filling. Most everyone said it was good, but a tad on the dry side. Thanks!

This was wonderful! i used 1 and a half packages of cream cheese instead and a little extra sugar and it worked wonders. Last time it was too rich with both packages. Also, a tip that helped me was to put frozen rasberries out, strain them, and use that for the middle...gives it a shortcake feel.

Rating: 4
This was wonderful. I made it for a potluck and it was a total hit. I followed the recipe, but also took the advice of some users and added 1/3 oil and an extra table spoon cocoa. I also had a strawberry center which went perfect with the frosting. I saw some users suggest a sugar frosting, which normally I'm more partial to, however, I think with this cake you should really use the cream cheese frosting, its very smooth and wont overpower the fruit. I also read that some users were having trouble with it being too compact, or not fluffy, definitely sift your flour, I did it several times, which is time consuming however it will give you a fluffy cake. I sifted frequently, even while adding it to my liquids. Furthermore if you only have a hand mixer, you might want to mix your dry ingredients in by hand just enough to keep the ingredients from flying everywhere. I had enough frosting for my cake, which made me very paranoid because I kept reading otherwise, however it turned out great. The best thing about the whole experience is that one of my acquaintances asked for the recipe to make it for his wife's baby shower, nothing could have been more complimenting.

Rating: 2
Not bad, but not the best Red Velvet cake Ive tasted. Like other reviewers suggested, I added oil and additional coco, reduced the vinegar and baked in two 8 pans for 26 minutes. Even with all that fiddling, the cake still came out drier than I like. Also the taste was kinda bland, something just seemed to be missing. The cream cheese icing jazzed up the overall flavor, but the cake itself was nothing to rave about.

My husbands favorite cake is red velvet...unfortunate ly he had no recipe. Over the years I have tried approximately a dozen different recipes trying to find the best cake/icing combo. This was PERFECT! My cake was light airy and tasteful. I added 1/3 cup oil with 1/3 cup cocoa and used the entire bottle of red food coloring. It was such a hit I made it into cupcakes for valentines day. Unfortunately my teenage daughters got into them before delivery so I ran a little short. My entire family agrees this is by far the best recipe. So good, that my search has ended. I used 3 - 8 oz packages of cream cheese, 2 sticks of butter, 2 tablespoons of vanilla and 4 cups of powdered sugar. I have found in the past that sifting is most important for light/airness in cakes. I also whip my frosting for quite sometime for the extra light texture.

I've made this twice, once with the oil added as another reviewer suggested, and once without.

I didn't think it was time consuming at all...but, I love to spend time in the kitchen. I don't know what the standard for Red Velvet cake is, but this is a great cake!

I must say that this recipe is very very time consuming, and labor intensive, and expensive(all those fresh berries!!) I tried to read as many of the reviews as possible and incorporate them into a winning recipe. I did add 1/4 cup oil to my batter,an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder, and did sift the flour(very time consuming). Somehow, the bottom of my cake stuck to the silicone cake pan, so I ended up with a slightly uneven bottom. Also, my cake did not bake very well, and I had to bake it overtime(perhaps my oven is not great). So why 3 forks? The icing hid all my mistakes(I did add extra sugar to the icing also), and the fresh berries looked so good and professional. I made it for my best friend's birthday, and everyone was very impressed. Not only that, it tasted great, and my friend who does not like cake had 3 slices! This recipe definitely needs tweaking, but it does look very pretty, and tastes pretty good(not to heavy for those who do not particularly like cake). So it can be worth it... I don't know if I would make it again, given all the trouble it gave me, but my friends might make me...

This cake looks beautiful - just like the picture! - but I must have done something wrong with the batter. As stated by the last reviewer, my cake was dense, dry and really rather awful. However, earlier reviewers say it is moist and light. I'll try this recipe again and see if I can't make it better, but, honestly, the cake was like red sawdust.

I have always wanted to make red velvet cake and this one was amazing. I modified the recipe using 2 sticks of butter, 3 tblsp. of cocoa powder, 2 oz. of red food color and added the vinegar and soda at the end. Also, sifting the flour 2x is important- there is a big difference in volume. This cake has a delicious, unique flavor and light texture (not at all dry.) I used the creamy vanilla frosting recipe from magnolia bakery- the flavors were perfect together and recieved raves. I bake a lot of cakes, but this is my new favorite. Plus it's so pretty!

I made this twice this week exactly as the recipe stated, except for baking it a few minutes longer to get the batter to set completely. I thought it was a great cake. Very pretty, moist and delicious with just the right amount of chocolate flavor, balanced by the cream cheese frosting. The only things I would change next time is to make 50% extra frosting to help cover the cake more fully, and to line the pans with buttered and floured parchment paper. The cake "presents" beautifully and enticingly at parties!

A light as air, moist, delicious cake! I brought this to a picnic, and it was long gone before any of the other desserts! The icing is a tad too sweet for my taste, but I still loved it. I'm planning on making these again on valentine's day as cupcakes.

I included the 1/3 cup oil and also increased the cocoa to 1/3 cup (seemed to be a bit more than 3 tbsp). The cake was moist and delicious. I also made an additional 1/2 of the batter so I could add a third layer to the cake. I doubled the frosting to be sure I would have enough to layer it on thickly, and I used most of it. Other readers mentioned that the frosting tasted too cheesy, so I used 3 8ox packages of cream cheese, one box of confectionary sugar (~4 cups), 2 sticks of butter and doubled the vanilla. Basically, I doubled the recipe but left out one box of cream cheese. It was fantastic and got rave reviews at the party I brought it to. I will definitely be making this for future events!

I really LOVE red velvet cake and decides to look up a recipe to make one for Christmas. I thought the red and white would be so pretty for Xmas. I decided to try to substitute the red food coloring with natural red coloring made from beets to avoid the carminic acid that is in regular food coloring. I was disappointed because the cake did not turn out red at all. It was a medium brown color. Next time I will have to use the whole 2oz bottle. The cake was still delicious though. It could've been a little more moist. It was a little dry.

I lost my recipe for Red Velvet cake so I came here in an attempt to find a similar recipe. Made this cake as a trial for Christmas Eve dinner. It was a hit. At first the flour mixture did not look correct ( I remember red velvet cake as a deep red chocolate cake) so I made a few changes: 1/3 cup of coco powder and 1/3 cup of oil so that the extra coco would not make the cake dry. The results were wonderful and so beautiful . However, I think the real star here is the cream cheese frosting. I will be making it again tonight for Christmas eve.

My husband asked me what kind of cake I would like for my birthday and I said, "Red Velvet cake," remembering that my Mom had made it once when I was a little girl. He found this recipe and it was fabulous! He added the extra oil and cocoa as suggested, and used a mixture of raspberries, strawberries, blackberries and blueberries. He kept the berries for the top on paper towel to soak up extra juice until about an hour before serving so there was no staining on the icing. It looked just like the picture and every guest at my birthday party from age 3 up raved about the cake. Heavenly! Unfortunately for us, there weren't a lot of leftovers!

I rated this recipe a three-forker, but with a little tinkering it could be a four-forker. Next time I would add the 1/4 cup of oil as it was a little dry as several reviewers said. I would make a third layer for extra drama. I would also increase the cocoa to 4 tablespoons for a little extra punch -- even though I know it is not supposed to be a true chocolate cake. Using professional dye was worth the effort as the color was spectacular. I also used blackberries and put them only on the top of the cake. Unlike some reviewers, I thought the frosting was delicious.

Again, like so many other reviewers I too added 1/4 cup of oil and a tablespoon more of cocoa to the batter. I didn't have enough red coloring gel to make 2 tbsp but the red was indeed bright enough!

This cake was delicious and very easy to make. I kept the berries on top of the cake, but rather than putting them between the layers, I put a mixture of coconut and crushed pecans instead.

I am new to cooking and baking (finally at 40 years old), and I needed a recipe to make a Red Velvet Cake as a special request from my in-laws. I read all the reviews for this cake and was concerned about the consistent dryness comments. I then researched at least 5 other recipes to check their ingredients and they all had oil in them. So, I used this recipe, and like so many others, tweaked it. I added 1/4 C oil. I also add another T of red coloring and an additional T of cocoa. They LOVED it. It was a huge success and they all thought I was a great baker!!! The reason for 3 forks instead of 4, is because the recipe was tweaked and not used EXACTLY as printed. I would bake it again - this time for my own family so we can have the leftovers!!!

This recipe is delicious. I made it for my husband's birthday and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly, but I used the other reviewers' criticisms to guarantee it came out great: I used parchment circles to guarantee the cake wouldn't stick and I sifted the flour twice before measuring and sifted all the dry ingredients together twice. I delicately washed the berries and made sure they were completely dry before using them in the layers and on the top so they didn't emit moisture. I also didn't use any berries that were crushed or blemished so the juice wouldn't bleed onto the white icing. It turned out great, not dry at all, I think I underbaked it just slightly so it was extremely moist and delicious. I understand reviewers complaining it wasn't chocolatey enough, I thought it was great but I would consider adding more chocolate next time for a richer flavor. Regardless it is great how it is! The presentation is gorgeous...I made extra icing and piped a rosette border along the edge of the cake, then made a border of rasperries turned upside-down, and then filled the center in with blueberries.

I made this cake as directed, with the only substitution of whole yogurt since I didn't have buttermilk. The presentation is awesome, and it turned out soft, moist and delicate, but there was something about the flavor... if I ever make it again, I think I will add the extra cocoa.

My aunt used this recipe for years, it was always delicious.

This is a good recipe but it's not a chocolate cake - and it isn't meant to be. Based on reviews and worried about dryness I tweaked to perfection. Added 1/4 cup oil, an additional tablespoon of coco. replaced 1/4 cup of buttermilk with heavy cream (always on hand), reduced vinegar to 1/4 teaspoon because I used a "gel" (0.75 oz) coloring which doesn't really need vinegar to boost/set the color. I HIGHLY recommend three things - shift the flour before measuring, use cake flour and gel coloring - not the liquid from the supermarket. You'll have to go to a cake decor/restaurant supplier but it'll be worth it. Made 24 cupcakes with RAVE reviews.

I made this cake for the first time for a friend's birthday party. After reading other cooks' suggestions, I tweaked the recipe, using 3 tablespoons of cocoa and an extra 1/3 cup of corn oil. I also waited until the end to mix the soda and vinegar.The cake turned out chocolatey and moist, even though I baked it the night before the party. My friend loved it and so did the other party guests. The store-bought desserts remained pretty much untouched, while this cake was devoured.

This is not a good red velvet cake in my opinion. Not chocolately/flavorful enough. It IS tender, but a huge piece of the cake stuck to the pan so if you decide to make it, I'd strongly advice using wax /parchment paper sprayed/floured so the cake will come out of the pans. It is very delicate, I 'll give you that..but boring! I suppose that's why she is using all the extra fruit, to jazz it up. I used buttermilk powder reconstituted. Depressing results.

I have the recipe that "came from the Waldorf. "It's at least 40 years old. You know the line....so-and-so loved the cake at the Waldorf so much she asked for the recipe, they quoted "$2.50", but she was charged $250....so she gave it to all her friends. Sounds familiar? Yep, that scam's still going on with whatever the current hot recipe is. Whatever the source, mine's lucious and wonderful. Been having it as my birthday cake since I was a wee thing. What I don't get is the cream cheese frosting. It's a cooked frosting that this cake needs, and you need to mix the vinegar and soda first before you add it. Also needs a full 2 oz of red dye. Double to cocoa.

I thought this cake was good. I listened to some suggestions and added an additional stick of butter. I also used 4 Tbs of cocoa. The day I made the cake it was not dry at all and all the guests loved it. However, the next day, even though I had properly covered it, the cake was very dry. I would suggest making it the same day you plan to serve it.

This cake was so-so. I followed other reviewers advice and added 1/3 c oil to the wet ingredients, but I wish I would have added more oil. The cake was still very dry and not flavorful at all. I didn't have cake flour so I used 1/4 c corn starch to 3/4 c flour to make 1 c cake flour. I'd also make 1 1/2 times more icing-the recipe didn't call for enough. The icing was the only thing that saved this cake!

I took the suggestion of others and used 2 sticks of butter and extra cocoa powder. Was planning on splitting cake into 4 layers but it didn't rise enough. I made an Italian Buttercream for this cake, which was wonderful because it was light and flavorful with the fruit. I wouldn't recommend blueberries between the layers. When you slice the cake the blueberries get cut into and look like little olives. Not a pleasant presentation. Especially since I went to the trouble to garnish the cake with strawberries dipped in chocolate. Don't get me wrong, this is a good cake but not great. It needs some LOVE. I did all this work to make it look beautiful and the cake was a little dry and flat.

Surprisingly good. Added extra stick of butter as suggested and used strawberries instead of raspberries and blueberries because of cost. Very moist--as suggested by other reviewers I only cooked something like 27 min.

I've made this twice for big birthdays with great success. I added an entire bottle of red food coloring, and I made my frosting half-butter and half cream cheese. It's moist, delicious, and turns out so beautiful. I also don't put the berries in the center to prevent it from getting soggy. If you are refrigerating overnight wait to decorate with the berries because they inevitably bleed onto the white frosting. oh and if you can afford, use blackberries too! so pretty, and all the fruit hides mistakes in frosting. :)

I made this cake for my husband's birthday party. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't think this cake was any drier than other Red Velvet cakes that I've tried. I did make sure to sift the flour before measuring it for the batter--which perhaps others didn't and thereby led to a drier cake. I did forget to put the berries in between the layers, but the cake still got rave reviews from my guests.

Rating: 3
I've made the cake twice exactly as directed. It was a little dry both times, but not horrible. I didn't like the frosting so I replaced it with the following: 8 oz room temp cream cheese, 12 oz melted white chocolate cooled to lukewarm, and 1 stick softened butter whipped together until light and fluffy. Delicious and a big hit for my friend's birthday.

This is my second time making this Red Velvet Cake. I follow the recipe exactly how it's written. I found that the 1 tablespoon of food coloring that is calls for is just the right amount. Like other's have said.. I would probably increase the cocoa powder to 3 tablespoons next time I make it. It makes more than enough frosting for the entire cake. It does call for sifting the flower several times though.. that gets tiring.

Rating: 2
I read quite a few of the reviews before making this recipe and decided to make it exactly as written, despite warnings of dryness by some reviewers. I did everything incording to the instructions, including sifting the sifted flower, and found the cake to be just a tad on the dry side and not that flavorful. Next time I would alter dramatically or try a different recipe for red velvet altogether.

Delicious, light, fluffy. I didn't have buttermilk, so I substitued juice of 1/2 lemon, 1/2 c yogurt and 1/4 c milk.

Cake was delicious! The only changes I made to the cake were to add 2 oz. food color, per the suggestions of other reviewers, and used slightly heaping tablespoons of cocoa. It was plenty moist using butter. The frosting was another story. Made as directed, it tasted too cheesy. So I added another stick of butter and more powdered sugar. My husband liked the frosting better after the additions. I thought it was too sweet at that point. Plus, it was so soft. I had to refrigerate for a couple hours to get it stiff enough to spread on cake. I also decorated the cake with it, and found it to soften up too fast. Family was impressed, and my sister-in-law, who eats like a bird, ate dinner plus two whole slices of cake. I took that as a huge compliment! I will definately make this one again but might look for different cream cheese frosting recipe.

This cake was so pretty and so good. I added 1/4 cup of oil to the batter, I used 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder, and 2 tablespoons of the red food coloring. The cake was SO moist--it just bordered the point of being too moist. Next time I'll try it without adding the extra oil. The color was a deep, passionate red. Loved it.

Rating: 4
I'm really not sure why some people complained that the cake was dry; the recipe as is ought to produce a moist cake. I added an extra pat (about 2T) of butter and the resulting cake was incredibly moist. I used only blueberries (1 container) in between the layers, and since the cake was for the birthday of a woman who edits horror fiction, I used an extra bottle of red food color in the frosting. The result: a Blood Red Velvet Cake! It was spectacular, yummy and a great success. Some notes of caution: If you make the cake a day in advance, it will certianly dry out, especially in the fridge. Also, the frosting recipe as written is simply off and would of course be too thin: cream cheese frosting is always a stick of butter to a block of cream cheese. The only reason to use more cream cheese is if you want something that's easy to spread, and cream cheese frosting sill spread evenly, with care.

This was my first red velvet cake. After much research on the genre beforehand, I concluded that dryness is a common issue. Based on a variety of reviews of this and other recipes, I took a leap and tweaked the ingredients: I added an extra stick of butter, as well as an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder for more chocolate flavor and an extra teaspoon of vanilla for a boost in case it still wasn't chocolatey enough. It is fabulous! Moist and really flavorful.

The cake was great. Very moist and chocolatey. I added a bit more cocoa and a little less flour. Left out the fruit and changed the icing to a more "whipped crisco/butter". Fantastic!

Made this cake (first time) for my best friend's Christmas party. It was a big hit. One guest who has lived in the south, became so excited when she heard it was RED velvet cake. Then said it was the best one she ever tasted. I used 2 sticks of butter instead of one. Kept close eye on cooking time. Mine was done in 25 minutes. Those show said it was dry may have over cooked it. I also tweeked the icing. Added another 8 oz of cream cheese & some orange zest, so it wasn't so sweet. I also refrigerated the icing until it firmed up a little. Then I used 4 wooden skewers to hold the cake layers together for traveling. Once at the house for the party, I removed them & covered the holes with fruit. The fruit was a wonderful addition. I also used some red rasberry jam under to top layer. Will defintely make it again.

I followed the cake recipe exactly as written and the cake was fabulous. Some previous reviewers complained that the cake was dry and I can only surmise that they didn't sift and measure the flour, and then sift again. There is absolutely no reason to add any additional butter. I have a convection oven so I lowered the temperature to 325 and kept an eye on the cakes. Truly a beautiful cake. The redness really throws people off!

I've been looking for a good red velvet cake recipe for a long time ~ this one looked promising, especially with some of the changes suggested by previous reviewers. I made it following the recipe with these exceptions: I added an additional half-stick of butter and a total of 2 tablespoons of red food coloring to the cake batter. I didn't add any berries as they're now out of season. I also added an extra 8 ounces of cream cheese to the frosting. The cake itself turned out good, but I think that I will use dark cocoa powder next time instead of the regular as I didn't think it had much chocolate flavor. The frosting, however, turned out good enough to eat by itself with a spoon! Wow ~ I had some leftover and have been sneaking "tastes" from the fridge with frightening regularity. I'll be making this again with the Special Dark cocoa powder and am hoping for even better results!

Here's my twist on the recipe: made cucakes 24 exactly using an ice cream scoop and baked for 25 minutes. Perfectly done. The silver cupcake liners look great with the red cake. Most people complained of dryness - I added 1/3 cup more buttermilk. Used no taste red dye gel - 1 tsp produced a very red cake. Halved the frosting, but still used the 2.5 cup of sugar. All in all a good recipe.

I made this cake for a July 4th party. The berries really went well with the cake and frosting. I live at a high altitude, so I tweaked the recipe a little but the layers sill sank a little during baking. No one else noticed, and the flavors together were delicious.

I've made this three times now, always to rave reviews. This last time I made it three layers and baked for 24 minutes instead of 27 which worked well. I also added another tablespoon of food coloring, which made the red brighter in a really pleasing way. Next time I would take another poster's advice and add another stick of butter, which would make it denser and richer. I beat the butter, sugar and eggs longer this time, which made the layers taller and a bit lighter. Better for presentation and texture. The batter is also quite thick and doesn't look like it is filling the cake pans at first, but it all works out in the end.

The red velvet cake was AWFUL - dry and bland tasting. Maybe it needs more butter or some oil. And the colour was a let-down. I was expecting vibrant red and it turned out looking like an ordinary chocolate cake. I was very excited to make this and it turned out to be a huge disappointment.The icing was so-so. A little on the greasy side.

First time recipe and it sure was a big hit at work. The berries was such a delight, I know I'll make a believer of my No.1 critic at work, a friend who doesn't like sweets. Used 2, 8 X 2 pans and baked at 325 degrees for 40 minutes , added a 1/4 cup of shortening (for moist). Used blackberries instead of blueberries (I took the wrong bag).......But definitely a keeper, part of my repertoire.

I made this cake as cupcakes instead of a whole cake and added some oil as suggested by other readers. The result was great!! I got an idea from a Washington Post article which was to put the frosting in a ziploc bag and snip the corner to then pipe the icing on top of the cupcakes. I then dipped the cupcakes in blueberries to cover the top. They were rather easy to make compared to assembling an whole cake!! The article called them red, white and blueberry. The guests at my brunch loved them and they could also be perfect for fourth of july!

I love this recipe. I make it so much. Friends and family always request it for barbecues and parties. It also makes great cupcakes. I often leave out the food colouring if it's not for a special occasion, and the berries too, and I increase the cream cheese and powdered sugar in the frosting by a lot. It always turns out beautifully and is hugely popular.

i love this cake! after having such delicious red velvet cupcakes at one of my favorite bakeries in new york, i've been searching for the right red velvet cake recipe, and this is the one! it's so moist and delicious. i added an extra 6 oz cream cheese to the frosting so that i was able to use it straight away, without refrigeration, plus, i like the cream cheese flavor more than the butter flavor. i will use this recipe again and again, no doubt.

I must echo the voices of others who recommended the doubling, or even tripling of the food coloring. The redder the better! I think I used an entire bottle. Red and velvety. It was a huge hit.

I have made this cake on two occasions and it is a stunning crowd pleaser. I rated it 4 forks because as stated it is perfectly acceptable, that being said of course you can do things to it. I have taken the suggetion from GA and add 2Tbls of butter flavored crisco and yes I double the food color and cocoa, but you don't have to. The icing could benefit from extra powdered sugar and I can't fit 3 each 1/2 pints of berries in this cake even when I do bake it in 10 inch pans.I usually pipe a border on the top edge to create a boundry for the berries. Don't give yourself a headache and try to bake and ice this cake in the same day, it will slip and slide unless the layers are refrigerated or outside on a cold day.

I see you are from Toronto, so I won't take offense! Red velvet cake is a very, very common recipe, particularly in the American South. There's not much information about its origins, but it is a very traditional recipe, not just a choolate cake that has randomly been dyed red.

I made this for a potluck and everyone LOVED it! I thought the cake was still too dry even after adding 1/4 C vegetable oil,maybe I will add more next time. The frosting became runny also but everyone thought it was beautiful with the blueberries and raspberries added on top and around the sides. Overall I thought it was a good cake and will make it again with a few adjustments.

This was simply delicious. I made it for two events last weekend (my grandma's birthday and Easter). The first cake I added 1/3 cup of vegetable oil ... it turned out nice and moist but maybe too moist - it was hard to handle and stuck to everything (and difficult to frost as well). So the second cake I added less (because I agree that the cake would be too dry without it) - 1/4 cup of vegetable oil. I also added 3 more tablespoons of cocoa powder which made it perfect! Both cakes were delicious!

This recipe was great for cupcakes. I made this for a bridal shower I hosted about two years ago and they made a beautiful presentation at the buffet table. The cupcakes were gone before the night was over! I will make it next time with the suggestions from others to add oil in addition to butter and extra food coloring or use 1 T of Wilton's food coloring gel instead. One recommendation I would make is to use Patti LaBelle's recipe for cream cheese frosting. It is one of the best cream cheese frosting I have ever tasted. It is absolutely devine with this recipe!

This cake is great, I would highly recommend it! I read most of the reader reviews before making it, and I did follow several folks' advice to add some oil to the wet ingredients. I added 1/3 C to the buttermilk mixture, and the cake texture was really nice. I didn't think more than 1/3 C was necessary. I used the Wilton jarred food coloring, and 1 T was plenty - do not add more if you use the Wilton brand, the color was deep and perfect. Because blue- and raspberries are not in season yet, I used strawberries instead, which was delicious. I thought the frosting was perfect when prepared as written - it was not too runny for me at all, and I even had enough leftover to pipe a shell border around the edges. The final alterations I made were for my diabetic mother-in-law, as this was her birthday cake: I used Splenda Baking Blend in place of sugar and neufchatel in place of cream cheese. I normally would not make such substitutions, but I have to say the cake was delicious all the same. Next time I will make it with the real thing and the prescribed berries! This is a great recipe.

this was a great recipe. i've now made it twice, but with tweeks. i used 3 tbs of cocoa powder, 1/2 cup vegetable oil (as suggested by several users), and 2 oz of food coloring to achieve that deep red color. i folded in the vanilla/vinegar at the end as suggested. the cake stayed moist for a LONG time, and was good to the last bite. for the frosting, you need atleast 4 cups of powdered sugar for each 1/2 lb of cream cheese to get a stiffer consistency.

This is the best Red Velvet cake I've baked for sure. I took the advice of another reviewer and omitted the butter and replaced it with 1-1/2 cups of oil. The frosting was good - but just too runny. Will find another cream cheese frosting in the future. The cake is a "keeper".

I LOVE this cake! It came out better than the red velvet cake I had in Atlanta last year. Using cake flour makes a huge difference in the fine texture of the cake - like velvet. However, I did take the advice of one cook and added 2/3 cup oil in addition to the butter. Without it, I do believe the cake would have been dry - I agree that the refridgeration also tends to dry it out so store it well sealed. I also baked this as a sheet cake in a 9 X 13 inch glass dish because I took it to the office where I needed to have many pieces to feed the whole group. It came out fine, but took less time to bake - also used less frosting. As recommended, I also added an entire large bottle of red food coloring in order to achieve the correct color red and it came out perfect. I don't think the 2T of color mentioned in the recipe would be enough.

I served this cake for my fiance's birthday and there were rave reviews. I've had subsequent requests to make it again.

My family has made this recipe for four generations. Our recipe does the following (guarantee it makes it better, too): use 2 sticks of butter, use at least 1 oz (1 bottle) of food coloring--I use two; make a paste of the cocoa and food coloring and add to sugar mixture. Combine the vinegar and soda (but don't mix til right before you add it), stir, and add the the batter as the last addition. Doing the last step guaratees the cake rises a bit more. Cream cheese icing is okay, but the best for this cake is a simple cooked icing (don't gag at the ingredients--it's very good). Combine 5T flour and 1 c milk in a saucepan and cook (stirring constantly) on stovetop til thick. Cool. Mix together 2 sticks of butter, 2 c pwd sugar and 1 t vanilla. Add cooled milk and flour mixture and beat til smooth. You do need to beat the icing a lot. KitchenAid makes better work of it. Enjoy. You won't be disappointed.

OK, here's my review - Part 2 (see below for Part 1). It turned out very well. When the cake was cut I could certainly tell that the the icing filled a huge cavern in the center of the cake, but no one else did. The fruit and everything made this a great cake. Here's a hint if you are making this for someone's birthday and want to write HAPPY BIRTHDAY to Whomever but don't want to write on the cake because of the berries on top. Melt some bakers chocolate, pour onto a sheet of wax paper, freeze until it hardens, cut chocolate into a rectangle, write your message on the chocolate rectangle using store bought cake decorating icing (in white), then prop it up on the pile of berries. Looks great. Everyone thought the cake was from a bakery. YUM.

Couple of things about this cake: First, I used two 7 inch pans instead of 9 (as the recipe suggests) because I wanted a taller cake. It takes a good 10 minutes more baking time because of the depth of the batter. Secondly, I didn't flour one of the pans enough and, guess what, it STUCK! What a surprise! Make sure you flour liberally. Anyway, I think I can save it (frosting can hide a multiple of flaws). The cake is actually for a party on Sunday, so I don't even know how it will turn out once it's frosted and fruited, but I will post again for all you cooks out there who are on the edge of your seats - HA! Oh, I did make the frosting and it was devine.

Not only is this cake a beauty but it tastes amazing and is really easy! My only suggestion is don't omit the vinegar! I made this twice and was put off the first time by the call for vinegar. I didn't have it at the time so I didn't put it in. I turned out well but the second time I made it I put in the vinegar and there was a slight difference. I don't know why. I put some cut up strawberries in as well and everyone raved about this cake. This is a total keeper. The icing reciped would be wonderful for a carrot, spice or apple cake as well.

This was my very first attempt at a layered cake... it turned out really good! Very moist, and simple to make. I omitted the berries as they are not at their best yet. Added about 1/2T MORE cocoa and a little bit more vanilla (to both the cake and the frosting)and 2T of the red food coloring (next time I'll add more). The cakes didn't rise as high as I thought they would (perhaps I overbeat the batter??). I thought it tasted better the same day that the cake was prepared. Next time I will prepare with the berries. Can't wait!

I fiddled a bit with the recipe. Just at a look I also thought the taste would be insipid so together with the vanilla I added half a teaspoon Almond essence (goes wonderfully with berries) plus I added 1/4 cup oil. Didn't put berries in the middle as they become sort of off after a day and my children don't like to bite into soggy fruit. Just piled on top. Make the icing sort of pointy and haphazard - not too neat and tidy, that gives a wonderful look. I also used more cocoa and subtracted a bit of the flour just to keep the balance of the dry ingred. correct. People are begging me to make it again. For some reason, I had to freeze the baked cakes overnight, so I put the frosting onto the frozen cakes the next morn. The cake MUST be at room temperature to eat. Don't eat it cold. At room temperature it melts away in your mouth.

I made this cake for a friend's birthday. It was a HUGE hit. Everyone said it was the best cake they had ever had.

The extra icing was perfect for "folding" around the berries inside.

this cake did not rise for me, altho i followed the directions to a T. the sides rose, but the middle was flat and the taste was rather insipid. I'd recommend the double-chocolate layer cake over this anyday. I've made it twice, both time with perfect results. Over 650 Epicureans can't be wrong!

Wish I would have read all of the tips before I made this cake. Delicious and decadant, I would have tweaked the recipe just a bit... 1. Make sure you use CAKE FLOUR. 2. SIFT the flour- it will be super velvety! 3. I love butter in cakes, but to keep it ultra-moist I would use half butter, half oil next time. 4. The frosting requires much more icing sugar than what the recipe says, or you'll have a droopy mess. With these tips in mind, the next time I make this cake, it will be absolutely out of this world!

I guess the kitchen fairy has decided that I am not a cake baker. This was not a success for me. It was bland and flavorless. I had no problem with the moistness but I guess I wanted a more chocolate flavor. I must confess that I used dried buttermilk reconstituted, since I had it in my pantry. Was that the problem? It just didn't have the pizazz I have come to expect from a good red velvet cake. I also used dutch process cocoa. Was that the problem?

I've been making this cake for more than a year now and it still is the best tasting red velvet cake recipe I've ever tasted, better than THE CAKEMAN RAVEN's Red velvet cake which uses too much oil. This is the one and only Red Velvet cake recipe I use. I add 2 tablespoon of Crisco butter flavor shortening with the butter and sugar. I also double the amount of red food coloring called for in the recipe. Turns out moist and yummy all the time.

In addition to tasting great, this cake is visually stunning. It's not overly sweet and has a nice density. When I served it I got lots of "ooohs and aaahs". I served it at a Christimas holiday meal. It would be fabulous for Valentine's Day and/or Fourth of July.

This cake was delicious. The only thing I did differently was to spread a thin film of frosting to the underside of the top layer of the cake before placing onto the berries, to ensure it would not get soggy. I do think there was an excessive amount of frosting -this recipe yields a generous 1/2 inch thick coating on all sides.

I made this cake precisely like the recipe states and it boiled all over my oven. Not sure that the high altitude of Colorado can handle both baking powder and baking soda in this recipe without creating a lab experiment. I have a similar recipe called Waldorf Astoria Red Cake that does not include the baking powder and uses 2 ounces of red coloring and turns out fine.

I thought this cake was very moist for a cake made from scratch! I used water instead of the red food coloring so the cake was a light brown in color, but I don't think anyone noticed!

This cake was absolutely delicious! My friend served it at her New Year's party - what a hit! I will attempt to make it very soon, hopefully with the same yummy results.

I made this for my significant other's birthday, as it was his special request. I left out the berries and just stuck with cake and icing. The cake overall was excellent, but too much for just two people to eat while it was still good - we ended up giving half of it away. I also had a ton of icing left over (well, perhaps a cup and a half), so you might want to take that into consideration when making your own cake.

Tried adding oil to the recipe as suggested, but it still came out too dry. But I did add more butter and sugar to the icing as was also suggested, and it came out great. Except for being too dry, the cake did have a great taste.

We made the cake for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful, the hit of the dessert trays. Not dry at all but moist and very flavorfull so I am puzzled by the other reviews. We used cake flour and organic buttermilk.I also used Wilton red coloring ,the color was great and there wasn't enough left to see if it was dry the next day. Use top quality ingredients and you will get a top quality cake

I tried this recipe for the first time for Thanksgiving and my family loved it. I used some of the tips that I read from others who had tried it. I added about 1/2 cup of vegetable oil and the cake was nice and moist. I also added about 1\3 cup extra sugar and used some Wilton's Christmas red gel food dye and a teaspoon of double strength red dye from Smart and Final and the cake was a beautiful red. I added an extra stick of butter to the icing and doubled the amount of sugar. I used the extra icing to pipe deconrations on the cake. It was beautiful and the raspberries were a tasty addition.

Wow! What a crowd-pleaser. Haven't read all the reviews yet so sure I'm redundant with several. I made this for a party and they raved and raved! I made a little more icing than the recipe mandated (I hate to skimp on icing) but other than that, I followed it to the letter. The fruit/cake combination is fantastic and incredibly impressive. I was giving this web site out several people when they requested the recipe. A definite "must have" in my recipe box!

This cake turned out very moist for me too...soft-as-silk is the key, you have to use cake flour. As for the food coloring, use the food coloring gel made for coloring frosting by Wilton. It's much more concentrated so you don't need as much.

Rating: 4
I have made this cake several times. I am always surprised when some of the viewers say it turns out dry. I have found when I bake cakes that Pilsbury Softasilk bleached flour works really well. I still sift the flour like the recipe says, and it should turn out just fine.

I used a whole bottle of red food coloring and followed others advice about doubling icing. I also put in some apple sauce mixed with a 1/4 tsp cinnimon. I love red Velvet cake it's one of my favorites so i'll be making this again for my Dads birthday!

A good cake but not the best I've ever had. Followed the advice of other reviewers and substituted oil for butter - didn't seem to make the cake any moister since it was a bit dry to me - also doubled the icing which was needed. Added pecans to icing as well but didn't include the berries as I am not a berry fan.

This cake was excellent - I followed the recipe with the changes made by previous commentaries, ie double the frosting, more food coloring and the addition of oil, which I believe made the cake velvety and spongy. It certainly was a hit.

I followed the previous advice- Add 2/3 cup of oil to wet ingredients. Add 2 oz of red food coloring. Add an additional 2 T of cocoa by whisking it with the red food color to make the cake's color uniform. I also added a 2nd stick of butter and more powdered sugar to the frosting. The cake was fabulous. I decorated the top with alternating circles of raspberries and blueberries and the cake looked so fancy! My only additional suggestion- I would recommend making 1.5 to 2 times the frosting. Frost the cake once and most likely red flakes will get in the frosting unless you are an expert. Then frost again to give the cake a cleaner presentation.

Rating: 1
This is a just so-so recipe. I was disappointed because the cake lacked moisture and flavor. The icing had a rather bland creme cheese flavor. (I used Philadelphia brand creme cheese, which has always worked well for me in the past.) I am going to make this cake again with the following changes: Add 2/3 C oil to the wet ingredients. Add additional 2 T cocoa to dry ingredients. Add a 2nd stick of butter and more powdered sugar to the icing. I think these changes will make a delicious and attractive cake.

Rating: 4
This is a very good red velvet cake recipe. However, in order to get the true "red" you need to use 2 oz of red food coloring, I know this seems like a lot, but it will come out great. Also to get the red uniform throughout the cake, whisk it together with the cocoa and add both in when you add the liquid ingredients. I made this with a cooked white frosting and got rave reviews!

I made this for a 4th of July party, and it was delicious and very well received (not to mention patriotic with the colorful berries!) I'm making it again today as a birthday cake, so I think I'll place the berries alternately around the rim to make room for a greeting in the middle. I'll also use a little more oil as others have suggested to keep it on the moist side.

The cake is fine, though the cream cheese icing comes out very cream cheesy unless you add more vanilla. The real problem is that it's simply not a real red velvet cake. It's red, and it's cake, but it's not red velvet, and it doesn't taste like it.

I made this cake for Thanksgiving this year and it was a big hit. Everyone loved it! I didn't add the berries because I wanted to go more traditional, though I will next time. I added chopped walnuts to the frosting (delicious). The cake was just a little dry, no else thought so though. I used 1/4 cup of oil, next time maybe I will use 1/3. I might have over mixed... it's been a few years since I made a cake from scratch.

I've been spoiled by absolutely wonderful recipes on this website in the past, but this one was horrible. The cake was flat (despite sifting the dry ingredients), and the taste was not as rich as it should be. I don't recommend this one at all - an unusual feeling for such a great resource!

This recipe was very easy to follow and I got many compliments from dinner guests and coworkers. I took the advice from another comment and I added a little oil (1/4 cup) to the recipe and it turned out great! I didn't find the cake dry at all. The berries and cream cheese frosting were great together, and it was a good looking cake! I'm plannning to make it again for a family function.

I made two cakes and on one of them I was too lazy to sift the flour... I ended up with a cake that was half an inch thick and was more like a cakey brownie but without the chocolate. the one that I sifted turned out okay though... I tried making it healthier and using nonfat cream cheese, but the frosting didn't come out as thick as it looks in the picture. I'm not sure if that's because I beat it for too long, or because of the cream cheese. the friend i made it for said it tasted good though!

A dish beyond compare with my changes! I made a practice cake the week before my dinner party. The cake was dry beyond belief. The frosting and the fruit were the only things that saved it (I could barely give it away.) Second version...I made a german chocolate cake instead of what the recipe called for and added red food coloring paste. The frosting and fruit were the same. I was told by over half my guests that "it was the best cake they ever had." Beautiful presentation!

My friend and I have sought out to make the perfect red velvet cake, and I would say this came close. The blueberries and raspberries really make the cake something special. However, the redness never seems to come out as deep a red I would have hoped. And adding more food coloring didn't seem to make a difference. Any suggestions?

This was not that difficult to make and it would have been gorgeous but the heat was a bit much for this cake. (Strange, because I found it as part of a summertime menu.) The whole thing got a bit melty, but it tastes great. I didn't find that the leftovers were dry--we kept it in the refrigerator.

Hi I love reading people's comments on this site, that's what makes it such a great resource. I love when people mention enhancements: a little extra fruit, a little whipped cream on the side, a little less sugar. What confuses me is when people give the original recipe 4 forks, and then write that they had to double the eggs or oil, or add baking powder, or reduce the flour. That's a pretty essential problem with the recipe and don't see how it would then rate 4 forks. The changes would make it so I'm sure, but the original is rated perfect?

Sorry folks....hosted a dinner party and used this for dessert. What a disappointment. I actually followed the recipe as is.....without the tweaks suggested. It was dry and tasted like flour.

This was a beautiful cake inside and out. WOW -- what a spectacular presentation! However, I agree that it was just a bit dry. I think I'll add 1/3 cup of vegetable oil to the batter per another rater's suggestion. It really is delicious as is, but I prefer my cakes a little more moist. I added one more tablespoon of cocoa for extra chocolatey-ness. The addition of berries is ingenious! I will gladly make this again and again!!

As a caveat, I have to say that I am not a big fan of red velvet cake, which is why I rated it only two forks and will likely not make it again. With that being said, it was a beautiful cake for the 4th of July. I had to use strawberries rather than raspberries due to unavailability of the latter. Otherwise, the recipe was followed. I served it at a work barbecue and received lots of compliments on its look and taste.

Rating: 0
I can't give this recipe any "forks" because I cheated...and cheated badly. I've never been able to make really good cake from scratch, and have had even less success since I moved from sea level to a high altitude locale, so, I...uh...used buttermilk cake from a mix and added the cocoa and red food coloring. *ducking and running from the purists*. That worked pretty well, actually. The cream cheese frosting, however, is simply wonderful-- creamy and not overwhelming and I will use it again and again for a variety of things.

I've made other Red Velvet cakes and this one is the best of the bunch by far. I did add a bit more red food coloring, and used cider vinegar because I didn't have white vinegar. Results were great. I also think good quality cocoa in the batter is key.

I brought this cake to a fourth of July bbq at a co-worker's house, and I received very warm compliments on it. However, I myself was a little disappointed in the results. The cake was...less than red. Maybe you don't want to hear this, but the color of the cake prompted a name that referrs to a part of the female anatomy that probably wouldn't be welcome on a culinary website. I left out the rasberries, but the blueberries were a wonderful compliment to the sour cream frosting; I used neufchatel for the frosting, and it turned out great. I also put a few extra tablespoons butter so that I would have a little more frosting and to cut the sour cream; but, since I made three 8-inch layers instead of two 9-inch layers, I still wished I had a little more frosting. I don't know if I'll make this recipe again, but I might make the frosting recipe for a chocolate cake.

Perfectly moist and so flavorful! I took this to a potluck this evening where it stole the show, with some people returning for a second piece. Will definitely make this again.

I appreciate the reviews of others. I made this cake for a special friends birthday, but was were not totally impressed. I grew up a Southerner, but had never made a Red Velvet Cake.

i was very surprised. in the past i've never gotten good results from b.smith's recipes. so i was skeptical - but the pic in the magazine was so beautiful - and i know that all bon app recipes are tested, so i decided to give it a shot. i did make several modifications - i doubled the eggs, used dutch processed cocoa and used 8" pans to end up with 3 layers instead of two. for the frosting i added an extra stick of butter and 2 pounds of pow'd sugar and reduced the vanilla extract to 2 tsp (to cut the cream cheese flavor - and also to make sure i had enough frosting) the results were very good. the cake looked just like the pic - and it was deelish! the berries added another dimension to the flavor of the cake. i've had many, many red velvet cakes and this one was pretty darn good. this would be a great cake to have at a 4th of july party. try it, the recipe is easy and the results are great! adds a great twist to a southern fave.

I got raves on this cake - from native southerners! They couldn't believe this was my first attempt at RVC. Everyone had a piece and took some home. I was concerned that it might be a little dry so I added 1/3 cup of vegetable oil. I also doubled the cocoa and added 1/2 tablespoon more food coloring. For the frosting I added extra vanilla and about 8 oz of white choc to cut down the cream cheese flavor. Ended up with a yummy creamy mild frosting but it was a little loose because of the extra vanilla. I am told a tablespoon of crisco helps this problem. The berries added the perfect extra dimension.

I had always wanted to try a red velvet cake and this one was irresitable. It was easy to make and beautiful but to be honest, I think I am not a true fan of red velvet cake. I would like a stronger chocolate flavor than this cake has. Also, it was a tad drier than my preference. But...the frosting was fantastic and it was beautiful so I will definately make again, and probably make my favorite chocolate cake recipe with the berries and frosting some time, maybe 4th of July.

This recipe is simply delicious. The berries add a sweetness to the wonderful icing and take the cake's flavor to a whole new level. To the cook that asked the question earlier--yes, you were the victim of an unfortunate baking experience. RVC should have a light chocolate flavor that is offset by the icing. I've had a bad one before, too, but don't let that stop you from trying again!

This is just a question from someone who's only had red velvet cake once in her life: I thought r.v.c was awful when I tried it (and so did my partner) but I love its striking appearance. I'm wondering if the friend who made it just had a bad recipe or made a mistake -- is it really supposed to taste so much of baking soda? Is it an acquired taste? I'd like to make this but I won't try until I find out if what I ate was the real thing or just a really horrid anomaly.

Yum! What a great cake! I love the berries with the red velvet, it is a delicious combination. I made this for father's day and everyone loved it. The cake is probably just fine as is, but I will share the changes I made. I added 1 extra tablespoon of cocoa to the cake mix, and only used about half the red food coloring it called for. I thought the color of the cake came out perfect. Also, I was concerned the icing was a little to thin so I added another 1/4 cup of powdered sugar. It was so gorgeous when completed. I will make again soon!

Made it in a quarter sheet pan with only two layers. The only change I made was to brush on a little warmed seedless raspberry preserves in the layer then add the frosting. I omitted the berries inbetween. All 30 of the ladies loved the cake and many requested the recipe.
