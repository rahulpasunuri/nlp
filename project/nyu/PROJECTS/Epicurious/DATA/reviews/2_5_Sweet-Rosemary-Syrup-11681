Good, but far too much vanilla - I found it overwhelming and a bit strange. Next time I will use 1/4 teaspoon or less, if at all. Otherwise, the rosemary flavor is good for soaking cakes or just topping with soda water and drinking.

Simple, a great use for epic rosemary plants, and would be good in cocktails!
