I used this recipe as a base as I just was looking for something to kinda hold onto for my own recipe. Im a pro Chef so I saw this recipe and instantly thought it was a winner for a base for my own. I just changed the fruit I put in with what I had available at home. So I left out the blueberries and instead put in pommegranite, and I put in dried figs, golden raisins, raisins, dried and fresh cranberries and instead of cayenne I put in Chipolte powder and smoked paprika. I used Cherry juice to instead of cranberry. I did though put the balsamic in at the end, but I reduced it first to bring out the sweetness of it and then I canned and water sealed them to send out as gifts. I ended up with 8 pint jars and started with 12 cups of cranberries and then the dried and fresh Colorado apples I picked at the end of the summer made up the rest. Great recipe on its own as well.

This can't be beat for flavor and ease of preparation. I made the recipe as written and served it with cheese. It was a real hit. If you can't find the dried blueberries try it with dried currents.

A wonderful addition to pork, turkey and cheese. Wonderful addition to dinner ad appetizers.

This was great - easy and much more interesting than other cranberry sauces I've tried - and I've tried a bunch. I couldn't find dried blueberries, so I used dried cherries. Worked great. The family loved it.

This is fabulous!!! I've now made it for 2 Thanksgivings and everyone loves it as a more interesting/delicious accompaniment to the turkey & stuffing. I like it even as a fruity dessert the next day cold or warmed. The recipe is excellent as written... but I also like to add slivered orange rind, and have even tried it with thin slices of a whole orange. Both great.
