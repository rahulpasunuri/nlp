Same as the previous reviewer on the frosting - I wanted something fast my kids would like and wanted to avoid the heavy cream, and this was flavorful and creamy - made with less sugar and high quality cocoa and it pleased a bunch of teenagers and the adults. Will definitely use often.

Just made the frosting (only) and we loved it! Like previous reviewers I used 3Cups of sugar not 5. Also added the dash of kosher salt. Very yummy- will def.be making this again.

Very nice recipe. The cake turned out very nice and soft and was soooo chocolateee. I had to tweak it a little though. I added 6 eggs and used butter instead of oil. I think there's too much sugar in the frosting. I used only half the quantity of sugar for the frosting and that itself was so sweet. All in all.....my cake was lovely :)

My five year old grandson loves to bake, so we have spent the last six months baking a cake nearly every weekend. We have tried lots of different recipes - and many more difficult than this - but this is our absolute favorite! We use Hersheys extra dark chocolate and strong coffee instead of the water. Always a hit with the family and my grandson thinks it is our big secret that it has "no eggs!"

I didn't realize there were no butter or eggs in the recipe until after I started making it. Had I known this, I would have made a different chocolate cake. However, not a bad cake if you are looking for an easy recipe.

Versions of this recipe has been around since the depression. Cooks made due with what they had on hand; eggs, milk and butter were not always affordable/available. My version calls for less oil (2/3 cup vegetable oil) and more cocoa (2/3 cup)and no chips. I have been making this cake for 30 years and I'm always asked for the recipe. It's so good and so nostalgic; makes you appreciate simpler times.

I only made the frosting, and it was absolutely amazing! However, when I reached the part when you're supposed to add the next two cups of sugar, I tried it and decided to leave them out. I think it tasted much better that way- sweet but not too much so.

This is a simple, fast and delicious chocolate cake. Using what I had on hand, I used Special Dark cocoa powder and the cupcakes are so dark and rich. Also used two cups of brewed cold coffee and added the one egg as recommended. I sprinkled a few chips onto each cupcake and I think they make it a little something more than just chocolate cake - but can see why they are optional. I added a pinch of kosher salt to the frosting. Chocolate needs salt. This will be our standard need something quick dessert.

I make this every year for my husband's birthday, and every year he requests it again. I could do without the chocolate chips, but he says they "make the cake," so I leave them in. I like other people's suggestions to sub in 1/4 cup liqueur (like a dark rum, or maybe amaretto) for some of the water. I'll try that next time.

Did not make the cake - made the Fannie Farmer Chocolate Buttermilk Cake - am rating the frosting which was incredible - substituted buttermilk for the milk/cream but left the rest as is - very rich and creamy and not too sweet. Used for mini-cupcakes for school - the teachers and children loved them.

The frosting is so amazing and is my go to recipe for chocolate frosting. The cake, however, needs work and tastes more like chocolate muffins than chocolate cake. It's very dense and heavy- I like a lighter cake. I followed recipe to a tee.

I've made this recipe many, many times exactly as written and loved it. Recently I found out I have celiac disease. I just made this cake exactly as written but substituted the flour with a gluten-free flour mix that included xanthan gum. It still tasted amazing so I wanted to let other celiacs know that they can still use this recipe.

I hated this cake. It got 2 forks because it was moist, but nothing for taste. It tastes just like those boxed cake mixes, which I've always hated. I've never made a dairy free cake before... I guess this is the icky, oily taste you get when you don't use dairy. If you like cake-mix cake though, you'll love this one.

The frosting was excellent in this recipe. It made a large amount of and it was rich and delicious. The cake, however, was very disappointing in flavor. It lacked a deep, chocolately flavor and sweetness. The texture was really nice (very moist) as was the appearance, but it fell flat in the taste category. Next time I might add some espresso powder, more sugar and more cocoa to the recipe. I did not use chocolate chips in the cake (didn't have them), but added an additional 1/4 cup of sugar and 2 squares of melted bittersweet chocolate. It probably would have been better with the chocolate chips, as it would have helped to mask the lackluster cake flavor. I would make this again with the alterations mentioned above as the texture and presentation were great and the frosting is a real winner.

Rating: 4
The recipe sounded good but it needed a little tweaking. Something I added to my version of this cake was some strong coffee and dark rum. Just replace some of the water with these flavorful additions. It really brings out the flavor of chocolate. Just add maybe a quarter of a cup of each. YUM! Give it a try...you won't be disappointed.

This cake is great, one of the most moist chocolate cake recipes that I've found, along with the chocolate stout cake on this site. I definitely recommend making it the day before, since the taste and texture improve overnight. It is absolutely necessary to LINE THE CAKE PAN WITH PARCHMENT PAPER! Despite thoroughly greasing the pans, half of the cake stuck to the bottom the first two times that I made it, which was sad because it was otherwise perfect. Luckily, guests didn't notice and it was gone quite quickly. I've combined it with both buttercream and cream cheese frosting with good results.

This is a great non-dairy cake recipe (didnt make the frosting). I made these for my brother's birthday (he is allergic to milk). I made them as cupcakes but otherwise followed the recipe and combined them with a different frosting (from Chocolate Fudge Torte). The cake was moist and held together well for frosting. Plus, no one could believe they were dairy free. And my brother was happy to have something that tasted so good. To make them dairy free just be sure the chocolate chips you buy are diary free. Any high quality semisweet chip usually is.

Like some other users I did put in one egg with the water. I used half Splenda/half sugar. This cake was great. Very moist. The only thing I would say is I would use a Bundt pan next time, not three layers as they were a bit short I thought or perhaps just two layers. I filled the layers with seedless raspberry preserves and dusted it with powdered sugar. I was very pleased.

This was an awful recipe. I did everything to the tiniest detail and the cake was crumbly and fell apart. It tasted fabulous but completely fell apart. I made an extra one to see if I had done something worng but it was another disaster. The frosting is a fabulous recipe however!

I was skeptical because I never like cakes from scratch. I find them dry and tasteless, but this cake is amazing. I'm surprised at how moist and flavorful it is. I will definitely be making it again.

I listened to other reviewers and added one egg which replaced a part of the water. I also made these into cupcakes which were perfectly done at 25 minutes. The egg kept the cakes from being too crumbly and they had just the right consistency for frosting. I did not add the chocolate chips and I did not make this frosting. I though the flavor was chocolaty and I did not notice the corn oil flavor that others have mentioned.

I've made this for my husband's last four birthdays. I just made it for my son who will be 2 yrs old. I used 1/4c oil and substituted 3/4 cup buttermilk. It made the cake even better - try it!

I love this recipe. It is easy, inexpensive, and grows moister as it ages rather than drier as butter cakes tend to do. It rises to the occasion whether paired with a mom style powdered sugar frosting or a fancy ganache. I try others but always return to this cake.

For years my husband has insisted that boxed cake mixes taste better than homemade cakes. I finally found the recipe that made him "eat his words"--this cake is super moist and so easy to make. I used a canola oil I had on hand and it didn't have any funny aftertaste the corn oil might leave. Tastes wonderful just sprinkled with confectioners' sugar.

I can't explain since how many years I've been looking for this recipe. My family is strictly vegetarian, they don't even eat egg. So, all the eggless cake recipes I had were not so good and very heavy to eat. This is a wonderful cake recipe, moist, fluffy, chocolaty....it's delicious, finally my search is over. Yes, you can taste a little bit of the corn oil, but with the frosting you can't tell. Also, i went for another chocolate frosting also in this site. This is the fourth time i'm making this cake, and always i get rave comments about it...it's just perfect. I reduced the amount of chocolate chips, but i think the texture could be better withouth them. It's absolutely delicious.

I made this for an office bday, and it received RAVE reviews. One coworker went so far as to say that it was the best chocolate cake she had had in her life.

Here were my mods: I reduced the chocolate chips to 1 cup and made the CHOCOLATE-ORANGE BUTTERCREAM found elsewhere on this site.

This is a great cake and super easy to make. I used 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 C. less sugar, and added 2 t. of instant espresso powder. I also used a 9x13 pan and the cake turned out moist and yummy and I can't stop eating it!

This is a fine cake. Moist as is any cake made with oil not butter. Impossible to have this turn out dry and crumbly. I added the chocolate chips directly to the batter. The cake would be fine without them, as well, but my daughters love having the chips in the cake. I used a different frosting and added a bit more cocoa to the batter. I also added the egg to the water (see below somewhere). The huge cake is gone, after just 2 days.

This recipe is AMAZING. You can make it with all your normal household ingredients, and it makes a FANTASTIC, RICH, MOIST chocolate cake!! The chocolate chips can be easily left out, and you won't even notice. I have made this many times, never with a glitch. So simple, you won't beleive it!!

Wow. It's hard to describe how bad this cake was. It tasted more of oil than chocolate (which is amazing, given how much chocolate is used). I thought it tasted awful and looked unappetizing. My husband described it as "different", and when I told him I chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients, he said "I didn't know you kept tar in the kitchen". Even my daughter said, "It isn't too bad" and "at least you tried". I would suggest you try any other chocolate cake recipe on this website before making this one.

I agree with some of the other reviewers who've said this cake lacks any subtlety and tastes "tinny" because of the oil. It IS chocolatey, moist and dense, but I just think it tastes yucky, and the frosting tastes too much of cocoa. While this would be a good snack cake, I threw mine out and re-made my birthday cake with a delicate, rich and tasty devil's food (Devil's Food Cake with Brown Sugar Buttercream) and modified this frosting to make it fluffier and less one-dimensional.

Just made this last night for dinner with friends and it came out great! Everyone raved how moist and chocolately it was. Took the advice of others and reduced the number of chocolate chips and did the water + egg to 2 cups line. Also made in two 9 inch pans just had to cook longer but had to be careful when I was taking out of pans and moving to platter because it seemed like it would come apart! I also made with the chocolate buttercream frosting recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/14545. Yummy!

I just made this today, and all I can say is...WOW! What a fantastic, no-fuss chocolate cake! It was moist, rich and chocolatey! Having read some of the other reviews (and seeing the suggestion of adding an egg yolk)I took it one further, and when I measured out my water, I first cracked an egg into the measuring cup and then filled up to the 2c. mark-so in essence, I substituted an egg for a portion of the water. I had absaloutely no problem with crumbs as some other reviewers mentioned-whether it was the egg (I doubt it) or the fact I used cake release (see wilton.com discussion forums for recipe)to prepare my pans..I don't know. I didn't use the icing recipe as I have my own family favourite. If you are looking for a great, easy to make chocolate cake recipe, this is DEFINITELY the one to try.

Absolutely delicious! I used vegetable oil instead of corn oil & used parchment paper in my 3 pans. I didn't have a problem with sticking to the pan, but did have the crumbling problem like a lot of other reviewers. I made the recipe only having read a few of the reviews...looking back over them ALL now, it's funny to see that a LOT of people said there is too much frosting & not to make as much....I made an EXTRA half recipe for my cake! (But then, I am a serious chocoholic!) I served this at a party (I decorated it to make it prettier) & it was a huge hit! I will definitely make it again, but may try an egg yolk added in to help with crumbling as suggested by earlier reviewers.

I have made this cake many times. It is always requested by my husband for his birthday, and it works well as a sheet cake to cut up and make boats, trains and space ships for my kids. I have made it with half canola oil and half applesauce, and it works fine.

I made this using all the ingredients as specified in the recipe but added 1 tsp. of baking powder and 1 tsp. of cinnamon as recommended by a previous reviewer. I baked it in a 9x13 pan for 45 mins. It was very flavourful but I, personally, found it to be a little on the greasy side. I am wondering if it would be better, next time, if I used half applesauce, for half of the oil. I know this has worked for me in other recipes but they all used eggs. Does anyone have any idea if this would cause the recipe to suffer from this switch in ingredients? It really is a tasty cake and, like the previous reviewer commented, you can lick the bowl without any worries because of no eggs! BONUS!!!

OMG this is a delicious cake! Best I'VE ever tasted. but do add more sugar... i tasted it and it tasted a bit like corn oil. So add a few more spoonfulls of sugar and you'll be good. its rich and dense... way beyond compare!!! hehe. but anyway. i made it in a brownie pan and cut it in half to stack it. so a little more baking time if you do that.... and its great because there's no eggs so you can lick all the batter you want with out getting sick! four forks, definetly!!!

I love this cake recipe! However, I do not make it as a layer cake I use it as a bundt cake (you will need to increase cooking time to 45-60 minutes) And I either dust with powdered sugar or a simple sugar glaze.

I do not know why there are so many bad reviews for this recipe. This is a fail-proof cake for me, and my family absolutely loves it. So easy, and so good. I will agree with previous raters in that the icing is a bit much-too sweet and too rich-but if you frost it lightly you shouldn't have any problems. I have had a hard time getting it out of the pan without it falling apart, but that is probably due to my impatience. I recommend everyone to try it or give it another try following the recipe exactly.

I chose this recipe for its simplicity - perfect for a baking session with a toddler. Oh dear, how I wish I had not bothered. Simple to make, but the end result was deeply disappointing. I pride myself on my cake baking, so I was rather surprised that the cake disintegrated once I removed the layers form the tins. I must have done something wrong but the "cake" was so bland that I won't bother to try again.

I'm not a big fan of chocolate cake, but this cake was really moist (but yes, a little crumbly) and good, not too sweet. I'm making it for a co-worker's birthday.

I have made this recipe many times now, with consistently excellent results. It is always chocolately, moist and delicious.

Not forking because I didn't follow the recipe to the letter, but the variation turned out yummy! Made half the batter for an 8x8 square pan.

Definitely more of a box-cake cake texture than a fine-crumbed masterpiece, but much better than I expected! Perfect for my friends who are vegan!

pretty darn good if you're in the mood for chocolate. i didn't want to bother with the layers so i made it in a 9x13in pan and cooked it for 35 min. i also reduced the choc chips to 1cup (and found that to be a little much still) and made half of the frosting. you can reduce the sugar in the frosting by a lot, in my opinion. i made this on sunday and 3 days later it's still good (moist too).

I might have been spoiled from my years as a concierge where the best restaurants in Dallas became a routine (my fave still being the Abacus) but I was quite disappointed, considering all the great reviews this cake received. I would give it a 4 out of 10. It's better than a Winn Dixie cake, but still too close to a boxed cake. I you have a sensitive pallet, don't waste your time, but if you really want a real chocolate cake try the Warm Chocolate Cake With Whipped Cream.

I'm glad I didn't try this cake for a special occasion. It was a passable lunchbox dessert possibility and maybe even a good quick cake to make in a bind...but not my favorite. Frosting too sweet, cake had a pasty mouth feel. Chocolate chip layers added a nice strong flavor though; and if you want a tall impressive looking cake that's not heavy this would be one to consider.

Easy, delicious, moist! The chocolate chips added nice texture (but I did use a little less than called for). As recommended by other reviewers, I cut down on the sugar in the frosting (used 4 cups instead of 5)...it turned out PERFECT! I also cut down the sugar in the cake batter by 1/2 cup - worked great! (we don't like our desserts to be overpoweringly sweet) I used parchment paper to line the bottom of my pans to avoid sticking problems. Lastly, I didn't split the batter among 3 pans...I used two 9-inch pans (with 2-inch high sides) and the two layers turned out at the perfect height for a traditional layer cake. For a prettier presentation, consider decorating the cake with sprinkles, nuts, or piped roses - something to liven up the appearance!

I wouldn't give this cake 4 forks because I agree with the reviewer about the oil. I also prefer butter. But I can't argue with everyone who tried them! I will make again.

I really loved this cake. It was moist and tasty. It's really easy to make. I didn't have time to make the frosting, so I used canned this time. Next time, I will make the real stuff.

Made this as a birthday cake for a 12 year old, served it to three generations and everyone was happy with it. From a baker's perspective it was easy beyond compare, though one of the layers came out lopsided. The frosting was a bit dry for spreading, added milk beyond the extra two tablespoons. Be prepared to want to decorate this cake; it can be boring to the eye. I used icing for a confetti design. For a non-birthday cake I might try some mini chips, sprinkes or cake crumbs.

This cake was great. I made it when my brother and his family visited and he had 2 pieces at each sitting. We did decide that the chocolate chips were too much and in the future I will eliminate them. I especially like the fact that it has no eggs which a friend is allergic to.

Rating: 3
This is a very easy cake to make. The chocolate chips really complete the taste. We do not make it with the icing because it is so good without it. It tastes even better on the second day.

I cut the recipe in half and did 2 10 inch cakes. I was afraid they would be too thin, but they were just fine. I used waxed paper in one pan and not the other to see how well my new pans would do and didn't notice a difference in sticking. I agree with the reviewer who says that oil based cakes taste "tinny." Before I read that review I always just thought oil based cakes tasted more like box cakes. (Usually box cakes require oil, right?) "Tinny" is rather accurate, but if you can eat box cake, you can definitely eat this cake. This cake is MUCH better, and really just as easy.

I made this recipe as cupcakes and got about 3 dozen. They were great! The chocolate chips baked into the cake give great texture.

Rating: 3
was torn between giving this recipe an average rating and a superlative one, because personally this cake made me realise that i don't like oil-based cakes, as they tend to have an odd, tinny flavor about them. but those i served it too can't seem to get enough of it. it was a breeze to whip up, though!

Have made this cake several times. Two things I've learned about it, parchment paper is a must and don't screw with the recipe! Chocolate lovers love this cake. I have cut the recipe in half and made one 9" layer. Worked fine. 1/2 recipe can feed 6 -- very rich.

Rating: 4
This cake was WONDERFUL! I had no problems with crumbling or sticking. I was skeptical about the chocolate chips, but ended up really enjoying the extra texture they gave. I'd absolutely make it again.

I made this cake for my husband's 37th birthday. He requested something moist, and this recipe certainly delivered. My one glitch was not allowing the layers to cool long enough before removing them from the pans, but the moistness of the cake allowed me to put the broken pieces back together without a problem! Also, I substituted buttermilk for whole milk in the frosting, which I would do again. We savored every bite of this delicious cake.

Best chocolate cake

Rating: 3
personally, i find it way too rich and dense. but considering how easy it was to make this cake, i suppose it is worth making again. the frosting is also too sweet for me. btw, i used sunflower oil and it didn't really same to ruin the cake in any way too. also, i 2/3rd the recipe and baked in 1 9 inch round pan because i was too lazy to make a layer cake. i found this to be better as there wasn't too much frosting.

Rating: 4
If you like chocolate you will love this cake. I have made it a million times, and it always turns out great and gets rave reviews. I use parchment paper and 3 pans, and have never had a problem. I often use water or soy milk in the frosting instead of regular milk, and again never a problem. This is a great cake to make for people with egg allergies, as there are no eggs!A friend's son with an egg allergy requested this cake as his Bar Mitzvah present!

Super easy to cook. I used parchment paper and didn't have any difficulty with it sticking. This cake got mixed reviews from those who tried it. Those who were fussy eaters with a discerning taste and sensitive palates didn't like it. Way too intense. However my roomates who go for more punch in there food LOVED it. saying it was the best cake ever. Personally it gives me a headache because its so intense, but its worth it.

My little girl asked for a chocolate cake with vanilla icing for her 4th birthday so I came to Epicurious looking for a simple recipie. I got more than I bargained for with this one - the cake is the perfect easy chocolate cake recipie! The cake was moist, rich and delicious! I made this exactly as called for and based on the comments regarding sticking, used parchment paper on the bottom, buttered and floured it; they came out beautifully. Since we were looking for vanilla icing, I used a cream cheese recipie from this site and it worked well - even cut down on the sweetness a bit. This will be THE basic chocolate cake recipie from now on.

I have made this cake MANY times. It is a chocolate lover's dream. Always use corn oil, NEVER substitute. The Cocoa Frosting is the BEST and it works well with other chocolate cakes. One of our favorites!

I have made this cake nearly every year since it appeared in 1995. It is the only cake my husband ever wants for his birthday. Everybody else loves it, too - even me, and I'm not a big fan of chocolate cake. The batter couldn't be easier to mix. The chocolate chips add a nice kick. And the frosting recipe is nice because it actually makes enough for all three layers, which is not always the case. I like to spread the frosting very smooth on the top, and then finish it off with a dusting of cocoa powder and/or confectioner's sugar, maybe using a doily or a cutout diamond pattern. A true classic.

Appreciated all the tips. Am a guy and don't cook much. Used wax paper and two 9" pans. Cooking time was right. Waited for edges to pull away from pan. Somebody left Soy milk and canola oil in fridge so used that. Seems you can't hurt this recipe'. Next time will try Mayonaise instead of oil,condensed milk instead of whole.

Tries this last night as a quickie to see if it would pass as a dessert for guests. Got home at 7pm and the cake was out of the oven by 8pm. Very easy to make, very moist, and very, very good. Didn't have the sticking problems...sprayed pans with cooking spray, used parchment paper, and sprayed again, using two 9-inch pans. Didn't have all of the ingredients to make the frosting, so I used a white cream cheese frosting instead, which was very good. For those of you who do not like overpowering chocolate, this could be the way to go....as it cuts down on the chocolate, but is still mighty rich. Love the fact that it has no eggs or butter. Timing on the cooking and cooling was just right.

Rating: 3
Very easy recipe. I followed advice of other chefs and used 2 pans, and lots of bakers joy cooking spray. No problems. Would definately make again.

Rating: 2
I listened to everyone's comments and used PAM spray on 2 9" round pans. I set the timer for 15 minutes to cool cakes. Not only did they stick to the pan and completely break apart, but after I pieced it back together and let them cool further on the rack,they fell through the rack and stuck to that as well! What a mess! The ONLY way I would make this again (it's a challenge, and cake tasted delicious) would be if I used parchment paper in the pans and then on the cooling rack as well. Since I ran out of time, I improvised, made a white chooclate pudding, layered cake, pudding, strawberries, more cake and the recommended frosting and made a trifle! Will be serving today.

Call it beginner's luck, but although this is my first "from scratch" cake, it came out wonderful. No problem with sticking. It is beautiful with the frosting piped on the cake.

Without question, the best cake "from scratch" that I've ever made! Usually I have a problem with scratch cakes being too heavy, and/or or too dry. Not this one! I baked in 2 9-inch pans instead of three - no problem. Thanks to the advice of others, I greased the pans very well (with the corn oil, instead of butter) and had no sticking problems. Fantastic!! Great frosting, too!! BEST CAKE EVER.

Excellent and eggless! Served this cake last night after Christmas dinner and it was a huge success. I didn't have trouble with the cakes sticking, but I baked it in two layers and not three.

I have to make this cake at least twice a year because it is my husband's and my daughter's favorite. It is the birthday cake of choice. RE: the sticking to pan....when they say cool cakes for 15 minutes, they mean it!! No more and no less or it will stick!! Good Luck!!

While the cake itself was delicious, it fell completely apart when trying to remove from the pans. Let's just say it looked like a disaster once frosted. Tasted good, looked bad. Next time I try it, I 'll just make the cake and eat it directly from the pan!

Great recipe! I was in a hurry to find a cake recipe using cocoa and found this one, started preparing it, then noticed it had no eggs! Normally I wouldn't have made it since i've never heard of a cake with no eggs, but I had already mixed most of the ingredients and couldn't back off. I was extremely pleasantly surprised that it was DELICIOUS!!!!!! I just had dental work done on that day and had to be careful, but didn't have to as the cake literally melted in my mouth. Great recipe for chocolate lovers allergic to eggs or milk!!!!

The best!!! Easy to make and great taste...what more could you ask for!? I haven't baked a cake since retiring to Florida four years ago. I made it for a neighbor's birthday party tonight and it got rave and double rave reviews. My one hint is to really oil and flour those pans before adding the cake mixture. (That means having a good film of oil on the pan before flouring.) After baking and letting it cool for 15 minutes, I turned them out on plastic wrap and wrap them until the next day when I frosted them. Easy to store.....I would recommend this recipe to anyone who is apprehensive about making a cake from scratch ( and believe me this was far superior to a cake mix!) Enough said!!! Enjoy!

My mother was craving a chocolate cake. She couldn't find a recipe in my cookbook so I thought I'd surprise her by making this cake. It is DELICIOUS!!! It tastes a lot like brownies. It took forever to make though, but well worth it. I didn't have an issue with flaking, actually mine stuck even though I buttered and floured. I didn't use the egg yolk either. For decoration and yummy-ness I added smashed Oreos to the top. MAKE THIS CAKE! YOU'LL LOVE IT!

This cake was incredibly chocolatey and rich. My family loved it! I tried adding the egg yolk like a previous reviewer suggested, and I had no problems with crumbling. I would definitely make this again, but calorie-counters beware -- it's not diet.

I too had to increase baking time, but other than that I find this an easy, scratch cake, that everyone who loves chocolate, loves it! I like it nice and cold too; the chips harden and yum, yum.

I also used 3 8" pans but increased the cooking time by 12 minutes, otherwise it wont be cooked in the center. This cake did come our excellent. I did take extra care in greasing and flouring the pans and had no problem getting them out in 1 piece.The only problem I seemed to have was i frosting the cake. It seemed to want to crumble then. But again, extra care in frosting it and it turned out beautiful.I shaved chocolate curls on the top and served in a pretty domed dish. VERY chocolatey, but delicious.I made it yesterday and today it is just as moist.

I served this cake for my father's birthday celebration and it was delicious. I asked a pastry chef friend how I could avoid the crumbling issue I read about in the reviews. She told me to add one egg yolk (which I did) and it came out perfectly.

Took the advice of the cook from chicago and baked it in three 8" pans. No crumbling problem. I did find the cakes still quite jiggly and undone when specified cooking time was reached, so I had to cook them longer. By the time the middle was done, the edges were slightly tough. Didn't hurt the cake though. I also substituted olive for corn oil with fine results. Delicious frosting on a nice rich chocolate cake.

This would be a fabulous recipe if it were many times as much work-- but it's FABULOUS and QUICK to boot! What a winner!!! I used a combination of white and dark chocolate chips, for added flavor and visual appeal.

This is the second time I've made this cake and now I have finally figured this cake out. I baked it in three 8" round pans, rather than 9" round pans. I sprayed the pans with vegetable spray, lined it with a parchment round and then sprayed it again. The layers came out beautifully. And the taste is delicious. I don't understand how it works without eggs but it is definately the chocolate cake I'll make from now on. Frosting was perfect for it also.

Don't know what to think. I wanted to make this for a very special friend for his birthday. Once I purchased all ingredients and almost started, I realized this recipe has no eggs in cake batter. After consulting with some fellow bakers, we concurred it must be a mistake. Does anyone know if this is a mistake or does the recipe NOT have eggs in batter? Help!~!!

I have made this recipe 5 times now since the recipe was printed in Bon Appetit. It has always turned out great. I have never had a problem getting the cake out of the pan and I strongly believe it is because I evenly distribute the butter and flour when preparing the pans. Presentation of the three layers is not always pretty, but the taste is always GREAT.

Rating: 2
it's chocolate so of course it's yummy, but it somehow lacks the subtlety and refinement that make a cake truly stand out. Still, a good, defacto birthday cake, especially for the undiscriminating palate (small children, for example).

Rating: 3
This is a good basic chocolate cake; especially moist. Two of the layers came out fine, the third did crumble a little. I noticed that the layer that crumbled wasn't quite as deep...so, be careful to evenly distribute batter between the three layers. Also, it's important to let the cake cool for 15 minutes prior to removing cake from pans. Despite this, the frosting hid all sins and the cake looked fine.

Moist,fool-proof recipe. Its classic taste was appreciated by even the bowl lickers! A little heavy on the oil (it can be reduced to 1/2C, then add 1/2C H2o or milk). For a "black forest" twist I made a strawberry-cherry-rum spread and subbed it for a frosting layer. I can't wait for someone else's birthday to come so I can make it again!

This cake is great because it tastes great and I can usually whip this up without having to go to the store for special ingredients and it's quick. Also, it nice to have a cake to serve to my vegetarian friends who don't eat eggs. I use dutch processed cocoa powder which I understand to be neutral and will not result in the necessary reaction with he baking soda which is needed to cause the cake to rise. The last time I made this cake, I made the suggested change of switch to baking powder and double the amount. It turned out fine, but not much different than I remember it looking using the soda the previous times. This may call for a head to head study.

The frosting was FANTASTIC! and there was PLENTY left over. (I only had 4 1/4 cups powdered sugar, but it was enough!) The cake was very chocolate-y and yummy. Lots of compliments. To the previous reviewer: no baking POWDER, just baking soda in this recipe!

My wife and I made this cake for her best friend's birthday. The cake is still talked about today, almost a year later, as for the present... We did make two substitutions. We substituted 1/2 c of apple sauce for 1/2 c of the 1 c of corn oil. We also didn't have any chocolate chips so we simply cut slab of semisweet choclate into hunks and dropped them into the batter.
