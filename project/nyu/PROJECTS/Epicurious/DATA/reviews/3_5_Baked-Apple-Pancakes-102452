Had I skillets that locked, flipping this would have been a dream. Regardless, super tasty, super easy and I can't wait to make it again.

Really unique and very delicious. This is halfway between a crepe and a pancake. I had to turn the heat up to get it to rise and flipping the pancake was a challenge. This would be good for brunch too, if you made a couple pancakes and everyone took a slice.

Delicious,decadent and makes a stunning present.The texture is similar to a crepe or swedish style pancake, but denser & thicker. So if you prefer the fluffy type, skip this recipe. I used golden brown sugar, all the butter and it caramelized very nicely. Makes a great Sunday breakfast.

I found these pancakes a bit eggy and the texture too dense. Next time I'll add baking powder, use 2 apples and use smaller size eggs. I didn't use all the sugar called for, it would have been way too much.

We were not pleased w/ this recipe. It was too much egg, it tasted like an omelette w/ apples. :( Perhaps I missed a step?? still, too much egg.

An interesting twist on German pfannekuchen. I remember Atalaya well. My wife and I both loved this recipe and I have even tried substituting pears for the apple. I also didn't find any difference in cooking time making it in a 10 inch cast iron skillet. I think you could add some chopped nuts such as walnuts or pecans over the top after it is cooked for a change.

too eggy for my taste.

Simply fabulous! Instead of using two separate ovenproof skillets, I used one large ten inch, arranged all the apples and baked for about 25 minutes or so. Then I cut into smaller pieces. This is a good recipe for brunch.

I don't have the right sized pans for this, which kind of messes up the presentation (I use two frying pans, one smaller than called for and one larger than called for....) but doesn't hurt the taste at all. These are fabulous. My husband raves each and every time I make these. With the exception of the pans, I follow the recipe to the letter.

Just finished breakfast, my wife and daughter loved it. The texture is that of a thick crepe, so I would strongly recommend following the advice for using a straight sided pan. You can easily reduce the amount of butter without sacrificing any taste, the caramel butter sauce is very rich.

I love this recipe, I've made it many times before, and will make it many times again. I first tasted something similar when a friend made it for me. So, later when I went searching for a version on epicurious, I found this one. The funny part is that my sister's ex-husband was the co-owner of Atalaya- the restaurant where this recipe came from, and I never knew they offered iton the menu! Small world...Enjoy!

This really is as delicious as people say, even with much less sugar and butter. Very easy preparation for such a beautiful, tasty result. I used 7 in tapas pans and still had to cook it a little bit longer than the recipe said.

Good for the taste buds, but not the waist. Make it for those occasions when you're in a need to treat yourself.

this recipe had a big wow factor upon presentation as it looked absolutely beautiful, like something you'd see at a restaurant. I substituted whole wheat flour, egg whites, and cut the sugar topping in half and it still tasted completely decadent.

For the past 6 years I have been experimenting with the perfect German Pancake (probably as a result of the original pancake house in Chicago, as noted below). This recipe is the best so far. As for getting it to rise Mr Skinner, I have three suggestions. 1) the right pan is essential. I use a cast iron skillet with STRAIGHT SIDES. This causes the batter to creep straight up as it expands. 2)the batter should be fairly thin ie dont pack the flour. 3) Use enough batter this recipe is for a 6 inch pan. Use more if using a bigger pan

I enjoyed this recipe so much that I went and purchased special pans. I have served them to friends and family and all have loved them. A definate four forks!

The Apple Pancake does not rise as much as those at the Original Pancake House's around the country,(and I think I have eaten in just about all of them), but I think they taste every bit as good. Please tell me how I can get it to rise?

WOW!!! This was GREAT!!! We made it just as directed but used a Red Delicious apple which was very tasty and I used pie tins instead of skillets. I might cut down on the sugar topping next time but my husband thought it was perfect. A fun pretty and easy breakfast.

Just a little info concerning everyone's "not really a pancake" review - this is actually an old German recipe called "Apfel phankuchen," meaning APPLE PAN-CAKE ... pancakes (phankuchen, in German) didn't start out as the fluffy, mostly flat ones we make in our kitchens today. I have looked high and low for this recipe ever since my German classes in highschool, and it's almost exactly the same as the one from the German cookbook!

I thought this was very good, made it today for family and friends and everyone loved it. Yes, it is a bit on the eggy side, not completely typical of a pancake but still very good. I will be making this again!

This is very eggy. Expect a variation of an omelette when you make it. I expected a "normal" pancake. My husband nor I cared for it.

I did't have the 6" pans so I increased the milk and flour by 1/4 cup and used an 8" and a 9". The pancakes were great - the 8" pancake was fluffier than the 9" as you might expect. The dish was a big hit as breakfast in bed on my wife's birthday .

Very Good. Problem: I eat toomuch of it!! I do agree with others: cut back on the sugar & Cinn mix...

I made these this morning, and have to say that they presented better than they tasted. I think the "pancake" is a misnomer here - they taste eggy. The sugars were a bit too much. If I ever make these again, I would definitely cut back on the sugar.

This is a delicious, decadent breakfast or brunch dish. We used half the brown sugar mixture and it was perfect!

This would make a kickin' dessert with ice cream. For breakfast it's a lot less labor intensive than pancakes, but seems more fancy. Delicious

very good! i substituted pears for the apples and it still turned out decadent. a little rich for breakfast though; the brown sugar syrup was a bit much. next time i'll cut down on it, or even leave it out all together. but the pancake itself was a treat: custardy but firm; it would do fine without the syrup. was also very easy, although waiting for it to come out of the oven was hard; me and my family just wanted to eat it right away! would definitly make again

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving breakfast in 1999 and received nothing but raves about it (one guest continues to refer to it as "that egg thing"! I have been asked more than once to make it again and intend to do so for Christmas this year!

There's a place in Squim Washington called the Oak Table that serves something very similar to this..I made this recipe and decided I don't have to spend all the money to fly to Seattle anymore! This is very good!

Also excellent with coarsely chopped walnuts, or add fresh strawberries on or around the pancake for color.

I made this for my boyfriend, and he loved it! I used about half the sugar mixture which made it perfect. I will definitely make this again.
