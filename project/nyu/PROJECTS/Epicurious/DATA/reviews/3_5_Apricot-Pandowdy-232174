Delicious with the addition of blueberries or raspberries....I'd add a little more cornstarch if the apricots are too ripe. Served with vanilla ice cream to hungry guys and they were happy!

I see all the discussion about the crust, but I am an 'on the go' person, who likes to entertain but does not have all day to get ready. I made this a few times with the store bought crust, and received raves. So I believe, it is a great recipe for me. I have many friends who use this site, and none of them are the type to make their own crust, so I don't think this site is for the 'experienced chef' only.

We've made this with peaches and pluots too, very very good.

Very tasty made as written and served with vanilla ice cream. Fresh apricots are available in our area now and I'll definitely make this again while they are in season.

fantastic with fresh farmers market apricots, and fine w/ purchased dough...shop around for a good one. Many bakerys will sell to you. Have made it a few times.

Hey SugarBabies, how about using a short crust and adding a bit of vanilla bean to the filling? Thanks for the idea of using reconstituted dried apricots--anything but canned! Thanks for the recipe.

Holy Cow folks .. get a grip! Let's all back up and edit our acidic comments and start over like good little boys and girls. This is a great easy recipe to get on the table fast and it can be dressed up or down depending on who we're trying to impress. Me.. I just want the kids to be fed and happy with time left over for homework and a bit of TV or computer play time.

I liked this recipe and used prepared crust without ill effects. It was in the "quick" section so I would not expect to make my own crust. Apricots tart and wonderful with vanilla ice cream--an easy delicious dessert.

I logged on to find a recipe to fight my summertime blues... and instead found this bit of comic relief! Ha! Thank you all for "rating" this recipe. I'm going to make it and think of you all while eating!

a "community service" would be to stick to the food, keep away from criticizing each other, and remember if you can't say something nice, keep quiet.

Well, like anything else, someone has to start it. I've posted a few snarky remarks here in the past, but ONLY in response to someone who has posted something so outrageously stupid, snobby or ignorant that I felt compelled! I see at as "community service!"

Just a comment -Can't we all just get along? I'm continually amazed how people can be so rude to each other when we all have such a great thing in common, the love of food! Some drink their coffee black, some with sugar - people just have different tastes and different ways of doing things.

Not a rating but a question -- when did the tenor of comments on this site become so mean-spirited? So many comments now seem to attack the character of other respondents -- it's enough to make a person stop reading the user reviews.

If you want to make your own crust, then do so, but don't lower the rating just because you are mad they didn't include a link to a crust recipe! Oh, and BTW, my grandmother owned 4 bakeries and even SHE uses the pre-made crusts sometimes. IT'S OKAY!

To Xinat. It's called ALT+TAB (very complex!), but maybe that is too advanced even for someone like you, who is "on the technology bandwagon." And as had been stated earlier, surely an accomplished chef like yourself can make pie crust in her sleep. It's just 5 ingredients: flour, butter, shortening, salt and a little cold water. But thanks for laugh - I can't get enough of these comments. Imagine, someone deciding against a dish because she can't see all the recipes at once on her kitchen computer's screen! Yet she takes the time and trouble to post a complaint about it on the website?

Another note to the cook from Rochester Hills. It may be hard for you to believe, but everyone that comes to his site may not be an experienced snob of a cook. Newcomers to cooking and this site may possibly need a little help with such mundane recipes as pie crusts. We all can't be as well versed as you. Which seems to me the whole reason for sites like this in the first place.

To the "cook" with attitude from Rochester Hills: I think you hit the nail right on the head, your problem is that you can't imagine. I am an accomplished chef and I keep a laptop in the kitchen, which I use instead of a cookbook for new recipes. I made my comment about including a pie crust recipe for the convenience of not having to switch screens. I suggest you get off your high-horse and try to imagine what it's like to be on the technology bandwagon, which you obviously are not.

The Pillsbury 'box' crusts can be okay - not like a good homemade crust but even homemade crusts these days aren't that great since recipes have nearly all switched to all butter - ESPECIALLY if you roll the crust just a bit thinner. It's still eash to work with, you throw the scraps away which saves a few calories -- easy, fast. I keep one in the freezer all the time.

This was excellent. Quick and delicious. The purchased pie dough was very good, and most would never know homemade from preprepared in the final result. I did substitute nectarines for the apricots as they were nice and less expensive. I will serve this for guests.

Easy, quick, good use of the apricots from my tree.

I modified the recipe like this: I had apricots in the freezer so I used about double the filling ingredients and put them in a casserole/souffle dish with straight sides. I cooked the filling in the microwave, stirring often, till it was fragrant and the apricots were tender. I made a THICK crust (sorry, I cook; don't do the purchased piecrust thing) with 1 and 1/2 c. flour, 3/4 c. margarine, pinch each salt, nutmeg, and lemon zest, and after blending thoroughly with the pastry blender, stirred in about 1/3 c. ice water with a fork. I rolled the crust between wax paper,then applied it to the top edge of the dish, pressing it in place around the edge. I cut some steam slits in the top, brushed it with milk and sprinkled on some suger, and baked it at 350 till the crust was nice and brown and shiny. (I used this temperature because 400 was too hot an oven for meatloaf and the rest of the meal) A scoop of vanilla ice cream went well with the warm fragrant apricots and crispy crust--BUT SUIT YOURSELF.

No rating, just a comment. I can't imagine that anyone interested in cooking would be disappointed that no pie crust recipe is included. Any cook this site caters to already has their own pie crust recipe or knows where to get one of they're interested in spending more time in the kitchen.

I have a comment. I would use a boxed pie crust. It tastes like homemade, and looks like homemade. The refridgerated ones are awful. I found the boxed ones to be great, takes a bit more time, but worth it. I will try this recipe. Looks pretty good. And, I would try dried apricots instead of canned one, tastes more frest when reconstituted, and go from there.

Agree with xinat. A pie crust recipe is in order here, especially when using a great ingredient like fresh apricot. If you're gonna do it, do it right!

No rating, just a comment. As an alternative to the store-bought crust, please provide either a recipe or a link to a recommended recipe. For convenience, I think it's great to mention the store-bought alternative, but this site caters to people who are interested in cooking and who will be disappointed that no pie crust recipe appears.

I'd like to know if canned apricots can be used instead of fresh. If so, I might be tempted to give it 4 forks.
