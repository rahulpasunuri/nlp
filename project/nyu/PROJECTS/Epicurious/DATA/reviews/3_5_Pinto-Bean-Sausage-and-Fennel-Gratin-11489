This was a great recipe! I think the flavors come together really nicely without anything overpowering anything else. I thought that The step that had you cover the vegetables for 10-15 minutes was unnecessary, as I think they got too soft for my taste. I also made it without artichokes because I didn't have any on hand, and it was still good.

I made this using a can of black beans, spicy sausage, drained marinated artichoke hearts, and used broth for liquid. It was not bland at all. I would use three cans of beans for 1 lb of sausage.

The recipe sounded strange, but I had the ingredients and it had a good review. No luck, however. The dish, while perfectly edible and nutricious, was bland and uninteresting. We mixed the leftovers with a bit of cumin, fresh salsa, and monterey jack cheese, then wrapped it in flour tortilla's - that was pretty good.

This is good winter food--warming, delicious and nutritious. I've been making it since it was first published in Gourmet; I'm amazed someone hasn't reviewed it before. It makes a large amount, so I often make just half the recipe. It freezes very well. The only changes I make are using just 1 T. olive oil for browning the meats & vegetables, and I add a considerable amount of minced garlic--probably 8 gigantic cloves in with the vegetables. I also find that as I mix all the ingredients together I sometimes have to add some of the liquid the beans were cooked in to make it the right consistency.
