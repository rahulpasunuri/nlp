This recipe is delicious. I use lowfat mayonnaise and it still tastes divine.

We made this to eat with crab cakes, but it was so good, we put it all over our potatoes, as well. At the end of dinner, my husband and daugther were fighting over who got the last of it. It was awesome.

It's a real challenge not to eat all of this right out of the bowl!

I made this with 1/2 non-fat yogurt and 1/2 light mayo. It still tasted great.

I will never be able to go back to store bought tartar sauce after having this. It is light, fresh and delightful!

This is my appetizer staple - I use it as a dip with shrimp. A real crowd pleaser.

Wow! I will never buy tartar sauce in a jar again! Used yellow onion since we had that onhand, and it tasted fine. Will use the red onion next time.

Really good for stronger tasting fish like cod or tilapia that has been sauteed in olive oil and butter. A keeper! Used serrano peppers. The spice is key.

I've been looking forever for a tartar sauce that I could love and this is it! Will still be making this when I'm 80 if I'm lucky. Really good.

Fabulous recipe... Really addeded something special to the crab cakes. I didn't vary from the recipe, the flavors all blended together beautifully. Not too hot either. Would definately make it again....

Excellent. I made it with 1/2 mayonnaise and 1/2 sour cream to give it a richer flavor and lighter feel.

My husband is a big tartar sauce fan, and he said this was the best tartar sauce ever! Especially if you like Mexican flavors (lime and cilantro), you'll love this. I didn't have capers on hand, and I'll try them next time, but it was terrific without them.

This together with a dish I make with Cod,Large Scallops and shrimp in the broiler was absolutely delicious.

This was a welcome change from the usual tartar sauce. I served it with my fried catfish last night, and think it would be appropriate with just about any fish or seafood calling for a side of tartar sauce. I halved the recipe (cooking just for two) and there's plenty left over. I doubled the amount of lime juice called for. Note: I had to use reduced fat mayonnaise which is all I had, and I'm sure it would be even better with the "real thing."

Great tartar sauce, a keeper recipe. Our only changes were sweet onions instead of red, and no jalapenos.
