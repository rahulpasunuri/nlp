The lime peel in the custard complete spoiled the texture (1). The taste was good (3), but could have been achieved by boiling the zest with the milk, then straining out before combining with the eggs.

And I thought flan was hard to make!!! This was a wonderful dessert following the chicken-green olive enchiladas, served with the Three Chili Rice!!!! I've made it for many parties and everyone loved it!

I'll chalk it up to a series of my own errors, but I doubt I'll make this exact recipe again anyway. I brought the caramel sauce to the perfect color, only to watch it continue to cook, and ultimately burn, after I had taken it off the stove. Also, I loved the idea of the lime flavoring, but the bits of lime zest really interrupted the otherwise beautifully smooth texture of the flan. Additionally, I didn't have enough ramekins onhand so I baked this in a round glass baking dish. Turning it out onto the serving plate, the middle of the flan stuck to the baking dish and the outer edges went crashing to the plate - not pretty. Next time, I'll try making a "regular" flan, being careful with the caramel sauce, and instead of zest I'll try lime juice to avoid the texture conflict. One thing I did right: served it with Tequila and Lime Baked Pineapple from this site, and it was a terrific blend of flavors. For future reference, I'll make a traditional flan and flavor it with lime juice, serve with the baked pineapple, and garnish with lime slices. Oh, and go shopping for some more ramekins beforehand, of course.

This flan is great and one of the best that I've tried. Not to much egg and the consistency is perfect. I used it for a big sit-down dinner and instead of using ramekins for 80 people I used muffin pans. It goes great with tequila macerated tropical fruits.

This was my first attempt at flan. I liked the lime flavor but was not crazy about the texture of the flan. Not smooth enough. I used more cream and less milk because I'm doing the Atkins thing. I served the peaches marinated in brown sugar from another recipe on this site on the side but used limes juice instead of lemon. Very good. Next time I'll try a different flan variation looking for a smoother texture. Also, no matter how quick I was I couldn't get the caramel to coat the sides of the ramekins before it hardened but it served up beautifully anyway.

This is a great recipe. Not as challenging as I thought it would be. I got confused when the instructions said "tilt and rotate to coat sides with caramel." Instead, I only covered the bottom and it came out perfectly.

I'm really lucky in that I have good friends who let me try new recipes on them. This recipe was one of them and I was slightly nervous since I'd never made any type of custard before. Well, it unmolded beautifully, and the flavor was was wonderful - a delicate lime, not overpowering at all - and a perfect ending to a Mexican dinner! The next day, my husband asked when I planned to make more...so, feeling more confident, I used whole eggs and the left-over egg whites from the original flans and used skim milk instead of cream. These, too, came out perfectly...just not quite as creamy as the originals. These will become a staple in my repetoire!

The previous reviewer found the lime flavor strong, but mine was the opposite--delicate. Different limes, I guess. The texture was just what flan should be--very smooth and creamy. My guests loved it.

Delicious! This is a simple flan, not too difficult to make, and the lime flavor is intense but not overpowering; the vanilla keeps it in line. I made this for a Christmas party and got rave reviews -- and had no leftovers. Beautiful garnished with lime twists once it's inverted on a platter.
