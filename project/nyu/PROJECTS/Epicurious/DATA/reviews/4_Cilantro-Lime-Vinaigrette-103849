Didn't seem right not to have any vinegar, so I added just a few drops of balsamic. It was fantastic on a salad of mixed greens, avocado, dill and plum tomatoes. Based on other reviews, the wine vinegar doesn't appear necessary. But if it's to your taste, a little vinegar certainly doesn't take away from the great flavor of this dressing.

WOW! I made this vinaigrette last night and it was SUPER hit! My foodie friends were dying to know how I made it. I put the vinaigrette over fresh organic mixed greens, with fresh sliced oranges, sliced avocado and red onions.

Delicious, easy, light dressing. I served it over a bed of greens, avocado, red bell pepper, tomato, green onion, and garlic-red pepper shrimp. Yumba!

I used the dressing on a romaine/green leaf/butter lettuce, cucumber, red onion, and grapefruit salad, and it was fantastic! I would definitely make it again.

I liked this dressing a lot. I made delicious tacos and instead of just plain lettuce for a topping I drizzled this over the greens. We all ended up having the tomatoes green onions and lettuce as a side salad with our tacos! Fresh limes are a must though, no bottled stuff for this!

Wonderfully light! I've made this several times since I first found the recipe. I toss it with a mixture of greens that includes spinach. I grill a chicken breast, using a little bit of the dressing as a marinade, and chop the chicken, placing it on top of the greens. I then add a spoonful of reduced fat sour cream, reduced fat grated Mexican cheese blend, and sliced avacados. I also cut whole wheat tortillas into strips and bake them for a crunchy topping. A guilt-free meal that tastes wonderful. I'm off to make it tonight...

This dressing is fantastic!! I served it over spinach with tomatoes and avocado. The fresh garlic adds great flavor and it is so light using mostly lime juice. I used more lime juice than the recipe called for.

Wonderful dressing. I tossed this with Baby Romaine Lettuce, and used salad to accompany a tropical Sea Bass dish. The Cilantro compliments the lime perfectly. A nice Sauvignon Blanc along side made for a near perfect meal, at least that's how my wife described it!

Nice and fresh. I used romaine, cucumber and tomato. I can't wait to use some Bibb lettuce, avocado and cucumber next time.

Delicious. Don't overpack the salad. The vinaigrette has enough wonderful flavors. Greens and a tomatoe would be enpough.

Very nice and fresh "summer" dressing. I used bottled lime and dried cilantro so perhaps my version wasn't the best. The lime taste seemed to overpower the flavors a bit though.

This is terrific. Keep the salad simple, cause the flavors will come from the dressing. We added a second clove of garlic and tweaked up both the lime and the cilantro slightly. Agree that Boston bibb is great with this.

Can't WAIT to make it again! It is delicious! I did add a bit more sugar to taste, but it is an explosion of wonderful flavor and the the Boston Bibb just loved it! Enjoy! KIMBER
