This is delicous. Even my kids love it!. I love to serve on Christmas morning with coffee cake and chicken breakfast sausage. I only include 1 t of dried dill so it doesn't overpower the dish. Serve with Cholula or Tapatio. Yum!

I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan, and i and used egg substitute -- still fantastic! I made this for a family brunch and got several requests for the recipe.

I view this as a brunch, egg dish and it is awesome. Since my family needs to eat gluten free, I omit the flour and add two cubed,slices of gluten free bread to the mixture. ALSO cut salt in half. Note: you can double this and bake in a buttered 9x13 glass dish. Bake 40-45 minutes at 350 degrees.

use ricotta rather than cottage cheese, forget the onions, no flour. top with cheddar cheese and nutmeg. no dill. love it and eat it regularly. I use fresh spinach (16 oz) sometimes and steam it first - lightly.

I had a full container of cottage cheese that was about to expire and I found this recipe. A good and easy recipe as a side dish. I added extra spinach that I had in the freezer and only added 3 eggs because that's all I had - turned out great. I didn't add the dill and didn't miss it. Also didn't think it was over salted.

yummy using whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and cutting back on the scallions and dill a bit.

Rating: 2
Easy to make - doubled it to take into the office. Ended up adding one more egg as mixture looked a bit dry. Added some feta as suggested by other reviewers. Other than that, followed recipe exactly. Be CAREFUL of the salt! I'd recommend cutting it in half - you can always add more at the table.

Made this for my toddler. Was too salty, but a nice healthy thing to give to kids. My hubby liked it too. For adults, I would probably change the cheese and maybe switch shallots for the scallions, but it was great as is for kids.

I listened to the other reviewers and made the following changes: Used 1 lb. spinach, 1 lb. ricotta, lots of salt and white pepper, 4 lg. shallots, and omitted the flour. The result was still bland, more quiche-like and less spinach-worthy than what I was aiming for. Not a keeper for this household.

Rating: 3
It is a decent side, I have to agree with other reviewers, if you prefer eggs in the background, use three instead. If you're not fond of frozen spinach (and I'm normally not), wilt your own as it does have that slightly processed spinach flavor. I will make it again though!

I accidentally forgot the flour, it was still really good and everyone liked it, without the flour it's ok for certain diets! (South Beach).

I didn't read through all the reviews, but it strikes me as odd that no one (at least in the reviews that I read) thought to use feta instead of cheddar. Feta goes incredibly well with both cottage cheese and spinach and dill.

This recipe is fantastic! Quick and easy to throw together - I served it for a Sunday brunch and it got rave reviews. I will definitely make it again. Next time I might substitute swiss for the cheddar and top it with diced tomatoes.

Fresh dill makes this recipe great, along with the ease of making it with not many ingredients. Great reheated for lunches. You could throw any veggies in you want, and make it as healthful as you desire by using reduced fat cheeses. Highly recommend for lazy days, and cook ahead meals.

i doubled the spinach and only used 3 eggs and it was FANTASTIC! enjoy!

Rating: 2
This tasted okay although was very eggy. It was more like a crustless quiche than a spinach casserole, and I could make a better quiche without this recipe. To make it more to my liking, I think I would have to alter it so much as to be a different recipe--too bland to warrant a repeat.

Rating: 3
Made this the first time according to the recipe and it was very yummy. Then i tried it, with fat-free cottage and cheddar cheeses. it was STILL delicious and tasted the same.

Rating: 3
Great with a few tweaks: before baking, I sauteed yellow onions, fresh spinach, and zucchini separately. Instead of cottage cheese I used a cup of nonfat plain yogurt. Used italian seasoning instad of dill. Put it in the over at 350 for only 15 minutes, and it was perfect. Delicious, especially with the zucchini which added a nice texture and 'meat' to the dish.

Rating: 2
This would have been really good except that it was WAY too salty. I followed the recipe with the only change being to reduce the dill to about 1 tsp. Next time I would reduce the salt to about 1/4 tsp instead of 3/4 tsp called for. It actually made me feel ill - that's how salty it was...Otherwise tasty. It could probably use more spinach as it was very eggy and not very spinachy. I think the full amount of dill would overpower the dish.

Rating: 3
This was a nice tasty dish. I followed the recipe, except I did not have green onions on hand so I used chopped shallots. Very nice. This would be a good do-ahead and refridgerate then bake before serving dish.

I made a healthier version by omitting the flour, using egg whites only, doubling the spinach and halving the cheese. I also substituted shallots for green onion, and omitted the dill for preference reasons. It was delicious and will become a staple for my family!

I made this casserole (along with some other dishes) on the weekend so that I would not have to cook during the week. It was yummy when reheated in the microwave. Very satisfying and fast. Will definitely make it again.(In the interest of full disclosure, I used 2 shallots instead of green onion)

My whole family enjoys this recipe-- it is quick and easy too.

Rating: 2
This came out a little too pungent for my personal taste. I would say that you should only make it if you REALLY like green onions because the taste seems to overpower everything else in the dish. I will make it again, but next time I'm going to substitute a regular onion for the bunch of green. It would also work well as a main dish if you make it 4-6 servings.

FABULOUS!!I make this roughly once a week. My 10 month old absolutely loves this! It is so high in protein and is good for any meal and at any temperature. I have also added chopped broccoli when trying to amp up the vitamins for my baby. Wonderful!

Very good recipe and easy to make. My recommendation to is definitely use dill weed instead of fresh dill as it adds more flavor to the dish.

I really wanted to like this but it was just boring! I doctored it up as best I could and it still would be embarassing to serve to company. A regular-old quiche w/ sour cream and spinach would be exponentially better.

My husband and I found this to be good in a comfortable, homey way. Made a nice side dish on 2 occassions, but leftovers did not reheat well. Much to our surprise (and theirs) my sister-in-law (who doesn't like spinach) and 2 year-old nephew really liked it. In fact, SIL requested the recipe. I subbed yellow onion for green (didn't have any) and added a dash of nutmeg to the spinach. First time I made it I also topped with a bit of parmesan before baking.

This was one of the worst recipes I've gotten from this site. I can't imagine what I thought would be good about it except that the reviews were such raves. I wanted a vegetable casserole for Christmas dinner and it sure was easy. It was just bland except for the dill which was the ONLY flavor it had, and even reducing the amount of that didn't help. Last year I picked a succession of winners from Epicurious but I've found the recipes from the past 6 months to be disappointing. Paying attention to rave reviews instead of trusting my better judgement was mistake one.

This is a great, easy dish! Like other reviewers, I leave out the dill. Be sure to try it substituting other cheeses as well!

Rating: 3
Very similar to a fall/winter holiday staple in our family (sans the dill). The onions are less "oniony" if cooked in a little butter beforehand, cooled and added to the rest of the ingredients. Also, after thawing and squeezing the spinach, chop it further. It makes for a "lighter" dish. We also make it with frozen, chopped broccoli. Enjoy!

Rating: 3
The mixture didn't look too promising when I put it in the oven, and I was also worried that it would end up being too heavy, but I actually really liked it, as did my husband. The large amounts of cheese did make it rather heavy, but in a comfort food sort of way, and I think that, with it being so easy to make, this recipe will be a staple for weeknights in the cold weather months to come. The leftovers the next day were even better, which was a bonus. Next time, we might try adding some peppers and/or mushrooms, as other reviewers have suggested. I will also reduce the salt a tad, because I found it slightly too salty for my personal taste.

Rating: 3
This is a nice side dish, and I felt good feeding it to my toddler, as it's full of vitamins, calcium and protein. I left out the dill, and it turned out well. Next time I will go easy on the onions, as they tend to take over the light flavor of the dish.

Despite the fact I kept screwing up this recipe, it came out very well. Leads me to believe it's fairly foolproof. I chucked in some red peppers, mushrooms and scallions--very tasty. Also ran out of cottage cheese and subbed part with yoghurt.

I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Also, I sauteed and grated brussel sprouts instead of spinach. While it was a good way to get rid of leftover brussel sprouts, I can't say the leftovers went very fast.

Made this for an extended family gathering and my aunts (the cooks) really liked it. Used 16 oz. frozen spinach, substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese, added 1/4 C parmesan cheese, sprinkled nutmeg on the top and omitted the dill. Next time I'll try the feta/cottage cheese in lieu of the parmesan/ricotta.

This was fantastic!! I added water chestnuts & chopped artichokes, but omitted the onions.

Definately a winner!!

I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp and added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and onion powder. I reduced the pepper to 1/4 tsp and added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I didn't use any dill.

This recipe is great, my 16 year old daughter just loved this - she doesn't like anything that is green usually. I took the advice from the review below me and completely left out the dill, but added 1 clove of garlic. A different way of serving spinach.

I thought this was really good hot and fresh, but it's even better reheated the next day -- the flavors have time to meld. I think I would go a little lighter on the dill, though, as it's a teeny bit overpowering. All in all, a very tasty (and easy) dish!

This sounded like a pretty good recipe concept, but turned out to be quite disgusting. The dill completely overpowered the spinach. If you are making it, trust me, and leave out the dill. I would even substitute cheddar for feta, for an extra kick

This is good, easy, week-day cooking. It wasn't glamorous or scrumptious, but it was yummy and highly palatable to my 13-month old baby and my tired husband. Next time, I'll try using freshly cooked spinach and different cheese to make it more exciting for me to cook.
