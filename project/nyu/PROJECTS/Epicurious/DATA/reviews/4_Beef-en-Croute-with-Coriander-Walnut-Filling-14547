Made this for Valentine's Day with a few adjustments. We are on a budget so used a top sirloin round roast of beef in place of the filet - as this wasn't as uniform in size I was able to break it down into 3 pieces to line up. Cooked at 400 for 40 minutes after the searing and this worked beautifully for the cheaper cut of meat for a med-rare center. Loved the filling, as well, as I am not a fan of mushrooms which are usually used in fillings like these. I skimped on the parsley to let the cilantro (coriander) shine, and the spices are a must! Time consuming, but would make again for a special occasion.

This is the second time I have made this and it was great both times. I did have to cook the meat about 10 minutes longer, but it was then perfect. The only problem is that the bottom of the croute gets a bit soggy with all the meat juices, but it was delicious. Will do again for sure!

Have made this for two consecutive Christmas dinners. Both times it turned out gorgeous and delicious. For the pastry used medium fat sour cream (14% here in Toronto), and no water. Made the coriander walnut filling as written. I didn't worry about a uniform size, as some at the table liked their meat more done than others, so the tapering tenderloin was fine. Cooked it at 385 deg. on convection for 45 mins and let rest for 25 mins as directed. My only problem was that I could not get it off the baking sheet, so had to serve from that. I think this will be out main for many years to come.

I made this for Christmas dinner. The beef was cooked perfectly, the dough was amazing, but the filling was average at best. Many guests scraped it out of their portion. Since the filling took- by far- the most amount of time, I will make it again without the filling and serve it with a red wine sauce.

We've used this recipe four or five times, each time with outstanding results. This is surely one of the best

Made this for a special dinner party. As others said, the dough doesn't need added water. I baked it until the center of beef registered 110°F for rare to medium rare beef and it was perfect. Served it with the Red-wine Sauce from Gourmet December 2006 and it was a huge it!

Help! If I want to cook a 2lb beef tenderloin only (for 6 people) how long will it take to cook? Surely less time than this recipe calls for.

My daughter and I made this for Christmas Eve dinner. It was a lot of work, but very delicious and definitely not the same old thing. No need for water for the crust, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Rich, gorgeous and delicious! I must say that one of the best things about this recipe is that it was made ahead and chilled for hours while we prepared other dishes. It was so easy to just pop it in the oven, garnish and serve!

Okay, I would like to thank the person who helped with the coriander sprigs answer. I finally figured it out that it was cilantro leaves. I made this for a sit down dinner for nineteen people yesterday and it was INCREDIBLE! WOW! Did it go over well. Lovely presentation, aroma, and the meat was as tender as anything I have ever made. I did use less water in the pastry and that worked well. I used two 4 lb. tenderloins in separate pastries and that worked pretty well. I let one cook to 130 degrees before taking out so it was more well done. This went over very well. The pastry with the stars on top looked wonderful and the filling was excellent. This recipe will stay in my recipe box for all the special occasions in our lives.

Fresh coriander is cilantro, or chinese parsley. You should be able to get that most anywhere, but it is prominent in latin and asian cuisines.

Okay, I haven't made this yet, but plan to for a Holiday Party on Sunday. Can anyone tell me what Coriander Sprigs are? I can't find them at the store and no one has been able to tell what/where to find them. thanks, Chuck from Tampa

GREAT! I had a dinner party and wanted to WOW my guests! Though it was somewhat time consuming, the raves I got were overwhelming!

Excellent dish, with very nice presentation. We skipped the walnuts in the filling because of a nut allergy, and used multi-grain bread for the breadcrumbs. Appreciated by a variety of palettes from simple to gourmet.

This was, without doubt the star of a special lunch that we had yesterday - everyone raved, even one guest who admitted to disliking coriander! The dough looked a bit odd when I made it, and I went out and got some puff pastry to have in reserve - I needn't have worried - it was delicious, and I shall use it for other dishes in the future. The stuffing was wonderful, and easy to make in advance - as indeed was the whole dish. I cooked it for a shorter time than recommended, and after it's resting time served it very rare, which is how we like it. It looked stunning on the plate (as well as coming out of the oven), and was just delicious - a real keeper. I am going to try it with a venison tenderloin next...

Excellent.It turned out very good the first time I made it. When making the dough I eliminated the water and also I used yoghurt instead of sour cream. The crust was very flaky.

This was very easy and wonderful! I eliminated the water from the sourcream pastry dough as recommended.

Always a party favorite, makes you look SO good. By the way, consider using frozen puff pastry from the supermarket as (for me) a perfectly acceptable shortcut.

The recipe was delicius but the instructions out of Gourmet were unnecessarily complicated

Oh sooooo delicious! It was time consuming but well worth the effort. Having encountered the same problem as the cook from Arlington when preparing the dough, I might skip the water altogether next time. Also, I found the cutting into nice, presentable slices, quite difficult.

Incredible entree! Served it for New Year's Eve & our guests, all of whom are serious foodies, raved. Tenderloin was perfectly medium rare. One suggestion - the pastry split down one side when the filling slid off the top while baking. Next time I'll switch the proportions of filling from top to bottom & put two-thirds on the bottom instead of on top. Served with potato & porcini gratin, moroccan carrots & some '70 & '71 Ch. Chasse Spleen. Fabulous!

Great dish, made last year for Christmas dinner party, making this year for New Year's Eve dinner.

This was a fabulous dish that wowed both my parents and my in-laws. The only problem I experienced was with the dough. It seemed to be the proper consistency before I added the water and afterwards was too moist and difficult to work with. Next time I plan to skip the water and leave out the coriander seeds.

Wonderful. More time consuming than I'd expected but worth the effort. Kids, picky eaters and gourmet cooks loved it.

Looked great and tasted good, although meat should be very well seasoned. Cooking time was off, need to watch crust and meat

I looked like a superstar gourmet when I pulled this recipe off. It is beutiful to behold, delicious to eat. I used pistachios instead of walnuts due to an unsavory remark about walnuts from those attending my Christmas dinner- worked brilliantly. I want to make this recipe again and would if I wasn't the type to always outdo myself for holiday meals. This will be ever so hard to top!

Whoo-hoo! All my friends now think I'm a culinary genius. This was pretty easy--albeit expensive!!--to make, and it impressed the hell out of everyone.

I made this twice last year and it was a tremendous hit. The family loved it so much that it is going to be this years Christmas dinner. I misplaced the recipe and hunted for it through all of my Gourmet mags. I was psyched when I found it on line!!!!

If there were a rating of 5, I would have chosen it for this recipe. I'm a (almost) vegitarian who allows myself one meat dish per year. This one has been it two years running now! The combination of flavors and textures is beyond compare.

The recipe is fabulous - maybe a little strong on the corriander. But the dish is as wonderful to look at as it is to eat - which is saying something indeed! Highly recommend so long as you've got a few hours.

THIS DISH WAS INCREDIBLE! THE PRESENTATION WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE. SLICE IN HALF AND SURROUND WITH GREENS AND CHERRY TOMATOES. I SERVED IT WITH WILD RICE PILAF AND SAUTEED GREENBEANS W/ FRESH TARRAGON. IT WAS A SMASH HIT!
