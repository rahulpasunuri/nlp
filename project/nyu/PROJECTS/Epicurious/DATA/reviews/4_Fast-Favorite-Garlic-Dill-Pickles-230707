Another first time pickler... I made a ton of pickles and can't wait to try them. It seems such a key part of the recipe... how long should they sit before they are ready to eat? Is the general consensus 1 day? I had heard 10 days to a few weeks for other recipes. Thanks!

This recipe ensures that I'll never have to purchase pickles again! I added peppercorns, celery seed, and mustard seed. My pickles were ready to eat the next day and stayed crisp until they were gone (about 3 weeks in the fridge). I think the crispness has largely to do with the freshness of your cukes.

I didn't put into the water bath. Mother in law used to do a similar recipe and only used hot jars, boiling brine. Gave a great seal and the pickles are crisp! I don't remember how long to keep before eating??

First time making pickles - super easy and tastes great! Used dill weed plus dill seed. Made it with the suggested hot pepper - tiny piece. Brought a jar to a friends house for dinner and she tried some. She loved them and then confessed she's not very fond of pickles but really liked these.

First time pickler here - great recipe. I added some pickling spices too - peppercorns, mustard seed and allspice as well as some sugar - I like them sweet!

These were some of the best pickles that I've made-tart and zesty. To the cook who was disappointed that they weren't crisp enough-soak the cucumbers in 1/4 cup pickling salt and 3 cups crushed ice in a large bowl, weighted down with 4 pounds or so for 4 hours. This removes some of the water from the cucumbers and results in a crisper pickle.

Dear cook from Israel, here is a very nice explanation of the equipment and procedure for the hot water bath: http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art2816.asp Good luck!

how long do these have to sit in the jars before they're ready to eat?

The explanation about how to can without a canning machine is unclear to me. Am I supposed to seal the jar with the top, and then let it sit in boiling water for a few minutes, making sure the jar has an inch of water over its head? or is the jar supposed to be open? Not sure what you mean (I'm a first time "pickler"...)

Easy with good flavor. Suggest adding mustard seed along with dill and garlic.

I have not made these yet but have comment for hubcat--english cucumbers will not work to make good pickes. The structure is too soft and they will always make soft, flabby pickles--they are ment for fresh eating. Try growing a type of pickling cucumber. "Adam" is great--it makes perfect gherkins. I hope this helps--good luck!

Very Easy and delicious pickles! I definitely did not have all of the canning supplies, but I put the jar in boiling water for a few minutes and the pickles turned out delicious!

having just today discarded 10 pints of spicy dills made from a very famous chef's recipe ( they were way to-o salty and soft!!) i am wondering about the 10 minute processing time -too long?- and also i am using "english" cucumbers from my garden- long and only slightly seeded- any advice or observations? just don't have the heart to try this recipe and end up discarding more pickles!

1) Don't have a "canner"? - You can use a very tall sauce pot, such as a tall soup kettle - you need to cover the canning jars with enough water, at least an inch without boiling over. Canners have racks to hold the jars in place but if you control the heat so the jars don't jostle around too much, it'll work. 2) When dill goes to seed it forms an umbrella-like head. the ferny leaves/fronds do not have the same concentration of flavor. If you cannot find dill heads (live in a big city? or Israel!) you can use dill seeds - 1 tsp. per jar should do. 3) When you process any kind of pickles where crispness is key, you count processing time from the moment it goes into the hot canner, not the time it takes to bring to a boil - unlike other canned products. It's crucial the brine be boiling when you pour it over the vegetables in the jar so you get a vacuum seal. The high vinegar content is a preservative. Usually you rely on long processing times to destroy bacteria, pathogens, etc.

What do you do if you don't have a canner? Can you can without one?

What is a head of dill? A whole bunch sound like too much, and 4 sprigs sound too little...

Husband and I had a pickle making cook- off. We were looking for the perfect "Claussen" mini dill knock- off. Five kinds-3 refrig and 2 processed. These was very good but we only processed for 5 minutes and would recommend maybe only 3-4 in future. Not sure what the "canning police" would say about that, but if you want a nice, crispy dill pickle, 10 minutes processing would be way too much. Try 5 and see what you think.
