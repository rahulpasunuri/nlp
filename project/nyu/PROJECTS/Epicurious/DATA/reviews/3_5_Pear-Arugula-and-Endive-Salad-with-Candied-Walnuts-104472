Made it as the first course at Christmas dinner. It was a big hit, esp. with pears in season. Yum yums.

This is a good recipe as written. However, I like to mix things up. Used some canola oil as part of the oils, and instead of sherry wine vinegar, used champagne vinegar. Also added some goat cheese on top. Chopped up the endive to add to the arugula which was better than the large pieces. And as other reviewers suggested, substituted candied pecans for the walnuts. Was very elegant. Guests raved. Would make this again.

Don't be afraid to sub in other lettuces. I used arugula and endive, but also added romaine & iceberg to make the appeal more universal, and radichio (for color). Another thing I did was to make this a few hours ahead--I put the cut pears in a baggie and drizzled some of the dressing over them to keep them from discoloring. This worked well. Next time I think I will do the same thing with the arugula (i.e., dress it lightly ahead of time) in order to soften it up a bit. The salad got compliments from guests with a variety of tastes.

I made this for Christmas Dinner. I did not plate it as previous reviewers had suggested. I added raspberries and goat cheese to it. The raspberries added a great pop of color for the holidays. The salad tasted great, even though it wasn't plated and was self serve from a big bowl. Everyone raved about it. I will definitely make this one again!

I've served this salad twice so far, once at a dinner party. It turned out really well! The only big change I made was to follow the walnut recipe but use pecans, which were plenty sweet. I used about half the endive because we only had 4 people, and it was perfectly balanced. For the dressing, I used a tablespoon or so less oil than called for. Highly recommend!

I served this salad at an afternoon outdoor jazz event. I liked the salad mixture, but will use less oil in the dressing next time.

Good salad! Note: the candied walnuts add a nice texture, but aren't really very sweet. The pears are the sweet element to the salad. The dressing was great. I didn't have Sherry wine vinegar, so substituted 1/2 balsamic and 1/2 red wine vinegars.

Nice simple salad to serve with Christmas dinner. The dressing was not sweet and paired nicely with pears and walnuts. I just used red leaf lettuce since it was more kid-friendly.

Added bleu cheese and it was met with rave reviews at our dinner party last night. There's no way it made 10 portions though - everyone had seconds.

This salad was great! Although, the second time I made it, I adapted it quite a bit and it was even better. I used apples instead of pears, pecans instead of walnuts and I added some feta. My family loved it.

Lovely, simple, easy and got many compliments.

Yummy and very good for a special occasion. Comments: (a) I agree that more mustard would enhance the dressing. It's good as spec'd in the recipe, but a bit more sharpness helps (particularly if you are using a very sweet pear, like I did) (b) Tried it with a mache, radiccio and other greens mix. Not as good as arugula.

This salad was amazing. The dressing is particularly good and the mix of peppery arugula, pear and endive is innovative and delicious. I can't wait to make this again.

I brought this for a holiday party, used honey crisp apples (they have a great sweet, crisp taste and a beautiful pinkish/red color perfect for the holidays) instead of pears and added goat cheese becuase it goes so well with fruit and the peppery taste of the arugula.

Rating: 4
I used arugula instead of endive. I also used a much simpler recipe for candied walnuts: dissolve sugar (I use sugar in the raw) and water, toss walnuts with the mixture and toast for 10 minutes at 350. The salad was a huge hit at a recent dinner party. I will certainly make the dressing again.

I made this recipe for Christmas 2000 and will make it again this year. My guests raved! For those who need to add sugar; try a different green other than arugula and I think you will be pleased. I used fresh greens and a mesculin mix and it was a perfect blend of flavors. Also, be sure to use ripe pears, as they provide a natural sweetness.

My family requests this salad every year for Christmas dinner- and many times in between. MUST be single plated to get the proportions right. Pears should be very sweet and sliced super thin-I use a serrated steak knife. Dressing is better with 11/2 times mustard and a healthy extra shake of sherry

This salad was absolutely wonderful! It was such a nice change from your basic green salad, very impressive and special. The dressing was nice and tart (lemony, mustardy and nutty) and coating the peppery arugula it was perfect combined with the sweet pears and walnuts. I added diced shallot to the dressing, which kicked it up even more, and I also added crumbled blue cheese (very good quality) and it made the whole salad even yummier. It worked fine served in a large bowl, but for a smaller crowd I think the presentation would certainly be nicer on individual plates.

Use ripe bosc pears, and double the mustard, and this is a pretty, pleasing salad.

The salad was a little boring. I loved the candied walnuts - but the dressing needed sugar or something. I won't make this again.

Like the previous reviewer, this was not as good as I had expected--although I did serve it in a big salad bowl for a New Year's Eve dinner party and did not individually plate it. Might try again for a smaller group.

I was expecting a great salad and was disappointed. The candied walnuts were fantastic, but the dressing was so-so and the endive just tasted bitter. I added some pungent cheese to this and it helped, but it definitely needs some serious revision.

Mmmm. Made only a few changes. Used 2 TBSPs of maple syrup in the dressing since I felt it needed a little sweetness, and added about 2 TBSPs of minced shallot, since I love shallots in salad dressing. I also threw some butter lettuce in with the two kinds of endive and the arugula. The flavors of this salad are all wonderful together. Blue cheese would be a great addition. Highly suggest making this recipe.

Delicious and something different. My husband raved. Used red baby endive (good color), one whole pear for two people, and candied pecans instead of walnuts.

I made this salad for an after christening luncheon featuring all salads. There was nothing left and everyone said it was delicious. Substituted lime juice for the lemon juice and sprinkled bleu cheese crumbles on top of salad.

This salad is delicious, I did substitute the arugula for mesculun greens. It is quick and very easy to make, a little of the dressing goes a log way!

I just finished this salad, and it was wonderful! I used pear vinegar and walnut oil, both from Napa Valley, and it was so flavorful. Easy to make, layers of flavor, would be great to serve on the deck before a grilled entree. This is a keeper!

I loved this recipe! The candied walnuts were much easier than other methods I've tried and they were terriffic!

This was such an easy & quick recipe w/ a great response. In place of arugula and endive, I just used mesculun greens which worked fine and Asian pear which was quite refreshing. I added crumbled Gorgonzola cheese and it was the best. I also tried pecans since I didn't have any walnuts, and it turned out very well. You do need to watch them closely to prevent burning. This is definitely a recipe I'll go back to again and again.

Elegant and tasty. The candied walnuts really pulled the salad together. In place of arugula, I used Treviso radicchio because of the beautiful light green and purple colour.

Made this recipe almost exactly as written and we loved it! I just added a little radicchio with the arugula, and my walnuts were cooked in under 10 minutes. We had some really flavorful Comice pears on hand, and they were perfect. We'll definitely see this on our table again.

I made this salad for the holidays last year and it was a HUGE hit. I meant to share the recipe, but couldn't find it. I keep attending events where friends have been trying to recreate it. I guess I'm going to have to share the secret 'cause they just haven't made it right yet. I have added a sprinkling of a high quality soft cheese such as blue, not feta with great results.

I loved this salad. I also used the pinch of sugar in the dressing at the advice of another reviewer. I did not have trouble with the walnuts, I checked on them every five minutes and turned them. Brought this salad to a friends party and everyone raved about it!

Made this salad for guest and everyone enjoyed it. I used mixed spring greens instead of arugula and endive. It has a lovely presentation. Great and easy first course.

Also tried with a good bottled basalmic vinagrette as dressing and it was very good. The pears and candied walnuts make the salad for us.

Adding two tablespoons of sugar to the dressing definitely helped! Also, I dipped the pears in the dressing ahead of time, to prevent browning and allow assembly of the salad plates ahead of time. I otherwise kept the dressing separate, and half of guests preferred a different dressing on their salad. Overall, a good combination of salad ingredients, and impressive appearance. I also substituted baby spinach due to high cost of arugula.

We love this salad! I added some honey to the dressing to slightly sweeten, and blended it in a blender until creamy. I also added fresh mozzarella cheese, fresh rasberries, and lots of grinded black pepper. A wonderful combination!!!

My guests loved this salad. My husband said it was the best salad he'd ever eaten and he eats out almost every day at great restaurants so it was quite a compliment. I substituted mesclun mix in place of the endive and arugula but didn't change anything else. Dressing was excellent as is.

We really liked this recipe. Don't know why others had to add sugar. Nice presentation as a composed salad. Always remember to taste your dressing with whatever greens you'll be serving with the dressing before you dress the greens.

Basically used the dressing and pears with a mix of red and green leaf lettuce..... I too found the dressing bitter (not gross, just bitter) and added sugar. The result was a great salad.

Everything was wonderful about this recipe. We LOVED the dressing as written. I substituted baby spinach for the arugula & endive. We'll probably try it with other types of vinegar too.

This is a great salad......BUT....MAKE SURE YOU TASTE THE DRESSING BEFORE YOU POUR IT ON. Because when I made it, it was sour and gross. The only reason my dressing tasted good is because I added 2 tablespoons of sugar to it. Without the sugar, this dressing is disgusting.
