OH MAN, this is so good. super easy and very tasty. The tomatoes and the olives (I just used green ones) were a good combo and the poached chicken was super mild. All together, pow! So good!

Easy, yummy, and quick. Provided you have access to good tomatoes, this will be delish, and its a real treat in the summer... with 6 minutes of simmering and 3 minutes of boiling, your kitchen won't heat up a bit. Definitely a summer keeper.

This is a wonderful summer recipe, my whole family loved it, it's one of few recipes that I didn't change at all, it's wonderful as it stands. Please make sure to use good olives

Good recipe. Beans and tomato mixture were great. Not hot though on poaching the chicken. It was tender but tasted awful. I have made a recipe similar with poached salmon that was great.

The perfect summer recipe! Easy, colorful, delicious, and healthy too! The only change I made was to use fresh basil instead of oregano -- I just think basil pairs so well with fresh tomatoes. This will definitely become a summer staple at our house.

My husband loved this and I wouldn't change a thing, except that if I had a whole bunch of thyme, I'd throw the whole thing in with the poaching liquid. I'm looking forward to making it this summer with tomatoes from the garden. A nice dinner for two with leftovers for lunch.

Needed to put something together for a quick meal for my husband after a late meeting...It was great!

I made this dish for a quick summer dinner and it was great. I made it as written but didn't have oregano. It didn't seem to matter. I served it with polenta made with parmasean cheese (salt and pepper) and carried the tomato topping over to cover it also. Very pretty to look at with good flavors for summer.

This is a very special dish. The plate appeal is wonderful and the flavors truly fly. The chicken is as tender as it can be. We made this first for ourselves but now have made it for several guests, who all want the recipe. Spectacular for a very low carb, and low fat (if you use 1 tbs of oil) recipe.

I have made this recipe a couple more times and have found that good-quality frozen beans can be used successfully off-season. An easy make-ahead meal to bring to a loved one.

I made this dish with everything except the thyme, and it was excellent--the chicken was very juicy, the tangy olive/tomato/oregano mixture complemented the chicken perfectly (though you have to love olives to fully appreciate this dish). I've always roasted chicken breasts but probably won't bother anymore, now that I know how tasty they are when they're poached (extremely simple, too!). I would certainly make this again.

Wasn't sure about this as I'd never poached chicken before. Not to worry...it was very tender and the go-withs added just the right flavor boost. Try it.

Nice and easy! I halved the amounts and brined the meat for a few hours and it was up to temp in just the 6 minutes; with fresh herbs from the garden and good olive oil, this was really very moist and flavorful.

I thought this dish was wonderfully simple with lovely fresh flavors. The bonus is that it is mostly made of store cupboard ingredients, so you just need to grab a couple things from the grocery store. However, this was the first time I've ever poached chicken and I wasn't pleased with the results. I think this was due to the fact that my chicken was in smaller pieces than recommended. I will definitely do this recipe again, but I think next time I will just pan saute the chicken with thyme and serve with a bit of saffron couscous and a nice white wine.

This was fabulous! I'm having the leftovers today for lunch. Very easy recipe and I loved the mixture of flavours. Olives are my husband's favourite food, so this was an easy sell for him!

I love the poaching hint and how tender the chicken comes out. This is one technique I will apply to other chicken recipes. The tomato/olive salsa is also a keeper. Enjoyed by all!

Absolutely delicious and easy! I served this as part of my in-law's 50th wedding celebration which we catered at our home. It was a hit with all our guests and the leftovers were fantastic the next day. It's part of our family recipe book!

I made this dish for a small dinner party and everyone loved it! I served it on top of couscous with a heavy dose of garlic. It is especially nice to serve during warm weather with a chilled viognier. Will make again.

Yum! Really good, and I think it's healthy! I substituted dry herbs because I didn't have fresh, but it came out good nonetheless.

I didn't make this exact recipe, as I didn't have all the right ingredients, but it was a close approximation, and it was perfect for a hot muggy summer evening. I used fewer tomotoes, whatever green beans I had on hand (canned and frozen), and a lot of (good, not canned) olives. I used dried thyme and oregano. I didn't bother layering everything, but just mixed it all up together as a big "salade composee." It was great. The olives really made it. Afterwards I served a cheese plate and called it a night. Good deal.
