I made this dish exactly according to the recipe (but I cooked the bacon 'til crispy) and I really liked it. It has a unique flavor, and all the colors make it really pretty. However, my boyfriend hated it. He's a picky eater, and I think the combination of flavors (bitter + sweet + crunchy) was just too weird for him. Oh, well.

I turned this salad dish into a vegetable dish to go with a pork tenderloin course. I left out the pecans and oranges. It was the perfect side dish -- much better than the usual red cabbage side dish to pork. And so easy to prepare.
