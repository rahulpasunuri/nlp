I've made this recipe multiple times and my guests have raved every time! The only modifications I made to it were that I used lard instead of margarine and sprinkled turbinado sugar atop the loaf. Each time, I've also made double batches because I can of coconut milk is roughly enough for two batches. This bread goes beautifully with Jerk Chicken, Peas and Rice, Spicy Coleslaw and Planter's Punch.

very simple, quick and fine cake! I've made sweet fruit sauce to the top of the slices: simmering a can of sliced tropical fruit-mix till its liquor has evapored, then mix well with the rest of the coconut milk, a teaspoon of corn starch, it must be smooth an shiny - very very special cake, thanks for the recipe!

I made this without totally knowing what it was. I loved it. I acutally ended up using dried unsweetened coconut that was in quite large pieces and that was too chewy. The next time I used smaller, grated pieces (found at Trader Joes or Whole food) and it was much better!

Used dried coconut flakes, so I added a touch more coconut milk to the dough. Don't bother using a fork to mix it all together, get in there with your hands. The bread comes out light but moist, and the coconut flavour isn't overpowering at all.
