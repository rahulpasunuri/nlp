When I made this, I left off the topping didn't have any on hand) and cut the sugar in half. It was delicious! Next time I will add more banana. Note: If you use instant Cream of Wheat 6 packets is a good amount. Also, take it off the heat and whisk as soon as you add the cereal.

i'm a diehard cream of wheat girl so this is the ideal comfort breakfast - it has also been great with any number of variations, such as honey for maple syrup, walnuts, adding raisins - malt-o-meal is also awesome with this recipe -
