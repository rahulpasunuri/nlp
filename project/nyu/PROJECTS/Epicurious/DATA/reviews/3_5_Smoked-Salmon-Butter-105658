I make this at least once a month, doubling the recipe and eating with pumpernickel bread. The key is using room temp/softened butter and cream cheese. Amazing!

Excellent. I don't add the tarragon (not a fan of it) but did add horse radish.

this is a fantastic little pre dinner snack. I used scallions instead of chives as I like a little crunch. The flavor is very similar to salmon rillettes. we served rosemary crackers with it and cornichons.

I have made this several times to rave reviews. I have taken to add horseradish & find it's even better. We love the butter taste, so would never leave it out. Not a tarragon lover, so I don't add it.

Easy. Next time I'll skip the butter and just use cream cheese.

Served to a very "gourmet" group - they all loved it!
