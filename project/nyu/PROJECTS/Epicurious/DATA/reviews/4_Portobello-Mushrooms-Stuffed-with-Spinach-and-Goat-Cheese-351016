I actually had some leftover red lentils and used them instead of the breadcrumbs - they smushed up really well with the goats cheese (had an herbed version in the fridge) and it was much more satisfying (plus gluten free). I as well skipped the frozen spinach and used a comparable green called callaloo and tossed it in to cook at the end of the onions, etc. The marinade was quite strong - should have read the reviews first to lessen the amounts of the strong flavors of the balsamic and tamari (soy sauce). Served over black rice. YUM! Need something light and fresh after (cue an awesome fruity dessert)

My husband loved this, but my daughter and I couldn't eat it. The filling was fine, but the marinated mushrooms were too strong in flavour, we found it overpowering.

I thought the combination of soy sauce and balsamic seemed a bit strident, so I used rice vinegar. Didn't have Marsal, so I left it out. From the local organic market here in Mexico I had fresh spinach (steamed it) also had local goat cheese (not the crumbly supermarket kind, more creamy, so I just rolled little balls of it and put them in the stuffing), also I don't eat wheat, so I crumbled some Thai red rice crackers for the breadcrumbs. Didn't have the Parmesan, so I grated a wonderful local aged Manchego (a nice hard cheese like the Spanish one). Oh, and I didn't bother with the button mushrooms, just used some extra Portobellas. Other than that, I didn't change a thing and the dish was delicious.

Delicious! Based on other reviewers comments I halved the amount of marinade and added some red peppers into the stuffing mixture. I also used fresh spinach and just cooked it along with the mushrooms and onions. Overall a great dish!

This was delicious. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen spinach and it worked great. I cooked it along with the mushrooms and onions. The stuffing was delicious and the marinade was amazing!

I made this awhile ago, (and it was great, I don't like goat cheese so used feta) but some of the comments about the portions made me pipe up (entering my messy clippings into Epicurious), this was a restaurant recipe from Cucina Rustica. I think some portions got mixed up as they "down sized" this recipe from a commercial application. I also adjusted as I made and equal portions of balsamic to soy sauce did not sound good to me. Sometimes you have yo use your judegement and cooking experience. I have found MANY Bon Appetit recipes (especially those adjusted from restaurants or cook book authors) do not work quite right......sometimes we home cooks can see that things need to be adjusted!

So very good. Easy enough for a quick dinner but also perfect to impress company.

This is just delicious! The only modifications I did were: (1) used less olive oil and soy sauce than required, (2) used dry sherry instead of Marsala (I love both but was out of Marsala), (3) used fresh spinach and boiled for 3 minutes, (4) I was not sure about which was the button mushrooms, thus used white mushrooms instead, and (5) tried a suggestion from another reviewer and sprinkled red pepper flakes on the top of mushrooms. I served with a green salad. My family loved it!

This was not bad, but I agree with other reviewers that the marinade was way too much. I halved it and it was still too much. I also think the balsamic vinegar was too strong for the amount of time the mushrooms marinated--the end result was actually a bit soggy and vinegar-y. And I don't think the mushrooms need to broil for 15 minutes before stuffing them.

Rating: 3
As others have pointed out, this recipe is delicious but has some quantity problems -- twice as much marinade and filling as needed for 6 portobellos. Reduce oil and soy in marinade. Also, no need for any added salt; the soy and the cheese are sufficient. Ignore 2fewdaysafield's comments below. I was easily able to gently crumble with a fork a chunk of cold chevre. The flavors were intense but balanced, and my family loved it. Apparently 2few's customers will miss out on an outstanding appetizer. And no need to be so angry....

I made this last night with 14 mushrooms. I doubled the recipe. A couple of important things I learned: - Get LARGE portabello mushrooms. The small ones are too dinky. - I had way too much filling. I am making more mushrooms today to use up the filling. I could have had 14 mushrooms and not doubled the filling recipe. - I got crumbled goat cheese at the store no problem. (Whole Foods had it)

This is a GREAT recipe! Everything blends perfectly and the flavor is amazing. Have made this one over and over again and it never ceases to impress!

Yummy! I cut out the soy sauce completely and halved the balsamic, and served with a mixed green salad w/tomato and goat cheese croques monsieurs. Loved it! Also, goat cheese DOES crumble, as long as your chevre is semi-dry and cold (straight from the fridge), or you can buy pre-crumbled in a little tub.

Great vegetarian dinner option. I have made it twice, once on the grill and the second time in the oven. The grill makes a huge difference and improves the dish very much. The marinade is a bit strong, but not a deal breaker.

This is a great dish. Would make again. I did not marinate for the 4 hours and it was still great.

I thought this was great. The only change I made was to use @ 1 tbsp goat cheese per portobello mushroom. This turns out to be substantially less than 5oz, but it added a delicious cream cheesiness to the dish, without being overpowering. Crumbled chevre does exist! My grocery store sold this brand: http://www.montchevre.com/products/crumbled.html

I made this last night for a group of friends and only had an hour and a half. I was worried that it wouldn't be enough time to marinate the mushrooms but it was delicious anyhow. Didn't have marsala so substituted a bit of white wine + brandy. Sprinkled red pepper flakes into stuffing for an added kick. Everyone LOVED it.

ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!!! SHAMEFULLY BAD!!! BORDERLINE BETWEEN INEDIBLE AND POISONOUS!!! Background...Grandfather, one of the founders of the Escoffier Society in Canada. Mother...Author of over 30 cookbooks. Family....Runs a successful restaurant. Recipe sounded interesting. Considered offering it as an Appetizer at the family restaurant. First warning bell...Ingredients call for crumbled goat cheese. Goat cheese (chevre) DOES NOT CRUMBLE. It mushes or spreads. This immediately caused me to doubt the author of the recipe had ever tested it or EVEN USED GOAT CHEESE! I forged on. WHAT A MISTAKE!!! One bite and I threw the rest in the garbage. Our restaurant prefers not to make people sick! Simply AWFUL!

This dish would have been more delicious had I cut the marinade in half, especially the olive oil. The end product was just too greasy. As suggested, I cut back on the soy sauce, which helped not to make the dish too salty. However, cut back on the olive oil and marinade in general. I served it on top of garlic mashed potatoes with a side of asparagus.

very good for a hearty vegetarian option! the only down side was the saltiness, so will add less soy sauce next time.

This recipe is unnecessarily verbose, especially for such a simple and delicious dish. A lovely supper paired with some warm flatbread and a green salad.

I replaced the spinach with swiss chard and it was very tasty. Next time would probably leave them in a bit longer at the end so the filling firms up.

Absolutely delicious! I halved the marinade and substituted feta for the goat cheese and got rave reviews. The amount of filling was perfect and the flavors were out of this world. My family is already asking when I'm going to make this again. I'm already dreaming about having more & my mouth is watering!

As a vegetarian who is always looking for a way to squeeze in extra protein, I added tofu to this recipe. I didn't use any goat-cheese, but just shreded up a block of good parmesan. It was fantastic! I recommend dousing the mushrooms with the balsalmic/thyme/olive oil mixture occasionally while they're cooking.

"hearty and luxurious" in the description = "waaay too rich" in my book. The textures were nice, the presentation was great, but even though I'm normally a goat cheese fan, I felt it just totally overpowered all the other flavors. I might try again w/different cheese, but not as written.

This is a great meal. We had kale in the fridge, so we substituted it for the spinach. Worked very well. Will definitely make this one again.

I made a few minor changes, and it was incredible. I made a traditional balsamic vinaigrette instead of the recommended one to marinate the mushrooms. To make the stuffing, I sautéed the onions and as they started to turn brown added the mushrooms. Once those were starting to brown, I threw in chopped fresh spinach and the garlic. Finally, I let this cool for a few minutes and mixed in some herbed goat cheese. Great recipe

I made this as a vegetarian main for Thanksgiving. The flavor of the mushrooms were good (having been marinated) and the flavor of the stuffing was good, but I didn't think it all went together well. I also thought the goat cheese flavor got lost and was overpowered by the strong flavors in the marinade. It was a good dish but not fabulous...I think I'd try something else next time.

Yummy! A bit more work than I like but worth it. It works too if you don't have extra button mushrooms to add to the filling. I bake the portobello longer than called for probably 20 min each side. I 1/2'ed the marinade and poured it in a ziplock back over the portobello caps. It was more than plenty to marinade them and you really get them to soak up all the flavors.

I had all the ingredients bar the spinach. So I substituted broccoli, cooked and then chopped in the food processor. That worked very well too.

This dish was wonderful. The portabellas were flavorful and tender enough to cut with a fork. The stuffing was perfect I did utilize Italian breadcrumbs and thought they work well too. I also substituted the thyme for some fresh rosemary.

This was heavenly, a real umami festival! This would be fun to serve as an entree at a vegetarian dinner party. I played with the marinating instructions a bit, substituting sweet vermouth for the marsala, quartering the amount of marinade, and shortening the soaking time to a couple of hours, and the mushrooms were flavorful but not overpowering.

I am a vegetarian and this was one of the most amazing dishes I've made. I halved the recipe with 3 mushrooms and it was excellent. Cannot wait to try it again!

Amazing. I have made many epicurious recipes, but this is the first one that was SO wonderful I just had to review and exude my praise. There was not a morsel left on all my guest's plates. I skipped the whole marinade step as I didn't have enough time, and I simplified the filling by not using the button mushrooms, just the stems from the portobellos, and all the other ingredients. The filling proportions were just perfect.

The marinade is awesome!! Adjust flavors accordingly. I added cooked crumbled bacon to the spinach mixture. Drizzled left over marinade over the top prior to serving. Will make again

A very good recipie as is but use your judgement: if you like more subtle flavors adjust the marinade according to your tastes. As long as you are using fresh ingredients and adjust to what you know you like, you can't go wrong with this list of ingredients.

Things that may have contributed to the failure of this dish: 1) The recipe was out of my league. 2) The portobellos I bought were too small. 3) The portobellos had been sitting in my fridge for too long and did something funny with the marinade. 4) The marinade was awful. Way too strong. 5) There was WAY too much stuffing. I could have made the dish 4 times over with the amount I had. Perhaps a 1/4 pound of button mushrooms would have been better. 6) Also had a TON of marinade leftover. All in all, I think this recipe was poorly written, as the proportions are all out of whack, and it was a very heavy dish overall. If you try this, cut all the stuffing ingredients by at least half, especially the button mushrooms. Actually, I think it would have been better without them at all.

While not a vegetarian, I am always looking for great vegetarian recipes to reduce meat consumption. This one is fabulous. I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. I prepped everything, picked up a friend at the airport, finished it when I got home and served it with vegetable soup, couscous, and salad. We were full!

WOW!! Guests licked the plate. The recipe yields twice as much stuffing as you need. The next day, I spread the leftover stuffing on ciabatta and baked for 12 minutes for a nice hors d'ouevre.

I enjoyed this but would reduce the soy sauce in the marinade by half. It was too strong for my taste. I had leftovers and reheated them in the oven and it worked well.

The marinade creates a hearty flavor base for the delicate herbed cheese and spinach filling. I saved the marinade for the beginnings of a salad dressing to compliment the dinner.
