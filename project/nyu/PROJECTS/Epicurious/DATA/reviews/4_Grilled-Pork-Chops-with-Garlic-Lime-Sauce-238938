My family loved these pork chops. I recommend using a high quality, thick-cut chop. I've made these pork chops three times now, and each time it's been like eating the best steak! So moist and juicy and flavorful and perfect grilled flavor.

Rating: 3
aekelley is right. Brining the pork for an hour, using extra garlic (I used 6 cloves) and cilantro as others have suggested puts this recipe over the top. I will make this easy recipe again and again. But as written, it only deserves 3 stars.

the 'dressing' was fantastic!! Pork chops were a bit overdone, but that was 'user' error. Will use this again and again.

Not gourmet exactly, but exceptionally easy, quick,and tasty! Made it twice, followed the recipe,except I don't measure much:) Topped the chops one night with slices of avocado. Tonight, lighly grilled some sliced, fresh pineapple and laid on top of the sauce. Both were delicious additions and a nice compliment to the cilantro, garlic and lime sauce.

Rating: 4
This was so good and so simple! I followed the recipe almost exactly but substituted pork loin for the chops. I sliced the loin thin, put the sauce over it, and then served it with guacamole and cilantro lime rice with hatch chili tortillas (like pork tacos). As usual, I used extra garlic. Very few dishes, simple, bright flavors...a win in my book!

Rating: 4
This was excellent! Grilled the pork chops for 6 minutes total. I used the suggestions of others and upped the garlic. I did not increase the cilantro and found it to be 'just right'. Even my suddenly-picky-eater teenagers like it! I'm saving this recipe and will make it again!

Rating: 3
So I am giving the recipe 3 stars because it was the reviews that made this recipe 4 stars. I followed the instructions to brine and added more garlic and cilantro than the recipe called for. But this was hands down the best pork chop I have ever eaten. I finally didnt over cook a chop!!! The timing was spot on. The sauce was absolutely perfect and went really well on stake in addition to the chops. yum!!!!!

Brining will definitely keep these chops more tender and juicy. Flavors are good, but this is just an average recipe...something I'd throw together quickly in a pinch. Nothing special.

Maybe I should have brined the chops before grilling because they were kind of dry. The sauce, however, was excellent. I upped the garlic and cilantro.

Holy yum! I'd never made pork chops before this recipe. These were soo good. I used bone-in pork chops. Brined them for 1 hour prior to grilling. I ended up grilling them for about 10 minutes, and they were incredible! Will definitely make this again! Great supper recipe.

This was amazing. Hubby loved it, I replaced the lime juice with white wine and used fresh oregano instead of cilantro (I spent all afternoon making salsa, so I used all the cilantro I had on hand)and I sauted some fresh from my garden squash.

I thought this dish was very uninspired. Certainly citrus and pork are a great combo, but this just didn't have enough oomph to make it interesting.

This is amazing! Extremely easy to make and had great flavor. After reading the other reviews I decided to make extra amounts of the vinaigrette with extra garlic. I also made the black bean and tomato dish but used long grain jasmine rice instead of quinoa which was also very good. I cant wait to make it again!

As suggested, I brined the chops, not even for the suggested 60 minutes but for 45. This was my first time brining. I have never done it before because I was worried about the food being too salty. I brined for 45 minutes, rinsed well in cold water, patted dry, grilled, and... the chops were salty. The cilantro vinagrette was very basic; I didn`t understand the wows there, either. So this recipe didn`t work for me, and I wouldn`t make it again.

This was the best pork chop recipe I have ever made and it was so easy. Even though my pork chops looked beautiful, I brined them in what I had at home -- 2 quarts water, 1 c. kosher salt, 1/2 c. sugar, 4 bay leaves and 4 whole cloves (I have no juniper berries as per the suggestion of another reviewer). Boiled it all, then cooled before brining, which I did for one hour. Then even though I have fresh garlic, I used 4 squares of Trader Joe's pureed and frozen garlic which is so easy in the sauce/marinade in addition to the lime, olive oil, cilantro, etc. When I grilled the chops, I spread each side with the sauce, then dribbled the rest of it over the chops when done. I just ate a cold left over piece which was just as delicious as last night!

Rating: 4
made this last night in no time. tasted wonderful. got rave reviews. the sauce was the highlight and i would use it over any kind of meat. if you have time definitely follow other reviewers advice to soak the chops in saltwater bath.

Rating: 4
If you are using thin pork chops, I would recommend brining rather than marinating. One of the spectacular sensations of this recipe is the contrast between the meaty, grilled pork and the garlic lime sauce. You will diminish that contrast if you use the same sauce as a marinade. For a nice porky brine, use 1 qt.water, a half-cup kosher salt, a quarter-cup sugar, 2 bay leaves, 2 dried chilies, 4 crushed juniper berries. Let it simmer gently until you have a nice aroma, remove from heat and cool to room temp. (you can add ice cubes). Place the chops in the brine and allow them only an hour, and rinse them again under cold water. They will plump up and when you barbecue them, they will be juicy and full of flavor. I made this last night on the barbecue with an econo- pack of boneless chops and they were absolutely wonderful! I have been making it for a long time using the stove-top grilling method, but brining and barbecuing is a better method.

This was easy and delicious- definitely one I'll make again. I brined the chops in salt water for 30 minutes and then just threw them on an oiled grill pan. They were very juicy and the vinaigrette is a great compliment. Try it!

simple yet great recipe! i brined the pork chops before, which i've never done before, but it was definitely worth it. The meat was juicy and full of flavor.

Quite good but not great. I brined mine for 5 hours and that was plenty ie. on the very of being too salty. I don't know how one of the other reviewers could have brined theirs for 12 hours and recommended 24! I also added a lug of fish sauce. This reminded me of a similar recipe for Vietnamese pork chops where you marinate them a citrusy garlicky sauce but add liquefied lemongrass stalks.

Rating: 3
This was a simple good recipe. But I may try marinating it with the vinaigrette before cooking the pork for more flavor.

Yum! This was delicious. I followed other reviewers suggestions and brined the pork, which made it super salty, but still yummy. I served with white rice and black beans. I think I'll try this recipe with chicken instead next time.

Delicious idea. I made a meal out of this, the cheesy creamed corn, and the acorn squash with lime-chili vinaigrette. I actually used the squash's sauce for both squash and pork--it's very similar except it uses a fresh pepper. Very very good!

Super easy, super fast.....incredibly flavourful...definitely will make again. We had super thick chops, so they did 7 min per side.....but incredibly flavourful.

Followed the advice of others and brined in salt and brown sugar. Then I seasoned it with pepper and adobo seasoning, and seared the chops in my cast iron pan before throwing it in a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes. Sauce was the perfect complement. So simple, and so amazing. My bf could not stop gushing about how good it was.

Rating: 4
My skeptical husband thought that grilled pork chops would be dry. Boy, was he surprised! These were excellent - and I will definitely make them again. I did not have cilantro, so I substituted fresh Italian flat leaf parsley. I will definitely try them with cilantro next time, but the parsley was a good substitute. I marinated the chops for about 45 minutes before grilling and the flavor came through nicely. I will also try this vinaigrette with pork tenderloin - it doesn't overpower the meat as some marinades do. A four fork winner!

Rating: 4
I definitely brined the pork chops in 1 1/2 cups of kosher salt and some brown sugar for 12 hours - probably could have done 24 hours. Anyways, the garlic line sauce was very good, albeit tart from the lime juice. It certainly gave nice flavor to what could have been just a boring pork chop.

Rating: 3
I will definitely use this recipe frequently when I make pork chops. It had great flavor. If anything I would reduce the olive oil a little, maybe down to 1/4 cup. All I had was good quality olive oil, and its taste ended up coming through in the end flavor more than I preferred.

Rating: 3
As suggested, I brined first. Then I marinated using the same ingredients as the vinaigrette, substituting only the lime juice for lime zest (I think a long marinade sometimes makes the meat texture strange). Turned out very good. Paired with the Quinoa and Black Bean Salad also from this site instead of suggested one, which was fantastic.

Rating: 4
One addition really makes this sauce. Add about a tablespoon of good quality fish sauce. All the other elements are there but the fish sauce brings more depth and richness to the sauce. I also added a second clove of garlic. Very tasty , will make again!

This was REALLY good! When I tasted the sauce as I was making it, I wasn't so sure I was going to like it as much as the other reviewers. But once you put it on the pork, it all comes together very nicely. We decided to try the sauce with our steamed artichokes and - WOW!

Yum Yum triple yum. My 5 year old doesn't like pork, but loved this combination of flavors. Actually, she doesn't like Cilantro either! Used extra thick pork cut, so I seared it on a grill pan each side then covered and lowered heat for another 4 or 5 minutes per side. Very juicey. Definitely agree with the recommendation to pair dish with lime-black bean couscous and cilantro salad.

Sorry--forgot something important. I brined the pork chops for one hour. Then, I dusted them with salt, peopper, cumin and hot curry and put them in the refrigerator for eight hours. That seasoning made the dish; it gave the chops a wonderful crust as they cooked.

Rating: 4
This was great. I added more garlic and lime zest. Make sure you stream the oil into the dressing and not add it all at once. Adding it slowly gives it the consistency you want. I sliced the pork chops in thin slices and fanned them on the plate. Need to find other sides as I was not a huge fan of the quinoa dish featured with this.

Rating: 4
This is a spectacular recipe, and it goes spectacularly with Black-Bean and Tomato Quinoa (also found on this site). The sauce really makes the dish, and I doubled it...and still barely had enough. The quinoa, for me, has been typically bland, however, this is very lively and paired well with the pork.

Rating: 4
I have never written in before regarding a recipe....but this one is outstanding. I followed suggestions and brined the chops (1/2 cup of kosher salt in 1 quart of water..for 4 hours). Added 2 garlic cloves instead of one, but otherwise followed the recipe. Truly delicious. Thanks to those who suggested the Black-Bean and Tomato Quinoa. I made this for my family but can't wait to share this meal with guests.

My family really liked this - even my daughter who is not overly fond of pork. I used bottled lime juice and omitted the cilantro. Still came out great! We used the sauce on steamed broccoli and it was yummy! Based on the numerous reviews (thanks everyone!) I also brined my chops for 20 minutes or so before drying them off, oiling and grilling. This one's a keeper for my family.

I have not made pork chops in so long because they were so bland and boring, but this recipe is unbelievable. I followed the suggestion of one of one of the reviewers and brined the pork before cooking. I had never tried this before and it turned the pork to filet mignon. Everyone needs to try this recipe. Outstanding and so easy to prepare.

Very tasty dinner. Agree that is it best served with the Black-Bean and Tomato Quinoa. Made the recipe as written (but doubled the garlic, of course). We brined the pork chops ahead of time, but didn't marinate them in the sauce. The flavors were bright and refreshing and kept the pork from being dry. Will definitely add this to the "keepers list."

I have prepared these twice, and they were delicious, using this variation: Prepare the citrus vinaigrette; I used extra cilantro, minced in mini- processor, so that the sauce becomes thicker, almost a chimichurri. Place the pork chops in a plastic bag, add appx. one Tbsp. of vinaigrette per chop; squish plastic bag tight to distribute sauce, and let the chops sit in the marinade appx. 20 minutes before grilling. After grilling, spoon some of the reserved sauce over the hot chops. I have had leftover sauce, kept it to use as a chimichurri to cook and serve on other meat (e.g. chicken breasts) throughout the week.

I am going to be the only reviewer to say I did not care for this dish. I even marinaded the chops for three hours and I still felt it didn't have much taste on the grilled chops. Perhaps it would be better over a fish, as some suggested?

I hardly ever eat meat but made this recipe. I brined the chops, followed the recipe and used a grill pan. I loved it. The chops were moist and I'd use that sauce on chicken and some fish. It's a keeper. The quinoa needs a bit more dressing so I added some more lime to the left over and it was good. I also served it with an escarole, white bean and pepita salad I found on the site. It was a great dinner and my guest enjoyed it as well.

I made the sauce, to be served with chicken breast knowing it would be placed in freezer for another day. My wife and I both enjoyed this one a lot.

I'm not a big fan of pork usually, but this was an incredible recipe. I brined the chops overnight per other readers' suggestions, and the result was a tender, juicy, mouthwatering texture and flavor.

My wife and I had a package of pork chops sitting in the freezer, but neither or us are usually real big fans of pork chops. After making this both of our opinions have changed. This was fantastic. As others have suggested, I brined them first and then followed the recipe as written. The chops came out tender and juicy, and the lime sauce was perfect (especially the hint of heat from the red- pepper flakes). I didn't have any quinoa, so I made the "Toasted Garlic Rice w/ Fresh Herbs and Lime" (also from this site). The only problem was that I felt the flavors were too similar, but that's my fault for making two dishes with nearly identical ingredients (my wife loved it though, she even went back for a second helping of rice with some of the extra sauce from this recipe). And I can't wait to try the sauce on some fish.

I have made this whole menu several times, for family gatherings and just for "us" at home. Everyone - from Nonno at 77 to the youngest at 9 - loved, loved, loved it. The sauce was also served over grilled haloumi cheese for the vegetarian in the family...and was a hit there, too. Since then, have also used it as a salad dressing, for grilled tuna, and for a steak topping (like a quick and dirty chimichuri). I always have more hot pepper on the table for those who want it even hotter!

I find that cooking with a citrus flavor in general can be quite bland without adding a bit of zest, which is what really provides the bit of zing I am looking for with citrus.

This was good but really got the 4 forks because it was so easy and fast. I used 1.5 tablespoons of olive oil instead of 1/3 cup.

I also made the side as black bean and tomato barley as I didn't have quinoa on hand. It complemented the pork well.

I would definitely make this again!

I've tried this recipe twice and found that the difference between OK and really good was brining the pork chops. I put the chops in a quart of water with 1/4 cup salt and 1/3 cup brown sugar.

I recommend using Braggs Liquid Amino (salt substitute) and pepper to marinate the chops at least half hour before grilling. the flavour goes through the chops. I didnt have cilantro so I used fresh dill and it was good. I also substituted the pepper flakes in the lime sauce with powdered chile based jerk seasoning. It had a real kick.

Liked the simplicity of this recipe. Prior to grilling the chops, I sprinkled freshly cracked pepper corns onto them. The lime/pepper combination was very nice but the lime flavour was lost slightly. Next time I would reduce the olive oil to 1/4 cup (same as the lime juice) and add the zest of the lime to intensify the lime flavour.
