I gave this cake 3 forks for its texture and because it is so easy and quick to make. I liked it, nice and moist but flavor is just ok, the orange flavor is not as pronounced as I would've liked even though I used more zest than in the recipe.

After the first few times making this cake and having it fall in the middle I started using the tube insert with my 9" springform pan which completely eliminates that possibility - an improvement, in my opinion, on an already winning recipe. My main alteration to the ingredients is reducing the sugar to a scant 3/4 cup.

Outstanding cake - easy to make, very tender and delicious. Used pecans (toasted) instead of walnuts and replaced 2 eggs with 3 egg whites. Used only 1 cup sugar. Everyone loved it.

Really delicious (especially the crust). Toasted the walnuts and put in a whole orange's worth of zest (will use two oranges next time). Mine also fell, so I looked at my collection of other recipes for nut cakes. They call for beating the egg whites into stiff peaks and then folding in the nuts and flour. I'm not sure this is worth the trouble. Also, to the Santa Fe cook - you're misreading the recipe which calls for only 1 Tbl (3 teaspoons) of baking power.

I baked this cake today and it climbed all over the inside of my new Breville oven. I adjusted the baking powder down to 7 teaspoons because we're at 7,200 feet elevation. What a mess it made ! It smelled delicious. Has anyone else baked this at a high elevation. Would appreciate any tips. Penelope of Santa Fe

First I'd like to thank the other reviewers for their very helpful hints. (This is what these recipe reviews are meant to be.) First, I greased the pan really well so that the batter wouldn't have anything to "climb" on. When it came time to make the cake, I discovered I had only one navel orange. I grated all of the zest, but there wasn't enough juice. So I thawed frozen concentrated orange juice to make up the rest. I didn't dilute it because I thought it would provide more orange flavour. It might or might not have contributed to the lack of sinking in the centre that other reviewers noted. I also beat the batter longer, as other reviewers suggested. My cake turned out with a perfectly flat top with no cracks. In fact, I think it was probably the flattest, most perfect looking cake I ever made. To my mind, it had just the right amount of orange flavour and just the right amount of crunch. My husband thought it was fabulous and and ate a large piece of it for breakfast the next day.

A bit too much oil! I used walnut oil instead of the olive oil. the cake was too moist. I think that I'll use a bit less oil next time.

Rating: 4
I forgot to add that I decreased the sugar by slightly over 1/4 cup per other reviewers and think that proportion is very good. I was afraid to reduce a full 1/2 cup without changing other ingredient proportions.

My husband thinks this cake is perfect and the 4 forks are mostly his rating. (I'd give it 3+) I used the zest of a whole orange, using my microplane. This gives a LOT of zest and I can't imagine using any less. I also had a scant tablespoon of pear butter at the bottom of a jar, so I scooped it all out into my measuring cup, and than topped off the measure with the olive oil. I beat the eggs a little longer than the recipe states. I had a perfectly lovely flat top with no sinking as others had. I also ground my walnuts to the size of very coarse cornmeal which seemed just right in the finished cake - small enough to give an even crumb, but large enough to give chew and crunch. Absolutely, toast the nuts and let them cool before processing them. I served it with caramelized pear halves.

The strength of this recipe is its simplicity and wonderful taste. It's now a standard staple in my household. By now, I use olive oil, decraese the sugar by about half a cup, and increase the orange zest--fabulous!

After reading the enthusiastic reviews of this recipe, I was eager to try it as I am always on the lookout for non-dairy desserts. The cake was light, moist and walnutty just the sort of thing you'd want in a coffee cake. Missing, to its detriment, was the zingy, bright, sweet taste of orange to contrast with the earthy, nuttiness of the walnuts. Could it be that there was just not enough orange zest? _If_ I make it again, I think I would triple the amount of orange zest to bring out the orange flavor. Next time, I won't be quite so persuaded by other reviews, one cooks's AMAZING is another cook's so-so. Based on my experience, I give the cake 2 forks and continue my quest elsewhere for non-dairy dessert recipes.

Wow, this cake is so surprisingly good. One of our family's favourites. My husband found this recipe as he was looking for something easy and we have both made it many times since.

Easily one of my most favorite cakes - moist, fluffy, flavorful and light. I added a teaspoon of orange extract to boost the orange flavor. Next time I may add chocolate chips or drizzle the top with chocolate. I served it with vanilla ice cream on the side - but there are many accessories that could accompany this cake: whipped cream, fruit, creme anglaise, chocolate, orange marmalade, etc etc

I found this to be a good recipe. As a variation, it becomes very sophisticated if the oil is replaced with butter and the cake is topped with Grand Marnier ganache.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. : ) Though next time, I'll add more orange zest to bring out the flavor more.

Rating: 3
It was nice, perhaps I pulverised the walnuts too much as the middle was only slightly crunchy. The orange also only faintly came through, it could probably use a little more zest and maybe some cinnamon.

I wanted to make this cake because I had all the ingredients on hand and because it was very well rated. It's so simple yet tastes very refined. It's crunchy and soft on the inside and has a crispy crust on the outside. The orange flavour is a great complement. I did use half the olive oil and replaced the other half with butter as I thought my Ikarian olive oil might have been a bit too flavourful. Great, simple cake.

This is a great cake. I've made it a dozen or more times. Have successfully substituted pecans for walnuts. The cake will collapse in the center more often than not when making this recipe. I can't seem to identify the factor(s) which prevent the cake from collapsing...any suggestions? All the same, the flavors are fantastic. I also recommend adding orange flower water, which adds wonderful flavor.

Very good. Mine did not fall at all but was a tad dry. I might have over processed the nuts because there was NO crunchiness! I served like the photo, with a dollop of whipped cream and finely grated orange peel.

Although I made this cake for dessert, I was expecting something like a coffee cake. And while I am eating it now for breakfast the next day, it is truly a fabulous cake. I replaced lemon juice and zest for the orange, and am stunned by how fresh and delightful the flavor is. I did not change the amount of sugar, although I might have if I'd used sweeter orange as the recipe called for, but 1 1/2 cups is perfect with tart lemon. I also toasted the walnuts first, and I echo the delicious crust that forms on this cake as well as how moist but not dense it is.

This is an excellent healthier cake that will also be a hit with non health conscious folks. The cake is moist with a crunchy crust and delicious flavor. The orange zest beautifully compliments the walnut flavor. Some reviewers reduced the sugar, but I didn't think this cake was too sweet. I toasted the walnuts (8 minutes at 350) before putting them in the processor and I think this enhanced the flavor. The center did sink, but this was not really a problem with such a simple homespun cake that isn't meant to be frosted. Some reviewers suggested more mixing of the batter to eliminate this, but I did not do it since sometimes over-beating results in a tough product. This cake will definitely get made many times again.

This cake was incredibly easy to make, and it had a moist, light crumb when baked. It rose and fell, but the crisp crust made up for that fact. The batter was incredible, and my friend and I could not stop dipping into it with a spoon. Problems: My immediate reaction when tasting the finished product was that I forgot the salt. Re-reading the recipe, I realized that there is no salt, which would have provided a much-needed contrast to the overly sweet flavors of orange, fruity oil, and sugar. So next time, I would definitely add salt and toast the walnuts as a way of providing depth. Also: The similar lemon olive-oil cake on this site is to DIE FOR.

Made this cake for the first time just now and tasted it. WOW, awesome. Very light and tasty. Next time I will toast the walnuts. Im going to have another piece now. Maybe will not save any for my company......hmmm....

Fantastic cake. Very nutty and delicious. I used melted butter instead of oil. Served it with an improvised siding: cream cheese spread, thinned with cream, a bit of sugar and zest of one orange. Just perfect.

Rating: 4
Great cake. Yes, it did sink but it was like there was a border - the sinking was consistent and the border gave a fine crustlike taste. Used butter and not olive oil. Will try with 1/2 cup less sugar next time and with olive oil. Deifinately a keeper

I used pecans and hazelnuts since I didn't have any walnuts. It was delicious - you could really taste the nuts and the orange and I will definitely make it again and try different types of nuts and citrus.

This is my go-to cake recipe. I have made this cake on numerous occassion. It's simple and full proof and great for all ocassion. I usually toast the walnut first and cut back on the sugar...I'm glad that I found this recipe.

This cake is my "go-to" cake. I have memorized the recipe by heart. It is simply delicious and very very forgiving. It's hard to mess-up. I usually toast the walnut first; it gives it a more roasty taste. I've even cut back the sugar by 1/4 to 1/2, depending on my mood. It's great for every occassion.

I had the same problem with sinking in the middle - and I mixed longer and used good baking powder. I used a 8" springform and made 2 mini-bundt cakes with the remaining batter. I really liked the way it came out in the bundt - but, even with a lot of non-stick spray, it stuck to the sides of the bundt (FYI). I might try a 10-cup bundt next time, and hope it doesn't stick! This is really great, light cake - perfect for those that don't like a super sweet cake. It almost has a coffee-cake type quality to it and is really easy to make!

Rating: 4
Re sinking: my cake sunk in the middle as well, but I think it was because it seemed to climb the high sides of the springform pan almost like a souffle. Plan to try a shorter pan that has less for the cake to grab onto on the side...maybe the middle won't be so empty, causing the puffing and subsequent sinking (like a souffle).

This has become my favorite dessert. A wonderful cake, just the right density, moist, keeps well. I just love it....and love that it has such healthy ingredients (walnuts, olive oil0. Try it. You will not be disappointed.

Oops...I must have had "first review" jitters as I forgot to rate the recipe with my review. Of course, I give this recipe 4 forks (would give it 5 if I could).

I have almost lost track of how many times I have baked this cake -- I would guess about 8-10 times. In an effort to help reviewers who have reported "sinking",I note that my results improved after the first couple of times with this recipe as I mixed the batter longer after the addition of the flour/walnut mixture and also after the addition of the liquid ingredients. This eliminated sinking entirely. Also, as we found the cake too sweet for our liking, I reduced amount of sugar to 1 cup (1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda) with excellent results. Of course, if you continue to have "sinking" results,make sure your baking powder is still active. I served this cake at a couple of parties and get-togethers to raves. We love this cake chez nous even when there is no "occasion".

exceptional recipe and difficult to mess up. for my first rendition I used a bundt pan and reduced baking time to 30 minutes, it worked well. For the second, I used whole wheat flour, extra virgin olive oil, and didn't process my nuts--I just put them into a freezer bag and used a rolling pin, and it worked out great. One less appliance to clean is always a good thing in my book! I've also used tangerines to great results.

Very easy and delicious! We didn't have whipped cream, so just served it plain with some powdered sugar on top - not too sweet, but very tasty.

a very tasty cake, nice flavors, an easy recipe with good results. i used my everyday olive oil, so there wasn't an overpowering taste. didn't use a spring form pan, baked for only 50 minutes. no problems with sinking. and yes, let cool a bit before handling.

Fabulously moist cake which I made for our weekly Patriot's Game party. Everyone loved it and gave a four fork rating. Only negative was that the cake sunk in the middle, so I lowered the rating. Can anyone suggest how to avoid this? Also, made in a 10-inch springform and increased everything by 1/3. Delicious!

Fantastic. Incredibly moist, so simple to make, and the flavor from the walnut and olive oil is great. I toasted my walnuts before grinding them. A hit at my dinner party and I thoroughly enjoyed eating the leftovers.

Fabulous cake. Baked 6 times and it falls in center. Someone please advise. Am I over mixing eggs and sugar? Use med/dark pan and 350Degree oven.I give it 4 forks for taste and texture. I want to bake it perfect as written. I use White Lily all-purpose flour. I use high speed on heavy duty Kitchen Aid mixer with beater. Thanks

Phenomenal cake. Very moist and not too sweet. Also lasts for several days, and still tastes great. I've made twice...the second time, substituting pecans...which also worked well.

This cake was moist and delicious, as well as easy to make! I served it with a dollop of whipped cream and some extra orange zest. Next time I might even add a touch of Grand Marnier upon serving. Leftover cake made a great treat this morning!

Very tasty, nicely sweet, and very moist, thanks to the olive oil.

Excelent tea cake! Goes well with a good cup of Assam or Earl Gray. I subsituted Canola Oil for the Olive Oil as I prefer a lighter oil taste with my sweets. I will try it next time with Olive Oil. This cake is light fluffy and a aromatic delight even several days after the cake has been made.

I must say that I was skeptical about using olive oil in a cake recipe, but this worked nicely. I added a dollop of whipped cream to each slice flavored with orange oil and powdered sugar. Yum!
