Re: A Cook from Germany I prefer to use individual ramekins, as well, for presentation purposes. Did you change the cooking time in this recipe to accommodate for the change from the single souffle dish? I imagine it would take less time to cook.

This was great! I had some 'real' muenster from a trip to Alsace that I didn't know how I would use up and this did the trick! I used individual ramekins instead of 1 souffle dish. Baked them all up then refrigerated un-eaten ones for the next day. I think they would reheat good in an oven, but all I had was microwave at work and it was ok, though not as good as fresh out of the oven.

This is the first time I ate a soufflé. It was a nice dish but more of a breakfast than dinner. We were left hugry afterwards. It's fluffier than I thought. I was surprised that I got it so fluffy because I don't have an electric eggbeater. Actualy I didn't have a soouflé dish either, just some small pots, so I baked them there. It really puffed up and overflowed. but we ate it all, it was ok. Finally! I'm glad we got rid of that stinky cheese in the fridge. We kept thinking it was the trash, but now that it's gone, we know it was the cheese.

I'd never made a souffle before, and all my souffle dishes were too large, but a round Pyrex casserole worked just fine. It was far easier than I'd imagined and tasted delicious. But I think I cooked it a little too long (less than the 28 minutes specified), as it wasn't runny as shown in the picture. I definitely plan to make it again.

This is a response to Carolyn from Boston about soy milk. I did a search on soy milk souffles, and oddly enough, came up with one on this very site. If you look at the recipe for Ginger-Pumpkin Souffle, it states that soy milk can indeed be a healthy substitute for whole milk. Good luck with the recipe! I know I intend to try it this week :).

Very yummy - although I was concerned about the consistency of the roux. It got very lumpy. I think next time I will use the same amount of butter and flour so that it doesn't thicken everything quite so much - because my souffle didn't rise as much as I thought it should. Otherwise delicious!

I made this for a dinner party and it came out fabulous! I did not even use a soufflé dish, just a glass Pyrex, and it still had a great consistency and tasted wonderful. Served it with the red bell pepper salad and it was a real hit. Definitely will make again!

Appologies for asking a question and not rating this recipe: is it possible to make this sort of souffle with non-dairy liquids, like soy milk? Is there a food science reason for the milk?

A roux is the thickening paste made by cooking a fat (butter, here) and the flour.

what does "roux" mean?

This was so much fun to make!! My friend and I had fun telling the kids to stay out of the kitchen and don't run around because we didn't want the souffle to "fall"! They were so funny tip-toeing around us that it was a game. As far as the recipe goes, it was simple, it was so tasty, and the accompaning salad was fantastic! We marinated some flank steak and grilled it up and had a fantastic lunch.On a personal note, my six year old has mono so his throat is very swollen and the souffle went down so well he had 3 (child sized) servings! A total hit and what a great spring dish!
