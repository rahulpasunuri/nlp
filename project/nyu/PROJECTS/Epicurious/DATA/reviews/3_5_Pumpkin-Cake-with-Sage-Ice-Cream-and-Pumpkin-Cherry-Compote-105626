I really like this recipe, but I did change it a little. It was forgiving in that I wanted to make it slightly healthier. I only used 1/2 cup of oil, and added 1/2 cup non fat yogurt, and I used slightly less sugar. I did add a fine zest of one orange and a little bit of ground clove and nutmeg as some of the previous reviewers said it was bland. The cake came out really moist and tasty. I bought ice cream and made my own cherry compote, it all worked well.

I made the cake only of this recipe. I was making a birthday cake for someone and frosting it as a Pumpkin. I made two of these cakes actually. Using a 10" bunt pan each time; trimming the tops off and putting one atop the other and frosting with orange colored butter and cream cheese frosting. The cake is good. Not great but good. It is very similar to a Pumpkin bread recipe I make every year but dryer and much less spicer. In my bread I use ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and allspice so the bread has a lot more flavor. The bread also uses 3 cups of sugar so is also a lot sweeter and moister. Back to the cake. It is good but if I was to make again I would throw in the extra spices. Because I used a 10" bunt pan the cake also took about 10-15mins longer. It did NOT over cook the outside which is what I feared and was still dense and moist enough to keep it's flavor. Nothing worse than a dry cake. I did not make the compote or ice cream.

A terrific recipe, and definitely worth making all three parts. My guests were blown away, especially by the sage ice cream, which I have since made separately also to great reviews. (also try the lemon verbena ice cream recipe at Epi) -- Instead of arrop (which is expensive and hard to get) I just boil down some port wine with a bit of the pumpkin until it becomes syrup, then run it through a fine mesh (mashing the pumpkin) and discarding the fiber.

I was looking for an easy pumpkin muffin recipe and found this cake recipe. Used cake flour, 1/4 cup less sugar,egg whites and a square muffin tin. Baked for 20 minutes and the muffins were to die for! Light and airy but not too sweet. A keeper.

I made a shortcut version of this and it turned out very popular at a pumpkin dinner party. Instead of the ice cream I made sage and lemon zest infused whipped cream (Bring cream to a boil with sage and lemon zest. Infuse for 10 minutes. Strain. Let it cool. Refrigerate til it's cold again. Then whip). I skipped the compote. Light yet interesting.

I highly recommend making all three components to this recipe. The cake has a very good texture but it is plain by itself. It works very well with the compote. The sage ice cream recipe is amazingly rich. I made this during the winter and I only had dried sage from my garden. It worked very well. I used the leftover egg whites to make an angel food cake. The ice cream sends this dessert over the top. I couldn't obtain arrop to drizzle over the ice cream so I did a reduction of white grape juice concentrate and pumpkin until I had a syrup. All of the above is a bit of work but it can all be done way ahead. Go for it!

VERY BLAND CAKE. I only needed a pumpkin cake recipe, so I didn't make the Ice Cream or Compote; and I have to say that it is very, very bland. I even used more pumpkin puree than it called for. I won't use this recipe again. It must be better with all of the "fixins".

This was a delicious cake! Very moist! I did not make the ice cream or compote and thought the cake was great just with coffee or tea. had a wonderful fall pumkin and spice flavor. I replaced 1/2 the oil with 1/2 c unsweetend apple sauce. I added 1/2 t ginger. I baked it for 22 minutes at 350 in a convection oven - it tested clean but was quite/almost too moist in the middle. I would increae the time slightly next time. But i will definitely make it again!

The first time I made this cake, my husband and I finished it so quickly that I had to make it again the same week! It's SO quick and easy to mix up! The taste is fantastic, though I do recommend using some applesauce to replace some of the oil. I haven't tried the ice cream or the compote, but I can't wait to have an excuse to make this full recipe!

Delicious cake recipe. I replaced 2/3 of the oil with applesauce and baked muffins instead of a cake. Rave reviews from guests.

I only made the cake. I doubled the recipe to make four small loaves and one 9-inch round cake. I subbed half of the oil with applesauce, added 1 tsp. of ground ginger, and made a streusel topping. The loaves/cake was received most enthusiastically! I had a few slices, and the spice combination was perfect, the cake moist and crunchy with the topping, and it was not too sweet (or not not sweet enough!). I highly recommend this cake/quick bread recipe!

Make the ice cream, it compliments the cake very well. I made the ice cream and cake combination for the holidays and I get raves especially when they found out what the ice cream flavor was! I cater professionally and use this all the time for holiday parties. Don't be afraid to do the ice cream.

I only made the cake. It came out denser than pictured, and wasn't very sweet, more like a moist pumpkin bread. Alone, it's not sweet enough (and I don't have a sweet tooth); however, paired with (vanilla) ice cream, I keep hearing "WOW, that's FANTASTIC" from the other half. I mixed a bit of white suger, flour, butter, and dried cranberries over the top, sprinkled over before baking. I also reduced the oil by half, added some melted butter and a dallop of extra pumpkin to the batter.

I only made the cake in this recipe. the pumpkin and spice flavors were great. I also thought the oil flavor was a little to strong for this cake and would try using applesauce next time. I could imagine the ice cream and compote that accompanies this cake would all go well.

This is simply a wonderful cake, insanely easy. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a rectangular cake pan,to use as the graveyard base for a large gingerbread haunted hause for Halloween. I added crystallized ginger to the batter and filled it with praline buttercream, frosted the outside with gianduja buttercream. It was very tasty.

I made only the cake, since I needed to use up some pumpkin and I could make it with just what I had in the pantry. Plain, without any icing or accompaniment, it's a nice, simple (and very easy!) dessert, and great as a snack with coffee or tea. Taking a cue from my favorite spice cookie recipe, I added 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper, which gives it a very subtle hint of spice. Next time I might replace a bit of the oil with applesauce-- I found the oil flavor and texture a bit strong, but the cake is definitely nicely dense and moist.

I also made only the cake, which was incredibly moist and delicious. I used only 1 1/4 cups brown sugar as I like a more subtly sweet cake. I also cut the oil to 3/4 cup...

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year. I unlike the rest of the reviewers made the ice cream and it was fantastic. The cake does have to cook longer than suggested. This was a big hit and a definite addition for the next big holiday event. Don't be afraid of the sage ice cream, it is a unique under tone to the ice cream it is not pernounced at all.

An excellent and moist pumpkin cake. (Like others, I also only made the cake recipe, but am intrigued by the ice cream and compote and may try them sometime). I normally prefer to use butter in cakes, but the canola oil made the cake very tender. The simple spicing provided a good balance of flavors. Made as a layer cake in two 8" pans frosted with orange cream cheese icing. The whole family enjoyed it, with some touting it as deserving of a "gold medal." : )

I made just the cake, baked it in one 10" round pan, and sliced it into two layers. Used Harry and David's Pear Butter with Honey and Walnuts for the filling between the layers, and made an icing with cream cheese (maybe 6oz? I was short), butter, brown sugar, powdered sugar, molasses, and lemon zest. Zowie! Unbelievable. Someday I'll try the sage ice cream and report back here then....

I HAVE MADE THIS CAKE FOR THANKGIVING EVERY YEAR SINCE IT WAS PUBLISHED IN YOUR MAGAZINE. I ALWAYS RECEIVE AMAZING COMPLEMENTS FROM MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

I only made the cake. It was great right out of the oven, but even better the next day. It tasted like a cross between cake and a crustless pumpkin pie. I will be serving this at thanksgiving with some homemade whipped cream. Yum! Note: I did not have enough light brown sugar, so I subbed out 3/4 C of dark brown. Also, My 2 1/2 year old daughter did most of the work. Really easy recipe.

I made this as a test run for Thanksgiving. I didn't make the ice cream, but did make the cake and the compote. I cut the ingredients in half for the cake, and instead of using oil I used applesauce. I was worried about it being too dry, so I actually used a full cup of applesauce (unsweetened), when technically a halved recipe should have been a 1/2 cup. I cooked it in a nine inch round cake pan. I was quite pleased with the results. It was extremely moist (in fact, became even moister as it sat in the fridge -- more like a smooth bread pudding or thick custard than a cake, but especially b/c it was pumpkin, I liked it that way). And my husband (not a pumpkin fan) said he liked it, too (he liked the presentation and the warm compote, but he sneaked back into the kitchen for more of the cake). Served it with vanilla ice cream and the compote, which was quite tasty. I think I cut down on the sugar in both the cake and the compote (no white sugar in the compote). All in all, worth serving at Thanksgiving (lovely presentation, still get the pumpkin flavor in w/out reverting to standard pumpkin pie) and also worth tinkering with to decide which texture is the best. I'm wondering if an apple-cranberry compote would be good as well, if chopping pumpkins is not what you want to do on a regular basis.
