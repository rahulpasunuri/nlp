I wasn't sure how well this recipe would execute...seemed to have many steps. However...it was the best thing we have made in recent history. The only change we made was to skip the slow-roasting of the tomatoes - we hsd small orange sweet 100's that were like candy and didn't deserve to be cooked. We should have filled the blossoms as soon as we got home from the farmer's market as they closed up later in the day and were somewhat difficult to fill. I used a ziplock back to pipe the filling in. The vinaigrette was amazing...definitely a recipe that we will be using again...although the shallots have a lingering taste - delicious...but it sticks around. The paper thin baby zucchini were perfect as well. Every component was good by itself and together it was truly something more than the sum of its parts. The pepitas are VERY important as well. Good texture and nuttiness for sure!

I really liked this recipe. The taste of the blossoms was delicate and the presentation was nice. I had never tried raw squash; it was great, but the mandoline is a must, unless you can really cut paper thin with a knife. Like others, I took a bunch of short cuts, as I don't have much time to cook. I used sun dried tomatoes, toasted pine nuts and store-bought tempura mix. With all the shortcuts, the recipe was fairly easy.

I can't give this 4 forks since I didn't make it completely according to the recipe. I used tweezers to remove the bitter stamen of the blossoms. Since the recipe involves frying, I towel dried all the ingredients I could after I washed them (blossoms, basil, etc). I took the goat cheese right out of the fridge and pan fried some meaty heirloom tomatoes to get the water out. The warm tomatoes with the cold cheese created a great cheese mixture temperature to work with. I not only added basil but also some parsley and used pine nuts instead of pumpkin seeds. I didn't have any club soda so I just used a quick egg dip before using flour in some trials and Japanese panko in the other. Both created yummy results with the panko, of course, creating more crunch. Since I don't like to deep fry, I only used about a centimeter or 2 of oil and fried the outside of the blossoms. The cheese mixture was already a nice temperature so it didn't need to sit in the oil too long.

This is a tricky recipe. I found that using Old Windmill Dairy fresh ExtraOrdinaire Chevre made this even more fabulous. Than I experimented and used their "Country Thyme" Chevre and it was even better. I agree with some of the other review as far getting the batter consistency just right. If you are in New Mexico check out www.theoldwindmilldairy.com they make fabulous cheeses.

I didn't have goat cheese, so thought I'd have to find another recipe to use my just- purchased squash blossoms, but discovered that I DID have cream cheese, so mixed it with a little dijon mustand for tangy flavor, and it worked well. Warning to those not familiar with squash blossoms - when washing them, watch for little critters. Not a problem, you just want to remove them before cooking.

Delicious and much easier to prepare than I expected. Like other reviewers, I used sun-dried tomatoes and a premade tempura mix. I harvested the blossoms from my garden just a few hours before stuffing them and they were remarkably sturdy and easy to handle. I used my own vinagrette on the baby squashes, zucchini, pattypan, and crookneck, also harvested from my garden. The meal was quite impressive and my family is still talking about it a week later. I highly recommend trying this gourmet delight.

I simplified this recipe a little, and it came out beautifully. I just did the blossoms, and left the tomatoes out altogether, using a splash of olive oil and more fresh basil and pumpkin seeds instead. It took me a couple of tries to get the batter to the right consistency--it was too thin at first, but if you thicken it too much, you can't see the gorgeous flowers through it. Using all-organic ingredients made this extra-fresh and delicious! An impressive-looking appetizer.

When everything comes together just right this dish is fantastic. Impressive and very flavorful. Tempura cooking can be tricky though. If the oil is too hot the delicate blossoms blow apart and the appeal is completely lost.

Oh lordy.... I had been searching for a way to use fresh squash blossoms, and I tried this recipe, but I was really disappointed. I don't know... the tempura-ed blossoms turned out sort of .... dry, or uninviting in some way, and definitely not as flavorful as I'd wished. Also, has anyone else found that the thinly sliced, raw squash was bitter, or basically unappealing? I used very very young squash, so I didn't think that would happen. All in all, my experimentation led to insanely delicious spiced banana stuffed blossoms, battered in a banana pancake batter and fried. The sugar in the batter gave them the crispy chewiness I was after. Also, these blossoms stuffed with finely cut grilled carne asada and a low-oil cheese (Oaxacan cheese worked lovely) are amazing cooked on foil on a barbeque.

I only made the squash blossoms and used this recipe as a guide. I stuffed them with herbed goat cheese, a chunk of plum tomato and a sliver of basil. I used a beer batter fry mix to coat them. It was easy and the result is terrifc. The blossoms are so light.

Made these as an hors d'ouevre....very delish. We were wanting to use the squash blosoms in our garden, without necessarily having to fuss a lot...so I took lots of shortcuts (maybe it's just me, but this recipe as written, seems very fussy!). I used sun-dried tomatoes (that I reconstituted in boiling water) instead of oven-drying fresh cherry tomatoes for 1 or 2 hours (hello!); and I skipped the shaved squash (don't have mandoline). I found that pooling the vinaigrette on one large plate and placing the blossoms on top looked cool; my last big shot-cut was using a tempura mix that I bought in the store: it just mixes with ice-cold water and you don't have to worry about the club soda thing (thruth is I had left-over tempura batter mix, so this was a perfect use for it). Also used half-and-half instead of whipping cream and pine nuts instead of pumpkin seeds (though I think I'd prefer pumpkin seeds). Also, I didn't really deep fry them, just pan-fried in a generous amount of oil. We thought they were fab...try them!
