Amazingly good! I was under a time crunch, so I did the cakes several days in advance, wrapped the muffin tins with foil and came back to them the day of the party. It was great because the frozen cakes were so easy to coat with the ganache. My guests practically licked their plates!

This is not really a cake, but a baked mousse. It was restaurant-quality delicious, anyway. I used Frangelico instead of amaretto.

I made the recipe using silicone semicircular muffin cups (in the water bath), and after coating with the ganache sprinkled some colored sugar on top to make the cakes look a little like Christmas tree balls, and the presentation was marvelous. They tasted just terrific as well, a perfect dessert for chocoholics.

About freezing cakes- they keep well when wrapped tightly in plastic wrap. Frozen or partially-frozen cakes are also much easier to frost!

The cretin from NJ has no business giving a bad review to a recipe that wasn't followed. "Oh, gee, we left out the cream" "Oh, the ones we baked without the INSTRUCTED water bath collapsed". How about this? Oh, I used water instead of cream and didn't bake them and the stupid things didn't rise. Well, DUH!!!!

To the cook from Colorado.....our professional-baker-friend says that they always freeze their wedding cakes and then take them out of the freezer to decorate them as needed. He says that the cake crumb is improved and they don't have to bake at the last minute.

I have a question. Can you make the cakes ahead and keep them frozen until ready to serve? Please let me know, I would like to make them for Thanksgiving, but am going out of town and need to make in advance.

My high school students thought it was good, but too much chocolate (although by mistake they did not use enough heavy cream for the cake.) Some of the recipe was made using the water bath and produced an attractive product, but the cupcakes made without the water bath collapsed and looked unappetizing when they were left to cool.
