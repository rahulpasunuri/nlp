I didn't make the ice cream because I've always felt saffron was a little overrated. The crust was nice and flaky but I did add extra cream because the dough wouldn't hold together without it. The chocolate pastry cream was devine. I did make it the night before but I also used some Lindt dark chocolate with Ghiradelli semisweet chips because I was doubling the recipe and didn't have enough of either. My husband was not as delighted with it as I or my sons.

I gave this recipe two forks because while I found it to be very bland (like the other reviewers I skipped the saffron), I do think that there is quite a bit of potential here - it looks too good to give up on so easily. I made it last weekend for dinner and will be making it again this weekend with some changes. I will try to make the cookie sweeter and will substitue toasted pecans for blanched almonds. Like another reviewer, I found the cookie to be too dry - I will try to rectify that too with more cream and a whole egg. For the pastry cream, last time I made it the same day it was served. This time I will make it one day ahead and will use a better quality chocolate, add in some orange rind, more cream and halving the vanilla (it was too strong for my tastes). Also, I will use homemade ice cream. I really hope that it will come out better this time as I am making it for my mother in law.

This recipe is only as good as the chocolate you use. I served it to real chocolate fanatics and they loved it. It's simple to make and I think making the custard a day ahead enhances the flavor. Easy and great for company as it can be made ahead and assembled just before serving. I know few saffron fans so served it with whipped cream and orange zest

I made this recipe yesterday, and did not find it a hard recipe to make..I made the pastry and the chocolate filling the same day. I did find the pastry when cooked a little crumbly and a little drier than I like. The chocolate filling I used 1 cup of half and half and 1/3 cup of skim milk, I feel that added to the richness of the chocolate. I also used a very high quality chocolate. Next time I will use my own pastry and to the chocolate pudding I will add some orange rind and maybe some orange liquer or coffee liquer..

This is an ammendment to my earlier review. While this dessert did not draw any raves during dinner, my husband later asked me where I bought the tarts because he liked them. So, I guess these taste like they came from a bakery---- which depending on the bakery might be an OK thing.....

This was just so so and it took quite a bit of time to make, even though I skipped the saffron ice cream. The chocolate filling did not have any wow factor and the crust was kind of icky. And while I guess the saffron was supposed to make this dish "spanish" it didn't remind me of anything I ever had living in Spain. (I guess I knew that from the picture also, as it didn't look like anything you'd get in Spain)

I thought this recipe was just OK. The chocolate flavour seemed to develop overnight but I still don't think it is worth making. There are more chocolately tasting desserts out there that are more worth the effort. The indivdual presentation looked good but then the "wow factor" for taste just wasn't there.

The desser was wonderful and easy to make. I didn't go for the saffron ice cream, but vanilla ice cream is necessary as it helps cut the sweetness of the chocolate custard.

It tastes like gloppy chocolate pudding in a non-descript crust - not sure what went wrong!
