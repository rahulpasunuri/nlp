Wow ... great recipe for using basil and flexible. To reduce calories, I used 1 T oil w/1 tsp water, 1/4 c parmesan and 1/4 c pecans w/the 2 cups basil and 2 lg garlic cloves and salt to taste.

I just made this at the last minute so I didn't have time to toast the pecans and 'let cool'. I just threw all the ingredients in the processor and it was delicious. Yes, it is garlicky, but I like that, no it wasn't too salty, and yes it is slightly oily, but it depends on what you want to use it for - a spread, or a dip, or tossed with pasta - you can adjust the amount of oil by 1 -2 Tbs. either way in order to accomodate the use of the pesto. I will definately make this agian because I have tons of pecans and lots of basil inthe summer.

I have made this several times, and it's great! I usually use it on pizza. I have done it with green and purple basil. I prefer to roast the garlic for a while before, because I don't like the taste of raw garlic, but that's just my preference. Also, I usually chop the pecans into quarters before putting it into a food processor. This time I made the recipe with pecorino romano, and it was super yummy!

I substituted cilantro and some flat leaf parsley for the basil and added more garlic, yummy. Made a great sauce for pizza, but might cut back on the oil a bit next time

Yummy and different. Proportions are perfect. I serve with grilled chicken thighs.

I've made this four times now: book club, office holiday party, and holiday potluck. Served on toasted pieces of the thin bread you use for wraps. I add extra garlic to everything, so this had a nice kick. Guests love.

If I could I'd give this a two and a half. It was pretty good, but I felt the recipe could use some tweaking. I found it a little too oily and salty. I also think it needs more garlic. I don't think it's necessary to mash the garlic to a paste or to mix it with the salt. I made it successfully in my blender, but I had to take some extra steps to make it work. I ground the pecans in my coffee grinder and chopped the basil. It came out pretty smooth after quite a while of blending and scraping down the sides.

Simple and delicious. Added some crumbled bacon and a little fresh parmesan to make it even more decadent for a weekday meal.

I also made this without cheese, using all other ingredients as in the recipe. Delicious if a bit oily. I'll try it with less olive oil next time--& there will definitely be a next time!

This recipe for pesto was yummy. I am lactose intolerant, so I left out the cheese and added a little more oil. I spred it on toast, and my and husband and I loved it. I will definitely be making it again, maybe to use over pasta!

This is so easy and delicious. When you grow your own basil, you save a ton making it this way. I make a second batch and freeze it in an ice cube tray. Then, pop out the cubes and put in a sealable freezer bag...et voila! Great pesto anytime. This keeps in the freezer for many months.

Yummmm! I blanced the basil, and it turned out pretty. It froze well also, although I am not sure it will stay in the freeze too long. Next time I will have to double the batch.

this pesto sauce was a great summertime treat. I used fresh organic basil from the farmer's market, and I've used it once with toasted pecans, and once with the usual toasted pine nuts, but the proportions of the ingrediants are perfect, and the results are delightful. :)

I used this super pesto with Gourmet's "Eggplant Stacks" recipe. Read that review.

This was a nice twist to pine nuts. It was very easy to prepare. I had a hand-held Braun processor-mixer and I did fine. Next time I'll buy a regular food processor to save time! However, my guests and I loved the flavor and would definately do it again!
