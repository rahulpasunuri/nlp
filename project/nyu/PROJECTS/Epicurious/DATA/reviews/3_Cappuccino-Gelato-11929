Your recipe is more Cafe Latte gelato than Cappuccino gelato. Where is the chocolate or the cinnamon?

Instead of using instant espresso powder( a crime in my book), I used about 1/3 cup of ground decaf espresso beans from my shop and brewed it with a bit more than 1/2 cup of the hot milk in a french press with outstanding results. Next time I'll bump up the coffee and milk to brew a full cup for an even more intense gelato. This recipe is a great alternative to the high-fat recipes out there.

This is very easy recipe with great flavor. I used low fat milk and a Simac gelato machine. Excellent served with Oreo cookies!

I should have realized when this recipe did not contain any cream or eggs, it was not going to produce an authentic gelato. Terrible, puddingish consistency. Yuck! The chocolate gelato recipe on this site is what gelato should taste like.

I'd like to say I love it, and my sisters and brother love it just as much as I do. We had it as a desert after dinner last night, and even my parents loved it! One problem - we don't have an icecream maker, so instead we waited for it to cool, and using and icecream scoop, put it into dishes and then put it into the freezer for 15 minutes. It was just as good and tasted fantastic.

This recipe alone makes owning an ice cream maker worthwhile. My son thinks I'm a hero. He's allergic to corn products, so I make this with potato starch - once or twice a week.
