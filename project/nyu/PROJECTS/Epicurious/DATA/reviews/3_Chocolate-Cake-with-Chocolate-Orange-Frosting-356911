I have baked this cake multiple times in the past couple of years. Firstly, it's an inexpensive chocolate cake and for those of you who don't want an overload of butter, eggs and the like, I think this is a good and easy cake. I've used it with adapted cream cheese/yogurt and powdered sugar glazes. I, however, am not the 'typical American" ;) and prefer something economical to extravagant. Muy bien!

I made this cake because I wanted to know whether a vegan cake could even resemble a "real" cake. I was also interested because it uses canola oil instead of butter and seemed more heart healthy. I made just the cake the first time and it was great. The next time I made it with the frosting and regretted it. The frosting overpowers the cake and to say it "firms up quickly" is a gross understatement. It turned to cement almost instantly and was very difficult to spread. So make the cake and sprinkle it with confectioners sugar and serve it with sliced strawberries. Run, do not walk, away from the frosting!

I made this cake for my vegan coworker and I was surprised how "normal" and delicious it tasted. I actually made cupcakes (baked them about 16 mins) and they were very moist and quite good. The frosting was good too...we'll see tomorrow if anyone can tell if they're vegan or not! Was quite time consuming though.

I made this for a dinner party and people liked it. The recipe is intense. I thought the orange was a waste of time- it did not taste and no one commented on it.

I was not impressed with the flavor of this cake. It was all around too chocolatey - and I love chocolate. I added a bit more orange juice concentrate to the frosting, to try to cut the ovely chocolate flavor, but it didn't help very much. My boyfriend and I ended up sharing a piece, one time and threw the rest away. Total waste :(

I found the frosting to be almost grossly sweet, and I even cut out some of the sugar and the agave nectar. I probably should have cut down, significantly, on the orange juice concentrate in the frosting as well. It ended up tasting like a chocolate orange creamsicle, while I was hoping for something a little more bitter. I was careful not to cook the cake for the full 35 minutes, and I'm glad. I think it would have been very dry if overcooked at all.

A delicious and versatile recipe. Also makes wonderful cupcakes individual cakes in small tart dishes.
