These were brilliant. I also drizzled some honey on the sliced biscotti as they were cooling. It added a wonderful extra bit of sweetness.

Originally set out to make the ginger almond biscotti but couldn't find crystallized ginger so I made these instead. Left out the lemon peel and used an entire package of almonds [1 1/4 cup]. Also added about 1/2 cup tart, dried cherries. Did not read the reviews prior or I would have known that the mixture would spread. I watched almost all 15 minutes of baking time with anxiety to make sure the dough wouldn't slide off the cookie sheet onto the bottom of the oven. Cooking time was short by about 7 minutes. Baked on parchment, did not top with sugar because I did not want the extra sweetness, cooled completely then cut straight across. All in all they turned out great. Very tasty - a bit on the chewy side which I like, not rock hard like a lot of biscotti. Will make them again.

The finished product tasted great. The dough is too thin but adding flour and refrigerating as other reviewers suggested works well. Instead of two logs I did three and it baked well at 15 minutes. two logs need more baking time. Very easy and delicious though!

Used an additional 1/2 cup flour, substituted toasted walnuts for almonds, and added 1/2 cup dried cranberries; needed to bake longer. Easy & great with Vin Santo.

OK I have to weigh in here.... the dough is very loose and I thought I was doing something wrong, but after reading the reviews I see it's not me. That said, these taste excellent and I prefer chewy biscotti to the rock hard ones you usually get. To make this easier.... bake them a little longer (and perhaps on separate sheets) using either parchment or a silpat. It's important that you let them cool on the sheet so they continue to cook/firm up. Last, I use an electric knife to cut them so I don't smash them. I have used pine nuts and other chopped/sliced nuts to make it easier to slice also. These taste very good and are more dense/chewy than most biscotti, but very good.

dough is supposed to be wet - flour your hands to shape the sticky mess into logs on pan. i added 12 drops of lavender essential oil to sugar and subbed hazelnuts for the almonds. nice.

I'm about to make this recipe as a special request from a friend whose family is staying with her from New Orleans. I make 5 or 6 biscotti recipes and this is the one she wants. I use an extra 1/2 cup of flour, and refrigerate the batter for 30 minutes before baking on a silpat. The batter spreads more than other biscotti recipes, so I just cut it straight rather than on the diagonal. We love it!

I wish I had read the reviews before making it. Am curious to know if anyone has had success in adding more flour to firm up the initial dough. I've made them twice adding more flour the 2nd time and there was no difference in the results. I really like the flavor and got great reviews from friends who devoured the first batch - would like to figure out how to tighten the dough.

An easy to use recipe that produces superb biscotti. Use your hands to mix once the dough gets thick and you add the almonds. Use a breadknife to cut the loaves into slices. The breadknife cuts the almonds easily where an ordinary knife tends to push them through the loaf. These biscotti are crispy on the crust and softer inside. The family loves them!

I added some dried apricots, chopped. Delicious.

I found this recipe very easy. I made several batches for neighbors as Christmas gifts (with a bottle of Essensia) and they ALL wanted the recipe. I added raisons, dried pineapple, and dried cherry chunks to the mix. My family loves them. This will be a standard recipe made in my house.

I decided to try these in spite of the reviews. The reviewers were right- first, there does not seem to be enough flour in the dough, it was runny and would not hold it's shape so I added more. Second, after baking for 15 minutes, they were not cooked enough and were kind of gummy inside. I tried to make up by baking them longer the second time around, but they still did not get as crisp as they should have been. Not worth the time or ingredients.

I have cooking with recipes from Bon Appetit for 10 years with great success and this is the only recipe I have ever made that didn't turn out. Keeping the almonds whole made cutting them into slices totally impossible. Both of my mounds turned into a huge crumb mess. I had to throw the whole thing away. It doesn't sound like other people had this problem but trust me, these aren't worth the effort.

I started making them and I did not realized that the dough were so fluid... still I could bake them the first time and cut them for the 2nd baking. I forgot them in the oven so they became a bit over-baked and extremely crunchy... they were simply addictive. The only bad thing is that I could not stop eating them until the very end!

Very tasty, easy to make.

I made these cookies for a party and served them with Vin Santo for dipping. They were a hit with or without the dipping wine. I will definately make them again - like most Italian cookies they are not too sweet and they have good flavor.

I love these biscotti! I've made over 3 dozen batches since last fall, and I'm always asked to bring them to parties. I think the texture mirrors Cantucci in Italy - not as crisp as other Biscotti.

This recipe was okay. If I had read the reviews before I started it I wouldn't have started it. I read the other reviews in the middle of making this so I changed the lemon to orange and doubled the amount. The flavor was okay but the textured was nothing like a biscotti. For some REALLY excellant (& easy) biscotti - try the "Double Chocolate Walnut" recipe on this site. They are FABULOUS!

I read the other 2 reviews and was surprised. I thought the biscotti was pretty good. Mine was lemony and I enjoyed the texture of the toasted almond. I do agree the honey flavor is subordinate to the sugar sweetness. I wasn't sure I baked it enough the second time it goes in the oven....I figured the next time I'll leave it in more than 8 minutes to make the slices a bit crunchier.

Not the greatest. I too tried the Orange Almond biscotti in this same issue-- it was fabulous! As good or better than most upscale coffee houses. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for this recipe. It completely lacked any lemon flavor despite the tablespoon of rind. Ditto for the honey-- I could have easily subsituted plain old sugar, and the taste would have been identical. It's frustrating not to be able to give the better biscotti the good rating it deserves simply because it's not being included in the database. Making it has become a Sunday night tradition for myself, my mother and sister. I've passed along the recipe to at least 8 or 9 people who've tried it with great success. As for the Honey and Almond Biscotti, I won't waste my time or ingredients again.

Not nearly as good as the Orange-Almond Biscotti found in this same issue-- which I can't find anywhere on this site! Did someone forget to include that recipe?
