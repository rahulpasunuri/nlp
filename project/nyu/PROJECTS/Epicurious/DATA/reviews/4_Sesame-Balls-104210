When I go to a Chinese buffet, I always look for the Sesame Balls. I was very happy to find this recipe here. I decided to make half the recipe and substituted 3 oz. of brown sugar for the slab brown candy called for in the recipe. I dissolved it in what I thought was 1/2 cup of water, but it turned about to be 2/3 and when I cooled it and mixed it with the sweet rice flour (Mochiko - easily found in a small white box in Asian markets) it was too dry and I couldn't make the dough smooth. I had trouble making the pockets for the bean paste because the dough kept separating. Next time I will use more liquid. I also had trouble adhering the sesame seed to the balls because the dough wasn't moist enough, so I put a few drops of water on the outside and spread it over the outside. Then the seed adhered. I used a Fry Daddy to fry them and obviously the heat was too high because they cooked too fast. Perhaps next time I will fry them in a pan on the stove and use a thermometer. Despite my problems they were absolutely delicious and tasted exactly like what I find at good Chinese buffets. I will definitely make these again. Half the recipe makes 12.

I have tried this reciepe and the amount of rice flour to candy water is NOT right. It says 3 cups to 1 cup of fluid it's more like 1 cup of rice flour to 3/4 cup of candy water. I hope you don't find out the hard way too that reciepe is not accurate.

If you haven't found it yet, this is brown sugar candy. It comes in one-pound packages made up of 1" by about 5" slabs. The package costs about $1 here. You can get it in any oriental grocery or herb/health food store.
