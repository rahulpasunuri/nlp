I prepared this recipe twice - each time it was a disaster. I followed the recipe to the letter, but it did not turn our right. The chocolate mixture would not blend with the egg whites. The consistency of the pie was runny, even after letting the thing sit in the refrigerator for most of the day. Don't expect much from this recipe and you won't be disappointed.

awesome tart, made it for a july 4th dinner party and it blew the guests away. I topped with slivered almonds as well as chocolate shards and cherries. otherwise, made as described and it rocked. will definitely make this again and again.

One of my favorite summer treats, I made it last summer and already once this summer. I use Oreos instead of chocolate wafer cookies, they're a little heavier but I like the taste. I use Michigan cherries and they are perfect. Overall a great summer treat that isn't too hard to whip up. Although, I did notice that it took me more like two hours of active time.

Oh My Gosh!!!! This is wonderful!!! I didn't change a thing and it was a show stopping fabulous dessert!!! I would certainly make it again, next cherry season or when the cherries arrive this winter from South America. Not difficult and just as beautiful as the picture.
