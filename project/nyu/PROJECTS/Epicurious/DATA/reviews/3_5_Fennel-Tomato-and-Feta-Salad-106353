I did not care for this recipe at all though i loved the idea of it. I too only used one fennel bulb which seemed plenty. This was not a pretty looking salad. I would not make this again.

Good, bright, nice w/rich foods. Only used one bulb of fennel and did the rest as described. Plenty for four.

I made this recipe when it was first published. Instant addiction!I have made it many dozen times since. I often enjoy it as an entire light meal with just good bread or crackers. According to mood I have used more lemon, capers, or feta cheese and almost always use much less oil (although good olive oil certainly enhances taste). I don't have a mandoline but enjoy the crunch of very thinly sliced fennel. A winner in my book!

I made it with a lemon, garlic, and olive oil dressing and it was terrific. I didnt think the fennel was overpowering, probably because I added cucumber to the salad as well. Quick, easy, and satisfying.

What a great salad! So tangy and refreshing. I'll definitely be making this again, perhaps tonight.

Very easy to make, yet so tasty. You have to love fennel, but it's not so overpowering.

Made this salad for Easter Brunch a few years ago and it was a huge hit. Even with friends who wrinkle their nose at fennel. Making it again this year. Nice contrast to richer foods on the menu.

I LOVE this dish. Very interesting taste, but not overwhelming, so even your guests who are not terribly adventurous will enjoy it. I'll make it again and again.

Excellent salad, I tripled recipe and had it on a buffet. Got numerous requests for the recipe.

SOOOOOOOO yummy. What a great combination of flavors. I loved the crunch from the fennel, and the brine from the capers, mixed with that licorice flavor from the fennel...so good. I used lime instead of lemon because that's what i had on hand. I think that I'll make this with Aztec chicken (this site) for a dinner party this weekend!

This was surprisingly good. My husband is not a big fan of fennel, and he absolutely loved it! It did not taste strongly of anise nor were the tomatoes I used especially ripe, but the lemon juice really brightened up the flavor. It's crunchy and just a great combination of flavors. And it's low fat! It would be good all year round.

Excellent recipe.I'm on a bathing suit diet and my husband wants lighter meals so I am looking for new salads. Combination of flavors was really outstanding. A keeper.

Very happy to tell you that this is delicious. I cut the recipe in half (1 fennel bulb and two tomatoes) for two and felt there was still enough for four people. You'll want to adjust the other ingredients to your taste. I liked more of everything. It was excellent with salmon. You just need a very sharp knife for the fennel and I like a little thicker slice than stated "paper-thin." Quarter your tomatoes length wise also and slice about 1/4" thick. A lovely slaw. Stays fresh overnight.
