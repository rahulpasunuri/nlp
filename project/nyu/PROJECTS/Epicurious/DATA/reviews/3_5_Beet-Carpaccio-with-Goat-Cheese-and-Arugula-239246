This recipe is more like a salad than an appetizer, none the less very good, but I agree with another reviewer way too many beets, defintely can be cut in half.

This recipe has ruined me for cooked beets! After having beets prepared this way, cooked beets just taste mushy and mild. I've now used these sliced beets with vinegar in many salads. There are endless variations and the sweet crunchy beets cannot be beat!

I love everything about this recipe, except the endive. I just left it out, and thought it was fantastic - made for a dinner party and everyone cleaned their plates. Would have given it a 4 if the endive were not in the original.

Rather blah really. And this makes WAY more sliced beets than 4 people can handle. Think about it- 3 beets sliced paper-thin? We had beets for days. One beet is plenty for the spare, elegant plating that this recipe requires.

Ok, this is my new favorite beet recipe. Next time I'll try a touch of Truffle Oil which often pairs well with certain cheeses.

I've made this recipe several times, and it's always been a hit. I've added onions and capers (like beef carpaccio) and that's worked well, too.

This was so delicious! Made for a group of girlfriends and none of us had ever made anything with raw beets before-we loved it!
