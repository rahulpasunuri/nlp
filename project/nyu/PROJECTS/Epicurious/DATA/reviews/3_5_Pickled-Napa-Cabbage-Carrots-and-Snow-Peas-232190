Love this simple recipe. The only hard part is to cut things to matchstick size so you must have a very good relationship with your knives!! Otherwise, it brings great flavor to any grilled foods and is very refreshing.

followed the directions exactly which is important for the pickling juice prep (except I prefer brown sugar), but instead of blanching I just steamed the carrots in a saucepan for 2 minutes and threw in the cabbage for one to get them a little softer and just poured the hot pickle juice which I reheated after it was done steeping. this is actually very similar to a popular swedish dish. I love love love it. I've made it twice.

I agree with reviewer who said no need to blanch but pour hot dressing over. I did blanch my snow peas as they were extremely crisp but didn't blanch other veg. Also julienned the carrots on a mandoline which I think helped. This was a delicious salad and people couldn't believe it had no oil at all.

Here's a tip: Instead of spending time blanching the vegetables and drying them, pour the hot brine directly over the prepared veggies, let it sit at room temp for 30 minutes, then chill. The hot liquid will soften the vegetables, and it's much less work.

I did not care for this recipe. When I read the ingredients and thought it would be more like Kemchee.

The end result was great, but it took forever! I went through a roll of paper towels trying to get everything dry enough. It also took an hour to cut up the snow peas. I used prepackaged cut carrots to save some time. Next time I think I'll just use the sauce over a bag of premixed cabbage/carrot slaw.
