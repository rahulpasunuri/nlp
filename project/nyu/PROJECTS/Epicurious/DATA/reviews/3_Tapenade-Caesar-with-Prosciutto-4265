Very delicious twist on caesar. Dressing is just tangy sharp which plays off the sweetness of the tapenade and prosciutto. Very mediterranean. If you like garlic, anchovies, olives...

I was reluctant to put in the fennel but I followed the recipe and cut down the olive oil to 1/2 cup. This is excellent and works very well with the tapenade. Have made it many times.

I feel a little wrong in rating this recipe because I haven't made it as written, in fact I haven't made the salad at all. But I have made the tapenade time and time again, always with multiple requests for the recipe. I change a few things - substitute dried cherries for the raisins (I just don't like them in anything), add a clove or so of garlic (to your taste) and up the cayenne depending upon the crowd I'm serving it to. A complete winner with oven crisped pita triangles and firm veggies like carrots, fennel, zuchinni. Try the tapenade at least - it's wonderful.

i make this caesar recipe all the time. easy and so good. definitely needs less oil. i serve with garlicky croutons that i make from crusty brick-oven bread. tapenade is optional but not necessary, or can stand alone as a dip with spicy, crunchy crackers. interesting sweet-salty flavor i really liked.

Delicious. The Tapenade was the topper.

The tapenade had an odd sweet/salty taste that my husband liked, but the rest of us hated. The dressing is too oily, although that can be fixed. Proscuitto appealed to my husband with the caesar and had the dressing been less oily than the proscuitto would have been a nice touch.

Raisins, fennel, and cayenne? In a CAESAR salad? Are you nuts? Bleeeccch.

I was looking for a "Seizure Salad" course for my Halloween dinner, and chose this one. The tapenade piped in dots around the rim of the plate makes this unique. I tripled it to serve 15. If I were to serve this again as part of a simpler menu, I would make breadsticks to serve with it as dippers for the tapenade.
