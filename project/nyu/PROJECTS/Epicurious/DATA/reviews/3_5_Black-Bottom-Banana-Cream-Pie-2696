Don't waste your time - I completely agree with the other reviewer - the bittersweet chocolate is just that - too bitter - especially for the amount that's in this pie. It should be made with milk chocolate or better - instead of a store bought pie crust disk (that Publix or Winn Dixie don't sell) make it with a home made graham cracker and oreo cookie crust. Also - there's way too much butter that gave the pie a greasy feel and didn't settle properly - it just left an oil layer on the top of the pie - I ended up using a paper towel to sop it up. I took one bite and was ready to spit it out. The custard would be better if it had mashed bananas in it - it was also very delicate to make as it can easily turn to scrambled eggs. A great friend that I made this for - is a chef who went to Johnson & Wales Culinary school - we both didn't like the pie over all - taste, texture and ingredients.

Overall - tasty. However, even though I love dark chocolate, I thought the chocolate in this recipe should have been milk chocolate because the dark was too bitter. Also - the recipe calls for too much butter in the ganache; it separates. Lastly, it took 2.5 tries to get the custard right. I wouldn't make it again - I was underwhelmed with the flavor for the effort it takes.

Delicious. Doubled the filling recipe, and used rum extract instead of dark rum (actually 1 tsp rum extract, 2 tsp water) and doubled the ganache recipe. I didn't think the chocolate overpowered the other components. This one is a keeper!

I made this for the first time last night. Used a store bought crust to save time (I started at 10pm). While it did use almost every bowl in my apartment I found it fairly quick and simple. I too was leery of the gelatin for the cream but it set up beautifully. I will definitely make this again but next time will double the cream perhaps only pass the extra ganache when serving instead of adding the top layer.

I took other's advice and doubled the filling recipe. Instead of adding 3 t. vanilla extract, I added 2 t. vanilla extract and 1 t. banana extract. I put the ganache on the bottom of the pie, but did not pour it into the center of the pie. Instead, I just drizzled it over the pie at service. I also used a store-bought pie crust to save time. This pie got RAVE reviews, and was very easy with the changes I made.

It got good reviews, but personally I thought the chocolate a little overwhelming. Also, the butter to the ganache unnecessary if you increase the chocolate by a square or two for added richnees

I am half way through the recipe and there is no way it can be worth all the work and dirty dishees. If I use the ganache idea again, it will NOT be with this custard.

Very much liked this pie. Because others said the chocolate was overpowering ,I did not pour the ganache on top, but drizzled instead. However, next time I will pour it over the top as the recipe calls. I don't think the choc. would be over powering. Consider adding more bananas and perhaps doubling the filling if you like a "thicker" pie.

I've been making this pie every Thanksgiving since the recipe was published in Bon Appetit in '91. The pie is amazing and I usually have to make 2 or 3 because nobody eats just one piece. The rum adds a great flavor to the filling and combines excellently with the bananas. I personally don't find the chocolate overwhelming, but you can always alter the amount you pour into the bottom crust as well as the top :)

As many below have written, the filling is delicious but it's overpowered by the chocolate. If I made this again I'd forget the ganache (or maybe drizzle some on top), double the filling, & have a wonderful banana cream pie.

I made this recipe for Easter and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly, using a high quality chocolate for the ganache (Callebaut semisweet). The pastry cream method seemed strange to me (I was leery of the gelatin), but it turned out great and creamy. I will definitely be making this one again.

I made this for very dear friends...they loved it. The chocolate layer was only SLIGHTLY overwhelming. Maybe next time I will double the custard. Very good!

Used regular short-crust pastry. Family stated, "This is a keeper". Always looking for new pie recipes and this one is different, easy to make and good.

This pie was delicious, but I would cut the ganache recipe in half an use it on the bottom only. The heavy bittersweet chocolate on the top of the filling takes away from its lightness. The buttermilk crust is wonderful and well worth the extra effort. I did need to add extra liquid to help the dough come together, however.

Way too rich for my taste. The pastry cream was delicious though.

An outstanding recipe. The pastry cream is different from others I've tried, but it turned out very nicely. Since it isn't mentioned in the recipe itself, I would suggest the use of a double-boiler for the preparation of the cream. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't notice that much of a problem cutting the crust. For those looking for additional banana flavor, add 1/2 tsp of banana extract to the pastry cream before chilling

This was a very time consuming recipe. However, it was very tasty. I used a ready made crust to save a little time. I'd only use this recipe for special occasions.

Hard for a novice with pastry to manage, but definitely a terrific flavor, though it does not keep well.

Wonderful dessert. I am not a very experienced baker, but the recipe is a lot easier than it looks, and it was definately worth it!

Very tasty! It has been a big hit with my family since the first time I made it. It takes some time but it is worth it.
