Totally agree that it was more butterscotchy than caramely. Also completely agree with the comments that 242F was insufficient to get the right firm/chewy consistency. My caramels were gooey and flattened into delicious "splats" after cutting (I didn't wrap them); they also stuck like heck to everything! Finally, for my personal taste, hazelnut = chocolate; caramel = almond. Tasty enough, but I won't repeat this recipe.

Delicious. It has more of a butterscotchy flavor than a true caramel flavor, as you might guess from the ingredients list, but it goes beautifully with the hazelnuts. I cooked it to 245 F after a cold water check at 242 suggested it wasn't done enough, and that worked fine for me.

I made these with pecans as that is what I had and they are very tasty! My only complaints is they are a little hard to chew! (I have to be careful who I give them to for the holidays!) But the flavor is wonderful! I will make them again

I have made these every year since the recipe came out in the magazine, they are always a huge hit. My copy got so tattered I had to come here to print out a fresh copy!

I have made these, and another plain caramel recipe to great success. I cook them to just under 250, while stirring constantly. It is a labor of love, but worth the effort. They are firm and easy to cut.

I made these for my husband for his birthday and he claims they are on par with any gourmet store bought caramel he has had. It took about 1.5 hours to get to the correct temperature but they were well worth the time. After reading comments here I brought it to 248 and the consistency was perfect. The texture is wonderfully buttery and the vanilla bean adds an excellent highlight to the flavor. I didn't bother cutting with a knife, I used a scraper/dough cutter/crumber (whatever you call it!) and it worked perfectly. A simple way to cut a bunch at a time.

This was a lot of work to create a gooey mess. Flavor is wonderful, and even though I cooked to 245, I could not cut until I froze them. I left them in the freezer all night and today and am hoping that they harden up enough with some time that I can give them to people. Plan to leave them out tonight and see what happens... If you make these cook to more than 245.

These were easy and delicious, my first candy making attempt besides microwave peanut brittle. They cut easily without buttering the heavy knife. I will definitely cook them to a higher temperature next time. I also want to try another reviewer's suggestion of adding chocolate. I didn't toast the hazelnuts and it was fine.

Yup, it's a keeper. I have 4 filbert/hazelnut trees and was looking for something to do with them and whalaa!! I found a great recipe. Tastes great and extremely easy. I did take them up just a couple of degrees higher based on previous reviews and you have to keep the knife clean. Warning, towards the end of wrapping each piece you find you are cutting them bigger.

These are wonderful! I have been making them each Christmas for the past 6 years. I get requests for them. The recipe is easy and reliable. My only question is: has anyone found a pretty way to wrap them that isn't a huge hassle? Waxed paper seems to be the easiest on both me and the recipient, but looks so utilitarian...

This was my first attempt at making any sort of dessert at all and it turned out wonderfully. I skipped the nuts and just made plain vanilla caramels, also heated the mixture to 252F since I wanted them to be on the hard side. I'm very pleased with the texture from this temperature, plus my jaws got tired before I ate too many ;) This recipe is excellent, on par with the best caramels I've bought. One note: I had to put the gas on about 3/4 power to get the temp up without it taking forever, medium was too low on my stove.

Well, I made this recipe again this year with a new digital candy thermometer. Last year I wrote to say my caramels were too hard. This year mine came out too soft! I speculate that they should be cooked to a slightly higher temperature, since everybody else's seemed to have come out soft as well. But still delicious...

They're addictive! I made a batch to include in my holiday gift baskets, and they were a big hit. Afterwards I became addicted to the leftovers. Mine came out too soft (like others here reported). Refrigerating helped, though it was difficult to unwrap them -- they seem to be best at a temperature just slightly cooler than room temperature. Still delicious, though. Would definitely make again!

I had the opposite problem. Mine were too soft. I made a double batch, which I wouldn't recommend to anyone... It was simply too much caramel to handle at once and I had trouble getting the temperature just right. However, they do taste great and I'm still giving them as gifts, but with a warning about how soft they are!

YUMMY!! It's not instant gratification but if you have a few hours in the afternoon...spend them making this recipe!!! Also, is there an easier way to cut them into squares? I had an awful time keeping my knife from gumming up. Would definitely make these again and again and again.....

Excellent caramels. I was inspired to make this based on a recent visit to Sees Candies and thought I would try and make my own caramels. These turned out better than I expected...on my first try! Recommend chilling before cutting for easier handling and wrapping

This is one of our favorites! I have been giving them with holiday gifts and everyone loves them. For chocolate caramels just add one ounce of unsweetened chocolate with the sugars. This has always been a never fail recipe, quick and easy to make, just be prepared to wrap.

When my angry stepdaughter say me wrapping bits of candy in colorful cellophane, she melted and began setting up "stations" so that she could help too. No wonder her mother doesn't like her to visit...we have too much fun baking fun things, like this recipe! Really,one person can't do all of the work that is required by this recipe. We ran out of cellophane, and had to use plastic wrap. And of course you can use pecans instead of hazelnuts.

These are wonderful. You will need to chill them before cutting. Nice consistency and nuts give nice texture. Would also suggest this caramel base for the Butter Rum Carmels recipe. Just sub the rum extract for the hazelnuts.
