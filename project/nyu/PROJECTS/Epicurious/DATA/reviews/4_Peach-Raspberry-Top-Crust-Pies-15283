I was disappointed in this recipe for several reasons. The flavor was OK--not bad, but not great, either. Given the effort I put into these pies (there is a lot of detailed instruction that I think isn't necessarily required), this wasn't worth repeating. I made the frozen butter dough. It came out beautifully, but it was really a drag to make. I might make it again, but only for something really special. The filling of pies was OK, but nothing all that great. Interestingly, this made three pies for me--I was so concerned about the quantity of liquid in the pie plate per those detailed instructions that I didn't want to overfill. That made room for three whole pies. While I didn't have enough crust for the third pie, I was able to array it decoratively enough that it looked like it was supposed to have an open top!

Great pie. Don't expect it to look pretty, but it will tase great! I added blueberries, since I hadn't bought enough peaches, and used store bought crusts. YUM!

What a great way to enjoy summer fruit - I made this for some vegan friends and substituted reduced soy milk for the eggs (or you can omit the pastry cut-outs altogether). Can easily substitue blackberries or blueberries for the raspberries as well.

I think it is a wonderful, flavorful pie. I will make it again!
