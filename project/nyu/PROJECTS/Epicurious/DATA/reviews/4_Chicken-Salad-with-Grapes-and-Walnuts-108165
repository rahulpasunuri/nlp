My go-to Chicken Salad recipe. It's perfect as is. Don't miss out on adding fresh tarragon- it's key.

Rating: 4
Just made this the first time for a luncheon and it was a BIG hit! I also tweaked a bit - fewer shallots, cider vinegar, a bit of regular yogurt (didn't have Greek), dried tarragon (a bit less than the recipe called for). Everyone was raving about it! I also marinated the chicken for about an hour before cooking with 4 Seasons Italian dressing and I didn't overcook the chicken. A WINNER.

Great! This is now our go-to hot-summer-night dinner! Prepping the ingredients is a bit tedious but actually making it is a snap.

I make this all the time. I had left overs after graduation and decided to freeze it. The only thing that didn't work was the grapes, they got very mushy, but otherwise it was terrific. I just added a little fresh tarragon and some vinegar to brighten it up...

This is a good chicken salad, but I highly recommend adding some blue cheese! It makes a big difference in flavor!

Just made this last night. Turned out great. I read all the reviews and used many suggestions. I used half greek yogurt and half mayo. I used minimal shallots. I used lemon juice and I used cider vinegar because I didn't have tarragon vinegar. I chopped up the chicken first and then added in the celery, grapes and walnuts to my liking. Then I chopped the tarragon and added it to my liking to a bowl of the "dressing" -- I first mixed the yogurt and mayo, added the vinegar, shallots and lemon, salt and lots of pepper. And then the tarragon. Then I poured this over the chicken to taste...as I was trying to double the recipe. I reserved the extra "dressing" since I was chilling the salad over night and wanted to see how moist it would turn out. I'm serving this at a potluck. I'll serve it in a bowl with a spoon and a basket of pita bread next to it for a self-serve situation to keep the bread from getting soggy. I'm VERY happy with this recipe

I love tarragon and grow it in my herb garden. I made the recipe exactly as directed, tasted it, and then thought I can't serve this to my luncheon group. It was both bland and over powering with tarragon. I then doubled the walnuts and grapes and added some yogurt so as to not to have it have too much mayonnaise. Acceptable-but no rave reviews.

Used rosemary from the back yard instead of tarragon - AMAZING!

I make this salad all the time for a healthy lunch. I call it everthing but the kitchen sink chicken salad, because I throw in whatever vegies I have in the crisper. I,ve also made this same salad, eliminating the fruit and adding instead whole grain noodles(cooked of course)and a little dill. YUM-E!

Rating: 4
I changed some things around but....AMAZING! I used another cooks idea: instead of shallots I used a 1/2 cup of red onion marinated in honey, red-wine vinegar, and a small amount of olive oil allowing it to sit while I finished cutting other ingredients AND used this vinegar in the recipe instead of the tarragon vinegar. I also used ONE Granny Smith Apple (grapes ARE TOO SWEET for my taste). And had to add Celery because what is Chicken Salad with out Celery??? AND wow. The sweet yet salty combination was amazing and the red onions gave a spice of its own the next day. My hubby was amazed AND I used my left over Roast Chicken I had for the night before for this lunch/dinner...

Rating: 4
Wonderful. So good. I loved all of the flavour combos. I followed this recipe with the exception of adding celery seed (as we didn't have any fresh celery on hand) and I added an avocado (finely chopped). It added a nice creaminess and blends beautifully with the other ingredients. The shallots are delicious in this. I served this on thin, fresh rolls with Dijon. I will be making this again.

I have made this recipe multiple times now. I cut the shallot amount as I find it can overpower and use white wine vinegar if tarragon vinegar isn't available.

BEST chicken salad I've ever had!! I'm very picky about chicken salad. The best way to cook chicken...lay chicken breasts in pan. Pour heavy cream and milk, or just milk half way up the breasts. Bake at 350 for 40 minutes. Chicken was so creamy. I didn't have tarragon vinegar. So I took 1 tbsp each of white vinegar, cider vinegar & balsamic vinegar, and put tarragon in it and let it sit for a few.

Undoubtedly the best chicken salad I have ever tasted!! I made slight alterations due to not having all the ingredients on hand: substituted onion for the shallot, cider vinegar for tarragon vinegar, and used half greek yogurt & half mayonnaise to make up 3/4 cups. Outstanding!!!!!

I used homemade mayo for this recipe and since that included mayo and champagne wine vinegar, I nixed the acids from the recipe. I also skipped the shallots and the only used a tiny bit of tarragon.

I made this exactly as written the first time for my daughter's preschool graduation (except I substituted toasted pecans for the walnuts and tripled the quantity of everything) and it was delicious, although I felt that, with a few tweaks, it could be even better. So it was that, the second time around, instead of shallots, which were overpowering even though very finely chopped, I used the same amount of red onions marinated in honey, vinegar, and a small amount of olive oil. Do this step before you begin all other chopping and mixing and that will be sufficient marinating time. Rather than 2 cups of red grapes, which were too numerous and too sweet, I used one cup of cored but unpeeled, thinly sliced and chopped, Granny Smith apple. These two changes improved the taste tremendously! Other changes that did not make much difference either way: used leftover roast turkey, which is as good as chicken but perhaps soaks up more moisture. Did not have celery on hand and did not miss it. Used dried tarragon instead of fresh--fresh is better but dried is fine. Increased the black pepper and ground it myself. Toasted walnuts or toasted pecans-- either way tasty. It was more moist the first day, and the various flavors stood out independently. By the third day, the walnuts are still crunchy and the apples are less distinctive but it is still delicious!! The best chicken salad I've ever made.

WOW! Absolutely delicious!! I did not have tarragon vinegar so I used white wine vinegar which worked great. I also used one of the previous recommendations and boiled my chicken in chicken broth with a bay leaf and about a tsp of lemon juice and that worked out great! Lastly I added some yellow raisins to the salad that I got from whole foods. This salad is just marvelous! I will definitely use this for years to come.

I poach boneless skinless chicken breasts in a chicken broth, a big bay leaf, and a whole lemon cut thinly on diagonal. I bring the pot to a boil, then, I let it sit covered for about 45 minutes. Remove the chicken adn cube it into the 1/2 inch cubes. DE-lish! And, it adds a wonderful essence to the salad. Also, I toast my walnuts before adding them. Taragon is one of my favorites, but have found that a combination or other favorite herbs work really well too. I have added some finely chopped sun dried tomatoes, some small cubes of fresh mozzerella, and used fresh basil.. yum! I substituted toasted pine nuts for the walnuts and left the recipe the same after that. Love this versatile recipe!!!!

I offered to do the cooking for my sister for my niece's HS graduation brunch, since she is a teacher and had a lot of year end stuff going on (she gladly took me up on it!). I did some research on recipes for chicken salad and decided on this one. It is by far, the BEST chicken salad I have ever eaten. It also got RAVE reviews from everyone who ate it. I used a combination of both fresh tarragon as well as dried and unable to find tarragon vinegar, so used white wine vinegar. When my niece sent me her thank you card and thanked me for doing the food, she said she especially loved the chicken salad! A definite keeper.

This is a great chicken salad for 'ladies who lunch.' I generally don't like or use tarragon, but it makes this recipe. That said, I did the dried tarragon & white wine vinegar substitution because that is what I had on hand. It was very good that way. I used rotisserie chicken from the supermarket; will definitely make again. Do use the red grapes, not green. You can reduce the mayo; as with all mayo-based salads, waldorf, etc, it just depends on your personal taste.

My 4 fork rating is for the recipe as written. Just a heads up for all of you folks who give it 4 forks and then proceed to tell us how you modified it - that makes no sense! Giving the original recipe a perfect rating implies it needs no modification. If you're telling us that *your* modified recipe was rated 4 forks, then you clearly are not understanding the rating process. If you can follow a recipe, you should be able to figure this out.

I thought this recipe was very good, and so did the company. I used rotisserie chicken, pecans and white wine vinegar. The real shocker was that my husband liked it. Two days later, I still can't get over it. He only eats things like fried chicken and mashed taters!

This was a nice recipe, although I admit I did make some changes. I omitted the grapes, substituted pecans for the walnuts, and chopped everything finely. I used only 1/2 cup of mayonnaise, then I stuffed the salad into some beautiful large cherry tomatoes. Instead of chopping tarragon into the salad, I put a small leaf as garnish on top of each tomato. I would definitely make this again.

Made this for a quick lunch out of leftover chicken. I was very hesitant to use the tarragon (I don't usually like it - or other licorice flavors) but decided to go for it.

My favorite deli has this salad. Ate it for decades. Made this(saving $$) & it's better. No tarragon vinegar, white wine & dried tarragon works. Poached chicken breasts w/dried tarragon. Used dried tarragon in salad. Subbed red onion for shallot. Packed for lunches w/greens & good crackers. The deli salad is a lot creamier & I prefer less mayo. Love it.

I made this salad for a pot luck dish for a book club meeting, and it was a great success. I used half mayonnaise, half yoghurt, and would recommend that if you do this then definitely add a good teaspoonful of dijon mustard for flavour. pecans worked well in place of walnuts. I made the dish a day in advance, to let the flavours develop, which worked well. It's great for easy transportation, too, as it's nice and thick, and so doesn't slop around.

I made this on a whim with left-over chicken breast and had to make some substitutions. I used a wine white vinegar, dried tarragon, and freshly shopped Italian parsley for extra color. I omitted the grapes, but served it with fresh spinach, dried cranberries, and some crusty bread. It was great!

I love to entertain so I made this for an all-girl party that I hosted for about 20 women and EVERYONE loved it. (I rolled it in tortilla wraps, cut them into diagonal halves and served them as single serving sandwiches on party platters) However, the true test came when my husband came home for lunch the next day (with a male employee) and ate the leftovers. Even they loved it! Usually men don't like the mixture of meat & fruit for sandwiches, but this is quite the exception. It is a staple at my parties now. I made it exactly like the original directions, but added a touch of dijon mustard (1 t.) and nutmeg (1/2 t.)as someone else had suggested- a perfect compliment. Wouldn't change it for anything!

Excellent. I did make a few changes. I used pheasant instead of chicken. I removed the tarragon and substituted white wine vinegar for the tarragon vinager.

I have used a similar recipe with great success. It is better to mix in the salt, pepper and red pepper into the mayo at least an hour before mixing with chicken, overnight if possible. To increase creaminess add a ounce or two of heavy cream. I use toasted almonds and serve in a hollowed out pineapple.

Part of a perfect evening: fabulous music by Dirty Martini, a great setting in an Oregon nursery next to a river and wonderful friends, old and new. Only change was to lighten it up: sub the mayo with 1/2 light mayo and 1/2 non-fat yoghurt. Oh - and I added some raw spinach. Everyone loved it, including the lead singer who scrounged a plate during a break. Served with a mostly mango fruit salad, crusty bread and wine. Everyone loved it, but it might have been the setting....

My first time making chicken salad and I'm glad this was the recipe that I chose! However, I agree [with another reviewer], you should premix the salt, pepper, 1.5 tbs chopped tarragon and vinegar to allow the flavors to marinate (Added 1.5 tbs. tarragon to chicken mix). I used about 4 stalks of celery to add volume. I increased the dressing to 5 tbs. vinegar & 1 c. Miracle whip (added separately). Then add wet ingredients only to the portion being eaten, to prolong the dish. Top with fresh grated parmesan cheese.

My daughter made this salad for a bridal shower, which was a hit. Since it was such a success at the shower, I made it for a bridal shower that I was hosting at my house (06/11/06).

I have made this recipe three or four times, and have always used the Costco canned chicken, which is excellent in this salad, as well as in soups that call for cooked chicken. I substituted about a cup of dried cranberries (craisins) for the grapes. and used white wine vinegar. I feel the fresh tarragon was enough of that flavor, but have found the recipe to turn out dry. When I read back at previous reviews, I think I will try fresh red grapes in the future, instead of the craisins. Perhaps those will lend some more creaminess that is desired on dry wheat bread or a pita. Maybe that or more mayonnaise, which I'd prefer to avoid.

This was quite delicious. My store was out of shallots so I had to sub red onion. Also, I used white wine vinegar and dried tarragon as this was all I had on hand.

We make this about twice a month for our weekend lunches. The tarragon really completes the salad, but we also add 1 to 2 Tbs of dill for added flavor. Mix the mayo, vinegar and herbs first to allow the flavors to meld together, then add the chicken, onion and celery and save the grapes and walnuts for last. You'll get a more even coating through the salad.

This is a great way to class-up an old summer favorite that can sometimes look "blah" out on the table... The red grapes add just the right bit of sweet and splash of color. I choose to mix all the ingredients with the mayo first (leave out the chicken and grapes/walnuts) for better flavor saturation, before folding in the chicken and grapes/walnuts. To top it off, try garnishing the dish with a few sprigs of Taragon, and it'll have much more table-appeal for your summer brunches and picnics!

I made this yesterday and it was an easy, well balanced recipe. I tweaked it just a bit. I'm always looking to cut calories so I used half light and half fat-free mayo and I used Apple Cider vinegar instead of Tarragon. Unless you just love Tarragon, I would not use more than the recipe calls for just because you have it. The Tarragon flavor really comes through after the ingredients blend. I actually used an extra cup of chicken and I just had it for lunch and it was perfect!

This was the chicken salad recipe of my dreams. Just perfect. All the things I love about chicken salad--mayo, tarragon and a bit of crunch. The grapes were delicious.

I made this with green, red and black seedless grapes (leftovers from a party). Used white wine vinegar and dried tarragon leaves (1/3 the amount) and found it had plenty of tarragon flavor. Also, I pounded chicken breasts, oiled and seasoned them and cooked in a grill pan on the stove (because it's February!). Came out great.

I made this recipe *as it was written* and it was delicious and a hit at our luncheon. Try it first without adding sour cream, apples, changing the nuts or marinating the chicken as other reviewers have suggested (then go on to say it's not their all time favorite recipe!).

Delicious! I have made this several times now and have modified it a bit. I oven roasted a whole chicken with fresh squeezed orange juice and used the breast meat for the salad, added 2 tablespoons of mayo and 1 of sour cream, 2 tablespoons of tarragon vineger. Other than that, I used all the other quantities listed on the recipe. This is a definte keeper! My 15 month old son absolutely loves it!

Not my all time favorite chicken salad but was not a dissapointment either. Used toasted nuts and marinated chicken so flavor was more intense. Also added apple,lite mayo, and sour cream as suggested and got plenty of comments from family and friends. Do let sit overnight for best flavor.

I am not normally a fan of chicken salad, but volunteered to make it for a luncheon. After reading other reviews, I made several changes. First, I roasted the chicken. I used a little more toasted walnut, celery, and shallot than called for, for both flavor and texture. Instead of grapes, I dumped in a bag of orange essence Craisins. Used the 1/2 light mayo, 1/2 light sour cream idea. The salad still didn't have enough character, so I added a finely diced apple, some parmisano-reggiano, and more tarragon vinegar. Served with mini croissants, and was quite pleased to have an interesting rendition of chicken salad.

Outstanding! My husband doesn't even like chicken salad, but has now declared this his favorite! He's requested it for the lake this weekend. The tarragon vinegar adds a different touch, and I love the walnuts in it. I use the breast meat from a rotesserie chicken. That makes about 3 servings. Go make this!

In original recipe the tarragon vinegar was too sharp and did not enhance the flavor. I substituted 3 T. fresh orange juice and 1 tsp. freshly grated orange peel and got rave reviews. I've served it to three large groups, so far.

This is a great and simple dish. I made it last week and will probably make it again tonight. The tarragon adds a nice element and the grapes really make it ideal for summer. I couldn't find tarragon vinegar and used wine vinegar instead. Didn't seem to hurt. Yummy.

This is such an easy, delicious summer recipe. I put only one tablespoon of fresh tarragon, otherwise I followed it exactly and served it on a bed of butter lettace with a sprinkling of alfalfa sprouts on top. I also shreaded the chicken (4 breasts) rather than cubed it. Wonderful recipe.

I made this for the umpteenth time last night, and it was EXCELLENT! Of course, I have tweaked this recipe to suit our own tastes. I use 3/4 cup low-fat mayo plus 1/3 cup low-fat sour cream, decrease the tarragon and tarragon vinegar slightly, and add a good dash of bottled hot sauce (Maggie) to the dressing mixture. I use three cups of chicken (more than enough), increase the celery to 1-3/4 cups, the red onion to 1/4 cup, the grapes to 2-1/2 cups. This time I added a small, chopped Winesap apple, and it blended in well. If the mixture seems too dry, add a little milk just before serving. GOOD EATING, esp. when it is 100 degees outside!! I serve this with garlic bread, and it is a substantial meal for 4. Since there are only 2 of us, the leftovers tonight will be even better!!! YUM, YUM.

I must have done something wrong. This was not good at all. I did pile it on romaine but did not toss it with the lettuce. One simply could not taste the dressing.

I thought this recipe was WONDERFUL!! I poached 5 skinless boneless chicken breasts in chicken broth. Let it cool in the broth and refrigerated it. The following day, I cubed the chicken and put into a bowl. In a food processor, I mixed 1/2 c. mayo, 1/2 shallot, handful of flat leaf parsley, 3 tbsp tarragon vinegar, 1 tsp. dijon mustard, salt and pepper and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Mix until creamy. Toss with the cubed chicken. The flavor was incredible!! I loved it. Just when I thought it couldnt get better, adding the walnuts and purple seedless grapes made it DELICIOUS!! I was hesitant to put grapes in the chicken salad, but the flavors complimented each other. My boyfriend said he would eat this everyday!! Definitely a keeper! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for 40 people for a luncheon, they begged for no croissants, but they would have been perfect. I got 3 catering jobs because of this very special chicken salad. But, it makes a lot, and needs a little mayo/sour cream the second day. Great with the fruit salad with honey lime dressing.

Didn't make this but saw it and needed to comment. My mom has made chicken and grapes for the last thirty years. She poaches bone-in chicken with bay leaves, salt and pepper (but I also use leftovers from roast chicken), cuts it in chunks, mixes with scallions, a little mayo (enough to moisten but not drown), fresh parsley, red seedless grapes, a little mustard, some lemon. If you want the BEST version and if you are game for it, add curry powder. Sounds wierd but it is out of this world! Serve in pita with romaine or green leaf lettuce. Awesome at the beach or any potluck. It makes me think this recipe is *too* dressed up, but I am biased. It is NEVER as good as when mama makes it.

This is the salad that comes to mind when I am in the mood for chicken salad. I think it is more or less the traditional southern chicken salad--- (please don't beat me up for saying that if you are a 10th generation southerner and use a different recipe.) Anyway, very tasty. One reviewer mentioned they added raisins, which I tried, with nice results, just for a slightly different taste.

Loved it! We were snowed in so I had to substitute raisins for grapes (a nice twist)! I also followed others suggestions and "thinned" the mayo with a little milk and didn't use quite as much as the recipe called for. All in all a big hit -- I will make this one over and over when the weather is warmer!

This salad started a feud in my neighborhood. I had invited neighbors for lunch and they enjoyed the food so much the copied my entire menu and served it EXACTLY to mutual friends. Whey I had them over, they commented that I was serving the same food my neighbor had served them the week before. My advice: share one recipe at a time - never the whole menu.

This is identical to a recipe from one of the Silver Palate books, except that one uses a sherry vinaigrette and a little Gorgonzola. I though the blue cheese was great with the fruit and nuts - really added some punch to it for those who thought it was bland or sweet.

This is a classic recipe which I have been making for over 20 years. Chicken and tarragon is a delicious traditional French combination and the vinegar in the dressing thins it down just enough. I,too,added about 1/3 sour cream to the mayonnaise. For more flavor, how about adding some salt and pepper or even lemon juice to pique it.

Taste was o.k. but it turned an unappealing purple color (from the grapes?) did anyone else have this problem? Also, too strong on the mayo, I would have cut it down and used some milk to keep it moist yet eliminate the heavy mayo base. Also way too much chicken, I added more nuts and grapes and even some apple to balance it out. Sorry but epicurious didn't score a home run with this one.

Really good. Makes a nice light lunch and can be served to company easily with a chilled soup, perhaps. For a variation, try substituting blanched brocolli for the grapes. Two tongues up!

This was a wonderully light and refreshing summer meal. I had made roast chicken with lemon and thyme, one of our favorite epicurious dishes, a couple of days ago, planning to use the leftover breast meat for this salad. so the chicken already had a delicious flavor. I followed the recipe to the letter except for the shallot, there were none available. We found it to be absolutely delicious the moisture and texture were fine. I would definitely make it again.

Ubiquitous deisre to ruin this salad by adding grapes? I didn't think so. I found the sweetness and texture of the grapes added a nice balance to the crunch and slight bitterness of the walnuts. The fresh tarragon was great. I reduced the amount of mayo and added a little lite sour cream. I pounded the chicken to an even thickness, marinated them in olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice; then grilled them in a grill pan on the stove. This added another layer of flavor with it's smokiness. This was great served in pita bread.

There is nothing better than a chicken salad laced with tarragon (a VERY typical herb paired with poultry) and grapes (a VERY typical fruit paired with poultry)! This was a great recipe, reminded of the chicken salad I used to get at a fabulous little cafe in Thomasville, Georgia. While full fat mayo is obviously the tastiest, low fat works fine if you counter the "sweetness" with a little sour cream.

To St. Louis - fruit and meats typically compliment one another very well, but I have to agree with you on this one. This reminds me of my Fat Aunt from the mid-west's awful cooking: grapes in chicken salad; marshmallow on sweet potatoes; tuna casseroles. We all felt so sorry for our Uncle and cousins!

This is delicious. One way to serve this is to prebake a pie crust and fill it with the chicken salad. After I smooth the top, I sprinkle on more chopped walnuts and a bit of paprika for color.
