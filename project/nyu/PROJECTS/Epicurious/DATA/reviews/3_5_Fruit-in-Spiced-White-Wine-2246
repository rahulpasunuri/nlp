Instead of using a fresh vanilla bean, I made use of pod I'd left over from other recipes and which were stored in turbinado sugar - tripled amount for 1.5 pods and the flavor was nice and pronounced. Also opted to discard orange after steeping. Found I liked it better after marinading for a few hours.

I made this with the corresponding almond biscotti, which was recommended by Bon Appetit. Both were outstanding. I used frozen pitted cherries, and they came out fine but a little mushy. Next time I will try the canned sour pitted cherries. This is great after a lunch.
