I made a few alterations and it turned out really tasty. The best part was I put it in the oven on time bake and came home to a complete meal with an added green salad. I under-cooked the chicken so it wouldn't be over done after baking it again. Then I used brown rice and sauteed the raw rice in the chicken juices plus some butter with the onions and some diced celery so it would be flavorful and prepped. I knew my family wouldn't go for the prunes so instead I sub-ed grated a golden d. apple. Lastly I grated asagio cheese over each layer. The bottom rice was a tad mushy, but the rest was perfect!

This is the first Epicurious recipe for which I have given only one fork. I thought this recipe was very bland and even though I followed the recipe exactly, the chicken was overdone, the rice was underdone, and the prunes did not melt into the dish as described. I didn't think the flavors melded at all.

I thought this was a great one pot meal. I used skinless boneless chicken thighs, cut up. I also upped the nutrition factor by using brown rice. It won't be bland if you use hot paprika and salt and pepper well.

My Russian-Jewish grandmother used to make "tsimmes", a similar dish (although without the rice), using lots of grated carrots, and beef instead of chicken. So I knew I'd like the carrots, onions and prunes, and the texture. The chicken turned out wonderfully moist and delicious (I used breasts), and the warm mushy texture of the dish screamed "comfort food", but even with all the paprika, pepper and salt, it didn't have much flavor. I feel it needs some key ingredient to finish it nicely. Maybe a sharp flavor like broccoli rabe on the side would pep it up.

Quite good. Julienne carrots and saut© them before layering. Using bitter prunes also gives this dish more distinct flavor.

I have made this dish since it appeared in Bon Appetit several years ago. It's simple and always gets rave reviews. Not highly seasoned. Great winter meal.

I liked the sound of a whole meal in one pot so I decided to try this. It sounded bland, so I made my own chicken stock (2 packages of chicken wings celery onion and prepared low salt broth in a crockpot overnight) and added 1 cup of white wine to the stock. I also used oregano and garlic on the chicken along with the salt and pepper. I also added about 8 oz of halved green olives to the prune layer. It was good - not exciting but easy to do and my family enjoyed it.
