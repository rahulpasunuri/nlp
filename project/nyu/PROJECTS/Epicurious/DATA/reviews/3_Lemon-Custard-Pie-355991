I made this yesterday to use up some cream and lemons. It was tasty and my friends really enjoyed it. Some advice to future users of this recipe: make sure it is not too wobbly before you take it out of the oven. I thought it was jigglin' only two inches in when i took it out but as I cut and served it...there were a lot of problems. Good thing my friends don't care too much about presentation. It was delicious but next time I will cook a bit longer

Was looking for something different and this fit the bill. Still, was expecting more lemon flavor to come thru; maybe my strainer was too fine as most of the zest was left at the bottom of it. Hubby loved it, but he loves any kind of custard. Would make again and use larger mesh strainer so I could get a little more lemon flavor.
