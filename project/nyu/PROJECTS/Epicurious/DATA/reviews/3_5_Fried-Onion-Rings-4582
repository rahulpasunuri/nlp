As my boyfriend put it, "this is a keeper".

Great recipe! Just enough coating to add a little crunch, which is what I was after. I did add 1/4 tsp of garlic powder.

I think because this is a restaurant recipe that it is harder to produce the results if you do not have all the special equipment (good thermometer, stove etc..). I think it would be easier in a deep fry-o-lator, otherwise, if you choose to make this recipe without the right tools, don't bash the recipe.

A lot of work, if you make them as a garnish for another entree (e.g., the lamb recipe linked to this recipe). However, they were very good. We added quite a bit of milk to make a batter, versus simply a flour base. I would make them again to serve as a side dish for burgers or chicken, but I would not make them again as a garnish.

If you prefer batter-dipped onion rings try adding water or milk until you get the desired consistency.

I found it to be a messy waste of time. It needs more of a batter than just a flour coating.
