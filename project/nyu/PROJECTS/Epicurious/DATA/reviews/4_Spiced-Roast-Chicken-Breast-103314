This recipe is one of my absolute favorites. We make it at home often. I heard Ruth Reichl describe the recipe on Fresh Air, and made it right after hearing the program, although I think she called it Five Spice Chicken. I make it with 4 chicken thighs. I triple all of the spices, but only double the oil and salt (otherwise it's too salty and too oily). I am still amazed that I can make something so wonderful in my home kitchen.

This recipe has become one of our standard go-to recipes for quick weekday meals. I usually omit the water entirely and just add a little more oil if needed. Amazingly tasty and easy -- so easy that it can easily be made out at the hunt camp as well! The spice mix is also great to use for seasoning in breading! Just omit the oil and water, mix in some flour, then use to bread chicken as usual. This is how I did it at the hunt camp this year (since we forgot to bring oil with us -- doh!) and it was a camp hit!

This will become a regular stand by recipe for me. It was delicious. I didn't have coriander so I substituted ground ginger instead, and sprinkled a little smoked paprika as they were browning.

Simple, and everyone I have made it for raves and requests the spice combination.

Delicious! As others suggested, I doubled the spice rub for 1 lb. of boneless/skinless chicken breasts and had just enough. Also adjusted the spices to 1/2 tsp chipotle chili powder and 1 tsp paprika. A whole tsp of chili powder would have been too spicy. Poked chicken breasts with fork before using spice rub. Baked in oven for 25 minutes at 450 degrees (covered, greased glass pan), top broiled for another 5 minutes. Surprisingly, the chicken breasts came out deliciously moist! Plenty of liquid in the pan to use for serving. Will definitely make again.

Great weekday meal. I used dried cilantro instead of coriander and cayenne instead of chilli powder (only because I didn't have any). I punctured the chicken breasts with a fork to make sure the seasoning really got in there. I skipped the frying and just roasted the chicken, covered, for ~25 mins... came out incredibly juicy and tender. This chicken would be delicious topped with some kind of salsa (e.g.: mango chutney, etc).

Holey moley! What a simple and delicious recipe. I had boneless skinless chicken breasts. Reading the reviews, I doubled the spices, halved the salt, and cooked with a little white wine (to make up for not having skin). Those were the best roasted chicken breasts I have ever made. Definitely a new staple in my house.

Delicious. I did as others said and doubled the spices. I was hesitant, and always have been, about cooking with cinnamon, but I am so glad I tried this recipe. It was amazingly tasty. The cinnamon tied it all together. It's not just another spice rub. Also before I roasted the chicken breasts, I put them in a brine solution of 1/4 salt to 4 cups water and let it sit in fridge for an hour. Thankfully I did this, because I over cooked the chicken, but it was still moist.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. The only significant change was that after the chicken came out of the oven, I deglazed with a little white wine and then added some chicken stock and cooked it down. Also, chili powders really vary, we use "pure" ones from the Mexican market rather than the spice blends sold in the supermarket. Really great flavor. I cooked the chicken in the pan until it was "blackened," wasn't sure if it would taste burnt, but it was fine.

This is one of my go to easy weeknight dinners. Always a big hit.

I have made this recipe many times with success. It can be even easier and better when simply using the rub (I doubled the amounts) on a whole chicken, skipping the browning, and roasting in a convection oven at 350 for 45 minutes. The skin is is crusty, but not greasy, and the meat is juicy and tender.

The house is filled with a brilliant, aromatic dinner-smell - a great recipe! Served old-school with a baked potato and steamed french green beans. Simple for my family, elegant for guests ... this recipe is a Keeper with a capital K.

This was a winner- as you already know from the many reviews! My comments would be I'd absolutely cook the chicken for less time than recommended, came out a bit dry. Also goes well with rice or pasta to soak up the nice sauce. Yum.

I didn't know until reading these reviews tonight that this is one of R.R.'s go to meals. I discovered this recipe (on this site) about 3 years ago, and make it almost biweekly. Now prefer it with bone-in/skin on chicken thighs. Guests always ooh and ah over it. I deglaze with white wine. Tonight I served it with couscous with shallots, raisins and almonds, and a carrot/raisin salad for a dinner party. The house smelled wonderful, and the guests ate every bite. Delicious, easy, and affordable.

Ever since Ruth Reichl talked about this recipe on Fresh Air last October have made it every two or three weeks. We love it and it fills the house with the most wonderful smell of all these spices. I usually add a pinch of curry and will try adding the stock during the roasting phase. Yummy-delish every time.

Loved this! I used cayenne instead of chili paste, and cardamom instead of coriander. I love to cook with a glass of wine, and so forgot to deglaze the chicken at the end. Nonetheless, it was still awesome. The boyfriend loved it, and it had a perfect blend of spices. Served with zucchini and a baked potato, yummy healthy meal. I'll definitely make this again, and remember to deglaze the pan this time. Oh YUM!

Rating: 4
really good, by all means cut back on the salt and i'll make it again next time deglazing with wine as others suggested.

Rating: 4
Easy to make, with ingredients I always have on hand. This one's a keeper. I doubled the spices, halved the salt, and used 3 boneless, skinless, chicken breasts. You can make the spice mix go as far as you want by diluting it with more vegetable oil. I added about 1/4 up of chicken stock (actually, I used a bouillon cube) to the pan right before throwing it in the oven. I added another 1/4 up about 10 minutes into roasting. I used a final 1/4-1/3 cup of chicken stock to deglaze the pan and create the sauce. I'll do the same thing the next time I cook this chicken.

Rating: 4
Very easy seasoning that can be made with the ingredients lying around in your pantry. Great flavor, with surprises each time you bite into it! It is even great without marinating, so literally, a great last minute "throw stuff in your pantry together" meal that seemed planned (or that you're a culinary genius)!

Love this dish. It's very quick and easy. As a novice this was one of the fancier dishes that I could whip up with the generic spices and chicken I already had in the kitchen. We paired it with green beans and mashed potatoes.

I also wanted to make the dish Ruth Reichl mentioned as one of her favorites, and look where it was! I used some chicken thighs I already had, and deglazed with stock. It turned out very nice-husband and son both approved. Next time I will use breasts to save time in the oven.

Ruth Reichl , the former editor of the magazine, "Gourmet" was on "Fresh Air with Terry Gross" on NPR this afternoon. Terry asked Ruthie what her favorite "to go" recipe was after working and then making a dinner for her husband and son after 7:30 PM. She mentioned this one, and I went out and purchased the basics( I did have the spices). This was outstanding. Quick and very flavorful, it is no wonder this came to mind in this interview. Highly recommended!

This is a perfect recipe for weeknight cooking. The mix of spices is perfect and it couldn't be easier. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, seared on both sides in an oven-safe pan, then transferred to a 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes. Took the chicken out of the pan and set aside to rest, added some chicken stock and brought it to a boil for a great little sauce. Easy and great!

Love this recipe. It is so easy and quick it makes a great weeknight dinner. I make extra spice rub to have around for future use which makes it even easier. I make this as is, but use a bit less salt. Sometimes I will also deglaze the pan with chicken stock or white wine for a bit more flavor.

This was so wonderful! I doubled the spices, halved the salt, and deglazed with wine as suggested, and served with whole grain couscous and the asparagus and broccolini salad from 101cookbooks.com (substituting broccoli florets for broccolini). This has to be one of the easiest, fastest, and TASTIEST dinners I've ever made! This is definitely going into regular rotation - even the picky fiance cleaned his plate!

This has become a weekday favorite in our house. It's easy, quick and delicious. We just grill it on the barbeque for a total of 12-15 minutes and it comes out juicy and delicious.

The whole time this was in the oven, I kept thinking that I effed this up and would be chucking some good chicken... But it came out great! I used one skinless chicken breast and used the requisite amount of spices, but felt it could have been doubled (except the salt, as noted). Also, I didn't have coriander on hand so I used some curry. I also increased the amount of cinnamon and used olive oil. For the deglaze I used chicken stock and just a pinch of sugar. If I make this again, I'm definitely serving with jasmine rice. I can almost taste it! Yums!

Rating: 4
This recipe was amazingly quick and yet delicious. I didn't have the corriander, so I had to do without it, but it was still an amazing dish. The spices were just enough to give the chicken breast a little punch. I served this with sweat peas on the side, and it was perfect. p.s. I love the way the bottom of the chicken got a little burnt when it was in the oven. Added a nice bit of grilled taste to it, as well as a little crunch.

Very good. Interesting flavors - it reminded me of a Moroccan Roasted Chicken from this website. I followed the suggestion to prepare Honey Orange Butternut Squash as a side dish - it was a good idea.

This recipe is everything I love...fast, easy and delicious. My husband gave it a 10, so it's a keeper. I used wine instead of water and added cayenne pepper. I also doubled the spices as a few other reviewers noted. Served with rice, it was easy and on the table in half an hour.

Changes I made: Boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Doubled the spices and the water and added 1/8 tsp of Cayenne. Changes I will make in the future: Same as above, with a bit less salt and more sauce. Chicken Stock or possibly wine instead of water to make it a little different, though not necessary. This is a fantastic, simple dish with a lot of kick. The subtle cinnamon really pulls it all together. I served on rice with sliced yellow pepper on the side, which was a great complement.

I have been making this recipe for a few years now, and it's the only chicken my fiance will request. The first time I misread the recipe and used ground cayenne pepper instead of chili powder. Gives it a very nice zip! I still make it that way even now that I've noticed my mistake....

This was extremely good. I also doubled the spices and halved the sauce and deglazed with chicken stock. Remember, if you double the spices, add more oil when you make the paste. I also made the jasmine rice. I recomend pouring the sauce not only on the chicken, but on the rice as well.

I put the 1-1/2 tablespoons oil in with the spices. It wasn't clear that I was to reserve some of this oil for the pan. After I dumped and mixed it in with the spices, I noticed that I was only to use 1-1/2 TEASPOONS, not tablespoons. Oops! It had to cook longer than the 18 minutes prescribed and it still came out a little rare. I cut the "pan juices" with wine as per other reviewers. It was still too greasy. These idiot-proof instructions were obviously written for smarter idiots. I won't be making this again.

Another big hit! I used bone-in chicken breasts. The next day the extras were thinly sliced and and served on spring greens and baby spinch salad (with a homemade ranch-style dressing).

A very easy and delicious dish to make. My wife Mrs. Food loved it. I doubled the ingredients for a boulder taste and instead of water, I used white wine to deglaze. I also used bacon fat to brown my chicken. I served it with sauted green beans & carrots and jasmine rice with golden raisins cooked in with the rice. Definitely use a cast iron skillet for this recipe.

This is a great recipe. Following other reviewer suggestions- doubled spices and halved the salt. I deglazed with chicken stock (didn't have white wine on hand although I'm sure that would be delicious). This is a GREAT recipe if you are looking for something tasty and quick and exciting to do with those chicken breasts. I used bone in skinless- worked out VERY well...

I have been tinkering with this recipe for several weeks, and I think I now have it. I mortared the cumin, coriander, and pepper in their whole seed forms; a little extra work, (not much), but worth the effort, and I added brown mustard seeds to the mix. I used whole breasts, bones in and skin on, making the meat very juicy and tender and adding much richness to the sauce. I degreased the pan with a Sonoma Zinfandel, the same wine I served with the dinner. The side dishes were braised celery and risotto with sweet red peppers. I get my spices from the SpiceHouse.http://www.thespicehouse.com/info/home.php Try it. Bon appetite!

I took the advice of earlier posters and doubled the spices. I thought the flavor was good, however my husband requested a little more heat in the spices next time we make it. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. We both agreed it's a keeper. It makes for a very quick and nice week night dinner. Left over chicken would be great on a salad the next day.

I'm on the fence about whether I would make this again. I might try it with boneless breasts or tenders next time. I also may marinate them. The spice mixture is good, but it did not flavor the chicken much.

Nice dish. I made chicken rolls. I used skinless boneless chicken breasts, pounded them flat, rubbed the spices on the inside, rolled 'em up then rubbed the spices on the outside. I followed the advice of using less salt. Good call. I deglazed the pan with chicken stock. Very good.

This chicken is delicious and simple to make. I have made it for three different groups and everyone loved the flavors. I found 1 tsp. salt in the spice rub to be too much, so I cut it in half and it was much better. Do not skip the deglazing step. It makes a wonderful "au jus". The jasmine rice makes an outstanding accompaniment.

I don't know what people are doing that this dish is 'bland'. Did you add all the requisite spices? This was fast, easy and tasted great. What more could you ask for? I didn't have to buy a thing - everything in the pantry already. I did grill the chicken breasts instead of baking them. It's easier, less messy and they sometimes taste better that way. Just add the spices with a little olive oil and marinate for 1/2 hour - voila! Tasty and delicious, good enough for company.

This is really good. I cut the salt in half. I made this for 7 including 3 teens and there wasn't a morsal left. I deglazed the pan with chicken stock. I also added more stock and a little cornstarch to make a light gravy. It's a "do over".

Quick, easy and delicious. The only changes I made were to only use half the amount of salt and substitute 1/2 teaspoon of Asian sesame oil for some of the vegetable oil in the spice rub. I served it with jasmine rice and my husband loved it. I'll be making this again soon.

I thought this was pretty run-of-the-mill. It wasn't bad, but with so many great chicken breast recipes on this site and elsewhere I wouldn't bother with this one again. I did reduce the salt as others have recommended - it was plenty salty with 1/2 teas, couldn't imagine using a while teaspoon.

Wow! What an easy and delightful chicken dish!! My husband and 9 year old loved it.

This was a wonderful chicken dish, but the other reviewers are right..a bit too much salt. but..the chicken was not too dry, not sopping wet. the spices were just right...it sort of tingled a spot on your tongue. my chicken-hater of a brother took a bite, the first thing he said was "delicious!" so, that in itself deserves a few "wows".

I thought the recipe sounded a little better than it actually turned out. But the results were perfectly acceptable. I thought the chili powder was a little too assertive, and will probably decrease it a little when I make this again. This was very easy to prepare and makes a nice week-night, after work dinner. I did serve it with the Jasmine rice recipe as suggested and it does complement the chicken very well.
