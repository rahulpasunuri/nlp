This dish was ok. of course, I had to use anise in place of onions, which blahhed the dish down a bit. The most disturbing thing is that this dish is truly ugly. I can't emphasize the word enough. Everything came out looking like it had gone in and come out again. Maybe if I could find a way to make a better presentation and add a little bite, I might make it again.

Dry rub is a great idea--mine was 1.5t cumin, 1.5t chili powder, pinch of coriander and salt. Doubling the veggies is a great idea. The resulting broth is delicious, be sure to serve with bread or something to sop it up.

I also used a dry rub, but that was the only difference from the recipe. I cut the potato very thin, like chips, and it was delicious. I would add more onion and potato. This was a quick, easy and tasty dinner.

I took the advice of others and made a dry rub with brown sugar, cinnamon, cumin, curry, ginger, cayenne and nutmeg and subsituted apple cider for the chicken stock. I also simmered it for 15 minutes instead of 10. My picky eater boyfriend devoured 2 of the chops. It was quite delicious.

Loved this one! Took advice from reviews and used a dry rub on chops with brn sugar, chili powder, cumin and coriander. Extra chili powder on potatoes. Great flavor.

I gave this three forks for delicious. It was very yummy and easy, and I did not find it bland at all. I left out the onions because my boyfriend doesn't like them. I used a good-quality canned chicken stock and made sure to brown the chops well (I used a cast iron skillet). We'll definitely make this recipe again.

Very good week night recipe. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers, and seasoned the pork chops with cumin and coriander, salt and pepper, before sauteing them in the pan. Also, I had no sweet potatoes on hand, so I tried substituting half a butternut squash, thinly sliced. Tasty! The flavours all blend very well together. I think next time that I will mix up a little cornstarch and water to thicken up the juices in the pan, as they were very good, but got forgotten in the bottom of the pan.

Taking the lead from other reviewers about blandness, I used a dry rub of chili powder, cayenne and paprika. Rather than boneless chops, I started with a 3 lb pork loin which I sliced tinto 1 inch pieces. I also added one diced poblano pepper.I let mixture cook until potatoes were tender: about one hour. Came out quite well. I'll try again.

Also based on what others did, I modified the recipe in the following way and it was delicious! I made a dry rub of cumin, coriander, brown sugar, chili powder, cayenne, salt and black pepper to coat the chops with before browning. After sautéing the apple, onion, and sweet potato mixture, to which I added more chili powder, I added about 1/3 cup of chicken stock and let everything cook about 5 minutes longer.. By doing that I did not have hard potatoes and the chops were not dry! Awesome flavors! The chili with the sweet potato/apple mix is way delicious!

Great results for such an easy recipe. Based on the earlier reviews that mentioned (1) the pork could be dry, (2) the potatoes could be hard, and (3) the whole dish could lack flavor, I made the following modifications: chose nice, thick pork chops and made sure to leave the fat on for flavor; rubbed the chops before browning with a cumin/coriander/salt/pepper mixture, and sauteed the potatoes & onion for 10 minutes rather than 7. Awesome flavors. If it's not zippy enough for you add some cayenne, or make sure there's enough salt to make the existing flavors stand out.

It sounds good on paper , but this recipe doesn't hold up. The sweet potatoes and apples were undefined from each other and the pork chops were dry. There are better pork chop recipes, it's not worth making this one.

Rating: 3
What a great recipe! I made this as described, just using two medium apples instead of one large (fujis), and added a little rosemary. Simmered for closer to 20 minutes at the end. Pork chops were super, super moist and tender. Sweet potatoes, apples, onions were a nice side and complement. It's true that the dish is mild, but still delicious.

Rating: 3
A nice change from the pork chop-in-a-bag. Not being brought up with lots of flavors or change, this is a good start if you want something different, but not TO different. Could be cooked longer than suggested, potatoes and apples had a bit of a "bone". Even my 16 month old liked it! We'll probably make again.

Rating: 4
With a few modifications, this recipe was great! I tend to start cooking before ascertaining availability of ingredients, making it necessary to improvise along the way. I browned the pork, sweet potato slices (same thickness as pork) and lots of onion slices in olive oil, layered the lot in a casserole dish, and stuck several whole cloves of garlic in the low spots. Some leftover white wine and beer (to make up the difference) de-glazed my frying pan nicely, I added the cinnamon and ground nutmeg, cloves and ginger (as recommended by other reviews) a chicken bouillon cube and mixed it with applesauce as I didn't have any apples. Think I added a little bit of balsamic vinegar for zip. Dumped sauce on top, baked for an hour - gorgeous. My husband cleaned it up, and he doesn't like pork or sweet potatoes!

Rating: 1
Very bland. I added nutmeg and pumpkin spice, still needed more flavor. Cooked longer than specified, potatoes need longer to cook. Doubt I will make again.

Good change for boring pork chops. Make this dish as is, then based on your preference try different variations later. There are many possibilities.

This is a wonderful recipe. My husband and I both love it and have made it twice in a week! I doubled the amount of vegetables and fruit in relation to the pork and added 1/2 cup frozen cherries because I didn't have the full amount of apple. It is excellent as leftover too. When reheating, I sliced the pork chops about 1/2 inch thick. I may do this the next time I make the recipe from scratch.

I found this recipe to be fairly bland. It lacked depth of flavour ... perhaps a bit of apple cider vinegar and/or maple syrup would have made it better.

Rating: 2
Made the recipe "as is," the first time. I concur with other reviewers who added more veggies; 4 chops would serve four if there were more potatoes and apples. As it is, half the meat but only about 20% of the veggies became left-overs. I'm not knocked over by the recipe, but my spouse, who usually doesn't like anything having to do with yams, loved it.

Actually, I'm reviewing a similar dish found on another site. (!) I found this one first, but was looking for an oven version, which I finally found and adjusted a bit. It was fabulous, flavorful, and will be repeated here frequently I'm sure. If you're curious: Brown 4 pork chops, dredged in flour/salt/pepper, in a small amount butter, margarine or oil, in a large oven-proof skillet. Layer 2 sliced onions, 2 sliced sweet potatoes (including skin) and 2 sliced apples (including skin), in 2 layers over chops, dusting each layer with salt, pepper, brown sugar (total 3 - 4 Tblsp.) and cinnamon. Top with a sprinkling of nutmeg. Then drizzle approx. 1 cup apple cider over all. Cover and slow-bake at 325 degrees for about 2 hours, until sweet potatoes are tender and top begins to brown. Yum! Chops are fork-tender and flavorful, and my non-pork-fan husband was totally enamored. AND the house smelled fabulous on a winter night. Not bad, I'd say!

I sliced the potatoes about 2-3mm thick, and my apples to eight slices/apple. Adding some extra time to the potato/onion cook time, with these thicknesses, gave a perfectly cooked sweet potato and apples with varying mushiness--something for everybody! :) I think getting everything just the right texture is a matter of matching thicknesses to your cooktime. Also, wanting less meat and more produce, I used only two chops, two very large sweet potatoes, and two smaller apples. Ironically, I only used half of an onion, and it was plenty. A healthy meal, and very easy and quick. Only one dish!

Sounds like a perfect fall recipe, but something was missing. Perhaps apple cider would be a better choice than chicken broth.

This wasn't bad, it just wasn't good. The pork chops were juicy and delicious but the apples were mushy and the potatoes too hard. If I were to make it again, I'd cook the potatoes longer before adding the apples. The dish looked beautiful on the platter; it just didn't taste as good as it looked.

I made this recipe but added fresh ginger and pureed the sweet potatoes, apples and ginger mixture in a food processor (or blender) to make it more like mashed potatoes. It tasted better and also married the flavors better.

Good for a change of pace, but nothing special.

The vegetable component of this dish was delicious (I doubled the veggies and added fresh ginger and nutmeg). I didn't even bother with the chicken broth--with the extra spices, water worked fine as the liquid. But the pork chops, though cooked through, were a little tough and didn't absorb much of the flavor of the sauce. I will probably make this again, because I like the flavor combination a lot, but may try braising the pork chops for a little longer.

Good idea and easy, but definitely bland--increase spices, maybe add nutmeg. Also, especially if your pork chops are thick, cook them more before adding to the veggies, because the veggies got terribly soft.

This is a nice, "regular" recipe for feeding your family regularly. It's cheap and fast. The first time I made it, it was bland - no doubt. The second time I made it, it was wonderful. The second time I bought fresh cinnamon and I used a large, dark red, thick-skinned apple. If your cinnamon has been in the cupboard a while, throw it away.

Rating: 4
It turned out great! To fix the blandness of the chops, i used dry rub and marinated it in apple juice for about an hour. I was not sure how to deglaze the pan (the brown stuff in the pan looked burnt and I did not want the burnt taste), so I washed the pan, sauteed onions in half olive oil and half butter (butter makes ANYTHING taste yummy!) As suggested, I used apple juice instead of broth. Definitely not a low fat dish but who cares!

Rating: 3
I made this because I had a big sweet potato I wanted to use up. Keeping in mind the complaints about blandness, I seasoned one side of the pork chop (yes, I used only one, a solitary meal, but it was a thick chop) with cumin. The sweet potato-onion-apple combo is good, and I look forward to the leftover veggies as a side dish. If I make this again, I will up the cinnamon count just a little (amazing how the spice gets absorbed) and use a yellow onion rather than a white onion for a bit more bite to offset the sweet potato. Don't bother with the chicken broth. The apple provides quite enogh moisture--my covered heat-up with apple and cinnamon made a nice little gravy.

This recipe scored high in the "tasty" and "super easy to prepare" categories making it a definite winner. We used the same proportions of the other ingredients but made 2 extra chops and used an extra 1/4 cup of broth. Turned out excellent and made a nice dinner with some salad and chianti.

This is a good use of pork chops, as well as of sweet potatoes. I made it as written, but did include some Nature's Seasons (seasoning salt) and the result did not seem bland at all. I will make it again.

There were elements of this recipe I liked a lot. The sweet potato-apple combination worked nicely. The pork turned out somehow a bit bland, though. I wonder if a brining in advance a day or two (as suggested with some other pork recipes here) would help. Also, this seems like a real cold weather, in-front-of-the-fireplace kind of meal.

I must echo the comment of the "one fork" person. My husband liked it, but I found it to lack punch. Very thin pork chops are necessary in order for the sauce (which tastes mostly of mustard) to be tasted at all.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. I'm typically not a big fan of fruit with meat, but this was tasty. I used two sweet potatoes, and added more salt & pepper. Did not peel the apples - I think they would disintegrate if you did. I doubled the quantity of chicken broth, and cooked the potatoes longer to be sure they were done. This recipe provided a nice diversion from the ordinary.

I made a delicious cream sauce for the pork chops by doing the following: lightly dust chops with flour before sauteing, add 1/2 tablespoon butter to the pan while sauteing onions, add 1/4 cup white port along with the chicken broth, and after the dish is cooked, remove the meat and vegetables to serving plates, reduce the liquid in the pan until it thickens slightly and whisk in 1/2 cup half and half. Pour the sauce over the porkchops. I also substituted 1/8 teaspoon paprika for the cinnamon (don't like cinnamon), and I peeled the apple and sliced the yam into 1/3" thick slices, as recommended by previous cooks. It's an easy and delicious dish and only uses one pan ~ clean-up's a breeze.
