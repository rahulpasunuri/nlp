Outstanding and so simple. I do prefer chicken stock however, and would consider the jalapenos optional (depending on who you'll be serving it to). Serve with a large spoonful of sour cream on top.

Quick and easy. Nice spice, not at all overpowering. Makes a beautiful lunch with a dollop of sour cream and a slice of avocado.

Very Good!!! I have made it twice. Once with dry beans and once with canned. The dry beans were much better. Not to spicy. Just enough! I topped it with fresh avacodo. And fresh salsa. Awesome. Also... the second time I used chicken stock. it worked well.

Delicious. Made it for someone who needed healthy, comfort food after surgery. Followed recipe, but without the jalapeno. It still had plenty of flavor and everyone was excited for seconds.

Ok, this was an excellent recipe but it was way too spicy for me with the jalapeno seeds left in. Next time I will remove them. In fact, my husband used the leftover soup as a base for another recipe a few days later, and it was still too spicy. I'm not a total wuss, and I can handle a bit of spice (in a restaurant I would normally order things with a "medium" spice). So if you like things really hot leave in those seeds. Otherwise, take them out!

It's got lots of flavor. Definitely a keeper. I forgot the cumin and tried it w/o first, and it still tasted great.

Better to use chicken broth instead of vegetable - we found it definitely had more flavor and kick.

FANTASTIC recipe! My husband and I love this soup! There is an immediate burst of flavor followed by a nice lingering kick from the jalapenos. I made the soup in large batches so that we could reheat over the following couple of days. The flavor just intensifies over time. Great for the cold winters!

Easy to make. I used canned black beans with 2 cups chicken stock to speed it up a bit. Sauteed bacon with onion and garlic and used red pepper flakes instead of jalapeno.

All I can say is excellent. I use only 1/2 t. salt though.

Added a can of extra hot rotel, extra cumin, bay leaf & used chicken broth. Offered extra cilantro, diced raw onions, feta cheese, sour cream, lime & red wine vinegar as toppings. The vinegar gives it a nice fresh kick.

Good combination of ingredients to yield a very flavorful soup. I put my beans in a crockpot to cook throughout the day and simply sauted the remaining ingredients and added it to the beans. Then I pureed half of it and added it to the whole bean portion of the soup to have a quick and very tasty meal! Loved it! Also great with homemade salsa.

This is an excellent soup made fantastic with a few simple modifications. I used 4 cans chicken broth and 3 cans of canned black beans; did not have canned jalepenos, so instead used about 1/2 tsp of chipotle flakes added with the onions and garlic. I also used a 12 oz. package of precooked jalapeno chicken sausage which I cut into small pieces and added with the black beans. The best change to this dish was to use heaping measures of whole coriander and cumin seed, roast them in the dry pan to start and then grind them for the soup. I used a Braun wand chopper thing to puree just enough of the beans and sausage in the pot to make it a little thicker. This was an amazing soup!

My husband and I loved this soup. I used chicken stock instead of veggie stock which gave it a nice, rich flavour. I came up short on the jalepenos so I added a rawit chile which gave it a definite kick. It was very simple to make once I found the ingredients. Although it cost me about euros 30 to make, I would definitely make it again when I crave spicey food.

Very flavorful soup, easy to make. I used a whole 16oz bean package so it wasn't too thin, it came out just great. A definite keeper.

We've made this numerous times. Great comfort food, and with much more flavor than other black bean soup recipes.

I have made this more times than I can count. I almsot have the recipe memorized. It's a great soup to make in the crock pot--just make sure you give it about 10-12 hours so that the beans get throughly cooked. When I make it in the crock pot, I get lazy and only quarter the onions--since I throw it in the blender at the end, this doesn't seem to make a difference. I've made this for numerous people and church suppers and every time I get people asking for the recipe.

I'm with Canada, it was a bit too thin for my preference and I reduced the broth to 5 cups. Unless you're dead set on using dried beans, I think canned beans work just fine. I added diced yellow bell pepper to the mix as well. Would make it again, but with modifications. I will continue my search for the perfect black bean soup.

Great dish. Double recipe for a lunchtime leftover treat. Also, add a dollop of cool plain yogurt (low-fat works great) for extra goodness. The contrast of the temperatures and textures (not to mention the colors) makes for an outstanding dish.

This soup is delicious and easy, especially if you use canned black beans. It cuts the preparation time in half! This soup made the perfect first course to a meal of chile rellenos and spanish rice!

I find this recipe works very well but I soak the beans overnight before making it plus add the cilantro after blending as I find that its more visually appealing.

I found this to be too thin, even though I reduced the broth to 7 cups. I prefer a really hearty, thick black bean soup. My daughter loved it though...great spicy flavour. Will make it again but will increased bean content to make it thicker.

I think this came out great. I used 1 can of black beans, instead of dry. Used 1 can of Chicken Broth instead of Vegetable Broth (b/c I didn't have any) and mixed in a tsp of FF Regular Yogurt. Probably could be a little thicker, but is great.

It was great. My husband, a bean expert, really enjoyed it. I soaked the bean the night before. That reduces the cooking time in half!! I also added some chorizo once and bacon another time. It was great. I once used the blender; the other time I did not (for variety purposes). And I chopped the cilantro and put it on top. Much better. You could also add some sour cream on top and some sort of chilies (mexican). Enjoy!!

This came out great!!! Although I changed a few things: I used 6 cups of chicken stock and 2 cups of beef stock, also added dried and pureed pablano peppers-I soaked them in water to soften, then I pureed them with a little water. Be careful not to use too much(I used one pepper) they are extremely hot!! I didn't add them until after the soup was cooking for one hour. I also added two bay leaves, used only 1.5 cups onion-but added .5 cup green onion-added just at the end. I only cooked the soup for an hour and 15 minutes but returned it to a boil and left the lid off for about 20 minutes-I wanted it a little thicker. This soup is great with diced chicken and/or beef.

A solid black bean soup recipe, not exciting but soothing to the soul on an icky day.

This is an easy recipe to make and freezes well. It was even better the next time it was served.

I used canned beans (two 15oz, drained cans) instead and perhaps I did not use enough because my husband and I both felt it could have been more bean dense. We did add some tortilla chips to it to add some crunch and that was tasty.

I sauteed some celery and red pepper with the onion and garlic and it came out excellent. I will make again.
