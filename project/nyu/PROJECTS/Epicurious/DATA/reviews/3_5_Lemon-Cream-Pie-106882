Made this using Meyer lemons from my tree. OMG. Had it for Christmas. It was awesome. The addition of whipped cream toned down the tartness of the curd. However, next time I will not add as much cream. We like the lemon flavor to pop

I made this for our Easter dinner yesterday and it was delicious. My husband loved it. I followed the recipe exactly as provided but I did cook the curd longer than 9 minutes, closer to 15 to make it thick. Reviewers, please do not rate a recipe if you did not follow the recipe! Using cream cheese instead of whipping cream doesn't make sense! I am making this next weekend and will definitely be making this on a regular basis. I made a homemade graham cracker crust for the base. Delicious!

This is a wonderful lemon cream pie. I have given it only 3 forks, however, because the cooking instructions for the lemon curd are wrong. Using medium heat there is no way the curd will thicken enough in 7-9 minutes! Total time should be 15-20 minutes depending on the heat of your burner. It sounds like the experienced cooks in the group instinctively adjusted for that. At medium heat, it will take 7-9 minutes for the curd to START to thicken...which happens rather suddenly, by the way. Continue to cook and whisk over medium heat for another 6-10 minutes until it is very thick. At this point, prevent the curd from boiling by moving it off and on the heat, whisking constantly so nothing burns on the bottom of the pan. I was pretty aggressive about the heat at the beginning..which is not a good idea for beginners as you run the risk of scrambling the eggs..yuk!...and it took me 15 minutes to get a beautiful and thick curd. The key is in the texture. It should be very thick! All other instructions are good..ie, cooling for 3-4 hours before you fold in the whipped cream and making it the day before a dinner party to be safe. Has anyone tried this recipe with part-skim ricotta cheese and a little half and half instead of the heavy cream to cut down the fat content?

Good lemon pie try with a lemon graham cracker crust.

This is a very lovely light summer dessert. I used a graham cracker crust and thought it was a good combination.

wonderful!! ten out of ten!!! i've made this a few times for guests and they always rave. this is my husband's favorite! the trick really is to let it set for a good 24 hours. it's will never be firm, but it will hold. the flavor is amazing. i've never been asked for a recipe more than this one.

it's really too bad that this recipe has gotten such a bad rap because it's really wonderful! first off....i know it's bad to dis past reviewers, but really, a toddler not liking it and it not holding birthday candles...please. make it just as the recipe instructs (this is a fabulous lemon curd..far less sweet than most, i use it for summer trifle as well) make sure both the curd and crust are cooled well enough (three hours, minimum, for both..i also recommend the vanilla wafer crust from the chocolate cream pie recipe on this site) before folding the cream in and filling the shell...then chill for at least 24 hours (not a big deal, make it the night before the dinner) and it'll be perfect. this is a great pie...decadent but refreshing after a big meal. and no...it won't hold candles...this is a real cream pie (it"ll be a bit mousse-y at it's most set)...if you want a stiff pie look for a gross gelatin based concoction. sorry..,..i love this sight but sometimes i just don't get why people are complaining!! try this as written and enjoy.

I had no problems with the pie setting up. It needs ample time to refrigerate, and of course make sure the lemon curd is completely cold before you fold in the whipped cream. As far as taste, it has a very pronounced tart lemon taste. The addition of whipped cream does not really cut down on the tartness at all. So if you want a more mild lemon flavor, i would suggest reducing the lemon juice to a half cup. Overall, a good pie and easy to make.

I guess the only thing I can add here is: FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS...don't try to change them, don't substitute, don't add your own little touches...follow the directions and the pie will turn out...it was delicious and my family liked it fine...it does need a while to set up so make it the afternoon before and all will be fine...just follow the directions as written...use the stated ingredients...do not improvize with what you think might work...exactly as written and you will have a great dessert!

This pie was a real 'hit' at a BBQ I hosted recently. I made it with a Digestive Biscuit (UK) pie crust. The pie crust was not too sweet and complimented the filling quite well. I substituted lime juice for the lemon juice and it tasted like a 'Key Lime Pie', Which I have never had luck making. I added a bit of corn starch while cooking the filling to thicken the consistancy.

I loved this recipe. It was easy to prepare with just a few ingredients, and it was light and refreshing. I prepared it exactly according to the instructions, but it was too soft at serving time. However, the next day it had firmed up perfectly, so I would suggest allowing at least 24 hours for it to set. Delicious!

I read the other reviews which challenged me to make this pie. I didn't have whipped cream so used softened cream cheese instead whipped with a hand mixer along with the lemon filling. It set up fine and my husband really enjoyed it. It has to have sufficient refridgerator time to set up properly. I would make it again.

After reading the below reviews, I tried this recipe. I followed the instructions for the lemon filling to the letter. But added 3 TBL. of powdered sugar and 1/4 tsp. vanilla to the whipped cream before I whipped it. I hoped this would prevent a runny pie like one reviewer had experienced. I was wrong. My pie was runny and not tasty. In summary... it was disgusting. (My toddler daughter took a bite, spit it on her hand, and wiped it on my skirt.) I do have a suggestion for anyone who may be daring enough to remedy this recipe: Instead of whipped cream, try using softened cream cheese.

Vancouver, sounds like you're the one who didn't follow directions...

I should know better than to listen to other reviewers who don't know how to follow recipe directions, then complain when it doesn't turn out. Because the first two reviewers said they had such difficulty with the pie setting, I thought that I would add a tablespoon of cornstarch to the mixture, while cooking, as a thickener. Well, now it's too thick. It would have been just fine as is, people just need to follow the directions properly. On a flavor note, I only had two lemons so I was only able to get 1/2 cup of juice so I used about 3 teaspoons of zest. Overall, a bit too lemony and tart. I will make again but reduce the lemon zest and increase the sugar to 1 cup. Used a pre-made graham wafer crust which was good. Finally, make sure you strain the filling to get rid of the zest fragments. This could be a solid "three forks" with the above noted adjustments. It's simple and easy and quite quick, to add to the recipe's credit.

this was a disaster from the beginning. I was searching for a dessert to make my fiance for his birthday (he doesn't like cake) and he chose lemon cream pie from a stack of recipes... I saw the warning from the other reviewer but thought, "if I just whip the cream enough and fold it gently".. well. Let me just say DISASTER!! When I stuck the candles in they kept tipping over, they looked like a buoys in a hurricane. I lit them all and ran into the dining room, candles tipping, dripping and sinking into Davy Jones' abyss while my finace fanned them out with my cookbook. I sliced into it and spooned out two bowls of lemon cream soup. The icing on the cake was when he took a few bites and his throat closed off from the acid in the lemon juice! The flavor was pretty good though.
