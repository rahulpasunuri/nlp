Delicious ice cream. I substituted half and half for the whole milk for a creamier result. Used peaches from our peach tree we'd frozen last fall and it was fine. I also left the fruit chunks out of the finished ice cream and served it with a peach tart instead. Yummy!

This is good - and a great way to make use of the super abundance of peaches we have in our back yard!

We had this peach ice cream tonight and it was marvelous, so peachy. We have great peaches in the fall in Colorado. I used soy milk and soy 'creamer'. I left my custard in the refrig for 3 days and it was fine. I will go with honey the next time.

Agree with using Half & Half, rather than cream. We are lucky to have great peaches, grown by local farmers in Palisade CO. You must have good peaches, allowing them to ripen. The Ice Cream tasted creamy and rich. The custard consistency was thick and glossy, hence the cream was not missed. I made a couple of changes to the recipe for the second batch. I used Honey Powder instead of sugar and swirled a fair amount of very good quality, organic honey in the finished custard before pouring it in the ice cream maker. I also added just 1/4 tsp Cardamon. The cardamon and honey gave the recipe an exotic twist. If your not a cardomon fan, omit the spice, but definetly try it with honey rather than sugar, it's delicious.

There's plenty of peach flavor in another recipe on this site: Peache ice cream with vanilla scented peaches. It's made with both the peach skins and pits (theyre steeped then strained out). I've made it with and without the extra peaches...try it! My notes suggest reducing the cream and increasing the milk.

I'm not sure if its me or the quality of the peaches around here, but I just could not get a good discernible peach flavor. Followed the recipe, pretty standard really, I made one change and that was using half and half inplace of the milk and cream. Good custard consistency, good ice cream consistency too. So, moral of the story is don't bother unless you have a basket of the "kitchen sink" style peaches to start with!
