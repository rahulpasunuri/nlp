Very good recipe! I used gluten free flour and replaced buttermilk by half & half. Otherwise I followed what other recipes said: baked the scones for 18 minutes at 375 degres in the oven. It is a success and I can't wait to taste them with butter, jelly or peanut butter.

a traditional hit!!! The kids loved eating something from their heritage that actually tasted good and was vegetarian safe, tasted even better with butter and jam. The texture was in between a biscuit and what we've come to know of scones, perfect for kids!! not many kids love scones right?? I give it 3 plates and two four forks

I didn't rate this because I baked the scones rather than cooking them on the griddle. (The discussion of authenticity below made me smile--since I'm wealthy enough to afford an oven, surely it is most authentic to go ahead and use it.) The texture was okay, but was definitely more of a biscuit texture than a scone texture. Likewise, the flavor was okay, but unremarkable.

THE BEST low-fat biscuit recipe! I hate to be non-traditional, but I baked mine as per felice123's suggestion.

Believe it or not, I adapted this recipe for sweet-free strawberry shortcake. I replaced the 1 cup buttermilk with 1 smushed banana, sour cream, and skim milk . I made flat "cakes" and baked at 375F for 18 minutes (as per felice123's suggestion). It was INSANELY good with fresh, organic strawberries and fat-free organic yogurt!!

Successfully halved this recipe and made six scones on the griddle. Very nice flavor and texture.

These are scones as the poor of Scotland would have. They are traditional scones, not biscuits. The point of cooking them on the griddle or stovetop is because only the rich had ovens.

These are, in fact, not biscuits. They are traditional scottish scones. They are unlike what we now think of as scones, but they are the originals. The point of baking them on the griddle or stove top is that ovens were avaliable only to the rich.

As the recipe indicates, these are traditional Scottish scones--which often don't contain any sugar at all. Very much like a biscuit.

These are great biscuits but definately NOT scones. We will actually use this recipe next time we want a good buscuit breakfast. Try them, the're really delicious.

Excellent scones! My family loved them with apricot preseves. I did not enjoy griddling them so I put them in a 375 oven for about 18 minutes. I like the oven-baked texture even better.

Rustic, hearty and easy to make. Flaky and delicious!
