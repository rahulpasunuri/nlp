Not worth the effort. It was tasty, but it took 2 hours to make (admittedly, it was a weekday, I started at 8:00 pm, andI had to shell the pistachios, which added 30 minutes to the meal). The sauce was fine but nothing special, but the fried leeks were a very positive addition to the meal. If I were to make it again (unlikely), I would definitely buy shelled pistachios and use a bit less chili sauce.

outstanding a company dish and use the pistachios skipped the leeks

there was only 1 problem with the recipe. "Add sesame seed oil to pan at High heat". This caused a fire in my pan. Luckily I had another pan - exactly like the 1st, and adjusted the heat to Medium-High or Level 7. This was fabulous. I brought an extra piece for a coworker. He was literally drinking the remaining sauce out of the bowl.

The sauce in this recipe is absolutely delicious. I freeze it (since I don't always have Kaffir lime leaves) and I use it whenever I grill pork....I have not bothered with the pistachios in subsequent meal preparations but they were a nice addition the first time I made this dish.... yum!!!

Made this for a friend for what sounded like a nice, chilly fall evening meal. It really was wonderful. My buddy is allergic to seafood so I used Hoisin sauce instead of Oyster and still the sauce was wonderful. I also decided to serve the pork on top of a pool of pureed sweet potatoes, butter and cream. The flavors were wonderful together and honestly, the sauce tasted great with the sweet potatoes as well. Have a houseguest next weekend and I'm making this again for sure. Easy and delicious.

I have been canning my own homemade plum sauce off my tree all week, (various styles from sweet to hot and sour) and decided to make something with it...quick. This recipe was great because I had all the ingredients on hand and just needed to connect the dots. I constantly appreciate this site for the inspiration to experiment.

This dish is all about the plum sauce - it could be served on almost anything and it would be the STAR!

This was very good. I recommend grinding the pistachios with a food processor or they don't stick well. Also, one could do with fewer than 3 keffir lime leaves, but the taste of these are important. I bought these once at a Thai grocery and keep them in the freezer.

I loved the sauce! I wish that I had doubled it and will next time I make it. I didn't know what kaffir lime leaves are and didn't want to look for them so I used lime juice. I did add more orange juice since I wanted more sauce. But what is the deal with the pistachio crust? They didn't stick on well at all and ended up just being a kind of topping.

excellent! Great for company. I did omit the leeks, however.

This pork was very, very tender and the pistachio crust gave it some oomph. I used Sake with sugar code 3 because I couldn't find Mirin. The sauce made the pork even better. Great! I'd highly recommend this dish!

It was a winner at a recent dinner/birthday party. There was so much of it that you could do ahead that I will serve it again for party of 8-12.

Great fast and do-ahead recipe. Made this for company and everyone loved it. The crispy fired leeks were a great accompaniment! Will make it again.

I forgot to mention- I would double the pistachio measurement and I also marinated the pork overnight- it was very soft and moist after baking.

After all of the "too salty" reviews- I shopped carefully for my oyster sauce and compared ingrediants from one sauce to the next. The oyster sauce I used is from Thailand and the first ingrediant listed is oyster extract followed by sugar, salt, soy bean, wheat flour, corn starch, and sodium benzoate. This product does not contain MSG like so many of the others -unless- sod ben is another derivative of MSG (I don't know and at this point- am lazy to find out))- anyhow- I TRIPLED the sauce for about 7 pounds of meat and it came out beautifully- and -I used the SALTED nuts. The only ingrediants I didn't triple in the sauce are the chili/garlic sauce,sugar and vinegar- I kept those at the listed measurements for 1.5 pounds. I salted the loins very little before browning and cooked the loins whole at 350- but- it took about an hour and a half (they were huge)- I would raise the temp to 375 so as not to burn the outside of the meat. Turned out well and was not salty- everyone enjoyed it but not enough to ask for the recipe. It was good- but not phenominal. I hope this helps for you bigger dinner party throwers.

Yummy! I reduced the chili-garlic sauce to 1 Tbsp because I have toddlers and it was spicy enough for me. There were enough pistachios for a light coating, will probably use more next time. The leeks were a nice complement.

Rating: 3
I made the sauce without oyster sauce and added 1/3 cup of fig preserves, which I had on hand. It really added depth. Also, I brushed the sauce onto the edges of the pork and rolled only the edges in the pistachios, which made for a nice presentation.

This was one of the most fabulous dishes I have ever made! The pork tasted wonderful, and with the crispy leeks, it was just amazing...there were absolutely no leftovers! And the leeks tasted wonderful on mashed potatoes as well!

This is a temperamental recipe. The end result depends a lot on the quality of the sauces you put in. I cook Asian food frequently and know that the tastes of oyster sauce, plum sauce and hoisin sauce can differ greatly depending on the brand of sauce. If people have suggestions for less salty sauces, please post them. I have found that the Lee Kum Kee brands tend to be very salty and stale. Decreasing the amount of oyster sauce, chili sauce and adding hoisin sauce I found to be a must. This came out tasting much more like Chinese food than the name suggested. From the title, I thought this would be a sweeter, fruitier dish.

Tried the recipe again this week and it was MUCH better. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and substituted hoisin sauce for the oyster sauce. It was much less salty and the plum taste was more prominent. I also added a little more lime juice (approx 1 TBS) when it started to get thick and it made a nice contrast in tastes. I'll now definitely make it again.

I made this dish for a progressive dinner (after testing it first) and served it to 10 people who did everything but lick the plate. I did have to decrease the chili-garlic sauce considerably. I've made it several times & it's one of my family's favorites. TERRIFIC!!!

Very tasty! Used turkey tenderloin, only 1 1/2T chili-garlic sauce and baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. came out moist and perfectly done. Only problem was that most of the unsalted nuts fell off the tenderloin when it was sliced.

Rating: 2
My husband would give this a 3, but my son and I agree that the sauce wasn't great. I think that the name of the sauce is misleading - it hardly resembles plum sauce when done - you hardly know it was even added. Although I used low salt broth and unsalted nuts and did not salt the pork, I still thought the sauce was too salty. There are better ways to prepare pork tenderloin.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! Very easy and delicious for a dinner party with sesame asparagus, spinach and sticky rice with scallions. I had some leftover pieces of tenderloin that I sauteed then added the sauce in the pan to heat through. That was just as good as the original, even without the pistachios.

Rating: 4
I have made this twice in the last two weeks for guests. Everyone loves it, and it is so easy to make, once the sauce is done. The sauce can be made adhead of time. Just make sure you use tenderloin and not loin. The meat must be of very high quality to cook so quickly. Follow the directions and it comes out perfectly.

Excellent. I was wary of the combination of flavors in this, but even as a novice cook, this was wonderful. Followed the recipe exactly. I made this for a talented chef and received rave reviews.

This was so delicious and looked beautiful on the platter. I followed the directions to a tee. Since I am in NY the Asian markets are plentiful. The dinner party was a huge hit with this dish however, Imade it for 10 people and it was a bit labor intensive for that many people. My only suggestion would be to double the amount of pistachios. Also, the ingredients list doesn't specify salted or unsalted nuts. Definitly use UNSALTED!!!

OMG!!!!!this was absolutely yummy!!!!!this has been the year that i have been trying to improve my sauce making skills and with this recipe i look like an expert!!!!!!!! did this dinner for my husband and i and he is still RAVING about the sauce! i know that i will need to do this recipe for guests sometime soon. this is destined to become a favorite. the fried leeks were a wonderful complement.

I loved this recipe although I changed it just a little for my style. I used some of the sauce to marinate whole pork tenderloins. I browned the whole tenderloins and then brushed them with more sauce and rolled them in the pistachios and roasted them whole at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes. After letting the meat rest slightly, I sliced into medallions. I put the plum sauce into a squeeze bottle to decorate the plates and sauce one side of each medallion which I served around a center mold of rice. Next time I would strain the sauce first to prevent clogging of the bottle. It was truly delicious - my guests loved it.

Wow is this good! I also found the ingredients in central Indiana at a regular super market - you have to look in the asian food isle.

oops...forgot the mirin, but yum..yum...yum....i didn't have kaffir lime leaves, so i used the lime juice and zest option. i quadrupled the sauce to use up the can of chicken broth. i plan to use it tomorrow night with coconut crusted chicken breast. also, to make it easier i just sauteed it completely on the stove at medium heat instead of putting it in the oven....just flour then egg then nuts.

Excellent dish! I had a problem finding plum sauce, so I simply substituted jellied cranberries. Additionally, I added extra lime juice and ommitted the vinegar and sugar at the end of cooking the sauce. Thank you for such a unique recipe; it will be shared.

This was really tasty. To the lady who couldn't find the plum sauce or chili-garlic sauce, why didn't you try looking in the Asian market where you got the lime leaves?

This is delicious. I do not know what the previous reviewer is talking about--I live in Indiana and they have plum sauce and chili-garlic sauce in ALL of the international food sections of the major chain supermarkets. If you do any chinese cooking these are staples, not exotic at all. Easy and well worth trying for "novice" cooks, too.

These are the words of a disgruntled cook. My diners loved this dish, they were absolutely transported. My difficulty was in finding the correct ingredients, and this in a pretty big supermarket not too far from Boston. The lime leaves were no problem--I asked my boyfriend to stop at an Asian market near his house. But I couldn't find plum sauce or chili-garlic sauce and had to do some very careful (and time-consuming) label reading in the aisles to find a plum based glaze (a ham glaze) and a ginger-garlic indian paste that I ended up not using once I opened it and instead substituted a Caribbean hot sauce that was hanging around my fridge. My second gripe was with the time estimate for cooking the pork in the oven. If you have a 1 1/2 inch thick chunk of pork tenderloin that has been merely browned on both sides, it obviously is not going to cook to 150 degrees in a 350 oven in ten minutes. Mine took more like half an hour but I'm glad I was patient--the pork was perfectly cooked and as tender as could be. So it was good. But I couldn't help thinking of a dish I had made the day before for a client who likes that sort of stuff that had a gravy composed of several Campbell's soups, sherry, OJ, etc etc. This sauce is the same idea--throw in several pre-made sauces (that all have healthy doses of preservatives, dyes, salt, and corn syrup) and you're bound to get a melange with no subtlety but at least it hits the high notes (that would be salty and sweet).

This is simply to die for. The sauce is so good, the next time I made it just for sliced roasted pork loin. My mom was visiting from the mainland and I thought she was going to lick the plate. Sauce is delicious on rice. Will make this over and over. Also, to the lady who used plum jam - plum sauce is made with salted Asian plums. It is totally different than jam. Try it next time with the right ingredients and you'll notice the difference.

Excellent recipe, especially for large dinner parties. Next time I may double the sauce recipe and use some of the sauce to marinate the pork before pan-frying. Served it with a sweet potato puree with sauteed leeks, ginger, and an asian-style green bean salad. It was all very delicious!

Rating: 4
Definitely a "taste sensation"! I made this per the exact recipe but doubled the sauce as another reviewers suggested. No need to do that. A little pool of sauce is all you need since it is so packed with flavor! Use unsalted pistachios because you don't need the extra salt. Side dish should be something on the bland side so as not to overwhelm the palate. I served with Mashed potatoes and Parsnips with Caramelized Onions. Substituted coconut milk in place of regular to give it an asian slant. Second side of steamed haricot verts simply sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. Sauce would work with turkey tenderloin or chicken as well.

This was a wonderful dish!! The pork was sooo tender and went really well with the plum sauce. I made the plum sauce the night before, just so the flavours had chance to mingle. Everyone was asking for more! Definately try the fried leeks, they where delicious. I served mine atop mashed sweet potatoe / desire potatoe, mixed with sour cream and wasabi, along with butter/peppered veggies. A great dish to impress your dinner party guests!!!

I was almost going to pass on this one. Very glad that I didn't. Pork was extremely tender and the sauce was great. I skipped the leeks, and served it over plain white Asian rice with chopped scallions stirred in. Doubling the sauce wouldn't be a bad idea it you like enough sauce to cover the rice. Definately a keeper.

Excellent! I used homemade plum jam instead of plum sauce, didn't bother with the fried leeks (topped w/finely chopped scallions instead), omitted the butter in the sauce, and substituted finely ground breadcrumbs for nuts (to cut down on the fat a little). A great, different recipe: juicy chops in a spicy sauce with an Asian flair.
