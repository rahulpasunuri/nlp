A little too heavy on the vinegary/pickly side of taste. Needs something more and probably something less. Will not make again.

Great flavor! Didn't have umeboshi on hand, so I used ume plum vinegar and chirashi rice mix with sugar snap peas. Ummm. I'm sure it is even better with the umeboshi inside. Can't wait to try it again. Great for a summer side or light meal.
