This was exceptional. I froze it directly in Martini glasses and frosted the edges. Much better than cutting up into cubes, I think. A definite make and make again

This was unusual, refreshing and loved by all. I used clear rum because that's what I had. I didn't read the recipe until I was about to make it and only then realized that you simmer all the alcohol off -- so no kick but a great flavor!

This is quick and easy and just a little exotic. I made a double batch for a picnic and they were gone in 20 minutes.
