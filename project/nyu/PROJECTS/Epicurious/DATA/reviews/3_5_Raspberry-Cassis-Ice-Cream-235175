I made two batches of raspberry ice cream at the same time and ran a taste test at a very large gathering. This was the recipe that did not win the contest even though it won on texture. The other recipe that I used for making raspberry ice cream was the blueberry ice cream, Gourmet, Aug. 1997. It had an icier texture but much has a more intense flavor. It has a much greater proportion of berries to dairy. So the next time I make THIS recipe I'll use about 18 oz. of frozen raspberries. When I make the blueberry ice cream with fresh blueberries I also increase the amount of berries by a little less than a cup plus I add 1 Tbsp of vodka and I do not strain. For my raspberry version I added cassis instead of vodka but I recommend straining out the seeds.

A note to anyone who has left over cassis. My family has found that a good sized splash in just about any cobbler adds some real flavor (with a kick) no matter if you like biscut or crumble topping. Its worked with peach, apple, raspberry and blackberry deserts ! Its very flavorful and versitile stuff. Also, apple jack works but has a favor more specific to its fruit.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe!! Very creamy and full of flavor. I did like it best served soft-serve--but still very good after frozen.

After making the recipe twice (1st time I accidently overcooked the custard, ended up using a double boiler method that Alton Brown suggests), I didn't understand the flavoring of the crème de cassis. You don't even taste the flavoring, waste of $$ and now I have to figure out what to do with this huge bottle. The creamy texture never came out unless it warmed up to practically room temp on the counter. Overall, I've have better ice cream and won't be making this one again. A side note, mine didn't even look like the posted picture. It was a disappointment for me.

This is the first ice cream I have made that froze as solid as a rock to the point where I had trouble scooping it out. I also could detect little of the raspberry taste. This was a waste of money, particularly of the creme de cassis and the Madagascar vanilla. There are much better recipes out there. A couple of weeks ago I made a raspberry sherbet that positively sang with flavour. This is it's much poorer cousin.

This was very good but it needs that fresh raspberry swirl that they recommend in the description. I couldn't find creme de cassis so I used framboise (raspberry liqueur).

The ice cream turned out creamy and had a nice balance of sweetness. I replaced the raspberries with blackberries, since my husband loves blackberries and turned out awesome.
