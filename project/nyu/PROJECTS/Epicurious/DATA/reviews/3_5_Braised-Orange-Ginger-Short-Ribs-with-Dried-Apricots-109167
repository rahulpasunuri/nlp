Thought this was great, although I did tweak it a little. I browned the ribs first. When I squeezed my 4 oranges there was only 1 cup of juice so I added a little chicken broth. I also added a big squirt of Siracha to the sauce. My husband loved it.

This was my first attempt to make short ribs so I will say I am a novice. For that reason I followed this recipe exactly. After 3+ patient hours I ensded up with incredibly fatty, not that tender meat. Would have been helpful for the recipe to have recommended searing first. I ended up with a sauce that is very rich- with many of my favorite flavors- and gross fatty chunks with a tiny bit of meat. I thought the idea of braising was to melt out all the fat, leaving behind just the meat. So I either had to cook longer or hotter or both, but the recipe gave this novice very little guidance there. Very disappointed.

Always sear your meat. Essential step for braising. Certainly will enhance this recipe.

I made this for a crowd and found that I needed more braising liquid so...I added a couple of bottles of good beer. Delicious result. Tossed in more apricots toward the end for good measure.

i forgot to add that i seared the ribs in a bit of olive oil first then braised on stove top. i also added the apricots later in the cooking process.

We enjoyed this recipe for a change but we prefer the shortribs with chipotle. this recipe has a delicious but very intense flavor. i substituted tangerine rind and some tangerine juice for the orange as i didnt want it too sweet but in the end added about 2 teaspoons of honey as it was a bit tart. i might use less tomato paste or use tomato sauce instead of paste in the future.i served it with a couscous pilaf to good reviews. try it!

This recipe is very nice using lamb shanks instead of the short ribs (4 small shanks, about 1 pd each)). Brown shanks first; bake in 350 oven (covered) for 2.5 to 3 hours, turning occasionally. Do not add apricots until the last hour. Skim fat gand serve -- no need to refrigerate first because the lamb is not as greasy as the short ribs.

When this recipe was first published I made it several times--exactly as directed, which is rare for me. (Spooning off the fat is essential!) We love it! I am planning to make it again for a dinner party and have a question before I do. Here is the problem. When the dried apricots are added when the recipe suggests and cook for 3 hours, they completely cook down and you would never know they were there. The recipe says to "transfer ribs and apricots to large platter", but there are no apricots to transfer. The photo in the magazine clearly shows them and it is such a nice presentation. Any suggestions? Should I add them later in the cooking process? Maybe the last hour? Or, since I am rewarming them, should I add more apricots then. I hope someone out there is still reading posts for this recipe and can lend advice. This recipe is really a winner and I want to make it even better. Thank you!

This dish has pleased even my in laws! Definately trim the ribs down and serve it with a big, dry cabernet. We have increased the ginger and backed off the OJ a little.

My sister and I have made this dish many times and we love it - you do have to like oranges, though as the flavour is quite pronounced in this dish. I also defat the ribs as much as possible before using them. I found it great for entertaining by preparing it the night before, then putting it into the fridge to get the fat to solidify, then scraping all the excess fat away before reheating. Everyone who's tried it, loves this dish!

My friend made this recipe a month ago and it stayed in my memory so well that I had to go online and find it. Well worth the search. My family LOVED it. Browning the ribs first adds to the flavor.

Wow. This is the first dish from this website that I thought was awful. And I love sweet w/savory as much as the next guy. Flavors blended very poorly. I'm so glad I only made 1/2 of the receipe and that the meat was on sale.

Simply delicious and very easy to prepare! I have made this dish several times for family and friends and they just love it. Must definitely give it a try!

I and my dinner guests thought this was just delicious and SOO easy. Couple of tips: I used orange juice (not from concentrate) instead of squeezing the oranges. Also, I suggest making it the night before and refigerating the ribs and sauce separately for easier degreasing the next morning (and there was lots of fat to remove, so much better to make it the night before). Enjoy!

Too sweet and too much citrus. The critics asked me not to make it again. Maybe cut out most of the orange juice.

I thought this was really good. I served it with couscous. De-fatting is a good idea if you're using short ribs.

Wow, such differences of opinion we have. I'm definitely in the LOVE IT camp, having made a hit with it last January on a winter get-away weekend with friends. It was one of the first dishes I thought to make for our simple Christmas Eve dinner party because it's so delicious, great to make in advance, and the meat does fall right off the bone. I appreciate the tips on degreasing. I think I'll make a second batch to take along to my parents house the day after.

Nasty, nasty, nasty. This did not live up to its reviews. Yes, the meat was tender, but the sauce tasted too much of citrus. The overwhelming taste was that of orange juice with not even a hint of the other ingredients. Save yourself a lot of time and effort and find another recipe.

Wonderful flavor! I used beef stew meat and decreased the cooking time. I look forward to making this dish again!

I made this recipe tonight and thought it was absolutely delicious! I looked for the very leanest beef short ribs I could find which is not always easy and I did use the fresh orange juice and did the recipe as written. I'm not sure what is do difficult about grating orange rind with the wonder tools available to do so. I made half of the recipe since there were just the two of us and had meat and sauce left over. I did not have to reduce the sauce after I took the ribs out--just needed to degrease.

This recipe is excellent! I use boneless short ribs and find them to be very flavorful. However, I would recommend browning the ribs before adding them to the sauce. Also, with short ribs the longer you cook them at a lower heat the more tender they will get.

Boy was I disappointed. All that work grating the orange peal, juicing the oranges, etc....and for what? The sauce was good but the meat was blah. I even used the highest grade short ribs available. If you do make this use something other than short ribs. What a waste of time AND money!!!

Sauce was really good, but I guess I just don't like short ribs. Would try it again with beef stew meat.

Do not despair. The key to this recipe is the following: Use the freshest, juiciest oranges/tangerines possible. After the suggested cooking time you must degrease the broth, remove all the solids with a slotted spoon and reduce the you know what out of it. This will drastically intensify the flavor. Once it is at a likeable consistency, add a shot of bourbon, return meat and solids to pot and dig in.

I thought this recipe was awful. Perhaps I just don't like that style of ribs, but even my husband, who eats anything refused to eat them. I would try Nigella's ribs from Forever Summer instead.

This was very flavorful. Next time I might consider using beef stew meat instead, as the short ribs I found were a little too fatty and not as meaty as I would like.

I did not make this, but my sister-in-law did while I was visiting in Connecticut. She served it with cous-cous, and steamed broccoli. It was delicious! Try it. Not Asian particularly, which I was expecting from the ingredients. Delightfully fruity rich sauce. A very good winter/cold weather/comfort meal!
