Having read the other reviews, I skipped the greens, and added crumbled bleu cheese just before serving. It was a hit, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat.

Good dressing, but a dull salad. We thought that if we just added the beets to a regular salad and used the dressing it would probably be a lot better.

Baby beets from my garden, baby lettuces from my garden, oranges from my garden...after reading the other reviews I expected this to be terrific but we were all disappointed. It isn't bad, just not worth wasting any more of our produce to make again.

Yummy! This dressing goes incredibly well with beets. We'll make this one over and over.

Beets were delicious with the dressing. Next time I will skip the greens altogether.

Very good recipe. I used a variety of salad greens and pretty much followed the recipe. Very easy to prepare and delicious to eat.
