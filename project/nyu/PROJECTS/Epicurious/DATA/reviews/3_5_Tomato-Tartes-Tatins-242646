Amazing. I've also tried doing these filled with slow-roasted tomatoes from epicurious and it's very, very good too. Incredible side dish.

These were quite tasty! I snuck a slice of fresh mozzarella cheese and some fresh basil on top of the tomatoes before putting on the puff pastry for the final bake. Not a bite left!
