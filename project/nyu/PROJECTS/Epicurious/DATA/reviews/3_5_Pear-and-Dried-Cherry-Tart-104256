I have been making this tart for special dinners since 2007, because the shell and the filling can be made the day before and because our guests keep requesting it! I prefer Bosc pears, but Bartletts are fine too. I do not fill the tart all the way to the rim with the filling juice, in an attempt to keep it from overflowing onto the baking sheet underneath. I use a 10.5" tart pan, and only 6-7 large pears. The crust made with frozen butter and cake flour is excellent, but I find the recipe as written makes too much dough, so I usually make only 2/3 of the crust recipe.

Made this recipe in 2000 for Thanksgiving and loved it...so did everyone else. It's not only delicious and well-received it also makes a great presentation. The crust is a little labor-intensive but I don't use any other recipe since I discovered this one. Crust that is light and flaky has always been my goal and this recipe assures I meet it every time! I'm going to make it again for Christmas and plan on putting cut-out Christmas trees on top instead of the leaves. It's such a glorious burgandy/cranberry-ish color that I think it will do very nicely for Christmas, too! Thank you Gourmet magazine for a true winner!

I loved this recipe. Unlike most reviewers, I found the grating of the frozen butter to be time saving and ingenious. My crust turned out great looking and great tasting. I heeded the warnings of it not being sweet, and added a little brown sugar and about 2 tsps of vanilla, which was quite tasty!

I really loiked this but, like the previous reviewer, the first time I made it the dough prep was a bit much for an otherwise simple tart. I used an 18-ounce roll of sugar cookie dough in its place and it was delicious and ridiculously easy (not to mention as good or better). Followed the guidelines from the COOKIE DOUGH DELIGHTS cookbook for making the refrigerated dough crust. Try it!

The rosemary was nice but this tart was a big disappointment. I thought the crust was way too time consuming (grating frozen butter? no thanks)and would highly advise using a traditonal pastry crust recipe with this filling. Mine came out very gummy. Next please!!!

Wow! This was the prettiest thing I've ever made - I couldn't believe it came out of my own oven! I should have taken a picture! That being said, I made two of these tarts for different Thanksgiving functions and since I didn't have alot of time, I used store bought pie crust, so I can't really comment on the crust. The filling is NOT SWEET, but that is a good thing for some folks like me who get tired of all of the sweet desserts. Both tarts were "gobbled up" by the "I'm sick of sweet stuff" people. The pear and cherry filling, when cooked, turned into this beautiful fall colored stuff, but like I said, NOT SWEET.

Count me into the "I was disappointed" category. I had high expectations of this dessert based on the glowing remarks and 4-fork ratings, but I made it for Thanksgiving and didn't care for it much at all. The combination of fruits is just "so so" at best and the rosemary gives it an "off," un-dessert-like taste. Plus it was a lot of work to boot. Bleh. I was, however, very happy with the crust recipe and I'll be using that one again. Oh well, 1 out of 2 ain't bad I guess.

This was good but I didn't love it. I made it for Thanksgiving but was a little disappointed since the other reviewers loved it. I did like the crust. It was easy to work with and a snap to make.

I give this two thumbs up although it was more like a pie than a tart. I did up the sugar content as my pears were not totally ripe and I used imported jarred cherries insted of dried. The crust was perfect! Moist inside and crunchy, crispy outside...Delicious!!! Rosemary? WOW!! This goes in my permanent file.

The crust was wonderful, and the flavor combination is inspired. I get requests for this one now...

This is a terrific tart. The rosemary is a pleasant surprise and goes well with the cherries. The easy presentation of this dessert makes it a great one for pot lucks or picnics. I suggest a different pastry dough, however, as the frozen butter proved to be a bit tough for me - even after trying it twice. I had better luck with the all-butter pastry dough on this site.

Interesting combination of flavors and the hand-made crust with grated frozen butter was delicious and perfectly flakey and moist. The rosemary was a nice touch which I would never have thought would go with fruit but it paired nicely. I would definitley add MORE brown sugar, not less! The top leaf crust looks very impressive and is totally easy.

This is a dessert that lingers on long after the dish is empty. A wonderful combination of fruit and a pastry crust to die for. I might be tempted to reduce the brown sugar by half the next time I make this. I used bartlett pears and followed the recipe exactly. I had never made a pie or pastry crust in this manner before. Using a grater on frozen butter is much easier than cutting the butter into small pieces. It is imperative that you use a generous amount of flour on the surface that you roll the pastry dough out on. Our guests raved about the dessert and the small amount that was left disappeared shortly after they walked out the door.
