The flavors in this recipe were perfect for our Valentine's dinner but it was just way too much food. Instead, I cooked single lamb chops in the skillet for 10-12 min. The crust didn't stick on as beautifully as it does with the full rack, but still delicious! The filling was amazing -- we even used it for crostinis as an appetizer. I strongly dislike bell peppers so left out the sauce and added carmelized onions & seared tomatoes instead.

Of the few hundred recipes I've made so far from Epicurious / Bon Appetit, this is by far my favorite. It certainly not a quick and easy recipe, but well worth every minute of effort and then some. This has become my go-to special occasion recipe; I'm making it again for Christmas this year.

I was looking for an interesting and somewhat challenging rack of lamb recipe and this is it in spades! Not only was it fun to cook but it had so many delicious layers of flavors. My family loved it! Several members of my family have since made this recipe with delicious results.

Here's a leftover tip (if you have any leftovers): I made this with roasted corn cilantro chipotle mashed potatoes as recommended (a recipe I found here http://www.recipezaar.com/tex-mex- beef-pot-roast-with-corn-chipotle- cilantro-mashed-potato-384676). The next day, I mixed the leftover lamb with leftover potatoes, added a few more sundried tomatoes, stuffed them into corn tortillas, and fried as taquitos. Drizzled with lime juice and dipped in more chipotle sauce. Amazing.

Best Lamb recipe on this site. A ton of work but worth every second. My husband made for our anniversary dinner and it was spectacular!

Excellent! The filling was really good, but not necessary...I would cut this part out to reduce time. Also, I would reduce the temperature on the oven.

This was great. The pumpkin seeds made such an interesting topping to the lamb. As other people have mentioned, it does consume some time, but it's a simple meal to prepare. Great recipe!!

Truly fantastic. Very much a special occasion dish but worth the effort. Lots of prep, especially to trim the racks, but it can all be done ahead. We loved the variety of flavors and they looked completely professional. Great dish.

This is certainly one of the best recipes on this site. I had made the sauce, stuffing, and crust in advance (fortunately), but still had to cut, trim, stuff, and prepare the racks at the last minute (for Christmas dinner), which was time consuming for 4 full racks. Nevertheless, when it was done, the 5 of us swooned with delight. The meat was tender and flavorful, and all the elements fused brilliantly. Well worth the effort, but I'll give myself more time to do the final prep when I make it next time. Definitely a show-stopping company dish of restaurant quality.

THIS IS AWESOME!!! Very easy, a little timely, but not bad. Presentation is beautiful, flavors are delicious. Will definetely make it again and again.

A lot of trouble, but impressive. I'm not sure all the flavors work that well together; the stuffing and sauce are rather strong for lamb. Maybe a different meat would be better suited? My favorite part was the pumpkin-seed crust, which I think I'll experiment with using to top other meats too. Actually, I might use each of the three components (stuffing, sauce, and crust) separately to dress up other dishes. If I ever make this particular recipe again, I'd try it without the sauce (which is tasty, but seems to overpower the other flavors).

This was absolutely fab...some effort, but well worth it. Possibly the best meal I've ever fixed or eaten...the flavors all stand out and blend so well. I cooked the lamb med rare, and it was so tender....yum, yum

I made this for Christmas dinner, and it was fantastic. I love Chipotles, and this sauce will be used again for lots of other things (like pork tenderloin or as a sauce for enchiladas). I doubled the recipe, and ended up with lots of leftover pumpkin seed crust and chipotle sauce. I will find other uses for them, but you wouldn't need to double them if you double the amount of lamb.

I made this last night for a Halloween dinner party. With the sauce and the crust, you really could leave out the stuffing. However, my only suggestion is to make sure the lamb is trimmed well. My butcher didn't do a great job of trimming which left the lamb fatty in parts. Otherwise, it was wonderful! I will definitely make it again.

I made this with lamb fillet, reducing the time accordingly. The filling could have been eliminated, it was tasty but unnecessary. The crust and sauce truly shone! I made the crust with sunflower seeds instead of pumpkin, and it was absolutely delicious. It would probably work well with beef or pork as well.

I have made this a couple of times and both times it was a big hit. The Chipotle Sauce is very tasty (spicy) and is a must. I doubled the recipe (one recipe of the chipotle sauce would have been enough) and it took longer to cook. Next time I will use the convection oven. I served this with a Cooking Light recipe, Sformato 11/01 and Marinated Asparagus Bundles from Mastercook. A great menu.

Made this for Christmas and got rave reviews from everyone including my VERY finicky 7-year-old. In fact he made sure I came back to rate this a 4-fork. I had to add a bit of salt to the sauce, and made a non-spicy and a spicy version. It was pretty easy considering the impressive results. The cooking time was right-on. I got most of the ingredients from Trader Joe's.

I made this recipe for my family for Easter dinner and we just loved it. I intend to try it with other meats too, like pork, chicken or fish. I think the combination of ingredients was just right and it could be adapted to other meats or fish. I prepared mashed potatoes with corn and cilantro as the recipe suggested and it was fabulous with it.

This lamb was a real hit! I have been getting requests to make again on a regular basis, and it is almost simple enough to make for an every day meal (but you wouldn't want to waste it on that!)

This is a great recipe. We made it for friends and everyone raved about it. A very interesting combination of flavors.
