These are great! I know some people are worried about the egg whites but they are so much fluffier than the recipes without. I usually make these at Christmas so I add 1/2 tsp. peppermint extract and a few drops of red food coloring for awesome peppermint marshmallows. They are a huge hit for gifts every year.

I've been making these marshmallows for years and suddenly have encountered problems. All of sudden, they are so sticky I can barely get them out of the bowl. Am I heating the sugar mixture too high? Am I whipping the mixture too long? Also, I add flavored extracts (peppermint and orange mostly)...is there too much alcohol is the extracts? It's maddening...all of a sudden I have taffy instead of marshmallows. Help, please!

BTW, the substitute for corn syrup in this recipe is one cup sugar and 1/4 cup water.

These marshmallows got rave reviews! My husband omitted the corn syrup (I have a corn allergy) and used organic sugar and confectioners sugar that was cornstarch free! Delicious! We used them for s'mores at a beach bonfire for my birthday. So good. They melt quicker but brown so well over the fire. K

Great idea for Valentine's, since you can dye or cut them in shapes. This was an easy recipe and the result is so much better than the store-bought variety.

This recipe is great! I made it the way I learned in the restaurant. I whipped the egg whites and then cooked the sugar recipe, when the sugar was hot I added the gelatin then streamed it into the egg whites while beating with a hand mixer. I beat the entire mixture for 15 minutes. It took a while to firm up but it did and it was great. I dyed them pink then piped them into little circles and they're really cute.

The taste was amazing, but as someone with only one bowl for my mixer, the mess this made was amazing. I'm told that one can also make marshmallows similarly to italian buttercream, slowly pouring the sugar syrup into the whipped egg whites, which would be better for those without an extra bowl.

These are great! I've made many marshmallows, from an all gelatin recipe a combo of whites and gelatin beaten together, but this one is the best. It's wonderfully soft and fluffy. I added the scrapings from a vanilla bean, and I make a mixture of potato starch and powdered sugar to toss them in. It helps keep them dry since the powdered sugar gets sticky. I cut them with a pizza wheel sprayed with cooking spray and they didn't stick at all. They were great with my hot chocolate mix, and I'm looking forward to trying them in rocky road and maybe brownies.

I took these marshmallows to a bonfire and the kids and parents alike loved them! They roast over a fire so beautifully and melt perfectly in a cup of hot cocoa. I don't have a stand mixer, so I agree that it was difficult, but worth it! I don't think I'll be able to stand store bought marshmallows again...

Rating: 4
Well I tried this again but borrowed a stand mixer and it made all the difference in the world. It was so easy and less frustrating. Mixing them the full 6 minutes definitely made them MUCH fluffier. Also, I froze them immediately, which made them a cinch to cut with a knife or roller dipped in hot water. Then, when I dipped them in melted chocolate, they cooled quickly, didn't melt or get sticky, and I put them back in the freezer (with wax paper) until I'm ready to distribute for my holiday gift bags. One other tip: don't be stingy with the powdered sugar. I tossed them with it constantly and they are not sticky at all and easy to handle.

Rating: 3
Well this was interesting and very sticky. I don't have a stand mixer so I used a hand mixer, and like others mentioned, it was difficult. I took the advice and mixed in a deep pot, which I am certain helped with the mess, but it was a little awkward as the blender doesn't really fit inside well. The goo kept climbing up the blades and I had to stop to let it drop back down. After about 4-5 minutes it was useless to keep mixing, I was getting nowhere so I stopped and mixed in the egg whites and continued as instructed. I think they turned out ok, but I wonder if I was able to mix them longer if they would be fluffier and less sticky. I cut them with a scissors, which worked out ok as long as I was elbow deep in powdered sugar. I think without a stand mixer, it isn't possible to whip them for 10 minutes.

I made these exactly according to the instructions but added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla instead of 1 tsp. The marshmallows are fluffy, soft, and delicious! They've been well-recieved at work. I added them to a cup of hot chocolate and they melted perfectly! I'll be using the recipe to make marshmallows to give as gifts with hot chocolate.

Easy and delish. The kids love them, especially if I dip the edges in colored sugar. I've tried raspberry, orange and coffee flavorings...yum!

Wonderful results! Very, very simple to make. My suggestion would be as one reviewer did, to beat egg whites BEFORE sugar mixture, so mixture won't be cooling while beaters are cleaned and eggs are whipped. Then, when your 6 minutes of beating in the stand mixer (5 in my case) are done, you can just add the egg whites right away. It does set quickly so this would make pouring into pan easier since it would be warmer when you poured. My marshmellow cubes will be used in a chocolate fondue fountain ...with graham cracker crumbs to roll into after they are covered in chocolate. The Melting Pot restaurant has graham-cracker covered marshmallows for their chocolate fondue and they're mouth-watering delicious! For the fountain, the crumbs tend to clog the flow, so they'll roll in crumbs after being smothered in the flowing dark chocolate...yummmmm! !

This was a wonderful recipe for homemade marshmallows. I found a pizza cutter to be very useful to cut the marshmallows into strips, and then a pastry scraper to cut into squares. I tossed them into a tuperware with confectioner sugar, then into a wire mesh strainer to shake off the excess. Placed on a drying rack to "air- cure" before packing in cellophane gift bags. Worked out great!! Delicious in hot coco or on top of baked sweet potatoes. You'll never go back to packaged marshmallows again!

Ok it took me like 4 times and some real thinking to why I couldnt get this very easy recipe to work. Then it dawned on me!! You cannot I repeat cannot just use any old unflavored gelatin. I used some I bought from the kosher store thinking its just gelatin. NOPE WRONG!! I defintly suggest to use KNOX unflavored gelatin only!!! And yes other then that this was a very simple and fun recipe my son loved it and the clean up with a little hot water was a breeze!! Defintly plan on making this more often!! And you dont have to use hot water for the other part of the recipe I used cold water though out and came out just as good. Plan on trying it with other flavors and colors!!

I have a question about the gelatin. I made this, and the results are so-so. I think I may have used too much gelatin. 3 1/2 envelopes is more than 2T + 2 1/2t. Each envelope has 1T+ in it. So, which is it? Thanks for your help...

Rating: 4
Having made this recipe dozens of times, I used many of the suggestions from readers. Stand mixer, pizza cutter/scissors, peppermint, lemon (w/crushed lemon heads), ghiradelli chocolate, will try lime next. I whip them for 5 minutes so they dont set up so quickly and give me time to pour. I lay down a sheet of parchment, spray it then use half powder sugar and half cornstarch so when you roll them in powder its not so sweet. I use my cookie stone to lay them out in. everyone has always loved this recipe and the chocolate ones I made yesterday were a hit!

I always chill the marshmallows in the fridge, and they don't become rubbery. I suspect the reviewer who ended up with rubbery marshmallows may have added too much gelatin. I've improvized with the following: For key lime marshmallows add 2T and 1t key lime juice (from the bottle's fine) when the vanilla is added (they turn out a bit wet even after refrigerated, but they always disappear quickly). Use food coloring too. For peppermint marshmallows add 3/4t (taste though to make sure it doesn't need more) peppermint extract and red food coloring w/the vanilla. Check out www.plushpuffs.com for flavor inspiration.

The directions were fine until I came to the line "Chill marshmallow", which to me means refrigerate. Of course, I ended up with very rubbery marshmallows. Perhaps the author would consider rephrasing this line to: "Allow marshmallows to cool uncovered" and add a warning about what happens when they are refrigerated.

Excellent stuff! The flavoring recommendations are well worth noting and I'll add my own: once the 'mallows are set, when you slice them into sections slice the top bit off so they're all nice and sticky all the way around - then roll them in toasted coconut. *drool*

These were so much fun to make and give as gifts (and to eat!). I managed with a hand mixer no problem, cut with pizza cutter, flavored one batch with peppermint (colored light pink) and one with espresso powder.

Wow..I have never made marshmallows before, but these turned out great! Instead of the vanilla I added 2 tsp's of orange oil flavoring. The kind you use to flavor chocolate...YUM! These oils come in lot's of different flavors so you could get really creative. I'm going to dip my marshmallow with chocolate for the holidays. I used a hand mixer and the mixture was pretty sticky that my hand mixer nearly overheated. I agree with another reviewer to use a stand mixer...more heavy duty than the small mixer. Give these a try!!

These are relatively easy to make and turned out very well. I guessed as to when the sugar mixture was to the soft ball point because I only had a small thermometer instead of a candy one, but they turned out well.

I serve them with hot chocolate and graham crackers dipped in white chocolate. Yum!

Sticky and messy, but worth it... we have an actual homemade marshmallow store (!)nearby that sells these for $1.50 each, but this recipe tastes even better. I added 20 drops of yellow food coloring to the water/gelatin mixture to get an even light yellow. A tip -- work quickly getting it into the pan. It was hard to get most of the stuff out of the bowl and into the pan as it started setting up pretty quickly, but the end result was delicious, with a better texture and taste than other homemade marshmallows I have tried.

I did NOT use a standing mixer, I think I botched the measurments a bit, I didn't let them cool long enough (too impatient) and they STILL turned out AMAZING! Very light and fluffy, cute and delicious. I added a dash of cinnamon and a drop of red food coloring, then cut out with a heart cookie cutter (for V-Day), THEN dipped 'em in chocolate. I was astonished that they turned out so well! You gotta try it.

I found these extremely easy to make. I made them per the recipe, except substituted lemon juice for cold water and added some lemon zest to the syrup, resulting in lemon marshmallows. I used cookie cutters to cut out into snowflake shapes, which worked pretty well, but because of the thickness looked a little odd. Overall, very sweet and yummy, and very light and airy, but not so amazing that I will make really often. I will experiment with different flavors to see if there are some that rock my world, so will make again, but this will most likely only be a couple times a year recipe.

I made the marshmallows after eating one from Williams-Sonoma and these are just as good if not better! I added a couple extra teaspoons of vanilla also. The only thing I may change next time is possibly adding a little cornstarch to the powdered sugar so they won't be so sweet. Using a pizza cutter and a standing mixer is the "secret".

I'll weigh in on the marshmallow conversation . . . these are great. I make 1.5x recipe and pour it into a jelly roll pan lined with oiled & confectioner's-sugared parchment. Makes the release really easy. When I pour it in, I don my surgical gloves, oil my "hands" (the gloves) and pat it evenly into the pan. It makes the process very easy to clean up from, and so much less sticky. YOu can also flavor these with other extracts (peppermint w/ a teeny bit of red/pink food coloring, coffee extract, cinnamon, anything you can think of that would go well with hot chocolate). Finally, I package these up and give to teachers at christmas, along with a jar of homemade cocoa mix (another recipe - uses chocolate, cocoa, vanilla beans, etc.) with instructions for home preparation. Makes a nice gift to give with the otherwise impersonal gift certificate . . .

These were super easy to make, and clean up was a snap. I used 3 tsps of vanilla as suggested by others. I also didn't have a candy thermometer so I used a meat thermometer and heated the mixture until it reached the top of the meat thermometer and then heated the mixture for about 5 minutes more, until it came to a rolling boil. I used a hand held mixer, and beat the mixture in a deep soup pot so I didn't have a mess of white fluff. These turned out great, and I crushed peppermint candies and sprinkled them on top...great treat for christmas with a cup of hot cocoa!

So easy... They actually keep about two weeks; they'll dry out a little on the outside but still melt wonderfully in cocoa. To recap what some other posters suggested to make this easier: 1. Use a standing blender 2. Add extra vanilla 3. Cut with a pizza cutter 4. Soak/clean dishes right away

Great recipe; I think I'll add a little food coloring and maybe some other flavor extracts in future batches for a little diversity. One thing's for sure though... you need to work fast to get the marshmallow mixture from the mixing bowl to the flat dish... the more it cools, the faster the blob becomes a stringy sticky mess.

This is the first time I tried to make marshmallows, and it was a great success! A very easy recipe to follow. I used a pasteurized egg white product. Also, as soon as you finish with the pot and bowl fill them with hot water and the goopy stuff comes right out. As I was mixing the mixture did creep up the beaters a little, when it does that it means you are done mixing! I dipped the marshmallows in dark chocolate and then in graham cracker crumbs. Beautiful and delicious!

Delicious and fun to make! Use standing mixer for whipping the sugar mixture & hand mixer for egg whites. Otherwise, you lose alot of the sugar mixture trying to scrape it out of the bowl. (It's very gooey!). More vanilla, or other flavoring is good advise. Also, a pizza cutter is a must!! The reviewer who said that 'using the right tools can make the difference between a great experience & a nightmare' was spot on. These marshmallows are very good & fun to make!

Looking for the right marshmallows to make homemade rocky road, I did a taste test with this recipe and another from Martha Stewart that used similar proportions but no egg whites. These are foamier and lighter, much nicer for eating on their own (and the winner as far as rocky road goes), but the recipe without egg whites was MUCH nicer toasted or melted into cocoa. This was the consensus of the five people I forced to eat both :-)

These were fun to make. The white is so pristine when they've been beaten to their full volume. I did add a full tablespoon of vanilla at the recomemendation of other posters, however, I feel that is too much for marshmallows because they are mostly just sweet without other flavors. Plus, too much vanilla makes them not pure, brilliant white. I used real vanilla, by the way. I would stick to a teaspoon or maybe two. I also used a glass pan, which worked fine. I tried to dip some in chocolate by melting chocolate chips in the microwave. This was not very effective. Next time I'll try a double boiler on the stove.

This was an absolutely perfect recipe. I am a Pastry chef and check out most recipes before trying. This was a snap. Agree that more vanilla is needed. MUST have stand mixer. Do NOT need oil on pan if you dust pan with plenty of 10X sugar. Slice w/hot dry knife. Toss in a bag of confectioners sugar(10X) or pulvarized color sugar crystals.

Rating: 4
I, too, was trying to reproduce the Williams-Sonoma $1.20-per-piece marshmallows, and I was not disappointed. The good thing about the recipe is that, although it has several discrete steps, no individual step is difficult and you get breathing space in between (put the pan on the stove, do something else for 12 minutes, turn the mixer on, do something else for 6 minutes, etc.) The tips from the previous reviews were golden - the right equipment (heavy duty mixer, thermometer and pizza cutter) are the difference between fun and a migraine. Three questions for those who have experimented: (1)If you use other flavorings (peppermint, lemon, etc.)do you use these instead of, or in addition to, the vanilla? (2)How much extract do you use? (3) If you've colored the marshmallows, when did you put the color in? I added gel color to one batch when I added the egg whites and vanilla, but felt I had to beat the stuff too much to get the color mixed in and still ended up with "marbleized" marshmallows rather than an even pastel.

I made these last night since a big snow storm was a-coming...easy, easy, easy to make. I made them while gabbing on the phone with my neighbor. I too used the handheld for the marshmallow mixture and my handheld (at the same time) for the egg whites. I was a little concerned about getting them out of the pan this morning, since I used a glass Pyrex pan...but no problem. Honestly, everything about this is easy..the kids love to help and I'm going to coat some in chocolate later today. Now I'm off to make hot chocolate for the husband who's out shoveling....

The marshmallows are alright. I imagine that children would really enjoy them. The recipe itself isn't difficult but it requires a heavy-duty mixer. I didn't know this when I began and in the process of beating the mixture the motor burned out. (It wasn't a cheap or old mixer, either.) Certainly, I would have to say that these marshmallows are not worth the cost of a new mixer! But I wouldn't make these again even if it hadn't "killed" my mixer.

Absolutely phenomenal! Almost impossible to screw this up, yet the results make you look like a master chef. I've made these with various extracts (peppermint, hazelnut, orange, vanilla) and it's always been fantastic.

The first time I made this I mis-read the directions; didn't whip the sugar mixture long enough... corrected the second time!

So much fun! I made these to package with homemade hot cocoa mix for holiday gifts and I may end up eating them all myself! I made one batch as written and one to which I added peppermint extract and some red food coloring. Tried them in cocoa myself last night and also toasted a couple. Worked well with both applications. I will be dipping them in chocolate soon to suprise my Grandma (choc-covered MMs are her fave) and I know these will beat Fannie May! Will make again and again trying new flavors.

This is great! I did this as a snowy day project with the kids, and they loved it. I used 2 tsp vanilla plus 1 tsp almond extract and rolled the cubes in sweet cocoa, using a ziploc bag. Very neat and so much better than Kraft Jet-Puffed! Like other reviewers, I used my KitchenAid for the sugar syrup, and my hand-held for the egg whites, and then soaked everything in hot water. Not a big deal to clean up, just a few extra bowls. These will be very nice in holiday gift baskets, put into pretty bags next to some homemade cocoa mix.

These are soooo good and quite easy to make. (Very fun too!) I had no problems with the mixing, just let my standing mixer do the job. I think a candy thermomter is a must, because it seemed a long time to reach 260 degrees, and if I had not been measuring, I would have took it off much sooner. These were perfect to roast. And we roasted them over sterno with wooden skewers! Yum! Next time, I would like to try the fondue idea.

I also had the marshmallow take on a life of its own- thought I was going to lose the mixer! But it was SO worth the worry! They were excellent and they were wonderful in hot chocolate. I worried about the hardened sugar all for nothing. Warm water soak and clean up was a breeze. I also used 3 Tbsp vanilla. We will be making these again this weekend. My kids (4 and 6) rolled them around in the powdered sugar. What is it about kids and powdered sugar?

Just Awesome! I was intrigued by the notion of making 'home-made' marshmallows and it has paid off. Gave them as a Valentine's Day gifts and served it to my husband with a chocolate fondue.

I also dusted these with cinnamon and powdered sugar for a nice change. Great in hot chocolate and for roasting by the fireplace.

What fun! I made these last night and cut them up this morning. I followed the advice of another commenter and put in 3 tsp. of vanilla instead of just one -- what a difference. Someone was asking for ideas on how to make them chocolate flavored: I mixed confectioner's sugar, Ghirardelli sweet ground chocolate and cocoa, and Ghirardelli chocolate mocha hot chocolate -- these are hot cocoas that you mix into HOT MILK -- a nice subtle chocolate flavor. Next time I may mix sugar, unsweetened cocoa and instant espresso powder. I think that would be a bit more intense. Christmas is going to be fun this year!

Fun and fabulous! I could believe that marshmallows could actually be _exciting_ to eat. The first time I made them, I doubled the recipe (had eggwhites left over from making creme brulee), and had so many left over that I brought them in to work. I thought grownups might scoff at marshmallows... but they were a huge hit, and now I will forever be known as "the woman who makes her own marshmallows". They melt deliciously in cocoa, and are to die for with chocolate fondue. It goes faster if you start the sugar-melting part first and do everything else while you wait on that. As soon as a pan or bowl is emptied, fill with warm water and clean-up is a breeze. I've seen home-made marshmallows for sale in Williams-Sonoma for $1/piece I believe, and I can't believe they can be any better than these!

I had amazing fresh marshmallows in a Montreal shop. They came in cinnamon and lemon flavors. I wanted to try this recipe and flavor the mixture and it worked; they tasted exactly the same. I just added cinnamon to the gelatin mixture to taste before adding the egg and tossed the cut marshmallows in a mixture of powdered sugar and cinnamon. If you substitute lemon extract or oil for vanilla, that might work too, but I would taste the gelatin before making a one-to-one substitution. Excellent!

The marshmallows turned out great. I was surprised at how easy they were to make and cleanup was no trouble. I dipped them in chocolate and everyone loved them. I am making them again today because they are all gone and we have more parties to go.

A bit denser and somewhat heavier than store-bought kinds, but, in my opinion, way better tasting. Make it for the novelty factor, impress your friends. Makes excellent S'mores. Surprisingly simple to make.

Good, but...the gelatin stunk when I mixed the sugar mixture together. Also, my pots were coated in candy after I had finished. The recipe was easy to follow, but the cleanup was far more than I had expected.

I made the marshmallows for Thanksgiving. Everyone thought they were wonderful! They're very light and people kept munching on them all evening. The recipe is very easy to follow and MUCH better than Martha Stewart's version!

These are so delicious! Really superior to buying marshmallows. The second time I made them , I dipped them in chocolate. My family just loved them.
