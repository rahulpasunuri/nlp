Hello all !! I'm sooooooo happy people liked my cheesecake recipe. Its been 11 yrs since I submitted this by mail to BON APPETIT magazine. I STILL make it to this day. Around Thanksgiving I add some pumpkin puree and spices to it. YUMMY :)

A decent cheesecake but nothing spectacular. Not sure why it recieved such high acclaims from other reviewers. The flavour was disappointing and the texture was a bit grainy.

Yummy! I even cooked my praline a bit too long - it was more of a dark brown than golden) but I added a little brown sugar to compensate and it was delicious! Everyone who tried it absolutely loved it! I even had it for breakfast one day!

I really liked this cheesecake. It was very tastely and mild. I gave half of it to my neighbors and they loved it too. This is one of my "keepers".

This cheesecake earned rave reviews from my officemates. I heard comments like "the best cheesecake I ever had!" I thought it was a bit too sweet, but creamy and delicious. The hardest part of preparation was removing the skins from the nuts.

I received rave reviews for this cheesecake! The crust, although not a 'traditional' one, is delicious. It took me two tries for the praline. The sugar really does need to be rinsed down from the sides of the pan with the pastry brush -- if the crystals remain, the praline will sugar.

in response to the reader's comment regarding the recipe being incomplete, you must click on the phrase "hazelnut praline" in the recipe, and that recipe will appear!

Recipe did not give all ingredients for praline filling. Was unable to make due to this.
