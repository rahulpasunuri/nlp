Basically, the only flavor you get is from whatever chili sauce you use. The rice paper rolls are a good vehicle for the veggies, though.

Easy and delicious. Great for using up whatever is in the fridge too. Zipped them up with an extra spicy chutney. A really refreshing summer meal.

I found these to be completely lacking in flavor. Tried spreading a little hoisin on the wrappers, then peanut sauce, but neither did anything to enhance the overall flavor of the rolls. And since I didn't care for the accompanying chili sauce, I won't bother making these again.

I tried this recipe the same night I also tried another Epicurious recipe, Shrimp Spring Rolls. I made this recipe the same night I tried another Epicurious recipe (Thai summer rolls). We loved both of them. The summer rolls are just gorgeous and I'm thrilled to have a great tasting recipe for my vegan friends. Because of time constraints, though, I did not try the Spiced Chili Sauce.

These rolls are delicious and easy. You can be very creative with the ingredients--any combo of veggies works. I also love adding a bit of cheese (feta or goat) for some tang and heartiness.

With the recommended chili sauce, these rolls are very good. Great presentation, healthy & delicious.
