Made this cornbread for a potluck dinner. All sixteen people present really enjoyed it.There was not one negetive comment.And not a crumb was left.

Good, but not great. I did add a little extra buttermilk to solve the "dryness" that a previous reviewer commented on. Even so, I did not get more than polite reviews from the 6 guests I served this to. It was good, but was not as good as I had hoped for. Not sure what was wrong, but I did not get the flavor out of the spring onions and parmesan that I had hoped for.

This was a good but not great corn bread recipe. The green onion and parmesan make it interesting but it was a tad dry.

I really liked this cornbread recipe because it was not as sweet as some others I've tried. The parmesan cheese gave it a really unique flavor that we all enjoyed. Also, the leftovers freeze well and are great with chili.
