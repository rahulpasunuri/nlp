This was a great and simple meal that made Daddy look like a "chef" in my wife and kids eyes. Super Tasty and easy enough for me to make. I would agree that 12 oz is too much on the pasta end. However, I followed everything else to the letter and wound up with a new family favorite! Thanks.

OMG. This was amazing. The flavors of the legumes with the small pasta were perfect. 12 OZ of pasta were a little too much for the rest of the rest of the ingredients. I used only 8-10 ounces and it was wonderful.

We made this for a cozy dinner at home on a cold, rainy night and it was perfect. We used chicken sausage and threw in some mustard greens, which added a spicy kick that complemented the sausage, and some visual interest.

I used Italian chicken sausage from whole foods and twisted looking penne. It looked pretty ugly but it did taste fantastic. Very easy.

We loved this recipe! Although I try to make the recipes as written the first time, this time I wanted to use what I had in the house. I had some pre-cooked garlic sausages so sliced them up and sauteed with the onion. Didn't have red so used white onions. I had red lentils which I believe I cooked too long so they lost their shape. They were pretty much mush but still tasted great in the dish. I used the lentil water instead of the pasta water. It really was just so good, very filling, and great for a wintery spring day.

I can't remember when I have made a recipe that was a first time hit. This was as good as it gets. We don't have to go to our local trattoria--this brings it to us. I used spicy chicken sausage instead of sweet and a lovely Chianti Classico for the wine. Also I topped the dish with sauted rainbow chard with garlic and red pepper flakes. It was a perfect one dish meal. This doesn't happen often that the first attempt is a keeper but I'll serve this at several dinner parties. Thanks so much.

Definitely lacks in visual appeal, but makes up for it in taste and ease of preparation. I'm constantly having to pass this recipe on to friends, family, and coworkers because they all love it!

This recipe is a staple healthy, easy weeknight meal for us...using hot italian turkey sausage. I add a can of diced or pureed tomatoes with the lentils and it balances the flavor better, as well as making the dish more attractive. (otherwise the red wine gives the dish a weird purplish color)

This dish tastes great. As others have also said, it is not pretty to look at. But, it really is delicious-and healthy!

This dish does not look very appealing prepared, but it tastes oh, so good. I followed the recipe, using ingredients from the local grocery store. Next time I will try it with good quality sausage, pasta, and cheese, and I expect it to be out of this world.

Delicious! Fantastic way to get more lentils into my diet!

This has become one of our tasty-but-easy week night meals. I love the texture that the lentils give to this dish. One word of warning is that it doesn't look all that great (lacks in presentation), but it is delicious!

This is a great dish! The flavors and the textures are wonderful together. It's become one of my staples. Easy to make, delicious, easy recipe to halve or double.

This dish really seems to take on the flavor of the sausage- I used one of those sun dried tomato flavored pre-cooked types that has very good flavor, and it really made it good. Its a comforting, not too overwhelming dish.

This recipe was great. I like a little more heat so we used hot sausage & added in a little red pepper flakes. Great! I would make this again.

Delicious! I make this quite often. I substitute white wine for the red and I use parmasean cheese instead of romano.

Not bad substituting tuna and white wine in a pinch...with a dash of hot sauce.

Quick, easy and very tasty. I agree with one of the other reviewers, make sure to use hot Italian sausage for a bit more punch. A very good reliable recipe, make sure to enjoy with a glass of red!

Was disappointed in this. Really nothing special. Thought the onions would be more visible---both taste wise and visually. wouldn't bother to make it again.

This is a very tasty recipe. I make it with Butterball brand Sweet Italian turkey sausage to cut down on the fat & it's absolutly yummy! Note to the reviewer that stated the receipe was too bland . . . try making it with the hot Italian sausage -- that ought to spice it up for you.

Easy & delicious, this recipe is a keeper. It is quick & easy enough for weeknights. Can't wait to make it again!

No bad taste, but not worth hunting down, and I won't make it again. I have many much better pasta recipes. Much too bland for my taste.

This is a great recipe! Easy and quick. I used veal sausage to lower the fat.

My family really liked this one and it sure is easy. I added some fennel seeds because Von's brand sausage roll seemed to lack them. This sausage wasn't fatty compared to a lot of italian sausages. I served some blanched broccoli and carrots lighly sauteed in a little olive oil, minced garlic, rosemary and lemon juice.

This dish reminded me of one my grandmother used to make except hers was meatless. It was quite tasty and easy to prepare. I used chicken sausages to lower the fat content but next time I'll use half pork-half chicken.
