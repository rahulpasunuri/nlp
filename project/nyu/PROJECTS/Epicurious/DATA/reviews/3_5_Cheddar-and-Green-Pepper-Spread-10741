I've made this often for parties - always good. Used a bit of crumbled bacon on top at end for added crunch

wow, velveeta cheese. Uh, that sounds disgusting. Very good as is--using real cheese.

I have been serving this to my family and friends for years. I modified this receipe just a little. I use velvetta cheese, Hellman's Mayonnaise and no mustard. Tastes wonderful with any chips, crackers or celery.

I made this with the Beer Batter Bread (trying to recreate an appetizer I used to get at Union Street Pub in Alex., VA). It was great!
