This is my new favorite way of cooking eggplant! I had one leftover eggplant from our CSA that was starting to rot in my kitchen and last night at 11:30 I decided something had to be done. It was just a regular-sized eggplant that I cut in small slices and broiled 3 min on each side, then brushed with a little more oil and broiled for a few more minutes on each side until the outside was browning nicely and getting a little crispy. I thought the sauce was delicious just as described, with some red pepper flakes to make it a little spicier. Added thinly sliced scallions before I devoured this at room temperature and was one of the best late night meals I've ever made. Looking forward to a repeat soon!

Oh my word! I have been looking for way to cook eggplant that was palatable. I was not an eggplant lover until now. I did make some modifications. I used a large eggplant cut into 1/2 inch slices. Hatch-cut both sides and salted the both sides. I broiled both sides. Then I brushed the sauce on, let it soak, brushed more on, let it soak, etc.I made double sauce, used pepper flakes and extra garlic. I also used seasoned vinegar because that is all I had and low- sodium soy sauce. I found it to be an explosion of taste! Not bland at all like one reviewer said. MAybe it was the way I soaked the sauce in? Whatever it was, rest assured I will be doing this recipe often!

Best at room temperature. Great on mixed grilled veggies, as well.

Added a pinch of crushed red pepper to the sauce. Excellent at room temperature, after the sauce has had a chance to get absorbed. Added chopped scallion and cilantro after it had cooled off.

This dish was quite nice. My boyfriend gobbled it up! I did add more garlic and some crushed red pepper to spice it up. The salt trick in the beginning is crucial....leeched the bitterness out and didn't leave the eggplant salty like you would think.

Good, but needed to cook longer, and burnt. If I make again, I'll steam the eggplant, and cook longer w/skin down.

I doubled the sauce recipe since it seemed to need it. We loved it! It was as good as any eggplant dish we have eaten in the best Asian restaurants

I omit the salt and pan fry it with the sauce and prawns after roasting. It is delicious, quick and a real crowd pleaser.

I too, used the larger eggplants. Cut them about 1/4" and broiled them till well browned. I made less eggplant with the same amount of sauce and tossed the broiled eggplant in the mixture rather than brushing it on. Very good.

It was nice. Next time I'd use more eggplant than the recipe called for. I felt the dressing had a bit of a bite to it. I liked it nonetheless.

Fabulous and easy. What more could you want?

Excellent. Easy and flavorful. No small eggplants avaialable so used larger ones and sliced. Agree that you MUST salt. I put cut grilled peices in bowl bathed in sauce and they disappeared!

We had to use larger egglants, so we sliced them about 1/2 inch thick and grilled them (after salting them). We served them at room temperature, which worked out very well for a summer evening. We brushed them twice with the sauce because the flavor was not intense enough after the first time (once immediately after cooking and the other before serving).

I honestly did not think that the dish explored the potential of the aubergine-there was not enough sauce andoverall it was quite bland-I ended up adding soy sauce, red wine vinegar and some thai basil to impart a flavour-very disappointing

Please don't skip the salt! There is a very good reason- the salt will draw out any bitterness (you will see the eggplants "weep"), and when rinsed, you are not adding any additional sodium. It really is a crucial step. However, for those expecting the traditional chinese prepared dish, one needs to make far more sauce.

I didn't bother "salting" the eggplant. You'll probably have to cook them longer than 3-4 minutes each side. I added some sugar and red pepper flakes to the sauce for a more hot/sweet taste. They were great!

My mother in law gave me a similar version of this recipe, so I combined the two. We cook our eggplants for 15-25 mins. (depending on size & quantity)and we use olive oil instead of sesame seed oil. This makes a great side dish when it's cooked long enough. The eggplant skin should be very thin and almost have a caramelized taste. Otherwise, you ought not bother.

Delicious

Not enough liquid to saturate the eggplants by any means. Also, I found mine (small chubby white ones) needed to cook for about 3 times as long. Okay, but really nothing special.

i am so glad i did not prepare this for guests. the sesame oil overpowered everything and the end results were blase...

awesome! i made it several times experimenting each time. i like the sauce on it for the last few minuites it cooks. its good with pasta and vodka sauce. if you want more spicy add a sprinkle of ground red pepper. yummy

This is really tasty, and a different side dish if you are looking for something out of the ordinary. Amazingly, those little eggplants were on sale at the local supermarket (couldn't believe that one). I served it with grilled pork chops, and it was a good accompaniment. I also tried it with the eggplant on the grill; just as yummy!

I thought that this dish was slightly bland and nothing special- and I was really excited to try it :(

THE DISH TASTE REALLY GREAT EVEN WITHOUT THE MAIN DISH. I HAD IT WITH JUST COOKED RICE. I ADDED A LITTLE GRATED GINGER TO THE MARINADE AND SPRINKLED TOASTED SESAME SEEDS AS GARNISH. YUMMY!
