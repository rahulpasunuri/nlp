Doubled the recipe. So as not to crowd the pan, I cooked the two roasts in a roasting pan and cooked veggies in a separate pan underneath, following the recommended times. Times were precise to the minute. Veggies: Because the veggies wouldn't get flavor from the lamb, I added fresh rosemary (not chopped) to pan with the oil, salt and pepper, and finished them with lemon juice and lemon zest. They were crisp tender and flavorful. A hit. Would do more onions and fewer potatoes next time. Just personal preference. Meat: delicious. Arugula stuffing: too salty and a little stringy. Either don't salt the arugula much or at all or cut back on extra salt on meat before rub goes on. As to stringiness, I'd like to try chard next time instead. Also, I really went to town squeezing out the arugula's liquid. Perhaps if I'd left more moisture it would have been more palatable. Gravy: Did not use cornstarch on pan sauce. Perfect without. Again, just personal preference, and it saves a step.

The was a great meal, an Easter hit. The sauce was perfect. The recommended times were spot on. I did add about a 1/2 cup of water to the roasting pan when I added the vegetables. It helped to cook the veggies and I avoided burning the bottom of the pan which I find happens often when I cook a roast.

Delicious. Did not use chicken broth or cornstarch in the sauce which was alread perfect and full bodied without. Will do it again

Had huge success impressing my in-laws with this. All raved about it. I made the following substitutions: I used a smaller piece of lamb than called for. For the stuffing, I used spinach; didn't have a food processor so I minced the garlic, plus I used dried rosemary and some dried parsley instead of fresh oregano.
