Nothing special. Just a hunk of meat with a relish on top. The relish was good and maybe worth repeating.

We used sirloin instead of tri-tip, and cooked it 30 minutes (probably bc it was thicker than 2 inches). In any case, it still turned out super good, and it's very easy to make!

Great flavors and a total hit. An easy meal for watching the Dallas v. Philadelphia game.

Amazingly delicious and simple for a weeknight dinner that can be prepared after work. I skipped the bell pepper roasting and instead defrosted frozed presliced peppers and substitued ground cumin for the fennel seeds. We served it over mashed potatoes.

I didn't think anything about this was "daunting" -- I made it all on a Monday night after work. Next time, I would make the relish beforehand. At first, I thought the relish tasted a little "grassy," but it grew on me. It is true that the timing is perfect.

This recipe looks daunting but truly doable. The time estimates are accurate. I substituted cilantro for parsley and this woked out well. Excellent recipe.
