So I picked this recipe when I started to feel a cold coming on. I enjoy cooking and although making any soup with fresh ingredients is time consuming, I wanted to make this because I knew it would be spicy and it would open up my sinuses. - It did just that. Obviously most people who are sick want the last thing they would be doing while feeling under the weather to be cooking, but I needed something to cook that would reap tons of leftovers for me to consume over the period of my cold. This recipe did just that. I crawled to make it, MY CHOICE, it took me close to 4 hours. - Again, because I was just being a slow poke about finishing it up. If I had focused soley on the making of it I would have surely finished it 2 hours no problem. The prep takes the most work, but I suggest you take your time get to know the recipe and not feel pressured to finish. The actual outcome was amazing and I was REALLY REALLY happy with the recipe, and all my hard work. I'll be eating this for a few days. Also I subsituted the canned chiles for a Huge Jalapeno as I forgot to purchase the chiles in the can, and I used Hominy instead of Garbanzo beans. 2 types of corn works for me. Otherwise I followed the directions to a T and am really smitten with this soup.

When tomatoes and red peppers were plentiful last September, I made and froze a roasted tomato/red pepper soup base. For this recipe, I pulled that out, added the roasted spices and tortillas, and then proceeded as directed. Very easy and turned out great. My husband, who does not like squash, and my daughter, who does not love spicy food, both enjoyed it. I love being able to use vegetables from our short growing season year round, and this recipe is great for that.

I made this soup with carrots and celery and green peppers too...only cuz i couldnt get butternut sq. It was amazing!!! I don't think it matters what you put in (I also tripled the parsley,,we love it, and add ed spinach at the end). The charring of the jalapeno, garlic and cinnamon and pep was truly the secret, and genius!! I think it was terrific! If you don't have a cast iron, the wok works great! GN

I agree with "A Cook" below: the amount of work for this dish is disproportionately large compared to the deliciousness payoff. In fact, I found the dish spicy but lacking in other flavor, even though I used chicken broth (4 cups, reducing the amount of liquid as recommended). It took me 2 hours start to finish, excluding grocery shopping, and my back ached afterwards. I did get a ton of leftovers though, which I'll puree and feed my babies (with some yogurt it won't be too spicy for them).

Don't try to whip this up on the spur of the moment! It is time-consuming, and not proportionately rewarding. Cut back on the liquid, and substitute chicken broth. Add green beans earlier; otherwise, the starches fall apart while the beans crunch. And what is with the toasted tortillas? They are bland and add nothing. I might try a variation, on a cold afternoon when I have nothing better to do.

This soup is great. I used a vegetable stock that I made the night before in a crock-pot. The texture is very rich and I thought best if the soup simmered a good deal longer than the recipe states. A squeeze of lime is lovely, so is a dollop of plain yogurt or sour cream.

Well, no...it says one 1-1/2 pound squash, but it does end up looking like 11-1/2 lb squash. I can understand the confusion.

It's not even a typo..it clearly says 1 1/2 pounds

Haven't made this yet and need to check---is it really ELEVEN and a half pounds of squash??

Soup had complex flavors and would serve as a meal on a cold fall night. My changes: I used chicken stock instead of water for the liquid and, since I had no jalapenos, I roasted 3 poblanos that had been dying in my fridge along with the tomatoes.

It took me TWO HOURS! This recipe took a long time because I'm no pro in the kitchen, but the times were also a bit longer then it states in the recipe. Also, the ripest tomatoes are very necessary. Mine were a little off and the color turned into more of a yellow then the red in the picture.

This is a good basic Mexican-flavored vegetarian soup. Don't be put off by all the comments about how time-consuming this was. If you are used to cooking good vegetarian food, with all the chopping and mincing involved, this soup will be a breeze!

This was a very labor-intensive recipe and the first time I made it I found myself cursing my decision to try it. Once we tasted it, we changed our minds! It is fan-freaking-tastic! Even my boyfriend (who doesn't typically like cooked veggies) loved it and suggested we make it again. It's very much worth the effort.

Rating: 4
Definitely worth the time and effort. The soup retains its wonderful mix of flavors when it's fresh or after being frozen for awhile. Not for the spicy lightweights, the soup still tastes fine when lessening the jalapenos and chipotle ingredients. I love bold spices so when I make this for myself I like to add extra jalapenos.

I was expecting this to be a nightmare to cook reading some of the other reviews but I didn't find it too hectic. I would say it was well worth the effort. Perhaps my own personal taste but I would say this definitely needed the lime squeezed over the top. I would not let the slightly longer prep time put me off of making this again in the near future.

This was an all right soup, but not worth the amount of time it took to make it.

I would only make this dish again if I had a lot of time on a fall day. It was yummy; i wish i had the chiptoles though, it wouldve made it better. strongly recommended for thanksgiving!

Pulled a package of this from my freezer yesterday for dinner thinking it was a different recipe for roasted vegetables. Realized my mistake with the first bite. Love that kick! Just finished it up for lunch today while looking through my recipe box for turkey day recipes and found it there - good thing since there's only one package left in the freezer. Yummy!

Well worth the "effort." This is a wonderfully tasty soup, and vegetarian to boot. Certainly not lacking in flavour. This will definitely go into the regular rotation for the winter. N.B. The amount of cinnamon stick called for in the recipe is 1/2 what a std stick is.

Ugh! This was gross! I don't understand what people are seeing in this thing! It's far too heavy on the cinnamon, and too sweet with the squash. I just didn't see the sweet and the spicy blending well in this recipe, and the scent of the cinnamon overpowered the rest of the dish. If it didn't take two hours to make, I might try it again, with less cinnamon, more potatoes, more chipotles, and less squash, but spending hours of my time trying to fix something that makes me gag doesn't seem worth it. Really a disappointment.

Nice soup suggestive of chili. Great if you are making dinner for a vegetarian. However, don't think I'd go to extraordinary lengths to make it again. Haven't tried the other 15,000 recipes on this website yet!

This has a nice authentic flavor (with more salt). A few time savers - I broiled the onions first while halving the tomatoes then placed them cut side down and broiled for 6 minutes. The skins pop up and the seeds are easy to squeeze out (I used the seeds and skin for more roasted flavor.) The potatoes don't need to be peeled but should be cubed small 1/2" or less like squash. Once the soup is assembled it needs to cook a lot longer for everything to meld and for the vegetables to be soft enough. Next time I would leave out the green beans or use haricot vert. This is complex and yummy and is best when you start in the morning.

This was a good soup, but WAY too spicy. If you're a lightweight like me, cut down on the spices. Otherwise, the tortillas add a really nice, hearty texture. This freezes well too.

This was best two days after it was made. I would use hominy rather than fresh corn the next time. Delicious with chopped avocado and sour cream as garnishes

This is a standby for me. It does take time, but you end up with delicious and satisfying soup and plenty to freeze for later.

Just had this for a hearty winter dinner and it was perfect. Since I didn't want to muck up the coffee grinder with spices, I put everything for the soup base in a blender, and that worked just fine.

I only used half the cinnamon stick, but that was plenty to give it that taste. I received nothing but rave revues from my guests. The only down side, it was a little time consuming.

Absolutely delicious soup. Yummy roasted flavor, satisfying texture, very healthy, an all-around winner. I won't prepare it terribly often, only because it's quite a bit of work for a soup.

This was just okay. I liked it fresh, but my husband didn't really care for it until it had been in the freezer for a few months. When I thawed it, the squash pureed a bit, which was an improvement. I also added some cooked chicken breast, which made it more substantial for us. Serving this over rice made it even better. Still, I don't think I'd make it again. I kind of had to force myself to eat it, which is never a good sign.

I haven't made this yet, but I was wondering if it was possible to subsitute flour tortillas instead of corn.

I made this but with a twist to make it fork-worthy. First, I added a serrano and a habañero. Second, I included two zucchinis along with the other veggies. And it was even better the second day after with a dollop of sour cream, a bit of manchego on the side along with a refreshing beer...or six...

This soup was just wonderful! It is so flavorful, different but still comfort food. This is the way to eat vegetables. Everything comes together into a simple yet complex soup full of texture and flavor. Sweet and savory, I will make this again with no changes.

This is a labor intensive recipe, but well worth the effort. A nice vegetarian dish that needs no alterations. I followed the recipe exactly as printed and will make it again.

I have made this recipe as shown here. Fabulous. On the day I was preparing it for a nightshade sensitive person (not tomatoes, potatoes), I was also had no time or energy. So I made variations: canned vege broth instead of the water. Add all of the spices (use ground cinnamon) and the drained garbonzo beans. Add garlic and onions, chipotle and adobo, jalapeno (seeded and diced) Cook until soft. Add green beans and cook until barely tender. Add corn and diced squash (I like choyote better in this)and heat. This is very much like a fancy pozole, and is excellent and easy. Serve with the lime, the cilantro chopped, and more chipotle salsa on the side to let people heat it up.

This is a very good soup. It is certainly labor intensive, but the layers of flavor that result are well worth the effort. My only suggestion would be to watch the amount of chipotle chilies, a little goes a long way (and I like spicy stuff!).It is smoky and rich and perfect for a cold fall evening with friends!

What a great soup! The process is a little labor intensive, but it's not hurried. I enjoy preparing dishes that allow me to slow down and really enjoy what I'm doing, and this recipe does that! I followed it exactly, except I didn't find it necessary to seed the tomatoes. My house smelled awesome while this soup was cooking. The only thing I would change is to substitute a stock for the water. If I were preparing it for myself, I would have used chicken stock, but I was making it for a vegan friend, so I stuck with the water. This soup would be great with pork in it. It's recipes like this one that keep me coming back to Epicurious!

Very tasty soup. The lime at the end is a must in my opinion. I couldn't find the chipotle chilies in my local supermarket but otherwise I followed the recipe to a T and it was delicious - I have leftovers and I have a wonderful feeling they're going to be even more delicious!! :-)

Very good. I used small regular tomatoes from my garden because I had them on hand, instead of Romas. The cinnamon adds a good Mexican flavor to this soup.

This is a great dish. I had a couple of skinless, boneless chicken breasts and no garbanzos so I poached the chicken, shredded it and added it. It made it even heartier. There was some left over and it was even better the second day. This soup will become a speciality of mine, I'm sure. I will try it with the beans another time.

I agree this was on the spicy side -- if you have tender palates, you may want to cut back on the peppers. Also, this is definitely a weekend meal unless you have a sous chef -- I think with all the chopping, it took me about 90 minutes. Also, you might want to cut back a little on the water -- I thought it was too much.

Very yummy, but very spicy. I may have added a bit more chipotle peppers than called for and my jalapeno may have been particularily spicy. The leftovers cooled down some. This is a great make ahead dish. Loved by vegetarians and non-vegetarians. I added a dollop of sourcream to each bowl before serving. This also helped to tone down the spicy peppers.
