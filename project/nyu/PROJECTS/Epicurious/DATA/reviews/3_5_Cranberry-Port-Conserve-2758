I love this recipe, and it has been one of my holiday "standards" for many years along with the cranberry horseradish relish that's also on this site (to die for on turkey sandwiches!!). I decided to add some minced candied ginger this time and will do so again. Also, I used just half of a navel orange and one Clementine with good results. I agree that this is not the right cranberry relish for those who like it super sweet, but I personally love the complexity of flavor and texture in this side dish, and I think it is a perfect compliment to turkey. I also love the suggestion by another reviewer to put it over baked brie! Has anyone tried freezing this?

If you think your cranberry sauce should be like candy, then look for another recipe. However, if you want a deep, savory, complex, and wonderfully flavorful complement to the richness of a turkey dinner and all the attendant sides, look no further. We have made this every year since we found it, and it wouldn't be Thanksgiving at our house without it. The kids won't like it, but don't the adults deserve something astonishingly good of their own?!

Whoever said this was "cranberry sauce for grownups" was right on target. One taste of this and I was hooked. Everything worked well together and I can't see why anyone would want to substitute any of the ingredients. To each their own, I suppose... Just finished the last of the conserve in a turkey sandwich on rye bread (perfect way to finish up that leftover turkey).

This wasn't sweet enough and came out way too thick. We didn't even serve it because it was way too tart and too plain for my taste. We made the honey-and-spice cranberry sauce instead -- delish!

This has become a staple to our Thanksgiving repitore. We also love the cranberry/orange relish. We make these EVERY year and everyone loves them both.

a lovely conserve! currants add a nice touch, but most of our family doesn't like nuts in things, so I simply skipped the nuts. i used a tawny port, as that was what i had on hand, and zested the orange, and it was wonderful. you can save the "extra" for other meals, or, it makes a wonderful glaze for poultry and meat, or swirled into muffin or pancake batter, even!

This was a very good cranberry sauce. As usual, it made way more than we needed - maybe make half the recipe next time.

Delicious. Cranberry sauce for grown-ups. The quality of the port is important I think since its flavor is still strong in the finished dish. I used a sweet vintage port which combined wonderfully with the tart cranberries. I also used raisins and a lot more walnuts. We really loved it.

This was a hit at Christmas. I used raisins instead of currants. I think next time I will do what the cook from Calgary did by zesting the orange, removing the pith, and adding the segments cut up. It is also wonderful as a topping for baked Brie.

I didn't like this. I did not cook the orange with the rind as I could not see how the rind would be cooked enough. I prefer a sweeter cranberry sauce. I'm going to keep searching for another recipe.

This was a very good recipe... but I didn't use the fresh orange and used orange marmalade, and I doubled the walnuts. Normally I add a tablespoon of brandy...but the port was a nice touch... Try this one.

A favourite for the holidays (or any day). When I first made this I followed the directions as written, but found the 'unpeeled' orange gave it a bitter taste. Now I zest the orange, cut off and discard the white pith and segment membranes, and add just the zest and chopped sections.

Wonderful with a Thanksgiving meal. Bright in color and full of wonderful flavor. This would be great with pork loin or poultry.

Fantastic and easy to make! Try using a 1/2 cup chopped, dried apricots in lieu of the orange. It's superb with Thanksgiving Day turkey. I get many requests for this recipe during the holiday season.

I make this dish on every holiday and it gets rave reviews! Good port is essential. I double the recipe because it is fabulous with leftovers, and people love to take some home! Wonderful with ham, turkey or rib roast.
