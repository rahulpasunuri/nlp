Love these. Kosher salt tastes less salty so if using regular salt, use a little less. I used mostly fresh Parmesan but did not have enough so used some packaged. Brushed on a mixture of melted butter, garlic powder and herbs immediately upon removing from the oven. Yum!

seems like the recipe calls for a lot of salt but the result is a mellow cheese taste. i topped a third of the buns with thinly sliced mushrooms and sprinkled a bit of parmesan on another third. the shrooms rolls are my favourite. (:

Way too salty, and no cheese flavor to speak of.

I liked it. I modified a little, because I was more interested on the dough. So, I didn't add the cheese to the dough. I reduced the flour to 3 1/2 cups. Before baking, I sprinkled grated sharp cheddar cheese and Italian herbs. Eveybodu loved!! I mad it last weekend and will make it again this weekend. Thank you for the recipe.

This is a fairly easy bread roll recipe. I used a cup of real, aged parmesan (not the canned) but will use more next time for more cheese flavor. The recipe yielded 15 good-sized rolls, whcih was more than enough. I'd also like to try the recipe with other types of cheeses.

A lot of work for an almost heavy roll. Following the receipe was easy. Used real imported parmesan cheese which required a little more kneeding. Expected a lighter roll and a distinctive cheese flavor, got neither. Wasn't bad, but not worth the effort.

My family absolutely adores these rolls! I normally will make this recipe once per week. The only changes I make are to reduce the salt by half (the Reggiano adds a salty flavor) and then I add cheese power to punch up the cheesy flavor. This is THE best chesse roll recipe I've ever run across!
