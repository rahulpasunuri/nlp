This is a dish to make again! I substituted local kale for the collard greens. I would have it like that again! In lieu of pickling spice, I used a cinnamon stick, cloves, allspice, and coriander in the pickling mixture. Delicious! Try this salad, even if you are skeptical. You will love it!

When I saw this recipe, I was inspired to make an even more simple recipe with some leftovers in my fridge: raw collard greens, raw sliced apples, candied pecans, blue cheese crumbled - tossed in olive oil, salt, white pepper, red wine vinegar and honey. I was surprised by how the citrus bitterness of the raw collard greens brought together these different flavors. It was fresh and hearty.

Wonderfully simple and delicious. I made this when I had some leftover collard greens from a different recipe. I happened to have walnuts around too but no apples, so I simplified it by using thin orange slices instead of apples and it was perfect. I'm sure it's even better with the apples but if you're looking for something quicker oranges worked really well!

A terrific and unusual side dish which I've made a few times. I drop the shredded collard leaves in boiling water for 3 minutes to remove the raw green taste, then drain and shock with cold water to prevent further cooking. I like to use Fuji apples; they don't get soggy with pickling. I usually fry the walnuts in olive oil as suggested in the recipe, but most recently, I tried something different. I toasted the walnuts in a 350F oven for about 10 min, cooled and chopped them. Then I used some walnut oil (less than 1/4 cup) instead of olive oil to dress the collards. Both ways were delicious, but I find 1/4 cup of oil in the recipe a bit too much for the quantity of greens.

Collards are usually on the 'choice' table at my CSA and I always grab a bunch so I can make this salad. It's delicious. My favorite of the raw, bitter green salads on epicurious (The tuscan kale caesar slaw is also worth checking out!). It's simple and changes peoples minds about collards. As others have mentioned, you probably want to give the salad some time to sit so the greens absorb the oil and soften a bit. Also, add the oil to the greens a little at a time. Sometimes, the 1/4 is too much.

Who'd have guessed raw collard greens could be so good? I got collard greens from my CSA and was looking for something healthier than the traditional bacon preparation. This fit the bill! Tangy and nutty...yum.

This is the best collard green recipe i have found to date. You just have to trust in the recipe that the combination of flavors lead to something oh so tasty.

I made this with some trepidation, but WOW! The flavors are perfectly complementary, and the collards stayed beautifully crisp for 3 days. (It took me that long to eat it up by myself!) An unexpected delight that is a great substitute for a boring salad.

Amazing!!!-Could not believe this would turn out well. I combined baby spinach with the collards since I didn't have enough. I also used pecans instead of walnuts for a truly southern experience. So many great flavors! I am no longer afraid of collard greens!

This salad is really just terrific if you use spinach rather than collard greens. Much less bitter.

I know what you're thinking ... Raw collard greens??! But this one is absolutely worth a try. A unique green salad for an autumn meal, and best of all, it can be made from ingredients that are available at your local farmer's market... and in season at the same time! :)

My husband, a southerner, hates greens of all kinds and most vegetables but he ate this! The apples are delicious (even my 2 year old ate them) and the greens have no bitterness to them at all. I loved it! I followed the recipe exactly with no variation.

I was a little wary of trying raw collard greens, but this salad is superb! I didn't use cheesecloth for the pickling spices as other reviewers have suggested, and I had no problem with the spices sticking to the apples. The only adjustment I'll make in the future is to use about 1/3 less oil, as I thought there was too much for the amount of greens.

I love this salad. I've been to some great restaurants, including vegetarian ones like Greens in San Francisco, but I never saw this very creative salad before. Not only is it original, it's very healthy, easy to make and delicious. Pickling the apples is really simple. To make the recipe even simpler, I use pre- cut bagged collard greens from Shopper's grocery store here in the DC area.

The collards from our CSA box were fresh and tender and bright green. "Why not use them in a salad," I thought. The reviews looked wonderful, with one exception, so I made the salad just as stated, with the exception of adding sliced persimmons at the end...and everyone raved...the three of us fought for the last spoonful. Try this recipe; it's delicious.

Try this recipe if you have excess collards lying around, but don't expect too much. While this is a pretty salad (especially if you blanch the leaves to deepen their color), there's no real standout flavor. You end up with a heavy oily and bitter aftertaste. The apples were interesting. Wish I knew something else we could use them for. Not disappointed that we tried this - it just wasn't a wow.

I used this recipe when I cooked a meal of Southern food for friends. It was delicious and everyone loved it! I like the tips about putting the pickling spices in a tea strainer or cheesecloth.

Just happening to have collard greens on hand that I had to use up when we were getting ready to celebrate my son's 7th birthday party, I made this recipe for part of the adult menu. Trusting that all the previous reviewers couldn't have been wrong I decided this was the collard recipe that would make the cut for this party. I crossed my fingers because collards are not well known around these parts and veggies like greens are not usually well recevied. But, I like them so I figured I would be happy eating the leftovers. Well, there were none leftover. Its true, this is a four fork recipe that people would want to make again. At the party a lot of guests wanted to know what they were eating, (like I said no one could identify a collard around here), they loved it. This is a very unusual recipe, a conversation piece in and of itself.

This salad was a slam-dunk. What a combo: the crunchy walnuts with the sweet yet slightly tart apples are out of this world! The deep green of the collard is the perfect complement to the apples' redness. Delicious! I have already made it again and expect to do so often!

Fabulous! I must admit I was slightly leery of raw collards, but I was swayed by the positive previous reviews. Wow! This will go on my Thanksgiving menu this year!

This is my first review and I have been using Epicurious for years. What a wonderful new approach to collards. I used walnut oil instead of olive and based on another reviewers comment I used a tea steeper to hold the pickling spices together. A little of this goes a long way but it was fabulous!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some lovely organic collard greens. This is a keeper. I didn't pickle the apples, since I'm on a sugar free diet, but I did add the AC vinegar to the dressing. I also added some sliced fennel. I can't wait for the leftovers!

The combination of textures and flavours in this recipe is unusual and outstanding. I had a hard time getting all the pickling spice off the apples when I drained them. Next time I'll put the pickling spices in cheesecloth for easy removal.

Delicious! This was my first time to cook with collard greens. There is no need to precook the collard; I wouldn't change a thing!

This is a truly special side-dish, with great contrast between the sweet-and-sour apples and crunch greens, accented by the toasted walnuts. The recipe did not say anything about cooking the collard greens, however. I blanched them for three minutes and found that they retained their crunch but didn't taste too raw.

A surprise hit of the evening! What a wonderful flavor and even those who did not like 'greens' loved this dish.

I made the pickled apples and then made the rest of the salad as directed only using Romaine lettuce. It was delicious. The second time I added some fresh fennel and it was even better! I love the way the walnut/olive oil and pickling liquid make the dressing. I will definatly make this unusual and delicious salad again.

I kept checking the recipe to make sure I wasn't supposed to cook the collard greens. This was such a tasty dish (great combination of flavors) and a big hit with my book club!

A fabulous, easy to make salad. I served this at a dinner party where none of us had eaten collard greens previously, and everyone loved it. The pickeled apples are particularly wonderful, and can be added to any salad. If you find the collard greens to be a wee too bitter for your taste, you could easily substitute spinach or other greens.

Although I also did not use the pickling spices - the recipe was wonderful. I had never eaten or served raw collards before and was amazed at how tasty this dish is.

Everyone wanted the recipe for this at my St. Patrick's Day party. I doubled the recipe and added almost a whole head of cabbage (thinly sliced). I put the cabbage into the bottom of a large pot and steamed it for a few minutes. Put the apples on top and stirred it around to re-heat. Then added the collard greens and some watercress. Poured in the oil and walnuts. Steamed everything for a few minutes so that the greens were just wilted and the cabbage tender. This served 10 people with most everyone taking second helpings. A great dish!

Excellent... also, I made it once without pickling spice, and it was just fine. Everyone loved it, even people who "don't like" greens!
