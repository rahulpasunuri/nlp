I didn't have any polenta or cheese, so used matzo meal and threw in a little corn starch to help with the consistency. I added the cayenne plus the same amount of Tony's Cajun Seasoning. I had a little bit of an issue with the crust trying to break off when I flipped the tomatoes, but that's not surprising given my modifications. Still quite a delicious way to use a couple of tomatoes I had sitting around one morning.

I'd like to give this a 3 and a half. I freestyled and used tempura batter. Very good and a little lighter.

I followed suggestions and used fish fry instead of polenta (but did use refined cornmeal and also added some crushed cornflakes for texture), and added a tiny bit of paprika and nutmeg. The nutmeg was FABULOUS. Heartattack or not, i'm making these again...

use jersey tomatoes

I loved these. Of course there is hardly anything you can do to a tomato that will keep me from eating it. Nice alternative to fried green tomatoes. I usually find them way too sour.

I always use white cornmeal to fry these tomatoes. They come out light and sweet. Always be sure to heat the oil correctly to fry quickly. Drain well and salt and pepper to taste...sometimes i'll add a pinch of nutmeg at last. ENJOY!

I made this dish, following the recipe exactly, but I found the polenta seemed to stay very crunchy in the frying, and made the whole thing a little hard to eat. You had to use very ripe tomatos to get the coating to stick. I think next time I might try making a wet coating with similar ingrediants. I felt that I wasted some really yummy tomatos!

I really liked the idea of frying red tomatoes, so I tried it, but cheated, because I could only find regular fine cornmeal. I used Zatarain's Crunchy Fish Fry Coating and made them. They were great!
