This was very easy to make and very good. I used all of the broccoli rabe, just cut it up a bit. The sweet sherry and the raisins cut the bitterness -- but it is the juxtaposition of the two that makes this taste so interesting.

to Caroline67, I always blanch broccoli rabe for a few minutes before adding to any recipe, it still has a nice bitterness, but takes some of the edge off.

I used a combo of regular raisins and dried cranberries and I also used every part of the broccoli rabe (except the very bottom of the stems). I separated the stems/flowerettes from the leaves and put those in first so they had more time to cook without cooking the leaves down to mush. Excellent!

The combination of pinenuts, sherry and raisins is lovely with the bitterness of the broccoli rabe. But if you don't like bitter, if you don't like broccoli rabe, you won't like it! Duh.

I hit one fork by accident and wish I hadn't. It was a perfect storm of yuck - the tips were bitter beyond being edible, the stalks were woody, stringy, and chewy and the whole thing was a mess. I've had broccoli rabe before and I know it has a kick, but this recipe didn't soften it any. Ick!

Used pumpkin seeds instead of pine nuts and was delicious. No left overs and everyone really enjoyed it.

The jury is out on this one... some liked it and some did not (too bitter). It was definitely a different Xmas dinner side dish and healthy!

I used water instead of sherry to cook down broccoli rabe, and to soften raisins and currants. Delicious and healthy side in 15 mins.

This was better than I expected. I used walnuts, cranberries and white wine. Will make again...for sure.

This made a great side dish for a holiday dinner.

Exactly what I wanted: bitter and sweet and nutty and garlicky. Also good with pasta, if you use more olive oil, and grate some Romano cheese on top.

Tasty! I used dried cranberries instead of raisins which made a lovely red and green dish (would work well for christmas).

I made this dish for a dinner party the other night and everyone loved it. It was simple to make and went very well with the pork loin roast.
