I agree this needed more flavor. It is very easy to make and next time I will add more spice and a dressing. It was too bland and dry for me. It is best the next day.

This recipe was quite good. I changed a few things... I used quinoa instead of couscous, I find it has a little more substance to it. I also used a mix of dried berries I had already instead of the currants. The mint added a nice flavor, however, over all there could have been a little more depth of flavor. I prefer this as lunch not dinner.
