I liked this recipe. Despite what other reviewers said about its authenticity, the creams tasted delicious, both on top and inside. Sure, I might try another clafoutis recipe but the sponginess of this cake and taste of the sweet cherries was lovely.

reading the reviews, i see you've mistakenly said that 100% would make it again - the opposite is true

Chef Presnal has doctored this very simple "peasant" recipe beyond recognition. Sour cream, whipping cream, creme fraiche are overkill and not authentic. Perhaps a different name for this receipe would have been more appropriate.

How can you rate this recipe when you changed the whole thing? I made another clafouti recipe from this site, using no creme fraiche or mascarpone, and real cherries, and it tasted like a rubber beach sandal. I hoped this one would be much better with the rich fattening ingredients. I haven't made it yet, but I trust it will be an improvement.

My French friend's mother is visiting. She made this today. Her way is much simplier. She used nonfat milk - no creme, no sour cream, no cream fraiche. We also used apples because that's all we had. She did say that cherries is the traditional way.
