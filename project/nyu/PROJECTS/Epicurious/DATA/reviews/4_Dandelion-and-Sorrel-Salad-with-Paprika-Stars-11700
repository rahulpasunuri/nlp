I am always looking for ways to use my sorrel and plentiful beautiful dandelion greens. The radicchio-like nature of the dandelion greens and the lemony flavor of the sorrel complement eachother nicely and are nicely set off by the sweetness of the dressing.

This was amazing - though I simply used the recipe as a guide. I made a dressing with white wine vinegar, olive oil,sugar, minced Walla Walla onions, a litte lemon juice, paprika, salt, pepper, and minced crystallized ginger. I tossed it with just sorrel and some fresh raspberries. It was cool, crisp, and refreshing. The sorrel's citrus flavor meshed well with all the other tastes. I didn't even need the paprika stars though they sound delicious. I will try the real thing next time!
