I took another reviewers idea and used 4oz. blue cheese with a tsp of dried thyme and 1/2 cup of chopped fresh spinach. Same amount of Bread, eggs, cream and milk. Bake it all in one small casserole dish. Had it will broiled Steak - Really great!

Oddly, giving this only two forks, I would still make it again but change it somehow. It was easy and has potential, but was just ok overall. Not half as good as I was expecting. I'm not sure what I would change though to make it better. I'm open for suggestions.

Wonderful and easy. I used bread from a loaf of rosemary bread I'd baked a few days earlier. The recipe was super easy and delicious. Like others, I found it under done at the end of the specified cooking time, so I turned the heat up to 400, cooked it about 5-10 more minutes, then put the oven on broil for the last couple of minutes to get the tops golden. A complete success!

This was a very good side dish along with filet...made it for New Year's Eve...it is very rich and will probably use smaller ramekins and make more than 6 next time...just since they are so rich.

Absolutley WONDERFUL!!!!! I made a smoked tomato coulis with fresh basil to go with it and it was outstanding! Great for a starter for a Fall or Winter appetizer. I have been a Chef for the past 15 years so I know a good recipe when I see one. You will not be disapointed!

Great starch alternative. Try replacing goat cheese with crumbled danish blue cheese to accompany beef.

This was a success! However, I'd like to note that the water should be near boiling when placed in the oven, and a higher temperature was also necessary to produce a golden crust. My ramekins were slightly larger than 1 cup, so I raised the temperature to 400, and then turned the broiler on at the very end. Lastly, I reduced the fat by using 1 cup skim milk and 1/2 cup heavy cream. They turned out perfectly!

Easy & delicious. I didn't change a thing. It made a great substitute for stuffing with my turkey.

Very easy and out of the ordinary! Instead of plain bread & fresh rosemary, I used a rosemary sourdough, and herbed goat cheese--it was very tasty, but would've been a weak main dish--much better as a side dish! (I made this in a souffle dish & increased the baking time by 10 min.)

This is a great side and holds really well for larger parties. I added a bit of precooked leek as well. Very good.

This dish was so easy to make and it tasted delicious. Definitely will make again for parties or other special occasions when I don't want to spend all day preparing somehting!
