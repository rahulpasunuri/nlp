Delicious and unusual. Kept it hot in a little crock over a tea candle.

I'd just like to point out that the name of this recipe is Piedmontese - and it means "Hot Sauce" or "Hot Dip".

I have never tasted, seen or heard of bagna cauda before but I'm a sport so I gave it a try. It was unusual to say the least. The sauce separated and there were clumps of browned anchovies in little pools of olive oil. There was no dipping here- the olive oil coated the veggies but we had to use a knife to get any of the anchovies. The taste was okay or at least had potential but the visual was weird.

Haven't tried the recipe, but intend to. As soon as I stop drooling down my shirt.

The name is not Portuguese but Piedmontese dialect. A great classic particularly if accompanied by a Nebbiolo grape wine. Un fortunately I can not eat garlic but everybody else loves this oustanding Italian regional cooking recepy

Besides being a great dip this recipe makes such a luscious sauce. I love to serve it drizzled over white wine poached roughy or similar mild white fish served over mashed potatoes with a side of steamed green beans and a hearty bread to catch every bit of the sauce. I've tweaked the recipe a few times by adding some grated orange and lemon zest and a bit of chopped fresh parsley along with the butter. It adds yet another layer of complexity. C'mon A cook. You'll be a convert too.

This was one of my father's favorite winter recipes. We used fennel, bell pepper, and other root vegetables to dip into the sauce kept warm in a fondue pot. Have plenty of sourdough bread on hand to catch every drop of the dipping sauce.

Bagna Cauda (hot bath) is a veggie dip served warm/hot. On New Years eve many Italian families gather around the pot on the stove dipping their veggies then holding them over a piece of italian bread to catch the drippings. The first time I tried it I felt the same as A Cook but, once I actually tasted it, I loved it. It is a real treat.

This recipe was deliciso! Always wanted to try bagna cauda. Followed the recipe, served with homemade flat bread and Sonoma Sebastiani 2007 Barbera, not as appetizer but as Tuesday night dinner. Wonderful.

Ahh, Cook--you would be so wrong not to try this. It's a delicious fondue-like dipping sauce. Bagna Cauda is "warm bath" in Italian. It's usually served as an appetizer with a nice glass of red wine. Try it!

No reviews, but some anonymous 4 fork ratings? I'm not going to lie this recipe looks disgusting. There isn't even a description to make me want to try it or explain what Bagna Cauda is (likely portugese for barf sauce).
