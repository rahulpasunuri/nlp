I discovered the Sausage Stew recipe while visiting my parents. With a few minor changes and the help of a variety of garden picked peppers, it was the BEST stew weve ever had! Substitutions: 1 can Rotel (we did not have the stewed tomatoes or the tomato paste), cheese was offered on the side. We doubled the chicken broth, left out the green beans, and used Hillshire Farms smoked sausage instead. Served with corn bread = YUM!

I was skeptical but it turned out really good. I did half a recipe, which made 6 servings, and added a can of chickpeas. I used the full amount of broth and tomatoes.

I was making this just for my wife and I so I cut things down a little. Still, she prefers more "juicy" soups so I kept the chicken broth close to the same quantity. There was still a lot more stuff than soup! I also left out the cheese because I could see that it was already going to be pretty thick. All in all, I agree w/some of the other reviewers that this could be made w/whatever you have in your fridge (I substituted zucchini and pea pods for the bell pepper and green beans) and it makes a very flavorful, satisfying mix.

This was OK. It was stew, and it was sausage. Not the knockout I was anticipating.

As with stew in general, this recipe is very flexible. I used 1 lb. spicy italian sausages and 1 lb. of a mild chicken pesto sausage. I also used 2 onions and 2 leeks (white part only), and 1/2 lb. potatoes and 1/2 lb. rutabagas. I brought it to a potluck and everyone raved. Will definitely make this one again and again, and I'm sure it'll be different every time, depending on what's in the fridge!

So what's all this about?

I swapped the potato with courgette and used sun dried tomato puree instead of plain. I also added some butter beans. I did not use any cheese. It was absolutely delicious, I'd definitely make again as you can substitute pretty mcuh whatever you have in. The recipe was also very easy to follow.

Just so you know -- this makes a ton, and is very filling. I used the Costco chicken sausages, and added carrots to the vegetable mix. It ended up being very thick so I added another can of chicken stock. It was good but needed something -- not sure what. Definitely needed lots of salt and pepper. We used only the parmesan cheese, just did not need the other cheeses.

I enjoyed the recipe from its original beginnings...BUT I also enjoyed using white cannilli beans subbing for potatoes ...and only used parmesan regianno cheese. A great one dish meal! Great robust flavors...

This was so good....that I can tell you, it's one of those dishes that you keep finding a reason to pass by the refrigerator to get another scoop of it! I used 1.5 lbs Jimmy Dean Pork Sausage...and 1 lb Italian mild sausage. I used a good Italian Grigio White wine and added extra cubed potatos and red/yellow peppers. This stew/soup would be good adding virtually anything! I am going to make it with seafood today with the sausage...some oysters, scallops, and also add some scallions. I can't rave enough about this stew....I am going to try it with beer instead of wine too...should be delicious!!!!!!!

I thought this was simple and tastey. I substituted lots: zuccini for peppers and red wine for white but the broth was really good and this recipe provides a good framework for whatever vegies and meat you have in your ice box. I also added some chili pepper.

Fantastic with Al Fresco Chicken Sausages! For a change, instead of using their sweet Italian flavor, I used one of their other great flavors, Roasted Garlic--deee-lish!

I was a bit concerned when I saw the ingredients, but my husband wanted a sausage dish so I tried it. Definitely a "keeper" as we call good dishes in our family. I would elimate the potatoes and substitue some small pasta, such as ditalini. Flavor was wonderful.

Thought that I would rate this...have had many times and always guests want more! Great for after skiing with a cold beer.

This is a great dish! My roommate loved it, and when I took it in for lunch the next day it was even better. Didn't use Italian sausage, substituted Bob Evans' Flavor Explosion, we like it more than Italian sausage. Also, used the other reviewer's suggestion of zucchini, I'm not a fan of string beans, so the zucchini was perfect. Mixed some cheese in and used the rest as a topper over Italian bread. Thanks for the tip. Yum and no cheese clean up as other people complained about! Will definitely make this again and again, maybe I'll try the beer next time.

This is a great stew. Instead of the wine, I added a bottle of Anchor Steam beer - great addition. I have also made it with the wine, but will use beer now instead. I have yet to master the cleaning up process with this dish, though. The cheese in the stew makes for a lot of scrubbing when dinnertime is over!

LOVE IT!!! Like other reviewers I tweak the veggies in this. Last night added a bag of frozen corn. some carrots, zucchini, celery... Just kinda emptied my frig's veggie bin into the stew. It always turns out great! Solved the nasty lumps o'cheese problem by floating a slice of toasted italian bread on top of each bowl. Spread cheese on bread and put it under the broiler til bubbly. Make this dish several times a year. It also freezes well, though there are rarely leftovers.

A definite keeper. A nice change to cooking sausage. Very flavourful and this recipe opens opportunities to try different sausages or peppers. Next time I might just "kick it up a notch" and add a habanero or two!

"This was OK" [except I didn't make the recipe] C'mon! Does anybody out there care to read about someone's misadventures in the kitchen? I doubt it. I enjoy reading about someone's tweaking a recipe but don't waste anyone's time with an original recipe that fails! This recipe, when followed, is pretty good! And it's even better the next day.

This was OK. I made it in my crock pot, and it smelled good, but it just wasn't too exciting to taste. I did make some changes to the recipe, though, since I didn't want to go to the store: hot italian sausages instead of sweet; red and yellow peppers instead of green; green and yellow squash instead of green beans; an extra can of stewed tomatoes in place of some of the chicken broth; and a bit more cheese than specified. It was good, but just that. It was colorful though, nice for springtime, and a hot but not heavy dish for a cold rainy day.

I really enjoyed this dish. I did not have any beans in the freezer so I added carrots and zucchini to the recipe and it turned out great. The cheeses really made a difference to this meal.

This dish was excellent! I doubled the recipe and still there were no leftovers! I plan on making this again!

This was okay. I don't think I'll make it again. I'd rather try out something new. It tasted good, but lacked something for me. I don't know what it was.

I had sausage I wanted to cook up and I didn't want to make the old standby of "sausage and peppers". I used a combo of sweet and hot sausage (2/3 sweet to 1/3 hot ratio) and substituted frozen corn for the frozen beans. My man LOVED this dish.

Delicious and hearty. One suggestion is to cook the potatoes a little longer. Great recipe though.

This is a truly great sausage recipe. I used a few hot Italian sausages and the rest sweet Italian sausages. The cheese is a little much and I may back off just a little on it next time, but the flavor is really outstanding. I also feel that the sausages should be cooked in a little Olive oil to brown them, which is not mentioned in the recipe. This recipe is worth the added cost of using quality ingredients and the extra time needed to gather the freshest ingredients, as well.

The flavour of the stew was good, and it was quick, definitely a bonus for weekday dinner. However, the way the melted cheese congealed on utensils, teeth, bowls etc... was irritating. If I make this again, I will substitute one cup heavy cream for the mozzerella and cheddar, and season to taste with salt.

Excellent! Wonderful! Simply marvelous!

I made this for our company's Stew Challenge-seven cooks competing, with fourteen judges scoring. And to my amazement, it won First Place. Perhaps it's because there's so many guys in our office, but the combination of sausage, potatoes and cheeses proved irresistible.

This was a delicious, hearty stew. Everyone I've made it for has loved it! Perfect for supper up at the ski house! Believe me, the person who gave it one fork must have messed up the recipe.

Ooof. A misstep, not to be repeated.
