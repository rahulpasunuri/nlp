There are some issues with this recipe as written. For one, I can't imagine you'd need to bake bread cubes for 25 minutes at 400 degrees to get them browned. They'd be beyond blackened at that point. Keep a close eye on yours, it's more like 5-7 minutes. I also think you need a bit more bread than called for - a total of 2 1-pound loaves. The amount of onion is also far too excessive for the amount of other ingredients. For what you'll pay for chestnuts in some parts of the country, you don't want onion to be your dominant ingredient. I used 1 very large onion, and it was certainly sufficient. I also disagree with the cooking method for the mushrooms. Mushrooms should be cooked in a very hot pan, with some butter and olive oil, until just browned on each side, stirring constantly. Cook them on a low temperature until they ooze moisture, and you'll have mushy mushrooms in your stuffing. I seasoned the mushrooms with salt and fresh pepper, then with approximately 2 tsp dried thyme, sauteed just for a moment before removing from heat. You'll probably need to cook in batches. I sliced and then halved my mushrooms for more "stuffing-like" bits. Celery adds nothing to this dish and seems to compete with the more earthy, nutty, woodsy flavors of chestnuts, mushrooms, and onions. I would omit or dramatically reduce the volume of celery. I added another tbsp of dried thyme to the stuffing mix before baking, and also added some sage. You should sample your stuffing for salt and pepper after you've mixed and moistened it. Unless you brine and then stuff the turkey, the stuffing will probably need more salt and some pepper.

This recipe was great. I did a few things differently - prepared it the night before, used an extra 1/2 lb. of chestnuts (I actually used a jarred/pre-roasted/shelled chestnut at a high end grocer), and also added a little extra liquid/broth to the mixture. After it was cooked, I let it sit out overnight. About 30 minutes before the meal was served hte next day, I covered it with aluminum foil and put it back in the oven to warm up at 325. Came out perfect.

Here's where I admit that I've never eaten or made stuffing before (weird as that sounds), so you might want to take my review with a grain of salt since I have no comparative experience. Without further ado...This was the best stuffing I've ever had! :) I roasted the chestnuts fresh and I used fresh herbs. It was fragrant and nutty and delicious. I used a low-sodium vegetable broth from a box since that's what I had on hand. I also had to use olive oil instead of butter for a dairy-intolerant guest. It is completely addictive. I burnt some of the bread when I was toasting it and got distracted so I only used about 3/4 lb. Despite the reduction, there was mountains of it!!! I prepared it a day ahead and refrigerated it and I thought it came out just fine. I baked it outside the turkey. I'll be using this recipe next Thanksgiving as well!

A new Thanksgiving favorite -- and well worth the burned fingertips and frustration of peeling hot chestnuts. I substituted olive oil for half of the butter and used homemade vegetable broth (from leek, celery and carrot) instead of chicken stock to make the dish vegetarian. I also added a bit more stock to ensure the stuffing was sufficiently moist. The taste was fantastic -- the mushrooms worked well with the fresh herbs, and the chestnuts added a subtle, sophisticated flavor and texture. I omitted the nutmeg by mistake and didn't miss it.

I found this recipe to yield far too many servings for our relatively small family, and I wasn't overwhelmed by it. Not one to be deterred, however, I'm going to try it again this year (with minor edits) -- if only because I have a large quantity of chestnuts on hand!

I first pulled this recipe from epicurious in 1998 and have made it ever since...I hhave made one modification- I use fresh rosemary but I found 3 tablespoons to be a little overwhelming, so I use 2. I also "italianized" it a bit by adding porcini mushrooms.

It was the first time I made stuffing, and I was glad it was this recipe. Absolutely delicious! It was moist as mentioned in other reviews - but that's a good thing! Make exactly as recipe says, and you'll be happy.

This tasted amazing! I can't imagine how one couldn't just love it. Stuffing is supposed to be moist - nothing is worse than dried-out stuffing. It seems to rate high with the others too. Sorry NY, you must have forgotten something. Make exactly as posted! You won't be sorry.

What a huge disappointment! I should have stuck to my own version of a chestnut and mushroom stuffing. It was way too moist and not especially tasty. First time ever that my Thanksgiving Day stuffing was awful.

I made this stuffing recipe for Thanksgiving this year and it was a huge hit. I used purchasing stuffing mix instead of cubing my own bread and it was very easy and delicious. This one's a keeper!

Excellent vegetarian stuffing! The chestnuts gave it a subtle nutty flavor. I used wild mushrooms and wild mushroom stuffing in place of broth, which I would recommend for the intensified flavor.

Our Thanksgiving Dinner tradition is the Herb Roasted Turkey with this great Mid-Atlantic Mushroom stuffing and the Shiitake Mushroom Gravy. Since I'd served it in 1994 (Bon Apetit, November 1994 issue)it has not missed one of our Thanksgiving dinner gatherings. We all love it. Thank you.

This recipe is bound to become a family heirloom. We've been making it since a member of our family wanted a vegetarian stuffing option and now it is part of our Thanksgiving tradition. We've always baked it separate from the turkey and it comes out perfectly moist.

A holiday classic in our house--great for vegetarians!

This is delicious! I have never had much luck with alternative stuffings for the holidays, finding most of them too time consuming and lacking that "traditional" taste. This is the exception - it's wonderful, moist, tastes traditional without resorting to the bag or the box - and much more impressive.

By all means, use canned or bottled chestnuts. The can I used was smaller than 15 ounces so cut the whole recipe by a third. Still made a lot of stuffing which everyone enjoyed.

I have been making this stuffing every Thansksgiving without fail since it first appeared in Bon Appetit and have ALWAYS rave reviews! NOTE: guys, you don't have to go crazy with the chestnuts, this is very simple-buy jarred chestnuts which have already been steamed/roasted and have been shelled!! You can buy these around the holidays in the larger supermarkets like Stop and Shop or A&P for $8-13.00 or Trader Joe's for $3.99!!!! And of course, prepare this dish the night before!

I liked the stuffing a lot, but I would add a few comments: 1) The chestnuts added about an hour of work, and didn't make much of a difference as far as I could tell. I will probably leave them out next time. 2) This seems like a very large recipe. I made about 1/3 of the recommended amounts. 3) All that butter seemed pretty unhealthy, so I substituted cooking spray. Seemed to be good that way. 4) For the guy who asked how to roast chestnuts: Cut an X shape in the flat side of each nut with a small, sharp knife. Lay the chestnuts on a baking sheet in 1 layer, and bake at 350 F for about 45 minutes.

Personally not a stuffing fan, but my husband liked this recipe. Would suggest more chestnuts than recommended in the recipe as he said he didn't taste a one.

How do I roast the chestnuts?

I made this stuffing with an apricot-glazed turkey and it was great.
