Amazing! This sorbet came together in less than 15 minutes. It was creamy and scoopable even after being frozen. I did make the flourless chocolate cake to go with it. The two together were a perfect pair. I received raving reviews for both.

My husband enjoyed this, but I thought it was terrible--VERY high calorie, but without the pleasure that kind of indulgence should give. I used fresh key limes from our tree. It was really sour, and the coconut taste was almost non-existent, though the cream of coconut was where the calorie punch was. I won't make this again.

**PATRICK'S (ALMOST) SUGAR-FREE COCONUT-LIME SORBET** This may be the most incredible "ice cream" I have ever had. I figured out how to make it with minimal sugar. For me, it is the perfect combination of tart and sweet: --2 cans (13.5 oz each) unsweetened coconut milk [*we have an Asian market here; coconut milk costs .89 instead of the $2.50+ at the regular grocery store] --7-8 limes juiced (no pulp) --Zest of 1 (or more) limes (to taste) --13 Splenda packets (probably = 1tsp each; only had packets on hand) --3 sugar packets ("") [Could probably make it totally with Splenda] Mix ingredients. You can add more/less sweetner (to taste), but keep in mind that freezing it intensifies the sweetness and the tartness. I use a Cuisinart ice cream maker. In 30 minutes, it tastes incredible. After 1-2 hours in the freezer it is a perfect texture for serving. For longer-term freezing, I recommend putting it into individual serving containers because it freezes pretty hard. If you let it thaw for a bit before serving, it is fine. [Maybe putting it in the food processor frozen and then letting it thaw a bit would work best?] I hope you enjoy this as much as I do!

I have a milk allergy but I love ice cream so I thought I would try sorbet at home. I am impressed! As far as I am concerned I don't ever need to have ice cream again. Easy to do for an inexperienced cook too.

This was so easy to make and so delicious. I doubled the recipe and added lime zest and shredded coconut as other reviewers suggested. I served this at a party with a pineapple/coconut/lime dessert. It was very light and refreshing and a big hit. There were no leftovers. I would definitely make this over and over again.

I unfortunately didn't see the person who commented on using unsweet coconut milk - which I did - and didn't add sugar - which it NEEDS BAD! BE WARNED!!

I was disappointed. I love limes and coconuts, but it was too sweet (and this is from someone who LOVES sweeet desserts) and too tart. It just wasn't the decadent experience I was hoping for. Just OK. I made it over a month ago and the left overs are still sitting in the fridge. CLOYING.

Easy and delicious, this is a nice finsh to a spicy thai meal or a great hot summer night dessert. Next time I might add a little grated lime peel to add flecks of color.

Hmm, I guess you can't edit reviews after you submit them? I forgot to say that I doubled the recipe to feed 15 people, and also, the recipe makes MORE than 1 pint - it's closer to 1 qt. I used a 1.5 qt (3 pt) ice cream maker, but the doubled recipe almost overflowed in the ice cream maker, and to get it to freeze properly, I needed to split it into 2 batches. I stuck it in a half gallon ice cream container to finish freezing, and the doubled recipe filled it, plus I had a bowl leftover.... But the sorbet is so good, it all disappeared quickly!

This was very tasty and got great reviews from the 15 people who had it! And it's super easy to make - what a great combination! One caveat - if you use unsweetened coconut cream (which was what I found), you MUST add sugar (I added 1/2 to 1 cup). It tasted pretty nasty without it....

This is my favorite sorbet to make--it's incredibly easy and always a hit. It is very sweet but the tang of the lime balances the sweetness.

I doubled the recipe and added two teaspoonsfull of dark rum. What an excellent recipe. I had some left over only because I said it was all gone. I put it between some homemade gingersnaps and made ice cream sandwiches. Outstanding.

I was afraid with the other reviews, that this would be way to sweet...but decided to follow the recipe and adjust it if I decided to make it again. The lime juice is a nice addition and offsets the sweetness nicely. Next time I may add just a hint of vanilla. This was very good.

I am glad I doubled the recipe because it was a big hit at a dinner party. I served it after an asian style meal and it comlemented it beautifully. I agree it would be best to strain the fresh lime juice.

Very good! It is very sweet, but refreshing and went great with the Chocolate Almond Souffle Torte!

I made this over the weekend and it was wonderful. I used bottled Key Lime juice, and added about 1/2 of sweetened, shredded coconut - yum! I think it would be even better with a nice, bittersweet chocolate sauce to accompany it; a frozen version of my favorite Key Lime patties!

This was fabulous. I gave the recipe to 3 people within a day of making it myself. Next time, however I would strain the lime juice -- the frozen pulp was a little bitter.

The only downfall of this recipe is that it did not make NEARLY enough! I did not make the cake, just the sorbet and was very pleased. Even those who are not fans of coconut could eat this because the flavor kind of lingers in the background.

The sorbet was delicious. The lime is a perfect counterpoint to the coconut. Tremendous and sophisticated flavor. The perfect consistency.

Wonderful! The blend of flavors is magnificent! I used the juice of Key Limes, and it was so flavorful. This is a keeper!

The tartness of the lime and the delicate flavors of the coconut in the sorbet complemented the rich, bittersweet flourless chocolate cake perfectly. The sorbet alone is wonderfully refreshing. It sets well and has a creamier, smoother consistency than most sorbets. Very easy!

Just loved it....a unique dessert. The sorbet alone is worth 4 forks!

This was so easy to make! The fresh lime juice gave it the pungent flavor. It was fantastic on its own.
