Delicious. We omitted the coriader leaves because we don't like it much. We had it with a Greek Salad and unlevened Lebanese bread. Fabulous.

I made this recipe last night although I must admit that I realized as the patties were broiling -- I forgot to add the parsley!! Even without one of the two main ingredients, the dish turned out delicious. I also skipped the sauce and just salted the patties after they were done broiling. Served with saffron-infused basmati and a cucumber radish salad dressed with yogurt. It was a quick and easy meal that everyone enjoyed.

We really enjoyed this recipe. The only change I made was adding mint chutney (has a litle zip to it) because I had no fresh or dried mint. I also used it in the sauce as well as a little bit of horseradish sauce left over from something (I hate to throw food out!)

This was a very good quick dinner recipe. I didn't use the coriander and mint as I normally don't have that many fresh herbs in the fridge, but it was delicious anyway. I also added garlic, lemon juice, and 1/2 a cucumber to the sauce which turned out very yummy. I guess I really changed the recipe, but it was a good basis from which to start!

Very good I did it on the grill. What a taste the sauce just topped it off fine and kept it moist.
