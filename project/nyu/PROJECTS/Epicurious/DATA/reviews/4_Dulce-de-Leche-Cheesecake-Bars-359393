Delicious!!! I made this as one of many desserts for Rosh Hashanah and it was a favorite! I made my own dulce de leche which is super easy and much tastier, not to mention cheaper, than store bought. I increased the cinnamon in the crust to 1/2 tsp which was perfect. I used my mixer instead of a processor for the filling. Absolutely will make it again!

These are definitely worth making. They are quick and easy. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used dulce de leche with chocolate (it was the only kind they had at Whole Foods). The fleur de sel is also a must (they have that at Whole Foods too).

These were delicious and fairly easy to make. I accidentally overbaked them a bit and was worried how they turned out, but in the end all was good. Very rich and flavorful, plus they looked very pretty on the serving plate.

This recipe is FANTASTIC... I recommend getting dulce la leche from a Mexican market, if you can. Not too sweet, super rich and fancy. Great for a crowd.

These were good, but nothing special. I love dulce de leche and was disappointed this had a muted flavor. It tasted like a regular cheesecake with a little wisp of caramel on top.

Delicious!! Easy to make. I purchased the dulche de leche from Williams Sonoma. I forgot to sprinke with the sea salt, oh well, I guess they will only be better. They are very rich but that didn't keep me from eating them. A defineite keeper.

I have made this several times with no adjustments. Each time I find myself a little more generous with the Fleur de Sel. They are so perfectly decadent. The cheesecake is such a hit that my neighbors have asked me if they could PAY me to make them for their Thanksgiving celebration! Their enthusiasm is payment enough :)

Very tasty and easy to make. Just used a stand mixer for filling instead of a food processor. Worked fine. Baking times for filling and crust were just right.

Easy and delicious. These are fabulous to make ahead too. http://ladyberds-kitchen.blogspot.com/2010/10/dulce-de-leche-cheesecake-squares.html

I thought these were very underwhelming. Maybe the dulce de leche I made from condensed milk doesn't have as concentrated a caramel flavor as a commercial brand. I found the caramel taste very muted. This recipe was a lot of work and tasted a lot like plain old Philadelphia cheesecake.

There was nothing wrong with these, they just didn't blow me away. These were so rich, I had to cut them into tiny squares instead of bars. The glaze was a bit thick for my taste so if I made them again I'd use less of it. And as far as the whipping cream goes, I really didn't need any of it. I heated the dulce de leche on the stove and that's all I needed to do. Don't skip the salt! Any coarse sea salt will do.

Delicious,rich without being too sweet. I made my own dulce de leche by baking sweetened condensed milk in a 400 degree oven, in a covered glass dish, set in a pan of water until it thickened and carmelized. Family and friends love it. This is a keeper!

These bars were easy to make, looked elegant, and tasted fantastic. The birthday boy (age 33) was extremely satisfied. I'd make them again in a split second if they weren't too decadent for daily consumtion.

made these for a bbq.... and everyone loved them! I refrigerated them overnight to help set the glaze on top, helped thinken it a bit. cutting these were tricky, even using a wet knife.

I brought these cheesecake bars to a Mexican-themed dinner party and found that they were a huge success! Everyone raved about them and wanted the recipe. The only hiccup that I had while making them came when it was time to make the glaze. I found that 3 T. of cream made my glaze a little too runny. Fortunately, the bars still tasted amazing. Next time, I will most likely only add 1 T. cream to the glaze making it thicker and a little less caloric (not that anyone is counting with this dessert).

Very good, and definitely better on day two. I passed the sea salt separately so that guests could choose to use it or not.

Really good and really easy. Don't skip the salt.

DELICIOUS!!! Made these for a dinner party and our guests are still talking about them (weeks after the party). Made my own Dulce de Leche - super easy to make and well worth it.

Really good. Made these for a family bbq dinner and everyone loved them. Even me and I'm not usually a caramel lover. I left out the salt since I couldn't find the right kind. Will try this next time.

Delicious. I first tasted these at a picnic--someone brought them and and I asked for the recipe. Then I brought them to a party myself and people were asking me for the recipe. Haha. I guess they are pretty irresistible. I used the nestle brand of dulce de leche, recipe comes together very easily. The salt on top is key, don't leave it out.

These were good, but no wow factor. I used Goya brand Dulce de Leche, which has a thinner consistency than Farmhouse La Salamandra from Argentina. Next time will definitely use La Salamandra, because the quality of the Dulce de Leche is what makes this dessert. Don't leave off the sprinkling of Sea Salt -- really sets off the flavor nicely.

These were way too sweet and the consistency was sub-standard. I LOVE dulce de leche, creme brulee, flan, caramel... but these were a DON'T make again. Disappointed!

Easy, keeps very well and got raves. I find them a bit sweet, so may add more salt next time. I cut them into small bars and get about 4 dozen to a pan. Great for entertaining.

Just made these last night for a dinner party and EVERY person there asked for the recipe. One guest even confessed to eating an entire bar in the kitchen while plating them, so she was assured of getting at least two! Easy, scrumtious...the key is the proper dulce le leche; Nestle is inexpensive and just the right texture.

Really, really good. Maybe too good. My husband ate half the batch by himself. ;)

If you live in an area w/a sizable hispanic population then you can buy dulce de leche, also known as cajeta, at any ethnic market. I bought two cans, but for this recipe I only needed one 14.3 ounce can (guess I'm going to have make another batch.) The brand I bought is Nestle but it's made in Chile. It was less than $3 and absolutely delicious.

Fantastic! I am not a dessert lover so most sweets underwhelm me. Until now. These are spectacular. I took them to a potluck attended by foodies and they were the absolute hit of the evening. This will be my go to dessert recipe. Simply perfect!

SOOO yummy- made this as a gift for someone and kept a little for my self... came back to my dorm room and they were all gone- everyone ate them up! They were much messier than the photo.. but I probably could have refrigerated them for a bit longer- very very good and very easy to make! will be making them again soon!

I served these at a baby shower as part of a dessert buffet and they were the hit of the party! Several people asked for the recipe. Don't forget to add the salt! There were several of us that were skeptical about the salt but we were all believers in the end. It really makes the bars special! Thanks for a great recipe!

Made these for a quick dessert for guests, and they loved it. It is a must to have the Fleur de sel. It truly makes the dessert!!

I made these last week for our bbq. Fantastic! Even my husband asked about them and he is not a big sweet fan. Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe. Super easy. I found the dulce de leche in the grocery store in the ethnic section. Yummy! No fleur de sel though, although I would like to try it with it.

These sound wonderful. I have a very similar recipe that uses vanilla pudding as the filling and chocolate frosting. Very easy. We have a Whole Foods just down the street. Going to give this a try.

WOW! This recipe is just too delicious for words! I'm making them for the 2nd time in a week because I don't know if I can live without them. You can find Dulce de Leche at some specialty kitchen stores too...maybe Williams Sonoma has it? Stonewall Kitchens brand has a good one. I made my own and made extra so that I would have it when I "needed" it.

I agree that these are fabulous. to the fellow Portlander below, I found Dulce de Leche at Whole Foods. Spendy but very good. I also served these at a BBQ and accompanied them with fresh strawberries. A hit.

I made these for a BBQ this past weekend and they were a huge hit! Everyone raved. I couldn't find the dulce de leche (and I didn't know about the condensed milk trick until now) so I used a quality store-bought caramel sauce and they turned out amazing. The fleur de sel is such a great touch!

So delicious. They keep well if you have leftovers, but don't sprinkle the salt on ahead of time--it leaves funny little marks on the glaze the next day (still tastes perfect though).

Made this for a BBQ yesterday. I too made my own dulce de leche. Simmered the can for about 2 1/2 hours. Wish I would have done it longer but the cake turned out great. Great with strong black coffee this AM

So very, very good. Also very easy. I made the recipe exactly as written and it was perfect. I did make my own dulce de leche, as the store didn't have any. Instead of simmering sweetened condensed milk in the can (which I've done - it involves watching the water level and refilling fairly frequently), I poured it into a double boiler for the same amount of time (about 3 hours) until it looked like milk caramel.

Big hit. I made the dulce de leche (just simmered cans of sweetened condensed milk for 3 hours--you can find a detailed description on wikihow), but aside from the time involved with that, all came together very easily. The salt is great.

These are wonderful.. I made a batch and took them to work ... they were gone in 5 minutes. The Dulce de Leche can be found in any well stocked Mexican or latin American food store. Absolutely incredible
