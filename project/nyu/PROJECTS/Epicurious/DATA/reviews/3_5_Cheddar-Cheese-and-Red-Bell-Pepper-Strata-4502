Letting it sit overnight before baking is a must.

Oh, yes, and I let it sit overnight (essential) before baking.

Did a test run of the recipe as written. It was good, but I wanted more flavor, more veggies, and less fat. Made a second batch, using the recipe as a guide. My version: Roasted and peeled 2 red peppers. Sauteéd them in olive oil with slices of 2 fresh red onions and their greens. Added a hefty amount of fresh Greek oregano. Used challah, Irish cheddar and goat cheese. Substituted one cup of milk with Trader Joe's Roasted Red Pepper and Tomato soup (thanks to a Chowhound poster) and used fat-free milk. Doubled the Dijon. It was both visually appealing and delicious.

This was a hit at my brunch on Saturday. Even my picky husband said it was really good. I used an 11x17 inch casserole dish so I added 1 slice of bread, 1 egg, 1/4 cup milk. I chopped 3 med/small red bell peppers and 1 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. It must sit at least 6 hours before baking. I made it at 6 am and put it in the oven at noon.

This strata seemed pretty blah. I used mex blend cheese instead of cheddar and italian bread, so maybe that contributed. In any event, you definitely want to let it sit overnight b/f baking. The mushroom 3 cheese and spinach and cheese stratas on this site were much tastier.

This is crazy good. Perfect for a group. It is so much better than any other brunch dish I have ever made. Not at all dry and there is never any leftovers!

I made this for a casual supper and just wasn't blown away. Maybe the great reviews had me thinking it was going to be something more than just a basic strata. Not bad, not special. Got the job done, but that's it for me!

I made this for family visiting for the Thanksgiving holiday and it was very good. I accidently used Monterey Jack instead of cheddar and it was still good. I think cheddar would be better though. I was going to put crumbled bacon on top but served bacon on the side along with fruit for a nice breakfast.

Delicious. I have stopped making quiche or fritatas anytime our family has brunch. Everybody loves this. Even those who "say" they don't eat eggs. I always make it the night before.

Made this for Christmas morning. Did all the preparation the evening before. I used an 8 inch round dish, but would use a larger dish next time. The crunchy bread at the top was great and it would be better with more surface area.

I modified this extensively to use what I had on hand. In lieu of green onions, I used yellow (at about 1/2 of the required amount, since around here they are SO hot). About tripled the bell peppers, as I had some home-grown that were not long for this world. Also added lots of chopped garlic to the sauté mixture. We like our food spicy, but since the veggies were so hot, I chose not to use Pepper Jack cheese, and subbed Kraft American Cheese Singles that I just laid on top of the bread layers. (Worried if this would make it soupy, but it turned out nice and firm.) Omitted the salt--it didn't need any. VERY, VERY GOOD. Next time I would cover the strata for the first 20 minutes, as mine did get a bit overly browned (almost burned). Very yummy as a casual dinner. Served it with a mandarin orange jell-o salad.

I used sourdough bread and 2 percent milk, put in an extra egg, and let the strata sit overnight in the fridge before baking it. It had just the right amount of liquid when I did it that way. I think one of the great benefits of making a strata is that you CAN do it ahead of time and let it sit overnight. So I don't see the point of skipping that step.

This is an excellent strata! I was a little nervous about the other reviewer saying it was too soggy, so I used 3/4 of the liquid. It was still fantastic! I will definitely make this again.

I've made this several times for the brunch my dorm has for our graduating seniors, and everybody has loved it each time. I added sausage and spinach the first time. The last time I made it (a week ago), I totally forgot that I was supposed to make it until 2AM, but we happened to have lots of onions on hand, so I caramelized some onions and used them in place of the bell peppers - a really good combination as well.

This is my brunch standard, and I have yet to meet a soul who doesn't love it. Could that be because I'm a scary hostess and no one dares cross me? It's a fun thought, but more likely my guests really do enjoy it. I have never added mushrooms, never halved the recipe (though I have doubled it), and have never poked little cocktail umbrellas into it to try and make it more than it is --just a strata, folks, but a darn good one. Amen.

Way too soggy, I might have tried it again with less milk had my husband not asked me to never ever make this dish again. The taste wasn't bad but all the flavors seemed to be drowned out by the cheddar cheese.

This was great. I followed several posters and used 2% milk, omitted the red pepper and added sauteed mushrooms. I was nervous about using a strata recipe that didn't require overnight soaking but it turned out wonderfully. It's an easy, delicious brunch dish and everyone asked me for the recipe.

Tonight I made 1/2 of this recipe to serve 2 (yes, I used 1 1/2 eggs). For my 1/2 recipe I used 1/2 red bell and 1/2 green bell peppers, plus about 1 1/2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms, in addition to the required 1/2 cup of green onions. Used 2% milk. Baked it in an 8-1/2 by 4-1/2 inch glass bread loaf pan for about 40 minutes (rotating the dish after the first 20 minutes.) It was VERY GOOD!!! It made 2 generous portions.

Served this to my family for dinner tonight and everyone loved it! I was a little worried because I didn't have whole milk, only 2%, and the Christmas Wife Saver I make every year requires whole or it won't work. Anyway, it came out just great! I added sauteed mushrooms, an extra egg, and a yellow pepper as well as the red. I would highly recommend this dish for brekkie, lunch or dinner as it is just yummy!

This is always a hit, no matter when I serve it. I added green onions(2 chopped) and sausage(1 pound)as stated in a previous review. If you follow the recipe and take care to layer, the end result is a puffy, silky slice of heaven. Key to this recipe and most recipes' is to use it as a base and then make it your own!! Try it.....it is AWESOME

The dish definitely needs more veggies, maybe several colors of peppers. I served with vegetarian sausage on the side, which added flavor.

I was looking for a strata that didn't require overnight in the fridge and this is IT!! I've made it several times and recommended it to others. Of course I had to modify - adding fresh mushrooms to the green onion saute, leaving out the pepper, added either ham or cooked breakfast sausage and thawed chopped spinach. Excellent!!

Excellent, and very easy. I made this for a Boxing Day brunch and it was gobbled up immediately. A keeper for sure!

Delicious and very pretty. One red pepper is not enough. I used two which adds flavor and color. It's a dish that can be made ahead and reheated. All 8 friends loved it and asked for the recipe.

I've made this recipe several times and it is excellent. I would recommend using a very sharp cheddat cheese. Also, I would make sure that it is nice and golden on the top before taking it out of the oven.The inside is very moist so it is nice to have the contrast.

This dish is outstanding! I have made it 3 times now with raving reviews from my guests. It is wonderful because it is a dish that can be used for breakfast, lunch or dinner. I have found that using old bread makes it even better and I also let it sit with the egg mixture for a while prior to baking. Definitely a keeper of a recipe for a busy family with kids!!

Served it for brunch and had raves - only change -I added extra egg. This is a keeper - very quick, easy and delicious.

I only had a green pepper, so I used that. It was okay - maybe I'm not a strata person

This dish was delicious. Next time, I will not make it ahead--it is gorgeous when it comes out of the oven. I used an 11*7 pan, and added one slice of bread, 1 egg, and 1/4 c milk, and it was great.

Great brunch dish. I added a layer of mustard greens for kick and used the "fake eggs". Wonderful texture and everyone had seconds (and thirds).

I use this recipe as a base for other stratas (stratae?) and it transforms very accommodatingly. Spinach (wilt it over the red peppers), feta cheese, fresh basil, jalapenos...I think it's better when you liven it up a bit.

This recipe was delicious. I accidentally put in a little too much butter (all 3 Tablespoons when cooking the peppers and onions,) but it was wonderful. I made it the day before and let it sit overnight in the fridge, which the recipe doesn't say you can do, but it got rave reviews.

A very easy and tasty dish. It is especially spectacular when first taken from the oven -- it rises beautifully, but sinks again after the 10 minute waiting period before serving. Delicious.

I substituted feta cheese instead of cheddar and it really made this dish delicious. And you can't beat it for simplicity. I would definately make this again

A very satisfying dish. I served this at a Sunday Brunch and everyone raved about it. A number of our guests asked for the recipe.

It's nothing specatular. It is easy to make but I don't feel that I would make it again. They are the ingredients you would always have on hand though.

Easy to make. Looks appetizing because of the colors. Nice flavor. Reheats well in microwave. Next time I might add mushrooms and/or bacon.

We liked it as a light supper when we couldn't decide what to eat.. often have these ingredients on hand. I added a few strips of crisp bacon on top before baking. Also, we sprinkled it with a pepper sauce before eating for extra kick!
