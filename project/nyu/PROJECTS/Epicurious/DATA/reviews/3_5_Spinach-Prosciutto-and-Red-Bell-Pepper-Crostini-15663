Excellent. I added mozz cheese b/c the parm cheese we had was grated and I was concerned w/ it melting. I also added a dab of balsamic glaze I had on hand which added to flavor, but I think this recipe is great.

Very tasty. I've also made this recipe using kale from my CSA box (stemmed, boiled in water for 5 minutes, cooled, squeezed dry, then chopped) and thought that it was equally good. I usually add a little more heavy cream, and prefer it with diced roasted red bell pepper instead of the sauteed bell pepper strips.

Yum, yum, yum! The flavor was very nice and they're very pretty. My picky 10-year-old even liked them. I followed the suggestion of the Cook from Austin and used chopped frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry, instead of the fresh spinach. Other than that, made them exactly as the recipe states. Watch them carefully under the broiler, they don't take long.

This was good, although I think one could cut out a few steps (spinach saute & chopping) by using frozen chopped spinach which has been thawed & squeezed dry...then do a quick saute w/ the prosciutto, garlic & cream to blend the flavors. The presentation is nice, however.

Think there are better crostini's out there. I would add more whipping cream next time as I felt it to be a bit dry, especially after it sat out for awhile at cocktail party. Presentation is pretty and overall flavors are nice but not "saucy" enough.

These were a big hit at my christmas party, even picky eaters ate them.

I thought this recipe was delicious. I didn't need to add any extra salt though, finding it salty enough with the prosciutto and parmesan. Got rave reviews from all my guests and not one was left on the plate.

This was pretty good. I prefer other crostini recipes, though.

My Mother-In-Law ate them without comment. This is high praise!

Excellent. Made the recipe according to directions and salt was fine (may depend on the prosciutto used). This was a wonderful first course and I will make it again for a lunch dish.

Great flavor and color - it is salty so you may want to go light on the parm cheese on top.

Contrary to a previous review, our batch of crostini required added salt. Somewhat time consuming to make but results are colorful and delicious.

This dish was an instant hit with -- get this -- a crowd of young teenagers. I get requests for this appetizer again and again, and need to make a double recipe! Easy to prepare ahead, but I like to toast the bread rounds just before assembly.

Quite delicious and beautiful presentation for the holidays. My one word of advice is to remember that prosciutto is very salty and parmesan or romano cheese is too. Avoid any extra salt on this appetizer.

A very good snack item which can be prepared well in advance to avoid last minute hassels. Only care should be taken while storing it after it has been assembeled.
