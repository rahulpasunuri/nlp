I'm newly gluten free and vegan and was happy to find this recipe. I followed the advice of previous reviews ans added 1/2 tsp each of dried basil, parsley and oregano. This was delicious served over polenta. It also freezes and reheats very well!

I added oregano and half of a red pepper, I used low sodium broth instead of water and I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced. This really seemed to sweeten and spice up the sauce from when I had made it in the past according to the recipe!

This is a bit bland but has great potential. I added about a cup of mushroom slices, and whirled up all the aromatics in the food processor before adding them to the hot oil. I finished it with about 2 tsp of crushed rep pepper flakes, used veg broth instead of water, and finally, stirred in about 1/4 cup of half and half to give it that silky finish. I threw a cheese rind into it as it simmered. My son thought it had meat in it.

Way too bland. Sadly lacking in body, richness and flavor -- all things one wants in a pasta sauce. Followed the recipe and cooked this in a slow cooker. Not much can save this... a little balsamic vinegar helped, but this was a true disappointment.

Fantastic! I did use vegetable stock rather than water and made a couple of other changes to simplify it. After sauteeing the vegetables I just added the tomato paste, cans of pre-diced tomatoes (including the liquid) and the veg stock together with the lentils. It's sooooo delicious! Sometimes I also sneak in some pureed sweet potato to up the nutrients and since that thickens it, some low-sodium V8 too :O)

I made this with a couple of changes/additions after reading the reviews. Instead of water I used chicken stock to add more flavor. I added one teaspoon of crushed red pepper, just before simmering. Just before it was done simmering (about 2 minutes) I added one cup of freshly chopped spinach. I served it over some cheese tortellini, just because I had it on hand. It was delicious! I would make this again. I'm forwarding the recipe to some friends who have trouble finding good vegan recipes.

Love the smell of this and the taste, can't wait to sink my teeth into a nice big bowl of this. Perfect for a snowy day.

Tried it and loved it. Will be making again, for sure.

Mm! So good! I felt like cooking, I only baked up until this point, and I'm still in high school and have never cooked before, only watched my parents. Made this for my family for fun and it was so tasty and absurdly easy! I got two 28 oz cans of tomatoes and used the leftover juice instead of water when it says to add it when it starts to dry out towards the end. I also had pre-chopped onions and carrots, and I would recommend busy people to do this with the chopped stuff because that adds a lot of time! Filled my house with tasty smells!

BLAND! I added hot pepper flakes and vinegar at the end, but nothing helped.

Very tasty, a nice variation for pasta. However, next time I would do 2 things differently. The french lentils took forever to cook, so I would not reduce the tomato sauce before adding them - I had to add tons of water. Also, I wanted a bit more tomato sauce taste, so I added a little sauce from a jar. I also added a little dried italian seasoning.

Excellent easy dish - worked very well in the slow cooker on low. Did vegetables on stove top then mixed remaining ingredients into slow cooker, covered, went to work and voila dinner was done when I came home. Was plenty left over and children loved it.

Wonderfully delicious! A make again! Prepared as directed and it was hearty, filling,flavorful and a pretty easy dinner despite the simmer time for the lentils.
