Delicious! I used puff pastry, homemade pesto (see recipe on site) and grated mozzarella. It was easy and fast. The guests at my party ate them all.

Fun and easy to make. I didnt have any swiss cheese slices so I used laughing cow speadable swiss light and crumbled it onto the phyllo dough. As a result the cheese came out fluffy and light. I also made my own pesto so that I could use less oil.

I haven't tried this yet, but it looks simple and delicious. Perfect for my sister-in-law's upcoming bridal shower. Note to the cook who found that the phyllo tore because of the thickness of the cheese; You're not making a jelly roll, you're making a parcel by wrapping the cheese in a lovely light crispy phyllo shell.

I don't know if I bought the wrong type of phyllo dough, but the sheets were so so thin that when I tried to roll them up, the cheese tore through. The recipe calls for 1/2 thick slices and cheese this thick would require twice as many sheets of dough. After I pulled them out of the oven, the rolls were sitting in a pool of olive oil from the pesto and the melted cheese had oozed out all over. Extremely messy, greasy and unattractive. They tasted good, but looked horrible. This would work much better with thinner slices of cheese, less pesto and more dough.

Talk about an easy (and inexpensive) appetizer! I used puff pastry instead of phyllo,shredded mozzarella instead of the swiss, and made a day in advance, wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated. When I got to my sisters house I just baked and sliced! 3 people asked for the recipe!

I found this recipe last summer, and they were a hit. Since then, we've been making all sorts of variations - try these with smoked mozzarella and proscuitto, or add some roasted red pepper...the possibilities are endless...

Made this again for a weekend party and it was a hit. Had all the ingredients and needed a quick appetizer. This was it. Tasty, attractive, and easy. You can make them the day before, covered in fridge, brush with butter before baking and serve.

First time in my life I used frozen phyllo and it was not so difficult at all. Next time I won´t use so much butter any more as it was really heavy and giving too much calories! But taste was perfect and my guests and husband really loved it! I did not have any swiss cheese, so I used both feta and mozarella and espcially together with pesto it was so tasty!

I've been making this receipe for years, and it is ALWAYS a hit! Substituting grated cheese for the slices makes these easier to roll. I've also made the recipe with puff pastry, which is equally delicious.

I buy fresh phyllo at the Greek market so it makes these pastries especially easy to make. I also substituted grated mozzarella for the swiss. They were a hit!
