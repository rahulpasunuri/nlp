Awesome. Easy to make. Used burrata from trader joes; I think it was pretty good. Also added a bed of arugula under the burrata and salsas. Made two of the tomato salsas, one without garlic because I dislike garlic. The cook from Vancouver BC may be right that pre-made store-bought tapenade would do the trick, so in the future I'll try that to save even more time.

EXCELLENT!! Both salsas were easy to make and very good. I served the salsas separately from the cheese with the baguette slices and that worked great. Big hit with company and ME!

This was a good, solid appetizer for a dinner party - burrata/mozza kept it nice and light for summer and it was very tasty. The only change I made was to slow-roast the tomatoes at a lower temperature because it's not quite fresh- tomato season here and I wanted to make sure they tasted good. All of that said, I probably won't make this again because the flavours were not that different from store-bought tapenade and tomato jams and didn't warrant the extra time & work.
