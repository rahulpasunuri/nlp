Fabulous! Would make it again in a heart beat. Add just a bit more lemon juice - so good!

This turned out beautifully! After reading about blandness from previous reviews, I looked in the kitchen for some on-hand flavor help. I added torn fresh basil & sage; along with 1 small chopped tomato; some sliced red bell pepper; 2t minced fresh ginger; about 1T more tomato paste; and a little more wine at the end. For some heat, I also put in a small minced Serrano pepper. To the chicken I added white pepper while it browned. I am glad I took the time to grind some shrimp to add to the sauce. I used one of those tiny handheld KitchenAid blenders to grind it quickly, rather than having to clean the food processor and all its parts. Very flavorful, served over GABA brown rice, next to steamed broccoli.

I made the recipe exactly as is and it came out great. My mom and her very picky friend both loved it. I served with rice and roasted brussel sprouts and a chardonnay.

WOW. That is tasty! Pretty simple too. Very quick to cook, make sure everything is ready.. Used Les Martinieres ($10) for wine. I also couldn't find rock shrimp, so I used white shrimp and it worked well.

What drew me in was the red cream sauce. I seasoned to my taste but I pretty much followed the recipe. I really enjoyed this dish. I recommend this recipe to anyone who is willing to improvise a little.

FORGET ABOUT TOMATOE PASTE! This recipie cries out for a white cream sause (especially if it has lemon in it). I did however chop up some fresh tomates from my garden and sprinkled over the chicken just before serving. That made for an excellent presentation, and gave it an outstanding taste. I sprinkled some hot peppers to give it a little zip. I think the ground up shrimp was a waste of time, the shrimp will impart enough flavor into the sauce without that step. Next time, I will use a thickening agent for the sauce (flour or corn starch) and serve over pasta. The recipie didn't much resemble the one I found here, but it was quite good, and has alot of possiblilites.

This was an amazing recepie! I left out the lemon juice, and it was still a very tasty meal...and my husband LOVED it. The sauce reminded me of shrimp bisque so if you like that taste you won't be disappointed.

I made this with tilapia filets instead of chicken. It was quite tasty.

this recipe is so easy to cook. my husband loves it. but i altered a bit of the ing. instead of 1/4C cream, i put 1C. i added a few dashes of both dried thyme and rosemary to the sauce as well. put a little salt as to perk up the flavor too. thanks!

I left the chicken in the freezer and used the sauce on top of a pan-seared steelhead trout. Added onions and sauteed them with garlic in the first step. The light amount of tomato paste is perfect with fish. This would be very good with blackened fish.

A litte bit too much tomato. Would make it again but with a cream based sauce.

Bland. Boring. Too many other good chicken recipes. Will not make again.

I made this dish exact to the recipe and it was kind of bland. it definately needs a lot of extra spices and such. if you have the time to keep playing with this recipe, i think it could turn out pretty good

I made this last night and it was very good. I am big on spices so I added a lot of extra herbs and spices to mine. It was great.

When I made this dish, I took the advice of previous cooks and added additional tomato paste and just cooked the chicken breasts in the oven while I cooked the shrimp. I also added a little basil and crushed red pepper to spice it up a bit, and it turned out wonderful. It's so simple that I'll definitely make it again.

What a great, tasty, and easy recipe. Both my very finicky son and very picky boyfriend loved it so it has become a common dinner for me to rely on. I use the rock shrimp from Trader Joe's. I shared this w/ a co-worker and it is now a staple in her house as well.

My husband and I loved it, and I would make it for company. I increased the tomato paste to about 4 tablespoons; I can see how others would think it bland without this. Very easy and quick to make.

At fist I wondered why I needed to have shrimp ground into the sauce - until I tasted it! This really upped the intensity of the flavor. Before I made it I did not realize how easy this was as I prepared enough to freeze for another meal. There was no need - the frozen sauce only lasted a day! This was great.

Very so-so and not worth the effort. I don't think this is a natural combination -- the shrimp sauce does not complement the chicken breasts. Just very bland, all around.

Rating: 2
Okay but not worth a repeat. The sauce was missing depth of flavor. And a chicken breast is a chicken breast. Not necessary to put the chicken in the oven. I served this over Orzo pasta.

My family and I really liked this recipe, even the fussy kid who doesn't like shrimp! Didn;t have any rock shrimp, so I also just used small shrimp. Will definitely make again!!

I could not find rock shrimp. I used small shrimp instead. It turned out very tasty. The sauce was great. I served it with pasta on the side and poured the extra sauce over the pasta.

Made this dish last night with pasta instead of rice, which was delicious. In the interest of time (and hunger), I didn't bother running the shrimp through the blender, and it came out just fine. One thing- the recipe suggests putting the chicken breasts in the oven to "cook through", which I found to be completely unneccessary- the easiest way to ruin chicken breasts is to overcook them, making them hard and dry. I put the chicken in the oven only long enough to keep warm while cooking the shrimp- just a few minutes- and they were perfect and juicy.
