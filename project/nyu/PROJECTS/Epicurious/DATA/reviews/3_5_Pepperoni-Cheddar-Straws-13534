Favorite appetizer - can be made ahead.

Everyone loves these - they take a significant amount of time to make, but dough can be made week ahead.

These were pretty good, but a little greasy. They were actually better the second day.

Great flavor, but much more work than I expected. If you have time, though, these are worth trying. For an appetizer with a similar flavor but half the preparation time, use the recipe for Baked Cheddar Olives (this website), but use pepperoni rather than green olives.

Here's the recipe party-givers always ask me to bring when I'm in charge of an hors d'ouevre -- and the one that never makes it all the way around the room before the plate needs to be refilled. Word of caution: this recipe is enough for a large party and can easily be halved. They store very well, too.
