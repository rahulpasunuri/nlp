I didn't want a cream-cheese taste, just a little more spreadability for my homemade goat cheese which tends to be a bit crumbly for spreading. So I used half the called-for cream cheese. Very good!

Good recipe. I prepared it with creme fraiche for that extra tang and it was really good. I also added a little lemon juice to this as well...

To BKuo: It is not the number of ingredients that makes a recipe good or not. For example, would you say that a caramel recipe is dumb because all it calls for is sugar? Yet, it takes skills to make it good. As for being dumb, well, people's reviews say more about who they are than they think. Grow up.

I used my own home made pesto (Barefoot Contessa), 1 small log of peppered goat cheese and 6 oz. full fat cream cheese...very good! On the side I had extra pesto and a small bowl of black olive tapenade from Pasolivo Olive Ranch in Cali. Served with Stacy's Naked Chips with Sea Salt. I made the pesto dip the day before so it had a chance to get very full flavored.

easy and okay. Pesto didn't really come through too well. Not nearly as good as goat cheese and pistachio spread from Gourmet, 1992. I make that one a lot and it's great even without pistachios.

This recipe is so unbelievably simple and absolutely fantastic! Had tons of pesto and wanted to find a recipe for it--brought this to several parties and everyone has raved. Made exactly as is. Put a little basil bud on top of the dish and you are gourmet!

This was VERY good. And talk about easy? I made this at my desk for a company pot luck. I had visions of spreading it on a sandwich for dinner, but there was none left. Can't wait to make this again!

simple, simple, simple to make and man, is it tasty (even with storebought pesto)!

Delicious! I used local goat cheese, organic cream cheese, and homemade pesto from the recipe for GREEN BEANS WITH PECAN PESTO. I put most of my time into making the pesto (toasted the pecans, bruised the parsley but not the cilantro, blanched the garlic, and used less oil than recipe suggested) and I think this paid off. So many delicate flavors! I will definitely make this again.

Easy to make and delicious. I used Buitoni pesto and served it with the little French crackers that look like miniature toast slices.

Very good, very easy. I served it on small slices of ciabatta, with a couple pieces of julienned sun-dried tomato for a nice, colorful appetizer.

I love this recipe! We make it with the Bon Appetit pesto, which is very garlicky. We either spread it on french bread rounds and toast in the oven or serve cold on Carr's water crackers.

I swapped regular pesto for sun-dried tomato pesto, and frankly I bought it off the shelf in the local grocery (Safeway Select brand). I also used reduced fat Philly cream cheese and Montrachet goat cheese. Clearly there are individuals with more discerning tastebuds than mine reviewing this recipe, because even with basic no-frills products it was delicious. Don't like the consistency? Try warming it in the microwave (be sure to stir every 30 seconds. Served it with crunchy panetini, also off the store shelf.

I love goat cheese and pesto. Although I liked this recipe, I can't say I loved it. A suggestion about the cream cheese component: the Wed. Oct. 2, 2002 issue of the New York Times newspaper (www.nytimes.com) published an article in the Dining and Wine section titled "Why This Cheese Stands Alone", about freshly-made cream cheese fom Zingerman's Creamery in Manchester, MI. It's made from local cow's milk, sea salt, rennet and cream, without vegetable gums and stabilizers. It's reportedly soft, creamy, and dense - not gummy. It's available from (888) 636-8162 or from www.zingermans.com

I made this at the last minute for a party, I thought this was good but the consistency of mine was way too thick. I added a spoonful of plain yogurt which made it easier to spread (more creamy). Again I thought this was "good", but I can easily see how it would be world's better if I had used a better quality goat cheese and cream cheese and homemade pesto...next time!

I will make this one again using my own pesto. I made it rather last minute using a store bought pesto (Harry's brand) and it was WAY too garlicky, which says a lot given that garlic is used daily around here. I plan to make this again this week.

This is a great recipe! I can't stop eating it. Served it at my dinner partywith sliced baguette, everyone loved it. I follwed the pesto instructions as well. I would change it a bit next time: Less basil and more cheese.

I thought this was very good. I made it with homemade pesto that I had on hand, but would not hesitate to make it again with purchased pesto. I served it with toasted baugette slices, prior to an Italian themed dinner party. Very, very good!

To the cook from Toronto. Try the Big Carrot on Danforth - they carry sheep's milk products from Milky Way Farm. They make a fresh cheese that is a little like a cross between goats milk and cream cheese. Or you could try their yogurt and make yogurt cheese as a substitute for cream cheese - it will be more tart but good nonetheless.

This is delicious. I used store bought pesto and drained alot of the oil out before adding it to the goat chees/cream cheese mixture. Blend in the cuisinar top with toasted pine nuts and serve with rice crackers both plain and sesame flavored that you buy in the oriental food section. All my friends have asked for the recipe.

This is very, very good. My husband and I like it on Wheat Thins.

I agree with other reviewers, I adjusted the ingredients to taste. Next time I would use less goat cheese and more pesto. Definitely needs to come to room temp for best flavor. I used my own pesto recipe with walnuts instead of pine nuts. Much more to my liking.

My family liked it better than I did. I used the Philadelphia cream cheese and the best goat cheese I could find and yes, it was a bit pasty. So, I doubled the pesto and got a satisfactory result.

I'm sorry to break the 100% - would - make - it - again streak, but I just wasn't crazy about this recipe. I thought it was very heavy tasting. Maybe light cream cheese would make it less thick and heavy.

This didn't knock my socks off when I first tasted it, but I really liked it better when I took a sip of wine, a Spanish red. A great match! They complimented each other. Thanks, All, for the recommendation to use premium cream cheese.

I DID make this recipe, and it certainly is very, very good. Seeing all the conversations about cream cheese, I used mascarpone that I had on hand. It was wonderfully creamy. Definitely added to the Keeper list. In fact...try a dollap on your next steak instead of herbed garlic butter...like we did last night...It was WONDERFUL.

I'd like to make this recipe, but have recently discovered that I need to avoid cow's milk and cheese made from cow's milk. But I love the taste of cream cheese. Has anyone got any ideas how to substitute something made with goat's milk (that has the same lovely flavour and texture?). Thanks in advance! Love this website!!

I havenn't made this but I will! It sounds wonderful. To answer the question about real cream cheese, go to any upscale market - to their cheese section and you will find cream cheese, usually plainly wrapped. I think that is what they are referring to. Philly would probably be ok - it's just a little jel like.

I have to admit it. I didn't actually make this recipe. But I wanted to share what I do for special events. I use a souffle dish and layer roasted red pepper, goat cheese and pesto, with the roasted red pepper on final layer at top. It is delicious and everyone has loved it, but it is very costly, so I do reserve it for special events. The only caveat is that it's hard to slice through the peppers. It might be more eater-friendly to chop and stir it all together, but not as elegant!

A cook from Brazil Please, ST. Louis, what is real cream cheese?

A great and quick spread. I used homemade pesto. I make pesto every fall before my basil dies and freeze it in ice cube trays. After it is frozen, I pop out the cubes and I place them in zippy freezer bags. Fresh pesto all year long!

I also make a layered version of this spread (adding chopped garlic to the cream cheese/goat cheese layer) - it works really well in molds. I like to do it in the Wilton Christmas Tree mold and add pine nuts in the pesto layer, as well as for garnish along with roasted red pepper circles and tiny basil leaves to decorate. Chopped sun-dried tomatoes add a nice touch, too. Just line any mold with wet cheese cloth before you fill it and it will come out beautifully with a wonderful texture.

I haven't rated this recipe, but have a question about "real cream cheese, not Philadelphia", as mentioned by St. Louis. Can someone clarify what this is, where to get it and how to ask for it? Any name brands? Available at a supermarket? Many thanks!

I make a variant of this spread, the extra ingredient is 3oz finely chopped sundried tomatoes, then I arrange the spread by forming layers of cheese, pesto, cheese, tomatoes and cheese. It's a real crowd pleaser.

This was served (though with 50:50 proportions) at a lobster bake/fish fry on Prince Edward Island and I've served a half-dozen times since. It makes up in a flash. Splurge on good goat cheese and real cream cheese (no Philadelphia) and you'll be in heaven.

This creamy spread is wonderful also with chicken salad!! One of my new favorites!!!
