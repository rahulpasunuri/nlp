The first time I made this, I used chicken thighs and breasts, and 2 tsp. chipotle powder, because that was what I had. I made a cabbage slaw with a sweet and sour vinaigrette, rather than the brussels slaw (raw brussels sprouts have no appeal for me), and made mini slider buns. It was absolutely, gimme-more delicious, and a huge hit at my daughter's bridal shower. Everyone asked for the recipe.

I followed the recipe almost exactly...omited the chipotles all together...and they were delicious. I got a little carrying away trying to remove all of the tendons and as much of that stuff before cooking, I won't take that time again as they fall right off. Enjoy!
