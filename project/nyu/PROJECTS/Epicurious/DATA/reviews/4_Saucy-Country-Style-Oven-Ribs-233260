Tender and great sauce! Did not have horseradish. Took advice of other reviewers and simmered bone-in pork ribs in combination of Guiness stout and water, reducing time to @20 minutes and baked covered for 45 minutes and uncovered for 35 minutes.

This was lovely. I simmered the ribs in beer rather than water and used scant measurements for the honey and vinegar. All else per the recipe. Served with steamed rice and sautéed kale and walnuts (Epicurious). Yum!

My mother actually made this for Labor Day and although they took a while, they were incredible. We used buffalo ribs instead of pork and I must say they are considerably better. I would call this the ultimate American holiday meal.

This is one of my "go-to" recipes. The best rib sauce I've ever tasted, anywhere. Meat falls off the bone. I love garlic so added a few more cloves; used apple cider vinegar, adds a wee bit more sweetness and used a smooth horseradish - 2 tbs. Family and friends rave and I'm the "great chef"!

Very good and fast recipe. Was out of cider vinegar and used malt vinegar instead. Was a little sweet and will try sugar free honey next time I make this, which is probably today

I made this recipe exactly as written. My "ribs" turned out fork tender. The sauce...I don't understand all the raves about the sauce. It is a bit too sweet and a bit too tangy, we could really smell the cider vinegar while cooking (practically made my eyes burn when I took them out of the oven) and the amout of honey and ketchup made it just too sweet. Next time will adjust those amounts and add something with heat/smokiness to give the sauce some depth of flavor, and dare I say a bit of sophistication? This sauce actually tasted like ketchup, mustard and sugar mixed together with a bit of vinegar.

A new family favorite! I have to be careful not to over-boil the ribs before baking. The meat falls off the bone and people use bread to sop up the sauce- delicious!

Fantastic sauce recipe, and dish overall very easy to make. Made the recipe exactly as written, and I found the pork very moist and tender. To those who had problems with tenderness - the key here is simmering, not boiling, the pork. If it boils it will be dry and a bit tough. Will be trying a crockpot adaptation this week.

I prefer to steam ribs rather than boil them and did so for 45 minutes. Then covered them in sauce, then foil, and cooked for 30 minutes, with a final 20 minutes uncovered. They were fall-off-the-bone tender. I liked this sauce because it wasn't overly sweet as rib sauces tend to be. I did add a teaspon of Tabsasco just to balance the flavours. All in all, a great recipe.

The white meat was overcooked; the dark meat was tender and juicy. Next time I'll cut the parboiling time in half, and check the ribs after 45 minutes in the oven.

The sauce was tasty, but the meat itself was a bit dried out.

This delivers what it promises - sweet & tangy ribs. Though I prefer somewhat bolder/more robust bbq flavors, the sauce isn't too sweet, and it does have a little underlying heat, which is nice. Boiled 3.25# ribs for 15min, smoothed out the sauce with an immersion blender, baked covered in the 13x9 (I would kill for a dutch oven) for 1 hour, checked the ribs (still pretty rubbery), loosened the foil a bit (poked a few holes in the top) baked 20 minutes more, then 20 minutes uncovered to thicken up the sauce. Not meltingly tender, but appetizingly tender, sweet & tangy ribs. Served with roasted garlic mashers & a fresh salad.

My hunt for a good rib recipe is over. Mine turned out very tender and very tasty even though I didn't have horse radish or worcestershire sauce. I will now always keep the ingredients around so that I can whip these up whenever I want to. They are easy to make. I par boiled mine for an extra half hour and cooked them in the oven a little longer as well. We froze the leftovers and when we ate them two weeks later, they were even better.

This was a great easy meal for a winter night. My fiance, who doesn't eat BBQ or ribs, loved this. The pork wasn't falling apart, but it was still tender and moist. I made garlic mashed potatoes while the pork roasted. The leftovers will be delicious in a sandwich tomorrow.

I have been cooking country style ribs for many years and although this recipe sounds okay, Searing the ribs on the grill , covering the ribs with a good quality bottled barbecue sauce and wrapping in foil, and cooking at a low temp for an hour or two , is a pretty good thing.

Rating: 4
I really love this sauce! My addition to this recipe is that I rub each piece of pork with my favorite homemade rub. Let this rub work for at least a couple of hours and oven broil or quick grill your pork pieces until just browned. Transfer to your baking vessel and coat with sauce, then follow recipe as stated. YUM!

THE best ribs I have ever had, and I've had a lot of ribs. I made a few substitutions and minor changes for my personal taste. I used Sandwich Pal Jalapeno mustard in addition to dry, and extra horseradish, though my HR was very mild. I used Lime vs Lemon only cause I was out but after comparing, now think I prefer it with Lime. cooked mine in a cast iron pan and virtually burnt the onions and garlic before hand (intentionally). I really like that hard edge-burnt onion taste in there, as well as in many foods. Excellent when cooked as is, and simply over the top when seasoned to taste. I will try just a few smoked chipotle peppers in adobo on my next try. I would not substitute out the honey for love-nor-money. Imho, that honey instead of brown sugar is THE key to why this is so superior to anything I've had before. I threw frozen ribs in to boil without altering the time. And on my second try, I put my ribs in the 9x13 pan and then went almost 1/2 depth with the water they were boiled in, then poured the sauce on top. I felt it made the ribs more tender with the water in the bottom of the baking pan. I am going to make this sauce in bulk and can it for everyday use. Simply the best BBQ sauce I have ever had, and so simple. THANKS Linda!

I doubled the horseradish, used brown sugar and added some cayenne and smoked paprika for a little bit of spiciness. This recipe was delicious and makes fantastic pulled-pork leftovers after fat removal. I will definitely make this again. It would be a great party dish. We ate leftovers as sliders with "homemade" dinner rolls and diced red onion.

I followed the suggestions - "Like the Morgan Hill, Calif. reviewer, I too used bottled sauce (Stubs) instead of making my own. I also used her method and I have to say that it works very well. In case you missed it - I boiled the ribs for 20 mins., covered with 1/2 jar sauce then baked covered for 45 mins and uncovered for 30 mins. This made them tender enough to cut them with a fork!" And the ribs turned out very tender, my husband and I love it! However, the texture is not like that of TGIF's since TGIF's is probably baked/ grilled throughout, giving it a rougher texture where the meat flakes off more than this version which relies on boiling the meat. I've used this recipe twice and going for a third now...

Rating: 4
K, heres what I did. I tried this recipe 3 times as directed and the ribs were never as tender as I wanted. This time, I broiled them for about 15 minutes until browned, stuck them in my crock pot w/the sauce ingredients for 10 hours on low. I added a little unsweetened cocoa. I think it was the best of my 4 attempts.

These ribs are terrific, the sauce is amazing - and the leftovers make the best pulled pork sandwiches you can imagine. Will definitely make again. I substituted brown sugar for the honey, and tomato paste watered down to ketchup consistency. Took reviewer suggestions and only boiled the meat for 15 minutes and cooked in a dutch oven instead of a baking dish. I only left the lid ajar and did not completely uncover for the last part of cooking. I think it's important to use country-style ribs (not bone- in ribs) to achieve the moist, fork- tender results. Hard to believe how delicious the result is, using the cheapest cut of meat at the market. Bonus!

There are a number of reasons that I enjoyed this recipe. First of all it very tasty. Definitely added it to my list of recipes to make over and over again. The other reasons are: it is for a cheap cut of meat, the ingredients are stock items, and it is easy to assemble. All you need is a stay at home Saturday afternoon or a day off to be at home as it cooks. Another reason that I like this dish it that it is a rib dish that does not require grilling. I live in an apartment, therefore, grilling is not possible. I would recommend this as a winter dish, because it is a little heavy for the summer months. The sauce would be excellent with mash potatoes.

These were delicious. I made them as written except that I reduced the time they were boiled to begin with and used bone-in ribs. The sauce was perfect-not too sweet or spicy. Everyone raved about the flavor, not to mention the delicious smells coming from the kitchen. Exactly what I was looking for in a good oven-baked rib recipe that didn't take all day to put together.

Loved the sauce, but. I made as written, only subsituting brown sugar for the honey. The meat was dry. Next time, I will cook the ribs, without parboiling, in the slowcooker. As for the sauce, I will not precook the onions, there is no need if using a slowcooker. I will let the sauce cool, and skim the fat. Then I will puree it in the blender, to achieve more of a traditional BBQ sauce texture. Matter of fact, I'm making it now, using pork butt instead of ribs, for pulled pork for 25.

I've made this recipe several times with no issues with the meat being tough. There is nothing like homemade barbecue sauce. I never use bottled. This one is delicious, and like most homemade barbecue sauce recipes, lends itself to the cook's ministrations to add heat (chipotles, cayenne), swap sweetness (maple syrup, Yoshida's Gourmet sauce), smokiness (smoked paprika) add other 'stuff' (black bean garlic sauce, hoisin sauce). I'm not suggesting that any of these changes were needed, but rather that the sauce offers a wonder canvas on which to paint your preferences or indulge your creativity. We had it last night....a break from holiday fare!

I halved the sauce for one large rack. Delicious and disappeared quickly. Boiled for about 15 minutes, baked at 250 for 1 hour wrapped tightly, then uncovered for 20 minutes then flipped 'em and cooked them for 20 minutes more. Finished with 10 minutes on the grill. Sounds like a lot of cooking - but they were moist, tender and yummy.

Interesting choice on boiling then baking the ribs. I boiled for 15 minutes, as suggested). Baked it in a aluminum foil packet, uncovered for the final roast. Could deal with a slower, lower temperature cooking, but the sauce is damn good.

The sauce makes it. Pass it around in a gravy boat. We enjoyed this recipe even more the next day when we pulled apart the pork and heated in the sauce for sandwiches on toasted sandwich rolls. Fed 5 hungry people for two meals.

Well, here's the thing, i have two babies under the age of two so I don't have the time to MAKE a sauce. Here's what I did: 3 1/2 lbs of boneless pork ribs, boil for 20 mins., pour 1/2 a bottle of KC Masterpiece Hickory Brown Sugar Sauce all over them, bake covered for 45 mins. @ 350 degrees, uncover and bake for another 30 mins. EXCELLENT!!! My babies loved it, my husband loved it, my teenager loved it. 'NUFF SAID.

I finally signed up to rate this amazing recipe! First off, I only use bone-in country ribs and followed the advice of another reviewer and added chipolte pepers to kick up the flavor. I do not boil for very long, maybe 7-10 mins and am not sure if I need to boil them at this point but I always do. The one thing that ensures my success is that I cook them in the oven in a LeCreuset Dutch oven. The first time I made the recipe, the ribs can out a little dry so the next time I used my dutch oven and the ribs fell off the bone! I have made them for my family several times after that and has become a family favorite. I have even doubled and tripled the recipe for larger crowds. Try it! You will not be disappointed!

Good sauce. Added 4 canned chipotle peppers gave it great flavor. Would watch the cooking time, my ribs were so lean I only simmered them 5 min, in oven for 20 min, and still could have used a slightly shorter cook time.

Rating: 3
I rated this three forks, but with my changes it would be 4 forks. Due to other reviews I only simmered the ribs for 15 minutes. Once I had the sauce going on the stove I tasted it and while it was OK, it was nothing special. I added a teaspoon of a spicy smoked paprika (thanks for the idea, savannah cook!) and that elevated it to a whole different level. I think instead of the smoked paprika, a couple of minced chipotles in adobo would have been nice too. The only other change I made was using just over 2 lbs. of ribs but using the same amount of sauce (we are sauce people).

Made these tonight; very good. I was low on mustard seed, and experimented with adding some smoked Spanish paprika (pimenton de la vera). It added a really nice smokiness. I also shortened the boiling time, per other reviews, and the ribs were very tender.

Made these tonight for my family and they were very good, but a little too tangy. I used bone-in ribs and they were very tender. Prepared them early in the day, refrigerated and baked later and turned out fine. Will make them again, but try to mellow the sauce a little.

I made these ribs last night for my family of 3, but did halve the recipe. I thought the sauce was a bit tart, but used it without any changes and it was great once it baked with the ribs. I lined the baking dish with foil and pulled it up around the ribs and sauce which worked well and made for easy cleanup. I'll certainly make this recipe again. My family loved it. I was also suprised to find that the author of the recipe is from my community!

Rating: 4
Oh Yeah! This was just a bit pumped up from "what Mom used to make". Of course, I tinkered: sugar instead of honey, and I replaced the horseradish with a few shakes of cayenne pepper for the heat (but I can also imagine a couple of chipotles would be great too). Served with mashed potatoes and a "mess-o-greens". I shredded the leftovers and last night we had BBQ sandwiches and cole slaw.

My husband loved the sauce. I added extra garlic, and didn't include the horseradish. The ribs were tough, so I agree with the reader that said to try boiling it for less time. And definately less time once you take the foil off (my ribs got pretty burnt).

I added about 1/2 c. red wine and some additional honey and cooked it on very low heat an additional 15 min which gave it time to get nice and thick. Very good sauce !! The ribs fell apart.

This is a great recipe - if you include one additional step!! I made this several times exactly as the recipe called, and we all agreed that it is a great sauce, but it lacked "zip". So, I added chili powder - and that's all it needed. Follow the recipe, but when the ribs are boiled, drained & patted dry - sprinkle both sides with a bit of Chili Powder (less than a teaspoon in total). Bake in the 350 degree oven for 15 minutes - THEN add the cooked sauce. It really rounds out the flavor. It's definitely our favorite, relatively-fast rib recipe!

Yummy!! This recipe was very easy to follow and I had great results. My husband who snubs oven baked meats loves this recipe.
