Made this for the fourth of July , BIG HIT !! Was a little time consuming but well worth it. I also made a strawberry fudge one, this was excellent also, who doesn't like fudge and strawberries, I got mixed reviews on this one some couldn't get past the toasted marshmallow, me personally I loved it!!

Awesome recipe. Definitely worth the time, especially the crust. People rave every time I make this dessert!

p.s. definitely heed the warning about the layers taking longer than 10 mins to freeze. The ice cream had to be pretty soft in order to get smoothed out, so I allowed closer to a half hour between layers. It was easy though, just to go do other things while it was in the freezer, and come back later for the next layer. It's not like it was in the oven and going to burn:) definitely do the day before when you're not in a rush. Then. it took about 5 mins the day of with very little last minute hassle or mess.

um... yum. wasn't sure if it was going to be too sweet, so I made the hot fudge with bittersweet chocolate just in case. It was really sweet, so I'm glad I did... Crazy good though. Very very rich - a small piece is plenty. But, OMG it was yummy! a big hit at my mom's b-day dinner. Really liked the coffee ice cream with it. Needed that flavor to offset and break up all the chocolate & marshmallows. My 3yr old (marshmallow loving) niece requested one with strawberry ice cream for her b-day... still thinking that one through :)

This was so easy and delicious. I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday. Everyone was impressed and raved about how good it was. Definately a keeper recipe.

Turned out very well; only issue was that the ice cream took much, much longer to harden than recipe estimates, so first layer was not quite so even. Regardless, people at my BBQ loved it. My tips: I used only 1 pint coffee ice cream for middle layer, and butter pecan for other two layers. Also recommend using more butter for crust (2-4 Tbsp.) Make sure you allow enough time for the layers to set. I also used a blow torch for the marshmallows.

Delicious! Made as directed except substiututed chocolate ice cream for the middle layer. Adults and kids all loved it! (Served 8 easy with 1/2 of cake still left!)

This is great as is. But my changes are to omit the marshmello fluff. Toast 12 to 18 large marshmellows on a parchemnent lined bake sheet 350* for about 6 minutes. Place around the top of the cake and place curls of chocolate in the center.

My friend made this for a Memorial Day get together. She said it was really easy to make, and oh my gosh...was it good. Definately need to make and save the recipe to your recipe box!!

Rating: 4
Awesome. I've made several times. Lessons learned: I think coffee ice cream is best (plenty of chocolate in fudge sauce). Thinner (store bought) fudge sauce freezes better. Thicker sauce never really froze and made the layers shift when slicing. Stir the marshmallow fluff until smooth before spreading on cake. Allow plenty of time to freeze each layer. I start 2 days in advance. Watch carefully when broiling - takes less than a minute to brown, and marshmallows WILL start on fire! You'll love this cake!

Sorry,Correction: I make about 3/4 of the sauce.

I have 3 boys and this is always the cake they want for their birthday. Then I have to forward the recipe on to all the moms of the kids who were at the party and raved about it when they got home. I've used lots of different flavors but Breyers Coffee is my favorite even though I don't even like coffee. My kids usually want a caramel flavor. I make about 1/3 of the sauce as we never need the extra and I cut back on the graham crackers by a few.

I made this for the fourth of july, modified to a reeses peanut butter version. I used graham cracker crust, bottom layer of chocolate ice cream, a layer of fudge, and a top layer of peanut butter ice cream. Fudge sauce on top for presentation. It was delicious, though I suspect the marshmellows do add a lot to the presentation of the smores version. The hardest part was waiting for each layer to freeze enough to put the next layer on.

I made this for my daughter's 11th birthday dinner party. It was fun for the kids to watch the marshmallows expand and turn golden just like in the fireplace. We had leftovers which I wrapped in foil already cut into serving pieces, and I put them back into the freezer. When someone wanted a piece, I pulled out and put the piece in the microwave for 30 seconds. The marshmallow topping went from frozen to that wonderful ooze again. Next time I am going to try using strawberry ice cream, YUM!

This was good but we didn't find it mind-bending like so many of the reviews implied. The flavors were a fun combo, though.

Only made with two layers of ice cream and one of fudge. Used peppermint stick instead of coffee. It was still amazing. It was loved by even my non-dessert eating guests.

Rating: 3
I love this recipe. My tips - add 1/4 stick extra butter to crust and use the back of a large spoon that's been run under hot water to spread the ice cream. Take out your broiler pan (if yours is uner your stove) and keep the door open when you are toasting the marshmellows - EXCELLENT!

I was in a hurry to make this so I only did two layers and only froze the completed cake for 3 hours or so. It still looked pretty darn good, and it tasted great. It was hard to believe that all it is is ice cream, fudge and graham crackers! It's all in the presentation. Served it to 8 adults at a birthday party and they loved the toasted marshmallows on top - they said it smelled and tasted like camping. This is a very fun dessert.

Over the past year I have made numerous birthday cakes, never making the same cake twice. I've tried numerous different recipes from this site, all receiving rave reviews. This cake however, takes them all. I was told that this was the best one yet and already have a request to make it again. I did make some slight changes to the recipe, but nothing major; I omitted the almonds from the crust and instead of coffee ice cream I used 2 layers of vanilla and one of chocolate.

Rating: 2
OK, easy to do but waaay too sweet. Maybe it's good for children. Could be better if you skipped the fluff, used just one layer of marshamallows and used a more bittersweet fudge sauce - I didn't care for the corn syrup in this one.

Rating: 4
fabulous dessert and huge hit for new years eve (it fed 14 people easily) but, as amazing as it may seem, i actually increased the amount of fudge sauce so i could have enough to serve each piece of cake sitting in a small puddle of fudge.

Rating: 3
A huge hit. Used 3 alternating layers of chocolate and vanilla ice cream with (purchased) fudge sauce in between. I softened ice cream in microwave to thick, spreadable consistency, which made creating the layers a cinch. Left out almonds in crust due to nut allergy, and it turned out great. EASY (I really don't understand LI's complaint, below!)and a delicious crowd-pleaser. Kids went berserk when this was brought out. Come to think of it, so did adults! The only thing I'll do differently next time is use a kitchen torch to brown the top, instead of broiler. I found that it needed more than 60 seconds under broiler to get the marshmallows to a nice brown color, and then ice cream got a tiny bit melty around edges, which made presentation less than 100% perfect. But this was so good, no one cared! A good recipe for an easy, make-ahead, impressive looking fun dessert, especially for kids.

Let's face it, how could anything with ice cream, graham crackers, marshmallows and fudge be bad? And this wasn't bad. But given the ridiculous amount of time required to put this thing together (alternately thawing, then freezing, layers of ice cream and fudge, and later struggling to spread marshmallow cream before the ice cream melted) the result should have transcended the sum of the parts, which it surely did not. Would not waste my time again with this recipe as written.

Rating: 4
What a hit this recipe is; tastes fabulous and is awesome to present. I've made this a couple of times and used a propane torch for even browning of the marshmallows. For ease, prepare it one day ahead and add the marshmallows just before serving. Toasting the marshmallows tableside just before serving entertains your guests. I used Breyers coffee ice cream both times but can't wait to try other flavors as suggested from previous reviewers. I placed my ice cream in a bowl and stirred it with a heavy whisk to soften and smooth it which made it easier to spread. (Let it freeze a little longer before adding the fudge.) My guests always rave about it and I'm salivating just writing about it! Worth the calories!!!!!!!

I did both the original and then my version. My version went like this: Used Star Bucks Coffee almond fudge and took out the almonds. For the fudge sauce I followed the fudge recipe on the jar of marshmellow creme except instead of chocolate chips, I used a big bar of Ghirardelli chocolate, then processed 1/2 cup toasted almonds and the almonds from the ice cream and added to the fudge. All I can say, is Oh my... Served it at our Gourmet club and it was a hit!

Rating: 3
I loved this recipe. I noticed the broiler issue caused problems for some, so I used my mini butane torch and the results were great. I also noticed that if my ice cream was too soft, it was tough to get the fudge layers even, but it really didn't matter. It was an easy and impressive looking dessert. I will make it again for sure!!

I agree with Los Angeles - DON'T be put off by Andrea's review. She made it incorrectly and blamed the recipe! I think she made more than one boo-boo if she thought it wasn't sweet enough. I can polish off large amounts of fudge and I thought I would go into sugar shock with this one! It's beautiful and different dessert. Give it a whirl!

Great basic recipe that offers so many possible variations. Made this for my mom's birthday. I unfortunately forgot to buy candles but was able to sing "Happy Birthday" as I took the flaming cake out of the broiler. True Girl Scout s'mores. After scraping the grilled marshmallows off, the cake was still really good. If you have a small broiler beware!

Don't be put off by Andrea's review. This ice cream cake is superb. I have made it a number of times and it is a huge hit. It browns beautifully in the broiler. I use vanilla ice cream as not everyone likes coffee ice cream.

Rating: 2
Disappointing! Honestly, I felt it wasn't sweet enough. Bizarre after reading all the reviews. 1) coffee ice cream was the wrong choice 2) it would not fit into my oven broiler (drawer-style) so I couldn't brown the marshmallows. Also, I boo-booed and put the cake back into the freezer with the marshmallow cream on it, so it turned into a hard, sticky, plasticky mess. It was a combination of things that made it a failure. Next time, I would use chocolate grahams, a different flavor of ice cream and no fluff. Also will need a different method for browning the top. Perhaps one of those little blow torches used for creme brulee. I put the entire rest of the cake into the blender and made a yummy shake! Now that was tasty!

The sides of crust didn't seem to hold up when the ice cream was added (despite being completely cooled). However, the fudge sauce is unbelieveable and overall, a cool dessert to make!

This recipe went over great the first time I made it. To make it easier, the second time I only made one layer of ice cream, and since it was Christmas, I used Peppermint Ice Cream. Everyone thought it was delicious. I made it twice since then.

This is absolutely delicious! The toasted nuts in the crust are wonderful. I substituted chocolate graham crackers, and the coffee-chocolate flavor was terrific. I also followed the suggestion of one reader who used Nutella instead of the fudge sauce, it worked great and made the recipe even easier. Definitely a keeper!

This cake is TERRIFIC! I've made it for four dinner parties and it is a hit everytime. Everyone loves it. I skipped the marshmellow creme, as it is too hard to spread, and just browned marshmellows on top.

This was a terrific dessert. It has to be prepared at least one day ahead though, as it is easy but time consuming. To make it even easier, I used Nutella instead of the fudge and it was wonderful. All my guests loved it- they said it was worth the calories! I also wasn't sure if everyone enjoyed coffee ice cream so I layered the coffe between layers of Breyer's vanilla.

This was a fun cake to make and serve. Browning the marshmallows was easier than I thought. I would use less marshmallow fluff/creme next time, though, as it was too sweet for me. I would also use a milk chocolate sauce next time, as I used chocolate ice cream instead of coffee and the dark fugde sauce was a bit too intense.

Rating: 4
Drop dead wonderful! This is certainly the best ice cream cake I've ever had the pleasure of making or eating. The marshmallows were nothing less than charming. But watch them VERY closely in the oven; mine browned in about fifteen seconds. I couldn't find marshmallow creme, so I used something called marshmallow fluff, which I suspect is the same thing. I used Haagen Daaz coffee ice cream, but I wouldn't mind a stronger coffee flavor next time. The crust was the best I've ever eaten; we loved the almonds.

I made this dessert for my family on Easter and it got RAVE reviews! They were very impressed. The presentation was magnificent and everyone thought it was absolutely delicious. I substituted vanilla and vanilla-fudge ice cream for the coffe, since none of us like coffee. While it was an easy recipe to make, it took a long time since I had to freeze between each layer so they wouldn't mix. It really did look just like the magazine cover!

This "cake" looks really impressive, but it is soooo sweet. And, I am a sweet "freak"! I think the marshmallows on top make it a bit much. There are so many better cakes out there. Try the German choc. cake squares or the Orange Chiffon Cake--- Yum!!

Absolutely delicious! The only problem I had was getting the ice cream evenly soft. By slicing it into smaller chunks, it thawed more evenly and spread more easily. My guests were overwhelmed with both the presentation and the flavor. A definite keeper!

Very difficult to make! You must need a commercial freezer to freeze the ice cream hard enough so that when you are struggling to spread the marshmallow creme (which was nearly impossible!) that it didn't start melting on you, then by the time you browned the top, it was a melted ice cream mess! yuck!

This is a fantastic dessert! I made it for a dinner party the night I went into labor (!) to rave reviews. If you use Starbucks ice cream, i'd recommend letting it freeze for a good half hour b/w layers...for some reason, it doesn't freeze that well so it melts quickly when you try to spread the fudge sauce. Didn't have that problem with Haagen Dazs.

Easy recipe that played to rave reviews at a recent brunch. (Who says we cant have dessert at brunch?) For additional texture I put a layer of graham cracker crumbs on top of the fudge sauce in each layer. Low-fat coffee icecream (cappuccino chunk in this instance) seemed right at home here. Highly recommend this, even for a novice cook.

I made this dessert for my family at Christmas and it was a huge hit! I used Haagen-Daas coffee ice cream, but next time I would use one of the rich Starbuck ones to add more flavor.

excellent! made it for a 6 year-olds birthday since the kids don't like cake. Everything went well except the marshmallows caught on fire badly. I scraprd them off and redid it, which was not a problem. However,you should have the oven door open slightly yo watch the browning, which only took about 30 seconds. I used toasted walnuts instead of almonds and the crust tasted like peanut butter, which was very good.

As good as this was, there is a recipe in Creme de Colorado, which is one of the Denver Junior League cookbooks, that is even better. It is the Frozen Mocha Torte. It has a macaroon crust, coffee and chocolate ice creams, fudge sauce and chopped Heath bars. It is awesome, my husband's all-time favorite dessert. If you can get your hands on a copy of the cookbook, be sure to try it.

I made this dessert for New years Eve. It was a hit. Every one loved it! You definately need to let it sit in the freezer overnight to have the cake turn out perfect. Use a hot serrated knife when cutting it, the pieces come much nicer. Watch those marshmellos. They get brown real quick! My friends still rave about this cake. it is a wonderful rich dessert.

This was great!!I made it for x-mas eve. I made my own icecream which is a tradition. 1st layer---cappacino heath bar with chocolate chips and second layer was mocha pecan. This was my favorite!!! and then the grand finale was I set it on fire!!!! I had it too close to the broiler and those little marshmallows catch fast!!! it was still great. After all, doesnt everyone set theirs on fire while camping? I found the fudge amazing and next year I'm making that in pretty jars to give out for x-mas. my next attempt is fresh strawberry icecream with white chocolate fudge, and toasted marshmallow not burnt.

This was a truly yummy dessert and easy to make. I did omit the coffee flavored ice cream and mixed Bailey's Irish Cream and Frangelico into vanilla ice cream and used that instead. I was in a hurry and made this on the same day I served it and it firmed up nicely in about 6 hours in our freezer. It was so hard after 24 hours that it was difficult to cut and to eat.
