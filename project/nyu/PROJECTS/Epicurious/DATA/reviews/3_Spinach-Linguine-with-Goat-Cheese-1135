This was good. An easy weekday meal. I made some changes to reflect what I had on hand and it worked out well. I used a yellow pepper for colour, extra garlic, added feta, goat cheese and parm and capers. I also reserved a half cup of the pasta water so it would be too dry. Yum.

I thought this was quite good! I did make a few changes - I omitted the green onions and sauteed a regular onion instead, and skipped the sun dried tomatoes. I was concerned about this being too dry based on the reviews, so to avoid that I used a can of diced tomatoes with the liquid (tomatoes are out of season at the moment anyway), and added a little chicken stock and let everything simmer for a bit to make a thin sauce. I also added a touch of balsamic vinegar because I felt it needed a little more acidity. Then I tossed everything with hot whole wheat pasta and stirred in the goat cheese so it melted and made a yummy, creamy sauce. Good for a quick weeknight dinner.

this was only okay. i am a pasta lover and so this was good but nothing super special. the goat cheese was probably the best part of it. not difficult to make at all.

Yummy and easy! My husband gave it a 2.5, but warmed up to it as he ate it. I gave it a 3. We didn't have any problems with the goat cheese clumping, but we used crumbled feta rather than sliced. I think the trick is to toss the cheese with very hot pasta. We used whole wheat fettucini

I made this recipe exactly as written, but found it very bland, dry and disappointing. The only liquid, aside from the vegetables, is olive oil. When I added the goat cheese, it just clung to the linguine in clumps. Did anyone else have the same result?

Very good and easy to prepare! The goat cheese adds a nice touch. The dish makes a colorful presentation.

Wonderful! It is an elegant dish, and it's also easy to prepare. I used plain fettucini instead of spinach linguine, and it was excellent.

The goat cheese was awesome!! It was light and creamy. It was great with crispy garlic bread!!

A delicious meal. Just the right richness from the goat cheese to offset the pasta. Wonderful!
