I haven't tried this recipe yet. . . Using buttermilk or souring your own milk will work better I think than using true sour milk unless of course you know exactly how long the milk will have had to have been sour. Personally, I do not know how long is the proper time, however, the aforementioned milks will work just as well.

Can we give this negative forks? I had to try this because I had sour milk. It tastes as awful as sour milk and cornmeal sounds. And, as a previous reviewer indicated, sifting cornmeal is insane. Fit for a king? If you want to overthrow the monarchy maybe.

Very moist, crunchy, not sweet.

Anyone ever tried sifting cornmeal? It's a waste of time! What's the point? You could mix these ingredients until the cows come home and they immediately separate as soon as you stop stirring. The end result was bland and boring; I will find better ways to use up sour milk. I plan on giving it to the squirrels in the morning. Maybe they will never come back.
