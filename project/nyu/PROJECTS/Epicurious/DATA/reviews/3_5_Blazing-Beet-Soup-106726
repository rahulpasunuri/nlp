I followed this recipe to the "T" and the soup came out with bits of beet chunks in it. I was expecting it to be clear with no chunks. But it still came out very good to the taste. Not the soup I remember as a girl though. May have to keep looking for the right recipe.

I boiled about 12 medium beets in water from my garden and the next day I pureed them with the chicken broth. I added the juice of one lemon and served it cold. My husband whom is not a fan of beets, even asked for some. I thought it was delicious!

I cooked the beets in water and then added chicken broth to the puree. I got it to the right consistency, added the juice of one lemon, and served it cold with sour cream. My husband, whom is not a fan of beets, even asked for some. I thought it was delicious!

This recipe is all about the taste of beets. Pay attention to the instruction to balance the sweet/sour flavors. I ended up adding quite a bit of lemon juice to make it sing. I love the purity of the flavor and simplicity of preparation.Creme fraiche made it sublime.
