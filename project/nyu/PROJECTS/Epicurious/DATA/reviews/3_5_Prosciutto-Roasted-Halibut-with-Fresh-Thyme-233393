Very delicious! Used tilapia - cut the filet into two and put the thinner piece on top of the thicker piece. Cooking time was right on. Used fresh thyme. What a delicious, simple, flavourful dish. I would definitely recommend and make again, if you're a seafood lover.

Wow! This is such an easy recipe that really delivers flavor -- and great presentation. Would definitely serve to company. I had to use more prosciutto to wrap the halibut since each fillet was 8oz -- but that was okay, because they were delicious. I increased the sauce to accomodate the larger fillet sizes -- the sauce really adds to the halibut. Will definitely make this again.

Just perfect as is. We used cod since that was at the market. Quick and easy family dinner.

We really enjoy this recipe. I buy the tail piece. I do not add salt. I always use fresh thyme. I brown on both sides before putting in the oven. Watch the cook time. I found it doesn't require as long as the recipe calls for.

Easy, Would probably invest in better prosciutto than what I used. Had delicious fresh caught from Alaska Halibut...felt like the prosciutto overwhelmed the taste of the fish, Would maybe be better as a way to cook up older fish.

This was easy and good. But next time I'd double or triple the sauce. The fish definitely needs the extra tang to make it yummy. Oh - and I suggest going very light on salting the fish - in my opinion the prosciutto adds enough.

Fast, easy delicious and almost impossible to mess up. We didnt have the proscuitto in house so we used speck instead, which, added a little more salt to the process. I loved it because the speck kept the fish from being over cooked.

we love this, i lost the recipe and was really excited to find it here. Halibut is my husband's fave fish and this is easy and elegant. i have made it for dinner parties and just us. Would not change a thing. If you can find fresh thyme, it makes a big difference...

as for cooking notes, i used dried thyme rather than fresh, and finished the dish in the broiler to give the prosciutto a nice crispy texture. as for menu notes, for our first course i prepared frisée and endive salad with warm brussels sprouts and toasted pecans (also from epicurious) and added small amount of blue cheese. montes pinot noir (chilean) was a fantastic pair for both courses. simple execution with very flavorful results.

Delicious and easy. I used dried thyme and fresh halibut I caught off the Oregon coast.

This recipe was really good and easy. It seemed like a good dish to entertain with.

My husband enjoyed this but I thought it was just okay. I did use Chilean Sea Bass instead of halibut. It was a nice basic meal but nothing special or spectacular. At least it was easy.

Used sole which was good but the saltiness of the proscuitto was too salty with the added salt and papper on the fish. My husband thought it was overwhelming. It is also hard to tell when the fish is cooked because of it hiding in the little "package". A great presentation if you really know what you are doing with fish cooking times.

My boyfriend and I cooked this the other night, and we loved that it was extremely simple to prepare, yet looked and tasted like a special recipe. Whole Foods was out of halibut (guess it's seasonal), so we used cod, and it was still delicious. Next time, we plan to cut back a bit on the thyme - 1 tsp per fillet is a bit overwhelming, especially when you add another tsp to the sauce. We were also thinking of making more sauce next time, and maybe thickening it up with something.

I've made this recipe 3 times for guests and we just love it. It's quick and easy, but comes across as something special. I've probably used a little less than a teaspoon of thyme per serving. For fillets about an inch thick, the 6-minute roasting time was perfect.

This just didn't ring my bell. Or the hubby's. He said it made the prosciutto taste fishy... True but hardly the point. Normally I can figure out how to punch up a drab recipe, but this one has left me without inspiration.

This recipe was elegant, simple, and delicious. I did shorten the cooking time by about a minute and a half and the fish came out perfectly cooked. Also, I made a garlic paste that I added to the fish with the thyme. Served it with roasted asparagus that I wrapped in leftover prosciutto and some couscous.

We loved this recipe, it is now one of my husband's favorites. I didn't have to change a thing about it.

Delicious and so easy to make. Good for weeknight or for company.

Definitely have to adjust the cooking time - either during the browning stage or the roasting stage. Fish was definitely overdone and I roasted 2 minutes less than suggested time. Otherwise, the flavor was very good - just didn't appreciate overcooked expensive fish - talk about sticker shock!!

dried out, expensive, odd combination. no one finished it. cat loved it.

Wonderful! Quick and healthy-the fresh thyme with the shallots makes a great sauce-make sure your deli person knows how to slice the proscuitto very thin-the more thin the more crisp-I guess this could be very elegant with the right side dishes, but I think this will be a staple week night quick dinner at our home!

oops - watch the roasting time!!

I made this for my husband and I and although it is good, quick and easy - I wouldn't consider it 'elegant' or for a special occasion. Buy thick halibut and don't watch the roasting time.

I made this on Christmas Eve, and it was delicious. I liked the prosciutto. It added a sharp flavor.

I made this recipe just as written and it was just so-so. I think it would be better with bacon instead of prosciutto.

Very easy to make -- great flavor. This is an elegant dish that truly took only about 15 minutes from beginning to end.

Excellent and easy. I was low on thyme in my garden, but I have oregano too so I used a blend of both for both the fish and the sauce. Very good.
