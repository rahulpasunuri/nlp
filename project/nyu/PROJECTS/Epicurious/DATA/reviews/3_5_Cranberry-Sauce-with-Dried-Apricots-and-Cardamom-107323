This is an easy, delicious & versatile cranberry sauce! I've made it at least once a year since it was published in 2002. The apricots are really gorgeous with the cranberries, too. As written, the recipe is wonderful but I've also switched out orange juice/zest for orange & cinnamon sticks for cardamom depending on what stuffing & sauce I'm using for my turkey. My husband hates cranberry sauce but even he loves this!

I have made this recipe for 3 years now, and if I even suggest not making it, everyone complains. I find the sweet/tart balance to be perfect. Even my husband, a sworn canned jellied cranberry sauce dinosaur, begs me to make this. I think a lot of the improvisations from others sound quite interesting.

This was delicious and even the cranberry sauce haters liked it. I left out the honey entirely because it just seemed like too much sweetener and it was great. I wanted more cardamom, so I'll probably add more next time. I like the idea of adding vanilla bean too. Oh, and I couldn't find apricot nectar, so I used mango nectar and the flavor difference wasn't noticeable.

everybody raves about this recipe - and they request it every thanksgiving. i make extra and freeze it and we eat it with bagels and cream cheese all year. i often add vanilla to this - it gives it an essence of kulfi - amazing! lots of vanilla - a whole pod, and more vanilla paste.

Well hang me from the ceiling fan and color me blue! My picky 11 yr old niece fell in love with this recipe! So did everyone else. It was a big hit. I followed it pretty much as its written except for one thing. Now, in 2008, cardamom is $15 a bottle! I read online you can substitute that amount with 1/2tsp of cinnamon and 1/2tsp of nutmeg. I can also offer the following insight. When I had finished the whole thing I tasted it and thought" not bad". Then I realized I hadnt added the lemon zest yet. After adding it in I noticed a huge difference. It was more apricot-y before the zest and the zest overpowered that when added. It works very with it in after you let it rest, though, so def go ahead and use it. I like the idea of using it on French toast the next day. Cant wait to try that!

If you are making this today, in this warm weather, be careful b/c it majorly attracts bees!!

I'm excited to be making this for the third consecutive Thanksgiving. It's always a hit and keeps well for leftovers.

This recipe is great with the following changes: for those of you who said it is too sweet, I change the nectar to water, and for those of you who say the lemon is too much, I use orange juice and orange zest. With those two changes, this is fantastic!

This is a hit every Thanksgiving meal. I often increase the number of cardomon pods I use, as I like the extra depth they provide. I strongly recommend this recipe.

The lemon juice and zest completely overpower the other flavors. Reduce the amounts drastically or skip altogether.

This is by far my favorite recipe for cranberry sauce, and I have made it for years. Cardomom is expensive, so I have always used dry rather than the pods. It makes a good addition to cinnamon rolls the morning after as well.

Most delicious. The cardamom gave it pizzazz.

Definetly too sweet as written. Like cranberry sauce, like dried apricots but didn't like them combined in this dish. This is the first one fork I've ever given on this site.

Great recipe! It was interesting while still being traditional. Omitted the honey and only used 1/4 c. of sugar with no problem. Got rave reviews at Thanksgiving, and even converted those who were previously unenthusiastic about cranberry sauce.

It was yummy til I added all the lemon zest-- next time I'll add that sparingly, tasting after each addition. Without it, it's too sweet, but by the time I added it all, it was too lemony and the apricot and cardamom had faded into the background...

This is one of the most interesting cranberry sauce recipes that I have made. I deleted the sugar because of the other sweeteners, and added an ounce of Grand Manier to it. Magnificent!!!

This is THE BEST cranberry sauce recipe ever. I made it in advance of Thanksgiving and served some with French toast to test it out. It is absolutely delicious and a snap to make.

I loved this, and so did everyone else who had it! Made it exactly as the recipe called for. The cardamom gives it such a nice, unexpected flavor and fragrance. This will be a staple on my holiday menus from now on.

I really liked this recipe. Since the dried apricots, nectar, and preserves contain added sugar already, I only used a 1/4 cup of maple syrup (was out of honey) and found the sauce had just the right amount of sweetness and tartness. I did cook this a bit longer on the stove than instructed because the cranberries I used were large in size and contained a lot of water. Overall an excellent recipe which I will use as a holiday staple from now on.

Not only does the dish taste great, it has the most amazing smell while it's cooking. Even the non-cranberry eaters at Thanksgiving (or whenever) seem to like this one... as with most cranberry sauces, it tastes even better after it has set for a few days.

This was the most delicious cranberry sauce we've ever had. We used souvenier cardamom from a trip to the Far East, (taking the pods off kept my son busy for a bit)and oops..thought I had apricots in the pantry, but it was pineapple....no problem...it worked well. Definitely I'll make this again.

I left the honey out based on others comments and found it to be ok that way.

This is probably the best cranberry sauce I've had to date. Made it last year for 8 people and we had none left over. Will be making it again this Thanksgiving.

Excellent with smoked ham on Christmas day. Only used half as much sugar and no honey.

EXCELLENT RECIPE. EVERYONE LOVED IT. I HAVE BEEN MAKING A CERTAIN SAUCE FOR YEARS AND DECIDED TO TRY THIS ONE OUT FOR A CHANGE. IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY. I REALLY RECOMMEND IT. ALSO, PUT THE DRIED APRICOTS IN THE FOOD PROCESSOR FOR EASIER CHOPPING.

The sauce was too tart when tasted alone. I plan on revising it as it was too "pretty".

I've decided that I really don't like cardamom, so I used cinnamon instead. I was a little worried that it was going to be too sweet (for the apricot jam I used leftover apricot puree from the golden pumpkin layer cake recipe on this website), but after it set up it was just perfect. Everyone certainly seemed to enjoy it, but it does make a lot (there were only 6 of us at T'giving). Also, I had to make all my dishes on T'giving day itself, so to make sure this set up in time I stuck it in the freezer. It may have been a little runnier than gelatinous cranberries, but it certainly wasn't soupy!

This is a wonderful recipe! Served it at Thanksgiving and it was all gone! Will definitely make again!

I've had better recipes, from this site. I thought it was just ok. I'll try something else for our second Thanksgiving this weekend.

Great recipe. Used dried mango and mango juice in lieu of apricots, was fabulous. Doubled the recipe and had way too much left over so used the cranberry sauce plus a little cornstarch, as a filling in a sweet crust pie shell. Family loved it even more as a pie!!

I was wowed by this one. It was the best cranberry sauce I have ever had. I made it for Thanksgiving and people were begging me for the recipe. I will be making this again for sure.

I served this at Thanksgiving to raves all around the table. Several guests said it was the best cranberry sauce they had ever tried. There was a perfect balance between tart and sweet flavors and lots of color. It was very easy to make (I used ground cardamom from a bottle.)

I served this with thanksgiving. This was fantastic. I didn't have dried apricots and I don't think I added as much honey --not too sweet, and too tart. I used huge organic cranberries from Michigan. The cardomon was really wonderful, especially when taken with a bite of turkey. This was the best cranberry sauce I have had.

This is horrible. I had to throw it out. Plus the cardoman was $8.00/bottle.

I've now made this recipe twice. Although I very much liked the flavors the first time, the third of a cup of lemon juice made it too tart for my taste, so the second time I made it, I cut the amount of lemon juice approximately in half. It was great.
