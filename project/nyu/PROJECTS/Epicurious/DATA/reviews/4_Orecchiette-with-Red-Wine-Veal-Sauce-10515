I've always loved this recipe and it is the only way I do osso bucco (which I do rarely). It's so simple, I don't like to do a lot to it but this time I added just 2 sliced wrinkled black olives and I felt like it finished the flavors perfectly.

Rich, very rich. Two separate guests called this "The best veal I've ever had". I Stayed true to the recipe except for Pasta shape. Use the shanks, because the texture and the flavor the marrow imparts sets this recipe apart. Just use common sense with the pepper flakes.

it is very hard to find veal sshanks in our neck of the woods, and once you do find them (at whole foods) they are expensive, so i don't make this frequently but let me tell you - it is delicious! i had to cut down the amount of the hot pepper flakes because it was overwhelming but everytime i make this, even my picky 12 year old "mcdonald's addict" loves this.

I found the proportion of wine to tomatoes off. I would cut the wine in half or double the tomatoes. It was too rich for a main. I might experiment with this as a first course. But then again, there are better things to do with veal.

In fact, I have made it twice, to rave reviews. A very satisfying, "comfort food" dish. Use the best semolina pasta available as it makes a big difference.

How that small amount of red pepper flakes could overcome all of the rest is a mystery to me. It was way too much. Ended up with no flavor but a hot mouth.

This is a truely yummy recipe... my husband loves it and always asks for more. The leftovers keep well and tastes even better. The sauce is so rich and flavourful. If there's only one pasta dish to cook, this is the top choice! One can never go wrong.

Eliminated the cloves and added tomato paste for an even richer consistency....absolutely divine

I liked this recipe because of the uncomplicated ingredients and beautiful results. Only cautionary note would be that this is very rich, but that is usually the case with veal sauces. I'd give it 3.5 forks if I could, but I'm nto rating it because I made two changes: 1) I omitted the cloves because I had none and usually detest them, and 2) I used 1.5lbs veal stew meat instead of veal shanks. Regretfully, my butcher was out of shanks (arggg!). It came out great anyway with the stew meat, and produced very hearty and comforting dish. Next time I'll use veal shanks, becuase I'm sure the soft texture of the meat combined with the bone marrow mixed into the sauce would produce something absolutely extraordinary. Note: In my estimation, this would serve 4 people as a 1-dish meal, 6 people with extras like salad, bread, desert, etc... and 8 people only if it was a first course to be followed by a second. (NOTE: You may also want to try this excellent and even richer dish on epicurious: "PASTA WITH VEAL, SAUSAGE AND PORCINI RAGU". It's killer in small portions.)

Actually quite easy to prepare! I made this for my family but would be happy to serve it to guests. It has a really "home cooked, comforting flavor." The smell of my kitchen while cooking reminded me of my grandmother cooking when I was a child. Mmmmm!

Made this for company on Saturday night and they raved about it all evening long. Tastes very complicated, but was actually quite easy to put together.

Spectacular! First time, I wasn't sure if it was a clove of garlic, or a clove-clove. I'm assuming it's a clove-clove, because it has turned out wonderfully that way. It's really easy, but tastes complex and extravagent. A fabulous company dish - oohs and ahhs!

I had never cooked with Osso Buco until I tried this dish. Now this recipe is one of my favorites for company and I have become a huge fan of this wonderful, tender meat. It's easy and great to do ahead, just heat up and make your pasta. Yummmm, I may have to cook it again soon!

This is a great dish, esp. for entertaining. It's rich and delicious, somewhat unusual, yet simple and straightforward, and people love it. Just add a salad and some crusty bread.
