to reply to the previous 2 reviews, i think there is just a line missing. I had more juice from the passionfruits than the 1/3 cup to be reserved. I sprinkled the gelatin over the un-reserved juice. The rest was fine. Lovely.

I agree with lucky w, my mousse needed more cream to be successful. Next time I am going to use more passion fruit juice and and chill the gelatin juice mixture for less time before I add the cream. I will also use more cream. I followed the recipe as best I could given the vague directions, and the result was clumpy and had little bits of gelatin stuck in it. The flavor is ok, but the texture is terrible. I will not give a fork rating until I try again.

The Mousse itself was great, the recipie though is not written clearly (unusual for Gourmet) I used orange juice instead of water to disolve the gelatine in. Also I would reserve some of the passion fruit mixture to the side while you fold in the cream, I had too much and had to whip more cream to get the proper consistency.

The perfect end to a romantic dinner for two.

You may substitute appricot juice for the passion fruit and this mousse will be just as good. It's been a hit every time I've made it.
