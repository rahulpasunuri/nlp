Wow. Really really good. We went with 3 garlic cloves and toasted the almonds. Also, didn't quite use the full 1 tsp of salt.

Really great basic recipe. I followed many of the suggestions: 1. Did not blanch the basil 2. Toasted the pine nuts 3. Added lemon juice to taste (really makes a difference!) 4. Do NOT add salt as recipe calls for since the cheese is salty, just add to taste at the end. Wonderful on tomato/mozarella sandwiches!

This is a great basic pesto recipe, though the amount of oil in the recipe seems a bit too much, as many have noted. I use D.O.P. Parmigiano-reggiano (Italian protected designation of origin parm) and basil from my garden and I literally can't get enough. I eat it in and on virtually everything. It doesn't take long to prepare in my food processor and I can tweak it for slightly (or very) different takes on the basic recipe. I enjoy adding some fresh parsley for an earthier taste or oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes. Oh! I toast the pine nuts - it really adds something to it. I wish I were more of a gourmand and could put my finger on why this makes such a difference.

Very nice. The only changes I made were to toast the pine nuts and to add approximately 1 t. lemon zest. I did use a little less oil, starting out with 1/4 c. of EVOO, then adding to desired consistency.

Added lemon juice, garlic powder and pepper. Should have used less olive oil as others have noted. Still delicious though! Started with 6cups fresh basil, made just under 3 cups pesto (including cheese).

If you plan on freezing your pesto, omit the cheese and add it when you serve!

Just sent these tips to a friend so I thought I'd share them here. Have been making this for years. As many have suggested: 1.Use parmesan you grate yourself, the best you can manage to buy 2. Cut back on the salt and add it 'to taste' in the end. The amount you needs varies based on the saltiness of the parmesan you purchase. 3. We typically use less of the oil, as mentioned by many others. I use half as much esp if I freeze it. 4. A squeeze of lemon (1T to the whole recipe) keeps it bright green especially if you are freezing it. 5. If you freeze, make the entire recipe as written EXCEPT for the parmesan. Do include the lemon listed above. Spoon into mini muffin tins or icecube trays and cover with plastic wrap. Freeze, pop out and wrap individually in plastic wrap--no air, please. Store in a ziplock back for many months. To use, thaw and add in equal volume of grated cheese to match the volume of the frozen pesto (eg my mini muffin tins are 1/8 cup so to each of those I add 1/8 cup parm. ) If not smooth enough, add some pasta water and stir. Fresh pesto all winter long!

Great pesto but I suggest either using less cheese or not adding the salt so that it's not too salty, as mine came out the first time.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! I used fresh basil from my garden and measured it as 4 cups lightly packed. Used all Parmesan and what really made it good was the EVOO I used..Lemon Mosto Oil. You could use any lemon infused EVOO or perhaps a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. First time I have used a blender for pesto and I loved the silky texture. Pulsed with chop and grind and then blend. Don't know why people are losing the bright green color, unless maybe their basil is not very fresh.

After the first few weeks of summer, much of the basil available here becomes bitter and strong-flavored. This is especially true when the basil bolts (develops flowers). At this point, I start buying hydroponic basil at my local farmer's market. The grower continually starts new plants, which provides a nice "baby" new leaf. Whatever you do, don't use the tough, large leaves normally available this time of year in the supermarket. This dish is all about the ingredients. I recently traveled to Liguria and discovered that many cooks there stir in 3 or 4 tablespoons of room temperature butter after the pesto is finished (you can reduce the olive oil). This makes for a creamier dish - and a slightly less intense basil flavor which some may prefer.

Great basic recipe to work with.

Very easy to prepare. Used almonds I found in my cupboard as I couldn't be bothered to go out and get walnut/pine nut. The results is no less delicious. Made a huge batch, so I skipped the parmesan to keep it longer in the fridge without preservatives. Add the cheese just while eating... each time tastes fresh!!

To lessen the bite of the garlic, dry-roast whole cloves in their skin in a skillet over med- high heat. Toast just till skins start to take on some color. I throw my pinenuts or whatever nuts I am using in at that time and cook a 1/2 minute longer. The garlic softens a bit and sweetens and the skins come off easily. Got this technique from Rick Bayliss and use it often. For a "nuttier" flavor, toast a little longer. I often use a mix of pan-roasted and raw garlic for depth of flavor. A very nice pesto recipe. Reliable.

Agree that it's a basic pesto recipe, but must admit to liking the pesto recipe from the Silver Palate cookbook more.

A few more tips: Don't blanch the garlic if you think the garlic flavor is too strong - simply use less. Blanch the basil only if freezing or saving in the fridge for a few days to retain green color. Salty flavor is a result of a poor quality cheese - use the best! For an authentic Ligurian dish, serve mixed with cooked, peeled and quartered new potatoes and cooked, halved green beans over trofie pasta (a small twisted shape).

Foolproof pesto - I toast the pinenuts and use just a bit less oil, and it's truly delicious. I freeze small servings in ice cube trays and pop out individual cubes for pasta, a zippy addition to soup, etc.

The best pesto recipe I've ever made! I made it this last time with a mixture of 1 cup globe basil, 1 cup cinnamon basil, and 2 cups sweet basil - - all from my garden. I also toasted the pine nuts, added an extra clove of garlic and a splash of lemon juice to brighten things up a bit. My family LOVES this on everything from pizza, chicken, and bruschetta, to a filling for grilled stuffed tomatoes -- YUM! Next I'm going to use it for the base in a basalmic vinaigrette on an heirloom tomato and mozzarella salad. I've never had a problem with the salt level... but that may be due to the blend of cheeses I use.

Nice recipe for pesto. For the reviewer who wants to maintain the beautiful green colour, add 1 T of fresh parsley to the food processor. The parsley gives the pesto a nice added flavour boost and doesn't detract from the basil.

a great pesto recipe. i would recommend blanching the basil leaves in boiling water for a couple of seconds and then plungin into an ice bath. this will preserve the bright color of the basil. make sure to squeeze all the water out of the basil leaves before adding to the food processor.

To make this diary-free, I used 2/3 C pine nuts and only 1/3 C olive oil. It was delicious! I liked the higher proportions of basil, salt, and garlic to the olive oil in this recipe. The outcome was much more flavorful than that of another recipe on this site.

Very nice recipe, although I disagree that a blender is better, that didn't work so well for me. I do wish that the basil was specified by weight and not volume - 4 c of basil can vary a lot depending on how well you pack it! I think other reviewers' issues with too much oil, salt or garlic may have been because they didn't have enough basil - with 4 packed-in cups the rest of the ingredients were well-balanced.

Yummy! If you ever tried store-bought pesto and didn't like it, you should give this recipe a try. Pesto is one of those things that is really only good if made fresh. I cut the oil down a bit (to 1/3 c), added more pine nuts (maybe a 1/4 c) and cheese (you really can't add too much Parm as far as I'm concerned). I also added the cheese AFTER processing. Don't add salt until after you add cheese for you may not need it. This pesto is soooo yummy. Received many complements.

Perfect pesto recipe! I followed the recipe and I used fresh basil from my garden and a high quality olive oil. There were no left overs!

Rating: 4
This was delicious! I only used about two thirds of the recommended olive oil, and will probably go down to half the next time I make it. I wouldn't agree with reviewers who asked for less garlic or salt than recommended -- I actually had to throw a little more salt into the pasta at the end. I strongly recommend the Ligurian tip of mixing a ladle full of cooking water into the pesto just before adding the noodles. Toss, then let it sit for a couple of minutes so that the sauce really penetrates the noodles.

Just made this and love it. Would use a smidgeon less salt and garlic - maybe 3/4 next time.

This is really good. I took others suggestions and stirred in the cheeses after processing all the ingredients. I tried blanching the garlic first, to give it a milder flavor, but frankly it was too bland. Next time I make it I will add just one clove of fresh garlic.

Delish. I subbed almonds for pine nuts and added a couple of walnuts also. In retrospect, would have used less salt, but as another poster said, the saltiness may mellow out over a few days. Great recipe.

I have been making this recipe since I first received the Aug 2004 Bon Appetit. It is a staple in my kitchen. I prefer it over other recipes because it is more pungent with more of a salt "hit." I think one of the major problems with other pestos is the use of additional herbs and too little salt, resulting in a bland, weak basil flavor. This recipe takes care of those problems. It is by far the best I've encountered.

This was amazing. I did a little pesto research on the side, and found something that said that pesto is not supposed to be about the garlic, but instead about showcasing fresh basil. I agree, and attribute my lack of interest in pesto in the past to the overwhelming garlic content it usually possesses when ordered in a restaurant or bought at the store. I used my blender, although true pesto should be chunkier/grittier and produced with a mortar/pestal. In this case I needed more of a paste (my picky husband won't eat anything with chunks in it- [rolling my eyes]), so I used the blender. It came out flavorful, and with a perfect consistency. I only added a pinch of salt, which was all it needed, and one clove of garlic. I served it with the lemon chicken and fried capers dish from this sight. Delicious and summery. This will be a staple for us!

Really great. I made this in two batches, using two different olive oils from Alejandro & Martin - a "green and grassy" and "fragrant and fruity." I mixed the two batches together and added coarse ground sea salt after blending. Absolutely wonderful. This will be great on insalate caprese, and I plan to use it to try and reproduce my favorite restaurant recipe, Fettuccini with pesto, rock shrimp, artichoke hearts and tomatoes concasse.

Another rave review for this pesto. A tip from Marcella Hazan: If you're going to freeze a batch of pesto, don't include the cheese(s). Beat them in freshly grated, after thawing, right before you'll use it. It makes a much fresher-tasting pesto.

I have made pesto countless times but every one of my recipes is marked up -- usually "too much olive oil." I made this one last night and it was glorious (I prefer the food processor to the blender). Just added one more garlic clove - now it will be my go-to pesto. Served mixed with penne it was a perfect accompaniment to grilled steak & tuna and corn on the cob - with blueberries in creme anglaise to round out the easy summer menu.

OK, fellow chefs... This recipe kicks butt! Due to the abundance of basil I had growing, I doubled the recipe, and added fresh mint as well (borrowed from another recipe courtesy of Food TV). B/c of increasing the recipe, I *think* I used 1 c. TOASTED pine nuts, and 2-ish cups flaked parmesan cheese, plus.. I'm not sure... like 20ish mint leaves. At any rate, I poured in more E.V.O.O. (extra virgin olive oil), and maybe a spoonful more minced garlic, and this recipe could not be any better. Like a previous poster, I could eat this recipe by the pint. (ps- I used a food processor and not a blender and it is more "chunky" than in the blender... I like it that way)

This recipe is sooooo easy! I avoided making pesto because I don't have a food processor - this recipe gave me the reassurance that one can use a blender, and yes, it turns out great, as good as stuff you can buy. No, not as good... BETTER! At first this pesto always tastes a little too salty to me (and I like salt), but after chilling for an hour or so it settles down and tastes perfect. You may wish to experiment carefully with the amount of salt, though. I don't have access to a cheap source for basil, but this is still a much better value than store-bought. Plus, I actually eat out less now that I have such a wonderful dish I can quickly make (11 minutes!) at home.

My daughter and I loved our trip to the Cinque Terre in Italy, the Ligurian birthplace of pesto. When our last jar of the real deal ran out, we had to find a fascimile. This is the closest recipe we have found. Use homegrown basil, toasted pignoli, and the best cheese you can afford. Fabulous!

Have made this recipe a couple of times, and to me it is a perfect pesto. Just the right blend of everything. This recipe is SO easy, I can't imagine anybody buying pesto after they've made this.

If you intend to freeze the pesto, I always leave out cheese, nuts and garlic and make a simple base of basil, olive oil, salt and pepper. I then freeze it in ice cube trays, once frozen I transfer them to a freezer bag, and then you can grab one and throw it into anything that calls for pesto or basil.

This pesto is great! I used only parm too- it's what I had on hand. Pesto does freeze well; leave out the nuts and cheese and freeze everything else. After thawing, mix the rest together. This is really convenient if you have lots of basil at once; after freezing you can thaw and make it as you need it.

Also used only the Parm. Pesto was terrific, got rave reviews.

Good basic pesto recipe. I also only used Parm. cheese and omitted the salt. As I still have tons of basil in my garden I will use this recipe again. Walnuts work great too, if you are out of pine nuts.

Excellent. I used 14 cups of basil from my garden (and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly--and used only Parmesan.) In the many years I have made pesto, I have learned to have about 30% extra of Parmesan, roasted pine nuts, and basil on hand so I can add them as needed to acheive the perfect flavor and consistency.

This is a very good recipe and like the previous reviewer, on target for our tastes. I preferred the pesto slightly heated to reduce the intensity of the raw garlic.

I agree with others that this should be used as a guideline but it's pretty much on-target for my tastes. I just made a batch last night and it was divine (didn't have any Pecorino, used just Parm. Reg., so I left out the salt). Just today someone told me to try pistachios instead of pine nuts, so I'll have to give that a try and wanted to share it. Trader Joe's has unsalted pistachios, which are useful in many recipes.

I don't like garlic in Pesto so I don't add any. I agree with a previous message about using the very best cheese you can find. I've made Pesto for a number of years using a very similiar recipe. I have trouble finding good pine nuts where I now live, but I do have pecan trees. So I made Pesto with pecans. It's quite good. I always use a food processor because I don't like smooth Pesto. Everything is in small bits, even the basil. I hope there is Pesto in heaven. If there is none, well, I'll have to give some thought to even going.

The best way to make pesto is to use the proportions above only as a guideline and adjust for flavor. If you get fresh garlic, for example, it will be MUCH stronger and more flavorful than that from the store. My suggestions: 1) get the best parmesan cheese you can afford. Go for the $14+ a pound stuff--you don't need much and you won't be disappointed. 2) Blend the garlic, pine nuts, cheese, salt, and pepper with most of the olive oil first. Don't grate the cheese in, just chop it up and chunk it in the blender. I use a 2 cup Cuisinart food processor. It is perfect for a 2-4 person batch of pesto. Blending everything but the basil first makes it easier to adjust the flavor. It's hard to blend in additional nuts or garlic if you've already added the basil. 3) Add basil just until it tastes right, coating with a bit more olive oil before blending. 4) Try substituting walnuts for the pine nuts. I like this variety slightly better than the pine nuts, but my fiancee prefers the pine nuts, so that's what she gets. :-) I hope these suggestions help. Of course, the best tip is to use home grown basil. It does very well in pots in almost all climates. If you live in the Boston area, check out the "Small Farm" organic pick-your-own in Stow, MA.

The best pesto I've ever eaten was in a tiny village on the Ligurian Coast. It was heavenly and made me truely appreciate pesto for the first time. With the freshest ingredients, this recipe comes very close. I prefer to use solely Pecorino Romano for the extra bite it adds compared to Parmigiano-Reggiano. This is also the first time I've used a blender, and it did make a smoother sauce. Great tip!

This recipe is close to one I have had handed down from my in-laws who spent many years in Italy. It's made in the blender. Their version is called pesto alla genovese (from Genoa) and has butter, milk and water taken from the boiling pasta added. I'm always in favor of adding as much garlic as my guests can handle! To freeze a base to be used in the winter take the fresh basil leaves (I grow them in a pot on my deck) and fill the blender (about 5 cups) and add a pinch of salt and 1/2 cup of olive oil. Freeze . When defrosted add the remaining incredients and throw over pasta. With the butter recipe you can also use it to make pesto bruchetta, put over hot veggies, etc.

For a nuttier twist on this, try toasting the pine nuts before blending. It is less subtle, but a really interesting change to ordinary pesto!

Rating: 4
This was sensational, although a little thick to blend. I added a little more olive oil, and that helped some. Then I just used a little less oil on top while storing in the fridge, and covered directly on top of the pesto with plastic wrap. In another recipe review, someone suggested blanching the basil briefly and then into an ice bath, then squeeze dry, to help preserve the beautiful color. I did that, and although it's an extra step, the color is wonderful. This sure beats the store-bought variety!!!!
