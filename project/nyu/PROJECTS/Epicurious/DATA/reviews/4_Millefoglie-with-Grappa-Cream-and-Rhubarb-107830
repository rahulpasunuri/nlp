So delicious! It took some time to make and it was so worth it. I skipped the grappa and served with homemade vanilla ice cream. This is my new favorite recipe for rhubarb.

While the taste of this was incredible, the presentation was not nearly as easy. Everything sort of sank into a sad little heap. The grappa cream is a definite keeper, you can't go wrong with rhubarb (though I recommend smaller pieces, because my large ones failed to absorb the sugar in the short cooking time required to keep them from falling apart) and store-bought pastry - well, that isn't too exciting. Make the cream and eat it with strawberries!

It is a keeper for the family. We used Lemoncello instead of grapa.

Is it just me or does cutting out 12 squares not add up to making 8 servings? I only needed 6 servings though so it all worked out. Excellent! And easier than it looks.

This is a delicious dessert. What a treat in spring with fresh rhubarb. It is easy enough to make and quite versatile. I discovered too late that my package of puff pastry was not sheets but shells. So I just filled the shells with the fruit and custard and topped with the lids and the sauce. The next day I used the ingredients again to roll in crepes I had left over. The ingredients keep well in the refrigerator for several days, so it is a good recipe for small households (we are 2). Oh, I just read the recipe again and realized that I forgot to add the whipped cream to the custard. It was rich and delicious without it. I will have to try it the next time.
