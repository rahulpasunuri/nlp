I was a bit disappointed in this recipe. It looks like it has all the elements of a great lettuce roll but it was missing something. I think the sauce is too simple. Next time I will serve with peanut sauce as well as a citrus/soy sauce and add basil and bean sprouts to the herb plate.

I've made this over & over & it's always a hit, especially with the carb-phobic. I make rice noodle vermicelli, pickle the vegetables in rice vinegar, sugar & salt and I put sprigs of cilantro, basil and mint in each roll.

This is a great recipe -- I used half the fish sauce and tons of garlic! Leave out the meat and it is an excellent vegetarian snack -- just roll up and dip!!

I've made this dish a few times, and it is always well-received. I've also used cooked prawns for the meat and that has worked well. The arrangement on a platter is really pretty as well.

This dish is yummy (if you like the taste of fish sauce). The fish sauce is salty enough without adding salt and it's not necessary to serve extra with the rolls. I tried adding some noodles as others suggested, and for me it didn't really add much. Can't wait to make it again.

Rice noodles would definitely add something. I would find a stronger tasting meat because the lime and sugar were a little overwhelming with the cilantro, but it was still great with the beef. I left off the mint and added more pepper. Overall - it was a great finger food meal and would be great for a small group to share while chatting (a little too messy for a big group or appetizers).

My husband adores this dish. I made it with Thai noodles and sweet walnut shrimp. He gave me the best compliment on my cooking yet!!! I would make more of the sauce next time. A great "company" dish!

Our friends had a Thai dinner for six - I brought this dish as an appetizer and everyone LOVED it! The other gals wanted the recipe, and I am already planning to serve it as a casual main dish. We especially loved the sauce! I did add rice noodles to the platter.

I added fresh basil so it tasted very Vietnamese. Next time I will put in some cold very thin rice noodles.

I made this for supper tonight, and we loved it! The sauce was very authentic tasting--just like in a good Thai or Vietnamese restaurant. I used serrano peppers in the saucce, and added fresh bean sprouts to the rolls. We will definitely be having this again!

Too much fish sauce. But even so, I wouldn't make this one again...
