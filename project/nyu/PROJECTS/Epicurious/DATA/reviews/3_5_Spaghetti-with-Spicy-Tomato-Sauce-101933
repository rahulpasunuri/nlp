One of our favorites. If no oregano is available, rosemary makes a nice substitute in the herbs. Also, you can heat the sauce at the end on high and toss the pasta in it. Soaks it all up very nicely.

This is a perfect dish, but only if you use perfect ingredients - perfectly ripe cherry tomatoes from the garden or farmer's market (not! supermarket tomatoes), fresh garlic, basil and oregano, top-quality cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil, good pasta (worth making fresh for) and great sea salt. Everything is here in all of the most perfect simplicity of summer flavors.

This not only makes the house smell good, it tastes even better. A real treat. Use the good parmesan if you can for added authenticity.

Very simple and fresh tasting. The heat of the chiles was a nice addition.

We rate this 6 on a scale of 4. Our all time favorite pasta dish! We make this all the time. Sometimes we mix red and yellow cherry tomatos for some added color. We also use other herbs if the oregano isn't fresh: rosemary, thyme, etc. We also add extra chiles at times for extra spice

The epitome of wonderful Italian cooking! Simple, fresh ingredients. This recipe appears in a wonderful article in Gourmet July'99 about the island of Capri. Try it as well as the FARFALLE CON ZUCCHINI ("BOW-TIE" PASTA WITH ZUCCHINI). Motto bene!

This is a wonderful summer recipe that takes little time to prepare. I've also been making this since July'99. I've used the cherry tomatoes, grape tomatoes, tomatoes from my garden, also orange and yellow tomatoes (which gives a nice presentation). Since this recipe, I always keep the dried chiles on hand.

I''ve been making this dish since it first appeared on Gourmet's cover last summer. It's a favorite in our house. I usually subsitute one of the herbs for fresh rosemary and use grape tomatoes.

Tasty. Nothing stupendous, but good and quite simple.

I used all the ingredients mentioned but also took the liberty of adding a portion of Chardonnay to the sauce. I would also recommend some young grated Parmesan cheese as a side serving. This is a remarkable early evening summer dish, it's tasty and easy to prepare.

This recipe was a welcome surprise. I wasn't sure we would like the sauce because it was so different from the usual spaghetti recipes I make, but I wanted to use some of the cherry tomatoes in our garden. My husband and I both loved it, and we never needed the Parmesan cheese I had on the table "just in case." I followed the recipe exactly, using a New Mexico dried chile, and will definitely make this recipe again.

Yes, this is a good one. You should not be disappointed. It was indeed delicious and quick. But I don't think it was 4 Forks: "A dish beyond compare". This place needs wider rating system.

I used fresh, hand peeled Roma tomatoes. A very nice dish for a warm summer evening

This is such a yummy summer dish. The tomatoes are remarkably sweet. It's just enough for two as a main course; next time I'll double the recipe. Today I'm longing for leftovers, and I know my guest would have gone for seconds.
