I forgot to add that the chicken needs longer to cook than what the recipe says.

I have made this recipe several times and it has always been a hit. Even my husband who thought he didn't like okra raved about it. It is spicy so if you are fixing it for someone who doesn't like spice, just adjust the cayenne. I usually double the sauce because I like it saucy.

Really wonderful, complex flavors, and the dish came together really quickly - suitable for weeknights. I used chicken thighs instead of whole legs and didn't bother to grind up the seeds; for those looking to add some more vegetables to the dish, fresh chili peppers and carrots go really well in this dish - just add them with the water.

I made this recipe exactly as written and thought that it was very good. Give it a try. I made it with spiced basmati rice and thought they went well together.

This was excellent - it looked and tasted like something from a good Indian restaurant. I found it a little to hot with 1/2t of cayenne - would make it with 1/4t next time.

I loved this recipe! Very easy and good - made just as directed except substituted boneless skinless chicken thighs. This is going on the regular list!

I've already made this dish twice. It's great! I use russets for the potatoes. It gets a bit mushy but gives a nice cocoon for the spicy chicken.

This dish was absolutely delicious! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used chicken broth, and I also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Young, fresh okra is a must, but I think you could also use fresh green beans. A must try dish!! My husband and son LOVED it!

Dekicious dish. Okra works so well in this recipe, I wouldn't recommend any substitute. I made it several times already and will certainly make it again.

This dish got rave reviews. I substituted coconut water (not coconut milk) for the water and left out the brown sugar. I also substituted chinese long beans for the oakra based on others' reviews. Finally, I added a couple chili peppers for a kick. Yum!

Lordy, this is a good dish! My whole family rates it a FOUR, including our ten year old granddaughter. Instead of the water, I used chicken broth. Otherwise, I prepared the dish as written.

The result was great! Although the okras were a bit too cooked, and didn't taste much as people said before. The next time I'll chop okra coarsely, stir-fry a bit at the beginning, remove it, and put it back to the skillet at the end.

The chicken and potatoes turned out very well, but the okra was not tasty at all. My husband who has never liked anything with curry loved this dish. I had to cook the chicken much longer than the recipe called for.

This ia a great ish and easy to make. I didn't have any curry powder so, I just used cumin which is part of curry anyway. I think this would make a great vegetarian dish because the best part is the potatoes. I think it could use more lemon and next time I will add about anothr 2 tablespoons.

Really easy and a great dish. We couldn't find okra at this time of year, so used green beans instead -- it still worked.

This dish definitely satisfied my curry craving. It was fun and easy to prepare; a good balance between a simple, one dish required for cooking recipe and something that presents very well on the table. The aromas produced throughout the preparation were also wonderful. I lengthened the cooking times by 5-10 minutes since I like chicken cooked to the 'fall off the bone' stage. This my have caused the potatoes and okra to be a bit overcooked though and I would follow the recommended times for the vegetables next time.

I substituted diced fresh tomato for the tomato paste and chicken stock for the water. Cooking took longer than expected. This dish is very tasty with complicated flavors, but either more cayenne or a few hot peppers would add more spiciness.

Pretty good dish only I would substitute chicken broth for water and defintely use less oil.

this is a great starting point. once you have made it, you can substitute anything and it would still be great!

Great potential. But this dish will need some work to stay in my repetoire. Next time I will substitute diced tomatoes and wine for the paste and water mixture. Needs a little more spice. I plan to add a hot pepper in the spice mixture and place in the food processor. Thickly slice the pototoes and salt when the chicken is added. The okra will be tough if you cook it only 10 minutes at that step. I will keep you posted on the results. Okra is plentiful in Florida this time of year.

This was good but not exciting. Nice to do something different with okra.
