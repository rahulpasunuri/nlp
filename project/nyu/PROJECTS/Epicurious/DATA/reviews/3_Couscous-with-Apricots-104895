Better than plain cous cous, but nothing exciting. I don't know that I will make it again.

I also used chicken broth instead of water. The coriander gives the couscous a light toasty flavor. I thought it was okay, but I've made better.

Instead of all the fuss of roasting and grinding coriander seeds, why not use ground ? We enjoy the flavors with Olive-Stuffed Chicken with Almonds.

As written, I gave it 3 forks. The 2nd time, I used chicken broth instead of water, cilantro instead of parsley, and only 1 Tbsp. total olive oil. Excellent. Great with grilled, broiled, or roast meat, and poultry.

Really easy. A nice side dish that is a step above the usual.

Good but not great. Substituted garam masala for the coriander, and golden raisins for the apricots. It all worked and was very good, particularly with the lamb chops with yogurt-mint sauce.

Substitute cialntro for the parsley, use Israeli couscous, and it makes a great cold salad!

So easy and yet a great pick me up for cous-cous. Terrific with yogurt mint lamb chops. My guests were impressed.
