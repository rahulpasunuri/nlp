Easy - delicious - wonderful flavors. Not a big cantaloupe fan to start, but am a big fan of this neat little recipe!

Wonderful flavors. I just put it all in the blender and made a fabulous chilled soup out of it!

really nice! i don't use any sugar and up the honey, but i've done it with the sugar and it's good both ways. it's a great side for summer meals like fish tacos, and it's also FANTASTIC over icecream, so it does double duty!

i hate it when people review a recipe and then tell you how they changed it, but here goes - i didn't add the 3 tbsp of sugar, instead i added 1/2 tsp of sugar and one more tsp of honey. it was great! served it as a side with fish tacos and it was nice and spicy and sweet, but not too sweet and refreshing and easy. my boyfriend who doesn't really like fresh herbs loved it. definitely making again.

I have made this for many potlucks and always have people ask me for the recipe. It will be the salad tonight with teriyaki chicken. I just love this salad.

I can't recall another recipe that quite shouts 'Summer's Here!!!' with greater conviction. I am always annoyed when I pick out what appears to be a perfect cantaloupe, only to cut it open and realize that it is either 'not quite there' in terms of ripeness, or just 'not quite there' in terms of flavor. This recipe will rescue those otherwise forgettable fruits that we are tempted to ditch. Refreshing, simultaneously tart and sweet, and the ginger gives it just the right kick. This is a definite keeper!

Made a couple of little changes based on what I had in the kitchen. Made the recipe as listed or as close as you can when you eyeball everything. Had a few fresh blueberries that I didn't want to go another day so I threw them in and used raspberry flavored honey from a little farm in Southern Idaho. All it did was pump up the flavor even more. Fresh mint out of our garden gave it a nice crisp taste and the slight warmth of the ginger made a fantastic contrast to the sweetness of the melon and berries. Definite keeper recipe .

This is probably my favorite cantaloupe recipe. The lime really makes it sing, and the ginger adds a nice warm finish. Great way to jazz up cantaloupe when you can't stand to get any more in your CSA. I think having ripe cantaloupe is key.

This is my all time favorite fruit salad recipe. If summer had a taste it would be this. Cold, sweet cantaloupe with the bite of spicy ginger, crispness of lime and freshness of mint- -To Die For! For those who did not like it, I can only say you must have had poor quality ingredients.

This is a really nice contrast of tastes and color. I will make it again. It would be great to add to a summer buffet/brunch table.

I used one cantaloupe and 1/2 of the other ingredients because I didn't have enough lime juice. Still delicious. I agree you must have a tasty cantaloupe to begin with.

Delicious. No need for sugar--the honey is enough. I used a bag of grapes instead because cantaloupe wasn't in season. Truly a great, refreshing dish. As my friend said, it's an "explosion" of amazing flavor in your mouth.

I also forgot to add that I used honey instead of white sugar, so maybe that made a difference. YUM

I agree with Jacksonville. I made this for a light dessert for friends a few weeks ago. I love how the ginger, mint and lime interplayed with the sweetness of the melon. Delicious. I mixed everything very well before I tossed it with the mellon and used a fine grater for the ginger. I also let it sit in the fridge for several hours before serving. If you like the combo of ginger and lime you will like this!

I reviewed this recipe several years ago and gave it four forks. It is a great, refreshing and different fruit salad which I have made numerous times for occasions like Mother's Day breakfast as well as even for a side salad at summer meals. I'm not sure where my past review disappeared to, and I'm very disappointed to see 16 reviews, all from the same reviewer, giving it one fork. Don't be put off by the unfair overall user rating. Give this recipe a try.

This recipe just doesn't taste good. I followed the recipe as written and everyone in my family, who are used to a variety of flavors, hated this. Even the fruit-loving DOG wouldn't eat it. It tasted too strongly of ginger which isn't the best accent to fruit.

I think the success of this salad depends solely on the quality of the cantaloupe. I bought a Japanese cantaloupe that was very sweet and the result was amazing. Although, I would probably classify this more as a fruit salad, for dessert.

Even for people who dislike eating fruit, this recipe is perfect. We made it for dessert and then had it again for breakfast in the morning!

disgusting. maybe my mint was old...? in any case, it ruined the dish. i ended up picking out melon bits and wiping them down before eating.

cantaloupes have never been my favorite....i had half a left over cantaloupe and didn't want to waste it, so i tried this recipe. it was fast, easy and really yummy.

I think the success of this recipe lies greatly with the quality of the cantalope used. The first time we made it, it was wonderful (or there wouldn't have been a second time :-) but the second time it was barely edible. Our second effort unfortunately involved a skunky melon! Our third time we insured the quality of our melon, and again got rave reviews from our guests as well as enjoying it ourselves!

Truly the worst recipe I have ever had off of Epicurious. There was just something very wrong about the taste. We had it both plain and with the ice cream, which did not improve the taste. Vile.

Honestly, I wasn't crazy about this dish. I really expected to love it, but it was just okay. I'm not a big cantaloupe fan, but even my roommates who really like it didn't find this fruit salad to be anything special. Not bad, just not great.

I've made this twice, once to accompany an Indian style salmon with curry and mango chutney, then with barbecued pork tenderloins. Both got rave reviews and recipe requests. Next time I'll try it with a mix of fruits.

i made this for brunch today and got rave reviews! the great part about this recipe is that it's really adaptable. i added watermelon, blueberries, and nectarines--the ginger & mint gave the fruit salad a really nice flavor. i definitely recommend making this!

Simple and delicious! I discovered I didn't have any honey while halfway through, so I used vanilla syrup from a popular coffee chain instead. Worked just fine. Can't wait to try it again with the honey, though. Oh, and Go Dawgs!

I found this while searching for something to serve with Mother's Day breakfast. It was a hit. Just made it again this morning because the unique flavor had lingered in my mind and I found I had a yearning for it every time I ate cantaloupe. Simple to make, very refreshing, and turns a serving of fruit into something special.

Wow . . . was this good ! The flavor was right up my alley. Refreshing, sweet and tart. And it looked pretty in the bowl. I made it exactly as stated and served it as part of a brunch. You should definitely eat it within 2 hours of making.

I serverd this with grilled meats and vegetables. I added fresh blueberries. this can be served without the honey, ginger sauce, leaving the cantelope, lime and mint refreshing the palate.

I served this as a first course - slices of canteloupe draped with proscuitto and drizzled with the mint sauce. Excellent!

Fantastic and refreshing dessert served with vanilla ice cream. Best served within a couple of hours of making.
