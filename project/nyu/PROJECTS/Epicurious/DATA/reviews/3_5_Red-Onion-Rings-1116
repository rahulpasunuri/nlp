I have been making these onion rings for nearly 16 years and they continue to be the best. These are always requested by everyone when we have friends over, and my family looks forward to them all the time. As a matter of fact, when one of the family isn't around and we are having them, everyone will call the one who isn't there to gloat that they are having the onion rings and the other isn't.

Disappointing. I followed this recipe to a T -- even using a ruler to measure the depth of the oil and a thermometer to check its temperature -- and I'd call the results a total flop. After soaking the onion slices for a full hour, I found the marination had done nothing to help the coating stick: 45 seconds in boiling oil did nothing but wash these onions off -- they came out pale and naked. Cook in batches, my eye! After doing so, I had to dump the whole onion right back in the oil to darken, harden, and more fully fry the rings. Finally, rather than dispose of the results, I placed them on top of fully condimented burgers. They lent a pleasant but subtle flavor, but wow -- going through this whole production was totally unnecessary. We could have achieved a similar result by simply caramelizing some onions in a fry pan. This was a total waste of a new bottle of corn oil, and a near-total waste of a perfectly good onion.

This is the best onion ring recipe I have made. It was very easy. They are a big hit with my family. I substitute regular milk for buttermilk and they still taste great.

This was so easy to make. I used a regular onion instead of a red onion. It was fantasic. Will definately make it again.
