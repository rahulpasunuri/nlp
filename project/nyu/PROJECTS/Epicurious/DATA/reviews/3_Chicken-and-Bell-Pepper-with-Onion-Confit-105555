I thought this was a good starting point for an excellent dish. I really think there was way more oil than needed. The flavors could have developed more with some serrano or habanero. I served this with a mixed wild rice, which gave a nice nutty ground to the tangy tart of the peppers and lemon.

Very disappointed in this recipe. Halved the recipe since it was just my boyfriend and I and the Confit was nothing but drowning in olive oil and the sauce was overly lemony. Would not make again.

Really enjoyed this recipe. My modifications: used far less olive oil and lemon juice than what was called for. Used just enough OO to saute the confit. Used maybe a tablespoon of lemon juice and a bit of olive oil in the pureee. Used the liquid we drained from the confit instead. Also added garlic and a fair amount of red pepper flakes for some kick. Great flavor! Would definitely make again.

I had chicken breasts, peppers and onions I needed to cook and found this recipe, so I decided to try it based on the comments. It was very delicious. I love olive oil and garlic so this was right up my alley. Like the other comments, I altered the recipe using shallots and onion I had left over. I used half a chicken bouillon with 1 cup of water. I made three chicken breasts and the sauce seemed to make enough for that. I'd have to make more sauce for more breasts. Definitely would make again although it's very time consuming.

I made this before and gave it 2-3 forks; now 4 forks with these changes: for 2 chicken breasts - 2 red bell peppers, 4 medium shallots plus the other confit ingredients, sauteed in 3 Tablespoons olive oil with 1/2 rich chicken boullion/ broth; reduce. Then, half the veggie mixture in the blender with 2 Tablespoons lemon juice, 1 Tablespoon olive oil, 2 Tablespoons butter, and 1 teaspoon sugar. No more than a wave- over of cayenne. These few changes make this sauce much more complex and rich.

This was a quick decision for chicken already thawed, I used the boneless skinless breasts on hand and eliminated the oven baking part. I will increase the olive oil and decrease the lemon juice by about 1/4 each part for the confit next time. Served it with orzo pasta, and roma tomato and frisee salad with dijon dressing. The 2000 Pinot Grigio was a compliment. Quick dinner and delightfully different.

Easy to make, but really just so-so results. There's nothing special about this dish.

This is a very good recipe. The secret really lies in the flavor of the onions and peppers. It is excellent served on a bed of garlicky mashed potatoes.

I think that this dish didn't have much flavor in it, which suprised me. I wouldn't make it again.

I give this a 4 only after some major adjustments. Including the oil for sauteing the chicken, I used a total of 9 tablespoons.Since I used only approximately 3 tablespoons for the vegetables, I did not drain since I would have drained away the flavor. I used a mixture of half lemon juice and balsamic vinegar giving it a smoother flavor. Chicken in oven for only 9-10 minutes instead of 12. Sauce is great on pork as well. Will make again in my "defatted" version.

This worked out very nicely. However, I would reduce the lemon juice just a bit and as others have said, use a lot less oil. Excellent dish.

We love this combination of flavors and this was no exception. The chicken was wonderfully juicy. In fact this sept 2001 issue of Bon Appetit is one of my favorite.Too bad more of the recipes aren't on this site. I reach for it again and again.

I give it 2 forks for the juicy chicken breasts - what a great way to cook them. However, the confit was disappointing: too much oil, too much lemon juice, not a great combination of flavors. I will definitely cook the chicken in this manner, but under an entirely different sauce :(

We have made this a number of times and have had rave reviews from our guests. It is a wonderful way to cook chicken and the left over sauce makes a great "mayo" for sandwiches. I plan to try it for a gluten free meal by using cornstarch to coat the chicken

We love this recipe and have made it several times. Very impressive looking when serving to guests. We do cut down on the oil, though.

This recipe is a sure-fire winner. I often make it with pork loin instead of chicken - slice a whole loin into tournedos, pound (or not), and treat it like the chicken. The sauce compliments it beautifully. I either drastically reduce the oil or else pour it off before I'm done and use it for other dishes - it's nice with pasta or fish, or as the oil to make slow roasted tomatoes also on this site.

I cut way back on the oil for this recipe and didn't use all the confit to serve over the chicken- it looked nice but I nor the people I served it too really cared for the taste.

I cut way back on the oil to saute the peppers and still thought it was too oily when plated. Too much lemon juice as well. Seemed like quite a bit of effort for fried peppers and chicken.

I accidentally made this without the lemon juice and it was much better. Now I just omit the lemon juice.

This was our casual Christmas dinner. It was very tasty, if also very mild in flavor. Like others, I cut way back on the oil both for the sauteing and for the sauce; if you cut back the oil in the sauce, be sure to adjust the lemon juice as well, so its flavor doesn't overwhelm th delicate flavor of the confit. Next time I think I'll throw in some capers for more zing. Served this with spinach fettucini, which for beautiful holiday colors on the plate.

This was one of the most exciting chicken dishes I have made in a long time. I agree with everyone the olive oil can be cut back on. Fantastic flavor and presentation. I will definitely make it again and again.

This is a great dish for entertaining. It's pretty easy and the presentation is beautiful. I highly recommend, even for larger parties...

Great dish! Added a dash of tabasco to the sauce and a squirt of honey which turned out to be the perfect finishing touch! Served with Congris (Cuban black beans and rice). Definitely a keeper.

Great weeknight recipe - didn't cut down on oil, as other reviews suggested but next time I will. Too much olive oil wasted - otherwise a terrific dish.

What a fantastic recipe!!! I thought that it would be complicated to make. Boy, was I wrong. We had a dinner party and everyone raved about it. They think I'm Emeril Lagase or something. I would make this again in a heartbeat. Rona Rempel, Ontario Canada

Everyone is right about the olive oil-way too much! I only used 1/4 cup to saute the peppers (also only used one red pepper instead of the two called for) and onions, and it was fine with that amount. I also only added about 1 tbs. of oil to the mixture once it was in the blender. Everything tasted just fine, and I would make it again.

I've made this recipe four times in the past month for four different audiences. It's always received great reviews. First time it was for a Gourmet Club dinner--it was my "assignment". I have since cut down on the oil, added much more lemon juice to the sauce, and I always triple the recipe! For the person who asked if you puree all the peppers, the answer is you puree a portion of them for the sauce, the rest you serve under the chicken. The sauce is fabulous. We served this dish with fresh baby arugula in sesame oil. Arugula with the pepper sauce is great, too! Definitely one worth keeping.

Made this for supper with two chicken breasts but followed other cook's advice and still made full recipe of peppers and sauce. Cut oil down to 1/2 cup for sauteeing and again followed other cook's advice and saved flavored oil--will use it drizzled on baked fish. My partner loved this--myself I would have given three forks but he says four--so why not give him a say sometimes:^)He loved how the citrussy sauce complemented the chicken and confit. Served this with wild rice.

Haven't tried this recipe yet, but I'm sure it's going to be great (just as other Epicurious recipes are). I do have one question. Are all the bell peppers pured only part of them? The instructions seem to be a bit ambiguous to me. If someone could clarify this bit of information for me, I surely would appreciate it.

This dish has a lot of potential. I used about half of the oil called for in the recipe and could have cut back even more. Also, the sauce was a bit bland for my taste so I added a little salt, more lemon joice, and tabasco. This improved it dramatically.

The dish was easy to prepare and the presentation was lovely, but the flavor of the dish was unremarkable. You can get by with alot less oil. More peppers would be nice too.

I thought this was an excellent dish -- a very unique flavor. Like the other reviewers, I thought the amount of oil could be cut back quite a bit -- I used only a 1/2 cup for sauteeing the peppers, and it could've been reduced more than that. I served with couscous and it was a big hit (looks very pretty, too).

I halved this recipe for my husband and I and we loved it! The sauce is wonderful! Next time I would use about half the oil when sauteeing the onions and peppers and I would make more sauce. If you want to double the sauce and are using the confit as the vegie, use a full recipe (for 2) of the confit/sauce ingredients and process 1/2 to 3/4 cup of the vegies for the sauce. I served this with roasted new potatoes. Great dinner and wonderful presentation for company.

This is a wonderful dish. I've made it 3 times now, twice for company. It's very simple to prepare and has a wonderful flavor. I served it on top of a rice pilaf. I cut back on the olive oil substantially and it still tasted great.
