Great base recipe!! I used andouille sausage which gave the recipe a spicy kick. I pureed half of the sausage with the rest of the ingredients and added the other half back to the puree. Throughout the cooking process I did add additional water as well as a cup of mashed potatoes and about 1/2 cup sour cream. I also used the gouda as a garnish and did not make the gouda toasts. It was a hit!

Made a variation of this for a Pea Soup contest in my family. I despise pea soup with a passion, but liked this one! I wish I would have known to / thought of: 1) Clean the sausage out of the soup before cutting. It makes much nicer bits, especially for the croutons. 2) If I am to ever make this again, I will cut the sausage to half and I will not return the sausage after purée. I would serve them on top of the soup and perhaps have a bowl of cut sausage for those who prefer more. One comment was made that it was ''ham soup''. After reading the comments, I chose to: Purée the soup to make it more potage and higher end tasting. I also added coloured carrots 30 minutes in.

The cloves and thyme were unusual but delicious inclusions. I'll make this again. I added three chopped carrots for sweetness and puréed the soup before returning the sausage. I'm on the fence about the hot German mustard toasts. It was a little strong for the subtle soup flavors. Twitter me @misterkevin

Tasty but turned out a bit thick in the end. Thin it out a bit with more stock and it would be great.

This is a great recipe for pea soup. I've already made it several times and its a great staple recipe. For the user who made it with turkey kielbasa - I agree it DOES NOT WORK with turkey - my soup came out bland and nothing special. Definitely use a GOOD pork kielbasa and I've also used a large ham bone before. I followed the recipe to a T the first time and it was great - I've also done it with carrots which are a great addition. I would definitely make this again and again!

I followed this recipe exactly except I used 3 cans of chicken broth instead of 4. The flavor was on the bland side and it needed a bit more kick. Perhaps it's because I used turkey kielbasa? Well, my search for a good pea soup continues...Overall this recipe yields a hearty, good soup, but nothing incredibly amazing.

My family loves this soup. Very creamy and tasty. I use half green and half yellow split peas.I also cook an additional kielbasa with chicken broth in another pot (so the soup does not get to salty) being my family loves the sausage. I have made this soup about 6 times and will continue. It is a keeper.

Wow! This was the perfect meal on a wintery cold January night. I used slightly more peas (20 oz) and less kielbasa (14 oz) simply because of the package sizes. The additional peas and an extra half hour of cooking resulted in a lovely thick puree. I read comments that some were underwhelmed by the toast, and with a small change, it was perfect to my taste. On lightly toasted sourdough slices, spread some spicy mustard, then a slice of tomato, with salt and freshly ground pepper. As I used all the kielbasa in the soup, I put only grated Gouda on top of the tomato slice and put under the broiler until the cheese melted. The tomato made a nice tangy contrast to the smooth pea soup. My husband loved the toasts so much he suggested that we make them as an hors d'oeuvre for company. I'm sure we will have this dish frequently.

Delicious! I have by choice not eaten split pea soup in something like 15 years. Now I will probably eat it every couple of months. Very tasty and I already had most of the ingredients on hand.

One of my Epicurious favorites, this recipe is a great crowd pleaser. It is easy to make in a crockpot for weeknight entertaining. It also looks elegant with the little Gouda toasts, but can be easily frozen and used as leftovers. Highly recommended. I used sage instead of thyme in a pinch--still worked great.

I pureed the soup although the recipe didn't mention it. It blended the flavors beautifully. I also cooked the soup with all the sausage but only added about 1/4 of the sausage to the puree. It was delicious even before adding the sausage to the puree. Add the Gouda a little at a time and see if you like the change in flavor. I don't think it needs all the cheese. Best pea soup I've ever had!

Made it vegan without the sausage/gouda and used veggie broth. Added one grated carrot. YUM. Will add one more carrot next time. A keeper.

Wow. I wasn't sure about the ground cloves but I am sold on it now. It added a depth of flavor that has been missing from my pea soup. I added grated carrots in the last 30 minutes

I used smoked gouda instead, it really added a wonderful depth of flavor. Highly recommend this recipe.

This is an excellent Split Pea Soup recipe! Made it as is and added a few chopped carrots for color and texture. It came out fabulously! Definately a keeper. And the toasts were an added bonus, but the soup would be wonderful even with some plain baguette pieces.

PS. I can only suggest to use top-quality gouda: it melts instantly. I don't understand why some of the other reviewers had trouble with that. Mine incorporated into the soup like magic.

If you like split pea soup, you will *love* this version. The soup itself is utstanding, exactly as written. Next time, I may omit the sausage from the cheese toasts, but they do add the extra touch to the meal. You won't be disappointed in this one.

This was excellent soup. I would add a little less broth next time (maybe 3 cans instead of 4) because it wasn't as thick as I like. I just cooked it a bit longer to thicken it up. The toasts were good, but a little heavy - don't know if I would make them again.

I fixed this recipe for the first time! It is simply delicious!!!!! I sent it to my friends and family. It was too large for me so I cut it in half and it still was wonderful.

Fantastic! Even without many of the ingredients this a really good recipe for split pea soup. I used leftover christmas ham instead of sausage for an easy rainy day lunch. Next time I want to try the Gouda Toast, it sounds great!

Very good recipe! I think I may try it with andouille sausage next time, though.

Very easy and even my kielbasa hating husband liked the soup and the toasts. I did use light kielbasa made with turkey, beef, and pork so the soup was milder. I also had a problem with the gouda not melting completely in the soup; it was still good though!

This was delicious! My whole family loved it. You cannot skip on the Gouda toasts-my family agreed they were the best part. If you don't like very strong mustard, and are worried about the German mustards being too strong, at least put on a little. I used a very strong mustard in small amounts, and it was more sweet than overpowering and gave the toasts a great taste.

Excellent recipe!! My whole family 2yr, 6yr and 11 yo old loves it so it will always be made in my home. The toast is a must have as well.

This is a wonderful soup. I used Aidells Chicken-Apple Sausage and skipped the gouda toasts.

Everyone has raved about this recipe and I'd like to echo that. This is an insanely easy recipe which also makes me glad not to be a vegetarian anymore. The kielbasa adds such rich flavor that is hard to attain in a vegetarian split pea soup recipe (although toasted sesame oil has done well in that context). I will make this again for those "no time to cook" evenings, but I will purchase a higher quality real Dutch gouda instead of an American brand I got at Ralph's, which didn't really melt... otherwise, excellent and super simple!

I've made this several times and love this recipe for the simplicity yet wonderful result. I now omit the gouda toasts, too.

Soup was simple to make but still had a deep rich taste. I found I did not need the gouda toasts.too much for me! ..Toasted plain sourdough bread works fine perhaps with a touch of gouda...

This is as good as split peas get! I made a double batch and froze it in freezer bags with the sausages whole. The first time we tried the soup I had some extra hot links so I cooked them on a griddle and made them on the toasts with the cheese. The second time we ate it I didn't even bother with the cheese toasts. We simply ate the soup with toasted sourdough. I guess I'll be chucking our old standby "favorite" split pea soup recipe!

This was wonderful and easy. I made it, up to the addition of the gouda,the day before and reheated when I needed it, adding less gouda in the soup. I toasted the bread and just put the cheese on top without the sausage and mustard, and floated it on top of each serving like a crouton. My family loved it.

I love this soup for myself and for parties. It has never let me down. I have made it with all different types of sausage but I still like the original the best. Delicious.

This recipe got rave reviews from our gourmet club, and even from our six year old daughter who had the leftovers the next day. I'm looking forward to making it again.

Gouda cheese? Cloves? I made this following the recipie exactly (except I sauteed the onions, celery and garlic in a smidgen of olive oil first). It was fantastic. My wife thought my own split pea soup was the best ever..until she tasted this one. Thanks.

I've made this soup twice and everything everyone has said in their raves is true --it went over very well at a dinner with friends and is now a firm favorite with my husband and me. I sauteed the onions first and even tried the soup with smoked gouda once (very good!) I also use spicy chorizo sausage for extra kick.

Awsome! Awsome! Awsome! The only thing I changed was the sausage. I used moose sausage, unsmoked. I made this for my Anniversary dinner and my whole family loved it, including my 4yr old and 9yr old.

I made this soup when it was first published in 1991, while living in San Diego, and it fast became a family favorite. So rich and wonderful, it will be the perfect meal tonight while waiting for snow here in Pennsylvania.
