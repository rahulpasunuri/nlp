I used a mixture of fish: Bass, Pickeral and Crappy (Waleye for my neighbours in the south). It was fresh that my partner caught and frozen for a few months. I don't have a food processor so I cut everything as small as possible. I added half a jalepeno because I like some bite. I didn't have parsley but did add a bit of fresh chives. It turned out great and I served it with tartar sauce. My stepson who will not eat fish even liked it. I suppose because it was fried! I will use this as a camping recipe. It is great for the mini fish the kids catch!

This is excellent, at least the way I did it. Listening to the other reviewers who said it was bland, I made a fine mince of onion, a mild Fresno red pepper and celery, which I sweated until soft in olive. I did the bread crumbs and cod in the food processor, then stirred in the onion mixture, added parsley, egg, cayenne pepper and enough breadcrumbs so it would bind together. I dredged the patties in a LOT of breadcrumbs and let them sit in the fridge for two hours to firm up. Fried in peanut oil. They browned beautifully. Served with tartar sauce made with Hellman's mayo, a minced cornichon, capers, parsley and a squirt of lemon juice. Really good. If you pre- saute or sweat the veggies, it makes everything more tasty.

I thought it was good as a lighter alternative - I can see why people would say bland but I added shallots, 1tsp cayenne cayenne and 2 tsps hot curry powder which gave it a good zing. I also added another egg and more breadcrumbs, seasoned with oil and herbs, than called for which made it al stay together better.

I made this recipe and found it was very very bland. The main flavors in the cod cakes were the celery and parsley.

Made these using breadcrumbs made from rosemary ciabatta (all I had) - turned out very nicely and quite flavorful. Have made them before with regular breadcrumbs and enjoyed those too

While this is a good take on a traditional recipe - I liked the fact that the cakes didn't include potato, the flavour was bland.

While this is probably a traditional recipe for cod cakes, I found it bland.

They were good but not an everyweek good. Maybe I would make them once in a while. I seasoned my bread crumbs they turned out wih great flavor. I didn't use cod due to allergies but I used some other fish I found at the supermarket. I don't remember what but if you don't like cod other fishes do work.

I've made this recipe many times and along the way tweaked it a bit so that it's perfect for us. (1) substituted chopped onion for the scallions; (2) used a full cup of fresh crumbs, not a scant cup, for the fish cakes; (3) made them early in the day or several hours before frying; (4) cooked them all at once in a 12-inch skillet until really browned on both sides and (5) served them with a good tarter sauce. If you're near a Wegmans, try their brand. We love these.

Sorry, but this was bland, it had absolutely no taste whatsoever.

Mmmm! So good! I didn't have parsley on hand so I substituted it with some dill (about 2 tablespoons of fresh dill) and it turned out great!

These cakes have a nice fresh flavor, but I agree with other cooks that they are kind of bland. I served them with a yogurt, capers, and horseradish sauce. As recommended, I added 1 tsp. Old Bay, which could have even been 1 1/2 tsp next time. I also added 1/2 a green pepper and 1 clove of garlic, and even with these additions, I still wished they had a little extra something. I think using seasoned breadcrumbs would definitely be an improvement, and will do that next time. Also, be sure to refrigerate for at least 15 minutes, as mine were falling apart in the pan, and i think it's best to flatten them out once they're in the pan. Overall, though, a nice alternative to richer fish cakes and a nice change for a weeknight meal.

I was very impressed by these codfish cakes. They were delicious and crisp. I followed the recipe exactly except that I added a tiny bit more salt and about 1/4 teaspoon of Old Bay Seasonings. I didn't want the seasonings to overpower the fish and bread. I sauteed them in a preheated Look Saute pan over medium heat until golden brown and crisp on each side then served with a small amount of tartar sauce. My cod was frozen and not completely thawed when I cut it into chunks and briefly processed in the food processer. I made a little extra bread crumbs for breading because of the moisture in the fish mixture. They turned out very light, and crisp. We are certainly looking forward to making this recipe again.

I've made this twice now. The first time as written and it was a little bland as others have commented. This time I added some fennel because I had it on hand, some garlic because I like garlic, some anchovies and some Old Bay. A little too much Old Bay this time so I'll try a tsp next time. The cakes were perked up from these additions. I think this recipe has possibilities with some more tinkering.

I liked the fresh, light taste, but I found these to be a little bland. Next time I'll use seasoned breadcrumbs instead of making my own, and add some dry mustard and maybe paprika to the fish mixture. I subsituted half a green bell pepper for the celery, which kept the crunchiness but (I think) gave it a little more flavor.

Sort of a home-made "fish stick". Cocktail sauce is really good with these. (Gives them a little kick)

Really good. Very mild. Even my non-fish-eating daughter liked them.
