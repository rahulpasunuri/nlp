This marinade was just ok - it didn't do much to enhance top sirloin that we had (and they were omaha steaks.) Probably would try something different next time.

Guys you really should settle down with this "I'm scared of marinating raw meat at room temp". We all survived the 60s and 70s where people ate their hamburgers rare (which, by the way is the best). This is NOT hamburger so lighten up. If you guys eat at fast food restaurants then you need to get off the snob and on the grill (which, unless the meat is off, is going to kill the bacteria). Do some research. Live a little.

I'm embarrassed to admit, but this is the first London Broil I've tried. We're more the "slap that Porterhouse on the bbq" types. This was very good altho I dislike to broil anything but bbq was out of propane. Will make again.

Very good. made this for dinner tonight. I marinated it for two hours at room temp. and followed the recipe exactly. I agree that you should def puree everything, and wait the 15 mins and cut on a diagonal. I had to cook mine a bit longer as my meat was a bit thicker, but still a great recipie. I would def. make again.

I didn't think this was anything great. Not really tasty. My family did not eat much which is a statement that it was just ok.

Great marinade! The london broil could use longer marinade... overnight would make it tender.

I had some London broil in the freezer for quite a while and on a rainy day decided to cook it up ...come what may. It turned our just great.

It's easy to make and always comes out delicious. I've used it with various types of steak and they all have tasted great.

Pretty good, would be better if I had more marinade to serve alongside meat. I accidentally overcooked it to well-done, but the top loin I used forgave me that error and was tender. After I turned it over the 1st time, I added some sliced onions on the cookie sheet (meat was on broiler rack on sheet) and it cooked just fine. Served with steamed veggies and roasted potatoes (okinawan, red, yukon tossed w/ olive oil & kosher salt). Sprinkled kosher salt over meat slices before serving.

Any meat flavor was overwhelmed by the marinade. It might be ok in a sandwhich, but too tart for a main course. Perhaps a much shorter marinade time (30 min) might work.

One of my favorite marinades- I usually use flank steak when I make this recipe.

This is really easy and a great dinner to serve to kids. I use a london broil.

I was looking for a fresh and different marinade for london broil, as I always tended toward red wine or balsamic vinegar based marinades. The combination of lemon, garlic, Dijon rosemary, etc. is extraordinary and allows for lighter, fresher side dish alternatives. This also enables an easy pairing with white wines, which can be tricky with red meats.

Time is always at a premium these days, but I would hesitate to leave raw meat at room temp for 2 hours, even with the acidity of the lemon....

Wonderful...getting ready to use the same marinade for steaks tomorrow. Would have never thought to use lemon with beef but it adds a fab taste!

Comment to those who found their London Broil to be tough. Try slicing it on an angle rather than straight up and down. The texture will be completely different.

I wanted to make the sirloin that the recipe called for, but ended up making it with london broil instead. It actually turned out just fine...a little tougher than I like my beef, but very tasty. I'll have to look harder for a sirloin the next time around.

Made this last night for a quick sunday night dinner - the marinade was great and definitely broke down any toughness in the london broil with only 2 hrs of marinading outside the fridge. I would't omit the lemon peel, that gives it the extra kick and definitely run everything through the processor. Also always use fresh lemon juice - you wouldn't think you'd need to stress that but then I saw my partner trying to replace with bottled lemon juice in another recipe, so it's best to spell it out...

I made this using an actual London Broil and it came out wonderful. Very tasty!! Definitely puree the garlic and other ingredients! The key to this cut of meat is to cook it about medium to medium rare. Anything beyond that and it will be too tough.

Very simple. No hassles!

Husband and I thought this was great. Pretty easy to make, and delicious!

When I make this recipe, I use it as a marinade for turkey london broil and it's excellent. Turkey london broil isn't as tough as beef, so I usually marinate it for an hour or so. Instead of salt, try a little bit of Emeril's Essence for added flavor.

Hhmm...the marinade was good, but I think I have a problem with "tough" cuts of meat. Every time I try to make a pot roast or something, it always comes out on the chewy side.

Excellent!!! This one makes my top 10 list of epicurious recipes. I believe that the pureeing is key.

Very easy, with a terrific flavor. Great to do early in the day, and let sit marinating while you do other things. I served it at a dinner party with a salad of baby greens with balsamic vinagrette, and a brown/wild rice medley. It was a big hit!

This is delicious! My wife loves it. My friend still raves about when I mde it for sandwiches to take to a Yankee game! But, you must ALWAYS use good quality meat.

I wanted to rate this recipe bc the reviews I read were negative about the marinade. I found the marinade tasty. Admittedly, I love lemon. But the lemon wasn't overpowering- the flavor of the garlic, mustard, and rosemary came through as well.

Thought this contained too much dijon and the lemon peel was weird. I guess I've realized I'm not a terribly big fan of beef marinated in lemon juice. Too bad. I guess if I made it again...well, actually, I just wouldn't.

We really enjoyed the flavors of the marinade. I can't wait to try using it with chicken. It was tangy and garlicky and just right (I omitted the oil and the lemon peel.)

As a newlywed, this site has been quite helpful in keeping my husband from starvation :) I was a bit disappointed in this recipe, though -- perhaps because I was searching for a London broil recipe (which I already had on-hand) and though the title said London broil, the recipe called for sirloin (which I didn't). It was dinner time so I made it anyway, since I had all the ingredients. Not the best move -- I should've stopped to read the second page of reviews about making sure to marinate overnight and doubts about a lesser cut of meat. The doubts were founded -- it turned out a little dry and kind of sour. My husband didn't complain, but I'm scrambling for ideas on how to possibly salvage the leftovers.

We made this marinade for a turkey london broil. We let it marinate overnight and then grilled it. It was very flavorful and the meat was really moist. Nice recipe.

I like foods with alot of flavor and I thought this recipe filled the bill. I marinated it in refrig while at work and broiled it with the marinade. I got a thumbs up from the family so this will be a repeat.

My boyfriend is a little fussy about his beef...likes it kept simple. I made this and he loved it! The only thing to be careful with is the rosemary...the flavor expands if kept together with the other ingredients too long. (A chef told me that) If you do not want Rosemary Steaks, better follow the recipe exactly.

Delicious. A perfect blend of ingredients. I do love lemon, rosemary, and garlic.

Decent, but not very flavorful and I let it soak in the marinade for 8 hours. I think the marinade would compliment salmon well either as a marinade or as a sauce.

This tasted good, but I've had better. My family loved it though. Because you use sirloin, this meat is tender, but I wonder if it would be as good with a lesser grade of meat.
