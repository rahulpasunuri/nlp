One word&garlic!! Adding lemon as suggested by several reviewers is great but add some fresh garlic. IMHO you can never go wrong with garlic

Bland. I added the lemon zest and a squeeze of lemon like other reviewers suggested but it was just really missing something. I really feel it should have some fresh herbs, like maybe fresh tarragon and/or basil (if lemon zest is used) added at the very end.

Just made this and took some of the suggestions of other reviews by using the canned artichoke hearts as well as some lemon zest. With the artichokes I added some leftover portobella mushrooms chopped, and then about halfway through the final broth incorporation, I also added fresh chopped basil leaves. Delicious! I plan to use the leftover to make arancini tomorrow!

Made this for dinner tonight and it was so delicious! It was my first crack at a risotto and I was pleased with myself. Definitely worth the effort. I will now use this as a base to play around with other ingredients!

This is a great recipe, but let me comment on the use of lemon zest...A little goes a long way. Used the zest of almost a 1/2 lemon...too much, half that amt.is sufficient. I used canned & quartered artichokes and added them after the first bit of warmed broth. This recipe takes far more time than 20 mins. to get the risotto creamy and tender. I also added (at the end)fresh chopped parsley and I threw in a can of drained of mushrooms. The mushrooms didn't add that much to it, but the parsley and cheese made it delicious.

Thought maybe it needed salt after all ingredients in, so I added 1) a little more salt and 2) the lemon that others on here hve recommended. After this, AMAZING! However, one person was right--it gets sticky right away. This is my first time making risotto, so I'm not sure if all risotto gets this consistency after finished. Regardless of the stickyness--it still tasted great.

Delicious! I should have trimmed the artichokes a bit more, and possibly even quartered or sliced instead of halved, which I'll do next time I make this. I added some lemon zest and tons of fresh parsley at the end for a very excellent meal.

followed the recipe and it was absolutely delicious. To make this a 4 fork review, I would have liked a little lemon zest for a bit more of a "pow." Ymmmm...

Excellent recipe! We've made this several times now and it never get's old. I did add a little squeeze of lemon as a previous review suggested and it was very nice.

After trying it with frozen artichoke hearts, I stopped using fresh artichokes, as it saves a lot of time and flavour is the same! I begin with partially unfrozen artichoke hearts, that can be easily sliced thin, put them into the pressure cooker with warm butter, salt and pepper and cook them stirring often for approx 8 min; then I add a glass of white wine and let it evaporate. Then I add the rice, the chicken broth, close the pressure cooker, and measure 8 minutes from the whistle. I open the pressure cooker, stir well, add the grated Parmesan and, if required, some more butter. Delicious !!!

I love artichokes. I used frozen ones and it turned out delicious. It was a great side for my salmon.

A nice side with a less elaborate main dish. I used thawed frozen artichokes from Wegmans; I might try roasting the artichokes first and adding just before the cheese for a contrast in texture.

Great base to play with. The best version I've made, I sauteed spring peas and roughly chopped cremini mushrooms until mushrooms are slightly soft and brown. I followed the rest of the directions as written, using 1.5 cups of white wine and 4 cups chicken broth, then used Manchego cheese instead of parmesan, salt and pepper. A little pan-fried prosciutto thrown in with the cheese is great, too.

I halved all of the recipe except for the parmesan, and it was great. A perfect New Years Eve dinner!

I just used canned artichokes from Trader Joes and doubled the Parm - Awesome!

I added the juice of half a lemon at the end and it gave it a nice tang. I trimmed the baby artichokes well, so they were very tender. Excellent use of baby artichokes.

This was fantastic, I followed the recipe with the exception of the anchovies. I substituted with Capers (same amount as Parmesan). I also added shrimp during the saute (at about half through saute time for artichoke). I was thrilled with the results and will deffinetly make this again.

I thought this was a fantastic dish, that I plan to make often. Works well with canned, water-packed artichokes, too. I'll never understand people who alter these recipes until they are unrecognizable and then give them a poor rating. Give yourself one star, not the recipe. Risotto without chicken broth? What?!

This risotto was nice altho I didn't use any chicken broth, olive oil instead of butter, no wine and Dutch cheese instead of parmigiana. The problem was w/ the artichokes because I never know how to clean them properly and I ended up with hard leaves in the rissoto... Other than that, fine like any other risotto really...

A nice spring dish. Needs only about 4 cups of broth, and I'd say it serves 4-5 as a starter. I used 10 baby artichokes, and felt like that was a good quantity for the amount of rice.
