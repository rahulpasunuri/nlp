Even without mustard seeds (I could've sworn I had some in my pantry!) it was delicious.

My boyfriend and I made this salad together to bring to a dinner party for 12. He was concerned about the portion size, but when we opened the bunches of watercress we realized we had plenty. He was also concerned about the amount of dressing, but I stuck to the recipe. The vinaigrette is very light, but it worked. The dried cranberries are the superstars of this dish.

Question: What kind of mustard seeds?

Suggestion: soak the mustard seeds if you have time. Ooh, then they burst and crunch nicely in yr mouth. Soakem in the vinegar for 3 or 4 hours.
