I made this last night and my husband couldn't stop saying how delicious it was. I had some preserved lemons so I used some of those chopped, in addition to the oranges (reducing the oranges by half). It gave a nice sweet & sour kick. I served it over Israeli couscous with toasted pine nuts, a little of the preserved lemons and a healthy dose of the fennel salt. Love the roasted fennel- don't skip that!

This was fabulous!!! Big hit in my house! I used bronzino, which my fishmonger said is very much like barramundi. I will make this for my next dinner party since it was quite impressive. I can't imagine no one making this again unless the price is an issue.

I found this VERY tasty. We made it with Tilapia, and I didn't have wine, so I added a little Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, and about a table spoon of butter. I cut out a little orange rind, because I don't really like it. Honestly, I often find fish a task to eat. This was nicely infused with the fennel, and citrus. It was a big hit with my husband and daughter.

I found this bland, disappointing and...pale. The fennel added a nice crunchy texture, but wasn't enough to save the dish. Lots of better recipes out there for roast fish.

Whole Foods was out of Barramundi so i used Talapia. Turned out perfect - held the fish in the warm oven while i made the sauce - served with cous-cous.
