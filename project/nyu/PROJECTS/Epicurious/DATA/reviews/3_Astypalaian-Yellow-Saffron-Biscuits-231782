These were delicious, especially served with a meaty soup! The allspice is, somehow, not overpowering, and combines with the pepper to create a pleasant tingle. The only thing that seemed a bit odd when I've made these (and I've made them twice now) is that they don't come out biscuit-like at all. Instead, if I follow the recipe, I end up with huge dinner-roll type buns. Fortunately, I don't mind that at all!

I haven't tried this yet, but doubt 1 teaspoon of alspice in 8 cups of flour would be anything but subtle. I'm going to give it a try this easter!

I have a question. Isn't the amount of allspice not too much? I would like to try it out, but am afraid of the allspice what can be overpowering every spice you use?
