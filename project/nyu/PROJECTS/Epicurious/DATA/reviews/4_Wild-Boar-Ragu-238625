Not only was this delicious, but I happen to be an old-school Violent Femmes fan. My take on the recipe... Had 2 1/2 pounds boar. Hard for me to stew anything without a little celery and carrot in with the onion - I finely chopped up one stalk celery and one carrot to add to the pot. After sauteeing the veggies, I dumped them in a bowl and browned the boar without them. I did it in several batches to make sure it browned, not stewed. I used 2-14 oz cans of whole plum tomatoes that I cut up. Wasn't sure if I would add the liquid or not, but ended up using it. I stuck the cinnamon stick, cloves, and bay leaves in cheesecloth and grabbed them out about half way through the cooking (once I could smell them in the sauce). I just used a sprinkle of crushed red pepper. More than that and it would have actually been hot, not seasoned. I probably used about 2/3 of a bottle of wine throughout the cooking process. The weirdest part is that I had to cook it for about 6 hours! But it was worth it. I hand shredded the meat, left it in the fridge for 2 days and served it on papparadelle with pecorino romano. Insanely good. Have been enjoying leftovers and looking forward to making it again.

I made this recipe with a 3 lb. wild boar roast purchased at the farmers market. I added a bit more of some ingredients to compensate for the extra meat, and used the 28 oz can of tomatoes. The only variation was to add carrots and a heaping tsp of brown sugar towards the end of cooking as it was a bit tart. I cooked it for about 4 hours as the roast was partially frozen. It was absolutely delicious--rich and flavorful. I served it on polenta, which my husband had doubts about but raved about in the end. There were hardly any leftovers!

What an amazing taste. A friend of mine gave me fresh boar sausage and I took it out of the casing and used it in stead of the meat. Don't change a thing and just pour it over pasta or potatos or...whatever!

This was fabulous, I will definitely make it again many more times. I doubled this recipe for a 12 person dinner the other night. Some caveats: next time I will leave the entire afternoon to reduce. I only allocated 2 hours, which turned out well in terms of consistency but the meat was not falling off at this point. The chili peppers are very spicy. In retrospect I wish I'd started with half the advised amount and tested / added as desired. Last, I kind of freaked out when I originally poured in all of the wine and tomatoes (incl juices), it def appeared very soupy, but it worked out well and reduced perfectly, just be sure to leave yourself some wiggle room. With practice I think this recipe will be very easy and become a staple!

I've been using Epi for years and years to help me cook delicious dishes. This one is THE WORST recipe I've ever tried. I can usually "eye-ball" the ingredients and suss-out the changes that could/should be made based on the comments. But this one failed all around. First of all, this not a "ragu". It's a Moroccan-based meat dish and it tastes totally weird with pasta. I had leftovers so, (because of all the expensive meat in there, instead of throwing it out) I turned it into an INDIAN CURRY. (Yes, curries use cinnamon and cloves. I sauteed some other common Indian spices and added them to the leftovers.) What a disappointment! Blech!

Delicious and the smell of it cooking was incredible. I made the recipe pretty much as written with about 1.5lb wild boar. It didn't brown with the onions in the pot because of all their moisture, but the taste was still great. Rather than simmer on the stovetop, I put the cast iron pot in the oven, covered for 2.5 hours. The consistency was very thick and it was delicious over pappardelle. I used parmigianno reggiano instead of peccorino romano because that's all I had. I would definitely make it again!

Excellent recipe. I added fennel and carrots to the onions, sauted them in bacon fat as well as olive oil, and to the wine added the liquid from the tomatoes and the soaking liquid from the sun-dried tomatoes. I omitted the basil and sage but added copious amounts of chopped parsley at the end and as a garnish. Delish!

I made this the first time with pork (because wild boar is so hard to find here) and it was delicious. I spent a small fortune to find a cut of wild boar and am making it again tonight with the real thing.

i worried that the cinnamon and clove was going to really affect the taste of this ragu, because it smelled so strongly of them, but it ended up being an incredibly delicious sauce -- the family raved! the only changes i made: no sun-dried tomatoes or anchovies (didnt have any!) and the butcher was short on wild boar meat so i did 1 pound of that and 2 pounds of beef short ribs. both had bones -- not a problem of course, just requires deboning at the end when you're shredding up the meat a bit for the sauce. we put it over pappardelle and it was fabulous!

My husband bow hunted a couple of wild boars a few weeks ago and we drove out to the Eastern Townships to pick up our meat cuts from the butcher's this weekend. Having tasted the meat in Italy years ago, I was very excited to sample it again. This recipe was a winner. I made it with minced instead of the stewing cubes the recipe called for, only because I was in the mood for a bolognese type sauce. I rolled the meat into tiny meatballs and then made sure to follow every recommended cooking step because, at my husband's insistance, and as a reminder to anyone who wants to cook wild boar,it needs to be well cooked. For health reasons, you shouldn't eat it rare. This recipe is ideal as it slow cooks for hours, filling the house with a divine aroma. My only other suggestion would be to stock up on enough crusty baguette if you run out of pasta because you'll want to wipe your plates clean, guaranteed.

I made this for about 10 people who all raved about the unique flavor of the boar and spices. Definitely a crowd pleaser!!

I'm in San Diego, and the only boar I could get was sausage, AND there are not many recipes for wild boar out there, so I gave it a go. Used 2 lbs. of sausage removed from casings, and cayenne instead of chili peppers, and simmered it for about 1 1/2 hours. it was thick, delicious, and still had a good gamey flavor. Highly recommend it, and its fun to use whatever herbs etc...happen to be in the cupboard as they all simmer well. Just don't skip the anchovy paste or garlic!

I followed this recipe with a pork roast and crock pot. I browned the meat and then threw everything into the crock pot. The sauce, because it was covered, turned out to be the perfect consistency; I did not need to add any extra liquid. My husband thought it was terrific. Using the crock pot made this so easy!

I tried this recipe after a trip to my local supermarket, which because it's Autumn was featuring young wild boar. Once I got the meat home, I was at a loss: roast it? braise it? stew? This was a delicious ragu, which I served over polenta. I, however, think that it would be equally delicious (and very much cheaper) if pork shoulder was substituted. Like many other reviewers, I ended up going thru a bottle of wine, in my case a really nice, but inexpensive Chianti. Because it simmered for the better part of one evening and for a few hours the following afternoon, additional liquid was necessary. Additionally, I used a smidge of cayenne pepper in lieu of the chili peppers. Worked fine, along with a good grating of black pepper at the end. While it was a wonderful meal, I think that next time I buy boar, I'm going to try a recipe that allows the meat's flavors to dominate. (Perhaps that roast....)

I absolutly loved this recipe. I used pork instead of boar, and I added a significant amount of wine.

I used pork shoulder instead of boar. I also added the herbs towards the end of cooking, to keep them from turning bitter. Added a little more red wine (shiraz) throughout. Save this for a cold, winter night. Delicious!

I took serious liberties with this recipe, in keeping with the spirit in which it was written. Gotta be adaptable, right? I substituted rosemary, thyme, and parsely for the oregano, basil, and sage called for; used a guajillo as my dried chili pepper (added a super smokey flavor); added almost a bottle of wine; and diced a bit of Spanish chorizo in toward the end of the cooking time, which was almost 6 hours. It was worth the wait, and totally fit the bill for a chilly, rainy Portland night!

Delicious. Awesome spices and flavors which stand up to the wild boar meat. I added sauteed mushrooms only because I had them ready. I would keep the lid on, I had to add more wine, and tomato juice to keep it from becoming too thick.
