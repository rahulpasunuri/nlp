excellent. puffy light and crisp. Cubed the potatoes rather than sliced. Parboil can be done in advance. Toss just before baking. Stirred them occasionally while baking.

Eliminated the garlic and lemon to serve with Corned Beef and Cabbage. Excellent!

I was serving this with Corned Beef and Cabbage, and did not want the garlic/ lemon taste, so eliminated that. Excellent. Also, I did not peel the Yukon Gold potatoes

This turned out great. We halved the recipe for a smaller dinner party. Also added carrots when we roasted the potatoes.

Everyone liked the potatoes, but I found them a little dry. It's possible that I overcooked them . . . I was out on the deck with my guests enjoying myself. I will try these again when I have time to stay in the kitchen!

Easy and tasty! I added chunks of carrots -- everything comes out moist and flavorful. Made it two times this week, and certainly will make again, especially in autumn.

Potatoes turned out absolutely great! My husband said that these are the best roasted potatoes he has ever had. They were delicious and moist, and moist is something that I was never before able to get from roasted potatoes. Great recipe!

The potatoes were a bit dry. Yes, this could be a "user error", but the overall flavor was not that impressive.
