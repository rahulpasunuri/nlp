Ugh! Had made this years ago and thought it turned out ok but not this time.I couldn't find a 16oz pound cake so I used 2 10oz cakes and made a 4 layer torte. Lime curd mixture was great before I added Cream cheese - then it was too cheesey/heavy. (I would use only 1 pkg of cream cheese) I used pre-sliced Del Monte SunFresh Mangos in a jar which were were rubbery and not ripe. The recipe makes too much Compote for Torte so I would cut in half. Some of my guests complained about the rum and tart combination. I think the recipe is just unremarkable!

I thought that the filling was a little on the 'heavy' side, so I lightened it a little with about a 1/2 c. of whipped cream. Loved the tart/sweet/rum flavor combination.A very refreshing end to a meal.

What a hit! People came back for seconds, I should of made two. I actually made the lime curd from the Ginger Lime Coconut Cake that is on this site, and then blended it with the cream cheese. It was tart, but great. The mangoes were fabulous, and I added extra rum, and loved ever bit of it. I had 2 guests who did not like this - one doesn't like lime, and other hates mangoes - go figure!

Ugh. I made this for the Fourth of July a year ago, and it was cold, dense, and WAY too rum-y (even though I cut down on the amount). Would definitely NOT recommend it.

I don't understand all the excellent reviews -- this was only so-so. I used Entemann's pound cake (which I love) but this recipe just didn't do it for us. However, the mango compote was very good! That's what most of the guests ate.

This is one of the simplest things I've ever made from Bon Appetit and quite good. It's tart, an unusual combination of flavors and very refreshing in the NC summer heat. My son was able to find prepared mangos, but I was not. That would make it even easier.

I made this for a luau for my husband's birthday. It was gone in a matter of minutes! I used key limes instead of regular ones--delicious! The mangoes fell apart when I tried to chop them so I threw it in the blender and made a sauce instead--it was better that way.

Excellent! a very refreshing desert. The recipe made TONS of mango compote so it could easily be reduced. We served this at a gourmet dinner group for 12 and everyone raved.

I made this for Easter as well. I made it Friday evening and we ate it mid-day on Sunday. It was perfect. I received rave reviews from everyone. Most people liked it for its tartness contrasted with a little sweetness and the rich taste of the rum. Also, it was great for me because it was so easy to make (especially ahead)!

I made two of these for Easter along with the Dulce de Leche ice cream cake from the April 2001 issue. Making them days ahead was great. I topped this recipe with a little whipped cream also. Both recipes had rave reviews from all 18 guests.

I made this recipe even simpler by buying already-made lemon curd (available in most supermarkets with the jams/jellies). Also, I did not want to make it so big so I bought a small pound cake (I think it was 10 or 12 oz) and used hald of the rum and cream cheese. For the curd, I used about 1 cup and a half's worth. We ate the cake about 2 hours after I made it and it was kind of so-so. The day after, it was wonderful. The mangoes were divine with this cake.
