Easy to make. Started the hens upside down for 15 minutes, then turned over for the remainder of the time, used only 10 cloves, added rosemary along with the wine and broth, very tasty. Definitely cook down the pot liquor for gravy, amazing.

These were pretty easy and delicious. My whole family loved this dish. The only change I made was using an immersion blender to puree the garlic into the sauce, which helped thicken it...and it tasted amazing. I overcooked my hens a little, but that was my fault. I had a hard time getting a good temperature reading on those little buggers.

I thought this was wonderful! I made just one hen & made adjustments accordingly. This is a Very quick & easy recipe to make. I used a convection oven & started it out at 425 & then went to 350. I used a meat thermometer & pulled it about 10 minutes earlier than the recipe specified. Not sure if it got done sooner because I cooked just one hen or if it was because of the convection oven. I'm glad I used the thermometer because it was perfectly cooked.

This was excellent and very easy to make. I found the cooking times to be accurate. Next time I would double the amount of sauce ingredients and use about 60 garlic cloves. Press the cloves with the flat of a a knife blade and tuck some on the hens for added flavour

Just did a trial run with 2 hens for a dinner party tomorrow of 10. Followed the recipe exactly. The breast meat turned out bland, so I'm going to add some herbed butter under the skin tomorrow. Also, mine were done (170 degrees) in about 35 minutes (25 minutes at 450, then 10 minutes at 350.) The sauce was DELICIOUS! I will double the amounts tomorrow since it's so yummy. Will also sprinkle some paprika on the skin for extra color since these did not brown well. Overall a delicious recipe.

This was very easy to make, and I loved the fact that it uses simple ingredients readily on hand in my pantry/kitchen. The only change I made from the original recipe was that I added a large garlic clove into the cavity of each bird, since there was room for it. I served it with steamed asparagus and herbed bread stuffing on the side...it worked well and suited every single one of my dinner guests' varied tastes. I did use very meaty cornish hens, so once the side dishes were added to the plate, just one half of each bird was plenty to feed an adult.

I LOVE this recipe!! I have made it numerous times and every time it's Fantastic! Each time I make it I get huge compliments all around and there are never any leftovers. I don't add the last tablespoon of oil either, not really necessary. I always have a good loaf of bread with it beacause I will not let any of that exceptional sauce go to waste! I also don't cut up the cornish game hens, just easier that way. Highly recommended- Easy and Very Delicious!!

My husband, who tends to be fussy, really liked this one. I made a few minor changes - stuffed the cavity with some thyme sprigs as well as some of the cloves of garlic. (I used the rosemary also.) In addition, I used sea salt instead of regular, and I didn't add the rest of the oil when I added the broth/wine combination. It really wasn't necessary! One of the hens was larger than the other, and the larger one was tastier - the smaller was a bit dry, but the recipe is really very good!

I had the same issue as below reviewer regarding smoke situation in kitchen. I was thankful my fire alarm didn't go off, which would have been very embarrassing. 450 degrees is a very hot oven especially when the hens have oil on their skin initially and more added half way through. I gave my oven a much needed cleaning the next day to avoid future problems! Delicous recipe.

This was absolutely fantastic. I used only two birds, but otherwise basically followed the recipe. The birds browned very well, the skin was crispy and the flesh very moist and delicious. I also put a large clove of garlic inside each cavity. The rosemary did not overpower, but provided delicious aroma and flavor. My only problem was that the garlic in the pan got too scorched, so I left it out of the sauce when serving. Even though I used the amounts the recipe called for for 4 servings of sauce, there was only really enough sauce for 2 (perhaps my pan was too big and it evaporated). If making again, I would double the wine, chicken stock, and perhaps leave the oil the same. I used really good quality free roaming cornish hens, which cost a fortune but I think makes a huge difference in such a simple preparation. By the end of the meal, forks and knives had been abandoned in order to get all the remaining meat off the birds!

Rating: 3
I also stuffed rosemary, salt and garlic under the skin, and used only one tablespoon of olive oil which was plenty. The hens didn't brown well even though I cooked an extra 20 minutes so I turned on the broiler and browned both sides. The sauce was nice and dish was tasty; served with crusty potato rosemary bread, and a green salad. Good for company as you can prepare the little birds early and then just pop them in the oven.

Rating: 3
This is an easy recipe with nice, simple flavours. I had no trouble with the browning, though I basted more frequently than suggested. Came out with a golden-brown, very tender bird. In retrospect, I completely agree with the suggestion about omitting the extra oil- my only regret with this recipe is that I didn't follow this advice.

The sauce was wonderful (though a tad oily), birds were moist but not browned. The rosemary imparted much less flavor than expected, and the lemons were a bit bitter. The recipe is a keeper (easy and tasty), but I'd like to experiment with: * More garlic, broth, and wine * Adding garlic later to avoid burning * Less oil * No lemon * More basting * More rosemary (and perhaps other herbs)

Thank you Epicurious!!!! Made this dish for my first meeting with the boyfriend's parents. It went off without a hitch.

We love this recipe. I usually use a small frying chicken (cost) and cook for 1 1/2 hours at 350F and it comes out brown and crispy. I do find the quality of the chicken makes a huge deal - the regular chickens from the store are lousy, but premium grain fed is fabulous.

I remember this recipe when it appeared for the first time in Bon Appetit!. I have made it several times and always get great compliments. To my fellow Canadian from Ontario, to get really nice crispy skin, wash and dry the hens, then put on a platter and leave in the fridge 8 hours or overnight, uncovered, before putting in the oven. And to the Cook from Texas 1/27/03, not everyone in California is on such a culinary high horse. If Stove Top works for you, use it! We also enjoy Stove Top along with anything that floats your boat!

I made this last night for my family. Very easy and excellent! They loved it as did I. I followed the recipe except I used tyme and sage in addtion to the rosemary.

This recipe was pretty good although I wished my hens had browned more. I cooked them 35 minutes at 450 and 30 minutes at 350 but they just didn't brown well. The flavor was good, I used rosemary, thyme and a lime in the cavity.

Not particularly creative, but DEEEEEEELISH! The sauce was amazing, make extra of this, as you will want more for bread dipping. My birds were a bit smaller, about 1lb, so I reduced the cooking time to 22min and 20min for each stage. Don't forget to pour the pan juices from the rested hens back into the sauce.

This recipe is so easy and tastes like a gourmet masterpiece. I put two lemon wedges and a large sprig of Rosemary in the cavity of the hens. I also minced fresh garlic and slid it under the skin. A rice pilaf goes really well and soaks up the sauce deliciously.

Ok, I apologize up front but cook from Texas you went way overboard on this recipe. It is great just the way the recipe reads and served with a simple rice pilaf compliments the wonderful flavor of the hens. "Frying" it first is atrocious and accompanying it with such side dishes must be a "Texan thing". We in California enjoy the true flavors of the recipe.

Okay... I read EVERY review before preparing this dish so I made a few adjustments. Firstly, I stuffed fresh rosemary, tarragon, 1/4 lime (I had no lemons) and garlic (about 3-4 cloves per bird) underneath the skin of the hens. Secondly, before roasting the hens in the oven, I cooked them in olive oil on the stove on med-high heat for about 6 min to ensure browning and seal in the flavors. From there, I followed the reciped almost exactly as stated (I cooked it for the first 25 min at 475, then finished it for the last 25 min at 375.) The skin is beautifully browned and crispy, the meat is cooked through and falling off the bone. The garlic stuffed under the skin DEFINITELY imparts flavor to the meat. I am not an eater of skin normally, however, with this recipe has converted me. I do recommend basting every 10 min or so while roasting for added browning and crispiness. The sauce was very flavorful, especially if you deglaze the pan w/ wine or chicken broth and get all of those yummy bits at the bottom of the pan out. Pretty easy to make, it just requires a little prep time. I cooked the birds in the oven on top of small pre-cooked potatoes (since I don't have a roasting rack) and surrounded the birds w/ pre-cooked carrots, turnips and parsnips which I believe added a nice sweetness to the sauce. I served the birds w/ (sorry Betty, Martha and Julia) Stove Top chicken stuffing that I doctored up by adding sliced almonds, raisins and chopped waterchestnuts to. DELISH! (I hate people who say delish all the time, like Rachel Ray.) But really, delish! Chicken is falling off the bone, presentation is great, skin crispy and perfectly browned. You can't miss with this. It seems pretty fail-safe to me. And this was even my first time cooking cornish hens... and I have a knack for screwing up recipes. The house has smelled heavenly all afternoon to boot! Would be wonderful (and easy) for a dinner party w/ the right sides.

Just recently used this at a dinner party for 6. It was a huge success! I made a few changes such as brining the hens for 2 hours in a 2 cup kosher salt, 1 cup sugar, 5 qts water solution, which gave the meat more flavorful. Also used only 12 garlic cloves, doubled the sauce and added new potatoes to the hens while they roasted. Using larger hens calls for more time in the oven. This took at least 1 1/2 hours to roast. For dinner parties, timing is everything!

This was a delicious dish made with a minimal number of ingredients. I didn't have lemons, and so substiuted limes, the rosemary was fresh from my garden and very flavorful.

Like other cooks, I added the garlic at the halfway point and still had plenty of garlic flavor in the broth and the hens - it wasn't overpowering as I might have expected with so many cloves added. And also like other cooks, I had trouble with the hens not browning. I was preparing seven at once, so perhaps a crowded oven is to blame, but I never reduced the oven temp, cooked them for 15 minutes longer than recommended, put four of them on a baking sheet and back in the oven at 450 for 10 minutes, and they still were just barely browned and barely done.

Rating: 3
First, this was a delicious Christmas entree. Second, I found the cooking directions pretty screwed up. Even with my best roaster, at 450 the garlic started to scorch about half way through the initial cooking. Next time I will wait about 10 minutes, add the garlic, and then reduce the temperature to about 400 degrees. The hens also came out underdone, so I will increase total cooking time. I used a full can of chicken broth (forgive me Julia, but I didn't have time to make the real thing) and the resulting reduced sauce was delicious over rosemary and garlic mashed potatoes.

We only used the one Tblsp. olive oil for both birds, omitting the extra 2T. and still thought the pan gravy was greasy; would cut the olive oil to as little as possible next time. Overall, good flavor, and nice presentation. Paired well with some lemon-garlic potatoes.

I just made this recipe last night for a romantic valentine's dinner. We loved it! (Thank God we both did--as we still reek of Garlic). Like other reviewers, I made extra sauce so there was plenty to pour over the hens and potatoes. The supermarket only has frozen hens, but it didn't make the slightest difference--they were incredibly tender and moist. Just defrost for a couple of hours in luke warm water and you're set. This would definitely make a low stress dinner party recipe, as there aren't too many fiddly step.

After enjoying this several times as written, some blood oranges beckoned me at the market this weekend. What a delicious substitute for the lemon!

This is a good recipe, and the garlic gravy is delicious. I found that the lemon and rosemary left little to no effect on the final product, but it was still very good. The birds also cooked 15 or 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for.

The recipe was easy and lent itself well to entertaining. I got great compliments from my guests and enjoyed adding something new and different to my usual special -occasion fare.

I am requested to make this dish now for family & friends for most special occasions. We usually add a little more garlic to the roasting pan and more liquids for the gravy since we feel the original recipe doesn't make enough. Try this!!

This was wonderful and not really that tough. I also recommend using the garlic cloves hot from the oven on french bread along with it.

Great and easy dish. Took someone elses advise and eliminated the other additional basting with oil. Also thickened the sauce with a roux. Instead of crusty bread I served it with a risotto.

The roasted hens with the garlic make for a light , delicate blending of garlic flovors, tempered with just a little citrus. I serverd the hens, 1/2 each over wild rice and topped them with the sauce. My wife was very happy with the dinner. Needless to say when she's happy with the dinner I prepared for her, I'm happy.

I found this to be a great easy recipe. Made it for a dinner party and got rave reviews. I did alter recipe slightly based on previous reviews. To avoid a greasy sauce, omit the 2 tbsp oil and baste w/ just broth and wine. Try cream sherry, it adds nice taste and great color. Skim pan juices with a turkey baster and thicken slightly with a roux to make a nice gravy to pass with the hens.

My family loved this for Easter dinner. I didn't bother with the sauce though.

The aroma of the garlic was incredible, however I found the sauce a little too greasy, and not the flavor that I anticipated. My family did not enjoy it. I may make it again but without the sauce.

This was a beautiful dish, perfect for my valentines day meal. The finished sauce is what really makes it.
