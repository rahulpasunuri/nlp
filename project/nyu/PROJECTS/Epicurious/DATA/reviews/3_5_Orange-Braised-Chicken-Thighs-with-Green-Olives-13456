This is an excellent dish, and one of my favorite go-to recipes. I recommend doubling the sauce (cumin, OJ, lemon juice, olives), and letting it reduce a bit. I serve it with turmeric rice with raisins (a family recipe) and roasted cauliflower (recipe online here "roasted cauliflower with kalamata vinaigrette").

Relatively easy to make, and it doesn't take that long at all. Wonderful flavors - olives and oranges? Who knew... I did add the extra half cup of fresh OJ and a teaspoon and a half of cornstarch as another reviewer suggested. Genius, for those who like it a little bit thicker. I am definitely going to make it again.

Made this for lunch with white rice. my husband who is a picky eater thought it was very nice. I thought it was easy to make and quick..of course, it depends on how quickly one preps everything, but the cooking time for boneless skinless thighs was about 20-25 minutes. I did add more orange juice, and added a dash of chicken broth and white wine and another 1/2 teaspoon of cumin since I love the taste. Delicious!

Exceptional for a quick recipe. I suggest deglazing the pan after the onions and garlic with a bit of dry white wine or chicken broth. It will make the sauce a bit richer. Also, I suggest adding a 1/4t of orange zest.

the chicken itself was delicious but the sauce was not edible. we will not be keeping this recipe.

Made this as is except that I doubled everything to feed 3 people with leftovers. All of us loved it & I'll definately be making this again. Such nice, rich flavor.

I was really surprised at how easy and delicious this recipe was. I would recommend doubling the sauce because it was so good I was scrapping the pan for more! I wouldn't change a thing - truly a tasty, unique dish that was sweet and succulent.

Made this dish for dinner this evening. It was easy and quick and turned out very nicely. I deglazed with some dry vermouth and used Kalamata olives that I sliced into smaller pieces in place of the whole small green olives. I think the substitution worked well.

Made this tonight...followed recipe pretty much as written. Added a little Marsala to deglaze the pan and reduced juice to sauce consistency. Thought it made a delicious week-night dinner. Quick and easy...well worth the minimal effort.

Maybe I'm just a breast guy, but these thighs were fatty and rubbery. The sauce had nice flavor, and I'll try combining orange and green olive again soon. But it will be a long time before I buy chicken thighs again.

I was a little intrigued by the combination of OJ and olives. I like both so I thought I'd give this a try. Wow! What a great flavor contrast! They play off each other perfectly. I also doubled the OJ and used a little cornstarch to thicken. This is a new favorite!

I enjoyed the first few bites of this, and liked how the chicken turned out. But after a while I decided that I wasn't that big of a fan of this sauce, and so would not make it again.

This was delicious! I followed ingredients exactly - but cut olives in half. And, after browning, I removed the soft loose skin. I will be making this again, and for company. My husband said it was "awesome". I agree!

This recipe is delicious. Like others have suggested, I increased the OJ and thickened it with cornstarch. Even my 4-year-old loves this recipe - he asks me to add extra olives! Fantastic recipe.

Tasty stuff! I found the sauce reduced nicely and didn't need any thicking. More than enough for 2. Glad to say my 16yr. old liked it too.

I had all the ingredients on hand so I made this last night. My husband loved it....I thought it was good but nothing special. I followed the recipe pretty exactly except I doubled the amount of orange juice like other reviewers suggested. The amount of sauce resulting was perfect. I also made the yellow rice with sofrito and that was a very good accompaniment to this dish. The sauce in particular went very well with the rice.

This is a keeper - easy and even the kids liked it! As some other reviewers suggested I increased the orange juice and added a little chicken broth as well and thickened the sauce at the end w/ a little corn starch - good flavors and good with jasmine rice and broccoli.

Oh, how I love to deviate from recipes!! I had only a few ingredients but went for it anyway with what I had in the pantry. No oj in the house so I used chicken broth,orange marmalade, lemon juice and a squeeze of lime. Also used garlic-stuffed green olives. Extremely YUMMY ! I'd like to try the real ingredients some time. Would definitely recommend this dish.

Try omitting the olives and adding a tbsp soy sauce. then caramalize some onions and spoon sauce over. MMM tasty.

This was a great and fairly easy dish. We set a few pieces aside before adding the onions and olives for 2 small children. They loved both types of chicken. We also served with our own variation of the Sofrito Rice. I would definately make this again!!!

Reading the ingredients for this recipe made me hesitant to try this one--I kinda thought the oj and olive combo sounded awful; the reviews were so enthusiastic I figured I'd give it a shot--can always order pizza if it stinks, ya know? Everyone loved it, even my 18 month old! I doubled the oj as suggested, would definately suggest that, but followed the recipe otherwise.

Best chicken I have ever made, hands down!! So delicious and perfectly tender, without needing to marinate!! I can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow. Perfect mix of sweet and sour flavors. The orange flavor is a fresh spin on chicken recipes that are usually salty. I tried to stay close to the recipe except that I doubled the OJ like others suggested and used skinless chicken breasts. You really don't need much oil for this, just enough not to burn the ingredients (use as little as possible if you are calorie conscious!) Can't wait to make it for my friends next time!

I have made this dish several times. It is always delicious. The secret is to use very good green olives. The piccoline olives are the best I have found for this dish. (you can sometimes find them at Trader Joes. The regular green olives found in supermarkets are much too harsh for this dish, in my opinion, and will ruin the dish.

Rating: 3
Wow, this was tasty, easy & inexpensive. Soaked the chicken in the fresh OJ, and added 1/2 teaspoon of New Mexico chili powder. Other than that, stuck to the recipe. Served with aromatic rice. The green olives really do set it off.

Made this last night. Not going to make it again. Strange flavors, together. It was edible, but my husband turned his nose up to it as well. Threw out leftovers.

This was so yummy! The ingredients sound strange, but it yields the most flavorful dish especially with the yellow rice. I followed the recipe exactly as is, which is rare for me. I don't believe any enhances need to be made. It is a must for anyone looking at this recipe.

Made this receipe last night for my husband and a friend and they both pronounced it as "Yummy"! The only modification I made was doubling it and I paired it with GINGER BASMATI PILAF WITH CUMIN AND SCALLIONS which was "Yummy" as well!

This was great. You've got to try it. It sounds as if it would be a strange combo of ingredients, they all work out great together. Only changes for me...skinless thights and I made more of the sauce and added more olives (I sliced the olives). I served it with the yellow rice recommendation and it was perfect. I had planned to have leftovers but we ate it all the same night. Yum!!

We love this dish. A few modifications based on previous reviewed great suggestions: We used curry instead of cumin and big jalepeno-stuff green olives, halved. We also used about double the oj and then cooked the heck out of the thighs, from which we removed the skin before browning. YUMMY and spicy with those peppers and hot curry!

This is a delicious recipe, and so easy! It is now one of my regular dishes when I'm in a hurry. I serve it with couscous, and use more orange juice so I have more sauce.

Rating: 4
Delicious. One of our favorite recipes. A couple changes to improve flavor: Remove skin from chicken and coat with flour, pepper, and paprika. Brown in oil and butter for 12 min. per side. You'll get nicely browned, flavored bits to scrape up when you add the garlic and onions. Also, increase o.j. to two cups so you have sauce to pour over rice.

DELICIOUS! I was looking for a new way to cook chicken thighs and this was a winner! My husband loves olives so it was a no brainer for him. I slow cooked the chicken for about an hour and a half and it fell off the bone. Very tasty!

I made a variation of this using curry powder instead of cumin and it was excellent! Also I increased both the orange and lemon juices to be sure there was sufficient liquid for the braising (double the amount in the recipe is good). Also used a mix of green and black olives. Try it!

I didn't have any green olives handy so I made it with out it and added sliced white mushrooms instead. Served it over white rice, it was fabulous!

I made this last night and it was a big hit. I had 12 thighs and I fried them in two batches. I have made similar recipes and found that if I fry the chicken almost done then the sauce will not cook away as the simmer time is not as long. I did increas the orange juice to 1 cup and added more olives.

I omitted the green olives as it sounded just to strange to go with orange juice and I used vegetable oil as I was out of olive oil. We loved it. I poured the sauce over white rice which made a very mellow tasting accompaniment.

We liked it,but it wasn't particularly memorable. There wasn't any sauce left at the end of the cooking time. The chicken was very tender and juicy, however. Next time, I will deglaze the pan, and add some wine and water to the juices.

Made this in the crock pot and it turned out great. So easy too. I used boneless, skinnless thighs but breasts would work. Doubled the recipe but eliminated the oil. Layered onions, garlic and olives, topped with the chicken and poured the juice and spice over. Cooked on low for about 7 hours. Great addition to the weeknight routine.

I made this dish for dinner last night after reading the "rave" reviews. I admit I was a bit skeptical about the green olives and orange juice together but it was fantastic. I did deglaze the pan with white wine after browning the chicken re one reviewers suggestion. I doubled the sauce recipe and used 1/2 cup of olives. I also placed it under the broiler for a few minutes before serving to crisp up the skin.

I was not as excited as most were with this recipe. Although the flavors work ok together, they end up being quite mild. The only exception I made was using boneless, skinless thighs and I doubled the recipe. Nice and easy though.

I've done this recipe twice and family and guests have raved about it and asked for the recipe. To the yellow sofrito rice I added saffron, but I made the mistake of finishing chicken and rice together in a tagine and the rice became (for my taste) too damp. Next time I will ensure that the rice is dry, like a biriyani. I will add toasted pine-nuts, almonds or pistachios to the rice.

WOW!! Who would have thought orange juice and olives would be this great together. I followed the recipe exactly except I deglazed the pan with a little white wine after I browned the chicken. Definitely use the green olives (not black like a previous reviewer did). The olives make the dish. I found 25 minutes to be plenty of time for the cooking. Next time I will double the sauce and serve over rice. My husband's body is a temple so I removed the skin from the thighs before serving. He also thought it was really great. Don't miss this one. It was easy, easy, easy, quick, quick quick and good, good, good.

I followed it exactly, except for adjusting to six chicken thighs. The "25 minutes" of simmering is not nearly enough. Took about 40 - 45 before they were done through. I served it with "Gratin of Potato" from Epicurious (House & Garden May 1964). That was great too.

Excellent dish (with some modifications). Doubled the orange juice and used fresh ground cumin seeds (2 tablespoons). Also used large pitted black olives cut in half instead of green (really you don't need the olives, it is great without them but they are good non the less). Simmered it a little longer at very low heat due to tardy guests and the sauce reduced wonderfully. Great with the suggested side dish.

I had to give this two forks because it was so STRANGE! I could not tell if I liked it or not - one bite was good and the next was not! I think that I'll make this again but leave out the olives (or maybe use black olives?) I guess that I'll sum this up by saying that blending these flavors made for a very, um, interesting dish.

Rating: 3
Yes, make this recipe, but don't leave anything out!! The onions and olives made the dish especially nice! I do agree, you could probably make it with skinless thighs, but I would leave the bones in for the bit of extra flavor the bones would add. Try it with the Yellow Rice with Sofrito as this recipe suggests.....they really go great together! Not only do the tastes compliment each other, but what a beautiful dish they make, especially with a green salad on the side!!

Very nice! The flavor was subtle but delicious. I used skinless, boneless thighs and skipped the onions altogether.
