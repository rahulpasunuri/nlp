Excellent! Much better than I expected.

I don't get it. I made this as written and felt it was bland. There are a number of things you could do to wake this up, but I would rather use my shrimp in a different recipe.

I kept rereading the recipe thinking that I'd missed an ingredient. As written, it's a bit bland. That said, it's easily doctored. I did not make the grits because I already had a dish of "baked cheese grits" in the oven. From there on, I pretty much made it as written, but just before serving made a couple of additions. Next time, I would NOT use a non-stick pan, there's enough bacon fat to keep the shallots and shrimp from sticking and a non-stick keeps that nice fond (brown bits) from developing. I would cut back on the clam juice to 3/4. The quick cooking time means it doesn't have time to reduce. As I was getting ready to serve, it seemed too brothy and bland, so I removed the shrimp to a platter, reduced the broth for another minute and added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce, lemon zest, fresh thyme, the hot sauce and a chunk of butter. Next time I'll add the spinach at this point too. Then I poured it over the shrimp. I usually don't review recipes that I make this many changed to, but these are things that can be done at the last minute if you feel the dish is as lackluster as I did. Otherwise, it comes together quickly and is good enough to add to the weekday rotation.

Delicious! I substituted canned Clam Sauce and it was probably even better than the clam juice called for in the original recipe. I recommend that this dish be served in a rimmed soup bowl or in a bowl with an underplate. A crisp Pinot Grigio compliments the dish.

I substituted chicken stock for the clam juice and used water and chicken stock to make the grits. The dish was packed with flavor and simple to make.

Whoever said this recipe was great is not from the South! I can make it much better and easier and less calories: use 1 cup of instant grits, use 3 c. H2O- not milk, 1 T. butter, salt and garlic powder. Cook the instant grits on low for more like 25 min. w/ lid on so they aren't so coarse. Check them frequently however, stirring so as not to get stuck on the bottom of the pan and add more water as needed. When you finish cooking them, the consistency should be that of cream of wheat - don't worry if you are adding a lot more water as they cook. Be sure to taste and flavor your grits well. Your dish is only as good as the grits. I used turkey bacon and added a T of canola oil to cook the garlic and onion. Next I added the clam j. When this boiled I added the chopped fresh spinach, sauteed til it just began to wilt and then added the shrimp and cooked until just pink. By this time the spinach is done as well. Serve as stated in the recipe with lemon, hot pepper and bacon pieces. Tada !!!! Very lean dish. My husband and kids liked it more than I did, but I'd still give it a 8 out of 10.

Being that I live in South Carolina I believe this is a must to know how to make. OMG, I love this dish!! I only used 1 shallot, doubled the garlic and added chopped mushrooms. My husband agreed this is definetly a recipe we will make again and again!

A wonderful dish. Being married to a former South Carolinian, my husband is particular with his shrimp and grits and he loved this. I believe his words were "Not bad for a Midwestern girl..." It came together really quickly and easily and the flavors were wonderful. Definitely making this again.

Wonderful, wonderful. Didn't have shallots on hand, but prepared the rest of the recipe as stated. Creamy, tasty "comfort food" without being heavy. Would make it for company.

This is drop dead delish! The only change I would make is to use thinly slced bacon. I didn't cook the shrimps in the bacon grease (ugh), but everything else was the same. My husband who thinks spinach is poison, loved everything and ate every leaf of the spinach.

This is amazing comfort food which is hard to imagine how given the simple list of ingredients. The result is a rich, multi-layered dish that tastes like it's been simmering for hours. Great fr the hearty eaters in my house.

Very good and easy to make. I added some shredded cheddar cheese to the grits to jazz them up. All the ingredients compliment each other very well. Loved the bacon on top. And don't forget the lemon juice and hot sauce.

This was a very tasty weeknight meal that comes together quickly and without much fuss. Needs the lemon and hot sauce but very good!
