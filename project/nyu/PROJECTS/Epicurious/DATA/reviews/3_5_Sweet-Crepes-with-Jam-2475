I substituted spiced rum for the dark, and cooked the crepes in a skillet rather than in the oven. It worked just as well, but I ended up with a lot (!) of crepes - tons more than 16. I put the rest in the freezer between wax paper, so tbd how they store. Great recipe, and super easy, even for a crepe novice like myself.

I used a little butter, sugar and lemon instead of jam and it was dreamy. Don't tell anyone, but I used tonic water instead of soda...shhhh.

Not very difficult to make. My wife and I really enjoyed it. Fortunately, I made extra crepes and will have it with another jam in a couple of days.
