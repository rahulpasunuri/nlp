I used a delicious home made mincemeat and it was devine.

Hmm, apparently I can't put a link in a comment. The URL is http://www.epicurious.com/cooking/how_to/food_dictionary/search?query=mincemeat

I enjoyed these and they were very easy to make--definitely easier than messing around making mince tarts. There was a lot of pastry left over though, I think you could make more than four turn-overs if you had enough filling. In answer to the person who asked about mincemeat (or fruit mince as it's known here), check out this link to the Epicurious food dictionary. It's available in the dried fruit section of supermarkets here and I've also seen it in delis. I actually used "luxury" fruit mince with cranberries and port, but didn't notice much of a taste difference.
