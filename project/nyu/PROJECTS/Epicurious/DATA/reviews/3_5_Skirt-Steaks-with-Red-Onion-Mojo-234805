I don't understand why this marinade calls for 4 cups of water. I thought it made the beef less flavorful.

Trutly delicious. I made it for a Cuban friend of mine and it was absolutely approved! The mojo is a must. I used flank steaks. Served with yellow rice, black beans, and fried plantains. Just make sure you fry the steaks for 3 minutes each side, I cooked a few minutes less and now I know: the crispier, the better! I used some coriander seeds for the picking spice.

I made this recipe for the first time for a huge party I was throwing -- I know, breaking that cardinal rule. Everyone told me that this was a phenomenal dish! I missed tasting it myself -- it was the first of 3 entrees to be finished before I got to the food table . . . but multiple people asked me for the recipe and said it was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe to the letter, with one exception: I baked the skirt steaks at 300 degrees only for 90 minutes, rather than at 350 degrees. Finished it off on the grill rather than stovetop, and I hear it was so tender, you could "cut" it with a fork. I will be eager to make it again. Based on the opinions (rave reviews!) of all the foodies I served it to, this recipe is a definite winner.

I recommend trying this recipe in a slow cooker instead. You can use an inexspensive cut of meat and it will be really tender. Best of all you can just fix it and forget it!

I substituted "flap meat" for skirt steak. That is what was available due to interest in this area in carne asada. I found the meat more difficult to chew than skirt steak, and a little stringy. Should I try again w/ meat from another market, or is flap meat just that way? Does anyone have experience w/ this? thanks!

This dish was quite a bit of work ( I decided to make this @ midnight one night). Loved the steak, not the mojo. It sounded like it was going to be out of this world. I wish I would have made my salsa to go with this steak!

My butcher said 'flap steak' was their name for skirt steak so that's what I used. The meat didn't look very promising - thin and stringy, but it was delicious! I made the recipe as given. My husband said it had too much cilantro but thought it would be good with other spices. I thought it was perfect and plan to keep some marinated meat in the freezer for quick lunches! I made the Red Onion Mojo too but neither of us liked it.

Tasted great, but the meat was as tough as an old army boot. I'd try it again using a much better piece of meat, just marinating the meat (skip the baking part). The red onion mojo is a must!

to those who don't like cilantro! i don't like it either, BUT it is an extroirdinary herb, which changes radically when combined with other flavors. don't be afraid of trying it out. use half or quarter amount rather then none. you will get the jist no matter what the quantity used. it sounds very good in this combination. just make sure, you rinse it well, there really is no substitute flavor for this one!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have not made this recipe but read reviews...would the marinade work for another type of steak maybe London Broil and then grilled?

dthays, cilantro is very distinctive, and using a different herb will change the flavor greatly. HOWEVER... if you can't stand cilantro (and lots of people are averse to it), flat-leaf parsley would be nice, too. And toss in some basil and a little mint if you have it.

I'm not a huge fan of cilantro - is there anything else that I could use or would that completely change the flavor?

This was delicious, however I would not cook the meat this way. Marinade overnight and then grill. The meat was flavorful but chewy with the cooking, marinating,etc. The red onion mojo was delicious as well.

This was very good. The ingredients for the marinade is good, and I followed the recipe as written. In addition, I did cook the meat as suggested and followed the cool down instuctions. I let it marinade in the refrigerator for approx. 7 hours. Here's what I would do differently next time: Cook the skirt steak 30 minutes only...1 hour is too long for this type of meat. In addition, I would also marinade the meat longer...over night as recommended in the recipe! Make sure you take it out of the refrigerator to come to room temperature before you sear it. Also, do salt and pepper it. I was generous with the kosher salt and it could have used more. Right before you serve it the meat needs to be seared...HOT pan is essential. 1/3 a cup of oil to too much oil. I used my grill pan...way better that a frying pan! I will attempt this again!
