Easy to make and wonderful flaky texture.

Absolutely a four-forker! (And the last time I made it, I forgot to add the 2 tblsp. of shortening to the butter. Perhaps that's why I had to add five tblsp. ice water.) This is obviously a forgiving dough (if you don't overwork it as I once did) that always results in the flakiest, melt-in-the-mouth crust. It's the perfect crust for tarts. I recently paired this with Caramelized Upside Down Pear Tart, and the results were out of this world--truly heavenly. I did find that chilling the dough for two hours made it too firm to roll out, but bringing it to near room temp made rolling effortless.

Easy to make and oh so yummy! I think I have made this 5 times in 5 months.

This is simply a perfect dough. Did exactly as per recipe.

This is a simple, yet tender, pastry dough that uses mostly butter but a little shortening to keep the crust delicate yet easy to handle. Great compromise.

This will be the last pie crust recipe I try! The dough was a pleasure to work with. Made Thanksgiving pie making a breeze especially when you use the food processer on pulse instead of cutting in the butter/shorting.

Simply put: The best pastry dough I have ever made.

i was in a hurry and accidentally threw in the whole stick of butter ... and let's just say it was NOT a problem. flakiest, yummiest crust i've ever made (especially because i resisted the temptation to overwork the dough). i'll add the same bonus butter next time!
