We just returned from New Orleans and a visit to Chef Besh's Restaurant August. I bought his cookbook recently and have made several recipes, including these beignets, which were absolutely fabulous, especially with our gourmet "dunking" sauces. See our blog post here, with our notes/suggestions on the recipe: http://newfinmysoup.blogspot.com/2011/03/crown-city-beignets.html

i thought that this recipe looked like a good pick for new years brunch... they tasted good - but i have had better luck with other recipes. the dough was nice but a little too dense, they did not puff up like the little pillows i was expecting...and my yeast was new. the recipe is fussy with the last rise. as an aside, we like our beignets bite sized instead of 2" squares - but that shoudln't have affected how the dough behaved in the oil.

LOL! The e-mailed version of this recipe deleted the dash in "refrigerate 6 - 8 hours." So I read it as "refrigerate 68 hours." The beignets were good, but not as light and fluffy as I had expected...most likely due to my misread of the recipe. Looking forward to trying this recipe again.

delicious. I actually like my with a dab of orange honey butter, tucked inside. Add a cup of strong black french roast coffee on the side, and your in heaven.
