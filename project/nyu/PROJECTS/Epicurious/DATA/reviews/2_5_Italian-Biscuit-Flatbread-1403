Excellent idea, but the next time I will change some things as these came out way too salty with the ingredients as listed. First, I would use only 1/2 C. of the Romano, and more like 2/3 C. of the mayo; then maybe only 1/4 tsp. of the garlic powder (or maybe fresh) along with some freshly chopped basil instead of the dry. It IS a good idea and once I've perfected the combinations it will be a winner! Don't let get too brown! KIMBER
