If you like both coffee and coconut, you will love this one. Really a unique recipe, not your run of the mill dessert. Love it and so does everyone that has tried it!

I always read reviews before trying the recipe so made this. I can only say: yikes. For the calories, not nearly good enough.

This is a fast easy tart. Will definitely make again. Is really best on the second day. The flavors intensify.

Between my sister and me, this dessert was made at least three times over the holidays for various occasions. It is easy to prepare, very elegant looking and Delicious!!

Decadent, sinful, unforgettable, and reqeusted by many. If you love Starbuck's coconut frappies, this is a must! I added a handful of toasted coconut to the filling and added coconut extract in lieu of vanilla for the the whip topping. I only have instant espresso crystals and 3 tsp. is plenty for the filling, 1/2 tsp for crust.

If you love coffee and coconut, this is a spectacular way to combine 2 distinct flavors. Easy enough and always a hit at dinner parties!

This is a relatively simple recipe with very interesting flavor combinations. The coconut called for in the crust give it a very nice chew. Watch out when making the filling. It thickens up and overcooks very easily.
