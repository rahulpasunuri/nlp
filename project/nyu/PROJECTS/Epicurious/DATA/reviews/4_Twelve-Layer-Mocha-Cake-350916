This was Excellent. No way you can finish this in 4.5hrs unless you have lots of extra bowls and a cleaning helper though. The buttercream took a couple of hours. Making the layers and layering took a few hours as well w/ lots of cleaning between layers. I made the mistake of cutting back on the butter of the buttercream and didn't have enough to cover the top, so I made a quick chocolate ganache and put that on top before trimming the edges. Don't throw away the edges...put some into a small bowl and microwave it for 15sec and you'll have something that tastes like mocha/chocolate bread pudding..mmmmm :-) I think the only thing I'd do differently is put some of the expresso syrup on the chocolate cake layers which were a bit dry even after letting the cake sit a few days for it to absorb moisture from the buttercream. This cake ends up roughly the size of half a baking sheet, so there's plenty to share to any of your lucky friends who get to taste it :-)

I made this cake for Christmas dinner, 2 years ago, and my guests are STILL talking about it! It was simply divine. My only job for dinner that year was desserts, and thank goodness for that. Had I been tasked with any other dishes, I think I would have gone crazy. It was extremely time-consuming (especially after two failed attempts on the coffee buttercream because I attempted to use fresh cooled espresso instead of the powder - big mistake) but it was all worth it. Take pictures upon completion, and even better, take video of your guests devouring this masterpiece - the compliments will be worth saving!

Epic cake! But very complicated. I don't believe you could make it by yourself (no one to separate the eggs and wash mixer bowls) in 4 1/5 hours. I have two small children (2.9 and 5 months) so had to split it over 6 days. Then it is manageable. Separate all the eggs one night. Make buttercreams next day. Bake meringue next day - wrapped tightly, it keeps well for a week. And so on. Actually assembled the cake the night before serving. I followed the recipe exactly in all steps and every component turned out well. I did find though, that the cake layers benefit from whipping the yolks as well as the whites. The souffle is out of this world. My only gripe is the amount of buttercream between layers. It is TOO MUCH. I used a scant cupful, and even that was a bit much. This cake is so rich, and there are 6 layers of buttercream. You don't want them to be almost half an inch thick. Other than that, it is one of the great cakes; will definitely make again. And as other reviewers have noted, it certainly feeds more than 8. I wouldn't go through this whole thing for fewer than 16.

Fantastic! My 17 year old daughter made this for Father's Day. It took her about 41/2 hours. The only thing I helped her do was figure out when the sugar was at a softball stage. (my candy thermometer is always off). The only thing I would do differently is to turn the oven off and open the door for the last 45 minutes to dry out the meringue. If you continue to cook the meringue as written it will taste a little burnt. But don't worry. The flavor actually works fabulously. My daughter followed the recipe exactly as written and it is great. Will definitely make again.

This took me exactly three hours. If you're an experienced baker, and know how to prep and multitask, this shouldn't take any more time (like I had started the buttercream while the meringue was baking). The buttercream set up beautifully, not one problem. Anyway, the cake itself is absolutely magnificent! Flavors are divine, and the combination perfect. While trimming it, I was able to sample everything, and what a yum! Some tips - prepare in advance: cut your parchment days prior, separate all the eggs at once in the beginning, toast the nuts while preheating the oven for the cake layer...doing things like this will greatly reduce your overall time. I also made some chocolate leaves for the top as a little decor.

One word for this - FANTASTIC! Yes it's labor intensive but definitely worth it. Made it for Easter and everyone said it was fabulous. We did have trouble with the coffee buttercream. The Mocha turned out fine, but the coffee buttercream had broken when we went to use it. So we added melted white chocolate to it. The white chocolate helped to emulsify the fats, yet added virtually no flavor of its own. Great solution. We also added one layer of marscarpone cheese that had been mixed with Nutella. A really good addition. This gave us enough of the coffee buttercream to be able to frost the outside of the entire cake. I will definitely make this again!

It turns out much better then I thought! The worst part was the buttercream...Other than the buttercream, it takes time but it's all good. Next time I might not use the sheet pens so I don't have to cut everything in two pieces.

Just made this! Other than a few things I would do differently next time - learning curve, but otherwise - AWESOME! Changes to ingredients - I used Land 'O Lakes margarine (contains 80% vegetable oil) for the buttercream. Since I wasn't sure how it would turn out, I made a half batch. WOW - I ended up with 5-1/2 cups of coffee buttercream! The next batch I used unsalted butter as called for and it only made 3 cups of buttercream. I refrigerated the buttercreams since I made them the day before the cakes. Even after letting it warm back up for 2 hrs. I still had to put the second batch back in the mixer to get it soft enough to spread. Whereas the first batch with the Land 'O Lakes, I was able to just use my hand whisk a few times and it was nice and smooth. Substituted Splenda in the cake, souffle and meringue recipes without any problems. I truly enjoyed creating this special dessert - the 4-1/2 hrs flew by!

I just finished making this for our annual holiday house party with friends. It took me just about 4.5 hours. Next time I would definitely make cake layers one day, buttercream the next. From the taste of the layers when I trimmed it up, unbelievable. The buttercream is incredibly good and all the layers together with the buttercream are just so delicious. I know for a fact my friends tonight will be blown away!! Make this for a special occasion, it is totally worth it...

I just finished assembling this mother of a cake. I have not tasted it yet but there is no way it will be anything less than super yummy. My 2 year old couldn't keep her little fingers out of the coffee buttercream. My only suggestion is double the recipe and do it for a special occassion as it is a significant amount of work. I am positive I will make this again.

The cake is beautiful, but is a LOT of work. My cooking skills were no help at all, but my baking skills did. Like others, I made this over 2 days. The cake layers (BTW, since when are frosting layers counted, this is a SIX-layer cake!) were easy enough, but even with a stand mixer, that gorgeous buttercream was a pain. Our cool climate means proofing bread or making creme fraiche takes forever, but was perfect for making this buttercream. It cooled in less than half an hour, hastened by an ice bath. Assembly was easy, I shouldn't have worried about lining the layers up too much, they just get cut off, perfect for secret snacking later. But this was way too much work, although I will make it again if my husband requests it. I'll remind him about the 6 sticks of butter and the dozen and a half eggs, and that I used all the sugar I had in the house, but I'd endure it all again if a loved one requests it. Oh, and it definitely serves more than eight, and is too rich to be appreciated after a heavy meal.

This is one of the best cakes I've made. It's restaurant quality and SUPER rich. I served it in literally 2 inch by 2 inch columns. Only alteration was to sub in a layer of chocolate hazelnut mousse (from another Epi recipe) for the middle buttercream because others said it was too rich and you don't have enough buttercream. Good addition. Couple tips: When cutting, don't go straight down from the top. Come in at an angle and use a sawing action with the sharpest knife you have. Spread your layers VERY even as they will bake almost exactly as you spread them and you want perfect rectangles. The sponge layer shrunk on me a bit. I made the entire cake with handbeaters. Totally possible although you'll need a glass of wine to calm yourself down when you think the buttercream will never come together. Took 15 min for me. Beat it with some ice below the bowl which helped. I made the mousse (my addition) and buttercreams the day before and then the cake layers the day of. Wrap the sides up with plastic wrap when chilling or transporting or storing. Would be GREAT served with a tart berry sauce or changing up some of the flavors in the layers to be chocolate and berries...for next time! Overall awesome showstopper!

I made this cake for my grandfather's 98th birthday. I am not an avid baker and the recipe was pretty straight forward. The cake was DELICIOUS! I made the three cakes one day ahead of time and the buttercream the following day. My little 2 1/2 year nephew didn't even touch his kid friendly cupcake and went straight for this cake! When sliced and plated, the cake is really elegant and so special. I did alter the recipe for the butter cream (cut the butter in half and a little less sugar) and everything was perfect!

Like previous reviews, my guests found this to be a hand down grand slam winner. Its so good that it became THE topic for one hour after dinner. Here are my notes. 1. Final amount is enough for 18-22 people. Its huge rich cake. 2. The first time I made this cake it took 5 hours--and re-did the butter creams. It could be done in 4 hours but you must have a great mixer and food processor. 3. Split prep of the layers and assembly over two days. I was burnt out after prepping the three layers and butter creams. 4. I cooked the cake layer too far and did not heed the directions close enough. Definitely pull the cake from the oven when just turning brown. 5. The buttercream will need to soften before assembly so remove it from the fridge early in the day. I found the microwaving the butter creams in 10 sec bursts softened them nicely.

I made this cake for my birthday last week. I am an experienced baker and enjoy the challenge of baking and assembling more difficult and exotic cakes. The cake was rather time-consuming. However, I spent less time making it than I would have spent making an Opera Cake. It definitely had with the same panache and wow- factor, as well as a complex, rich taste, crunchy and silken textures and amazing mouth-feel. It was exceptional! I hosted 12 persons for cake and champagne after dinner out, and everyone raved about it! One of my friends called me to tell me she dreamed about the cake, it was so good! Word to the wise - allot at least 45 minutes for the buttercream to cool. My old reliable Kitchenaid stand mixer got a workout and I even placed ice packs around the base of the mixing bowl to expedite the cooling. The meringue layers also crumble easily, so handle with care. Do yourself or someone you love a favor...make this cake and enjoy every bite!

After my cousin made this cake for Christmas a few years ago, I have asked my Mom to make it for my birthday every year. She made it this year. It was amazing. She made it into an 18 layer by cutting each layer in thirds rather than in half. Twas amazing.

Followed recipe exact. Made one day ahead assembled. It takes the full 4 1/2 hrs + clean up but it is worth it! If you don't have a counter top mixer or a "fluff" attachment for a food processor, mixing will take a LONG time especially the buttercreams. It says it serves 8; I cut it in 12 and the pieces were still too large for the richness of the cake. I think it can easily serve around 16.

Incredible Buttercream! Be careful pouring the sugar into the merrangue, it flies! Notes in the buttercream recipe are bang-on. Looks like it's curdles and poof, it all starts to come together with about 2/3 of the butter incorporated. Not remarkably complex, but time consuming. Patience will reward you. Of course, the accolades will be welcomed too. Take the advise of many, spread it out over two days (I did my buttercream many days in advance). Additional info: I didn't have any powdered espresso powder so I used "coffee crisp" instant cappuccino and a tidbit of instant coffee. Really mellow flavour. For the chocolate I used a mix of 3/4 90% dark chocolate and 1/4 semi-sweet.

This cake is really a show-stopper. I made it for my parents combined birthdays and they were amazed. The layers came out beautifully and presentable, even though I am a new baker! As a rule I always cut sugar wherever I can, but because consistency is such a huge part of this cake I just used a very dark chocolate, 70%-80%. The sweetness came out perfect. Because I used a bigger pan size than they did in the recipe, I had to double the cake and meringe layers, but kept the buttercream and soufle layers as written. Because of this the soufle layer was thinner than it should have been and burned so I had to remake this layer. As recommended, spread this project over 2 days--I began at 8am and finished roughly around 3-4pm. However, if I need to make an amazing cake again I will turn to this recipe.

superb flavor. I made this cake for my birthday and everyody raved about it. I am glad I split up the process in 2 days. A few things I would do differently: the buttercream was the best part; however, i would let is cool a lot longer. it ended up a little runnier than desired. the final product was not table-presentable, but the nicely cut squares were great-looking. also, because the buttercream was not as ridgid, it was tricky to keep the cake layers from sliding. Next time I will build it in a small rectangle mold and not worry about presentation as much.

This cake is amazing! I made it in just under 4 hours and that's only because my 6 month old was fussy. This cake is easy to make if you are an experienced baker. I don't recommend it to beginners in the kitchen. The instructions are straightforward and the taste is exceptional! Best buttercream ever although (thanks to my 6 month old), I accidently burned the chocolate for the buttercream so I just used the espresso on the entire cake. Still came out fabulous!

Didn't have time to make the whole cake in one sitting so made two separate cakes and both were phenomenal! For the first cake, I used the cake layers and souffle layers and alternated/cheated with store bought chocolate frosting and Nutella. Uh-mazing... The second cake had the cake layers and meringue with the linked coffee and mocha buttercreams. Uhn-believable.

Wow, as many commenters have said here, this is a fantastic cake! Many thanks for all your good advices. As many recommended I did the cakes one day, the buttercream the day after, chill the cake, cut it nicely (to show all the layers) the third day - when it was eaten during the "réveillon". Everything went well; here are my 2-cents... As I can't have cow dairy products, I used goat butter (which is just a bit salty) and nobody noticed it. I used a double shot espresso in the syrup for the sponge cake and a one- shot in the buttercream syrup. The coffee taste was perfectly balanced. I used 64% bittersweet chocolate. The buttercream curdled a lot after after the addition of all the butter, but keeping beating it (4-5 min) it became the smoothest buttercream I even made. The layers showed very nicely and I used 1 1/4 cups of cream on each layer. This cake can definitely serve 16-20 guests.

A little hint about cutting the cake, do not cut it chilled! The buttercream layers will harden and separate from each of the many layers. Just let the cake come to room temp, use a sharp knife (didn't even need to heat it) and it will cut easily.

Best cake ever, made this for Christmas. Daughter and son started the cake and souffle layer on the 24 th. My daughter and I made the merinque and buttercream christmas morning. I think it may have been overwhelming if we tried to do it all in one day. Buttercream took forever,double the time they had stated. had to do an ice bath for at least 15 minutes, but well worth it. My mother said we could have told her we bought it from one of the many wonderful bakery's around the bay area and she would have believed us. It is a very rich dessert, especially after a wonderful standing rib roast dinner. Everybody had at least a small piece, and my father and husband who sometimes don't even have dessert, had seconds. Before dinner I thought it would serve 8. After dinner I thought 16 servings. A day later I still say 16 serving after a good meal. I will definitely make it again. Maybe for New Years.

Made this for Christmas eve and it was a show stopper. Recommend making over 2 days as many others. The buttercream was light, yet rich at the same time. The hazelnuts should be bought whole, I used "chopped hazelnuts", and had to spend time after toasting to pick skin off of small pieces, and then had to chop it because it wasn't a fine chop. We used a combo of 75% and 60% dark chocolate and it was great. I'd recommend having several sets of mixing bowls or a very dedicated dishwasher! Was a little afraid that we messed up the souffle portion because it didn't "puff up" like a traditional one would. Maybe we did mess that up, but it still tasted fantastic. It puffed a tiny bit and did deflate a tiny bit after putting the wet paper towels on it? All in all, every layer worked very well off of each other. I would probably make this recipe again if I waited long enough to forget just how long it took to get through all the layers! This serves way more than the recipe states, We had 6 for dinner and have well over a half of the cake left. The only part I might have upped was the espresso powder in the buttercream, and that very well might have been the brand I used. We had 2 people making, cleaning, and assembling this beauty, and it took us (with one extra souffle layer made) about 6-7 hrs over two days with a mimosa break or two.

So good! Time consuming but definitely worth the effort. I LOVE this cake! A few adjustments that might be helpful: I do not have 10x15 pans so I used regular 9x13 pans. I cooked each layer for an extra 2-5 minutes to allow for the difference in thickness. As for the meringue layers make sure you spread it evenly. The cake and souffle layers were more forgiving and evened out on their own, but the meringue will bake just the way you spread it. Don't skip the buttercream. It was my first time doing this and it still came together perfectly! It only took about 15 minutes in total for my sugar to come to the soft ball stage so keep an eye on it. Make this!

Not rating this yet... (I will be making this for christmas... I will rate it then). A bit of advice on the buttercreams though... if you made them and thought they tasted intensely like butter, did you maybe use salted butter? It is very important when making meringue buttercreams to use unsalted butter or you end up with something that tastes like sweetened butter... good on a warm scone maybe, but not on a cake. =] I make meringue buttercream all of the time (I make cakes for a living) and it tastes more like vanilla ice cream than butter if you use the unsalted butter. I know not everyone loves meringue based buttercreams, especially American palets since we are used to the overly sweet powdered sugar type buttercreams, but using unsalted butter makes a WORLD of difference. Happy Baking!

Baking the cake layers one day and making the buttercream & finishing the next made it quite manageable. (I also had only one pan for the layers). This cake makes one impressive presentation (added chocolate curls to the smooth top). However, I thought it was too rich and so did my husband, although my 6 dinner guests devoured their pieces. Be sure to cut it into small-ish squares--the buttercream is extremely rich. This would easily serve 16-18. Problem with souffle layer falling apart (may have been a bit overdone), also hard to tell when the meringue layer is "done" cooking. Mine was not crisp coming out of the oven and yet it hardened when cooled. Make sure to refrigerate a while before slicing the ends straight and take it out of the refrigerator over an hour before serving--I think mine was still a bit too cool and the buttercream was more the texture of butter--not quite soft enough... I'd probably make it again, just because it's such a "wow" dessert...

I made this for a party at my in-laws house and it made a spectacular impression. It was large enough that I cut it in two and took it to two different parties. Both places loved it. The in-laws was the crucial one though, as they and their friends are fairly snobbish. Yes, this cake takes a long time to make, but as long as you read ALL the directions, follow them step by step any idiot could make it. My suggestion: measure all your ingredients beforehand (where possible) and set them out on the counter in the order you'll need them. It saves you headache, and makes it move faster. The flavor of this cake was spectacular and the final presentation makes it a show-stopper. Well worth the effort.

This recipe was recommended from my relative. She has mentioned this cake was very attractive and tastes like a store bought cake, which means that its very delicious. I went ahead and gave this one a try. Believe me it is ALOT of work but its well worth it at the end. I made the cake layers one day and assembled it the next, its just too much work in one day so I split it up. I also used one 70% cocoa bar and one 50% cocoa bar (they were both 3.5 ounces each which equals 6oz) from Lindt chocolates since they did not carry 60%. It came out just fine. I used a different meringue recipe, which is just 4 egg whites and 1 1/2 cups of sugar. Beat that until small peaks formed and folded in toasted hazelnuts. Came out awesome! Other than that followed the recipe. Over all great cake! Buttercream is an A++. Love how the cake looks, cant wait to entertain my guests!

I'm a huge fan of coffee, chocolate, and hazelnut, so from an eating standpoint this was the perfect cake. It was very labor intensive and took longer than the 4.5 hours stated on the recipe. It definitely helps to have multiple mixers and several sets of beaters. I had some trouble with the coffee buttercream coming together (when I added the chocolate for the mocha buttercream it came together beautifully.) I think it may have been too warm when I started adding the butter, so I just chilled and stirred while I made the rest of the layers and it turned out okay...not pretty, but the flavor was great. All in all a fabulous recipe for a dedicated cook.

I thought the buttercream in this cake was overpowering in butter flavor. I've made similar recipes and would not make this recipe again as is. The cake layers were very good, particularly the hazelnut layer, but I would tie them together differently next time. Perhaps with a layer or two of chocolate ganache.

Some tips: Target sells Ghiardelli 60% cacao chips in a 11.5 ounce bag for only $2.50. This is almost all of the chocolate you need for this recipe. I accidently spent 3 times this much for the same amt of chocolate at the grocery. Target also sells the espresso powder. I didn't have a 10X15 in. pan so I used two 9 inch cake pans. The total area is just slightly larger than that of the other pan so I decreased baking times very slightly (like a minute or two. The meringue was more than finished in 1 hour total. Save the extra two whites in the cake layer for the meringue for less waste. I don't have a sifter and just rubbed the cocoa over the souffle layers which turned out fine.

WOW!!! I made this cake for my husbands birthday. I covered the cake with white fondant and orange and mocha colour flowers. It looked stunning. In stead of one flat sheet and cutting the layers in half I used 2 square pans. I was competing with a cake made by a pastry chef and guess who's cake was eaten first. Next time I would make a bit more butter cream. If you use a realy sharp knife and have the cake chilled well, the layers show realy nicely.

I signed up for a profile here just to review this recipe. I made this for my Mom for Mother's Day this weekend. Hands down the BEST dessert I've ever had. Well worth the time and effort to make this. And if you break or crack the souffle or meriange layer when working with it, just piece it back together. After refrigeration it all comes together nicely and no one will ever know. Also, if you will refrigerate it before you trim to make the edges all even, it will look much like the photo. Refrigeration seems to set it up nicely to be able to view all the layers you worked so hard on. Absolutely fantastic cake and will definitely be at the top of my list to make for other special occasions. But, only attempt to make it if you truly love to be in the kitchen...it is a commitment but not without great reward :o)

This was a lot of fun to make! Long-time baker, but I don't make cakes too often. I found the directions to be easy and accurate, as long as you read them carefully. I couldn't count the twelve layers in my slices as well as I could in the photo here. And as far as the estimated time, I perhaps could have done it in that time with a kitchen staff and a dedicated utensil washer. Would definitely make it again for a special occasion. My guests really enjoyed it.

This cake was fun to make! I made the buttercreams on one day, then the cake layers the next day and saved the assembly for Christmas morning. An absolute show-stopper!

While I really enjoyed this cake and everyone raved over it at my husband's birthday party, I found it a little too rich. If I were to make this again, I would perhaps substitute a mocha mousse or whipped cream for a couple of the buttercream layers. I loved the hazelnut meringue layer... crunchy and tasty! It really put this cake over the top. I cleaned up the edges with a hot sharp knife and had no real difficulties. Following the recipe to a t made it come together wonderfully.

This is sooooooo delicious. If you want to know what it tastes like, just go out and buy a Toblerone bar. Tastes EXACTLY like that, plus phenomenal buttercream and souffle. This is so special... but VERY VERY time consuming. Took me about 6 hours over two days. But putting it together at the end? So much fun. The cake layer is very thin, but it doesn't matter much. The souffle layer is divine. I didn't mix the meringue buttercream til it cooled, I only did it for about 5-7 minutes and then refrigerated it. I'm impatient. I sprinkled the leftover chopped hazelnuts on top of the cake and that really brought it all together. MAKE THIS CAKE!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. Definitely time consuming, but so worth it. My only problem was the layers being a little too thin. Be very careful to scrap every little bit of the batter out of your mixing bowls. I did not leave that much, but trust me you need every bit of it. Also this will definitely make more than 8 servings! It is very rich so half a slice is more than enough for pretty much everyone.

A special occasion dessert totally worth the effort. Make sure you have plenty of time to make it. I made layers the day before and assembled the next morning. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems and a little extra buttercream. I think if you added extra buttercream the layers would slide and be hard to cut. It is important to chill the cake for a few hours so that everything will set well and it will cut easily. It keeps well for several days in the fridge.

To susankatz from Armonk. A word of caution. If you switch from hazelnuts to pecans as you said you wanted to do, be careful as pecans are much more oily than hazelnuts and may ruin the meringue. If you don't like hazelnuts a better alternative would be almonds, not as oily as pecans.

This was delicious.... I did run out of coffee buttercream on the 10th layer (I followed the assembly directions putting exactly 1.25 cups of buttercream every time) ---- this lead to a slight tantrum and my having to make more buttercream an hour before my guests were to arrive. Other than that the cake was a hit, no problems cutting it or anything.

I just had to add, that I brought it to the party and a lot of people commented on what a beautiful Tarimisu. So maybe add some chocolate swirls or pipe some extra buttercream on top or maybe wrap in chocolate (just in case you need another step!) And I would also reccomend cutting it down the middle then cutting slices because people started cutting the corners off and then it was hard to cut from then on. Tasted delicious!

WOW! This is a show stopper. I made it over three days. The first day the cake, then day two the souffle and meringue. I had no problem with my meringue being to hard. My layers were not a puffy as the picture and I had to make my meringue on a rainy day but had no problems. It does take a lot of time but over the three days, not really so bad. No pipping of frosting or designs, all in all once steps completed I had fun putting it together and could not stop eating the buttercream. Mine curdled a little at the end but I was more worried about my mixer overheating! I think next time I will use pecans since I am not a big fan of hazelnuts. When I was stacking my layers i would build the corners up with butter cream bc they corners tended to droop a little. My 15"x10" worked fine and since I made it over 3 days, I only used the one pan. I used Trader Joe's dark chocolate and 72% chocolate bar. They used to have bittersweet pound bar but changed the name to dark and it has exactly the same ingredients that the bittersweet did. I mixed the two to get 60% cocoa. Cant wait to bring it to party tonight. Its beautiful.

First made the cake layers (2 sheets at once) and when cooled, froze them. Then made meringue layers which I wrapped and left out at room temp. On Thursday, made souffle layers. Friday, did buttercreams and assembly. I only increased the buttercream by 30% since reviewers said it was more than enough. This was enough for layers but not for decoration so on Saturday made a quick kahlua buttercm for edging and a chocolate ganache for the birthday writing. Finally, I couldn't resist splashing some kahlua into the simple syrup. Each step isn't so time consuming and I only needed two jelly roll pans. Basically, I couldn't stop, but the raves and hugs and amazement made it so worth it. a special occasion dessert for sure.

As many bakers said, this is a cake that you needs to take time to make it. I didn't timed myself but it took a few days to make it. I made a few layer ahead of time. However, I had a problem with meringue. Mine become like a sheet of tile so I had to crumble and spread on top of cake and soak with sugar syrup to not to be so crunchy. My cake didn't come out as a picture. It should state in the recipe that it need to be freeze and cut with sharp knife to get a better presentation. Other than that, my crowds raved and compliment that my skill getting to be a pastry chef.

WOW! My guests loved this. They couldn't believe it was home made. I found the instructions easy to follow. When I make this again, I will prepare all the parts over the course of two or three days, and assemble the day of. We had enough left over to enjoy for the rest of the week, and it kept really well.

Whew, what a labor of love, but the end result was worth it. I had no difficulty following the instructions even about dusting the cocoa.. I also had the correct pan sizes apparently so the layers were fine. It helps to read through the instructions very carefully once or twice before commencing this endeavor. The other comments were correct about the amount of time. It took me 4.5 - 5 hours. I made it for New Year's Eve in the middle of the day and afternoon and then started dinner after that! I was a little worried when the buttercream curdled, but as the recipe stated, it "came back" and was a good consistency to spread. Very good buttercream but I don't want to think about the calories. I could not find instant espresso powder so I made a regular cup of espresso and used it in the sugar syrupwithout mishap. Then I kept a little bit to use for the espresso syrup wash for the cake layers. The recipe serves more than 12 peopleespecially after a big fancy meal. I would never make this except for a very, very special occasion.

Everyone seems to agree that this recipe is difficult...you have to enjoy a challenge to make it! But I received rave reviews when I made it for Christmas day - it's definitely worth it for a special occasion!

If you want to impress people, make this cake. However, don't try this unless you truly enjoy cooking. It's not something you can throw together - you will kill the better part of a day. Mine took about 6.5 hours. Definitely for special occasions only. Well worth the effort in my opinion.

I have to say...for all the work, it didn't knock my socks off.

I made this for a big family Christmas party and got amazing reviews. It was the only dessert of about 10 items that was completely finished and two guests were literally scraping the serving utensils and the parchment paper for the last bite! It was labour intensive compared to a usual cake but not that much more complicated. It helped to do the cake in several days. I did the cake, souffle and meringue in one day and the buttercreams, syrup and assembly in another. I also agree with another reviewer that the 15" x 10" pan size was odd. I had 12" x 18" pans and ended up splitting the cake into thirds for height so I ended up with more layers. The only caution is to make sure to spread the layers very evenly as the batter spreads very thin and can create an uneven layer after baking. The instructions do seem scattered, but the results are worth it! One reviewer had trouble finding where to put the cocoa powder in the souffle layer, I think it is just dusted on top after the souffle is done. I didn't see where in the instructions to add the salt in the meringue layer but that was pretty easy to figure out. I found it odd that the buttercream recipes make enough for leftovers when it just goes to waste. Next time I would just try to use it all instead of just using the 1/4 cup measure on each layer as suggested. (I even used 1/2 cup measure and still had leftovers) All in all, what a beautiful cake that impresses in looks and taste.

This was delicious. It got rave reviews from everyone at Christmas dinner. It took me about 6 hours to make. Its very tedious, but not bad if you just plan to do it leisurely. The only problem I had was with the meringue layer. I think it got too crispy. I couldn't get it out in one piece, so I ended up sprinkly crumbled meringue for those layers. It worked fine and still tasted great. The espresso buttercream is so good!

So. I made this cake and it took a VERY LONG TIME. I like making fussy recipes-i suppose in hopes that it would yield good results. Good- The flavor and presentation is good. I especially like the souffle and the spongecake layers. The merigue buttercream is also very good. it looks complex and the flavors are all very good together. questionable- I didn't fully understand how much the souffle is supposed to deflate. Mine deflated but not all the way (still a bit spongy). It is very hard to transfer during assembly since it so soft and broke at the edges. We patched it up with lots of icing. I don't understand how one should "dry" the meringue layer. i dried it at 350 deg. and it got toasty and almost burnt after 35 min. it did not tell us to turn off the oven.. I'm glad i checked. the dried meringue also posed another problem- it is hard to cut through that layer. I couldn't brush on all the espresso onto the cake because of kids, i lightly brushed. I regret this because i know that the cake is supposed to be moist. I think it is too cold to make this, the icing and the cake did not have a change to meld with each other. I have not done a meringue icing ahead of time before this. i chilled 1 day and brought it back to room temp (still pretty cold though). it is solid hard. i broke it down with the mixer and it broke, but finally came together at the end. wierd. is it just me? the mocha buttercream is harder to re-constitute. i think i overworked it and it came out a bit grainy. no one noticed though. make sure you have the right pan. i used a 9x13 and it came out very tall and we had to eat the cake sideways because the piece would topple over... messy cuts because i can't get through the merigue...

@erthywmn: the cocoa is used when making the souffle layers - it says to sift the cocoa over the souffle after it cools and before you cut it in half... :)

I wish you could give two ratings-- one for instructions (i'ld give it a 2) and another for the finished product (I'd give it a 4). I agree with the previous reviewer who said that they said "never again" until they heard the responses of their guests. This was a very difficult recipe. The times listed were not accurate and I eneded up making the buttercream 3 times because I kept cooking it too long. Before doing it again, I think I would re-write the recipe instructions with times highlighted and then know that you should check the layers at half the recommended time. Definitely read and re-read the entire recipe so you can understand what you are up against before starting and give yourself a couple of days. The meringue layer was not hard but the cooking time, drying time realy adds up. Regarding the comments about the nuts, living in Texas we have lots of pecans. If I were doing it again, I would probably just use pecans since I always have them. I don't think it would affect the outcome. My husband is European and this is the sort of recipe that he grew up on so when I see things like this, I always try it. Completing the recipe was sort of like giving birth...labor was hard but it's a beautiful baby.

Nut allergy response-I recently learned that not all nuts are in the same category. So someone who is alleric to peanuts may not be alleric to almonds etc So I would check with the person/internet and toast up a different one or simply omit.

I definitely plan to make this so will review properly after I do...but anyone have any suggestions for making this for someone who can't eat nuts? I was considering making a mocha merange instead...or leaving the merange plain...ANY & ALL SUGGESTIONS WELCOME!!

Holy Cow! This cake is crazy long-good though. Definately spread it over a couple days. It took me an easy 6 hours and I swore I would never do it again until the raves poured in. Indead, the instructions also take a bit to decipher. Read and follow closely. The butter cream is the best I've ever tasted.

I made this cake for a Christmas party. The flavors and textures are very good. But it was fairly difficult.The recipes calls for 1T of unsweetened cocoa but never tells you when to add it. So I researched other souffle recipes to figure it out. I also have half sheet pans but, apparantly not all 1/2 sheet pans are the same size. Mine were 16x12 and the recipe call for 15x10. which I didn't relize till I went to cut the cakes in half. Yes, it's my fault, I should have checked the size of the pans before using them. My cake layers were a little thin, but the cake tasted great.

This is what a cake consisting of 12 layers should be. The highlight of the concoction is the toasted hazelnut meringue. The cake was a time consuming endeavor, but it can be divided between two days. I made the layers (three kinds) in one day and then the frosting the next. I've never been a big fan of taking the time to do a meringue frosting (swiss, or whathaveyou), BUT this was worth the effort and would be delicious on a chocolate or exceptional vanilla white cake. I would make this again, but I would cut the pieces smaller. In fact, after a nice dinner, this would easily serve twice as many as the recipe indicates. If you are looking for something that looks professional but tastes homemade, this is the recipe for you. Oh yeah....just make sure you plan accordingly. Don't be like me and start baking the layers at 10:30 PM....
