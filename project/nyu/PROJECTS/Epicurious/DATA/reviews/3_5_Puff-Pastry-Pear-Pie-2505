I would have rated this two forks but as others in my family were more impressed, I'm giving it three. Agree with previous reviewer that this pie was awfully similar to apple pie. Yes, the texture of the pears gave it away, but taste-wise, there was little difference. Not that I have anything against apple pie, of course (!) but I was looking for something that brought out the taste of the pears more. The pastry was wonderful and I will definitely remember using puff pastry for pies in the future.

This is a nice recipe for people who hate to make pastry dough. Although I am not among them, I do appreciate a great shortcut. I keep frozen puff on hand for emercencies - when you need something impressive and quick. I offer two variations. Sprinkle 1/2 cup unsalted, shelled pistachios in with the pears before topping with the crust. Or omit the vanilla and the cinnamon and sprinke 2-3 oz of roquefort, crumbled, on the pears before topping. Yum, especialy for those who appreciate cheese more than dessert.

I've never had pear pie. I was really disappointed because it basically tasted like apple pie. I love the idea of using puff pastry for a crust though. I definitely will use that idea again (and again).

Simple, but very nice. My family loved it for Thanksgiving desert. Next time, I'm going to add some brandy soaked raisins.

This is an elegant, unusual and fresh dessert. It's a summertime favorite for company. I serve it with warm brandied custard. Experiment with your choice of pears.....red anjous are lovely! Excellent recipe! Can also be made in individual servings.

I loved this recipe--quick and easy--all the ingredients except the pears in my cupboard. It's light and delicious as you eat it and my quests raved and asked for the recipe. Any more like this???? The puff pastry is a wonderful change to pie crust!!
