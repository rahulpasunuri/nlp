This is a great recipe and a nice light alternative to garlic bread. I used my own pizza dough that did not weigh a pound. I baked it on a perforated nonstick pizza pan. The crust was crispy and so delicious. I didn't use all of the salt and it was plenty salty for us. I baked it about 7 minutes then I sprinkled some parm and romano on it and baked a few more minutes till golden. I served it with Italian bean and pasta soup. A keeper.

I've made this twice, the first time as written, but baked on a pizza stone. I found it a wee bit too salty, maybe because in using my own recipe I used a smaller amount of dough, therefore needing less salt, or maybe because I use parmesan in my dough recipe... whatever, it was a nice alternative to french bread when served with homemade soup for dinner. The second time I used way less salt and added minced garlic and parmesan before baking...very nice and uncomplicated. Everything doesn't have to be fancy to be good.

I'm not sure I understand the problem here. This is a classic recipe. And using fresh or frozen dough? I make my own dough & freeze it for recipes like this. So what's the big deal? Am I to be banished from this site because I don't use a whole dough recipe at one time???

Simple amd good. I make my own dough, but frozen would be okay too. The stuff in the tube is not to my taste, but each to his own. I always appreciate a way to doctor up some convenience foods. It is a great help for busy families and at least it's not fast food. This pizza and some minestrone or antipasta salad make a great, easy supper.

Just had to add my $.02. . .When I met my husband, he was fresh from an internship in Italy, and remembered very fondly the Pizza Bianca he and the other students used to wait anxiously to come out of the ovens at the Forno Campo Fiori in Rome. So wonderful were his memories, that I strived over the years to replicate this dish, coming close several times, but never hitting the mark. Last summer, we travelled to Rome, and he headed straight for the bakery (luckily it hadn't moved) our first morning there. And I realized he hadn't exaggerated this dish's appeal. It was hot, salty and satisfying--it doesn't get much better than that. To say I was excited to see this recipe in your magazine is an understatement--you made our day! My mistake all these years was I added too much to the recipe--this recipe is an illustration of the Thoreau's admonition to "Simplify! Simplify! Simplify! To those who think they have risen so far above their humble beginnings to even consider this recipe, think of it as the little black dress of the cooking world--simple yet elegant!

It is a shame that simple recipes like this generate such strong opinions on this website. The context in which they are offered in the magazine is lost. This recipe accompanies an article on Roman street food and a review of a Roman pizzeria where this pizza is very popular.

Although we cooks often want "gourmet" to mean "fancy" or "complex," it's also nice to be reminded to get back to basics, especially with something like pizza, which we Americans (myself included) love to top with as much stuff as possible. Plus, this recipe taught me a new technique: I never would have known to dissolve the salt in water instead of adding it right to the oil. I'll try that the next time I have extra homemade dough in the freezer.

From Webster's Dictionary: Usage Note: An epicure is much the same as a gourmet, but the word may sometimes carry overtones of excessive refinement. This use of epicure is a misrepresentation of Epicurean philosophy, which, while it professed that pleasure was the highest good, was hardly given to excessive concern with food and drink.

Simple & tasty !You don't need every thing but the kitchen sink for something to be good. For those great chefs out there;from Nanaimo,BC,Montreal,Quebec, & Jennifer. Get with it.You don't like it. Don't eat it. Don't knock Gourmet.Raised Italian, I eat simple food that is great. The chefs I mentioned would call it gourmet. The Cook (Italian) from Montreal is right. Keep up the good work GOURMET.

This is very good, both plain and with minimal toppings. My favorite variation has crumbled blue cheese and pine nuts.

Good grief people! I agree with the others, you obviously didn't take the time to READ the recipe! It says fresh OR frozen dough (not in a tube). Make your own, buy it... I couldn't care less! As for the recipe, it's a great start point! Using my standard pizza dough recipe (the one from Gourmet... on this website), I decided to add about 2 ounces of mozzarella (divided the dough in 2) and a little fresh crushed garlic. Perfect easy Sunday night supper!

When I was a child I used to go to parties at my Lebaneese relatives house where they would serve a very simular version of this. They used to invite a lot of their Greek friends. And, they used to playfully argue with my Aunt that the Greeks were the ones that really invented this simple lttle "pizza". The only difference between the Italian version of this and the one I used to enjoy 40 years ago as a young child were the Middle Eastern spices that they put on top. And, I thought their pizza was just simply wonderful...as I'm sure this one is!

Wow, I'm not really sure how it is that everyone can get so enraged over a traditional Italian recipe. It is what it is (and although I may be a biased Italian, I think it's sublime), if you don't like it, don't make it. I don't think that it's right to criticize Gourmet for publishing this recipe (which some seem to think is a recipe that is inappropriate for "foodies") when this is a food commonly found in Italian kithens...it's not like Gourmet invented it. In addition, I too fancy myself to be a good cook, but that doesn't mean that everything has to be dificult and complex. Quite often, as is the case with a lot of Italian food, simple, fresh foods, cooked well, are best.

Debate about the dough aside, this is simple and delicious. I have also seen it prepared on the BBQ and it disappears very quickly. Just break off pieces of dough and flatten between your palms, place on an oiled BBQ grill and brush with the oil, sprinkle with sea salt and a little herbs de provence or chopped fresh basil, close the BBQ lid to bake for about 3 - 5 minutes and serve up to waiting guests!

Uh... did any of you folks notice that it said fresh OR frozen pizza dough? I'm sure that all you "foodies" have your own wonderful recipe to try with this simple technique.

Australin cooks will not enter the discussion about the mertits of frozen dough as we do not have such a product easily available as far as I know. I will continue to enjoy this site anyway, as I agree wholeheartedly that even gourmet cooks need simple recipes sometimes.

I recently snacked on this in New Zealand with the addition of rock salt and garlic. it was simple and wonderful! although, of course, it could be modified in so many ways. it's a basic recipe to which you can change, just like the marinara sauce you start off with using store-bought tomatoes. just for those of you who are unable to stand the idea of store-bought items, don't gripe about it here. it's a waste of everyone's time. go make your own wine, press your own olive oil and deep-sea fish for your own seabass, then send out invitations to your separate website.

Geesh! there is no reason to be so ...ummm..borish!... If you're having trouble accepting frozen dough, which by the way, I make extra and freeze it so I have some if the Urge hits, ...Make your favorite dough... spread out in a very lightly oiled pan.. brush with olive oil...and anchovies! or... oregano or... veggies and olives or...whatever strikes your fancy! *wonders if the complainers can be creative* hehee* Please, lighten up people..

Shame on anyone who cannot make a simple pizza dough, but would use some commercial product for a basic recipe such as this. Not the quality I would expect from this source.....doesn't compare with double raised Foccacia done the true traditional way. This has been a delicious staple in my home for years, but is not at all healthy..white flour, oil and salt.

What is everyone so upset about? This is just like a thin focaccia! Its also a lovely blank palette for every imaginable topping you can dream up. I sprinkled chive/onion cheese over the top of mine and broiled until brown & bubbly & served with a salad.

relax people, once in awhile it is nice to update your dough recipe. It's fine if we don't get ground breaking recipes each time. This is was a solid Italian staple. love it:)

I can't believe some of the comments above by "gourmet" food snobs. This is a great quick recipe, especially for an impromptu cocktail party. I dusted mine with a little grated parmesan and crushed red peppers for a little more oomph. My guests loved it. Even gourmet cooks like quick, tasty recipes!

this recipe should be renamed pizza blanca since there's nothing on it....this is the most uninspiring recipe i've seen on this site since "boiling salted water". do the epicurious people do this on purpose to enrage foodies ??? I personally won't be runing out to buy frozen pizza dough anytime soon....

This is a ridiculous recipe: FROZEN dough?? FROZEN dough brushed with salt and oil? I find it terribly insulting to even read such a recipe: anyone who enjoys cooking or food does not need to see this! The editors of Gourmet should be embarassed to even publish such a recipe. In the early 80s, as a young adolescent, and then through my teens, I learned to cook, and cook well, by reading (and cooking with) Gourmet. I wondered if the disappointment I feel in the last several years with Gourmet (and Bon Appetit, for that matter) have been because I have become a much better and more creative cook. However, on looking back to the issues I have from the 80s, I see that these earlier publications really are much better. Can we please have recipes for people who love to eat, who love to cook? I subscribe to epicurious to learn new things (and b/c I can't readily buy Gourmet or Bon Appetit where I am living). It is a waste of my time to wait for windows to open on my computer to show me such silly recipes. Can we see more for the die-hard foodies out there?

My grandmother would make something very much like this when I was small. In her Tuscan village, they called it schiaciatta.
