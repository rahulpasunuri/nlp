Love this recipe. I sautéed a pint of grape tomatoes and added the roasted pepper an anchovy sauce to them. It was so good! I will be adding this to my Sunday menus!

Simple and straighforward, everyone thought that this was a solid performer. The sauce went well with the cutlets, and I amped up the anchovy to make that the dominate flavor with the red bell subordinate.

I added 3 tbsp cream to take the edge off of the sauce; I also substituted Spanish piquillo peppers; I had them onhand and they were already roasted. Loved the combo between peppers & anchovies!

Followed everything except I used an orange pepper instead of red. Can't say this was great. It was just ok.

The parts are fine. The pepper sauce has a nice piquancy, and the veal is perfectly cooked by this method. However, the two flavors seemed to cancel each other out. We were not charmed, although we both like veal cutlets, anchovies, and especially roasted peppers.

This dish was absolutely wonderful! Both my husband and I loved it. We used the leftover sauce for crudites.

Tastes just like something my Italian grandmother would have made. I used anchovy paste instead of the fillets. Be careful not to add too much salt, if any.

Terrific...I used jarred peppers so ingredients can be kept on hand and takes about 30 seconds to whip up. This type of dish would cost you big bucks out! A keeper!

This was a quick simple dish to make and quite delicious. I substituted a jar of red peppers for making my own and it worked quite well. I would definitely make this again!
