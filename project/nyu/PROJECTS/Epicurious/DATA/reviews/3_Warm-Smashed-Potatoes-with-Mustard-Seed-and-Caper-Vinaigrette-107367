Wow! I make a ton of recipes from this site and don't rate most of them. This, however, was an exceptional twist on warm potato salad. It pleased all of us (even the 4-year-old!) and was a great accompaniment to simply grilled beef tenderloin--each underscored and enhanced the other. We also served green beans gremolata and chocolate buttermilk pie--what a memorable meal!

This dish is disgusting and tastes like trash - don't waste your time.

Though fun, this reminded me of (warm) mustard potato salad.

This dish is incredible! All of the flavors work together and taste great. I love the idea of eating potatoes without having to add a lot of fattening ingredients. I served them with the roast chicken with lemon tarragon butter - they were devoured, even by my small children. Give it a try!
