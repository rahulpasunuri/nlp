Well any Chef worth his grain of "salt" knows to never add salt to a stock. This stock has so many flaws... Don't do it and do an other research. I'm surprised that such a recipe is on the site...

This stock was awful. Very little to no flavor. Pretty much a waste of a chicken.

I always make a brown chicken stock because the flavor is so much deeper. You can shortcut this by using a deli roasted chicken, but don't forgo the browning of the veges. By the way, it is much easier to deglaze the roasting pan if you remove the chicken the vegetables first.
