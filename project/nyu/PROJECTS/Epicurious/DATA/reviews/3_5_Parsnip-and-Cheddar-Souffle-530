Simple and straightforward. Made it just as directed and wouldn't change it. Making it again tonight.

I found this souffle extremely easy to make. I made some modifications. I used a milder gouda instead of cheddar and I added more parsnip puree than called for in the recipe. I also added some sugar to sweeten it slightly and cut some of the tang of the cheese. It was absolutely delicious, and no problems with rising or falling.

Because I only have a 6-cup souffle dish, I used 4 separated large eggs and added 1 large egg to the base. I used 2 1/2 T butter, 1 T olive oil, 2 oz. cheddar, sprinkled the top with grated Parmesan, and cooked for only 30 min. The cheddar taste still came through, but the parsnip flavor was very muted, even though I lessened the other ingredients. It really was more like eating a mashed potato souffle, which wasn't bad, but I made it because my fiancee loves parsnips.

As a last minute dinner I prepared this dish, but due to the lack of enough parsnip I put half parsnip and half sweet potatoes. The result was delicious and my toddlers devoured it!!!!!

Very easy. I added some coarse grain mustard to the roux, which went well. It is a nice supper dish. I halved the recipe for two of us and baked it in one dish for 40 mins.
