Recipe perfect as is. Have been abe to use the butter for other purposes also. Recipe's a keeper.

Amazing  just awesome, and super- easy. the easiest way: melt the butter to very soft or even liquid in the mircowave, then do the food processor (or even a blender) and freeze it while the salmon cooks (15-20 mins is plenty). then you can easily spread it on the fish. SO good.

I thought this was great. After reading the reviews however, I doubled the amount of all ingredients, and used the amount of butter called for. I thought it was really good this way. It makes a lot of butter, which was great with the rosemary bread and asparagus I served alongside.

A slightly above average salmon dish as far as I am concerned. Took the suggestion to use half the butter and I dotted the butter mixture on the salmon prior to baking (I baked it at 375, not grilled it).

delish! i followed the suggestio of using half the called for butter, and it was still good. even my sick-of-salmon husband was wanting seconds!

Easy and tasty. I used half a stick of butter instead and that let the anchovy/caper/garlic taste come through a bit more...

The butter was fine, but I don't understand all the rave reviews. It was just OK.

very easy, and incredibly delicious! I make this dish time and time again for an easy and quick weekday dinner. The butter can last in the fridge for a long time, so you can make this dish the following week by simlpy broiling the salmon. Very good!

Can you say YUM? This dish is incredibly easy and delicious. I agree with skipping the freezing butter part--I microwaved it on half power for about 20 seconds and it was soft enough to add to the food processor. I put the whipped butter on the salmon, wrapped it in foil, and cooked it for 10-12 minutes at 500 degrees. Easy, very little clean up and DELICIOUS!!!

forget the whole freeze the butter thing. just mash it all together and rub it on the salmon. it turns out just fine, and in no time.

This is a simple but great recipe. I used salmon steak instead of fillet and made 1/3 of the recipe for the sauce. I omitted salt for the sauce since I had already seasoned the fish before broiling - unless you really like it salty!!! Anyway, my husband loves this dish! I would definitely make this dish again.

Right up there!!!

very tasty. i did not follow directions well, though. instead of the whole freezing the butter regime, i just made the butter sauce (used only 4 tblsp), coated the salmon with it, let it marinate, and then baked it. salmon is already fatty; who needs more fat!!

Broiled salmon is broiled salmon...until you add the caper butter. I will watch it more closely next time as it broils. I like it medium and the time provided resulted in well done. This was delicious.

This is a staple in our house, for guests or everynight, our favorite way to prepare salmon; both children and adults love it. The "butter" makes a lot--we call it caper ice cream--so we usually have some on hand in the freezer. Butter proportion can be cut back.

This was incredibly easy to make, you cannot go wrong. It also looks nice on the table when you put the butter in a nice dish. One thing though, I had a lot of butter left over. Next time i will cut the amount by a third. Alternatively, you can use the leftover butter in sandwiches.

Excellent Mediterranean tastes.... Simple to prepare... Think of it as a butter recipe... One caution: I use my mortar and pestle whenever I can, and I used it here. Next time I will use the blender or food processor- Because of the moisture in the ingredients, my butter broke apart...This would not happen if blended...

This is the second time I've made this, and I found this time that for whatever reason, the butter really cooled the salmon down. Maybe because the salmon fillets I used weren't as thick. It' still a wonderful dish.

This was very good, but I would never say it's a dish beyond compare. The salmon is simple to make as is the caper-anchovy butter, but, really, it's a rather plain salmon dish.

This is really delicious and easy. Make the butter up to a week ahead of time and then all you have to do is grill the salmon.

Easy...unbelievable...mouth watering...incredible taste...need I say more! The butter makes a large amount. Next time I will cut the recipe in half and then will have some still leftover. I agree with the previous comments... the butter should be soft or melted before placing it on the fish as it cooles it down to fast

Delicious and easy! I roasted the salmon on top of asparagus. When cooked, i spooned the butter mixture over it. Also, I used cilantro instead of parsley and added some cayenne pepper for additional kick.

This was very, very good. I did not use the butter so made ingredients into a sauce. Excellent! Will make again and again and some...

The butter with this is delicious (although I'd probably add more anchovy next time) and goes really well with the salmon. I think it would go well with lots of other things too. My only problem is that for just 2 servings, 8 minutes overcooked the salmon. But thats easily fixed the next time around. Easy and tasty.

This was a simple, excellent dish. I used it on arctic char, which is similar to salmon but lighter. The only thing I wasn't so keen on was the use of butter--it kind of negates the positive effects of all those good fish fats!

This was a very easy dish to prepare. I added a thin layer to the butter spread to both sides of the salmon prior to broiling and then placed the remaining butter thinly sliced on top. I also added more parsley and a bit of cayenne to the butter to spice it up a bit. very light and tasty.

Le beurre etait excellent. Il est effectivement preferable qu'il soit a la temperature de la piece. Tres facile a faire et il en reste pour la prochaine fois!

This is an easy recipe and excellent. I froze the left-over butter, and have used it to make the dish several more times. One modification: I thought it was easier if the butter was soft, or even melted before applying to the fish.
