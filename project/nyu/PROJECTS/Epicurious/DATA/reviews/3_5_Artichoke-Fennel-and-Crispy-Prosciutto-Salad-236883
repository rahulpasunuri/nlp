Call me a Phillistine, but I make this with marinated artichoke hearts (from a local big box store). I consistently get rave reviews.

While preparing the artichokes is a bit time consuming, this salad looked beautiful in the bowl. The flavors lined up perfectly. Use a mandoline for sure, if you have one, to get really thin slices.

raw artichoke is delicious... Fennel should defintiely be shaved, so get a mandoline. Dressing was average.... IMHO, needs a touch of sweetness, possible from apple cider vinegar and maybe a nut oil instead of olive oil. good, but for the work I'd try a different dressing.

At my dinner party last night, the men said this salad was interesting and different, but barely ate it. However, it was a big hit with the ladies. It was time consuming slicing the artichoke hearts thin as I don't have a mandoline. I substituted baby lettuces from my garden for the frisee. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I thought this recipe called for way too much prosciutto -- 3 ounces would have been enough. The dressing was delicious though. I doubled it for later use. Will make again.
