This is the first time I've made anything with artichoke, and I honestly don't even have that much experience eating it either, so for me it was definitely a distinctly flavored soup - unlike one I've ever had before. I probably won't make it again, b/c as the others said, the labor put into the artichokes, along with the blending & straining, was pretty extensive. I did not make the crostini. Still, it was pretty good and perhaps if I were more familiar with artichokes I would've rated it higher.

I made this with some jumbo chokes I picked up and made the work easier on myself by just steaming the chokes until tender and then scraping the leaves and dicing the heart. I then cooked the dice and scrapings with garlic, leeks, etc. You can also microwave the potatoe for 3-5 minutes and finishing in the pot with the other veggies. Delicious!

This was an easy though fairly labor- intensive dish (the most time spent preparing the artichokes). I made both the soup and the crostini. Both were delicious, and I will definitely make them again. The pesto is so fresh and vibrant, and the soup recipe really lets the artichokes shine!
