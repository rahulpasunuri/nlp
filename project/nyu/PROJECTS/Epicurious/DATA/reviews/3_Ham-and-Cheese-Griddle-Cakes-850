I'm pretty parsimonious with my reviews - but these deserve a strong positive review. I followed the recipe, but was generous with both ham (two medium-thick slides of good deli ham) and blue cheese. Whipping the egg whites is always a good thing for pancakes, but I often skip it. Here I didn't, and I think it definitely was a plus as they cooked up perfectly, simultaneously light and substantial. (Plus, they cooked through in the time it took for the outsides to get golden - unlike many a pancake with extra ingredients.) The taste alone - no syrup - is yummy but they are standard pancake dry. We ate them with maple syrup (the real stuff) but went light on the syrup and it was just right. A big hit.

I altered it a little the second time...used bacon in place of ham. Cooked until crispy about 12 oz of bacon cut into little pieces. Instead of adding butter to mix, used rendered bacon fat in the same quantity. This make some killer pancakes. I'm making them this way all the time, now. Oh, and I use more blue cheese than called for....

This was awful. I made it as written. It sounded so unusual I figured it must be good. But, alas, both my husband and I thought it was terrible.

Well, I would have bet my paycheck that my family would turn up their nose at these, but I had ham to use up and was bored with sandwhiches, so I went for it. My son ate 7 of them and my husband around 6. Guess I won't be heading for Vegas any time soon.

I was making these with what I had in the house, so I used colby-jack instead of blue cheese (and 1 cup instead of 1/3). So I can't give an accurate review of this recipe, but the cakes were light, fluffy and delicious. I think the blue cheese would be excellent, but I can't imagine serving them with maple syrup as specified. Maybe it tastes better than it sounds.
