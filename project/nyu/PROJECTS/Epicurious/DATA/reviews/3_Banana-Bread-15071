I used High Fructose Corn Syrup and white flour and it's not good. (I just googled "what's the difference between HFCS and Fructose?" and found out that they're actually pretty different. Oopsie.) I should've used a different recipe since I didn't have either fructose or whole wheat flour. The bread is pretty close to inedible.

This bread was way too heavy. There are other whole wheat options that are lighter.

This recipe is very forgiving to substitutions. To make a healthier version I substituted the 1/4c. wheat flour with coconut flour, a higher fiber/gluten free choice - also I used xylitol as the sweetener rather then fructose. In liu of margarine I stuck with plain ol butter. When in the tin I lightly drizzled a chocolate sauce on top. The banana bread turned out great - was eaten in less then 10 hours!!!

Great banana bread. I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of fructose, 2 tbs of canola oil instead of margarine and added 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1 tsp of cinnamon. We are eating it now and it may be a bit too moist, next time I will try 1 1/2 cups flour (I used all whole wheat). My kids are asking for seconds, so this one is a big hit. Would like to try with chocolate chips, for a sweet treat.

Simply delicious, especially for a low-fat recipe. Here's what I changed to make it really delicious: as per other reviewers, I used 1/4 c brown sugar instead of fructose; I added 3 T of unsweetened cocoa; I added one peeled and chopped apple for moisture; I used 1 C unbleached white flour and 1/4 cup whole wheat flour; 2 T canola oil instead of margarine. Result is attractive, dense, moist and flavorful way to use overripe bananas. Enjoy!

This recipe was pretty awful. I didn't have fructose so I followed the other's suggestions to use honey, the muffins came out like hockey pucks and the loaf came out like a door stop. I think it was the whole wheat, should have gone half and half. Let it be a lesson, fiber comes at a price.

thought it was great. ALso used sugar instead of fructose--and made it in mini muffin cups instead. the kids loved them!

Came out rather flat and bland for banana bread. I'll be using a different recipe next time.

this recipe was delicious and moist(a must for banana bread). I used brown sugar rather than fructose, melted butter instead of margarine and added 3 tablespoons of cocco powder for a chocolate kick. It didn't last more than a day in my kitchen before it was gone. And it is not as heavy as other recipies that require lots of oil and butter.

Boring and dull. Kind of dry for my expectations of banana bread, too. I would add some spices and half the wheat flour next time.

I've been making this recipe for a few years now and it's a staple in my house. My 3-year-old is a super picky eater and this is one of the things he will eat consitently. I love the fact that it's quick and healthy, the main reasons I make it so much. I have been substituting the fructose for 1/4 cup brown sugar and it turns out just fine for us.

This recipe is amazing. It's quick, easy, and tasty. I did add 1 more banana and didn't add so much butter. I also, added some apples because they were getty mushy. Great results!

Yay! My first four forks rating! I thought this banana bread was fantasic. My new favourite banana bread recipe from now on. Upon doing some research on fructose, a sweet substitute I have not used before, I discovered that while it has as many calories as sugar, its great for cutting calories because it is up to 75% sweeter than table sugar - so you can use much less of it (which makes me understand why some of those cooks who used fructose substitutes found the recipe to be not that sweet).

Rating: 3
YUM! What a GREAT healthful alternative recipe for banana bread that does not sacrifice texture or flavor! Moist, not too heavy (but I used half whole wheat flour and half AP flour), perfectly banana-y and not too sweet. And I used Splenda instead of fructose, by the way. Worked just fine. I added dried cherries to please my two-year-old. A big hit for the kids and adults alike.

fantastic! highly recommend!

So simple and really delicious! Added ground flax seeds and walnuts for extra nutrition. Used an additional banana and a bit more sweetener (Xylitol - a healthy sugar substitute) and put a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. Also used organic Smart Balance rather than margerine. Texure and taste turned out perfect; will definitely make this bread again!

this is a good, healthy banana bread that we'll make again. very easy, too. we added nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice (just a bit) and applesause instead of butter, oh, and equal instead of fructose. it's a flexible kind of bread that way!

I ended up with great banana muffins (didn't have a loaf pan), but modified the recipe a lot. I used 1/3 cup light brown sugar instead of fructose, added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. baking soda. I also added an extra egg to make the batter less dense, used 2 Tbsp. veg. oil instead of the margarine, and 1 1/4 cup white flour. So basically, a totally different (and not quite as healthy) recipe - but it ended up really good! Muffins baked for about 30 mins.

This recipe did not work out for me. It looked good up until I got it out of the oven and then it fell like a pancake. Very dense and not work the "low fat" aspect.

Rating: 3
I was a bit skeptical as the recipe did not include any white flour, however the bread was not heavy. I will definately make this recipe again because I like the strong banana flavor. Also, I used honey instead of sucrose and found the bread had the perfect balance of sweetness.

Had to work with this a little, but now it's my standard banana bread recipe. The first batch was too dense and flat; it was barely sweet enough for me, but not for my daughter. On the second batch I added enough buttermilk to make the batter pourable and doubled the sweetening agent. Voila! Perfect. The recipe's virtues are (a) it doubles or triples easily and (b) you can substitute for almost everything but the bananas. I've used all whole wheat, all white and a mixture, I've used all Splenda, all sugar and a mixture (I've never used fructose), I've used melted margine and I've used corn oil, I've used whatever dairy product is in my fridge to thin the batter - it seems to turn out fine, no matter what, as long as the batter isn't too stiff. One last tip - I use a potato masher to mash and stir; it gets the bananas really integrated into the batter without overmixing.

I like a drier banana bread so thought I would try this recipe. I was disappointed, the whole wheat flour overpowered everything. But,I will try it again with 1/2 white flour.

It was kind of doughy, but still very good. Normally I don't really like banana bread- but this was not bad at all. Would use a smaller pan next time.

I made this recipe this afternoon because I had some bananas that needed using and I was out of white flour. I was afraid that the bread would not be very tasty, but I was pleased. (I had to substitute sugar for the fructose--not a staple in my kitchen!--and butter for the margerine) The bread is nice and moist and light--it wasn't overly dense at all-- and (a bonus for me!) it uses more bananas than most loaves of banana bread. All in all, I think that this is a good whole wheat, low-fat banana bread. It is a different food than the white-flour banana bread, but not a bad substitute!

I HAD a tried and true recipe, but this is way better. Very light, no goo in the middle, more bread like than dense. I used fat free stoneyfields french vanilla yogurt, 1 carton for a double recipe, really moist. I also replaced half the sugar with splenda with no ill results. Next time, I'll replace half the flour with King Arthurs whole wheat. A keeper

I would make this again. Did substitute plain flour for wheat and brown sugar for sucrose. Was very moist and sweet, kids love it.

This bread is delicious. It is just as good as any full fat banana bread I have ever made. I also substituted sugar for the fructose and used lite margarine. I baked it for about an hour and a half at about 300 degrees to ensure that it would be extra moist. Although great alone, it is also good with a few chopped almonds on top.

I make this recipe almost weekly. It's a great morning thing- as well as a good evening desert. Love that it's made with whole wheat flour. I use a cup of sugar rather than the fructose. I use butter instead of margarine. (Although, I was out of butter today and just used cooking oil and it worked well) I also use very over ripe bananas- they're the sweetest. Also use lots of walnuts. Everyone who's tasted it says it's the best. I have to agree.

for healthy bread, this was really good. i substituted the egg with egg substitute, the fructose with splenda, and the corn oil with olive oil. i also added a bit of orange zet. it doesn't rise like regular banana bread, but i think it has really good flavor.

I subsituted light brown sugar for the fructose and vegetable oil for the melted corn oil margarine. For a healthy bread I think it tasted fine, but it was dense from the whole wheat flour and I noticed that it didn't rise much in the oven.

Y'all are ridiculous! You sub ingredients like crazy then say you dont like the recipe. Canyon Ranch is an exclusive health spa! I used Splenda and added pecans and it was fantastic as a no sugar added, healthy loaf. I can bake a better banana bread with white flour, sugar and butter but that isnt the point. DUH!

I used three small bananas, and substituted sugar. It came out dry and tasteless, and the loaf was very small. I think 9 X 5 is too large a pan to use. I won't make it again.

This bread recipe was fantastic! It was right up my alley in regards to healthy eating. I love to experiment and decided to add about 1/2 a cup of diced strawberries and substituted 1/3C honey for the fructos....Delicious!

I think this recipe was great. I don't know why the other reviewers didn't like it. It is a dense bread but full of flavour. I substituted brown sugar for the fructose, and used more like a 1/3 of a cup of it. I baked it for about 50 minutes. It turned out great!

I like my banana bread really moist and sweet-- this was more like a loaf of bread with bananas in it. I won't be trying it again!

I like my banana bread dense, so this is an ideal recipe to me. I use brown sugar in place of fructose and I add fresh blueberries or cranberries. You can play with the density a bit using varying amounts of flour and baking powder. My husband made fun of it when he first saw it, calling it the 'astronaut bread', but he ended up fighting me for the last piece.

I thought this was one of the best banana breads I have ever made! I used 2 mashed bananas and added 1 c. of white chocolate chips. It was wonderful. I also used white sugar, light butter and egg substitute. I will definitely be making this one again.

Rating: 3
I chose this recipe because it was very simple and used more bananas than any of the other ones I looked at. I also substituted sugar for fructose, white flour for wheat, and butter for vegetable oil since I wasn't concerned about the nutritional value of the bread, only the flavor. The bread was delicious! Next time I'm going to add nuts and chocolate chips.

I made this recipie using Sucranat instead of fructose. I don't know if that is what caused it to be so dry and sponge-like, but I like dense banana breads. I will try another recipie as this one didn't float my boat.

Yuck! Even after taking the advice of other recipe raters and beating the egg-banana-fructose mixture a bit longer, and even giving it an extra 15 minutes in the oven, this bread still turned into a soggy lump! Not to waste my effort, I tossed it out into the backyard for the animals to feast on. The birds and squirrels won't even touch it! Never again!

Rating: 4
I tried this only because I had some bananas going bad. I found it easy to make (compared to the yeast breads I usually make) and very tasty. I think the key to keeping it from being too heavy is to beat the eggs very well to ensure there is lots of air mixed in. Mine was not too heavy at all, I just let the mixer go while I watched football (yes, I know, a strange combination) letting the egg misture get very stiff. I don't have fructose so had to use white sugar but that didn't seem to hurt anything.

This was a VERY good bananna bread. I don't know what everyone else is complaining about. Just add an extra pinch of salt and walnuts, and you've got a perfect breakfast, dessert or teatime treat!

Very good banana bread...I upped the amount of banana and it worked even better. Just the right amount of density and yet still bread like. It wasn't too heavy.

This bread was good. We ate the whole loaf happily. It is great for those of us with low blood sugar or diabetes because it it made with fructose --not white sugar. It it not too sweet, so sugar fanatics will not love it. I will not make it again because I prefer the banana bread recipe from the Fannie Farmer Cookbook. Maybe next time I'll substitute some whole wheat flour in the Fannier Farmer recipe.

Slightly too heavy.
