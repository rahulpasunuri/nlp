Delicious and great for impressing people! I peeled my asparagus, used vermouth as my white wine, and used baldo rice. And really good parmigiano reggiano. Used veg broth instead of chicken broth. Look forward to making again!

One of my favorite risottos! I have made this many times for both family and friends and everyone always loves it. It does take a little time, but it is worth it for the taste. I use vegetable broth rather than chicken to make it a completely veggie dish and, while the color is a little darker, the added flavor I feel it gives more than makes up for that. This is a dish I will be making again and again!

Excellent! Served it to a group of sophisticated foodies, and they all raved. Used really thin asparagus, cut about 1"; perhaps a little more than called for; otherwise made exactly as written.

This is a keeper! Read alot of the reviews and followed it closely but added a pinch of thyme to the rice in the first step and zest with the last ladle full as well as the juice of a small lemon. Only had regular mushrooms but the result was still very good. I will make this again and again. Yes it makes alot but the leftovers are worth it. I do think my asparagus pieces were a little larger than indicated, closer to 1/2 inch. Worked out well for me. I also added a little more cheese, not much but certainly a heaping 1/2 cup at the end. Yummm. Enjoy.

I've tried a few highly rated risotto recipes on this site and this one is definitely my favorite.

Very good. Does take longer than 20 minutes -- but worth it. Cut asparagus into 1/2", not 1/4" and cook for no longer than 2 minutes. Loved the suggestion of adding parmesan ends (you know, that little hard piece in the back of your cheese drawer) to the broth. Don't understand those people who had tons left over. I guess we eat a lot -- we'll be arm-wrestling to see who gets the last serving for lunch tomorrow...

Very good recipe. I used all chicken broth and 8 ounces of cremini/4 ounces shiitakes. I made the asparagus, mushrooms and onion 1 day ahead. This recipe would serve 6 to 8 easily as a side.

Rating: 4
Absolutely fantastic! Really quite simple to make...& we'd make this again in a heartbeat. We mixed portabellas & shiitakes (b/c of a lack of shiitakes) & it still worked out really well. This is a hit!

So one day I thought to myself, "I'd really like to be good at making risotto. I'll start with this recipe, and hopefully someday, I'll be a risotto whiz." This recipe is perfect. The only slight drawback is that there are never any leftovers, because it's THAT good. Seriously, do yourself a favor, and make this dish tonight!

Great recipe. As per other reviewer's suggestions, I added a bit of fresh thyme and a small squeeze of fresh lemon juice - it was fantastic! Also, I was making it for company so I parboiled the rice and cooked the asparagus and mushrooms hours before, refrigerated everything, and then just finished it off when my guests arrived. It still worked perfectly!

The flavors are incredible. I did use brown arborio and regular white mushrooms,and added thyme to the rice. Oh yes, and a tiny stream of milk to make it a little creamier. Wow.

Restaurant quality!! Takes about 35 minutes of stirring before the rice is soft. Awesome.

This was tasty, but not great. Definitely needs plenty of seasoning. I would add lemon zest, more pepper and more cheese next time. Definitely takes longer than 20 minutes. With prep time, more like an hour.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely fantastic. I have tried to make risotto before without the super creamy restaurant quality results. This one delivers. I did omit the shiitake mushrooms but kept everything else exactly as written. It was truly superb. I would recommend this for company but the nature of risotto makes it quite difficult. It would be perfect for family get togethers and informal guests. Use a small bunch of asparagus or else they will take over the whole dish... or simply use a few and save the rest for later. Wonderful stuff!

I've been looking for a risotto recipe that would win my husband's taste buds over and this recipe was the one! I did use shallots instead of the onion, used Swanson's cooking stock and eliminated the water. The flavor was outstanding! Somewhat time consuming, though, but definitely worth it.

This was truly fabulous. I didn't change a thing in this recipe (very unusual for me!) and it was great! Will definitely make again, and again...

Great recipe! It was the first time I had attempted risotto, and it came out fantastic. Don't underestimate the amount of time it will take to get the rice to the correct consistency...it's a lot of stirring! But definitely worth it.

Delish! Made exactly as written and have no alterations to suggest, other than saying that the salt and pepper really should be mandatory not optional. The combination of asparagus and shiitake is perfect. I would not used reconstituted dried shiitakes for this recipe though: got to go fresh.

Rating: 3
I've made this once before and I don't know what magic arborio Gourmet was using my mine took three times as long to cook completely. A professional chef friend of mine suggested cooking the arborio longer after the onion and then fully covering the rice with broth in the first addition, letting that boil down, and then adding a three-quarter to a cup of broth each time after that. I will try that next time. Otherwise, very good. I added prawns and scallops to the top when plating it.

Outstanding....the key to this recipe is prepping everything before hand....then it is simple...delicious!

This is really good. I am veg so I used about 4 cups veg broth and about 2 cups water that I boiled with the ends of the parm reg. Also, I had fresh spinach and didn't use asparagus, this being the end of summer. I stirred the spinach in at the very end just before turning off the heat as the spinach gives off a lot of liquid. A bonus: we had amazing just picked shiitakes from a grower friend!! mmm...

3 1/2 forks - this was really yummy, I added the thyme and lemon per previous suggestions, worked great. I made it for a pot-luck dinner, everyone loved it. However, I made it the night before and the texture was lacking, I would make it right before serving next time.

I probably shouldn't comment, because I didn't have the shittakes and used some chopped ham fried up in the butter, but did everything else exactly and thought the recipe was just great. Great taste, consistency, easy, etc.

Good dinner. Didn't need quite so much of the asparagus and shiitake. Used shallots instead of onion. Could have used Thyme as others suggested. I bought some, then forgot to add it and it was still okay. Served with skewer of grilled prawns and spinach salad.

6 cups chicken broth, one cup water, 30 minutes stirring time. Took reviewers advice and chopped veggies a day ahead of time. First time risotto for me, and thought it was creamy and comforting. Added zuchini, basil, and garlic. Delicious!

This is FABULOUS! It was my first time making risotto, and my husband called it my "best meal ever!" Sooo good! I used half shitake and half crimini mushrooms, and ended up using more chicken broth than called for...

Really delicious. I didn't have enough mushrooms as called for, but I added a handful of roasted walnuts chopped and they gave it the most wonderful texture and taste. I had not made risotto before; this recipe talks you through it and was very easy to follow.

Absolutely wonderful. Will make again and again. This was my first risotto, and I followed the recipe closely. Found it to have just the right amount of liquid. My only change was having to use regular white mushrooms; will use a mixture, including shitake, next time. A sinfully delicious meal. Can't wait for next time!

This was my first attempt at making risotto, and it was fantastic. I wanted it to be the main course, so I added some pieces of grilled chicken. Just sublime. I marinate chicken before grilling in olive oil, lemon juice, chunks of garlic and plenty of kosher salt. In these days of bland chicken breast I find doing so makes chicken taste more like chicken. Anyway, after grilling the breasts, I cut the chicken into small pieces and stir it in with the asparagus and mushrooms. It added a delicious hint of smoked flavor to the overall dish. The recipe was so good, I'm sure it would be great as a side dish with just the vegetables.

This was my first tiem cooking risotto, and it was fantastic. When I tried a bite without the asparagus it was too heavy and creamy, but paired with the asparagus the flavor was incredible, absolutely perfect. I'm not much of a cook, and this recipe was easy and turned out great.

This dish is amazing, i will absolutely be making it again. I grilled pork chops made with a spice rub to serve alongside the rissotto. It was a hit among my dinner guests.

I made this for valentines day dinner and it was a real hit. I used corn instead of asparagus, shallot instead of onion, and used only 1/2 pound of mushrooms which I think was more than enough.

So rich and warm and earthy. Delicious! I used 4 cups vegetable broth + 1 cup vegetable stock to replace the chicken broth (to make it vegetarian), and it was still amazing. The only problem? 3/4 lb of shitakes is way expensive, dudes.

I used frozen asparagus and frozen mixed mushrooms that I cooked in chicken broth. Also, I didn't have onion, so I threw in a finely minced clove of garlic in the early part of the cooking. Delicious. One of the best risottos I've made.

Rating: 3
fantastic - easy to make, and relatively inexpensive for this recent college grad. just make sure to STICK WTIH SHIITAKE. i couldn't find enough shiitake, so used some portabello, and it just wasn't the same. the ooonly thing wrong with it as a main course is, like many risottos, it is a bit bland... i would recommend adding a bit of thyme and a squeeze of lemon... the lemon cuts a lot of the heaviness and makes it a perfect summer dinner... or 5 dinners, in my case

Made this recipe last night, just the way it is written and it was AMAZING! This was the first time I made risotto, so I made sure I had all the ingredients ready to go before I started and it was a huge success. Can't wait to make it again and neither can my husband, he LOVED it. It was great leftover for lunch as well!!!

Rating: 4
Very easy to make and delicious. I used the suggestion below about adding garlic. I also wanted another layer of flavor, so I added grated Romano cheese and juice from one lemon. A whole lemon, especially a very juicy one was a little too much so I think next time I will add just half a lemon. Great dish. Will make again.

This was simple to make, and very good with fresh spring asparagus. I unforntunately didn't have any good wine in the house, or enough mushrooms- I'm sure it would have been better. I added fresh thyme to the mushrooms, as another reviewer suggested.

I used the suggestions to add garlic (sauteed it w/mushrooms) and used fresh shitake and dried porcini mushrooms. It was fantastic and the guests I had are still raving about it! I will make it again, and again!

Easy and straightforward - The addition of parsley at the end brightens it and adds a nice texture contrast. I also added some fresh thyme with the wine. If you have leftovers, fried risotto cakes are a nice side to steak or fish.

Delicious risotto. I made some modifications, based on what I had on hand. Used leeks instead of onions and salted butter instead of unsalted. No matter. It was delicious and will add it to my favorites.

Rating: 4
I improved this dish by using a mixture a fresh and dried shiitake mushrooms. I used the soaking liquid from the mushrooms in place of the water, adding another layer of flavor to the dish. I find the flavor of dried shiitakes much more intense then the fresh, but the mix of the two provided the right buttery texture combined with a powerful punch of flavor.

so far the only epicurious recipe that doesn't require modification.

An excellent risotto. I had to use vegetable broth instead of chicken ... vegetarians - screwin' up my risotto. Then they wonder why I'm giving it 4 forks. MAYBE IF I USED CHICKEN BROTH IT WOULD BE 4 FORKS. Now she's whispering something in my ear like a vegetarian knows ANYTHING about food. Ugh! MAKE THIS RISOTTO, YOU'LL LOVE IT!

Rating: 3
I think I am more impressed with how easy this is than the dish itself. I was reluctant after my last attempt at a Risotto a few years ago - the rice took over an hour to soften. Lesson learned - Be careful not to turn the heat up too high or the liquid will evaporate before the rice absorbs it. Can't wait to try it again. Next time will cook the mushrooms with pancetta.

I really enjoyed the recipe and would definitely make it again. However, I did make a few changes. I halved the recipe, but not the asparagus as I omitted the mushrooms.

Fantastic! I often make risotto for guests, and ALWAYS use this recipe for the outline, substituting mushroom types (portobella, wild, or button), forgetting the asparagus when it's out of season, or sometimes adding butter early on for a little bit more flavor. This risotto recipe cuts no corners, and it is well worth it! I love it.

I modified the recipe based on personal taste/what was lying around, but it was still great. For example, I used shallots instead of onions, regular instead of shitake mushrooms, and the cheese was romano and not as finely grated as the reciped called for. None of those things affected the recipe for the worse. Most importantly, I used orzo instead of arborio rice, and cooked it according to the recipe. It turned out great. This is a slightly time intensive recipe, but not difficult, and well worth it.

Oh, this is so good. We used vegetable broth, just because we tend to like it better, and it was incredible. Don't be fooled by the comment from the editors that this is a quick dish, though. Just the prep work takes some time. But once it comes together, it really doesn't take much effort. Just fantastic!
