I thought adding a slab of bacony butter to an already fatty cut of meat would be gilding the lily, but it was just WAY too rich. I didn't like the combination of molasses and bacon in this context either, it just didn't work for me.

Great meal that is very easy. Less butter, more bacon and it's perfect. I used New York Steaks and they worked well.

Delicious! I followed the recipe. I didn't have a problem with the bacon burning.

Excellent and easy. We used both ribeye and tenderloin steaks. While I'm partial to ribeye, the rest of my extended family preferred it with the tenderloin. It was also great the next day sliced on a focaccia roll with Tillamook cheddar!

A family favorite and good enough for guests for a casual barbeque. I follow the recipe exactly - everyone chooses how much of the butter mixture they want on their steak, so it's just right.

Good recipie for a quick and easy night. I took the advice of the other reviewers and cut down on the amount of butter used. I also wanted to make the steaks on the grill so I mixed the butter with the molasses and spread just enough to coat lightly when the steaks were finished. I also cooked the bacon separately, crumbled it and mixed it with just a bit of the molasses to sprinkle on top. Wouldn't make it for company but my steak-loving husband thought it was very good.

Yummy! I did as other reviewers suggested and partially cooked the bacon in a skillet, drained off the fat and then followed the recipe. The butter was very flavorful. Mine melted because I accidentally added the bacon to the butter before allowing the bacon to cool. But, I chilled it back down and thought it still turned out great. The success of this recipe also depends on the quality of the steak as no butter can overcome poor quality.

This was ok for a family dinner, but not up to my standards for a dinner party. The butter is greasy. I cut it down to 1/2 in anticipation and it wasn't overly greasy. We have a gas grill so I used liquid smoke for flavoring the steaks

My husband and I absolutely loved this dish. I used T-bones as they were on special. I also cooked the bacon first in a pan until just done enough. The followed the baking steps with molasses. Worked perfectly and eliminated the extra grease that can come from baking bacon. Yum!

I agree with the last reviewer. It sounds good but it's just OK and greasy.

Followed the directions exactly. We thought that the butter dressing made the steak too greasy. The hickory smoke did add a lot of flavor to the meat. That we will do again.

After reading other comments about the bacon burning in the oven, I chopped mine first and then I cooked it over low heat in a cast iron skillet on the stove. It turned out very well because my wife gave it her approval (she bought steak sauce, just in case, but didn't use it). This was good eats!

We used rib-eye steaks and the bacon molasses butter was a very nice touch. What great flavor the butter added! We seasoned the steaks with only the butter, and they didn't need antyhing else. Watch the bacon though as two stips got a little to dark.

I agree with the previous reviewer. The butter is a nice touch. 2 of my bacon slices did burn in the oven. The glaze becomes so dark it's hard to tell if they are cooked properly. Good recipe.

This butter adds a great flavor to any steak. I used thick strip steaks and apple wood chips instead of hickory. Very nice.
