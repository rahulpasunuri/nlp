Tasty, but half the sauce recipe is still too much quantity. We prepare the sauce as a side for dipping.

These were a hit when I brought them to a family party to watch a football game. I did modify slightly because it is winter and I didn't have a grill available. I used about an inch of vegetable oil and pan fried them after coating them with the rub. I also added a little honey to the sauce to add a little sweetness. Will have again!

Ok, as a born and raised Calgary gal, i can't let that last review stand. Budweiser and Coors are AMERICAN beers. How about Molson Canadian, Labatts, or one of the beers from Big Rock?

Pretty good! Wheat beer is strictly for westerners though - use regular Canadian beer, like Budweiser or Coors.

Very good. Marinated the wings for 26 hours and thought the beer flavor came through quite well. I will make the sauce a little thicker next time. I will also add a little garlic to the sauce for a more complex flavor.

Made these for a Super Bowl party, and they were a big hit. I liked these better than the traditional wings that I've made for the past few years. I agree with other reviewers though that the flavor of the beer didn't really come through. Other than that, though, these were great.

Fantastic flavor! To make this less spicy so my kids will eat it, I often skip the hot sauce and only use the beer and the rub. I've also used this rub for whole chickens (under the skin), and it's incredibly flavorful.

Great but VERY MESSY. Everyone in my family loved the taste especially my ten year old. Used our local brewery's wheat beer (Paper City Brewery Cabot Street Wheat, marinated for almost 24 hours and could really taste it.

Wow - spicy and yum. The sweet chili sauce is a good recomendation.

Used Capital Kloster-Weizen and DID taste the beer unlike the other reviewers. The taste did not last long though, as the sauce was pretty hot!! We enjoyed these wings and will make them again.

First off, I agree with the other reviewer, I too marinated the wings for 24 hours and only recieved the very slightest hint of the beer. Secondly, the sauce ended up tasted too much like regular buffalo wing sauce- the chili sauce did add a nice hint though. I could see myself using the sauce recipe again, but the wings were extremely average.

Yum! We improvised the sauce with what was in our fridge: about 1/4 cup sambal oelek, 1/4 tabasco, and 1/2 cup ketchup. It had just enough kick and stopped short of burning pain. 1/2 c Tabasco would be too vinegary for me. We used a grill pan, 6 minutes per side, and the wings came out nicely browned. Definitely go with the parsley. Couldn't taste the beer flavour, though we marinated for 24 hours.
