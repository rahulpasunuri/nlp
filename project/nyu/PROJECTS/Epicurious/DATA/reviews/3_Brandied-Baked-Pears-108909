My guests and I loved these pears. The only change I would make next time would be to add a dash of vanilla extract to the cream.

We used Calvados for the brandy. Great flavor!

Simple and a crowd pleaser- I'm sure the brandy and butter helped. I brought this to a pot luck and several people liked it. I thought the pears and or cream could use a little spice: nutmeg, allspice, cardamom, or vanilla-something - I dont know what would work well w brandy, but I think some assistance is needed. I think I'll do it again- everyone else liked it...

Since my family is not like cream - unless its whipped, I omitted it and just added another tablespoon of butter to make this dish extra special. It was delicious! It was a very simple dessert to make.

I made this for a dinner party. Very good and better than other recipes I've had with pears in wine sauce. The cream got a bit runny on the pears but mixed well with the syrup. Definately a hit!

Very quick and elegant. I serve with blue cheese and candied walnuts.

A terrific dessert -- easy and elegant! Do keep an eye on the pears. Mine were done in just 20 minutes.
