I basically felt this was disgusting. It's very pretty especially with the sugared cranberries, but it's really sweet and tastes primarily like grappa which I had never had before making this and evidently don't like. Maybe with a different alcohol it would be worth trying again although that wouldn't solve the sweetness problem.

I was very intrigued by this recipe. Turned out beautifully, but wow! The floral flavor from the Moscato grappa was overwhelming....was like eating a candle. There were those who did enjoy it, but next time, I'll try a different grappa....or even make it without it.

This was wonderful. I used Cavatappi Grappa by Clear Creek Distillery. I will make it again. Thank you!

I have made this three years in a row, and cannot imagine Thanksgiving without it. As for which type of grappa to use, I usually pick one that is likely to be more florally fragant (I'm using Moscato this year) to play against the fruity scent of the cranberry. Flavor-wise, I don't think it will make that much of a difference. The cranberry dominates, while the grappa just serves to give it a great balance. I also love the texture of this jelly -- and if you take the extra time to make the sugar coated safe leaves and cranberries, it's so very elegant!

This was wonderful and unmolded beautifully from the tupperware ring mold I put it in. But because I was worried about it being too alcoholic, I replaced some of the grappa with sparkling cranberry juice. Actually, I don't recommend this, as it caused it to come out a bit too sweet.

pup212 - Grappa by itself is definitely an acquired taste - but sip it with an slightly sweetened espresso after dinner and ahhhhh... delightful! I'm definitely going to try this recipe at Christmas-time.

I have yet to make this recipe, but I've a question for those who have: please share the type of grappa you used! I adore grappa (yes, grappa-lovers do exist), :) but there are many different kinds and qualities and I'm undecided about which to choose for this recipe.

This jelly was beautiful and delicious. I made it for Thanksgiving - the kids loved the sugared cranberries. I have to admit I felt like I was doing a jelly shot when I ate it. A nice change from typical cranberry jellies. I will have to make it again and again just to finish the bottle of Grappa! I certainly won't be drinking the stuff!

I've always been more a fan of cranberry jellies than just plain cranberry sauce, so I decided to give this one a try. The grappa was surprisingly easy to find at the upscale grocery store near my house. I tried some grappa itself and I had some misgivings about this recipie. Let me be clear, plain grappa is terrible. But when all is said and done, this dish is divine. The astringent qualities of the grappa are almost unrecognizable and the savory qualities really come through. Leaving a primarily tart and savory jelly with just a hint of sweetness. This may have just become my favorite cranberry recipie of all time.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and it was fantastic (much to my surprise since it's made with grappa). It came out with a cranberry tea flavor. Goes beautifully with the Sugared Cranberries and Sage Leaves.

Easy to make and a wonderful depth of flavor. The grainy taste of grappa is totally enveloped by the cranberries. People who never cared for cranberries sauce of any kind in our house thought this was wonderful. I used a few dried cranberries as garnish instead of the sugared berries. Try it!

We made this for Thanksgiving and LOVED IT!!! Also it was perfect for turkey sandwiches the next day, just a little slice off. YUM!!!

This recipe made me a little nervous because of the grappa. But it was turned out delicious! I wouldn't change a thing. And it looked fabulously festive with the sugared cranberries & sage leaves. Making it for Christmas...

I brought this to a thanksgiving dinner and it was a rave. There were no leftovers, which is a first for cranberry sauce in my experience. It does require the use of many pots and pans, but it is worth it! The grappa flavor is wonderful.
