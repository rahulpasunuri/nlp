Made for a weeknight dinner to serve with roast duck. It was a big hit. My pantry forced a few substitutions: drained, canned plums instead of fresh; 1/4 t. five spice instead of star anise; and rice wine instead of cider vinegar. Because of my plum substitution, I also omitted the sugar and reduced the cooking time a bit.

To Bob from Utah, I agreed with your review exactly while the sauce was cooking, the smell was awful!!! However after simmering long enough to acheive the great thick sauce and adding the vinegar, it smelled better and by the time I put it on my fish for baking, it was great!! Give it another chance, you might like. My husband who was raised on Asian food thought it was the greatest. I had enough sauce left over to use for sauce on some chops tomorrow night. We'll definitely make this again.

i made this for an exceptionally picker eater who thought it was as delicious as i did. i poured it over a large salmon fillet and baked it for 20 minutes. if you do this, i recomend putting the scallions on top of the dish just before serving, rather than before baking.

This is a fabulous thing to do with over-ripe plums. I use this sauce like the plum sauce one would get in the market. I replaced the star anise with 5-spice powder (about a teaspoon) and I used Sake in place of the water and vinegar. Also less Hoisin and more sugar, depending on the plum. But it's all a matter of taste and what's in your kitchen. I served it with an Asian roasted chicken, julliened cucumber and green onion, and tortillas brushed w/ sesame oil (heated of course). Simple and fabulous. I also strained it. Contrary to what BOB in Utah says, I think THE SMELL IS AWESOME. BOB, you really need to know what you like before you start cooking.

The smell made me sick every time I went into the kitchen, and the taste was equally frightening. Don't waste your time!

Sorry...I haven't made it yet. I was wondering if you had it rated by others.
