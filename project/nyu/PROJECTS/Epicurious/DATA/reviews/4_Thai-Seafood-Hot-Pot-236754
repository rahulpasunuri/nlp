Hey Stephmartin, I totally agree with about the review by livetoeat, some people are so pretentious, let them go out and order, I would rather make these dishes myself, you get a lot of satisfaction when you do it yourself. I bet they have never been to Thailand, so how do they know what a real Thai dish tastes like. My hat goes off to you.

Hey livetoeat08...do you guys ever get tired? This is such a great site and this recipe is obviously well rated. I really dislike the presumptuous attitudes and "trained" palates such as yours. People like to recreate dishes at home not go out to order them. You obviously thought so yourself. You are boring!

To make it taste more authentic Thai, I added a few kaffir lime leaves. I also used regular white mushrooms instead of the shiitakes, which were fine though not as authentic. Quite delicious and filling.

This gets two forks because it's not bad but it's not Thai. Yes it has coconut milk and lemongrass but Thai food has more complex flavors. If your guests never eat Thai food or have untrained tastebuds, you could pass this off as Thai. If you eat Thai food on a regular basis, save yourself the money and time and just order out.

Will be making this again. Omitted calamari, and like other reviewers, didn't bother removing the garlic. Next time, will add some ginger. Used reconstituted dried mushrooms, and also added the liquid they'd soaked in to the soup. Made it with two Thai chiles, then had a little dish on hand with more sliced chiles so the spice-lovers could add more - so good.

I just made this for the second time. It is really delicious! I used a full can of regular coconut milk, added about a tablespoon of ginger, fresh mushrooms. Last time I used fresh shitakes and it was better. I also didn't bother to strain the shallots and garlic. Really a first rate meal with authentic flavors!

WOW IS RIGHT! Better than eating at a Thai restaurant - fresh, spicy (but not overpowering), we all loved it and will definitely make this one again. We didn't have rice stick noodles and found a Japanese thin noodle instead. We skipped the lemongrass (just didn't have it on hand), added lime juice because we didn't have enough limes. Sooo yummy. If you like cilantro and lime and seafood and a little spice - TRY THIS RECIPE!! One SUGGESTION - read the full recipe in advance - we wasted time carefully chopping some ingredients that were simply strained out later.

WOW! A Thai restaurant dish - served in my own kitchen! This was fantastic! Flavorful, hot, and tasting authentic Thai. Super easy to make. I didn't have any shallots or lemon grass on hand but substituted onion and lemon zest, respectively. Easy to make, delicious! Will definitely make again.

I don't know what went wrong with some of you, but this was truly an amazing dish! So many flavors! I followed it exactly (except I used only 1 Thai chile... kids can't take too much heat) and even my boys loved it. I can't wait to make it for company. You have to LOVE the flavors of Thai cuisine though. I can't express how simple this dish was. I know it calls for a lot of ingredients, but if you prep first, it's really quite simple. Sooooo very delicious!

I'm missing something, it sounds wonderful, it's expensive, well plotted, intriguing and... it tastes awful. If I make this again, my family will plot to kill me. It could be saved if you ixnay the lime but there are so many really good ways to make a seafood stew, why bother.

Absolutely terrific! I used double the amount of garlic, finely chopped up, and sauteed with the onion and shallots (wouldn't bother to include shallots next time). Added about 1/3 cup each of finely-chopped cilantro and basil, as well as eight white mushrooms, sliced, to the other stock-related ingredients. (Seemed a shame to use canned mushrooms.) 1/2 of a serrano chile, very finely minced, gave just enough heat. I used about 50% more fish sauce and lime juice, and omitted the calamari (but didn't miss them). Because virtually everything can be readied in advance, this will be a great dish to cook, in less than minutes, for company.

I made this exactly as shown. It was an interesting flavour but not particularly wonderful. If I were to make this again, I'd use half the rice vinegar and I'd forgo the lime. I know, why cook Thai if I'd do that right?

Okay, we cheated and used non-light coconut milk, but this was REALLY good. Other than that one detail, I pretty much followed the recipe, with the exception of using eggplant instead of mushrooms since that was what I had on hand. Delicious.

De-licious I love the thickness coconut milk adds to the broth. I like it hot though so I used a couple extra chilies. YUM!

OMG!! YUM!!! This is a keeper FOR SURE! I only used one hot red chili pepper and it was hot enough for me.... my husband... says it could have been hotter! A new favorite... Fresh and Yummy!!

OMG! This was an incredible dish. It was not all that complicated to prepare and the wow factor was stunning. Only used one pepper (couldn't get our hands on thai chili peppers).

This soup definitely tastes like Tom Yum soup at a Thai restaurant. It was incredibly easy to make and absolutely wonderful to eat. I would highly recommend this to anyone!

Very easy and pretty quick to prepare. It tastes very similar to a soup served at our favorite local Thai place.

We made this recipe as written except that we used fish balls (fish meatballs) instead of scallops. They held up well and added a nice texture to the dish. We also included Thai eggplant which went really well with the broth. This is a very nice recipe.

A very yummy dish. It was a winner with flavor and for a romantic evening. I increased the seafood, I put the whole can of mushrooms in (what was I going to do with the other half a can?) And I put a whole can of the coconut milk in. Also, more basil, please.
