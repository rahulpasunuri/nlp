I cooked everything in a skillet rather than on the grill and it came out great. I do suggest serving it with salsa or hot sauce or something. I served mine with the Classic Andalusian Gazpacho from this site, dunking the quesadillas in the gazpacho a la grilled cheese and tomato soup, but the summertime Southwestern version. It was a great meal! Only qualm is that I'd use more cheese next time.

This is so easy to make and I always get asked for the recipe. With the changes I have incorporated, I am not eaxactly rating the recipe as written, but it was the inspiration for the quesadillas as follows......I use Gruyere, I didn't add the coriander and I brush the tortillas with bourmet BBQ sauce before filling. YUM!

they had a great spice that wasn't overbearing

This is a great recipe. It was fast and easy and tasted wonderful. But it really needs a bit of salsa. We added Rick Bayless' Frontera Chipolte Salsa which was terrific. We'll make it again!

This dish is great, it has a little bit and goes well with the Garlic Skirt Steak. I will be using this receipt with my own twist often.

Great dish. Grilled the onions using a grill pan and skipped oiling the tortillas (to cut down on fat). None of my guests seemed to mind! Cooked the quesadillas on a pan and they came out beautifully!
