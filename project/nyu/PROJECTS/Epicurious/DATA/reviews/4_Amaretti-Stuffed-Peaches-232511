I tried this out based on the reviews and was shocked at how awesome it was. I would definitely recommend this as a great summer dessert that is easy and surprisingly exceptional. It is kind of like having a amaretti cookie baked inside of a peach. I'm currently plotting how I can make it again soon!

I love that you don't have to peel the peaches. Quick, easy and delish! My friend left our dinner party with the recipe and emailed me a short while after to tell me she whipped it up, again to rave reviews.

A simply "peachy" dessert. I used quality ginger cookies instead and served it with vanilla bean ice cream. It was delightful, and I received rave reviews from my guests. Fresh, sweet peaches are key.

Wonderful, fresh, light dessert. Served with vanilla gelato. It was a big hit.

I served this with sweetened mascarpone cheese Added some nutmeg and vanilla to the filling. I will make this again (I'm debating doing it right now!) Wonderful, simple cold weather (which is almost year round here) desert.

I love this dessert, and will definitely try it with pears in the fall. The first time I made it I used amaretti cookies from an Italian market, but in a pinch this time I'm using vanilla wafers spiked with some almond extract (add a little at a time and taste, a little goes a long way), with some whole almonds and 1-2 tbsp butter added to the mixture and all pulsed together in my mini-food processor. It's so easy and quick. I prefer the amaretti cookies but I think this will work out just fine.

I made this a few months ago to take to a friend's dinner party and we're still talking about it. I have a fresh crop of delicious SC peaches that deserve to be made in this way. Wonderful and oh so easy.

Sweet lamb of Jesus- I think my eyes are still rolled back into my head! Absolutely OUTSTANDING! Possibly one of the very best recipes in my 4+ years on this website- for out-of-this-world results, go to a farmers market and buy juicy, exploding peaches that are in season and you can't go wrong. There would be little point in making this recipe with imported, flabby, winter supermarket fruit.

Even my picky in-laws raved and wanted more--and I forgot to serve it with the mascarpone. So simple to make, too.

This was unbelievably good and easy to make. It's a good alternative for a pie or something more complicated. The second time I made it, I made it with gingersnaps, which was pretty good. Amaretti are worth finding, though!

This is delicious and easy, I used nectarines because peaches are not reliable in this area - bland fruit would have made this very disappointing. In any case, the Amaretti was a perfect match for the fruit and I'll make this again.

A lovely and easy way to make peaches. I also used nectarines and they cooked up in the same time as the peaches. If you can't find amaretti, I think you could probably use biscotti, although try to get one with a distinct flavor. The flavor of the amaretti was a great complement to the fruit, but it was surprisingly hard to find. The boyfriend loved them... he almost refused to take them for dinner at his parents because he wanted to hoard them.
