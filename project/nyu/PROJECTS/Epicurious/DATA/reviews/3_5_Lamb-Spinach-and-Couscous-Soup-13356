This was just OK to me. I used my left over leg of lamb to make the broth and followed others suggestions by only using 4 cups broth and 4 cups water. I had lots of lamb left over so i cut that up and added that. Everything else I followed pretty closely. After adding the couscous, I didn't feel like there was enough, and ended up tripling the amount. When i asked my husband if it was too much couscous, he said no...and i didn't think so either. But in the end, there just wasn't huge flavor. Next time I'll find a different recipe for my left over leg of lamb.

4 quarts of water? No 2 quarts will do. I used 1 cup of white wine (no red opened) and added thyme. Al herbs were fresh not dried. Very tasty.

Made an amazingly delicious stew. I used a quart each of water and low salt beef broth to make it thick enough so that my husband wouldn't think he was getting "soup for dinner." Added 1/2 tsp. salt with the liquids, and another 1/2 tsp. with the spinach and couscous. I waited until the last 1/2 hour before adding the carrots, so they wouldn't be mushy, and 10 oz. of frozen spinach was a perfectly good substitute for fresh.

I feel like I'm cheating reviewing this recipe, because I really only used it as a base and made several alterations because I am vegetarian. It is pretty unlikely that anyone else will come to this recipe looking for a vegetarian version, but I'll share what I made anyway - the end result was really delicious. Obviously, I omitted the lamb, and I chose to substitute chickpeas, using ~20 oz. of canned organic chickpeas. I still wanted a rich flavor in absence of the juices that would normally be generated by the lamb, so I used 6 c. vegetable stock in place of the 2 c. beef stock and 4 c. water the recipe calls for. I did not have any fresh mint on hand, so I used fresh cilantro in its place. I threw in 2 small diced red potatoes and 1/2 c. of corn as well, and used Israeli couscous in place of the smaller variety. It was absolutely delicious, and I would highly recommend this variation, for vegetarians and meat eaters alike.

A very tasty use of a cheap cut of lamb. I use 1 quart of water (not 4); 1 quart of beef broth; and cooked orzo instead of couscous for more of a stew. I also add a teaspoon of salt.

I had a leftover leg of lamb to help make the stock, I used necks as well. My friend raved about it, however, I was having a hard time deciding what I thought of it. I will make it again when I have another leftover leg of lamb, but it is not something I would put on the menu for entertaining.

Dee-licious. My husband loved it. I used frozen spinach and didn't chop it.
