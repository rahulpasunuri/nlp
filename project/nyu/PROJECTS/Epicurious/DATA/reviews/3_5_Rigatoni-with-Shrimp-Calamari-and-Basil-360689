I made this for some friends yesterday with homemade rigatoni (extruding pasta always seems like more work than it's worth, but it always ends up being worth it in the end). It was a big hit. I didn't really change anything, except that I used scallops instead of calamari, and I'll definitely make this again.

I followed this pretty close...I did choose to eliminate some of the oil and butter; 3 Tbl oil at the beginning and 2 Tbl butter added to the leek mixture. My husband and I both loved it; it was light, full of flavor, but still filling for a main course.

I made this for Valentine's day and it was wonderful! It's definitely restaurant-quality and very beautiful served in a big bowl with all the shrimp and calamari on top. My only regret is not halving the recipe, it made enough to serve at least 6 in my opinion.

One of the best seafood pasta we've cooked so far. See how we cooked it: http://whatdidudo.blogspot.com/2010/09/seafood -pasta-extravaganza.html

Very pretty, rich and delicious dish. High in calories, but worth if if you enjoy decadent sea food. I subbed bay scallops for calamari and used a little less basil than was called for. I felt that the cheese in the recipe was very complementary, and I did use a very fresh one. Definitely worth a try for me - I was very happy with the end result.

I chopped the shrimp and calamari a little too much- would make sure to keep them chunkier next time. I kind of agree with the cheese and basil being a little too strong for this dish. Also, like the idea of a splash of lemon. I used whole wheat pasta- bad idea. This is a really delicate sauce, pasta overpowered it. great weekday dinner.

Sounds Great!1 If i were to change anything, I'd change the basil to cilantro and add a dash squeeze of fresh lemon juice at the end.

Excellent using scallops, or as the other cook wrote, double the shrimp.. Toss in a dozen thick rubber bands if your a squid lover and need the texture. Ha!

Doubled the shrimp and skipped the calamari of which I am not a fan. Delicious and simple. To spatalano below: If you are not a fan of mixing seafood and cheese then skip either ingredient (or better yet don't make it at all), but why diss the generations of Italian cooks that have combined the two ingredients?

This recipe could be improuved greatly by substituting basil with parsley. Basil has too strong a flavor and interfere with the dellicate taste of the sea food.

I thought this was good but not great. It made a nice weeknight dinner and was light and fresh tasting. It didn't stand out to me as anything special though. I followed the directions pretty much to the T although I added a little extra crushed red pepper. I doubled the peas as another reviewer suggested but for us that was too many peas.

why would anyone want to pollute the delicate flavor of the seafood with any cheese, let alone such a distinctive one ??? (I have not made this nor would I dare)

deliciously familiar...a few things I changed based on what i had on hand, but otherwise outstanding.

Wow, this was excellent. The shrimp/calamari sauce with the pasta was so flavorful. It comes together quickly once you have prepped everything. I didn't change a thing and will be making this often.

A very good shrimp and pasta recipe, simplified a big and only did the shrimp since I wasn't able to get calamari but this didn't take away from the dish. Would add double the peas(my preference) next time and kick up the red pepper a bit more. Would love to visit the restaurant to see how close the recipe comes to the "real thing" Good for a weekday meal.
