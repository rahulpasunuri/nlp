sounds great, but why not make your own chutney? And instead of "hot pepper sauce" do your own habañero sauce? S' E-Z! Ciao! Tebaldi

Just OK. I won't make again. It wasn't bad but not memorable either.

I thought this sauce was very good. I modified the recipe slightly, using canned red chili sauce rather than bottled. The canned chili sauce provided good chili flavor without as much vinegar as bottled sauces. I also used sweet mango chutney. Using canned chili sauce and sweet chutney allowed me to control the tang and heat by modifying the amount of apple cider vinegar and habenero sauce.

I have been a die-hard for this recipe on ribs since I first made it several years ago. HOWEVER, I am only fan of it on ribs. I don't think it is the right sauce for chicken, and I haven't tried it on anything else. With that said ribs just aren't ribs without this sauce.

I followed this recipe to the letter, including the 1/3 cup of apple cider vineagar, and was very disappointed. Wow, I just couldn't believe how sour and vinegar-y this sauce was! Just breathing in the aroma while cooking it made my eyes and nose burn and the whole house stink! I could barely taste even the smallest amount without wincing, so I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar to try to cut the vinegar and even then it's terribly vinegar-y. I don't think we'll be able to eat it on the BBQ chicken as planned. Considering all this, I was amazed at the good reviews it got. If I ever try it again I'll start out with half - or even less - of the vinegar. And I might use less of the chili sauce and more of the chutney -- which I couldn't taste at all in the sauce.

Wasn't able to add the hot pepper sauce to accommodate family members who can't take the heat - maybe that's why we found the vinegar to be a bit much. Will make again reducing the amount of vinegar.

The only change I made was to put the finished sauce in the blender and pulse a couple of times. I like a small amount of texture, but more smoothness. This is an excellent compliment to the Kalua Pig on the site.

This is now the "house sauce" - we made it with the porkchops, then had the leftovers with grilled chicken - fabulous.

Perfect blend of flavors in the sauce. I grilled pork chops for 4, so have lots of sauce left over and am looking forward to trying it with other meats this week.

Very easy to make and very tasty. I like the consistency; it came out thick and sticky. It will stick to whatever you bbq. I used it as a dipping sauce. I made it just as listed but I like it spicy so I used two teaspoons of habanero sauce.

One of the best sauces I've found. Used the exact ingredients....wouldn't change a thing.

Absolutely wonderful! Ingredients are easy to find, sauce is easy to prepare and so delicious. Great on brined, grilled pork chops and also on chicken. I skipped the pepper sauce as it has plenty of zing to it without. This is my favorite barbecue sauce recipe and I make it all the time. Enjoy!

This is fantastic, but calling it a barbeque sauce may be somewhat misleading. It is more of a condiment, or a sauce, and as such it is a perfect complement to the corresponding pork chop recipe. It would also go well with chicken or any other meat that doesn't have a whole lot of character by itself. I made the entire amount, even though I was only cooking four pork chops, and not a drop was left over. My husband lapped it up and called it one of the best sauces he has ever tasted. I made it exactly as written, using the new habenero pepper variety of tabasco sauce. The other ingredients are hardly exotic or hard-to-find; chile sauce is one of Heinz's "57" varieties, usually found near the ketchup. And Major Grey's chutney, while not the best mango chutney around, is on the shelves of most supermarkets.

I also did not add the hot sauce at the end since the chili sauce I used was quite spicy. I used this to marinate 2 pork tenderloins for a few hours and then grilled them for 20 minutes. My husband and our guests raved about it. It's easy to make & very flavorful.

This was a great BBQ sauce. I didn't have any trouble finding, Chili Sauce, chutney or any other ingredient ... most of the time one only has to read the labels. We brushed the chops with BBQ and also served it on the side warmed up a bit. Finger Lick'en Good on ribs over the weekend too!!!

This is the best barbecue sauce we have ever eaten. I have never made it with the brined pork chops, but it is our favorite sauce to have with ribs. The sauce is easy to make and is one of the few recipes that I prepare exactly as it is written. My husband wants to grill ribs every weekend just to have this sauce!

The sauce was awesome! I used Tiger Sauce for the chili sauce, thinking that it was the same, and Tabasco for the hot sauce. My husband raved for weeks!

This sauce was DELICIOUS. I left out the pepper sauce--it didn't need it. Our company is still raving about it. Thankfully, it wasn't one of those barbeque sauces with the fake smoke flavor. I can't imagine why others didn't like it--this is a real winner.

The recipe was poorly written: no specification of what sort of "chili sauce" or mango chutney to use. With 3 tablespoons of chili sauce (rather than 12 oz), 6 tablespoons of mango chutney (rather than 10 oz), and with the habanero pepper sauce left out entirely, I still had to throw out the sauce as inedible. And I'm usually the one complaining that the vindaloo is too mild. 2 3/4 cups of sauce for 8 chops is silly. We put a scant tablespoon on the chops, then had to scrape it off and throw it out.
