This recipe was great! I made a couple substitutions though: I swapped out the veal for 6 oz skinless salmon filets (did not bread them) to make it healthier and I also used pre-cooked shrimp to save time. The flavor in the sauce was fantastic and it worked beautifully with the fish. Only thing I really think is worth noting is that quality of brandy matters - the better the brandy, the smoother and more "buttery" the sauce.

Should be a Blue Ribbon Recipe... We actually like it with scallops instead of shrimp.

This was incredible!! I used thin sliced shallots in place of the redonion, I also cutthe recipe in half as it was only for my husband and I but I still used the 6 tablespoons of brandy the rcipe called for..it was devine. My husband asked if we could have it again tonight!!! LOL!!

A nice elegant dinner and an unusual combination of veal and shrimp.

I made this for company on Friday night and it was really yummy. I of course made a couple adjustments....I did not use a red onion, but instead used a couple of large shallots, halved and thinly sliced. I also did omitted the shrimp...I just don't think you HAVE to have them. I also did things in a different order so that I could minimize my cooking while the guests were there...I browned the veal first, wiped out the pan, made the sauce, and then just turned off the heat and covered the pan w/the sauce in it till we were ready to eat (and reheated the veal in the oven on a cookie sheet). Be sure to season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste before serving. Got rave reviews and clean plates!

Love this recipe. Make it often using pounded out pork tenderloin slices if I can't find the right cut of veal. Have also used the sauce over chicken breasts and steak. I also like to substitue baby bella mushrooms as they tend to hold up better during the cooking process.

For a slightly different twist (because I only had a small amt of veal), I cut the veal into thin strips and cooked them stir-fry style. Finished by re-warming the sauce with the meat and seafood, then served it over egg noodles (like a stroganoff) with some King Crab I had in the freezer in place of the shrimp. Used half & half instead of whipping ceam and it was sufficiently rich- I'd even go 10% next time. The only thing to think about is keeping the intitial sauce reserve fairly thin, because the floured veal strips will thicken the sauce rather quickly when brought together to warm. Hubby raved. Kid licked plate.

This recipe was sinfully rich and delicious. I used already cooked shrimp and just heated them slightly in the butter. I served the veal topped with the shrimp and sauce over a bed of whipped/mashed parsnips. I will definitely make it again - for guests next time.

3 1/2, actually. What a curious dish: veal and shrimp combined (very few recipes on this site have that combination), and a very tasty brandy/cream sauce. Made as written, with great results. It doesn't quite get to 4 stars because there is just something odd about the whole combination that prevents it from going into the legendary status.

Great Recipe...scallops are even better than shrimp, and use over filet mignon for the most incredible surf and turf!

I made the recipe with chicken cutlets instead of veal, shallots and garlic instead of the red onion, and substituted fresh crab for the shrimp. Also added a little dried marjoram to the crab sauce just before taking it off the heat. It was scrumptious!!

Had not made this dish in a while, forgot how delicious it is. This is a great holiday or company recipe as making the sauce in advance gives the flavors a chance to develop. Was perfect for mother's day dinner with twice baked potatoes and string beans.

Try this one with venison cutlets pounded thin. It'll make a hunter out of a PETA fanatic!!! It is wonderful!

The veal was delicious. However, be careful when cooking the sauce. My sauce was looking great and then presto, it was over cooked! The butter separated from everything else and it looked unappetizing. It still tasted good, but I'm sure that's not how it was supposed to look! So watch your heat and your time so that you don't overcook the sauce. Also, the time listed on the veal may be a little long. I only cooked the veal about 1 min 15 seconds per side over medium-high heat and it was slightly on the over-done side for my taste. But all in all, this is a great recipe. I think next time it will turn out much better because I'll know what to look out for.

WOW!!!! I made this for Valentine's Dinner and served it with the Truffled Red Wine Risotto with Parmesan Broth. It was amazing! Super easy. I will DEFINITELY make this again and again.

Rating: 4
Easy and super rich and fantastic! A couple of changes that I made (that I don't think invalidate the recipe) were that I only had marsala instead of brandy and instead of shrimp, I used crab claw meat (vacuum pack pouch). Served it over rice and we scarfed it down and can't wait to use it again. You can cut down on the butter and don't use flour when doing the cutlets to save a few calories.

Yo, this was a recipe that I followed exactly as is and it was wonderful. Made it for my girlfriend for her birthday and she absolutely loved it!!! It was so flavorful. Bought some french sourdough bread to dip with the brandy cream sauce. EXCELLENT RECIPE!!! SERIOUSLY!!!

I thought this dish was excellent, my guests loved the sauce and veal shrimp combo. I served this with Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes, which also went well with the sauce. I would however prefer the sauce to be a bit thicker. Any suggestions?

Absolutely loved this dish! The sauce was so yummy I could eat it alone. It is a nice compliment to the veal. I used regular button mushroom since I'm not a big fan of shitake...and it was delicious.

This dish is delicious. The sauce is amazing and easy to make. My only recommendation would be to cook the veal a little slower or in the oven to prevent the cutlets from getting tough.

This dish was so easy and fun to make and the taste was divine! My husband and I would only add some mashed potatoes to have the veal sit upon with a side of asparagus to round out a perfect dish!

My favourite dish on this site! Fairly easy and very impressive. I like to garnish with a little fresh parsley to add some colour to the presentation.

This was a bit labor intensive due to the 3 steps but worth it. As the other reviewer noted, be careful when you ignite the brandy as this measure equals about a 1/4 cup and the flame can be big. Also note the 14 minute simmer after the cream is added. This will help you time any other dishes you're preparing at the same time.

MADE THIS FOR VALENTINE'S DAY 2002-YESTERDAY MY HUSBAND SAID "MAKE THE VEAL AND SHRIMP AGAIN". WHOOPS, I LOST THE RECIPE..GLAD I FOUND IT AGAIN FOR ANOTHER MEMORABLE MEAL. tHANKS EPICURIOUS!

I'll add my kudos for this dish. Made it for a small New Year's Day dinner party and the compliments kept coming. Used stock rather than broth, which added a little more depth. Also made the meat first, held it in a 150-degree oven and then did the sauce. I agree with others that this is a very versatile sauce.

This is amazing- worth every calorie! I always modify recipes but this one was perfect as-is! It tastes like you labored for hours, but is so easy!

I have made this recipe as written three times - each time yielding perfect results. It makes plenty of sauce. If you have sauce leftover, I recommend saving it to use the next day with some good steaks - delicious! By the way, cooking time is more valuable to me than cleaning time, so I do not recommend preparing the whole recipe in one pan, as stated in the recipe. Veal cooks quickly, but time adds up when you have multiple batches to saute. Start the sauce in a separate pan so you can work on the veal when the sauce is nearly finished. Then pour the sauce into the veal pan at the end.

The sauce is to die for. Used regular sweet onions as I forgot the red onions at the market.

Absolutely fantastic! I admit, I'm a terrible cook. I've been searching for a fool proof recipe to serve company. I was hoping this might be the one. It was easy to make, looked fabulous and tasted wonderful. My husband was totally impressed with the meal and the fact that we can now finally invite friends for dinner.

I basically made just the sauce for this recipe - to accompany scallops and mashed potatoes. It was fabulous...I use the sauce for lots of dishes now. I didn't use beef broth when I made it for the scallops due to my Mom's unlove of the cow.... it was still wonderful.

3.5 forks! Made this for Valentine's dinner - easy, impressive and the sauce is decadent! Used baby bellas, a shallot instead of onion, and less cream than recipe. Definitely de-glaze! Served with roasted asparagus sprinkled w/steamed red pepper heart cutouts and twice-baked roasted garlic and cheese potatoes. Served extra sauce next day over mushroom tortelloni...uummm.

This recipe is fantastic!!! I live in the "food capital" and this still ranks up there with one of the best meals that I have had... Easy, elegant-- a keeper for dinner parties and special occasions. I did use all low sodium broths though... We love Kelsey's restaraunt!!

I found this rather bland. Next time I would add shallots and maybe an herb. Also, the addition of demi-glaze or meat glaze would give some depth to the sauce. No need to flambe the brandy. Reducing it will have the same effect, if not the same affect!

Fastastic! Takes about 30 minutes to from stove-to-table, and really tastes elegant and special. It went great with rice pilaf. Definitely a 'keeper'.

My husband and I are very conservative with our ratings so there are not many recipes that we would rate 4 forks, but this is one of them! The flavors blend so well together. And, as an added bonus, you could actually make the sauce ahead of time and then cook the veal and shrimp just before serving. This makes is a perfect dish for company or any special evening. I followed the suggestion of the previous reviewer and deglazed the pan with white wine before removing the veal to a warm platter. (And, uh, as a side note, if you have long hair, just make sure its pulled back before you ignite the brandy! (-; My! but it flames up quickly!)

The only change I made to this was to deglaze the pan with white wine after cooking the veal. No point in leaving all that flavour stuck to the pan. It was excellent!!

This is a great, romantic dinner for two but may be more complicated (and expensive) for a larger crowd. It is excellent and comes highly recommended.

I love this recipe! I've made it several times. I agree with the other reviewer about the sauce being a little thin. Corn starch does the trick! I serve with Ovenbaked potatoe au gratin, using whipping cream, fresh chives and lots of cheese (anything sharp, I like Gruyere)- bake 1 hour. This one will make you a star in the eyes of your guests!

Made this for Mother's Day dinner and it was a huge hit. Only change was the sauce didn't seem to be thickening so I made a slurry with 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch and a little chicken broth and then had a great consistency to the sauce. A definite keeper. Served with roasted baby potatos that were tossed with olive oil, pepper, salt and fresh rosemary then 5 minutes before serving added parmesan cheese and tossed to coat. Huge hit!!!!

Great recipe. I halved the recipe for 2 but ended up using all the brandy because it evaporated so fast when I added it to the pan. Another company quality recipe.
