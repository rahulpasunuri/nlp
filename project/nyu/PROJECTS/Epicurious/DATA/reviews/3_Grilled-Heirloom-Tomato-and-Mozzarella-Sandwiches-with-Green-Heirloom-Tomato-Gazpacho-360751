Loved this recipe. It was simple and delicious! I didn't follow the recipe to the T. I just made regular grilled cheese sandwiches (wheat bread, havarti cheese slices, and yellow heirloom tomatoes, buttered bread). For the gazpacho recipe, I used everything except cucumbers (don't care for them). I've never had gazpacho (avoided it because cold tomato puree didn't sound appetizing) before so I can't say much about authenticity, but it was definitely tasty! It was also easy to make.
