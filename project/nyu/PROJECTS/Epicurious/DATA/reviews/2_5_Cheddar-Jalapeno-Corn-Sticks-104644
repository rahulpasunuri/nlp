I'm surprised at some of the negative comments. I have made these a number of times and am always very pleased with the results. I use flour in my regular skillet cornberead but no flour makes since for the sticks. I always cut the recipe in half since I have ony one stick pan. A definite keeper.

These were gone in minutes. So good. I didn't have a corn stick pan so I made them in a cast iron skillet and cut them into sticks. I did forget to add the cheese until I'd already poured the batter into the pan, so I sprinkled it over the top before it went in the oven. I actually think it was better that way because the crusty cheese was delicious.

Not enough punch for my family! It was very, very bland. I decided to change it a bit and make my usual! I use white cornmeal (buttermilk version), plus I still use buttermilk & one egg to mix it all together. I then add about 2 cups of Monterey Jack Cheese, one medium-large red onion, 1 jar of green chilies, 5 fresh jalepenos, (3 green and 2 red) including some of the seeds to give it some punch. I use Crisco Oil, not butter, in the mix, and also in my cast iron skillet, so the cornbread will not stick. Being raised in the southeast, most people I know, "do not" put sugar in their cornbread and we use white not yellow cornmeal, including myself! After writing this, I think I'm going to have this for dinner with a roasted chicken w/sage, butter beans and sauted new potatoes! Yummie!

Great taste, made them for a pot luck and they were all gone. They were good even cold!

Not a keeper for us. I also thought there must be a misprint not with no flour. Even with all of the high flavor ingredients (sharp cheddar, onion and jalapenos) there wasn't much flavor in the finished product and without the flour they seemed very greasy/fatty with out the expected flavor. Will go back to our standard cornbread with some jalapenos for kick to go with our chili.

Made the skillet version. Thought it was pretty good. Will try more cheese and jalapenos next time.

I didn't think this bread had very much "corn bread" flavor and if it wasn't for the Jalapeno's, it wouldn't have had much taste at all.

This is a tasty partner to a hot bowl of spicy Chili. I used 4 Tablespoons of Jalepenos. 2 Fresh and 2 pickled. Also doubled the sugar. Very Tasty! Doug in Denver

Great corn stick recipe. I even bought the corn stick pan just to try it out. The more jalapeno the better. Don't over cook them, they get a little dry.

Was a little sceptical at first thinking there might be a mis-print because the recipe doesn't call for flour but tried it anyway using the skillet version and the family loved it - though one family member said it was a little spicy.

Very tasty and much more interesting than 'plain' cornbread. Definately would make these again.
