I was eating this sauce with a spoon - it was sweet, garlic-y, and absolutely delicious. I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.

This is a great, simple sauce, but requires good ingredients. I used fresh heirloom tomatoes from our garden, three plum and a brandywine beefsteak. Rather than roast the garlic in oil, I cut the top off the garlic bulbs, drizzled them with olive oil, wrapped them loosely with foil and roasted. Added fresh thyme and oregano before serving with homemade pasta topped with parmigiano.

I made this sauce in 98 and followed the recipe exactly. My memory of it was that it made the best eggplant parm I've ever had. Last week I had company and wanted a homemade sauce for seafood pasta. I did not have access to a computer and made recipe from memory. I roasted the tomatoes and garlic together. I forgot about the honey but added some sugar. Forgot the vinegar completely ... next time I will use it. The sauce was AMAZING with home made pasta, grilled shrimp and scallops. This recipe is a keeper and a do over ... and a 4 forker.

thin, not worth the effort, threw it away and used a jar of prego in its place

An interesting dish. It's light and fresh and, obviusly, full of garlic. I'll definately keep this in mind for Halloween dinner. However, it didn't have much interest beyond the garlic & we found it a bit disappointing.

Awesome!!! I increased the garlic a bit, and found it to work well. This sauce is a keeper.

Good, basic recipe. I've made it several times, and have added other things to it each time - mushrooms, sausage, peppers, etc. Also, substituted balsamic vinegar for the red wine - very tasty.

Wasn't sure about the combination of ingredients but it was really good! Used my home grown tomatoes, yum! It's alot of garlic but, it gave the sauce a rich, creamy texture and taste. Broiling the tomatoes was a nice idea. They almost fall apart when their done. I thought this was a fun dish to make. It's a 3.5 forker!

Very tasty. Takes more time to make than I thought. Better after a day or two.
