This was simple and delicious! Even my family enjoyed this (and they aren't the cilantro fans that I am!) Quail was a new and fun experiment though eating the quail was a bit like eating fish, lots of bones! Enjoyed the experience! Think this marinade would be great on chicken and possibly a flank steak. Will be using this recipe again!

This recipe is an all-time favorite. We marinate the quail for several hours, and use more fresh coriander but no ground coriander. We always make it on the gas grill outside, and there is no need to deglaze. Quail sounds like a hard dish to make, but this could not be easier.

Excellent and simple recipe, if broiled properly the skin can be nicely crisped. To the cook from Athens - you are doing the backbone removal wrong. Use chicken shears and you just cut it out. No effort and no danger. You can use the shears to cut the quail in half also. It's far easier to bone a quail than a chicken, especially since it can be done with shears instead of a knife.

Very good.

I found the basic marinade to be a bit heavy on cilantro and soy, so I added a generous dash of Chinese Five Spice powder to this, and it gave the dish a fuller, more savory-sweet flavor. The only real problem I had with this recipe was removing the back bones, which is tougher than it sounds for such small birds. My boyfriend used our Chinese cleaver on them, which made the work go easier, but it almost cost him his left index finger when the cleaver glanced off the breast bone at the wrong angle. Although he now shows off the scar on his fingertip like a badge of honor-proof that he's bled for his cooking- I'd recommend saving yourself some stitches by asking your butcher to remove the backbones for you. Otherwise, be VERY careful when halving the quail!

Wonderful recipe. We grilled it before, but broiled it this time so we could do the deglazing thing. Next time I'll use slightly less ground coriander. For some reason it was a bit too much this time around. I like serving the sauce on the side.

Whenever we make this, our guests swoon. We make it on our outdoor grill, just 2 minutes on each side. You'll think you are at a gourmet restaurant--and it's very easy.

My husband & I give this recipe a 2 thumbs up. It was our first time every to try Quail. The flavors of the marinate were exquiste (we marinated them for 6 hours).

I adopted this recipe to cook a grouse and the results were quite good. I left the marinade on overnight, and its flavor was not overpowering.

This dish is wonderful. Make sure to let it marinate for at least two hours. I have cooked it in the oven and the grill and they both turned out juicy and full of flavor. Have it with some steamed rice,sautee vegetables with oyster sauce and a good chilled white wine.
