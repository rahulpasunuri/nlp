This is a solid recipe that can be easily modified if you wanted to experiment. The fish was super moist and very good, the picky kids even loved it. Also, you don't have to use Orange Roughy, this would be just as good with Cod or Tilapia.

I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, since that's what we had. We really liked the dish, not four stars worth, but it was good. Orange roughy is endangered, so we avoid it. But we enjoyed this recipe with tilapia, which admittedly is not as delicious, but it does the trick.

Orange roughy is a non-sustainable fish. It takes 25 years for it to grow to maturity, and so the population has been decimated. Try to find another fish for dinner!

I deleted the salad portion of this recipe and concentrated on the fish. Made the very similar recipe, suggested by "A Cook from Hailey, ID on 04/18/03". Her recipe is one of the reviews of this one. (Her husband's version is EXCELLENT and SUPER SIMPLE!!!) Do look it up. All I did differently was to cut way back on the baking time since I used thin Pollack fillets. YUM, YUM.

I made this with Tilapia, and was O.K. Nothing wonderful, my family said it was O.K. but would like something more interesting.

TO: "A Cook on 04/29/03"'s response to "A Cook from Oregon, USA on 4/18" Please bother to read the the whole review before making a comment. It included a legitimate review of the dish read as follows: "A pat on the back to "A Cook from Memphis on 04/15/03" I'm getting really tired of not being able to find legitimate reviews of recipes on this site (It would be nice if the site's moderator did something about it.....) GETTING BACK TO THE RECIPE: This is a good, basic breading for Roughy, but I've also used it on Cod and Tilapia and found it equally edible. Personally, I like to toss in a healthy size spoonful of garlic powder and one of onion powder for a little extra flavor. (I've also tossed in a spoonful of "Emeril's Essence" for zip and it was good, but you really don't need much or it overpowers the fish flavor.)"

I thought the recipe was quite tasty. While I feel a little guilty the poor guys are endangered, I'm glad they're still available, for the time being anyhow. On vacation last year my guide got me some dolphin filets - now those are great. If anyone has dolphin filet recipes, please let me know.

My husband created his own version of this dish several years ago: use SEASONED Italian bread crumbs, 1 clove minced or crushed garlic, 1/8 cup freshly chopped parsley, 1 Tblspn each of melted butter & fresh lime juice. Mix crumbs, garlic, parsley, butter & lime juice. Butter the bottom of glass baking dish & sprinkle a thin layer of the bread crumb mixture. Lay fillets on top. Pour remaining crumbs over fish. He flashes it at the higher oven temp for 5-7 minutes, to brown crumbs. Then he reduces temp to 325°F for addt'l 10 to 15 min. If desired, garnish w/parsley sprigs & lime slices. I guarantee this will kick it up a notch for all of you! We serve with a a wild rice salad & steamed asparagus. PS: to the cook from Memphis: Please see a therapist!

Good recipe, many inappropriate reviews...purpose of website is to critique the recipe not oratize on personal philosophies...please don't waste the time of those of us who are seeking to add to our cooking resources...besides have you ever compared the taste of farm raised fish to those litle fishies swimming around in lakes and oceans...how about directing some of your anger to those people who spray everything that is being grown so that we don't even recognize the taste of something anymore

A tip: refrigerate the fish (15 minutes is fine) after crumbing before you bake, it helps the crumbs stick.

This recipe is delicious and I would make it again. Another variation that I have enjoyed is to serve the arugala and tomato salad portion with a simply grilled piece of tuna - that is heaven. Not really interested in the other thread going through these reviews, but I will say two things: one, it is possible to obtain tasty and responsibly-raised farm fish. Here in the Northeast, Wholefoods (Bread&Circus) has great farmed fish. Also, a friend who works for a responsible fish seller recently told me that Chilean Sea Bass may soon be acceptable to serve/sell because of all the efforts and laws over the past couple of years towards its preservation.

I loved this recipe, but I won't be making it again with Orange Roughy. Thanks Kerrie for the information on this particular fish. I also agree with your assessment of "farm raised fish." I have been doing some reading on this subject. The fish are put in breeding pens, fed hormones, and given antibiotics to fight the disease in the pens. Pesticides are also put into the water to cut down on the algae and other undesirables that grow. The fish are also able to get out of their pens and spread their disease. The last few times I've eaten farm raised salmon the taste was so disgusting that I threw it away. I will no longer be eating farm raised fish.

This is for people who are looking for a review of the actual recipe: You can use this method with any flaky white fish. Talapia is great, as well as sole. Halibut is good too. It's super easy, just make sure to pay attention to the cooking times, as the fish tends to cook quickly, depending on how thin it is. Another variation on this, (but in keeping with similar methods so as to keep the calories/fat content down) is: lightly flour a filet of sole (dover, lemon, or grey sole, either is fine). Heat in a skillet 2 tablespoons olive oil, place fish in skillet. The filet of sole should be very thin and delicate, so be careful when turning it. It needs about 2-3 minutes per side. If you like the salad idea, try a mix of arugula, basil, and watercress. Toss with tomatoes, chopped, pitted kalamata olives, one small minced garlic clove, 3 tablespoons olive oil, and try lemon juice instead of vinegar (sliced lemons are also a really good accompaniment to the sole). Juice of 1 lemon. Salt and pepper to taste. Great, easy for summer!

Well said TriBeCa! (applause)! Happy to hear that Tilapia is a farmed fish because we are eating so much fish because of it.

Wow. I can't believe the rudeness here. It's debatable whether farm raised is good for the environment (they make it into the wild & breed bringing new diseases). Not all fish are farm raised - don't think Orange Roughy is because it needs to live in the deep. Nothing wrong with some information for those people who are concerned about the world and otherwise wouldn't be aware of these issues. Why don't you stick with the issues instead of hurling insults at someone you don't know? Oh, and I support the war.

I imagine the fish is very good atop the salad, but I didn't read that anywhere in the recipe. I found layering rice, salad, then fish was very tasty.

This is not a recipe. This is just an idea. Take fish-cook it and place it on a salad? On the other hand I make this type of dish often, use thai seasonings and peanut dressing/arugula and blue cheese/ fish with orange and citrus dressing on the salad. Possibilities abound.
