My Mexican grandmother would have said that this is simply ...aguacate, no es guacamole! As far as tasting like guacamole, this is BLAND! This is basically avacado and onion, not guacamole.

Actually, many cooks in Mexico don't put garlic or lime juice in their guacamole, so this would be authentic, EXCEPT...it left out the cilantro! Add some cilantro, and you'll have a delicious, authentic guacamole. I always put garlic and lime juice in mine but I now like it better without--more unctuous & avocado-y, and less salad/dip-like. I don't think guacamole was meant to be _sprightly_, except for the bite of the white (not sweet yellow! though that tastes fine too...) onion.

We love avacados so this Guacamole is a great recipe and I recommend it to all my friends tell- ing them its from your Epicurious Foods on the Internet. If you like avacados like we do what a delicious way to serve as a dip too. Thank you. We appreciate all you show us!

There is a lack of several essencial ingredents, i.e. lime juice, a hint of garlic, & a touch of sour cream

This is really great, but could use some fresh tomatoes in it.
