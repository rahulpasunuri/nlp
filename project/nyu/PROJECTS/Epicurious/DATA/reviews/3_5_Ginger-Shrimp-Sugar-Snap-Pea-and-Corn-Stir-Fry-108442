Fresh and light. Definitely add a little sesame oil and soy sauce when you stir fry the veggies with the shrimp.

Great recipe with such sweet, complex flavors. I followed recipe but excluded red bell pepper. Can't wait to finish the leftovers tomorrow.

This had a really interesting and delicious mix of flavors. I subbed cubed tofu for the shrimp, and (as many suggested) doubled the ginger, garlic, and red pepper; and added some sesame/soybean oil to the canola. Served with brown rice and cilantro. A little dry, though.

Absolutely delicious! I took the advise of others who posted and doubled the crushed red pepper and took it upon myself to triple the ginger and garlic (just an estimate because I don't really measure). I also added a tablespoon of sesame oil to the shrimp mixture as well as to the veggies. In addition, I added about a teaspoon of ground turmeric to the shrimp, which added to the depth of the flavor. I used canned corn and frozen snap peas, which in no way detracted from the beautiful blend of flavors. This recipe was quick, easy and delicious. I will definitely make it again, and again, and again.

I cooked as directed and found it bland. The shrimp marinade was very good, but otherwise all you taste is the snap peas. If I make it again I will follow the advice of others and boost the ginger and garlic and cut the snap peas by a 1/3.

I thought this was fantastic. I accidentally added all of the ginger to the shrimp instead of saving half to add in with the vegetables, and I still thought it turned out really well. I think it may have actually allowed the flavors of the vegetables to shine through more, particularly the corn (I used fresh, in-season corn cut from the cob -- delicious).

Good and easy. Not bland at all.

This is one of my stand-by weekday meals. However, my advice for livening it up is a bit different -- I felt as if too many flavors were trying to compete with one another. By omitting the bell peppers,the ginger, corn and shrimp flavors really stand out - and because of the snap peas, you don't lose the crispy element!

I used the suggestions of other reviews and doubled the fresh ginger. We found the ginger to be too strong (and we love ginger) and dominating in the dish. Nothing was balanced. It is a very pretty dish and went together easily and quickly, but it was nothing special.

I followed others' suggestions and doubled the garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes. I also doubled the red bell pepper, used frozen corn (it was all I had), and added a couple of splashes of oyster sauce and soy sauce at the end. This made it a 4-fork dinner: tasty, spicy, and very flavorful shrimp!

While this was simple, and good, healthy food, it was BLAND. Due to our own preferences, I would decrease the sugar snap peas and increase the red bell pepper when I make this again (which I will do due to its simplicity and healthiness). Any other suggestions besides doubling the garlic and ginger to combat the ho-hums would be appreciated. Also, so that there would be a bit of juice for over the rice, I added a few ounces of chicken broth (that I had thickened with some flour) at the end of the cooking time. Wish I could say that this was better than a 2-forker. Sorry.

I thought this recipe succeeded on so many levels. It tasted amazing - lots of flavor, looked fantastic - lots of color, and was so quick to make after work for dinner. I cut a few corners by using frozen shrimp and frozen corn. I also used olive oil and a little less than called for in the recipe. Served it with brown rice. I will make this over and over again. My husband enjoyed it and he's sometime reluctant to try "heathy" meals.

This is a great recipe - I made a quick version with frozen veggies and shrimp. I also substituted half the snap peas with petite green peas. Watch the red pepper if you don't want it too spicey. Will make this again.

A good basic healthy dinner, easy to make with ingredients that I typically have onhand. Despite my relatively low fork rating, I would call this a high health/ease/speed/ingredients-in-stock to taste value, meaning I will probably add to my regular repertoire. The corn adds a nice hearty touch and, as others have written, color. Also, heeding others' the advise, I spiced it up with soy sauce, double ginger, double garlic, lemon juice and, in addition to crushed red pepper, 3 tablespoons of red chili paste. Without the additions, it would have been boring and bland.

Very good. Easy to prepare. Healthy and low carb! I would make this dish again and again.

This really appealed to me....and I used frozen corn and sugar snap peas and still liked it. It's nice to see low calorie recipes because otherwise I only use Bon Appetit recipes on special occasions.

I kind of took liberties with this recipe. Replaced shrimp with beef (marinated in soy sauce, garlic, ginger, lime juice, sugar, sesame oil); ditched the peas, added mung bean sprouts, extra ginger and garlic. Delicieux!

This was great. Fresh corn is a must. Also, I upped the spice factor by subbing half of the canola with Judy Fu's hot chile oil. Yum!

Too bland. I would increase the crushed red pepper and perhaps add some soy sauce or oyster sauce. Pretty and healthful, but needs more oomph.

I liked this very much. I followed the suggestions of doubling the garlic and ginger as well. I added about 12 ounces of exotic mushrooms with the stir-frying of the vegetables. I also created a simple sauce of plum sauce, water, soy sauce and a bit of cornstarch to thicken it. This was poured over all in the end and tossed. We enjoyed it with Sriracha hot chili sauce (to kick it up a bit) and had sauteed pork and leek dumplings (frozen at the market) for our starter. This was enjoyed with a bottle of Fruity Arnies (Ceretto "Blange") which was very enjoyable to cool the heat!

OK, great colors but rather bland taste. One of my Sons said it tasted like water. Definitely needed oyster or fish sauce and more spices. Would make it again because it is easy and colorful but would add more flavor and a thicker sauce.

Excellent recipe! Came together so quickly. I added a bit of fish sauce instead of salt.

After reading the reviews I doubled the chili's and ginger. It was very good, lots of colour and lots of flavor. I served it over Japanese (sticky) rice.

My children and I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. I cheated and used frozen corn and it was still terrific. I will add more crushed red pepper next time but other than that, wouldn't change a thing.

Yum! The shrimp tastes terrific with the marinade. We were in a hurry and let it marinate for just 30 minutes, and it was great. We've even had just the marinated shrimp without the veggies, served it with steamed lobster tail, corn and asparagus on the side. Great summer recipe!

The dish looked beautiful with all of the veggie colors--red, green, and yellow--but I thought it was a little bland so I would double the marinade next time.

Good flavor. I sprinkled with soy sauce instead of salt. I also accidentally marinated the shrimp for a little over 24 hours, and they had a great flavor.

Simple, flavorful and tasty. Great summer dish.

This was really tasty and, because I was in a hurry (as usual), I didn't even marinate it! I substituted thinly sliced mushrooms for the corn and regular onions for the green ones. I used less crushed red pepper and no salt, but a little more garlic. I will definitely make this again.
