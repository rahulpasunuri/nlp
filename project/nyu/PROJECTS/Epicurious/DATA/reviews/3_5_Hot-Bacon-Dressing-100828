Needs some stone ground mustard and a bit of honey to mimic the traditional dressing for spinach salad with bacon, red onion, and boiled egg that we love.

We liked this dressing. It made the salad actually. I added eggs and onion to lettuce and made this salad part of mexican supper.

I made this once the way the recipe states and it was great. I also tried a little added splash of Ken's Balsamic Vinegarette with Basil to the mix and I liked it even more! Super easy to make and yet seems fancy to guests! It's a keeper for me...
