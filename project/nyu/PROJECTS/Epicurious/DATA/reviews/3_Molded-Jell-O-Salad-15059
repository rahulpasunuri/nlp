If you grew up in the South, as I did, you might have found this dish the most palatable on the table. To all the wannabe snobs with their noses turned up : no one looks good with his nose turned up.

To the cook from Greenwich, Ct '01: I ran across the recipe you wanted in a Paula Deen Christmas cookbook from the library last week. We always had it for Thanksgiving, wakes, Sunday, etc. 1 pkg. lemon Jell-0, 1 pkg. lime Jell-0, 1 20 0z. can crushed pineapple, 1 16 oz. container cottage cheese, 1 c. mayo, 1/2 c. o.j.,1/2 c. pecan pieces, 1 tsp. prepared horseradish. Dissolve the Jell-0 in 2 c. hot water then pour into a 13x9 casserole. Refrigerate until sl. jelled. Add remaining ingredients and stir gently. Return to the refrigerator until completely set. Serves 10-12

Come on guys, open up. Think mousse. We love this recipe - hard to believe I know when looking at the ingredients. Absolutely the best palette refresher during a rich meal such as a Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner. Suggest losing the olives.

OK -- I'm looking for a gelatin salad and this site has only two. I know that it was the "thing" in the 50's, but some time has passed and it's now appropriate to give gelatin it's fair place at the table. It is low in calories, nutritious, and the right recipe can add a nice, cool, crunchy counterpoint to an other wise rich heavy meal. I wish there were more recipes made with unflavored gelatin on this site.

A client asked for it so I made it. It was every bit as bad as I thought it would be. Be afraid; be very afraid!

What is this doing on this website? Throughly disgusting. Remove all dishes calling for gelatin, vegetables, and cottage cheese.

This is a very old, but good recipe.... I whip the mayo into the hot jello than add the cottage cheese and crushed pinapple. Mold it in a rectangular pan . When chilled and firm, cut in squares, place on a crisp lettuce leaf. top with a dollop of a sourcream mayo mixture and a cherry. Looks very nice on the table and tastes good too.

Is this recipe for real? I feel it should be removed from this website. It is very common and not of the caliber of Epicurous.

Have looked high & low for this recipe for years and finally found it! Great thing about jello - You can always omit something that may turn you off (olives) At least try it before you knock it!!!

I am hopeful someone remembers the old, old recipe for lime jell-o, cottage cheese, pineapple, mayo?, and a small amount of horseradish. I need it for a recipe for a dinner we're having at my church and want to serve it with baked ham. Can anyone help? Thank you.

The worst recepy I've ever tried. Honestly. Tastes awful, doesn't look better either. Total waste. I guess those people who raved about it were just polite to Grandma DeeDee.
