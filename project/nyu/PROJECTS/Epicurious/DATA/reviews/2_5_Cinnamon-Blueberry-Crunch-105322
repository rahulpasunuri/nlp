I agree with something being wrong with recipe. I think 50 minutes after the topping is put on should probably be 15 minutes! Blueberries were hard and sticky. Too bad, we were really looking forward to it.

It sucked, waste of fresh picked blueberries and time.

Although my husband really liked this, I thought it required more time than it was worth. For some reason the topping got sucked into the blueberry mixture while baking so I was shortchanged on the crunch. I think fresh berries over ice cream would've been just as good.

I thought this turned out quite well. I was a bit surprised at how soupy the blueberry mixture was when I initially baked it. I didn't think I had enough topping to cover the blueberries but it actually worked out. If you heat it the dish and top it off with vanilla ice cream it is quite delicious.

I served this at a big family dinner and got rave reviews all around. I added a bit of freshly grated nutmeg, my favorite spice.

Delicious. (I cooked it for 5 minutes less at each of the two steps.)

There's something wrong here. I cooked for half the time called for after applying the topping and ended up with shoe leather with a crunchy topping. My first total disappointment with an Epicurious recipe - guess it had to happen eventually....
