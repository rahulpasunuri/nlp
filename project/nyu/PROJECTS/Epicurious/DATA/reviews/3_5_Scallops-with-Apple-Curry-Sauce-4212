This was amazing. I wasn't sure if all the ingredients would go together, but they sure did. This was delicious.

This dish is real comfort food! If you're not a "curry" person, don't let that scare you off. The curry gives the sauce real depth and tastes like a richer vodka sauce. I used Muir fire roasted canned tomatoes - and it was a nice modification. I agree - a real keeper!

Very easily prepared. Very impressive presentation. Left over sauce will be served over pasta tonight.

My husband is from England and had never eaten scallops before, but is a fan of "curry". Thought this recipe would appeal to him, and he truly enjoyed it. His preference would be not to add the apples (something about mixing "sweet & savory" tastes together). On the other hand, I thoroughly enjoyed the sweet taste and texture of the apples, the ease of preparation, and the combination of all the flavors come together quite nicely. Definitely will look to make this dish again. Served the scallops with roasted potatoes and petite peas. Keep the side dishes elegantly simply....there are enough tasteful flavorful sensations in the apple-curry sauce to satisfy everyone!

This was fantastic. Cannot understand the dig about schizophrenic competing flavors. They all worked very well together for me. (If that other critic grows his/her own rosemary and basil, as we do,there would be no worry about the expense!) Served this with a corn salad (with tomato, black olives, red onion, red pepper etc.) and the meal was perfect. I made extra curry/apple sauce and a day or two later, added cut up breast of chicken, and served it over pasta. Another winner.

We made this at our beach house and it was great. We added another 1/2 cup of chicken stock and wine to make additional sauce. We cooked bowtie pasta and served the souce over the bowtie with the scallops and the side. I was asked to make it again for friends.

Too many competing flavors in this schizophenic dish. No need to waste precious fresh basil and rosemary if you're going to to add apples, curry powder, cream, tomatoes and chicken stock.

This dish has great flavor combinations. I usually substitute the smaller bay scallops (because they're easier to find) & serve this as a sauce over angel-hair pasta. I've made it several times & it's always well-received.
