This one just didn't do it for me and I love curried chicken salad. I only made the chicken salad part, and maybe that was the mistake. I put the chicken salad on a be of fresh greens, but the salad itself was lacking flavor. I doubled the amount of raisins, because after tasting it I realized that the raisins were the best part.
