Wonderful recipe. I used hand made puff pastry and spiced up the white chocolate cream with a little orange liquor. The orange flavor brings out the flavors of the berries quite nicely.

I just serve the cream with mixed berries. Easier and everyone loves it.

We made this for a baby shower and people seemed to like it. It was easy to make and great since it could be made in advance. The only downside was cutting the pastry got messy and starting falling apart.

This recipe was delicious (especially the white chocolate cream), impressive looking, and easy to prepare.
