Simple and good. The recipe is just right as is, even without parmesan. It doesn't need any additions, which would just overpower the subtle flavor & sweetness of the squash and zucchini.

Excellent and satisfying, good flavors. First time users...READ RECIPE to end first. You need to add drained pasta plus reserved pasta water to cooked squash then cook down. (My husband realized I was reducing liquid without adding pasta and I had to regroup). Only change; used angel hair pasta and topped with a sprinkle of truffle salt at end.

I thought this was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of only using yellow squash since that was what I had. It appears the people who gave this less than stellar reviews substituted basil for the rosemary. The rosemary is key to this dish.

Even though it sounds bland, I tried the recipe as is and found it delicious. The only substitution I had to make was dried rosemary for fresh, and only a teaspoon or so of that rather than a tablespoon. (The second time around I used fresh basil and it wasn't quite as good.) Oh yeah, I also used olive oil instead of butter. The Parmesan gave plenty of buttery flavor and the olive oil, herb, zuchini juice, and pasta water made a wonderful light sauce. But this dish doesn't need garlic -- it's based on the freshness and quality of the ingredients and the texture of al dente pasta with tender squash.

I thought this recipe was great. Simple and very tasty. Everyone who had the dish loved it. I think the trick is the ingredients. I used fresh yellow squash and rosemary from my garden and high quality butter. I did make some changes. I used Asiago instead of Parmigiano. I also used a flavored fettuccine (spinach/chive). Yum!

I was a bit worried about this being very bland when I was making it. I added garlic and white pepper as suggested by other reviewers and when I was cooking the veggies tasted very bland. But on the plate, with plenty of parm it tasted great. I also used fresh pasta which was yummy. I would make this again.

This was much better than I'd thought it would be. Unfortunately, I found out I didn't have any fettucine, so I had to use medium noodles, which actually turned out good enough. I took the advice of other writers and used twice as much garlic and a couple of fresh tomatoes. I halved the recipe and used two pretty big summer squashes. I cooked the squash a lot longer so it was al dente and didn't need any water added from the pasta. I also used lemon pepper, and lots of herbs from the garden (didn't have rosemary) and even though I only had the canister parmesan to shake on top, it was awesome! Even my 8-year old scarfed it. A great way to use up summer squash.

I thought this was a good and quick recipe. I also added two cloves of garlic and extra rosemary and used mostly yellow squash (only one zucchini). It's great for a hot summer night and very fresh tasting. The simplicity of the ingredients definitely leaves room for improvisation, so don't be afraid to experiment with this one. You might end up dissappointed if you don't.

I thought this sounded too simple for my tastes and after reading others' reviews here, I decided to change the recipe. I added 2 large cloves of garlic, a chopped fresh tomato, basil instead of rosemary, lemon zest, and red pepper flakes. I also used a fesh herb pasta.Turned out pretty good.

This dish was pretty good. It was very easy to make, and the textures of the squash and the pasta went well together. Even my boyfriend who does not particularly like zucchini cleaned his plate. I will make it again when in need of a fast and not so expensive meal.

What is it about Yellow Squash that makes it so bland unless it's grilled and covered with herbs? Harrummph!

*plah* This was not interesting ... had to jazz it up with garlic, extra butter and some ricotta. Used basil instead of fresh rosemary.

Very good for a summer dinner. I halved the recipe and added two cloves of garlic for two servings. Served with salad and crusty bread.

A good quickie meal. I added a couple of cloves of crushed garlic to the sauce - mmmm.

Would be better with some garlic.
