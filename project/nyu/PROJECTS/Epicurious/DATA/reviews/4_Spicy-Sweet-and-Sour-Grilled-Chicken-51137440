Made the sauce, and pan seared skinless chicken thighs in a fry pan, then coated with sauce and baked off 400 for 20 minutes, served over white rice with charred peppers and cabbage for an asian take. Great!!

I can't believe no one has reviewed this! SOOOO good. The sauce is rediculous. I also marinated my chicken in orange juice and olive oil.
