This came out wonderful!! The only change I made was to double the carrots and eliminate the celery. I don't like celery. The next time I will add some other veggies like snow peas or mushrooms. I served this with a Butternut squash puree and mixed greens with an Orange Ginger dressing. The whole meal was delightful

This is easy enough for a weeknight but yummy and elegant enough for company. I increased the amount of carrots. I thought the sauce gave it a little extra yumminess and helped tie the whole thing together.

Wow this was good, and so easy too! To make it a little lighter I replaced the cream with 2% condensed milk and my husband never noticed the difference! I also used a whole trout so the cooking time took closer to 18 minutes.

A classic French fish treatment, as another reviewer noted; thus maybe not "exceptional" as the 4 fork rating technically requires, but it's terrific and easy so I won't break its 4 fork streak. Worked very well with quinoa, braised endives, and the rest of the riesling bottle. I'd up the tarragon a bit and use less cream/cornstarch (slightly too thick in my opinion).

We made this after just having gone fishing, so the trout was super fresh. The sauce was just incredible - and I didnt even have all the ingredients - I just made do without. Simply wonderful!!!

Excellent flavor, even with changes I made. Since I didn't have carrots, celery, or shallots, I used what I did have on hand: frozen spinach and onions. I also used whole trout, which I stuffed with parsley, instead of fillets. I increased the baking time to 12 minutes, and added a little sugar to the sauce, to compensate for spinach's lack of sweetness, but otherwise followed the instructions. For serving, I layered the spinach on a bed of mashed potatoes and placed the fish on top. The riesling-lemon sauce worked really well with both sides. Will definitely make again!

Absolutely wonderful! As an old fisherman born & raised amongst trout streams in the UP of Michigan, I'll not corrupt the blessing of fresh trout with breading again :) The meal was breathtaking, as my sweetheart agrees. I modified the recipe using red onion vs shallot, added a small amount of sliced summer squash and red bell pepper for additional color, and I served the entree with a small amount of rice pilaf and mushroom over a leaf of romaine lettuce. I created the sauce by pre-mixing the sauce of cream, corn starch, tarragon and lemon with three-quarter cup of the drippings to save boil-down time. We enjoyed the meal with the remaining Riesling wine of "Yellow Tail" name. No muss or fuss with this recipe -- simply good eating. It is perfect for Valentine's Day romance. This is the meal I would prepare for Christ!

Very tasty and fairly easy to throw together. I made a few chnages because I was limited by what I had on hand. No celery, used 1% milk instead of cream, and because I didn't have any white wine I substituted a tiny bit of ice wine mixed with Perrier. Strange combination for sure but actually it worked out very well. Also I used dried tarragon. The sauce is delicious and the carrots and shallot add a lot of flavour as well. Will make again

This recipe is delicious! I did not use the carrots and celery in any of my versions. In one version, I used a bag of broccli slaw mix. Another time I used portabella mushrooms. And another time I used shredded cabbage and snow peas. Use whatever veggies you like because the sauce goes with most anything. Fresh tarragon wasn't available so I used dried and added extra - Yummy! This sauce is good with other varieties of fish (flounder, snapper, etc..). I did follow the recipe and made sure I used a dry reisling. The dry reisling is still on the fruity side but not like a regular reisling.
