Made this during Passover. I added extra water to the filling, reduced the sugar in the filling by half since my figs were very sweet and simmered the filling for half an hour. I did find the crust a pain to work with. Getting it to line the pan was quite difficult and then it needed about double the cooking time of the recipe, so only 3 stars.

Made this for a seder. It was a big hit. I think one guest ate 1/4 of the tart all by himself given how many times he went back for one more bite. Very tasty and not as complicated as I feared when reading the instructions. I used a 8 1/2 inch tart tin with removable bottom. My tart was not very pretty but I don't bake often so my skill may be at fault rather then the recipe. Will definitely make again. Figs are such an lovely and unusual surprise after the meal and being very high fiber a great dish for Passover. I may try this with dates and walnuts another time.

Are these fresh figs or dried?

I have made this pretty much every year since it came out in Bon Appetit. I always have to add water to the figs. I found the oblong torte pan at Williams and Sonoma and the stated amounts of every thing work with that pan, smooshing in the crust and getting it thin enough but not too thin has gotten easier over the years. I wasn't going to make it this year but I woke up thinking about it and I'm off to find figs. I have discovered this gets better with some age so I usually make it 3 days ahead or even four which does help with all the other cooking for the Seder.

This dessert has become a must have every Passover. It also seeme to be one that people either love or are not interested in. I love it. I always have to add extra water when I make the fig mixture.

I've now made this for Passover for three years in a row. Three years ago I couldn't find figs with Passover kosher certification, so I tried it with dates. It was delicious, but last year, I found kosher for Passover figs, so I tried it with them. While it was great as well, this year I decided to go back to the dates. I got extremely moist Medjool dates, and it was fabulous. Especially good for those who don't eat dishes cooked with matzo meal on Passover (if you're Orthodox, you'll understand this; if not, don't worry about it!)--just don't use the matzo cake meal to dust the pan, use potato starch, or just spray well. A very classy Passover dessert; sure to impress those who don't believe Passover desserts can be tasty.

I doubled the filling, used the recipe, as written, for the crust and used an 11 1/2 inch tart pan, I made this with only a bottom crust. Although it wasn't the #1 dessert, (the lime curd tart with an almond crust, modified for passover was the #1 dessert and a must-try, it's on this website)I would make it again.

My entire family loved this dessert at our Passover meal. It was such a huge success and will be adored at any time of the year! A few suggestions are as follows: after you roll out the top of the tart dough pop it into the freezer for a few minutes to firm up.. when you slide it onto the tart (I also rolled it onto Parchment paper and was easy to slide off), it will be a lot easier to work with. Oh, I also substituted the Pecans for Walnuts...fabulous flavor. I also used my favorite 9" springform pan (lined in Parchment paper)and there was just the right amount of dough/chocolate, there was a little extra remaining filling. Next time, I may try to reduce the amount of sugar in the filling, as the figs are already incredibly sweet, as is was delicious.

This was an excellent, flavorful dessert with ingredients mentioned in the seder service [figs]. I forgot to get pecans, so used whole, raw almonds that I already had. I wanted to use just one packet of dried figs [9 oz.], so I added 1/4 cup dried currants, from pantry. Packaged Calimyrna figs took closer to an hour to cook and needed lots of additional water as cooking progressed. Be sure to have the fruit mixture in a non-stick pot and work on other meal items, while within watching distance of the pot! I made half-again as much nut "dough" and needed every bit. Process dough, THEN fruit! You DO need moist hands to work with the dough. Any that you "pat" in will not smooth-out as well as what was patted on wax-paper on a hard-surface [for top piece]. Do not expect to make any cut-out designs in top crust. Needed 1 oz. more chocolate at the bottom. This recipe, as adapted, filled a 9 1/4" removable-base circular tart pan [measures about 8 1/2" at base of pie". I used all the filling in this size vessel. Forgot to cook the "blind" crust [I was talking ... and just added melted chocolate!]. But, when the top was cooked, the base was too. I had no trouble spreading warm chocolate on the uncooked base. So save 14 minutes + "cooling time"! Must use HEAVY foil! Pie "released" fine; get help with this procedure. Pie can stand alone. Small slices. Like hamentaschen! Mmmmm!

Delicious and an unusual mix of flavors. Wonderful for Passover or any time.
