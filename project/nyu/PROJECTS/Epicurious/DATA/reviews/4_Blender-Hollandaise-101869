Delicious and easy? What more could you ask for. When I want to change things up I add a bit of tomato paste with the yolks at the beginning. I posted a recipe it, Eggs Modenese with Tomato Hollandaise and Spinach, on my blog Spoons to Sporks.

In this day and age nobody should be making Hollandaise with a hand whisk over a double boiler. It's an emulsion people you're doing the same exact thing. Find the quantities you like and get it to the right temperature. NOBODY can tell the difference.

Yes the traditional method may yield a better texture... that is assuming that everything goes according to plan and you don't add one micro liter per second too much butter or that you don't curdle your egg yokes with a lemon that is slightly more acidic than your average lemon. However if you've got your in-laws coming over and you don't have any extra eggs to start over with, this is your recipe. It will yield fool proof results that are a tasty facsimile of hollandaise. I made it with an immersion blender in the blender cup that came with and at first I thought that I had made a bad choice but it came together wonderfully.

I am not sure why this is so well reviewed. I made it exactly according to the recipe, and I found it anemic and mayonnaise-y. I might make it again with more eggs, but as written it's not a good substitute for a real hollandaise.

Wait...Hollandaise is supposed to be hard and tedious to make right? But this wasn't. It was easy. And delicious. I substituted regular salted butter and omitted the 1/2 teaspoon of salt but otherwise made according to the recipe. Delicious!

I cut the butter in half and juiced a 1/2 large lemon, also added dill. Easy and quick to make. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Blender-Hollandaise-101869#ixzz1HMfNqKdI

This was excellent and easy, especially for my first Hollandaise! I did cut down on the butter a bit and added fresh dill.

This isn't exactly like a classic Hollandaise but it's very delicious. I added an extra yolk because I was worried it would be too buttery. I started with the recommended amounts of lemon juice and cayenne but ended up adding extra afterwards as well as a bit of dill to up the flavor. I think white pepper and maybe a tad of Dijon would be great additions as well. The texture and thickness were great. I don't think I'll ever bother with the double boiler nonsense again; this recipe was so easy and quick, and when you're trying to turn out a big batch of eggs Benedict the timing really matters!

Well, here's the deal: when it comes to a REAL hollandaise, where you hold that bitch of a stainless steel bowl over a double boiler or candle or what-the-blank-ever, and whisk yolks with lemon juice and a dab o' tabasco and salt and white pepper, then do the "clarified butter drizzle", my abridged review is that this is mediocre - probably my favorite is at Mama's Royal here in Oakland. BUT, making the real stuff - separating the eggs, whisking away all retarded-like, and then having to deal with a product that's about as tempermental as Britney Spears... WAYYY too much work for this old man. The blender goo holds up much better too, so it totally gets my vote. This is the "too-hot-for-epicurious" review.

Rating: 4
A perfefctly stressless way to startle everyone with a lovely classic! I would also suggest not to be thrifty with the lemon, one might try some lime juice (fish) or dijon mustard (beef) as well... I feel like I'll walk into my kitchen NOW ;.) THANKS; GREAT ONE!

I usually am not a fan of shortcuts and prefer to spend the time to do things the traditional way, but this recipe is fantastic! I have made hollandaise in the traditional way in the past, but found it incredibly labor intensive with poor results (my fault, I am sure). This recipe is incredibly easy and perfect in taste and in texture. I also added an additional 1 tsp. of lemon juice to get the right balance - it depends on how tart your lemons are, I suppose. The thermos idea to keep it warm is a great one.

Oh my god! This recipe is outstanding. Easy, delicious, super-impressive, and fantastic. No clarifying of butter, no hot water baths, no whisks... wow! I used to chef, and I can tell you that old school is usually the right school... Escoffier wasn't the grand master for nothing. I actually made a killer Bernaise, substiting the tarragon/wine/vinegar reduction for lemon, and my guests sucked it all down on top of the poached salmon.

This was close to perfect hollandaise, and certainly easier than making it the traditional way! On the suggestion of other reviewers(and based on other recipes) I too added an additional teaspoon of lemon juice. The flavor and texture were great. One tip for those who were unhappy with the temperature - let the egg yolks and cream come to room temperature before making the sauce. It was still just short of hot enough, but it was close. (By the way, I'm not the earlier "cook from Philly" with the rude review).

Rating: 3
The sauce was delicious and very easy to make, so for those two reasons alone I am grateful. However, the sauce was not hot enough. I used the Cook's Illustrated method of storing it in a pre-heated thermos while I poached the eggs. It wasn't really hot to begin with, though. The flavor and consistency were perfect, but it just wasn't hot enough. I think I might try this method and THEN heat it over a double boiler (still much easier than traditional hollandaise). And I agree, the amount of butter called for was too much. Next time I will use less, especially since the butter doesn't seem to heat the sauce enough to begin with.

Rating: 4
This was so easy and impressive looking. Tasted great, too. I cut the amount of butter in half- just couldn't bring myself to use THAT MUCH BUTTER. Also replaced cream w/sour cream and used 1/2 the salt. Yum!

I think it might have been good if it had thickened up for me! I don't know what I did wrong! I read all the reviews, used my vitamix, added a bit of dijon. I didn't microwave the butter but it was boiling on the stove seconds before I added it. SOOO disappointed...what a horrible waste of half a pound of butter.

This is Great, I tried it with the peppers and dijon, didn't have any cream so i hit it with some sour cream, it was as I said Great

Rating: 3
Perhaps my blade spins on too high a speed, but this sauce came out a bit thicker than I might have liked -- adding a little water helped, but maybe less processing, or even the use of a whisk instead of a blade, would have perfected the sauce. Wonderful flavor, however, especially when the amount of lemon juice was upped slightly. I also used unsalted sweet cream butter and about 3/4 tsp of salt to compensate.

Rating: 4
This is impossible to screw up, but difficult to scale down. Next time I make it I'll just make the whole recipe and save the rest in a styro cup for later. I used 1/2 and 1/2 and it was fine. Next time: a wee tarragon. Delicious!

I have enver made hollandaise before b/c I had heard that it was time consuming and required all of your attention. This was very good and ridiculously simple to make. I too added more lemon juice, didn't have cream so used buttermilk instead, added a tsp of dijon and then about 2-3 T jalapeno for some zip. It came out exactly as I had hoped!! And man is this good on a lobster scramble.

Excellent and will make again. My husband had never had homemade Hollandaise and raved over it. It was the easiest I had ever made. Only thing that I did different was add a little more lemon, about a teaspoon more. I served it over asparagus. It also has a very smooth texture and stays where you put it, unlike the nasty packaged instant types. It's definitely worth taking the little bit of time to make for your family.

No doubt that this is a great product which is even better when you consider the work to result ratio, especially if you melt the butter in the microwave. I used only 1 1/3 stick of butter (and could use even less), used tarragon vinegar (what? Hollandaise without tarragon?!?!), a bigger dash of cayenne, a small dash of Worchester and even the blasphemous skim milk instead of cream. Experiment! You will be looking for things to put this on!

VitaMix machine owners need only throw everything in and voila! I paired this Hollandaise sauce with asparagus and received numerous enthusiastic reviews at Thanksgiving dinner. Very importantly, my dear husband gave two thumbs up. N.B. To take the edge off of the white vinegar, I increased the milk to 1/2 cup. The flavours melded perfectly, to say nothing of the velvety texture.

i was cooking just for myself, so i tried to make a reduced quantity with poor results--bad flavor and too runny. i later found a note in joy of cooking which recommends against making blender hollandaise in small quantities b/c there is not enough heat to cook the egg yolks w/o the double boiler. i'll try again and report back.

Rating: 3
For fast/easy, this is really good hollandaise, but its definitely not the "precious" result that comes from the traditional double-boiler method. The trick to this receipe is getting the melted butter really hot in the microwave, so that when you add the butter, the heat kinda cooks the egg yolks in the blender. Also, I only used about half the butter called for, but it came out good enough to coat an Eggs Benny I did this weekend.

Oh man, this is the best tasting hollandaise sauce I have made yet. And I get to make it in the blender - Brilliant!! It is so quick and easy. It came out silky and creamy.

I have made several different versions of these and two of my favorites are the following. Omit the lemon juice and instead add the juice of half an orange. This is really delicious and the sauce is far better textured. The other version is to add the lemon juice as in the original recipe but in the end also add half a roasted red pepper with a dash of chilli powder. The latter version I used for grilled salmon and its also delicious. I tried doing this recipe without the cream as I have seen in other recipes but I couldn't get the sauce to thicken properly so I will use the tbsp of cream called for in this recipe. For me, it made the difference between a very good hollandaise to one I had to throw out completely.

I placed the ingredients in a bowl and used my immersion blender, and it worked well. This seems failsafe - I've never made Hollandaise the traditional way, but this was very easy. It was to accompany a crabmeat omelet, so I added Old Bay, dill, and a dash of worcestershire sauce. Yum!

This recipe was great! It's obvious that the only person who didn't like this recipe must have made it improperly because everyone else seems to have had the same, great, experience I did. The trick is getting the butter sizzling. I didn't have any lemon so I used fresh squeezed lime juice instead and it was terrific. Next time I'm going to add some dill weed and serve with poached salmon. This is definitely a keeper!

Having recently converted to a low-carb diet (meat, cheese, eggs, oils, etc), I was ready to try my first Hollandaise sauce. This was superb, especially given the ease of preparation. I baked lobster tails and steamed asparagus for quick-prep Valentine's Day entree, serving them on top of a pool of Hollandaise. And as many of us know, a good cleanup is to wipe any excess possible from your blender with a paper towel or used paper dinner napkin. Put a bit of dish detergent in the blender, add extremely hot water about halfway, and blend it on a high speed. One hopes that if you run hot water to begin with in your sink drain, then pour this remaining bit of fat suspended in hot soapy water from your blender down the drain, chased by more hot water, it should minimize the gradual buildup of grease in your plumbing over the years.

I love this hollandaise. I have made it about 4 times so far and it always comes out a tad different every time but always delicious and super quick. I make it with half and half or low fat milk. I microwave it for about 10 seconds or so before serving to make it a little thicker and warm. YUM

This was a poor substitute for the cooked version. The taste of raw egg and butter was overwhelming. I'm usually a pretty inventive cook when it comes to "saving" a recipe, but this was hopeless as hollandaise.
