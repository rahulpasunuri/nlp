I've been making this recipe for my annual holiday party for year -- probably since 2001 if the recipe didn't originate earlier. Was freaking out when I couldn't find the well worn index card with the recipe glued on. In my years of experience, I've learned that rubbing off the hazelnut skins makes little difference, and/or you can substitute a different nut with not much difference since the flavor doesn't come through. It is really rich and will feed an army. And you can make it well in advance and then just cut them up and serve on the day. But it's true, they aren't really truffles, more like delicious chocolate morsels.

they were good, but didn't have as much hazelnut flaver as expected. my ganache after sitting in the fridge for 7 hours was still a bit soft, and separated from the top when I was cutting them. Also it really would have tasted better if it had been coated in the ganache instead of just having a think layer on top. I might make them again and actually roll them since just cutting them turned out poorly.

These were delicious and will become a new addition to my Christmas baking and giftgiving. Everyone who tried them, loved them. Rich, but not too sweet and if you're a novice truffle maker, they are a breeze. I didn't have hazelnuts onhand and used another nut with great success. I too used the foil(I use this technique for many of my bar cookies) Sure makes cutting these quick work. Good quality chocolate is a must with these so don't skimp on quality.

Wonderful if mis-named. Theyre not so much truffles as they are truffle tarts. Perhaps Im exposing my chocoholism, but I didnt find these to be too rich at all. The hazelnut crust cuts the sweet of the ganache quite nicely. I was short on time, so I chilled them in the freezer and it worked just fine. I didnt have to fuss with the wiping of the thin knife either. I just removed the whole chilled block from the pan in one piece, then divided into cubes with my Santuku. Next time I make these, I think Ill cut them with my smallest, round biscuit cutter and save the scraps for the chef.

Delicious. The saving grace of this recipe is that you can only handle a tiny piece. They're incredibly rich and dense, and it makes sense to serve these when you're hosting a big crowd. I've made these twice now, once for a big New Year's Eve party, and again this past weekend when I doubled the recipe for our housewarming party with 200 guests. Skip the hazelnut skinning process. I used blanched almonds and they worked just fine. People couldn't believe I'd made them myself.

Delicious recipe, however, I did not find that hazelnut skins rub off easily with a kitchen towel. As a matter of fact, I found this part of the recipe so tedious and frustrating that I probably won't make them again.

Allow enough time to prepare ahead. Freezes well and tastes good right out of the freezer. A rich treat worthy of a small portion.

this was one of the most wonderful desserts ever!! not too sweet and fairly easy to make. the only drawback is the amount of time involved, but in the end it is worth it!!!!

I make these all the time. I don't care for hazelnuts so I use almonds instead. I love the dense fudgy bottom layer and the rich dense top layer! So good. Everyone always loves them. I'm making them for a wedding reception in February.

I made these for a holiday party and most guests only had one piece. They are very rich, but I was disappointed that they didn't have more hazelnut flavor. Also, the base crumbled very easily making for messy eating. Maybe a did something wrong? Needless to say I have a ton left over! They were good ... but for the time invested not worth the effort.

Very good and not too sweet, though quite rich! I too made the hazelnut base completely in the Cuisinart. Most guests didn't eat more than two pieces over the course of three hours. I will need to throw out the rest or gain ten pounds this week...

This is so easy and yummy. I made the entire truffle mixture in my cuisinart. The recipe didn't make 80 pieces. I guess I cut them too big.

I sent this with my husband to the office and everyone loved it! I, too, lined the pan with foil making removal from the pan a breeze. With this method slicing them into small pieces was not a problem.

Good make-ahead dessert. I lined the pan with foil so I could take out the entire block before cutting. Also, cutting was very easy; no need to warm up the chef's knife or wipe it off each time. To take this to the 4-fork level, I would want a stronger hazelnut flavor and less chocolate.

I have made this recipe several times now. It is easy to make (it does take a little time though) and it has been a great hit each time I have served the truffles. I like the two textures of the bottom layer and the ganache and the way they look with the smooth texture on top and the hazelnut base. I did however, decide to call them "hazelnut biscotti truffles" since the base comes out tasting much like fresh chocolate biscotti. This also gives people the right idea about what to expect.

I was a little disappointed in these because I think the name is somewhat deceiving. They are not so much truffles as they are little brownies with ganache on top (which, in fairness, I did realize before I made them). Taken for what they are, they are quite good, not too sweet, and very rich. There is something so good about that chocolate, hazelnut combination.

What a beautiful and delicious truffle! This will will be a permanent addition to my holiday cookie gift-baskets! Be sure to use a good quality chocolate in these--Vahlrona is worth every penny!

These truffles are great and easy to make. I substituted 1/2 cup toasted walnuts and 1/2 cup dried cranberries for the hazelnuts and they came out great. I may add some orange zest next time. I think the truffles would taste great with all different kinds of substitutions, peppermint candies, almonds, candided coffee beans, etc...
