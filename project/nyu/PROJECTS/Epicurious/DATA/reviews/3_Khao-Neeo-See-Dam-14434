I went to Thailand last summer and had this dish at several Thai restaurants and guest houses. Also spent a couple of days taking cooking lessons. I've thrown several dinner parties with a Thai theme since I've been back, and this dish has been a star at every one. It is extremely easy to prepare (though you have to start ahead to soak the rice)--and really represents the flavor of Thailand well. They eat this for breakfast, but I served it for dessert. Served with fresh DelMonte Gold extra-sweet pineapple (the best pinapple ever...), mango, star fruit, and strawberries. And it does look beautiful and appetizing!

I would have liked the coconut flavor to come through more clearly...loved the color!

I recommend try this black sticky rice with young coconut and coconut milk,like Thai do. Or mix it with cooked taro and cocnut milk.

This is an excellant dish, if you are not wanting something horribly sweet. Don't be scared of black rice. It brings a wonderful nutty suprise to your course. Mangos are a wonderful accompliment, but fruit is not necessary to enjoy the harmony of the rice and the coconut milk.
