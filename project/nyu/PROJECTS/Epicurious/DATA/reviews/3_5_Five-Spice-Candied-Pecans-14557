Not the best candied nuts I've made, because they never got crispy. Flavor was nice, but I would cook the sugar syrup much longer next time before adding the nuts so they actually get caramelized.

Thought I wouldn't like these, and realized I'd chain-eaten about a third of the results while I was thinking about it! I found it easiest just to use an oversized piece of parchment paper, sponged with oil, on the baking sheet, and then you can just let the nuts cool on the same sheet you baked them on, stirring them periodically as they cool to keep them from getting stuck.

Really easy and really good! Just the right balance of sweet/salty/spicy, and not overly sweet. These are like crack, totally addictive! I made to give out as holiday treats, but kept a few for myself. Great with fall/winter salads or a cheese and fruit plate.

good with just cayenne instead of five spice.

Our family makes and sends these as gifts every year - we've been doing it for about 7 years now. I have only made some minor adjustments over the years - I use coarse sea salt instead of table salt in the same proportion; I add 1/4 to 1/2 cup more nuts per batch to help with the goo factor, and I usually add almonds into the recipe since they are great with the flavoring too. The point about spreading them out in the pan in critical - if you crowd them, they never bake right and tend to stay sticky. Any leftovers get tossed into salads on a regular basis, like a previous reviewer mentioned. These things are ADDICTIVE.

Tasty and pretty simple, though not perfect. I thought they were a little too salty, but a dash of cayenne might have made them more interesting. Also, be careful they dont scorch! Will try this again with mentioned changes.

The 5 spice is a perfect compliment to pecans. This was easy to make as well. I found my pecans to be kind of sticky rather than hard, but I'll be making this again.

I thought these were great. Haven't found a sole that didn't love them too!

Just a few suggestions...the 5-spice is a bit overwhelming on it's own...I added 1 teaspoon each of cayenne/chipolte, allspice and papprika...YUMMM! Introduce dry ingredients slowly to syrup making sure it is completely dissolved. DO NOT use maple syrup or honey. The nuts never dry completely and you don't get the crispy crunch once nuts are dried to room temp. To prevent the nuts from getting too gooey (from water/suger), pour only enough mixture to COAT the nuts! Drying the nuts on a mesh rack or wax paper helps too.

I only made half of the recipe. Instead of making the syrup of sugar and water, I used 2 Tbls of maple syrup. This avoided any gooeyness. Next time I'll bake at 350 and turn them over in 4-5 minutes. I think what others find cloying is the clove in the 5 spice. They were a hit served as an after dinner snack with sliced apples and stilton.

I have made various iced nut recipes, but the five-spice powder makes this one the most unusual. The taste is too cloying and strong for me, but I'm sure some people would love it. My sister felt the same way, but then tried them as a salad topping and found that they are amazingly good that way. Like another reviewer, I baked 12 mins instead of 8, but there was still too much liquid, as I found out later. It just wouldn't dry and was gooey, so I had to return it to the oven for yet more time. I'm thinking I should have used a larger pan to help the liquid dry out; I used one with a 68 sq in bottom. BTW, this recipe was very easy and hardly messy at all compared to other nut recipes. FYI, five-spice powder usually contains equal parts cinnamon, cloves, fennel seed, star anise, and Szechwan peppercorns.

These were wonderful and super fast and easy to make. I couldn't keep the dish full for my guests!

Thank goodness for the internet - I thought I had lost this recipe. I have made these for parties and everyone raves about them. No one can guess the secret ingredient. I love them!

Very good--my favorite candied nut, and lots easier than complicated candy-thermometer recipes. The 5-Spice powder adds a great flavor. I baked them 12 minutes instead of 8, but that may have just been my oven. Otherwise, a perfect recipe--I plan to use them as holiday nibbles as well as a garnish on a perfect individual ice cream sundae. I can also see them studding a cake. . .

Everyone who tried them liked them. We like them on salads.

This is the only receipe from Gourmet that I have ever hated! I thought the taste was cloying and just didn't like it at all.
