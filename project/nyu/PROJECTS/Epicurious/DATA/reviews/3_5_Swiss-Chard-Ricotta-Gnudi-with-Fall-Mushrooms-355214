I thought the gnudi were great; following reviews, I placed them in simmering water and didn't have any problems with them breaking up. They cooked perfectly. Unfortunately, I thought the broth and accompanying mushrooms didn't complement well. No one like the chard stems. With the left over cooked gnudi, I'm going to try and freeze them and reuse them in a simple sage and brown butter sauce or in some other type of dish.

This was wonderful! I substituted minced leeks for the chard & made a vegetarian, leek infused, broth. I also used 1/3 chestnut flour, which imparted a woodsy, autumnal note that was fantastic with the earthy mushrooms. Thanks, Richard, for the sage & brown butter saute idea, that was also delish!

Thought this would be a good one to try since some of my favorite ingredients were in this recipe and I've never dared to make gnocchi. I did my research, read the reviews which I found to be very helpful. I did not have much time, so as suggested I used an easier gnudi recipe which required no overnight prep : http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Ricotta-Gnocchi-242001 and added red chili flakes, and garlic to the sauce. And finished it with a spoon of white truffle oil.. it was fantastico!

This recipe is tasty. What I liked: the flavor! Also, the fact that the main components are assembled at the end makes it easy to omit the mushrooms, rather than pick them out (my husband hates them, so more for me). I did all the prep for this recipe on Sunday (took about an hour), and then was able to throw it all together in about 25 minutes on Monday night. The only change I made to the original recipe was omitting 2T of butter from the broth, and it was still rich and fantastic. What I'll do differently next time: really pay attention to the instructions which have you press every last bit of moisture out of the chard before processing. My dumplings were delicious but fell apart easily, probably from too much moisture. I might also add extra flour to make sure they hold up next time. This is hearty, healthy, comfort food.

These were intense! I substituted 1/2 goat cheese and 1/2 tofu ricotta for the whole milk ricotta and it actually worked just fine - but I still found these a little heavy/rich. Other reviewers are right, you need to leave them alone while they cook; they will shed some bits into the water but shouldnt' fall apart.

While everything is the recipe was fine and the gnudis came out as they should, we did not enjoy this at all. I might try making the gnuids again but with a different sauce.

These were delicious. The sticky dough made forming the gnudis a bit of a challenge. It seemed like they would melt into the simmering water, but keep the faith. They actually cooked up very nicely. I had enough gnudi left over that we were able to enjoy them the next morning gently sauteed with sage and brown butter, which was even better than the broth and mushroom presentation.

This recipe needs help! I wonder if it has been tested first. Using the exact ingredients and amounts did not work for me at all. I even upped the amount of flour by 1/4 cup but the gnudi still turned to mush when I tried to cook them. The broth tastes great, and the mushrooms too, but the chard stem matchsticks were like eating twigs. I would say this recipe needs some tweaking. I have some gnudi mix left over so hopefully it will turn out better with a few adjustments.

This is such a rich and satisfying dish that one can serve it with a simple side salad and not miss the meat. I ended up adding another 1/4 cup or so of flour to the gnudi dough to make it stay shape, and they came out perfectly formed and light in consistency. I also added a teaspoon of truffle oil to the broth/sauce, which just added a luxuriousness that really brought it up a bit. Perfect.

I made this for guests last night, and it was really great. I took the advice of a previous poster, and kept the water to a bare simmer, if that. The gnudi sat in the bottom, and I learned quickly to resist the temptation to poke at them, and keep my spoon away, to let them cook undisturbed. I was really afraid they would come apart into the water, but in the end, they were fine. The only alteration I did was to use Imagine's No Chicken broth and Mushroom broth instead of chicken broth since I was cooking for vegetarians.

Whenever I make gnocchi or another type of dumpling, I always test one out first to make sure the dough will hold together in the simmering water, especially if it is a new recipe. If the test dumpling falls apart, add a bit more flour and try again. Also, the water should be at a healthy simmer, not a rolling boil which may cause the dough to fall apart. Chilling the dough is also important, but I simmered the gnudi in batches so as not to bring the water temperature down too much. I thought this was a delicious recipe; all I added was garlic.

This recipe was a lot of work, although it was pretty tasty. The dumplings came out pretty well, I didn't really have too much trouble with them. I rolled them more like larger gnocchi, dropped them into boiling water and I did boil them a little longer than suggested, fearing that they would be a little tough. My husband says this recipe is a keeper, but I think he liked the gnudi the best.

Here are a lot of wonderful flavors that should work together, and do, if you ignore the fact that the dumplings completely fell apart during the boiling process. If anyone else has any luck cooking the dumplings, please let me know. Directions state, "boil", and I waited the requisite amount of time refrigerating the dough, but nonetheless, they disentegrated in the water while boiling. A great broth, though...any helpful suggestions would be appreciated.
