I had these as an appetizer in a restaurant and was excited to find this recipe so I could try it at home. Unfortunately it just didn't work out. High heat seems to be important here and my electric stove and generic pan just wasn't generating enough. Mine came out soggy.

Messy to make and boring? I didn't find it so. These were as easy as frozen french fries and much, much tastier. I had some leftover, so the next day I added some cooked shredded chicken and a dab of sour cream for a delicious packed lunch. This is a recipe worth playing with!

I make the Caribbean version of this recipe - but with a pre-made seasoning: mince garlic, cilantro and a habanero pepper with about a tablespoon of salt and transfer to a large bowl. after you fry the chickpeas and pat them dry, toss them in with the seasoning and coat them thoroughly. the added spices give it a great kick.

oh yuck. It was messy to make and very boring to eat despite the smoked paprika.
