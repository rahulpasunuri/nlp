This is a go to recipe ! Can decide sides based on which vingerette you choose. I prefer the Mediterranean vinaigrette to the Asian but both are great. It is well worth the brining !

I gave this four stars for the recipe as I made it and I did change it up a bit. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I used the Mediterranean vinegarette and while I tried rosemary, I originally used basil as the herb (about 2-3 TBS.) and it was so much better than the vinegarette with rosemary. I didn't use a full tsp. of red pepper flakes, either. My husband told me 5 times how good it was. Brining is essential, it makes the chicken so moist. I will never, ever grill chicken again without brining first. Even an hour in the brine would be better than no brining at all.

I doubled the receipe for a larger group and it worked well. Added a bit more red pepper flakes for some zing. Everyone raved about it. Chicken was moist and flavorful.

Simply amazing! Only had time to brine the chicken for a couple hours, but it still had tons of flavor. Decided to leave the salt out of the vinigarette, and didn't miss it at all. Will definitely be making again and again!

Rating: 4
Utterly delicious. I had boneless skinless breasts so tweaked the preparation by brining for only two hours and also skewered the chicken. SO GOOD. I was dubious about naked un-marinated chicken hitting the grill, especially with a group of good cooks coming over for dinner. And I thought the sauce was.... interesting. After grilling, however, it all came together for a juicy, gorgeous presentation (grilled limes on platter added to the beauty) and the sauce was phenomenal! Every last bite was eaten  a success!

This is a great recipe -- a definite crowd pleaser! I've done the fish sauce -- weird-sounding but delicious-- but my go-to is the Mediterranean one at the bottom of the recipe. You can't go wrong!

This has been my go-to bbq recipe for years. So good, so tasty, so smart to dunk in sauce after cooking. For the fish sauce detractors, anchovies, which are the main ingredient, are also prominent in Worcester sauce. They just lend an earthiness - you would never know it is fish based.

Absolutely insanely good, sensational flavors. I tripled the recipe for 13 people (adults and kids) and the only thing that remained was one chicken wing. The fish sauce adds just the right tang. This is now a staple in our home.

Made this chicken today. Brining it took a long time but I would do it again. The sauce was a bit weird, to me it tasted like chopped up grass. I personally didn't love it but my guests thought it was good. .

May have saved my marriage with this one. I am new to the stay-at-home dad scenario and have been slipping with having meals ready or at least planned when my wife gets home from work. This recipe is easy (as long as you plan ahead with the brining) and almost foolproof. Paired with a great salad this makes a fantastic meal. My only substitution: I didn't have fish sauce but went out on a limb and substituted a little less clam sauce, because I had it, and it was delicious.

This is a staple in my house. We love it. If I think grilled chicken, this is the dish. Don't be afraid of the fish sauce - really gives this dish a special tang/bite. It's all about the sauce, people.

Left out the cilantro b/c I didn't have it. This is the bomb recipe! For the brine: don't need to boil and all that... use a cup of hot water to dissolve a bunch of salt and some sugar then add to cold water and soak chicken. even just an hour is good! use the fish sauce. it will NOT taste fishy! promise! This is delicious and no particular flavor is overpowering. Definitely a go-to recipe and you can make the marinade in advance. Wow!

Rating: 4
This recipe really is foolproof, together will the suggestions from other reviews. As others have said, I'll never make chicken in any other way again. I also boiled 1/3 of the water and then added cold. Only marinated chicken for 30 min and still came out juicy and moist - can't wait to make it again and marinate for longer! Left out the fish sauce and the cilantro from the vinaigrette (don't really like either) and my husband loved it so much he poured it over the grilled eggplant as well. Will make again soon!

Finally, I am able to grill chicken that doesn't come out dry. The vinaigrette really adds flavor to the dish.

This chicken was great. I had never brined chicken before and it really made a difference in flavor and texture. Like other reviewers, I rinsed the chicken before grilling. Also, I used the original vinaigrette recipe, but added more garlic and other fresh herbs from garden (tarragon & oregano). Can't wait to try the Mediterranean version. A definite repeat!

Rating: 3
This was very good. I don't know if it was the brining or the vinagrette that made it so delicious. (I used the Mediterranean vinagrette). I did find just wiping the brining away left it too salty. I will rinse it off next time.

Made it with breasts, and used the original vinaigrette. Loved it! Wife and 3 kids loved it! Brining is the key.Only one suggestion, rinse after brining, it reduces the saltiness.

Wow! Incredible. I was only able to let it soak in the brine for about an hour. I rinsed the thighs off and then cooked them on our gas grill. I usually have problems w/flare ups, so I covered the grill with heavy duty tin foil and this made it much easier to cook without burning. I cooked the chicken without the marinade since one of my sons can be a bit picky. He used BBQ sauce instead. But the marinade was heavenly! Fresh and tangy! The chicken was so juicy and wonderful. I will always use this method in the future. I can't wait to try it on my parents!

I pre brined the chicken and took it on a family camping trip. Made the Mediterranean vinaigrette in advance by putting all the ingredients in a well sealed jar and just shook it to emulsify the ingredients once needed.Only had dried rosemary on hand and it worked just fine.Also added a shallot to the vinaigrette to keep it from languishing in the fridge whilst vacationing;). This recipe is a thing of beauty overall and especially the detailed instructions on how to grill using gas and charcoal. Made this city girl look like an outdoor grilling pro. Re: the boiled vs uncooked brine versions. Normally I only bother to cook the brine when it has many complex seasonings that need to be extracted with heat. Wolfgang Puck's brined turkey recipe fits the boiled brine criteria for me as a perfect example. Recipe is offsite at: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/wolfgang-puck/brined-roast-turkey-with-pan-gravy-recipe/index.html. As a heads up, this is my "secret technique" and recipe for making a succulent T-Day bird for the last 4-5 years;). For a simple sugar, salt and liquid brine such as listed here...yep using 1/4 of the boiled water to salt and sugar mixed w/ the remaining iced or cold water makes the process faster and doesn't change the final flavour in my experience. Happy brining, people, and know that this recipe is a true keeper!

Rating: 4
Love this recipe! Like another reviewer I made the brine by boiling only 1QT water with the sugar and salt, then mixed in the 3 QT water,much easier. I was hesitant by not "marinating" the chix with the sauce, but so glad I waited and poured the sauce on the chix just before serving!

If you're not crazy about the sauce, try using the sauce with the Grilled Chicken with Lemon, Garlic, and Oregano recipe on this site. Loved the lemon and garlic flavor. Also, next time I make this I'll rinse the chicken after brining it. It was a bit too salty for me. The chicken, however, was tender and done just right. Great way to grill chicken. I'll always use this method.

Even though I had to bake the chicken in the oven (it was pouring out), the chicken was moist and even more delicious than I'd imagined. The marinade was tasty but I look forward to using a homemade BBQ sauce on them next time.

This was a great grilled chicken recipe. I have struggled with either dry or undercooked bone-in chicken on the grill. This came out moist and flavorful. Not to mention that it is actually "foolproof". My husband didn't clean the grease trap under the grill recently, and when he began grilling the chicken, I looked out the window and saw flames shooting up and out the back of the grill. I grabbed the baking soda and went running. In my haste, I dumped some baking soda on the chicken. I rinsed it off and after everything was cleaned up and put back together, we finished the chicken. Delicious! Yes, definitely foolproof!

Rating: 4
Delicious! I'll echo most of what others have said before me. --Mint-- I tried this the first time without mint (didn't have any), and it was wonderful. The second time with the mint was even better. The mint smoothed out the edges and blended it all together. The end result does not taste like mint, just like yumm! Still unsure? Add the mint after you've tossed most of your chicken, and toss the last couple in it. You'll see the difference. --Brining-- The brining process makes the chicken inconceivably moist and delicious. I'll never again grill chicken without brining it first. Here's the quick-brine method I used, which was wonderful. Disolve the salt and sugar in 1 quart of hot water, then add 3 quarts of cold water. This won't need to cool. Also, I only brined for 2h each time and it came out incredible. --Saltiness-- If you don't pat dry the chicken, then it will be quite salty. Patting the water off the chicken takes the salt with it. If you let the chicken dry (like in the chill chest), the salt doesn't evaporate, and stays on the chicken. --Sauce-- If you are going to grill chicken this vinaigrette is an absolutely delicious accompaniment to the smoky and charred grilled chicken. I tossed half of my last batch of chicken in plain old barbecue sauce, and it was really good as well. Pretty much any marinade, sauce, or vinaigrette you can think of will be best served with this recipe's technique. --Summary-- I'll make this again, and again, and again. I'll try different sauces on occasion, but just can't stay away from the vinaigrette as written.

I made this recipe with a grass-fed chicken from our local farmers market. I'm not sure if I loved the chicken or the vinaigrette more! The vinaigrette had the perfect balance of flavors and the perfect level of spice (not too hot). I've never seen a recipe that calls for both mint and cilantro - but found the 2 flavors very complimentary. Love it!

I LOVE this recipe! I've made it many times and every time my guests ask for the recipe. Let me share a secret with you. YOU DO NOT NEED TO BOIL THE LIQUID (BRINE) AND BRING TO ROOM TEMPERATURE. What I did is disolve the sugar and salt in some hot water (maybe a cup or two) and then add it to your cool water.....it was save you a lot of trouble. If you follow the recipe, you almost need to boil the brine the day before, cool it in the fridge and then add your chicken....way too much planning. This recipe is delicious and I would recommend making extra sauce.....I did cut back slightly on the fish sauce....instead of 4 T for the double back, I did 3.5 T. Hope this info helps.

I made this for a summer BBQ on the grill with the Asian vinaigrette. It was a rave. Very moist and tender throughout and the flavors were great. I made 16 lbs of breasts, thighs and drumsticks but will probably only do breasts next time (with skin and bones). They were even better as leftovers the next day.

Rating: 4
BTW, I really recommend using foil pans to cover the chicken pieces while cooking as recommended in the accompanying article. It seems fussy but I think it's part of the reason the chicken stays moist and un-blackened.

Rating: 4
This chicken really shatters notions of what grilled chicken is like. Instead of dry and tasteless, this chicken is juicy and the asian dressing has a great flavor. People are always suspicious of the ingredients in the dressing but they love it once they try it. I usually halve the amount of mint because it can overwhelm the cilantro. It's very tasty on day 2 as well, if you have leftovers.

Was this the best grilled chicken recipe ever? Not even close. The brine was essential in keeping the moisuture during the grilling, but the sauce was a snoozer. In the future, I'll keep the brine method, but pick a more flavorful sauce. I know, the ingredients would indicate that it would be very flavorful - but I'm a pretty decent cook and made it exactly according to the recipe - yawn. The 13 people at my BBQ agreed - gotta love candid and wonderful friends.

divine! brined for 4 hours, then rinsed and patted dry. grilled beautifully. unfortunately I only had safflower oil to use in the vinaigrette, which had a strong flavor, so I wound up adding a whole bunch more lime juice, fish sauce, soy sauce and sugar to balance everything out. but it came out great in the end and everybody raved!

Did I use the wrong type of fish sauce? I used a store brand fish sauce that is labeled as "extra virgin: seasons almost any savory dish or stir-fry." It smells and tastes EXTREMELY fishy. Needless to say, I whisked up the sauce, tasted it, and threw it away before putting on the chicken. Luckily, I had another sauce in the refrigerator to save the meal!

THE BEST GRILLED CHICKEN! I have made this five times now - for anywhere from 5 to 40 people - amazing every time. It's the standard in our house now. I suppose the only reason I didn't rate it sooner is because I was too busy eating! Just do it the way it says, and you will not go wrong.

i went through the trouble to register on epicurious only to say that this recipe is wonderful -- best chicken i've ever made. storm clouds came in so i roasted instead of grilled, but still amazing. i spread the vinaigrette on 1/2-way through cooking to subdue the spice a bit as one of my guests had a sensitive palate.

My boyfriend loves this chicken, so I make it on a regular basis. Brining is definitely the way to go; it makes the chicken so tender. I usually omit the mint, but add much more garlic and cilantro, since those are 2 of our favorite ingredients. The lime juice and fish sauce (a staple in every Asian household) adds a distinct saltiness and flavor to the vinaigrette.

A very nice brine and dressing -- nice flavor combinations. I took the breast and thigh off the bones before cooking and took all the skin off after cooking but before serving, as a matter of personal preference. Even the breast stayed extremely moist and tender, as only brined, grilled chicken can be. This is a keeper, both as a recipe to use directly and as a model for brines -- keep the salt, sugar, and water to these proportions and do anything else you want with the other flavors.

I have made this recipe twice this summer for company both times and both times it has received rave reviews. I did not find it too salty - I did use Kosher salt which could make a difference. Perhaps those cooks who found it too salty did not use Kosher salt or did not rinse and pat the chicken dry before proceeding. If you follow the recipe, you will not be disappointed. To those who take shortcuts or cut out ingredients and then voice dissatisfaction, I say, please don't bother to offer a bad rating to a recipe unless you try it the way it is written first. I do enjoy hearing about ways people have improved recipes they find here but I find it misleading to denegrate something that was actually not prepared as written because it throws the entire rating system off.

My 14 year old daughter, who doesn't like anything, was ooo-ing and ah-ing over the smell of the vinaigrette, and as she ate it she said "This is as good as what you get in a restaurant". I loved the vinaigrette and the chicken was crisp on the outside, moist and very flavorful.

Not only is this recipe foolproof, it is the best method for adding flavor to grilled chicken I have ever encountered. Too often, marinades are weak and have no lasting flavor. By dressing the chicken *after* cooking, the flavors are fresh and explosive but not overpowering. I have made this at least six times, to rave reviews every time. Even when my barbecue erupted in flames b/c I had not cleaned it properly, the resulting carbon-encrusted bird was salvaged by the dressing!

I have made this recipe at least 10 times this summer. Every time I make it, it is like my guests become obsessed with this dish.

I didn't add the salt to the vinaigrette, and I kind of "winged it" as I didn't have lime (subbed lemon) or cilantro (subbed parsley and basil). Amazing and easy. The brining makes all the difference in the world. This is simple and delicious.

This recipe's flavor is outstanding. To avoid prior complaints of it being too oily, I brushed the mixture (generously) onto the chicken after grilling with 100% success. Brining made the chicken flavorful and moist. All you heard were guests surprised, happy remarks as they couldn't get enough! Definitely finger licking good!

This was a lot of work and I am not sure it was worth it. We have been having so much rain here that I could not get the grill to light, so I am not sure if results would have been different if I had been able to use the grill. In any case otherwise was able to follow it exactly. I was disappointed that the herbs did not stick to the chicken. And pouring them on at the table did not work as in my opinion; there was way too much oil. Next time, if there is one, I will brine, and grill then just dust pieces with the cilantro, mint, lime and garlic.

I made this recipe for a bridal shower and everyone raved about it. It is very simple, the brining is a great way to maintain moist chicken but be careful not to overcook the chicken on the BBQ (oops, I did on one batch). The vinagarette made the dish, even the overcooked pieces!!

It's the best! The mint-cilantro flavor is to die for. I did reduce the amount of oil by half, and it was still fantastic.

Outstanding. I only brined it for about 2 hours which was plenty and I didn't bother with hot water. The salt & sugar dissolved just fine in cool ordinary tap water. I thought the cooking time was a little long so I reduced it to about 23 minutes total and that was perfect. I admit I was skeptical about using the vinaigrette this way (just dipping the pieces in and not pouring it over them) but there was indeed plenty of flavor doing it this way. All in all a great recipe.

WOW! This was GREAT! I took the skin off the chicken and only brined it for hours, but otherwise, followed the directions to the T. I think brining it overnight would lead to salty chicken, so I can see why a previous cook was disappointed. I have 3 little ones, and one liked the chicken with the sauce, and the other 2 loved the chicken because it was so tender (without the sauce, of course, because they're kids!) I came back on to make a copy for my M-I-L, who was here when I served it. I loved how easy the prep was, and have sent out this recipe to many of my online friends! Great as leftovers, too!

Excellent! I used bone-in split chicken breasts. Prep is very easy once the brine has cooled which can be easily sped up by putting in the fridge. Make the brine in the evening, allow to cool and use the following day or make in the morning for use from noon on. I left chicken to brine for about 6 hrs. Definitely not too salty but I did use the Kosher salt. Maybe the excessive saltiness comes from using regular salt? We will definitely make again using a variety of rubs and sauces.

The prep time on this is too long. So I made the mixture with half the water and cooled it with ice. I brined the chicken for 2 hours instead of six. And because our grill caught on fire during prep, I broiled my bird. Served it with slaw and biscuits. Hubby and I enjoyed it, but we won't make it again.

The brining produced tender chicken that was great - not too salty, etc. The mediterranean take on the dressing however was just so-so, flavor wasn't intense enough to pair with the charcoal intensity of the grill. Next time I'll stick with the brine but experiment with the dressing/sauce.

Sorry, but I did not think this was anything too special. Instead of "brining" why not use a more flavourful marinade (what exactly is the difference between "brining" and "marinating"?) The meat had that bland salty wet taste that just reminded me way to much of KFC. I liked the dressing, but it was not an oh-wow finished product. And - you must be working with some lightweight decaf fools if this is foolproof - my S.O would have burnt the outside to a crisp during phase I, then left it raw in the centre during phase II with the instructions and time as written (hardcore fool). You want foolproof? Microwave it to 99% cooked, then present to S.O to proudly "BBQ" for the 2 minutes it takes to get it grilled looking. Saves company from cancerous carbon and salmonella threats, still allows him to seem competent.

I used the oven roasted method on leg quarters. Ran out of fish sauce so added a little soy sauce. Very good. The skin was crispy and salty and the meat was tender and juicy.

Great! Much easier than the recipe sounds. I broiled it in the oven and had no problems. I brined it for 6 hrs, but over night is better in my opinion. The vinegrette was simple but so tasty. I substited worchertershire sauce for the fish sauce. Will make again and cant wait to eat the leftover that are sitting in that yummy, unique sauce.

Woohoo! I brought this to a barbecue yesterday and people came up to me all day telling me how much they loved this chicken. From now on, I'll be brining all my chicken before grilling it. So tender and juicy!

Spectacular! This chicken was delicious and I used a "dual" cooking method. It would have taken forever for me to sear and grill all the chicken on my grill, so I seared all the chicken at one time on high for the recommended time and then I finished it in a 500 degree oven for 20 minutes. The finished product was delicious with the wonderful vinaigrette. By the way, I hope that "oyster sauce" is the same as fish sauce because I went to two grocers and it was the closest I came. If its not the same, trust me that it works fine!

This chicken recipe is, as it is labelled, "foolproof" and absolutely divine. I've made it twice now, following the recipe to the tee, and both times, the people to whom I served the chicken said it was the best chicken they'd ever had. One friend even loved the chicken plain, without the vinegarette. Definitely a keeper -- can't imagine doing bbq chicken any other way.

Who would ever think this recipe would turn out such a delectable dish? Awesome!

I guess I'm the exception to the reviews thus far, but it's probably my cooking technique. I thought it was okay but nothing great. The thighs and drumsticks were moist, but they normally are anyway because of the type of meat. The breasts were dry. I made the recipe precisely as directed (increased the chicken and brining fluid by 1/2). Brined overnight and made both sauces. The sauces were good, especially the mediterranean. Perhaps I overcooked the chicken breasts, but they were pretty pink ionside when I took them off the grill. Not sure what went wrong??

This was easy and tasty. I didn't bother with any special grilling instructions, just brined according to the recipe and added sauce. It was better reheated the next day after it sat soaking in the sauce overnight. Good for casual outdoor entertaining.

Perfect party fare. Make lots and serve with different sauces. Have plenty of napkins availble.All guests enjoyed this chicken. I used both vinaigrettes and also used a spicy honey mustard jalepeno sauce and traditional bottled BBQ sauce for the guest that requested it. Served with a huge green salad, garlic bread, and melon and gooey brownies for dessert.

I agree with the previous reviewer -- the brine does NOT have to be heated and chilled in order for the sugar and salt to dissolve. Just stir everything together and save the time. If I am brining a large quantity of chicken -- or a duck or turkey -- I often stir everything together in a large stock pot and add enough ice to keep the poultry at a safe temperature, and that way it stays safe and cool without taking up fridge space; just add ice periodically. Brining is good to do any time you are going to grill chicken. The earlier question about starting the chicken in the oven and finishing it on the grill is a good idea. If you have a charcoal grill like I do, partially cooking the chicken in the oven while the coals prepare is a great timesaver and insures a proper temperature for cooking, which sometimes can get iffy with charcoal.

Fabulous. However I followed a different brining recipe that was similar except that it didn't require the heating and chilling of the brine. Omitting that step is a time-saver. I brined a whole cut-up chicken overnight and followed Gourmet's recipe for grilling with a gas BBQ, I also used the vinaigrette recipe. The chicken was sooo tender and juicy. The flavour of the dressing was great although I omitted the salt and I'm glad that I did. It was plenty salty enough. Next time I'm going to use the brining and grilling technique with a traditional tomato based BBQ sauce-I'll bet It'll be great too. No more dry, boring grilled chicken for us!!! Thanks Gourmet.

After years of simply taking chicken from the package to the grill, I was a bit skeptical of the brining process, but it really is amazing how moist the chicken is after cooking. If you have the time, its definitely worth doing it this way.

Has anyone tried the oven-baked version? I won't have room on the grill for everything for a party, so I thought I'd bake it first, and then quickly put it on the gas grill at the last minute. Any reason why it wouldn't be as successful?

Brining, the secret to all truly yummy meats. Because I had them available, I threw a couple bratwursts and two pork chops into the brine as well and grilled them all! Unbelievable how tender and juicy the meat stays after grilling, even if you accidentally overgrill it. I had family over and they begged me to tell them how the meat got so flavorful. . . should I tell them??

Made it. Loved it. Juicy & flavorfull. Didn't use the vinegarette but substituted a good bottled one that I added chopped fresh herbs to. I have grilled for years, but never brined, but now it's my new favorite trick that I will use again and again. Yum. (I'm going to try that lime squeezing during grilling trick next for even more flavor.)

3 forks for the recipe, 1 fork for the entertaining reviews. A word about fishsauce . . .the flavor cannot be exactly duplicated because as the the fish cure in the sun, B vitamins are concentrated in the "sauce". The best substitute I have found is to add a small amount of anchovy paste to soy sauce. Add just enough paste to make the soysauce taste fishy. Anchovy paste is often found in the gourmet section or on Italian isles of many supermarkets.

Great chicken--came out great on my gas grill. This was my first time brining and I will definately do this again. The only change I made was to use sea salt in the brine and I made the alternate marinade because I didn't have fish sauce.

Made this for guests last night and it was delicious and looked just as it did on the cover. Squeezing the grilled limes on the chicken was great!

Used this for boneless skinless chicken breasts (all I had in the house) and it was wonderful! I think next time, I will add a little more sugar, because I couldn't taste any sweetness; just the right amount of salt, though, in my opinion. Can't wait to try it with chicken parts and pork chops!

My chicken is brining as I speak. Can someone explain to me why the brine needs to simmer for 15 minutes? What is the advantage over merely dissolving the salt and sugar?

Well I made this for the family; no fish sauce (allergies, and well several members are PICKY) Anyway I just left it out and only used 1/2 of the salt. My kids LOVED it and they hate everything that's good for them. If you are making for adults I would say just follow the directions;

Without doubt one of the best recipes for grilled chicken I've tried. Taste is outstanding and the chicken stays very juicy. The marinade using the fish sauce was delicious. As the final touch I used small key limes to grill at the end of the preparation (used regular lime juice in the marinade). When grilled, the limes release their juices freely and can be squeezed on the chicken for an extra flavor burst. All in all - this is a winner!

I made this yesterday for a family get together and we all loved it. The chicken was so moist. I made the Mediterranean marinade and it was yummy. I only heated a small part of the water with the salt and sugar until they dissolved then added the rest of the water. Otherwise I would have waited hours for it to cool. I doubled it too, everything, and it was delish!!

3 comments and a question... 1) This recipe was EXCELLENT, though a tad salty. 2) PLEASE don't add a review and rating unless you've actually tried the recipe 3) PLEASE limit your remarks to constructive comments about the recipe or technique, otherwise you simply waste our time. Comment: Has anyone tried this using less salt in the brine?

To the cook from Alamogordo: Don't worry about a brand for fish sauce. Look for a small bottle in the Asian food section. Fish sauce does have a stong flavor, but it really adds to dishes. I love it.

Truly excellent, moist and delicious. Prepared the recipe as presented other than omitting the initial simmering of the brine after bringing it to a boil. The fish sauce did not present a strong flavor at all; it was so delicious that I can't wait to make it again.

I have used soy sauce successfully in recipes as a replacement for Fish Sauce, since the flavor of fish sauce can be very strong. Sometimes I will use 1/2 fish sauce and 1/2 soy sauce in recipes that call for fish sauce. One brand that I typically buy is Orchids, but I am not sure you can find that at WalMart.

I will be attempting this barbecue recipe once the sun comes out here in Wales! But in the meantime, can someone tell me what kosher salt is, please? We don't have a salt called that over here in the UK. Is it rock salt or sea salt, ie course crystals of salt that you would put in a salt grinder to serve at the table?

This recipe sounds very good and I would like to try it. But I am not familiar with Asian Fish sauce. Can someone give me a brand name that I might find at either Wal-Mart or Lowe's (the 2 grocery stores in this town!!). Thank you.

Anna in Seattle--I don't care for fish sauce so I often use sesame oil or chile sesame oil (which is much spicier). Both have great flavor, although I haven't tried this recipe yet.

An addition to the science behind brining-the higher salt concentration in the meat also affects the protein strands causing them to unfold and trap more moisture in the meat. Brining is also a great technique to use on pork tenderloin. For more information, check out Cook's Illustrated, a publication for us food-chemist types...

I haven't made this yet but sounds like a winner. I have a "dmb" question to ask! Instructions are for chicken with the skin on. What would happen if I used skinned chicken. Would it get too dry or would the brine help to keep it moist? Would it help to dip it in the vineagrette before grilling to get a little oil on it?

Even though I haven't yet tried this, I'm going to give it a Four, because it's this is the way we've been grilling our chicken for forty years. I haven't tried brining it, but I'm curious to see if it's possible to improve on a terrific recipe. To answer Ocean Point, Maine's ??'s, you have to sear the chicken over very high heat to brown it, then move it to the rack over the 'turned off burner', on the gas grill or, on the charcoal grill, move it to the 'one quater of grill free of charcoal'. So it finishes cooking using indirect heat. The cooking times are the same for either grill used. If this is confusing, I'd suggest printing the instructions and reading them carefully. Maybe blocking out those that don't pertain to your grill.

Okay, at the risk of getting lambasted for asking stupid questions, here goes. I'm confused about where you actually do the cooking on the grill. It says to move the chicken onto the rack after searing. Do you leave it there, or move it back to the main grill to finish cooking. Unclear to me. Also, are the times given for gas grill or charcoal? It rather gives a mixed message. Thanks all, for the answers from kindly people who think there are no such things as "numb" questions (that's what we say in the northeast!)

I haven't tried the recipe yet (I will as soon as school is out), but I can enlighten the cook who asked about a scant teaspoon. Obviously, it's a little less that a level one. I find the easiest way to do it is to measure a level teaspoon, pour it into my hand, and remove 2 pinches. Voila -- a scant teaspoon!

I only followed the recipe for the timing and use of heat of grilling bone-in chicken breasts. It's an easy way to grill without burning the outside of the chicken or having to stand over the grill for 30 minutes. It was cooked perfectly. I used my own marinate because I didn't have the ingredients for this one. Brining is the key to good chicken on the grill.

Houston: Brining adds a lot of flavor and especially juiciness to a cut of meat. I have brinded pork roasts, turkey breasts and chicken. Once you get it in the brine (I usually use more salt than called for here), it is just waiting time while it sits in the fridge. I recommend overnight (or even up to 2 days for pork) rather than the 6 hours called for here. Give it a try!

This is not a new recipe! My mother-in-law and her sisters have been putting what you call "Mediterranean Vinaigrette" on oven roasted, broiled or bar-b-qued chicken since they got off the boat from Italy. They did not fuss with limes or fresh mint and added a little oregano but the rest was exactly the same, and to this day I think its better than the best bar-b-que sauce you can make or buy!

Do not be intimidated by the long list of instructions!!! There is a lot of extraneous info there. Just brine and grill. My boyfriend won't eat chicken off the bone, and even with boneless breasts, this turned out fantastically! I also marinated in the vinaigrette for about a half hour before grilling. I will be making this again for his parents when they visit next week.

I made this twice over memorial weekend and it got rave reviews both times. The second time I put the marinade on before and after the grilling. It was fabulous.
