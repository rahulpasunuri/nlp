I have not made yet, but do you think a bit of siracha sauce in the egg mixture would bump up thr flavor. Also I was thinking of using white cheddar.

Used sour cream, did not add 2nd tablespoon of oil, baked 20-25 minutes, added 1/4 cup cheese after frittata was baked. Will make same way again.

Followed recipe as written. It came out well but I have to agree that the fontina was bland. It just needs more flavor from some other cheese or additional herbs or spices. Good basic recipe to build on.

Excellent. Used 10 eggs and Asiago and pecorino instead. Cooked in my #8 cast iron skillet for 25 minutes in a preheated oven. Next time 20 minutes just so it is a little more moist!

Tasty treat for a light dinner. It makes quite a bit with the dozen eggs, so 1/6 of the pan was more than enough for one serving. The fontina cheese was very, very mild - I may try parmesan and fontina mixed together next time.

With six inches of snow on the ground, I made this as comfort food tonight for husband and son to rave reviews. Texture was light, leeks added a special something. The cook from Los Altos had the right idea to add additional Parmesan. I served with red pepper flakes which added a nice top note as well.

This is the first time I used sour cream in a frittata (did not have creme fraiche), and I liked the results and will do it again. I added 2 minced cloves of garlic with the mushrooms, substituted cheddar for the fontina and some Romano over the top, and fresh dill for the parsley. Also I only used 9 eggs, so it required less cooking time...I almost singed the bottom.

Delicious! I love how the leeks became caramelized in the oven. I substitued non-fat greek yogurt (Fage) for the creme fraiche and pecorino romano for the fontina. Next time I think I might try adding pancetta for some additional protein and a bit more of that smokey, rich flavor.

My husband and I really enjoyed this frittata. The creme fraiche kept it nice and light. I also only cooked it for about 25 minutes. You could use any cheese you liked if the fontina is too mild. Next time I may try a goat cheese.

I've made this twice...you always learn a little something the first time! I felt the first go-round was a little lean on the mushrooms so I used about 50% more. I also think that 25 minutes in the oven is just perfect. The first time I made this, I cooked it for 30 minutes and the leek/mushroom mixture was a little singed. The second time I also added a couple of large handfuls of grated parmesan to the top. The Fontina is good, but quite mild.

This was not one of my favorites. The fontina cheese is so mild that I don't think it added anything to the flavor and didn't stand up to the stronger taste of the mushrooms. I used low fat sour cream, which also was a mistake as I think the creme fraiche would be a much better choice. All in all, it came out of the oven looking beautiful but not my favorite frittata.

Nice frittata. Leaving the mushrooms and leeks in the bottom of the pan and pouring the egg mixture over the top keep the bottom of the frittata from sticking. The fontina added a very nice nutty flavor.
