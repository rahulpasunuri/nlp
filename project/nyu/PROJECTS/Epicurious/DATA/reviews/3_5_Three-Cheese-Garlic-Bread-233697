This is a favorite in our household. i like it a bit crispy and browned, so i broil for about 2 minutes at the end. Watch carefully, the parm burns easily. i make a double batch and freeze the extra. Love this.

I've served this multiple times as an appetizer and with a meal and there has never been a single piece left. Fabulous, but skip the green onions--don't need them.

This went very well with a bbq'd tri-tip and broccoli. I used feta w/garlic and herb. I thought it was very good and had to stop my husband after his 4th piece and remind him to share. This is our new garlic bread!

I made this as an appetizer for my sisters 40th birthday.... and it was gone almost as soon as I put the tray down. Very easy too!

This sounded fabulous, but was just ok, certainly not worth the money and effort....hubby agreed!

So delicious! I used a Bulgarian feta, which tasted the best out of 3 I tried. Grilled it on a slice of rustic bread and it was gobbled up. It can be frozen in portions if the amount is too much to use up at once.

Just made this for a small dinner party and I'm glad I doubled the recipe! It was a HUGE HIT! (Everyone asked for the recipe) I cut back a TAD on the green onions and I broiled the second batch I made because the ciabatta was getting a too "crisp" when I baked it, and I prefer this type of cheese bread to be a little soft in the middle. Goes nicely with the "Penne w/ Chicken, Arugula, Roasted Tomatoes and Feta" March 2003 recipe.
