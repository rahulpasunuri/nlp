Presented beautifully as an hors d'oevre for a holiday dinner. Not as labor intensive as I expected it to be. Used goat cheese with herbs, per prior reviewers' recommendations. Also rolled out the pie crust a bit and used a fluted-cutter.

Lemon thyme adds a wonderful layer of flavor to this dish. I agree with others that 2 1/2 lbs of zucchini is far more than the amount needed -- I had enough for the mini-tarts, a second full-size tart, and still had excess zucchini left over. If you're in a hurry consider making a single large tart rather than small bites, provided you're serving appetizers to be be eaten with a fork. It isn't as elegant (and isn't "finger food") but the flavors still shine.

I assume these were fabulous given that my guests inhaled them before I could get my hands on one. I will definitely make again....after buying a mandoline so that the paper-thin slicing of the zucchini isn't so tedious!

This was really a hit but I made several alterations, as suggested by reviewers. In spite of my changes it worked out very well!! I rolled the crust reasonably thin to give more of a cracker-like crunch to the base. After freezing, I brushed an egg wash over the crust. I used much less zucchini which I shaved in the mandolin. I salted it without the olive oil (I added it at the end after baking). I used plain chevre but added pepper and fresh thyme to it -- already flavored chevre would be delicious. Once the zucchini was salted it became pliable, and I folded each into quarters, not as elegant as the fans but worked out great. (I used an oval cutter for the crust so the fan shape fit nicely.) I baked it without parmesan cheese (forgot it) but then when it came out of the oven I sprinkled with coarse ground pepper, lemon zest and a few drops of olive oil. Was really lovely and fun to make. Served with champagne for my parents' 47th anniversary!

This one came out looking great, but had a strange after-taste that didn't work for me or my guests. I agree with previous reviewers that 2 pounds of zucchini is way too much (2 zucchini is really more like it) the crust should be rolled thinner (to help with the crust overpowering the topping) and cut into bigger rounds than recommended (to make it easier to fan the slices).

These tarts were easy to make; but at least when I made them, you mainly taste the crust. Maybe rolling the crust thinner before cutting the tarts would help...

I really enjoyed these tarts. I made them star-shaped instead of circles, and just used 2 slices of zucchini for each, while being really generous with the goat cheese and parm. My guests adored them! As previously stated, the amount of zucchini was grossly overestimated - 2-4 zucchini is plenty. I used the extra to make a gratin based on a recipe of Giada de Laurentis from food network (full of gruyere!) and got rave reviews.

What a great idea! I will make this again and again. I left out the thyme (not a fan) and used asiago cheese instead of the parm (what I had on hand). Delicious! Make sure you slice the zucchini really thin or it won't fold up.

I loved this appetizer, but I would recommend only serving it hot out of the oven. These things sing a siren song when they're piping hot, but I found that the tarts became mushy and the zucchini developed a bitter taste after a couple of hours. Heidi from Texas is right: the tarts' flavor does not improve with time. I sauteed the leftover zucchini with some other garden veggies and had an easy dinner for two that night. :)

I got rave reviews by making one slight change. I didn't have Lemon Thyme, so I added a splash (maybe 1/2 tsp?) of lemon oil. It was delicious! I agree that only 3 zucchini were needed. And the 1 1/2- to 1 3/4-inch cookie cutter or biscuit cutter made it almost impossible to place the zucchini slices on top in the flower-like pattern. I made a second batch with a 2" cutter instead. They look much more elegant with the design.

I have made this one a few times and it is much more flavorful when I use herb goat cheese instead of the basic one. I also pile on the zucchini-not just 3-4 slices. Otherwise, I think this one is great!

Absolutely delicious, not as fussy to make as I thought

I made this for my book club, and it was best when it first came out of the oven, after awhile it just had an off taste. In addition the recipe called for way too much zucchini, I only used one (really only needed half of it). In addition the size recommended for the "tart" was too small to place 3 zucchini slices I only did too. There are better appetizer recipes out there, I would not make this again.

Great, do-able concept for anyone who entertains. Realistically only need 3 zucchini. For ribbons of zucchini that are easy to fold and fan, cut 1/16 in at most. I'd like to try with goat cheese topped with honey sweetened & crushed cranberries for the holidays. Or simplify one step further and use chutney atop goat cheese for sweet/savory delight.

Boring and lame.

Okay - forget the concentric circles, etc. Pile on the zucchini and bake. A couple zucchini are enough. They are good!

I haven't tried these yet, but I'm sure they are delicious. Just wanted to say that if it calls for refrigerated dough, why not cut a round out of a pillsbury biscuit and snuggle the goat cheese and zucchini inside with just a bit peeking out? Of course, fresh homemade biscuits could work...;-)

These were very good. I purchased 4 small zucchini and that was more than enough. I sliced them thin and overlapped 3 zucchini slices flat on each dough round. Very good flavor. Liked by all the guests.

I have made this recipe twice now and both times it went really well. I agree with the previous reviewer that four zucchini is plenty. I used a vegetable peeler with a wide blade to get the slices nice and thin. I used Pillsbury pie crust and it was fine. I used really nice locally made goat cheese one night, and Boursin the next. Both worked very well, although I preferred the tang of the local goat cheese. Overall, very pleased with the both the ease of the preparation and the final product.

this was a huge hit- i actually made it for dinner with an entire pie shell about 4 zucchinis was enough and the same amount of goat cheese and a little extra parm...what a huge hit!!!25 minutes and it was perfect

WARNING: Do not buy all of that zucchini! There is an incredible miscalculation of the amount needed for the recipe. My instincts told me something was wrong, but I thought, "It's a Bon Appetit recipe, so there must be a reason,.." Wrong! I could not believe the surplus! We will eat the sliced zucchini for days. I, too, was a little put off by the refrigerated pie crust, but I did appreciate the fast and easy of it. I cut my rounds 1½-inch, but I would make them a bit larger next time, as manipulating the folded zucchini into "concentric circles...creating a flower-like pattern" required excellent fine motor skills. The French goat cheese smeared on top of the dough worked magic and my guests really loved them.

Definitely too much zucchini called for: half the amount is fine. A mandoline helps tremendously. I made these twice. I found the packaged pie crust to be fine (although it's the first time I've ever used packaged; I usually make my own). First time I made them as individual rounds as the recipe called for. I found this to be quite a bit of work! The second time, I used the pie crust whole (didn't cut individual mini-circles), smeared on the goat cheese and topped randomly with the zucchini, not worrying about folding it or making it decorative. Cut into squares after baking. A lot easier and still good, although the inner pieces didn't weren't crisp. Guests liked it anyways.

I didn't like the refrigerated pastry dough and would use another base if I made this again. I also had a hard time working with the zucchini -- the thinner slices weren't usable after salting, and many of the thicker slices were too thick to be folded even after salting. You probably need a mandoline to get the slices just right.

These had a good flavor but it isnt what I'd consider an easy breezy recipe (as stated in the article)and the ingredient amounts are off. One pie crust makes about 50 rounds and 2 1/2 pounds of zucchini is waaaaay too many. Even with double the rounds there was so much left over zucchini we'll be eating it all week
