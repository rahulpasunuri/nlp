This recipe is a keeper. I made these cookies tonight per the recipe with exception of baking time. I wanted a chewier cookie, so I baked for 9-10 minutes per other reviews. I love the flavor - chocolate, almond and toffee are such a great combo. After cooling, the texture is still a little crunchy for me, so I'll cut back on baking time even more next time. I used Heath milk chocolate toffee bits and sliced almonds. I will definitely make again and will not change anything except baking time.

this is my new favorite cookie to make! i substituted milled flaxseed for half the flour and used hazelnuts instead of almonds...and didn't have any rum (oh well, next time!) easy to make and SO decadent!

This is an absolutely decadent cookie! It is chewy and crunchy at the same time. I used crushed Heath bits which worked wonderfully. My only substitution was salted butter because that was all I had. I think it helped balance the sweetness.The almonds were coarsely chopped.

An absolutely fabulous cookie - chewy because they crisp once they're out of the oven, crunchy from the toffee and almonds. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked.

These are WOW cookies for sure...I made a couple changes, I used 2 cups of walnuts, & 6oz chopped Belgian 60% coco chocolate bars.....for a lill punch!

I made these for a cookie exchange and they disappeared quickly--many compliments! I did make some changes though. The crushed toffee didn't add enough to the cookies, in my opinion, so after baking the first batch I stirred in about a cup (or more--didn't really measure) of dried cranberries to the rest of the batter. Delicious!

This is my go-to cookie recipe for office parties and care packages. I normally omit the almonds but it works great with or without. A couple of notes: - What rum you use matters! Get the good stuff - Myers Dark is a standby for me. I brought back a bottle of banana rum from Nassau this summer, though, and that is absolutely sinful in these cookies. - I can either crush Heath bars with a hammer (satisfying and therapeutic) or buy the Hershey's crushed toffee with milk chocolate (easier on me and the neighbors both). Works just fine either way. The pre-crushed can be tricky to find but never let it be said that I turned down a reason to pay Hershey, PA a visit when they're only 90 minutes away! - I recommend working in the toffee and almonds by hand, as the batter is stiff enough to get tangled up in a mixer once the flour mixture is added.

Our family loves these - they're our "go-to" recipe along with regular chocolate chip. They're an awesome taste combination - the almonds add a really good, subtle taste. They're great if cooked completely - a little crisp, or nice & chewy if baked only 8-9 minutes. We've had to forgo the rum & honestly it doesn't make too big of a difference... add it if you have it, or not : ) THESE ARE GREAT COOKIES!

I have made this a few times now with a few of the suggested changes. I have doubled the recipe, and the only changes I have made, because I didn't have rum, was to increase the vanilla to about 1 tablespoon, and I used a combo of Skor bits and broken Skor bars (like Heaths)...FABULOUS!!

Rating: 4
Key is to use bars of semi-sweet Ghirardelli chocolate not chocolate chips. And roll the individual cookies balls prior to baking in some of the extra toffee bar chunks! Always a favorite in my family. Very rich and for the ultimate chocolate lovers.

Yum!! added ch. chips and broke up toffee bars instead of buying crushed! super-yummy.

I was disappointed in the recipie. I did not find much toffee flavor at all. They are easy to make, but not worth making again.

I was excited to make these cookies because they sounded so rich and delicious. I was disappointed though. I took other's advice and used a silpan which made all the difference in the world and cooked them for 10 1/2 min. The cookies were just ok though. I made them for a party and no one seemed too excited to eat more than one.

Wow, these cookies are amazing! I didn't have any rum in the house, so used some Godiva liqueur that was leftover from a cocktail recipe. It worked deliciously! My husband just ate four.

These cookies are sin! I added a bit extra toffee and no almonds because I didn't have any. I will add them next time however. And there will be a next time! Loads of chocolate make this fudgy and rich. They were actually better the next day too.

These cookies taste really good and the batter was amazing, but I followed the recipe exactly and they came out extremely flat - like wafers and I couldn't get them off the baking sheet. Don't know what happened but would appreciate any tips from someone who's had better luck

Defines the perfect cookie. Doubled the van. extract since had no rum on hand. Used the entire 8 oz. bag of crushed Heath bars & it was still extraordinary inspite of not following the recipe precisely. Cookies didn't last the night. Will make again this w/e.

Decadent and rich, but stunningly good! I substituted 1/2 tsp. rum extract for the dark rum, omitted the almonds for the nut-hater in the house, and used about 8 oz. crushed Heath bars (the whole bag). Delish! I concur with the other commenter who said she wouldn't make them every day -- they really are very, very rich -- but I'd give these as gifts or make them for parties in a heartbeat.

These are the best cookies just ask my husband who keeps asking me to bake more. Although i agree that they are rich, they are really tasty at the same time. The toffee, almond and cocoa mixture makes this a unique addictive flavor.

Followed the recipe exactly, reviewed it several times. It didn't come out at all, it was horrible. I threw the recipe out already, as I have several similar ones and didn't figure it was worth trying this again.

These cookies were very simple to make and came out great. I was just short of a cup of sugar so I used some brown sugar. I also did not have rum, so I used 2 tsp. vanilla. I baked them on a silpat and they slid right off. Yum :)

These are yummy cookies, but I think a bit too rich for everyday - I'll make them again for a special occasion or to share (because they are impressive), but not just to have on hand for my family.

DELISH! I have been making these for years and they are amazing. Break up the toffee bars (while still in their wrappers) with a hammer. You will get big chunks and no mess!

These are great! Like others i used heath bar brickle stuff. I only had a partial bag (5 oz.) so made up the weight with choc chips. Forgot the almonds and baked one sheet without. Added them for the rest. Delish both ways. I think these would be good with ice cream in between for sandwiches..

Fabulous cookies - they rate up there with the best I have made. I would add a little more toffee bits and rum, and replace almonds with macademia nuts.

Yummy Yummy Yummy!!! I made the recipe as written except I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla since we didn't have any rum. I also used an 8 oz bag of chocolate heath bits which were perfect. They are very sweet but that works for me. I also used parchment paper and they didn't stick at all.

Rating: 3
very good, quick and easy. Next time I would use more heath chips and might even add chocolate chips for a really over the top dessert.

I love the combination of toffee and chocolate and was not disappointed with this recipe. The only adjustment I made was using 2 tsp. of rum and 2 tsp. of vanilla. The rum taste becomes a little more subtle, so my kids didn't notice it. But the grown-ups knew there was something "a little different" in the cookies. Will definitely make again.

I made these cookies for my girlfriend to give out to her friends and peers. Everyone raved about them. I didn't use the almonds because I don't like the way they turn out in cookies. I also added more toffee (mine measured about 9-10 oz.) and that made a wonderful difference. I mixed 75% of the toffee in the batter and used the rest as decoration on top so it would melt beautifully and it did. Also I didn't have dark rum so I used what was around (Bacardi coconut) and that was fine too. My only change would be to bake them for less time, about 9-10 minutes at the most, you want them to be nice and soft a few days later! These are beyond decadent!

great cookies! i left out the almonds for nut-averse eaters, and used an 8oz bag of heath chips. made the cookies bigger too. cooked on a silpat. easy and really good. dough isnt too bad either!

This is a must for those who love toffee and chocolate! The only tricky thing is removing the cookies from the baking sheet, as they tend to stick to the pan. To solve the problem, I started using parchment paper on the next batch and voila, the cookies came up without sticking. I too, found the cookies to be a bit on the sweet side, so I decreased the amount of sugar by 2 Tbsp. Cookies were delectable and loved by all!

Rating: 4
This recipe was awesome! I actually messed up and used a 1/2 cup measure on the dry ingredients (sugar, flour, cocoa) instead of the 1 cup measure and didn't realize the error until the first batch were in the oven. I corrected the remaining batter and served both. While I preferred the correct version, all of my friends raved about my goof cookies, so I might make them that way next time.

Everyone loved this cookie. I, too, used 7 ounces of Skor Toffee bits, slivered almonds, and 4 ounces of chopped semisweet chocolate. I baked it for 11 minutes. It will be on my repeat list and chocolate lovers will love it.

I too use skor pieces and chocolate chips. the cookies were delicious but i found they needed to cook longer because the melted toffee made them very very soft. I cooked them for fifteen minutes

These were wonderful! I took the suggestion of another cook and substituted Skor pieces and chocolate chips for the candy bars. I also made them smaller. So glad I did, they make a very rich cookie. Am making them again tomorrow!

Everyone loved these cookies. They were tricky to cook and remove - don't let them bake more then 10 mins because they burn instantly after that. But at 10mis the cookie is still so soft that it can be difficult to remove from the pan without deforming the cookie....but if you let it cool before removal, the toffee just glued itself to the pan. Still, the results were worth it. Makes a flat, crunchy cookie.

I've made these cookies for two occasions now and on both occasions there were absolutely RAVE reviews. I was hounded for the recipe, which I had modified somewhat. I used 3/4 cup Skor toffee bits, 3/4 cup Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup chopped almonds. I also used the Ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa. I cooked each batch for 11-12 minutes and made the cookies slightly smaller than the recipe recommended (teaspoons instead of tablespoons). Give them a try! These are SO GOOD! :)

Friends called these cookies "Out of control good." They were surprisingly popular at the holiday party. I also used Skor toffee bits and chocolate chips instead of the Heath Bar--I avoid using candy bars because the chocolate isn't great for baking

these are great. mine turned out like a version of a lace cookie, cery flat. not sure if they are supposed to. i used my convection oven and shortened the time to 7 1/2 minutes. they are crispy and wonderful. i used my silpats and that made all the difference in getting them off the sheet. Enjoy.

My family loved these. I used 1 c. of Skor bits instead of cutting up a heath bar and 1 c. of semi sweet chocolate chips instead of the almonds. The Skor bits gave the cookies a gooey, glistening look.

Delicious. I overcooked the first batch slightly and they were a bit dry but cut down on the cooking time on the second batch by only one minute (from 11 minutes to 10) and it made a big difference. I didn't change a thing in the recipe except I didn't add the almonds as I didn't have any on hand. I didn't find them too sweet or rich. They were perfect. Will definitely be making them again and soon.

I made these cookies for a picnic where I met my fiance. He thought the cookies were so heavenly good that he had to find the person who made them. I followed the receipe exactly but I used silpat which avoided burning and sticking to the pan.

Rating: 2
my friend and i followed the suggestions to cut down on the sugar and the cocoa. i would also suggest cutting down on the butter as well. the large amount of butter made the cookies too rich for my taste and our cookies weren't as crispy as we wished and were a little doughy/fudgey in the middle. dropping the dough into smaller spoonfuls helps to keep the cookies from becoming too flat. we substituted toasted walnuts for almonds and they work well.

I followed the original recipe (without almonds) and the cookies turned out wonderfully soft and tasty. I let them cool a little longer than recommended because they had a tendency to break while still hot.

These cookies are really great. I made them this morning with my three year old. I only used 3/4 cup of Heath Almond Toffee Bits (all I had left, and it was PLENTY -- I would not have wanted more, I think you'd have too much toffee sticking in your teeth) and I also left out the almonds because I didn't have any. I don't recommend using less cocoa powder as other reviewers have mentioned -- I used the full amount and think they're perfect just the way they are. Also, my dough was not at all dry -- perhaps the previous reviewer mismeaured her flour?

My mother and I enjoyed these cookies very much. However, the mixure itself was quite DRY and often difficult to scoop. Why was there no liquid added except an egg? Thanks for sharing. W. Fallon

Before I made this recipe I read the reviews of the other chefs. That helped to insure my success. I doubled the recipe, took our the extra sugar, and cut the cocoa powder in half. I also kept the dark rum in the recipe (gave it a great kick and turned regular chocolate cookies into something truly gourmet). Everyone loved these cookies! Most people asked for seconds. These cookies were so easy to make and baked in minutes. I had an assembly line going as I moved my baking stones in and out of the oven with batches of cookies. Super simple recipe! Loved these cookies!

The toffee melts in the oven and carmelizes, causing the cookie to burn to the cookie sheet. If I were to try this recipe again, I would break the Heath or Skor bars into very small pieces (mine ranged from tiny to perhaps 2 cm across).

This recipe was a big hit. I also left out the cocoa and almonds. The only thing is next time i may add 1/3 cup flour to take the place of the cocoa, since after they came out of the oven they were puffy but hollow underneath. I would make these again.

These cookies were fabulous, a must for any chocolate lover. After reading the other reviews, I decided to leave out the 2 additional Tbsp of sugar. I also used Kahlua instead of the rum. Just an FYI they do sell toffee bars already chopped next to the chocolate chips in your supermarket.

These cookies were pretty good; everyone who ate them really liked them. Personally, I would like to cut the cocoa in half. I did as the first chef suggested, I used the Bits o' Brickle and just vanilla instead of rum. I will make them again and cut the cocoa just for kicks.

These chocolate toffee cookies were amazing- the hit of an office party! I did not have rum on hand so I just eliminated it and increased the amount of vanilla extract to one tablespoon with fine results. I used "Bits of Brickle" toffee pieces that come in an orange bag instead of chopping up candy bars- much easier and faster! Try these cookies!
