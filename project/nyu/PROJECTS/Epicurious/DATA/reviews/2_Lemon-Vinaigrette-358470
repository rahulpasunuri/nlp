Yeah. So this recipe was okay. I suppose if you had the absolute BEST ingredients it would have been serviceable, but I used a run of the mill olive oil (not cheap but not imported specially from Tuscany) and I felt that it really lacked something. The mixture emulsified very well, but it wasn't palatable until I added salt and pepper. There are much better lemon vinaigrettes on epicurious.
