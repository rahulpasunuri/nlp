This was really good and came out much better than I'd expected based on some of the reviews. I was concerned that the cream wouldn't have much flavor so I made it a few hours in advance so it would develop a bit. BTW, I used a bread mix that I got at Ikea--it was in a milk carton, and I just added water, poured and baked. It was great and made this even more delicious!

I left out the coriander because I didn't have any. I didn't like the tartness of the sour cream and lime so I added honey and it tasted great. I would definitely use this recipe again including the honey.

Makes a great sandwich spread - just toss everything including the salmon in the food processor.

The cilantro cream really blossoms the day after - you can really taste the cilantro - when freshly made it hardly makes an impression.

i didn't think this was anything special. maybe if i would have put the cilantro cream over the salmon instead of in a dish on the side, more people would have eaten it.

Fabulous! I served it as suggested by another reviewer, on toast, with the salmon topped with the cream. Everyone absolutely raved about it! The coriander is indeed the key, though. Adds a great flavor. I'd make this again and again!

I thought this was just ok. It looked elegant garnished with clilantro sprigs & lime wedges but the flavor was nothing special...

Simple, elegant and trustworthy. Not much more I can say. The coriander seeds were the best, and they give such good flavor to many foods.

Fabulous! I just served this at a holiday party and got rave reviews. I have now been asked by three people for the recipe. Don't skip the coriander - it is a must!

I thought this was pretty good but I expected it to be better based on the other reviews. I love smoked salmon and cilantro so how could I go wrong? I think maybe it was the sour cream that put me off. I'm too used to cream cheese with salmon. I also didn't use corainder seeds because I couldn't find any in the store.

The cilantro and salmon was an unexpected, very tasteful mix. I served the salmon in little slices on small toasts, and put a dollop of the cilantro cream on top. Looked great, easy to make, and was the first to go at my holiday party.

Delicious and easy, very light and flavorful. The cilantro is a nice touch with the powerful salmon. Will repeat many times.

This was served at a dinner party I attended. It was fabulous. So much so that here I am getting it to add to my collection of recipes and to tell everyone else how great it is. The friend who served it said it was simple to prepare. I know I will be serving this one again and again.
