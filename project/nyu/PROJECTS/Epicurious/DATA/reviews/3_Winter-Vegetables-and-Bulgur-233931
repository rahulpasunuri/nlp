This was wonderful the way we made it, but it wasn't really this recipe. We did the root veg as instructed, then poured in a cup+ of white wine. Then we added Israeli Couscous and stock, and made it as if it were risotto - adding liquid a little at a time (should have done the couscous before the wine, actually) until it reached the desired consistency. We also toasted the couscous. Our veg was turnips, red beets, and a couple little carrots and it was a gorgeous hot pink color. Added the baby spinach at the end and the green popped against the pink. It would be an awesome Valentine's dish. Really beautiful. Threw in a little parmesan and then grated parm over at the table. Turned out fantastic, so rich and silky (but no butter, incredibly!). So if you know how to do risotto, just adapt this accordingly.

To keep the bulgur from getting gummy, stir it into the boiling liquid (I took the advice of another reviewer and added white wine before the stock), remove from heat, cover and let stand 15 minutes. I used 3c stock, 1/2c wine and 1 1/2c bulgur using this technique and it turned out fluffy and delicious. The recommended garlic was a nice addition.

I have to give at least three forks to anything that both my 4 and 2 year olds will eat without complaining. I used sweet potato, carrots, and celery (not exactly winter veggies, but what I had on hand), and one large red onion. Deglazed the pan with white wine before adding the veggie broth, and threw in about five cloves of chopped garlic at that time, too. I would agree with other reviewers that the texture of this dish leaves something to be desired, but I served it with some toasted almond slivers, and that was just the crunch it needed. Next time I might add some toasted sunflower seeds, too. If you're not vegan, I think a handful of feta would be awesome in this dish, but we went without and it was still great. Also, I didn't have quite enough bulgur so I used half bulgur, half couscous. End result was fine.

Followed the advice of another reviewer and roasted the veggies, adding to the bulgur at the very end. Used parsnips, turnips and celery root. Everyone enjoyed it, including our 7 year-old.

I made this with a Turkish bulgur, carrot, celeriac, and swede (a/k/a rutabaga) - in a rice cooker after the veggies were sauteed. Really good, and even better as leftovers. You've got to salt it to your taste.

The ingredients in this dish are fabulous, bu the recommended cooking method is bad. You're far better off just roasting the root vegetables with some olive oil & salt in the oven, and making everything else as recommended -- and then tossing them together at the end. That will prevent it from getting mushy or gummy and will allow the root vegetables (especially the turnips) to caramelize instead of turning bitter.

Well the day I made this I thought it was disgusting, but I had planned to bring it for easy re-heat lunches to work for the week so I kept it. It improves the next day people!!! Now I love it. I used carrots, celeriac, and red beets (warning: red beets stain the whole thing pink - not to appetizing to look at!). But very tasty reheated the next day (or two). If you found it slimy you probably overcooked the dish, as I found this occured when I left it too long in the microwave at work.

I agree wholeheartedly with the last reviewer--the texture is gummy. Even a bit slimy. All of these ingredients could be put to better use. I may throw out the leftovers--I can't face it again.

I made the recipe as written and added additional fresh herbs. The flavor was rather bland and the dish had an almost gummy texture.

Used parsnips, carrots and white turnip, with 4 tablespoons of olive oil because of quantity of veg and bulgur. Also added fresh sage as well as herbes de provence. Used regular spinach, coarsely chopped. Excellent.
