I absolutely love this recipe! I tend to use double the suggested seasoning on the lamb, though, as I find that it tastes better that way. Also, be careful when taking the lamb out of the baking pan. If you move it the wrong way (and a part of it touches the moisture that has collected in the pan) you will lose that beautiful crust. It's not as adhesive as you may think.

I found this to be a nice change from the usual spice/herb accompaniments, but on the whole it was too peppery, and the lamb couldn't shine. My husband scraped most of his crust off. Nice try but needs tweeking to be right.

Loved this. The orange and spices are a great combo and nice change from the typical bread crusted lamb.

Maybe we're just too used to the classic rosemary/thyme coating on rack of lamb. This was ok. Flavors didn't seem to penetrate the lamb too well even though it was marinated overnight, so it was bland in comparison to a standard rosemary/thyme marinade.

the reader was right about the same old same old rosemary thing. this spice combonation was fantastic. unfortunatly, my husband didn't like it as much as I did. Too bad for him.

I would definitely make this recipe again. The spices are just right.
