The concesus of the four of us who ate it was that it wasn't bad or good, just interesting. There are better SE-style salads/sides than this.

Very good. I have tried several jicama salads and this is my favorite.

This kept crispy in the fridge for several days afterward - but it did take on quite a citrusy flavor after the first day.

All that julienne-ing takes a while if you don't have a processor, and watch the heat from the peppers. Otherwise, delish, light and easy. (Maybe a little too light -- might do well with some sesame and / or peanut oil.)
