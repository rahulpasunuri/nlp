These were amazing!! Everyone loved them, saying they were delicious. Not too sweet either. I might also add that this was the first time I ever made meringue - most came out well, but some got a bit burnt but that was due to my oven more than anything.

Wonderful dessert! I served it to my family on Christmas Eve and it was definitely a hit. It wasn't hard to do, but did take a lot of time. Also, I couldn't find Cream of Tartar (I tried two grocery stores with no luck!) but it still worked out just fine.

These were very tasty and not too too much work. I followed the directions exactly and had no problems, except that I think I might double the pastry cream next time. Will definitely consider making this in the future!

I have made this for dinner parties for our gourmet catering business and it is universally loved! The flavors are so perfectly matched and the variety of textures is fantastic! We always use the pomegranates and kiwi fruits in the winter because they are perfect holiday colors, but in the spring, summer and fall I use the freshest berries I can find. You cannot go wrong with this one. By the way, I usually add some extra (unwhipped) cream to the pastry cream right before I load up the merangues so it is easier to work with (it is very stiff, otherwise). A stellar, impressive dessert!!

Freakin' Delicious! They look like you slaved all day over them or purchased them from a professional and they taste really good.

And one more thing from my review below...the pastry cream is pretty sturdy, but it tends to stay lumpy when I mix in the whipped cream. I usually just throw the pastry cream in with the whipped cream in my mixer and let it combine the two. Then I pass the combined cream through a medium meshed sieve to get all the lumps out. Sounds like a lot of work, but it isn't too bad and it makes a fantastic dessert.

I make this recipe every time I want to impress company. You have to plan in advance to get the meringues fully dried and crisp, but they are wonderful. I make the meringues slightly smaller than recommended since they are so sweet, I think a smaller bite (and the chance to have 2 of them) is preferred. Usually I add extra whipped cream to the pastry cream to lighten it more and instead of kiwi and pomegranate, I use sliced strawberries and whole blueberries, blackberries and raspberries. The colors are gorgeous and the fresh fruit flavor with the sweet meringue and rich pastry cream is fantastic. You have to put the cream into the meringue just before serving or else the meringue gets soggy. My kids love this and my husband can't get enough of them. Definitely try it!

wonderful. delicate yet decadent--i made these for a dessert party and they were finished almost instantly. although the meringues take a while to make it's worth it, especially if you like light desserts with fresh fruit!

The most decadant part of this dessert is the pastry cream...so good. Be sure to make the crevaces in the merangue deep enough, though: don't overfill them like I did, which caused them to overflow once I added the kiwi. Even though a few were a little sloppy looking, the flavor was exceptional, and everyone who tried them loved their uniqueness next to the more traditional Thanksgiving desserts.
