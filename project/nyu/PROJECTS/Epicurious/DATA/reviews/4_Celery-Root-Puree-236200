I have made this recipe a dozen times and it is always excellent. I would caution cooks to pick the freshest pieces of celery root they can find. If the roots have some green stem showing, they are fresh. I have on occasion used cream instead of milk, and the results were wonderful, although the results with whole milk were pretty good too. The puree is great with any type of meat, especially something that is prepared with a sauce. I have used it to accompany stews, glazed salmon, and roast tenderloin.

A delightful alternative to potatoes. I used the food processor and got the perfect texture. Also added a bit of chicken stock. This can be classified as comfort food or the accompaniment to an elegant dinner. Thin it with stock and make soup from this recipe.

I also halved this recipe with much success. It smelled and tasted delicious. Perfect recipe to break out the immersion blender. I served this with braised brisket, and thought it was nice to add a new option to polenta or mashed potatoes, for any braised meat. Yum!

Awesome recipe. I probably used slightly less butter than the recipe called for. Also browned some of the onions in the saucepan first to give a bit of flavor, though who knows if that did anything. An excellent replacement for mashed potatoes, and much healthier.

Very good but mine turned out runny. Be careful to eliminate all liquid before processing. I also wonder if roasting the veggies would give them a flavor boost, as well as cutting out some of the liquid.

Can be halved with no consequence. Serve with coriander seared scallops and a roasted veggie like asparagus or braised carrots and a nice, lean chardonnay!

This puree had such a light texture. I reserved about 1/2 cup of the milk mixture before discarding it and used a portion of that to slightly thin the puree to be even silkier.

Made half the recipe. Turned out great.

Good, easy and healthier than mashed potatoes. I used 2% and skipped the butter without consequence.

I put the cooked vegetables into the Vita-mix, and the resulting puree was so, so creamy and fluffy. It paired nicely with orange-glazed pork spare ribs. In addition, I forgot to add the onion, but did not really miss it.

This is very rich and comforting without the heavy cream included in many recipes. It was simple and my favorite thanksgiving side dish.

I love celery root. I get sick of rice with Asian dishes, so paired my orange chicken with celery root puree and it was fantastic.

Made this for the first time and served it with braised oxtails. It is excellent, better tasting than my old standby mashed potatoes. Will definitely make it again.

I've made this recipe several times. I think it is key not to actually "puree" the vegetable mixture, but to keep it as a combo of puree and chopped since that gives the recipe more texture. I love it. It's really reasy to make and very much a do ahead recipe for a party.

All right people.... chill out. Anyway.... Made this for Thanksgiving dinner; it was a wonderfully smooth, slightly sweet and different alternative to the usual starch dishes. We'll definitely be making this one again.

This was great! I used slightly less butter and 2% instead of whole milk, it was still delicious and decadent. I served it under roasted root vegetables and it was a hit with everyone. Nice alternative to mashed potatoes.
