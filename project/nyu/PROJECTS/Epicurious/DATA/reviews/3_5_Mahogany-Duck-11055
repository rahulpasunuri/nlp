Just finished Christmas dinner and my family raved about these ducks. Dad said they're as good as it gets. They were beautiful, a lovely deep mahogany as promised. The juices in the ducks were scant, and my brother pronounced it "criminal" to throw out the pan juices, so I poured off the fat, strained the pan juices, and added about half to the broth mixture. I was worried the sauce would be too salty as a result of all the soy sauce, but it was perfect, with that lovely browned flavor that would have been missing from mere thickened beef stock. Eat at least a few bites of skin, no matter what your diet--you'd be missing the best part if you didn't. All in all, a real holiday triumph.

this is one of my favorites and always receives rave reviews-however-I do not dry the duck for 3 days but rather marinate it of the course of 2-3 days-really fantastic!!Grant Mitman

Looked impressive but tasted BLAND. Too much work for so little payback. I have cooked duck many times and this is not one of the better ways to prepare it.

Awesome!Did it a bit differently but it was great. Marinaded duck overnight in plastic bag. Reserved juices and reduced to thick sauce. Rotisseried the duck on BBQ and basted with sauce after two hours on spit. Outside was delicious as was the tender meat inside. Simpler and tasty.

This duck is well worth the advance preparation. It looks gorgeous before it even goes in the oven, and is extremely impressive after it comes out. It was very tender and all my guests enjoyed it thoroughly. I found that it took longer than the prescribed time to cook though. I believe my duck was closer to the smaller of the weights suggested. Next time, I will hang the duck to dry and leave extra cooking time. The marinade is incredible. I think it would work well with almost any meat. Highly recommended.
