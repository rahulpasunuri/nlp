To answer other peoples complaints about the rosemary being too strong... I used dry rosemary and it worked out quite well. Maybe give it a try.

Extremely filling! Next time I might try a fancier type of gnocchi. I added carrots too which was a good mix and added a bit more color.

This was such an odd combination, too much rosemary, and who would think gnocchi would go with shrimp, a child could think of a better complimentary dish.

This was one of the best things I have ever eaten. We made homemade gnocchi but otherwise followed the recipe as is.

The main word around the table was "interesting" followed closely by "unusual". The rosemary really overpowered the dish. Maybe this one would be better with basil instead?
