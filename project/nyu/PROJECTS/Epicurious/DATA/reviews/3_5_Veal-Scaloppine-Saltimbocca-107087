I didn't enjoy the texture the cornmeal gave. The veal lost its delicacy.

I plan on making this tonight but for the life of me I don't see any Fontina cheese in the recipe as is referred to in the reviews. Is it just someone in one of the reviews referring to it and then others picked up on it. I've never heard of cheese in Saltimbocca and I'm 73 years old.

Excellent.Very light . Flavor oof the sage was very good. Fast and easy to make.

P.S. I've also substituted provolone for Fontina. It comes in slices, which makes it much easier to work with, and the provolone also seems to go well with the dish.

I LOVE this recipe! This is one of my top 3 favorites from Epicurious and has entered regular rotation! Cornmeal is definitely better than flour, and the suggestions about Fontina cheese are right on. I usually use dried sage for myself, fresh for company.

Very, very good. I found shopping for the ingredients simple, it was easy and quick to make, and tasted better than similar versions I've had in restaurants. Highly recommended!

Lidia's recipe for this dish is more authentic and it tastes better too.

Veal is very expensive in the UK, but this recipe was worth the expense, added mushrooms and a little cream, served with garlic mash and brocolli. Yum Yum!

We tried the recipe using the Fontina,making extra sauce, using flour instead of cornmeal, decreasing the butter some and adding mushroom as were suggested. The recipe itself was quite good. We felt the fontina definitely overpowered the dish and that it might have been better without it.Will try again trying the new modifications.

I made this for New Years Eve using chicken instead of the veal and everyone loved it. Have made it since and it was great again.

This was very good. Added sauteed baby bellas and wilted some baby spinach to go with it too. Doubled the sauce, even for two people, it needed it.Also added the fontina, very nice. Careful with the salt! Might make it again.

My husband loved this recipe. It was pretty easy to pull together but comes off as a special dish.

This recipe was fixed for me years ago by a chef. I've been looking for this recipe for the longest time, just to compare the ingredients. I love this recipe. We use dry chablis instead of chicken broth, brown the veal, and layered in a lasgna pan, layer with prosciutto, layer with provolone cheese. This is done until it is all gone, but make the cheese last. Use the dry chablis to make the sauce from the essence in the pan, mixed until smooth pour over the layers of veal, prosciutto and provolone cheese, slide into an heated oven 350 degrees, let stay in the oven until cheese melt and serve with the spaghetti.

Highly recommend. This was excellent, and easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly and found it delicious. I am planning on making it again for friends this weekend.

I love this. I've made it three times now, including twice while on Atkins (we skip the pasta). I, like others, have variations: I use thin-sliced chicken breast (my wife won't eat veal) I cook the chicken, then remove it and make the sauce, using 1/3 cup of chicken broth and 2/3 cup of marsala: if I don't add mushrooms to the sauce, that's enough. If I DO add mushrooms, there's not enough; I'm going to do 1/2 cup broth to 1 cup marsala next time and see how that goes. When the mushrooms are done, I put the chicken back in the sauce, top each one with a slice of prosciutto and saved fontina, and put the lid on the pan until it's melted.

very good however i did not use cornmeal and just used flour. i would also recommend making more sauce b/c in the end, there just wasn't enough.

This dish was delicious, however I didn't use white cornmeal, because it wasn't in my supermarket. I also used more Marsala and thickened the sauce with bread crumbs.

Easy to prepare and delicious. I've had better Saltimbocca in restaurants, but never better at home, and it comes pretty close to the best.

Delicious recipe. I added porcini, and white mushrooms, and almost doubled the Marsala. I also covered in Fontina cheese. Make sure you use unsalted butter, and low-sodium / low-salt broth to keep the salt content manageable. All together fantastic. This would be great on either noodles or my preference garlic mashed potatoes.

I loved this recipe. It took me to make it twice to get it just right. I swapped in chicken instead of veal & changed the cornmeal to flour - I don't like the gritty texture of cornmeal. I would also mix the spagetti & sauce with proscuitto in a large bowl before I serve.

I thought that it was absolutely delicious. The cornmeal came off the meat after been in liquid, but it tasted great anyway.

The reviewers for this added quite a few good ideas and by incorporating some of them the dish was easy and turned out very well. I had never used white corn meal before and I think it really added to the success. I agree with making more sauce than the recipe calls for however I stayed with the recommended proportions. I feel that by leaving the slices of prosciutto whole the dish is less salty.

My boyfriend LOVED this dish; I wasn't as enthusiastic; definently tasty enough to try again but thought it was a bit salty. Next time will omit salt from cornmeal mixture and perhaps follow the suggestion of using the slices of prosciutto on top of the veal cutlets. Would this cut the salty taste?

Spectacular!! My husband raved about this dish. I also added crimini mushrooms and melted the fontina cheese over the proscuitto and veal. The flavors were complex and delicious!!!

The only addition I would make for this recipe is to add mushrooms. My husband absolutely loved this meal. Will most definetely make again.

Great dish! Took the other suggestions of using the Fontina and placing the proscuitto in slices on the veal. Was doubling the recipe as I was making it for my mom and dad and since I knew it would be impossible to fit into a skillet I placed the sauteed veal in a large pyrex pan, placed the proscuitto and fontina on top, then made the sauce (used 1 cup of marsala and 2/3 of broth) and poured the sauce over it and finished it in the oven. I served it with roasted garlic baked stuffed potatoes and like another reviewer sauteed some mushrooms in a little bit of marsala that I added to the sauce as I was putting the sauce in a gravy boat. A definite hit! served a great Oregonian Pinot Noir with it! (and Diana, the mandoline was a great idea for slicing the fontina!)

Just as a suggestion, I have NEVER seen saltimbocca made with corn meal. I would suggest dusting the meat with seasoned flour for a thinner "crust". Also, when deglazing the pan with the Marsala, the leftover bits of flour will help thicken the sauce better than the cornmeal.

To Diana from Norwalk re: fontina...freeze it for a few minutes and oil your(sharp)knife.

Good recipe. I intended to use the suggestion about the Fontina, but didn't have any on hand, so I followed the recipe except for substituting another red wine for the Marsala. I'm sure whatever the variation, this is a fine dish.

Recipe was very good. Topping with mozzarella makes it excellent. Pasta is the perfect starch for the sauce, though it needs parmesean. It makes for a quick mid week meal. Great for company!

My husband and I LOVED this recipe. Leftovers were delicious also! We will definitely make this succulent recipe again.

I used chicken and half the butter and didn't miss the fat. I also used slices of prosciutto and fontina on top, just at the end, which kept the prosciutto tender. I agree about wanting more sauce and will try it with double the broth and wine. My husband is begging me to make it again! Anybody have any suggestions on how to cut the gooey fontina into thin slices? A mandoline maybe?

I also made it with the prosciutto slice layed on top of the veal and a slice of fontina cheese. But I thought it was a little greasy with all the butter. I would liked for it to have a little more sauce.I would double the broth and wine and use less butter.But deffinately would make it again!

This is simply fantastic! I subbed chicken for the veal, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I loved the bit of crispness that the cornmeal added to the chicken, and the salty flavor of the prosciutto melds perfectly with the sweetness of the Marsala. This will be a frequent repeater in my house.

Very good and more importantly very easy!

It was delicious - even my teenage daughter liked it. I didn't like the grittiness of the cornmeal, and next time I will dredge the veal in flour instead. I also added some sliced baby bella mushrooms, which I sauteed separately.

The basic recipe is delicious, but I prefer to make it to conform to the Lido presentation in Venice, Italy. Instead of chopping the prosciutto, I place a slice on each piece of veal and after the veal and prosciutto are sauteed, I seal the prosciutto to the veal with a slice of fontina cheese.
