This dish is really great! Though I did make some modifications: I used all broth instead of milk to cook the polenta and added some sage. I then folded in a couple tablespoons of cream when rewarming and the polenta turned out really flavorful. I also cut out the oil entirely by using a non stick cooking spray, and substituted white wine for vermouth. As an earlier reviewer stated, the leeks did not reduce down to one cup so I pulled some out to use for later. I added a little roasted red pepper for some sweetness and color to garnish and it turned out beautifully! This recipe is so great to use as starting off point to make little adjustments and use other veggies. Enjoy!

When I first read this recipe, I thought Vermouth, 1/2 stick of butter, 4 cups of milk and cream?? Poor veggies! I modified a potentially soggy recipe by making Quinoa instead of polenta, roasted Cauliflower and used edamame instead of beans. I put in 2/3 of the butter instead of a whole stick. I omitted the shallots cause I thought the leeks would be enough savory flavor. and the recipe came out scrumptious! it's a lot of pots and pans but totally work the effort. Loved the flavor mix especially on top of quinoa. Next time I'll try to make more for leftovers!

'Twas delicious, with some modifications. I have a lot of dried porcini, so I soaked some in hot water and chopped them into the mix, also used chantrelles 'cause those are abundant in the Pacific NW right now, also didn't have cow's milk in the house so used soy milk, also my broth was mushroom broth. It was pretty and delicious. Didn't need cheese.

My whole family thought this was delicious. All of the flavors came through very well. Maybe some of those who thought it was lacking didn't add enough salt? They leave the seasoning up to you, and something like polenta really requires salt to bring out the flavors (and I think a generous amount of black pepper adds a real warmth to this recipe). The only issue was that there's no way 2 cups of leeks are going to reduce to 1/3 cup in 8 minutes. The vermouth kept boiling dry, and I ended up adding more. But the result (even though it was more than 1/3 cup) was amazingly flavorful creamy leek topping, with a brightness from the vermouth that was a great contrast to the earthy vegetables. Even though there are three separate components, each component is pretty simple (we used quick-cooking polenta, which saves time). Overall, definitely a success.

A lot of work, but good. We added some grated parmesan to the polenta and topped with toasted pinenuts. Might also add some garlic.

I loved all the ingredients in this recipe so wanted to like it. I had read the review where it said something was lacking so I added 2 garlic cloves to the mushrooms (I kept everything else true to the recipe) and I still think something is missing. Definitely not worth the effort.

I guess if I were a die hard vegetarian I would have liked this better. It was fresh and simple but just lacked something overall. I am glad I tried it but I wouldn't make it again.

This was very good, and not as labor intensive as I thought it would be. I made a lower fat version by using 1% milk instead of whole milk, cooking spray instead of olive oil, and I only used 2/3 the amount of butter and heavy cream called for.
