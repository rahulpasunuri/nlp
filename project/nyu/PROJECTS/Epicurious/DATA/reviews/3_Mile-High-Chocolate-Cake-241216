The word from here is dry, dry, dry and crumbly. I never had a cake that has come out like that. To start with there was way too much batter for 8 inch pans. It tried to run over. It would have been better to use a 9 or even a 10 inch pan so that you wouldn't have to bake it so long to get it done. I didn't even want to try the frosting recipe as I already wasted chocolate, cocoa and lots of butter on the cake. I followed the recipe to the letter. I won't be making this one again.

You have to understand how to bake to make this cake. First, whoever heard of just letting a cake cook the recommended time wthout starting to check it 10 minutes earlier? As to the ingredients, it truly is important to use high quality ingredients---used 80% cacao chocolate with great results. If the frosting is getting too 'greasy'for your taste, then stop one stick of butter short.

For the cook below: the instructions weren't in error. It's simply easier to whisk the milk in to dry ingredients already incorporated, and there's no harm in turning on the stove just before you pour the milk in. I almost didn't make this, mostly due to the poor reviews of the frosting. The frosting was excellent- much lighter and less sweet than the buttercream frostings so common in the US. The flavor and texture are much more like a meringue buttercream. So while it's a much faster and easier way to achieve that result, just like a meringue buttercream, it also means that if you try to eat a chilled cake, it's going to be like sucking on a stick of butter- not pleasant. Left at room temperature this was light and very tasty. Will definitely become a go-to, weather permitting.

Not a lot of flavor for all that work. Cake was dry, would suggest baking for less time. Also noticed error in frosting recipe. It says to place sugar, cocoa powder, and flour and heat. Then add milk. I would suggest the opposite. I would suggest another recipe.

I've made this cake twice now: it never fails to impress. It is marvelous. Extremely rich. Not too sweet, just the right consistency. People did not believe that I made this cake at home.

I absolutely love this cake! The frosting turned out fabulous.....my teenagers were eating it off of the spatula. Maybe making it in the winter, with less humidity, helped with it's success.

I have not made this cake yet, I plan on doing it tonight however I am seeing where a lot of people are saying its dry/heavy. I wanted to point out, if you are using all purpose flour for the cake instead of cake flour, it will be dry unless you portion it right. The general rule of substitution is 1 cup of all purpose flour minus 2 tablespoons (1c  2tbsp) is equivalent to 1 cup of cake flour. So it would be 2 3/4 cups flour MINUS 4 tablespoons then minus 1 1/2 tsp. Remember to measure AFTER you sift. Hopefully that helps :)

Easy recipe to follow. Used two 9x2 cake pans for it and made our own cake flour with all purpose flour and cornstarch; worked very well...We also used top quality ingredients as well such as Raw milk, cultured butter, select unsweetened chocolate and good eggs. The icing was velvety, smooth and silky-Not too sweet all around. Would probably add some bourbon to this recipe to bring it over the top. Use good ingredients as this recipe doesn't have too many and you'll be better off in the long run. The word cheap should enter you're vocabulary when grocery shopping.

I just made this cake today for a family get together and I was very disappointed. The cake was very dry and heavy. I followed the exact recipe and it was not moist at all. Will not use this recipe again. Allrecipes.com has a better recipe and the hershey's chocolate cake recipe is the BEST!

This cake came out great...except the frosting was -quite- bitter. i would suggest a bit more sugar (i had no extra on hand, but did have some 'fake' (betty crocker) chocolate frosting, which mixed in, sweetened it to perfection without being overly sweet and cloying.

Pretty much a waste of money and time. The cake, although made and baked per directions, was fairly dry and not particularly tender. The frosting was disgustingly greasy. Neither the cake nor the frosting was exceptionally chocolatey either. The best chocolate cake recipe is on the Herseys cocoa box, with the matching frosting and your own recipe ganache filling. Much more moist, chocolatey and delish. Just bake it in three 8" pans to make a tall presentation. Stay a mile away from this Mile-High recipe!

A Cooks is correct. Being an awesome 16 year old son, I made this for Father's Day. Used unsalted butter and Dark cooking Chocolate and it turned out PERFECT! Crispy on the outside, moist in the middle! I only gave this cake 3 forks as it is exceptionally rich and fatty AND IT WILL KILL YOU IF YOU EAT TOO MUCH, but otherwise tasty! My Dad and everyone loved it! It took 5 hours to create as I only had 1 cake pan and the 3rd layer broke when assembling the cake SO BE CAREFUL! Didn't matter though as I repaired it with icing and no-one noticed :D. I don't know what you guys did wrong but the recipe tells no lies, the frosting shouldn't come out tasting like butter, mine didn't. I don' know what you other n00bs did, but if a 16 year old MALE can make it, all you people who stuffed up FAILED MISERABLY, so please for human kind go back to nursery school and make mud patties.

Don't know what you guys did wrong. Used cooking chocolate, unslated butter and specialty cake flour. Convertedall measurments to metric, and it turned into a beautiful, rich, moist 4-layer cake. Not dry, butter, but rich and chocolatey. You guys just don't know how to bake!

I made this cake with some tripidation after reading the other bad reviews. It came out beautifully! very tasty, will be keeping recipe for further use! a trick though, I baked in two 9"x2" pans with parchment collars, no overflow. whipped frosting in mixer for quite a while untill it got very light, everyone loved it. also did not wast on ultra expensive chocolate, just used ghiradelli, worked wonderfully. baking time was less than stated, about 30-35 min. cake was moist with a nice crumb, sliced well and stayed together. might want to serve at room temp so that frosting is not hard. all in all very very good.

I made this as a birthday cake for my mother-in-law and brother-in-law this year and was excited to be making a chocolate cake that would be light and chocolaty. BOY was I disappointed when I cut and served it. It turned out beautiful, but was very dry, bland and the icing did not have any flavor except for a strong butter taste. I think this one needs to go back to the drawing board! Don't waste your time on this one!

This is not the tastiest chocolate cake I have ever made. It did come out on the dry side. I prefer my cakes very moist (falling apart moist!) though to be fair, I wasn't expecting this to be a moist cake. The frosting was way too buttery, even for a butter cream. It came out to a wonderful frosting consistency, but again, too much butter and not enough chocolate flavor. I ended up tossing the frosting and using a different chocolate frosting.

This recipe makes a dryish chocolate cake. I followed the directions to the limit, and it was slightly dry. People enjoyed the cake, but it was not intensely flavored or satisfying. The butter frosting is disgusting. I made it but didn't use it. I quickly made a ganache instead.

I wish I had read the reviews before I decided to give this cake a try. It wasn't that horrible as others suggested but it wasn't good. I won't even try to fix it, I'd better stick to my old-time more familiar recipes. It was dry and not as flavourful.

The cake looked divine but unfortunately it was a major disappointment. I completely agree with Jander 1901-cake dry, ingredients like excellent quality unsweetened chocolate wasted, and very time consuming. Looking over the other reviews it seems that at least half agree it was not a good cake. Maybe the recipe testers should re-work this recipe. Sue M. Longmeadow, Ma.

It was my sister's birthday and she requested the mile high chocolate cake. She had the first bite, her first word was "delicious!" It was is in my top ten favorite cakes EVER! we did half the recipe because I had read many reviews that said it had to much batter, we also halved the frosting. we cooked it for a little over 30 min. or more. It came out moist and rich it was amazing!

I read the reviews before I made the cake. I also used 3 9" pans, so I didnt have the over flow like some of the other bakers. I was surprised at the flavor though. It was not as chocolaty as I thought it would have been. It was also a little dry. But that can be solved by adding a little more liquid. The flovor to me could use more chocolate. It isnt a horrible recipe.

I made this cake for Xmas dinner and unfortunately hadn't read the many bad reviews. I used the 8 x2 inch pans, which weren't large enough so the batter seeped over the edges of the pan, making it hard to remove the cakes. I baked them 40 minutes, which was more than enough, so I can't imagine 50 minutes. When I sliced the cake horizontally, it was so dry and crumbly, it barely stayed together. As another reader pointed out there's no way the picture accurately depicts this recipe. I quickly frosted the layers and like a California mudslide, it started to fall. I was ready to toss it in the trash like some other readers did, but my optimistic and quick- thinking girlfriend suggested portioning it on fancy plates for our dinner. Nobody knew the difference at dinner, but I'd NEVER make this recipe again. I'm a trained chef, food writer and have been baking since I was 8, so I can't believe anyone could correctly do this recipe without major alterations i.e., a new size or type of cake pan and less baking time. One more tip to use up this cake: for another dinner the next day, I took the cake (by now it no longer resembled a cake, but a colossal baking mistake) out of the fridge for a couple of hours to soften it and then scooped out the cake and icing into small ramekins with a large ice cream scoop and decorated them with a whipped cream rosette and toasted almonds. The irony: my guests raved about this mousse-cake concoction and even asked for the recipe! Not sure how I'm going to tell them it was a mistake that I managed to salvage.

This cake was really good, definitely follow all directions carefully. I ended up with a ton of extra batter since I used 9 inch pans, so I made cupcakes. The leftovers are better if you warm them a bit.

Yes you need bigger baking pan. I used one 10 x 4 pan, pluse 8 medium cup cakes. And I only filled the cake pan 3/4 full, so the cake will have place to grow. I beated the eggs and sugar on standmixer, then I hand fold all the dry indredients and sour cream, so it doesn't get over mix. Good cake! I didn't use the frosting on this recipe, because I love my buttercream recipe. People should read the recipe first, before start make the frosting. If see something that doesn't look right, don't use it or change the recipe a little youself. yummy...........

I have absolutely no baking experience yet this recipe worked out amazingly well for me. One of the reviewers below mentioned that it was the details that were important here, so i paid attention. I followed his/her suggestion to beat the eggs for around 5 minutes at med speed, which I did using my stand mixer. i adjusted the baking time for my pans( 8.5"X2")- I knocked off about 8 minutes and they came out perfect! The frosting/ganache was a bit daunting: 6 sticks of butter! Yow! But it came out oh-so-good. Lightly sweet with a hint of cocoa bitterness, which is a nice balance to the sweetness of the cake itself. I made it the day before and just refridgerated it until the next afternoon. All it took was an hour or so sitting on the counter to get it back to room temp. A quick run through with my hand mixer fluffed it up, nice and creamy1 The frosting does have a buttery taste to it, but that's the point! Don't worry about it, it's not like you are eating cake like this every day, right? (I hope not) One other thing: If you need to refridgerate this one, make sure you take it out a few hours before serving, to let it get back to room temperature. The flavors are so much better that way! After reading some of the reviews below,I have to wonder. Are we becoming the type of people who walk into a French bakery and complain because they do not make Twinkies?

Should have read the reviews before making this gigundo flop! Worked a large part of the afternoon putting this cake together. Again...it looked just like the picture. We were very anxious to try it after dinner. We are throwing away all but 3 bites! One from each of us. DISASTER...and a total waste of great ingredients! The best thing we can say is that we got a good laugh at the end of the night when we read all of the past reviews.

I made the same mistake as some other reviewers the first time I made this cake: I used 1-1/2' deep pans, which were too short. The recipe calls for 2" pans, but I missed that part, so I had the chocolate lava overflow problem. However, the flavor and texture of the cake were so good that I made it again: this time using three 8" pans instead of 2, and they worked fine. If you spread the cake batter into a larger surface area than the recipe says, you will have to adjust the cooking time, and will have to make do with a different texture cake than if you make it in smaller, deeper pans as the recipe calls for. Thus, I'm looking for 2" x 8" cake pans to make this baby properly the next time. re the chocolate frosting: it is truly exceptional - not very sweet and deliciously creamy. The trick is to cool the custard completely. I used top quality ingredients: butter from grass-fed cows (better for your metabolism), Callebaut unsweetened chocolate, really fresh eggs. OMG I thought I was going to weep...worth every penny. This is going to be my #1 choice for chocolate cake for a long time.

A fairly good chocolate cake but a tricky recipe with details that can't be missed. I took the advise of other readers and used two 9 1/2 inch cake pans. Even then I only filled them 3/4 of the way, standard for any cake. The whipping of the eggs and sugar is extremely important to get a light, moist cake, I let it go for at least 5 minutes on a med-high speed, so the whipped eggs had more stable structure. I also reduced the baking time just until the centers set, chocolate cakes will always be dry if they over-bake. The cake itself was lovely, and moist, great flavor. The frosting was too loose and melty, I prefer a standard chocolate flavored Italian buttercream or whipped ganache. Over all pretty good but by the third day the cake had lost most of its moisture.

I thought this cake looked delicious when I saw the picture. My mother requested it for her birthday. My first go around, the batter overflowed from the pans all over my oven--started a fire because there was so much of it. DISASTER! Since my mom requested it, I bought three 9 inch cake pans, which worked well, in terms of size. I did not spilt the layers. I did not bake it the entire time the recipe called for. It was so dry!!!! UGH! Like another reviewer said, she had to throw away 1/2 a cake; I did too. Chocolate cakes never get thrown away in our house. They should put a disclaimer on this recipe--too much batter for 2 cake pans. The icing was the best part of the cake, but at its best it was mediocre. What an expensive disappointment.

When I saw the picture and the recipe in my Gourmet magazine I thought, "this will be awesome." I followed the recipe exactly and the cake did look very much like the picture; however, the taste was very disappointing. How can you go wrong with 6 sticks of butter in the frosting? The frosting was buttery but tasted like unsweetened chocolate. The cake, despite the claims of tenderness from the sour cream was very dry. I took it to a New Years Eve Party and everyone was very complimentary; however, I made it home with the majority of the cake. Even my 4 yo and 2 yo kids did not finish theirs let alone ask for seconds. I ended up throwing about 1/2 of it away. Wow, what a disappointment.

I was dying to try a new chocolate cake recipe and it was between this and another one that was similar. I am very glad I tried this one -- it worked out beautifully and was very rich and moist. I used my own favorite milk chocolate buttercream icing (from The Cake Bible by Rose Levy Berenbaum), which was a perfect match. The cake is so rich that it would also be nice without any icing -- I'd bake it in some mini- bundt pans and serve with just a big dollop of espresso whipped cream. Like other cooks quoted here, I would recommend 9-inch pans as opposed to 8-inch -- the cake rose beautifully and evenly in the 9-inch pans, whereas the 8-inch pans would have resulted in a huge dome in the middle that would have had to be trimmed off for the layers to sit properly. I used top-quality chocolate and it was worth it. I would highly recommend this cake.

FYI about the frosting A pound and a half of butter is enough frosting for two cakes. To save your bellies a night of pain. I would advise you not to split the layers, and to save the additional frosting for another cake.Since its custard base, Refridgerate after after making .The cake can stand a night in the fridge, and bring to room temp before serving.Stay away if your lactose intolorent (sp). That said, I plan on making the frosting this weekend. Wow custard frosting (my term) can't wait !

The cake recipe is very good but because I used 4 1" inch pans the cook time was too long. My cake was a little dry. I will make the cake again but I think the frosting recipe is horrible. My stomach became very upset after eating it. I was sick for several hours during the night and my stomach hurt the following day. In fact the thought of butter still make me nauseous. Six sticks of butter in the frosting is to much...by the way this is not an old age thing.

My niece requested a chocolate cake with chocolate icing for her 8th birthday. After ready a lot of recipes, and reviews, I decided to try this cake-since it had no reviews. In response to the reviewer from MI-I used 2-9" cake pans and once the layers were split I had a beautiful "mile high" cake. The cake really rose during baking-I can only imagine how much higher it would have been if I had used an 8" pan! This recipe is for a VERY rich chocolate cake so yes it is "toothsome." Although the icing was not overly sweet. Do make sure you really beat it well during the cooking process. I made the cake and icing the night before I assembled them. I let icing warm back to room temp then threw it back into the mixer and whip it again. It was really easy to work with! My niece and family were really pleased with this cake!

I resent it when your pictures are not an acurate view of the finished product.This cake is not the size of the cake in the recipe. It is a HIGH cake. The recipe calls for 2 2" high pans and the layers are split in half. Hello, that means a cake approximately 4+ inches tall. This cake looks more like 8" tall, two recipes? These layers do not look as though they have been split in half. This turns me off and and I am not inclined to try a recipe that is lying to be before I even start. Comments anyone?

My sister-in-law asked me to bring a chocolate cake for Christmas dinner. It seemed that this recipe would be the PERFECT treat for a Christmas feast. Because I was working on Christmas Eve I made the layers on Dec. 23 and set them aside. I worked really hard on this cake, following the recipe with care and taking time to do everything the right way -- after all, "Christmas comes but once a year." Of course, I ran into some trouble. I was unable to find cake flour other than "organic whole grain pastry flour" at Whole Foods. We were unable to find real cake flour at our more ordinary grocery store. It's so like Gourmet to call for an ingredient like cake flour and then to offer no alternatives if it's not available. In the end of the day, however, the cake seemed fine although somewhat "toothsome. " It wasn't as smooth as you'd expect from cake flour. I still don't know if I should have just used my ordinary flour (which is quite good) or should have gone with "organic whole grain pastry flour." We also had trouble making the fudge like base for the frosting and had to throw it out and start over on Christmas morning! The cake looked just like the picture here on the site and it was greeted with great excitement at the dinner. After we got home from the dinner, however, we didn't feel so well... I think that all the butter in the frosting (SIX STICKS) did not sit well with our systems (and we're not that old, either!). I still have an upset system two days later... I would recommend looking at Gourmet from January 2001 when layer cakes were featured on the cover. I have made the cake on the cover and it was outstanding.
