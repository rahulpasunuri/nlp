3 and 1/2 forks...after allowing the creme fraiche to sit for 12 hours, I chill it in the fridge for an extra day, and I find this makes the perfect consistency - nice and thick. Great recipe, I think it is better than the buttermilk version.

Delicious ! Here in Brazil we can make it and use it right away, lol !

Good recipe, but I had trouble finding non-ultra pasturized heavy whipping cream. I also don't think it needs to stay out for 12 hours.

I made this recipe because I couldn't find Creme Fraiche already prepared. Also, I didn't have buttermilk which other recipes call for. 24 hours?--well, didn't have the time. I set it on top of the fridge in our garage (summer in FL.)Used about 7 hours later-perfect!

I use this all the time - our local grocery does not stock the store-bought kind year round.
