I made this the first time as written. It is tasty. The second time I made it, I added parsnips, celery, and carrots. Also, it needed a lot of help, and I spiced it up with chili powder, powdered sumac, and many more herbs from my cabinet. After swirling with my hand mixer, it is now part of my soup list. It is drop dead delish!

I think delicacies related to eggs are rich in nutrition and benefit to humanbody. Thank you for sharing.

up the garlic 50%, added some shallots and celery to the mix, included the broccoli directly into the soup, finished with some good olive oil and chives with a small dollop of plain yogurt. makes an excellent flavour.

Found this to be very bland. I tried to punch it up with soy sauce and some other ideas, but probably won't make it again. Felt very healthy though.
