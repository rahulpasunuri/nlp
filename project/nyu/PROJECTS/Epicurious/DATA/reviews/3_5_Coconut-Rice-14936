I can't justifiably give the recipe four stars, but if I could give three and a half I definitely would! This is very tasty as a side dish for a spicy main dish, just as the description indicates. I used basmati rice, about a cup and a half of the new coconut milk that Silk came out with and no water, and threw in a cinnamon stick. I also toasted about a cup of sweetened flaked coconut before hand and added roughly 3/4 to the rice at the end. Very mild and delicious rice dish!

I didn't like this recipe, it wasn't so much the texture that I didn't like, but it was the flavor. It was pretty bland.I made this recipe exactly as written. I wound up using 'most' of the salt {that some other reviewers said was too much salt}, I added it just to give some life to the rice. I think this rice does need 'something'. I wasn't expecting it to be fancy but I was expecting it to taste better. I am going to try other versions of this recipe from this site & from my cookbook to see if I can find a better recipe.

This is not a sweet rice, but you definately get the coconut flavor. The teaxture was creamy like a risotto. I used jasmine rice, and since all rice has different moisture and cooking requirements, I had to watch it carefully and add more water to get it to the proper doneness. My family loved the rice and paired it with a spicy chicken. I also didn't have any toasted coconut, and I believe that would have added another level of flavor. My son saved the left overs and added some cold milk and sugar tomake it a quick desert pudding.

An extra guest at dinner made the white rice that I bought too little for the recipe, so I was able to try brown rice instead, which worked well. I added some sugar at the end and was pleased with the sweetness that it added.

Fantastic! Made with the Mnemba Lodge Shrimp and Mango salad. Used basmati rice, which required a little extra fluid to get tender. I just alternated a splash of coconut milk with a splash of water until I was happy with the texture.

A great side dish for my semsame pork. I followed the advice of other reviewers and I used only 1/4 tsp of salt, and added 1 tsp of sugar, and used jasmine rice. I added in some scallions at the end which kicked it up a notch.

I always find it funny when all these wanna be chefs alter recipes in these reviews. I can see making a slight adjustment here or there but most make the recipe sound like something I wouldn't feed to my dog. This is perfect just the way it is. I have made it twice and the ONLY thing I had to do was add a touch more water toward the end and give it a stir. Came out perfect each time - a little sticky but not too much with a great coconut flavor.

Rating: 3
I am not sure what all the disappointment is all about - fairly straight forward recipe, straight forward results. Based on the feedback of previous users I eliminated salt all together and divided the liquid equally among coconut milk and water and the result was pleasantly flavored coconut rice. Not too sticky or underdone or too salty, just right as a side dish to a island flavored marinated pork. I think previous readers expect too much from a simple little recipe - it was perfect!

Too much salt, wrong grain rice (should be medium grain - the same kind you'd use for rice pudding).

I was really disappointed in this. It was not sticky and had very little coconut flavor. Also, it needed some sweetening. I'm used to a sticky, sweet coconut rice from Thai restaurants and this was nothing like that.

As made, this recipe is too salty and rich for my taste, especially for regular consumption.

I have to agree with the cook from Portman. I followed the recipe as written and had to add more liquid, cook longer, and chew more. While I did enjoy the rice once it was finished I would definately try some of the additive suggestions by the other cooks next time. It does seem to need a little something.

Rating: 4
Delicious. I made it twice this week. This recipe also works with long-grain brown rice, though it takes much longer to cook. As other reviewers said, 1/2 tsp salt was a bit much. Since it was too salty I added about 1/2 tsp-1 tsp sugar and it was amazing. Whenever I make this now I will use the salt and sugar because it makes it perfectly sweet and salty.

Rating: 3
Wow, I just made a new version of this. YUMYYYYYYYYYY! To modify - add 1 stalk of lemon grass sliced after water/coconut milk has boiled, but before rice is added. Cover, turn off heat and steep 30 minutes. Remove lemongrass with slotted spoon and proceed, adding more water is necessary (a teaspoon to a tablespoons worth). This is divine!!!

I read the many reviews and made the following changes: I heated 1 1/2 cups unsweetened coconut milk and 1/2 water to boil first, then added 1 cup of Basmati rice and a pinch of salt. Simmered covered for 20 minutes. Then tossed in about 1/2 cup toasted sweet coconut and 1/4 cup toasted almond slivers, and 1 diced mango. It was perfect and not sticky at all, just slightly sweet. Great leftover too which was surprising! Went great with the Brazilian Coconut Shrimp Kebabs (from How to Grill cookbook).

Rating: 3
Pretty good! Doubled it to serve 4 people. Texture was so-so, as described, but just not my taste. Flavor was great though, coconut really shined. Served with sauted corn, black beans, and red bell pepper, and this was pretty good and easy, although not perfect. I think it may be better as a stand alone dish. or served with beans or whatever on the side, rather than on top, so you can really experience the coconut, rather than just a sweet undertone.

Made this as directed, reducing the salt by half, and everyone loved it. It appears in Gourmet as part of a Brazilian menu, and we had it like that the first time. The next time, we had it with Indian food, and it was just as good.

Doubled the recipe and took some others advice used a clove of garlic and about a tablespoon of minced ginger. Used basmati rice and it was delicious! The key was letting it sit for 10 minutes before fluffing and serving.

First time I made it, I made the mistake of using short grain rice - it ended up in the circular files. Next time I made it, I used long grain rice and followed the directions exactly - to start... I ended up having to add an additional 8 oz water and had it cook 15+ minutes longer. It still had a bit of a bite to it - which in my mind means undercooked. I want to do it again tomorrow and follow some of the others suggestions. I plan on cooking down the coconut milk and trying the water and coke method. I'll post the results.

Many other commenters have provided excellent ideas for giving this rice some pizaz. Serve it with the Coconut Crusted Fried Shrimp (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/103751) and you won't need to spice it up.

Rating: 3
I've made this a couple of times this week. The first time I made it I followed the directions exactly. It had a nice flavor but was a little too salty and it was a little bland (though it would be perfect as a side for a very spicy dish). The second time I sauteed minced garlic and ginger before adding the rice and it was better. The third time I added the ginger and garlic, all the salt and then added some black beans, chopped fresh cilantro, lime juice, lime zest and toasted sweetened coconut and THAT was fabulous. I know it's pretty far off from the original recipe, but it as good. I served it w/ the Calypso Pork and it was perfect.

Rating: 3
This recipe makes a great coconut rice all by itself. The second time I made it, I added a little dried cilantro (which I couldn't really taste) and about 2 T. toasted sweetened coconut, which adds a really nice sweetness to it. I also halved the salt, as some mentioned that it was too salty. It was sticky, but not mushy and a very nice accompaniment to strongly flavored main dishes.

Rating: 3
I used this as a good basic recipe. I added 1 T. butter to coconut milk, water and salt, and added about 2 T. basil frisee and 1/2 t. of coarsely ground cardamom just before serving. Delicious! My kids loved it too: "Way better than plain rice!"

Rating: 1
My rating is based on using red rice. It appears red rice takes much longer to cook, something like twice as long. And the 1/2 tsp of salt made this dish much too salty, and the extended cooking time only intensified the saltiness. And finally, I had to use 1 cup of coconut milk and 1/2 cup of water for just a 1/2 cup of red rice. Next time, I'll stick to the recipe and use basmati before experimenting with the unknown. ;)

I am not rating this because I made a BIG mistake - I used long grain brown rice. The result was flavorless and undercooked after 25 minutes. I even added chopped mango. In spite of my mistake I may keep looking for a more flavorful sounding coconut rice recipe.

I disagree with the rating from the person from Puerto Rico...um, this is an Asian recipe and this IS how we make it. There are plenty of coconut rice recipes that are Latino in origin...if you were looking to make one of those that resemble something you grew up with, you ahould not be looking at as Asian recipe. This is reliably delicious and a hit, with the nice coconut hint of sweetness. It is supposed to be a little sticky and you should not be able to separate every grain with a fork.

Rating: 3
I feel guilty rating this, as I always have an issue with people who change the recipe then rate it. However, that being said, I made it according to diannavh's tip (boiling the coconut milk down to golden bits). I then added 1 Tbls. brown sugar, 1 tsp salt, and 2 Tbls. raisins, 1 cup rice, and 1 1/2 cups water (no coke). It was perfect. Even my unadventurous husband liked it. I served it with Sticky Coconut Chicken from Sunset Magazine's web site. Delicious, and surprisingly, not too coconuty.

I hated it....I am spanish(Puerto Rico) and this is a rice dish that we make often, but we do not make it like this, our rice is fork tender(with a slight bite) grainy(you can separated with a fork) if you want to make this recepie and trully enjoy it, all you have to do is fallow the directions for boiled spanish rice and substitute the water for the coconut milk(half milk, half water) try it you will love it....

I didn't really make this recipe the way it was written but read diannavh's tip and made it her way with boiling coconut milk reducing it to golden pieces (about 35 min), then added liquid (1/2 water and 1/2 coke), raisins, brown sugar and salt. It came out fabulously! That recipe is a definite 4 forker! Thanks diannavh!!!

I've enjoyed Coconut rice for years. My mother's from the coast of Colombia (coconut rice is a specialty there) and somehow this dish doesn't quite measure up. Here's a tip - take 1 can of coconut milk and boil til reduced (keep your eye on it and keep stirring) til the milk looks like cottage cheese and then turns into caramelized brown bits (not too dark). Stir in 2 cps rice then add half water, half coke (for color) enough to cover rice (as you would normally for steaming rice), add some raisins, some salt and sugar (in equal parts) to taste. You will have a toasted, yet mild and not too sweet coconut rice. DELICIOUS.

The flavor was more dessert-like than I'd like for a side dish. I made this in my rice cooker which always gives me perfect fluffy rice, but the grains were still a little firm after cooking (even though there was plenty of liquid). It was also a bit on the heavy side. Maybe I would try this again with either light coconut milk or with more water, but I'd pick plain white rice any day over this.

We've had this a number of times, and it's always a hit.

I didn't have any coconut milk so I used 1 cup hot boiling water over 2 cups unsweetened coconut and let it steep or 30 min. I then blended it and drained it through a sieve, which gave me just enough coconut milk for this recipe. At the end of cooking the rice, I added green onions and almonds - It was great!

As a coconut lover, I really enjoyed this rice recipe. The coconut flavour in the rice was subtle, but by adding additional toasted coconut you can make the rice sweeter if you choose. I used batsmati rice instead of plain long grain, I also reduced the salt as per previous reviews. Cooking time was as the recipe suggested and I had perfect rice not a bit sticky. I will make this rice again and again.

This is a delicious change from ordinary rice. I used light coconut milk, jasmine rice, and cooked in my rice cooker and it turned out beautifully. The toasted coconut is a definite must.

I've always been rice-cooking impaired and have almost never been able to make any kind of rice. This recipe however has changed all that and I feel slightly more competent in the rice department.

Having had success with this recipe gives me hope for the future. :-)

I love coconut rice, but I've only once cooked rice successfully (the secret was buying a flame tamer for my ancient gas range). I had to save this by adding lots of water at the end, but I think that's just because I have always burned my rice in the past - not this time though!

Good dish, the type of milk give different results--both good. Using regular unsweetened coconut milk makes for a creamier rice. Using the light coconut milk is less creamy, but also less fatty and the taste is bit more subtle. Paired this dish with the macadamia crusted yellowtail.

Maybe I did something wrong. I used regular long grain rice, big mistake, but it was all on hand. The rice didn't really cook well. It was more on the rubbery hard side.

I use this recipe often when serving spicy curried shrimp or fish dishes. The basic recipe is very good but bland. To bring it to life I do the following at the end: After it has finished cooking and has been off the heat at least 5 minutes add juice of 1/2 lime and zest of 1 lime.

This is also nice paired with spicy foods. I made it with the tandoori-spiced chicken breasts, and topped it with toasted coconut. Delicious.

I made this as a side dish to Ginger Flank Steak w/ Sake Glazed Vegetables and it was a nice accompaniment to this main dish.

The PERFECT version of this recipe (made in a Sunbeam Instant Steamer): 1 1/2 cup coconut milk; 1/4 cup water; 1/2 tsp salt; 1 cup BASMATI rice.

I love coconut rice, but the key to really good rice is the KIND of rice you use. To get this recipe just right you can't use Uncle Ben's. Try Jasmine Rice or Basmati. Also, substitue chicken broth for the water. I added cubed pieces of fresh mango to the rice too. It is awesome. I made this dish for the 3rd or 4th time for a dinner party this weekend and the guests kept going back for more. It was a huge hit.

I used basmati rice for this recipe. I didn't add any salt and didn't miss it. I would have liked a sweeter taste, such that I could have eaten just the rice as a meal. However it was a very good companion for vegetable stir-fry. Next time I will cut out the water and make up for it with coconut milk.

This recipe is a wonderful change from plain old rice. I made some additions and would highly recommend trying them. Sauted minced ginger( @ 1TBL) and scallions (4) in about 1TBL of oil. Then added the remaining ingredients. Thanks to previous reviewers I halved the salt. It was enough. Do not leave out the TOASTED COCONUT TOPPING - I think it really sends this dish over the top. ( I also mixed some in ) - for those wanting a more pronounced sweet/coconut flavor.
