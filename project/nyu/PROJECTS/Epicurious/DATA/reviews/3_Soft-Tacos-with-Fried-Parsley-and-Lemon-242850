Yes... it does sound weird, but I thought these were uber delicious! Light... refreshing... be sure to use the curly leaf parsley. It's essential for the texture.

Wonky sounds like an adequate description. But I dont know about delicious. We made these for a friend's goodbye party because her favorite food is parsley. Even she wasnt impressed. To quote another guest : "Man I like my food but those tacos were just about the worst thing ive ever eaten. What were you guys thinking?" The parsley isnt that bad but the lemons are pretty awful.

I know... it sounds completely wonky. I'm here to tell you that this is absolutely delicious and addictive. Take care that the parsley is absolutely dry when you fry it. Italian parsley would not substitute well in this dish.
