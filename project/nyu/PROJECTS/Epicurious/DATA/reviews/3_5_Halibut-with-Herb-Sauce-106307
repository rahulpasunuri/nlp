This is delicious! I double the herbs while keeping the olive oil and lemon juice at 6 tablespoons each. I also grill the halibut for about 9 minutes....perfect flavor!!!!

Great recipe. Be sure to get some nice thick cuts of halibut for it. You might want to try this for an upscale Sunday Brunch which I did for my family in California. My uncle, who isn't much of a fish eater absolutely loved it.

This was terrific and easy to prepare. Everyone in my family loved it.

This is a great dish when you don't really feel like cooking, but you want something that tastes gourmet. I substituted halibut for sea bass as halibut is not in season and it was great. Added a pinch of sugar to the sauce and that took away some of the acidity. Also brolied as directed but then added more olive oil,covered and baked for 10 mins. at 400 degrees. Made the fish a lot more tender.

the sauce is too sharp for the fish, not just the lemon but all the herbs. tastes very fresh but not a good match. also not keen to broil halibut, it does better baked or sauted.

Easy and delicious! I added a pinch of jamaican spice ruba and a tiny piece of garlic. Also used dried chives as I didn't have fresh on hand.

Wow. This dish could not be easier and tastier! this was so good and my husband was so impressed! I followed the recipe to the letter and did not find it too salty, I even marinated the fish in some garlic salt and pepper as one review suggested and it was great. I served this dish with some steamed red potatoes and sauteed green beans. It was delicious. the next time I make though I will halve the recipe as it made double the amount of sauce for 2 people--we froze for next time though so it won't go to waste.

The sauce was great, not to over powering! I marinated the fish with garlic, olive oil and a curcurma type African sauce first and the fresh herbs afterward really made it perfect.

I hate fish, but I went back for seconds on this one. We didn't have fresh chives, so used dried, the basil was from our garden, and we used cilantro instead of parsley as that is also from our garden. Both kids cleaned their plates as well

Use less lemon juice. I also drizzled herb sauce over my boiled fingerling potatoes - delicious.

Excellent with some changes suggested by previous comments. I used 4 tbls lemon juice, 4 tbls olive oil, a couple of tbls tarragon that I had on hand, a green onion, a garlic clove, and 1/4 tsp hot sauce. It still seemed bitter so I added a half tbl honey which smoothed it out. I hope this helps. Enjoy.

Excellent, with a few adjustments. Thanks to the previous reviewers, I made some changes. I used 4 tbls lemon juice, 4 tbls olive oil, some left over tarragon, green onion, 1/4 tsp hot sauce. It still had a slight bitter taste so I added a half tbl honey which smoothed it out nicely. I hope this helps.

The sauce needs about half the lemon and/or twice the herbs. But once you get the sauce right, this dish is delicious! And it is quite quick and simple.

Made a version of this last night and it was wonderful! Used tarragon instead of basil and had it on grilled salmon. Very easy and soooo good!

Hmm, one fork = Just so-so. Did not know that. At any rate the lemon in the sauce is ridiculously overpowering. After tasting it I doubled everything else added a half clove of garlic and it was barely "ok". Seems like it might have been a good start but by no means a finished recipe.

Nice recipe, and the sauce could be used on vegies too.

This recipe was very easy to make and delicious. The store was out of chives so I substituted green onions and used cilantro instead of parsley. I also tweaked the recipe to accomodate only 2 pieces of fish instead of 6.

Fantastic, healthy sauce

This dish was quick, easy, delicious, and pretty! The herb sauce couldn't have been easier, and it livened up flavor and the presentation of the halibut.

Excellent recipe to add flavor without alot of calories. Very South Beach friendly! Use it with scallops too.

This was easy and fantastic. I also suggest serving this on other fish selections or chicken breast. Serve with a crisp grassy white wine.

Well, I normally "can't cook" so I definately suprised everyone when I made this paired with an asparagus rissoto. It was great, quick and sooooo easy- If I could make this anyone can! I do agree though that the sause could use just a bit lesslemon juice, I will definately make this again.

Because everyone else had such success with this recipe - I know it should be very good. I,however, managed to blow it and ended up with a very runny, watery, rather bitter sauce. I managed to salvage it - it no longer resembled the original - but I blame the chef not the recipe. My hat is off to the rest of you. I think I'll try something else next time..

This receipe made me look so good in so little time. My 3-year-old asked for thirds--my husband had to reluctantly give up some of his. Great w/ garlic roasted vegetables and flavorable bread such as sourdough. I'll do this for company.

The lemon was way too strong. I might try it again, but I'd offset the lemon juice with something sweet, maybe OJ or a touch of honey? Or maybe a fish that isn't so delicate, such as salmon.

I can't believe anybody wouldn't LOVE this! I always order fish at fine restaurants and this is up there with the best of them. It is simple and delicious!

This was delicious! I thought the lemon might be too strong, but turned out it's a nice balance for the herbs. Very easy to make, too.

great but save some of the sauce to add on later

This dish was absolutely garden fresh! I was skeptical when I first saw it but it was great. The sauce was even good on the rice!! It did not take a lot of time and I would definately make this again and again.

It was OK, I'd make it in a time pinch. I wouldn't add it to the rotation.

Personally its hard to do much on halibut without a sauce- this wasn't bad but I wouldn't do it again.

Rating: 3
Excellent dish - this works well with salmon and particularly well with red snapper. The combination of herbs produces an alluring subtlety that is difficult to achieve with such ease. If you are feeling a little randy, try adding fresh garlic.

Wow! This sauce is so tasty. I made green beans with it and used the sauce for beans too. I had a problem making my sauce as thick as the one in the picture. Any ideas on this?

The sauce is a must try. I was skeptical, but it was FANTASTIC. I grilled the halibut in a fish basket so it wouldn't fall apart on the grill. Served it with sweet white corn cut off the cob and salad. The combination of the sweet corn and halibut with the sauce was fabulous. I will make this again for guests. Even my kids liked this recipe. Huge hit, try it you won't be disappointed!

Versatile and wonderful! This was great on halibut and also on potatoes, cauliflower, and tomatoes. This sauce could make shoe leather taste good. This is a keeper!

Excellent and versatile sauce. Try it as a cocktail sauce for shrimp.

Wonderful and easy. I am very fat concious so I substituted chicken broth for most of the oil. Cooked on a George Forman, which I love, and we make again.

Lighthearted, clean-flavored, and tasty. Good for a spring dish, and the sauce indeed will go well with fresh veggies and as a special-edition ceviche blend. I'm glad I can take the oil and had no need to reduce it.

the sauce is incredible over vegetables, potatoes, rice, as a salad dressing, you name it. I'll be whipping it up a lot this summer.

A good springtime recipe, but nothing I'd pass on to friends or make for a dinner party. I added garlic & green onions to the other sauce ingredients for extra kick.

I substantially reduced the olive oil. We found the sauce to be quite refreshing over both the halibut fillet and asparagus.

A little bland, but it was perked up by the addition of a dash of Tabasco. The kiddies liked it well enough (but said they still prefer cod!)

I thought this fish was great. It tasted very light and fresh. I reduced the amount of oil, so it would be lower in fat.
