I gave this 4 forks because it is definitely company worthy. Not only is it interesting with a fabulous mix of flavors, the presentation is great.

This salad is a meal in itself! It makes a beautiful presentation on the plate and has never failed to wow guests. This dressing works well but I have also tried it with a fruit based dressing for contrast with exceptional results.

I thought this was excellent. Was very light. I used prosciutto, and wonder if the serrano ham would have given it a bigger kick.

I loved the relish (I added a clove of minced garlic and let it sit overnight). I used this recipe to make two servings instead of four, but should have cut the ham in half (salty). It was a nice change from what we've had before.
