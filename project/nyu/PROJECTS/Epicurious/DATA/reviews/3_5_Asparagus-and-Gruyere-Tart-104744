Excellent! Made as prescribed except I used a 10" tart pan. Also-use a good quality cheese and if you can get a good peppercorn blend (like Williams Sonoma)you will taste the difference.

Made this several times. The first time according to the stated recipe and the outcome was very good. Subsequent preparations included a few slight changes. The revisions included: not peeling the asparagus; use a tart pan instead of a pizza pan, use about a cup and a half of cheese; use cream in making the crust instead of the milk. The outcome has been superb every time. The item has been highly complimented every time it has been made.

Really delicious - will definitely make again.

Excellent in all respects. Peeling asparagus is unnecessary, two pounds is plenty; before baking crust for last 10 minutes, glaze all over with milk/egg wash for no leaks and a crispy crust; parmesan and pancetta or bacon are nice additions along with a sprinkling of fresh chives before serving.

If I've ever made a better pie crust, I don't recall it -- this was just amazing. Be sure to bake the tart long enough, or like me, you'll have a runny center, but the crust was so danged fantastic it didn't even matter.

Heavenly good! Can't comment on the recipe because I only chose the recipe for my gourmet cooking club for someone else to make but she said it was pretty easy. Crust is moist, buttery and tasty, filling is fluffy and delicious.

Basic but great. I used a combo of green and white (it was a nice look and less expensive). Also used a tart pan to give it a nicer appearance and as an added value I now have two six inch tart crusts from the pastry dough waiting in the freezer for another use. Will definitely use the dough for other savory tarts.

My husband and I both love quiche and asparagus. We did not love this recipe. The crust was delicious, but very rich and the flavor of the quiche was bland, if not a little on the sweet side. Perhaps it was the combination. A great deal of work for what I thought was disappointing at best.

This recipe makes such a nice presentation. I made it for Mother's Day and it was a big hit.

This was a dish beyond compare for sure. I thought that it was the best tasting aparagus tart that I have ever eaten...and I only used a good domestic swiss cheese for it. Great cheese would only make it all the better. I will serve this from now on, for appitizers, for a light lunch, and for no reason at all....it was fantastic! Make it just as it is, the crust is wonderful!

I have done it many times and enjoy it a lot everytime. People ask where did I get this wonderful recipe. Thank you so much!!!

My family and I loved this recipe and I will definitely make it again. To give this recipe extra flavor, we plan to sautee crimini or button mushrooms in butter and 2 - 3 tablespoons of madeira, then chop into small pieces and add to the tart in between the asparagus. My pizza pan was difficult to remove from the oven without breaking the built-up edges of the tart. To solve this problem, I purchased the 14" preseasoned cast iron Lodge Pizza Pan with handles from Williams Sonoma's current catalog.

This is an excellent recipe - it made a great appetizer at our recent Christmas Eve dinner party. The crust was excellent, though with practice, I'm sure I could make it look a little less "rustic."

This recipe was relatively easy to make and turne out very tasty. I will definately make it again and probably do 50% cream 50% milk. It is in the spirit of quiche which I adore. If you like asparagus and gruyere pies this is pretty tasty. The dish is also beautiful.

To the other SF cook, looking to kick up the flavor: you might try substituting fontina for some or all of the gruyere; keeping in mind it's a particularly aromatic (i.e. stinky) cheese. One Market Restaurant, here in The City, has an asparagus & fontina lasagne on their current menu, and I think the combo works pretty great. Another solution might be to incorporate some dijon into the custard?

I have never made pie crust before and this turned out wonderfully. I also made this for Easter dinner and my guests had a difficult time deciding what was best - the visual appeal or the taste!! The purpose for the folding and rolling is to make a flakier crust- it's how puff pastry is made. Yummy

I, too, found the tart a bit bland. It was very rich, but lacked enthusiasm. I like the idea of adding prosciutto. I made this in two rectangular tart pans (11 x 4)and it turned out perfectly. I didn't have a problem w/a thin crust and the row of asparagus looked lovely. Everybody loved it, but I feel it could be improved.

Rating: 3
I added dry-cured black olives in the center which made it look most appealing. A very thin first layer of proscuitto was added to give added depth of flavour. Appealed to everyone.

To the cook from San Francisco: You may want to try to stick with the Gruyere cheese and add some chopped up prosciutto. Or, if you want all veggies, I would maybe try something stronger - like Roquerfort cheese. This cheese is stronger than Bleu cheese, so be careful!

Anyone have any suggestions to make the filling more flavorful - perhaps recommend a cheese w/ more bite? I added some fresh thyme to the custard, which resulted in an earthy herb taste.

I made this as an appetizer for a party and everyone liked it. I also opted for the tart pan and again 2lbs of asparagus are plenty. I did feel the dish a bit too light, if not for the gruyere, it wouldn't have much flavor. Maybe just a sprinkling of kosher salt or a flavored salt would help bring out the flavor more. I would make this again, it is a very attractive dish, especially from the tart pan.

I used an 11 inch tart pan which was perfect. This is a tasty, easy to prepare dish. I'll definately make it again.

Be really careful building up the edge. Next time, I'll use a tart pan because mine leaked too. I carefully removed it because of the last comment and it turned out great! Looks really nice.

my tips, being someone who doesn't make many pies / tarts: if you use a pizza pan, be sure to build up a little edge of crust that will hold in the filling. i didn't do this well enough and my filling leaked over the side and underneath the crust, where the sugars in the milk proceeded to give me a lovely layer of carbon on the bottom of the tart. i've had grief from custards before and don't like using heavy cream, so i used 2% milk instead. i sprinkled a quarter-teaspoon of gelatin on the milk and let it soften for about 20 minutes before i actually prepared the rest of the filling. (basically, a panna cotta.) overall a great dish; mine would have been better un-carbonized.

I brought this as my contribution to Easter dinner. The first go round I forgot the shortening, so had to make the crust over again - the RIGHT way (I was bringing it to my mother's house, need I say more). I too found that 2 lbs. of asparagus was more than enough! I used a 12" pizza pan and found the filling to be skimpy. Next time I would definitely use the tart pan for a nicer presentation.Perhaps too,I would add more filling. The taste was very good, quite rich, and a lovely,flakey crust. I would definitely make this again for a special occasion.

This is a great dish...very easy to make and delicious! I bought only 2 lbs apsparagus and found it to be enough to fill the 12-inch tart pan I opted to use. I altered the cooking time slightly to 26 minutes for filled tart and I broiled it for about 4 minutes. I also chilled the dough overnight and believe the extra rolling is necessary for flakiness and makes it easier to work with. Everyone loved it...even people who had never tried asparagus before! I almost forgot...I made it a day ahead of time (for Easter dinner) and reheated it in the oven for about 20 minutes...it was perfect!

This was on my menu for Easter dinner. My daughter said it was the first time that she had asparagus without it being all stringy. And I did not peel the asparagus. I used most of the three pounds by going around the "wheel" with long spokes as much as I could then starting trimming to make shorter ones and added just tips in the center. No problem with custard leaking through the crust. I baked my crust in a 14" cast iron skillet the day before. I poked it with a fork before chilling being sure not to overdue the "pokes". I also cooked my asparagus the day before and laid it on paper towels to dry then refridgerated (this step probably could have been eliminated). I took it out the next morning and again put it out on paper towels to warm and dry. The crust was very good and very flaky. Not an every day dish but is certainly a dish fit for company and/or a special occasion.

i'm slowly graduating from dishwasher to exec. chef in my own kitchen, and this recipe was exhilerating. i was overjoyed to see that it made no mention of peas. . . i love you kitten.

This dish is absolutely fabulous! A bit of work to prepare, so it's not on my list of weekday menus, and yes, too much asparagus is called for. It's on my menu for Easter dinner.

I found this tart way too rich, although visually appealing. The recipe obviously had some errors (filling seeping through the dough, too much asparagus), but the main problem was the fat/grease level. I won't bother making it again, but I'll probably use the asparagus decoration technique with another tart recipe.

This was an excellent dish and was the hit of my meal this past weekend. My mother, bless her heart, was delighted and that is saying a lot!! I rolled the crust a little too thin and the custard seeped through, but it was ok. Please tell us why so much "rolling" was called for?

I also did not need 3 pounds of asparagus, but it was a fantastic dish. Unfortunately, the dog got to the leftovers before I did.

I just finished making this tart for the first time. It is very tas ty..I think next time I might try adding one more egg as the filling did not rise very much. The crust is fine, however I'm not sure what the point of re-rolling the pastry so often..seems to make the proceedure overly long.

Rating: 4
I took this to a party and it was a BIG hit! I used green asparagus, more cheese and less egg/cream mixture as the sides of my tart didn't hold up very well. But I will definately make it again and use the crust for other dishes. One tip: I rolled the dough between sheets of pastic wrap. It helped a lot!

What a sumptious starter for our gourmet club dinner! I agree with white asparagus is relatively woody, but it helps if you peel it deeply. Seems complicated but really is almost idiot-proof.

Very rich tasting - especially the crust. Maybe I didn't make my crust large enough but 3lbs of asparagus was way too much.

This was delicious and elegant. The crust was fantastic -- I'll use it again for quiches and other vegetable tarts. Definitely a keeper.

I've made this recipe twice, both times to rave reviews. I'm new to making pastry, and both times it turned out perfect. This is an easy yet elegant dish that I will definately make again.

This dish was extremely flavorful and the crust blended well with the filling. The white asparagus does seem a bit woody in comparason to the green but it did not take away from th dish at all. I would highly recommend this as a starter or appetizer to take along.
