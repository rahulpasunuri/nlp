Rather ordinary and when I think of the amount of energy it took to run the oven that long in the summertime, I regret the expense of making this cake, that is more like a tart with a soft crust.

I love this cake; I make it regularly every summer (one's in the kitchen right now) since it first appeared on the cover of Gourmet. It's so easy, beautiful, and always a hit. I add the zest of 1/2 lemon to the pastry with the wet ingredients. I use unrefined sugar (such as Sugar in the Raw or Demerara) in both filling and pastry since I find it enhances the flavor. I usually use 5 yellow peaches or nectarines and 2 cups blueberries. For the pastry I grind the sugar in the food processor before adding the rest of the dry ingredients. I instantly recognized the pastry is the same as for traditional Dutch Appeltaart (apple tart), minus the lattice top. For example, the recipe at http://dutchfood.about.com/od/breadspastriescookies/r/ApplePie.htm is similar my Dutch mother-in-law's.

My husband said this is the finest! The long cook time really dries the fruits to produce a concentrated flavor and the crust is delicious. Calling it a cake is a definite misnomer, its more of a tart or Italian crostata.

Sometimes you stumble upon a recipe that makes you say, Wow! This is one of those recipes. It really does a great job highlighting the fruit. And the presentation is sure to please anyone. I would make this again in a heart beat. I followed the recipe pretty closely with only few minor changes. My fresh peaches and blueberries were wonderfully sweet so I decrease the sugar to just shy of a 1/3 c. Also I added couple additional peaches because upon examination of my crust (which only went half way up my springform pan) I felt I was a little light on the amount of fruit. Also I didn't have tapioca so I used 1 heaping T. cornstarch. I also was really worried about what color my springform pan was based on previous reviews. Was it dark grey or light grey, I really couldn't tell? So I opted for the more conservative baking temperature. I baked it at 325 for 1.5 hours, then increased the temperature to 350 for an additional 30 minutes. I can't wait to try this recipe with different combination of fruit!

I've been making this recipe exactly as it is written since it came out. It's absolutely delicious. You do have to be careful about the pan you use. A clear dish works best, but even if it is a little brown, it doesn't take away from the sweetness of the fruit or the nice cakey crust.

This fruit tart receives rave reviews each time I make it. I have made it with fresh and/or frozen peaches and blueberries and it turns out well each time. It is important to keep an eye on the crust, because it can brown quickly at 375. I start baking at 375, turn it down at 1 hour to 350, and finish it at that temperature. I do grind the tapioca, but I think you could do it without grinding, but might need a little more (maybe 1/2 tsp).

Delicious, impressive, and easy--no EASIER-- than pie! I made this after reading a lot of the previous reviews, so I took some advice ahead of time. I too used corn starch instead of tapioca. I also used beautiful farmers market raspberries instead of blueberries--yummy. I must say that the crust was problematic. I baked it according to the recipe (it does need some time to set up), but the edges of the crust were, well, hard! I looked over at a friend as she was eating hers, and she was sort of stabbing at the crust with her fork! Of course, it was her third piece, so I still consider it a success!

I made this with peaches, blackberries, and raspberries, all from the farmer's market. I served it with sweetened whipped cream. Loved the fruit with the whipped cream, but the crust was not great. Since there were mixed reviews on the crust, I decided to follow the recipe the first time. As others have stated, the crust was dark and crispy. If I make it again, I'll lower the oven temp and cook for a shorter time.

THIS IS DELICIOUS. TOOK 2 HOURS TO COOK SO LEAVE EXTRA TIME JUST IN CASE. SLICED THE PEACHES MUCH SMALLER AS I WOULD FOR OTHER FRUIT PIES. WHY IS NAMED A "CAKE"?

Cut fruit thinner than recipe calls for. Did not grind tapioca, it was fine. Based on other reviews I was afraid it would not have enough fruit so I added plums - nice addition. Cooked in dark pan for 90 mins at 350, then 20 mins at 375 to brown it up a bit. Turned out plenty of fruit and soupy but once you let it sit for a few hours its fine. Needs time to "set up". Did not need to peel fruit as long cook time made fruit very tender. Lovely presentation!

This is one of my most favorite desserts. It is especially wonderful during fresh peach season. I send it around to all my friends - who also love it. Covering while baking helps keep it moist. I use frozen berries and do not thaw. And, I use almost double the peaches and berries - yum yum!!

Rating: 4
My family and guests loved this dessert. It was a nice change from crumbles or cobblers, very quick and easy to make and it looked wonderful! I substituted cornstarch for tapioca (as per earlier review), peeled the peaches and cut down on the baking time by fifteen minutes but otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. My husband loved the 'cake' part of it so much, he now wants me to use it with other fruit desserts instead of pastry.

Rating: 0
This is close, but not quite there. The fruit is amazing but the cake is dreadful. In fact, this is not a cake at all... more of a pastry as the directions indicate. The "cake" and fruit don't integrate at all, which was disappointing. 375 is much to hot, even if you use glass or ceramic bakeware. I'm going to find another crumble sort of cake recipe, and use this filling. Oh, and doubling the fruit was barely enough...

Rating: 3
This is so good and easier than you would think, based on the photo. I passed on this recipe when it was initially published because I didn't want to fuss with the pastry/crust/cake. However, patting the crumbs into the pan is easy and quick. I used a 9 inch pan, pushed crumbs about 3/4 of the way up the sides and it worked fine. I used about 6 peaches (mine must have been somewhat small) and berries that I froze earlier in the season - worked fine and filled the cake nicely. I have a light-colored pan and baked the full amount of time and it didn't burn or get overly brown, so don't let the posts about burned crust scare you if you have a light pan. The only change I made was to use cornstarch instead of tapioca, which I didn't have. Next time, I might use just over 1 T as the juices were thickened - almost set - but not quite set. Still, this was great and looks very professional. I'll make this again!

So easy and so good! Made with fresh blueberries and white peaches (which didn't have much flavor), served with vanilla ice cream. Baked in a light colored pan, at 375 for the 1 3/4 hours without a problem -- the oven rack was positioned in the middle of the oven. Will definitely make this again -- it's a keeper.

Wow! This came out very well. It is beautiful and tastes excellent too. I made it just as written since it was my first time making it and it was perfect. Other fruit would work, but the blueberries are especially nice because of their color. It's great that you don't need to peel the peaches; it saves a step. Because it cooks so long, I think, the peeling is unnecessary. This is a great dessert especially if you can't decide whether to make a cake or a pie, because this is somewhat in between the two!

This cake speaks of summer with it's fresh peaches and blueberries combining to make for a light and delicious kind of "comfort" dessert evoking a childhood summer experience. Although I seemingly had enough peaches, the filling seemed to be shy of the volume needed. Since I was serving to friends at their home with no time to spare, I opened a can of pears and added a few of them. In addition, to make for a more festive dessert I added an amaretto flavored whip cream to seerve on the side and brushed some amaretto on the fruit itself after baking. Our friends loved it and even took a photo!

I had reservations about making this after reading all the reviews and comments about the cooking time, etc. I usually just go with a recipe the way it is, and not tinker with it at all. However, since I had a glass bottom, dark springform pan, I baked the cake at 325 for 80 minutes total. I used cornstarch instead of tapioca, increased the peaches to 5, and decreased the sugar a bit. I also increased the egg in the crust to about 11/2 eggs, since ours here are not really "large". What I ended up with was a cake that looks exactly like the photo, with a beautiful golden brown crust, that was not anywhere near tough or crispy. The fruit was perfectly cooked, and juicy. I made this for family, and they raved about it! This will be a recipe that I add to my dessert collection. Wonderful!

I read all the reviews before making this cake and did bake the cake at 325 degrees for the first hour, because I was using a dark, 8-inch springform pan. I then increased the oven temp to 350 degrees and let it bake for another 35 minutes and it turned out great. I substituted 1 tablespoon of cornstarch for the tapioca and used almond extract instead of vanilla in the pastry, which gave it subtle flavor. I also mixed a little bit of whole wheat flour with the all-purpose flour. I decreased the sugar in the filling by two tablespoons. The key is to really let it set and cool down in the pan for 30 minutes before removing the springform. My husband loves it and wants to know when I'm making it again.

I have been making this wonderful cake for 2 years now. Everyone loves it! It's an easy crust, the texture and taste compliment the fruit. I have used a dark pan lowering the temperature to 325 degrees for 75 minutes, then 350 for the last 30 minutes. I cut out the tapioca step, used minute tapioca and just mixed in with the fruit. Yes, make sure to let the cake cool - it sets up beautifully!!! As a matter of fact, I just made one and the aroma is to die for!

I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out perfect. There is no need to change the cooking temp. The crust was actually the best part. However, I did use the light colored pan as the editors recommended. My husband thought that it was a great dessert but I did find it to be somewhat sweet. If I were to make it again I would use different fruit - something tart, perhaps apricots and sweet cherries.

Rating: 3
Terrific! Thanks for all the tips, Epicurious reviewers. I never made a better summer fruit cake. Used almost 2 pts. blueberries and 4 peaches, and cornstarch equal to the tapioca. I baked it in a preheated 350 oven for 1 and 1/2 hr. and the pastry dough was perfect. A reminder not to over-process the dough which might be a reason for some people's tough pastry. I am looking forward to trying other fruits. This was a really fresh, bright, and clean treat.

I did not grind the tapioca but otherwise followed the recipe. I made the pastry and lined the pan and left it in the fridge overnight. I used a light-colored pan, but my crust at 375 for 1 3/4 hours was a little darker than I would've liked. I could not see how it was coming along because it did not reach the top of the pan and the fruit juices had bubbled over. As other reviewers mentioned, the consistency was perfect after letting the cake cool. I would make this again, in fact, I have a lot of leftover peaches so maybe tomorrow...

Excellent, excellent recipe. Everyone raved the look and the taste of this cake. I've added lemon zest and reduced the temperature: 1 hours for 330 and 45 mim for 350. I also low-broiled to make the top even more golden. Didn't work out with frozen fruit for me since it got too watery. I also substituted plums for blueberry and it turned out good, too. I sliced the peaches thinner than recipie called for.

I adored this cake and so did everyone I served it to. They ALL said it was the best dessert they'd ever had (!) It truly lets the fruit flavors shine with just the perfect amount of buttery delicious cake. Beccause of the disclaimer, and since my springform is dark brown, I cooked at 250 for about 2.25 hours. It was perfect, not the least bit burned. I will make this frequently and try lots of different fruits.

Made this dessert twice. I did not peel the peachs; I baked it at 325 for required time and it came out great; For the crust I used a large bowl and my hand mixer to mix the crust together and pressed the crust 3/4 of the way up the side of the pan; I did not grind the tapioca with sugar; just mixed it together and added fruits. With these changes the dessert came out beautifully. Nice end of summer dessert.

this was great! threw it together at the last minute for a dinner party when i realized i didn't have a couple ingredients i needed for the dessert i'd planned to make. had white peaches on hand and no blueberries, so it was quite sweet but still very good, everyone raved. next time i'll look for yellow peaches or nectarines and definitely add some berries for tartness to balance the sugar. so easy and really lovely presentation :-)

This was a huge hit, and couldn't be easier to make. I'm going to try this with nectarines next - it also would be great with plums. Make sure you allow enough time for the cake to cool before serving. It's runny when it's warm, but firms up beautifully. Note: I couldn't find my springform pan, so I lined an 8" cake round with Release Wrap, and pulled the cake out when it was cool, which worked perfectly.

Very yummy with fresh fruit in season! I substituted cornstarch for the tapioca and added some freshly grated nutmeg. It did take the full amount of time to cook, and even then the center still looked liquidy. Don't worry! I used the liquid from the center to brush the top of the cake to make it shiny and pretty. If you are patient and wait for the cake to cool completely, it really does set up, making it easy to cut and serve. I served mascarpone whipped cream on the side. It was terrific!

I have almost never given a dish 4 forks but I would give this one 31/2 if I could. Quick and easy to make and delicious! Loved the texture of the crust. Added more blueberries and subbed an equal amount of cornstarch. Also lowered the sugar in the fruit slightly as suggested by another reviewer. Since peach and blueberry season have ended, I'm going to try using Italian plums next time-I'm sure they will also be great.

Three-and-a-half forks, please. This was amazingly easy. I thought there was no way that a shapeless glob of dough with piles of rough-hewn fruit thrown on top would come out so tasty and good looking. I don't have a blade coffee grinder or spice mill, so I put the tapioca granules in as-is, and had no trouble, so I wonder if the pulverization is necessary. I hope I can squeeze in another one before the season's over.

This is execellent, easy, quick to make and looks fantastic! I often find fruit recipes contain way too much sugar for my liking. I cut the sugar in the fruit to less than 1/2. The crust is excellent. Used cornstarch in place of tapioca. No problems cookings. I set timer for 1 hour and then watched it carefully, total cook time 1 hour 15 mins. Everyone loved it!

Excellent recipe! In fact, I have already made it twice. However, care must be taken not to burn the crust. The first time I made this cake, I baked it at 375 degree for 1 hr and 30 min only, 15 mins less than specified, and it turned out perfect. The second time I baked it for the full time specified and the crust burned. (And, no, I did not use a dark baking pan.) Next time I will either cook it at the specified temp for 1 hr and 30 min OR will cook it for the full time specified but at 350 degrees.

I followed this recipe word for word and used a light colored springform pan and the dessert turned out perfectly.

This dessert was soooo good. I had two problems: my cake/biscuit/crust burned and the fruit burst at the temp recommended, and at much less time than the recipe said.

Quick Question: Do you peel the peaches?

Rating: 3
Made the cake for the first time last night and concur that the recipe must contain a typo. 375 for an hour and a half is not a "slow" oven. Mine was done in about 55 minutes so I pulled it then. Even then, it was ever so slightly overcooked. I will make it again but next time try 325 and see what happens. I used an espresso tamper to press the dough - it makes for a more even crust. Using a 9 1/2" springform, I went about 3/4 of the way up and didn't think it left enough for a good bottom so will more than likely increase the dough by about a fourth. Other than that, the flavors were wonderful - especially with some Haagen Dazs vanilla.....

Rating: 4
Delicious. Made one substituting ground almonds for 1/2 cup of the flour in the crust, then made individual cakes in small baking dishes using the flour crust. The small ones took as long to bake as the springform. Maybe the crust was thicker.

Although this "Cake's" taste was really good & was way easy to make, it needs more peaches, at least one (I would think). It also needs more tapioca, maybe another tablespoon (I'm gonna try increasing the amount the next time I make it), because it was too soupy and it kind-a sank when cut.

What a wonderful cake!! I think the problem people are having is that they are using a dark springform pan. I have a dark pan with a glass bottom and even though I took my cake out early...15 min early. My crust was too brown. If you have a dark pan decrease the oven temperature. If you have a standard pan, light coloured aluminum proceed as usual. But if you're not sure just take a peek after an hour to see how it's doing! I'll be making this again but using a different pan. Be sure to put the crust only as high as your fruit or you'll have a crown effect as some others have noted. It is a good recipe...I think Gourment should have noted what kind of pan to use, not just the size.

i've already made this cake twice. the first time, i THOUGHT i was following the recipe exactly but after 1.75 hrs my crust was rather scorched. then i re-read the recipe and noticed that my springform pan is 10" rather than 8" and has a dark teflon coating. next time i will use a smaller, shiny pan. i would also consider using potato starch instead of the ground tapioca or cornstarch. i tried cornstarch and it turned a little foggy. then i tried the tapioca but without a grinder and it was a littly pebble-y. otherwise this cake is nearly foolproof, very flavorful and quite attractive.

Crust was a bit tough and grainy. It might rate a 3 fork if 1/3 of flour was replaced with almond meal. This would make a more tender crust. (I wonder if a bit of buttermilk would help tenderness.) Also, add a bit of almond extract. At that, I'd like 25% more of a crust. I used some good blueberries and some so-so peaches. The fruit flavor just wasn't intense enough.

Rating: 3
A delicious, beautiful dessert and fantastic alternative to a tart or cobbler. I usually enjoy more crust, but the texture and flavor made up for that. The baking directions worked for me; my only change was the 1.5TB cornstarch for the tapioca. I also put my crust too far up the side, will judge it better next time, and there will be many next times!

Rating: 3
Fabulous! And really quite easy--no need to peel the peaches (although some of mine were so ripe that I just pulled the skin off after I sliced them). My husband doesn't like blueberries, so I made it with all peaches. I added 1/4 tsp almond extract for a subtle almond flavor. The amount of cake dough seemed a bit skimpy when I was pressing it into the pan, but it expanded nicely to surround the fruit filling. Baked as directed for about 1 hr 35 minutes, then uncovered and baked for another 15-20 minutes to brown top and set filling. The fruit was still a little liquidy when I took it out of the oven, but solidified as it cooled; it was not at all drippy when I sliced it. Peach flavor was fantastic!

Beautiful, delicious and everyone raved about it. After reading the reviews can't help but think people need to test their oven temps. I halved the recipe and used a 9" tart pan. Cooked it for 45 min. and it was fabulous. I would add some mace and almonds next time.

YUM! This was just fantastic!! My food processor bit the dust, so I made this in the Kitchenaid stand mixer. Short of the chopping the peaches, I found this very easy to make and came out quite good! I followed the directions for the baking time to a "t" and it was perfect! WIll repeat!!

A delightful summertime treat! Everybody who tasted it loved it. However, one egg was not enough moisture to hold together the flour/butter mixture, so I added a bit of cold water. Also, 1 hour would be enough baking time. After 1-3/4 hours, the cake part was overbaked, with the crust brown and hard.

This was easy to make with a delicious result. My guests gobbled it down. Reminded us of the version Ebinger's used to sell in Brooklyn a long time ago.

The cake looks beautiful and the filling is delicious. However, the cake was overdone. The cooking time and temperature are way off. Luckily, I was suspicious of the time and temperature and watched it closely after one hour. I'd turn it down to 350 degrees and watch it carefully starting at one hour. Don't wait for the filling to bubble in the middle, take it out when the cake looks done.

This is wonderful- i substituted plums for peaches it was great, and so pretty. Follow the receipe exactly.

I followed the recipe cooking time and it came out perfectly. I did not peel the peaches and it was fine, the skin added color. One direction did throw me. I pushed the crust all the way up the side of the spring form pan (as it said to do). So when the cake was done, the crust was quite a bit higher than the fruit. It still turned out OK, as it didn't burn, and it ended up looking like a crown! Next time I'll push the crust up only as far as the fruit is, about 1/2 way up the side.

Followed the recipe exactly but was a bit dissappointed to find the crust charred (I wonder if convection baking may be responsible). Aside from that it's an extremely beautiful and delicious cake. Will lower the temperature slightly and watch it closely the last 20 minutes next time and just keep trying until I perfect it.

I was very pleased with this cake. Of course after having read the reviews, I was suspicious of the cooking time, but I followed the recipe as written and it turned out great. I would just suggest monitoring it during the last 15 minutes or so-- remember the recipe says "until filling is bubbling in center and crust is golden." I took it out when the filling was bubbling (at nearly the full 1 3/4 hours) and it was perfectly done. Tastes great with the creme fraiche ice cream also on this site.

Must agree with MANY of the reviews. Seems to me that this recipe was never tested as it probably would have only made it into "killed food review". The topping was very good.....so I scrapped it off the cake and had it over my homemade peach ice cream.

Only change I made to the recipe was to substitute 1 heaping T cornstarch for tapioca. Came out beautifully with cake falling somewhere in between a biscuit and pound cake. Followed cooking time and temperature exactly using 9" springform pan and it was perfect.

Made this cake as directed down to every last detail. Questioned the temperature and the cooking time but followed the directions with confidence in a Gourmet Magazine recipe. Wish I read the reviews. The temperature in this recipe, and the cooking time must be a mistake. All that hard work for a over cooked charred, blackened dessert that the chickens wouldn't even eat. I was very disappointed with this Gourmet Magazine recipe.

This was OK, I was a little disappointed because of all the great reviews. i floowed the recipe except baked at 350 for 80 minutes. I served at room temperature and the filling was very runny.

hmmmm, not sure why I put my oven on for 2 hours in this heat ... but I did. This cake looked very nice, but I wasn't overly impressed by the taste. The pastry is just too dry, I noticed everyone left the end on their plate and no one asked for seconds. Oh well.

Rating: 4
Excellent taste. I used 2 T cornstarch & 2 T flour for thickening agent. I baked in convection oven at 300-325 degrees for approx. 1 hour. I also used an 8 in. springform pan and formed the dough only half way up the pan. (which makes the dough amount sufficient. If I used a larger pan, I would double the dough) The one thing I tried different from any of the other 50 reviews. (all of which were helpful) I mixed the dough in my KichenAid mixer with the paddle attachment, it worked just fine. I used peaches, blueberries and raspberries. Wonderful brunch item!

This cake is unbelievably delicious. I too got worried about the temperature and cooked it at 350°, but it took longer than the time indicated in the recipe. Next time, I will cook it at 375° as recommended. We are lucky to have such beautiful peaches in BC, and this cake brings out both their flavor and that of the blueberries. I found a trick to easily flatten the dough in the cake pan: I use the bottom of a small metal measuring cup which I dip in a little flour. The dough stays cooler than if I did it with my fingers, and it is easier to achieve an even thickness.

My guests and I thoroughly enjoyed this cake. I followed the directions (baking time and temp.) exactly. The bottom of the crust was rather soft and cake-like while the sides were crisper, like a sweet tarte pastry. The filling was luscious.

Wonderful dessert! Light and rich, all in a bite -- perfect way to use summer's bounty. I did bake it at 325, and it took almost 2 hours, but who cares when it's this yummy! I was a little concerned that the crust would be tough, because it took a lot of manipulating to stretch it up to the top of the springform pan, but it turned out fine. I will definitely make this again!

Rating: 4
What a confusing bunch of reviews! My mistake for listening! I tried the 325 temp because I didn't want it to burn! Took me over 3 hours! I have rarely been steered wrong by Epicurious recipes; should have known better. Next time will stick to their instructions. After all, it is fruit pie-like, or torte like except the crust is not the same and somewhat thicker and a fruit pie can take an hour so of course the 375 is not an error! My husband says it is the best he has ever eaten; but then he says that a lot about any fruit dessert.

Big success, everybody wanted seconds. Followed all instructions exactly except baking time. Went with 1 hour at 325, then 50 minutes at 350. Turned out perfect.

This was easy and pretty but needed more crust and sugar.The peaches could also be cut thinner.I will probably try it again with adjustments.In the south we like our desserts like we like our iced tea-sweet!

Baked as directed and turned out perfectly. Agree with needing to let it sit to set up completely. Has anyone tried this with different fruit? Wonder how it might work with apples or pears.

This is simply wonderful. We loved it and will make it again and again. The recipe didn't mention peeling the peaches - I did. I can't really imagine it with the peach skin on. The next time I make it, I'm going to add a little almond extract to the pastry and sprinkle slivered almonds on the top.

I made this in lieu of a tried and true peach torte and now I have two favorite recipes (and so does my family). I followed the baking directions and my cake, too, came out a bit dark but not burnt. I would cut out a couple of minutes next time. For the cook who thought the cake was runny, I found that it needs to cool completely to set the filling. I put in the refrigerator overnight and brought it to room temp before serving. Wonderful use for summer fruits.

Simple, very good. Used full pt berries, forgot lemon juice, added 1t Penzeys baking spice (a wonderful blend). Crust was overdone so will shorten time. Does need to nearly fully cool to set up.

Wow! This cake was delicious. It was moist and full of summer flavor. I didn't have four peaches so I added another 1/2 pint of blueberries. I also didn't have tapioca so I used 1-1/2 tablespoons of corn starch! It was beautiful to boot. Would definitely make again.

I loved this recipe but it came out slightly burnt. I used a rather dark spring form pan. Will knock off a few mins. from the cooking time next time.

Made it just the way it was written. No problems with the cooking time or temp - my spring-form is light colored, though, so I don't know if that made a difference. All I know is that there were no leftovers! And 2nds were being looked for. Make it again? You betcha!

I would make this again, added a few dashes of cinnamon and about a tablespoon of peach brandy to the filling, but I would double the crust recipe next time. It was a bit dry and I used Plugra unsalted butter, which should have helped. The overall flavor was very good.

My guests loved this cake, it was very adult (i.e., not too sweet), and quite pretty. The perfect summer dessert. I cooked it for about 1 hr 40 minutes at 375, it definitely would have burned if I left it in longer. It was difficult to get the cake out of the bottom of the spring form pan, next time I am going to try using wax or parchment paper.

This is fabulous. Especially now that the Georgia peaches are at their peak, it is absolutely luscious, and beautiful too. I made it exactly as shown and would make it again even though it's a lot of time from beginning to eating..!

After reading the reviews, I had high expectations. It was a big disappointment - the first recipe I've tried from this site that I wasn't satisfied with. It did look pretty; but, the filling was too runny with minimal flavor and the crust was nearly overdone, too crumbly & bland. I'll use one of my tried & true recipes next time.

Fantastic recipe! Here's how mine came out: http://dataspaces.dreamhost.com/pbcake.jpg (please note I used a 7.25" springform pan instead of the recommended 9-9.5"). Took the tips from other reviewers and started baking at 325 then switched it up midway to 350. Came out perfect. Got rave reviews at the party.

I loved this recipe. But next time I would lower the temp to 350 and take it out 10-15 sooner. The crust was overdone. It was also great the next day for breakfast.

Delicious, and easy! Smelled so good baking. I used cornstarch instead of tapioca, and I added a bit of ground ginger to the fruit mixture. I baked at 325 for about 1.5 hours, and I forgot the foil until about halfway through the baking, and it was still just fine! I'm going to try this with fall fruits, too, as other reviewers have mentioned - I bet Italian plums will be fabulous!

We enjoyed it and it was easy. A little whipped cream made it better. However, could not understand the cooking time. Ours was perfectly done in about 50 minutes. Maybe at 325 it might take as long as suggested.

This recipe performs every time. It is easy to put together and fabulous to serve. It has the best aroma as it is baking. The second time I made it I cut the sugar down from 1/2 to 1/3rd of a cup and everyone still raved about it.

Quite yummy. Just cleaned up after having a couple for dinner and there is none left (darn- would've been good for breakfast..) I baked at 350 for almost the full time listed. Very easy to make, and pastry dough quite easy to handle. I also skipped the magazine silliness of grinding tapioca. In other situations I've used quick cooking tapioca (it is already coursely ground) and today I just used cornstarch. I've got a ton of blueberries in the fridge so I'll probably make this again real soon! Next time I might add some ginger or almonds to zing it up a bit- but really good and easy. Pretty too.

Rating: 4
I made minor changes due to my own dietary restrictions. I substituted splenda for 1/2 the sugar in the crust and used only splenda in the filling. (Splenda tends to change the texture of drier baked products such as crust, cookies, if used alone but works very well in moister filling on pies etc.) It came out phenominally well. everybody loved it and no one noticed my substitutions. the cooking time worked fine for me, but my oven temp is well calibrated. I will make it again!!!

Wonderful flavor and attractive too. The time and temperature were a problem here in Denver, altitude perhaps. I removed it from the oven a half hour before the recommended time and the crust was quite hard and somewhat overdone. I will lower the temp. to 350 and change the cooking time to 1 and 1/4 hours next time.

Delicious - like a pie with a hard on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside crust. Wouldn't change a thing!

I had no problem with the time or the temperature. The tin foil on the top seemed to do the trick. I used ripe pears instead of peaches and it was delicious. I also used lemon extract instead of vanilla and garnished with candied lemon peel. Beautiful, easy, great for summer.

Couldn't wait to make this recipe after receiving my August Gourmet. Made it Saturday for a barbecue. My guests couldn't get enough of it, and there were plenty of other desserts around. I made it following the recipe exactly, including baking at 375 degrees, and it came out perfect. Can't wait to try it with nectarines and raspberries.

This "cake" was delicious, though as others have pointed out, not truly a cake, but you can tell that from the picture! I baked at 350 degrees for two hours because I was worried about some of the prior comments and it came out perfectly. However, I was using someone else's kitchen and they did not have a grinder, so I just mixed the tapioca in - I didn't taste the granules but the mix was a little soppier/wetter in the middle than I anticipated... I should have let it cool fully to room temperature.

No need to grind the tapioca...Bascoms makes granulated tapioca. I will try this recipe with Italian prunes/plums when they are in season in the Fall.

A simple crowd pleaser...The cooking time was long (about 1 3/4 hours at 325 degrees) but the prep time was nothing. I'm glad I read the reviews before I made the recipe because the temperature seemed to be a misprint. If anyone has difficulty finding the instant tapioca then I would suggest substituting about 1 1/2 teaspoons of cornstarch. Whisk it into the flour and sugar before it coats the fruit to avoid lumps. Overall, the cake was delicious (although it reminded me more of a tart or pie).

Rating: 3
The 375 degree F temperature was right, though because I used a 10 inch pan, the cake was clearly done a half an hour earlier that recommended. I used plums instead of peaches and a handful of cherries in addition to the blueberries. The long cooking time resulting in the plums tasting like they had been cooked into sweet wine and it was absolutely delicious. I do suggest serving the cake with something to cut the sweetness - yogurt or sour cream or unsweetened whipped cream.

Very delicious for a summer evening!!!! I changed the temp. based on previous reviews, and cooked at 325 for 1 hour and 350 for 40 minutes and it came out perfect! I didn't mind the extra step grinding the quick cooking tapioca, flour, and sugar...not a hard thing to do for great consistency.

I made this for a luncheon party yesterday - I followed the recipe to the T - and it was perfect - I did add additional fruit - only because I had extra bluberries - the cooking time was fine for my oven - I agree with the reviewer about pressing the pastry all the way - I will stop a bit lower next time, as I found it a bit thin and had too much over the top in the end - but my guests thought it was wonderful - I served with ice cream (I served it only 3 hours out of the oven and the texture was lovely)I did grind the tapioca, but it really didn't seem to make much difference from other times I've used tapico.........

I checked the reviews before getting started and baked the cake at 325. It looked so wonderful I couldn't believe I had baked it. I'm not much of a baker so believe me if I can make this, anyone can. The filling was a little liquidy, but it was delicious.

Contrary to all previous reviewers, I had no problem at all with the oven temperature or the length of time. I baked at 375 for 1 hour 45 minutes (last 10 minutes with foil off) and it came out perfectly--just like the picture. I tested my oven temp recently, so know its accurate. Don't know why it worked for me and not others. As they say, your mileage may vary. Also, while filling was juicy, it didn't need any additional thickening. I thought this was tasty, but not sublime enough for 4 forks. Only changes I would make next time: I would not press the dough all the way up the sides. I woud stop 3/4 of the way up. And I will not bother with that silly grinding of the tapioca, flour and sugar. I use tapioca to thicken all my fruit pies and never grind it. Tried it this time to see if it made a huge difference, and don't think it does. Looking forward to having leftovers for breakfast this morning!

I believe this recipe should be baked at 325 degrees and not as long as suggested. I started it at 375 and quickly decreased it having read other reviews. Inspite of that, the bottom of the cake browned. I also decreased the time baked until 1 hour and 35 minutes but would strongly advise to check it as it is baking. This too, was far too long.

Rating: 3
Had to try this recipe the moment I saw it on the cover of the August issue. I immediately questioned the oven temp., but since reviews were not yet posted, I dove in at 375. Luckily, 15 minutes into baking, my oven began smoking from a prior spill, forcing me to switch to another non-preheated oven. I thought my cake was destined for the trash, but it actually baked to perfection in a total of 1-1/4 hrs. Refrigerated leftovers (tho there wasn't much) tasted great too. I just couldn't award 4 forks because the temperature in the recipe is obviously an error.

Rating: 3
The temperature is probably a typo. It worked out beautifully at 325 degrees instead of 375. The clue is in the description: bakes long and slow - and 375 isn't slow! My cake yesterday took 1 hour and 35 minutes to be bubbling in the center and golden brown on the edges, as the description said. It looked beautiful and tasted great!

I also thought that the cooking time was too long at 375 degrees. I also found that when we cut into the cake there was too much liquid. Next time I try it, I might try to add some arrowroot so that I don't have the same problem.

I agree with the first reviewer. 1 3/4 hours at 375? I baked mine for 1 hour then checked it and thought it close to done. Then forgot about it...in total it baked for 1 1/2 hours. The crust was charred. We salvaged some of the fruit and ate it with cream. Will try this again, but will obviously watch the cooking time.

There is something off about either the length of baking or the temperature in this recipe. I didn't bake it for the full 1 3/4 hours and it was still really overdone. Otherwise, it was delicious. Next time I'd bake at a lower temperature for less time.
