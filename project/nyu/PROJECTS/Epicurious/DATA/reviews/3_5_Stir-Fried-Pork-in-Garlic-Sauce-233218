I made the regular version. Even with adding extra oil, sauce quantity from this recipe, IMHO, is way too low. Over rice, this turns out to be a pretty dry dish. The flavor is decent but really not any more complicated than the recipe is. I will say that it is very fast and easy to make. I have had this in restaurants and it seems like this recipe is missing more than a few ingredients. Also, the flavor of the soy sauce (which is really the only flavor there is) is right on the surface of the pork so the dish has no depth. A marinade would probably help. While there were no complaints from my diners, I will look elsewhere next time for more inspired preparations.

delicious. i made it as written with one small addition and loved how light but full of flavor this dish is. i made the thai version with fish sauce but also added a tablespoon of soy sauce. i will definitely make this again.

very good as it is written. there are only a few flavors but they are very well paired.

This is a good, simple stir-fry. I substituted peanut sauce for the soy sauce and served it over thai noodles instead of white rice. It was a hit at my dinner party.

Quite boring this one. I'd suggest adding hoisin sauce and perhaps some chopped ginger or a pinch of five-spice mixture.
