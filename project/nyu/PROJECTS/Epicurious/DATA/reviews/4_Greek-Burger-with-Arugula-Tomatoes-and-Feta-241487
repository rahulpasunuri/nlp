I made an amazing Greek Burger over the weekend!http://imunchie.com/liorhartenstein/munchies/greek-burger-plate I think a great side dish to this is hummus. My dad makes an amazing Greek burger

This recipe is fantastic! The burgers were so flavorful and moist, and the dressing was delicious! My market didn't have ground lamb, so I used ground beef instead. That worked out fine, but I'm excited to try it with the lamb next time.

I have always loved food but been a timid cook so making these were a step for me. It was wonderful. I think i needed to dice my onions more, but adding a splash of milk rather than soaking the bread worked great. These were moist and wonderfully flavorful.

This was really good. I made it with ground beef instead of lamb, and I bet it would be awesome with lamb, but the beef worked just fine (85% fat level grass fed beef). It isn't a lot a lot of meat, but the pita mixture bulks it up just fine and really makes it moist and delicious. The sauce is awesome, too. Better to serve this as pictured, as an open-face sandwich--the pita didn't really work as a pocket, and it was sort of a mess that required a knife and fork. But so what? Winner. About half an hour, start to plate.

Very tasty. Soaking the pita scraps made the mixture a bit too wet. Next time I'll omit that step--there should be plenty of moisture from the onion, garlic and lemon juice to make a nice puree. The family pounced on the extra lamb patty when one young guest announced her "conscientious objector" status. A nice summer menu for us. We'll make it again.

Thought this was absolutely delicious! If you squeeze the milk out of the pitas, the mixture is just wet enough to be moist and yet still stay together. I mixed and shaped the burgers, then refrigerated them for about an hour before cooking on a non-stick grill pan on the stove top, about 5 minutes per side since my burgers were bigger. I also used regular Greek yogurt for the sauce which was very good. Overall a winner and easy.

Looking for a healthy alternative to your usual beef burger....this is it! I grilled the burger, used 1 pound for 5 of us and did not increase anything else. I mashed my burger and put it in the pita. Excellent! My new favorite.

I actually substituted lamb for beef as this is what we had in the fridge. After blending, it was all mushy and wouldn't stick together let alone harden like mince normally does when cooked for a while. As I'm new to epicurious, I hadnt read all the reviews. Made the same mistake of not squeezing the milk out. Flavours were there, but def not the texture. Will try again with lamb and minus so much milk!! I agree with the suggestion of not blending.

The flavors of this recipe were spot on. The only reason I did not give it 4 forks is that the patties as written are really too wet. I rescued the situation by chilling in the fridge for about 20 min, but next time I will either cut back on the milk or add more bread.

Nice and easy, quick to prepare. These were a nice alternative to beef burgers, and had a nice flavor. Depending on your audience, consider making more of the dressing! It's yummy.

Very good! I used flatbread insted of pita and it turned out just fine. Didn't have a problem keeping the patty together. Will definitely make again!

Wish I had grilled them--the burgers fell apart in the skillet and I had to finish them in the oven.

Easy to make and tasty to eat, so a rewarding cookery experience. I will definitely be making again, although I don't think the flavors meld together quite so perfectly. The burger could use a bit more punch and the sauce, while nice enough, tastes a bit more like the odd sum of its parts (honey layering Dijon layering yogurt) than authentic Greek sauce.

We've had these at a local restaurant and wanted to try them. Very easy to make; although I would have used about half the bread. It overpowered the lamb. We also used fresh baby spinach instead of arugula. The cucumber sauce was excellent. We will definitely make these again.

Made this last week very delicious. Very moist. Followed recipe for burgers. Only tip I have is with yogurt sauce, I'd recomment chopping cucumbers and salting them a day ahead and then draining out all of the excess water - I felt that this left the yogurt dressing very tasty, like tatziki.

I cooked these for a group of friends and they were a real hit. I accidentally served it to a friend with a gluten allergy, though - don't forget there is bread in the patties! The burgers are easy to prepare beforehand, which just leaves the sauce to whip up before guests arrive. A tasty recipe that I will definitely use again.

Great recipe. I'm used to traditional Greek food, and so I would rather make a more traditional tzitziki sauce than the one here. However it's very similar to Greek beeftekia and I really like how moist it is.

My husband and I truly disliked this recipe. The dressing was sour and the burgers lacked flavor.

Great recipe and terrific Greek flavors. Made this last night for my family and they loved it. Only mistake was I bought Pita flatbread instead of Pita pockets so I improvised. Put the warm flatbread on the plate, then the dressing, the arugula, tomatoes then the burger and topped it with feta. Required a knife and fork but my wife and son said they preferred it this way (how would they know?). One problem I had was that the burgers seemed way too moist and barely held together in the pan. Anyone else have this problem? I followed the recipe to a T.

This is one of those times that I wish I had an extensive vocabulary to truly do this recipe justice. It is mouth wateringly delicious and memories of it will leave you longing for it again!!!

Excellent! I made the mix and formed the burgers one-day in advance and left in the refrigerator. I do this for most all my homemade burgers now as I believe it enhances the flavor. Do not try to blend - it does not work. Use food processor or just mix by hand. I did not use pita - used rye bread since all I had. Very moist result - even after grilling for 12 minutes.

My husband said he could eat this every night. Mixed a little bit of feta in with the meat mixture. Also, added sliced avocado to the sandwich. Delicious!

Used 1 piece of whole wheat bread instead of pita and served the burgers with a hearty spoon of yogurt sauce, and tomato/feta salad. Yum. Husband contributed home-made fries...terrific combo. Will make again.

i hope this really is as lower-calas it says, b/c it will be a regular. lamb was supermoist and the dressing is fairly all-purpose. the arugula serves a purpose with a nice sharp spiciness to cut through all the richness.

Yum. Followed recipe. How can you fail when such delicious ingredients like feta and mint are concerned?

Made this last night and it was really quick, easy, and healthy! Served it with oven roasted fries and dijon aioli! very tasty :)

This recipe was delicious. Very easy, we'll definitely be making this again in the summer-time for guests!

Fabulous exactly as written! I added a bit more mint because we like it. The soaked pita adds a wonderfully light consistency. The reader who called it "mushy" might not have squeezed the moisture out as directed. Will make this again and again.

This was a great, flavorful recipe. I used white pitas and used half of the amount of pita soaked in milk and they came out the perfect consistency. I also used lemon, garlic and oregano flavored feta which added even more flavor. I will surely make these burgers again and again.

This is a good recipe - easy, quick, and tasty. Next time I won't use whole wheat pitas - they fall apart too easily. The dressing was great and would go well on many other foods. Thanks

Yuck, yuck, and yuck, spit, yuck. Great idea, good ingredients. SKIP the pita soaked in milk. Made for a MUSHY, nasty concoction resembling wet dog food. I will try it again, WITHOUT the wet pita bread. The onion should help keep it moist enough. Gross - just couldn't eat it.

This is really good!!! I made the burgers on a George Foreman grill, and they came out brilliantly! Will definitely make this again and again.
