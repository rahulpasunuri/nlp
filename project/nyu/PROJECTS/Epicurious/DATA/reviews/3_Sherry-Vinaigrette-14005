Light and wonderful - a good all-purpose vinaigrette. Tried it b/c I had a big bottle of sherry vinegar and nothing to do with it!!!

Sherry vinegar is wonderful but it's overshadowed by all the mustard. Ingredients are great but oil needs to be increased and I don't know the purpose of the water. I guess I was looking for something different. The old 1-3 works well here with vinegar at one part and oil to three. Water dilutes and okay if on diets but I would scale back the mustard. Definitely in need of salt and pepper as well.
