As I am reading this I am laughing. I have been there with most of the reviews. Fingers piled high with coconut chocolate mixture, yummy! Vowed after first time would not do again, but family members requested it. Tried again with same ugly looking bars. Vowed again ,that I was done. Last Christmas I did not make them and there was some disappointment so I told my son in law he could try, so far he has made no attempt but most likely I will with some of the tips from some of the other reviewers. Cannot express how messy but yummy these are.

I read the reviews, and this American who misses Almond Joys and is living in France where there are NONE, will be making them as soon as I find all the ingredients in this crazy country...stay tuned!!

Are you kidding?! An Almond Joy is about $.50...there is no way to do this 'cleanly'. Huge mess trying to dip into chocolate. Thought it would be a good idea to place on a coolong rack...but they stuck and the chocolate broke off. The almonds came off while dipping and the coconut cracked. It was nearly impossible to get a clean looking piece without too much chocolate sticking to it after dipping and spreading to cover. Used about 2x the stated chocolate amount. Overall taste is OK, almonds are great when they are toasted, but the coconut lost some of it's flavor with the sweetened milk and sugar...maybe too sweet. Let's let Mars Candy do what they do better than we can...they have the right equipment also! Not worth another try.

I didn't have the issue of the coconut mixture crumbling like other reviewers. First of all, I made sure that when I stirred in the coconut, it was very well incorporated so that it almost looked like a little ball of dough when I was done. Then, I free-formed the coconut mixture into a square shape on top of the foil, instead of putting it in a 9 x 13 pan; making sure it was pressed together firmly before refrigerating. Finally, when I dipped the coconut bars into the chocolate, I did the top and bottoms separately, refrigerating in between, and used the back of a spoon to coat the sides. I also used the spoon to gently smooth off excess chocolate, instead of waiting for it to drip off. All in all, they look pretty good and taste wonderful also!

Made these last year for the first time and vowed never again. But then as time went on and I recall how delicious this recipe was I made them again and infact just finished scraping off the chocolate, coconut mixture from my fingers. The build up was huge. Was hoping to find some ideas on how the dipping procedure can be made easier and make the presentation more appealing. I even tried rolling it in a ball. (Don't bother trying)

Another thought ... and what I will try the next time ... chocolate molds. I would imagine that if you painted the bottom of the molds with the melted chocolate, froze it for a few minutes and then put the coconut mixture and almonds in and topped it with more chocolate, it would be much easier, less messy and a much nicer presentation!

Very rich and tasty! Easy to make, but difficult to dip. My 10 year old daughter found the trick for us, though! At her suggestion, we melted the candy melts in a disposable pastry bag in the microwave and cut a small portion of the tip off. It made it much less messy and a prettier presentation. To get the sides easily, we used a silicone pastry brush.

Sorry guys, this recipe attracted me by the photo since I was always an almond joy lover but since I lost three friends to cancer, all at a young age, I just couldn't bring myself to use this much sugar! Let's start creating recipes that doesn't do what the name of the recipe calls for, "killer"!

My Aunt and I have been making them for years. The recipe we have a slightly different, however you should get them Cold. Freezing them always made them way more crumbly, a little more sweet condensent milk helps. Easiest way I found for applying Chocolate is to take your tonges and only dip the bottoms, put them on teh wax paper and then spoon over the Chocolate, works great, also adding a little parafin waz helps the chocolate stay hard. Good luck next time, love this recipe.

All I can say is what a mess albeit a delicious one. I had the same experience with the coconut mixture falling apart. The instructions to just "dip" it in the chocolate is easier said and done. I tried all sorts of instruments from prongs, to fork, to spatula. This is a yummy recipe but executing it is another story (at least for me!). I'd love to know what utensils people used to accomplish this successfully. Needless to say mine did not look like the photograph. I would make again but with more directions. Also, maybe freezing the coconut mixture would have helped things stay together.

The coconut filling was easy to make. Assembling the candies, on the other hand, not so easy. When I tried to dip the bars into the chocolate, they kept coming apart--would reccomend pouring the chocolate on top. If need be, thin the chocolate out for easier pouring--heck, use ganache if necessary. Makes for a delectable combination.
