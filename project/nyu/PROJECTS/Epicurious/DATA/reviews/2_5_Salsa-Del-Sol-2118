This is one of my go to recipes year after year. Make sure you use fresh basil, try to find in season tomatoes and use some good sea salt. I disagree that it is boring. I think it is very flavorful and a wonderful accompaniment to fish.

I THOUGHT THAT IS WAS JUST OKAY. WHILE MAKING THE SALSA IT SOUNDED GOOD.PERHAPS IT NEEDED MORE ANCHOVIE PASTE OR SOMETHING TO KICK IT UP AND GIVE IT SOME LIFE. NOT BAD. JUST FOR ALL THE CUTTING AND CHOPPING I WOULD HAVE HOPED FOR A STRONGER FLAVOR. MY HUSBAD THOUGHT IT COMPLETELY BORING!!
