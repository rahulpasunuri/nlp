We all thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I made a 1/2 batch for my family of 3, and it was just the right amount. In this proportion, the water was needed. I couldn't get haddock and my fishmonger recommended grouper (it was fresh). The grouper broke down in the cooking - I'll try adding the fish closer to the end of the cook time. I'll skip the squid...no matter what I do to squid it's too chewy for my tastes. The stew base is so yummy, I'll double the broth recipe next time and freeze it. This could turn into a quick week-day dinner with the stew base already done.

Easy to make and good! Would add half the fennel at the end of cooking to enhance the flavor and perhaps some chopped celery for crunch. Did not add water * a little tomato paste to thicken.

Yummy! I did make some changes though. I added clams, scallops, and snow crab and eliminated the calamari. Next time I will leave out the cup of water for a thicker broth. Everyone loved it and went for seconds.

I made this last week and it was so easy and I have to say very de-lish! My husband rated it an 8 compaired to the resturant dishes he has had - so I'd say that was pretty good. I would definately make this again. I served it with sourdough bread, white wine, and a couple of slices of Jarlsberg cheese- so good. I got the fish etc in a nice package sold at costco.

In San Francisco, don't they add some saffron? I lived there for 3 years, and I thought I tasted saffron in the recipe..

Easy. Delightful. My fiance and I really enjoyed this recipe. My only change was the cod. My market was out of cod, and the associate suggested orange roughy.

My family had this for Christmas Eve. It was delicious, but, like most other reviewers, I have to say that you can't call it Cioppino w/o Dungeness Crab. Add that and it's great!

I give this 4 forks for delicious! I Made it for Christmas Eve and I did top each serving with chunks of dungeness crab just to keep it authentic ciopinno.

great fish stew! I'm a simple cowboy from northern Califonia. If you tried to tell me that this was Cioppino I'd refuse to pay! There must be Dungeness crab in Cioppino. But like I said great fish stew...Oh yea more garlic please.

Wonderful easy meal. I substituted scallops for squid and everyone loved it, even my teenager. I added fresh parsley at the end and a pinch of sugar.

The name is wrong. This recipe is for "Seafood Stew in an Italian Style". My family has made cioppino since the 1920's waiting each year for the Dungeness Crab season to begin. If you went to a fundraiser Cioppino The name is wrong. This recipe is for "Seafood Stew in an Italian Style". My family has made Cioppino since the 1920's waiting each year for the Dungeness Crab season to begin. If you went to a fundraiser Cioppino feed and there was no Dungeness Crab in the recipe, everyone would leave. It's like a Superman Movie with Spider man instead. Otherwise the recipe seems OK except for missing lots of Italian Parsley and a bit more garlic.

really wonderful winter evening dish. The fennel worked beautifully with the seafood. I couldn't get the fish counter guy to break up a bag of mussels so used extra of them. Yum!

King crab legs? No no no no no! Use the shrimp AND Dungeness crab and you've got a Cioppino that can't be beat.

I grant the author license to call this a Cioppino, but to imply that any true San Franciscan would EVER use Alaskan king crab in place of our Dungeness crab is a sacrilege! It's almost like referring to my beloved city as 'Frisco'!

Kinda delicious, kinda perfect! This recipe will get me through the winter time for sure.
