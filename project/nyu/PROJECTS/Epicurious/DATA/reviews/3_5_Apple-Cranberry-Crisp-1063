I have brought this to my family's Thanksgiving day dinner for the past three years - they love it!

Good, though nothing special. I must admit that I overprocessed the topping, which made it wetter and less crunchy. I also substituted Gala apples because I was trying to use up my sister's unwanted apples, which probably accounted for the dish being a bit on the sweet side. I'd recommend not using a food processor at all, as well as adding something with more oomph and flavor to bring it up to the 4-fork level.

Have made this dish twice. First time, used fresh cranberries and I thought the texture was a little soft and it was a little tart. Second time, made with cherry flavored Craisins, increased the pecans a little, increased the sugar a little, and threw a pinch of salt into both the topping and the fruit. Much better. Great basic crisp recipe to play with. Definitely try the flavored Craisins.

My favorite apple crisp recipe by far! I usually use a mix of Grannies and Macs for a nice texture variety, and splash in a bit of OJ (I love orange with cranberries and pecans). I'm a big cranberry fan, but be warned -- not everyone is! I brought to a dinner party and 2 folks picked out the cranberries. Each to his own, I guess.

I used an older recipe from Bon Appetit, but can't find it now... this one has most of the ingredients the same. I use Cortland vs Granny Smith, but mix a little lemon juice to keep the apples from browning. Sort of my secret ... :-)

Very good! I doubled the topping ingredients as I felt that the given recipe was too skimpy. I served with Vanilla ice cream and it was a hit. I would have found it too tart in its own.

My husband and I had this at a bed and breakfast we stayed at. It was made with craisins and it was wonderful! I made it that way and it was a hit.

My daughter brought this to our house for dinner the other night. This is not your typical apple crisp. I found it to have the perfect ratio of sweet to tart. The flavor of the fruit wasn't drowned out by the other ingredients and the topping was absolutely delicious--still terrific the next day.

This dessert is wonderful comfort food. My husband loves tart desserts and thought the combination of cranberries and apples was excellent.

This is an ideal fall dessert. Always get compliments and requests for recipe. I just follow recipe with no changes and it's always delicious! Highly recommend!

Fabulous, and fabulously easy. You can omit the 1/4 c. sugar -- the brown sugar is all that's needed.

Substituted blueberries for cranberries. Crust stayed crisp the first day but, was soggy the next.

Simply delish. My husband nearly ate all of it in one sitting.
