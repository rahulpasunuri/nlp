dear Cook from California: Check the Coriander Curry Dip on this site. It seems to be the correct recipe, and the review says it's fabulous. How unfortunate you had to make it twice (I would have done the same thing) when the error is in the recipe - a package of gelatin should be added to the tin of beef consomme.

Something is wrong with this recipe -- I have tried it twice and it doesn't gel. The first time I thought the problem might be that I had used low-fat cream cheese, but I tried again with regular and it still stayed liquid. What am I doing wrong? Or has something been left out of the recipe?
