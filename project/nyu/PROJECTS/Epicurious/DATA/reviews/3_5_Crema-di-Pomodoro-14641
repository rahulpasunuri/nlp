I will definitely make this recipe again. I used light cream to cut back on the fat and it was still excellent. The croutons are nice and chewy when allowed to sit in the soup for a little while. Everyone loved this dish.

I made this first for Christmas eve dinner in 2001 and loads of times since. It is definitely a family favorite. Someday I'll have to try it as written with the dried oregano (I've always substituted fresh basil). Immersion blender before adding cream etc. is definitely the way to go. If tomtoes are very acid a touch of sugar is good. Some of the family enjoys with cheese metlted into individual bowls etc. The croutons are a great addition but not necessary if your looking for a low carb option or just a great creamy tomato soup

Absolutely the MOST wonderful tomato soup EVER!

When making soups and sauces from tomatoes I add baking soda to cut down on the acidity.

My daughter loves this soup so much she is insisting I make it for Thanksgiving! I've made it a few times -- with low fat milk and sour cream it is quite good, but with the full-fat dairy products it is amazing!

Pretty good, but it just didn't do it for us. I froze the leftovers and may try to use it as a sauce over pasta, or perhaps using noodles in the soup instead of the croutons.

No bad. But not the best ever. A little acidic - sugar definitely required.

Wonderful! I substituted a cup of chicken stock for the water and used low-fat sour cream. Added chopped basil too. The consistency was right, and the taste was perfect, nicely tangy. It was a bit crunchy, either the diced veggies could've cooked longer or the soup should've been pureed longer. But I'll fix that next time. PS. It froze and defrosted beautifully.

This soup turned out beautifully. For more flavor, I would suggest using chicken stock instead of water. And there is no need to add any thinning liquids after incorporating the cream and sour cream. The consistency is the best! I had to add a teaspoon of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes (I used San Marzano - nothing compares). I also served it with garlic-romano crostini. Fabulous!

This is exactly what I have been looking for! It is identical to the wonderful tomato soup served at La Madeleine. I just substituted basil instead of oregano. I also used fat free half and half as well as fat free sour cream. So now, I don't have to pay $3 for a cup of soup, and I don't have the guilt about the fat. I also pureed it using a hand-held immersion blender, before adding the water and creams. It gave me a better sense for the consistency and taste before I added any more liquids.

This soup is absolutely wonderful. Will definitely keep recipe and make when I want great tomato soup! I used fat-free sour cream instead of regular and it was still very creamy and thick.

Very nice. I added a little sliced fennel with the other aromatics and used thyme instead of fennel. Added a dollop of creme fraiche at the table.

Simply the best cream of tomato soup I've ever had. I'd write a longer review but I'm off to make it again...

This soup was delicious and super-easy. I like a very smooth soup, so I strained out the solids after pureeing in the blender. Impressive and delicious enough for a dinner party, but simple and quick to make. Definitely make ahead the day before, as it tasted better the second day.

I loved this soup. It's not showy, just simple and oh so yummy. I didn't have any sour cream so I substituted fat free yogurt. Plus I only had a 1/2 cup of half and half so had to use 2% for the rest and it still came out great. I'm sure with the full fat dairy products it would have been even better. I agree that the croutons were a must along with the Parmesan topping.

Mmmm, very good. I was suprised how much you could taste the carrots. It definetly isn't a typical tomato soup - but that is what makes it good. I cut the recipe in half since there were only two of us and that seemed to work out fine. Next time, I'll probably lessen the sour cream by a fourth and increase the cream instead - but that is just personal preference. The croutons are a must!!!

My husband who hates tomatoes, loves this soup He once ate a whole batch by his self. Excellent soup on cold winter nights!!!!

Fabulous! I didn't add the cup of water, because I like it thicker. And, I skimmed on all the cream, opting to use plain yoghurt instead. It was so yummy! Next time I will blend it for longer, as it was a little bit 'piece-y'. Can't wait to make it again!

I had company for dinner and served it as a first course. I knew I had a winner when conversation stopped dead and all I could hear was soup being devoured. I used the low-fat sour cream and used fresh oregano and basil. The taste was creamy and rich, a pot of tomato-filled goodness. Will definately make this over and again!

O, boy! This is one of the best soup recipes Gourmet has published. It is simple enough but so rich it could have been a marathon of preparation. I opted for sherry instead of plain white wine, and since I tend to make this quite often, I also used nonfat and lowfat sour creams instead of the cream. Still incredibly rich. Please make this by the prescribed directions first. You'll make it again and again!

I made this recipe for an Italian themed dinner party. It was very well received by our guests and all of them wanted printed copies of the recipe before they left. It is easy to prepare and makes you look like a real gourmet chef.

Very tasty and very easy to make. Great for a cold winter evening with a salad and a baguette of toasted french bread.

Fabulous soup! Everyone who tried it had to have the recipe. Easy and stunning. I substituted 1/2and 1/2 for cream and didn't add water. It was quite thick and rich. Yummy. Next time I'm going to try with whole milk. Fat watching is an issue for me and I will not try low fat sour cream over heat,so milk is the place to cut the fat.

This is great, my son will not eat any other. I have made it so many times I have lost count. Never disapointed me.

This is a fabulous creamy tomato soup! I made a couple of changes that worked well... first I used fresh tomatos right out of the garden, then strained the entire dish through a sieve after puree-ing. As a garnish in addition to the croutons (which I used fresh packaged garlic-cheese croutons for salads), I diced up a tomato, seeded, and threw on top. Wonderful! Even my teenage girls loved it and they don't care for tomatos!!

Added 7 basil leaves to the vegies. This is a wonderful light luch and is so much better the next day. Don't forget to sprinke extra parmesan on top, then brown under the broiler. Ahhh...

A delicious soup with MUCH body and a lovely taste. It's surprisingly good at saturating hunger. I ate this while skiing in italy and therefore managed to get to dinner without getting hungry. However, it did not make me feel stuffed up like much other italian food.
