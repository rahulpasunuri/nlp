Good basic recipe but for those who think it is taking too long to bake, do what you should do for fluffy and crispy baked potato wedges, i.e. parboil the potatoes for a few minutes (how long depends upon the size of the potato piece). Drain, then follow the rest of the recipe. I also add garlic and a little chili pepper (or smoked paprika) to this recipe but that's just me.

Oh my goodness!!! I haven't even made these yet. I went to a Christmas dinner at a friend's house and she fixed these for the first time. They were so good. I now have the recipe and I can't wait to fix them for my family, hopefully Christmas eve. They will love them!!! Try them...she said they were simple to make and there were none left on any body's dish when I helped with cleanup. Wish me luck although it seems so simple that I think I won't need it.

This is good, but beware the cooking time. Took a lot longer than 1 hr to cook in same size dish with 1/2" potatoes.

We really liked these potatoes. I didn't have the cheese they called for, used a havarti basil and tomato...added mexican spice that I have. They were a nice change. I did remove the tin foil for the last 15 minutes and put on convection. Will make again, they went well with Pork and Red Onion Kebabs, also found on this site.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. He even had the leftovers the next morning with fried eggs for breakfast. I think I'll try it next time with cheddar cheese to make it more appealling to my eight year old.

This was ok. Not bad but not great. I much prefer the Sausage and Potato Casserole for a nice breakfast dish.

I made this using turkey bacon, reduced fat cheddar cheese, 1/2 tsp hot pepper flakes and half of the butter. The potatoes came out tender and crisp and it was so good my father is bugging me to make them again...which I will and I'll try the jack cheese the next time. Definitely broil them for the last 2 minutes! It makes them real crisp.

My wife is constantly pestering me to make these potatos again, and again. I use the thickest bacon I can find. I can't tell you how much we love this dish.

A family favourite! I doubled the cheese. This is a recipe that lends itself to many variations.
