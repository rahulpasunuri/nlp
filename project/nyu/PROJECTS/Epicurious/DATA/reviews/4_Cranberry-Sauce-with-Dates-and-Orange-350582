I didn't have the balsamic vinegar, ran down to the corner grocer and bought what they had on the shelf, raspberry vinegar. I used powdered cinnamon because that is what I had on hand. It hasn't even cooled yet and I had to review this recipe because it tastes so wonderfully intense with a lot of depth. After an initial taste using 3/4 c. sugar, I increased it to the amount called for because the raw organic sugar I was using seemed to taste more mildly sweet than white sugar. I used a liberal amount of vinegar adding a little at a time until the flavors tasted balanced. I can't wait to try it with turkey at Christmas!

Oh my Lawt!!! This is hands down the BEST cranberry sauce EVER!!! Following the advice of a few Master foodies, I cut the sugar in half. To that the Good Idea Fairy prompted me to add 1/4 c. of Grand Marnier & a few tablespoons of tawny port...et VOILA!!!! Fabulosity on a spoon!!! My 15 year old initially turned his nose up at it when I offered him a taste. He changed his tune as soon as it hit his bottom lip. After cleaning the spoon he asked to clean the pot once it cooled. W00T!!!

This is the best cranberry sauce I've ever made or tasted! I've been making it since the recipe came out in the 2008 Gourmet issue, and people always ask me for the recipe. This year, I made it with only 1/2 cup of sugar, instead of the 11/4 cups, and I prefer the tartness, though it's still sweet enough from the dates and OJ.

I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. However, I found this almost too tart so at the end I added some honey and chopped sugared apples slices. I also added about 1T fresh ground ginger and used Blood Orange balsamic vinegar. I did not have dates so substituted white raisins and dried cherries. Finally I added about 1/2-3/4 c chopped walnuts after the sauce had sat a bit.

I really loved this recipe, but I was sad that nobody at dinner complimented it. They liked my sweet potatoes more. (Spiced sweet potatoes, the recipe is on this website and they are lovely!)

Very nice recipe. I too increased the Balsamic to 4 TBSP, and used the rind of a whole orange. I added 1 tsp of my own homemade vanilla extract (made with Jack Daniels and Vanilla beans). It compliments the date flavour and adds a nice background note. It's going to be a nice addition to our Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow. (Yes, in Canada our Thanksgiving is in October.)

This recipe is delicious. I added a 1/2 tablespoon more of the balsamic and about a teaspoon of ground cloves and used only 1/2 cup sugar. I also used dried plums instead of dates. FANtastic!! I will definitely make this a lot!

This is superb. Many compliments at our recent Thanksgiving dinner. My only variance from the recipe was to add a 4th tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.

This cranberry sauce is wonderful. I love added half the cranberries later.. adds some texture. I did reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup and substituted the orange juice and zest with tangerine (available on hand). Worked perfectly.

This was a hit on my Thanksgiving table last year - I plan to make it again this year. I agree with the previous reviewer that the balsamic vinegar adds a great subtle flavor.

This recipe has definitely won a place on my Thanksgiving menu. It was very elegant and sophisticated-tasting. The balsamic vinegar adds a wonderful, subtle flavor. Adding half the berries later in the cooking process is a great idea; I liked the variety of more cooked berries with some that popped in my mouth.

Absolutely wonderful! As others have mentioned, I used Medjool dates. I used the zest from one whole large orange, which may be more than the '3 strips' on the ingredient list.

I made this last year and it was amazing. I used mejool dates and tangerine zest/juice because I had tangerines on hand. Everyone loved it; I am definitely making it again this year

This did not have as much flavor as I hoped and there are much better cranberry recipes. It was definitely better the next day though.
