I think I let the sugar get too molten, and the walnuts turned into hard candied walnuts. Still tasted good, but too much like candy. Getting the nuts lightly coated with warm powdery spiced sugar may be the best approach.

The nuts on their own are exceptional. I had no problem getting the sugar to work--just dump in the nuts as the sugar begins to liquify. I did use freshly ground star anise and cardamom which made it very flavorful! And I shook the pan and stirred to get the nuts coated well.

I came to this looking for a recipe for spiced nuts to serve as a holiday nibblie. I used mixed nuts instead of walnuts. Technically, I found having the sugar just starting to melt didn't work for me. I ended up with BIG clumps of sugar. I will try letting it liquify more the next time. I also ended up making a completely different spice mixture once -- cinnamon, cloves, cumin -- which was also quite good.

This is my new go-to salad to [quickly and cheaply] impress guests. I use Bartlett pears and Parmesan cheese. I've been using a strawberry-champagne vinaigrette with it, which is deeee-lightful.

Made this as part of my mothers day feast. Both my mother and I loved it. The rest of the family like it. It had just a great combination of flavors. I made the salad using the ham and blue cheese variation. I used black forest ham cut in a small dice and in addition to the european greens I included spinach. I also substituted orange champagne vinegar rather than the sherry vinegar because I had that on hand. As I prefer a less oily dressing I changed the proportions of oil to vinegar dramatically and used equal amounts of the hazelnut and canola oil. Lastly I used pecans rather than walnuts and they added a unique zip to the flavors.
