Fantastic flavors in this dish and super easy to make. This will be my stand by bbq shrimp dish and it works beautifully as a side. I served it with bbq corn, jerk chicken and an udon noodle salad.

My 17 year old son and I made this tonight and it's a keeper. Not a fan of too spicy food, I used Serrano peppers in place of the hot red chili and jalapeño pepper and added 1/2 cup diced red pepper and an avocado to the mango salad. I also replaced the shallot with 1/2 of a finely diced red onion and added the other half of the finely diced onion to the shrimp. I also used EVOO instead of "vegetable oil." Instead of basting the shrimp, we marinated them in the basting ingredients for 30 minutes before cooking. We served it over brown rice which made it feel like a bowl of health. A++ for flavor!

This was great! Fresh and tasty. Sauteed the shrimp instead of grilling and would do it again - in fact, I was surprised how good the simple shrimp/jalapenos/cumin combo was.

This one is a keeper. A really surprising, interesting combination of tastes. I used less heat according to my company's preference and served with coconut rice.

Rating: 4
Wow what a combination. But no red hot chile peppers, as suggested I used 1/8 t. red pepper flakes. For the jalapeno peppers, I should have used gloves, but I did the oil for the shrimp with the cut up jalepeno and my hands burned and I was coughing, so I took the bits of jalepena out. It must have been really, really hot. The shrimp grilled with cumin, oil that had had cut up jalepena marinated in it was fabulous and plenty hot. Next time I think I will just do oil, red pepper flakes and cumin. I just peeled the shrimp totally and grilled them in a basket that held them flat (but curled) and the shrimp turned out beautiful! And I did add 1 small avocado. My mangoes were huge and lovely so it was a generous serving of mango. Mint from my garden.

Loved this --quick and easy and full of flavor. Definitely making again. I left out the chile and shallot because we can't eat them and substituted paprika for the cilantro. And for shrimp substituted paprika for the jalapeno. Brilliant flavors for an early spring dinner.

A great summer dinner. I served it over basmati rice and brocolini. Definitely will make it again, next time I will add a little more kick to the salad and cut the amount of sugar, since the mangoes were sweet enough. The shrimp was great with the cumin.

I made this for a pot luck, so instead of placing the shrimp on top of the mango salad, I cut each large shrimp into thirds and mixed them right in. I also added avocado. Everyone LOVED it. The combination of sweet and spicy and creamy is fantastic.

Yum! This was really good. Just made it, used gulf shrimp [pre-spill ones :( ] which are the best anywhere and those champagne mangos that are out right now. They are delish. We used habanero but not enough so compensated with cayenne afterwards which worked well. Would definitely make again!

This is a very easy and tasty salad to make. It lends itself easily to adaptations. The brown sugar and lime juice were interesting and delicious together. I wanted to make it more main dish so I added 1/2 red bell pepper chopped, and 1/2 avocado chopped. I ran short on the mint and had no cilantro which I think would have both added immensely to the flavor. I coated the shrimp in olive oil, salt, pepper, and cumin and then did a quick saute in the pan. I also added a clove of crushed garlic. I left the hot peppers out as my husband doesn't care for them. My husband declared it was delicious and we will be making it again!

This is an excellent recipe. I've made it with cooked costco shrimp and costco cut mango, and it's unbelievably easy to make. I cut the cumin in half and blend it with the onion, the lime juice, the mint (pack it), the brown sugar, and the celantro. (I do not like "hot" food, so I excluded the peppers. I served the whole thing on a bed of fresh baby spinach. Marvelous!

This recipe is great. I did not have cumin so I used garam masala. I also drained the mango salad and added it to the pan that I fried the shrimp in and added water, cornstarch and a dash of Victoria's Citrus Ginger spice, salt and pepper. I served it with scallion pancake, coconut rice on one side, skewered shrimp on the other, with a small amount of the sauce on the rice and the skewered shrimp. I think this would be good with boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs as well. I made too much of the salad but I intend to recycle that tomorrow by making a salsa with a few pulses of the food processor and some tomato's.

Rating: 4
The best summer meal to be eaten on my porch! Threw an extra mango into the salsa to serve a table of seven and doubled the amount of shrimp. Served over a bed of romaine with a side of coconut rice! So easy...so good! The only thing time consuming was peeling and deveining the shrimp. Otherwise, a PERFECT summertime meal. For dessert we served grilled peaches with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream. Mmmm. The guests raved about everything! I will make this a new staple.

this is yummy! perfect for a hot summer night. I did not make the shrimp part, and still thought it was perfect. I paired with louisiana deviled crab cakes and it went really well. I used jalapeno and some red pepper instead of red chile.

I thought I didn't like mangos until I made this. This is a dish so good you think about it for days after. NOTE: Vote with your wallet and buy U.S. farmed or wild shrimp, *not* imported, which is a bad environmental decision.

I loved this recipe. My traditional mangos were under-ripe so I used the Altufo (sp?) variety - which I really love but they are smaller - so I needed 4 of them. Anyway, the salad turned out beautifully. The sweet/cool mango offset by the heat of the red chile - a perfect combination of flavours. This recipe has joined my Top 25 recipe list. Yummy.

I made this for a dozen co-workers...there wasn't a bit left! My only change was to use red pepper flakes in place of the chopped chile pepper. I love pretty much anything with mango (or shrimp, come to think of it!)...I used Trader Joe's frozen mango chunks. I just defrosted them and sliced them into slightly smaller pieces. This is definitely a keeper!

I made the mango salad and skewered shrimp (with marinade poured on top) in advance, refrigerated while I went to a graduation ceremony. When we returned, I simply grilled some rustic bread with olive oil, layered each plate with greens, grilled shrimp and served - beautiful, delicious, a real (healthy) winner. BTW: forgot the mint, no problem!

This recipe has it all. Ease, taste, visual appeal.. No fresh red chile on hand so had to use jalapeno, and added some red pepper flakes for added color. Also used some in the oil for the shrimp. Was skeptical about the cumin, but I think it is a key element in the flavor balance. Served with asparagus on the side, but found myself dipping it in the remaining juices of the salad.... that was pretty good too!

im 13 years old, and this was such an easy dish to make. Mango salad with shrimp took me about 50 minutes to make, but thats including running around the house asking my parents where the ingredients were. hehe. I made this dish for my parents, and they loved it! it was the 1st dish i have ever made myself (besides top ramen). i recommend this recipe to anyone! its great!

Splendiferous! The spicy shrimp is excellent--a definite make-again since we love really spicy food. My husband, who doesn't like shrimp much, except in fried and grilled forms, raved about this and said it'd be fine without the mango part. However, I think it's the combination of ingredients that gives this dish an extraordinary taste. By the way I completely shelled medium shrimp and tossed them in the marinade; my husband grilled the shrimp over charcoal in a grill pan with holes. I served the mango mixture and shrimp over spring mix and with grilled swordfish as entree.

This dish rocks! I squeeze the mango seeds after slicing the mango to make the "mango salad" more like a dressing, then put the shrimp on top of spinich leaves to make a salad out of it. I also add sugared pecans or almonds to the top of the salad. Yum!

I have no idea where Mnemba Island Lodge is, but thank you for the excellent recipe. I had "the girls" over for lunch and everyone raved! I was looking for a light ladies lunch meal and this one fit the bill perfectly. I left out the mint because the market was out of it and it was not missed. Served it over a bed of fresh greens and a side of rice pilaf. A glass of French Rose wine made the meal all the more enjoyable. Bon Appetit!

This is a fabulous recipe. I have made it a few times in the summer on the outdoor grill. I just served it for a first course in a very fancy New Years Eve dinner. I made a few variations. I let the shrimp marinate in the basting sauce for an hour or so, and then cooked it in the George Forman indoor grill. It came out sensational!

We enjoyed this recipe on a beautiful 38' Harris on a mooring in Provincetown Harbor, this past weekend. I'd prepped everything the night before at home, keeping the ingredients separate and mixing at the last moment (which only took a few minutes). Absolutely DELICIOUS! Good for entertaining--i.e., prep before and then simply toss everything together.

The mango salad is to die for. Have made it repeatedly alone, as part of a buffet, and with the shrimp. Have changed nothing on the salad. Have marinated the shrimp longer as suggested in comments. When I've made the shrimp with the mango salad I haven't served this as a first course but as dinner, with the shrimp on their skewer on a bed of basmati rice and some avocado slices. Makes an incredible summer meal.

I've made this 3 times and each time, it was a huge crowd pleaser. There is considerable prep work involved - in fact, once you have all the prep work completed, the actual cooking time is 8 minutes. I've found this to be a fun recipe for "group cooking" - everyone can get involved, without it getting too complicated. And I completely disagree with the reviewer who suggested no marinade for the shrimp - - the cumin paired with the mango salad is what puts this dish over the top!

If I could give this five or six forks I would. I served it as a salad, combining the mango with mixed greens, green onion and cucumber and tossed with double the recipe of dressing, and then topped with coconut rice (at room temp... from this site) and the shrimp. It was amazingly good, perhaps the best salad I've ever eaten! This would make an excellent party or luncheon dish. It's just beautiful with the greens and so simple to make.

Excellent! I made this for a July 4th picnic and it was a huge hit. I did have to add 2 chopped avocados after being a little too zealous with the jalapenos. I also added some minced garlic and a tablespoon of brown sugar to the shrimp marinade. Definitely one of my favorite recipes.

Unbelievable! I made a fraction of the recipe today to test out for a dinner party, intending to share it with my husband and get his opinion. Good thing I didn't mention it to him because I ate the whole thing in about 3 minutes flat. I'd feel guilty if I didn't know I was making it again Saturday. Left out the cilantro, doubled the marinade, quickly sauteed the shrimp in my wok. The amount of peppers was perfect (just spicy enough but NOT hot). Don't forget the fresh mint -- it really makes it zing!

Agreed! This is one of those dishes that you make to impress your guests! It is so easy, and tastes so complicated.

Four more forks for this great salad. I hesitated to prepare this as I don't have a bar-b-que, but thanks to others who pan fried them..it was great! I marinated the shrimp with the basting sauce, let it sit for about 15 minutes and then tossed the whole whack of it into my wok for about 3 minutes. Adding a fanned avocado to the presentation was perfection on an al fresco evening in our garden.

I found this recipe appealing because it did not have an overabundance of oil and fit nicely into my diet plan. I served it with grilled swordfish basted with a ginger marinade, and a sweet potato (next time we'll be a bit more inventive with the starch). We enjoyed it and would definately make it again. However, next time I would double, the shrimp marinade. There was hardly enough to brush on 10 Jumbo shrimp. I found the mango salad a bit too sweet, and would add less brown sugar next time.

Yup. Just as everyone said, This one is a winner. I took others advice and left the cilantro out and didn't feel anything was missing.

I served it with "Risotto With Vegetables" and called the meal East Meets West.

This dish was fantastic! I made two adjustments - used golden brown instead of dark brown sugar and substituted a jalapeno & jiamaca peppers for the one red chile pepper because I didn't have them on hand -- and the salad still came out great. I also used just one mango and it was plenty. I made the recipe more of an entree by using large prawns and adding steamed white rice. Regardless, the meal was light and very delicious.
