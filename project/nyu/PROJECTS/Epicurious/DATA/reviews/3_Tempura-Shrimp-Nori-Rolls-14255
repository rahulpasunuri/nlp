This is the worst possible tempera recipe ever! The batter is much thick for it to be tempura-style. Also, it was flavorless and dull. My advice, look for another tempera recipe.

This is a fabulous dish. I made the shrimp paste in my food processor, then put the paste in a bowl, rinsed the processor bowl, and processed the batter. I put all my nori sheets out on the counter and assembled them at the same time. Overall, this was much faster and easier than dealing with sushi rice. I pan fried my rolls (2 at a time) in shallow oil for about 3 1/2 minutes and then turned them. They came out tri-sided, and were just beautiful. As with all sushi, slice with a serrated knife. I will definitely make this for parties since the sauce, rolls, and batter can be prepared in advance and the rolls don't need lots of attention to finish off. If you can make sushi without angst, this is a super concept.

I made this recipe as written and was not impressed at all. The shrimp paste was bland and made the rolls mushy. I didn't enjoy the texture or the flavour at all. Never again!

I've made this a couple of times for *important* occasions. The first time my guests hardly got any because I was having a hard time not eating them all as I cut them (it was MY birthday party, after all ;) They are a bit of work, and messy to prepare, but well worth the effort. One of my favorite taste memories of all time. Also very well received by catering clients. If only there was a higher rating...
