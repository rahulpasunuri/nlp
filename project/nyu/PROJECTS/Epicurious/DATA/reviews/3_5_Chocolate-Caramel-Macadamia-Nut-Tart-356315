Oof. Not sure why everyone loves this so much. I made it exact to the recipe bringing the filling to 240 degrees, and the "carmel" came out hard as a rock and cracked & crumbled like a praline. Plus, this dessert is obscenely sweet. I could barely eat it.

Made this for our dinner club to rave reviews. Will be bringing it to Christmas dinner as well as to another dinner. Easy and delicious. I got the macadamia nuts at a health food store.

Addendum: Ok. The tartlet idea turned out better than I thought previously. I had tried taking them out of the pans before they had been refrigerated. But, after refrigeration, the excess carmel popped right of the outside of the tin, and the tartlet popped right out also. They made a stunning display to rave reviews and you can make them several days ahead and store in the fridge. I got good at the dough forming, and was able to make 13 tartlets, some bigger than others, so it really depends on the size of your pans. My previous review made it sound like I made extra of the ganache, carmel and nuts - what I meant was that I had extra leftover. I would suggest, if using tartlets, double the dough and 1.5 x the other things to make 24(+) tarts.

This is really delicious, but it is rich, so I'm sure you can get more than 10 servings out of it - shoot for 12. I made this to spec's except that I tried making it into tartlets instead of one big one. I would not suggest doing that. It made 11 tarts, with extra ganache, caramel, and nuts, plus it made a mess with the caramel spilling over the sides of the tartlets. As to the caramel, make sure to take the pan off the heat a few degrees shy of 240, because the pan is hot and it will continue cooking. For example, after I had poured the caramel onto the tartlets, I had leftover, so I got a piece of parchment and poured the leftover onto that. Well, the caramel on the tartlets is perfect, but the stuff that stayed in the pan while I got out the parchment was crunchy and hard when it cooled.

I made this a couple months back and it didn't turn out as great as I had hoped. =[ The only thing I did wrong was burning the caramel. It could have been the burnt caramel that set things off, but to me, the crust was a bit salty and appeared to have no taste. If I were to make it again (which I probably will since my boyfriend loves Macadamian nuts) I would omit a lot of the salt and add some sort of flavoring to the crust to actually give it flavor.

I made this for my family for our New Years/Christmas Party. It was a hit! I added the lime juice to the carmel as some suggested and it turned out fantastic! I did use a ref pie crust instead of the crust it called for... I would do this one again any day

The caramel was rock hard and took longer than 2 1/2 minutes to reach 240 degrees. I substituded pecans for macadamia nuts. Heated the tart in the microwave to soften the caramel. It was very good. Will make again but will not cook caramel to 240 degrees.

this was delicious and easy to make. at first i wasn't going to make this cake as i don't have a candy thermometre but it looked so good that i just had to try. each step was very straight- forward and turned out perfectly, even the caramel. as i said i don't have a candy thermometre so just kept swirling the pan until i achieved the amber colour and then added the remaining ingredients. the caramel turned out exactly as it should have. my only issue was that i realized while i was pressing the crust into my pan that i had a 10" instead of a 9" so i've just altered the ingredients for next time - and there will be a next time for sure! actually two issues.... when serving i cut myself a very small piece as was rather full from my sister's birthday dinner. and then she took the rest home!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year, with a repeat for Christmas eve (see below). This is really a great recipe, and it makes a very impressive presentation. Plus it's not too difficult. For some reason, I couldn't find unsalted macadamia nuts this year so I used walnuts. Those worked fine, although the macadamias would probably have been even better. This makes a big, very rich dessert, and we only ate half of it at Thanksgiving (of course, we also had several other desserts), so I froze the rest (very carefully, with parchment between slices and the whole thing wrapped in heavy-duty foil). I'd thought about slicing these again into diagonals to add as xmas cookies but forgot to do so, so I ended up bringing them as individual slices to a friend's house for xmas eve dinner dessert. She passed around vanilla ice cream, which went well with them. I believe everyone enjoyed them. I know I did.

I love to cook/bake and the more challengeing the recipe the better I like it. We had 8 guests for a coffee/champagne/dessert Christmas get-together. I made Epicurious's Sweet Potato Pie with Marshmallow Meringue, Land O Lakes Peppermint Candy Squares, Kraft's Marbled Grahams, and Lee Bailey's English Trifle with Chambord, and the most challenging - this recipe. I have never made caramel before. This recipe really made my holiday for that fact alone....the caramel came out perfectly! The press in the pan butter crust was delicious and easy. I left the macadamias very chunky, and that combined with the bittersweet ganache, the gooey caramel and flourishing finish of the piped ganache made an impressive, delectable dessert. I also agree with the poker guys below......"good and chewy, nice and gooey"! Those who had problems with the caramel are not following the directions....go back, re-read and try again.... it's only a little sugar and you'll be pleased when you get it right!

The end result was not at all what I was expecting. I followed the directions exactly and, as happened to one of the reviewers below, the caramel came out like rock candy and took way longer than 2-1/2 minutes to get to 240 degrees. In fact I could only get the temperature to move beyond 200 degrees by turning the heat up as high as possible, at which point it still took another 4 minutes or so to get to 240. All of the other components came out beautifully, and it did taste delicious, even though it was more of a brittle than a tart (the chiseled shards didn't look so great at my Christmas Eve dinner). Still, I'd try it again if I knew what went wrong.

This is my first review. Please, forgive my english (it´s a learned one!!!) I made this tart last night 4 Christmas Eve and everybody like it. But I must say that I change a few things (just 2, actually). First, since I couldn´t find macadamia nuts here (I don´t think I can find them in any store of the city) I used almonds and hazelnuts and it was really tasty and crunchy!! And second, since I read the reviews yesterday, specially the ones saying that the caramel turned hard, I made the caramel only with 1 cup sugar, substituting the remaining 1/4 cup sugar for the same amount of glucose. When the caramel started to cold, it went spreadable and smooth. In conclusion, I think it ended up just well. Thanxx for the advice of the other reviews.

The caramel came out too hard to cut. I used a thermometer and stopped at 240 degrees. It took a lot longer that 2.5 minutes to get there. Maybe a lower finishing temperature for the caramel would work? I live at 2000 foot elevation so I don't think that should make much difference.

Follow recipe as written and you can't go wrong. When I mixed the dough it tasted too salty to me, but in the finished tart it was a good balance to the sweetness of the chocolate and caramel.

Delicious and easy. Followed the recipe exactly as written. Of the 8 recipes made for a party, this was the only one my 23 year old son asked me to save!

I hardly bake and was intimidated at first by this recipe, but it looked and read so good. I had to buy a tart pan and went to 3 stores to find one. Going step by step, the recipe was very easy to follow. The result were wonderful. Will be making it again to bring as a gift to a Christmas dinner.

Extremely easy to make. I suggest chopping the nuts finely in a processor to avoid having a mouthful of very chewy caramel and large chunks of Macadamia nut. If you are not adept at preparing caramel, then practice first before attempting this dessert. Most importantly, have your frozen crust ready to receive the caramel as quickly as possible. I found that the caramel was very intolerant to adjustment after about twenty seconds. Certainly a crowd pleaser!

This crust is fool-proof (I'm crust-adverse) and the final product is a show-stopper. I agree that chopping the nuts finely would help -- in Thanksgiving madness, I skipped the chopping and the nuts were too chunky. The caramel does have a candy-like toothsomeness to it, but I liked that. Taste was a great...a nice salty-sweet combo.

I thought it was good but not worth all the effort. My caramel had a beautiful color but was very hard and completely covered the nuts. It was messy to serve and got stuck in your teeth. Good flavor but not fantastic.

This recipe was absolutely divine! Although it was time consuming to make, it was not difficult and worth all the effort. Next time, however, I will chop up the macadamia nuts a little more, since my kids did not like the chunky texture they provided. I could not find unsalted macadamia nuts and used dry roasted. It tasted just as good.

Made this for Thanksgiving and this is probably one of my favorite desserts EVER.. Family loved it and has requested it for Christmas.

Spectacular dessert...one of the BEST shortbread pastry recipes ever. Loved the rave reviews of my guests. Caramel was delectable. Small servings a must.

Huge hit at a Xmas party dessert buffet. Caramel takes a long time to darken up during initial sugar syrup boil. Might be possible to speed that by adding a bit of lime juice (worked in other caramel recipes I've used.) My caramel did come out the "correct" color, but it had me worried. I pushed the macadamia down into the ganache, which wasn't the right thing to do. I already have requests in for a repeat.

The hands-down favorite of the Thanksgiving dessert buffet, which included lemon cheesecake w/huckleberry sauce, rum-raisin apple pie, and pumpkin pie. As another reviewer noted, my caramel wasn't the dark amber shown in the photo. More time and heat while cooking the sugar/water mixture would probably fix that. Keep in mind that that's your only chance to darken the caramel; after adding butter and cream, you'll want to stick to the temperature and time listed in the recipe.

I'm not a baker - too much like chemistry class. This recipe was the most difficult baked thing, beside cheesecake, I've ever made. It was outstanding. It also left my chocolate mousse sitting in the dust. Something new on my most requested list from my guests.

I made this recipe as is and it was great!!! Very rich so I suggest small servings with vanilla ice cream. My caramel didn't come out quite as amber as I would have hoped, but I believe a higher heat and longer cooking time of the sugar/water process could cure that. Also, my dough was very creamy and not crumbly at all, I believe this is because I sifted the flour twice, if you sift your flour, I suggest bumping it up a 1/4-1/3 cup. Came out beautiful though!
