These cookies are really unusual and delicious. I didn't know what to expect given the combination of chocolate, spices and citrus, but it is like a rich gingerbread. The currants really help. I used cherry brandy because that's all I had, and I didn't have the citrus peel for the top, but otherwise followed the recipe faithfully. I would make it again! Not sure this is a recipe for your holiday cookie swap, as it is non-traditional, but it is very tasty and unusual.
