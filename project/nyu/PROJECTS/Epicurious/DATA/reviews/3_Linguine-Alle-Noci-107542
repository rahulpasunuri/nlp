Loved the combination of the walnuts and cheese. Next time, I would definitely reduce the amount of pepper flakes--the kick kind of overpowered the rest of the dish.

my husband and i love a similar version of this dish that we used to get at this small italian place in bellingham, wa. when in a pinch this recipe will do just fine, especially with the addition of anchovies and a bit of gorgonzola. and maybe a bit less bread crumbs.

I would love to understand what I did wrong with this dish--some of the reviewers love this dish, the rest do not, and into that camp I fall...The dish sounded so delicious, but my results were dry and uninteresting.

This dish was horrible. Noone at my dinner table liked it including me. It needed some sauce to this recipe and it tasted very dry. I was very disappointed

This recipe is a unique and elegant side dish for a meat entree. It would also be good with baked winter squash and greens for vegetarians. I've found it's really best when made with high quality ingredients - fresh pasta and good cheese.

We enjoyed this dish as an alternative to other pasta dishes. I bought the walnuts fresh from the market and shelled them, but left our the rest of the breadcrumbs at the end, since we all found it already pretty dry. We had to add quite a bit of extra virgin olive oil and with enough red wine it turned out a very tasty meal.

I've have never experienced any problems with this dish. Try increasing the olive oil to 1/2 cup and substitute the bread crumbs with 1 cup mini toasts(broken into quarters). Add the whole cup of mini toasts to the frying pan, that way the toasts will be flavored with the oil, walnut and pepper flakes.

Haven't tried Mario's version, but have been making this recipe in my family for years. Would cut back a little on the pepper and add black olives along with the walnuts. Great as a late-night supper on its own.

Good. Not fabulous but good. Also easy to make and wholesome. Went well with a red Italian "Falcone" '97.

I think I may have made this incorrectly, because I do not agree with the other reviews. I found this pasta very dry--I was adding and adding water. I thought there were too many breadcrumbs also. The directions were light and breezy and maybe a little too vague for inexperienced cooks---it's one of those recipes that isn't as simple as it seems! You might want to practice it on yourself before serving it to guests.

We grew up having this every Christmas eve made by my Grandmother from Avalino. I was very eager to make this year. Grandma added anchovies, mother and sister did not want this addition, so we made Mario's much to our delight. My big sister had 3 servings as I did. Delisiouso!!! Didn't add hot peppers due to Mothers intolerance.

This dish was delicious! A nice alternative carb at dinner. I served it with prime rib. Next time I would go lighter on the bread crumbs since I thought the bread flavor was a little strong. I mixed walnuts and pinenuts instead of just all walnuts, which turned out to be a hit. Everyone (4 adults) at dinner really liked the recipe. For anyone with a low tolerance for hot spices, you might want to reduce the hot pepper flakes a little.
