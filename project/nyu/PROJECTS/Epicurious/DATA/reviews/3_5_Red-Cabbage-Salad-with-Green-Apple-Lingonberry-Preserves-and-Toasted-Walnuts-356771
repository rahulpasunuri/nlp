Really nice flavour and colour. Served with swedish meatballs and egg noodles. A nice, light, side with a rich meal.

I made this the other night for family and people loved it. The only thing it might have lacked was some sort of spice.

Fabulous! Everyone loved it and I made it ahead by slicing up the cabbage and putting it in the refrig. Then I made the rest of the dressing and mixed it with the apples to keep them from turning. When ready, just mix it all together and top with the remaining nuts. It was easy and delicious! I made it again 3 nights later...same reviews. It's a 5 in my estimation.

Made according to the recipe and it was outstanding -- tangy, crisp, very pretty. Took a previous reviewer's advice and let it stand, with dressing, a couple hours beforehand. Added apple just before serving. World Market (Costco) also has Lingonberry preserves.

Easy to make and keeps well. Lingonberry is a distinct fruit - it is more like cranberries than raspberries and worth the extra effort to find the correct ingredient. After making this once, it's easy to whip up without measuring - half a cabbage, an apple or two, and a mixture of jam, mustard, and vinegar. I wasn't super thrilled with the walnuts' role in this dish. Will experiment to find other nutes. Keeps well. Actually, you might want to make this a few hours ahead of time in order to give the flavors time to mingle.

I thought this was quite good; I followed the recipe excactly. Next time I will try adding chicken and eating it as a main course. I wish people would not say they are not blown away by a recipe when in fact they change everything about it. Maybe not blown away by their own verson would be more appropriate.

Nice, but not blown away by it. I may have gone too light on the seasoning - salt and pepper. Definitely needed the apple. I used the entire granny apple in the salad, and julienned fugi on top. Used toasted pecans, raspberry jam. Think I'll try Chicken in the left overs as per another reviewer.

Perfect starter and I Personaly gave this salad 4 forks simply because it is a meal by itself or add some Chicken breast slices and some garlic croutons for a great main course, if you are watching weight(Like me) just choose your dressing carefully.The Poker Guys as a group give it a 3 cause it didnt have meat in the original recipe, So I also made it with Beef Fajita meat and they gave it a 4. Carnivores! Whaddaya gonna do?

Great winter salad. A little sweet and a little tangy. I will definitely keep and serve again. I substituted raspberry preserves for the lingonberry and omitted most of the oil. Simply delicious!

I made this tonight as a first course with beef short ribs. Nice seasonal color. Nice crunch from the cabbage and apple, and the Ligonberry preserves gave it a tartness. Thanks to Whole Food for having Lingonberry preserves! Everyone enjoyed it and I was asked for the recipe.
