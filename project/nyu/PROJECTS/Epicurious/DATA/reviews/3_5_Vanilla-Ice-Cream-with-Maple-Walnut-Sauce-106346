Super easy, totally yummy. My husband (not a big dessert guy) loved this on vanilla ice cream. Added the leftover to banana milkshakes the following day for an after school treat. Maple Walnut Banana Shakes...the kids were thrilled.

Ok, but nothing special. Maybe this recipe would work better with pecans. I prefer a thicker sauce

Simple and tasty. Has anyone tried using whipping cream instead of melted ice cream ?

Save yourself time and just start with Grade B syrup, it has 5 times the flavor of grade A. I got a really good price at www.saintpierrefarms.com or at ebay.

This is amazing! It is incredibly easy to make, and guests think it is very gourmet. My kids love it as much as my husband. Enjoy!

I followed the recommendation to start with more (used 8T of the maple syrup) and waited awhile longer for it to reduce (I think about 10 to 12 minutes). Turned out wonderfully. Simple and tasty and it made me look good!

I have been making my own maple walnut sauce since 31 Flavors stopped having it in our store, years ago. If some feel it is too watery, add a few drops of maple flavoring, I always do this.

Just a comment - just marinate walnuts in maple syrup- can refrigerate for months - easy, delicious, thick sauce! First created this sundae topping while living in Belgrade, Yugoslavia where no sundae topping, per se, was available!

For those that like their ice cream with an excellent topping this recipe is hard to beat. Its simple to make and incredible to eat.

Not bad - a bit watery - not what I expected, but my husband could have eaten a tub full (he is a swine). I would use Georgia Pecans next time instead - walnuts are too California! Go Dixie! Love to my sister in LA!

If you use more pure maple syrup than called for, let it heat and reduce for a longer period of time(have patience), eventually you will obtain the consistency you desire.

I too thought this recipe was very good but what I did was the first time it was a little "watery" so I added some caramel and it thickened up nice! I've also tried butterscotch at my boyfreinds request and he loved it!

I have used pure cane syrup instead of the maple syrup. Let it cook down before adding the nuts. This makes it thicker. This is more of a praline taste. Hmm good!

Easy and Simple. I used real maple syrup. My kids loved it. I too wish it had been a little thicker.

Everything is GREAT with Real Maple syrup. I would do this again and again. Thankyou.

This is very good. Next time will use real maple syrup instead of grocery store pancake syrup. I hope someone comes up with a way to thicken this recipe. My wife loved it. Also it is so easy it is can be made in a a few minutes. I made it a head of time and kept in the refrigerator. It reheated in a very short time.
