I've made this several times. It's awesome. I keep forgetting to make these changes, but next time I would either use a regular size pie crust, or I would double the amount of potato mixture. I ended up using more pecans to completely cover the top of the pie.

I never thought that pecans and potatoes make a good pair! This is a very unique and interesting recipe that I will make again, just like other recipes I learned from gourmandia.com.

This is a really fantastic pie recipe!! The best of both sweet potato and pecan pie worlds in one pie. I used a pre-made rolled crust and 1 part sugar/1 part water (boiled down) for the corn syrup. I look forward to making this again properly with corn syrup (or perhaps raw sugar syrup) and the gingersnap pie crust someone else recommended. I would recommend playing around with the spices and perhaps adding ginger, although it's perfect the way it is!!

I made this last night with leftover sweet potatoes. The potatoes had cooked a long time and were very sweet and soft. I used ginger and nutmeg as I didn't have allspice. I also used Lyle's Golden Syrup instead of the corn syrup and I really liked the flavor. Pre-baked a frozen pie crust and it worked fine. This would be great with the gingersnap crust elsewhere on this site. My husband ate 2 huge pieces last night. It is really delicious!

I made this with 1 can of pumpkin, and combined it with the topping recipe for the Pumpkin-Pecan Pie with Whiskey Butter Sauce also on this site, since it had a little more to it. Used a refrigerated pie crust. Resulets were good. BF liked it, but I'm not a big pumpkin pie fan.

This pie turned out great! The mix of sweet potato filling and pecan pie filling was a great balance, esp. when straight pecan pie can be too overwhelmingly sweet. Instead of allspice I used a "warm" spice mix (cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, ginger, etc) as that was all i could find in my grocery store. Also, chopped and toasted pecans first for added flavor. Made with the butter pie crust recipe from this site-worked really well together

I substituted a 2/3 cup mixture of pure maple syrup (1/3 c?), honey, and molasses (2-3T)for the corn syrup. (I just guessed how much of each to use but you get the general idea.) It turned out with just the right amount of sweetness. This pie turned out absolutely perfect and delicious!

This was fabulous, but I made a few changes: First, I used 3/4 of a recipe of the "Best Ever Pie Crust" from July 2007 Bon Appetit, which tastes great and made enough to double up the crust around the edges. Then I borrowed a technique from an old pecan pie recipe I have and boiled dark corn syrup for a few minutes before adding it to the egg, which helped everything set nicely in the oven. One of the other cooks remarked that her pecans were soggy, but this technique made them nice and glazed and crisp. You have to keep a close eye on the syrup, taking it on and off the flame to keep it from boiling over, and then stream it into the egg very slowly, whisking the whole time, but it's worth it. I also added a splash of bourbon to the sweet potatoes, and if I were to make this recipe again (I hope I get the opportunity) I would use half again as much sweet potato, but keep the amount of spices the same. So delicious!

Made this for Thanksgiving day, and everyone loved it. Topped it with a a little whipped cream! Not as heavy as your regular pecan pie.

I also replaced the corn syrup with a mixture of honey, maple syrup and molasses--it was delicious! I've never liked pecan pie, but this recipe is a keeper. The family loved it for Thanksgiving.

It is a very good recipe, my parents were from the south and I love sweet potato pie, like the other poster, I like to try new desserts and side dishes for Thanksgiving, I made this for our office luncheon and it got raves, the only thing I did different is I added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, I always put nutmeg in my sweet potato pies. Delicious!

Had to put my two cents in here folks. A yam is NOT a sweet potato. Although the words are interchanged a lot in American cooking, these two tubers are botanically distinct. I know I have opened a culinary can of worms here, but ....

I made this in filo shell cupcakes, which worked very well. I baked at 350 for 30 min. and it made 8 cupcakes. (yams and sweet potatoes are the same thing.)

In my home, this was a great hit on Thanksgiving. Although I am not a sweet potatoe pie eater nor am I a pecan pie eater, I made this for my husband, who loves both. He could hardly keep away from it. I got many compliments from other family members also. I would do this one again and again.

This recipe waswonderful. I always make the new dishes for Thanksgiving ahead of time so that my family can try it and approve or veto it. We all tried this one and I got Rave reviews. Oh and by the way, you all are right when it comes to Sweet Potato and Yams. They are completly different in taste and texture. Nice Work.

Tried this recipe earlier this year and found it to be excellent. I'm certainly glad I found it again, as I intend to use it for the holidays coming up. Hopefully I won't lose it this time. Thanks, Dorothy Lawson

I really like yams and pecan pie, so this was a great one for me. I didn't have any corn syrup, so I substituted a mixture of maple syrup, honey and molassas. It turned out fine.

To clarify what the previous poster from New York said, Bon Appetit knows that sweet potatoes are not "true" yams (a true yam is a starchy tuber with flesh the color of that of a regular potato and not sweet at all, from the southern hemisphere). BA lists "red-skinned sweet potatoes (yams)" beacause while sweet potatoes are not botanically yams, most people in the US call the orange-fleshed sweet potatoes yams and refer to the yellow-fleshed ones as sweet potatoes.

Thanks to the previous reviewer for clarifying that this recipe uses a regular sweet potato, NOT a yam! I made this pie for Thanksgiving and I got a lot of compliments. I don't know if they were trying to be nice or if I'm just finicky, but I wasn't crazy about it. I did not care for the texture. The spicy flavor of the sweet potato base was delicious and even the topping was tasty, but the nuts on top were very soft & chewy, whereas I expected them to be firm. Maybe I overcooked it or my oven was too hot. I don't know if this is the way the nuts are supposed to be...

I suspect few people have tried this recipe and that those who have might have been disappointed by it. This could be for one simple reason -- a yam is *not* a sweet potato. They are two different things.
