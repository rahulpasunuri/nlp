This is by far one of the best portobello mushroom burger recipes I've tasted. The flavor combination is wonderful. Used arugula instead of watercress. Used bottled roasted red/yellow peppers for Pepper aioli and it was great. Just had leftovers for lunch and I am sad I don't have another for tomorrow's lunch.

TERRIFIC! This is now a part of my rotation stable of recipes. I have to go to Borough Market in London to get the peppers (at Brindisa Spanish Foods) but its worth the effort. We try to do vegetarian meals at least 2-3 times per week and this recipe always brings smiles to the table! I agree with others, half the mayo is still plenty.

I've made portobello mushroom burgers before, but the red pepper aioli, garlic and smoked gouda make it much better. I served it with the roasted potato salad with grainy mustard. It was a hit with my vegetarian beau and I liked it, too.

I made 6 portobello burgers and 9 beef hamburgers for a party of a dozen people. I thought only 2 people would eat the portobello burgers (vegetarians), but at the end of dinner all of the portobellos were gone and I had beef burgers left over. Really delicious. Note: they shrink quite a bit, so don't worry if they look really enormous before cooking.

OK, the portobello burger itself is great and everything, but... Holy moly what deeeelicious aïoli! I could eat this stuff with a spoon. I made it with Veganaise and it was outstanding. I had a bunch left over and have been putting it on everything- roasted potatoes, pasta salad, eggs... it is my new favorite condiment.

These were extremely delicious! It was too rainy to fire up the grill, so we cooked the mushrooms and onions in a grill pan on the stove, and they still came out great. We used toasted slices of thick, rustic bread and substituted smoked gouda for the Spanish cheese, as suggested in the recipe. The aioli came out a little thin, but the flavoring was perfect (especially after a healthy dose of cayenne), and I found myself dunking pieces of bread into it while I was cooking. Yum! As a vegetarian, I often roll my eyes at yet another portobello "burger" offering - but this was awesome in its own right. Definitely a keeper.

These burgers were absolutely delicious. I made the recipe as written with the exception that I used one slice of good quality sliced sourdough bread instead of the roll, brushed it with olive oil, sprinkled kosher salt and pepper and a little garlic powder on it and grilled it. Then I added a little more of the aioli on top of the watercress just before serving. This would be a wonderful lunch or light dinner. I'll definitely make this one again!

The Aioli was great - this couldn't have been better.

Really excellent... even non-veggies would love this one! The smoked Gouda is essential -- the smokiness gives the mushrooms a very meat-like quality. I use Gillian's Wheat, Gluten & Diary Free French Rolls. Found in the freezer of your organic section, they're like biscuits and go really well with this recipe.

This was the best portobello burger we've tried, and it got the "oh, yum!" comment from two adult foodies who are also vegetarian. Only change made was using regular roasted peppers rather than the pricier piquillo pepper. This is definitely a keeper.

Simple and absolutely delicious. Served this over a bed of baby spinach leaves and used Pecorino Cheese vs. Smoked Gouda since it was all that was available. Make this, you'll be glad you did!

This dish is amazing, and amazingly easy. We love a good burger but try not to eat too much meat and this is a wonderful way to spice up the week's menu! The gouda is perfect. My husband wants to keep this one in the regular rotation. We followed the recipe exact and used the roasted red peppers since we had them.

Really, really good! The only change I made was I forgot about the funky peppers and ended up using a chipotle in adobo instead.. cuz it's what I had in the frig. Kickass aioli, though, and the mushrooms/gouda/watercress was awesome.

Really good. Better than any mushroom burger I've had. I used goat cheese instead of the gouda, and it worked great.

I cooked this for my girlfriend who's vegetarian but doesn't normally go for the portabello mushrooms. She loved it. Thought it was better than any restaurant she's had. I'm a meat eater and the flavour was pretty damn good. I used goat cheese instead of the smoked gouda, and it really went well with the aioli. Definitely recommend it.

ohhhh, this was SO very good. The aioli was outstanding; so good that I was licking it off my fingers when I made it. I reduced the mayo by half, otherwise made the recipe as written.
