Very odd... My husband gave up after tasting one bite. I ate the whole thing and felt weird by the end. I have to admit that my silken tofu was not the freshest, but I don't think any slight bitterness it may have had was noticeable through the soy sauce.

Easy to make and great to eat on a hot summer day. I loved the sauce. I normally am not a fan of silken tofu but this recipe might just get me to eat it.

extremely easy and yummy - nice and spicy. I added a minced garlic clove as well.

Really good for a hot night. Served with some brown rice and a drop of sesame oil. Delish.

I loved the flavor of this dish - however I did use sesame oil to fry the tofu and served it over a bed of wilted spinich.

I was really happy with this recipe. It's very refreshing and tasty, and a breeze to make. Since the tofu is raw, it is important that it's very fresh so that it retains its natural sweetness.

the silken tofu was a little unruly but served alongside brown rice, this makes for a nice light dish. i would consider making this in the future for a lunch rather than a dinner.

Fantastic, and I'm not a tofu fan! Served it on a bed of fresh spinach for an easy and light lunch.

A truly delicious recipe! I cubed the tofu and mixed the scallions and carrots in the with dressing instead of using them as a topping. This made it look really disgusting, but it tastes so good! I don't really like sesame oil, so I didn't add it. I think it would take away from the fresh taste of the salad, anyway. I never thought I'd find a recipe that could make raw tofu palatable, but this makes it delicous!

this was awesome! I took the advice of using the sesame oil and it was delicious. I also added soybeans to it for texture.It is my new favorite snack!

Light, easy, and delicious. I used pre-grated ginger in a tube which made it all the more faster.. Yummy. Would be good w/ the seasame oil and seeds atop some greens, too-

This was delicious. I used my hand held mixer to make it look more like a dip and served it with carrots and celery - everyone loved it. It is so tasty and low in calories.

This recipe was so tasty!! I added sesame oil as suggested, and also added sesame seeds. I used extra firm Tofu. I did not have any leftovers.,

Wow, why wasn't I fed this as a child? I have been missing out on this simple but delectable dish. And I didn't even have any carrots or scallions on hand. BTW, there is enough sauce for 1 lb of tofu.

I thought this was delicious, but my husband waas less than thrilled with what he called the "raw" tofu. This despite my having quartered the tofu and steamed it in a tablespoon of miso dissolved in boiling water. Next time I will cut the tofu into small cubes, steam it the same way & increase the sauce ingredients by 1/2 to wind up with more sauce for the tofu. This was a great dinner with cold sesame noodles & salad.

Very good way to use tofu...however I thought the recipe tasted even better after I "doctored" it up by adding a dash of hot red pepper flakes and some sesamae oil to the sauce.

This recipe was so easy, as well as being a nice summer-time refreshing. In fact, the dish reminded me of yofu dishes I used to eat for lunch in Tokyo. Easy and highly recommended -- it would be hard to think of a healthier easier-to-make he refreshing light lunch.

This is a wonderful light salad.
