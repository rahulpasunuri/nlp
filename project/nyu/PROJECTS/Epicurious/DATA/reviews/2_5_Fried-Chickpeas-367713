I used 1/2 the amount of oil. After cooking and adding spices I tossed in some plain mixed nuts and dried them further in a warm convection oven. The spices were plenty to flavor the mixed nuts and it made an interesting combination. We liked them

These were interesting but the spice just didn't do it for us. Plus, they lost their crunch after an hour and seemed greasy.

This recipe is addictive. Simple, easy, and delicious.... One caution: I made this twice so far, and found thatt the salt content of the canned beans vary greatly, so taste the fried product before salting, and you will be in heaven!
