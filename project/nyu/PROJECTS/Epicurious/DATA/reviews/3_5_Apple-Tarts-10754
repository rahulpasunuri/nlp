Quick and easy. These were a big hit at my dinner party last night. I made them earlier in the day and reheated for a few minutes before serving.

Also, Alton Brown does what I am almost certain is this exact recipe on his puff pastry episode of "Good Eats." ...Just thought that was interesting ...

To the cook in NH, and any subsequent, Phyllo and Puff pastry doughs are not the same thing and usually not substituted for each other. I agree phyllo is usually bland, though you could also try sprinkling seasonings/flavors of your choice between the layers also.

These were delicious and very easy to make. I made 4 tarts of about 5 inches each. I used home made plum jam for the glaze, and it gave a nice rosy color to the apples. The next time I will probably cut squares or rectangles to make more efficient use of the dough.

This is a very quick recipe, especially if you have a mandolin or food processor. I was a little skeptical of using the apricot jam, but it's very good way to add flavor without a lot of effort. My biggest recommendation is to really go light on the Phillo dough--it is of course rather bland, and the apples might not be strong enough to make it flavorful.

I made this exactly as the recipe states, served w/Sonny's vanilla ice cream and received lots of yumms. I think 7" is too large and results in leftover pastry dough. Next time I'll make more but slightly smaller tarts from the pastry sheet. Berries or peaches would be a nice alternative to apples for a summer dessert.

This recipe is so easy that even a novice cook would be successful. The tarts can be made quickly; they're pretty and delicious. I added a bit more cinnamon, a personal preference. I also make them in advance and serve them at room temperature.

I made this recipe using tartlett pans. They worked beautifully and were very easy. The only change was to bake for only 20 minutes. Watch as they are baking and prick with a fork if tarts begin to puff to much.

The beauty of these tarts was they were easy. Despite being frazzled by in-laws and the last-minute rush to get the thanksgiving food on the table, I was able to throw this together, and it worked. I like the apricot flavoring. Plus, I got my hands on some home made basil ice cream from a local restaurant and that made this dessert incredible!

I think this was a pretty good, easy recipe. Its not award winning, but satisfying and pretty.. I used gala apples and buttered the crust before putting it in the oven. I omitted the jam (couldnt find any around the house) and it was just fine. id make this again in a pinch for company.. Wonderful with haagen daaz vanilla ice cream :)

This was simple to make and delicious. Over the past couple weeks, I've made these several times for my family and everyone loves them.

These look beautiful and are really delicious! I couldn't believe the results from such a simple recipe. The time spent on a perfect arrangement of apple slices is worthwhile when you see the results.

Yum! Taste-wise this is a 3-forker, but I gave it 4 forks because it was so easy to make. I didn't bother to strain the jam, so it was even easier. I had enough dough to make a 7" and 8" tart, and I thought the 8" tart looked prettier because the dough puffed around the edges. Even the 7" tart was awfully big for just one person, though.

this was a good and simple recipe you can make; especially when you don't have a lot of time to make dessert. everyone enjoyed this light and flavorful dessert.

This turned out great! Quick, easy and good! I cut rectangles out of the puff pastry instead of circles and thought they turned out to be a more manageable size. Next time I may try drizzling the plates with raspberry sauce instead of using ice cream.

Easy and delicious. Instead of preparing the puff pastry in a circle, I instead left it in the rectangular shape straight out of the box, then arranged the apple slices along its length.

SO easy and SO good, and with just 6 ingredients!! My husband loved it.
