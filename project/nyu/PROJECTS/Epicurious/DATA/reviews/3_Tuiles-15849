We used a silpat for these, and cut our own stencils for different shapes. The batter colors really well, we made wavy shapes in lots of bright colors. You have to work very quickly if you want to curve them; they firm up fast but if you put them back in the oven for a minute, you can shape them easily.

Using the Silpat made easy work of them. Experiment with the first couple to figure out how thick to make them and how long to cook them. We made them fairly thin and shaped them long and narrow. I made three at a time. When cooked and working with one at a time, I peeled them off the mat by lifting one edge with a spatula, then pulled them the rest of the way off with my fingers. Working quickly, I them crimped and shaped them into something like a flame shape. They cooled and held their shape very quickly. They will be used to garnish a dessert.

You need to follow the directions EXACTLY! I found that even using my SilPats, only 3 tuiles fit on each baking sheet. I also found that baking them until they were golden brown on the edges made it easier to handle (10-11 minutes). They cooled only about 30 seconds before I laid them on top of inverted spice jars. This created a nice wavy cup shape for adding my mousse to. Plan to ruin a few before you get them right. Luckily the ingredients are cheap and easy to replace. I think the resting period is also very important. Don't be in a hurry when making these! Patience pays off! I also added almond extract to give them some taste otherwise they are terribly bland.

I dont see why everybody had such a problem making this recipe. A silpat baking sheet helps a whole lot. I also did not let the batter rest but only 30 minutes. I baked the cookies at 350 degrees for 9 minutes and they turned out great. I think the key to this recipe is to be really careful when you bake the cookies

This is the best tuile recipe I have found...I would suggest adding vanilla. The cookie tastes like a high quality, delicate fortune cookie, and is delicious dipped in a little bit of white chocolate. (I know, sounds weird, but it really works with these.) I make them a bit larger, drape them over a ramiken, and fill them with fruit or frozen goodies. The LA cook is right, you need some type of silicone mat...they are *much* harder to make without a silpat, and I would say a waste of ingredients and time. The silpat does help keep the cookie from over-browning. You want these golden, and slightly browning on the edges. They are only mouldable for a few moments. I have found that the warmer the batter, the more airbubbles, which creates a cookie that is hard to mould. I put the batter back in the fridge between pourings. (Course, I cater, so I don't mind the extra time for the perfect product.)

I don't see why everyone is having such a hard time with this recipie. I made it in about 10 minutes, I added a little almond and vanilla extract, and I didn't let the batter rest. Try baking it on a Silpat liner until it is all golden brown. A light colored baking sheet also helps. I shaped them into small cones and filled them with tiny scoops of peach sorbet... delicious!!

I cant get it right I think it's the recipe.

these cookies are not worth the work. If you don't make the cookie completely brown, it tastes like egg white, and if you do bake it until it turns brown then you cant roll it into a shape.
