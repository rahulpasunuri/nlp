This might not be so greasy if you use ground pork, veal and beef. Here's one that uses all three and it doesn't look greasy: http://imunchie.com/cyndib/munchies/marvelous-meatloaf

It might be less greasy if you use ground beef, pork and veal... I wonder if that would help. This is one that did and it doesn't look greasy at all: http://imunchie.com/cyndib/munchies/marvelous-meatloaf

This recipe is very good; however, I don't recommend it for the full-time working wife that comes home to cook dinner. This recipe took about two hours to prepare and cook, and the cleanup was substantial. The meatloaf also came out greasy, and gave my husband heartburn. I probably will not make this recipe again due to the time it took and mess it made. Taste: Good to delicious Ingredients: Easy to find; inexpensive Makes about 7 to 10 servings.
