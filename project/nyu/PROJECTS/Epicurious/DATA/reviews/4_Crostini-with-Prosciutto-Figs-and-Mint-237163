We made this for New Year's Eve and found the combination of flavors surprisingly bland. The figs, squashed onto the crostini, looked messy and the mint leaves just didn't blend with the other flavors. Maybe it's the peril of using out-of-season ingredients? Sorry to be the only naysayer, but we won't make this one again.

Easy and delicious. I couldn't find fresh figs so I used a fancy fig jelly. Made it again a few days later to use up the extra ingredients. A recipe that will surely impress!

I tried this recipe after seeing it was rated 4 forks but unsure about how the combination of mint, fig, and prosciutto would turn out. Wow, to me the mint was the key ingredient. Great hors d'oevre. Probably it works better with crostini, what a wonderful bread! Would definitely make it again to my guests delight~

Wow! so easy a monkey could do it and it looks totally gourmet!! You basically slap all the ingredients on some toated bread and you're good to go. I even burned my ciabatta a bit and it still got devoured. I had the same problem as other reviewers with fresh figs being out of season on Valentines day so I did half with fresh pear, and half dried figs. I think we preferred the pear, it lends itself to being laid on the bread better, looks prettier and adds a nice juiciness to an otherwise dry-ish bite. I made this with the sausage farfalle and tiramisu affogato from this site for Valentines day and it was a hit! Enjoy!

I made this as an appetizer for our anniversary and it turned out great! This was my first time using fresh figs (they are in season now). I think if I were to do this again, I would probably use dried figs or fig preserves to get more of the fig flavor though. Instead of just drizzling Balsamic on at the end, I reduced some to make a syrup. My husband who usually doesn't like a sweet/savory combination and who also doesn't really like mint LOVED this! Next time I am entertaining, I will definitly be making these again. They were simple but impressive and delicious!!!!!

This was a fantastic dish to begin our Valentines Day Dinner with. I did use a small onion/garlic baguette but other than that followed the recipe exactly. All the different flavors came together so well to make a delicious starter.

Just made this Valentine's Day. Substituted the fresh figs with fig preserves, and added extra balsalmic vinegar, and got rave reviews. Definitely 1 to make again.

I love all these ingredients on their own but was heistant how they pair together. The answer is very well! Use dried figs instead, which tatsed great and cut down on prep time. A great quick dish to impress foodie friends

How good is this for a fuss-free, yummy starter! I sliced each fig into quarters so they sat better on the crostini. The flavours of the garlic and mint just work so well. They were gone in minutes and everyone wanted the recipe!

As this recipe is part of a Valentine's day menu I have just one question - Where am I meant to find large ripe figs in February?

Delicious! The only recommendation that I can suggest is perhaps finely chopping the prosciutto and figs for easier delivery into the mouth:)

Like others, I used Bosc pears instead of figs. They provided a nice crispness in the toppings and the perfect sweetness. I toasted the bread under the broiler and went a little heavy handed on the garlic. Next time I'll understand that "gently rub" refers as much to the balancing of flavors as it does to not breaking the toasts. For me, it was still excellent, but for my kids, the garlic was too strong so they just ate the toppings and left the bread. I also apparently don't work quickly enough - especially w/ prosciutto sliced so thin it was impossible to separate - and the crostini did not stay hot through the assembly process so I kept popping it back under the broiler as I worked. Next time, I'll try having little bundles of prosciutto, pear and mint pre- stacked so I can plop them right on each toast after spreading the goat cheese. I'll also be a bit more generous than "a drop" of balsamic as it really added to medley of flavors. We had this as part of a lunch of appetizers ("little bites") and my kids are already asking me to make this again.

This was an excellent start to an excellent dinner. Because figs are not in season, I used thin slices of pear instead, and the coolness and crispness of the fruit really added a great dimension to the flavor.

This was great! Lots a flavor. A really nice change.

These were great. My guests all loved them. As several reviewers pointed out, figs are not in season in February. This being the case, I thought about what Italians might do. Since Italian food is so dependent on what is fresh in the market I tried to think of an in- season fruit that would also be good in this recipe. I considered dates, but thought they might be TOO sweet for this, and then thought Pears! So I sliced some bosc pears and used a slice on each crostino instead of the figs. My husband said, "I'm glad that figs were not in season." Perfect!

LOVED this dish... just fyi, I made this last V-day and didn't have fresh figs either, but I subbed dates and it turned out just fine. It's good with either.

Very good. Because we didn't have fresh figs for Thanksgiving (when I first made this), I used a fig spread. A little sweeter than fresh figs, but still tasty. The fresh mint definately made the dish.

This recipe was simple and delicious. One thing that I did was after slicing the figs in two was flatten the halves with my fingers and place seed side (the prettier side up). When I flattened the figs on the crostini, occasionally the bread broke in half. Also, I would definitely drizzle the balsamic and oil, as it could really benefit from the acid of the vinegar and the oil helps bring out the flavors of the figs, mint and prosciutto. This was very fresh tasting, and looks very festive and appealing. We used about half the amount of prosciutto they are recommending, but maybe it is because we used a baguette as the base not ciabatta which is a larger bread.

I loved this! Because we do not have fresh figs this time of year, I substituted 12 dried mission figs, which I poached first,then stemmed and cut them in half.I used 2 halves per crostini. Also, I used Olivers & Co. Balsamic Vinegar,which is aged and tastes raisin sweet. The symphony of flavors in this dish was absolutely divine;sweet,salty,rich and fresh. I will try this again when fresh figs are in season.

I love the dish, but Valentine's Day? The reviewer from California said he won't see figs 'til Memorial Day--I'll be lucky if I see them before September.
