This is an excellent way to prepare Cornish Hens. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made exactly as written and they came out delicious! Great flavour, just make sure to rub lots of butter under the skin on the breast and legs.

Maybe I did something wrong but I thought this to be a bit bland. I love lemon and poultry together but this just didn't do it for me.

This is a great summer grill recipe. I used chicken breasts, and made enough for a block party. They were a huge hit. I've since adapted this to substitute olive oil for the butter. It still comes out moist and delicious.

We served this dish at a candlelight patio dinner (in fact we made the entire featured menu) and they were lemony and delicious. A large platter with the grilled hens adorned with fresh rosemary makes a spectacular looking dish to serve your guests. Be sure you serve them with the Vegetable Succotash as a side dish. The best!

This is a very tasty dish. I could only find cornish game hens, and they were almost two pounds each. I increased the ingredients a tad to compensate. Very moist, tender and flavorful. Grilled zuchinni spears w/ olive oil and saffron rice go particularly well with this. We'll make this again and again...

Absolutley loved this recipe. I used free range poussins and followed the recipe to the letter,and it turned out wonderfully, much to the rave of my guests. I was surprized at the relatively short grilling time,but it turned out beautifully tender, savory and moist. A real keeper!

This was delicious. We butterflied the hens instead of cooking them whole. The herb butter mixture really permeated the meat. We are serving it to company later on this month.
