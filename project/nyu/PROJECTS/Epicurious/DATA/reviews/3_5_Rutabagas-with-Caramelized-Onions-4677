What a wonderful recipe for rutabagas! There's not a lot of recipes for rutabags. I like rutabags and usually make a carrot and rutabaga puree. I was looking for something different when I came across this recipe. Was surprised that only 3 ingredients could deliver great flavor. I halved the recipe for my husband and I, used little less butter and honey -- I really don't think the honey was necessary and will omit it next time. The carmelized onions add enough 'sweetness' to the receip. This is definitely a great use of rutabagas. Definitely will be made again. I think this is a great recipe to 'introduce' rutabagas to those who have never enjoyed the veggie.

Great flavor. Simple. Gave "recipe" to mom, haha. More like a process. Be very careful not to overcook the rutabagas.

Didn't like & won't make again. We love rutabagas. The sweet onion did not go well in our opinion.

Was pretty good, (still tastes like rutabaga, a vegetable I detest), but passed my Mother's trial for Thanksgiving this year. She is a staunch rutabaga devotee. I was surprised by the length of time called for in browning the onions, but it did actually take that long. I would make it again, simply because it tastes better to me than plain rutabaga, boiled, with butter and salt. Vile root! Not the prettiest dish, so next time I would have to think about how to garnish it, (like with a big sign that reads, "WARNING! Rutabagas here!"), or maybe some fresh, chopped parsley.

This is a fantastic recipe. So simple and even my kids love it. Be sure to allow enough time to carmelize the onion.

I found this to be a great new way to fix rutabaga. I have only had it as a puree and thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. It's a keeper and I agree with the previous post that it belongs on a holiday table, especially perfect for Thanksgiving.

This was very good, but I found one part of the directions puzzling, which was surprising since I am not a novice cook and usually the directions in Epicurious are very clear. Anyway. After boiling the rutabagas in boiling water for 20 minutes, I'm supposed to saute them in butter until warmed through. Since they've just been thoroughly cooked, aren't they already warmed through? So what I did was saute them until they got golden brown. The flavors turned out very nicely, which is more to the point.

I am not a big rutabaga fan but am trying to find new ways to use different veggies. This was amazing!! Even my 6 year old daughter loved it. I am making for our family Christmas and know everyone will love it.

I love rutabagas so frequently make them. Usually just cubed, boiled until tender, then drained and tossed with brown sugar, a dash of nutmeg or allspice, a dab of butter, and sauteed a few minutes to glaze/caramelize - I often cook parsnips the same way. Made this recipe yesterday to accompany a stuffed pork loin roast and it was truly delicious. Well worth the time it takes to caramelize the onions as the flavour is outstanding and pairs so well with the rutabagas. Because it is such a strange/funny-sounding word, I think rutabaga is often avoided by many cooks and has an undeserved bad rep for being strong tasting and bitter. Not true at all! As a previous reviewer stated, this would be an excellent initiation recipe for those who think they could never eat or enjoy the lowly rutabaga. Be prepared for a very pleasant surprise! Enjoy!

I love this recipe! It's really very simple with only 4 ingredients. The onions took almost an hour of slow cooking but were so worth it. I served this dish with pork roast, string beans and home-made cranberry sauce. The tartness of the cranberries was offset by the sweetness of the onions and slight bitter flavor of the rutabaga. Great mix of flavors. I might make this dish for Christmas along with spiral-cut ham and roast duck. Will make this again many times!

I cut the rutabaga like plank fries. Delicious with lemon ginger roast chicken from this site.

My dining companion took one bite and proclaimed it "delicious," stated with a lot of enthusiasm. I agreed, but caramelizing onions sure does take a long time, and you can't just let them sit on the heat, they need frequent stirring. Next time I'd make more onions and use the rest for other dishes during the week. The recipe's author says that rutabagas have a distinctive bitterness. I didn't find that to be the case with mine, purchased at a health food store and unwaxed, unlike those in supermarkets. Also I was surprised that they peeled and cut so easily. The texture is much like a potato. If you can't tell, this is my first rutabaga! It will definitely will have a place in our vegetable repetoire from now on, at least in the winter.

Terrific. Will consider adding to Thanksgiving or Christmas menu.

Wonderful recipe. Even the children ate it. Went over well at a dinner party I hosted. Would definitely make it again.

Excellent recipe, especially with pork. One must cook the onions until they are WELL browned, and I added salt during the process. I cut the rutabaga into 1/2 inch strips, similar to french fries...makes a clever presentation. I also added about 1 tsp. of nutmeg at the end, after mixing the onion and rutabaga. Nutmeg is commonly used in all the Scandanavian countries to spice root veg.

My husband "Brad" and I loved this however, my children Jonathan & Liz believed it was winter squash. They didn't care for it. So if you like the flavor of squash it would be wonderful. I would make it again once the nest is "empty".

My grandparents were looking for a recipe for rutabagas, and, of course, I found a great one here! Anyone who has not tried rutabagas, take it from a picky vegetable-eater-- this is the perfect "first" recipe.
