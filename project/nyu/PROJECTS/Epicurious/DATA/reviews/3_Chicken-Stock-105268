This stock was WONDERFUL. I divided the recipe in half to use 3 lbs. of frozen deli rotisserie chicken carcasses, bones, and wing tips. (So I don't think the clean stock issue applied, but I still skimmed the froth in the beginning.) For my 1/2 recipe I did use 2-1/2 qts. of cold water. This was so flavorful that it didn't need any salt, even when it was used in a recipe for Chicken and Dumplings. Will certainly make this again!!!

Better techniques available. First, take all chicken and vegetables and carmelize them by roasting in a 500 degree oven for 20 minutes. Second, using a slow cooker for the second stage, the slow simmer is much more efficient.

Nor would you add salt to the basic stock recipe, especially if you will be freezing the stock, or if you will be reducing the stock. Start the seasoning process with the recipe that the stock will be added too.

Good stock and tips in recipe, however, I would not add garlic to any stock rather, add it to your soup recipe instead. Yes, it was easy to freeze in batches.

This is a great recipe for chicken stock. I used a whole chicken instead of bones and leftovers and I didn't use pepper. I used some of the stock in my turkey dressing and I'm freezing the remaining liquid. It smells and tastes great. I'm looking forward to making chicken soup with it. Thanks.
