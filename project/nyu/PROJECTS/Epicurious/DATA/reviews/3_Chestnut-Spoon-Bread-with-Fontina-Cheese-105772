I love this recipe! I added a little more cheese, but the semolina and chestnuts make it very tasty. Fresh chestnuts are great, or, since I won't pay a fortune for jarred, Trader Joes frequently has vacuum-packed at a reasonable price.

Considering all the fat that went inot this, it really lacked flavor. Just a dense, dry-ish mess with the occassional passing taste of cheese or chestnuts. Not horrible, but I definitely won't make again.

This wasn't bad, but considering all the fat and flavor that went into it I would have expected a richer and more tasty dish. I found it ok, but bland, my boyfriend disliked it. Won't make again.

Delicious! I had no trouble with the chestnuts (left over from Christmas dinner) but could not find the semolina flour. Also did not have whole milk, but 2% worked fine, as did all purpose flour. I will make this again - would be great with a roast...

I was very excited to make this spoon bread. I bought all the ingredients and the last were the stupid roasted chestnuts. I called and looked everywhere to find them. No one carried them. So invested over $15 already to make this and now can't find one of the most important ingredients. Very frustrating. Okay, I made it anyway without the chesnuts and it was really good. The fontina cheese made it.

This was my first spoon bread recipe and it is really delightfully, delicious. I used fresh chestnuts which I roasted beforehand. No problems there, I've done this many times for just plain snacking. The fontina cheese was a delight and added to the wonderful creaminess of this recipe. It was a beautiful golden yellow coming out of the oven and didn't fall too much after it sat on the counter while awaiting the main course. Everyone I served it to loved it and I will make it again and again.

Sandy: They have jars of roasted chestnuts at Williams Sonoma. I am sure you could get them online from them or any other specialty food retailer.
