What a great recipe! Like many other reviewers I used available vegies. I think that this recipe is perfect for improvising. The dressing is good. I followed the recipe for that, but will try balsamic and basil suggested by others.

With a few changes, this recipe goes from okay to fantastic. Followed other suggestions and used part balsamic vinegar and substituted fresh basil for half of the parsley. I also added red peppers, summer squash, and eggplant. I tossed in some feta and kalamata olives just before serving. Definitely best when served at room temperature. Delicious way to use some of those extra veggies from the garden.

This recipe was good, but I feel that the smoke chips made the vegetables taste sort of like hot dogs. If I made this again, I would omit the smoke. Also added basil to the dressing and used a shallot in place of the red onion.

Tasty salad! I substituted balsamic vinegar and added feta as suggested. I also added a couple of grilled serrano chiles for heat & flavor. I also used cilantro & basil as well as parsley in the vinaigrette (~equal parts). Served with salad Caprese and some bread - guests loved it.

This was very good, definately a different pasta salad... but delicious! I added a handful of roasted pine nuts to the vinagrette. it added a lot of flavor.

I made this because I was having a party and some Vegan's were invited. They loved this dish! Every one did. I didn't use the wood chips but if you sprinkle it with smoked salt while you are grilling you can approximate the flavor.

This was really delicious. I made this for a recent family BBQ and everyone loved it. I added yellow squash as well as the zucchini. It was a big hit. I would definitely make this one again.

Really easy and yummy. Added aspargus & red bell pepper to the grill, forgot the feta and kalamatas, but didn't miss them. Took it camping and everyone loved it! I prepped it all at home and then combined ingredients once we were ready so it was fresh!

I like this recipe because it is easy and a great way to use vegetables you have on hand. I like the idea of adding olives or maybe even some capers. I will make it again.

Loved the idea of combining the grilled vegtables with pasta, but found the dressing way too bland for the pasta. Gave it a hit of sherry vinegar dressing that I had made another day & it was great. I wouldn't even bother with the pesto dressing.You could use any bottled dressing you like. I would also add some sliced olives & if you have it a little feta or stilton would also be great

tasteless? gee new jersey, i guess you could pour on a bottle of red devil sauce to kick it up...This is a delightful salad and the colours are beautiful - I also used red and brilliant orange peppers. I, too, used a bit of balsamic and it went from excellent to memorable. Thanks for all the wonderful suggestions - like having chefs in your own home!!!

I also used balsamic vinegar and fresh basil. The balsamic adds a nice kick. Use whatever veggies you want. We served the feta on the side. My wife is a sucker for grilled veggies, and isn't fond of mayonaisse-based pasta salads, so this was a big hit.

very nice summer salad. I did't have red wine vinegar so I used balsamic. Rave reviews from friends.

This is terrific. Easy to prepare and a great dish for a barbeque.I added a medium garlic clove. I found out thi first time I made it that a large clove was a little too much.

This is one of my daughter's favorite dishes. At every barbeque, it is one of her requests. It's relatively easy to prepare and can be made ahead of time which is always a plus.

I've made this twice and really like it. I like a little more vinegar and extra veggies (more zucchini, corn, and onions, plus red bell peppers...). I do find that it needs a lot of S & P, but I think it is delicious. Definitely goes great with the grilled orange-rosemary chicken.

I have made this recipe several times with the following modifications and it's fabulous! Following the proportions in the recipe: for the dressing: instead of using all red wine vinegar, use 2 parts red wine vinegar and 1 part balsamic vinegar; also instead of using all parsley, use 2 parts parsley and 1 part basil. For the salad: add a grilled red pepper and feta cheese. Also I used gemelli pasta instead of fusilli.

Very bland and tasteless

I have made this for two cookouts and it gets rave reviews each time! I haven't used the hickory chips nor have I used the food processor to blend all of the dressing ingredients. It's still wonderful!
