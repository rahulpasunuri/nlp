Excellent overall--the breasts I bought at the store were gigantic and I had to triple the marinade. Like the other reviewer, I was worried it wouldn't have enough flavor and salted & peppered them before grilling. Also, I used a meat mallet so the fillets would absorb more of the marinade. Unless you are on a low-sodium diet, I'd advise salting the veggies--which I did. Even the manly carnivores here loved this meal and I would definitely do one this again.

GREAT! Surprisingly flavorful! I wasn't trusting this recipe that the chicken would be flavorful enough so I added some salt&pepper before grilling. My husband said I should put this on the list to make at least every other week. A definite keeper for the working spouses!

This dish was perfect for a summer night. It was relatively fast and very easy. There is just nothing better than the fresh taste that this recipe brings out of the vegetables. Watch that you don't over-do the chicken, though - the vegetables may take longer than you think. YUM!
