Tasty and Quick. My group was divided on whether the peppers added much (I wasn't a fan, my girlfriend thought they added a nice contrast to the spice, but that they needed to be cooked a little longer). I did put some peppers in the rice though.

EASY and DELICIOUS! I will definitely made this again soon. Bell pepper not really needed. This is really good as a stand alone rice dish!

Would make this again for sure, but make these changes: - Double curry powder - Roast the peppers instead of blanching - Top with cheese!

Delicious. I too used broiled peppers as they're sweeter. A nice contrast of sweet pepper and cumin and raisins.

We did a little twist on this recipe. The rice was made pretty much to the plan but we did spice it up with the cayenne pepper. It made for a great spicy with a sweet taste. We have fresh zucchini in the garden now, so we made zucchini boats and stuffed the rice mixture in them. Baked until the squash was soft. Very good! We will use the rice mixture with other dinner ideas.

I made this a lot when it first appeared in Gourmet but had forgotten about it. Thanks to the reviews I like it even more now. I used dried cranberries and doubled the curry powder, cooked the rice in 1/2 water & 1/2 chicken stock. I used orange bell peppers and instead of blanching them I roasted the halves drizzled with olive oil for 20 minutes turning once and then stuffed them. I never realized that the recipe calls for it to be served at room temperature but the flavor is great that way and even better the next day! This would make a great buffet dish and it's so rustic & yummy looking too.

Very good. I just made the rice with the addition of half a diced red pepper. I used basmatic rice instead, but I think that I should have used 1-3/4 cup water instead of 1-1/2.

Delicious and easy! Had it for a main course. Cut the butter to 2 ts, added an extra ts curry powder, and chopped up the red pepper and mixed it in. Needed a bit of salt when served. Perfectly balanced! Went well with a bottle of Saracco Moscato d'Asti.

Beautiful presentation and good flavor. Can't omit the salt, though. How about replacing the 1/2 c of water with 1/2 c of chicken broth? I agree that this also would be good as a rice dish with sauteed diced red bell peppers added for color.

Used basmati rice and chopped up one red bell pepper to saute with raisins and scallions. Would use less red bell pepper next time and a bit more cayenne. (I probably shook 1/8 tsp over dish while cooking.) Would use another 1/2 tsp curry next time, too. Hubby took first bite and said that I could make any time I wanted. So...now you know I like a lot of flavor; he likes it toned down! Good stuff.

This is actually better served as a rice dish - don't bother with the peppers! We substituted 1/4 cup dried cranberries for the raisins with excellent results.

I loved it! The contrast of sweet and spicy was wonderful. The almonds added a wonderful texture to the meal. I would consider making the rice on its own in addition to a main course, say chicken or a blackened fish. Maybe even cutting up red peppers to give it a little color, adding to the sweetness of the dish.

This is easy and so delicious. It makes a very nice presentation for guests. I used Basmati rice and it was fine.

Excellent and amazingly easy. Used arborio rice in recipe and came out prefectly. Hate to use the 's' word, but definitely needed salt when served.
