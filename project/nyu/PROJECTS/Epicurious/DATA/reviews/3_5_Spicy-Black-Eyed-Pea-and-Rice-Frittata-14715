I have never had a fritata for dinner- both my husband and I loved it! and it was so healthy. I did add Red Hot hot sauce and chopped up edamame beans instead of the red pepper since I didnt have that on hand. Yumm.

Made this for my husband and me about 8 months ago for the first time, and just recently "repeated" it. We like it a lot - mostly because we are big fans of rice and have access to fresh black eyed peas from our farmers' market. A great light supper, and I think it's fairly easy to make...

I felt it was a lot of work for the outcome. Kind of like a vegetarian "Hamburger Helper." The flavors are fairly good however and you could make it in advance and serve as part of a Mexican brunch. The black-eyed peas are what attracted me to it.

Great recipe! In effort to save time, I prepared the rice, bell pepper, black-eyed peas the day before cooking. Once home from work the next day, I completed the recipe. Made that part of preparation much easier. I didn't make guacamole but agree that it would be a very nice addition.

This is fantastic. I definately recommend serving it with the guacamole. I sliced fresh avacado to serve with it but felt that guacamole would have been a better choice

I've made this recipe a few times and have been pleased with the results. I replace most of the butter with oil, and use a well seasoned cast iron skillet. Makes a great light lunch or side dish. Don't let "spicy" throw you, it's pretty mild.
