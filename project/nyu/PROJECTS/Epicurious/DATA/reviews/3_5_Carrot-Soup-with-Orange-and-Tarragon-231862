This was a nice, easy soup to make. You can do a lot with it based on preference, like many others have commented. I added ginger, as suggested by others. It gave the soup a nice kick. As well, did not have brandy on hand and substituted Grand Marnier, as it added to the orange flavour. I also used rosemary as it was all that I had on hand. Nice flavour, although I used less as it is can be an overpowering herb. Overall, very easy and tasty soup!

Unfortunately fresh tarragon isn't available here, so I added some dried while cooking the onions and some fresh thyme at the end. Very tasty.

A wonderful blend of flavors. I've played with a few recipes for carrot and orange soup and I enjoyed this the most, but I changed the proportions substantially. More butter, used a sweet onion, added a small fennel bulb with the carrot, used whole carrots peeled and chopped (baby carrots taste watery to me) and added some orange zest and more brandy. Doubled the recipe and used a mixture of vegetable stock and water. Fantastic results.

Excellent! Simple and tasty. Goes great with grilled cheese sandwiches.

Really simple & delicious! I used fresh thyme instead of tarragon, since it was in my garden and it was lovely. We really enjoyed the orange flavor coming through and I may add a bit of orange zest next time. I love this for a light summer dinner, along with a salad!

Something about these flavors together tasted really off. I think kids may like it for its strong orange flavor, but otherwise I'd skip this recipe. Much better is the carrot soup with ginger and lemon recipe on this site, which I've made for years.

Instant success. Made this for a dinner party exactly as written, and it could not have been better received. The people in the party had widely varying food tastes, too. I'm going to try the ginger next time, as some reviewers have suggested.

An instant classic. A favorite light winter dinner in our house when paired with cheddar cheese biscuits. Like other reviewers have said, you can experiment with different herbs. In the summer, we use mint and then serve the soup chilled.

I tried this and it would have been perfect except for the chicken broth, it's too much. Next time I will use 2 cups water and 1 cup chicken broth or even less, because it tasted too much like chicken. otherwise it was delicious!

This is actually 3 1/2 forks. Tarragon isn't in season, so we used dried tarragon. Also, The orange is a nice twist. We also used half a stock of fresh ginger, like reviewers said. Friends and family loved it! Rave Reviews!

I was glad to find a carrot recipe that didn't call for cream to be added. The only changes I made was adding about a 1/4 cup fresh ginger and 3 cloves of garlic to the vegetables when sauteeing. I felt the additions of these gave the soup more depth. Overall very tasty and a great addition to our Halloween dinner!

I used parsley because I didn't have tarragon, and marsala wine because I didn't have brandy, and this recipe still turned out really great. I recomment using freshly squeezed orange juice.

I added fresh ginger slices at the beginning and used free range chicken broth (didn't have any low sodium broth at the time) and then used a hand mixer to puree the soup in the pot so as not to dirty too much stuff by using a blender. Worked out great, was done with soup making in 30 minutes, and we loved it. I probably did not get as fine of a blend by using the hand mixer which meant there was still the minor carrot chunk here and there but we liked it that way. Super easy recipe and tasty. Will file this as "good for after work cooking".

This soup could not be easier nor healthier, I think, yet doesn't make you feel as though you're sacrificing taste for virtuousness! I added some fresh ginger before pureeing it and enjoyed it even more.

This soup has a very basic taste intitially, however with the citrus and additons of the ginger (about an inch), and garlic to it the flavor will expand after the first taste. A very easy to make and tasty soup.

This is such a delicious soup, and so good for you! Not only do I make this soup for my family, but I also recently made it for a friend coming home from the hospital. Such a great addition to my collection of recipes!

Personally we didn't love the orange flavor with the carrot soup. It was good but not great.

Very tasty! I didn't have tarragon so changed this recipe and used fresh sage from my garden instead. I used 2 tsp dried sage and 4 sprigs tied to infuse flavor. I also eliminated the sherry. It was absolutely wonderful. My husband raved. Am thinking of using orange zest as a garnish next time or maybe putting candied orange zest on top. mmmmmm

I found this too salty, but others said it was seasoned fine. On two occasions people ate all their soup, but no one went back for more. Something is missing. Next time I'd tinker with it.

Delicious, forgiving -I hadn't printed out the recipe and forgot the onion- and not too rich. I made one batch just for myself as I was down with flu and ended up eating it all in one sitting...

I USED FRESH CARROTS AND SAUTEED ONE LEEK, IN ADDITION TO THE ONION.OMITTED THE TARRAGON,BUT ADDED SOME GRATED GINGER, AND ABOUT 1/4 CUP DRY WHITE WINE INSTEAD OF BRANDY. USED GRATED ORANGE PEEL INSTEAD OF THE JUICE - MORE AROMA. MY GUESTS RAVED AND REQUESTED THE RECIPE. A SUCCESS EVERY TIME.

Holy moly! this was AWESOME! i definitely made it more "me." i used a whole cup of onions instead of the recommended 3/4 cup, used four cloves of garlic, and used half beef, half chicken broth. I also thought that 1/2 cup oj was too much so i used only 1/4 ... perfect! split the tarragon with thyme - add salt liberally - and you've got yourself something delicious!

Rating: 4
Lived up to my best hopes; delicate yet filling and delicious! I didn't follow the recipe to a tee (half-portion, used some water instead of a full dose of chicken stock, added a garlic clove during saute stage and some thyme at the end), but it turned out great. A new standby in my food portfolio.

This is a delicious and easy soup...but I needed to tweak it a little bit to my taste. I added chopped garlic with the onion, a bay leaf after pureeing to round out the flavours, and added half the amount of tarragon so it wasn't too over-powering. I made it for guests and they ALL asked for the recipe. Great as an appetizer...flavours are subtle but comforting. Also great for those that love creamy soups but are on a diet. Will make this many times over.

Proved to be an excellent starter. Should be served warm. Guests loved it and asked for recipe. For me, it's flavor was enhanced by the ease of preparation

I made this exactly as directed - no substitutions - and found it to be just so-so. The reviewer who likened it to baby food was right on the money. Perhaps I'm spoiled by my mother's home made soups. (She's a gifted comfort-food chef who doesn't use recipes, she just wings it!)

My dinner guest rated this 3 forks, but I'm not awarding it any. If it was good, it was because I had to do so much to make it palatable. Without my additions of more butter, brandy, cumin, hot pepper sauce and other things I can't remember off-hand, the soup would have tasted much like canned baby food. My carrots were fresh from the garden, and the other ingredients top drawer. I'm sorry I can't say great things about this recipe. I was so tired after making it, I really couldn't enjoy it! Most recipes on this site I'm able to rate 3 forks, with an occasional 4 or 2. This is the only "grumpy" review I've ever submitted. Note: I see there are many other carrot soup recipes on this site, probably many worth trying.

A nice, tasty soup, quick/easy. Since I am not a tarragon lover, I deleted it and added fresh grated ginger and cilantro instead with good results. Garnished with a dollop of sour cream, sprinkled with minced chives and fine orange zest. Don't think I will make this again though as I much prefer the Szechwan Carrot Soup also from this site - it is fantastic and simply alive with flavour. If you liked this soup, you are sure to love, love, love the Szechwan version of carrot soup! Cheers!

I made this soup and we thought it was great. Very complex flavors and very delicious. I did not have fresh tarragon so I used dried. My only regret.....not making a bunch of it! I also used a tad of tarragon flavored sour cream on top for garnish. Yummy!

With some adjustments, this would be an enjoyable soup to make again. Someone suggested adding fresh ginger and it's a great addition. Personally, we didn't like the brandy, overpowered the other flavors.

This soup could not have been simpler to prepare, even though I did not buy pre-peeled and pre-cut carrots, yet the flavor was amazing! There was a buttery flavor present in the soup and the orange juice was only slightly detectable. It was just perfect. I doubled the recipe so that I'd have leftovers, and am very glad I did! I used a hand-held blender to puree the soup while still hot. I didn't have brandy, but look forward to trying this again with it. This is also a great weeknight accompaniment to a meal since it didn't take long at all to prepare or cook.

I didn't have too high expectations for this soup, but was amazed at the depth of flvour that it had. I sauteed diced red pepper with chopped carrots (I don't trust the pre-cut stuff) and onions. Make sure you cook the mixture until the vegetables begin to carmelize. I also used one can of chicken broth + one can beef broth. The orange and tarragon and wonderful complements to this soup!

This is a very easy, very tasty soup. I used ginger instead of tarragon, wow!The ginger adds great punch and flavour. I chopped up about an inch of fresh ginger and it went in with the carrots and onions which I tossed in olive oil and roasted for about 30 minutes. Makes the carrots even sweeter.

Great recipe but we found that an orange flavored liquer such as Grand Marnier or Cointreau brings out the flavor better than brandy.

Rating: 4
Delicious. Not a big fan of Tarragon so I used a little less but found that it complemented the orange juice perfectly. I increased the recipe by half, using two cans of regular chicken groth and a pound and a half of carrots. The regular, big carrots, have a lot more flavor, as far as I'm concerned. I also used white pepper. A gourmet delight and SO easy to prepare. I'm planning to impress my friends and co-workers soon with this recipe.

I've cooked from this website for a while but this is the first time I felt strongly enough to review a recipe. This dish is fantastic. Easy, quick, and delicious! I sauteed the carrots in a little olive oil, used real cognac for the brandy, and finished it with a little butter for richness. I didn't find the orange taste too strong at all.

I have been making a recipe similar to this for many years to rave reviews. I add a twist of orange peel to the onions and carrot while sauteeing. Remove before pureeing. Intensifies the orange taste. I also add a dollop of light sour cream and a sprig of tarrogon before serving.

I only used 3 tablespoons of orange juice and upped the brandy to 3 tablespoons. Also, since I did not have fresh tarragon on hand, I used 1 teaspoon of dried (two children under age 3 will do that to you). Got rave reviews. Will absolutely make this again! To make it simplier, next time I will buy the little bitty pre peeled carrots. It did take a while to peel and chop all those carrots.

Love this recipe! So fast & easy ingredients. Definite spring & summer soup. I added olive oil on top to finish it off. Possibly couldve done without the butter and just used olive oil all together? Love the o.j. twist!

The taste of the orange juice was a little overwhelming. Next time, I'll either use a couple tablespoons or leave it out completely.
