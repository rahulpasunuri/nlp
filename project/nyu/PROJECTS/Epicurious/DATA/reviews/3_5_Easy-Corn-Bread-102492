I literally just finished making this and had to weigh in. This cornbread rocks! We spent almost two hours making Guy's Dragon Chili, so a quick and easy corn bread was in order. I used the entire can of Del Monte creamed corn..less about three teaspoons I lost down the sink. I added one Tablespoon plus a dash of honey and then just added half and half until the batter was the consistency of cake batter. I must say, it was still too dry looking without the half and half, which is why I added it plus a bit more honey. This is going to be a family favorite for sure and I can't wait to try it with some other ingredients depending on the meal. Enjoy!

Overall delicious, though a tad sweet. I wish there was a baking time recommendation because I ended up overcooking mine and it was drier than I like. I made some quick creamed corn because I didn't have any on hand (and never do), by loosely following this recipe and it worked well. http://www.food.com/recipe/creamed-corn-145165

I made this recipe today for our New Year's Day celebration. I am glad I read previous reviews as they guided me in making this recipe come out perfectly (if I do say so myself). I used white corn meal, added an entire can of creamed corn, and a bit of whole milk. My husband is still raving about this recipe. Hooray for finding the perfect recipe (with tweaking from others) on the web. I wholeheartedly recommend this recipe.

Very good,but a bit too sweet. Suggest dropping the sugar.

A tip--I had leftovers wrapped for a few days. The first day, they were fine. Then, later, when I went back, they were mushy and rancid. Not sure what caused this, but just beware. You'll be able to tell by smell/look alone if this happens, but just know it DOES happen. Otherwise, I used a whole can of corn, and it turned out delicious. My husband compared it to restaurant quality!

Definitely use a whole can of creamed corn. This is an easy recipe and the results are great.

Hey, by the way, I found this recipe as a link from a cornbread dressing / stuffing recipe. After reading the reviews about dryness, it made me wonder if it was a special purpose recipe for the stuffing? Although I am making it for the stuffing, I am still using the tips to add liquid!

I should have read the reviews before making this recipe. It was too dry to pick up.

This was delicious. I followed the advixe of previous reviewers and used a whole can of creamed corn. I also added about 1/4c of milk.

It was easy. I used fresh butter & sugar corn I remover from the husk. Then made creamed corn by just heating it. Then followed the recipe. It was good but crumbly. Next time more corn and some jalapenos.

This was an easy recipe to upgrade. Used the full can of creamed corn as suggested and also upped the sugar (I like sweet cornbread) to around 1/4 cup or so. Turned out very moist and just enough sweetness!

I've made this recipe several times, but with a few adjustments. I use a whole can of creamed corn as others have suggested, and I use maple syrup (for added flavour and moisture) instead of sugar - then I add half a red bell pepper, chopped finely, 1 tsp. crushed red chili and finally, roughly 1/2 cup water (sometimes a bit more, the texture should be similar to that of cake batter) because it just seems too dry and brittle without it. Everyone seems to enjoy it this way, myself included :)

This is so easy and good. I made one batch, tasted it and and have the next in the oven right now. I suggest you make two batches since a can of corn is enough for 2x. One for now, and one for snaking tomorrow. yummy.

Wow this was EASY and DELISH! I took reviewers' suggestions and used the full can of corn and the bread came out moist and very nice, as promised. Will absolutely make this again and again.

Oh we did it again! I'm giving this out to many scouting families. Having the dry ingredients in a zip lock bag and adding corn, eggs and butter. How simple! It can be made fresh at the end of a week of camping and everyone will be wowed (you need to make a simple box oven). Never use less than the whole can of corn, you have nothing to waste!

Nothing special, but an easy side. No question - use the whole can of corn.

Thank you previous reviewers. I am preparing this for a girl scout camp box oven cook off. Two scouts and I prepared a few recipes to see which one would be the best. This recipe won hands down for ease of preparing and minimal ingredient intensity. We followed the previous reviewers advise and put a whole can of creamed corn in the recipe, it was moist and delicious for breakfast the next morning as well! We'll be making it in a quadruple batch next weekend.

Good basic recipe. Three changes make it a four-forker: (1) use the whole can of creamed corn! Seems like we all agree on that one...(2) using Grade B (dark) maple syrup instead of sugar gives it a special, New England flavor; (3) always bake cornbread in a skillet. Otherwise it just isn't "official."

I made this at 5000 ft. in Prescott Arizona and it was perfect. I really like this recipe.

In Colorado's High altitude this fell apart into crumbs, even having added a whole can of creamed corn. Does anyone know of a fix for this problem?

I made this recipe for the second time and got better results than the first dry, crusty attempt by using a heaping cupful of creamed corn and cooking for 15 minutes instead of 20. I remember my mom's corn bread as being MUCH better, so next time I'll use her recipe. These go great with the Turkey and Pinto Bean Chili recipe. Mm Mmm!

I think we can all agree, Epicurious ought to change the ingredient from "3/4 cup" to 1 can creamed corn. I followed this advise from others, and it came out perfect. Lovely crisp edges, soft, fluffy and moist inside.

Rating: 3
I'd rate it 4 forks if the recipe itself called for an entire can of creamed corn. With the entire can, it's very moist! I also find that cooking it in a cast iron pan gives it an even better taste.

Rating: 3
This is my 'go to' recipe for basic corn bread. However, I rated it 3 forks instead of four as the quantity for the creamed corn is a little off. I followed another cook's suggestion to use a whole can and it is perfect.

Have made this several times. Kids love it. It's very moist (especially with the whole can of corn) -- even the next day.

I'm surprised everyone else loved this recipe so much. I did make mine in glass pyrex at 375 rather than 400, so maybe that was the difference? But it was crumbly and gritty and very bland...not even good enough to serve at my family dinner!

So easy and quite good. I used a full can of corn and halved the butter -- still really moist and tasty.

To each his own, but I'm a little surprised that some had bad luck with this recipe. My results were great. I served it to guests, and everyone commented on how delicious and moist the corn bread was -- definitely not that dry stuff you get in restaurants sometimes. I used a whole can of creamed corn, so maybe that made the difference. I'd definitely make this again and recommend it to others.

I made it as written and it had a very strange texture, not at all what I expect from cornbread. I will go with a not quite as easy, but not quite as weird, more standard recipe next time instead.

Would defineitely make this dish again!! Also added whole can of corn also - it's not too sweet & certainly is moist! Next time will add maple syrup & make muffins. How much easier can you get?

Very yummy and easy corn bread! We used an entire cup of creamed corn and it made the bread even moister. It is sweet, but not overly sweet and moist, but not so moist that it fell apart. Highly recommended!

Rating: 3
I have tried this recipe several times now - taking the advice to use the whole can of creamed corn. I think it comes out very nicely. Most of the other corn bread recipes I've seen use buttermilk, which isn't something I generally have, so I hate to buy a quart specially to make corn bread and have to throw out 3/4 of it. This recipe solves the problem!

Rating: 4
Very yummy, though definitely not southern or southwestern for that matter either. We always called sweet corn bread northern corn bread when I was younger. I'm not sure how this could ever end up dry unless you overbake it or use regular corn instead of creamed corn. Easy and fast to make, which is a must for me these days.

Rating: 3
My family and I thought this corn bread was great, I loved how easy it was. We did add a little extra creamed corn for moistness, since we like our bread a little more moist than most. But I think it would have been fine without it just a bit denser perhaps. There was nothing dry about this receipe. I agree with another cook that commented on being exact in your measurements when baking. It makes a difference.

I liked this one and am about to make it again. It's very simple with a great texture. I used a mini loaf baking stone pan with great results. I may increase the creamed corn and decrease the butter to make a lower fat version this time.

Rating: 3
The recipe came out just fine for me! When you bake, you have to be quite exact when you measure - that's the trick. Make sure you actually MELT the butter. I also used Del Monte Cream Style Corn - which was sweet - so the end result was a good combo of sweet/salty. Maybe next time I'll add another 1/4 cup creamed corn, to make a little more moist. I baked in a circular 8 inch spring form pan, so when I turned it out, I cut it into pointy slices. Nice for presentation. Served it with a hearty chili on a cold winter night.

I don't know why there are some vehemently negative reviews of this cornbread. It's very good, and it's a cinch to make. I grew up in the South, and this is (in my opinion) more of a Southwestern variation--but it's moist and delicious and wins rave reviews when I serve it at casual occasions.

Rating: 2
This was the driest corn bread recipe I ever made! I checked the ingredient list 3 times to make sure I included everything because the mixture was so dry. I even added some extra milk to loosen it up. Really strange since one review said how mushy it was. Anyway, this was my experience...

The outcome was awful! Not at all southern, and the hunks of corn made the bread mushy! It was altogether to sweet, and I will NEVER make it abain!

I followed the recipe as written and it was de-licious. I don't think it serves 8, maybe 4, it's that tasty. I will add a whole can of creamed corn next time as most of the reviewers have suggested. The creamed corn that I used was without salt, so I will add more salt next time. I will definitely make this again! VERY EASY!

Rating: 3
OK, so it's not perfectly southern. But it's tasty and ridiculously easy! Don't forget to cook it longer if you use a whole can (15oz) of creamed corn... try 25-30 minutes. And 4 tbsp of sugar makes it just sweet enough. You also may want to add a few spices or herbs to break the homogeneity.

I love this cornbread, and the French people I've cooked it for have been crazy about it. There's no creamed corn here, though, so I crush up some regular corn and add a couple of tablespoons of cream.

Rating: 3
Delicious! Though it is not the traditional Southern cornbread, as a northerner I find that this suits my tastes perfectly! A little sweet and definitely moist, this tastes better after it has been out of the oven for a few hours. And the fact that it is so simple to whip together is a bonus!

Rating: 3
I thought that the flavor of this recipe was wonderful. I like moist corn bread and I like it a little sweeter than the usual recipe. My husband wasn't crazy for this because of the few whole pieces of corn in the muffin from the creamed corn addition, but I thought that it was great.

Rating: 4
This recipe is awesome (with a couple changes)!!!I have been searching for a corn bread recipe that was both super moist and super easy and this has to be it. I've made a dozen corn bread recipes and this is by far the moistest and most dense. I did add a whole can (yes, the 15 oz. size) as per other suggestions and added an extra Tablespoon of sugar (I like my cornbread sweet) and baked it in a muffin tin for about 14 minutes and it was tasty. I can't understand the gripes of everyone else. I suppose it's what you expect cornbread to be like, but to me, this was perfect and will make again and again. I mean, can you honestly find a recipe any easier and more idiot proof than this one? No.

Try adding a tablespoon or so of honey with the liquid ingredients, and do use about a full cup of the corn (half the can, about). Although not Grandma's, this certainly serves it's purpose well, especially after a full day's work and time at the gym.

Although I have not tried this recipe myself I do have a comment on some of the recipe reviews that I have read: instead of simply relegating a recipe to the dust bin, I find it much more constructive to either offer a suggestion as to how the recipe might be improved or offer a recipe that you might suggest instead.

We also used a whole can of creamed corn. Received a lot of compliments on the bread. It was very moist and not dry and crumbly, which is why I don't normally like cornbread. We will make this again!

This is a nice, very basic cornbread. I made it for Thanksgiving and we all enjoyed it. Thanks to other reviewers' comments, I too added the whole can of creamed corn and it worked out well. I whipped up some honey butter and spread it on the bread as soon as it came out of the oven to enhance the flavor and moistness, which it did. This basic recipe lends itself to experimentation such as adding additional flavors (herbs, cheese, bacon, etc.) But it's nice all on its own too!

I also added more creamed corn, and I made it in a muffin pan instead. Everything came out fine, but it didn't hold a candle to my grandma's back in Mississippi. I think I will just get her recipe next time. I think hers is sweeter somehow.

I took the advice of adding the full can of corn. I also added 1 cup freshly roasted chopped hatch chiles and 1 cup of monterey jack. Wow! This is a keeper - my family loved and just afew days later they were asking me to make again!

I used the whole can of creamed corn also and baked it in my iron skillet, did not have enough butter so I used olive oil instead of butter (in the bread and to oil the skillet). Very easy and tasty. I will try butter next time to see if it would taste better. I served this with grilled pork chop marinated in adobo sauce and stewed okra.

This corn bread was delicious and very easy to make. I used a whole can of creamed corn rather than just 3/4 of a cup, which made it more moist. I have made it several times - and it has been a hit every time. Goes great with Chili.

My husband and I loved this corn bread. I left it in the oven a little longer than suggested (by accident!), and the top crisped very nicely. It was very moist and flavorful. This is such a good a recipe I think I'll experiment a bit next time and maybe add jalapeno peppers and/or some cheese. It was very easy and quite yummy!

This is both an easy and delicious recipe. I used stone-ground white cornmeal as that was what I had on hand. I also used a glass Pyrex dish for baking and lowered the oven temperature 25 degrees. Perfect! My husband, who is not a great corn bread fan, loved it. This is definitely a keeper!

This just didn't have enough flavor and it wasn't very moist. I would suggest skipping this corn bread recipe altogether.
