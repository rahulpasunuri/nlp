This is a great way to serve canned lobster meat. It is light and refreshing and it is great as a main meal or as an appetizer.

See my reviews for Lobster Salad Canapes and Lobster Salad with Spicy Lemon Dressing on this website. Lobster Salad with Glass Noodles and Jicama came in 3rd in my taste test. Go for the Lobster Salad Canapes on a bed of shredded lettuce!

I made this for friends and everyone loved it! It was delicious, simple and light. The simple dressing lets the lobster and the fresh herbs shine through. The lobster had just been caught, so that probably didn't hurt either!

The dressing was very bland. I tinkered with it to try to bring it to life. Added chili oil, sesame oil, jalepena, extra lemon. All the ingredients are great, but there is somehting missing. Maybe a green vegetable? Something in the dressing?
