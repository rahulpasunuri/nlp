This was so delicious and easy...even the homemade ice cream! Followed the recipe exactly. Made this as an alternative to pie for Thanksgiving. Will definitely hold on to this recipe.

Fantastic desert--made it for Thanksgiving last year. I used cranberries instead of raisons, and soaked them in bourbon overnight.

I did not make the ice cream, but the crumble is very interesting, and good. It's unlike any other crumble I've had, and is indeed like a shortbread. A very rich one.
