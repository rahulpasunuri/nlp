This recipe is incomplete, therefore, incorrect. First off, no saltines; rather, just use Progresso Italian breadcrumbs--the ones with the cheese in them. Also, add thyme and oregano to taste in addition to the cayenne. It's supposed to be savory. That's the way my great grandmother in New Orleans made it, and her family lived there for more than 100 years. Without the spices, it's going to be very one-dimensional and bland and you'll never want to make it again. It's also great when made with eggplant!

I was fascinated when I saw this recipe I am from Jamaica. My experiences with this vegetable (we call it Cho Cho) has not been good (issues too bland and watery to say the least). I made this for Thanksgiving and had to do it for Christmas as well. Two years in a row its a keeper..I shred it in the food processor and sauté it with butter and EVO, onion, garlic and sweet peppers. Then I drain it cook the shrimp separate; combine then bake. This year I use a streusel topping made with flour, thyme and butter. Of course I also use scotch bonnet pepper and thyme. I have to make 2 Aunty Gloria must have her own...our she shares a small portion for everyone then take the rest..Lets just say she LOVES IT!!!

1st mirliton is pronounced mill e tonh and 2nd it is a stuffing made with bread crumbs,shrimp/crab well seasoned and cooked with bell pepper,celeryand onion ( the holy trinity) and either stuffed back into the empty mirliton shells or put into a casserole top crumbed and buttered and baked. It is a mild vegetable.

I certainly didn't find this rich and savory as the recipe stated. Too much time to make for the end result... almost like a very bland hash....needed a ton of Tabasco to jazz it up.

The only other thing I would do is add some parsley for color and maybe green onions at the last minute before placing in oven. This is a very good recipe!

I confess to a happy accident with this recipe. I cubed the chayote small as another reviewer suggested and omitted the food processor step altogether. However, I neglected to read the instruction to boil the chayote before adding it to the green pepper, onion and garlic. Since I was preparing this for a supper club of 20 gay men who appreciate all the excellent restaurants here and most of whom are fine cooks themselves, I was a bit panicked. The "save" was to add 1/2 cup of water, cover the pot and steam the mixture for about 30 minutes. It softened nicely. I had to pour off some excess liquid and butter fat (not a bad thing). It got raves from everyone. I did add a bit more cayenne, liberal fresh-ground 4-pepper blend, and a dash of Tabasco. I would serve this again.

This is simple comfort food that is a perfect accompaniement to a variety of dishes, with the shrimp as a main course or without them as a side dish. Not exciting, just good!

I had to give this two forks because I just would'nt make this dish again. It was bad, it just was'nt great. The mirliton was something I had never heard of, and it was pretty good. My husband and I just don't like bell peppers. I make this dish for a party, and it was ok, just for the fact that all the other dishes were very spicy made this one seem bland.

Just a tip from someone in Cajun coutry- I don't peel the mirlitons (saves time if you don't) They also cook quicker if cut into cubes 1st.

My cooking club very much liked this dish. I used a wee bit more cayenne than was on the recipe to add a little zip. I thought the mirlitons would be mushy but it stayed sufficiently firm. Highly recommended.

I would have rated this three stars but everyone else was raving, especially my husband. I doubled the recipe, baked half for a pot luck, and the other half for a dinner party at my house the next night. It's rich enough to be a main course served with rice, or it can be a first course. I may try using tabasco instead of cayenne next time.
