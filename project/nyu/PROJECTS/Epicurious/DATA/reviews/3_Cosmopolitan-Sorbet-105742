Fabulous! I agree with others that this makes a better intermezzo than dessert. Then again, maybe we'll have adult popsicles come summer! I found the tart/sweetness to be balanced as written. Leaving out the vodka to aid in freezing was a good tip, and next time I won't add the orange liqueur until the sorbet is nearly frozen. I might try steeping the cranberry puree with a sprig of rosemary. My guests and I thought this was fun, and I'll definitely be making it again.

This was good--tart! I think it would make a better intermezzo than dessert. And, certainly, Thanksgiving would be the perfect occasion. This takes a while to freeze, as others mentioned, so you may want to make it at least a day in advance. Also, I chilled the cranberry juice overnight in the refridgerator before I made the sorbet. As a result, the pectin formed a solid layer on top of the juice that needed to be broken up before going into the ice cream maker. Keep that in mind if you decide to refridgerate this for a while.

I am puzzled by the recommendation for less sugar by other reviewers. I reduced the sugar by 1/2 c and it was way too bitter. Even after replacing the sugar (plus some!) it was so bitter that I can't eat it without making a face. Perhaps I pushed too much pulp through the sieve.

This was wonderful for an intermezzo.

I too decreased the sugar, to about 1.5 cups. I don't think it should be any sweeter. Overall, I found this a bit plain, in contrast to the cranberry-orange thyme sorbet (also from Epicurious), which had too strong a thyme flavor. But I've discovered that pureeing the mixture prior to straining it produces a creamier texture. Next time I'd like to add in some more flavor, possibly more lime juice or something orange. Granted, that might be my fault since I didn't have an orange liqueur on hand, and didn't think of throwing in some OJ at the time.

Wow! What a beautiful, light, refreshing dessert! Everyone loved it, however, next time I make it, I will not add quite as much sugar. It was a bit too sweet for me. I followed some of the previous reviewers suggestions, don't add vodka until the sorbet is almost frozen. Very important, it DOES take quite a while to complete freezing after the vodka is added. I served it in the martini glass as suggested, with a splash of vodka in the bottom, and also put a halved pirouette chocolate filled cookie in each glass. It was delicious, AND beautiful.

For adults only....I left out the vodka and made the sorbet with the rest of the ingredients, and it froze very well. To serve, I scooped sorbet into martini glasses then added 1/2 oz. of vodka to each glass, garnished with mint sprig. It was FABULOUS! My guests ate the sorbet then drank the rest...very cosmopolitan!

Everyone in my family loved this! The color and cranberry flavor are equally rich. It is a beautiful sorbet which adds great color and elegance to a Thanksgiving (or any) meal. Served in beautiful martini glasses really adds a nice touch to the table.

I served this at Christmas Eve dinner and it was so refreshing! The color was beautiful and I garnished it with a fresh mint leave and it really looked and tasted delicious. Be warned...because of the alcohol in this it needs to be in the freezer for at least two days to harden. It still is soft when you serve it so don't expect an ice cream consistency. I have made this twice now since and the results have been the same.

My first batch did not freeze either. Then I remembered that vodka doesn't freeze. The second batch I left the vodka out until the last few minutes in the ice cream maker. By then I had a good start of a sorbet going and adding the vodka did not stop, or hinder the freezing process.

Gorgeous Holiday color! I would use less sugar (to taste) and allow at least overnight to chill before freezing. Makes a very impressive pallet cleanser before dessert!!!

I tried this recipe and the sorbet did not freeze. The mixture tasted delicous however.
