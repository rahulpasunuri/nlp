Delicious. I gave half to my friend because having that whole cake in my refrigerator was torturous; I couldn't keep my fork out of it for more than 5 minutes! NOTE: To me, it did not taste like cheesecake but more like a chiffon pie--just not as airy.

This is an easy recipe and absolutely delicious! I am a nurse and made this for staff at work and got rave reviews!

This is very good. It doesn't have the consistency of a baked cheesecake, but it is a nice summer dessert. If I make this again, I will decrease the amount of butter in the crust. I made extra crust, increasing all amounts accordingly, to go higher up the sides of the dessert, but after baking 12 minutes, my crust all slid down to the bottom and was very greasy. I used a measuring cup to press the crust back up the sides and returned it to the oven for two extra minutes. In the end, the crust was nicely browned, but hard as a brick. My coworkers loved it, though and several asked for the recipe.

best cheesecake ever, easy to make, delicious and last for 3 days...a huge hit.

This recipe is awesome and always gets rave reviews from guests. No, the crust doesn't get soggy, but if you want to make sure it doesn't, just brush it with 1 lightly wisked egg yolk before baking. That seals it. Also - suggest using Stabilized Whipped Cream instead of the whipped cream as described. You can do it in the morning, have the finished pie set for the day, and serve it at night beautifully intact. The Whipped Cream will never self destruct. Just Google Stabilized Whipped Cream and there are lots of recipes for it. Last - this definitely is NOT a cheesecake, it's very light. But decadently good.

Made this for an event at my work and it was well received. Shouldn't really be called a cheesecake, but is a nice desert. Looked beautiful, was easy to make, and tasted good. I cut down on the sugar a bit, and made a little extra crust to go further up the sides (as recommended below).

Fabulous! Great reviews from guesta. It was even better the next day as with all cheesecakes. Only suggestion, make sure you make your crust up the sides of the pan quite high, that is the only "support" the cake will have when you remove from pan. This could be made with other kinds of fruit and certainly with low cal creamcheese etc.

Easy to make and always gets rave reviews. Substitute light cream cheese and omit whipped cream topping & is still delicious. Much lighter than traditional cheesecake so ideal after substantial entree.

This dessert was super easy to make. But the flavor was lacking that cheescake flavor. Maybe at 2 8oz cream cheeses. The blueberry topping was great, dont skip that part. Maybe add some blueberry preserve to the filling to give it more blueberry taste. Some people really liked and others left it on their plates.

This is a fantastic dessert, notwithstanding it is not a traditional cheesecake. I followed the recipe as written, except I used blueberry preserves instead of jam, and it seemed to make little difference. This dessert received rave reviews and I will certainly make it again.

I didn't care for the gelatin consistency of the cheesecake, I prefer the baked version. I didn't use the sauce on top, just arranged the berries on top and used cool whip because I was in a hurry. I probably won't make again but it was very impressive looking on the dessert table for my fourth of July picnic. I garnished with fresh mint leaves.

Rating: 3
Perfect summer dessert served chilled, and looked absolutely amazing with the glazed berries on top (I omitted the whipped cream topping). Only problem was that the centre didn't set properly so it fell apart after slicing. Next time I'll try more gelatine (perhaps English gelatine is different?)

Very, very good. Usually husband and I don't like the same things but both agree this is great. Feels light on the tongue and not as dense as baked cheesecakes. Rolling the fresh berries in melted jelly makes even less than ripe fruit taste sweet. Loved everything about it.

Apparently, cheesecakes in the US are not exactly like this one. Don't care at all about that, given the results and that cheesecake isn't "national dessert" here. The 4 forks go bcause of thow good it looked and tasted while it was so incredibly easy to make. Made with other berries and even with a mixture of them when didn't have enough of one kind available. Always great, not too jelly-ish in my case.

This recipe turned out very well and looked lovely. My only problem was that it was a little too soft when I served it. This was the first time I've used gelatin, and I don't know if I used too little, or if I should have left the cake in the fridge until just before serving (it was at room temp for a couple of hours before). Any tips?

I tried this for my 4th of July dessert. It was delicious! Actually, it was more than that. Awesomely, crazily DELICIOUS!! I made it with non-dairy cream cheese and I finally found a non-dairy whipped cream like the Reddi Whip. I would definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
This was delicious. I agree with the person who said it would be better to cut the amount of blueberries in the filling; it does taste better before you add them. I also skipped the jam and was happy with the result. It definitely needs to be chilled for several hours, I took it out too early, and although it was delicious anyway, it wouldn't hold its shape.

Rating: 4
I made this as in the recipe for a barbecue and everyone loved it. I didn't bother with the jam, just piled on fresh blueberries. While it is lighter than an American (baked) cheesecake it is very much like the ones we make in UK, although they tend to be made with fromage frais which I haven't been able to find here in Canada. When I make it again, I would include some lemon zest as well as the juice.

Everyone seemed to really enjoy this. The crust was great, as was the topping. The filling was pretty good, I tasted it before adding the blueberries and actually thought it tasted better before the addition, it was still good after, it just didn't taste as cheese- cakey. Next time I will omit, or at least greatly reduce the amount, the blue berries from the filling, but follow the rest of the recipe as written. I noticed some reviewers said the gelatin made the texture of the filling similar to jello, well, I used the full tablespoon and my filling came out perfectly, perhaps those that had a problem added too much?

Made this for Easter dinner and it was a nice light finish to dinner (although, it is certainly not light). Because of the season I used strawberries instead of blueberries, and it was great! Everyone loved it, and even my husband who is a huge cheesecake fan, thought it was one of the best!

incredibly easy, pretty to look at, and delicious to taste. the hardest thing about making this cake was waiting for it to set overnight! i didn't bother with the whipped cream; felt as if the dish was already fattening enough, but the blueberry topping was bright and fresh tasting. i also added a little lemon zest as a garnish on top of the cake and a dash of cinnamon and cardamom in the crust. it even impressed my mother, who is a cheesecake queen!

This was perfect for our hot August night!! my in-laws took home the recipe which I modified by using fat free 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the heavy cream. I also only topped each slice w/ only the blueberries coated with the jam. Superb! Great crust. Great texture. Great!

The guests at my dinner party last night were positively moaning over this treat. I used 1 cup of pre-made graham cracker crumbs in place of the graham crackers and the proportion seemed right. I suggest beating the whipped cream topping to near butter consistancy as when I topped it with the blueberries I had sort of a whipped cream avalanche. This was so light tasting and really wonderful. Will definitely be making this again.

Easy and looks impressive!

So VERY good. Big crowd pleaser even with those who didn't like cheesecake. Fairly easy to make and great to follow a heavy meal since it seems light. I didn't have blueberry jam, so I used raspberry, heated it, and strained the seeds. Didn't taste like rasp. but gave a wonderful sweetness and gloss.

Very good and light! Well, light tasting anyways; it tastes light but isn't light in calories, which can result in a tire around your tummy...however, this is delicious. Everything works together and it is quite easy. I crushed the cookies by hand because my blender took issue with them (it isn't really a food processor) but it handled the berry mixture fine. The recipe for the crust could be used for any cheesecake as it is a very good one.

Last night I made a different cheesecake other than this one. It was a "real cheesecake" as they say. This one calls for less ingrediants as far as creamed cheese, sour cream, eggs, etc. go but it is so light and delicious and beautiful. I will go back to this one. It's not your typical cheesecake but it's very delicious and beautiful and I prefer it to the "real" kind.

I've made this cake 3-4 times now and it's always a hit. Yesterday, however, it melted a bit in the fridge and I think it was because the blueberry topping was still a little too warm and started melting the whipped cream a bit. My advice is to make sure the topping is cool before mounding it on top of the whipped cream.

I recently made this cake for a potluck. There was not one bite left. I am not much of a baker, but the recipe is simple--almost fool-proof. The finished product looks fabulous and tastes great. The only down side is almost not worth mentioning. The potluck was outdoors on a hot summer day, and the consistency of the cake got a little gloppy after a couple of hours in the heat. When it was right out the fridge, however, it was wonderful and smooth and not overly-gelatinous the way some no-bake cheesecakes are. Without question, I will make this again--perhaps even several times before blueberry season is over!

I love this recipe and always get excellent comments. Friends ask me to make it all the time even when it is out of season!

I am hardly an experienced cheesecake maker, but, holey guacamole! This was unbelievable tasting and easy (if time consuming) to make.

I really liked this cheesecake, yet next time I'd probably omit the oats and just use the graham crackers. Also, I wasn't really impressed with the whipped topping, but would take a box of Jiffy white frosting mix, mix it in with 2 cups of heavy whipping cream until stiff peaks, and then spread it on as the topping. It will be a little more richer but a lot tastier!

To cook from Pasadena, you can put the graham crackers in a sealable plastic bag and crush them with a rolling pin then combine the other dry ingredients in a bowl, mix and drizzle in the melted butter while stirring. It may take longer to crush the crackers to a fine texture; but cheesecakes were made prior to the invention of the food processor. You can say you truly made it the old fashioned way! Happy cooking.

Yum! The perfect end to a summer evening. The crust received kudos too. I served each piece with a small scoop of lemon sorbet for a little tartness, color, and additional "coolness". It was a nice touch although the recipe stands on its own. I know I will make this again and again.

Even when my desserts look beautiful, they never look like the photo except this one! It is very lovely and also delicious.

I only used about half the number of berries on top because they were going to roll all over when I cut it, but it was amply covered and not at all stingy. Also, I just tossed them in some raspberry syrup and a splash of blackberry liquer that I had to make them glossy instead of buying special jam. Easy!
