Wow this is good. The flavor is really addicting -- nice tang from the sherry vinegar. I did add a red jalapeno to the herbs. I reduced the olive oil to 1/3 C and reduced the butter to 3 TB. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and after adding the butter I returned the sauce to the blender for another quick whirl which took care of the separation issue. The sauce would be great for a variety of meats.

This is really terrific. I did cut the oil and back to more like 2:1 and also used a butter/olive oil blend, and I didn't count the garlic. It is absolutely the BEST chmichurri sauce ever. For the cooks who thought it looked oily - next time, after you combine everything including the melted butter, and while the butter is still liquid, put the sauce back in the mini-processor and whir again. This will emulsify the butter and oil combination, which will stay blended for quite a while. It works with every butter sauce I have done it with. Also, I didn't have the righ wood chips, so just used cedar, which was perfectly fine.

This was a wonderful recipe! The meat was very tasty, tender and inexpensive. The Chimichurri sauce was a bit oily but very tasty. Next time I will cut back the olive oil to 3/4 cups vs a cup. Definitely a keeper!

I need a little help with this recipe. My sauce didn't turn out looking like the pic at all. I followed the recipe to the letter. The sauce tasted awesome, but looked greasy as all get out. my husband was a little grossed out by this. I think one of my mistakes was to over cook the sauce, turning my sauce a dark green instead of the lovely vibrant green shown in the pic. I think what I really need to know is how to get the sauce to stay mixed. i would appreciate any tips.

I have spent a large part of my life in Argentina as my father is from there and my parents live there. Perhaps the previous reviewer doesn't have as many Argentine sources for his/her chimichurri recipe. Actually, chimichurri usually has a base of garlic, oil, parsley (or less commonly cilantro), ají molido (crushed sweet red pepper), salt, black pepper and vinegar (or lemon juice, note that some people don't use an acid at all). Often included are bay leaf, oregano, paprika, or onion. However, tarragon is NOT a common ingredient although of course there is nothing wrong with using it as the variations on this recipe are nearly endless. The quantity of garlic in this recipe is appropriately authentic. It seems the cook from Altadena just doesn't like chimichurri with the normal amount of garlic.

Chimichurri is a dipping sauce I learned to make from Argentine friends. It's not just for meats. Try it with quesadillas, too. I've had it served in several Argentine restaurants around the world (well, Western Hemisphere) and have never found it without TARRAGON. None of the recipes here call for tarragon. Que pasa? Without it, it is just another garlic & olive oil mixture without that signature taste. Fans of Carnes Parrilladas de Argentina, you know what I mean!

Flat irons are always an excellent grilling steak. The garlic was superb, and I'm not sure how you could possibly have too much!

This is a great recipe, love the garlic. I added a japaleno to the sauce and made shish kabobs. De-lish-ous

This is not a chimmichuri sauce. It is a toxic garlic puree. How can you put 15 raw cloves of garlic into a sauce that yields 6 servings and not expect to ONLY taste garlic? I should have known better because I normally improvise, but this time I followed through. Find another recipe. Two cloves would have been adequite. P.S. I really love garlic.
