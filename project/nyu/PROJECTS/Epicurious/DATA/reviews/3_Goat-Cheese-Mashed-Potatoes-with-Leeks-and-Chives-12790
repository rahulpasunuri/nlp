I skipped the baking for 20 minutes. They came out excellent - definitely a keeper for future dinners.

That last review cannot remain at the top! This is one of our favourite recipes. I have shared copies with friends and family and get requests for it at pot luck and buffets. I have adjusted the varied the "onion" ingredients several times depending on what I had to hand, with no ill effects. Perhaps it is a question of personal taste. For me, however, a make ahead recipe that everyone in my world likes has got to be a winner.

I'm sorry, but this dish was terrible! The onions and chives overpowered the dish and the potatoes were on the dry side. We followed the recipe to the letter. We have tried other recipes from this site with great success, but this was just nasty.

I made this dish ahead, refrigerated them and then baked until hot and it was wonderful. Definitely rice the potatoes, it gives them a light fluffy texture. In previous reviews some thought it was too much goat cheese and some too little. I guess I'm baby bear -- it was just right!

I made this recipe for Easter and the flavor is great. The color was a little off after adding the sauted onions and leeks. I did not rice or bake the potatoes. The "mashed" outcome was pasty. I'm not sure why but it didn't effect the flavor.

I made this dish the night before (as the dinner party was directly after work) and it was still excellent. A great take on regular mashed potatoes, although the next time I will use more goat's cheese than the recipe requires.

Very good mashed potato recipe. Would recommend taking some of the goat cheese out...even for goat cheese lovers, it's a bit too much, especially for the big T-giiving feast. We used 1/2 regular goat cheese and 1/2 low-fat (both Coach Farm). Also recommend baking the potatoes (don't peel) and then ricing them...they turn out fluffier and it's easier than peeling, dicing, and boiling. Throw in a few pieces of the skins (they come off when ricing) for a rustic touch.
