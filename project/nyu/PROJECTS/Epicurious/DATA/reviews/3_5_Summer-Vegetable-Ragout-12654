I wish I found this recipe years ago! I did not have baby zucchinis but diced 4 mediums, 1 crook neck yellow squash, and julienned a medium patty pan squash. I substituted 1/2 red onion, diced for the scallions. For the corn and a little twist I drained and chopped some chinese baby corn. Followed the directions and came out awesome. Tasted even better the following day. Highly recommended!

This dish was amazingly simple and delicious! After eating it, I reread the recipe several times looking for some "magic" ingredient that made this dish so delicious. It's just so simple and only has nutritious wholesome ingredients, but it tastes sooooooooooo good! The left overs were even better!

This has so many possibilities - I used shallots and a half an onion along with the garlic, and used only wine instead of broth. I also added toasted sesame seeds at the end to give it a little crunch. Delicious!

This dish is similiar to ratatouille, however, with much less work and prep time. Like ratatouille, this recipe can handle a number of variations based on what you might have on hand in the fridge or garden. I didn't have any corn, but I added two cubanelle peppers with the squash and a few baby bella mushrooms and a chopped up half of a hot pepper I had in the fridge. I also substituted white wine instead of the stock (let it evaporate instead of covering the pan -- the tomatoes will add enough liquid). Finally, mixed some fresh basil in with the tarragon.

The perfect summertime accompaniment to grilled or broiled white trout. I used basil and added a splash of white wine with the chicken stock. It's not a fancy dish, but it definitely has its place.

Overall, this was a very tasty dish, but next time I will make it without tarragon. The taste was too strong for the vegetables, and did not harmonize with them. I may use fresh basil in place of the tarragon.
