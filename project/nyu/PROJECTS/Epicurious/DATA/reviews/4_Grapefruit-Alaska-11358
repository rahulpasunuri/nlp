I made this recipe to finish off our New Year's Eve dinner and it was perfect. Next time I would cut down on the amount of meringue prepared, because even though I 'loaded up' the grapefruit with the meringue, there was a lot left over. I think 3 egg whites for 4 grapefruit halves would have been plenty. Also, watch the cooking time carefully--after 5 minutes it was done; at 8-10 minutes it would have burned.

It was interesting. My husband and I are NOT fans of grapefruit at all. It sort of helped. I can see how a "grapefruit person" would love it though!

Simple to make, nice light taste. Definitely will make again.

This is a very good lite dessert. I understand that President Thomas Jefferson was the person who introduced this recipe. Source:Lorna Williams, Sr. Editor of Maryland Magazine Jan/Feb 97
