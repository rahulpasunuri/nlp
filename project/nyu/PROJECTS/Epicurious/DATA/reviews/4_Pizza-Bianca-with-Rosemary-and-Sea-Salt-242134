This was great! I used a Boboli thin crust, dried rosemary and sea salt in a grinder. Baked it @350 for longer then stated, 10-12 mins maybe..? I like it a lil more done. I had a chunk of feta so i tried crumbling some on half of it and loved it! The plain was excellent as well. Served it with some pasta and a salad with balsamic :)

Delicious as a cracker for spreads and cheese, but be sure to make the pizza very thin. Easy on the salt.

Definitely use big coarse sea salt for the crunch and to make certain it's not overly salty.

I used fresh dough...this was easily the best pizza I have ever made. An easy launching point, too, for additions.

This was good, but I used too much sea salt - I find it very hard to get sea salt right. So the final product was too salty for us. We scraped off a lot of the salt, but lost a lot of the rosemary in the process. We enjoyed this with cheese, hard sausage and a baby greens salad. I will try it again with MUCH less salt.

So simple and so good - disappeared in no time! I pre- baked my fresh pizza crust in the oven and finished on the grill.
