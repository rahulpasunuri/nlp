Way too many eggs, come on now, 10 eggs.. this recipe is not for me. Besides, I like a lemon pie with two crust, and no merengue

The flavors are so rich. The creaminess and tartness are in balance. Truly a wonderful end to a grand dinner.

Made this for Thanksgiving and my feeling was that the filling was not enough for 2 - 9 in. pies. I poured it all into one crust but then it had to bake much longer and started to seperate. The crust got a little too tough as well. The filling is quite tart and many guests commented that is was verging on being too sour.

I used my own crust recipe, so I am only rating the filling - which was delicious! Very lemony and not too sweet...I used half the recipe since I only wanted to make one pie. The halved amount of filling might be even better in a 9" tart crust - I may try that next time. A good dessert to make the night before, as it needs to be served very cold.

A fantastic recipe! Has become a favorite with family and friends. Watch the crust carefully...it tends to brown very quickly.
