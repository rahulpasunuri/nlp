OMG this dish is really good! I put it all together about 7 hours ago, left it on the counter, covered, to get 'happy' and tried a spoonful just now. Bliss.

What a terrific summertime chutney! We used fresh sour cherries from the farmer's market, along with peaches and plums. Can't wait to try this with pork chops tonight...if there's any left from all of my "taste testing!"

Didn't have white balsamic vinegar so I substituted raspberry vinegar and omitted the sugar. It was delicious!

My fruits were diced and I didn't use the fruits in the original recipe as they are impossible to find in good quality here. Instead, I used mango and lychee, rice wine vinegar, bruised kaffir lime leaf and lemongrass and 1 small thai chili, seeded. Served it with seared tuna. If I ever find the original fruits that are ripe, I would love to try it again.

This is great. I used peaches, plums and cherries. I didn't have white balsamic vinegar so I used ordinary. I also added half a teaspoon of ginger to the mixture which added a bit more spicy taste. After about an hour of the mixture standing in the fridge I had to have a taste and couldn't stop eating this by the spoonful. I will be making this lots now as it is really great!

I used plums, apricots & nectarines, and I happened to have Pomegranate vinegar on hand, which gave it an interesting kick. However, i added a bit too much vinegar. I think by using just under the vinegar asked for it would have been better, but i can definitely see it going as a topping on a sponge or angelfood cake. And i LOVE garam masala...don't be shy with it!

I love it when someone reviews a recipe with 4 forks and then basically changes the entire recipe. Too funny! This recipe is a fine base. I made it as written but ramped up the garam masala and added a touch of cumin and salt. I canned this in 8oz. mason jars and hope the flavors meld together as time goes by.

YUM! I took the concept and used mango and apricots, touch of fresh grated ginger, few pieces of dried tropical fruit, balsamic vinegar and twice as much sugar as vinegar. Wonderful! Can eat by the spoonful or put on ice cream / cake.

You lost me on quartering cherries. I'm not really an epicurean, but I love reading the recipes.

I do this with plums and peaches or nectarines. I, myself, hate apricots. A splash of balsamic vinegar is great with this too. Make sure you have plenty of sugar to get the fruit juices going, especially if they are on the less ripe side.
