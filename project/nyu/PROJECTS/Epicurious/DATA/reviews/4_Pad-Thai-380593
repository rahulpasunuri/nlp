Great recipe. Easiest and best pad thai recipe I've tried. Didn't have the radish or tofu, subbed dried chili flakes for the Thai chilies and subbed chives and small shallot (sliced thinly) for the garlic chive

What happened?? Too much sauce, too sour. Not what I was hoping for at all.

Made this dish as written minus the radish and it was fantastic ! It was as good or better than my fav Thai place. I will put this in my regular rotation !

Delicious. Next time I would add more chili (perhaps fresh chilies?). But it was a definite crowd favorite!

Emblematic of the Bon Appetit recipe, this turns out great the first time around! This is my new ¨go to¨ Asian dish...easy, delicious, genuine. I didnt find sweet preserved shredded radish so I substituted pickled ginger. Break it down into 5 steps: 1. Prep all ingredients, 2. soak noodles 3. start sauce in wok or big pan 4. toss in the noodles 5.serve and season with additional fish sauce, roasted peanuts, and chives.

Excellent! I would recommend adding more shrimp.

After finding all of the ingredients, this was a very tasty, easy recipe.

This dish was not only easy to make but quick once the noodles soaked. I added cilantro to my dish because that is how I have had Pad Thai in the past and it was great. I also added shrimp. My family loved it considering they dont have very adventurous palettes.
