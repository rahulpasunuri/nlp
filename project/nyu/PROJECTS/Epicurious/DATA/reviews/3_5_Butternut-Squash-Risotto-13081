I've made this recipe EVERY Christmas and Thanksgiving since I first got the issue in 1995...it is truly amazing ! Make sure you at least quadruple the garlic and ginger and the dice for the squash can be bigger. Enjoy !!

Oh my sweet baby Jesus. I made this recipe doubled, with a rather small squash (1.5 lb), upped the garlic, and skipped the ginger and chives. I roasted the squash in 3/4" dice and just mixed it halfway through brothing. I added 1/2 c parmesan cheese and 3 tsp chopped fresh sage at the end. Also it needed more salt at the end. But, boy, by then it was amazing. More amazing than any restaurant risotto I've ever tried. I think I'm in love...

I make this almost every year for Thanksgiving, because my family requests it. They love it, I love it, it's awesome. The recipe varies depending on how you cook the butternut squash. Definitely bake it in the oven, with a little olive oil, salt and pepper. Maybe even the lightest hint of nutmeg. I leave out the ginger, even though I love ginger, but not in this dish. The Parmesan and chives are important, don't skip them!

I've made a lot of butternut squash risottos over the years, and this one is the most flavorful. I made it exactly as the recipe (which I almost never do) and the addition of the ginger to a typical combination just makes the dish.

Fantastic The ginger and butternut squash are wonderful with the texture of the risotto.

I decided to double the recipe so it could be served as an entree. As I finished the last of the broth, the flavor still needed a bit of a kick--I used 1/2 a teaspoon of Thyme and loaded the warm dish with parmesean to make sure that it had a salty well-bodied flavor.

I absolutely love this risotto and have been making it for years. The combination of ginger, garlic, onions, and squash is divine as far as I'm concerned. I don't heat the water and broth separately and I've never had an issue with it not turning out properly.

Excellent! Just roasted halved squash in oven then peeld and diced to keep it simple. As suggested increased ginger & garlic, just a bit. Mixture is very wet compoared to other risottos, but the flavor is yum.

I must agree with all the other reviewers who said this is a delicious, easy, and relatively healthy recipe. It's even easier if you, as some previous reviewers said, use squash that's already peeled and cut up. I subbed powdered ginger as I was out of fresh, and it was fine. Definitely a keeper!

We really enjoyed this dish. I doubled it and used shallots, more garlic & ginger. I had way too much squash to I saved some for something else. I added some maple syrup at the end. Served with a pork tenderloin with a maple syrup glaze & wilted escarole. Great winter meal.

This is a really good recipe - good texture and flavor. Seemed to lack some flavor, and next time will add some parmesan regiano cheese at the end to add some saltiness. Also will add more garlic next time I make this. Will try this again with some changes.

This was a great risotto recipe. I don't care for ginger, so I omitted that, and I doubled the recipe so I would have leftovers. The arborio seemed a little chalky at the end, even thought I added extra liquid, but overall really tasty. And I loved the way the squash was incorporated. I will definitely make it again.

Not only is this the best risotto I have ever made, it is by far, the best risotto I have ever eaten. Wow.

Seriously, this risotto is heaven in a bowl.

This recipe is a keeper. Fantastic the night I served it, and even tasted great left over. The ginger is what makes this recipe. I added a bit more garlic and ginger than the recipe called for. I also added some grated parmesan at the end of the cooking - but still used the curls before serving. YUMMY. You will not regret making this.

I played around with this and another well-reviewed squash risotto (with blue cheese on top) and decided that the ginger in this one really makes the dish. I added some fresh spinach near the end (as does the other one) and the dark green adds a nice touch. Obviously, a touch of butter at the end doesn't hurt either! Also thought roasting the squash (which can be done well in advance) added to the flavor. All in all, excellent, but you must use the ginger.

I found this recipe while looking for a healthier alternative to the Barefoot Contessa's butternut squash risotto. I was super impressed. It was easy and delicious. It did take more than 45 minutes, maybe because I doubled the recipe. I roughly diced and roasted the entire squash. I didn't have ginger and am not sure I missed it. Didn't even need to add cheese. It was so good as it was. And half the calories of Contessa's version!I served this with steamed artichokes.

My husband made this risotto with squash from our local CSA. We are big fans of the "Wild Mushroom Risotto" and "Champagne Risotto with Scallops" from this site. To my surprise, this was the best risotto he's ever made. We doubled it up, and substituted fresh parsley for the chives - otherwise as written. The two textures of squash seemed like a strange idea until we were eating it. Wonderful! I savored every bite.

Really tasty risotto, gorgeous color. I used Madeira instead of dry white. Also used frozen cooked winter squash from store to avoid hassle of peeling fresh squash.

I would definately just nuke the squash and puree it all to put in the risotto. The flavor was very good, and I agree that the more fresh ginger the better, but the whole squash "ordeal" was totally unnecessary.

I always forget how much I love butternut squash. This recipe reminded me. I do think next time I would add a little more salt. Also I think I would like even more contrast to the texture of the two squashes. I think next time I will puree the whole roasted squash to make it creamier and then add the cubes at the last minute.

Excellent, flavorful recipe. I will up the amount of fresh ginger next time: would have liked it to be a little more pronounced. I added roasted cubes at end of cooking period so that they didn't mush up. I doubled to serve to party of six with pork tenderloin entree. Everyone raved, but the original recipe would have served six as a side. The quantity of two shown in the recipe must apply if you serve the risotto as a main entree. This recipe is definitely a keeper, and a great idea for a main course vegetarian dish.

Rating: 3
One of my favorites - have made it several times with various alterations. I always use extra ginger and garlic, and add lots of fresh grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. I find peeling raw squash to be challenging, so I use the following system: halve squash lengthwise, remove seeds, brush cut sides with olive oil, season w/ S&P. Place cut side down in baking dish filled with 0.25 inches water, and bake at 450 for ~20 min. Remove squash from pan and let cool slightly. Cut the straight, elongated parts away from the bulbous parts. Then it's really easy to cut the skin off the elongated parts and dice the pulp. The bulb flesh can be scooped out of the skins w/ a spoon and chopped coursely. Makes a great recipe a little bit easier!

Rating: 3
I sub'd veggie broth for chicken, as I have vegetarians in the family. Be careful not to over-season! Next time I won't salt the squash, as the broth provides plenty of seasoning. Risotto is labor-intensive, but worth it, although I (admittedly) need to perfect my risotto-making skills! I started drinking the leftover white wine called for in the recipe and forgot to tend to the stirring a couple of times!

I substituted vegetable broth to make this a vegan dish to bring to my in-laws' Thanksgiving dinner. It was extremely tasty, and so rich and creamy that it was hard to believe it was vegan. The only store open ran out of butternut squash so I used half butternut squash and half pumpkin, but you couldn't tell the difference. If you make this, make a BIG batch...it takes a lot of time and effort to make but it freezes and reheats well.

I have been making this dish since my October 1995 issue of Gourmet arrived on the doorstep. We serve it for every Thanksgiving and Christmas in our house, or bring to others. Always make extra so you can keep some all for yourself ! Also, at least double the ginger and triple the garlic - perfect !

Rating: 4
Being quite used to (and love!) typical risotto with stuff like italian sausage, mushrooms, lemon, etc., I found this one to be wonderfully different and unique. I did, however, roast the squash (purchased pre-cut and then cut into small bite sized pieces.) I removed half from the roasting pan about 10 minutes before the remaining half. I smashed the second half, but kept the first half whole, which added a nice texture to the dish. I added butter and lots of grated parmasean cheese at the end. My guests loved it! Next time, I'll double to get some leftovers.

My family loves risotto, so we tried this recipe. Fantastic! Everybody, even the teens, loved it. (One change that we frequently make in our recipes is to substitute shallots for onions. The flavor is richer and less "in your face".) This recipe is replacing roasted squash on our Thanksgiving menu this year!

This was a great dish to make. I served it with a salad. Mmm. I used pre-cut squash as it was easier than having to peel, de-seed, and cut. I left out the gingerroot as well and used some nutmeg to spice it a bit. Absolutely delicious and a favorite if you like butternut squash.

Very nice dish. I didn't enjoy the sweetness the ginger gave it so I make the following alterations: Leave out the ginger. Chop the whole squash into 1/2" dice, toss with olive oil and black pepper, and bake for 20-25 minutes. Toast some pinenuts (I use about 3-4 oz) in a dry frying pan until nicely browned. Then follow the recipe as stated, stirring in the pinenuts at the very end. A lovely supper dish.

I use a bag of Trader Joe's microwaveable butternut squash which is already peeled and cubed and ready to cook. This makes the dish even easier. Sage is a wonderful addition.

Although time consuming, the dish was very easy to make. I added fresh sage near the end, which was ESSENTIAL - I think it would have been too bland without it. However, with that addition, and the use of vermouth instead of white wine, it was delicious and a big hit.

Rating: 4
This recipe was my first attempt at making risotto, and what an outstanding success! My only deviation has been to peel and dice and bake the entire squash rather than just half of it(and bake the other half as is as the recipe suggests). I've made it a dozen times at least since that first time, and haven't tired of it yet!

Rating: 4
Very, very good. Lovely combination of flavors. However this is definitely not a "quick" dish: you have to peel the squash and cut it into tiny pieces, then bake the squash 20 min, then the risotto itself takes another 20 min. That said it is well worth the effort.

I used a 3lb squash so I doubled the rest of the recipe, and I still found that there was a bit more squash than I would have liked. The risotto came out creamy and delicious, but took 1.5 hours, not 45 minutes. I would make this again, just next time w/a smaller squash.

Everyone (including my stepson- who has an Italian mother) and I- thought this was one of the best risottos we've ever had. I quadrupled the recipe and it was just fine. Since I had so much liquid quadrupling it, I added a cup of liquid at a time to the arborio- no problem. There was 5 of us at dinner and there were no left-overs- always the best sign of a really good recipe in my house! Also very pretty to look at with the orange squash and the curly golden parmesan on top and drizzling of green chives, everyone thought it was a big bowl of pasta.

I couldn't find a butternut squash smaller than 3 lbs., so I bought one that size and doubled the recipe, following it exactly. It was unbelievably delicious and made enough for six to eight people. Of course, it took a long time like most risottos do, but if you have the time, it's well worth it. I'll make it again when I can find a smaller squash.

My boyfriend and I made this dish as part of our new lower-cholesterol, lower-processed food lifestyle. It was my first time preparing risotto and I thought it turned out really great. I'd had a similar dish at a restaurant a few weeks ago, and this recipe was definitely as good. I used red wine because the only white I had on hand was very sweet, but I liked the bold flavor of the red wine with the sweet squash. Omitted chives and didn't miss them one bit. Added a dash of cayenne for a slightly spicy aftertaste that my boyfriend loved. A very satisfying meal.

My first attempt at risotto-making was a disaster -- this recipe definitely wasn't! Tasty, and I didn't think it was too sweet for a dinner food (and I usually don't like sweet winter squash recipes), although my boyfriend thought it should be a dessert. Followed the recipe except: doubled it, roasted all of the squash in the skin rather than peeling some, since I tend to end up cutting myself every time I try to peel raw squash, and used vegetable broth because I'm a vegetarian. If/when I make it again, I think I'll add more onion and garlic, some cayenne & other ground peppers, and add some roasted nuts (maybe pine nuts or walnuts) as another garnish -- that should kick it back towards savory a little bit and add some texture.

The halved, chopped portion of the squash gave the risotto a good creamy sweet texture and flavor. I tasted the risotto during cooking and thought that it tasted better without the cheese. I think that the taste would be enhanced with sage, which I will do next time. Very good recipe.

This was an excellent dish and not too difficult to prepare. Sure, it was time-consuming, but it's almost soothing to cook after a long day of work! The roasted squash (the halved portion) gave it a rich, creamy taste without too much added fat. I didn't have fresh chives on hand, so I used a combination of dried chives and fresh green onion tops. Other than that, I made it exactly as is. I wonder if it would be good topped with fried sage leaves?

Rating: 4
I'm stingy with 4 forks, but this deserves it. I made it just as written and thought it was easy and delicious. I roasted the squash earlier in the day and just let it sit til dinner time. I think roasting probably really helps the flavor as opposed to baking it whole. I used canned stock and can only imagine that it would be that much better if you have homemade. I added the squash halfway through as directed and the cubed squash did not disintergrate, only the chopped squash melded into the risotto and made a nice flavor base. Loved it.

Now I know that some people don't like it when you haven't followed the recipe and still rate it, but YUM! I used the squash and added spinach, aspargus, and brocoli as well as some finely grated parmesian. It is a bit of work but so delicious. I wished there was some left over.

Great dish. Everyone loved it. I had a few changes though: I used finely sliced leeks instead of onion - I like its taste better. For the lazy ones, like me, it's easier to roast a whole squash in the oven for an hour (up to an hour and a half) and when it's ready (a fork should pierce easily) peel and dice it. I also added the butternut squash cubes when the risotto was almost ready in order to avoid a mushy orange-y risotto.

We've been making this dish since it first appeared, and it's the only one I've rated with 4 stars so far. It's absolutely delicious. Fresh ginger is essential, but I agree with the reviewer who says not to overdo it. There is another butternut squash risotto on this site (from a 1999 issue I think) that does not use ginger, but used sage and cumin instead instead of ginger. Not nearly as good as this one. To the cook who hates cutting the raw squash - I choose my squash by their shape, a little more evenly shaped to make the cutting easier.

Rating: 2
I only gave this 2 forks because it took WAY longer than 45 minutes. It seemed like it took 45 minutes just to cut, peel and chop the squash. I will make it again because it was good but next time I will roast the whole sqaush and scoop it out.

This was outstanding but I totally tweaked the original recipe!! I baked the squash as directed, but with some dried sage and garlic salt. Since I don't like Arborio rice, I substituted barley, so while the squash baked, I brought 3 1/2 cups chicken stock and a cup of barley to a boil. I then took a shortcut and covered and simmered over low heat for 35 minutes. After 35 minutes, added the chopped squash and half a cup of water, and simmered another 20 minutes until the barley was soft as I like it. Then turned off the heat, added 1/2 cup fat-free half and half and the cubed squash, more pepper and sage to taste. Covered and let it sit about 15 minutes to absorb any excess liquid. Topped it off with the parmesean curls and yummy, yummy, yummy!!! Outstanding and easy to microwave any leftovers!!

Very nice take on risotto. The ginger is a strong element and one shouldn't increase the amount. Also, the squash can be microwaved, rather than baked, with little difference in the final result. It's a good idea to undercook the squash initially, letting its final cooking take place after adding it to the rice. Otherwise, all the stirring can turn the squash to mush (which doesn't hurt the flavor, but it looks nicer with definite chunks of squash).

This risotto was absolutely wonderful. The recipe suggested an average cooking/stirring time of 18-20 minutes, but I found that by turning the heat lower and adding the broth over a time period closer to 30-35 minutes, the risotto was that much creamier and more thoroughly cooked. I'll happily make this one again!

Rating: 3
Delicious. I doubled it for company, and it worked perfectly. I also used homemade broth, which I think makes a big difference to any risotto. I added some grated parmesan to the pot before serving, rather than adding salt, which made it a bit richer and creamier, but is not really necessary. I also used bottled ginger, a convenience that works great in cases where the ginger flavor should not predominate. Highly recommended, with the caveat that the squash is a major undertaking, and should probably be done in advance if you're making it for company.

This is a great receipe! It has allowed me to appreciate how good butternut squash can be. I added roasted garlic olive oil and used ground ginger instead and it worked out perfect. I also tossed the squash with the roasted olive oil too before roasting. It is a dish that works well with a fresh green salad and a nice glass of wine. A cool fall night and a warm fire doesn't hurt either! I will be emailing this to many friends (LSnow enjoy!)

Despite what a pain it was to peel that butternut squash, I would make this again. My husband, a serious meat eater, would not stop eating this. The ginger and garlic added great flavors.

I'm not a big fan of squash but I know that it's an excellent source of vitamin A and I love risotto so I thought I'd try this based on the reviews. It was super. I added sliced grilled chicken breasts (coated with garlic and olive oil) to the top to make it more "manly" for my husband and he thought it was great. I also tried increasing the rice to 3/4 cup but that was more than 2 servings for us.

It was so delicious! I substituted dry vermouth for the wine and increased the rice to 3/4 c, with about 2 1/2 c broth because it seemed like 1/2 c would not be enough for a main course. Very filling and the two of us ate it all, with a salad on the side.

Healthy, delicious and beautiful to look at this risotto has it all. My husband, who refuses to eat what he calls "violent" vegitables (beets and squash)was won over. A perfect dish to share and needs only a salad of wild greens and a nice bottle of wine to make a simple elegant meal after a hard day at the pumpkin patch or picking apples.

This is one of my favorite risotto recipes -- it's incredibly easy, looks beautiful, and tastes sinful even though it isn't. I make it vegetarian by substituting vegetable broth.

Very good. Make it often and always leave out the ginger and it doesn't seem to make a difference.

Who could ask for more. A creamy risotto with the wonderful flavors of the sweet butternut squash and ginger. A real treat and preparation is simple. The recipe is can be converted to vegetarian by substituting vegetable broth. Be sure to have additional liquid warm and ready. Cook/stir until dish is creamy and semi-firm.

Very excellent. This is the risotto dish that we made with the polenta dish! We used unchicken broth (vegetarian) instead of chicken. We had a fun afternoon of cooking.

This is a delicious recipe, but the recipe didn't call for nearly enough liquid. I just added more water as necessary, which turned out fine.
