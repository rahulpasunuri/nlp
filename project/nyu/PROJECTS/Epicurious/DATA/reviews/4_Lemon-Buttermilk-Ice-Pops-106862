Tart, light, and refreshing--a perfect summer dessert. I took a cue from the previous reviews and chopped the lemon zest finely as possible. I really like lemon zest, so I didn't mind crunching through the little bits of it, but if you're not a huge fan of zest, I'd suggest leaving it out. Also, I made this as a sorbet instead of as popsicles. I just dumped the mixture into my ice cream maker, and it came out great! I'll definitely be making this again.

I cringed when I saw lemon combined with buttermilk..not the case. This an amazing combination, absolutely delicious!!

Delicious! As other raters suggested, I blended the mixture to make the pieces of zest very small. The only reason I gave the recipe 3 forks is I actually thought it was too sweet. Next time I make it I will reduce the sugar.

I double (or triple) this recipe and put it in the ice cream maker...one ice pop serving is never enough!

yummm... perfect! I too was a little unsure of the buttermilk, but now can't imagine the lemon without it. I used lowfat buttermilk and it was fine with fewer calories.

These are unbelievable. If my friend Nancy hadn't told me that I should try them, I would have passed the recipe right by. The ingredients don't exactly look delicious, but don't let the ingredient list throw you off. The pops are excellent and they reminded me of key lime pie on a stick.

I can't believe that I have failed to tell ya'll how wonderful these are! I made them quite some time ago and was searching through my recipe box for this. I will be making them next weekend for friends, they will never believe how easy and great they taste...yes, even with buttermilk in it!

It is sorta gross in a filling sort of way.

This recipe was simple and delicious. To avoid the problem with the 'ribbons' of peel, I grated the lemon peel and ran it through my food processor because I love the taste of lemon zest and had no problems with pieces of peel getting stuck in my teeth. These were the hit of the Fourth of July party I took them to.

These were really good and simple to make. I used half the amount of buttermilk and did the other half with coconut milk - very tasty!

I made these simply because I had a jug of buttermilk in the fridge and needed to use it... but WOW, were they great. I too skipped the lemon peel. I've also put the mixture into my ice cream mixer and it was yummy!

Yummmmmmmm... we were in a hurry, and made without the lemon peel, but they were still quite lemony-- and quite delicious.

Everyone loved these. My 9-year-old has made them many times since we first tried them. The buttermilk is a great taste addition. We think they're better than lemon sorbet or sherbet. Be sure to grate peel very finely or you'll have what my 5-year-old calls popsicles with strings.

These are amazing pops! I am too totally addicted to them (I did them three times now). I did all three recipes of that section and these are by far the best ones- don't lose your time over the blueberry ones.

these are fabulous and addictive. they taste unusual, not like buttermilk. don't think they are a good choice for younger children though, because they are quite lemony.

I loved these, and my uncle said they were the best popsicle he'd ever had in his life! The kids weren't as fond of them (it was the lemon peel, I think), but the adults really enjoyed them.
