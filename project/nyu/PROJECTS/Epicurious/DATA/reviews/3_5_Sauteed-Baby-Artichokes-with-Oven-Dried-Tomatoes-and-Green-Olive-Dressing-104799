i have been trying to find a recipe that highlights the baby artichoke flavor instead of overwhelming/masking it, and this one is it. If you love artichokes and can find baby ones in your area, this is perfect, because the babies are much less time consuming. I can get them at at least one Whole Foods in my area fall-spring-the cherry creek store in Denver. I used sundried tomatoes, and that was my only mistake-they were too tough, and if you have the time, i'm sure doing the oven-dried ones is well worth it. Also, make sure you take off enough of the outer leaves to the very pale ones, and i take off the top 1/3 of the art-otherwise you'll end up with tough parts that are hard/impossible to chew. Fantastic recipe!!

Followed the recipe pretty closely. Make sure to really trim the outside tougher leaves - I thought I had gotten them, but we were pulling them off and spitting them out. Otherwise this was delicious! Great flavors!

We used sun-dried tomatoes instead of the oven-dried ones and recommend omitting the wine too. For the dressing only used 1/3 cup oil and a squeeze of lemon juice. For the pasta - added walnuts and they added a new dimension of flavor/texture. Definitely a make again!

This was a delicious and unique dish that I served with the spicy marinated mozzerella and antipasto (both from Epicurious). No problem finding the fresh baby artichokes, but a bit time consuming preparing them - especially since I doubled the recipe! Will definitely make again.

YES!!! I found the baby artichokes at the farmer's market. This was the first time that I have cooked with them. When the recipe says to peel back to the light green portion of the choke heed their words otherwise you'll be chewing for hours! The favors were excellent though

Delicious with excellent flavor and beautiful presentation. I served it with simply roasted chicken wings and it was a big hit. I also loved the wine recommendation, since so many times artichokes can be a wine killer. Roasting the tomatoes can make a not so good supermarket tomato pretty decent.

The artichokes without the mushrooms, tomatoesand dressing are really a nice side dish. Made as directed, is a nice topping for grilled swordfish. I doubled, the garlic, of course!

I placed it over pasta and it was excellent. Also, I confess that I made it once with canned artichoke hearts as I was in a bit of a hurry.

This was wonderful. In the metro DC area, you can usually find baby artichokes at Sutton Place Gourmet. They are more expensive but worth it for special occasions.

I had problems finding baby artichokes, too. So I opted for the frozen regular artichokes, since I was in a time cruch for a weekday dinner. I thinked it worked out pretty well and my guests thought so too.

As a quick fyi, baby artichokes are regularly sold at Trader Joe's here on the West Coast.

Here in MD it's apparently against the law to take baby artichokes away from the parent plant - can't find them anyplace. So we must be content with big old Mom & Dad. After cleaning, I cut the good stuff in halves or quarters depending on size & proceed from there. I've made this concoction so many times since the mag arrived that the house is submerged under artichoke leavings. Love it, love it!

I must be honest. Baby Artichokes are expensive and difficult to find. They have an exquisite flavor all their own, and your recipe sounds like it would be disguised, at best, ruined at worst. Baby artichokes are delicate..cleaning is minimal, just tear off a few "hard" leaves, then, with a paring knife, just cut the tips in a circular motion, trim the base, and throw in a bowl of lemon water. To prepare, saute an entire head of garlic in olive oil until the garlic is golden brown and soft. Remove garlic from pan. Pat artichokes dry quickly with a paper towel and add to pan, about 8 or 9 artichokes per HEAD of garlic, and saute on medium low heat until artichokes look crispish on the outside and are tender when pierced with a fork. Drizzle some of the hot olive oil on a plate and put artichokes on top, serve with some fresh, crusty italian bread (for dipping in the oil). SENSATIONAL. Don't mind my 1 fork review, you may like the recipe here but, trust me, the recipe I just gave is beyond compare! I mean it.
