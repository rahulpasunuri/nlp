This recipe was great! You really do have to boil the octopus for an hour or more for it to get tender but then it's delicious and I love the extra step of grilling it afterward for some char. Also loved the combination of Kale, tomatoes and beans.

This was my first time making octopus so, no surprise, it came out chewy. Next time, I may flash--boil and then roast the octpus, which I hear may give it a better texture. It's also possible it needed to be grilled for more time. Taste-wise, it was lovely, it was just the texture.
