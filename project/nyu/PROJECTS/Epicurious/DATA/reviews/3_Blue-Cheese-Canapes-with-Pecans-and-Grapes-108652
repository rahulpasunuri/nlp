I never review recipes because I don't have time, but this poor recipe deserves better. It is one of my staple hors d'oeuvres, and I have made it many times because it is simple, easy and delicious. It is crumbly because blue cheese is crumbly. I just give the cheese a couple of squeezes before pressing it onto the melba toast and that solves the crumbly problem! If you're looking for a quick but fancy hors d'oeuvre that your guests will rave about, this is certainly one of them.

These are delicious and the presentation is very nice. I used Melba Toasts and after I placed the cheese/pecan mixture on top of the toasts I nuked them for about 8 seconds. It solved the crumbling problem and didn't compromise the taste.

Was very good. Mixed it up a day ahead and refrigerated. Not a good idea, as it broke down the bleu cheese a bit.

I am a carterer and this recipe is a hit! I recommend letting the cheese come to room temp before trying to handle otherwise it will crumble too much. Also, don't skimp with on the quality of blue cheese. This dish is so simple in flavor that you really need to buy a top quality stilton.

As a caterer, I try to find ways to streamline presentation...try this for this tasty recipe. Toast nuts and rough chop. Place on plate. Do the same for grapes. Make a bleu cheese mousse mixture; pipe onto little crackers. Dip one side of mousse mix in chopped nut; other in chopped grapes. Top with parsley leaf.

the first thing on here i wouldn't make again. i had to mash the topping together in a bag so it would stay together on top of the crackers. it was good, but nothing special and not worth the assembly time.

Delicious? Yes. Easy to make? No. While the flavors blend quite nicely, the 45 minutes it took me to assemble this suggested that I won't be making this again. The cheese was indeed too crumbly, so I suggest finding other means of using these same ingredients.

The second time I made this recipe, I brush one side of the little toasts with melted butter...this way they weren't so dry. I added a Tbsp of whipping cream to the bleu cheese mixture to help bind it together a little better. Flavor is good on this canapes...they are pretty as well... I think they are more work than they are worth. Try just rolling the red gapes in the smash bleu cheese and then rolling them in toasted chopped nuts --- self contained and you can skip the toast or cracker!

Everyone is right they are too crumbly. The taste was just fine though. I will make again and maybe add a touch of heavy cream to hold the mixture together better. I didn't have any melba toast and tried to use regular crackers, big mistake.

This was a big hit at a cocktail party I threw. I didn't make enough food and threw this together at the last minute. Everyone loved it. I used small crackers and small grapes and my guests just popped them in their mouths. I really molded (squished) the cheese together and it wasn't too crumbly.

They ARE crumbly to make. Alas, they are also crumbly to eat - not very nice for your guests. I would pass on this one.

Quick and easy. I have made simular and did not heat in oven. Great served hot or cold
