This was tasty, but I'm not sure I would have thought it was worth the effort if I had to cut and peel all the veg. I roast all my veges on the weekend to make mid-week meals easier, and this was a great way to use them up at the end of the week. It took about 10 minutes to cook and everyone enjoyed it.

I really didn't like this at all. I think I've even going to bin the rest. I love all ingredients but the combo was just yuck. Sweet pasta isn't my thing.

Quite good, and a great way to utilize pretty much the only winter produce around right now. We used quinoa instead of ziti, since it was what we had. I sauteed carrot and onion before adding the quinoa, and then added the root vegetable mixture to that. The only other substitution was radishes instead of beets, and that is because my boyfriend doesn't know the difference between the two! It turned out really well though. The radish is also a root vegetable, and when roasted loses its peppery bite. We are going to have the leftovers with chicken breast this evening.

Really enjoyed this recipe. It was a good one to make on a weeknight but I will cut the veggies for this dish the night before we make it again to cut down on time. It seemed to take a shorter amount of time to cook. My husband picked up red beets and it did color the pasta but the flavor was really great. Used our dry rosemary from our garden and only 1/3 cup broth. Totally try it!

I'd been looking for something different to try with root vegetables and this was delicious. One caution, though - as a few other reviewers have pointed out, the veggies don't need as much time to cook as the recipe calls for. Once the stock is added, they only need to cook for a few more minutes. I added the parsnips after the sweet potato, since they cook quicker, and also sauteed some chopped garlic with the onion and added some red pepper flakes. Couldn't find beet greens so I used kale instead. Delicious. I'd definitely make this again.

I was pleasantly surprised by this dish. Root carbs on carbs didn't sound like my favorite meal, I think crispier veggies. However, this meal was delightful and I used a homemade beef stock and rutabaga instead of beet. Fantastic.

I made this recipe several times without the beet greens and using thyme instead of rosemary. My entire family (all of whom don't like the same things) loved it. After reading the reviews, I'm going to add pancetta and switch to chicken broth. Really good, hearty recipe.

Beware the parsnips! I had never tasted them before, and they have a very strong, distinct flavor than not everyone will like. They also turned out much more soft than the rest of the vegetables, so giving them less cooking time might be a good idea. Or leave them out...

Used celeriac and sweet potato with the red onion & added quartered cherry tomatoes at end. Also used chicken broth vs vegetable broth. & didn't need the second addition of broth as was moist enough as was. Excellent dish, hearty and flavorful (be sure to add alot of rosemary and salt/pepper) and really simple.

Like another reader, I have to give this a 4 to make up for those who didn't like it. For a person who has a hard time eating all the vegetables I should, this was a winner. Great by itself and leftovers were great with grilled meat or chicken. My husband and I managed to eat every scrap of this yummy. pretty dish over the course of a few days and we never got sick of it.

I thought this was really good. I substituted a rutabaga since I couldn't find golden beets, and that paired well. I also threw in a few handfuls of baby spinach in place of the beet greens. I think I would cook the veggies a little less, because they started to fall apart by the end when I was mixing everything together.

My husband and I loved this. The caramelized vegetables are just delicious, and I can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight. One change: I let the beet greens cook a little longer than the recipe instructs. Otherwise made exactly as written.

We didn't care for this recipe at all. The veggies got way overcooked in 15 min, and the flavors did not pair well together.

My husband, 25-year-old daughter, and I give this recipe 3 forks. Albertsons did not have golden beets, so I bought red. Of course, the red beets made everything red. I called this our Valentines pasta dinner. We substituted the ziti with wheat pasta for a totally healthy and delicious dinner. We will definitely make this "colorful" dinner again.

I'd probably give this 3 1/2 forks, but I had to rate it high to make up for everyone else! I don't understand the bad reviews. I added a cubed chunk of pancetta right at the beginning and pre-roasted beets, which may have helped, and used whole wheat pasta. You really need to make sure the vegetables are caramelized before adding the broth, and use lots of salt. Once the vegetables are caramelized you don't need to cook it in the broth very long. Definitely serves six, like it says in the menu, not in the heading. To the reviewer from New Jersey, I didn't know Atkins was still considered healthy! And it's olive oil and a little butter, jeez Louise.

Just made this for dinner tonight... for starters, it could have easily served 8-10. Per previous comments, I roasted a bit of garlic with the veggies... but the flavors still didn't work. I will not be making this again, but if you do, I recommend roasting the beets for a few minutes before adding the other vegetables. Otherwise you'll get under cooked beets and over cooked potatoes and parsnips.

This was just okay. It seemed like a good way to get in some different vegetables, but the result was a bit bland. If I made it again, I'd add red pepper flakes or garlic to give it more flavor. I did like the addition of the beet greens. I'd probably add that again to a pasta dish, but I wouldn't use this exact recipe. Overall, not horrible tasting, but not worth the time and effort.

This sounds like an awful lot of simple carbs and sugars with omega-6 based oil. I'm not so sure how healthy this is...

We made this last night and it was perfect for a winter night. We used red beets instead of the golden, as they were already on-hand, and a mix of macaroni and penne in place of the ziti. Terrific and simple.

Made this recipe last night and it was great! Very easy to make, and was a very warm comfort food kind of meal. I would say that I agree it probably needs a bit of salt to taste, but otherwise it was just right!

I made this as a quick supper tonight. I would agree it helps to have a second chef to peel while you chop. I used Spanish white onion instead of red onion and I was a bit short on golden beets (1.5 cups) but it turned out great regardless. I love how the veggies get seared and deglaze once the broth is added - it makes such a rich, sweet sauce. My only note is that I'm conscious of my salt intake and this is not a recipe to go light on the salting instructions.

We didn't really like this - the flavor of beets was overpowering and we just thought the flavors with pasta just didn't go together well. On the upside, our toddler loved it.

This is yummy, easy and cheap. It's a great recipe to make in pairs since the chopping of the vegetables is a little time consuming and the non-cook can chop while the cook arranges everything else. I've used beet greens and chard as the green, and the beet greens are better.
