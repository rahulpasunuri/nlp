Have made this many times; everyone loves it. No modifications, aside from leaving off the raw onion.

Rating: 4
This is fantastic. Only modifications is that I roasted the onion with the chicken because I didn't want so much raw onion, and I think the yogurt sauce would be better with again, less onion. This chicken is so wonderfully tender and has a great flavor.

very good--this makes a lot of spice rub, could be used on 2-2.5 lbs of chick breasts easily.

I did this to the T, except I didn't have a chili pepper so I used 1/4 tsp cayenne - perfect spiciness for "casual ethnic" eaters. I used a different yogurt sauce as well. The chicken was good. I had breast tenderloins. I think this could use some other flavor...maybe a little tomato. Overall the dish seemed to get lost in the yogurt sauce.

This is a tasty Tandoori-inspired dish. I didn't have any chiles on hand and used 1/2 tsp extra hot chili powder instead. Also left out the onions and served with Traditional Indian Raita recipe from this site. Will definitely be making this again!

This was a good recipe. My wife thought it was a little too spicy for her, though she generally doesn't do well with excessively spicy foods. The chilled onions did not add much to the finished product.

This is a good recipe and quite simple but there are a LOT of ingredients and the result is not a WOW. I thought with so many great reviews that it would knock our socks off!

I made this my own, but the base recipe is delicious and versatile. I forgot to buy yogurt, so left it out of the recipe. Marinated overnight. Did not measure anything. Will make again (might even remember yogurt next time....)!

I hadn't read all the reviews, so I didn't cut back on the salt (I used standard salt) and it was definitely too salty. Otherwise, the flavors were wonderful. I cooked the chicken in my George Foreman grill rather than broiling it -- so easy, healthy and great!

This recipe was easy to make and very tasty. I wasn't able to find turmeric and left out the cloves, but the taste was still exceptional!

It is a good simple recipe. The dip can be made spicier by adding a little green chile and a few leaves of mint if you like the taste

Rating: 3
Moist and juicy-and I used lime juice instead of lemon for the sauce. I marinated in the paste all day and left most of it on when broiling-didnt have a problem with burning. We do cook authentic Indian frequently, but this is a great substitute for a quick tandoori taste.

Rating: 2
I made this for dinner with my mom and she liked it but I did not think it was anything special. The yogurt sauce was bland dispite adding cilantro as suggested by other reviewers. The chicken itself was well spiced but I think the marinade would have tasted better as a creamy sauce. For a low fat dish though, it was not bad.

What temperature did everyone use?

Rating: 3
This made a great and easy weeknight dinner. The chicken breasts stayed juicy despite probably broiling it a bit too long. I didn't feel like being bothered with fresh ginger, but ground ginger worked just fine. Also, no ground cloves so I added cinnamon instead. Turned out great!

Rating: 1
There are indeed better tandoori recipes. Having just come back from India and being married to an Indian, I have to tell you that good tandoori is seldom cooked in a conventional oven. It's just not hot enough. What you end up with is a piece of meat that is not browned (unless you cook it like an old boot), and on which are spices that are still a bit raw. One thing you could do is scrape the chicken well before you put it into the oven. That way it'll brown a bit more, but will not be tandoori, but merely a piece of overly spiced chicken.

Rating: 3
I doubled this recipe for a holiday dinner party and it was excellent. Instead of the jalapeno, I added several small minced serrano peppers and it wasn't too hot, even for the more heat sensitive guests. I let the chicken marinate for 24 hours and it was very easy preparation...just take the breasts out of the marinade and pop them into the broiler. Will definitely add this to my list of make-agains.

Rating: 3
I am very sensitive to salt, so I left the salt out of this recipe entirely. I thoroughly enjoyed the texture of chicken, and this recipe went over very well with my meat-and-potatoes loving family.

Rating: 3
Quite good. I used a tzatziki base for the yogurt side sauce and then added in the ingredients. I also used Greek yogurt (strained) for the paste and substituted a jalepeno. Very quick and easy.

Rating: 0
To the previous reviewer: I have no idea if you used coarse salt or not, but if you make this with regular table salt it will indeed be too salty. I love to use coarse Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal brand is my favorite) on everything. The salt tastes somehow sweeter and less harsh than table salt. It's a little more expensive, but really worth it.

Rating: 1
I love Indian food and I was excited to try it at home. Maybe I did something wrong - but my husband and I could only eat a few bites - the chicken was very salty. The only substitution I made was fat-free yogurt instead of the lowfat version. I did, however, like the idea of broiling the chicken, it gave the breast a nice, crispy outside and the chicken was very moist inside.

Rating: 4
This recipe was so easy and delicious. My boyfriend and I both loved the flavor, and the chicken was sealed with it's juices. I marinated over-night, because I was going to be crunched for time the next day. I used the lime-cilantro sauce recommended by another reviewer. It added a lot to the flavor of the chicken, but alone it was rather bland. It was so quick, easy, and so gourmet! :) My boyfriend and I both loved it.

Rating: 4
Very very good. I prepared the chicken around 11 am and grilled it up at 6 pm. It was outstanding! A keeper. Most of all listen to the reader who said to make Indian Baked Rice. That is an amazing rice dish!

Rating: 3
This is easy and very tasty. The addition of the chile makes it just spicy enough. I agree with the other reviewer who stressed that this is Tandoori Spiced, not a true tandoori.

Rating: 3
We thought that this was a tasty way to fix a low-fat chicken dish. I made up the marinade in the early afternoon and placed the chicken in it. I got both sides covered with the marinade and let it sit in the refrigerator until I was ready to broil it. That avoided having to spray oil on one side of the chicken and it got the flavor on both sides of the chicken breasts. The ice-water soaked onions were the big surprise--am definitely going to do that again.

Rating: 4
This is a great Indian chicken dish that won't take all day to prepare. Considering it wasn't marinated overnight, it was suprisingly flavorful-just the right amount of spices. I used a different sauce from this website called Lime-Cilantro Yogurt Sauce....yummy.

Rating: 3
This was very easy, and tasted very good. For the last few minutes I put in some quartered tomatoes and bell peppers. To the reviewer who said it is not tandoori chicken, this recipe is not called tandoori chicken. It is called tandoori-SPICED chicken. For those of us who haven't a clay oven at home and don't feel like going out to a place that has a clay oven, it tastes similar to tandoori chicken, made at home without a clay oven. Tandoori-SPICED. Not tandoori.

Rating: 3
This dish exceeded my expectations. The yogurt made the chicken really tender and the taste was really out of the ordinary. I'll definitely make again.

Rating: 1
It was decent, but it was definitely NOT tandoori chicken, and that's why it dseserves a low rating. This recipe should be called curry chicken, or Indian-spiced chicken, but it is misleading to put the word tandoori in the recipe title.

This is my first time cooking Indian food.What a great dish!!!!!

Rating: 4
I'm giving this four forks because - 1) it's fast and easy; and, 2) the flavors are wonderful. I did cut back on the salt a bit due to earlier reivews (used 1 t rather than 1.5), and I also added about a quarter cup chopped cucumber and 2-3 T chopped cilantro to the yogurt sauce (thanks to an earlier reviewer for the excellent tip). My husband and I both agreed that this dish is a keeper, and a nice departure from the ordinary.

I prepared the marinade in the morning before leaving for work, so it was quick work to get dinner on the table when I arrived home. I used dried ginger and it was fine; I agree that it was too salty.

I wasn't crazy about this. It was different, and it wasn't bland, but none of us were too excited about it. Certainly not something I'll ever get a 'craving' for again.

My husband loves Indian food so it was nice to make something quick with common ingredients (instead of going out) for a change. If you have the spices on hand its easy to throw together with regular chicken breasts. Definately a keeper for a busy Mom with a hungry husband :)

Rating: 3
Yes, the marinade described in the recipe is way, way too salty. I recommend adding salt after all the other marinade ingredients have been mixed. That said -- the yogurt gives the chicken a wonderful, velvety texture, and the longer you let the chicken sit in the marinade the better. This recipe is impossible to screw up, and boy, is it delicious. I served it with jasmine rice and a salad made with fennel, orange, and Gorgonzola in a light vinaigrette, and nobody at dinner had any idea how healthy it all was. Big bonus. I still recommend cilantro and cucumber in the yogurt sauce.

Rating: 3
Definitely a winner in the quick-and-easy stakes, and yummy to boot. Not to mention healthy! This will be a regular with us, with a few modifications; in future, I will increase the lemon and cut back on the salt. A tad more garlic probably wouldn't go amiss, either. My boyfriend pronounced it 'really delicious', which is quite an acheivement. With brown rice and (over-)steamed green beans (oops), we had a dinner that was very satisfying, not at all as if we were watching our diet and easy to do prep before going to the gym (so it had about 2 hours in the marinade). Since my boyfriend hates hot food, I omitted the chili from the marinade and sprinkled crushed chili on mine before broiling. May add some paprika for colour next time. The cinnamon is an intriguing idea, too. This review only really applies to the chicken, as the yoghurt sauce was pretty much changed beyond recognition by the time I'd finished with it.

Rating: 4
Very good and very easy and quick to make. As for the pepper, experiment a bit before if you are afraid of very spicy food. One pepper is really very hot.

Yummy! I doubled the lemon juice as suggested, and I also added a bit of cinnamon to the sauce. MAde for a nice complement to the spiciness.

Very tasty dish! The chicken was really flavorful and moist. I couldn't find the corriander in my cabinet, and just increased all the other spices and it worked out very well. I also cut the chicken in small chunks and reduced the cooking time (about 2.5 minutes per side) it was still really moist. I also doubled the lemon in the sauce and added a few dashes of pepper rather than a pinch.

Rating: 3
This was delicious. I made 3 changes. I used chili pasted instead of jalapenos, bone in chicken breasts and my husband grilled them. They were great with the soaked onions and the actually good sauce. I will add cilantro to the sauce next time.

This recipe tastes like it took hours to prepare. If you make the marinade ahead of time, "cooking dinner" only take about 15 minutes. The flavor is spectacular. I served it with Basmati Mustard Seed Pilaf and Sauteed Shallot and Spinach Chiffonade--both from this website. A 4-fork meal for any night of the week!

This dish is very easy to prepare and cook. The yogurt sauce however, needs work in the seasoning. I used cilantro but, feel it still just wasn't right. I'll be fiddling with it to find a perfect blend, what ever that may be.

My boyfriend said it was the 2nd best dish I've made him, and I've made him a lot of dishes! Personally, I would have preferred a bit more spice. I forgot which pepper I used. It was green. Next time I will put more, or use a hotter pepper. The yogurt sauce was good, he doesn't eat yogurt, so I didn't tell him what it was until after he ate IT ALL! I doubled the lemon juice, and we both thought it could have used more. Served with veggies and coconut rice, which did not turn out as I had hoped.

I really liked this recipe as well. I've tried several other tandoori marinades before and wasn't excited about them, but this one is quite nice. I followed other reader's suggestions and served it with the coconut rice topped with toasted coconut, which was an excellent accompaniment. I'll definitely make it again.

Delicious. The flavors in the curry paste really blended together nicely. I grilled the chicken instead of cooking in the oven, and I threw the onion on the grill too, since I'm not crazy about raw onion. Fixed it with coconut rice as an accompaniment--perfect. This was one of those recipes that requires me to buy at least two new spices (for which I get harrassed by my husband) but it was definitely worth it--I'll use them up making this recipe over and over.

This dish was outstanding. My husband and I are trying to maintain a low-fat, low-cal diet, and this dish fits right in. I served the chicken with coconut jasmine rice -- excellent filling meal. The only thing I will do differently next time is increase the amount of spice marinade to ensure that I have enough to coat each piece of chicken completely.

Wow! I indulged my b/f's taste for spice by using a habenero chile, and including the seeds, which made it a bit too spicy for my taste....but i still really enjoyed it (i just needed lots of yogurt sauce!). Paired it with the curried basmati rice and apple pilaf from this website, which was delicious, and just a basic salad (nice creamy dressing to give my poor burning tongue a break!). Definitely saving this to make again!

Tasted the rub before it went on chicken and it was so hot, terrifying this heat wimp, but when it was all cooked and with the yogurt sauce, it was perfect! Served it with brown rice cooked with scallions and chicken stock. Delicious.

I've made other Tandoori chicken recipes that call for marinading for 6+ hours, so I was somewhat skeptical that the chicken could absorb the marinade flavors in 30 minutes, but it turned out well.

We LOVED this recipe ! My fiance and I made this togther and it was a joy !! The spices created a wonderful aroma during cooking and a great taste during eating. The yoghurt sauce is a MUST - and if we would change anything about this recipe, we would DOUBLE the quantity of the yoghurt sauce. We thought the spices could be too much .. but don't worry - we followed the recipe exactly and it was fine. If you like hot spice, add an extra chili. And the cabernet we drank with this was a good choice. Excelllent.

The majority of my family is not a fan of most Indian food, but these were delicious barbecued. We even liked the yogurt sauce and onions along side. As a main course for 4 this is very light so I made the curried rice, beans and veggies pilaf on this site. Grilled corn, pickled cukes from the June 2001 Bon Appetit and naan made this a very filling and delicious Sunday dinner.

This is a great dish! My boyfriend loved this and he hates Indian Food! I never thought I could make this dish & have it come close to the way my favorite restaurant makes it!

I will definately make this again & try the sauce.

Easy, fragrant, and wonderfully tasty. I have tried making tandoori chicken before, but never with such smashing results. The cool and slightly tart yougurt is a great balance to the spicy chicken.I did not have nutmeg, cloves or coriander on hand, so added some garam masala instead. Two nights after I made this for my family, everyone wanted it again!

Excellent! My husband and I loved this chicken, just like the chicken tikka we order from our favorite Indian restaurant. I'm so pleased this was so easy to make, with ingredients that were already in my house. This is a keeper, next time I'll try this with jumbo shrimp! I also added cucumber to the sauce.

Rating: 4
The flavors are great. I don't like food that is too spicy, so I will use half of the marinade next time. I think it would also be good to slice the chicken when it's cooked, then serve it over white rice with a little of the sauce on top; then serve more sauce on the side. I made double the sauce.

We used this with a whole chicken, tripled the recipe and put the paste under the skin. Then marinated the chicken in the paste 30 mins, then cooked in a baking bag for 90 minutes - VERY TENDER!!

This dish was great! I will definitely make it again. My friend Eugene and I suggest: - After marinating the Chix in the sauce, it wasn't really intuitive as to how to apply the oil prior to broiling -- without removing the delicious sauce.

The serrano peppers make it a little too spicy - it upset my husband's stomach. My girlfrined is Indian and she said this recipe is very authentic. Turmeric is an expensive spice. Next time I make this, I may experiment with a milder type of pepper.
