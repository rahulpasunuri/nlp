I loved this- it has great flavour and, since I put all of it through the ricer, great texture as well. The second time I made it I threw in a couple cloves of garlic and substituted parsnips for the carrots, & the parsnips in particular made a big difference (better colour & a little sweeter, which offset the sunchokes beautifully). With those changes, a 3.75.

Great recipe! I made half the recipe exactly as written and would probably puree the carrot next time. The result as written had specs of carrots throughout and it wasn't like your typical puree.

I made this with sunchokes and mixed in minced garlic, parmesan, and salt/pepper. My guests had never heard of a puree, and they loved it.

This was just great. Always on the lookout for sunchoke recipes as they are delicious hot or cold and not difficult for us to find. Only change made was added a few cloves garlic to water and simmered with veggies, and cut down on the amount of butter. Served with veal roast. Yum!

Definitely add some garlic and I think next time I'll add herbs too. Much better than the usual mashed potatoes.

I can't really say that I made this recipe to specifications but it turned out pretty good with my variations. I have a Dutch cookook that is full of potato purees with carrots, celery root, kale, cabbage, etc. The Dutch call it "hutspot" or "hotchpotch" in English. Very simply I replaced the carrots with parsnips and boiled those with unpeeled red potatoes, sunchokes, a chopped onion, 3 bay leaves, 3 cloves of garlic, and some fresh thyme. When fully cooked, I drained and smashed the veggie mixture in my stand mixer using the paddle attachment. I added some fresh cracked pepper, butter and lowfat sour cream for a fantastic result that is less starchy than plain old mashed potatoes and full of flavor!

This dish was really nice with brisket. I made it with celery root. The only thing i would do differently is that i would puree the carrot with the celery root--grating it seemed like unecessary trouble and it gave the puree a strange look in my opinion. I think it would be nicer if the carrot was pureed. Also, i used about 1/2 the butter and didn't miss it.

Delicious with Roasted Rack of Venison and Shallots with Dried-Cranberry Gravy, also on this site. I think it would be delicious with any roasted meat.
