I made this years and years ago and am thrilled that I found the recipe again. Those who had it the first time still ask for it again. Not hard and really impressive.

The variations on this recipe are limitless. Skip the praline and use whipped cream. Use raspberry sauce in the cups and over top the unmolded cups. Coat the molds one weekend, fill them the next weekend, serve them the third weekend. Great presentation and a snap to make in stages.

Instead of birthday cake my son always asks for these instead. This is a very rich dessert so a two inch cup is plenty. Otherwise it can be overwhelming. I've made these with a raspberry sauce which is just as good.

This is a wonderfully festive dessert that can be made in advance for a special occasion. The only part that is at all tricky is removing the bombes from the cups; make sure you get very flexible, not rigid, plastic cups.

An outstanding special occasion dessert! A lot of steps, but easier than it looks, and good to make ahead. I had wondered whether it would be easy to "unmold" from the plastic cups, and it is very easy.

Very easy to make weeks in advance. Try it with white chocolate and sorbet or dark chocolate and coffee ice cream, etc.
