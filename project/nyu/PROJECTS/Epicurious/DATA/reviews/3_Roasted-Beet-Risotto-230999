I am giving this 3 forks only because I made some edits, but it gave me a great idea. I also used Vegetable Stock instead of chicken stock, and also added some purified water. I used one diced sweet onion and also some sliced green onions, sauteed with garlic and oil. I finally finished by adding sauteed portabella mushrooms in addition to the beets. I didn't mix the beets throughout but rather added them on top of the dish. It was delicious overall! Oh I also cut out the wine and added a hint of romano cheese to serve.

First and foremost, this dish was amazing. I don't get to cook very often, so usually when I do it's not too great. This risotto, however, was superb. So why only three forks? Well, I made a TON of alterations. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, red wine instead of white, I left out the cheese, I peeled and diced the beets before roasting to speed things along a little, and I used brown rice for a bit more protein and fiber. I also only used a tiny bit of onion, but that's because I'm not a big fan of onion. Next time I may use garlic in its place. All that done, the dish was simply delicious. I served it with roasted rosemary lemon tofu and green beans. Oh, it was so good.

This was a huge hit in my house. We are big beet eaters. I used my food processor to chop the onions finely and then used it to chop the beets finely. I was able to make this super fast and easily. I also added some barley to make it a touch more healthy. YUM! We LOVED IT. Next time I make it I am going to add some rosemary and use a mushroom brother instead of water. I will definitely be making this again.

I combined all the tips from previous reviewers and got a fabulous result. Here are the changes: 1) When almost done sauteing the onions, add 3 cloves of garlic and saute them for about 15-20 seconds more. 2) Use almost all chicken broth and wine. I used 6c broth, 2/3c wine and just 1/2c water. 3) Add extra cheese, to your liking. With adjustments like that, I knew it would have to be good, and it is! I've made it with both red beets and golden, and preferred red slightly.

This risotto is amazing. I love the color!

In the interest of time-saving, I boiled my beets, used golden beets, home-made stock with some of the beet water & butter, not olive oil. It was delicious, and ready in about 35 minutes. Will definitely make it again.

Gorgeously colorful dish with so-so flavor. I agree with most of the other reviewers. This must be the only risotto I've made that didn't call for garlic, and it was sorely missed. More wine (and no water mixed into the broth), more parmesan, and a combo of butter and oil to sautee onion and garlic together would probably help.

A waste. I should have listened to the other reviewers. This was bland and really tasteless. We love roasted beets and there was none of their delicious flavor in this dish.

I've made another version of this recipe where you shred the beets after they are roasted. It integrates their color and flavor much better.

It was a beautiful color, but i couldn't help but feel that it was a waste of some perfectly delicious roast beats. The beats didn't add much to the flavor of the rissoto, so save yourself the trouble.

Agree with the posting to add garlic (4 giant cloves...hey, I like the stuff) and some rosemary. To make it creamier, we added a couple of tablespoons of butter and increased the cheese to 2/3 of a cup. Also took the suggestion to use wine (total about 1 cup of Chardonnay in the whole recipe) and the rest of the liquid allin vegetable stock (no water...not much flavor in the stuff). Also, for us, it needed more salt. Does this count as an entirely new recipe yet? Serve with a spinach salad with a lemon garlic vinaigrette. The cat's pajamas!

I made this recipe with three varietals of small, spring beets. I used roughly 12 beets in total. The mixture of colors was impressive and attracted quite a bit of attention. Two additional comments: 1.) The recipe is rather bland. After several taste-tests while cooking, I couldn't help but add minced garlic and rosemary. 2.) I would suugest more stock and wine in lieu of the 3 cups of water. Again this would likely help with flavor. Enjoy!

I made this dish for a Christmas Eve celebration it was a big hit. Three people asked for the recipe, I even cheated and used canned whole beets. With it's bright red color, I'm making it for a Valentine party this weekend.

This dish was so-so. There was something about it that simply did not appeal to me. The only real flavor came from the beets themselves. The color, on the other hand, was really beautiful! If you need a really colorful side dish, this would be it; other than that, I wouldn't waste my time with the rice. I would much rather roast beets and then puree them with a little butter!
