I was really surprised by how good this was. Used dried tomatoes instead of the oil-packed and the results were great. It's a nice change from the usual beef burgers, but isn't so out there that people will turn their noses up at it because it's weird.

Good but had better.

very tasty and a welcomed change from the ubiquitious beef hamburgers. I used a 1/2 mixture of sage sausage (the ex country singers brand with the oversized ears)and good ground beef. BBQ was used with great results. Because the arty mixture is added at the end, this meal is perfect for the family with small children.

This was scrumptious, in my husband's words. I used beef and forgot the basil/tomato topping, but the artichoke/tomato/cheese topping really made these burgers special. A good start for grilling season!
