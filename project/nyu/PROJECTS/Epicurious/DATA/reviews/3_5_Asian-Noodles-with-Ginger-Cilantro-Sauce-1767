Loved this recipe on a hot summer CA day. I used crunchy peanut butter and it was fine. I quickly sauteed shrimp in soy and chili oil, in peanut oil, and added it over the noodles. Serve w crisp dry white wine. It needed half an extra jalapeno for a bit more kick. Served final dish with chopped scallion for a nice finish.

Very easy and fast. I added chicken and broccolini and called it dinner.

This flavor is excellent, it was a hit with my family. I substituted Tamari sauce instead of soy sauce. Super fast to make and a great side for fresh fish.

Wicked recipe! I would serve this warm, right after tossing it with the sauce. I used strips of fried ham to enhance the flavor (usually old fashioned or honey ham does wonders) with sweetness of the ham. If you serve this cold you'll notice that the peanut butter sauce isn't smooth and makes the noodles hard to eat. You definitely should nuke this a bit in the microwave to warm it up and melt the sauce.

Trader Joe's sells asian noodles with a green ginger-cilantro sauce in the refrigerated section -- they are fabulous. I was trying to duplicate that as closely as possible with this recipe since the ingredients are very close. For whatever reason, this sauce was very bitter -- the cilantro seemed "peppery" and lost the cilantro flavor once it was placed in a food processor. I didn't give up easily. I re-made the sauce finely chopping the cilantro by hand and adding honey. It was much better that way, but still not as good as Trader Joe's...I'm not sure what was missing.

Now, keep in mind I'm just learning to cook (but, I have been eating my whole life). Yet, it's very possible I didn't follow the recipe right. The things I didn't like about it were it's polarized hot and cold properties. The cilantro was too strong and the hot spicy peppers didn't mix well with the cold cilantro. My husband hated it. I was hoping this dish would be akin to a good pesto dish, but it did not live up to my dreams! I would try it again just to see if I could make it better. The only thing that made it decent was some added nuts to the dish.

Very goood. I stir fried some vegetables first and then added soft pre-cooked Chinese egg noodles. I added the sauce at the end. Delicious!

I did double the recipe and it was the perfect amount. I also added boiled shrimp - very wonderful and easy recipe - will do it again. My family couldn't believe that I could make something like this - they were very impressed!

This is a great dish. I don't double the sauce recipe because I don't see this as needing to be "saucy" It has amazing flavor. I stir fry little strips of carrot, zuchinni, red pepper and tofu and add it to the noodles just before serving. I don't serve it cold. It is an outstanding dish.

We topped these noodles with shrimps sauteed in a chilli-garlic sauce which really added some zing. It's a great summer dish and we'll definitely make it again.

From previous cooks' suggestions, I doubled the sauce and it still wasn't enough. But it was still good. I added one large clove of garlic, and used water, instead of broth. My kids loved it, and next time I make it, I'll make it a little more 'saucey'.

Loved this!! Needed a bit more punch - maybe another half jalapeno? Try it with some lettuce and a grilled chicken breast marinated in the same sauce - yum!

Very good with a few additions. I doubled the sauce recipe (next time I might even triple it), and added a tablespoon or so of sesame oil to the sauce. Also, I didn't have a jalapeno chili so I used a few dashes of cayenne pepper instead. Then to the finished dish I added steamed snow peas, and sauteed chicken breast, red onions, red pepper, & mushrooms.

I liked this dish, but it didn't blow my socks off. I doubled the recipe like other reviewers have suggested and this was good. It just seemed like Asian pesto with cilantro instead of basil and spiciness instead of garlic. Unless you like cold dishes for dinner, I would serve it hot.

This is a very satisfying noodle side but only deserves the forks if the sauce volume is doubled to really get the flavours across.

Wonderful noodle dish! A great side to grilled pork. Also, very good leftover cold. Will be doing again and again!

We really liked this sauce, but when I placed it over originally dry,12 oz. of cooked udon, it was lost. I will double the sauce the next time. I added pan steamed boneless chicken thighs on top and that was very good. As a side, we stir-fried a sliced red bell pepper, chopped napa cabbage and baby bok choy with a little oil, minced garlic and soy sauce. It will be a great meal with more sauce.

An excellent and simple recipe. I use a mortar and pestle instead of food processer as it brings out the flavors better and I add lemongrass and a clove of garlic.

This was a great dish! In order to make it less work intensive i didn't put any of the ingrediants in the food processor. I also sauteed (or stir fried) the ginger with garlic, snow peas, mushrooms and peppers. I served it hot that night and has a cold salad the next day. Both were wonderfully satisfying meals.

I've made this recipe numerous times for guests and have gotten rave reviews each time. I serve it with sliced grilled chicken breast over angel hair pasta with a side of crusy bread. A serving for 4 requires doubling the recipe. Delicious!

verging on 4 forks for its simplicity. a real blast of ginger and coriander!!! better with spiralli pasta as it soaks up the sauce better - each mouthful is a new experience!!!
