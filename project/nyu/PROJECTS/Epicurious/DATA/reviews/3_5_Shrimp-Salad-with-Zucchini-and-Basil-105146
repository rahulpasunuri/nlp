This was excellent! I agree with many reviewers about varying the ingredients, and serving style. The dressing is perfect as is, I added extra cayenne pepper for bite. I mixed cucumber, shrimps, bell peppers, red onion in the dressing and served it on a bed of lettuce. Crisp and bright flavours, great summer evening dish!

This was a big hit with my family. As others suggested, I sauted the zukes and shrimp in garlic oil and used only 1/4 c. in the dressing. I also used 2 ears of fresh corn.

This is a delicious salad for a summer lunch. I made it as written, except that I put in only half the required oil and it was plenty. The combination of capers and red peppers give it a nice bite and and a distinctive flavor.

Yummy idea. I actually made this with the suggestions from "cook from BC, 10/03/06" and then added corn and avocado as well. I used half the oil, also less red pepper flakes. I think the beauty of this recipe is the flexibility- use what you have on hand or like, still will be good. I'm considering a cilantro/feta version for next time, also liked the green onions suggestion.

really good. We added crispy roasted potatoes to ours and used feta instead of the parm.....loved it!

Half the dressing recipe is adequate and we liked less crushed red pepper than the 1/2 teaspoon that the recipe recommends. We enjoyed lettuce and fresh basil from our Farmers' Market rather than the packaged variety.

I wonder, how do the Bon Appetit editors and chefs feel when changes are made? because the comments made this a 4+ fork rating. Yes, saute the shrimp and zucchini in chili or sesame oil, add onion and garlic to that and not just in the dressing. And yes, lessen the oil in the dressing by a third. I also used just a small amount of red pepper and glad I did, or it would have overwhelmed the dish. But what a combination of flavors, fresh basil was a must, and the dressing was wonderful. Avocado would have also been a great addition to the salad. A definite keeper.

I sauteed the shrimp and added cooked corn which had been cut off of two ears. It was a great addition!

I didn't have basil so I used parsley instead. After reading the other reviews about too much oil, I mixed together the lemon and mustard, then whisked in enough oil to taste, then added the capers, pepper and green onion (didn't feel like peeling a shallot). Even with these changes, it was wonderful. I'll definitely try it again with basil.

I used a bit less oil as suggested. This was really good, somehow the shrimp flavor infuses the zucchini in a good way.

Very tastey. Cleaning shrip takes some time, but everything else is quick. Didn't use all the dressing, but saved the rest for another salad. Added slighty steamed esparagus to greens.

Very good and easy to make. I did sautee the shrimp and zucchini instead of boiling and added mushrooms since I had them. Added the dressing then topped the greens while still warm, yummy! Also added some kalamata olives which went really well with the dressing. A very versatile recipe.

I added parmesan right to the dressing and a little lemon zest to give it a little more kick. Poach the shrimp in a court bouillion for an amazing flavor. Great recipe

Flavours wonderful. Saute the shrimp and zucchini with oil, red pepper flakes, garlic and onions. Reduce oil by at least 1/3 - way too oily. Placed shrimp & zucchini into dressing, then poured dressing over lettuce while still slightly warm.

Great recipe! Healthy, delicious and pretty quick to make. I was able to save some time by getting the fish counter at Whole Foods to peel and devein the shrimp for me. Pair this with a bowl of gazpacho for a great summertime meal!

Surprizingly bland.

A summer delight! It beats traditional shrimp salad using mayo. I whisked 1 teaspoon of sugar into the dressing to cut the tart of the lemon juice. The dressing tastes great and I'd use for other salads and dishes as well.

This is a variant on a classic Italian combination (shrimp and zucchini), but adding the dressing and salad makes it a (light) meal by itself. Since it has so few ingredients, the taste completely depends on the quality of the shrimp and zucchini; if they're high quality and fresh, they shouldn't need too much more excitement! I find myself coming back to this one often.

I just tried this salad for the first time and wow!!!!!!! My husband loved it too! I did saute the shrimp and zucchini in a spicy chili oil instead of olive oil for an extra kick and it was wonderful! I plan on making this for a casual girls night out!

I was looking for a simple shrimp salad to make for myself at lunch and this was perfect. I changed a few things based on lack of ingredients. I didn't have lemon, so I used lime juice. I didn't have shallot, so I used garlic. I didn't have zukes, so I used halved red grapes. I added a little (1 tsp) organic honey to the dressing. And, I used red leaf lettuce. Delicious!

Thanks to another reviewer's suggestion, I sauteed the shrimp (which I sliced in half lengthwise) and zucchini in olive oil. I also kicked the dressing up a notch by adding more crushed red pepper, a bit of the caper juice and more shallot. Delish!!!

I have made this recipe several times and is always a hit. Have used raw shrimp and the pre- cooked shrimp, with no noticeable difference. Just a great luncheon dish or light summer supper.

Great recipe! Have made it many times and has always been a hit. Cook the Zucchini just for 30 secs. I have also added Avacados to the recipe, a definite plus!

My husband served this salad with Valentine's Day dinner. It was perfect! He made two changes to the recipe as stated: he used precooked shrimp instead of raw and avocados instead of zucchini. We stored the extra shrimp and avocados together and had leftovers the next day. I was surprised at how well they stored and the flavors were even better after marinating overnight. We plan to use the dressing recipe on grilled salmon as well.

The dressing was good on the greens but the shrimp themselves were bland. There are better things to do with shrimp. Also, too much zucchini for my taste.

Easy and delicious. I used cooked shrimp and followed the recipie from there. It was very tasty a good summer dinner.

i was really surprised at how underwhelmed i was with this. perhaps if i make it again i will zip the dressing through the cuisinart to expose more of the flavor. it was good- just not as zippy as i thought it would be.

I also sauteed the shrimp and zucchini in a little olive oil instead of boiling. Worked great. Flavors were wonderful together. Served as main course with warm French bread. Yummy.

What a wonderful simple recipe. I sauteed the shrimp and zuccchini in olive oil instead of boiling and ate them warm on the salad. The dressing was very good. Everyone raved about this dish! I will definitely make this again.

I made this without the capers and only ended up adding half of the dressing to the greens. The only that can ruin a good salad is too much dressing. Other than that the salad was wonderful.

This salad is fabulous as written and the flavor combination is perfect. I have made this MANY times and is requested by friends and family. I usually prepare as is but have used hearts of romaine for the greens and substituted grilled marinated salmon (equal parts maple syrup/soy sauce on this site)for the shrimp. Really, really good!

When starting to assemble, I thought with the capers, basil, red pepper flakes and shallots that this salad would have a lot of impact....but something was definitely missing. Maybe something as simple as garlic. I don't know, but this salad did nothing for us....and wouldn't make it again with some improvisation.

Flavors are wonderful. I added scallops and grilled the seafood and zucchini on a wok over the grill. Served veggies and seafood warm over the salad instead of cooled. Salad is filling and the sauce (dressing) is amazing.

Nice and easy summer recipe. A very pretty and colorful salad. It served 2 for a dinner. I served with 'Baked Baguette with Lemon Garlic Butter' from BA Aug. 1999 - I had a lemon theme going here. I cheated and used frozen shrimp.

The second time I made this I reduced the oil by half, skipped the zucchini and grilled the shrimp and it was even better!

We really liked this salad too. The dressing was great! I think next time however, I will skewer and grill the shrimp rather than boiling them (Or even maybe saute them on the pan)

Tasty, light, and quick enough for a hot summer weeknight dinner, yet satisfying even for hearty appetites. Didn't have zucchini on hand, so substituted chunks of fresh avacodos. Yummy! Will next be trying the grilled steak salad from the same issue...

This is a very flavorful shrimp salad. The parmesan cheese puts the final touch on it! I think you should try the "Spicy Shrimp Salad" from June 2000. It is so much better. Both are delicous, easy summer meal ideas.

Yummy. Fresh basil makes just about anything taste good. The previous suggestion about grilling the shrimp sounds like a good one. I'll try it.

Wonderful and easy summer dish, but I highly recommend grilling the shrimp (I marinated the shrimp briefly in a bit of the "dressing" prior to grilling). I have made this twice already.
