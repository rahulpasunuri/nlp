I added strawberries and almonds, used honey mustard instead of dry. turned out great!

From the feedback of other reviewers, I made some changes, notably: skipped the avocado (I'd rather save some calories for the bacon!), used shallots instead of red onion, and my vinaigrette was made up of olive oil, a tablespoon of bacon drippings, some honey, lemon juice, honey mustard, Dijon mustard, some diced crystallized ginger, and salt and pepper. I warmed the dressing before serving and it was fantastic.

Delicious! I left out the onions, and tossed in some almonds for crunch. The dressing is fabulous and the whole salad was a fresh and yummy accompaniment to Spicy Eggplant Pizza(also from this site). A definite keeper!

This salad was great. I made it vegetarian and skipped the bacon. I only used half the oil called for, and it still made a delicious dressing, and there was plenty of it.

I was disappointed by this spinach salad. Given the positive reviews, I was expecting something outstanding. This wasn't it. Instead, it was not even as good as the spinach salad in the local pizza joint. Now, that pizza joint is a bit better than most. But still ... The rating reflects a salad that was ordinary, with no knock-out flavours. Even my son agreed it was nothing special.

The dressing was very good on any kind of spinach salad. I used apples, snap peas, and blue cheese with it and and it was great. Will keep it in the salad dressing file for other uses.

this is a great salad, very light and refreshing!! I did use 1/2 cup of olive oil vs. one cup of veg. oil and 1/4 of a red onion (I am not a fan of onion) Lightly coated the salad and served the extra dressing on the side, allowed everyone to add more if they wanted. Definitely going to make this again.

OK...Cookin' up a storm says: even before I read the reviews, I could not wrap my head around a cup of veggie oil nor powdered sugar ICK! Can you say Gagatrocious? I used a 1/4 c. grapeseed oil and 1/16 c. cane sugar which was absolutly wonderful. I used fresh ground ginger root and dijon mustard which along with the rest, did the trick for the dressing plus a touch of ground white pepper as well. I unabashedly and with complete disregard for the cholestrol conscious, used thick-cut, applewood bacon and some hard boiled egg too. (gasp) I agree, the avacado was a big, "so what" and other than adding texture, didn't do much. Maybe mine weren't peak fresh/ripe??? OH yeah, keep the purple onions separate so if you have leftovers, they won't overpower the whole thing the next day. Just throw on top at serve time. Overall: tasty, crisp, light but filling.

I liked this recipe and will make it again, but with a different dressing. I would have preferred more of a sweet, tangy dressing. Next time I will try it with an olive oil, raspberry vinegar, and honey dressing. The apples, avocado, and bacon in the salad were excellent.

I had to make this salad when I came home from the farmers market with fresh spinach, red onions and gala apples. It was sooo worth it. Very delicious, as someone else mentioned it tasted like you could have been eating at a nice restaurant. I had to alter the dressing a bit because I was lacking some ingrediants. I substituted 1/8 c honey for the powdered sugar, a few dashes of hot sauce for the paprika, fresh garlic and 1/4 c olive oil and a few tablespoons of the bacon drippings for the 1 c vegetable oil. I served grilled chicken on top and grilled garlic bread on the side for a delicious dinner.

This is not only the best spinach salad I have ever tasted, but perhaps in the top five faves of all my salads ever! Made it for guests in Provence last month and they positivley inhaled it. Try adding about two tablespoons of Grand Marnier to the dressing for a bit of a kick! Yum!

The best spinach salad by far.

What a wonderful WONDERFUL salad! Since there were only two of us for dinner, I halved the dressing ingredients, substituted one teaspoon fresh grated ginger for dried ginger which I didn't have on hand and used 9oz of the spinach, 1 apple and 1 avocado plus 4 slices of bacon and 1/4 cup red onion. Sauteed some large scallops to serve on the side ... great meal with a good chardonnay! I'll do this again and again ... my husband raved and he is very spoiled when it comes to home cooking.

Seriously - this is by far the best salad I have EVER tasted. I absolutly love everything about it. I love it so much that I've now made it 3 times.

I made this as part of a Valentine's Day dinner and it was a hit. My fiancee (who is not big into spinach salads) raved about it. I did not have any apple cider vinegar on hand, so used white wine vinegar instead, but I think the apple cider vinegar would have given the dressing more flavor. I will also agree with other reviewers suggestions and go with half the amount of oil next time because I found the dressing a little heavy. Other than that, the salad was simple, but delicious. Will make again.

Been making this for years. Started using the pre-cooked bacon chunks (not Bacos, the actual bacon pieces) for less fat. Just as good. Great for pot lucks.

Perfect salad for entertaining! I loved it! The sweetness combined with the salty so well. I added a tad bit of ginger to my bacon as it cooked and I used Applewood Smoked bacon. I think though it should have more avocado and less onion. But, it was so yummy!!!!

I thought this dressing was really great. I mean, the salad was great too, but I often make a batch of this dressing just to have around. I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil in the dressing and turkey bacon instead of pork bacon in the salad.

Loved it! Loved it! LOVED IT! Great spinach salad recipe. I made this salad for a mother and daughter tea party and everyone loved it even the young ladies (10 year olds). The sweetness of the dressing and saltiness from the bacon gave this salad a wonderful flavor. My husband enjoyed it not only for the great taste but for it nutritional value. Thanks soo much for creating such a great salad. Definitely will make again & again.

We made this delightful salad for a pre-fourth brunch. It was a big hit. We swapped the 1 cup of vegie oil with 3/4 a cup of extra virgin light olive oil, added feta cheese and diced walnuts. we served bacon on the side (vegans, what you gonna do) and went light on the onion. We also added a little spicy arugula for a kick. WOW! we didn't have any left so we had to come home and make it again for ourselves the next day.

"I must say, this salad is really delicious". This was the comment of my "meat and potato" loving son. I made half a recipe but still cut down on the oil and spices, especiallly the paprika.

This salad was really scrumptious. I was a little doubtful about a dressing with powdered sugar, but it's very good (I wonder if you could make it with granulated sugar dissolved in the vinegar before adding the oil...will try next time). It made a boatload of dressing, so I'll have to pick up more spinach, etc. Was delicious with pan-roasted chicken breasts.

Rating: 3
Unusual and delightful dressing. I used only 1/2 cup of olive oil as others suggested and that was plenty. Otherwise followed recipe exactly. This could be a meal in itself. Served it with the chicken with garlic sauce recipe from this site. It was a good match. Served it to company and they loved it too.

Rating: 4
This was amazingly delicious! Due to the large amount of resultant dressing, we (just two of us) have happily had this salad three times in the past week. It is sooooo tasty. Followed other user's recommendations and reduced the amount of oil (olive oil was great) onion, used wet mustard and fresh ginger, and granulated sugar ground with a mortar/pestle. Also to keep it healthy, I used turkey bacon -what a great way to sneak in fake bacon - the dressing is so delicious you don't miss the fat in the bacon. You simply can't go wrong with this recipe. We had it again tonight over baby organic greens and I added candied pecans, tomatoes and crumbled gorgonzola -a salad I would have easily paid $12 for in a restaurant. YUM!

Rating: 4
My husband raved over this! I, too, used 1/2 cup oil (half olive oil, half vegetable). I also used 1/2 a clove crushed garlic and wet mustard in the dressing. For a finishing touch, I toasted sliced almonds for extra crunch and flavor. Delicious!

Incredibly delicious! Very sweet. I paired it with a pork loin and it was perfect. I will make this recipe again and again!

Rating: 4
Excellent, with many suggestions from previous cooks incorporated. I halved the entire dressing recipe, not just the oil, and used olive oil, superfine sugar -- a compromise between confectioner's and standard granulated -- a half-t. grated fresh ginger, and 3 hammer-crushed cloves of garlic. I also chose to use only 1 Gala apple(though next time would keep it to 2), as well as added only a few very thinly sliced pieces of red onion because I was afraid of a clash between the apple and onion (I'm not a fan of adding onions to various fruit salsas, etc.). I pan-grilled a half-pound of chicken -- it tastes great in this dressing -- and used some 4 oz. of turkey bacon to significantly cut down on fat content. Result is one of my very few 4-forks on this site...Next time I'd increase the amount of spinach in this salad since it loses some of its heft in refrigeration as leftovers, and I might add a chopped hard-boiled egg or two, since for me a spinach salad isn't really complete without'em.

This is great. Definitely reduce the oil to at least .5 cup. And absolutely add the "sweet and spicy candied pecans" recipe from this site. They made it!!

This is an excellent salad. I often add chicken to make it a main course meal. Would also be excellent with candied pecans. I too cut the oil in half when making the salad and still find the recipe makes more dressing then needed. Choose a sweet onion if available.

I don't believe I have ever seen my husband or daughter eat spinach...until this salad! Both asked for seconds! VERY tasty! The paprika adds just the tiniest bit of "burn" (not enough to put off a kid) which complements the sweetness of the sugar and savor of the bacon. I used half the oil as previous reviewers suggested. Also, the dressing is enough for a very large salad. Yum..this goes into the recipe box for sure!

Next time I'd cut the oil in half but otherwise it's wonderful. I added more apple and avocado along with some bbq'd chicken strips for a meal. Even a skeptic at the table (not believing in salad for dinner) was duly impressed and looks forward to seeing it again.

This recipe has already become a classic in our family...however(!), a couple of suggestions: lightening up on the oil takes nothing away from the flavor (recipe calls for quite a bit of oil); watch the spice ratio carfully in the dressing - too much of one flavor can really overpower this salad. I also add carmelized PECANS or walnuts for an extra flavor sensation! It's the "bomb" as someone put it!

Great recipe, but absolutely agree with comments about too much oil. Just follow their tips. I've used olive oil w/o it overpowering and definitely think FRESH ginger is necessary and prefer the spicy bright red paprika to the duller version. Have substituted the bacon out for a mix of grilled chicken (coated in paprika, salt and freshly ground black pepper) and roasted almonds or pecans. Absolutely yummy and useful for main course.

I liked this classic combination of salad ingredients, but the dressing tasted harsh and mismatched. I strongly recommend using granulated sugar instead of powdered, fresh mustard instead of dry, fresh ginger instead of ground. Harsh harsh harsh. I guess I really have moved away from dried ingredients towards fresh. And double the avocado and eliminate the oil! I skipped the red onion, since I personally dislike it.

This recipe is fantastic! The perfect combination of contrasts - salty, sweet, creamy, crunchy. I used only 1/2 cup of oil, slightly less sugar, dijon mustard, freshly grated ginger and 2 avocados. I can't wait to serve this as an alternative to my usual Caesar Salad at Thanksgiving.

I loved this salad and so did my husband. I agree many other reviewers that the amount of oil called for is way too much. I have the oil and used about 3/4 of the dressing on the salad. I also halfed the red onion. A whole onion would have been too strong. I also put in extra bacon and made this salad as the entire meal.

Rating: 4
Great recipe -- excellent to make when you're not sure how many people are going to show up -- it makes quite a bit. I halved the oil, which seemed to be plenty and used about 2/3rds of it on the salad. I prepared the dressing a couple of days in advance. Since I was putting it together in a boat galley & didn't want to cook, I used the Oscar Mayer ready-to-serve bacon and Perdue's prepared chicken. Dinner for 5 took 10 minutes!

Rating: 4
EXCELLENT combination of ingredients! I used 3/4 cup of vegetable oil and added 1 tablespoon of sesame oil to give the dressing more depth. Big difference! Also, I love ginger and I didn't hold back. I used at least 2 tablespoons of ground ginger. I have yet to try it with fresh ginger. The dressing is also tasty with fresh dijon mustard in lieu of the ground mustard. This salad is a huge hit with company!

This has to be one of my all time favorite salads. I have made it twice and will make again this weekend. At first it sounded a little odd, but the creamy avocado and crunchy apples is such a wonderful combination with the slightly sweet dressing. Love the bacon on top! YUMMM! Oh, I omitted the paprika. It made the apples look brown.

I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about, but this salad is GROSS. It is probably my biggest epicurious disappointment. I used less oil and less than half the dressing and it was just slimy. Ugh. I should have realized: apples do not go with avocados and powdered sugar does not go with any of the other ingredients in the dressing (which don't necessarily go with each other, either). Too bad because I was really craving a delicious spinach salad, and this is NOT it, despite all the rave reviews (which still have me completely baffled).

I made this salad for company as a side dish for a BBQ we were having. It was delicious and got rave reviews. I used the gala apples and they were a unique addtion to the salad.
