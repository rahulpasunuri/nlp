Great with the follow adjustments based on others suggestions and pantry limitations: 1) 8 bone in thighs trimmed of excess fat and skin; 2) 2 14oz cans of diced tomatoes in garlic, basil and oregano (out of plain); 3) 2 tbs garam masala instead of allspice, coriander and cinnamon; 4) grated orange peel instead of peeling it; 5) left out honey; 6) Used canola oil and only used 3 of the 6 tablespoons. Don't usually make this many changes the first time and then review, but I wanted others to know this has a great consistency and depth of flavor this way and was great over plain white rice. I think doubling the original recipe spices would work well too.

I agree with the cook from San Jose, I was underwhelmed by this recipe. For the amount of time and effort, and the interesting mix of ingredients, I was expecting more. You might be able to save something from this by a lot of tweaking, but I'm not sure it's worth the effort. I am being generous and giving it 2 forks, it was edible but not anywhere great. Also, drain the tomatoes, reduce the chicken broth, skip the olive oil at the end (it was already very greasy) and zest the orange. Good luck.

Our daughter & boyfriend made this for us. DELICIOUS! Served it with cous-cous - great for all that wonderful sauce. I would "zest" the orange peel next time.

I really wanted to like this recipe but the fact of the matter is I found it a bit bland. I know it seems crazy based on the sheer number of ingredients but when it came to flavor it was really missing something. I think I would have preferred more of a spice flavour than orange & tomato. I used boneless chicken breasts so maybe something was lost - I'm not sure. Not my favorite recipe.

This recipe was delicious. It is hearty enough to tweak here and there without upsetting the integrity of the dish. I used a whole chicken which I cut up because I prefer white meat. I didn't boil any onions, I just diced a large onion instead. It came out so flavorful. I was worried that it would be too watery as some reviewers said so I reduced the amount of tomatoes (I used crushed). I also did not add the extra oil at the end as all the reviewers reccommended. It was a perfect consistancy. I enjoyed the leftovers the next day as well!

Delicious and different! Made a double quantity with 14 thighs. Completed all the steps up to baking the evening before and put into my Crockpot. Substituted garam masala for the spices. Started it on high setting at noon the next day and had a wonderful dinner with the meat falling off the bones by 6:30 pm. Pulled off some of the juices, mixed in a little flour and returned it to the pot, making the sauce a little thicker. I did skip the last bit of oil, not necessary. Loved the sweet and tangy flavor, it went over very well!

The first night I made this, the glass lid to my dutch oven burst while cooking, so I had to throw it out, but it smelled wonderful. I kept the raisins and made it tonight. I did not add the olive oil at the end and drained the pan after browning the chicken. Didn't miss the oil and it was delicious.

One more note: next time, I will definitely skip the last 2 tablespoons of olive oil. It just wasn't necessary and floated on top of everything - making it look really oily. But otherwise, this was great!

Fantastic! I made it with a little less chicken than it called for (recipe calls for 12 pieces of chicken - 6 divided thigh/leg pieces, and I only used 9 small chicken pieces which was perfect.) I also didn't have small onions, so I just cut some larger ones up. My husband and I loved it! Served it over steamed brown rice with green beans on the side. I thought that the orange flavor was a little strong, but my husband disagreed. Not only did it taste good, but it made my whole house smell AMAZING! Will definitely make this again - probably for guests!

It is always a pleasure to hear WOW! at the table after the first taste. I cooked this exactly to the recipe with the single exception that I halved the number of chicken leg/thigh pieces and it still fed three of us with enough left over for 1 more portion. I served it with plain, boiled rice and since my family went back to the pot for more of the delicious juice, this was definitely not too liquid. As for the bitterness of the orange pith - you're supposed to peel the outer skin only! Each big strip of richly bitter-sweet orange was a tasty morsel in itself spectacular. Having tried this as a mid-week family meal, it will be coming to a dinner party near me soon!

Since other reviewers said this stew was too liquidy, I used half as much chicken broth & tomatoes as called for. I also used a rasp to grate the orange peel, thus avoiding the bitter pith. Next time I might use a bit less vinegar but all in all, it turned out very tasty.

I wasn't too excited about this recipe although the ingredients seemed interesting. If I made it again, I would skip the orange peel as it made it too bitter, and I would cut down on the allspice and cinnamon as it tasted too much like mulled wine. I made this dish with orzo which was a nice change from rice. I didn't use boiling onions as I wasn't sure what they were so I used a regular onion but didn't dice it as finely as it could have been. All in all, it was just okay and a little disappointing.

I had a big bag of frozen pearl onions I keep on hand for dishes like this, so I used those, worked fine. Used boneless breast meat, tho less in weight than recipe called for (tho kept the spice amounts!). Also nixed the broth. Once the initial sauce cooking was over, I fished out all the solids and added a little more water and half a bag of dried lentils and cooked them halfway, then threw the chicken and onions back in and continued the recipe from there. Cut out all oil except one tablespoon and used half the raisins (am dieting!). Chopped up the raisins halfway through soaking so they would distribute their sweetness more through the dish. Used moscatel vinegar cuz I had it, and subbed port wine for the white. Also added frozen green peas for final stage of cooking, which I just did in a covered pot on the stove, on very low. These additions satisfied my sense that the dish needed sweetness to enrich the flavors. Very yummy stew! Will make again with all kinds of vegetable and meat substitutions.

Wonderful flavor. I used regular onions and skinless, boneless chicken breasts. Since I used the chicken breasts, the cooking time (oven) was decreased to 1/2 hour. When it was done I removed the meat, onions, etc. and I added more honey and I boiled down the sauce. This dish was wondeful- my husband loved it!

I was really impressed with this dish, and my family couldn't get enough. I didn't have red wine vinegar so I substituted balsamic, and used chopped onions, but otherwise was faithful to the recipe. Really easy and delicious!

Love this dish. There is too much sauce, so I boiled down it a little afterwards. I think it needs more of the spices b/c it is real subtle. Added some chickpeas. Next time will add some red pepper flakes. Served it with couscous.

Ditto to using chopped onions instead small boiling onions; and to using peel of 3/4 of an orange. I added sliced rounds of a sweet potato and served it on its own (no additional starch). Too much liquid? Yes, but its soo good. My solution for next time: double the chicken thighs and serve a larger crowd or freeze the leftovers!

I was looking for something quick and easy so I the ingredients (with some substitutions) and threw them in a pot, brought to a boil and finished in the oven. I substituted lime juice for vinegar, no oil, regular onions, fire roasted tomatoes, lime peel for orange, and water for wine. I also added drained canned chick peas at the end. It was delicious. The next time I make it (which is tonight) I will reduce the liquid. It was a little too watery.

made this for the second time last night. everyone agreed it was so delicious and requested the recipe. i followed the suggestion of just using regular onions cut in pieces, and this was so much easier than dealing with all the little onions. last time there was a little too much orange going on, so i did about 3/4 of the peel. i did do chicken breast chunks again rather than the leg/thighs - the chunks ended up so juicy and tender, and it cut the cooking time in half. and like last time, i put the browned onions followed by the browned chicken pieces in the crockpot, boiled the sauce up, and poured that on top of it all. left it in the crockpot on high for about half an hour, then added the raisins. wonderful flavor and really very simple.

Made this recipe for my family of 4 on a cold Wyoming snowy winter day. My husband and I loved it and will make it again for adults when we are craving a unusal chicken stew. The kids however ages 5 and 9 were a little dicey with the dinner. They ate it but had to be bribed with getting dessert. Overall a great meal when served with basmati rice

Excellent. Bulk cooking onions are fine instead of boilers.

I have made this recipe a number of times and each time I receive rave reviews. I make only a couple of adjustments, instead of pearl onions I use sweet onions cut up and I always use raisins. I will continue to make it

I love greek food and this was no exception. The only change I made was to use all legs (no thighs). The chicken was juicy and the sauce once cooked down was delicious. Next time I think I will serve this with rice or Quinoa.

Apart from the chicken, the vegetables and the sauce were great. The chicken was a bit bland and dry. Next time I'll marinate the chicken first, and pan-fry it for less time as suggested.

Loved it! A wonderful change of pace. The combination of spices proved delightful! I prepared this dish for my husband and our friends -- all of us agreed with the exception of Harry, who suggested 1/2 stick of cinnamon instead of one stick. Whatever Harry!!

We liked this a lot. I used the cut-up chicken the first time. The second time, I used boneless, skinless thighs, and chopped brown onion because I them readily available. I didn't have to go to the store, and it turned out great. Good for a cold day!

This is delicious. We've made it a couple of times already. To save time we substituted regular onions for pearl onions, and it didn't impact the taste.

This is a unique chicken dish. All the flavors blend well. Everyone loved it and I would make it again.

I thought this dish was very flavorful. There were a few too many pearl onions and you may want to cut them down just a bit. I would like to serve this over rice next time or at least with some crusty bread for sopping up the wonderful juices.

Recipe sounded wonderful, but was cautious due to reviews. I added the raisins and vinegar sooner than the recipe called for to let the flavors combine more. We enjoyed it very much over orzo. My husband loved it and wants it again.

I love a good chicken tagine...this is not one of them. There are better Moroccan style dishes elsewhere.

I was excited upon reading the redipe, but was disappointed in the final result. The flavors simply didn't come together and were not rich or satisfying. If the flavor combination appeals to you, I highly recommend the similarly-spiced but far superior Chicken with Aromatic Tomato Sauce, also on Epicurious.
