Used venison loin and baby bellas. It was outstanding. Easy, quick, elegant.

Quite good, tasty. Made with chicken since my husband does no eat beef.

Exceptional! I couldn't find morels in my supermarket, so I used a mix of porcini and shitake instead. Worked perfectly, which worked out fine. The sauce was wonderful! I'll definitely save this recipe for the future. Delicious! Just in case- I found this mushroom thesaurus online. A good tool for when you need a mushroom substitute. http://www.foodsubs.com/Mushroom.html

Excellent!!! I replaced the fresh tarragon for dried (1tsp) and shallots (2) for the green onions, since I didn't have those. Soaked the morels in beef broth. Amazing dish! Worth the cost of the morels. Will definitively make it again.

this is the best preparation for filet mignon i've ever made. the pan was very hot and i got a good sear on both sides but the steaks were still a little rare for me so i stuck them in the oven at 400 for 10 min and they were perfectly medium-rare. i also subbed chanterelles for morels and it was to die for. served with scalloped potatoes and fennel.

Delicious. Times and proportions perfect. I'll make this every time a friend shows up with yard morels!

Very good. Followed the recipe to the letter and the family loved it. Also served with the Yukon Gold mashed spuds and they were a good accompaniment but I think any type of spuds would work. The 1.5 oz. of dried morels may be a bit much for 2 servings so make sure you look at the amount inside the package when you buy it to ensure you don't over-spend by over-buying. These mushrooms aren't cheap.

This was a good recipe for a simple yet elegant dish. The one change I made was to sear the filet in a hot pan/ skillet and then transfer it to the over to finish. This allows you to avoid the problem of "bitter sauce" that arises when the fond (brown bits leftover from the steak) burns after cooking the steaks to medium rare in the pan the entire time.

I don't what happened. The resulting sauce on the meat was very bitter and not good at all. It basically ruined 2 good filets. I couldn't find morels so I used Porcinis. I'm a rookie at this stuff, but I was expecting a pretty good dish from the reviews. Instead, it was terrible.

I made this as the entree for our wedding anniversary menu. It was quite elegant hiding that it was so simple to prepare. More time for a leisurely dinner and good conversation.

Turned out delicious, I cooked the beef longer as I like meat medium/well done. Great flavor!! Fine dining 5 star cooking :)

This recipe is incredibly good. Deserves a 5 STAR. A fantastic recipe for two but I will definitly prepare this for my next dinner party. Quick but impressive. Flavor was to die for.The cooking time suggested for the tenderloin was perfect.

Super easy with a rich, elegant taste. I made tenderloin medallions- cooked very quickly and after the sauce wes ready, I returned them briefly to the pan with the sauce to absorb more flavor. A really great dish with restaurant-quality taste and plate appeal.

Easy, delicious and impressive! My guests raved about the "gourmet" quality of the dish and couldn't believe I made it look so easy. I'll definitely make it again soon.

The best dish i've cooked in months! Very rich. I served it with asparagus and cous cous.

Amazing. The only change I made was to use a dried wild mushroom blend. It was delicious. I loved the sauce so much, next time I will double it. I served it with Parsleyed Buttercream Potatoes with Saffron. Yum!

I used .5 oz of Morels, .5 oz of chanterelles, and sauteed a bunch of fresh criminis. The resulting sauce was delicious!

My husband is incredibly hard to please and he though this was very good. That is essentially a 6 star rating.

Excellent. My husband typically prefers BBQ but he liked this as well. I also hydrated the morels in beef stock to get more flavor and used sweet Marsala instead of dry. A keeper.

This recipe was great, but instead of using beef stock to hydrate the morels, I hydrated them in red wine. That red wine then went into the sauce as well, which made it even better! Highly recommended.

I made this for my husband and I. He really craves red meat, I generally do not so I have to dress it up to eat it. I did not have morels, but did have baby bellas. We loved it and will make it again.

Haven't tried this yet but would like tomorrow. Before I do this, what would be a great side dish?

Rating: 3
This was yummy, but I think next time I'm going to go with a variety of wild mushrooms instead of just the morels.

This was one of the best meals I have ever cooked. I used fresh basil instead of tarragon because my local grocer doesn't carry fresh tarragon. Delicious and impressive!

Rating: 4
This was quick to make a spectacular on the plate! The store was out of tarragon so I used rosemary, sage and marjoram instead. It's a keeper.

Delicious! I made it for Valentine's Day and it was a great success - the sauce was lovely. I substituted dried porcini mushrooms since I couldn't find morels, and I used beef broth instead of the rather bland soaking liquid for the sauce. An easy and elegant meal.
