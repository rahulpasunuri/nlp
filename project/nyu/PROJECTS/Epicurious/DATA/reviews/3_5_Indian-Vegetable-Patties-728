I was not impressed by this at all. If I make it again I would use less cilantro (maybe).

I made this (1/2 size patties)as part of Indian finger food buffet. The smaller patties allowed the batter to hold together easily. The flavoring is good but mild so could be increased if guests are used to stronger spicing. Good at room temp or reheated in oven. Major Grey is a bit sweet to my liking so used alternate mango chutney. Would definitely make again.

Pretty good -- I didn't have cilantro, which I'm sure would have helped. I did salt the grated vegetables, let them sit in a sieve, and then squeezed out excess moisture. Mine held together fine, and I think this must have helped.

OK, so some people don't like these...my family LOVES them. The flavor is authentic, I can't imagine wt the off taste might be, perhaps it was something rancid in a previous reviewers kitchen. If you like indian, mexican, or anything with different flavors, these are great. I lost the recipe and went looking on epicurious,feel like i found a lost expensive piece of jewelry!!

I liked these and I think the basic recipe is pretty versatile. I used a can of black beans instead of potato, and extra jalapeno. I put it all in a Cuisinart, and they held together fine, especially after an hour in the fridge. I ended up broiling them. Served with Greek yogurt. Good for lunch the next day.

Really yummy! Used cornmeal to lightly coat before frying as other reviewers suggested. A little bit of time goes in, but they cook really quickly. Made them for a dinner party with Indian chicken kebabs also on the site. YUM!

I rarely find a food that I don't like, but these patties are one of the few. As everyone said, they don't hold together, but that is a minor problem. I found the flavor to be off. It was this strange starchy/bitter aftertaste that nothing would solve. I couldn't even bring myself to eat the leftovers.

I only loosely followed this recipe - using an assortment of grated root veggies - potatoes, parsnip, beet, carrot, onions and garlic, glued together using the ratio of flour and egg in this recipe - in other words, four about 4 cups of grated veggies, I used one egg and about a 1/3 c of flour. I then broiled them for 8 minutes on a side, using the low setting on the broiler. They came out fabulous-sweet, with crunchy bits mmm, and are pretty much non-fat.

Has anyone baked/broiled these to make a healthier version?

very nice way to use up bits of leftover veggies

These are fab for the family. Everyone loved them. Don't freak out when the batter looks like it won't hold together, and don't make the same mistake I made and add extra flour and egg -- mine would have been even better if they weren't so doughy. Also, if I have gram flour in the house next time, I will definitely use it, and probably more spice.

These were tasty. I made them for an Indian-themed pot luck and they were well received. I served them with cucumber-mint raita from this site and with the recommended Major Grey chutney. I did ease the preparation by using the food processor for shredding the carrots and potatoes, then switching to the steel blade to process the onions, spinach, cilantro, garlic, chile, and ginger. It was easier to form the patties after refrigerating the whole mixture for a while, and I dusted them with a little flour before frying, which gave them a crisp exterior. I'll be making these a lot.

I've made these numerous times. My latest, healthier iteration of them: Pulse bag of spinach lightly, pulse again with grated carrot, cooked bulgar wheat, chopped onion, minced garlic & jalapeno, cumin, cilantro and sesame tahini (to bind instead of eggs). Form patties, roll in cornmeal and pan fry. Binding is easier if all your ingredients are cold from the refrigerator. I tend to go heavier on the vegetables and lighter on my starch bulker (bulgar wheat, or potato), sometimes add chickpeas or lentils or black beans. Don't over process, if necessary, move to bowl and mix there otherwise you'll get a mushy mess (which is still good if rolled in cornmeal or bread crumbs and fried). I serve with baked sweet potato fries and coleslaw w/lemon/lime juice, cilantro, O&V, cumin. Can cook them on pancake griddle. YUM, these burgers are great!

This is a time consuming recipe to make but is very tasty. It is a nice entree to add to a dinner party for a vegetarian guest. I doubled the recipe and also added 1 can of drained black beans and doubled the jalapeno and cilantro. I lightly blended 1/2 of the mixture in the food processor to make it stick together better.

This recipe had great flavor. I omitted the ginger and peas since I didn't have any on hand. It still turned out delicious. I added extra flour and potatoes like others. I didn't have time to chill it, but it still held together. Will make this again!

I made this recipe for an Indian themed dinner, along with red lentil soup and Indian baked rice, and it was everybody's favorite. I added more flour (about 2/3 cup), and reduced the chilling time, as the crowd was getting hungry. I used a food processor only for the carrots and potatoes, and hand cut everything else. I didn't have a problem with the patties staying together, but I did use the two-spatula method, along with a good quality nonstick pan. Next time I will add another jalapeno, along with the extra flour, and put the patties directly in the pan without chilling.

this was a pretty nice recipe. A little labor intensive though, but that is the nature of this item. Not sure why the previous reviewer expected pakoras: pakoras are veggie slices dipped in chickpea flour batter and deep fried. This recipe is more like a tikki: a patty style dish.

Rating: 1
I was hoping that these would be similar to vegetable pakoras but they weren't. I would not make them again.

I was cooking an Indian feast for a birthday party and decided to give these a go. After reading the other reviews I added extra potato AND and two extra eggs (as the mixture was looking a little too wet) and also refrigerated them for over an hour. While the end result was very tasty, I found it extremely difficult to keep the patties together while frying.

I made this for a party and they were the first things to go. I agree that the yogurt is a must. Great for all of us vegetarians. They weren't even greasy. The oil does have to be hot enough so that they don't fall apart.I did follow previous advice and used extra potato. I agree it does help it stay together. You MUST refridgerate them for at LEAST an hour so they dont fall apart. I would make them again. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

These were as good as what I've had in good Indian restaurants in NY and Boston. I made them exactly per the recipe, except I significantly reduced the jalapeno (it would be quite spicy if you use the whole pepper). Also, the yogurt topping is an absolute must. The chutney is a nice extra -- Trader Joe's sells a good one.

I thought these were very good. I added 1/2 extra egg to help them stick together and didn't have a problem. I served a table full of indians and they all approved.

I took the advice of several other reviewers and modified the recipe so that the patties would hold together. I added an extra egg, a slice of crumbled bread, and a larger potato. I also added more of the spices and cooked the patties longer than 4 minutes per side. They turned out WONDERFUL! I had no problem whatsoever holding them together. (Also, I used a nonstick pan. This is probably important.) I would DEFINITELY make these again!

Ok, I lied. I did not make this exact same recipe, but I am Indian and I have tried similar recipes. The problem with the binding is the amount of potatoes used. Use an extra potato or two and adjust the seasoning accordingly. Believe me, the potatoes will just absorb the water from the carrots and other veges and the patties will stay put. And I don't use egg even.

We tried these one night, but the finished version fell short of the mark. I, too, had trouble with the patties holding together; left them to brown and they were in danger of burning and sticking. And I'm an experienced cook! The tastes just didn't come together. Will try again because I idea still intrigues me. Maybe I just had a bad cooking day.

Rating: 3
My family loved these! I added an extra egg and bread crumbs to help the patties to bind. Also, I found that (like another reviewer) if you leave the patties alone to brown thoroughly on one side before flipping them that they hold together well. I do not recommend using a food processor as it turns the veggies to pulp. Fried pabulum, anyone? No thanks. Served with Garam Marsala lentil soup over basmati rice, accompanied by cilantro, yogurt, and limes. Cool mangos for dessert. YUM!

I would definitely be giving this a higher rating if the patties had held together. I tried refrigerating them on baking sheets the evening before, but they just fell apart when it was time to fry them.

I love vegetable patties, plain and as a burger,but best served with a dollop of tamarind sauce and a dash of hot,spicy, green chillies and coriander sauce and lastly, sprinkled with some finely sliced onions for crunch!(if you like, add very fine julienne of carrots and/or white radish and/or finely shredded cabbage with the onions!!) I would add, for binding purposes, a slice or two of crumbled fresh bread, to the patti mixture.I should think, this would make the patti mixture bind well.I would add a little garam masala, to the ingredients. A little cayenne pepper too,if you like.Also some lemon juice will zip it up!I always make my patties this way and enjoy them thoroughly.This above recipe seemed somewhat bland and unexciting to me. Bye and happy cooking!

Outstanding. The house smelled amazing. Further to the other reviewers' comments on pureeing, you don't have to, just let them firm up in the fridge (I left them in overnight) and they will fry up beautifully. The only draw back: time consuming chopping; but, they were so good, I'd have to go to the trouble anyway.

This is one of the recipes I make most frequently. They are delicious, and using a food processor they can be made in less than twenty minutes. Nice because I usually have all the ingredients on hand, except the spinach, which they are fine without. I serve with yogurt cheese and tamarind chutney, as well as applesauce, which may not be Indian, but it works.

Tried it with sweet potatoes and found them especially good as meatless hamburger patties. I squish them out flatter to resemble hamburgers so that they get crispier edges, served on a bed of shredded lettuce with a dollop of mayonnaise between a hamburger bun. Doesn't work as well with russets, which make the patties more like vegetable cutlets that are good on its own.

I made this recipe two years ago for a baby shower. It along with the cheddar chutney tea cakes were a huge hit. I offered to cook for my Mother for Mother's Day - and she recalled these vegetable patties and requested them again. The secret to keeping them together is to drop them into the hot oil, pat them down lightly and leave them until they're completely cooked on that side then flip them.

we cooked this for a monthly supper club, and everyone love it (although we think they should be called samosas (spelling?) a more typical name. we did adjust for the other comments, adding 2 T flour and the extra egg (total of 2 eggs) they held together well and were wonderful.

I will give this another try, but with significant flavor modifications. Like another reviewer, the taste lacked a certain depth. I didn't add a chili pepper, and I should have. Next time, I'll omit the cilantro and cumin and replace with... a shot of Tabasco or Worcestershire? A dollop of Dijon? A pinch of cayenne? I also had major difficulty with sticking together... I added another egg, but it still didn't seem to work?!? Plus, be sure to use a food processor!

The patties have a nice flavor -- but something was missing. I'd make them again and experiment to find the missing ingredient.

I also found it difficult to stick but added another egg and the problem was solved. On another occasion used sweetcorn (creamed) instead of kernels and found it adhered well
