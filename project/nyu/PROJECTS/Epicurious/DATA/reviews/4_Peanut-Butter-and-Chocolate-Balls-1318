EXCELLENT and RICH! I used the adjustments in the 12/19/09 review by mtgoode from Menlo Park, CA, and it was perfecto. One tablespoon was pretty big, so I plan to make them 1/2 size so they fit in paper candy cups.

My girlfriend and I decided to make homemade candies as xmas presents last year. This recipe was the favorite among everyone! The corn flakes add both a fantastic flavor while also lending a pleasant texture. If you follow this, you won't be disappointed.

This recipe was perfect! I made an assortment of cookies from the 25 days of Christmas recipes on epi.com and this was EVERYONE'S favorite! Seriously - everyone.

Like many others, I used the recipe from Manchester, NH. I did find it needed a bit of modifying still. 4oz butter, 2cups peanut butter, 3/4 lb of powder sugar - mix with beater or fork. Add 2 cups of rice krispies - it's a bit sticky, but better than crumbly which is what I got using the original recipe. Freeze for a hour, then dip in semi-sweet chocolate melted over a double boiler. Freeze again and you have wonderful cookies!

I've tried a couple different pb ball recipes and this is, by far, the best. The mixture of the dry milk, corn flakes, and pb really cuts down on the gluiness and makes the dipping process a breeze. Huge hit for 2 years straight now!

I made these as part of my Christmas goodie boxes and I am still hearing about them a week later. They were a hit!

I was so happy to find this recipe! I remember my grandma used to make these with rice krispies. I actually used the version submitted by one of the other reviewers and they turned out great.

Regarding a P.B. substitute--there's really no good one for this much peanut butter. My husband is allergic, too, and uses almond butter. You could try this and other nut butters, but most are much runnier than commercial peanut butter. Some health food stores sell thickened soy nut butters that might produce comparable results.

Wow, I submitted this recipe to this magazine when I was a teenager, and it was always a favorite! I just found it again by googling my name. However, 13 years have passed and my husband is allergic to peanuts. Anyone have any good substitution ideas??

I made this recipe and the one I always make for the holidays which is the same as the one from A COOK FROM MANCHESTER, N.H. and I prefer the latter much better. The balls are easier to roll out and the taste is better.

Four forks for simplicity to taste ratio. I chilled my dough BEFORE I rolled it into balls & found it much easier to work with. Didn't feel like chopping chocolate so I melted Ghiradelli double chocolate chips- super yummy! I tried to use a fondue fork to eliminate fork tines in the middle & it was still a pain- at the end I just used my fingers to dip them & it worked fine.

Oh my gosh! This is the best peanut butter cup I have ever tasted. I made them in the shape of Easter eggs and they were the hit the of day. I used rice crispies instead of cornflakes. IncrEDIBLE!!

This recipe is great. I loved these as a kid, and now I'm making them for the kids I baby-sit for. So simple and so good. Flavor kind of like peanut butter fudge.

These chocolate peanut butter balls are so well liked by my guests that I send care packages of them to Australia on a regular basis.

These are good! This isn't a very sophisticated recipe - it's easy, with simple ingredients - but the end result looks and tastes great!
