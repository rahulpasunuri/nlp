Followed the recipe as directed except I used only about 1/2 stick of butter. It is a good base as others have commented. Next time I would add more seasoning though.

I like to add sweet Italian sausage, without the skin and browned...hard to go wrong no matter who is in the crowd.

A Cook from Forest Hills summed it up very nicely, basic and simple but very tasty and a good base to play with if you are inclined. I have made this for Thanksgiving, it's in the oven now but I tasted it and it's delicious. We weren't able to use Poultry Seasoning so we used a fresh herb mix of sage, rosemary, thyme and marjoram, plus the parsley in the recipe. Orowheat country white bread and packaged broth although we did have giblets (needed fresh broth for gravy.) We were lucky to have my parents' herb garden handy, fresh herbs are so tasty, and we used about two teaspoons of the thyme and sage and 1/2 tsp of rosemary,since it is so much stronger. I am filing this for my basic stuffing recipe, to embellish as I please.

This is a great stuffing. Very basic, but it's very good and lends itself to variations. I did not use giblets but added approximately 10 oz. mushrooms (mixture of cremini and white) instead. Also vegetable stock rather than chicken stock. I've tried a few other stuffing recipes from this site but this will now be my go-to recipe.

Wow! I used Old Bay instead of poultry seasoning, added 2 tsp rubbed sage, and left out the giblets, so I guess I didn't fully follow the recipe, but it was wonderful good. This was amazing in a trial run with a chicken. This will become my favorite dressing recipe.

This was really good! I used challah , added mushrooms for the last two minutes of the saute. I, too , excluded the giblets using only the chicken broth. Next time I will add water chestnuts to the mix. Easy and very tasty.

I already placed a review but want to add that I used Paul Prudhome's Poultry Magic (for the poultry seasoning). This is found in the spice section at most grocery stores. It is one of my favorite cooking ingredients (for dumplings, matza ball soup, any chicken dish).

This is a great tasting, basic dressing. Our family likes that there are no strange flavors popping up to surprise us (for good or bad) and that we can relax and expect good ol', yummy dressing. I doubled the recipe which was just enough for 15 with a little for left overs. I also made this with no giblets and with vege broth for 5 vegetarians and they all said it was great.

This was great! It was my first effort at stuffing and it turned out perfect. I toasted the bread in the oven first, and added shallots and some rosmary. Very tasty.

Simple and delicious dressing. I used a sweet onion which contrasted nicely with the herbs. Will definitely make again and again!

MarieLouise, "Poultry Seasoning" is a dried spice blend available in the spice aisle of just about every supermarket. Good Luck!

QUICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Before Thanksgiving 2003...what is "poultry seasoning"??????????? Thanks, and Happy Holidays!

Also similar to our family receipe of 50+ years. Normally we toast it. Made 2 batches this Thanksgiving. One exactly as written and one sans giblets for the vegetarians. Both were awesome. Whole family said it was the best dressing ever, and without toasting. It's easy to overdo the seasoning and under do the vegetables without the receipe. And it takes awhile to toast 4 loaves of bread, even in the oven, if making enough for our family. Never again!

I'd always had a problem with dressing that was too dry. This recipe worked big time for me.

mmmmmm is the word for this recipe! It was a great hit on Thanksgiving. Even those who swore off dressing (I raise my hand here) liked it. Very easy to make and delicious. Try it!

Perfect. I have never tasted a better stuffing. It was incredibly moist and delicious, yet fairly simple to make. My only suggestion would be to cut the giblets as finely as possible.

great basic receipe for "light-bread" stuffing, similar to my own. As a twist, try toasting the bread first. It adds a unique flavor (and I consider it my secret)

Thank you for providing this recipe! It is very similar to our family recipe which was handed down via word of mouth (and much trial and error-on my part) for generations. It is so nice to finally have a written version!

very moist like it but also think its close to the corn bread dressing i make at the holidays

Rating: 2
This recipe has most of the basic ingreditients, but to be listed under a true southern Thanksgiving it needs to have corn bread. Our family tradition is to add sage, eggs and enough juice to let it cook for about 1 hour without getting too dry. My Mom started a new tradition a few years back by adding a can of cream of celery soup instead of chopped celery. It is easy and taste even better. The giblets and some boiled eggs are used in the gravy which some like and some don't, but that is how traditions get started.

I too have used this receipe since I began cooking for my family years ago. It was handed down from my mother and I have passed it along to my daughters. I have been asked many times to make this stuffing for others.

This recipe is delicious! It is the very same recipe that I have always made my dressing.I amm usaually asked to make the dressing at all the family holiday meals.

This sounds almost like the sage dressing my mom makes! She got the recipe from her mom, who got it from her mom! Thanksgiving dishes should be ones passed down thru the generations - that's what the holiday is all about!
