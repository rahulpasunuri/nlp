Beef Soup? Why the chicken ?

This recipe is fabulous. If you add a few more cups of water to the stock you'll have more than enough and you can freeze whatever you have leftover. I also put 1/4 cup thinly sliced carrots and small handful baby spinach in each serving bowl at the end. The carrots heat up and the baby spinach wilts. My husband even loves tis. Says it is the best soup I've ever made.

The crepes were excellent. The consumme took too long to cook and did not make enough to serve my guests.
