Did some big substitutions b/c I am dairy free. Substituted whole milk for coconut milk. Substituted the cream at the top of the coconut milk for the heavy cream. Added just a teaspoon of coconut butter. Delicious. So rich and creamy. Highly recommend!

Great recipe! Reminds me of Italy. I like to add a little olive oil and salt. Mario Battali serves olive oil gelato at Otto and its so good in a sweet & salty way. I posted the recipe for olive oil gelato on my blog, Spoons to Sporks.

THIS IS A GREAT recipe!!!! I found that the trick was to put into the chilled custard is 1 tablespoon vanilla and some cinnamon!!!

This was a fantastic dessert! I did have trouble with the "curdle effect " (more like a separation than cooked egg)when the custard hit the cold water bath. I immediately put it back into the blender on high until it returned to a thickened smooth consistency. Then it went straight to the refrigerator. The blender saved this recipe! I also added the vanilla bean seeds! Awesome!

Made this as a dessert for Italian Christmas. It was fine; rich & custardy, but honestly not 'wow'. While heating the cream & eggs I thought they were separating, and found whisking melded everything together beautifully.

Absolutely fantastic. I followed the directions exactly. I cheated and added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract though. It was still phenomenal. I will try it without the vanilla next time, but it was definitely great with it.

This is a great recipe but the second time I made it, I used the same method as when making my favorite ice cream, which is: whisk the egg yolks in a bowl. Into a heavy duty medium saucepan, put the milk, sugar, cream and salt. Over medium heat while stirring occasionally with a spoon, heat until mixture just begins to steam, about 4 minutes. Using the whisk while pouring, slowly add about 1/2 cup of the hot mixture to the yolks to temper them. Pour this mixture back into the pan stirring to mix. Continue heating over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile prepare an ice water bath that will accommodate the pan. (Kitchen sink works well!) Heat the custard mixture until it begins to thicken and coats the back of a spoon, or better yet, as another reviewer suggested, until it reaches 185 on an instant read thermometer. Remove pan from heat and immediately put into the ice water bath, stirring to stop the cooking. When cooled sufficiently, pour mixture through a fine sieve (optional) and if you choose, add flavoring. When cool enough, cover and store in refrigerator for several hours before putting into ice cream maker. This seems to eliminate the curdling experienced in the first go around and it loses nothing in the texture department when combining all the ingredients at once. It's also less labor intensive!

I made this tonight and used 3 beautiful duck egg yolks, so the color was fantastic. I didn't whip the cream after reading the earlier post. It was very yummy and I will absolutely make it again.

This is fabulous. I make usually scramble egg whites in the morning for breakfast and this is a great excuse to put the yolks to work. That way the whole family shares the fat:)I used a vanilla bean and it was sublime. Don't be afraid of adding whatever you want to this, I say great creative with it!! I am with the chef from Chicago.

I made this a couple of months ago.. and I can't get it out of my head! It is so fantastic! It is the best thing to have come out of my ice cream maker yet!

Working on trying to improve perfection.... my additional comments after research and another go at the recipe. Try decreasing egg yolks to 4. Increase cream to 3/4 cup; no need to whip it as the custard gets aerated during churning. Cook custard to exactly 185 degrees on an instant read thermometer. This is an example of true Italian cooking: top quality ingredients, simple technique, genuine flavors. Don't forget the (sea) salt and don't be tempted to add the vanilla!

Excellent and simple recipe. Just be careful to not overcook the custard; I recommend heating over hot water rather than directly on flame. I just got back from Italy and have been trying to find a recipe that replicates what I tasted there and this one does it. As someone stated below, the whole point of this recipe is to NOT muck it up with other flavors like vanilla. The classic tastes of milk, cream, sugar, salt and egg in the correct proportions is all you need for a fine dessert. DON'T be tempted to add the vanilla!

I just purchased my ice cream maker during the after-Christmas sales and have tried making several recipes since. This was by far the best! I was a little nervous about the lack of flavoring and being a huge creme brulee fan, I recognized these ingredients immediately and decided to jazz it up a bit. I added 1 T Vanilla Extract to the custard mixture before refrigerating. It was like frozen creme brulee...this recipe is definitely going on my shelf for good!

This is a fantastic base recipe for gelato and less heavy than ice cream. Since I'm a chocoholic, I had to add chocolate to mine, so I added 4 ounces of 60% cacao Ghiridelli when I heated the milk. Friends raved about it and were shocked how rich the chocolate flavor was even though it looked like milk chocolate. Definitely a winner!

Ha Ha, the best reviews on this site come from people who believe they are elitest foodies. To "a cook" who seems to be so incredibly hot and bothered by the fact some people added vanilla: as a chef/cooking instructor I can tell you that the best cooks are the ones who go outside of the box and do things for themselves. Is adding vanilla to this recipe groundbreaking? No, but very little in culinaria is...it has all been done, more or less. The most interesting thing is that people get upset about a person putting there own spin on things...how boring food would be if no one did that. And by the way, since you felt you should mention Jesus Christ...I really don't think he cares how anyone prepares their gelato, and neither should you! But thanks for the laugh.

christ, the whole point of the recipe is that IT DOES NOT HAVE VANILLA.

The reason your custard curdled is that you didn't graduate the hot milk to the egg mixture. It didn't curdle, the eggs cooked. If you add the milk about a half cup at a time, for the first cup or two, it will slowly allow the egg yolks to warm-up and not react suddenly to the heat. Also allowing the milk to cool down a bit, before you add it, will help.

The first time I made this it curdled, but I have made it twice since at medium low heat and it was wonderful. I used brown sugar to give it a richer color.

Wonderful, creamy ice cream. I added about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cooked custard before freezing. Also, I did not use a blender (just a whisk and ladled in the milk very gradually - worked fine). This is very tasty and not a big deal to make.

The first time I made the recipe, the eggs curdled in the blender; so I am guessing things just got too heated in there. The second time, I halved the recipe and did everything by hand - no blenders/processors, etc. The texture was silky smooth even before I seived it. The taste is so pure and clean. The texture velvety soft. I am looking forward to making a whole batch next time, even if I have to give up my kitchen toys for good!

The first time I made it, I overcooked the custard and it curdled. I only cooked it right under 6 minutes, though. The second time I lowered the temp to medium-low, and stopped as soon as it coated the spoon, still only 4.5 minutes. I also doubled the recipe. I just poured some of the milk into my food processor to temper the eggs, then dumped it all back into the saucepan and whisked it together. This way, I didn't have the problem with overflowing. It turned out fantastic! I can't wait to try variations with it...:)

I made this gelato for Father's Day and it was a huge hit! I scraped the inside of a vanilla bean and added it to the milk before I heated it. I doubled the recipe which worked fine, but too much volumn for my blender - I won't do that again. I plan on making this again for the 4th of July.

This recipe is elegant in its simplicity and is not difficult to prepare.

Very very good. Just one change: increase the sugar to about 3/4 cup. I might even add some vanilla, but just a 1/2 tsp. This has an excellent, fresh taste and good, smooth texture.
