I used flour tortillas and some leftover beef brisket. Proceeded with the fried onions. I made a salad as the base with chopped tomatoes and black olives. The traditional items you would use for tacos works well. My family loved them. Very easy to make, just don't forget to remove the toothpicks.

I started halfway down the recipe when I decided to use leftover roasted chicken that I did the day before. Started by sautéing the onion and garlic and went from there. It was fantastic and the boyfriend agreed.

Add some Jack cheese and use flour tortillas. Then get a good dip (I use cucumber, garlic and Feta dip), a cool drink and you're set! You might also try a little Garlic Powder with the meat mixture.

If I ever make this again, I will add a lot more spice to it, maybe even some cream cheese right in with the beef. I baked mine so that may have caused the bland taste, but there just wasn't much to them. they are great with the salsa and guacamole though, so not all bad, just not as much flavor as i was hoping for.

excellent flavor - we used a little more tomato sauce, but otherwise, really tasty. We cooked them in a deep fryer and served with guacamole and sour cream - delicious!

Excellent! Cooked the chuck roast in the crockpot while at work. I too put them in the oven instead of frying. I sprayed the baking sheet ightly with fat free Pam, placed the flautas (seam side down) and sprayed the tops lightly with Pam as well. Baked high @ 425, until brown and crisp. I'm sure they were lower in calories. I will make these again & again.

I make these burrito style with flour tortillas. Assemble them place them in a baking dish, cover with ranchero sauce and manchego cheese and bake until cheese is melted. There is never even a scrap left! The best part is I can put this together the day before a party & just top w/sauce and cheese before placing in the oven. We always have the black bean & heart of palm salad with it. Also from this site. Heat some premade Quesadillas on the grill, add a Margarita & Happy Cinco de Mayo!

Want to make these more authentic? Instead of tomato sauce, use two chopped tomatoes. Use one serrano chile, minced, instead of the pickled jalapeño and don't spread the filling all the way to the very ends of the tortillas, that way you don't need to use toothpicks. Another good filling for flautas is chorizo and potato.

I'm a vegetarian and this worked wonders with my family!! Instead of the meat portions i used broccoli, small chunks of tofu, olives, mushrooms & bellpeppers, i also added cheddar and pepper jack cheese on top of the vegetables before rolling up the flautas. It was absolutely finger-licking-good. The only problem i have now is to think twice before giving up this secret recipe to my friends :-)

These were really good. We used both corn and flour tortillas. Both equally good. However, it is very important that fresh tortillas are used, especially the corn tortillas). If you don't use fresh the tortillas fall apart. I had corn tortillas in the freezer and thawed them out and most of them ended up useless. But using fresh tortillas I will definaltely make these again.

This is awesome! I too made it with flour tortillas, and I plan to make it that way again. One piece of advice I would give to those making these with flour tortillas: fry them one at a time, and hold them down with a spatula or they will open up. I also used a whole cup of tomato sauce instead of a half and I think it might have been a bit dry if I hadn't. One thing I will change next time I make this will be to add more jalapeno, as it wasn't a bit spicy with only one (even my 4 and 2 year old boys were completely unaffected. I am making this again this week. Can't wait!

Great for burritos. Can't wait to make it for a crowd.

This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite recipes. I make it as shredded beef tacos with soft corn tortillas. Fab!!!

This is a great all purpose beef filling recipe for many mexican foods (burritos, tacos, tostados, Navajo tacos, etc.) It also is great when cooking for a crowd as it is quick and easy and doubles (or more) easily. I have experimented with different kinds of peppers for a variety of "heat" depending on the taste of the people eating it.

I added more hot peppers to spice this up. They were so good that they were best plain. Also, Use flour tortillas, less heartburn! When frying them, you might destroy the first one or two but you will get the knack for it. The secret is VERY hot oil and fry them with the creased side down. Once it has fried for about 30 seconds, it stays together and allows for easy truning over. They are great reheated in the oven too!

The beef filling was delicious, although on the mild side. However, I had a very hard time keeping the tortillias together during the frying process. I gave up after the first two and ended up rolling them like enchiladas and baking them in the oven. Nobobdy knew the difference and thought they were great. The big BONUS is the broth left over - it made a spectacular soup with the addition of some pasta and veggies I had in the house.

Filling does need spiced up. Used flour tortillas and wrapped them. Wet the shell with water when wrapping to help seal. Overall - very good. Will make again.

I have to agree with a previous review, it needs a serious increase of spices. I also wrapped mine like a burrito rather than in flutes. The simmering creates the most wonderful beef broth I've ever tasted. I'll have to make a soup out of it soon.

Pleasantly surprised by the flavor of this recipe. I increased the spices slightly and all loved it. Would definitely make it again.

I love this recipe! It really tastes like something you would get in a mexican restaraunt. I roll them like a chimichanga rather than a flute.

I made this for a group of friends, of which 4 were of hispanic descent. They couldn't believe how good they were. At first they didn't believe I had made them. They are a hit everytime I make them.
