I'm a professional caterer and have used this since it was originally published in the magazine. It has never turned out anything but perfect. Peeling tomatoes is a snap if you set up a "line" and it's well worth the effort. I never have to ask "what can I bring" to any event, I know the answer is always "THE TOMATOES"

An FYI for those that didn't like the labor involved here, there is a recipe on this site for pepper vodka soaked cherry tomatoes with seasoned salt that lets you poke holes in the cherry toms with a toothpick for the marinating. Same method would probably work here, and that recipe was quite tasty when I made it.

WOW! WOW! WOW! OW! It's hard to not eat more than one and I thought I didn't like Bloody Mary's! I added all ingredients plus a few dashes of tabasco and coarse 'fleur de sel' salt..and marinated 20 hours, turning occasionally. Served in shot glasses with demi-tasse spoon between courses. Definately worth the effort.

Be sure to have a little extra vodka on hand. After peeling four pints of cherry tomatoes, you're going to need a drink. Otherwise, loved this.

Considering that this recipe has all of my favorite ingredients in it - I could hardly wait to try it. What a dissapointment! I used the precious cherry tomatoes from my garden, that I had started from seed - and I wound up throwing them all away after they got messed up in this concoction. Don't bother with this one!

I thought this sounded great and was anxious to try it. However I was disappointed, especially after peeling all those tomatoes! It was just so-so and I ended up throwing them out.

I first had these little gems at a friend's house and had to have the recipe. I then made them myself the following week . . .fabulous. They were a big hit. Peeling the tomatoes is tedious as mentioned previously, but worth the effort. I think they are more tasty if you let them marinate for 1-2 days. Also, I used the new variety of cherry tomatoes known as "grape" tomatoes to make them even more unique. You've got to serve these at your next cocktail party!

Peeling cherry tomatoes is a pain in the ass: They overblanch easily, resulting in a gooey mess, and you need to take the short blanching time seriously. If you blanch them a few at a time, however, the blanching takes forever, and then you still have to peel them. That having been said, peeling them is essential for the tomatoes to absorb the marinade, and people seem genuinely appreciative of the effort. I listened to Bob Mould's "Black Sheets of Rain" while engaged in the menial and somewhat grisly task of peeling all the tomatoes, and found that it lifted my mood. Modifications: I used plain vodka, but included the lemon zest in the marinade, which worked fine. Tasting for salt is crucial and should be performed before _and_ after the marinade. I adjusted salt prior to refrigeration, but it was completely off after the tomatoes had merged with the vodka.

These little gems are surprisingly good. Also, they keep. I made them in the morning, removed them from the marinade after an hour, and kept them in my refrigerator until my party began that evening. My only caveat -- they are probably better for a small dinner party than a large cocktail party. At my cocktail party most people didn't realize that they were anything other than cherry tomatos with dill on them, so many people didn't try them. Those who did try them raved about them, though.

Wonderful surprise addition to a summer barbeque! I'd say it makes a fabulous summer "amuse bouche" in the French tradition. Peeling the tomatoes is a little tedious, but overall the recipe is extremely easy. A huge hit at my recent dinner party.
