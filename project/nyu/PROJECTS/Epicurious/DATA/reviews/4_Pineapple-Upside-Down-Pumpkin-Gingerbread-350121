does Arizona cook understand that this is an upside-down cake: e.g. you put the fruit on the bottom of the pan, then invert after cooking????!

I needed to figure out what to do with some leftover pumpkin and a pineapple my husband randomly brought home. I wasn't sure the pineapple, pumpkin and gingerbread would all go together, but they really did. My only criticism of this cake is that it is what I would describe as tooth-achingly sweet. However, I do not have much of a sweet tooth and my husband really enjoyed it. I would probably make this again if I had the ingredients on hand, but I'm not sure I would go out of my way to make it. Still, overall, it was very good.

Easy, tasty and great presentation what else do you need? I did one and a half times the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan. Used canned pineapple rings and the juice from same instead of the frozen concentrate. Served it with ginger whipped cream. Amazing. Making it again this weekend.

Delicious! I will definitely be making this again, and again, and again...

i made a few substitutes to this recipe to make it vegan (i.e. to contain no animal products) and it turned out delicious. I simply used dairy-free margarine (Earth Balance) in place of the butter called-for, and used 4 tsp. of whizzed chia seed blended with 1/2 cup of water in place of the eggs. I also happened not to have canned pumpkin in the house, so I used the equivalent volume of mashed ripe banana. The results were light, moist, and delicious. looked pretty too.

This was absolutely delicious! I had leftover pineapple I wanted to use up that had been in the freezer--chunks and crushed (which I drained). I don't think I'd go through the trouble of using fresh, since this came out so well.

Fabulous! My step-daughter made it while we were visiting for Thanksgiving. She used OJ instead of frozen pineapple juice, and FRESH PINEAPPLE, which was key. Kids, husband, us, and the whole family loved it. Moist and delicious. I plan to make it this weekend to thank the people who took care of our pets while we were visiting.

I made this exactly as the recipe said, but I couldn't get it to float above the plate like it does in the picture. what gives?

WOW, this cake is fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly but used canned pineapple rings, drained and patted dry. I think the pumpkin added texture rather than flavor and the moistness of this cake is incredible. One tip: if using a 9x9 pan, put something to catch the dripping sugar topping under one of your oven racks as it really made a mess of my oven. Also, let it cool AT LEAST 45 minutes, this will make it come out of the pan perfectly intact. This is going to be on my dessert table come Thanksgiving!

I made it with canned pineapple for company and the entire family loved it, especially with a shot of whipped cream on the side. I had no problem with it being underdone. This one is a keeper.

This was really good. I made it exactly as written. The gingerbread alone is very nice, though if I were using this recipe just for gingerbread, I would add some grated fresh ginger. The pineapple topping was just perfect-- that little bit of concentrate really perks up the pineapple flavor. And while canned pineapple certainly would work, the random circle pattern makes a very attractive presentation. I don't often make the same dessert twice, but this one definitely earns a repeat. I'm thinking it'll be the perfect Christmas Eve dessert.

This cake was the perfect balance of spicy and sweet. The range of flavors from all the ingredients provide made a very delicious cake. I will definitely make this again.

We made this for a large family gathering with many kids. Very popular. I made a recipe and a half in a 10X10 pan and added ten minutes to the bake time. Yummy with vanilla ice cream.

I made this for a gathering, and every single person asked for the recipe. I used a ceramic 9x9 pan, and baked for 45 minutes. It was perfect..checked it by inserting a toothpick, and it came out clean. Substituted canned pineapple chunks(drained) in place of fresh pineapple, doubled the cinnamon, and added 3/4 teaspoon of ground cloves.

Very yummy. Great for the family. I increased the pumpkin and decreased the molasses. My kids devoured it.

Not overly impressive, but I think it could be. The only change I made was to use canned pineapple in natural juice, which worked well - thanks to the other reviewers for the tip. I could not taste a pumpkin flavor whatsoever, so next time I will add more pumpkin and spice and less molasses as it was way to overwhelming for me. I made sure the topping was nice and thick and baked it for a few minutes longer than called for and had no problems with the cake being under done.

I wasn't as impressed with this cake as I wanted to be. I thought the molasses "topping" would really steal the show, but overall the cake lacked vigor and didn't cook up very well - done around the edges and still sticky in the middle. It tasted fine, but was underwhelming. Serving it up with some butter toffee ice cream did help.

I loved this recipe as well...the cake had a great spicy flavor. I did change it a bit, I used apples in place of pineapple, using apple cider instead of pineapple juice. I also substituted Grade B maple syrup instead of molasses. The only problem I had was with the cake soaking up too much of the topping liquid...I think because it was too thin w/the syrup. Next time I'll cook it down longer. I served it with vanilla ice cream, my guests loved it!

Loved this recipe. The inside of the cake was too wet, but perhaps I didn't bake it long enough. I also agree that canned pineapple would work well.

A very moist, delicious cake. I would use more spice the next time and canned pineapple would work.

This is a seriously easy and good cake. Made as written, but I also believe that canned pineapple would work just as well. You could use the juice in the can in place of the concentrate, which for me would be less wastefull.
