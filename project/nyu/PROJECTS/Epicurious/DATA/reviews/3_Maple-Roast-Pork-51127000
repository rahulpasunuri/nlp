This was easy and delicious. I browned the pork first on the stove top. And I added parsnips. The flavor is yummy.

This was quite good. One problem I had with the recipe was that I think the meat took longer to cook than stated. I have a new oven so there shouldn't have been a big discrepancy. I was unable to find a tenderloin that was only 1 pound, but I tried to adjust for that and still found it needed significantly longer. Nice recipe, though.
