They were very good. I did not find them greasy as others have said but I blotted my bacon before adding it to the dough. The Stilton is intense and next time I might use a little less or mix with another cheese. But they were easy to make and guests enjoyed them.

these are petits choux au fromage according to JULIA! and they are winners, I freeze them and reheat to rave reviews.

My husband (raised by NY foodies) would eat these by the gross! Fortunately, they are very easy to make, as well as delicious. The one modification I would suggest would be to use parchment paper and non-stick spray on the cookie sheets.

I made this just as the recipe called for and it came out extremely well. It was easy and delicious.

I liked this very much for the texture. I made it exactly as written and the puffs turned out light and puffy. I would recommend serving right out of the oven or warm. I had to rewarm them, but they were still good. I didn't hear super raves, but they were all eaten up. Next time I'll use regular bleu cheese and pre-cooked bacon and be just as happy. Be careful not to cook too long, or you'll get burnt-cheese taste. Otherwise, they are very easy to put together.

This was a huge hit at our holiday party! I thought it was a little rich and the dough was a little tough to make into nice "puffs." I just finished making it again, only this time I'm freezing the dough. I hope to be able to slice it into similar size pieces for more uniformity.

I'm glad I tried these before I had company as they turned into greasy hockey pucks. When I compared the recipe to a basic choux pastry, the proportions are off. The concept has promise so I may try again using a gougere recipe and substitute stilton for the gruyere (as I have a yummy block of stilton left).

I made this recipe as written and found it a little heavy and greasy. So ------ I substituted cheddar cheese for the stilton, omitted the bacon and doubled it. Even my pickiest eaters love it. I'm off to make it again for a church potluck tonight.

These tasty little puffs have become a party staple. So easy to make ahead and freeze. I can hardly keep them coming out of the oven fast enough. I've had more requests for this recipe than any other other party tidbit, except maybe for when I make little swordfish bites using the Tuna Rau marinade.

Easy to make and tasted great! The grocery store I was at didn't have stilton so I had to use regular blue cheese. They still turned out delicious and my husband ate most of them! As a side note-thanks for the parchment paper tip!! :)

These little puffs are delicious! They are easy to make and so very tasty! We have wonderful hors d'oeuvre parties, with great snacks but this was a new taste treat. I had several requests for the recipe...I will definitely make these again.

This is an FOTP appetizer (fly off the plate). Easy to prepare, makes a good batch and people knock them right back. I substitute with turkey bacon and no one can tell the difference.

I Loved this hors d'ouerve for its simplicity because one can freeze them ahead ...they are very savory and unusual. My husband "loved" them. While I did enjoy them, I did feel they were "strong" in flavour, and perhaps complement a heartier "beverage" so to speak. Party-goers however, appeared to like them very much indeed. I would make them again for sure.

I made this for a cocktail party, and it flew off the plate. It was incredibly easy to make ahead and freeze. This recipe will become a staple in my appetizer repertoire.

This recipe was as easy to make as it sounds. I made both the listed version and another with a medium-sharp, dry white cheddar. The stilton version was more balanced, but I thought the cheddar was a little more interesting. Either way, while good, this was not one that jumped off the table.

Whoa baby! These are decadent and unusual, and WELL worth the expense of the Stilton cheese. We quadrupled this recipe, intending to freeze most of it for the holiday season, but we could not stop eating them straight off the hot baking sheets. Definitely not diet food, but it is the season of sin--I will be making these every year, they are wonderful. I wonder if they would be good with smoked salmon instead of bacon?

They live up to the "fast & easy," and were good enough to make again. You might want to double the batch--mine were kind of small, but still only yielded about 30.

These are indeed great because can be made with ingredients that I always have on hand. Quick and easy and someone alwsys requests the recipe, even when there are only 2 guests. Well worth the minimal time and effort required.

A favorite because they are not only delicious, but can be made in advance and frozen. To the cook who couldn't get hers to puff, I would suggest making sure that the pan isn't too hot when you add the eggs - I've made that mistake myself.

Nice straight forward flavors. I did use Gorgonzola rather than the Stilton because that is what I had on hand. I like the idea of being able to prepare ahead, freeze and have ready for "we were in your neighborhood..." company! KIMBER

This was an excellent hors d'oeuvres! I made it for Christmas Eve and everyone loved it! My brother- in- law commented that they reminded him of "mini" quiches and my sister-in-law (who is an excellent cook and has a catering business on the side) agreed and added that they did remind her of quiches but even better because they are without the heavy/fatty pastry crust. I will definitely make this recipe again and again-it's a keeper!

This was soooo easy and absolutely fabulous!!! I refrigerated for a couple of hours before I served them, probably not a good idea, they did not puff up much...but I can't wait to try them again.

I was disapointed with the end result. They did not puff. Were they supose to? The size they started was the end result. They looked skimpy on a platter. Another problem was I baked them and brought them to a party. I think they would be better if served right away. Easy to make but not sure I would bother with these again.

Always a favorite hors d'ourves! Gone before all the others.

I agree with the cook from Hamilton - preferred cheddar to Stilton. They do freeze beautifully!

I used gorgonzola instead of stilton and it worked just fine. This recipe is a keeper!!!

Very tasty & easy to make. A good recipe to make ahead of time & bake when guests arrive. They look most uniform if rolled into 1" balls (depending on the size you want)instead of dropping from a spoon. Good with both Champagne or red wine. I used the handy hint about baking them on parchment paper--worked like a charm.

I love to prepare a wide selection of party foods for gatherings of friends and family, and I have been making these every year for Christmas and New Year parties since the recipe was published eight years ago. They are fabulous when served warm, and the stilton flavor sets them apart from the ubiquitous and bland "cheese balls" and cream cheese-based creations that too often pass for hors d'oeuvres. I have learned a couple of tricks that help make them turn out great. First, I am careful to use only a baking sheet that has fully cooled; otherwise the cheese puffs spread out too much. Perhaps more important, I save a lot of hard scrubbing by baking them on parchment paper rather than directly on the baking sheet. I have found that they stick miserably to even high quality non-stick cookware, but they easily pop off the parchment paper. I usually make these on large batches, doubling or even tripling the recipe, and have found that they freeze very well and can be easily rewarmed from a frozen state.

I didn't like these but my family did. When I think of puffs I think lite and airy, these were neither. I felt it was a waste of Stilton. I could have used a less expensive cheese and had the same result.

Yummy! I substituted old cheddar for the stilton (most of my family members aren't blue cheese fans). They were light and very tasty.
