fantastic. i am always looking for new dressings for raw cabbage salad and this one was perfect. i used chunky PB; pureed garlic; no H20 but used 1/2 c. of nonfat plain yogurt to extend it (make it less caloric but creamier) + add some tang; skipped cilantro (hubby doesn't like); used 3 packets of splenda instead of sugar; 1 TB of hot chili flakes not the smidge rec'd here. Blend it all together and it is a wonderful sauce for veges, noodles, raw anything.

Good basic peanut sauce and couldn't be easier. I left out the cilantro because I didn't have any but will try it next time. Used sambal oelek instead of chili flakes and reduced the vinegar slightly. Excellent as is but also makes a good base for experimentation.

I have made this sauce at least 20 times without changing a thing. You can use it as a veggie dip if you reduce the water drastically, but this is fantastic as a sauce over just about everything!

This is a good basic recipe but I think it tastes way better with a good size chunk of fresh ginger--I just give it a good crack with the knife and chop it fine but it could also be grated. Used rice vinegar, fresh pb, 3 Tb. soy, 2 cloves garlic, 1 Tb sugar and some cayenne pepper sauce. I also added one Tb sesame oil. Fantastic. I usually chop up salad ingredients, make some angel hair pasta, and grill either chicken or steak with salt, pepper and olive oil (or a soy marinade depending on how prepared I am)--then toss the whole thing together. It's colorful, and the salad makes it lighter.

This recipe was quick and delicious.. You don't even have to let it sit for an hour; I just whipped it up first, and by the time the veggies were done, it was ready. I discovered, though, that I don't really like cilantro & I might make it with basil next time, cuz I put basil in everything

This is a great recipe! I agree that it doesn't need all 3 tablespoons of vinegar when used as a sauce. I made a batch to use as a marinade for the chicken and I used all the vinegar which worked very well.

Yum! Very garlicky, though. If you're going to make it for date night, halve the garlic!

I used crunchy peanut butter b/c it was all I had and followed the suggestions of others and decreased the vinegar to 2 T (used rice wine vin). Also, didn't have cilantro- used parsley, and added a minced jalapeno. This peanut sauce was so simple and excellent-we had it over a stir fried veggies and tofu. Everyone loved it! Can't wait to try in with the cilantro. This sauce is addictive.

More peanut butter and soy sauce, less vinegar! And I used freshly ground pb b/c that's all I had.

Excellent, and even better with the following modifications: -used organic peanut butter -added fresh ginger and chopped jalapeno -used 2 tsp apple cider vinegar and one balsamic -doubled the garlic

Delicious over whole wheat angel hair pasta! I will use only half the garlic next time, as I am not a fan of raw garlic.

A great peanut sauce recipe, but I agree with an earlier reviewer that 2 Tbsp of apple cider vinegar (instead of 3) would be better. I've also made this recipe substituting rice vinegar for the apple cider vinegar, and 3 Tbsp works fine in this case.

quick, easy, and delicious!

Excellent but think next time I would add less apple cider vinegar (go down to 2 T not 3T). Otherwise, very succulent and lost its "Jiffy" taste! Best I have made.

The best and easiest peanut sauce I've found. It goes with just about anything, and is very forgiving if you are out of a particular ingredient, or want to crank up the garlic or pepper.

Flavorful and versatile. One could add all sorts of other ingredients to it, such as ginger and/or scallions. I thought it could use a bit more heat. Next time, I'll double the red pepper. I sauteed thin slices of beef, then added cooked noodles and soy bean sprouts. I poured the sauce over all and had to add water to dilute the mixture slightly. Extra water doesn't take away from the overall taste.

Deelicious! Added about a tsp of Chinese dark sesame oil for added flavor, was scrumptious on the noodle dish I made.

One of my favorite sauces ever. I like to make a small batch and then use it as a dip for vegetable sticks, but it's also exellent as a pasta or stir-fry sauce.

This stuff is great. I use Jif and find nothing to complain about.

I thought this was an easy, quick, good results peanut sauce - ingredients were right on, but I did increase most (garlic, red pepper, even cilantro) - I also used organic peanut butter and thinned the sauce with extra hot water and viniger for use with tossed spinach and sauteed chicken.

I substituted rice wine vinegar for the cider vinegar, used brown sugar, and added minced fresh ginger root, scallions, and a bit of jalapeno. Served over Udon noodles - delicious! Sauce was extra-thick, though - needs to be thinned a little. Received tons of compliments, even from the picky eaters - yay!

please do not use commercial peanut butter. A brand such as Arrowhead Mills Organic will not leave a "jiff" aftertaste. Also, if there is only one food that you eat that is organic, it should be peanut butter and peanuts! Non organic is loaded with pesticides.

I really enjoyed this hash-dash sauce. First I halved the sauce. Second I didn't have any cilantro on hand but it didn't deter from the sauce. It was just a very quick dinner as I served it over frozen package of stir-fried veggies and noodles. Plus I didn't wait the requisite one hour. It was YUMMY!!!

I used sesame tahini instead of peanut butter and it was amazing! I also added a little more garlic and crushed red peppers just to make it a bit more spicy. I will be making this again real soon.

okay but needs some things, what I'm not sure. It started out as a 3 fork but as we progressed thru dinner the taste of jiffy became all too apparent.Any suggestions to liven it up or for different recipe, would be appriecated.

I used this w/the Gingered Veggies & Tofu recipe elsewhere on this site. This peanut sauce (over spaghetti) was definitely the best part. I used chunky peanut butter and was quite happy w/the result.

A great recipe and very easy to make. I took a recommendation from one of the other reviewers and cut down the amount of vinegar to 2 tbs. and I also added a little (1.5 tbs.) brown sugar. Super!!! Great on veggies and chicken or beef.

This sauce was good on stir-fried chicken and vegetables, but it could use some fish sauce to thin it a little.

This sauce is wonderful over sauteed chicken. My father normally does't like Chinese food, but he loved this dish so much!!! I will definitely make it again and again.

This was WONDERFUL. I too, used Rice Vinegar opposed to the regular vinegar and left out the sugar. Very easy and worth the calories!

YUM!! as a true lover of peanut sauce...this is wonderful!! I tossed the sauce over noodles, very good! The only changes I made the second time I made the sauce, were to reduce the amount of apple cider vinegar to 2 1/2 tbs as opposed to 3...I thought the vinegar taste was a bit too strong and I used Natural Crunchy Peanut butter and it was great!

Yum yum!

Perfect for a bachelor like me who eats a lot of pasta but gets tired of tomato or cheese sauces. Very easy to make, works fine with chunky style peanut butter too. I also used rice vinegar instead of cider vinegar. Be aware of the sodium in this dish though between the soy sauce and the processed peanut butter.

My whole family loves this with chicken satay. This recipe makes enough to toss with pasta or serve over rice and I've even mixed leftover sauce with chicken chunks and put it on a pizza with bean sprouts and julienned carrots for a Thai Chicken Pizza!

My family loves it. I use it on plain pasta and even for a cold pasta salad. I cut back on the apple cider vinegar and added 1/4 cup minced chives or scallions (whichever is available) and 1 1/4-inch slice ginger root, finely minced. I omit the chervil since it is not always available.

I've used this sauce several times now. Twice for company - Everyone raved about it.
