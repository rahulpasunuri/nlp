I loved this recipe. The tarragon really added another dimension. It really brightened up the pesto. I would use this as my standard pesto recipe...it's just that good.

The flavors in this pesto were exceptional. If using a blender, I would recommend adding the cheese to the mix after the other ingredients have blended. I had trouble getting everything to go through and the friction was sufficient to melt the cheese, which destroyed the texture.

Super simple. The tarragon and parsley really added flavor.

Fresh and delicious! I didn't cool the pine nuts enough after toasting them which melted the cheese and made my pesto clumpy. (rookie move).

Delicious and potent pesto! I followed the recipe exactly, using basil from my garden. I was afraid the tarragon would be weird, but it really enhanced th flavor of the basil - don't skip it.
