This was delicious! I added raisins to stop it from being entirely one colour and next time I would consider added a little red cabbage for a little more colour. But overall this was an absolutely amazing side dish! PS: I also sprinkled lemon over the apples to prevent them from browning which gave the slaw a little more of a crisp and fresh taste!

I loved this recipe! I personally love more ginger. Next time I made it I tripled the ginger and also made it equal parts apple and celery. Totally delish! One of the best and refreshing foods I've ever had. Great way to clean your palet at the end of a meal.

I'm surprised this recipe's reviewers didn't sound more enthusiastic - I LOVED it! I didn't change a thing and was pleased with the results. Thought maybe raisins might be a nice addition, tho.

Used less mayo and celery, more ginger (3t), and still felt that it could use a bit more ginger flavor. Very tasty, especially with a spicy main dish.

This fresh, crunchy slaw makes a great temperature/texture contrast with meat loaf or something equally heavy. I reduce the celery and increase the ginger as a matter of personal taste. I imagine replacing the fresh ginger with 2 Tbsp. of pickled ginger (sliced in thin ribbons) would be pretty tasty also.

This was a super-fresh dish. I cut back on the mayo, and it turned out great.

I found this an easy recipe (used a mandoline for match sticks) - I also slivered some fresh basil on top - quite a nice addition. Debbie - Boulder Colorado

I cubed the apples and the celery and added more ginger to the dressing. A refreshing change.

While I thought the dish was good, it failed the potluck test--at a function that ran short of food, plenty of the slaw remained left over, despite an attractive garnish.

This has a great, refreshing flavor, but I thought the recipe called for too much mayo. I added more fruit and celery to thin out the mayo, and it turned out delicious-- great ginger taste! Cutting the celery into "matchsticks" took me beyond the 20-minute prep time, but I would definitely make it again.

Light and refreshing. I have served it several times and guests have requested the recipe. I've tried differnt kinds of apples & found that the more tart the apples the better. Sweeter apples seem to turn brown faster. Also mix the dressing and add the apple as you go. Helps with the browning.

I added a pinch of sea salt and white pepper. Also, to keep the apples from turning brown during preparation, I covered them with a can of citrus-flavored soda (7-Up, Fresca, Citra, Sprite, any will do). Drain before adding dressing ingredients. My meat-and-potatoes husband not only enjoyed this salad served with smoked pork tenderloin but also had second helpings as dessert! Very refreshing.

Light and refreshing with winter meat and veggie meals. Cool and mild.
