These were yummy for us parents, but the young kids were not fans. (More for us!) Due to deadly soy allergy, we substituted Coconut Secret aminos for the soy sauce and they still came out delicious. The instructions for "pleating" the dumplings sure would be helped by a PHOTO though! We would definitely make them again, maybe without the shrimp, since the peeling/cleaning of them was the only labor-intensive part of the recipe. We thought the pork added much more flavor to the dumplings and the shrimp did not add much at all. We would probably also add some chopped baby bok choi next time.

These are great and very simple to make. I too didn't bother making my own wrappers and opted for store bought. Also spiked the filling with a garlic clove and a few torn basil leaves for brightness. As for the sauce, I added toasted sesame seeds and a few red pepper flakes. My only execution adjustment for those pan frying is to omit the "add water" stage. Either the addition of water at all or the covering of the pan after adding the water (more likely) causes once crispy dumplings to go soft due to the circulation of water vapors within the chamber. Next time I'll simply pan fry the dumplings and take care to loosen them from the pan at frequent intervals to avoid sticking, but to also maintain the crispiness.

Super tasty. I've tried these both pan-fried (according to the instructions) and boiled, and I preferred boiled though they came out great both ways.

I make these several times a year with awsome results. Make dough as directed and add a little fish sauce to filling. Perfect every time and worth the effort!

Yummm. Made with a few changes - used about half as much scallions, added a little chopped wood ear fungus, about 2 tsp dry sherry and a generous amount of ground white pepper. Loved them!

Used wanton wrappers. First round was crispy on the outside and raw on the inside. Brought the heat way down and extended the time. Perfect. Easy. Don't skip the dipping sauce! Highly recommended!

Amazingly good. I also used premade wonton wrappers, but I did not pre-cook the pork and it came out perfectly. The ginger really makes this. Yum. Husband and I devoured all dumplings greedily.

easy peasy japanesy, we also call these gyozas. I made them with bought wrappers, I just used pork flavoured with ginger, garlis, soy and mirin and rice vinegar. So clearly it's a very adaptable recipe. They disappeared rapidly, my 7 and 9 year old loved them.

Excellent! I also made these with store bought wonton wrappers, and got way more than 24 dumplings since the wrappers were so small. Needless to say, they were all gone within minutes! Only change: I cooked the pork slightly before stuffing the wrappers since the store bought ones cook way faster than the meat would.

Delicious. I used premade wrappers to save time, so I can't comment on that, but the filling and sauce were flavorful and easy to make.

This is our go-to dumpling recipe and highly recommend it. The first few times I made these dumplings I made the skins myself but have since stopped as I can get some really great dumpling wrappers from the local (SLC) Asian market that taste just as good. Apart from that I stick to the recipe and it has never let me down.

Excellent recipe, I used a (atlas with a motor attachment) pasta machine to roll out the dough to the right thinness, they were perfect

I recently catered a dinner party for 10 people. I forgot the wonton wrappers I like from Chinatown, so I had to buy some in the countryside where the party was. Unfortunately they weren't very good and I had to make dough from this recipe on short notice. They were a great hit, and though I made several other appetizers/hors d'oeuvres these stuck out. I made a dipping sauce with light soy sauce, minced ginger, sesame seed oil and green onion. People loved them. The pleating technique will take some time for me to master though.

I make the recipe as given and it's perfect. Like others, I found the dough doesn't make as many as it ought to, probably because I don't roll thin enough, but it is easy to make. I make these often and freeze, first on a sheet on the floured paper towel, then put in plastic bags. They are wonderful to have on hand for a quick lunch. You can't have too many in the frezer as they are addictive. Cook as directed, without thawing. The frozen ones take slightly longer to cook. The pleating does take practice but now we have it down, my 12 year-old daughter and I make 6 or 7 dozen at a time and have a blast together.

I was not familier with 'pot-stickers'.. My sister loves 'em and was coming for the weekend. So I followed the recipe. EXCELLENT! I too need to improve my pleating-skills but WOW, they are tasty!!! Try them!

I made this recipe exactly as directed and they were great-the dipping sauce was the perfect complement. I got 25 dumplings and used just about all of the filling. Couldn't quite get the pleating technique down, but they still looked great.

These were really good. Better than any other chinese dumplings I have ever made. I did use purchased wrappers, and next time I will make my own, the purchased ones were just too thin. I also did not place in the pan as directed.

I did not add water chestnuts, and used about 3 large garlic cloves, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. My dough only made enough for about 16 pot stickers and I had a lot of the filling leftover. (We made meatballs from it.) All in all, the taste is nice, and if you use a heavy bottomed pan the golden cruncy bottoms turn out great. They're pretty close to what I used to buy on the street in Shanghai.
