Nice moist muffin. I didn't have enough lemons for the 1.5 tbl of zest. Next time would add a little lemon juice. Also used only 1 stick of butter and 4 tbl of applesauce.

Delicious! These muffins have enough corn flavor without that hit-you-over-the-head dry corn taste of cornbread (which I'm not a huge fan of.) I substituted applesauce for half the butter, but other than that followed the recipe straight. Will def make these again.

These were divine and so easy to make. I reduced the butter to 1 stick but otherwise followed the recipe. Will definitely be making these again.

These were real easy muffins. As others I also cut back on the butter and they turned out perfect, the tops of them were still a little boring in appearance despite the sugar on top. Will make them again

I almost didn't make these because of the discussion about the butter, but I am so glad that I did. These are really delicious, and I'd definitely make again. Yes, these are ultra-buttery, and I do think that the butter can be reduced (although it does make them more luscious). When I removed the muffins from the pan, there was a little pool of butter in each cup, so that gives you an indication that there is excess butter in here. But they are definitely delicious and worth making.

THis recipe (with the butter cut to 1 stick) was an absolute hit...the guys brought their friends back to try it at a neighborhood kiln firing!! It's best fresh out of the oven, but my husband finished his off a day later with no complaints!

Prepared as directed, but with 2% milk instead of whole. I didn't find them greasy, but they were fairly loose in the muffin cups (i.e. not solid). I made a double batch and used part of the batter for 12 muffins and the rest of the batter in a ceramic quiche mold (the typical white one with flared edges). I used the quiche mold one for a brunch and the cake looked lovely against the white.

very good made as 12 muffins, using 1 stick of butter, 2% milk and no sanding sugar. mine took a little longer to bake than specified.

Wonderful and easy. The cupcake cups work well. I also cut back on the butter but did everything else exactly a written. Will make again.

These turned out great - I took a few of the recommendations below. Cut down on the butter, used buttermilk rather than milk, and added 1/2 cup more raspberries. They were best when still a little warm, but were fine the next day.

These taste just fine, but they are so greasy that they soaked right through the paper liners and left behind so much grease in the muffin pan that I could have baked a batch of cupckaes without sticking! What a waste of fine butter.

I "lightened" this recipe by using buttermilk instead of regular and by only using 1 stick of butter instead of 1.5, and the recipe still worked very well. The muffins were very moist and just sweet enough for my taste. I added a little more raspberries than called for too. I was surprised that they didn't have as much of a corn bread taste as I would have expected.

Followed the recipe to a "T" which is unusual for me, however, these muffins were nothing more than fine. I will continue on my quest to find a scrumptious raspberry muffin!

I changed the recipe slightly and these are AMAZING! Instead of 1C cornmeal I used 1/2C cornflour and 1/2C medium grind cornmeal, Bobs Red Mill brand. The 1/2C of cornmeal gives them a great crunch. I made these with raspberries and bluberries and used 2 cups of berries each time. Delicious!

These were great. I showed up 20 minutes late to work to bring them and it was well worth it! Recommendation - don't skimp on the lemon zest.

Don't know what's the big fuss, thought it was just so-so. Too sweet, bland, not enough raspberries and definitely reminiscent of a commercial muffin. And the recipe definitely yields 12 rather than 15 muffins.

Rating: 4
Delicious. I think the cornmeal weighs them down so that they're more flat than other muffins I've made. However, it does add a nice flavor that balances the tartness of the berries. These are definately a keeper.

These were delicious muffins, but I really think the recipe should be used for ~12 muffins instead of ~15. They came out looking pathetically small. They also cooked way faster than expected (maybe due to altitude here?). Still, these are delicious and I will definitely be making them again.

I can't say enough about this recipe. We loved them! I used frozen berries, but otherwise made no changes. I would highly recommend it.

Oh my gosh, a disappearing muffin recipe!! This is a perfect muffin! I substituted our Thanksgiving relish; cranberry, ginger and orange. The muffin has a nice crispy crust..and a lovely tender inside.. I would caution you that if the milk is too cold, it will take your melted butter back to solid. It is easily recoverable, but to avoid this, just make sure your milk is close to room temperature. I didn't have the sanding sugar, but the muffins are just fine without it.

ohmyGOD, I could eat my weight in these muffins - and, evidently, the 60-some-odd people at the brunch I made them for felt the same. HUGE hit!! The only change I made was to add about 50% more raspberries ... this made them a bit messier and less likely to hold a perfect muffin shape, but they were soooo good. Not too sweet, not too tart ... they keep nicely for a couple of days and don't need to be reheated before serving. YUM!

Medium coarse cornmeal gives a little crunch to these not-too-sweet muffins. There is no need to line the muffin pan if you use a non-stick pan with a light coating of butter. And I accidentally used two whole eggs and one yolk instead of the other way around - maybe that's why they baked a little quicker? After ten minutes, the tops were smoothly golden and the sugar mostly just bounced off, but they taste great.

These are so good. I only have one muffin tin, so I made 12 muffins using up all but a spoonful of the batter. I used frozen berries because they're often better than the fresh ones available here and lime zest because it's what I had. I'll make these again.

I used frozen blueberries instead of raspberries, lemon extract instead of the zest and soymilk with some vinegar (sort of like buttermilk) instead of the milk. These muffins were DELICIOUS and MOIST--even a few days later. Definately would make again with fresh blueberris or raspberries when it becomes the season.

Fabulous muffins! Really different and tasty.

i just made this recipe without looking at the reviews first. I had just picked the raspberries that morning and followed the recipe to the letter. They were delicious. I made full size and a half dozen of mini muffins to put on the breakfast tray with the coffee as we are a Bed and Breakfast. Guests wanted the recipe so I'm here to print it out for them.

I used blueberries that I had and they turned out very nice. I agree a little to much butter. Using the blueberries they were very sweet.

Was disappointed in this one. I thought they were just OK. My father said they were "different," but he "wasn't sure if he liked them." And my mother said there was too much lemon flavor which took away from the raspberry. I don't know..........

I made this dish with fresh raspberries that we picked that day and the muffins seemed to be to tart for my husband and I. I would definitly add more sugar next time I make this with the fresh raspberries. The cornmeal was great in the muffins but it needed to be sweeter for us. I will try these again, since they are great for breakfast. We were disappointed since it got such great reviews.

Muffins beyond compare! The lemon and raspberry is so delicious together. Made it twice in one weekend and they soon disappeared.

Very good, nice addition to add to an assorted muffin basket. I did cut down on the butter as someone had suggested (used 1 stick) and they came out just fine.

I probably will decrease the butter in these muffins next time I make them. They are extremely rich. My family loved the combination of flavors.

These muffins were very good, though not as decadent as the "mix in " muffin recipe at this site (a friend described those as "the best thing she has ever eaten"(banana choc.chip version) Anyway, these are very good, even excellent, just not as rich at the others. I used frozen raspberries(due to cost of fresh) about 1 cup, and they tasted delicious. Definitely add all of the lemon zest, 1TBL is not enough(I thought 1 1/2 sounded like too much, I was wrong.) Cooking time was exact.

We ate these warm and they were wonderful. I used 1% milk and they still were very rich. I will definitely make them again for guests.
