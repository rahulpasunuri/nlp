This was an immense amount of work for an okay curry. The meat was cooked properly and was delicious, but I was very disappointed in the basic elements of the stew. I was expecting so much more. I omitted the hot pepper for those who didn't like as much heat and added Thai Garlic Chile sauce instead. I'm sure the pepper would not have changed the dish. Too much work for too little.

To all you four forks, are you on crack? I love fish sauce, but agreed that the amount was too much, so I just went with a few splashes - still waaaaay too salty. I gave it two forks for potential, cut down fish sauce and increase liquid (coconut milk or stock), and I think it will be really good. On a humorous note, I subbed habaneros for dried chiles (I know). My hubby literally was crying and we both got sick from the salt and hot.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic! Being Indian myself and my wife Thai, this is the perfect combination of ethnic flavors. I mean this recipe simply nails it. If you can't find beef shank, try a small rump roast or small tri tip. Braising in coconut milk keeps any cut of beef nice and moist. As everyone wrote previously, there is a major typo. Please use only 1 1/2 tablespoons of fish sauce, not cups. And this dish is spicy hot. Be forewarned. Thai style, it's a 7...but for Americans, it's an 11!!! If you like it hot, go for it...but most people should probably cut the red chiles in half. You can always add chile oil or flake when serving.

This dish was quite simply delicious. The complexity was wonderful, heat level was nice. It hits you up front and fades quickly. I had the same reaction 'A Cook from Jersey City' had. 1.5 cups of fish sauce seems quite excessive. I think I used 2 tablespoons instead. I substituted orange juice for the tangerine/tangelo juice (couldn't find it).

This is a fantastic recipe, but I had to comment on what must be a typo: 1 1/2 cups of fish sauce!?!? I can't believe no one has commented on this. In my experience with Thai cooking, I've never used more than a little bit of fish sauce, which has such a pungent flavor it doesn't take a lot to make a big difference. But since everyone had such positive things to say about the rececipe, I blindly followed the instructions, thinking the flavor must somehow get diluted in the braising liquid. Wrong! It was so salty my boyfriend and I both almost gagged. I saved it by dumping out some of the liquid and diluting with two additional cans of coconut milk, which was a shame because we made this from scratch and the spice mixture is really incredible--it easily blows away any store-bought paste. I will make this again, but the next time I might try 1 1/2 tablespoons, or even teaspoons of fish sauce. Other thoughts about the recipe, as long as I'm writing the review: I'm kind of a wimp about spicy foods, so I was worried about the number of peppers. I took out all the seeds and then added half of them back in. With the extra coconut milk, the level of heat wzas just about right, but I think in the future I will add fewer red peppers. Also, we thought the roasted pepper was good, but the texture would have been nicer if we just added a pepper at the end and sauteed until it was still crisp. We also added suger snap peas. Other than that, the spice mixture was not too time consuming and it was well worth the effort. Don't use store-bought paste!!!

Great recipe. Also used store bought curry paste. But, braised the beef. Added red pepper, onion, and white mushroom after pulling the beef out of the oven. Will def make again.

Really good. I made a modified version of this, using the dry spice mix, but then using commerical red thai curry paste with some extra lemongrass and galangal. Also added some fish sauce. Really really nice, and much easier if you cheat like I did. Tastes a lot like the thai red curry you get for takeout, only much better. Also, I added some peas and basil leaves. Here is what I did: 1. Make dry spice mix. 2. Brown beef already cut into strips in a little olive oil. 3. Add 2-4 TB premade red curry paste and dry spice mix and cook for 1-2 minutes. 3. Add coconut milk, chopped lemongrass and chopped galangal and 1/4 cup fish sauce, 1/3 cup palm sugar, 1/4 cup broth or water. 4. Simmer to combine flavors, and then add peanuts and basil leaves at last minute. Few dishes, great flavor!

Am I an idiot or does it never say how much of the the spice mix to add to the curry and when you should do so? Other than that, the recipe is delicious (if a bit salty) as written.

Couldn't find palm sugar so I used dark brown sugar and some maple syrup instead. Not a quick meal but well worth it.

this is a nice mix of regional spices, particularly the anise, cardamom, and lemongrass. be sure to chop the lemongrass extra fine (we're talking powdery here) or it will be unpleasant. galangal and ginger are different enough that you should use both. also, a few kaffir lime leaves would be appropriate. what's not appropriate is suggesting that we incredibly expensive use fleur de sel. ignore that bit of posturing and use kosher or basic sea salt.

If you like spicy exotic food you will love this recipe. I followed the instructions pretty much completely (found some of the ingredients at the local Asian market). There were a lot of steps, but it wasn't difficult. I used a nonstick skillet instead of a wok. the results were absolutely worth it. Next time I will double the recipe.
