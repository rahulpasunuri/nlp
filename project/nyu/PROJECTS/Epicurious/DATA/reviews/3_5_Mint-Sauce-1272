eesh - way too thick. I was raised in north western Colorado where lamb was plentiful and mint sauce was thin and minty. I tried to salvage this with some rosemary and more white wine vinegar.

A little too heavy.... Lamb is such a rich dish ( or roast pork) that the mint sauce has to be light..... here is how I did it...... 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh mint leaves 1 cup malt vinegar 2 tablespoons white sugar heat up the malt vinegar, add the sugar and mint and simmer for say..10 min. then throw in some CHOPPED mint leaves, and PRESTO... mint sauce.. Alot less time, and more to the English way of cooking.

Shallots were $2 each at the local A&P, so I substituted mild onion with a sliver of garlic clove. Being short on time, I used the blender as suggested by another reviewer, and strained the hot mixture with a tea strainer. Then I returned the mixture to the pan with the cornstarch to thicken. Absolutely delicious with grilled loin lamb chops.

I made a few substitutions and alterations. First I used vegetable stock instead of beef broth, vegetable stock has a lighter color. Second I didn't have the time fo allow the sauce to sit and steep, so rather than straining out the mint and shallots I put the mixture in the blender, set to liquify and added the cornstarch once the mixture was smooth. I breifly simmered the mixture again after blending to get the cornstarch to thicken. The result was a very delicious rich green sauce which went very well with the roast lamb I was serving.

A few things on this recipe I might change. One is the type of broth. I would use chicken broth next time and use white pepper. The sauce was tasty but the color was brown from the beef broth. The taste of the amount of wine vinegar may be a bit overpowering for some but I enjoyed it. Maybe use a white balsamic the next time. I got a little confused when there was no mention in the body of the recipe about when to use the broth. I figured it out but did take another look to make sure.
