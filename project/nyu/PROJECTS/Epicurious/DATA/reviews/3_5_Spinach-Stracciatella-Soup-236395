I used to eat this soup when I was little, and it was by far my favorite soup that nonna used to make. But we would add some mince meat into it to add some extra flavour and we garnished with Parmesan cheese.

This soup is so elegant and tasty. And super fast. I added a bit of pastina to mine, but one time I'd like to try semolina instead. A quality stock is key in this one. If you don't have time to make one from scratch, just simmer some veggies in a store-bought stock for a bit to beef up the flavor like I did. Very tasty.

This soup was delicious. Using really good cheese is key. A good shot of pepper at the end really perked it up. Doubled the recipe, but not the eggs -- used 3. Yum.

This is pretty good but not my favorite stracciatella recipe. Fresh spinach is essential to good stratiattella. This recipe would be fine if you: 1) Chiffonade fresh spinach and put it directly in serving bowls with shaved (not finely ground) parmesan, and fresh pepper) 2) Pour the hot broth over the spinach, pepper and shaved cheese, and serve [If that's a pain, throw the fresh spinach in the pot right before serving so it just wilts, let guests garnish with cheese and pepper)

i made this recipe almost exactly as written except i used 3 lbs fresh spinach leaves, twice the cheese, extra stock, one extra egg. outstanding. it needs nothing else imo. tastes exactly like the way the italians do it. and i LOVE how fast this cooked up (minus the labor of using fresh spinach) i'm sure this will be on my life time menu.

The key is with the baquette - olive oil, cayenne pepper,cracked black pepper and a little garlic salt - broil the bread til crispy, then you have a nice dipping partner for this reasonably satisfying soup.

Fresh spinach really works nicely with this, and I added precooked and chopped BACON, as well. Really hit the spot. I used less water, and added garlic salt in lieu of regular salt.

This was really good how i made it, but i can see how people said it was boring if they followed the recipe. I used about 3 c. of homemade smoked turkey stock, which is very flavorful, 2 c. of store-bought chicken stock and about a cup of water. also used fresh spinach and put a parm rind in to cook with the soup. delicious!

As I read the recipe and the reviews, I felt some adjustments should be made. I only had fresh spinach, so I sauteed it in olive oil with some onions, garlic and mushrooms. Meanwhile, I heated 4c chicken broth, with 1/2 c lemon juice (we like things lemony. If you don't add more broth or some water and less lemon). Then I added the 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, and some red pepper. Then I added the spinach mix. I had some Greek kefalotiri in the house, which has a distinct flavor. I grated it and added it as well. My daughter wanted some noodles in there, so I added some vermicelli - perfect for soup. I added the eggs slowly and stirred. Don't know if it was supposed to be kinda stringy with pieces of egg white, but it was good. I added some fresh pepper before serving. My husband loved it. Even my 2 year old loved it!

I make this soup but I mix thawed spinach with lots of garlic cooked in olive oil. This kicks up the taste alot. My family loves spinach. Sometimes I fix fresh spinach this way just for a veggie. Any leftover I put in soup. Also I add just a touch of soy sauce.

This soup brings me great memories! I've enjoy reading some of the interesting variations which I will try someday. For now, I think I will keep it as it is.

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup. I increased the chicken broth, added extra cheese and used a mix of 4 kinds of cheeses. Then to top it off I added homemade mini chicken meatballs that I use in another recipe. We omitted the bread and used a dense crusty bread for dunking.

This sucker is pretty bland. I added lots of garlic, mushrooms, a little herbs and spices, and panko breadcrumbs for texture and density, and it still was just OK. I left out the bread - that wouldn't have added flavor. Not a stellar recipe, but certainly edible.

I liked the recipe- I substitued Frozen parmigano regiano rinds in place of the grated parm, put them in with the broth (also upped the broth and reduced the water) at the begining so they would melt into the soup- a bit of fresh lemon at the end and it's a wonderful soup

the recipe is a bit bland as is. i added a couple cloves of garlic, but it didn't help much. i would probably skip the water.

I really liked this, but I had to do the Epicurious thing and make some changes. I increased the broth to 8c, didn't add water,used 1 pkg, of frozen spinach, and used 3 eggs. I will make this again because it is a quick meal, and I have these ingredients on hand all the time.

I omitted the baguette due to avoiding refined carbs. The soup itself was pretty simple and light. My daughter (6 yo) said it lacked any flavor and seemed to be missing something. Later we added a touch of lemon juice which seemed to enhance the mild flavor. Next time, I probably would make it only for myself & also used more cheese & add extra seasonings per other reviews. It was very filling.

I added some garlic, ground fennel, extra pepper, and a bit of white balsamic vinegar. The only pasta I had was penne, so in it went. My wife proclaimed it the best soup she had had. We used crusty bread on the side for sopping up the goodies.

I've had this soup in a few Italian restaurants. Some serve it with pasta, like small shells, some just serve it as is. I tried making it myself and put the pasta in. It makes for a good, simple and inexpensive meal...or two or three, if you're single!

Quite good, easy to make. I didn't think the toasted bread added anything to the dish, but maybe that's just me.

Four forks for the remarkably high ratio of taste to amount of effort to prepare. The cheese infuses most of the flavor, so pick a fine Parmigiano-Reggiano, and do not skimp. With a good crusty baguette (Grand Central Rustic Baguette---yum!) and the right wine, this approaches the sublime. My kids eat it up, too.

A really good basic soup. I love the egg white part so I add 4 egg whites and only one yolk (healthier!) and then add a lot of freshly ground black papper, a touch of freshly ground nutmeg and a little hot pepper. Also a great addition are baby shrimp if you have them.

This came out great for me! I sauteed onion and fresh kale, and added two cloves of garlic, salt and pepper. Then I put in some regular chicken broth and a little water and heated it up. Then I put in a cup of romano cheese. I did put a tiny amount of boullion in the end for some extra oomph, and it turned out wonderful!

I also added some crushed red pepper to the broth, and served prosciutto with the bread. Next time I might subsitute some light cream in lieu of the 2nd cup of water. Otherwise, a nice, easy recipe.

I liked it and would make it again but I have a question for someone more versed in stracciatella than am I. Is the objective to cook the eggs and have essentially stringy scrambled eggs (as I did) or should I have tempered the eggs to avoid cooking them and used them as a thickener?

Not worth eating.

I boiled a bone-in chicken breast with carrot, celery, onion and a chunk of lemon (& of course water) to make my own stock. To the almost finished soup I added the cooked chicken and a handful of alphabet pasta to make it a bit heartier. I had to use fresh spinach. It was divine. The slightly lemony broth was fantastic.

Loved this dish. I added shredded roasted chicken from Costco one time and cooked shrimp another and turned this soup into a meal.

This was good -- I'd make the changes the previous reviewer made about some lemon juice etc... It was VERY healthy and so easy to make. Most importantly, my 5 year old daughter liked it.

We made as directed, but found it bland when tasted. Extra salt, lemon juice, and a slug of dry sherry improved the flavor considerably. As it is, this dish is cheering, filling, and very economical.
