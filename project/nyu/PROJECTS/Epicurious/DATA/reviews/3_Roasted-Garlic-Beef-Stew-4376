We make this every winter, its quick and its awesome. I do not add any parsnips or rutabaga myself, but to each his own.

Wonderful comfort food and super easy to make. The great thing about this stew is that you can alter it according to your preferences in vegetables and whatnot. I've made it for a blustery day indoors for my roomies and they thoroughly enjoyed it. I added a bit more meat and stewed it longer, also added a couple of bay leaves and later removed them for some great flavor. To make it thicker and heartier I grated a potato into the stew during the last five minutes of cooking. Excellent texture and flavor! I'm definitely making it again.

I played with the recipe a bit and it has a permanent place in my recipe book. I grill pieces of meat over briquettes and wood chips so the meat had a nice smokey flavor before cutting it up to put into the pot. I make the recipe with 2 lbs of beef tenderloin since we like a beefy stew. Im not fond of sage, so I omitted it from the recipe. In addition to the original recipe I add stewed tomatoes, corn and a tablespoon or so of Worcestershire Sauce.

I don't usually do this, but because I used this recipe for the basis of my desire to use a pound of gifted moose stew meat, I have rated the recipe and listed my changes and additions. I also made this on President Obama's inauguration day in honor of Sarah Palin who I know also supports our new President and loves a good stew. That said, here is the information to make a great moose meat stew. I replaced the beef tenderloin for the moose stew meat and browned the meat as suggested and then cooked it on low in the pan for an additional 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. I added to the vegetables; 1 large leek, light green and white parts only chopped and rinsed 1/2 pound of fresh oyster mushrooms, 2 large turnips peeled and chopped 1 habenera pepper seeds and all chopped, 2 tablespoons of dried parsley, 2 tablespoons of dried basil, doubled amount of thyme and rubbed sage, 1 tablespoon of paprika, 1 tablespoon of cumin, double the amount of beef broth, The Habanera or Scotch Bonnet pepper added real heat to the taste and like all stews this was even better the second day.

This is the most disappointing recipe I have tried from this site in years. Thanks to previous reviewers, I did halve the spices and didn't waste tenderloin. Even so, this was a huge disappointment. Try either Gordon's Pot Roast or Mahogany Beef Stew with Red Wine and Hoisin Sauce (both from this site) for a much better meal!

I used about 1 1/2 pounds of meat and twice the recommended garlic. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. The stew turned out quite well with a delicious savory flavor. I will probably use even more garlic next time, just as a matter of personal preference. I did not have a problem with the lack of saltiness, though my companion complained. Salt is the easiest thing to fix as it does not need to simmer in the pot to achieve its final flavor. Just grab the grinder and get on with it.

I tried this recipe for a football get together and It was very bland. I had to add quite a bit of seasonings and salt. No one at the party was very fond of it! I would not make this again!

Rating: 1
This recipe lacked flavor, I had to add alot of salt and even some red pepper flakes and still this was a so-so recipe. I made this for a dinner party and it didn't receive the ravest reviews! I won't make this dish again.

The essence of this recipe is the roasted garlic and I wouldn't change that! But I did alter the ingredients and think it didn't compromise the taste and perhaps even made it better. After browning the beef and removing it from the pan, I added another Tbsp of butter with sliced carrot, onion, sweet potato, red bell pepper, white potato, and celery and roasted garlic cloves. I sauteed this mixture for about 10 minutes before adding vegetable broth (no beef on hand) and red wine. Sprinkled in thyme (no sage in the cupboard). Then followed the recipe as directed and it was so wonderful.

Yum! Nice comfort winter dish. Don't bother wasting $$$ on the tenderloin, just cook it longer. Love the root veggies and vary them--turnips are good, too. To the cook who said "Not enough salt"...HELLO! It says season with salt and pepper. TO YOUR TASTE. Duh.

This was good but I made changes as well. I used bison, which actually turned out a bit tough. I also used carrots, and onion, two potatoes and some parsips. Finally, I used half the broth and a can of diced tomatoes. Served over egg noodles. overall pretty good, not too thick. Meat was a little tough.

My latest favorite stew. I added 2 strips of bacon. I used cheap,lean beef. I used $6 cab and fresh herbs. Cat lovers be warned! Both my cats hated it. I put some of the stew gravy on the floor; my smart cat trotted up expectently and jerked back his head; he then cautiously sniffed again, he then began to energetically scratch the carpet, like he does in his litter box when he's done his BM. The message, I assume, was "Go bury this stuff!" A few minutes later, my beautiful but brainless cat came into the room, strolled over to the dish, and did exactly the same thing! The message is clear, cats agree that this stew should be buried immediately! But this is an outstanding stew and you should try it. Try it on your cats and post the results.

blah! not enough herbs, not enough salt - just not worth making again.

Wasn't too sure about this as I was making it...a stew without onions? But it came out incredible. Used part of a 7-bone roast, cooked it for about an hour and then threw the veggies in for another hour or so. Didn't use parsnips because they always have this woody core that's nasty and a pain to get rid of. Did use rutabega though - I love rutabega! I also followed other reviewers' suggestion to cut the herbs in half, and I think that was plenty. Used one whole head of roasted garlic and probably could have doubled that. Actually the next time I make this, I will double or triple the recipe, cuz with 3 of us (one of us works out in the cold all day, and comes home Hungry) there's none left. Anyway, an incredibly yummy stew, may become my favorite!

It wasn't the rutabega (that everyone is complaining about) -- it's the dried spices... too overpowering, cut it in half. I agree with the reviewers who used a cheaper cut of meat.. just cook it longer. this was delicious.

Rating: 3
I also used a cheaper cut of beef and simply stewed it for a lot longer. It was very simple to make (especially if you peel and chop ahead of time). I doubled the recipe as I happened to have 2lbs beef on hand and it made a BIG pot of steaming delicious stew. Probably could have fed about 7. Will make this again.

I have made this several times. I usually use about half of the rutabaga and more potatoes. Each time it has had rave reviews from my company.

Rating: 3
I have been made this recipe more times than I can count. I omit the rutabaga (it freaks out the kids) but leave the rest of the recipe unchanged. Kids love it (we feed 6 of them-5 will eat it) and the adults love it too.

I loved this stew. We live on stews and soups in the winter at my house, because the crockpot ensures that we can have a hot meal several times a week (with lunches for mom and dad the next couple of days). BTW, a rutabaga could get a complex reading this site.

Rating: 1
This was not good at all. The rutabaga was almost impossible to cut. Then it took forever for this dish to cook. It tasted terrible to me.

Rating: 4
This is one of our favorite recipes. I do omit the rutabaga and parsnip,(increase the carrots and potatoes) and don't put as much thyme in it. It is wonderfully thick, and flavorful. Very easy and quick. Can't understand why anyone wouldn't like this one!

I make this everytime.. but I drop the rutabaga and add mushrooms and an onion.. serve it with a garnish of sourcream with a little horseradish added.. it rocks

Rating: 1
Big disappointment. I made this last night. The rutabaga took forever to cook and there was more of it than the carrots, potatoes, and beef combined. There was no "soup liquid". My husband and I took two bites and threw the whole thing out and had sandwiches instead. This recipe can probably be adjusted to be better but why bother.

The first time i made this recipe i was a purist, but the rutabaga and parsnips really annoyed me, so i ommitted them the next go-around and added 2 potatoes, a few stalks of chopped celery and a few handfuls of baby carrots. Great taste! Everyone in my house just loves it!

Thought this was a wonderful stew. The roasted garlic gave it great flavor! Can't understand those who didnt like it.

I've made this stew twice now. It was actually ok, but alot sweeter than I expected. The taste of rutabaga is overpowering---I think using 1/2 a rutabaga is plenty. Maybe I was disappointed because this recipe had glowing reviews, and I had hoped to end my search for a delicious, savoury stew. My search continues...

I added mushrooms and celery because i love them but personally found the stew to be somewhat bitter. Maybe it was the wine (i don't like wine!)? My husband liked it (didn't find it bitter) but he didn't love it.

Although I would probably not make this recipe again, as I have other recipes that I much prefer. It was a very good winter dish. Full bodied with lots of lovely root vegetables...a wonderful excuse for a good glass of red wine.

I'm not a big stew fan, but this dish won me over. It's very easy to prepare and the roasted garlic makes it so delicious!!

I came back for the recipe because it is delicious, and my husband and son never even noticed that it is jam-packed with outrageously healthy root vegetables! Leftovers make a wonderful filling for cornish pasty or a pot-pie with a little thickening.

This is a fast, flavorable recipe. Instead of using parsnips and rutabagas, I increased the amount of potatoes and carrots. I add about two cups of fresh button mushrooms, halved or quartered, depending on size. I'll also add fresh rosemary if I have it handy.

Rating: 3
Easy and good, but needs a little help. I put in an extra potato instead of a rutabega and added extra wine. It is a VERY thick stew, if you don't add wine, you can eat it with a fork.

One of the best, easiest stew recipes - the parsnips add - do suggest increasing wine

Delicious and fast.

I added an onion; next time I'll add 2 and I doubled the amount of wine (it did need a little help). I also used red potatoes because I feel they have more flavor and they take less time to cook. One large parsnip would probably be enough; I also used an extra rutabaga. You have to really like root vegetables to enjoy this recipe. Let it sit and eat it the next day.

This stew was well received by my guests and family. It was very easy to put together and tasted great. I suggest serving it with some crusty bread to soak up the gravy.

I tried this several times from the Bon Appetit issue, but lost the magazine and rouxed(!!) the loss. Everyone who tried it liked it very much. It even gets better the next day. I have also added turnips. I've tried making it more like a soup as well. The garlic and herbs just make it. I'm so gald I found it again.

Great Stew. I didn't like to have the thyme floating around though so I put it and the sage into a cheescloth. I also dislike those exotic vegetables so I substitute traditional ones like peas and onions. In my opinion this serves more like 6.

I'm sorry; I don't get it. This is my least favorite of all the stews I have ever had. The herbs were overpowering and it had a sharp flavor. Don't waste your time unless you have the patience to tweek the recipe until it's satisfactory.

This is a phenomenal recipe. We served it at our last party and people were literally licking the bowl. I used a less-tender cut of meat than the recipe called for and had great success by just cooking a little longer.
