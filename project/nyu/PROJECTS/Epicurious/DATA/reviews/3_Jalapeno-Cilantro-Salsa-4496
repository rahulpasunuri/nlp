I added a can of mexican picante in lieu of the oil (trying to reduce my fat intake) and it was very good with the pork and chicken skewers I served.

I brought this to a Memorial Day picnic and everyone loved it. Interesting in its combination of flavors. I made it hot, adding a bit extra jalapenos. I also reduced the oil content by about half as the last cook suggested.

Great flavor and simple to prepare but way too much oil. Next time I will decrease the oil by at least half.
