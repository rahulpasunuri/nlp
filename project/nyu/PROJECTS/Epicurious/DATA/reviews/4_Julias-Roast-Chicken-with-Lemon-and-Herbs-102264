This was my first roasted chicken and it was delicious. My only issue is that I think in the future I would need to add a little water to the roasting pan so the carrots and onions don't get too burnt. Other than that is was pretty darn perfect.

This dish is very good; however, I must have missed the step to add liquid/broth to the bottom of the roasting pan. My chicken released very little juices and I had to add about 2 cups or more of stock to the bottom of the pan to prevent it from smoking. The deglazing sauce is delicious.

I reviewed this a few years ago with kudos. Since then, I also rub the cavity with a garlic clove, and more than double the onion and carrots, because they are so yummy! You'll be glad you did.

The best roast chicken ever. I did almost exactly what the cook from New York did -- I used several sprigs of fresh thyme, plenty of garlic, and big wedges of lemon, and the result was so delicious I finished off the whole chicken in two days all by myself. You can always count on Julia -- she'll never steer you wrong.

Best roast chicken I've ever made. I used a small bunch of fresh thyme and the unpeeled cloves of a nearly a whole garlic, and cut the large lemon into thick slices. Also used plenty of salt and pepper. Unexpectedly, the cooked lemon was delicious--rind and all. Only problem--I had to add water to the roasting pan a few times to keep it from drying out. Not a big deal.

A delicious recipe! The combination of herbs, veggies & lemon reminded me of how my mother makes roasted chicken. My family loved it and I will definitely make this recipe again.

This recipe has become the only way I roast a chicken; it comes out perfectly every time. I often substitute fresh rosemary for the sage leaves when I don't have sage on hand and add a few cloves of garlic to the chicken cavity as well.

This was my first try at making a roast chicken and I thought it tasted delicious. I wasn't going to make the sauce, but I figured I would give it a try. It was delicious. Next time I may add a little flour so it is more like a gravy. I noticed that there wasn't enough moisture dripping from the chicken so I just poured some olive oil on top after about half an hour. I also added extra butter and fresh rosemary for a delicious flavor. I took the other cooks suggestions and added extra carrots and onions. Next time I would try to squeeze in even more, they tasted so good with the sauce. My only complaint was that the chicken took much longer than the recipe suggested. I didn't have a thermometer so I only discovered this after I started to cut it up. I had to then put it back in the oven. I think total oven time for my 4lb chicken was about an hour and 45 min!

I used herbs de provence that a friend picked up recently while in Provence. I used a 5 lb chicken and sprinkled 1 tsp in the cavity. I also sprinkled the herbs liberally on the outside after I massaged with the butter. Did the carrot and onion and the sauce. Cooked in the convection oven at 400 for the first 15 mins, and 325 for the remaining 1 hr and 45 mins. Two thumbs up.

Good old Julia! She was the Queen of cooking! This recipe is so wonderful. I will always roast my chickens this way from now on! Excellent! Incredibly moist. (I ignored taking out the wishbone:-) We had it with twice-baked potatoes with goat cheese and chives, also excellent! Bravo!

This was excellent!!! My family usually doesn't like "homemade" roast chicken, but even my picky husband loved this. It was tender and juicy with a fantastic flavor! This will be my one and only roast chicken recipe from now on!!

I like the phrase "a fine, fresh chicken." Please consider spending an extra couple of bucks on poultry that has been humanely raised on a natural diet without antibiotics. At Stop & Shop (northeastern grocer), look in the specialty meats dept. for Bell & Evans. Chickens (and other animals) raised in a wholesome and minimal-stress environment are superior in quality (and easier on the conscience, if you're anything like me).

This recipe was so fantastic and easy. It took minimal effort to prepare, and it made the whole house smell wonderful while it was roasting. I served it with butternut squash sauteed with shallots and sage (from epicurious) and a mixed green and herb salad. What a great meal for fall in New England!

The rewards from the dish were disproportionate to the effort. For very little work, with a nice chicken, a simple recipe gave a moist, succulent chicken with a crisp skin, and great flavour. Really a good recipe for the new cook too.

I thought this recpie was absolutely deliciious and SO easy. This was my first time preparing whole chicken and I was very impressed with how tasty and moist the chicken was. I didn't have a roasting pan or any twine, but it still came out excellently. I will certainly be making this again and again.

This is the best roast chicken I have ever eaten. The drumstick meat was so tender that the bone just slid out! The pan sauce was amazingly flavorful. This will become a standard special dinner in our home.

This is the best roast chicken recipe I have ever used! I always add mushrooms - cut in quarters and I deglaze with dry vermouth. It is amazingly yummy. The left over chicken, mushrooms and pan juice (if there is any leftover) is amazing for chicken and rosemary pie. I purchase phyllo, saute some garlic and fresh rosemary in olive oil and make a lovely sauce out of the pan juice, chicken and mushrooms. Roll the mixture up in some phyllo and voila, you have marvelous individual pies that rival anything I can find in Greektown on the Danforth in Toronto! That's what my husband says, anyway.

This was so easy and delicious! Instead of the sage, I used thyme and rosemary from my garden. It turned out wonderfully. The deglazing sauce was flavorful, and I omitted the extra added butter. No need for it.

I have made this many times now. I did it yesterday with a 5-6 pound bird and cooked it at 425 for 1 hour and 30 minutes. It came out perfect.

Wow was this good and simple. Since I had some things to do in the after noon I prepared the recipe, which I doubled, up until the point that it goes into the oven and kept it in the fridge for about 2 hours. When I came home it was ready to roast. One thing I did differently was to put a bit more butter under the skin of the breast. I used the herbs de Provence, which I just brought back from the south of France, and it was perfection. The carrots and onions that where left in the pan where also great as a side dish, and as other reviewers said you might want to make even more. The deglazing sauce was also very good.

Excellent! I've tried numerous roast chicken recipies, including one in a Dean & DeLuca cookbook I received for Christmas in 2000. I didn't think it could get ANY better than that! Boy, was I wrong! This is the best recipe for roast chicken EVER. I watch Julia and Jacques Pepin religiously. The recipe, including the instructions on removing the wishbone, were practically idiot proof. I felt as if I was getting a personal tutorial from Julia and Jacques! The chicken was juicy, moist and delicious. I made the deglazing sauce and used more carrots and onions than the recipe called for. I also served with brown rice with dried apricots and chopped pecans, and seasoned with coriander and thyme. My husband hasn't stopped raving about the chicken, and this is a recipe that I will use again. - Miss JR

This was probably the best roast chicken I've ever made. I used herbes de Provence, since getting fresh sage was almost impossible. The carrots at the end were also great. Next time, I'll triple the carrots and onions for a ready-made and delicious vegetable side dish.

Very moist, pretty bird. I placed sage leaves and lemon slice under the skin, and found that it gave the chicken a relatively strong lemony flavor (maybe too much). Never could quite detect the sage, though.

I loved this chicken. It was easy and incredibly moist. I didn't have a roasting rack, so I set the chicken on sliced lemons, onions, celery and carrots- it worked out just fine. I also jammed some butter & sage between the skin & the breast as well.

Soooo Good!!! I used herbs de provence doubled the amount of herbs, chicken was 5 lbs. Rubbed lemon under skin of chicken and forgot to rub butter on skin, still turned out great. I added carrots, celery and garlic in roasting pan a little early. The pas sauce is so good. The drippings with the lemon flavor make it different than other sauces. Try this recipe, it'll turn out to be your standard roast chicken recipe. The best I've made!!!

Made this for Rosh Hashanah and it was so wonderful! I made a few modifications: first, I used rosemary as my herbs. I cooked a 8.3 lb chicken, took about 2 hours. I had the following vegetables in the bottom of the roasting pan: 1 green pepper (cut in wedges) , a handful of baby carrots, 1 onion (cut in wedges), 1 lb of mushrooms. I didn't deglaze the pan; instead I put all the veggies and some of the chicken juices in a food processor. The sauce didn't look pretty but tasted FABULOUS.

This was delicious. I brined the chicken for several hours with a mixture of kosher salt and sugar and then followed the recipe from there. I used fresh rosemary, since I didn't have any sage or tarragon. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. The sauce was excellent with it.

I'm sorry to say I am not as enamored of this recipe as the others. However, I would have given it 2 1/2 forks if we had a the half-fork rating in here! I do like the crispiness of the skin, and it certainly was juicy (I used fresh rosemary instead of sage). I might give it another try.

I love this recipe. I have made it several times and I usually use about 1T of dried tarragon along with the lemon. My husband really enjoys it too.

We have been roasting variations of this recipe for years; it's also good with fresh rosemary sprig as the herb and a couple of peeled, slightly smashed garlic cloves added to the cavity; a wedge of fresh orange with the lemon is good, too.
