This slaw is excellent! I added a little sugar to cut the bitterness of the cabbage. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

Everyone loved this slaw! I added a little onion. Served it with Peruvian Grilled Chicken.

This was pretty good and worked well with the tacos. I added Mexican chili powder, cumin, and drizzled some honey. I had so many spicy condiments with many of the same spices, so I wanted to add a touch of sweetness in there as well. I also used different colored fresh cabbage. Without these changes, this recipe would have fallen flat.

This was easy to make and so delicious. Made it as a side dish for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit with family. Comments received that it was light and refreshing. There was not enough dressing as the recipe calls for as it was a little dry, so I added another tablespoon and a half of fresh lime juice and oil. As per other cooks' suggestions, I added cumin, chili powder, and a sprinkle of dried basil. I also added a teaspoon or so of white sugar as I thought it was too tart. The coleslaw mix had carrots and purple cabbage to make it colorful. Will definitely make again.

This is a great alternative to the regular slaws out there! I add honey, cider vinegar & cumin to the dressing and serve with fish tacos. Always a hit!

Absolutely refreshing as a condiment! We made the chicken tacos and it was a a great match. I used the leftovers on barbequed chicken sandwiches. It would definitely need a little tweaking to stand on its own as a side dish.

I really liked this a lot but have to admit I made a few modifications. I added green onions, shredded carrots, cumin and chili powder and a pinch of cayenne. With modifications it stands on its own as a side dish but made as is it is a good topping for fish tacos if they're spicy enough.

I like this alot. I used a fresh head of cabbage, not the slaw mix which I think is always dry and flat tasting. I also amended the dressing by adding some honey to temper the lime. Honey lime cilantro is a classic combo that is wonderful in this dish.

Very good with the chicken tacos. I added some cumin, finely chopped red onion. I thought the lime flavor was a little too strong so I added maybe a teaspoon of Splenda and it was perfect!

Tasty and refreshing!

By itself, adequate, but a perfect accompaniment to spice rubbed grilled chicken tacos.

Good recipe, but needed a little something extra in order to stand on its own. Like other reviewers, I added scallions, and some cumin. I think shredded carrots would've been a perfect "other" thing to add also, but didn't have any on hand.

Yum. I added some sesame oil and scallions. Nice snack for dieting.

I thought this provided a wonderful crunch for the "Spice rubbed chicken tacos." I substituted broccoli slaw and it was great!

forget the bagged slaw and slice your own mix of red & green cabbage. There's never any left over!

I like to make this also with other herbs (parsley or chives), and sometimes will add a splash of vinegar. Love to make a big batch to eat during the week! Have had many compliments on how light & refreshing this is.

when used as part of the chipotle, chicken taco recipe -its great. wouldn't serve as a side, though.

This was great with the tacos. I took other reviewers' advice. I added scallions, a little hot sauce, doubled the lime juice and added a few drops of sesame oil.

Didn't impress us. Tried recipe a couple of times, as stated and with variations. Won't make again. So many recipes, so little time.

I'd give this 0 stars if I could! One cup of cilantro...UGH! This cr** tastes like tar. Only way to save this recipe is to substitute Italian parsley or another herb.

I liked this recipe because I love cilantro and the fresh flavor the lime juice gives it. I did make a few changes...I cut the salt in half because the first time making it I found it too salty. I added a few drops sesame oil, tabasco and a few sliced scallions.

Great lite version (like another reader said- no mayo).. more interesting than plain old lettuce- tastes very good.

This was great with the chipotle chicken tacos. I used brocoli slaw in mine and it was very tasty. Followed the receipe as written.

I have loved this recipe since the first time I had it, many years ago, in Central America, where it is a popular dish. A twist to this recipe is to slightly wilt the coleslaw mix in boiling water before adding the dressing. This will make it easier on the digestive tract for those who react to cabbage's gas-producing qualities. The texture is, of course, slightly different, closer to some of the German-style slaws.

I gave this 4 forks. I have made it multiple times now for various reasons. The ease of it for number one. An excellent dish without the typical mayo base. With the spice-rub chicken it was fab. I also LOVE cilantro and tended to use the whole bunch chopped in it. Guests have absolutely loved it as it was a new twist, great add in for fish or chicken tacos, and a wonderful, easy to prepare summer dish! Adding the salt to balance the acidity of the lime juice is also a must.

I made this with the spice-rubbed chicken and vegetable tacos. The slaw was OK--not outstanding. I think there are better slaw recipes out there.

Rating: 3
Maybe I had stronger cilantro than the other reviewers, because I thought this had plenty of flavor. I didn't think it needed any extra spice because we were eating it with the chicken tacos/chipotle cream which provided plenty of heat. Maybe I would feel differently if I were serving this by itself.

I made this slaw to go with the chicken tacos. I noted the posts about the slaw being a little bland. I had some left over dressing from the MEXICAN CHOPPED SALAD WITH HONEY-LIME DRESSING also on this site and I used it instead. It has the oil and lime juice but also has some honey and jalapeño in it. This adds a nice bite and was excellent with the tacos.

Made this with no changes and thought it was great on the chicken tacos. Will definitely make again.

Albeit very easy, this was surprisingly bland! Like the other reviewer, something seemed to be missing. There wasn't enough cilantro to warrant calling it a Cilantro Slaw because the taste didn't stand out. Either tweak the recipe or do another colelaw recipe altogether.

this was great with the tacos. added extra lime juice. It kind of seemed like it was missing something, just not sure what.
