Nice warming soup that is also healthy. I made this soup with baby redskins because I am not a fan of peeling potatoes. I waited until the last 15 minutes to add the kale, and when I did, I found the 16C lightly packed to be about 2x too much, so I didn't add it all. Even when it cooked down, I only needed half. Other than adding a dash of cayenne and a little pepper, I made no other changes. Yummy! I also broke up the potatoes with a wooden spoon to make a thicker, less chunky soup.

Made this following recipe as written after a hard day on the ski slope. Perfect ending to a perfect day - easy, tasty and filling.

I have made this recipe 3 times already and it's a family favorite. It is spicy, hearty, comforting and an explosion of flavors. I used Aurelia's sausage, a Spanish sausage manufactured in Boerne, Tx just a few miles northwest on IH-10. I prefer red potatoes so I substituted unpeeled red potatoes and loved the firmer texture. 3 family members have already requested this recipe and if you are not familiar with Spanish pimentón, this is your opportunity to fall in love!!!

I love this recipe. It is really yummy and it forgives you for altering it. I use hot chicken sausage from Trader Joes, and agree that it doesn't need to cook quite as long. I also disagree about the Russet potatoes. They don't hold up well. I love to make this soup during CSA season, eat half, and freeze the other half in 4 pound containers. It is even better after freezing, with the flavors more distributed. I've never done anything with the bread and always cut the oil way back as I'm always trying to move the scale downwards. :) Enjoy

It doesn't need to cook as long as the directions say. Also, I would put the greens in at the end so they are not all mushy. I used double the amount of chorizo. If I had only used 8 ounces, I would have reduced the broth.

I used chicken stock instead of broth, merguez instead of chorizo, added 3 cups dried cannellini beans that had been boiled for one hour and rinsed and added a tablespoon of cayenne pepper and cooked it all for two hours until the beans were tender. It is soooo yummy! After it sat for a while, the broth got really thick and even ore yummy.

Easy, very little prep time, super delicious! I used mostly sweet potatoes, which worked perfectly. They vanished into the soup, leaving it very thick, while the russets remained chunky. Like A Cook from Philadelphia (6/10), I used a crumbled PA Dutch raw chorizo (probably from the same farm!) because I only cook with Happy Meat and that was the only option. It went into the pot first. Everything else was per recipe. Was prepared to doctor but found it totally unnecessary.

Delicious, a complete soup and lots of flavor. I about 10oz chorizo, more than the recipe said, and I did add a bit of salt.

Rating: 1
An easy recipe, but needed a lot of doctoring up to make it taste like anything. I used salt and soy sauce to boost the flavor with extra amounts of broth to compensate for the overabundance of kale. Cayenne gave it a better kick.

Easy to make, but lots of doctoring required to make it taste good. I used chicken broth to boost the flavor, and still it required more salt (or soy sauce) than I normally like to add in.

I tried this soup as I was looking for a new good potato baseed soup, but was very disappointed in the results. Unfortunately for me, I made a big batch because I had planned on giving it to several people, and the reviewers raved about this recipe. I used only the 1 1/2 lb. kale - did not increase this - and found that there was an overwhelming amount for the large batch I made. The broth was so thin and tasteless, aside from the flavor of the chorizo which I happen to love. Maybe I should have pureed at least part of the potatoes or thicked the broth, but I will never know as I would not make this again. There are too many great potato soups to choose from to try to revamp this recipe.

So easy and so good. I used vegan chorizo and veggie broth, and it was a big hit with all my omnivore friends. Like another reviewer, I added the kale towards the end of the hour, but then it ended up simmering for another hour at my friend's house, and it was still a good texture.

Rating: 4
this is a great recipe! like some others, I substituted veggie sausage (spicy chipotle). I took the sausage out before adding the potatoes, so that I could partially puree the potato mixture. Then added sausage back in to simmer. I like my kale as close to raw as possible, so I added it in for the last 5 minutes, right before serving. It was very hearty and delicious!

I used lamb chorizo and baby kale, both from a local farm. The chorizo was so good I added more. A delicious soup.

I've made this soup several times a season for the past few years, and it has yet to disappoint. It's a perfect belly-warmer and -filler for cooler weather, but it's healthy and light at the same time. This can be made into a vegetarian meal by substituting veggie sausage and vegetable broth (though, as an omnivore, I think the meat version is better!)

This was a hit! I used spicy Italian sausage (chicken) instead of chorizo because that's what I had on hand. Swapped out the potatoes for cauliflower (to make it lower carb), used half chicken broth and half water. Really good stuff and will now be part of the regular rotation.

Rating: 4
I added a cup of wine (and cut back by as much on the chicken broth) and used some spicy fresh Italian sausage that I got at an Italian deli. Fantastic! My husband claimed it was better than any restaurant soup he's ever had. I'll make this again and again!

Another winner for the recipe book! We had so much kale last year that I made this a dozen times and it was perfect every time. I would definitely NOT leave out the smoked paprika as it is what makes this dish sing. No harm in adding a few more potatoes, but we left the kale proportions as they were, it really wilts and is not as much as you'd think. Cornbread offsets this perfectly, I made Chili-Cheese Cornbread and it was a perfect side.

I've made this twice now - the first time using unsmoked chorizo and the second, following the recipe, using smoked chorizo. It was incredibly delicious both times, but I have to say I prefer the unsmoked chorizo version. I got the unsmoked chorizo from a local farm that raises and sells pastured, organic, etc. meats. I was a little skeptical as it the farm and its butcher are very Pennsylvania Dutch, and I just wasn't sure if their "chorizo" would measure up. It was raw, and unsmoked, but the spices were really spot on. Because it wasn't smoked, I was able to strip it from its casings and crumble it. This made for a meatier and richer texture to the soup. With the smoked chorizo, I wasn't able to crumble it and had to chop it instead. Between that and the fact that it was smoked, I think made for a broth that wasn't as rich. So, long story short, I'd suggest trying unsmoked chorizo if possible (although it seems likely that few places outside of my Penna. Dutch supplier would think to carry such a thing). Also, I used a full pound of sausage, but kept the rest of the ingredient amounts the same.

I followed the directions but used regular paprika and I have to say that this soup is delicious and extremely simple to make. I never thought I'd be able to get my children (ages 8 and 5) to shovel kale in their mouths and ask for more but this soup does the trick.

What a great kitchen-sink soup! I didn't have any sausage, so I chopped up a slice of bacon. I doubled the smoked paprika and added several dollops of harissa to punch up the flavor. I added 4 garlic cloves to the onion, as well as some leftover carrot and celery. It was good hot off the stove, but even better the next day. I drizzled some whole milk yogurt over it... mmmm. Definitely making again with sausage or maybe some chipotles in adobo.

Grocery store didn't have chorizo so I used Andouille. Also had to use regular paprika. And used very hearty homemade multigrain bread for the croutons (with a dab of butter, I admit.) This soup was FANTASTIC! Tasted just like the Portugese kale soup we get in Provincetown MA. Don't skip the croutons!

Rating: 3
Tasty! I added a half-teaspoon of cumin and an additional half-teaspoon of the smoked paprika. Next time I might add a tinch more cumin. I thought 1.5 lbs of kale was fine, but I could see adding another potato. I made and ate it right away, so it didn't have time to mellow. It's brighter and warmer (I wouldn't say hotter) the next day, though - one of those soups that is perfectly good the first day but really better the next. My advice is to make it the day before you plan to eat it.

First, I made this with 3 strips of bacon instead of chorizo b/c I didn't have any on hand & softened the onion in the bacon fat. I also added a can of cannellini beans to bump up the protein and cayenne and cumin for the smokey-spicy flavor the sausage would have added. I pureed it a little too much, as I was missing the chunks of potato and the kale's texture. That said, it was bland the night I made it, but fantastic after some time in the fridge. I love dark greens and don't think this calls for too much kale. I will be making this all winter!

I definately should have read the reviews (suggestions) before I made this. It was very good, but I agree with changing the amounts of the ingredients used. Too much Kale in my opinion. I did add extra potato, and that helped out a bit. I think I also would have added some extra spices as suggested, such as chili powder, cumin, etc. as suggested. Anyways, good soup I plan to make it again with the alterations.

Very good! We pureed our vegetarian version of this recipe to about 75% smooth, leaving some kale and potatoes whole. We also threw in collards from our farm share, and some milk for creaminess. So we made a few alterations, but I think it's still a close relative to this recipe. We'll definitely make it again so we can try the chorizo version!

I used bacon and some cayenne pepper instead of chorizo, cooked the onions plus garlic in the bacon fat and used frozen kale. Yum.

I also belong to a CSA program and this week got kale and kohlrabi. Not knowing what to do with the kohlrabi, I threw that into the recipe as well. It was great!!!

This was an excellent soup. I used a Basque chorizo and substituted spinach for the kale, as that was what was in the refrig. My husband loved it. I will definitely make it again.

Made this using vegetarian ingredients (soyrizo & veg broth), and used regular paprika. Love this soup. Love the smell & sight of caldo verde in restaurants but can't bring myself to eat more than a sip of the meaty version. This is a perfect substitute! Hearty and great with a loaf of crusty bread on a cold winter afternoon.

This is the most well-known and traditional Portuguese soup. It is called Caldo Verde, and you can find many slightly varying recipes with a google search.

I took the advice of adding a half pound more potatoes and not as much kale as the recipe called for. I added a couple of garlic cloves and included cumin. I also used a spicy Hungarian paprika in lieu of the regular paprika. This was a delicious and simple meal. I will definetly be making this again soon.

This soup is exceptionally good. I have had kale raw before and it can be quite bitter so I was expecting a more bitter flavor but in fact the flavor was far more sweet than I had anticipated. This soup is nothing short of wonderful, truly a sweet surprise. I used Basque chorizo instead of Spanish because I like the texture better so it wasn't as spicy as it might have been. I also went very easy on it as I wanted it to be a more vegetarian soup than meat based and it was good choice. Excellent soup, I will definitely make it again and again!!

Wow, this as delicious as it was simple to make. I added a couple of garlic cloves with the onions and substituted soy chorizo from Trader Joes...you would never know! I will definitely be making this again and again over the winter, but I think I'll increase the potatoes from 1 1/2 lbs. to 2 lbs next time as it seemed a little sparse on the potatoes.

I've made this several times now - it's delicious, filling, rich, and makes a ton! My boyfriend requests it every week. I've made it with turkey sausage instead of chorizo and red potatoes instead of russet. Delicious!

We belong to a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) so we get alot of kale. At this time of year we also get locally grown organic potatoes and onions so this was the perfect recipe for us.The kale retained it's texture whereas spinach breaks down and becomes mushy. Additionally, the kale added a tanginess that was pleasant. The overall flavor combination with the spicy spanish chorizo, the smokey papkria and the tangy kale was very interesting and flavorful. Next time I would increase the onions.

I won't comment on the flavor because I made too many substitutions (tasted great anyway!), but I can't imagine putting in the full 1 1/2 lbs of kale. That would be like eating kale soup with a bit of potato and sausage. I used 1/2 lb and the balance was just right for a potato soup with kale and chorizo.

I'm trying to learn to cook with greens so I tried this soup. It was absolutely delicious--smoky and spicy.
