Okay but not special.

I made this as a last minute cheese sauce for steamed broccoli and cauliflower and it turned out great for what it was. I substituted the beer for white wine and it was perfectly fine. Don't make this as-is expecting gourmet, but it was pretty good. Will make this one again.

I thought this recipe was fabulous. I added an extra teaspoon to the recipe and a whole clove of garlic. I used 1/2 of a cup dark ale and 1/2 of a cup pilsner. And a It came out absolutely wonderful for me. Not runny like other people were getting, but then I feel that if you see that your sauce is too runny, why didn't you add more corn starch. seems like common sense to me. Se la vie....

I gave this three forks only because we were a little divided in my household. I found the sauce delicious if not a bit bitter because of the beer. It reminded me of something I would have eaten in Germany or in a fondue restaurant. My fiance thought it was so terrible that he made a horrifying face, spit it out and chugged water. It was quite easy to make, however. The flavor is not what you would expect but I thought it was quite good.

To: jdaf from baltimore. I never meant to review this recipe 3 times, but the Epi. site wouldn't show that my review had been received. So, I kept sending it, and finally gave up, never knowing that any of the reviews had been recorded by Epi. Then the next day I couldn't believe that all THREE were on-line. I still say, though, that this is a VERY good cheese sauce, since I WILL NOT use Cheez Whiz!!!

I have to say that I love cheese and I really didn't care for this sauce.It was very runny and I had my kids try it before it ruined dinner. I don't think I would make this again and it got such a high mark due to one person putting 3 of the same review in with 4 forks

This was EXCELLENT! Had no problems with separation. On Father's Day I made 1/2 of the recipe for on top of steamed broccoli. Had hoped to have 1/2 leftover for another time, but Hubby and I ate it all (perhaps I thickened it too much with 1-1/4 tsp. cornstarch--it didn't seem like it turned out to be 5/8 cup). Didn't have real beer, so I used O'Doul's. Also, used 1/2 Kraft extra sharp cheddar (that I grated myself) and 1/2 Great Value shredded Fiesta Blend. This was really YUMMY, and I will make it often.

Didn't have cornstarch on hand, so substituted flour. Used horseradish mustard and a seasonal pumpkin ale. Tasted great, but the sauce seperated as soon as it was removed from the heat.

I substituted white wine for beer and used a white cheddar and romano pecorino. I wanted a milkier consistency so I also added whole milk and whole yogurt. I used dijon mustard. It's a good basic recipe that I used for macaroni and cheese. If it's not thick enough, just add more corn starch.

Tastes more like a welsh-rarebit than anything....I was hoping for a thick sauce, but it was quite runny...even though I followed the recipe exactly!
