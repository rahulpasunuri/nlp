these are the best chocolate cookies Ive ever eaten. They are something between a cookie and a mini chocolate brownie. AMAZING!

LIked the almond paste in the cookies, but would make something else next time. Dorie Greenspan has a recipe in her "Paris Sweets" cookbook that is outstanding called "Korova Cookies" that you should track down if you want another take on chocolate cookies. Korova cookies have become my alltime fav.

I made these cookies for several years at Christmas and got rave reviews. During a move 2 years ago, I lost the recipe. I am thrilled to find it here at Epicurious after a short search. Thank you!

This recipe has become a standard in my kitchen since I found it in Gourmet. A nice, nutty tasting cookie.
