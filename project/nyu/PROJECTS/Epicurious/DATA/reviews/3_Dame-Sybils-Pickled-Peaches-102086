This is a very old method of preserving peaches, and one my grandmother, mother, and all my aunts used to use. The only thing I would change is the weights because not everyone has a kitchen scale. I'd prefer to know approximately how many medium-size peaches equal 12 lbs. I would also like to know how much ground cinnamon I could use instead of one cinnamon stick. After I got it figured out, it worked well. I like the use of vinegar instead of so much suger -- i.e., 12 lbs peaches to 12 lbs sugar, as in most jams and preserves.

I've got an easier one that is just as good. Drain a 29oz. can of peaches (light syrup). Add 3/4c.brown sugar,1/2c.cider vinegar,2 (3")cinnamon sticks,1tsp.cloves,1tsp.whole allspice to syrup. Boil that for 5 mins. Add peaches. Cook another 5 mins. Store in glass canning jar at least overnight or for up to 3 days. Pass it off as Dame Sybil's. Wonderful with pork.

THIS IS A VERY TRADITIONAL AND EASY TO MAKE RECIPE. I WILL BE GIVING THIS AWAY FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS. THE FLAVOR IS UNCOMPLICATED, SPICY AND HAS A WELL BALANCED FLAVOR.
