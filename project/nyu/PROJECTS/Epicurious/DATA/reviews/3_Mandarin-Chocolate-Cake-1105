I think the key to texture of the cake is to use the same technique as Julia Child's Reine de Saba cake, and separate the eggs. Beat the whites with a little sugar until stiff but dry. Then fold the whites into the batter in three stages, alternating with adding one third of the flour each time. This helps ensure that the cake doesn't go flat like a brownie.

I don't bake often. But I needed something for my chocoholic wife's birthday. The net: She talks about this more than the jewelry, which needless to say, was not even the same ballpark on cost.

I think whoever wrote this recipe down forgot to add the leavening to the list of ingredients. I followed the directions to a T and got not a springy cake, but solid brownies. They taste okay, but it isn't really cake.

This is my favorite decadent chocolate cake recipe, although I have altered it a little. I leave out the ground ginger, the almonds, and the crystallized ginger. It's wonderful made this way! Really.

Not a very impressive turnout. I would not recommend this to anyone else, unless they want to play around with the recipe to try and perfect it.
