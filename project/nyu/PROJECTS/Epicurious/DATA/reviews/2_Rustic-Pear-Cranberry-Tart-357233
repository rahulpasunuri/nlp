easy recipe. 425 or 22 minutes is a bit much, I baked for 22 minutes without watching the oven and burned the crust. will try again at lower temperature.

Made this for a Sunday night book club meeting. This recipe is tasty, fast and easy. Caution, it's only big enough for 6 servings, at most. The crust at the folded-over corners gets a bit thick and difficult to cut. If I had to make it again I would eliminate some of that dough.
