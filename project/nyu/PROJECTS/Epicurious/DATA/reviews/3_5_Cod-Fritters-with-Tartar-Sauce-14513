These were terrific! I made 4 large fish patties, using Panko for both the 'fresh' breadcrumbs and for the coating. The tarragon in the sauce was especially good.

This recipe reminds me of a poor man's crab cakes. It's delicious.

We enjoyed this change of pace cod recipe. We omitted the scallions and added parsely for color. We did not deep fry but used the oven "frying" method so there was no need for the cracker crumb coating. They came out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. And the bonus is they are lower in fat content than regular frying! Delicious with oven-fried french fries.

This recipe is a keeper. My family loved it. It's really good for a appetizer. I added cayenne pepper for a kick. And I need more breadcrumbs to make it thicker to roll in the salteen crackers. Other than that it was worth making.

I have made this recipe several times and it has always been a real winner. Great if served as an appetizer.
