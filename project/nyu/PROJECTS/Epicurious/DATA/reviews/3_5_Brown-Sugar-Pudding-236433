nice constancy, but a bit too sweet for my taste. not a whole lot of complexity.

This is a delicious sweet pudding, but I did make some alterations. I used Splenda Brown Sugar instead of regular brown sugar and Xanthum Gum instead of cornstarch (this makes it a little healthier and good for people who have celiac or hyperinsulinemia). I also omitted the butter. This was a hit with my family and I would make it again.

Smooth and creamy! I should have cut down on the sugar just a tiny bit as another reviewer suggested. I also substituted 2/3 Lactaid ;) + 1/3 heavy cream for the half & half. The tartness of the whipped topping complements the sweetness of the pudding nicely.

I cut the sugar almost by half and used whole milk instead of half and half. I also mixed in 2% Greek Yogurt. Really Oustanding and guilt-free.

This was very tasty, but I found that the texture of the pudding was actually a little grainy. The cream topping was tasty as well, the tang a nice counterpart to the sweet pudding. I halved the recipe (6 servings) and found it was enough for 2, not 3 people.
