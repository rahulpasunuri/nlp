These are NOT Sticky buns. With that glaze they would be cinnamon buns. I won't even bother making them.

Hmmm...looks a little cheesy for my personal taste in sticky buns... :)

i haven't made this recipe, but am i the only one that thinks the picture looks like lasagna? i think the ultimate sticky bun recipe looks better anyhow.

I agree with the other reviewers. These sticky buns come out dry. Next time I'll make the Ultimate Sticky Buns recipe (which i would've done in the first place, except I was missing some ingredients), which received great reviews, or make some major adjustments to this recipe. What you need to do is USE LESS FLOUR. I only used 4 3/4 cups of flour and it was still too much flour and a little dry. Add the flour in by 1/2 cups and go slowly. Also, the recipe is very stingy with the filling and topping. Double the sugar, cinnamon, butter mixture and the rolls will be much more gooey and flavorful. Also double the topping since the recipe as is barely covers the rolls. If you're a cinnabon fan like I am you'll want plenty of frosting to dip in. Well, my husband loved the rolls anyway, and I have to admit they were tasty (I substituted two cups pecans for the walnuts), but next time I'll either make some huge adjustments, or just try my luck with the much-forked Ultimate Sticky Rolls.

I thought these came out just a little dry, but the folks I made it for were universal in their praise (even when I wasn't in the room) so I think I'm the only one out of a dozen who found fault. It's certainly a very easy, no fuss recipe.

I'm not sure what happened. These were really dry, tasteless and uninspiring.

Yummy, these were not as light and fluffy as I expected but were really good.

These buns were delicious. I prepared the dough in my bread machine - didn't even bother with the warm milk sugar and yeast prep, since my machine has a preheat stage before it starts mixing and kneading. The dough turned out great, smooth and elastic. After that all I had to do is let it rise for 2 hours and shape the buns. I had shaped about 20 buns, 12 just seemed too huge.

Just perfect. The orange juice in the glaze is a nice touch. Pehaps I would cut the raisins by about a third, and double the walnuts, or perhaps substitute pecans. But they are wonderful as they are.

4 hours definitely means 4 hours so allow yourself plenty of time. worth the wait though. my husband and I wrestled for the last one! delicious.
