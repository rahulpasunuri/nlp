Good, not great. I thought the almond extract was a bit overpowering - I'd put a bit less in next time. Used Grand Marnier instead of wine - but think I'd try something with a bit more bite next time as well, wine or balsamic vinegar perhaps.

This recipe won the best dessert award at a pot luck dinner I attended. Everybody loved it. I had to cook it a little longer than the recipe said to because it was still mushy in the middle but oh so delicious!!

This cobbler wasn't comfort food - it wasn't sweet enough, and the taste of the orange zest overwhelmed the taste of pears and blackberries. Except for the outer edges, the crust was very mushy.

Not comfort food cobbler; instead, it has a more sophisticated taste, which is not what I was looking for. The orange zest overwhelms the taste of pears and blackberries. The crust around the edge becomes cake-like, but in the center remains mushy. Will not make again - will look for a different cobbler recipe, which tastes sweeter and more traditional.

Not comfort food cobbler. Has a more sophisticated taste, which is not what I was looking for. The orange zest somewhat overwhelms the taste of pears and blackberries. The crust at edges of dish is cakelike, but in the center remains mushy. Would not make again - will try a different cobbler recipe.

I substituted cherries and raspberries, and it was delicious. Instead of wine I used a splash of Grand Marnier. Excellent depth of flavor and easy too.

I love this cobbler! It's easy and delicious. I am making it today for the third time. My one adjustment is that I peeled the pears this time. I've noticed the first two times I made it the peel would get a little tough. Highly recommend.

Awesome - it was a hit at a recent dinner party. It will definitely serve more than 6 - probably serve at least 10.

My husband and I were arguing about what cobbler to make for our very first Thanksgiving - peach or blueberry. Since we couldn't come to a mutual agreement, I decided to try this one and OH MY GOSH! This recipe is awesome and I will definitely make this a staple for our holidays! One thing I did to make it a bit healthier was substitute the melted butter with applesauce. The added flavor of apple you get in the batter is fantastic.

I didn't have any red wine in the house, so I used orange juice. I am also cooking for two, so I cut the recipe in half. This is a delicious and simple cobbler. The topping is cakey and sweet, and the pears become soft and juicy as the dish bakes. I do think it requires ripe flavorful pears. I will make this recipe again for sure. Yum, yum, yum.

4 Forks for this because it is easy to make, and delicious. Next time I will cut a bit of the sugar out, and use maybe a little less almond extract. I split the recipe and made 2 cobblers in 8 x 8 x 2 pans, worked fine.

Loved this Dish! I have made it several times. The play of flavors between the red wine and fruit was superb. Loved the touch of almond in the pastry. I never had any problem with the middle being gooey, it turned out lovely with the dough rising up to perfectly envelope the fruit.

I too don't understand some of the other reviews. This cobbler is amazing. The only thing I changed was substituting ollalieberries for blackberries which added tartness. The end result is delicious and can be eaten for virtually any meal rather than as dessert.

The cook from "Chapel Thrill" basically said it all, but I will add that this is my second time making this, and I use the 3" pyrex dish and cook it on 35O for 45 min, then switched down to 325 for another 25 minutes or so. Turns out perfectly. I also substituted whole wheat flour for white and balsamic vinegar for wine, as well as putting all berries and no pears this time: both times, it turned out excellent. I just keep forgetting to halve the sugar - it is just a bit too sweet! Still, delicious!

Divine! I use 16oz frozen berry mix avail here which incl. 5 types of nordic berries. I use salted butter as it is cheaper than unsalted. Sometimes I use pears, sometimes apples from our tree. Both work well. We enjoy this often through the long, dark Nordic autumns & winters.

I almost didn't make this given some of the previous reviews. And I do understand what they mean - this isn't a classic cobbler, and it isn't for everyone. But it manages to be both elegant and homey. My toddler and my husband both loved it, and it was very easy to make. The citrus peel and almond extract definitely make this more special. But it is definitely not what most people think of as cobbler.

Made with blueberries instead of blackberries because that is what I had on hand. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I agree with the other reviews stating this was not anything special. Don't bother. Too many other great cobbler recipes.

Pretty good, although there are better cobbler recipes out there.

I followed this recipe except for throwing in a little extra fruit. This was my first cobbler attempt and I could not have been happier with the result. I used a deep metal pan (it was the only thing I had with 2" sides) and it worked fine.

Nothing special.

The first time I made this I used a 2 1/2 qt. round pyrex dish and baked it for one hour and the center turned out wet. The second time I used a 10 1/4 x 8 1/2 x 2 1/4 Corning Ware pan and baked it for 65 minutes and it turned wonderfully.

I also could not locate a 2 1/2 qt dish 2" deep. Used a 3qt deeper dish. Great flavor but it was runny in the middle. I still prefer the biscuit type cobbler.

substituted balsamic vinegar for the red wine and reduced the amount of sugar-- fabulous and very easy!

I used apples from our tree (a sweet/tart variety) and a mix of frozen blackberries, currants, raspberries and blueberries avail locally. Delish!

This cobbler is so tasty and easy. It is also forgiving if you change up the fruit or even use individual souffle dishes.

A friend made this for dessert recently and it was really delicious. I am really looking forward to making it myself.

I did not have a 2 1/2 qt pot so I used a 3 qt one. This was very good though slightly hard, but it's probably because of the pot. Nice, quick and easy dessert

This was a great fall dessert. Very easy to make and absolutely delcious served warm with vanilla ice cream on a chilly fall evening. The red wine, tangerine zest and cinnamon add personality to this dish. I might try changing the fruit next time to include peaches instead of the blackberries. Really good!

This was really tasty and easy. The only issue that I have is the pan size - a 2.5qt with 2 inch sides? Did they mean something like a 2.5 qt glass roaster? Like the Corningware French one? The dish will look like the picture - you just have bake it long enough.
