Great tip to substitute tilapia for sea bass -- delicious, and at a quarter of the price.

The tapenade was delicious; I threw a handful of sweet grape tomatoes into the food processor at the end to lighten up the taste and give more texture to the tapenade-awesome! used sea bream from the local farmers market-would stick with bass. the bream was good, but a heartier fish like bass would stand up to this bold sauce better. served with cous cous, cooked with 1/2 reserved water from the sun-dried tomatos, 1/2 water mix. yum.

My husband and I have this at least once a week. I freeze it in serving sizes, and then just defrost and add to filets. The tapenade is good cold, room temp, or hot. Also great on tilapia.

My husband loves olives and seafood, so he absolutely loved this recipe "the combination of the ingredients in the tapenade was phenomenal" (4 forks from him). I wasn't as crazy about it, given that I'm not crazy about olives, but it was a good flavor with the sea bass (2 forks from me). I did add about 1 tbsp. of pine nuts to the tapenade, which mellowed the salty olive bite and served it with rice spaghetti. I will make this dish again.

This is a high 3 forker. Thanks to other reviewers, I sauted the fish instead of following the directions - good call. I found that I didn't have any parsley, so just left it out, and used sundried tomatoes in oil so skipped the first step, and it still turned out wonderfully. A very very tasty tapenade that goes well very well with fish (and I'm sure would be delicious on toast, etc.).

The fish would have been better if sauteed instead of broiled. But, it still came out pretty good. The tepanade, on the other hand, was absolutely amazing. It was colorful, and smelled so good. I used green olives, and served with basil zucchini, a recipe also found in here. I will definately use the tepanade on bruschetta..

Easy and delicious. I made one substitution though; red wine instead of red wine vinegar (too lazy to run back to store). Tapenade was even better the next day. Piropan Soave accompanied this dish very nicly.

I took the advice of a reviewer below and used the tapenade on bruschetta topped with brie. Excellent! Thanks for the tip.

Delicious, easy and quick! The tapenade is excellent and really makes the dish. I served the fish with slices of broiled polenta and eggplant, both of which were also complemented by the tapenade.

A keeper! I used julienned sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil and omitted olive oil from recipe to save time. I served over cous cous, finished with fresh basil leaves and few extra olives.

Tapenade was very good... gave the dish a Mediterranian flavor. Fish would have been better if sauted.

This is a great recipe - a perfect compliment with the sea bass. I used the remaining tapenade with bruschetta, but I would imagine it would be great over pasta. Defintely would try this again. Thanks, Epicurious!

I loved this recipe because I was able to make innovative use of ingredients I already had on hand. The tapenade is what made this recipe so killer delicious. But garlic lovers beware! The raw garlic can be overpowering if you increase the quantity. I doubled the garlic and found that just two cloves were too much. (The flavors had mellowed by the next day, however.) Next time I'll use roasted garlic instead of fresh. I made guacamole over Christmas with roasted garlic and it was fantastic!

For all the work and ingredients that went into this, I thought the sauce was very bland.

I loved this recipe, AND I also use the Tapenade for Bruschetta occasionally. It's a terrific, flavor-packed paste. Very nice on the mild seabass, or spread on toasted baguette slices and baked for a few minutes topped with a this slice of Brie. Yum Yum!

This recipe was an excellent recipe. This tapenade was a really perfect match for the fish and we used the left over tapenade for chicken and bread. The tapenade had a strong garlic taste so beware. Excellent recipe, thanks epicurious!

This tapenade is great and it's even great with the sea bass...but there are so many superior ways to prepare sea bass! I will definitely make the tapenade again, but use it for bruschetta.

I made this dish for a friend for her birthday and she kept asking "What restaurant am I at???" That's the kind of feedback I love! DEFINITELY serve the tapenade at room temperature (the recipe doesn't specify)and make sure you've got plenty left over to use as a spread at another meal. As a matter of conservation - Chilean Sea Bass is now endangered so I used a delicious alternative - escolar - and it was terrific.

This is a wonderful meal to serve when having a dinner party. I made everything ahead of time and all I had to do was cook the fish and enjoy the party. Very simple to make.

Absolutely loved it! Have made it three times and it gets better each time. As with most seafood dishes, fresh is best.
