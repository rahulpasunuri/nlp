Pretty darn blah. Healthy, good use of CSA vegetables that are always abundant, but pretty darn underwhelming.

I liked this dish for its rich flavor and simple, well-spiced ingredients. As directed, it might not have been a success, but I added some veggie bullion paste and pureed about a third of the stew to thicken it some. Would make again, a good winter stew option for those who like to eat seasonally.

This wasn't impressive. I ended up adding a can of whole tomatoes and some extra spices because there wasn't much flavor. It ended up being a decent soup, but not something I'll make again.

Didn't make it yet, but just wanted to mention that I found harissa at Cost Plus World Market, so if you have one by you, check out the spices section.

I didn't find this stew to be very good at all. I followed the directions closely and had to do a lot of tweaking toward the end to get some kind of flavor. I might recommend cooking in a vegetable/chicken broth instead of water, and sauteing the carrots/turnips for more flavor.

Excellent stew... much better than I thought it would be. I had to make the yogurt sauce with sambal oelek instead of harissa (couldn't find harissa anywhere in town). The sauce tastes great as a sandwich spread or dip also!

This was a very good vegetarian stew, but I too thought it was missing something, and wasn't fantastic. The yogurt sauce indeed makes the dish and it just wouldn't be too nice without it. And for sure, don't forget the fresh lemon juice at the end.

Really flavorful and savory -- we will definitely make this again! I agree -- the yogurt sauce is essential. I could not get Harissa sauce easily, but I substituted a Thai chile pepper paste and it was delicious. (The yogurt/Thai paste mix would make a great base for lots of dishes.) It is a light meal, but not watery once you add the yogurt. Great with some crusty bread as a one-dish meal, but could also be a side dish for grilled fish or chicken. Kids even liked it, minus the yogurt sauce.

this is very tasty, but we thought it was missing something. it was a little too watery and not filling enough for a main. we have been adding a cup of cooked whole wheat cous cous at the end which makes it more substantial and less water.

Wonderful blend of taste and texture...great stew for a healthy meal and great way to get in those veggies!

I made this as part of my Snowpocalypse 2010 menu while holed up in DC area suburbs for the Feb storm and blizzard. It was fantastic the day I made it and even better two days later. I used a mix of labne kefir cheese with some plain yogurt since I was out of greek yogurt, and vermouth for the white wine. It's easy to reduce the liquid too much - go easy on the flour and watch the levels as it cooks down! Thanks to other reviewers who suggested the Harissa sauce that was part of the Cinnamon Roasted Chicken recipe on this site - it's fantastic! The stew without the sauce is indeed bland - may add leftover harissa sauce directly to stew next time as another reviewer did. So glad I made this!

I completely agree with the bad reviews. I followed the recipe and it tasted very bland. I had to add a lot of tomato paste and tomato sauce to save the soup; otherwise it would be tasted like boiled vegetables.

I love this unusual dish. The mint and cumin and spring onions was wonderful.

this was really good + so easy, definitely needs more spices + liquid + a little extra wine + parsley. the yogurt sauce is totally vital. i'll definitely make it again, or something like it using the basic idea. cooking the vegetables ahead of time + then sauteeing the garlic with the spices + green onion + then reducing the wine was really nice. good to control the amount of liquid you want and have some left to do something else with later on.

Fantastic - the yogurt sauce is key, and the stew itself tasted bland without it. Substituted sambal oelek for the harissa, and also added parsnips.

Absolutely delicious. I substitued Sriracha chili paste instead of Harissa and chili powder for the paprika. I didn't oversalt the stew and instead oversalted the yogurt sauce so I could control the salinity of the dish (also made the harissa yogurt a bit tangier). To make this dish more flavorful, I used a bit less broth and simmered for a few extra hours (kept overnight would be even better).

I made this a bit differently. I used homemade chicken stock instead of water and I added chicken. I did follow the other directions until the end. It tasted a bit bland to me. I made the Harissa sauce from scratch following the epicurious recipe to accompanies the cinnamon roasted chicken. It tasted so good I couldn't resist adding it directly to the soup (minus the yogurt). I used the entire amount of harissa from the recipe. That did it! It tastes great now!!!

I don't know how I could diverge so much with the other reviewers, but here goes. I quadroupled the spices, added half a can of diced tomatoes and a lot more broth and had to cook it much longer than stated to get the veggies cooked through. Even then it was marginal at best.

Delicious! You can substitute just about any vegetables (I used parsnips instead of turnips and threw in a red pepper and some peas).

Delicious and just enough out of the ordinary to be fun and interesting! I'm no vegetarian, but I found this to be very satisfying. My wife gobbled up the leftovers for lunch the next day, leaving none for me :(

Very good, health, and easy to make. Increased spicing a bit. Definitely a "keeper."
