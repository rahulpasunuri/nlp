i made the cake as per instsructions and when i checked on the cake it was liquid. cooked it an extra 20 min which was too long and this cause some of the chestnuts to be hard as rocks. the cake i found dense. others said that they liked it but it wasn't worth the effort.

i used 7 oz of vacuum packed chestnuts, which turned out just fine. i cut the brown sugar to 1/2c and i think i'll try 1/4c next time- it's still really sweet. i did not ice it. it's lovely dunked in hot tea. it was best, of course, straight from the oven, but it kept well and i did not notice a taste difference the next day.

Great little cake, especially with tea. I made a butterscotch sauce for drizzling over the top. I had to cook it for an additional 15 min. as well, but it was still moist.

Delicious cake enjoyed by all at my house. Love the flavor and texture from the chestnuts! Had to bake about 15 mins extra for middle to set...not sure why, as I made no alterations. Didn't make the icing, but may next time when a more rich dessert is called for.

Excellent! Not too sweet, but very rich tasting. I used the food processor to chop the chestnuts into coarse meal, and was very happy with the texture that gave the cake.

This delicious cake tastes as good as it smells -- full of buttery maple syrup and yummy chestnuts. However, peeling the chestnuts is a chore and the cake is not half as good the second day because the chestnuts lose their flavor and the texture becomes dense and heavy.

This got rave reviews at a New Year's Eve gathering. I made it as directed, with one exception: I substituted baking soda for the baking powder. This balanced the sweetness of the cake without affecting the leavening at all. Still, it's very sweet and a little goes a long way!

I had a jar of leftover chestnuts, so to use them up I decided to make this cake. Mmm... am I ever glad I did! This cake is really easy to make and wonderfully delicious. A very moist cake, and the chestnuts and maple icing have a very nice flavor. The hardest part was waiting for the cake to cool so that I could ice it!

This cake had a wonderful flavor. I brought it to a party and everyone loved it. I did double the recipe and baked it in an oblong pan. To be sure it was done, I increased the baking time, and, as a result, the bottom burned. People loved the cake anyway, so that tells you the flavor was good. I thought the maple flavor in icing complemented the cake well, but that the icing was almost too buttery. I might think about a maple icing that is a little less rich next time.
