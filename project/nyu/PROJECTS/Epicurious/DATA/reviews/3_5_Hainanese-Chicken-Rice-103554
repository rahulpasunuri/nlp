I love the simplicity of boiling/soaking chicken in the broth (water). I made it several times my husband loves it. Also made a ginger, spring onion oil condiment and use store bought dark sweet soy sauce with the dish. As for rice, I'd fry the rice for a minute when it's raw with ginger slices and shallots to add more flavor. Leave ginger pieces to cook with rice and fish them out later. If there's chicken fat trimmings, you can also render the fat to fry the rice as I mentioned. Not sure if the watercress, cucumber add anything to the dish. I don't remember these two side dishes when we ate the dish in Asia. Anyhow I think pickled cucumbers would add a nice contrast. Enjoy!

The first time I made this dish it blew me away. So good. But the only caution I will give is that I thought the recipe was a tremendous amount of work- definitely not a week-night meal. Take the time to do all your vegetable chopping first and I think the meal prep will be more enjoyable.

This was a really good recipe. I grew up eating this whenever I visited singapore every few years growing up. The changes I made included: 1. boiling the chicken a bit longer around 40 minutes (but this could also be due to my burner),2. adding pandan leaves to both the broth while boiling and to the rice when cooking in the rice cooker. I always get pandan leaves from the Asian market when I'm there and freeze it since I don't use it often. The fragrant smell is amazing and is more "authentic" to me. 3. I made the chile sauce but it was way too hot with 6 chiles for my taste buds so I do advise tasting as you go along before adding all the chiles to make sure it agrees with you. 4. After I cut up the chicken I poured a soy sauce/sesame mixture over it. 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1 to 2 tbs of sesame oil, heat up for 40 seconds then pour over the chicken before eating. My rice wasn't as good alone as it tastes in the stalls in s'pore. Maybe I needed to add more fat? But overall it was good when combined with the chicken and chilies. Enjoy this yummy recipe.

This recipe is fantastic. We used goose stock to make the broth. The chicken was cooked just right, the taste subtle and clean. The rice was rich and sinful. The chili sauce hot and fresh.

My dad used to make this dish for us when we still lived at home. This is Singapore's national dish! I was craving for this and decided to try and make it myself at home. I made this yesterday and it was soooo good! Tastes really homemade and authentic. The sauce really makes the dish...sour and spicy! The chicken was just right, not over done and not under done. The recipe is actually very simple to follow so don't be intimidated by the amount of steps. You won't regret it!

Having never traveled to China or anywhere near there, I can not comment on the authenticity of this dish. I can, however, comment on the fact that it does taste amazing. If I had to "imagine" what authentic Malaysian cuisine tastes like, this would be it. I could not find Thai peppers or even Serrano peppers, so I used Jals...I know, I know, but it was all two grocery stores here had. I removed half of the seeds as most in the house do not like extreme heat, and we raved about the dish. I want to make it one more time as I love Thai chilies. Also, the rice is now my favorite way to make rice. I have found a whole new use for chicken fat...besides the trash can.

I bought chicken breasts with skin and trimmed the fat and cut up the skin; which I rendered in sesame oil. (I saved the skin and crispy fatty bits for the dog.) Then I removed the excess oil and cooked the rice following the recipe. I simmered the chicken in chicken broth instead of water (left out the salt). When the chicken breasts cooled, I sliced it up about half an inch thick. Then I stir fried some thinly sliced ginger, finely chopped garlic and shallots in the sesame oil I saved, and added the chicken; sprinkled some light soy sauce over the chicken and served.

I think that this recipe is very, very good, just like in Singapore. It has been a mainstay in our house. Kudos to Gourmet!

This recipe (along with the coconut tapioca recipe that goes with it) is a huge favourite at our house. My husband was very excited to be able to recreate one of his favourite memories of a Bangkok holiday. We've taken to using this for dinner parties when someone is off to Asia for a trip. Best of all for a dish that impresses so much it is extremely easy.

This recipe is a good, authentic version of the chicken rice that is ubiquitous in Chinese stalls in Malaysia. To the cook from Columbus--in Malay cooking (e.g. Nasi Lemak), the distinctive flavor is belacan, which is fermented shrimp paste. It has similar flavors to fish sauce, but is also different, and used differently--many Malay recipes start with heating oil in a pan, then frying belacan briefly, then adding other ingredients. The frying belacan is strong and harsh, but don't fear for your recipe!

I've been looking for a good recipe for this. This one is pretty good. Only one change is needed. Whenever you are cooking chicken broth for a Chinese recipe, add one or two star anise.

When I was in Singapore and Malaysia I noticed that everything has a similar and VERY distinctive flavor. What is it? It sort of tastes like fish sauce? But not quite. Curry leaves? It certainly didn't taste like anything I had in China. Any insights?

Made this for company this week and everyone loved it. I did not make the soup, and instead of a whole chicken, I cooked in seperate pots chicken breasts and legs, to avoid overcooking the light meat. I then removed the skin and bones and 'shredded' the chicken into large serving pieces. Right before serving I put the chicken into a pot with some stock and heated it up. The rice is fantastic and the sauce, hot and pulls the dish together.

Have lived in Singapore as a child I'm always on the lookout for authentic good Hainan Chicken Rice. This comes close, but is not quite there. Next time I will try the Brooklyn cook's suggestion of using pork and add more salt. The chicken turned out pretty bland even though I used 2 tsp. of salt. The chili sauce made up for it. It was also a bit of a challenge to get the thicker parts of the chicken cooked without overcooking. I might make cuts in those areas beforehand next time.

When I was little, we used to stay at the Mandarin Hotel in Singapore and would always get the chicken rice. It was one of my favorite dishes. Although it doesn't compare with the chicken rice at the Mandarin, this recipe is the best I have found so far-- especially with the crushed green onions and garlic as the cook from Brooklyn suggested. I didn't drizzle the soy sauce mixture over it but served the chicken with three sauces for dipping : soy sauce(not Japanese but south east asian) + sesame oil; grated ginger + salt + sesame oil; the chile sauce from this recipe. My family loved it!

I have made this dish many, many times. We all love it. The chicken is so tender. I also use this method of cooking chicken (omiting the ginger and adding an onion) when cooking chicken to mix with mexican mole or pipian sauce. The chicken is tender not stringy and oh-so delicious. This is a winner at my home...

I've had this at Penang restaurants in Boston and NY. It is labor intensive but none of the steps are particularly complicated. I doubled the rice recipe to 4 cups, and found that I can easily get 4-5 tablespoons of chicken fat to go with it (although I had less broth remaining for soup since I used double for the rice). I also used 4 teaspoons of salt in the broth, as the other reviewer noted. The rice turned out fine, although I suspect restaurants probably add even more chicken fat or artifical flavor.

As a Hainanase Malaysian, this recipe is close to my mom's but there are some missing steps. To make the soup tastier, you would need to put in about 1 lb of lean pork into the soup when cooking the chicken. Also, we don't cook chicken in the soup for so long, we have to lift the chicken from the hot soup multiple times so that the cold soup inside the cavity drains out.

I love Hainan Chicken Rice, but it is so hard to find in restaurants. So many places just serve Hong Kong style sliced cold chicken on top of slightly salted rice. This recipe is pretty good, but the rice still wasn't quite the same. The chicken turned out very tender. Following a different recipe I found, I added four crushed green onions and two crushed garlic cloves to the cavity of the chicken and that added a lot of flavor to the broth. I didn't find the rice or the broth salty enough, but that was easily remedied.

Not being familiar, although I heard much about "chicken rice" when we were in Malaysia. I thought to try making this recipe. It was deliscious. The chicken, soup and the chile sauce is a must. My daughter in law and I ate it one night and the left overs for lunch the next day. (husbands were out of town)
