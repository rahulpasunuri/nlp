This was a very very yummy dish. There are a few things that I learned though...first you can purchase the crepes pre-made now in the stores and that is an easier way to go if you don't have a lot of time. Second I learned that you either have to assemble the day of or do as the previous review said and prepare the night before and freeze them. If you just leave them in the frig then the crepes get very soggy and it becomes extremely difficult to cook them in the morning, they end up in pieces...which of course still tastes just as good but the presentation suffers greatly. Third, you can leave the cheese filling in a bowl in the frig overnight and just prepare the crepe right before you cook them in oil, if you do this make sure you pull out the filling about 1/2 hr. ahead of time to let it come to room temp. it will make it easier to put in the crepes. Also, you can prepare the compote the night before and just place in the frig. The berries will do their thing and melt throughout the night. The next morning you need to just pull them out about 1/2 hr. before you cook everything. I prepared everything the night before which only took me about 1/2hr. the next morning it only took about another 1/2 hr. to have a wonderful and unique breakfast.

Definitely a yummy breakfast recipe. I find that the blintzes are sometimes a bit difficult to control if I try to cook them right after assembly, so its actually easier if you make them the night before, freeze them, then cook them from frozen. Also, if you dont have the energy to make the fruit compote, pie filling would do fine. I usually use blueberry, drain out some of the extra juice, add a little sugar, and let it simmer down and get a bit thicker before pouring it over the blintzes. Very yummy, and always lots of complements!
