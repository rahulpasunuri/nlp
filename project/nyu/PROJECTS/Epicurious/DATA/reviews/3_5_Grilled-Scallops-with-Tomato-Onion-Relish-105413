We enjoyed the scallops but I agree with another reviewer, it wasn't anything special. I would look for a different recipe with scallops over making this again.

Used bay scallops. Followed other reviewer's suggestion and substituted cilantro and the juice of half a lime for the dill. It made the relish sing! Probably my favorite part of the recipe. Sprinkled the scallops VERY lightly with Tony Cachere's before pan grilling.. Served with garlic couscous and broccoli also finished with sauteed garlic and a squeeze of lime. Excellent, yet very light and refreshing.

Very light summer preparation. I served it over basmati rice cooked in chicken broth. An excellent, easy dish that received rave reviews.

In general, the recipe was good for a summer dish, but I would definitely omit the dill since it adds sweetnees to the dish. The dish was already sweet from the sugar added. I will make it next time with cilantro and a bit of lemon instead.

This is a delicious summer meal. Followed the recipe but substituted fresh basil for dill. Lots of fresh ground pepper on the scallops...happy mouth.

This is excellent! Didn't have red wine vinegar so used white wine vinegar instead. Wonderful, clean, easy, delicious.

This is a very easy dish, but quite tasty and visually appealing. I made it with plain buttered couscous and steamed broccoli. I would suggest using garden fresh tomatoes as they will give the relish a better taste than what I was able to get in the market in June where I live.

I made the relish a few hours ahead and let it sit in the fridge. I did not drain the vinegar. I simmered the relish in a wok for about 15 minutes and then added the scallops, simmering for about 10 minutes. I served this over brown rice. The only thing I think this is missing is some lemon juice or wine or both.

The relish seems to be a virtually universal complement to seafood, including scallops, shrimp & crab. We've also tried it in several applications & it affords a bright, fresh, clean taste & texture for the seafood. I've prepared it with rounds of french bread as a canape, as a light dinner salad, & as a main course, & all were well-received. It's surprising, since I'm not generally a dill fan, but this is one of those relish recipes that is genuinely versatile.

Disappointing. There are much better recipes for scallops.

I've made this recipe many times for dinner parties - it always gets rave reviews. Once I made it on a bed of white rice and served it as a meal. Tastes great!

I can only review the tomato-onion relish because I served it with broiled tilipia instead of scallops. Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, even soaking the onions which I had never before seen required. This relish would be terrific with any seafood I suspect.

The relish was very tasty but the dill was slightly overpowering. I love the combination of red onion and tomato, but next time I might add thyme vs dill. An excellent summer evening meal!

We served this at a dinner party along w/ summer lobster also found on epicurious. It was delicious!! A great summer dish. Can be served hot or cold depending on your preference.

This is a very simple, delicious recipe, and I even made it on the George Foreman grill (adjusted the time to ~3-4 minutes)!

I was a bit disappointed by this and don't think I'll make it again (husband agreed). I really didn't like the dill, and the relish was sweeter than I would have liked. I think there are better scallop recipes out there.

Using tomatoes from our garden the tomato onion relish was fantastic. An easy recipe.... would be great as starter...

This is really an amazing dish, and so easy! Very fresh flavors. The sweet of the scallop goes so well with the tang of tomatoes and onion. I was very impressed with how much "hot" was removed from the onion just by the soaking in salted water. No onion aftertaste like I usually have after eating raw onions. I will use that trick often. And, make this dish again soon. Would definitley be a great appetizer!

Very good. Great for an appetizer. Not too filling. Everyone loved it.

This is an easy and delicious way to serve scallops. As I had scallops in the half shell I broiled them and served topped with a teapsoon of the relish.

Delicious recipe. The NJ tomtoes are just coming into season & I'm sure I'll make it a few times this summer. Simple to make.

I found this recipe in gormet and was so happy to see it on your list as the magazine that I use is falling apart from so much use. We love this recipe-it is easy and healthy and very tasty. when its sea scallop season-make this recipe- it brings out the wonderful taste of the scallops. Be sure to let the relish sit and marinate for a bit before putting on the scallops.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a complete success. Lot's of flavor and very easy to prepare. I would suggest cutting the amount of dill to allow the onion and tomato flavors a chance.

As the article mentions, grilling the scallops brings out their sweetness, which combines well with the sweet-tart of the tomato relish. This is an excellent first course for a fancy grill party. Serve with a crisp white, such as Sancerre or Sauvignon Blanc, instead of Chardonnay, so that the full flavor of the scallops can shine through.
