Very bland as written.

This was a great, easy recipe. I used the vegetables I had on hand; zucchini, green beans, fresh garlic, tomatoes, and even added some chicken breast pieces I cooked before the vegetables then set aside and added with everything at the end. This recipe is so easy and delicious, I've made this a few times now!

Delicious! I added some smashed garlic and crushed red pepper flakes to the butter before I added the veggies. Feel free to use whatever suits you. I used broccoli and zucchini instead of mushrooms and green beans. I feel you should use more veggies than the amounts listed here. The half and half reduced nicely.

This is a great simple recipe, but definitely add garlic and plenty of pepper for taste. Can easily substitute any fresh vegi...just cook them crisp-tender. I used zucchini, red & green bell peppers, dried basil (will add fresh when the garden provides!), and a generous pinch of nutmeg. All vegis were about 1 in in size. Served over a bed of baby spinach (which wilts perfectly with hot pasta on top). Took about 25 mins to make. Try this recipe and tweak with your favorites!

Absolutely delicious! We added some minced garlic and increased the amount of vegetables. Great "welcome to spring" recipe!

This is an excellent and easy dish to make. I added a little garlic to the mix as well as some prosciutto and it was even better!

Simple and easy. I use it as a way to clean out the veggie bin...I just toss in whatever I have on hand, and it works out well. I've added more asparagus, corn, grape tomatoes, etc.

Nice way to mix up your pasta with summer vegetables.

I made this recipe with the vegetables I had available, namely asparagus and snowpeas rather than green beans, asparagus, and peas. 1/2 cup didn't feel like nearly enough mushrooms, so I used an entire 8 ounce package, and I'm glad I did. I'd be tempted to increase the amounts of vegetables, too. The recipe was easy, quick, and delicious. I expect to be using this as a base recipe as the various fresh vegetables come in from the garden all Summer.
