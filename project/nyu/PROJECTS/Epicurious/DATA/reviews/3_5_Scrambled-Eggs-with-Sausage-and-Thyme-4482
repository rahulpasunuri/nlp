This was ok. But nothing spectacular. Tasted great. I used, cheddar cheese.

GREAT! Doubled this recipe for a brunch and got great reviews. Used fontina for an extra rich flavor. So easy and simple to make.

Delicious! Served this to a large brunch crowd and got rave reviews. We used fontina cheese instead of cream cheese which paired nicely with the sausage and thyme.

I served this to brunch group of about 15 and they loved it. Rave reviews the whole time. I made it with bacon, regular cream cheese, and sweet onion instead. And doubled the recipe - there were leftovers!

I have this recipe memorized. I have been making it since it appeared in Bon Appetit. I make it whenever I have to feed breakfast to a crowd. Filling, easy to make, and very flavorful. I love the thyme + eggs + sausage. Usually I use a chicken-apple sausage because of a picky crowd re: meat and pork. But a spicier sausage is really good. The creaminess of the cream cheese is really good-- I prefer it to other cheeses in my eggs.

I have been making this for my family for special breakfasts since it was first published in 97. It is THE BEST!!! I panicked when I couldn't find my recipe, so I am relieved to find it so easily online.

I feel terrible being the only reviewer to absolutely detest this recipe but I have to be honest. I have a pretty high tolerance for all kinds of foods and even I could not finish eating this meal. In terms of flavor, the eggs were overwhelmed by the thyme and the green onion (and i added less than what was called for). The flavor of the sausage was completely lost. As for texture, the eggs were dry little curds with pockes of gooey white cream cheese (all cooked on a lower flame than recommended by the recipe). I will definitely not be making this again.

Really delightful and different preparation for scrambled eggs--we'll have this one again!

I love this recipe for an egg dish. I have added diced zucchini to it, that is great also. I have made it several times. It is a keeper.

Made 1/2 recipe for my wife and I. Wife gave me the keys to the stove for this one. We were low on green onions and added about 2 tablespoons of diced tomato. Also, used fresh Boar's head smoked deli turkey (1/4 pound) in place of the sausage. Garnished with red grapes. Added a slice of fresh whole grain bread to the garnishment, as well. This is a definite brunch type preparation. It took less than 15 minutes to prepare, about 5 to eat. Delicious.

I made this recipe for the ingredients that I had on hand. It was a casual sunday breakfast. The eggs were good. There were a lot of flavors and colors that I adore. Yum. Make it next Sunday

I've made this recipe several times now with good reviews. In fact, whenever I have guests over, this is the recipe I think of first.
