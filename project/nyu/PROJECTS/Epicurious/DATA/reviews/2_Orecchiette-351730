I used whole flour and these were actually fun to make once the dough came together - though I made them a bit bigger than the pacakged ones. I might try the garbanzo flour variation next but the whole wheat flour stood up well to broccoli rabe and sausage. And yes, there were fine when cooked according to the directions!

In response to the previous review: I understood the directions to say that you should cook the orecchiette for one minute longer AFTER they have risen to the top.

Made these with whole-grain flour. They were very heavy and should have been cooked much longer than a minute. I will not be making these again
