I halved the recipe (except for the chives; I used nearly the full amount of chives) and baked it in an 8x8 baking dish. In my opinion, the 8x8 inch pan yielded 9 servings. The original 9x13 recipe said it yielded 10 servings,so those must be rather large servings. I used fresh roasted chestnuts, not those from a jar. I thought the texture of the corn was a good complement for the chestnuts. Maybe because we I love the taste of chestnut-sausage stuffing, I felt this recipe could be improved by adding 1/4 - 1/2 lb. of cooked pork sausage before baking.

I made this for some vegetarian friends as a main dish and for an additional side dish with beef bourguignon. My friends, both meat eaters and vegetarians alike, loved it. People here say it is bland, but I thought it was rather delicate.

Madde this for Christmas and was not impressed. Rather bland even with the full amount of cayenne pepper. The chestnuts did not add much flavor either. Having said this, however, my husband enjoyed the dish and would eat it again. Does well as leftovers with a salad on the side.

I made this as directed and found this recipe to be very bland. Served as a side for 20 people and no one had seconds.

Great recipe, although 1 tsp of cayenne was a little too spicy with the other bland ingredients. I would recommend cutting the cayenne in half. Otherwise, loved it and it was great the next day as well.

I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I would definitely make it again.

A fun new side dish for fall and winter! Used whole milk instead of half-and-half (to reduce the recipe's calorie content) and omitted chives (I didn't have any on hand). Consistency was like that of a quiche or fritatta rather than a creamy pudding as I was expecting. The chestnuts are creamy and the dish was delicious! I would make this again.

A new family & quest favourite. Next day breakfast was great for our buffet.
