The salsa was yummy, esp w/ the recommended addition of mango. Overall, the dish was not worthy of the cost for orange roughy!

Made this with orange roughy and it was delicious. I added some cumin to the dredging flour for a little extra flavor. I was making this for my children so I didn't add the chilies, but my husband and I just added some habanero sauce to it on ours which was terrific. All the kids loved both the fish and salsa and could not stop eating the salsa! I did add extra sea salt to the salsa which helped pull the flavors together. I agree, this is a great salsa alone.

Excellent! This coming someone who really isn't that big of a fish eater. I used Tilapia instead of orange roughy. I also took someone's suggestion of adding mango to the salsa, and to me, that really made the salsa. The fish itself is very mild, but the salsa punched it up very nicely. I didn't serve it with the green beans. I served it with some whole grain and wild rice and some black beans. Yum!

I've been making this recipe for the past six years and quite often. I have never used it with orange roughy but usually some other mild white fish. The salsa is great on its own but I usually add about a teaspoon of honey to it along with salt and pepper.

I just made this with Tilapia as others suggested. YUM. I did add lime to the salsa and tossed the salsa in at the finish to warm thru, but still fresh. Can't wait to make it again!

Just FYI - if making this dish you really ought to replace the roughy with a different fish (tilapia would be okay). Orange Roughy is a highly over- fished deep-sea fish that normally has a life span of many decades.

I had a ton of left over tomatoes and onion from a BBQ so I was searching for a salsa recipe when I came across this one. I didn't make the fish, just the salsa. I thought it was a bit bland so I added salt and garlic and it was wonderful. With those small additions it is the best salsa I've ever had and I grew up in San Diego 20 minutes from the boder!

Used tilapia and was disappointed with this dish. Salsa was okay, but wasn't enough to make the tilapia worth making again.

Made with tilapia (thank you for the suggestion) and even my finicky husband loved it.

Trying to get kids to eat more fish? This recipe got raves from mine. I sometimes just bake the fish-tilapia or roughy-the salsa is the real star here. If I don't have chipotle on hand I just use some jalapeno. I've also skipped the beans. This is a keeper.

Excellent. I served this dish as a starter using smaller portions but I pan fried sliced aubergines in olive oil with garlic, placed this on the plate, put the roughy on the top and surrounded it with the sauce. Great.

Not only was this dish delicious, but it looked as great as it tasted! The chipotle chilis added a nice "kick" to the salsa, and I added mango and avocado as one reviewer had suggested. It turned out wonderfully and truly impressed all of my dinner guests. It has already been requested that I prepare this dish again!

I made this dish for my husband's birthday, and he's still talking about it. I also used tilapia instead and it was just perfect! The salsa was so good, I caught my husband eating it the next day with tortilla chips. A great dish for warm weather!

Very tasty dish. I also added sliced green beans to the salsa (raw). Yummers.

Excellent Dish!!! The presentation was impressive and the flavor was unbeatable!

This recipe was a good concept but it definately needed some fine-tuning. I found the salsa to be lacking flavor (other than the overpowering lime), so I added a diced avocado, a diced mango (strawberries would also be really nice), and seasoned with salt & sugar ~ NOW we're talking tasty! Nice, light taste!

A great recipe for single guys to impress the ladies. Try adding fresh diced mangos for a splash of summer fun.

We loved this dish! I used tilapia instead of orange roughy and added more chipotle chilies to the salsa. I served it with corn cakes (BA October 1999) and a salad.

Great recipe! The only change I made was to add more chipote peppers (we like it hot!). Great fresh taste! I do, however, agree with my fellow cook from Texas, and next time I will grill/bake without the flour.

We truly enjoyed this recipe! With fish being the only "meat" we eat, I am constantly looking for innovative ideas and colorful flavor combinations. This was a winner in all categories! I already have plans to make this recipe for friends and know it will be enjoyed.

This was an wonderful dish. I think that the fish would have been better if it had just been baked or broiled without the flour coating. The pico de gallo had a wonderful flavor. I served it with black beans, spanish rice and fried plantains. Excellent!

I thought this was a delicious, easy recipe. It was quick to make and looked and tasted as if it was a lot more difficult. To make it easier, I used the small Bryan tomatoes which I quartered. I made it once without the chipoltes and it was still great.

This cool dish is wonderful for a hot summer day, although you could easily add some heft to it by pairing it with garlic mashed potatoes or grated potato cakes. It is light and fresh, but still flavorful. The only drawback was that the salsa took a while to prepare (my food processor was broke). That might have been for the best, though, because I really liked the chunkiness of the salsa (and therefore the separation of tastes)in conjunction with the tenderness of the orange roughy. While the greenbeans added to the freshness and crispiness of the vegetables in the dish, I think I will try wilted spinach or asparagus next time. Oh, and the portions were good sized.
