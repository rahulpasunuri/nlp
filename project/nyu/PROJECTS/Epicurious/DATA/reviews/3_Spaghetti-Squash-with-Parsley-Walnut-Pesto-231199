I am perplexed by the negative reviews - I thought this was delicious. (Full disclosure: I used pine nuts instead of walnuts, as that is what I had on hand. Everything else was the same, except that I used quantities for ingredients as a very rough guide. ) Based on someone's salt comment, I used 1/4 teaspoon; after tasting, that was clearly not enough. I would definitely make this again.

I doubled the pesto recipe, and I've tried both parsley and arugula, and I like the arugula better. I also usually increase the cheese (I use parmesan). I like to add Italian sausage for protein to make it a meal instead of a side. While I love this pesto with the sweet squash, I also use this pesto recipe for regular (in my case, gluten-free) pasta.

The technique to cook the squash worked perfectly and I will cook it this way moving forward but I didn't like the flavor of the pesto with the squash, it just didn't seem to go together. 1 fork for the cooking technique

This turned out great for us! The squash did not explode in the microwave as I feared. We just didnt use the lemon zest, and substituted cilantro for the parsley.

The squash just exploded in my microwave after 8 minutes, even though it was heavily pierced all over. Luckily, I was able to salvage enough of the "spaghetti" from the inside of the exploded squash to mix it with a basil, parsley and walnut pesto I had made and cover with fresh shaved parmesan and cracked pepper and it was lovely. Next time, I will cut the thing in half and bake. Good news--my distaste for microwaves has, yet again, been validated.

Aack! All was going along fine, and the taste tests I'd sampled were good - until I added the 1 tsp salt (per the recipe). Hellloooo - that is too-too much! Now it just tastes like salt. Dinner is wrecked. Thanks. I might try it again, without all that salt.

This was great and so quick. I was apparently working too quickly and missed the step for toasting the walnuts and it still tasted great. I addeded extra garlic and because I thought the pesto was a little thick, I added the juice of about a 1/2 of a lemon. The flavor is really fresh and compliments rather than overpowers the squash. This will make approximately twice the pesto you need for dressing the squash.

I like spaghetti squash a lot but this recipe was not complimentary to the vegetable. Typically a healthy food, this preparation method added nothing to the dish but made it full of fat. Noth even considerable as "a splurge". It was mushy and heavy. I thought the tip on cooking it in the microwave was superb though as I usually cut the squash in half and that's a challenge.

The flavors of the dish are actually pretty good, I would consider making the pesto again, but sadly the texture is just awful. The longer the squash sat the more watery the whole dish became. I ate some but the sogginess was disgusting. I had no idea how to fix it either.

I have to agree with Charlotte. Not something I would make again. I like spaghetti squash but I did not like the pesto.

Yuck! Maybe an organic squash would have been better. We didn't eat it.

This recipe is a real keeper. I did use a whole clove of garlic instead of a half and substituted parmesan instead of Peccorino because it was on hand. I thought the pesto would also be excellent on pasta or in other recipes as well.

I think the pesto needs to be a spicy basil type in order to balance the bland squash. I baked the squash (opened and cleaned like a pumpkin) in the oven for 50 min, at 375. I added 2 T. butter inside, which I swirled occassionally. My squash-hating husband ate more of it than I did.

Squash is not an alternative in my house so I put a dollop on slices of fresh tomatoes and served it instead of a green salad. It looked very attractive, too, with the tomatoes arranged in an overlapping circle.

Never a fan of spaghetti squash, I concentrated on the sauce, tossed it with penne and served it with a pork roast. I opted for a strong, pungent porcini, added a bit more nuts, coarser ground. a great dish served hot or cold.

A wonderful side dish or light main course. Don't expect it to taste anything like traditional pesto; parsley is much milder flavored than basil. But for a fresh herbal flavor that allows the flavor of the squash to come through, it's definitely worth a try.
