Light and delicious, especially when warm. I used Pam on one half the tin and butter on the other, and the Pam was superior. Bits of madeleines stuck to the butter side but nothing stuck on the Pam side.

This is a delicious recipe. Great subtle flavor and perfect madeleine texture. That said, there are a few specifics about making madeleines and this recipe that one might need to know to make the perfect cookie. 1) A scant tablespoon is NOT enough. Use just over 1 T. Any less and the molds will not fill when baked. 2) At 400 degrees, mine were 3) When you take them out to cool, keep the toasty, darker, pan side down. If you flip them over (so that the upper, exposed side touches the cooling rack or plate) they will stick in the center where they are softest. Enjoy!

Easy to make. Can do the batter ahead. Takes just a few minutes to bake while you get the coffee and rest of the dessert together. Really really good with the ginger honey/yogurt ( did it as a whipped cream). Every last bit finished.
