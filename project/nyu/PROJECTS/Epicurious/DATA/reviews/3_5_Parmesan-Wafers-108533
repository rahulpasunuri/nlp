These are delicious and easy and go great with the tomato soup recipe they appeared with.

Very yummy and crisp, and SO easy on the stovetop. I did use only 2 tablespoons each, because the given dimensions seemed a little big. The wafers were sturdy enough to flip and transfer straight to a rack.

The flavor is these frico is very good with the soup and would also work topping salads. I found that one large wafer atop the soup looked great but was hard to cut. I'd rather have three small bite-size ones instead of one large one.

I made the wafers both ways: oven and stove top with a little hot olive oil. They were both very easy and delicious-- the olive oil added another wonderful flavor, and the oven version kept calories down. Either way-I loved it!

These are fantastic -- I made them in the oven on parchment paper as suggested by another reviewer, and I can't think of an easier way to do it! I made the piles a little smaller than the 3T the recipe called for (I stretched the cheese out to 8 even piles, maybe about 2T each), and they came out light and crisp -- just to-die-for! Sooo easy, and when served with the Tomato and Spinach Soup (also on this site, also super easy) they make a perfect winter weeknight supper.

I made this to go with the roasted tomato soup and tossed salads. They had quite a bit of flavor, easy to do and people like them. Like other reviewers, I made them on the stove using a nonstick skillet.

I am the previous reviewer. I am also an idiot. Forget what I said about the wafers being 'too heavy' I was using the wrong cheese I used Pecorino Romano and thought THAT was too heavy. I have since made the actual recipe and those wafers are insanely good. VERY EASY to make I used the stovetop and a non-stick skillet and even flipped them! Delish. My mother was up for Christmas and was eating the wafers on their own as a snack. Truly good, truly easy. MAKE THESE!!

I thought these were outstanding - I am a big fan of parmesan and cannot wait to think of others things to go with these wafers. Remarkably easy preparation for such an intriguing flavor

These were really good! I made them for the roasted tomato soup. I also made them on my pizza stone. It worked out well. I think I made the stacks too full, they were a bit thick and took longer to cook.

I make these in a skillet on top of the stove and they come out crisp and light. The cheese should just cover the bottom of the pan. Don't flip them. I let them brown just a bit on the edges.

I would probably make these again - they're easy enough, but not a "must have" for the roasted tomato soup. I did have to cook mine longer - about 5 minutes.

Very easy to make, I used a cup fresh grated parmasean and half a cup grated romano cheese and they turned out great. Did it on parchment (sp?) paper and had zero problem, no crumbling..great experience. Would use on salads in future as well as soup.

I made these with the roasted tomato soup. The recipe was simple enough that I let my 2 year old daughter help me (which was fun!), but I was disappointed in the taste and texture - I agree with previous comments that they were "kind of rubbery" and "came out sort of strange", but I may try them one more time as a "crumbled crouton" as someone suggested in their soup recipe review.

Simply outstanding and easy!

These are very good but not crisp. They work as an accompaniement but not a garnish.

These were so easy to prepare and very delicious. However because I served the soup in soup cups, I made them smaller to fit in the cup. I also baked them about 5-10 minutes longer than the recipe suggested. They were baked on a silicone sheet and lifted off perfectly and stored perfectly the day before I served them.

Have not tried this recipe but tried an easier version of parmesan wafers - prepare the same but with no flour, and they are fabulous and so easy. Great for presentation on salads!

These wafers added a nice flavor to the soup but were sort of rubbery and would not cut with a spoon until the soup was all gone. I would make them smaller next time.
