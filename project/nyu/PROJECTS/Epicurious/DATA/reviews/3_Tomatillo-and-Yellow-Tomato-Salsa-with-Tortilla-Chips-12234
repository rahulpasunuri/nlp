I love this salsa. I add a Tbs or two of white wine vinegar,a couple cloves of garlic and don't use any jalapeno but use red pepper instead. It's fresh and sweet and the vinegar really gives it good flavor and brings out the flavor of the tomatoes. Pulse everything in the food processor but the tomatoes. I just tried canning 3 jars, but I'm not sure what will happen to the tomatillos. Hope they don't get slimy!

The salsa was very pretty to look at, and a lot of prep was involved but it lacked flavor. Next time I would add a bit of hot sauce and maybe more jalepenos.

I couldn't find yellow tomatoes, so used yellow pepper. It was such a refreshing change, I'll continue to use only peppers. I served it along with a red tomato salsa. Guests really enjoyed the variety. With the abundance of commercial tortilla chips available, I can't imagine why anyone would go to the mess and trouble of making their own.

I thought this recipe was very fresh tasting. I also substituted tabasco for jalapeno. This way people could adjust the spiciness of the salsa. I brought a bowl of this with me to a picnic and it was gone in half an hour.

This made a nice presentation but was very bland. I added some lime juice to liven it up but it still needed "something" I'm going to fine tune this recipe because I like the way it looked. Maybe some finely diced red peppers to jazz up its looks would be a good idea. Any suggestions?

The uncooked tomatillos are far superior to the cooked ones....a fresh, citrus taste without the tendency to....slimyness.....I hate to say it...that tomatillos can have when cooked. The guests loved this salsa. It was not watery or slimy...just fresh, crisp and delicious.
