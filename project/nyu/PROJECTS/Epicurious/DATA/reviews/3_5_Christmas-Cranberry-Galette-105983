I used my usual pie dough, so I can't speak to the cream cheese crust. Sprinkled a little five-spice powder into the macerating fruit, since I thought it sounded like it could use some spice. The result was pretty good! Halving all the cranberries was a chore, but the result was very tasty. Just what I had been hoping for.

I have made the cream cheese crust with success numerous times. Sounds like the previous review rolled it out when it was too cold... the gallette is great-- highly recommend it. I also use this crust for turnovers (savory or sweet) and other pies.

I'm reviewing this recipe as an admitted pastry novice, but having had some recent successes with making apple galettes from "Chez Panisse Fruit" and "Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone." I made the flaky cream cheese crust exactly as written. It was very easy to do in the food processor, and even seemed to come together nicely while kneaded in the bag, as the recipe indicates. I tossed the dough into the fridge overnight & looked forward to working with it, and prepped the cranberries. Well, maybe it got too cold, maybe I hadn't kneaded it together well enough in the first place, but when I took it out of the fridge, it was cracking all over, and that only got worse as I rolled it out. It cracked all over the periphery and my attempts to patch it were not successful. The filling is tasty (if still a little tart), but it oozed out of the many cracks in my dough while baking, and smoked up the whole kitchen! Still pretty to look at, and tasted pretty good, but the dough was not as friendly to the pastry-impaired as the galette doughs from the other books, which were incredibly easy to work with, roll out, and came out flaky and delicious. I might try it again with one of those doughs.
