I have made this recipe for the past 10 Thanksgivings. I will NEVER try another way as this turns out perfect EVERY TIME. It is so moist/juicy, it seems as though it can't be over cooked. And there is nothing worse than a dry turkey. It is fool proof. I stuff mine traditionally, I just make certain to thoroughly rinse out the inside cavity. The stuffing is never too salty.

This turkey turned out extremely juicy, not at all salty (including the drippings) and with a very nice flavor. It doesn't have a stand on its own flavor I typically expect from a turkey (like Tom Colicchio's Herb Turkey), but I got several many comments saying that this turkey went with everything better than other recipes that I've tried. I agree with the other reviewers that said it browns very fast, so definitely keep an eye on it and baste often. Very tasty.

I have made my turkey this way for the past several years and it has turned out perfect every time. I follow the brine recipe exactly. The last time I made it I plugged the cavity with an apple and soaked a cheesecloth in butter and EVOO and covered the turkey with it. I also basted it during cooking with a cup of Chardonnay with a tablespoon of butter. The flavors of the apple and the Chardonnay blended extremely well. It was delicious!

I just made the gravy as Per recipe. It was disgusting. So creamy. More like a soup than a gravy. Never again

Very good, but with the sugar in the honey the skin browns very fast. I had to cover with foil after about 30 min.

Refrigerator space is always at a premium, so I brine in a commercial grade white plastic bucket (with lid) that came with the 45 pounds of wheat I had previously purchased. Ask a bread baking friend to save one for you. I put the bucket into my tall, rolling cooler and packed around the bucket with ice to guard against the mild weather of the South. The bucket is deep enough to brine two turkeys. I soaked a 23 lb one and a breast all with one recipe of brine. Overnight temperatures were in the 40s but the ice was barely melted.

I was given this recipe by my former employer in 2000. OMG !!!! It is the ONLY way I make a turkey !!! I tried not using this recipe once and my entire family and guests were SOOOO upset with me !! It is the juiciest turkey EVER !!! The gravy is to die for.... very rich but we only use it for special events, so it's not tooo bad for us.

I am making this this year. I have always brined my turkey, but was able to still stuff it as the brine wasnt too salty. Has anyone rinsed off the brine and stuffed the turkey using this brine recipe?

Have used this recipe for several years now, serving 20-25 guests each year, and it is so great that I can't even consider doing something different with the Turkey. I do not follow the recipe exactly. I use mainly low sodium chicken broth (maybe 3/4 broth to 1/4 water). Also, I add a half bunch fresh sage leaves and half bunch rosemary sprigs. I use only half the salt in recipe (1 cup). I do not baste at all, no need to. Instead, I wrap the turkey up in parchment paper and bake it in oven the entire time in the parchment paper. It perfectly cooks to temperature quickly, it browns perfectly, it is perfectly moist, perfectly delicious. The flavor of this turkey is out of this world yummy! Be certain to check temperature of turkey after about 3.5 - 4 hours (depending on your oven - the turkey might be all done cooking!). I then let turkey rest on counter for 30 minutes or so before I carve it. During that time I simmer the pan juices, removing all the bits from it. I then carve the turkey, place it in an electric chafing dish and pour some of the simmered pan juices over the carved turkey evenly. I do this with the pan juices because the turkey is never eaten right as it comes out of the oven and I fear it will dry up as it sits there waiting to be eaten. I set temp to low to keep warm, and my guests all arrive just as I have finished this step. All else has already been cooked and is waiting in chafing dishes so that the turkey is the last thing I do. All is served buffet style simply because of party size each year, and I find this to be the best method to keep a moist turkey moist when serving such a large group. Hope you enjoy..because my family and friends most certainly do and cannot get enough! Word of this great turkey has spread amongst family/friends, and I have shared the recipe with all, and ALL love love love it!

This is by far the best brine recipe I have tried! The final product is so moist, just a hint of honey sweetness & just enough saltiness to be palatable. I usually brine a 14 lb turkey and cook it on a spit on the BBQ. The skin is crispy, a deep golden brown with some charring, yummy, yummy

awful. followed directions to the letter. Used a Bell and Evans organic turkey in my convection oven. Browned so quickly that it spent the rest of its time in the oven covered. That coupled with the constant basting made for dark mahogany colored soggy inedible skin. What was even more odd is that even the white meat darkened - maybe from the honey? None of the brine flavors imparted to the meat and turkey was dry and chewy and unpleasant to look at (and even more unpleasant to eat). Only reason this recipe gets one star is because after doctoring the gravy with some sherry it was pretty decent.

Rarely do I follow a recipe. I have to mess with it. This recipe is perfect. I've made great turkey for years but this is the best. I have made it for the past 3 years and I am about to make it again. I don't think it matters to the brining process what kind of salt or if it disolves. Get a special brining bag or use the sink and turn all night. I had an enormous Ziploc spring a leak, once! Very funny!

AMAZING!!!! This was the most moist and tender and delicous! My family was impressed at thanksgiving and my Mom couldn't get over how beautifully brown the turkey became. TIPS: Use Morton kosher salt, it desolves and melts fast. {I wouldn't use Diamond kosher,it wouldn't disolve and I had to start over and re-do with Morton kosher} I only brined it for 8-9 hours overnight. I used a tip from other reviewers and I used a turkey brining bag tied at the top placed inside of a cooler and kept it out in the car overnight {it's cold here in November-no room in the fridge}To make the brine go up all around the turkey inside the bag so all of it was covered I did this: I placed bowls inside the cooler along with the turkey in the brining bag. I arranged the bowls along the sides of the cooler so they would press on the turkey in the bag and push the liquids up. Use any size bowls that will accomplish this with the open part of the bowls against the walls of the cooler. It sounds like nonsence but it really worked!! I used the extra thick rubber bands from brocolli to secure the top of the brining bag.I found the brining bag at Bed Bath and Beyond store, they sell them in the fall for about 5 bucks. Well worth it. I didn't baste as often as they said, maybe once or twice. I just let it cook and had to cover lightly with foil once it had browned enough to keep it from overbrowning. This is another keeper permanant recipe for my holiday notebook!! We love this new tradition!!!

I've used the cider-brined turkey on this site for years, decided to forego the added expense of the cider this year and thought this was just fine.

I omitted the honey from the brine because it caused the turkey to get almost black by the time the meat was done. This year I left out the honey, and it came out a beautiful golden brown. The meat was juicy and succulent.

i brined my 17lb turkey for 12 hours, and roasted in my convection oven for 3hrs. if not for the brine this turkey would have been overcooked, but it did make the pan juices a tad salty. turkey was a beautiful brown color, but i didn't notice the thyme, lemon or honey in the finished bird. i think next year i'll make just the salt brine from my 'best recipe' book instead.

I prefer my big bird to be made the old fashioned way - salt, pepper and lots of butter. However, I needed to make a turkey that would be able to retain its moistness and flavour for a few extra hours after the roasting and carving was completed, and thus, I turned to brining. I've tried some exotically brined birds made by others and they tasted much too "sandwich-meaty." However, this simple brine resulted in a great tasting, crisp- skinned, well- textured, not too salty bird. Cooking temp was right on per the instructions listed (I cooked a 22# bird for 3.25 hours until the temp read 145 F - rechecked in 45 minutes and it read a perfect 165 F), and you can actually taste the honey in not only the crisp skin, but in the meat. It reheated beautifully when I put the sliced in a roasting pan, covered it with a bit of warm turkey stock, covered it with foil and left in an oven with residual heat for 15 minutes. The only changes I would make: skip the thyme in the cavity or reduce the amount of thyme in the brine (if you do not want thyme to be the first thing you taste),and shove some butter spiked with a large pinch of course salt under the skin of the breast. Otherwise, I'm glad I found this recipe! I made it for my kid's school lunch, and they loved it (even the moms with the discerning palates).

I was looking for a make ahead turkey recipe and this one met the challenge. Even reheating it (with a little low sodium organic chicken broth and it stayed moist and delicious they day after cooking. What I did was brine it like the recipe called for. I used a 13.5 lb turkey so I cut the brine solution down by 1/2 using 4 quarts of water and 1 cup coarse salt and 1/2 c. honey. I let it brine for about 18 hours and I cooked it the night before the event. (I split the turkey in half separating the thighs from the breast. It cooks more evenly this way. A trick I learned from a cookbook by Chef Allen Susser). I put the cooked turkey in the fridge till the next day. When I was ready to heat it I carved the meat from the breast half and the leg half, put it in a serving dish with some low salt organic chicken broth, covered it with foil and set it in a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes. My guests raved about the flavor and juiciness. It really is a great turkey recipe that allows you the versatlility to prepare it in advance so you aren't killing yourself the day of the party.

This will be my traditional recipe. The gravy was FABULOUS! I did make a couple of modifications. I skipped the lemon in the turkey and added a stalk of celery and a few sprigs of celery, and 4 halves of shallots instead. Also, for the stock, I added a few sprigs of parsley and a bit of thyme.

It seemed to cook much faster and I had to cut down the time to just 2 and one half hours for a 17 lb. free range bird. Even then, I was glad that I checked it as I wasn't thinking that it would be done so soon. We enjoyed the gravy as well.

I used this recipe for thanksgiving and I could not believe how good it was. I chose it because it had high marks. My turkey was 18 lbs. I only used 1 1/2 c. of salt and brined for 15 hrs. It came out moist and flavorful like everyone wrote. I had to cover the legs after half an hour and the whole turkey after one hour because it was getting way too brown. If I had not covered it, the skin would have been burnt. Instead, it came out looking perfect. For the gravy I used the turkey's fat, flour and drippings. Did not use more salt. I thought the gravy's color and flavor were excelent. I will definetely do it again but I would like to try this recipe with a whole chicken next time.

This was my first turkey ever and since I am in Basque country, I made it for a group that had NEVER HAD turkey before...! (didn't know that was possible) BUT it was soo moist and just melted in our mouths. The best turkey I have ever had. I brined it in an ice chest inside the refrigerator for about 16 hours. I couldn't taste AT ALL the thyme or lemon just moist goodness! The gravy was heavenly as well--didn't use the turkey parts, just a couple spoonfuls from the pan with the recipe. I was running short on time so I just boiled the broth with vegetables on high for much less time and it was still excellent. I served it with the "mashed potatoes with prociutto" from this site and Campbell's recipe for green bean casserole. And topped it off with my famous pecan pie (was the least popular part of the meal!!)

I started brining this turkey 2 days before it was needed, as we had to travel with it in a cooler, then put the cooler on a sled and snowshoe up to a wintery cabin in the mountains of WA state. We couldn't read the old propane oven's temp. gauge, but thankfully, I remembered to bring a turkey thermometer. It was in the oven for 3.5 hours at ?? temp. before it reached 180 degrees. I was concerned that it would be too dry after all that time in the oven, but to our suprise, it was the juiciest turkey we've EVER had! The gravy was perfect - not too salty. A turkey to remember!

I followed the brine recipe except my turkey was a little smaller. It was excellent! Very tender and not at all dry. It had a nice salty, herby flavor. You don't even need gravy! I didn't make the giblet gravy. I made my own with the bits and juice from the bottom of the pan. I mixed butter, flour & chicken broth until I got the consistancy I wanted. It was great!! I will make this recipe every year for Thanksgiving and also in between!

This was a wonderful recipe. The brine was easy to make and I brined the turkey for 12hours. I roasted the turkey as directed with the exception of using butter instead of oil to rub on the turkey. I also alternated basting the turkey with the broth and butter. The turkey came out very moist. I made the gravy and it was a nice compliment to the turkey and stuffing. Being an American expat in Holland I make an annual Thanksgiving dinner for friends and family. It is a United Nations table of different cultures who have never had whole turkey or stuffing before i started my annual dinner party. My guest loved the meal and this recipe. Thank you Ms. Fletcher for sharing this lovely recipe.

I used this brine for my boneless 3 pound turkey breast(with skin)that I purchased from Whole Foods. I halfed the recipe and only brined it for 6 hours. I was afraid that it would get too salty. It was excellent. The turkey was juicy and flavorful. I roasted it to 160 degrees. I will definitely make again.

I've been making this for several years since I discovered the recipe here. It is beyond compare, flawless. I acknowledge the note below about the plastic bags. I agree with it conceptually. A few times a year I brine my turkey in a five gallon Home Depot bucket, lined with two white plastic kitchen garbage bags. It works great. Maybe the chemicals are the secret ingredient here.

I have used this recipe for years, but the with the alteration I made this year, I believe I have found my perfect Thanksgiving turkey recipe. First, I made the brine and brined the turkey as directed. Second, we grilled the turkey using Gourmet's 2005 Grilled Whole Turkey recipe. So simple! Then we used the lovely smoky drippings with this cream gravy recipe, and the flavor of the gravy, which I had always thought delicious using this recipe, soared to new heights. So glad we tried this combination of recipes!

DO NOT USE any Home Depot 5 Gallon Paint Pails for your brine soak or trash bags as some have suggested; these are NOT food grade and will leach unwanted chemicals into your turkey; use a 5 gallon pail from a local food supply company or a 6 gallon home brew bucket from a brewing supply shop, as these are food grade and will NOT leach into your brine!

Okay - I have brined a number of turkeys and it really is the way to go. In my opinion it is the rule for cooking turkeys. If you have never brined a turkey then you are in for a treat and this recipe certainly works. That said, in my opinion it was not as spectacular as the reviews seem to suggest. In fact, I found it somewhat bland or, at best, average in the arena of brined turkeys. Also, it was moist but not as much as I expected and I wonder if it wasn't because I cooked it to the recommended 180 rather than 170 degrees - there is some difference of opinion in the recipes I have used. On the positive side, the lemon and thyme add a nice flavor to the drippings (I added chunks of butter to the cavity as well) that then work wonders in the giblet gravy. The gravy is really what I think made the recipe work. I should also add that the bird was pretty well picked over by the end of the evening.

I made this for Thanksgiving back in 2001, and loved it, but haven't hosted it since. This past year, though, 2005, my wife and I unexpectedly found ourselves unable to travel to her parents' for the holiday because of the weather. It was way too late to brine a turkey (I barely had time to GET one), but I tracked down this recipe and made the gravy, which was fantastic. Ever since, I regularly make gravy from this recipe whenever I roast a chicken, using a chicken that comes with giblets. I don't include any of the meat in the gravy -- I strain it out after the liquid cooks down -- but the gravy is as awesome as it is at Thanksgiving. Sometimes, I make it with half and half or even regular milk to save a little fat. It's really not worth it. Splurge!

I have made this turkey for the last 2 Thanksgivings and it is beautiful! Moist breast meat and a fantastic brown colour. It does brown quickly so I recommend covering with foil after the first hour of cooking and then taking the foil off for the last 1/2 hour to give it a final colour. Brined for 12 hours, rinsed turkey in sink. I did not think the pan drippings were too salty and added these to the gravy to make more! Used all giblets to make stock but then only included neck meat in the gravy. Both years, all 15 people said it was the best turkey they'd ever had!

Rating: 4
This is by far the best turkey recipe ever!! I have prepared my fresh turkey this way for the last 5 Thanksgivings. I have never had anyone NOT request the recipe. The result is the juiciest, best tasting turkey. I typically allow my turkey to soak for a minimum of 24 hours. The honey in the brine tends to prematurely brown the turkey, so I keep it well covered once it starts browning, and remove the foil in the last half hour. Also, I tend to use more than the 5 cups of low sodium chicken broth, so keep extra on hand. The key is in the basting, so I set my kitchen timer to remind myself to do it every 30 minutes. They gravy is excellent, and although I prepare the stock with the giblets, I do not chop them up and add them to the finished gravy. You will not regret serving this...it is a foolproof hit, and once you get the turkey brining, very little effort to prepare!

This is the greatest turkey recipe ever and it will continue to grace our table for years to come. Two thumbs and four forks up!!

I've made this dish about 6 times now, and I honestly never had a better turkey than the ones produced with this recipe. I use a big Coleman cooler to soak the bird in the brine overnight on my deck outside. It's cold enough to prevent spoiling and the cooler keeps the animals from getting to it. I recommend warming the honey to get it to thin out so it mixes into the brine easier. During cooking, I baste every 30 minutes, starting after the second hour. I've made the gravy recipe a few times, and it's a good old timey kind of grandma's giblet gravy, but I actually like a lighter gravy than this one. I'm fortunate to have a garden so I make this with my own fresh herbs. This one is as good as turkey gets.

Have started preparing for this year's T-day celebration, and nearly had a panic attack when I couldn't find this tried-and-true recipe on my initial website search (for "honey-brined")!! It just wouldn't be the same had I not been able to repeat our 6-year-running family tradition using this brining version. I'm all in with the themes of the previous reviews: Kosher (NOT table) salt; rinsing well; special-purpose ice chest on the back porch to save refrigerator space; even the upside down roasting for the first 1/3 of cooking time (perhaps optional/over-kill!). But, as they say: use the best ingredients you can find. I always try to pre-order a free-range fresh turkey. Seems to be worth the extra few dollars when you're putting in so much time and effort to feed a big group; don't know if that's the key, or this brining recipe -- but I'm not about to mess with success :-)

Rating: 4
Just to add a note to the messaage about not using non-food-safe products for brining. Some companies have now come out with "brining bags"...however, King Arthur Flour has a large NSF-certified food-safe sealed bin for flour storage that works wonderfully with the brining. It is all I use the container for, and it stores nicely in the basement between Thanksgiving holidays. By Thanksgiving, the weather outside is about what you'd find in your refrigerator, so overnight brining on the back porch is easy...no critters can bother the sealed container and the bird stays submerged. (See earlier comments about the brine itself...and this year, the gravy will be tried!)

I have made this many times, it is wonderful. A word of caution though, do NOT use garbage bags, compacter bags, paint buckets or other non food grade products. There are food grade buckets available at restaurant supply houses. If you use a non food grade bucket double line it with large turkey bags.If you have a large stock pot that works. But non food grade products should be a serious NO-NO. When it says garbage bags , that is what it was intended for, garbage. Also rinsing it the turkey well after brining is a must. Then I usually refrigerate the turkey after rinsing and patting dry, for an hour or so, to let it let it dry on the surface thoroughly.

This was GREAT. The turkey breast was moist and the colour was amazing. I did have to tent it with foil for the last hour to prevent burning. Used coarse sea salt to brine. Gravy was tasty -- a classic cream gravy. I didn't cut the giblets up and add them to the gravy (personal preference), but I did use the meat from the boiled neck, chopped it up and added that instead. My 12 Thanksgiving guests were mightily impressed.

Brining the turkey is the way to go. The turkey was a little overcooked (due to visitors etc.) but it was still moist and delicious. The gravy was great. I didn't add the chopped giblets and neck as I know my sister would have passed out had she heard that one. Didn't need it anyway. I used ALL the drippings but used 1/2 cup less salt (Morton's Kosher)than asked for in the brine as it was my first time. I will use it all next time. I basted only twice since the convection does a great job without it. I stuffed the turkey as well and everything was fantastic. Roasted upside down for 2/3 time. The whole table raved and this is a family of fussy turkey eaters. I didn't tell anyone how I was preparing it so they wouldn't have any ideas in advance and they really loved it.

GREAT recipe! This was my first time making a turkey and all of my family really enjoyed it. I saved room in my refrigerator by brining the turkey in a cooler I kept in the garage.

This was truly fantastic! I served this for Thanksgiving and received raves from all the guests. Incredibly juicy meat, beautiful brown skin. I didn't taste any honey or thyme in the meat, but there was a very subtle taste of lemon that was quite complimentary to the taste of the meat - both the white and the dark. I rinsed the turkey after removing it from the brine and consequently the pan juices were not salty at all. I added almost 2 cups of pan juices to the gravy (tasting after each quarter-cup addition) and it was not a bit too salty; in fact, the gravy was as big a hit as the turkey, and easy too, since I made the stock for it the day before. I'm making this one again for Christmas and the family is already looking forward to eating it again.

This is excellent. The breast meat is moist, the gravy is scrumptious, and if there are leftovers, everyone wants to take them home! Everyone commented how beautiful the skin was--crisp and mahogany. I've made it the last four years and have had nothing but compliments. I use Diamond Kosher Salt and brine for 18 hours. The turkey is not salty. In fact, I always stuff the turkey and use the full one cup of pan drippings for the gravy and have not had a problem with saltiness these last four years. I agree with other reviewers who say that the brand of kosher salt does matter. Between Diamond and Morton kosher salt and regular table salt, Diamond is the least salty and table salt is the most. We did a 25 lb turkey this year and it took 4 1/2 hours to cook.

This is a very good recipe for brining. I cooked the turkey on the grill, as I've done for the last 4 or 5 years. Amazing. The skin is all mahogany and crispy - it looks like Peking duck. Yet, it's moist on the inside. What more could you want from your turkey?

We had a smaller turkey -- 12-1/2 pounder -- so I cut back the salt by 1 cup and reduced the amount of water a bit. We also let the turkey rest at room temperature for 90 minutes before roasting it, and we took it out when the internal temp hit 150 degrees and let it rest again for 45 minutes -- the internal temp rises to 170 or so. You don't overcook the turkey that way. This was super-moist. I did not detect any thyme, lemon or honey flavors. Regardless, we are definitely making this again next year. The gravy was okay -- for all the time reducing the stock I expected something more impressive.

After 32 years of having Thanksgiving at a family members' home, it was time for me to prepare a dinner for my family in our home. Cooking is my passion and I was anxious about the turkey which is usually cooked in haste and served cold and I knew it could be better. Well, after searching recipes, I chose this one and another with stuffing and vegetables and I combined with great success. I loved the turkey, definitely noticing the difference in taste and texture. The stuffing, the gravy and the vegetables all added to a perfect turkey. thanks.

This is the second Thanksgiving we have used this recipe. It is very good, but I did not use any pan drippings in the gravy because they make it too salty. I will never cook another turkey without brining it, but 12 hours is enough already. The wings and legs are too salty if you brine the turkey any longer than 12 hours.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I would have to say that this recipe is even better than the herb brined turkey with apple cider gravy recipe that I used last year. I only have a couple recommendations: 8-10 hours of brining seems to be adequate, watch the turkey closely for rapid browning! As for the gravy: wow! I got a couple cringes when I told the guests about the giblet gravy, so I chickened out at the last minute and subsituted chopped sauteed shitake mushrooms for the giblets. I also added another 3 Tb of roux to thicken the gravy since it was rather runny.

We've heard how wonderful a brined turkey is, but we were still amazed at just how moist and delicous our bird was this year! Everyone loved the turkey w/out having to add any seasoning at the table, and the gravy was fabulous as well. I only used a little of the drippings because of the saltiness, but I didn't need to add *any* seasoning to it -- the juices really add a depth of flavor, I think.

Well, I've been the turkey chef many, many years and after tasting a brined bird at a cooking class, I thought I'd give it a try. With the reviews of this recipe, this is the one I tried. First of all, you can save the knives for another dinner, you won't need them. The turkey was SO moist. Even my biggest skeptic and scrooge guest had to say it was the most moist she'd had ever. The gravy is to die for (as it should be with that much butter for the roux.) My father in law did mistake it for soup and fixed himself a bowlful! But, now the bad news... like another reviewer said, it took longer to cook than it should have and by the time the internal heat came up to 160...the skin was blackened. I've never had this happen before. Was it the brining that does this? I usually plate my turkeys for the display and then take it back to slice. This year, I had to usher everyone to the other room before I could take it to the table. Didn't notice much difference in taste...but the moist level CANNOT compare. and...again...gravy is CRAZY good!

I'be brined turkey before, but this particular recipe for the marinade is quite good. The honey/sugar garlic, pepper and thyme is just enough to make the dish special. Never any problem here with saltiness; used the recipe as written. Next time, though, I will make the gravy, as the supposedly time-saving gravy from the butcher shop was bland and needed way too much doctoring. I'm glad that brining poultry has taken hold. 200 other reviewers can't be wrong!

Rating: 4
This was sooo good! I cut back on the salt in the brine by half a cup because I didn't want to waste all of those drippings! So I used all the drippings for the gravy and it was fabulous! I also stuffed the turkey with the sage stuffing recipe on this site, I didn't add salt to the stuffing and cut back on the liquid in the recipe too. It was the best stuffing EVER! My family was very pleased with this one!!!

This is the third time I've made this turkey, but the first time for the gravy. Coming from a gal who NEVER eats gravy, this is the BEST tasting stuff!!! I practically ladled some in a bowl and ate it like soup. Excellent!!!

This is the third year in a row I have made this turkey and it simply is the best. It is so moist that you don't even need to baste it. I have tried to sell my cooking friends on brining and a lot of the comments I get is that it is too time consuming. Trust me, just try it once and you will be sold. This year I didn't have any fresh thyme so I used some Herbs d'Provence - excellent!

Amazing....I am printing this one out and saving it! This was probably my BEST Thanksgiving feast yet and I've cooked many. My mother was so impressed with the turkey that she is going home and making one this weekend. (NO, of COURSE I didn't send her home my leftovers!!) Since I stumbled across this recipe a little too late for me to get a fresh turkey, I used a frozen 20# Honeysuckle, which I rinsed very well prior to brining. I brined the turkey in a large stockpot lined with a large turkey roasting bag for nearly 24 hours. The turkey was perfection after a mere 3 1/2 hours of cooking in my convection oven. It was so beautiful I wanted to take a picture...next year I will. This was the most flavorful, moist turkey that I can ever remember having, and I am now thoroughly sold on brining. The gravy was VERY good, but a bit on the rich side and so I'm not sure I'll enjoy it with my "turkey-n-gravy" leftovers tomorrow.

To the person looking for advice on brining...I did brine my last turkey, but the general feeling around the table was that with a fresh bird it wasn't necessary. For a grocery store bird though I definately would. What I did was heat about 4 cups of water in my stock pot and then add coarse salt (two cups) and brown sugar (1 cup). I topped this mixture wiht cold water, added my turkey and let it sit in the fridge overnight.

I have been making this turkey since 1999 when I found it in Bon Appetit magazine. It's fantastically juicy and the color is always gorgeous. Highly recommend this recipe. My mother in law makes it now too after having it for the first time at my house in 1999.

I haven't used this particular brine recipe but have brined and then smoked many birds on the Weber over the years. Very delicious. Someone below asked if there was a way to get the salt to dissolve faster. You can simmer the brine solution until all is dissolved, then cool it back down using some ice water as part of the 8 quarts of water in the recipe.

Rating: 4
Just for those who don't know, the variance in the saltiness depends on the type of kosher salt you use. If you look at the Nutrition facts, you will see that Morton Kosher salt has 480 mg of sodium for 1/4 tsp while Diamond Crystal has 280 mg per 1/4 tsp.That is quite a differene. Chances are, the man from Hawaii used a "saltier" kosher salt. And there would be a BIG difference if you were to use non kosher salt.

This will be the 4th time I have used this brine recipe. For the cook who wants a quicker cooking time...I cook the turkey after brining in a Reynold's wrap cooking bag. Then cut the top off for the final 1/2 hour to brown...Just too easy!

I thought this turkey was moist but too salty! I even decreased the amount of Kosher salt. The gravy had more of a buttery taste-not a clean turkey taste. I was quite disappointed with this recipe.

I actually didn't use this receipe but I used Martha Stewart's which was just a brine. It came out great as most of the responses here verify. However, the second year I made the turkey, I stuffed it and it was fine. As long as you don't feel the turkey is too salty without stuffing, the stuffing will come out fine. I'm going to try one of of these receipes, probably the honey-brine. Also, I never marinate my turkey in a plastic bag. I use my canning pot, remove the rack and soak the turkey in that. If I'm cooking two, I buy an inexpensive hard plastic bucket (they use these in restuarants too) and marinade the other turkey in that.

I used this brine recipe for the first time last Thanksgiving. Aside from a wonderfully simple recipe to prepare we had the most fantastically moist turkey I have ever eaten!

I have never made a really tasty turkey before, so I thought I'd give this recipe a shot before I gave up on turkey. The skin was crispy and a beautiful rosy color, the meat was moist.

I'm making this dish again for the 4th time, and thought I'd finally review it. Brining is great for poultry, pork, or any meat that tends to dry out during roasting/grilling. I and my guests thought that in addition to producing a succulent, juicy turkey all around (no dry, chewy breast meat!), the Honey in the recipe imparted a very delicate flavor that gravy could easily overwhelm. The Gravy is outstanding in itself as well!! I've made this twice to take to work to share with some Asian coworkers who seem facinated by turkey, and they always clamor for more. I get the same reaction from my holiday guests as well! :)

This turkey turned out very well, though I have to admit, the flavors of the brine did not really come through. The meat was moist, skin crisp and the gravy was worth the effort. After 20 years of cooking roast turkey, my husband and I agree brining is the best approach to a moist bird.

This was my first attempt ever @ brining a Turkey, I've tried it with other meats and liked it so much, I decided to try your recipe. It turned out great! We grilled the turkey instead of roasting it, and it was really wonderful, the honey and thyme gave the turkey a smokey, herby-sweet flavor and man was it moist, my family loved it! We'll do this again for sure. I also used the brine for cornish hens (for family that doesn't care for turkey), although did not brine them as long, and they were moist and juicy as well.

I made this recipe, but didn't rate it because I did not really taste the difference from my normal roasted turkey. I do not know if this is because I was tired, concentrating on my side dishes, or because it really didn't taste any different. If anyone cares to comment - did your turkey taste different, or was it just juicier than normal?

I didn't use this particular brine, so I'm not rating. But - for people who felt that the brine is too salty. Different brands of salt have a different level of saltiness. My brine recipe specifies different amounts for Diamond kosher, regular and Morton kosher. Ordinary Table Salt 1 cup Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt 2 cups Morton Kosher Salt 1-1/2 cups Adjust accordingly and the brined turkey will always beat any other kind!

Just tried this recipe for Thanksgiving (1st time ever brining anything). It was incredible! The colr alone made it worth the extra work...a deep-golden brown like I've never seen before. And it was unquestionably the moistest poultry I've had. Going to try it with a chicken this week. Would definitely make this again!

I didn't make the gravy b/c giblet gravy squeeves me but the brine was fantastic! I've done brines before but I really loved this one. It was very easy to put together and the turkey was great.

I made this recipe for the first time this Thanksgiving. Up until this time my turkey dinners have been good but not something that drew other than polite comments. This time my family were raving about how good the turkey and gravey were. Today is the day after Thanksgiving and I am receiving calls asking me how to make a turkey as good as the one they had and asking for the recipe. Even received a call from a family members friend who asked for the recipe. Must have been a winner. Guess what I'm going to cook for Christmas dinner.

I was skeptical about trying this, especially on Thanksgiving...but after the rave reviews it'd received, I gave it a try. WOW!!! The skin was quite blackened, probably from the honey, and I was terrified it was overdone. But, as I cut into my 30+ lb. bird, the juice was literally pouring down the meat. I have never made or ate such a moist/juicy turkey. Everyone couldn't believe how fabulous this was. They all agreed it was the best turkey they'd ever had. I will never make my turkey any other way. Thank you!

Janet Fletcher, your grandmother is genius! Wow, this was beyond expected! I did not have the room in my refridgerator for the brine and bird, so I used a large drink cooler, like the ones at football games. It held the turkey with ample room for ice outside the bag. I roasted the turkey breast-side down for the first 2 hours and never basted, as suggested by a previous reviewer. I don't know if that actually helped, but it definitely didn't hurt. The skin came out golden brown and delicious, and the meat was incredibly juicy and tender. The gravy. Wow. The gravy is glorious. It upstaged the turkey! I can't wait to make this again!

I used a Whole Foods free-range turkey, and actually I had the opposite problem from another reader: my 13 lb turkey cooked in 3 hours, which is a little faster than normal. Since this is the first time I brined a turkey, I wasn't sure if brined turkeys in general took shorter to cook, or if it was b/c the turkey was free range (and thus less fatty). Anyone else have a problem with the skin burning faster than normal? Otherwise, very tasty, and well worth cooking. I modified the gravy by not throwing in the chopped giblets at the end, but it was still delicious.

I made this turkey several weeks ago for a group of 8 friends and it was absolutely the best turkey ever...and I've made dozens of them over the years...everyone was practically licking their plate! Several suggestions for other readers...use kosher salt, definitely rinse the turkey if you don't want it to be too salty. Since we're blessed with warmer nights here in San Diego, keeping it outside overnight is not an option. I put the brine and turkey in an oven roasting bag, sealed it and then put it in a large roasting pan...had to remove a shelf from my extra refrigerator to fit, but that worked. I always start my turkey breast side down in a 500 degree oven...roast for 30 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 350 and continue. I flip it over about 2/3 of the way through the total cooking time...guaranteed the juiciest breast meat ever! I didn't baste this turkey once! The color was absolutely gorgeous and would qualify for a photo for a magazine cover. This is the only recipe I will ever use for turkey from now on. If you had a 5 fork option, this would warrant it. Also, did not make this gravy, but the porcini mushroom from this site, and it too was worth 5 forks. Thanks Epicurious!

Can only comment on the turkey part, but the brining produces a fabulous turkey. I added half a bunch of fresh sage to the brining solution and put the other half in the cavity when I roasted it, along with some more garlic cloves. I used a free-range turkey, rubbed it all over with olive oil, cooked it breast-down at 325 degrees for two hours, then flipped it and cooked until done. I didn't bother to baste it, and it still came out amazingly juicy. (The upside-down roasting is key, I think.)

People...THIS is your Thanksgiving Turkey!!!Unreal.Juicy, tender, even caramel colored skin and easy easy easy!I cooked it last year with rave reviews (from my mother in law, no less).B/c it was very cold outside, I placed my bird in a large trash bag and put it in a cooler on my deck with a heavy object on top so animals would not get in to it. I was wonderful b/c I didn't have to take up space in my small fridge with a 20lb bird nor did I have to worry about any bacteria building up on it! If it isn't as cold this year, I will do the same technique with ice surrounding the trash bag.Brine it! It is the only way I cook Turkey or chicken from here on out! Happy Turkey Day!

I made this dish right after it was published in Bon Appetit. It is fantastic and I've made it every Thanksgiving since. A couple of improvements I made makes it even better. First, after you prepare the brine, using a flavor injector, pump 10% of the turkeys weight. So if your turkey weighs 20 lbs. (that equals 320 ozs) you would inject 32 oz of brine in breast, legs, and thighs. Brine up to 3 days. Last, bake turkey breast side down 2/3 of baking time. Turn over to brown breast. That way, the juices settle in the breast meat, not in the turkey cavity.

I've made the Thanksgiving turkey for my extended family for 15 years and got the best ever raves with this recipe. I followed it exactly. The pot I had wasn't quite big enough to submerge the turkey in, but the bag trick provided in the recipe works. The honey brining makes the turkey really juicy and it comes out with a wonderful evenly-caramelized skin. Will use it again this year.

BEST turkey we've ever had. The only thing we had a problem with was spilling the brine when trying to put it into the trash bag. My fault. But beware, it makes a mess when you spill.

I never made a whole turkey before and used this recipe as my first attempt to do so. Well, it was a hit! It came out absolutely delicious and so incredibly moist.

The gravy was incredible as well.

After reading all the great reviews of this recipe, I had to try it for final holiday dinner with relatives. You all were right! The turkey was tender, juicy, and delicious.

I will definitely consider using this recipe again next year.

Frist of all I have to say that the creamy gravy was delic! I made enough stock so that I frozed what I didn't need. For the brine, since I was using a very large turkey, I used apple cider with water. I doubled the recipe because of the size of the turkey. I soaked the turkey in an ice cooler that we use for summer camping and it worked great. I then rinsed the turkey, and soaked it again overnight in clear water because I stuffed mine and I feared it might be too salty, but the second soaked took care of that. I will make this again next Thanksgiving. I now just need to perfect my stuffing and my turkey will be perfect!

I have made this twice, most recently for Christmas and it is very good. Though it seems a little daunting, I don't think I can ever make a turkey a different way. For a 20 lb turkey, I have removed the bottom shelf from my fridge and put a cooler inside to hold the turkey and brine. I have also brined at smaller turkey (13 lbs) by putting it in the bottom vegable bin and adding the brine. If your turkey sticks out of your cooler or vegetable bin, cover the exposed area with cheesecloth and drape the excess in the brine to keep it moist. I added a small amount of melted butter to the chicken broth I used for basting. This turkey browns very fast! Watch it carefully and cover with the foil tent if it is too brown, yet not quite done. For the smaller turkey I did not reduce the amount of brine.

Since my husband had been out of town for Thanksgiving and didn't get enough turkey I wanted to cook a turkey for Christmas and to have our own leftover turkey . The rest of my family balked that they didn't want turkey again so soon after Thanksgiving. Anyway, I decided to try this recipe and it was so delicious that they all changed their tunes and all wanted to take home my leftover turkey!! NO DEAL! Lucky for them, I also cooked a huge fresh ham roast, and stewed venison in addition to our regular wonderful side dish favorites. They did get those leftovers to take home while my husband and I enjoyed the leftover turkey! I will be making this again and again. So easy and moist, moist, moist. The container for brining that I used was a very large soup pot (18-20 quart size), lined with an Oven Roasting bag for turkeys, the cleaned 19 lb. Butterball turkey and the mixed brine. It all fit perfectly and closed tightly!. It was cold enough outside to place the pot overnight! I wiped the turkey dry after brining but did not rinse it. All the juices that were released were NOT too salty. I think people don't follow the directions for using REDUCED SODIUM chicken broth! In addtion I only needed ONE can of low sodium Butterball Chicken broth to baste the turkey with, because after a couple of hours of cooking ( more or less), there was plenty enough juices to baste with anyway! I used dried rosemary and dried thyme in the brine.

Awesome. Yup, brining is the way to go. Never again will I endure the embarassment of a dry & flaky turkey. The brining process was a bit of a hassle: no room in the fridge, and couldn't leave the brining bucket outside because of the hungry and wily racoons in the 'hood. Ended up putting the bucket in the backseat of the car parked outside, which was the perfect fridge-like temperature. (Except, at 2:00 p.m. on Christmas Eve, I realized I didn't have a platter to put the finished turkey on, so I drove like a maniac to the nearest kitchenware store, and made a sharp turn which caused the bucket to flip over!! Thank god for sealed brining bags.)

My first ever Christmas turkey ... and a HUGE success!! The turkey I bought already had a marinade on it, so I just added honey, garlic and thyme ... easy!

This recipe was just as fabulous as everyone said! I halved the recipe as our turkey was just about 8 pounds and threw the garlic from the brining process into the turkey's cavity. As turkeys here don't come with giblets - it's just the bird and nothing but the bird! - I made a gravy simply using the pan drippings, which were plentiful, and mixing in some milk and chicken broth. The turkey was succulent and indeed, the meat fell right off the bones. And yippee, we have leftovers tonight!

Best turkey ever, that's what they say. Have made this half a dozen times, every time people go crazy for it. Tips: - I use a clean five-gallon plastic bucket to soak the bird in. - The gravy recipe is terrific, by the way. Forget about using the pan drippings for gravy, just way too salty. Make sure you have plenty of stock or broth on hand for that. I mix half chicken broth with half Knorr vegetable bouillon and the stock I make from the turkey neck, etc., then use the pan drippings to salt the gravy to taste.

Oh my gosh! This was my first turkey I have ever made and honestly, it was the BEST I have ever had. I grew up with dry turkeys and this one was so moist and full of flavor. My mother has actually asked me to take over "turkey duty" for Christmas!

I agree with a cook from Houston...DO NOT USE plastic trash bags. That type of plastic in not food safe and leaches into your food. Use a big stock pot. Also, after several dozen turkeys, I have found that adequately cooking a bird bigger than 14 lbs. is not possible. Cook two smaller ones if needed, but go small for better taste and evenness.

A previous reviewer suggested that the brine would kill any microorganisms that might be found in clean garbage bags used for brining. This is not true! There is nothing in the brine solution that would kill microorganisms. You should use a bag meant for cooking, such as a Reynolds turkey bag, instead of a garbage bag.

Combined the turkey portion of this recipe w/ the Butter Injected Turkey recipe and it was the best turkey ever! My mother-in-law even thought it was the best. Adding the butter injection, the 500 temp for first 20 min, and the herbs to the brined bird made an exceptional turkey and drippings for gravy. Definately a family tradition.

Brined our Thanksgiving turkey for deep frying, accidentally put all the honey & thyme in, some extra black pepper and let it soak for 18 hours! The very best yet. We usually inject with seasonings as well as brine and this one kicked butt without the extra work! KEEPER

I brined our turkey this year and had mixed results. The bird was very juicy and the meat quite tender, but the center was still pink and undercooked. Perhaps it was frozen in the center (although the grocer claimed it was fresh and not frozen)? The meat thermometer read that it was cooked thoroughly so I am at a loss. Suggestions and comments are welcome! Thanks.

This was my first time cooking Thanksgiving dinner by myself and I was a little scared about brining a turkey, however, the result was incredible. I put the whole ting in a large plastic storage container and left it in our garden shed overnight(shed provided a little more protection from animals). When I cooked it a put all the garlic cloves and two lemon halves from the brine in the turkey cavity, I cooked it at 500 for 20 minutes to brown the skin then covered it with tinfoil and let it go till done(looks and tastes so much better if the skin is browned in the beginning instead of at the end). The result was a beautiful deep reddish-brown bird. Everybody raved that it was the best turkey they ever had. My dad even took a picture of it.

This is by far the best turkey I have ever made (or tasted). I had never tried brining before, and became concerned when reading the debate over impurities in the plastic garbage bags. I used a Reynolds plastic oven bag made for turkeys (holds a bird up to 24 pounds).

This was a fabulous turkey brining solution and gravy!! As always, I cook my turkey outdoors on the grill with wood chips - it was gorgeous to look at, very moist and flavorful! The gravy was EASY and fabulous (even though I hate chopped up organ meats.....left them out but used them in the broth). Outstanding! Rinsing thoroughly is, indeed, the key to perfect brining without too much saltiness! I didn't do this a few years ago and we all puckered throughout the meal!

As a previous reviewer stated, the 5 gallon Homer Home Depot bucket was the perfect size for brining my 17 pound bird. I put the turkey in a roasting bag, placed it in the Homer bucket, then poured in the brine into the roasting bag. After tying the bag, I poured ice over the turkey and placed the bucket out on my front porch. There's no way I could have fit this into my refrigerator (even if I could lift it that high!) This was one time I was grateful for our "cool" Minnesota autumns... And the results were well worth the effort. Bar none, the best turkey ever; my weekend guests even asked to take leftovers home after day three!

I am a long-time convert to brining, and this turkey made me recall why. The meat was incredibly moist and flavorful...in fact, a dinner guest who is also a food critic pronounced it "succulent." It was in no way too salty, probably because I had rinsed it thoroughly after brining and then let it air-dry in the fridge for a few hours prior to roasting. If anything, the gravy (even with some pan drippings added) actually needed some salt. Delicious even on reheating. Try serving it with the sweet potato & turnip gratin on this site.....truly decadent!

We used an Albertson's-brand frozen turkey that wasn't "self-basting", so I was concerned at first that it would be dry, but the meat was flavorful and moist and not too salty (I followed the suggestions to thoroughly rinse the bird after brining).

I have not yet tried this recipe but I felt I had to respond to the plastic trash bag debate. Some years ago I worked in the front office of a plastic bag factory. I hated to go back in the plant where the bags were being made because it was so dirty. I'm not suggesting that all plastic bag factories are filthy, but this one was. If you must use a plastic trash bag, I would strongly suggest that you rinse it out well first. Even if the brine kills the germs I would rather start with a clean bag.

Brining works! Those who have done it know this, those that haven't would be blown away by its results. Home Depot has a $5, 5 gallon plastic bucket called a "Homer" bucket. This works great for birds up to 16lbs ( I haven't gone any larger ). Stuff the bird with aromatics ( onions, herbs, apples, etc ). Coat with canola oil and roast 1/2 hour at 500. Cover the breast meat with aluminum foil and throw it back into the oven at 350 until deepest part of breast registers 161. The meat will practically fall off of the bone and be incredibly moist.

My son & I have prepared this for the last 3 Thanksgivings, or any time we want a turkey. We usually buy a smaller 12 lb. tukey and brine it in my huge stockpot. We rinse and let the Turkey sit in fridge for a few hours before roasting time. People rave about it. I love the fact that I don't have to baste. We have a lucky family. My 16 year son and I cook and my husband does dishes.

To Debbie Allen on 12/02: You CAN use plasic garbage bags, they are clean, and the brine should kill any micro-organisms found in them. I have used this method to brine and/or marinate various cuts of meat and fish for roasting, smoking and grilling for years. I do, however, use a double bag to prevent leaks in my refrigerator. This is actually an excellent method, as it allows one to expel all the air so that the piece is completely submerged. Never use an aluminum pot or bag (even if it is lined with plastic...they can leak) as the brine will corrode and leach aluminum into the food.

For years I have used gravy out of a jar as even the supermarket did a better job than my tasteless gravy, Well,no more. The gravy was easy...and delicious. Didn't have time to brine this year (took the bird out of the freezer Wednesday) But this recipe is downloaded and ready for next year. I rely on reviews here when I try new things,thanks for your time and input. It makes this enthusuastic homecook much more adventurous.

While this turkey was OK, I felt it was bland compared to other regular roasted one's that I've made in the past, and will not make again, unless perhaps I'm BBQing instead of cooking in the oven. The gravy was delicious, however.

A question: I have brined and smoked turkeys for years. I have always soaked them in a ceramic sink in my laundry room. Soaking them in a large garbage bag would certainly be easier, but is it safe to soak in a plastic that was certainly never meant to be used for food prep. The brine is strong: I ruined an antique crock the first time I tried to soak in it.

I've made turkey with this brine 3 times...in the oven with basting, with an oven bag (one lazy season), and now with the turkey fryer. All three were very juicy. With the fryer method, we took 2 cups of the brine, added 8 TBSP of butter and heated it up to a boil. Then, after cooling the marinade a bit, we injected it all over the bird before frying. This turned out to be the juiciest bird ever! As we were cutting up the bird, we collected the juices and threw them into the gravy (since frying usually doesn't create pan juices). Dee-lish!

This recipe is fantastic. I prepared the brine just as suggested and used kosher salt. I also added rosemary and sage to the brine solution and soaked it for the full 18 hours. I filled the cavity with an orange (rind and all) and more sage, rosemary and thyme. Then I placed it on our BBQ and spit smoked it at about 300 degrees for about 30 minutes per pound. I used apple chips for smoking and had apple cider in a can to add flavor. It was not too salty but be sure to use low salt chicken broth when you make the dish. Great dish! We are going to use this next year also. All of our turkeys will be brined in the future. The Gravy was also awesome and perfect for a great thanksgiving dinner. Friends are already asking if they can come over next year.

I brined the turkey, 11 lbs. per instructions, then smoked it in a smoker. It was delicious, moist and flavorful, especially the breast meat which we usually don't eat, but toss out. I like the flavor of smoked turkey, but it does rule out good gravy. Brining is the way to go with turkey, I rinsed it and patted dry before putting in the smoker and it wasn't salty at all.

I feel like a loner but this recipe was not all it's cracked up to be. Was expecting great results after all the reviews, but this was NO WAY a "dish beyond compare" . It turned out ok, but I won't be repeating this next year. Very bland in the flavor department and not as moist as expected. I'm sure leftovers will make a great sandwich slathered with Hellmans and layered between 2 slices of moist white bread!

This is the third time we've used this recipe, and it's now our Thanksgiving traditional favorite. We do not rinse the brine off but drain it well; it has not been too salty for us. We find it easy to use a plastic storage container, lined with a heavy duty leaf bag into which we place the turkey and brine. We snug the bag up so the entire turkey is covered with brine and put a plastic tie strip tightly around it. Then we tuck the rest of the bag into the container, put the container cover on and, if it's between 33-40 degrees outside, it's placed into our shed. This year was too cold but the attic was exactly 40 degrees. Too warm outside means our second refrigerator gets emptied out, a real pain.

Since this got such rave reviews, I made it for Thanksgiving...the first Thanksgiving Dinner I've cooked since I've had children. Let me tell you..it's the best turkey I've ever had. OUT with the dry stuff. This is moist and DELICIOUS! To be honest, I never knew turkey could taste this good. I brined in a stock-pot. No bags. Cooked at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours then on 300 degrees for 4 1/2 more hours with a tent of aluminum foil on it. Used dried thyme and added apples and celery to the cavity along with the other things. I will not cook a turkey any other way from now on! My 5 year old daughter said her favorite part of the whole dinner was the turkey and gravy. Need I say more?

This is a great recipe for a first-timer. It worked well for me for my first dinner... and as for the poster's question below, no, don't include the giblets and neck in the brining process. Keep it separate. That way you can even start the gravy process while the bird brines.

First Thanksgiving question and am making the turkey from this recipe b/c of all the rave reviews. Question though: do you brine the giblets and neck along with the rest of the turkey or keep them separate during the brining process. Any help is appreciated...thanks

I say do NOT rinse the bird after brining, but do wipe it dry completey with towels before roasting. I also prefer the 2-temperature method of roasting (first high for 30 minutes, then low and slow) to ensure a deep brown color. I am also a proponent of trussing to make a more uniform shape to help it cook evenly. It may not look as "traditional" on the serving platter, but taste is more important. Happy Thanksgiving.

Be prepared to host Turkeyday every year if you make this recipe. This is the best turkey I've every cooked. I wanted to try a different recipe but my family revolted, demanding the brine bird again.

I have been brining my turkey for the last 4 years and every year more people show up at my house! And guess what, you CAN stuff the bird, just don't use salt and if you use butter make it the unsalted kind. Also, rinse the bird well after brining. One thing to watch is the cooking time, the brine cooks the turkey so your turkey will take less time to cook, just keep watch on the temperature.

this is the most tender and flavorfull turkey ever!! another small tip, after you take the turkey out of the brine, put it on a platter or pan and then in the refridgerater over night. Then the flavors distribute all the way through the turkey, not so salty.

In response to the reviewer below: A brined turkey should not taste salty if you rinse it out thoroughly afterwards. Perhaps this recipe should state that more blatantly. Instead it says to "drain well". If you want to try brining again, remember to rinse well. It should be moist and delicious, not overly salty.

To make a long story short. Company gave employees free turkey. Surfed net for brined turkey recipe. Found this one. Easy enough for a man to try. Roasted turkey. I even deboned the turkey. Brought it over to grandma's house. Wife was sick, so we had to go home and couldn't enjoy seeing everyone rave about it. But, a cousin asked several weeks later if whether I had brought the turkey. I said "yes, I made it". She said, "you brought the turkey right?" I said, "I made it". She said, "you didn't buy it?" I said, "no, I made it!" Enough said about this recipe.

This recipe is faboulous and I make it every Thanksgiving. Just a tip though, plastic garbage bags are not graded for food use, and some contain pesticides to prevent bug infestation. An ice chest works well, or an un-dyed 5 gallon bucket (food-grade) from home depot.

Terrific. I've brined turkeys before, but I liked the honey variation. My 30 cuft fridge is always full, so I put the turkey and brine in a compactor bag, added ice and put it in an ice chest. Worked great. The turkey was still ice cold 12 hours later. I used a Nesco roaster for the turkey and thus could baste with the turkey juices. I also used the de-greased pan juices and broth in the gravy.

I used a different brining formula for this--one that I got out of the most recent edition of Cook's Magazine. There wasn't too much variation. I used more salt-specifically Diamond Crystal Kosher-and sugar rather than honey. In any case, it was delicious. I am sold on brining. The gravy was quite good, despite reservations I had about not using the drippings...I used homemade chicken stock, and with what I had left over I used to moisten the stuffing and baste the bird. It worked out quite well, and tasted great.

I have been successful with turkeys in the past, but this was my first try at brining. Wow! I really was not expecting it to be so good. Everyone loved it, and the breast meat was moist and yummy. I did a 20 pound turkey, and surprisingly had few leftovers. I substituted the cup of honey with 2 cups of brown sugar, and seasoned the bird with additional chopped herbs (thyme, rosemary, marjoram, pepper), before roasting it. It's always exciting to experience success with a new technique.

Best turkey I've ever had. I've done this recipe twice, and second time was better than the first. Second time around I preheated oven at 500F then turned down temp to 350F as soon as I put turkey in the oven. I only basted the bird every 60 minutes with simmering water(rather than chicken stock). First time I made the mistake of using canned stock at room temp and the 9lb turkey took 3 1/2hrs to cook! Instead of a lemon in the cavity I used a sliced apple, sliced onion, cinnamon stick, rosemary sprig and sage leaves (family preferred this to the lemon).

Having been inspired by all the rave reviews of this recipe, I've decided to make this recipe for Christmas dinner. My one question though is what type of salt to use? Other brined turkey recipes call for Kosher, yet this recipe only calls for coarse salt. Do you use Kosher or sea salt? Thanks.

The turkey was awesome! The brining is worth doing and it's not very hard. I used a heavy duty contractor's garbage bag to hold the brining liquid and turkey. I then placed the bag in my tall, cleaned laundry basket and placed it overnight in the cold garage. The brining process infuses the turkey with a flavor that is subtly nice. The gravy is the best I've ever made, velvety and rich.

I was a bit skeptical about the brining process, but, even for someone like me who rarely makes a turkey, this recipe is easy; and the results were fantastic. The gravy is wonderful, and the quantity it makes will satisfy a crowd! The gravy is very thin, and I used three times the amount of flour to thicken it to my family's preference. I used an Amish turkey and I'm not sure how much to attribute the wonderful results to that, but this was the best turkey I've ever had. Even my mother, who is the best (or worst?) critic of my cooking, thought the white meat was juicier than with "more normal" cooking methods, and we also got great reviews from relatives who stopped by for leftovers the next day. The refrigeration suggestions are appreciated. That was a bit of a challenge.

Glad to see so many successful Thanksgiving reviews since printing out this recipe just before the holiday. Like many others, we and our twelve guests found this to be the most exceptional bird. Brined it in a plastic bag, and left it overnight inside a cooler with ice packs, which was the perfect solution at a time when refrigerator space is such a hot commodity. Although the recipe recommends against it, like one other reviewer, I stuffed the turkey and it turned out just great. (However, just to be on the safe side, I omitted any salt from the stuffing recipe, and used low-salt chicken broth to moisten it). The end result was a fantastic turkey with stuffing that wasn't the least bit salty. This will become our standard Thanksgiving fare.

I prepared this turkey for the Thanksgiving holiday. All I can say is it was a big hit!! Everyone at the dinner table raved about how delicious and tender the breast meat was and EVERYONE ate seconds! The gravy was wonderful as well, except I did not choose to cook or use the heart or giblets--only the turkey neck. My mother-in-law had sworn off turkey breast from many years of dried out meat, but she, in particular, was amazed at the moistness and flavor! Definitely a winner and one that I will prepare for many years to come. One other thing: due to the honey in the brine, my turkey browned quickly and I found I needed to tent the bird after the first 30 minutes of roasting. Also, I will substitute fresh sage next time and add 1 halved onion along with the fresh lemon juice in the turkey's cavity.

I used to really hate turkey -- I mean, it was fine on a sandwich, but a roasted turkey on a holiday was the last thing that made me feel "thankful." For years, I served alternative meats -- luxury seafoods, leg of lamb, ostrich -- as these seemed a great deal more festive than a big flavorless turkey. I have now been converted -- honey brining converts a piece of meat I used to hate to one that I like so much that I made my first one for Thanksgiving, my second one for Xmas and my third just last week because you shouldn't need a special occasion to make something this good. HINT: If you heat the water to dissolve the honey and salt, use a half volume of water and bring it up to volume with ice cubes. I don't think dangerous bacteria can live in water that salty, but it doesn't hurt to be careful. Enjoy!

I definitely agree with the cook from Chicago. Martha's turkey l0l has it all over this one. I've made many turkey's and find that if you cook a bird breast side down it will be incredibly juicy and tender. I didn't like what the brining process did to the meat. It changed the entire texture. Instead of the meat being flaky it looked cured and like processed meat. Also, we found the gravy to be much too sweet! The carrots and onions sugared the stock way too much!

I made this for Christmas eve based on the reviews. I thought it was good but not the best turkey ever. I don't know what the honey or garlic does since it didn't seem to flavor the turkey at all. I think I liked Martha Stewart's turkey 101 the best. I made the gravy last year with the Martha Stewart turkey and it had a slight white wine taste which I liked.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was fantastic. It's the first time I have really enjoyed leftover turkey, especially the white meat. I used a 15 lb. turkey and followed the instructions to the letter. This is the 1st time I have ever made gravy from "scratch" and it was delicious. It does brown quickly because of the honey glaze, so be prepared to put that foil tent on early.

A good way to prepare Turkey. From the raves I got I think this one just became a family tradition!

I made this for Christmas dinner, and everyone loved it. The gravy was especially wonderful. I used the pan drippings in store bought stuffing mix, and not only was it super easy, but everyone raved about that, too.

This turkey was definitely something special. Instead of roasting it in a conventional oven, I roasted it in my kamado (smoker). Wow!!! It took a lot longer than the recipe specified, but that was because we had a bit of trouble regulating the temperature of the kamado. Running between 300 and 350 degrees, it took over 6 hours! Of course, it was definitely worth it.

we served this turkey for christmas dinner. it was a promo turkey at .19 per pound, 12.5 lbs. i bought the bird to cut up for ground meat. but, instead, decided to cook it for our holiday main course. it was wonderful! we followed all of the instructions to the letter. bird was very moist and flavorful. gravy was excellent too. (i always brine all poultry for tender results but have never added honey or herbs before.)

I only used the gravy portion of the recipe. [I always make my turkey sealed in foil in a 475 degree oven and it cooks quickly.] This gravy is the best I've ever tasted.

I'm trying this for the first time tomorrow. Here's a tip to make the mechanics of the brining process easier: Dissolve the coarse salt and honey in water in a large pot over very *very* low heat. Put the rinsed turkey in a large heavy-duty plastic bag in your largest stockpot, and sprinkle the rest of the brining ingredients over the turkey. Pour the brine over the turkey--if your stockpot is too small to accomodate all the brine, make a stiff cardboard "collar" (as for a souffle) around the top of the pot to support the excess brine in the bag. The recipe sounds fantastic--can't wait to see how it turns out. Happy holidays all!

This was my first attempt at cooking a turkey for Thanksgiving. WOW ... maybe it was beginners luck-- it was the best turkey! It was picture perfect. The brining method definitely results a very moist turkey. I emailed Epicurious ( Julia Child) requesting tips for Roasting a turkey the day before Thanksgiving, I received the following tips- which I incorporated: place 1 sliced onion , juice of 1 lemon, and fresh sage leaves in the cavity of the turkey. Massage turkey with melted butter.

This was my very first time making Thanksgiving dinner, and I came across this recipe. It was such a wonderful dish, I don't think that I will ever look for another Turkey recipe! My Mother in Law commented, "And for all these years, I thought turkey was supposed to be dry!" Very succulent, and delicious, I looked forward to the leftovers!

it was my first turkey but the brine made it come out tasting great... i'm always going to brine my birds from now on

This recipe was simple and fun (my five year old helped me). I didn't make the giblet gravy, but I did use the turkey drippings for my gravy. The result? Gravy beyond compare; the best I have ever tasted. I would echo another cook's caution, though...use low-sodium broth, or perhaps cut the salt in the brine by a cup, because the turkey and gravy, while delicious, were quite salty.

I made this turkey for my in-laws for my first thanksgiving turkey dinner. They loved it and it will be on the table next thanksgiving! The gravy was wonderful, very flavorful. The turkey was done exactly when the recipe said it would. What a change from wondering if the turkey would be done on time.

I was nervous because this year I cooked my first Thankgiving turkey. You always hear horror stories about having to order pizza because the cook burned the turkey, but everything was beautiful and it was SOOO EASY. No one could tell I had never cooked a turkey before.

My boyfriend (an excellent cook in his own regard) made this for Thanksgiving this year. Everyone (I do mean EVERYONE) raved that this was the moistest, tastiest turkey they have ever eaten. I would only caution that using low-sodium chicken stock is a must, otherwise the bird will be too salty.

Wonderful! I tested the recipe out 2 weeks before Thanksgiving and let it sit the full time. The next turkey I brined for 8 hours. I think I prefer the less time. It was perfectly moist! Looking forward to next Thanksgiving already!

Outstanding way to prepare a holiday meal! The morning of the holiday, I managed to get everything else baked and ready since the unstuffed turkey cooked so much faster and didn't tie up the oven. The turkey browned nicely and was juicy and flavorful- just right. This is definately the only way to cook a turkey.

Fabulous!!! The first turkey I have ever made (usually do ducks for holidays) and it went over fantastically...a definite winner...

I served this turkey at a dinner party of 14 and everyone could not believe how moist it was. One friend said he never liked turkey due it's dryness. This is the only one he has ever liked!

I cooked two turkeys this year, one a high priced premium bird and the other the cheapest off brand I could find. I brined the cheap one and smoked both of them in a smoker. The cheaper, brined one was the hands down favorite. The giblet cream gravy was fantastic! I added a can of oysters to it.

i tried this recipe last year and everyone raved about how tender the turkey was. I also stuffed the turkey with my family's apple and sausage bread stuffing. It was great, and I've passed it on to friends. My turkey is brining as we speak.

I made this turkey for 30 people and many of them commented that this was the juiciest turkey they had ever had. I would have to agree, also the gravey was great.

Soaking the turkey overnight really made the meat tender and gave it a great flavor.

Very good! I had never used a brine and was pleased with the results; I will be searching for other brined turkey recipes to try. The gravy also was delicious!

Brining the Turkey is so simple, yet your guests will think you are an expert as the Turkey is so moist and tender when cooked. The giblet gravy was a hit also and the best way to prepare gravy with such salty pan drippings.

I usually don't like salt or the white meat of the turkey. You can throw all of this out the window on this recipe, it was great. I used a 10 pound turkey and cooked it in less than 2 hours on convection roast with a meat probe set to 135 degrees. Highly recommend this recipe, including the giblet gravy.

Served this at Thanksgiving. Truly the best bird any of us have ever had. Our guests stayed for hours, several of whom were caught nibbling on turkey long after the pie had been served. Also works (when scaled down) with turkey breast.

We tried this recipe and were delighted with the results. The turkey had a wonderful flavor and was slightly but not overly salty. The bird was very moist. We definitely plan to try this recipe again.

Fantastic, very moist and flavorful. I soaked the turkey in the brine for 18 hours, next time I will wrap the wings in plastic wrap for part of the time as they got a little salty. The gravy was wonderful.
