Excellent recipe. I substituted dry white wine for water, 3 Tbsp lemon marmalade for jelly, and 1 Tbsp of dijon mustard for balsamic vinegar. My partner loved it!

What a great basic recipe to use as a base!! Of course, like many others, I made some changes due to lack of ingredients or challenges with my man's tastes. I swapped out the jelly for Wegman's cranberry orange chutney, used a bit less balsamic - though I did use 12 year aged - and added some fresh lemon juice. I had already used up my rosemary, so I used poultry herbs instead. I also used organic low fat chicken broth instead of water. Lastly, I had 3 pork chops, and I Quadrupled the sauce ... SO glad I did. After letting the pork rest after the second time in the pan, I was horrified to see it was still faintly pink. (I know that this is "in" right now ... but I can't do it.) I cubed it, and put it back in the sauce. Bonus! That braising liquid just infused the pork. It was still tender AND was full of the flavor. I wouldn't use this as a grill marinade, but as a braising liquid, it rocks.

Easy, quick, and yummy. I didn't have red-currant jelly so I substituted fig jam. Yum.

Excellent dish, have made many many times. Red pepper jelly and red wine instead of water up the flavor, and have added fresh chantrelles which were delicious! Get requests for this dish almost weekly.

Nice sweet complex flavor. I just cooked the pork chops as I usually do and followed the recipe for the onion sauce - so easy and taste delicious. Used apricot jam because that's what I had in the fridge. I think any jam/jelly would work.

This is very onion-y, which I have always thought is a natural with pork. Needs a rice or noodle side to soak up the sauce. Don't know why you need boneless pork, the bone-in is more flavorful; I will use that next time. Recipe is FAST and easy.

Delicious! Looked at other reviews and used maple syrup and water(did not have jelly). It was great and not too sweet. My husband that usually does not like pork loved it!

I just made this for dinner tonight. I am always looking for new pork recipes and this one was appreciated even by a fussy husband. It was nice to have the oven free to cook other things.

Lacking Rosemary, I glanced at the suggestions w/ reviews and decided to go mediterranean. try apricot jam w/ cumin and coriander. also, I swapped the balsamic vinegar for a little red wine vinegar and garlic.

I made this for dinner tonight. Very easy and quite tasty. Like some other reviewers, I was suspicious of rosemary, and used thyme instead. I did not have red currant jelly, and used lemon marmalade. The pork took a bit longer to cook. My chops were ~1.5 inches thick, so after adding them back to the skillet, I cooked covered for about 5 min, then uncovered and cooked ~ 5 min more. Overall a good quick dinner with brown rice and green beans.

I diced the onion and added 1 diced granny smith apple. Increases balsamic to 3 tbsp. I skipped the water and glazed the chops with maple syrup. Delicious! Will make again.

Took a little while finding the red currant jelly (black more prevalent). But worth it, I'd say I'll make it again but there are to many recipes on this site to repeat... Next! PS what is with you rosemary haters?? :o) I used fresh and it rocked.

I agree with a previous reviewer that the sauce was much too sweet. The pork was moist and delicious, but I prefer something with a little more zip. I think next time I might try a mix of orange marmalade and soy sauce rather than red currant jelly and vinegar.

This is an easy, quick recipe. I used guava jelly and lots of fresh cracked pepper, no salt or thyme. The pork was moist and flavorful.

This recipe has been a household staple of mine since it was first published in 1994 - it's hard to find good recipes that only serve 2! I don't like rosemary so I have always substituted thyme, and I use only half the jelly. Also, I tend to reduce the onion mixture a bit before I put the chops back in so I can cook them with the lid on - this helps to preserve their moisture, as boneless loin chops are notoriously dry. It is most delicious served with mashed potatoes, but if I'm really pressed for time I use buttered egg noodles.

This was quick and easy and I had all the ingredients on hand. I made with red skin mashed potatoes.

A wonderful, easy recipe even, or especially, with modifications. I don't like rosemary so used thyme. I only had white balsamic the first time I made this and actually liked it better. It is very well worth it to saute the onion (I used half white and half red) slowly a long time. The sauce was so good I made it later to pour over sauteed mixed vegetables. Wonderful!

Way too sweet. I have made this dish twice using water and using chicken broth as suggested. I have also used apple cider jelly and pepper jelly. If I made this again I would eliminate the jelly and allow the onions and balsamic to reduce and make a sauce. The pork loin with mustard sauce on this site is MUCH better.

Wow, what a great recipe. Very simple and quick but oh so good. I made as written for 3 small boneless chops. If I were making any more chops I would make more marmalade. The sauce was delicious. I will make again for sure.

Quick and easy. Nice on top of the stove meal when you don't want the oven going. Seems you can easily substitute for the currant jelly and rosemary, called for in the recipe. I did think it was slightly on the overly sweet side. I had used apple cinnamon jelly, don't think that was the problem, but maybe. Also, instead of water I used chicken broth.

Solid and easy. Wasn't sure what to expect with red currant jelly, but the flavor was very nice. Served with gingered sweet potato puree from this site.

I made this when it first came out in the magazine. Since I don't like rosemary, I used thyme instead. I fell so madly in love with this dish the first night I actually licked out the cold pan that had some of the juices still sticking to it, and I've never changed my mind about this recipe since then. It is so fast,easy and delicious, especially if you have mashed potatoes with it.

Because I like spicy, I replace the jelly with roasted raspberry chipotle sauce. Because of the sweetness it put me in the mind of asian so I served it with some "doctored" oriental-flavored Ramen noodles. It was also a very quick meal. It was a huge hit. I will definitely make it again.

I used ginger perserves to replace the jam and the flavor was excellent. The meat was perfectly juicy and tender. Plus, it is an easy, quick recipe for busy cooks.

Thought I would love this. It was fine, but not great. Would not make it for friends. Used apricot jelly instead of red currant, nice flavor. I will probably make it from time to time, just for something different.

It was a pleasant recipe but nothing to write home about. I wouldn't make it again.

Well! I used orange marmalade & fresh rosemary. I'm thinking that it's not the kind of jam, but the sweetness versus the vinegar. It was quick, easy & good company fare. However! I would suggest that one looks at the year of the recipe & considers the lean pork of today. Mine borderlined dry just because I didn't do that. Pork today is so lean, it requires about 1/2 of the cooking time to be juicy. Remember--pork at 140 degrees is above the danger point!

Who would think a recipe so simple could taste so delicious. I made it just according to the recipe and we really enjoyed it. Yes, I would make this again.

Both my Husband and I loved this dish, even made it for guests who liked it. I used red onions which it made the marmalade even sweeter! It did take longer than the recipe said. Definitely a keeper.

Was quick and easy to prepare. The pork chop was very moist and tender but the sauce wasn't as yummy as I thought it would be. My husband however, absolutely loved it even thought he says he doesn't like pork chops. It's a 2.5 forker!

I followed this recipe to the tee. I even bought red current jelly for it and I used my expensive old balsamic vinegar. It came out "looking" wonderful with the carmelized onion browning the chops beautifully, but alas... it was tasteless. I would be open to suggestions as to how to add flavor to this dish, and I'll try it again.

Instead of using red currant jelly, I tried roasted garlic and onion jam that I had purchased at a country fair. This dish was delicious. My only complaint was that the recipe took longer to prepare than it said it would. However, it was worth the wait.

Very tasty! Easy prep and cook, worked well with changes (strawberry jelly, thyme). I put it over rice, which soaked up the onion marmalade beautifully!

I made this with a very few changes and thought it was just terrific. Thyme worked great instead of rosemary; strawberry jam was perfect as well. Hard to imagine something much easier and more delicious for a skillet pork chop recipe.

A wonderful flavored recipe, I used fresh rosemary instead of dried. The onion marmalade was very good.

I used dried thyme instead of rosemary (making sure to rub the spices into the meat) and substituted Gauva jelly. I also reduced the cooking time just slightly. The loin chops came out perfectly white with just the slightest blush. The reduced cooking time left the loin in quite a bit of liquid. That may have helped prevent drying out. Good recipe, very simple and quick to make.

I would make this dish again because it is easy. I used home-made grape jelly as another reviewer suggested and it worked fine. In fact, I thought the onion marmalade was great but I thought the pork was lacking. I might use a little more salt and pepper next time and actually rub it, and the rosemary, into the pork for more flavor. Very simple and my husband enjoyed it. I served with braised fennel bulbs with a little lemon and garlic and parmesean cheese on top.
