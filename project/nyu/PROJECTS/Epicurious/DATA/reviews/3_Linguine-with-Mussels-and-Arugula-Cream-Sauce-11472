Being somewhat of a mussels virgin, I wasn't sure this would have enough heft and flavor--have always made mussels with white wine, garlic and herbs which give a big mouthful. This was rich and delicate--and very yummy. I used half-and-half instead of cream, shallots instead of onions (just because that's what I had on hand). Next time I'll add more arugula (spinach might work, too, or watercress)and count on the addition of some parmesan, which we grated to taste at the table. Would also be good wtih seared scallops added before serving.
