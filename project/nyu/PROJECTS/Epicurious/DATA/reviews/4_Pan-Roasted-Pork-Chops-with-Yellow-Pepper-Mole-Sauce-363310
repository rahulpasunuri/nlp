I have never made mole before, but had yellow peppers from my garden. Made the mole the day before--and it was time consuming--especially the tedious but necessary task of straining. But it was definitely worth it. A wonderful depth and complexity to the sauce. Complemented the pork perfectly. Served with warmed corn tortillas and a fresh pico de gallo. Wow. A memorable meal.

One of the best Mole Sauces I have ever cooked, and i have cooked a lot of them. 1 suggestion, i cooked this with Lamb chops instead of pork chops and i thought it complemented the meat well.
