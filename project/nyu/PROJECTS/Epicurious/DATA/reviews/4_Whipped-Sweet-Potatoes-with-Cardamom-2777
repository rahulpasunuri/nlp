I made this according to directions except halved the amount of butter. I made it a day in advance to the casserole stage. Re-heated it covered in foil then removed foil and added a pecan/brown sugar streusel topping at the last 15 minutes of baking to give it a textural interest. Excellent, not too sweet and very easy!

One more thing: I didn't have 45 minutes for the last part, I just put them into the oven until they were warm. It was fine! Next time I'll try the 45 min to see how it comes out.

So easy! I love that this recipe doesn't have sugar. I halved the recipe. I only had an hour to roast the potatoes, and didn't have whipping cream, and it still came out great! I liked the skins in the mash. Will definitely make this again! It was a great side with roast chicken.

I thought this was terrific...the cardamon gave it such an unusual flavor without being overpowering. I agree with a previous reviewer that less butter could be used without compromising the taste and I'm going to try that next time. This is a keeper!

I skipped the casserole step - just whipped the potatoes with the electric mixer and took the bowl straight to the dinner table. Replaced cardamom and nutmeg with pumpkin pie spice, and added some more salt. It was silky and yum-yum with turkey meatloaf!

Just wonderful. No sugar or syrup, but tastes deliciously sweet, like sweet potato pie. My baby boy also loved it.

Great and SO easy! I used half the butter and they were great.

The prep couldn't be easier and the potatoes couldn't be tastier. A nice change from brown sugar and maple sweetened versions.

This was so Yum! I made half the recipe because I had five people for dinner. I should have made the whole recipe because we wanted more for leftovers. I loved that you can make it ahead of time. I passed it along on a recipe exchange a couple of days later. I WILL make it again.

Just superb! For a more pure Cardamom flavor, use cardamom seed, (pods removed), cracked or lightly whizzed in a coffee grinder (I keep around for spices only.) The cardamom seed has a much better flavor than the powdered cardamom from the grocery store. Tip for buying cardamom - DO NOT buy it at a grocery store where it is ridiculously expensive. Buy it at an Indian foods store - it is fantastically inexpensive - like 8 ounces for $5.00. in- or-out of the pod.

The dish itself is good, but I modified it by putting a layer of melted butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and apples on the bottom of the dish first. The potatoes are very creamy, and I like the balance of the fruit on the bottom.

Ditto to the cook from Hoffman Estates.I did prepare the casserole ahead and freeze it for a week or two. Thawed , then proceeded with the baking.

The silkiest, fluffiest-textured sweet potatoes EVER. They just melt in your mouth. The cardamom really compliments the flavor.

Made this last night to go with meatloaf. Unbelievable. Easy, easy, easy and delicious. I only used 4 potatoes, 2 tbsp. butter and 1/4 cup cream. Didn't heat the cream or butter. Skipped the spices (for the kids) and added salt. The slow roasting of the potatoes makes this dish and they practically peel themselves after 90 minutes in the oven. This recipe is a real winner.

Great prepare ahead dish - not overly sweet, but very creamy! I added some Cointreau, which I would definitely recommend.

I've been downloading recipies from the epicurious site for three years, but this recipie far more than any other has been made repeatedly. I have made it for any number of occasions and it has made sweet potato lovers out of even the most skeptical of diners. It is pure heaven. People call me to invite me to pot-lucks and specifically ask me to bring this dish. I have learned to bring a copy of the recipie with me because someone always wants it. In fact, this recipie alone has turned several of my friends on to the epicurious site. No need to change a thing, it's simply divine!

Don't get me wrong--this isn't a bad dish per se. But *everyone* at Christmas dinner said, "Why didn't you just do regular mashed potatoes?"

These potatoes were wonderfully sweet without sugar and creamy at the same time! I made them with light butter & fat free half & half -- because of dietary reasons & they were perfect! I'll never have to make sweet potatoes again with brown sugar & marshmallows!

Definitely awesome! I have to admit to a bit of "hmmm, maybe" when I first read the recipe, but, having eaten it, its definitely a keeper. Even my nephew, who does not like sweet potatoes, had not only some, but had a second helping.

Awesome combination! I used milk instead of cream, still tastes great. A favorite during the winter holidays.

This was very nice. I've struggled to find a way to fix sweet potatoes where the recipe doesn't call for cups of sugar or maple syrup. This recipe really lets the natural sweetness of the potato shine. I am definitely planning to make it for Thanksgiving.

I can't stand sweet potatoes, but I LOVE this dish! They were perfect - rich, sweet, salty and creamy. I've made it for company twice now, both time with rave reviews. One word of advice, make sure the potatoes are still quite hot when you begin mixing with cream and butter. It makes for a creamier end result.

This is the best tasting, simplest side dish I have ever made. Every holiday season, everyone is always asking me if I will be making "my sweet potatoes".
