One of the most incredible recipes I've ever tried and super easy to make! I used boneless skinless thighs so I skipped the skillet and threw them in with the potatoes after 10 mins (total time baked together was 30 mins, potatoes took 40 mins total). I find the thing about kimchi is, the longer it sits, the spicier it gets and I love spice. I used fresh kimchi, which wasn't spicy, so I had to add cajun seasoning to the thighs and also used chile garlic sauce. The kimchi gives everything the amazing flavor, totally unexpected. I would suggest seasoning the chicken and potatoes a bit more. Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

I made exactly as the recipe,was written. There was nothing special in the favors. You could just as well serve potatoes,a side of kimchi and chicken. Also, browsing the chicken with the garlic rub burns the garlic.

Kimchi is delicious cold or at room temperature. It's a natural probiotic and a raw living food. By roasting, it's killing most of the "good stuff" in the kimchi. I would suggest letting the kimchi come to room temperature then topping your potatoes and serving (skip the 5 minutes of roasting). You will get the same effect but it will be much more healthy.
