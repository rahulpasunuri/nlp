This cake is lovely! I don't know what people are talking about with it being too sweet. I used the exact measurements (1 lb of rhubarb and 1 cup of light brown sugar) and it turned out perfectly. I bought my rhubarb from the farmer's market, so it wasn't hothouse grown, which can be sweeter than the rhubarb grown outdoors. Make sure to check where your rhubarb comes from if you are concerned about its tartness. It also seems that most people who made this recipe and then complained about its sweet cakey-ness really just wanted to make rhubarb pie, but were too lazy to make the pie crust. To be fair, it does seem like the cake in the picture shows double the amount of rhubarb, as mine was mostly cake with a stripe of rhubarb in the center. It would be easy to increase the rhubarb.

Even teenagers love this cake. I must confess to doubling the rhubarb. I have made 3 in as many weeks. My rhubarb plants have to recover now!

I will not make this again. Everything was measured accurately and yes, I used the cake flour, but it was dry and bland. It could have used at least double the rhubarb. I'd much rather make a pie next time. Whiskey cream was good though!

Love this recipe, but I cut down the sugar by at least a third, and double the fruit. also used one cup of fresh raspberries as part of the fruit. Made 1 and 1/2x recipe in a larger baking dish but it took 45 minutes to brown nicely.

Fabulous cake! This dough reminds me of a butter dough that my mother used to make for plum cake. Made as written except used a mixer for the dough (no problems, blended beautifully) and added a cup of strawberries to the rhubarb. I've always hated making pastry, so think I may have found the perfect solution! I'm sure this recipe would be excellent with a variety of different fruit fillings.

Quite delicioous! Used a total of 4 cups rhubarb and strawberries and cut sugar back to 2/3 cup. Used a mixer with no ill effects - hate taking the time to blend in with finger tips. I just pushed the dough flat with a spatula. It was a little difficult to get coverage. Probably won't butter pan next time.

This cake got rave reviews. I baked it exactly as called for in the recipe. Didn't make the whiskey whipped cream but will try it next time.

after reading the reviews i was excited to make this cake. however, the results disappointed. if i baked this again, i would definitely add more rhubarb, as many others suggested. i found the cake itself to be too sweet and will just make rhubarb pie in the future.

This is fabulous! If you spray your hands with olive oil spray or nonstick spray, the dough is not difficult to work with. Doubled the rhubarb--not the sugar. Didn't make the cream, but served with some solid vanilla ice cream. Yummo! May try again with apples and blackberries.

If you are looking for a reason to blow your diet, pick this! My only regret is I baked it for just my husband and myself! I could have cut it in half and we would have both happily skipped dinner! My husband declared that this is the "best pie crust" he has ever had. I was so intent on buying the rhubarb that I neglected to see that my white flour was low and I didn't even have cake flour. I ended up adding cornmeal for the missing 1/4 cup of flour. It really gave it a nice texture. I might do that intentionally next time, too. Also used the non fat milk and salted butter on hand. I guess I love to bake so mixing up the dough was much easier to me and less of a messand less time consuming than making a pie crust, waiting for the pie crust to chill and rolling it out, etc. I also put the dough in blobs around the dish before I floured my hands to press it into place. The blobs of dough on top of the crust gave it the look of a rustic lattice. I only used 1 TBSP of raw sugar to the top since it was already loaded on the inside. My overall opinion was that it was a very rich dessert rather than sweet. I did not make the whipped cream but did try a spurt out of a can - sacreligious, I know! I would do with out next time altogether. I can see myself trying this crust with every other fruit "pie" I make! It was just really, really delicious!

Excellent recipe. I, too, used less sugar because I like my rhubarb tart. The dough was a little messy to deal with but so light and tasty - definitely worth it. The only thing I would do differently is add a bit of thickener as someone else mentioned because it's very juicy.

Very good. I doubled the amount of rhubarb. Nice sweet/tart balance. I will be making this again!

I have made this twice in the past week. I added a generous tablespoon of fresh minced ginger to the rhubarb. The two flavours work really well together. Have been asked for the recipe by everyone who tried it.

It was everything I hoped for. The crust is like a sugar cookie and the rhubarb filling is tangy. I'm glad I read the previous reviews because I cut the sugar in half and it's perfect. Nice warmed with vanilla ice cream, too.

This is delicious! Next time I make it I'll leave it in for the full 40 minutes, as it was a tad underdone for my taste at 35 minutes. The sweetness for me was perfect, and even my non-dessert loving husband was surprised at how nice it is! The cake is great on its own; whipped cream is optional to me.

Easy to make, quick and tasty rhubarb recipe! I followed the recipe but added a little orange zest to the dough and a little vanilla to the fruit. Fruit turned out to be a little runny, so may add a little cornstarch next time. The sugar on the dough gave it a nice crust. Wish I would have saved more for the top, instead of having such a thick layer on bottom. Everyone loved it.

I also doubled the rhubarb and kept the sugar at the same amount. This was simple and delicious. I served it with vanilla frozen yogurt and it was perfect.

Yummy! I used about 4 C rhubarb and cut back the brown sugar to about 3/4 C. It was plenty sweet for me. Also, used AP flour instead of cake. Turned out great--a delicious way to use this spring vegetable!

Outstanding flavour, well worth the effort to make it. Guests inhaled it. Jamieson 12-y-old was the whiskey of choice for the cream, although more than a tablespoon disappeared during the course of the evening!

This recipe was a huge hit. I doubled the entire recipe but kept only one cup brown sugar in the rhubarb. It was lovely because it wasn't too sweet. I waited too long to serve it though (3 hours) -- it would be better served after 1/2 hour like recipe says. I'm going to try it this summer with peaches.

I liked the biscuit layers. But the rhubarb layer was way way too sweet for me. I had almost doubled the rhubarb while holding the sugar the same and still thought it was sweet. One good thing though: the rhubarb layer is simple to do (just mix with the brown sugar) and it is not weepy as in some rhubarb desserts. I think next time I would try it with white sugar and cut back on the amount.

I definite agree with the folks who said to use more rhubarb! I used 6 generous cups and 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar. Personally I think it could even use more, but I'll change pans next time. This one bubbled over the edge of the 10" pie pan near the end of baking. A deeper pan and more rhubarb would be perfect. I prefer the parts where the "crust" is thinner, so I'll pat it out quite thin on the bottom next time, and use scant tablespoons for the topping spots. I'll also put less near the edge, to avoid the thick cakey section that appeared there. Flavor wise, and for ease of prep--I wouldn't change a thing.

Add this high on an already-long list of rhubarb favorites! Doubled the rhubarb, left sugar the same, plenty sweet. Used the 'two-spoon technique' transfer batter in dabs, way too sticky any other way, I suspect.

Terrific rhubarb cobbler, except it needs a little salt in the crust. So, I would make that salted butter instead of unsalted. Since I love cobblers that are heavy on the fruit, I doubled the amount of rhubarb (6 cups) and added an extra half-cup of light brown sugar. Excellent with vanilla ice cream!

This was a really quick 'rhubarb cobbler' - not really a cake....it was delicious - I used 1% fat milk instead of whole milk and added 3/4 tsp cinnamon to the sugar topping and instead of the whipped cream topping - served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.....it was really yummy

This recipe is really good. Although when i made it i substituted the whole milk for butter milk and used 1 cup of fresh strawbwerries and 1 cup of rhubarb. I also added about a teaspoon and a half of cinamon to the brown sugar. Also instead of making the cream i served it warm topped with low fat frozen vanilla yogurt. Everyone loved it.

I made this for a St. Pat's dinner. I really like this cake - I can definitely see myself making it with different fruits throughout the year. I did make some changes - I added a pint of blackberries and the juice of 1/2 blookd orange to the rhubarb and the zest of 1/2 a blood orange to the scone dough. I agree with a previous reviewer and didn't try to completely cover the bottom with dough - just used big blobs.

Quick, easy, delicious. Due to emergency, I used half whole wheat flour. Turned out well!

Do you sift the cake flour before or after measuring it?? Thank you.

I made this dessert for a couple of friends and everyone loved it. Although the dough was a bit messy it was still easy to make. (especially since I have a pie dough phobia!)Absolutely loved it and I reccomend anyone who likes rhubarb try this cake. I skipped the whisky cream though...the cake was great all by itself.

Next time I'll put the bottom dough in the same way as the top--many small mounds, to make it easier to pat down--it IS messy. Very delicious comfort food. The brown sugar adds a nice caramel taste--we didn't think it was too sweet.

This was very good. I found the dough (batter?) a little messy to work with but it turned out much better looking than it went in. It is definitely a country dish and not elegant; but just what's needed after a long winter. I liked it with the Irish whiskey whipped cream. Surprisingly, I found it to be nowhere as sweet as I had anticipated given the amount of sugars called for. It was a nice finish to the Irish menu in the March Gourmet.

This was not bad and very easy to make - which is the reason I choose the recipe (didn't feel like rolling out a pie crust.) It was very sweet - my husband and I like a little more tart in our rhubarb - so next time I might cut the sugar. Also, it was much better the second day. Even though I prefer a pie, if we're in the mood for rhubarb and I'm feeling lazy again, I'd make it.

Made this on a cold night to serve after Swedish style pork tenderloin and sauteed green beans, and it was perfect! Perhaps because I was raised on rhubarb, it appealed as a fluffy, dressed up comfort food. Yum.
