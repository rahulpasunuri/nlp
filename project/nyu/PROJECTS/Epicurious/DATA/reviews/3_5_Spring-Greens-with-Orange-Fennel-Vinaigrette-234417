I thought this was delicious. I used mild greens, and didn't find any of the flavors over powering as some reviewers. It is very light and refreshing.

I made this with regular oranges and dried thyme. It tasted fine, but the orange and fennel flavors both got lost among the other, more strongly flavored ingredients (mostly onion and honey). If you want a salad that tastes like oranges and fennel, don't bother with this - just make it out of oranges and fennel. :)

Just okay. The dressing was way too oily! I had to add lots more oj and lemon juice to make it edible.

Great, refreshing and interesting salad. Served it for a party and was a hit with many asking what was in it that made it special- the fennel and blood orange. It's a keeper

Lovely salad, I used Tarroco (blood) oranges, skipped the green onions and substituted toasted pecans for the walnuts. Served with butternut squash pasta. Nice combination.

Very nice dressing. Used seedless clementines
