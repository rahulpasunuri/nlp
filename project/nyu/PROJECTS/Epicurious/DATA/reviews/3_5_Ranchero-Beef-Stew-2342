Awesome and not like a typical beef stew. I can't seem to be able to just follow a recipe as they are just guidelines to me. I added fire roasted tomatoes and several Sandia peppers from our garden, as well as some crushed red peper flakes in addition to jalepeno stuffed olives. Topped it off with lime juice and a dollop of sour cream. Will make it for company in a few weeks and will serve with either cheese biscuits or corn muffins/bread.

I was skeptical about the dish but it turned out fantastic, my boyfriend asked me to make a double batch next time!! I made several modifications: I used fire roasted tomatoes instead of stewed, I added a jalapeno, 2 tsp. hot smoked paprika, 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes, and when I stirred in the cilantro I added the juice of half a lime. The result was amazing, it was nicely smokey and rich with the right amount of kick. I served it with fresh cilantro, a lime wedge, and a big dollop of plain greek yogurt on top. I will definitely make this again.

I added sweet potatoes, frozen corn, cumin, chipotle chiles in adobo, cinnamon, unsweetened cocoa, a can of black beans. Also a little red wine. Heavenly.

This is such a nice new twist on the old beef stew. My three children complained when I told them that I was making beef stew. Said all the stuff in stew tasted the same. Thus, I searched for something new. This is delicious....No potatoes...no red wine and the unlikely ingredients make a nice broth.

My family loves this stew. We use it as our favorite taco filling. I serve it with corn tortillas, sour cream and salsa fresca, rice made with lime and cilantro, and corn on the cob. I do not use the olives. It's really tasty!

This was good. I didn't add the cumin others suggested but I think I will next time. It was so simple to throw together that I will probably make again with a few changes.

It was good, not great. I added the Cumin as suggested. It gave it a bit of an Indian taste. I did not halve the oregano when i added the cumin, I am thinking I should have. I added a little cayenne powder, zucchini and some potatoes. The stew meat was a little tough. It would be better in a crock pot, slow cooked. Next time i think i will add fresh peppers instead of canned. I used Mexican stewed tomatoes, i think that give it a conflict with the other spices. Next time i will use regular stewed tomatoes too.

Rating: 3
Very tasty and would definitely make again. I tripled the recipe for company. Next time, I will reduce the amount of liquid by 1/2 as I felt it was too soupy. I didn't use cilantro because a few of our guests don't care for it but I would love to try it next time. Because I enjoy a little "kick" I took one reviewers suggestion and added some cumin. I think that Mexican style stewed tomatoes would add a little more flavor as well. I did mine in the slow cooker on high for 6 hours and it was so incredibly easy. Leftovers were delicious too.

This was very tasty... we did add cumin and some cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit and left out the olives since we are not olive people.. but my kids had seconds.. which is quite rare at our house!

If you want a little more spice to this dish, add hot chilies and be generous. We thought it was a little lacking in spice.

I've lost count of how many times I've made this stew. It is indeed easy and relatively quick. The beauty for me is that I can pretty much put whatever vegetables I have on hand in the stew and it still tastes good. I've used corn, green beans, etc. You could easily add potatoes, but I prefer to make cheesy mashed potatoes and pour the stew on top. Yum. You can also adjust the heat by adding jalapenos, etc. This stew freezes beautifully as well.

Not only is this recipe very tasty, but it doesn't take hours to stew before serving (which is good for me since I'm a last minute planner). The only changes I made was I added diced green pepper and a teaspoon of green olive tapenade since I did not have the olives). I also eliminated the green chilies. I served the stew over egg noodles and it was very good. It is a great week night recipe and I will certainly prepare it again.

Rating: 4
This is a unique receipe, and is very tasty. Add a little corn starch in the end to thicken up the stew. Also there are no potatoes in this stew so if you like potatoes in your stew then this is not for you. I have made it at least 10 times; mostly by request from friends.

Rating: 4
Absolutely outstanding! I used two pounds of stew meat for five people and there was just about two servings left for left-overs. I followed the suggestions of others by adding chipotle chili powder and a tablespoon of dried chipotle and it was just spicy enough for our SO-Calif. clan! My husband was still talking about it as he went to sleep last night.

Yum! We loved this! I left out the cilantro and olives, but took other reviewers' advice and halved the oregano, replacing the missing tablespoon with about a teaspoon+ of cumin. The sour cream is nice, but not 100% necessary. Served this with a green salad and some fresh-made cheddar cheese biscuits. Mmmm, mmm good!

I've made this several times. It reminds of one of my favorite genres of food that's hard to get in Shanghai - the Southwest! I served it to Dad last time he came to visit and he requested it especially for this trip, too. I just made a few changes - leave out olives 'cause I can't find good ones here, add a can of corn, only had one tablespoon of oregano left, so made up for the other tablespoon with Trader Joe's Pasta Seasoning since it at least had oregano in it. This is a recipe that's easy to double if guests are coming over. No dutch oven, just a regular soup pot. In fact I haven't seen a dutch over since moving to Shanghai...

I made this in a slow cooker, without the olives. It was quite good, but the chiles were a little overpowering. The only can I could find in the store was jalapenos- I'll use a milder pepper next time. Also it was a little watery, 1/2-2/3 a cup of broth probably would have been enough.

Rating: 3
I made this stew with black olives instead of green and I think the green olives would probably have been perfect. Although the black olives were really good too. It was very easy to make and even tastier the second day!

Delicious, unique take on beef stew. Thanks for the reviewer who gave tips on browning the meat. Made all the difference. I doubled the garlic, green chilies and added a fresh serrano and some cumin. But we like spice! Good medium consistency at the end. Great with sour cream.

Rating: 3
I just made this two nights ago and it will definitely be a staple in my winter repertoire. I made a double batch and put in a seven ounce can of diced green chilies and a four ounce can of diced jalapeños. Also, I seasoned the meat with Cajun spices rather than salt and pepper. This gave it the perfect amount of heat for me. I didnt find it too watery because I didnt expect it to be a gravy stew. I wouldnt add tomato sauce myself, but it would certainly give it more consistency for those who need it. Also, Im glad I heeded the recommendation to half the oregano. Prep note: I would brown the meat in a fry pan first. It is way too hard to turn meat in a Dutch oven. Then deglaze all the good beef flavor when you sauté the veggies&then finish off in a Dutch oven& or leave it in a big enough fry pan& why do more dishes. Im looking forward to the left overs. Perfect over rice.

I have made this recipe many times and it is always a winner. While it appears simple to make, it is very important to brown the meat correctly or it will become too wet, too dry, and too bland. The oil must be hot and the meat must be placed in batches to prevent the oil from cooling. The meat should be a rich brown when ready and 5 minutes is often not enough. If you see juices from the meat building in the pot the oil is not hot enough. The time to simmer will depend on the size of the meat chunks and the type of meat. Try a piece in an hour, but simmer until tender regardless of time. I do not use Cilantro - don't like it. I generally serve it over a bed of yellow rice.

I made this yesterday and it was delicious! A great change up from "regular" beef stew. Didn't have cilanto which would have added a nice fresh taste, but it was good anyway. I cut the oregano to 1T but did everything else per the recipe. Don't salt the meat or vegies during cooking--the olives and broth will salt everything correctly.

Rating: 4
This was a very interesting change from the "normal" beef stew...I did follow the advice of one reviewer and put in some butternut squash and added some cumin...I also rinsed the olives (they are way too salty otherwise) and because my husband has a sensitive stomach, no chiles...so to give it more depth I added some red wine and served it with some homemade corn bread....my husband could not get enough....will definitely make this a regular in the house.

This was a unique recipe that tasted really good on a cool summer night. I made it in the slowcooker and might have cooked the meat a tad too much but the flavours were nicely blended. No olives in mine. Decided to make cornbread muffins to serve along side and that was the biggest hit.

This is a "no-fork" - it's nasty. I think the 2 T. dried oregano is a misprint as it takes over the recipe. This went in the disposal.

Fabulous! Many layers of flavor, becoming richer day-by-day. I prepared this on Sunday, finished cooking & had first serving on Monday. Today, Wednesday, enjoyed for lunch. I followed the receipe except used 2 lbs. beef and parsley for cilantro. The green peppers were marked "mild" so I had to add a few shakes of Tabasco. Next time I'll buy hot peppers or use 2 cans of green peppers.

2++ forks! I will definately make this again. But it seemed like it was missing something. Next time I will decrease the oregano by half and add some cumin.

This recipe ended up surprising me. When I tasted as this simmered I thought it seemed a two fork recipe. As we ate dinner it grew on me. As others suggested I increased the beef to 1 & 1/2 pounds sirloin, used the full can of beef broth and added a small can of tomato paste to thicken. Also added two jalepeno peppers minced. I think the cilantro and olives were key! We also served with a dallop of low-fat sour cream and crumbled toasted corn doritos over the top. Next time I'll increase jalapenos to four, double the cillantro and maybe add a 1/2 can or so of black beans.

One of my very favorites. I used 1/2 of the oregano this time and a fresh jalapeno. It's defintely worth trying and it's a very easy recipe!

My husband and I loved this dish. I made it just as written only I used a whole can of broth, doubled the meat, and put 2 fresh jalapenos in as we like things spicy! Also put in 3 small red potatoes. The flavors blended so well. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 3
No ordinary stew! I made some changes: I used a can of diced not stewed tomatoes, a beef bouillon cube, a 7-oz. can of chipotle chiles in adobo sauce (which made the stew Very Spicy), no olives, 1 T. oregano ~1/2 T. dried cilantro, plus I put a cubed yam and some mushrooms in. Served over white rice with sour cream. Except for being a bit too hot for me, it was an awesome dish. The yam was a nice counter to the spicy-ness.

Rating: 2
Definitely a nice variation on an old theme. Wasn't sure how the olives would work in this but they added a nice flavor. I found myself looking for them. I made it spicer than the recipe calls for by using fresh jalepenos and instead of the stewed tomatoes, I used hot chunky salsa. It is weird to not have potatoes in stew but we do the no-carb thing and this was relatively low. I did throw in cut up turnips which worked very nicely. I didn't miss the potatoes since the turnips have a *similar* texture. Nice for winter nights.

I followed the recipe exactly except for the addition of one diced russet potato (sorry, beef stew without potato?) and a bit more beef broth. It is really good - I'm sure it will be even better second day! I like the kick of the hot peppers and the added flavor of the olives. Very good!

I am a caterer and this is one of my most requested recipes for fall and winter. It is delicious as written. I don't like to add potatoes to it, as I like the "clean" taste without the thickening that potatoes can add to a stew. However, it is a really versatile recipe and most any vegetable can be added...try chayote squash or even a cooked and cubed butternut added at the last minute.

I made this dish according to the recipe, except that I omitted the olives. It was great! The chilies gave it a nice kick. Be warned, though: this recipe isn't enough for four adults. My husband and I ate it ourselves in one sitting.

I was looking for an unusual beef recipe. This was it!!!!!!!!!!!! A few changes or additions I should say. I love the spice "Cumin" so I added some of it to our taste, a little ancho chili powder to spice it up a little more. Then I had some fresh shucked corn so I tossed that in. A spoon full of sour cream on top when you serve it and this is to die for. Served it over rice with a great red wine. Like most of the dishes like this it was even better left over.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I only did a couple things differently. I added a Southwest Seasoning dry rub to the meat before browning- rather than salt and pepper. Used only 1 Tbsp oregano. Added the whole can of stock, rather than just one cup. I also passed lime wedges at the table to squeeze over the top. Holy Moly!! Was it good!! (It's carb friendly too.)

Rating: 4
We both really liked this recipe. I made the following changes. 1. I used 4 fresh jalepenos instead of the canned chiles. 2. I browned the meat, then put the whole thing in a crockpot and put the insert in the fridge before I went to bed. 3. Pulled out the insert & set the crockpot on low before I went to work. 4. Came home to dinner. Gotta luv crockpots! We served it with tortilla chips on the side. I think next time I'll add some cayenne. To steal a catch phrase - ya gotta kick it up a knotch!

This recipe with a few tweaks (hence the 3 instead of the 4 forks) is delicious! One of the best tomato-based beef stews that I've had ever. I've made it twice - the first time I doubled the recipes, added 2 large-ish potatoes, scaled back on the oregano and added some red savina habanero pepper. That was the 4-fork dish. The olives, cilantro, green chile and oregano flavours blended so well together. The second time I made it I followed the recipe as is and didn't like it as much - I had originally forgotten to add the oregano and it was so lacking in flavour that all I could taste was the tartness of the olives and canned green chiles (which added very little if any heat at all). After adding the oregano, it tasted much better, but not quite as good as the first time I made it. So, I recommend not leaving anything out, but adding less oregano (1-1.5 tbsp vs 2) and if you like a little zing, add some pure ground chile. Mmmmm...

Rating: 3
Excellent! I used a little more than 2 lbs. of meat and still needed only 1 can of broth and 1 of stewed tomatoes. I added a large potato as suggested in other reviews. Flavors of the chiles and olives blend in nicely - not at all overpowering or too hot. I will definitely make this again.

This was my second time making this stew. Great recipe! This time, I used 2-3" pieces of meat and cooked it on a low heat for hours. I also used Kitchen Basics beef stock; it is much better than broth. The oregano is key to balancing the flavors with the olives.

No way this would feed four! Two was pushing it and then it was served with pasta. I really loved the flavor though. It was quite different. I used brine cured olives which were fuller flavored and would increase them next time. I added roasted sweet red peppers and I used fresh jalopenos. It could have used more spice so next time I'll use more. And maybe add some potatoes. Overall it's a keeper.

Great overall taste, I used 4 fresh jalapeno peppers, less seeds, and a table spoon of dried chiplotle chile,could have doubled these and still been delicious and heat tolerable.Added red wine along with beef broth. Added cubed red pototoes which were browned with the onions and beef cubes. For color put in about 2 cups fresh green beans cut into 2" lengths. Finished recipe with grape tomotoes and sliced green onions added to stew about 10 minutes before serving. A dollop of sour cream added richness to the broth amd made a nice presentation.
