Fresh salmon & wild mushrooms are readily available in the Northwest & together they are wonderful. Don't use morels however. They are just too heavy. I made one addition to the recipe. I soaked porcini in the clam broth & this upper the flavor to incredible. My husband took one bite & said, "Mmmm, this is delicious, honey!"

This recipe has been a family favorite since it was published. And by family I mean all of our now 4 adult children who grew up on it!

The salmon is fine, the mushrooms not bad either, but together yuck!

I should have listened to my instincts on this one: mushrooms and salmon is not a good combination. The flavors don't just compete, they fight to the death. However the method for broiling the salmon is great.

Two things I need to point out to some of the reviewers, as well as those of you who will be reading the reviews. 1. "Wild mushroom ragout" does not mean "pick one of those mushrooms". the point is to mix the mushrooms, so that not one flavor is overwhelming...i would definilty agree that ALL morels is overkill, or that ALL chantarelles would be too gentle.... 2. When they say "whipped cream" up there in the recipe, they mean to use "whipping cream", or heavy cream. light cream is USUALLY too well, light for a sauce without adding a thickener.

Went over really well with my date. I actually made the full amount of ragout with only two salmon steaks just because I didn't want to mess around with scaling down the recipe. The extra sauce made the presentation more appealing.

Chanterelles are abundant in our part of the globe at this time of year. Shame on you if you used morels and were dissatified--they are TOTALLY different. You can enhance this recipe by sprinkling on a few chopped hazelnuts and dried cranberries.

I did this recipe as a use for the fresh morel mushrooms available at my local grocer. I think that the sauce is too rich and earthy for fish, even salmon. Next time I will pair my morels with beef or veal.

This was delicious and easy. I could not find clam juice, so substituted a fish boullion cube with water. It was easy and has an elegant presentation. Cannot wait to make this again!

Great -- and the cream comes in here: "Add cream to mushrooms"

Haven't made it yet, but where does the whipped cream come in? Don't see it in the instructions, or I am blind?

I was looking for a recipe for a dish I had in Paris Thursday night at Brasserie Lorraine, and this sounds just like it. It was superb - a wonderful Scottish salmon filet with a morel cream sauce, served with little pillows of pasta stuffed with basil.

Quick and easy. I used chanterelles and didn't think they went too well with the salmon. The mushrooms are fine, though, as a topping for something else, I think.

Delicious, and quite easy. I had to use dried morels, but still quite tasty! We have salmon once a week, and this is by far the best recipe yet!

My wife and I made this for dinner: It was easy to make and delicious. We substituted halibut for the fish thinking that salmon would overwhelm the chanterelle mushrooms we picked up at the farmers market, and I think it was a good move. I'd definitely recommend it.

The sauce is good but seems a bit heavy for salmon.

I added more cream & served this over linguini. I did it this way because I had just 'bits' of salmon left over from the whole fish & wanted to do a pasta dish with it. I'd make it again either the way I did it or the way the recipe says. Really good!

I am a cook who really needs a recipe! Love to cook and usually have great results. I made this just for my husband and I, and we both loved it. I am saving it in my file to fix for dinner guests. It is easy, but also very tasty. I served it with steamed baby red potatoes and creamed new peas. A very nice dinner.

Very tasty and easy to make. The recipe isn't all that creative (I think I could have made this without a recipe), but it's good just the same.
