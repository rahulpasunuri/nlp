I love to have control over the quality of ingredients, but I don't have much time so this recipe was perfect...

Nothing could be easier or more flavorful for a hot summer evening...or anytime. When strawberries are out of season and come packaged at the store, you may need to increase the sugar amounts to taste.

so perfect, simple and pure. Strawberry Heaven and so easy to make. We used a blender and then kept scraping and turning in the freezer with a fork. Everyone including the kids, loved!

So easy and doesn't require an ice-cream maker! Also works nicely with kiwi fruit cut up into small chunks.
