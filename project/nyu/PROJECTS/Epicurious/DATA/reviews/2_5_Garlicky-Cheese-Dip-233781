I read the first review and decided to try it anyway, cuz it's so easy to make. I doubled the chives, garlic, cumin and dill and thought that it was very good. I also tried it again with 1 scallion instead of chives. Maybe even better. I'm going to try it next with celery salt instead of cumin and salt.

Totally boring - if I made it again I'd triple the garlic.
