I knew I could trust a Wolfgang Puck recipes from past experience. I did use 3/4 oil per other reviewers in the dressing. This was very good and I don't feel the need to try anyone else's version. I especially liked the hit of spice from the red pepper flakes in the dressing. Most likely will make again.

Have never spent so long making a salad. Worth every second. Added chargrilled chicken. Definitely recommend the croutons, especially with sourdough.

I used Asian fish sauce instead of anchovies. It was a really good dinner with just a steak. Plus, I didn't put tapenade on the croutons as it seemed way too fussy to do each one.

Terrific winter meal! The tapenade is a favorite, and I have lots of it in the freezer, so this also made a very convenient and quick weekday dinner. BTW, the tapenade also works well with chicken, sandwiches, eggs, fish, goat cheese.... almost everything.

Yum! My family loved this! Made the dressing exactly as instructed, but be sure to include that full heaping tablespoon of chopped garlic. I added a total of 3 anchovies and whipped it up in the blender. Tossed with grilled chicken. Instead of croutons, made crostini with tampenade. Grilled bread slices with garlic/olive oil, topped with tapenade and a slice of fresh mozzarella. The olives came from Whole Foods (Nicoise and green olives with Herbs de Provence. Purchase their roasted tomatoes as well) Yum-Tastic! My tongue is still fuzzy from the garlic!

I loved the dressing. I too used anchovy paste, added a little more garlic and used olive oil. Made my own croutons. Will try the crouton recipe soon. My sisters had to have the recipe.

Amazingly delicious. My guests licked their plates. I made it EXACTLY as described and I think that's the reason why it turned out so delicious.

These croutons are wonderful. I made as written for a dinner party and got rave reviews!

Its a joke all over town that my husband eats chicken caesar salad wherever he goes for lunch everyday. He says this is the best he has ever had and he should know. I followed the recipes exactly except I used a roasted head of garlic in the vinaigrette, didn't have fresh oregano and put grilled chicken on top.

I used this recipe only for the croutons. They're very easy to make, but i like to triple the oregano, thyme, and garlic... You can never have too much! I'm not sure how long the croutons last because I go through them too quickly--they definitely motivate even the most reluctant salad eater.

made this dressing for a dinner party, did not make the croutons and I made it two days in advance. Every single guest commented on how delicious the caesar salad was. This recipe is fast, easy to make, can be made in advance, and delicious!! A keeper for sure.

I'll rate this dish seperately. The croutons are delicious!! I didn't have fresh herbs on hand but I used dried organic herbs and like I said b4 delicious!

I can only assume that the first rater must not have made the complete recipe, including the Tapenade and Ceasar dressing.

Maybe I did something wrong, but yuck. I did not like this recipe, at all.
