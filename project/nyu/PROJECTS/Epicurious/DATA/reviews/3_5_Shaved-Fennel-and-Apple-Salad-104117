SO good and refreshing. Served it alongside a pork loin and it was the perfect compliment. I omitted the canola oil as previous reviews had stated that it was too oily. Dressing was great and just tangy enough. Good for a post-Thanksgiving palate cleanse.

I was surprised how simple this was to make and how nice it turned out. We receive fennel in our CSA box and I never knew what to do with it. I used just the 1/3 c olive oil and had half the vinagrette left over for another salad.

Yum! I made a few adjustments to the dressing -- omitted the canola oil, used fresh mint instead of tarragon, and added a tablespoon of apple cider.

THis is a great recipe. People always ask for a copy of the recipe when I make it. The only change I make is that I use less oil. You really don't need a full 2/3 cup of oil.

This salad is amazing! So refreshing and easy. Will definitely make it again and again.

This dish is simply delicious. The crispness and sweetness of the apple and the fennel, combined with the tangy dressing, are wonderful. My daughter and I both described it as clean and refreshing. However, I was forced to make a few changes. I discovered that I was out of fresh lemon juice and tarragon, so I substituted fresh lime juice and dill. It worked well. Also, I used only the XV oil and omitted the canola. I had more than enough dressing to lightly coat the vegetables without leaving a huge puddle at the bottom of the bowl. I will definitely share this with family and friends.

I love it everytime!

Excellent! Great fresh flavors especially for a rich meal (i.e. pork tenderloin with gorgonzola sauce found on this sight). I also added 1 tablespoon of Pernod and used only 1 fennel and 1 apple and it was plenty for four!

Last night I made Sicilian Fennel and Orange Salad from this site. Tonight I tried this one which IMHO is much better. Only complaint from me is too much dressing/oil. Next time , I'll cut back.

Absolutely delicious and a great pairing with pork dishes. Great as a leftover as well.

For the two of us, I divide the recipe by four and make only enough for one meal, because, unlike the reviewer who enjoyed it the next day, I find it doesn't keep crisp enough overnight. Otherwise, a wonderful change of salad's usual pace!

I love fennel however this was a bit disappointing. Next time I'll take a previous cook's suggestion and add a splash of Pernod for some kick. This is definitely a side dish - not a salad for part of a buffet.

I used what I had on hand and fortunately I had the French liquor known as Pernod which has an anise flavor. I used very little, just 1 tsp. The salad was very, very good. I omitted the canola oil - did not think it needed it. Thanks to all reviewers... who are always so generous with great recipe ideas.

perfect as a light salad during an heavier dinner. I made it exactly as written, but let the dressing sit for a few hours in the fridge. the flavors blended beautifully. I shaved the apple and fennel on the mandoline, and added just enought dressing to taste - i garnished with some of the fennel fronds. perfect!!!

A delicious, refreshing salad with really unusual flavors. I made this for Thanksgiving with roast goose and it was a nice palate-cleanser from the rest of the heavy food. Easy to make. I used the amount of oil and lemon the recipe calls for and didn't find it overly oily -- the point is to have a light dressing, not a very lemony one.

Great salad- simple, clean flavor. I also omitted the canola oil all together and found the dressing to be much better. For the holiday table I added about 1/2 a pomegranite and served it on a bed of baby spinach. It's been a hit every time.

I served this lovely salad at Thanksgiving and everyone liked it, even young eaters. Combination of tastes is elegant, and it stays nice and crisp. (To those who thought the dressing too oily: the usual ratio of oil to vinegar or lemon in a vinagrette is 3 to 1. It makes a difference to use really good quality olive oil.)

This is a lovely salad. Used sweeter unpeeled apples and added some walnuts. Placed the salad on a bed of baby spinach greens and made a different dressing: Sherry vinager, walnut and grapeseed oils, shallots, Dijon and Worcestershire. Will definitely do this one again!

Refreshingly wonderful salad. I was not fond of either fennel or tarragon before I tried this but now my aversions are gone. My compliments to Chef Trotter!

This was delicious, and a nice complement to both beef and turkey (we made it for Thanksgiving). I agree with the other reviewer, however, that the recipe calls for way too much oil -- less oily and it's perfect!

Delicious on a hot Australian day for lunch. Very refreshing, only used olive oil, not canola. Tastes great the next day as leftovers.

Really different salad. Quite tasty and great for serving to guests as a special dish.

This is one of my favorite recipes! I have probably made it a dozen times since Thanksgiving, it is always a huge hit, and very elegant. Even popular with those not crazy about fennel. I have a mandoline, so it only takes about 5 minutes to prepare. Add some of the fennel fronds; it's pretty. This is my "palate cleanser" when I am making a big dinner, or rich foods. Also terrific on a hot day!!!

I substituted a pear for one of the apples and I added some toasted walnuts and placed the salad on a bed of baby lettuce. I found that the dressing was very oily and had to add a lot more lemon juice, no avail, finally I had to breakdown and add cider vinegar, which finally balanced the dressing. I would definately make this salad again, it was a big hit, everyone raved and its so easy! A nice light and crisp taste.

Very easy and very good. I substituted walnut oil for half of the olive oil and added a bit of fig vinegar. Next time, I'll try some apple cider vinegar and top it off with roasted pumpkin seeds.

A great addition to Thanksgiving. It was very refreshing and easy to make. It serves more than it says, since most people didn't eat a lot. However, several people asked for the recipe and one person said they would be adding it to their Thanksgiving menu from now on.

Delicious, refreshing (particularly with heavy foods), very easy to make, and make ahead - what could be better?!?! One caveat: I used apricot seed oil in place of the olive oil.
