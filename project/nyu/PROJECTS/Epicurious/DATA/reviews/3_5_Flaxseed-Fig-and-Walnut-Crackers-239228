I followed the directions exactly, except I used almond milk instead of soy. They turned out great, baked exactly 20 minutes. I mixed up some butter, cinnamon and a little bit of powdered sugar, and that gives it just a slight sweetness. I would make these again.

I made these with my four-year old and we both liked them a lot--plain and with apricot jam and goat cheese. They did not turn "golden brown" when they were done. I burned the first batch waiting for them to brown up. The second batch I baked for 20 minutes and the were great. Next time I'll skip the whole flax seeds.
