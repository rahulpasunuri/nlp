I made this as written and although very good, a little bland. Next time I will kick it up a bit using the prescribed(San Antonio) pepper flakes. Yes, it will override the subtlety of the saffron, but it needs some more flavor. The lemon was a great addition to the final dish. A good, light, low fat, high protein dinner.

Lacks the complexity of a really superior seafood soup, but nonetheless delicious for a weeknight dinner Will make again.

THIS WAS EXACTLY THE RECIPE I HAD AT A GRT RESTAURANT LAST WEEKEND. I ADDED A FEW MORE SHRIMP WITH SALMON AND TILAPIA (WHAT THE MARKET HAD).I USED 1 CUP OF CLAM JUICE W/ 2 CUPS CHICKEN STOCK. I ALSO ADDED SOME RED PEPPER FLAKES. IT WAS A HIT. I'LL MAKE IT AGAIN.

I made this loosely according to recipe, but used salmon instead of white fish, and twisted and tweaked a bit here and there. I found it easy and pretty quick to make and all the family enjoyed it - even the kids (aged 2 and 6). It's a bit pricy if you haven't got some spare wine, fresh seafood and saffron in the house, though.

Lovely weekday dinner; was easy to make after a long day at work.

Delicious! I added a little more shrimp than the recipe calls for, a shallot for sweetness, and I used a half tsp. of crushed saffron instead of a quarter tsp. This will go on my list of favorite things to cook!

I love saffron. I love seafood. Together at last! Delicious, light, and easy. Like some other reviewers, I substituted clam juice for a portion of the broth. Next time I'll probably take the mussels out of their shells before adding the fish, etc., even though I am sure it goes against tradition.

I thought there was too much broth-maybe try 2 cups , it might be a little tastier

This dish was wonderful...especially for seafood lovers. It was very easy to make and very tasty. I substituted fresh halibut for the cod. I would make this recipe again in a heartbeat!

The dish was only so-so, but I try it again (with ingredient variations) to see if it could be improved. I found the dish to be short on flavor.

A very good and simple version of bouillabaisse. I used halibut instead of scrod, a couple of jars of clam sauce with chicken broth, and an entire $14 jar of saffron powder instead of threads... (cause thats all they had). Expensive but so good! Loved it!
