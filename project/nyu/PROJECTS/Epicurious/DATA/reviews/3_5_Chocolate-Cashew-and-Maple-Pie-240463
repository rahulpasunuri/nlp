Ooey, gooey, goodness, this pie was a huge success! I also bought a crust, a whole wheat one, and there was a bit too much filling for it, but I expected that. I used super high grade maple syrup of the sort not available in stores, and boiling it down to 3/4 cup was fine. Anymore I would have had taffy. Also used dark chocolate which helped cut the sweet. I look forward to making it again.

this pie is pretty good. i am definitely making it again just because it slightly burned the 1st time and i want to try it at its fullest. i bought a pre-made crust and the filling was too much for the 9-inch pie. but whatever, i just threw out the remaining syrup mix. i found that the brown sugar was overwhelming in this recipe. after having two bites of the pie, i couldn't have any more and had to drink milk to cut the sweetness. like the past reviewer said, simmering the maple syrup more for a more intense flavor and a smaller yield would be ideal, as well as using 3/4 cup brown sugar. nice thanksgiving pie for the chocolate lovers, though.

Wonderful pie. I took it to the in-laws for thanksgiving. Everyone ate it up. No one touched the pumpkin pie. I didnt serve a topping with it  it didnt need it. It was very rich by itself. The maple syrup boiled over when I heated it, so next time I will use a much larger sauce pan to simmer the maple syrup. Second, I used a premade deep dish shell and there was too much filling for it, especially with the cashew and the chocolate in the bottom of the pie shell. Next time I will boil the syrup down to half a cup instead of the ¾ cup the recipe recommends. Finally I will chop up the chocolate and the cashew much smaller. The large chunks of chocolate were hard to eat as well as cut. I agree with the previous reviewer. The chocolate overpowered the flavor of the maple syrup. You can probably very successfully use corn syrup in place of the maple syrup if you use the chocolate. I made little tarts with the extra filling and I didnt put in the chocolate. It was also delicious.

Fantastic. Everyone loved it, even though I forgot to take the creme fraiche with me to the party. I made it twice. The second time I chopped the cashews. I think it looks better, and it's less cruncy during dinner. I've made other variations on pies with maple syrup, and this one is the best. Enjoy!

No maple flavor, almost too rich and the flavors did not compliment each other at all. The cashews added nothing to the recipe, would probably be better with pecans. Definitely would not make again.

Quite delicious! Tastes good without brandy and with a pre- made crust if you're short of time. I will definitely make it again.
