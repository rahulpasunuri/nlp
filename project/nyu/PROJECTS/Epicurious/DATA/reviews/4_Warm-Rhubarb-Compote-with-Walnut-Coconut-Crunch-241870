I love the sweetness of the walnut coconut crunch paired with the tartness of the rhubarb. The greek yogurt really brings it all together. I make this often!!

I'm surprised this recipe didn't receive more positive reviews. I made this for a light brunch dessert and all 6 people loved it. I too added less sugar the many times I've prepared it as I prefer it to be more tart. Adding strawberries, blackberries or apple add a nice flavor also. My husband dosen't care for walnuts, so I subtituted granola which turned out well.

Easy rhubarb recipe, the crunch is outstanding. I've probably made it 4 times this year. Equally as good using vanilla goat ice cream (Whole Foods) as with the greek yogurt.

I thought that this was an okay recipe, however, it was nothing special. The coconut crunch had a great flavor, but fell apart easily. I would consider using your rhubarb for one of the other compote recipes you can find on this website.

Two forks for the compote but four for the crunch. Much better rhubarb recipes elsewhere on this site but even coconut hating child wanted seconds of the crunch

I love this, but I found it much too sweet. Next time I'll cut the sugar. I made the crumble as written and it works really well, but as another reviewer said it should be cooled separately from the skillet used to cook it. I came close to scorching it.

This is excellent! I think it would be best to cool the crumble on a separate cookie sheet vs. the pan, it is easy to overcook or burn the mixture. I served in martini glasses and used whipped cream instead of the yogurt and it was an excellent ending to a dinner party.

Used as a topping for a tart (almost bitter) key lime pie. AWESOME!

I don't know about this one. First though, I couldn't get any Chambord or Creme de Cassis, so used pomegranate liqueur. I'm not terribly sure it added anything though. Also, unfortunately I cooked the walnut crunch just a hair too long so it tasted a little bitter. Served it in a wine glass as suggested and found it a little awkward. My favorite way to serve rhubarb compote: warm with a topping of crumble and either cream or warm custard (Bird's English!).

When my husband eats the whole thing, declares it restaurant quality and begs for a repeat the next day, you know it is an exceptional dish. I did use whipped cream instead of yogurt but that was the only change. The walnut crunch is fabulous on its own. There were no leftovers

Delicious, simple, and wonderful for a party since you can make it all ahead of time and assemble it quickly between courses. I couldn't get my hands on the creme de cassis (was making it for Sunday brunch and didn't plan ahead to get to the liquor store!) but subbed pomegranate juice and it turned out great. I warmed the compote slightly, and it was the perfect ending to a rainy Sunday spring brunch. I did not have a problem with the crunch recipe, but I did make it the night before and let it really cool all the way overnight, which I think helped it stay together. A light (lots of sugar, but not too much fat) and particularly lovely dessert for brunch or lunch.

Excellent. The compote smells and tastes fabulous (used creme de cassis); ditto the walnut crunch (didn't use coconut). I'm looking forward to eating the final product. You can make this in an enameled cast iron pan, as I did, and pour/scrape it out onto an oiled baking sheet.

Wonderful! (I did not make the crunch portion) The warm rhubarb w/ cold greek yogurt was delicious. I just drizzled some honey over the top instead of doing the crunch. Served as a dessert to the "fish in parchment w/ asparagus and orange" from the same issue- great spring meal!

I made this for dessert this past sunday for a dinner party. Sadly I could not find rhubarb yet, but I used strawberries. I also used almonds instead. I left the prepared caramalized nuts out and my friends ate them all! They were addicted. One can also use the nonfat greek yogurt. Can't wait to make this recipe with rhubarb!

It was fabulous - My crunch 'crumbled' a bit, even though I let it cool in the pan per instructions. Didn't matter - the flavors were still very spring-like and fresh. We ate it chilled. Next we'll try slightly warmed!
