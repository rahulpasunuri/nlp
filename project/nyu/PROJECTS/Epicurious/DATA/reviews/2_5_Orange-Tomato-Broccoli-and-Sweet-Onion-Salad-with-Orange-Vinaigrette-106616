It just kind of doesn't work that well...

I pretty much followed the recipe except that I substituted 3 chopped scallions for the sweet onions. I also left the orange segments whole because it made a prettier presentation. It was a very colorful and fresh tasting dish. I made sure that the steamed broccoli pieces were still crunchy but the salad still did seem a bit soggy. Some slivered toasted almonds would make a nice addition and this dish could be served hot or cold.

I enjoyed the beautiful colors of this recipe, but I did make some changes, which worked well. I used more broccoli than specified, more like 4 cups, and only 2 oranges. Didn't have sweet onion so I used red onion, but not a whole cup (maybe a half). Used dry basil (about 1.5 tsp) in the dressing instead of fresh basil, and used olive oil and balsamic vinegar for the dressing.

Don't waste your time on this one - there are so many better recipes on this site. Very strong cumin flavor.

Pretty blah and a real waste of good produce. This recipe is one of the few real dogs I've made from this site.

I followed the recipe and really didn't care for it. The broccoli and orange flavors just don't do anything for each other.

If I make this salad again, doubtful since there are so many other wonderful summer salads, I will definately change/add ingredients. Colorful, but bland. Did not make a hit at last weekends cook-out.

ONE WORD DESCRIBES THIS SALAD...AWESOME. I HAVE MADE SOME SUBSTITUTIONS, AND IT WAS STILL GREAT, LIKE USING MANDARINR ORANGES, DELETING THE ONIONS, ADDING SLIVERED ALMONDS, ANYTHING CAN BE CHANGED OR ADDED AND THIS SALAD WILL STILL BE GREAT. THANKS FOR SHARING THIS RECEIPE.

What a great recipe!! And so easy! As a "one-dish" change, I added grilled boneless chicken breasts that I had cut into bite size pieces. Great for the summer!

This is a great salad! I did change it a bit though. I followed the advice of one of the other raters and used balsamic vinegar, also used salted sunflower seeds and a sprinkle of feta cheese. Scrumptious!

Try 3 cups broccoli, and only 2 cups oranges. I found the vinagrette wasn't pungent enough - so I tried kicking it up with a teaspoon of sugar, white wine vinegar and olive oil.

Have made it twice since discovering. I enjoy it very much and highly recommend it - perfect quick easy healthy summer salad.

A gorgeous salad - a treat for the eyes and the palate! Very colorful with a great blend of flavors. Didn't have red wine vinegar, so subbed with balsamic - made a lovely dressing which complemented the oranges and fresh basil very nicely. Suggestion: if you make ahead (as I did) be sure to drain the juices from the oranges/tomatoes that collect in the bowl, before adding the dressing. Would make an excellent buffet salad - so very pretty! Another winner!
