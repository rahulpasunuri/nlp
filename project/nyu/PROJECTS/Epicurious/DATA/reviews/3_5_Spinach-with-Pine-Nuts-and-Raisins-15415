I make this recipe constantly. As others have said, I always plump the sultanas in red wine, and I toast the pine nuts first. Sometimes I use pecans instead, and always substitute minced shallots for the onions, because shallots do everything onions do, better. Some other ingredients I've incorporated with success: sliced oranges, bell pepper slivers, fresh blueberries.

This is a tasty, lovely side dish. I've made it more than once, and it continues to be a big hit with guests. I've run out of pine nuts and substituted toasted walnuts, pistachios and almonds (not blanched). Totally delicious any which way and as other reviewers commented, dried cranberries also work quite well.

Pleasant tasting and easy. I would add some lemon juice or something similar for a little more flavor

I made this ahead of time and used frozen spinach and shallots instead of onions. I tasted it when it was first cooking and was disappointed, but it impoved as it sat and the flavors mixed more. Quite delicious. Made with chicken pomegranate and yam galette. A very nice combo menu.

Definitely plump the raisins in wine. I used shallots instead of onions, and I think that worked well. It needed a little more salt than I expected. Overall, this was a pretty tasty spin on spinach.

This was easy for a novice cook like me. I made it with the "Couscous with Golden Raisins, Pine Nuts..." just to use up similar ingredients: They actually tasted great together! I steeped the raisins in white wine and added mint at the end, both of which were delicious suggestions. I also added a pinch of cayenne pepper. I will try adding a splash of lemon juice or a dash of cinnamon (another reviewer suggestion), as well as use more pine nuts and raisins. And I agree that this would be amazing with a lemon chicken.

Made this for a family dinner and it was quickly polished off. The raisins and spinach go very well together and the pine nuts give it a nice crunch. Will make it again for Thanksgiving.

I made this recipe twice (not realizing I had tried it before). Both times it was just OK. Actually, it was kind of bland.

I used one large shallot and a clove of garlic in place of the onions. I doubled the pine nuts and dried fruit (I used a diced dried fruit blend-sunmaid bits). This is a great vegetable side dish!

This was easy and delicious. I added approx. 1/2 tsp of cumin and a pinch of cinnamon, which may not be very Italian (it's Sephardic, though). Fab! I served it with Honey-Lemon chicken (on this site) and potato knishes. Yummy!!

I used packaged baby spinach and skipped the initial wilting step -- just add the uncooked greens at the end and they wilt plenty enough.

The Key to this recipe is to not serve it hot, let it cool a bit. Really did not like at the onset of our dinner, but was starving so tried again when it had cooled and thought it was pretty good! Even saved the leftovers. Next time: I'll use 4 shallots; double the raisins and pine nuts (they make the recipe); and saute the onions and then add the spinach (too wilted the way the instructions suggest). I also plumped the raisins in wine this time. Will make again!

If I were to make this recipe again I would lose the raisins and add some garlic. Of course that would make it another recipe. It wasn't bad, just not my taste.

Day 3 of detox diet and the huge bag of spinach still didn't fit in the fridge and needed using. This was pretty near perfect for the task - I soaked sultanas (rather than raisins) in apple juice and water (as that was to hand). I also 'seasoned' with lemon juice - almost made up for enforced "no added salt". Served it with quinoa - one of the better meals we've had so far.....

Unbelievably good! Plumped raisins in white wine per other reviewers' suggestions. Used frozen spinach (which, serendipitously, comes in a 2 1/2 lb. bag!) and everything worked perfectly. A quick dish for family meals but definitely company-worthy as well. We paired with fish, but I really can't think of a mismatch for this dish...poultry, pork, steak, pasta, grains...go for it!

We make this dish at least once a month. Love it! You might want to adjust the amount of pine nuts or raisins to taste. Spinach for people who don't like spinach!

I love spinach, but it tends to be one of my more boring side dishes. This is a great way to jazz it up!

Perfect, even using less oil.

This will definitely become a regular in my house. My children are not big veggie eaters, but they liked this dish (as did my husband and I). I made it on the fly and didn't have any pine nuts handy, so I substituted sliced almonds, and it worked very nicely.

This dish was too good to just call it spinach. Everyone at my dinner party was surprised they liked it. So easy to make. Used 5 bags of baby spinach - forgot how much spinach leaves wilt. I had prepared the whole dish earlier in the afternoon, and then put the whole thing back in a pan for a few minutes to warm up.

Great! I use golden raisins and pine nuts, but substitute baby spinach (no need to remove stems).I use less olive oil, and substitute several cloves of crushed garlic instead of the onions. Great as a stuffing for pork loin or chicken cutlets!

This has become a regular in our house. I use about half the olive oil and cook the onion first, then add in the spinach and cook just to wilt. Simple and delicious.

My boyfriend loved this dish. I had to substitute dried currants for the raisins once but have made it both ways and it tastes fantastic and different. Just FYI- when served as a leftover it has a very liquor-like aftertaste. Not bad, just different than when originally served.

I made this for Rosh Hashonah to very enthusiastic reviews. I used more shallots than called for which made everything very sweet and delicious. I wilted the spinach in a few batches which was fine. I served it at room temperature and it was all gone! It's a nice change from the average vegie dish

I used four shallots in place of the yellow or green onions and golden raisins macerated in white wine. It was great. This is truly a mountain of spinach - I did the wilting in two batches, which worked fine but took a bit longer. This would be different and probably not as good with frozen spinach, but I will probably make it that way as a weekday side dish. It would still be a good alternative to plain spinach.

Easy, elegant way to prepare spinach. My husband said it was the best spinach dish he had ever had.

Great - but even better with a Granny Smith apple pealed, cubed and cooked with the onions.

Delicious; nothing left over. I used vidalia onion and shallots, and added nutmeg per other reviewer's suggestion and some fennel seed. Mmmmmm....

A big hit a my dinner party. I added dried cranberries soaked in white wineinstead of raisins,just because I like them better. I also toasted the pine nuts. It was great.

and a question about substituting other nuts for the very expensive pine nuts. I buy pesto at Costco, which substitutes locally grown English walnuts, and tastes just fine. Blanch the English walnuts or what? Pine nuts are murderously expensive, and English walnuts are locally U pick cheap in the fall. Or substitute other nuts? anybody have any "nutty" substitutes and how to use them?

Yum!! 3 forks as above, 4 forks if you use sweet onions and more than double the raisins :) Yes, I confess I like this dish on the sweet side. When I feel lazy, instead of toasting the pine nuts beforehand, I add them to the pan a little before the onions are done cooking. Strangely, I think this dish tastes better after it has been sitting at room temperature for a little while. (But seriously, how many people have pans that can hold 2.5 pounds of fresh spinach leaves?)

I only used a pound and a half of spinach and then added tortellini. We took it on a picnic and ate it as a side dish. It was great!

I like spinach and this is a nice addition to my recipe box. I made two changes to the recipe. First, I used vidalia onions to give it a sweet taste, and, secondly, I macerated the raisins in some chardonnay I had in the refrigerator. Next time, I might add either some nutmeg or some fresh marjoram leaves to take it to a higher level. You can cook the spinach in advance, which is nice, and rewarm it once you have sauteed the onions. By the way, you do need all of the spinach indicated -- I had surprisingly little left over after serving six people.
