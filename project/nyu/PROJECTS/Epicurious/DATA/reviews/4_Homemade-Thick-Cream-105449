Wow! I too was worried about making this and getting it too hot or not having a warm enough spot to keep it& I worried for nothing. It was easy and it is so much tastier than sour cream!

I have used this many times. I first read about this technique as a substitute for creme fraiche.

I was a bit concerned abuot making this (getting the cream to hot, or the kitchen being too cold when it was setting) and accidentally added in 2 tablespoons of buttermilk, not two teaspoons. I was very happy with the results -- it turned out thick and a great flavour. I'll stick to making my own instead of making due with soured cream from now on out.
