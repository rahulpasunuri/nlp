This was one of the best Brussels sprouts recipes I have ever made. My husband couldn't stop eating this. I used pecans instead of hickory nuts because that is what I had on hand.

Everyone loved it! I used almonds instead of Hickory nuts as a family member has alergy to other nuts. It was quick & delicious!

One of the BEST brussels sprouts recipes! I added 2 large shallots; used olive oil to saute. Also used walnuts. My Cuisinart 4mm blade slices perfectly.

Delicious. I cooked the shredded brussels sprouts first, put it in a casserole, and then toasted the pecans in the same pan, added the maple syrup, and then poured it all together in the casserole. Even easier than the recipe's instructions.

Total crowd pleaser. Shared this at a Thanksgiving potluck and it was the only dish that had no leftovers! I had trouble gauging quantity on the sprouts, so I went a little heavy on the nuts and light on the vinegar (one time I made it and the vinegar took over in a bad way). I subbed walnuts (cheaper) and a fancy white wine vinegar that I had around cause I ran out of cider vinegar. I also subbed honey for the maple syrup this time and it worked out just fine.

Very tasty and I don't really care for brussel sprouts. I thawed some frozen brussle sprouts and sliced them with a knife while partially frozen. I also added a touch of cayenne pepper at the end and I really enjoyed the contrast. Very good - not really an eye catcher so if you are serving it to guests you might want to add some chopped parsley at the end just to improve the color contrast.

Quick and tasty. Rather than holding the nuts aside until the end, I simply toasted the pecans, chopped them once they had cooled a bit, and then sauted them quickly in butter and maple syrup. I pushed the nuts to the sides of the pan and threw the shredded brussel sprouts right in with them, added a bit more butter and sauted for a few more minutes. It saves you a disk. Be sure to remember the apple cider vinegar - it makes for a nice sweet-sour taste.

this recipe made me take second and third helpings of a vegetable that i typically don't like. i substituted walnuts for pecans and most of the butter with olive oil.

I found fresh baby brussel sprouts still on the stem at the farmers market, and they were really delicious in this recipe. I used hazelnuts.

I made this with pecans and i was a huge hit with my hubby. Added some crumbled blue cheese and it made it even more awesome!

I have never been a fan of brussel sprouts, but they always make it onto the dinner table at the holidays. This Christmas we tried this recipe and it was a hit; even with the non-fans. It was the first vegetable to be finished at the table this year!

I've been making this recipe for Thanksgiving every year since 2003. I use pecans because I have yet to find a hickory nut. Everyone LOVES this recipe.

I used hazelnuts, which were great too. I'm going to make it again and try mixing hazelnuts and pecans. I also didn't bother shredding because - I just sliced the brussels sprouts and let them fall apart in the pan.

Loved it, most of those to whom I served it didn't realize they were brussel sprouts. Easy and fast.

Excellent. I used pecans instead of hickory nuts. This was a big hit with my family at Christmas. Shredding them really prevents the bitter taste you can get with whole boiled sprouts. Would definitely make again - and not just for the holidays.

Just made this for Thanksgiving -- people loved it. Even people who said they don't usually like brussels sprouts -- one of whom asked me for the recipe. Plus it was easy to do the prep the day before and then throw it together at the last minute. BTW, I didn't have a slicer, so I used a knife and it worked just fine. A little slower, I'm sure. Highly recommended.

Did I miss something? Why preheat the oven? Seems like they were completed in the pan.

very delicious! the maple nuts really add a lot and the shredded sprouts make it so fluffy. went over very well with my husband!

I don't see me cooking brussels sprouts any other way now. I did modify the recipe slightly by increasing (almost double) the mapled pecans and using balsamic vinegar instead of the cider vinegar (didn't have any on hand go figure!) Got several compliments when I brought it to a family gathering. The flavors and textures complement each other very well.

My beloved viewed this with suspicion when he saw me shredding the sprouts. But the final presentation won him over! These were wonderful...I used pecans in place of hickory nuts. I'll be serving these at Christmas dinner...

Loved this- and you really don't need the mandolin- I had just bought one and my skills on the new appliance were just not up to this-scared me a little- so sliced them and they worked out great. I have made this time and again- my German friends particularly like it.

This recipe taught me that, although I never liked brussels sprouts before, they make a delicious stir-fry if you slice them. Recipe as written is wonderful, of course.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year with pecans.Loved it but thought the shredding diminished the brussels sprout taste. We are brussels sprout lovers! This year I will definitely make it again but will quarter the sprouts instead of shredding.

Walnuts work very well in this recipe. I cut down on the butter and add a little canola or olive oil. This is a great way to get non Brussel sprout eaters to eat them! I;e been making this recipe since it appeared in the magazine.

everybody (including the Kids) loved this and none of them had been brussel sprout eaters. We fix this twice a month now - used pecans and it worked very well.

If you are a purist for brussel sprouts, then you may be disappointed. however, my guests all loved this. There's something about the shredding that changes the brussel sprout experience. Last suggestion: if this is part of a thanksgiving meal, time it so that this goes from pan to plate ASAP. I thought it lost its color quickly.

how wonderful this was at thanksgiving and at christmas, i used the leftovers in tossed salad the next day and didnt have to use dressing! i just love thes wonderful recipe!! thanks for including it in your magazine!

Great recipe - everyone loved it. I think next time I'll add a spoonful of maple syrup to the butter in the pan just before tossing in the brussels sprouts - they were just a little too bitter for my taste.

We all really liked this. Served it with the herb and spice roasted beef tenderloin with shallot sauce, potato gratin with creme fraiche and gruyere and beets in orange sauce - I guess it was an Epicurious Xmas. Even the teens ate the brussels!

I made this dish for the family (4 of us humans) and we had some left over. All during dinner, my two Bouviers were begging. After dinner, they followed the bowl of brussels sprouts over to the counter and looked at the leftovers. I could not believe that my picky dogs were begging for the brussels sprouts, but I put a little in their dinner bowls. They scarfed it up, leaving the canned food and kibble behind to beg for more sprouts. I wish my human family had liked this dish as much as the dogs did.

I used pecans and served this at a mostly veggie Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. I'm making another batch as I write this.

This is one way to get non brussels sprouts eaters to gobble away. The blending of the mapled pecans and crunchy shredded brussel sprouts was a perfect Thanksgiving vegetable. It was so easy to make--we'll definitely make it again.

As a true fan of brussel sprouts, this is one of the best ways I have ever had them - and even my non-brussel loving family finished them off. The shredding reduces the cooking time and brings out the nutty flavor. I did not have hickory nuts - but substituted pecans which were great.

This dish was well-received at our Thanksgiving dinner; it was appreciated for its lightness. One person said it was the best Brussels sprouts dish in his memory. Using a V-slicer, I sliced the Brussels sprouts two days before Thanksgiving and stored them in Tupperware. The preparation was time-consuming, but it paid off in the long run, because in the last few minutes before dinner, the dish was much quicker and easier than preparing whole Brussels sprouts. I glazed the pecans the night before---no trouble at all. I was pleased that the glazed nuts were subtly sweet, not at all like candy. Next time, I will plan ahead to order hickory nuts, which would add a special touch. Does anyone think black walnuts would work well here?

Everyone loved this brussel sprout recipe! I cut the sprouts by hand and it did not take a lot of time at all. Used pecans and the result was delicious. Would definitely make again.

To answer a cook from Austin, TX - I shred them in the food processor - saved time and got an excellent dish - everybody loved it!!!

A delicious way to eat brussel sprouts. I used almonds and they, along with the maple syrup, were a great compliment to the sprouts. The mandolin was time consuming (not to mention dangerous to finger tips) so I'll use the food processor next time.

This was too time consuming for the resulting not that great flavor. The nuts were good but the shredded brussels were lacking. I'd serve these nuts with whole brussels instead.

This is the first brussels sprouts recipe I've tried (hated them as a kid) and my husband and I really enjoyed it. Once the sprouts were shredded, it was quite easy. Has anyone tried shredding them in the food processor? The mandoline method was pretty time-consuming.

I really love Brussels Sprouts but didn't think this recipe was anything special. I'll eat what I made, but don't think I'd bother making it again. Although, contrary to what I initially thought, the syrup roasted nuts (as oposed to honey roasted) complimented the Brussels Sprouts.

Combined this with the roasted parsnips and butternut squash recipe from the October '03 Gourmet to make a vegetarian dinner. Used pecans and toasted them in a skillet rather than in the oven. The brussels sprouts (a secret favorite of mine) were really delicious.
