Repeat: read the recipe first since it's written poorly. The muffins do brown easily at the bottom so the 350/400 trick is probably best. Used lemon instead of orange, omitted nuts due to allergy. Needs vanilla perhaps? Taste is adequate but could be more moist (so add 1/8 cup more oil/butter or reduce flour by 1/4 cup). Nice presentation. Will try again (why not, it's pretty) with the temperature and oil tips along with vanilla and caradmom

I just moved from sea level to 7000 feet and have had to adjust my baking. This recipe was helpful because of the high altitude directions. I didn't have fresh cranberries but used 1 cup of Craisins. I boiled a cup of orange juice and soaked the Craisins while I mixed everything else up, then drained and chopped them. They turned out beautifully!

made these again today...to save time I just mixed brown sugar and cinnamon and sprinkled on top for the streusel topping. tasted better and saved time.

Enjoyed these muffins! Great way to use up my left over from Xmas, pecans and cranberries. You can never have too much orange zest so used the zest from one whole L orange. Did not have orange extract but used Almond instead...gave it more of a berry flour! Substituted bran for wheat germ and used banana yogurt because that is what I had in my fridge. Even with substitutions this recipe worked out great! I like recipes where I don't have to get out my mixer!

A perfect muffin for a Fall Sunday morning. Substituted spelt flour (1 1/2 cups) for the all purpose flour & did not add the wheat germ. Measured everything in ounces - 4 oz. cranberries, 2 oz. pecans, etc. & the muffins came out just right. Added 2 teaspoons orange zest instead of one. Cooked 10 minutes at 400 & then 10 minutes at 350 just to be sure they were not overdone. My family asked to have this recipe added to our family favorites list

These muffins are fantastic! Any recipe that calls for 3 bowls is troublesome. But these are worth it- -they're restaurant quality! Well worth the trouble making them. I am glad I read the reviews first-- it is important to read the directions (sometimes poorly written) before making! The recipe begins by telling you how to prepare the muffin pan. Then it seems to ask you to stick an empty greased muffin pan in the oven for 20 minutes, which would sure make for a smoking, burned muffin pan! I decided it must mean to pre-heat the oven for 20 minutes--why didn't they just say that? I made some changes, though: I used frozen cranberries, which I didn't defrost. I started cutting them up, decided that was too time-consuming, so most of what went in was whole. It meant for a more cranberry-tasting muffin. Also, I used buttermilk instead of yogurt--that worked great. I don't believe in going to the store to bake muffins, so when I discovered I didn't have any wheat bran, I used an equal amount of Malto-Meal cereal (because an old Betty Crocker cranberry-orange muffin recipe uses that) and that was just fine--you can't taste them. I used slightly more flour and slghtly less sugar as we're over 5,000 feet here. The muffins rose up just fine, and were done in 20 minutes. Bet you can't eat just one!

The oven temperature was way too hot, and they burned. I took them out after 17 mins, and the bottoms were so badly burned that they stuck to the muffin wrapper. I would keep the oven at 400 and take them out after 14-15 mins or reduce the temperature and keep an eye on them. Also, I needed to triple the streusel recipe. Wasn't a huge fan of it - too much flour. Would have added brown sugar. Finally, the batter was too dry, so I added milk until the consistency was better. I would try making these again because I think they would be excellent once I figure out the right baking temp.

the oven was too hot and they burned. I mean seriusly burnt! I would lower the heat. I never follow recipes and this is what happens when I do.

I substituted buttermilk for the yogurt and replaced the cinnamon with ground cardamom. Though the recipe seemed unduly complicated, the results were quite good. The streusel makes them look special.

I completely changed this recipe, from start to finish, and the results were AWESOME!! The first thing i changed was the cranberries to fresh macerated strawberries (same amount). Then i altered the wheat germ from 2 T to 1/2c...Next I reduced the flour by 1/2c. Nice fluffy muffins. Great recipe will definitely make again, with comparable adjustments.

I own a very large b&b and make these muffins for my guests. They always ask for seconds! A few notes--I use canola oil instead of butter. I make the streusel crumbs in a mini-food processor. Muffins with a streusel top always take more time to make, but are worth it because people generally don't take the time to do it themselves. So these are good for company. I stir in the chopped cranberry mixture (I use fresh cranberries) to the flour mixture before adding the wet ingredients; it will prevent the cranberries from sinking to the bottom. I also only get a yield of 8 muffins for the above recipe. I add 1/4 t. cardamom in addition to the cinnamon. I think the orange zest and the orange extract are essential to prevent a boring muffin, as is the addition of the wheat germ. I serve these muffins with quiche lorraine and fruit, butter and marmalade.

I too struggled with the complicated instructions. Make sure you read them carefully from start to finish often. The muffins were ok...not awful, but I'm looking for another recipe to use the remaining cranberries!

I thought the instructions were unnecessarily complicated but I followed it to a tee omitting the nuts. They came out as hard little weapons not as fluffy moist muffins. I wouldn't make these again.

Burdened with an excess of cranberries, this recipe is a great way to use a bunch. Skipped all the orange and replaced with applesauce and some extra brown sugar to cut the tartness of the cranberries a bit. Very good
