I've made this soup for several years; the sunchoke flavor is so unique that I literally hoard it by freezing it in single-size portions. Today I made these changes based largely on another recipe: 1.roasted half the sunchokes with the peel for 30 mins. 2.used water instead of stock. 3.onions were half shallots and half red onion. It was fabulous. I thinned it a little with water and only added about 1 TB of cream per cup.I find that cream dilutes the flavor.

Substituted onion for leek, doubled the garlic and threw in a carrot. Great texture, but a little too subtle for my taste, so I added ground cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper to liven it up. Very tasty.

Great use of sunchockes. I used 4 cups of chicken stock and 2 cups of mushroom and it was great. 7 cups of vegetable seems like way too much. You definitely should not waste time peeing the sunchokes. Just scrub and cook and then blend. I also added some diced carrot and celery for a little depth of flavor.

I made this to use a few things I had in the fridge, so I replaced the onion by a few branches of celery, I put a half-cup of white wine just before adding the broth, and I added a dozen frozen chestnuts I had in the freezer at the same time as the sunchokes. Delicious!

I love this soup and it is well received when served to friends. Great w the pepitas, also w home-made croutons. I didn't get the pumpkin seed oil, and loved it anyway. Sunchokes around here are best (and cheapest) from the farmers market, but they are actually really easy to grow and perennial -- bonus!

WOW! I made this for a Christmas Dinner Party. Everyone raved about it. No need to peel the chokes, just scrub them and cut off any bruises. Make sure you use the pumpkin seeds, toast them for 5 minutes in a 350º oven. I also used the pumpkin seed oil ($20 at Whole Foods) and I think it was well worth it. Very special soup!

Definitely will make this again. Sunchokes have such a distinct taste you wouldn't want it everyday. But super tastey with the pumpkin seeds and my guests loved it. Makes you look like a fancy chef.

Excellent - the Sunchokes provide a velvety smooth texture. Hardest part was finding the sunchokes in Sept., (Our Farmers market had them - Whole Foods and the local Co-op did not yet), and paying for pumpkin seed oil (not a staple!).

Used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock (will probably use less next time for a thicker consistency), soup was three forks until I added the pepitas which kicked it up to a four. Great flavor, will definitely make again.

I made this for our girls "gourmet group" and all 7 of us loved it. velvety smooth, and very elegant. the toasted pumkin seed garnish added a nice crunch. it's a keeper.
