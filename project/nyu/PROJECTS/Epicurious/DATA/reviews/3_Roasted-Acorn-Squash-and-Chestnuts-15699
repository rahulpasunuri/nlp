The basting sauce is delicious. However the cooking time is way too long for the squash. 30 minutes was plenty for the squash. I did not use the chestnuts but I think it all would have been way overcooked at one hour and 20 minutes. Three of us reviewed the recipe so I think we had the cooking time right. Will definitely use this again.

I couldn't find chestnuts but blanched slivered almonds were a great substitute. I also added a touch of ginger and cinnamon to the sugar mixture. Also added some Morningstar Chik'n Meal Starters in the last 20 minutes of baking. Just sprinkled them in with the squash, sugar and almonds. Served over a bed of long grain white rice. My slivers of squash were small but worked well paired with the rice. Might try squash halves next time. An excellent fall dish.

Couldn't find chestnuts, so I substituted hazelnuts. Turned out great.

*** Be sure to cook the squash pieces with the skin facing down, so that you can spoon the butter sugar mixture into the cavity of each piece of squash. it sort of simmers there as it bakes and the flavors go into the squash better that way.

This is such a flavorful harvest recipe and the combination of the chestnuts, butter and sugar impart a rich nutty taste to the squash. The flavors compliment eachother extremely well! We will be making this again this year.

I made this once, had some problems, but decided to make it again in order to improve it. I made 1/4 of the recipe the first time and ended up with dried out squash and burnt sugar. The second time, I made 1/4 of the recipe again, but I cut the squash in half instead and filled each cavity. This worked out much better--the squash was moist and the sugar stayed inside the squash and didn't burn on the tray.

I broke up the whole chestnuts a bit so they would be more evenly coated with the sugar syrup. I might peel the squash the next time I make this...

I'm not sure what exactly I did wrong with this. I couldn't find any chestnuts, but didn't think it would be a big deal to exclude them from this recipe. Otherwise, I followed the directions to a T. Aside from the syrupy sugar-butter blackening and smoking, the squash came out very dark and extremely bitter. Ick. That was a lot of hassle- would have been much easier to dump all ingredients directly into the garbage!

Wonderful! Just enough sweetness to the recipe and easy to make.
