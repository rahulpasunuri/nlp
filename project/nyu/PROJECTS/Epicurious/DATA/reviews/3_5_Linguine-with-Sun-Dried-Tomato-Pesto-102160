I used toasted almonds and roasted pumpkin seeds. Had no fresh basil - used some Italian parsley. Also - had some aged hard goat cheese (kind of like goat parmesan) that needed using up. Altogether = Very yummy!

OMG!!!!!!! This is fabulous... I did add extra garlic and only used 1/8th of a cup of water...but otherwise as printed. Amazing.

I made this with pistachios instead of almonds. So good that I scraped the sides of the pot with bread to get the leftovers!

Loved it. Needs a little more garlic though.

I added 2 garlic cloves,used rotini pasta, and used a little less water than called for. It was wonderful. Definately a keeper. The only thing I would add would be a little lemon juice. It needs something bright.

Made the following modifications (as suggested by other reviewers): Used toasted pine nuts, two cloves garlic, cut down on the water (approximately half of what is said in the recipe), and chopped up some extra sun-dried tomatos into bite size pieces and tossed with pesto mixture. Will definitely make again, as the pesto sauce is so versatile - I served some of the extra on the side with olive oil and toasted french bread. Overall, excellent!

I am very excited about this basic recipe. It belongs in every cook's repertoire. This gives good proportions and tastes fantastic. Made with home grown basil and some parsely and threw in fresh (frozen fresh) shrimp, dinner took less than 20 minutes and was far less oily and more delicious and fresh than any restaraunt pesto dish!!

I just got through making this pesto and put it over some rigatoni. It was very simple to make and very delicious. I too added toasted pinenuts instead of almonds. In addition I felt it needed a bit of tartness so I added the juice of 1/2 a lemon. Also, I read a hint in another recipe where one should blanch and shock the basil before processing so it retains it green color. I will make it again was sooooo good.

i substituted the almonds with pine nuts. i did not add the extra water at the end as i thought the results would be runny. everyone loved this dish.

I agree with other reviewers. It's an easy to make BASE recipe. Since basil is in abundance, I doubled up on the basil, tripled the garlic, added a bit of sea salt and fresh ground pepper & it improved the flavor significantly. Fusilli or Rotini does hold the sauce better. I also threw a few sd-tomato chunks in with the pasta. This dish gets an "A" for versatility. Next time I make it, I'm sure I'll experiment with tossing other things into the pasta.

Three cloves of garlic, skip the red pepper, use walnuts--really good; make some, freeze the rest. Served over fresh chicken-garlic ravioli.

This dish is great! I, too, used pine nuts instead of almonds. Also, I used rotini (spiral pasta) instead of linguine. These are easier to eat, serve, and the contents of the sauce cling to the pasta better.

I've made this twice and plan to make another batch to use up my basil. IT's always gotten thumbs up from my company.

Yeah baby....sauteed chicken and tossed w/ tortellini. Awesome. This pesto is also great alone as a dip or as part of an appetizer. Spread on a toasted baguette and put a marinated grilled shrimp on top.

Because your able to make this ahead of time. I took it on a camping trip. Everyone loved it. Nice gourmet touch for a camping dinner.

Really good. I made 3 batches of this a few weeks ago, omitting the cheese, and froze them. It is still wonderful after freezing (with addition of the cheese at the time you serve).

This was great! My kids even liked it. I omitted the almonds and stirred in pinenuts...delicious!

This is very good -- nice balance of the sun-dried tomatoes, basil, nuts, cheese, garlic and olive oil. It also heated up well the next day.

Yum, who wouldn't love this, and its easy to vary. Why not try pignolas (pine nuts) next time.
