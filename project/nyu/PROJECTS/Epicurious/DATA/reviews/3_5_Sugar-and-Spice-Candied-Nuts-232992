Just made this, I am home sick with a cold and I needed something sweet and all I had in the house was some mixed nuts. Perfect afternoon snack. I normally play with a recipe but this was perfect just the way it was. Didn't take long to make and pretty easy to clean up as well.

I've received raves all 15 times I've served these nuts. It's a great basic recipe that can be modified in many ways to get even better results. Drizzle melted dark chocolate, add fresh orange zest and try some heat like cayenne. I doubled the recipe yesterday... diced 5 slices of already cooked bacon and added 3 tsp. fresh black pepper just before popping into the oven. The salty bacon and black pepper added a sinfully deviant dimension.

I have made this several times, especially during the holidays. People love them.

Quick, easy recipe. I took to a party & they were gobbled up. Will make these again.

I found this to be too sweet - to the point where there was no nut taste, even after reducing the sugar. Very easy recipe, and probably good for people who drink soda and prefer milk chocolate over dark chocolate, but not for me.

I found this to be very simple and yummy. I made these and gave them out as gifts during the holidays. I followed the recipe without any additions and received rave reviews.

I made these with pecans for christmas, they took no time at all and were eaten up so fast! I spent hours in the kitchen baking and all my other treats took a back seat to these nuts! I'm making them again today to sprinkle over icecream!

I used half brown sugar / half granulated sugar and added 2 tsp rum flavoring 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 cup of shredded coconut for a variation. Used a teflon coated sauce pan and baked on a silpat mat inside a jelly roll pan (cookie sheet w/ sides) absolutely no sticking - no need to use grease or butter for non-stick purposes and it turned out fabulous! I've done many variations and this is my favorite. It is so quick and simple to make - I might try adding popcorn next!

Absolutely delicious!! I didn't have corn syrup so I added 1T molasses and 2T orange juice instead. I then added about 1 tsp orange zest before baking. So incredibly good and not overly sweet. Will definitely make again and again.

My family went "nuts" over this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and found the nuts to be crisp and flavorful without being too coated.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I did not like this recipe. I thought the nuts were pretty flavorless. I thought they'd have a bit more zip to them, maybe the orange zest would help.

I just love these! Made several batches to give as gifts; I hope they survive my snacking!! I used a non-stick pan with no parchment or foil - just sprayed with oil and it worked fine. Next time, I may add a little orange zest but it's delicious as-is. ENJOY!!

Wow quick and easy to make. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of orange peel. Will make a great little gift too!

Ungreased Reynolds no-stick foil worked great. I found that the product at 12 minutes looked more like brittle than coated nuts. I let pan cool 6 minutes, then stirred with the spatula to redistribute the caramel onto the nuts-spread out nuts and let cool the rest of the 45 minutes- Walnuts worked fine

I substituted 2 T molassses for the corn syrup with delicious results. Watch the oven cooking time; they burn easily.
