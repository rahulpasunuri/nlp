If you are going to make this dish, be sure you have the Thai oil. I used regular unflavored oil, and was underwhelmed. If you don't have all the correct ingredients, I would recommend going with a different curry recipe.

The first time I made this, I couldn't find the stir-fry mix at the store, so created my own with snow peas, celery, carrots, green and red bell pepper, onions. This time, I was so excited to find the stir-fry mixture, but it totally changed the dish -- it was Pearsons and had way too much cabbage, which watered down the sauce even more and completely changed the flavor of the dish. Next time, I will go back to creating my own vegetable mixture. It's delicious.

We loved this dish. I couldn't find packaged sf vegetables in my grocery store's produce section, though they do sometimes have them, so prepared my own, adding only a few minutes of prep time. Used chili oil - good, but very hot. Next time will look for the Thai oil. Cut down on the curry paste to offset, but still quite spicy. The combination of flavors, with the coconut milk as base, is so delicious. Will make again and again.

Great dish, I added some stir fried peanuts. A note to the "singaporean cook", as I sit here I am looking at "Panang Curry Paste" from Thailand. Maybe you should be more informed before declaring what is what and where it comes from. This is a very authentic receipe and very very good. I also tossed it with all the ingredientes and it was great.

Really good and a nice change from the usuall teriyaki stir fry recipes. Very easy and fast.

I'm not sure what this recipe has to do with Singapore, since it tastes very much like common Thai Green Curry, for which there are better recipes on this site. I like more bite, so I doubled the amount of green curry paste, which then unfortunately dominated the flavored oil and ginger soy. It is easy to make though and would make a good weeknight meal.

I'm back to this recipe to print another copy; the first one was stolen by a very happy dinner guest. Easy to make, lots and lots of yums.

This is great! Tastes just like something you'd get in a good Thai restaurant. Like another reviewer, I thought the sauce was good enough to eat like soup!

This tasted differently than I thought. My husband loved it. It's spicy and not sweet. I used fresh stir fry veggies (in the produce dept), baby corn and water chestnuts. I followed the other reviewers suggestion and added 1/4 c Chicken Broth and 1 tsp. of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. It turned out nicely.

I gave this recipe 4 forks because it is so easy to make and a perfect weeknight dinner. I followed the earlier suggestions of removing the veggies before making the sauce to keep them crunchy, and I also added water chestnuts and onions to the veggie mix. It was absolutely delicious!

Great recipe that our whole family loves. Quick and easy to make after work and still feel like you had a special meal.

I also cooked everything separately and it was great. This is a very good base recipe (I added garlic and ginger as suggested, used roasted chili paste instead of curry paste and added a little garam masala) for a quick midweek dinner. Definitely worth playing around with. Yum!

Loved this dish. I took the advice of other reviewers and thickened the sauce a little by adding 1/4 c. chicken broth mixed with 1 t. cornstarch. This helped a bit. The sauce was so good I was eating it like soup!! I garnished it with chopped basil and cilantro. Really, really tasty.

This was great. I used fresh broccoli and mushrooms, reg soy sauce and light coconut milk. I thought the flavor was great but wished the sauce had thickened up more. Maybe a little cornstarch or reg coconut milk. I will definately try again. Too easy.

In my opinion, for ease of preparation with minimal time and not a ton of ingredients, this recipe is fantastic. I doubled the sauce and was glad I did. I also minced up a little bit of fresh garlic and ginger and coated the shrimp before stir-frying. Also, after I cooked and removed the shrimp, I stir-fried my vegetables and set those aside with the shrimp. I prepared the coconut curry sauce separately and added the shrimp and vegetables back in when the sauce was ready...that way the vegetables were not overcooked like other reviewers'. This recipe is so easy and quick (and yummy) that it is a must try.

This is a great recipe for a quick, tasty weeknight meal. (But if you're looking for haute cuisine, you should find a different recipe.) My husband and I have made it many times, serving it with jasmine rice, and always enjoy it. You can keep all the ingredients in your freezer and pantry and throw it together when you can't think of anything else to do. Fresh vegetables,if you have them around, are better than frozen, but the frozen ones work fine.

This was pretty good. I'm not crazy about stir-fry vegetables so I used peppers (red & green), mushrooms, and red onions. I also threw in a little garlic and shallot. I stir-fried the vegetables first and added the shrimp.

This recipe is amazing. I used a mixture of sesame oil and garlic oil, and, as I like my veggies rather crunchy with form, I made up the coconut-curry paste mixture in the wok first, heating it slightly, then added the veggies and finally the cooked shrimp. Served over a bed of jasmine rice. Yum! I recommend doubling the 'sauce' as I kept getting requests for more. All in all, very easy to make and very versatile!

For the benefit of the other cooks below whom seem to have read into the ingredient "mixed stir-fry vegetables" it does not say anything about using frozen. Just FYI, in most large grocery stores you can find fresh vegetable stir fry bags in the produce section. I made this yet using a bag that includes Napa, carrots, bok choy, celery and water chestnuts, and a little fresh red capsicum (bell pepper) as well and got the expected good results.

The aroma of the curry and coconut milk was just devine! My husband loves this dish - we've already made it two times. The only improvement I can think of would be to thicken the sauce, perhaps by adding a bit of cornstarch.

Okay, this looks interesting but no way is it Singaporean. "Thai oil" and "Thai curry paste?" Give me a break! Singaporean Cook

SOOO good! Tried the suggestion of cilatro and lime juice, and it is an excellent idea! Also added a touch of sambal and a little rice wine vinegar. Cooked with a mix of peanut, sesame and chili oil, and used less oil than recipe calls for as well as light coconut milk. And fresh veggies are the way to go, as well as garlic and fresh ginger. Next time also might add a little lemongrass. My husband loved this as well -- he's VERY impressed with me right now -- hehehe!!

Very flavorful, quick and light. I cut the oil in half and used light coconut milk to help cut calories and fat. Next time I'm going to garnish with cilantro and a squeeze of lime instead of the green onions.

Very quick and light....I used less oil, lowfat coconut oil and added more veggies. Was delicious and we didn't miss the fat due to the spicy nature of the dish. Plus, called ahead to have shrimp peeled and deveined....so was a real snap!

This was very spicy, but delicious and easy. I did use fresh vegetable instead of frozen stir-fry veggies--think it made a big difference and didn't take much more time.

This was so good and incredibly easy to make. I left out the shrimp (for the Vegans) and added lots of other vegetables (water chestnuts were a great addition). Everyone was very impressed! I will make this many more times with different meats and vegetables.

Awesome! My wife & I have been searching for a Thai red curry recipe like we love at our favorite Thai restaurant. This is real close. This basic recipe could be done with almost anything...chicken, duck, beef, shrimp, scallops. I tossed the shrimp with some minced fresh ginger and sliced garlic before cooking. I used 2 1/2 tsp. of Thai red curry paste, but we love the endorphin rush of spicy food that makes you sweat and your nose runny. You can adjust this to your own taste. Finally, I would increase the volume of sauce next time because I like a little more for the rice to soak up.

Great dish - I doubled the chili paste, and added snow peas, peppers, brocoli, a bit of brown sugar and fish sauce. Great with jasmine rice.

Excellent, easy recipe, although needs just a dash of salt. I used red, green and yellow peppers for color, string beans and pineapple. Serve over a fragrant rice such as basmati or jasmine. Yum!!

Very Good entree, I added zucchini, broccoli, red and green peppers to give it a fuller stir-fry look, I mistakenly used coconut cream instead of the milk which avoided this "waiting for it to thicken" requirement, it worked out great! This can be purchased at Whole Foods Market, by Tara (7oz), I used 1 and 1/2 containers, I mixed the Thai spice, ginger soy and the coconut cream together and kept it in the fridge until it was needed. I stir fried the vegetables, then removed them adding them to the sauce after it was ready, then the shrimp, I got rave reviews rom my friends! It's a keeper!

So easy to make! I usually make this dish when we are having another couple over for dinner. It is delicious and easy.

I thought this was a fabulous recipe both for ease and flavor. Will probably add a bit of ginger next time. Served it with coconut rice.

The flavor combination of coconut milk & chili is always a winner. This recipe was not my favorite, though. The vegetables cook faster than the sauce has time to reduce, so all the sauce sinks to the bottom of your plate.

Flavors were great but I used light coconut milk and found it didn't want to thicken--at least not by the time my vegies all wilted. Next time I'll thicken a little with cornstarch so I can still have crispy vegetables.

This was excellent! I, too, added some grilled eggplant and red onion. Also, I just had reg. soy sauce so I added a grate of fresh ginger, and I used a bit less than a tsp. of curry paste as I find it a bit hot. My husband gave it 2 thumbs up and was disappointed that there was none left for his lunch today!

Big hit! Absolutely delicious and very easy. Instead of packaged vegetables, I used fresh and used zucchini and red bell pepper rather than carrots and celery. Skipped the flavored oil, but threw some garlic and fresh ginger in there.

Loved this dish! I have made it 5 times already. I first saute fresh minced garlic and ginger in peanut oil before adding Shitake mushrooms. I prefer fresh veggies to packaged veggies and in addition add red bell peppers to the mix along with zuchini, and roasted eggplant (which I add atop the dish once on the plate). I use a szechwan soy sauce, very spicy. I also substitute the shrimp for grilled salmon (also placed on plate once dish is complete, sauce is poured over fish. Mmmm delicious) I use red-curry paste and also throw some cashews atop the dish once complete. I leave out the green onions and top with basil instead, adds more flavor.

This was a great Thai dish, but I think I overdid the curry! Be careful, its spicer than you think. We spend 20 mins cooling our burning mouths! But ill definately make it again, just with less curry paste. I made it with red peppers, mushrooms,onions. It was really pretty too.

Sensational! Can't go wrong with this one. I made it half/half with shrimp & chicken and it was great. I'll definitely make it again and definitely make it when friends come for dinner.

We absolutely loved this recipe. I used sesame oil and red curry. I substituted the package of mixed-vegetables with water chestnuts, fresh snow peas, carrots, bean sprouts, red bell pepper, and shitake mushroom. I also used minced ginger instead of flavored soy sauce.

I have already made this recipe three times. For a fast, easy to fix dish, it is unbeatable! What seperates this dish from many other stir-frys is the delightfully light sauce. You need to try it.
