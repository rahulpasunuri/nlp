So good! Exactly followed the recipe except grilled on high with smoker on also did not make the asparagus. My parents who are fussy about their lamb said it was the best lamb ever.

I thought the flavors of this were fantastic and I definitely plan to make this again. It's a perfect entree for entertaining because all of the prep is done in advance. I made the recipe as written, except I used 4 garlic cloves (I loooove garlic) and didn't think that doing so overpowered the overall taste. The charmoula remained more of a paste-even after adding the olive oil, so that made it a bit more difficult to make sure all of the lamb was marinated and was coated evenly. Don't eliminate the extra 2T you reserve to drizzle after cooking. That lemon really adds to and enhances the lamb.

Easy and really, really tasty. And the asparagus was still slightly crisp with a wonderfully fresh taste from the shallot and lemon. You will want to pour the charmoula on everything; thank goodness we had some polenta for the extra!

One of the few 4 forks I've given. This recipe is so easy but produces incredible results. I always look to recipes as more suggestions than rules. I don't remember specifically what I did but I can pretty much guarantee that I at least doubled the spices and herbs. At about 11 minutes the oven began to visibly smoke and after 30-seconds of that I pulled them out of the oven and wow - perfection We were really lucky in that a sheep man locally had decided to take a lamb for the leg for his Easter and was glad to share the chops with us. The only downside was that we couldn't talk him out of the rack. LOL Make this. It's simple and our friends who came to Utah to celebrate with us put the overall meal at a $80-$90 range in a typical restaurant.

Wow! This is great! So flavorful! I think next time I may use just a shade less of the cumin seed as it was kind of powerful. My husband said something reminded him of tacos and if it stood out that much I think I need to make it fade a bit LOL! Other than that though, I think I just made the best lamb dish I've ever had.

Great recipe. My husband says this is the best lamb he's ever had at home. We cooked it medium rare as in the recipe & it turned out perfect!!

This recipe got a top 10 meals ever rating from my boyfriend and taster. I went even further out on a limb - I couldn't find cumin seeds at the store, so I roasted fennel seeds instead and it came out lush. Also - I didn't have time to marinate, so I used less oil and did it more as a rub. Can't wait to try again with the right ingredients and time!

I forgot to mention: lamb chops are too delicate for this charmoula--a more robust cut like the leg or shoulder would be better.

I suggest making the charmoula exactly as written (the toasted cumin seeds should not be replaced with ground). This was OUTSTANDING! Amazingly complex and delicious. This recipe was even better than charmoula as we were first introduced to it at the wonderful, now-defunct Brooklyn restaurant Oznot's Dish. There, charmoula was served as a spread on grilled lamb burgers (topped with Manchego cheese). This charmoula is great in that application as well!

I loved the charmoula! The lamb was great but the charmoula could be used on so many different things. Sorry, I know this is what everyone else wrote too but it's true! I'm not totally in love with the asparagus, it was good but not better than any other way I've prepared asparagus.

I had Charmoula leftover from another recipe and marinated it for only 1/2 hour but the lamb chops were to die for. I would use this way of roasing lamb chops again.

Made this for a dinner party last night and got RAVE reviews. Easy and yummy. Added extra garlic and paprika for a bit more kick. Left out the asparagus and made it with blue cheese gratin potatoes for a satisfyingly heavy meal for a cold night.

NOTE FROM A FOODIE: This is a GREAT dish for a beginner-level cook. You really can't muck it up. We chose this recipe at the last minute and didn't have time to marinate the lamb. But the AWESOMENESS of the charmoula pulled off a great dish. Amazing flavor. Followed the recipe to the "t" otherwise - it was perfect. Used New Zealand Lamb Chops from Trader Joes. Can't wait to pair up this great sauce with other meats. It's quite versatile.

Made this recipe on a whim tonight. Nice balance of Mediterranean flavours. Will definitely make the recipe again. I only had 1 hour to marinade, but it still tasted great. Decided to bbq everything instead of cook on the stove/oven. Worked like a dream.

I just started cooking in the past few months, using my wife as a taster. Some have been good, some not so good. When I made this recipe, and I followed it to the T, she didn't believe that I made it. It is truly excellent and I am making it again tonight!

This was wonderful. Did not have the cumin seeds, substituted a bit of ground cumin... Yikes, I know. But it turned out great all the same.

So good I made it 3 times in one week and each batch was incredible. Impresses your friends yet so easy to make. I loved it. Very flavorful and don't overcook your lamb.

We used this recipe for our Easter dinner. It couldn't have been better. Plenty of flavor and we didn't even use the extra dipping sauce that the recipe calls for. Marinated for 4 hours and that was perfect.

Absolutely delicious! I marinated the chops for only a few hours..but it didn't matter. It is lip smacking good...Could have doubled the Charmoula. I had 6 chops and would have liked a lot more sauce.Easy and once marinated, QUICK. Impressive result too

Wonderful flavor but could have just done half the Charmoula sauce for the servings suggested.

Love at first bite. This was not difficult to make and really flavorful. Served with a simple cous cous for a great meal. I highly recommend.

This is a good and simple recipe. I used a lamb london broil instead of the chops. Be careful not to leave it in the marinade too long. 8-12 hours is about right.

This was delicious! I didn't have any mint, nor shallot, but managed without. Definitely think mint would add to the flavor. I sort of combined this recipe with the grilled chamoula chops, but marinated this about 4 hours. Didn't want to grill as it was too cold outside!

Amazing! The charmoula brings such a unique and incredible flavor to the lamb. The asparagus was a light, subtle complement. And the Greek potatoes with the lemon viniagrette are yummy.

Amazing...charmoula is so yummy, and the asparagus was good too. I felt bad chopping it up into tiny pieces, but even my toddler loved it! I used the leftover charmoula on a bag of frozen shrimp for an appetizer for a potluck the next day and everyone loved them.

absolutely wonderful. Easy to make. The tastes were deep and interesting and so was the scent in my kitchen!! I was only able to marinate for 3 hours I can only imagine what happens after 24

This recipe is excellent! My change I grilled a boneless leg of lamb on our gas grill. My guests raved about it! And they loved the charmoula sauce served with it. I did also serve a jogurt sauce. The only change I would make would be to reduce the salt. I love salt but found this a bit much for my taste.

OUTSTANDING! I love too cook and am not afraid of a complex recipe, BUT---I'm all about the easy recipe that "tricks" guests into thinking I've been slaving. This is the one!I I used a whole, uncut loin (too lazy to cut) and followed these directions from another recipe from this website: Preheat to 400. Put lamb on a rack in a roasting pan and roast in middle of oven 30 to 40 minutes, or until a meat thermometer registers 125°F. for medium-rare or 130°F. for medium. Transfer lamb to a cutting board and let stand 10 minutes. OUTSTANDING!! Oh-did I mention that this was the best preparation I have ever had of asparagus? Even at Babbo (Mario Batali's).

This is easy and good. It's a nice change from the other method of indoor preparation I use for lamb chops (simply broiling them), The asparagus worked really well. I'll saute asparagus in a like manner on its own in the future.
