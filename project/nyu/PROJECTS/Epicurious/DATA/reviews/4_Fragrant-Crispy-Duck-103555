OK, it's a bit of trouble, but it's a wonderful preparation, and I'll definitely make it again. I held back from four stars because I really won't know how good it is until we can once again get true Sichuan peppercorns. Seems they are quarantined or somesuch and not currently available in this country. The dish is quite good without them, but I can't help but think that a seasoning like that would have a major impact on the final result. Meanwhile, I'll content myself to making it without. I served the duck with a sichuan style eggplant recipe from Pei-Mei and steamed rice. Yum.

Was quite impressed with this recipe, it was lovely. One tip if you don't have a wok ... I put the duck in my colander over boiling water and wrapped the top tightly with clingfilm, trapping the steam in. Worked just fine.

I baked the duck in an electric oven and it came out just fine .... nice and crispy.

Don't be put off by the long process - the steps are necessary to achieve the succulent, authentic flavors, and actual 'active time' is not a daunting as it would at first seem. I made this dish several years ago (from another source, but identical) as part of a New Year's Eve banquet, and have yearned for it ever since. With the Chinese New Year approaching, will definitely make it again from this recipe. Just bought a new domed lid for my old Calphalon wok for the occasion.

This is a fabulous dish. It requires a hot gas range to prepare it properly. After our first attempt on an electric range, my husband and I converted our home's heat source and the range to gas--this recipe being only one of several reasons. The result is a subperb presentation for our family and friends.

Absolutely fabulous. Not hard at all, just time consuming. Everyone raved about this dish. What I want to know is: why is an animal-lover even perusing duck recipes at this website? Is it just me, or is that screwy?

fair dinkum, here I sit overlooking a backyard containing one Muscovy drake and a couple of ducks about to go broody, and I have to read about some wombat sausage who doesn't like the idea of cooking a duck?
