This is a fruity version of a special cake (=torta in hungarian)invented by the famous hungarian confectioner Joseph C. Dobos in the 2nd half of the 19th century; it's a very popular dessert in the country still now. Although this is a fine one, a bit too sweet for me. The original is made with a lot of cocoa powder and melted semi-sweet chocolate, and got a very delicate sweet-and-bitter, creamy-crunchy taste, to which, I think, orange fits very well. So when developing, be brave with bitter ingredients, and maybe should not forget some more alcohol, preferably sherry or brandy or more Gran Marnier too.

This is a very rich and elegant dessert but is finicky and time consuming. I will definitely make this one again, but substitute the buttercream icing for an easier, less rich version.

Taking my cue from other reviewers, I made this recipe over several days (...a good thing, too, because my dog ate all nine layers so I had to make them over). I was anxious about working w/ such thin layers, but they were remarkably compliant. To cut down on the sweetness, I made citrus buttercream (see Sunshine Cake recipe) for the filling, and used the chocolate for the frosting. I don't think I would have had nearly enough frosting using one batch for both uses. If I make it again, I might try flavoring the caramel w/ orange as well. This turned out to be very dramatic--but again, VERY rich. I sliced it into 10 and would recommend slicing even thinner--say, 14. Despite the height of the cake, it cuts pretty easily.

The buttercream was much too sweet. I was hoping that this cake would be more like a baum kuchen. Not worth the effort.

This Cake was fabulous. Well worth the effort. It came out beautiful and rich! I definetely recommend following the preparation time guidelines so that you do not try to make everything on the same day. I think that substituting the chocolate buttercream with an easier buttercream would be acceptable . The recipe here certainly is a good one but time consuming. The cake is so rich that substituting with another icing would be ok. I was afraid when I was assemling the cake that it was going to be disasterous. However, once i topped the cake with the caramel layer and filled in the holes. It was beautiful! I also used toasted pecans instead of hazelnuts because I was unable to find them. I think hazelnuts would have been better but, the pecans were just as good.

I made this recipe for a friends birthday and it was wonderful. The only advice I have is to ignore the buttercream frosting recipe attached and to go with one you are sure of. I had to throw mine away and start over. I also only had one (!) cake pan available. It took so long to make the layers the batter lost a lot of volume and I had to make anothe batch, but it can be done. It is a beautiful torte and definitly a show stopper.

serve this TWO days after making the initial torte. the first day i served this, it was good but not great. the second day, it was fabulous. guess it gives it more time for the flavors to meld together.
