I prepared this recipe almost exactly as written. It was my first time making homemade gnocchi and it turned out great! It was much easier than I expected. I did pan fry the gnocchi in a little olive oil after boiling it. That extra step gives the gnocchi a wonderful golden color and a slightly crispy crust.

I think gorgonzola needs nutmeg and sage so I always add it.

I loved this gnocchi recipe because it was really uncomplicated. Microwaving the potatoes worked great. Instead of gorgonzola I substituted some flavored feta (tomato basil) I had on hand and it tasted great. I used half/half instead of cream in the sauce, which worked well. Also I coated the cooked gnocchi with some canned pesto I had before pouring on the cheese sauce. It was delicious and very satisfying!

This is my go-to recipe for gnocchi. I usually replace the black pepper with white pepper and I let the mashed up potatoes dry out for a bit before adding the flour. Every time I make them, I cut the gnocchi a little larger and every time they come out better than the last.

Okay, once this was on the table it was very good but there were some tense moments. Firstly, I don't know what I did but I seemed to have way too much flour and the dough wouldn't come together, it just kept crumbling. BUT, I muddled through that and made it work out. I also didn't boil these for nearly five minutes, more like 90 seconds and that seemed to work just fine. I scooped them out as soon as they floated to the top and migrated to the outer part of the pan. I did cut the gorgonzola down a little bit but it was still wonderful. I did add a little more grated nutmeg to the sauce. So, will make again but try with less flour.

I somehow messed up the gnocchi portion of the recipe, because the dough was too sticky and gluey to work. After reading other gnocchi recipes, I determiend it might be that I should have let potatoes cool more thoroughly before adding the egg and flour. I think the process may be a little more time intensive than the recipe suggests. The upside is the gorgonzola sauce was even better than I expected, and since I had to find a substitute dish for dinner very quickly, I cooked up a spaghetti squash and used the cheese sauce over it. The gnocchi disaster turned out a great alternative. The sauce and squash complemented well and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Will try to gnocchi again, but may use a different, more defined recipe.

The 3 cups of gorgonzola is way too overpowering a flavor. I fixed it for my family of 5, and I was the only one to finish my plate. The recipe could be improved, perhaps, using about 1/3 the cheese and combining with an Alredo sauce. The gnocchi did turn out well, though, so it wasn't a total loss.

I have made this recipe many times but it is quite heavy though delicious. I used store-bought gnocchi. Then once when I ran out of gnocchi, I made the same sauce and poured it over a pound of cooked penne. I substituted oriental garlic chives for regular chives and this has become our new favorite. It is a little lighter but still quite delicious.

The gnocchi was VERY easy and cheap to make. I didn't really like the sauce though I do like gorgonzola. I tried the gnocchi with tomato sauce and it was excellent!

I liked this dish however I thought the sauce was a bit too heavy. I didn't make the gnocchi instead bought some at Trader Joe's and it tasted fine. I added sauted mushrooms to the top with some toasted pine nuts.

The consistency of these gnocchi was perfect! Better than homemade gnocchi I have had in restaurants. I even caught my boyfriend sneaking leftovers from the fridge in the middle of the night. Keep this recipe handy and make with any of your favorite sauces. The gorgonzola sauce was very rich and delicious, but I would only suggest it to those who are big fans of Gorgonzola.

I should perhaps not comment since I didn't technically make this recipe. But I raided it for guidance on a pasta sauce with blue cheese. I used about 3 oz creamy blue cheese, 1/3 cup half and half, and about a Tbs of chives. Melted in a double boiler and served over bow-tie pasta with a tiny bit of parmesan. Awesome! Great flavor with no heaviness. And the chives--which is what is original here--made all the difference. We ate it very slowly to savor every bite.

This was delicious and easy to make. The sauce is delicious and I am not even that into Gorgonzola.

wonderful. Gorganzola is amazing, you must apprieciate it to love this dish. I had this same dish at one of the best restaurants in our city. This dish tasted almost exactly better. Store bought gnocchi's can be used, but it is definately better witht the homemade ones. store bought ones get gluey and extra heavy and chalky tasting. If you want to buy the gnocchi's go to an italian restuarant that sells their homemade pasta. Then your just buying someone elses homemade gnocchi's rather than those nasty grocery store frezzer packed ones. For the woman who's husband was washing hismouth out, try it without the asiego cheese. Asiego is very very stron cheese, it would overpower this dish and ruin it. I like asiego but amvery particular as to with what as it is very strong.

This dish is wonderful and easy. If you don't like gorganzola, please don't make this dish. It is heavy and rich, if you've even had any gnocchi's you know that is how there supposed to be. Best served as a side with something light. I served it with veal cutlets, amazing. Added garlic, always good.

FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't care if you make the gnocchi yourself or buy a good premade, either way the sauce is just absolutely divine and wonderful! You can feel your tastebuds just sinking into the velvety richness of the sauce, phenomenal and rich!

Between this recipe and other Gnocchi ones on this site, I repeatedly read reviews where people say they didn't make the gnocchi by hand,FINE. Rate the sauce then,not that they used store bought items,most of us are trying not to use premade items but make them from scratch as the recipe is written. Bad or Good recipe? Sorry, I'm not trying to offend anybody in particular

I only used the gorgonzola sauce part of this recipe. I love gorgonzola, but this sauce was really boring.

I don't understand the other reviews that talk about buying pre-made gnocchi. This is a terrific & fast recipe for making the gnocchi & they are far and away better tasting that frozen or vacuum packed. Also... of course the sauce is "cheezy" and "very heavy" it's gorgonzola! I don't think I ever saw a "lite" gorgonzola and you really don't make sauce with "a hint" of gorgonzola, at least I don't see why you would. I bought some imported gorgonzola made the gnocchi and it was terrific! Everybody loved it and it was a breeze to prepare BTW to the cook from San Mateo... keep trying... don't make little rings.... they are supposed to be "little pillows"... just flatten slightly with the back of a fork....

I did not make the gnocchi, I only used the GORGONZOLA SAUCE on some store bought gnocchi. The sauce was too heavy and lacked flavor. I like gorgonzola in other dishes, so it's not that I hate the cheese.

If you are looking for a quick, simple gnocchi recipe, this is a great one! I've had gnocchi many times but had never tried to make it before. I put it with my own version of the white bechamel sauce on this site, adding homemade pesto and about 1/2 cup gorgonzola. Light and tasty!

My advise is just to buy the gnocci in the package. That makes this just about the best recipe ever! Easy and extremely flavorful.

If you're even slightly ambivalent about gorgonzola, don't make this dish - the flavor is super-strong. I loved it, but my husband, who is not 100% sold on gorgonzola, took one bite and his face crimped up. I didn't add the chives, but I would next time to alleviate the heaviness a bit. I sprinkled Asiago over both servings and ran them under the broiler until slightly browned and bubbly. Comfort food.

Good, but I will continue to look for a recipe that produces a better texture (maybe The Best Recipe?). The sauce is very cheesy, but it's a must to give the gnocchi some more flavor. Next time, I will increase the nutmeg just slightly and decrease the flour, since the dough was quite dry. My guests suggested adding truffle oil next time, which I'm looking forward to trying. Instead of cutting pieces off a rope, forming individual ovals looks better, I think. I need to practice forming gnocchi more attractively, though!

This is a dish that's simple for a reason - there is no way you can improve on the wonderful, robust flavour of this traditional recipe! (The addition of chives is actually an innovation, but as stated by previous posters, adds a nice hint of garden fresh). For the poster whose husband had to wash his mouth out with soap...there's nothing wrong with the recipe, it's probably just not the dish for you. Next time stick to something milder! A perfect, simple, classic rustic dish.

If you think this recipe is bad, you probably just don't like gorganzola! This was so super easy and so delicious. The chives add just a touch of freshness to an otherwise heavy dish.

This recipe was awful as is. There was way too much gorgonzola, and I like gorgonzola. It was the only flavor you could taste in the dish. I added shrimp, which helped a little. The shrimp was really the only edible part. Plus, I actually found my husband rinsing his mouth out with water from the kitchen sink just to get the taste of this meal to go away! Now you know that's bad! I will be throwing this recipe away.

I made many changes to this. Gorgonzola is very strong..so (thanks) to the other chef who suggested mascarpone! I also combined the mushroom recipe. So I sauted a shallot, garilc then mushrooms. Added vermouth then chicken stock and fresh parsley I used heavy cream and fat free half and half. I used all the mascarpone and just a little gorgonzola to taste, white wine,dash of white pepper then at the end I added a little spinach chopped fine and just because I love them I added toasted pine nuts. yum! I will have to thicken the sauce and my gnocchi isn't so pretty so next time I'll try store bought and see which I like better.

EXCELLENT and easy. Particularly good for gorgonzola lovers. The fresh chives really add a nice touch. Note that if prepared as a main (instead of first) course, the portion is enough for 4 (we made it for the two of us and ended up freezing half the dough). Next time, I'm going to make a side of marinara to swirl with the gorgonzola sauce while eating.

Always a great combination. I use mascarpone, too, to smooth and cut the intensity of the cheese, a bit.

Delicious! Very easy to make....and soooooo good. The sauce is very cheesy. I served it as a "Primi" course for an Italian evening and it was perfect. I probably couldn't eat much in one sitting as it is so rich, so it is an excellent starter. Two of my guests had just had gnocchi in a very upscale restaurant in NYC. This was much better!!

I made this dish adding roasted garlic for a wine tasting. It was a huge success. Easy to make, all the while very impressive.

I served as a main. It was wonderful!! I didn't follow cheese sauce. I mixed a little melted butter and roasted garlic with the cheese and just melted together in microwave. I also left out the nutmeg. This is a great make ahead main or side. Make ahead and freeze.
