So good! I used regular bread crumbs and left out the sage. And I used only boneless skinless chicken breasts. Also added some honey to the mustard and butter mixture. I'll be making this many more times.

My son has Celiac disease so he has never eaten bread coated chicken until today. He loved it. I substituted country style bread with Glutino Gluten Free bread crumb& I also mistakenly added the butter and the mustard into the bread mix so I had to used 2 extra tablespoon of butter and one tablespoon of mustard mix to coat the chicken. It came out WONDERFUL! It was crispy and very tasty. I also added a bit more cheese. My husband gave me an 8/10 :)

This is my standby recipe when I need to prepare dinner for guests in a hurry. It is easy and you can do most of the cooking before everyone gets there. I always have people ask for the recipe. I usually use packaged whole wheat bread crumbs to save time. I only use chicken breasts. Nothing fancy but tasty and easy.

This is a great recipe. The butter with the mustard works beautifully. Usually I use mayonnaise for the moist undercoating, but this worked just as well with great flavor. I accidentally bought rosemary instead of sage, and it was delicious. I think varying the fresh herbs used in this would work beautifully. This recipe is going into my regular repertoire.

I used this recipe to make chicken parmesan and turned out great. I did use dried bread crumbs as that's what I had on hand and italian seasoning as I was going for the italian flavours. Also pan fried it and turned out moist and tasty. Will be making this one again and will try the oven method for comparsion.

For a spicier version, try adding ground black pepper and/or red chili flakes to the bread crumbs. It adds a nice kick! I did that and also added fresh rosemary and thyme to store bought breadcrumbs.

This was easy to make - great for a weeknight. Chicken has nice flavor but nothing extraordinary so I gave it three forks. I cut the amount of breadcrumbs in half and still had plenty to pitch afterwards.

This is a hit every time. I use skinless chicken thighs and panko for the bread crumbs. I've used fresh and dried sage both work fine. Easy and yummy, a great weeknight main course.

I've made this recipe 3 or 4 times and each time people love it. I use boneless, skinless chicken thighs. They work well because they stay moist and crispy in the oven.

Four weeknight forks. Perfect, easy, feel-good dinner. Didn't change anything. Served with leftover couscous salad and cucumber raita that I had on hand from the night before, and the yogurt was a really nice condiment. Took advice from another reviewer and used leftovers for sandwiches the next day: pita, sprouts, mayo. Very nice.

Delicious! I made a chicken cesar salad with this and it worked perfectly. Will make again

Just made this last night and it was a hit! It's really quick and easy, which is nice. And I almost always have the ingredients on hand, so it'll be a good "What do I do for dinner tonight?" recipe! I'm not a huge fan of mustard, but it suprisingly didn't taste really "mustardy". The mustard just gave it a nice flavor boost and kept the chicken juicy (I used spicy brown mustard, because that's what I had). After reading that some people had sticking problems, I spritzed the foil with Pam, and it only stuck a tiny bit, no big deal. All in all, for flavor, ease, and versatility, it's a great recipe.

Good and easy. My nine year-old daughter had a sleepover the night I prepared this, and even fairly picky little girls enjoyed it. (Although they rejected my roasted bread salad as "too crunchy". You can't win 'em all....) Anyway, boneless breasts prepared with this recipe also make good sandwich material: some rustic bread, arugula, mustard or sage mayonnaise.

What a great recipe and very easy to make! Didn't expect too much, given the simplicity and the preparation and ingredients, but the flavor is really superb - used skinless boneless chicken breasts and kind of made a paste, smeared it on, and cooked as directed. Wonderful! Has become a staple recipe in our house.

Great and simple recipe. Even though I generally do not like chicken, I liked this recipe. I used Italian bread crumbs, which made it even simpler. I also pounded the chicken for greater tenderness.

I've made this 4 times in the last three weeks as my husband loves the taste and i love how easy it is to make. i've made this as the recipe says and i've also made it as a chicken parmesan, with a side of spaghetti. i added some fresh chopped basil along with the sage in the breadcrumb mixture. made my own spaghetti sauce, put it over the already baked chicken, topped it with mozzarella cheese, and broiled until the cheese melted/browned. it was great!

This is a great, quick, very tasty recipe which I deviated from just slightly. I substituted Rosemary Leaves for Sage and only used boneless chicken breasts. I also pounded the chicken breasts before sauteeing them vs. baking them. Great taste - I'll definitely prepare chicken this way again!

I used Italian bread crumbs from the can and did not have any fresh sage leaves...used Herbes de Provence and my family loved it. This is great for a quick week night dinner - nothing fancy - but lots of flavor and juicy.

Like previous reviewers, made recipe with boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Cooked for 25 minutes on cooking stone instead of baking sheet which eliminated the sticking problem other reviewers mentioned. The chicken was surprisingly moist and the flavor was very good. Will definitely be a regular weekday meal. In the future, I will try suggestions made by other reviewers.

I made his recipe last night and it was quite good. I used Italian Seasoned bread crumbs and added the fresh sage to that. Couldn't taste the sage at all. So, if using seasoned crumbs I would just pump it up with more parsley, basil and don't forget the parmesan. If using plain crumbs certainly add the sage and I'm sure you would be able to taste it. I did make this recipe with the butter as it called for, but quite frankly you can do without the butter and just coat the chicken with mustard and then cover in bread crumbs. I have done this many times before and the results were delicious. Still very moist and tasty. Oh, and for the sticking problem? There is this terrific new product out "Reynolds Non-Stick Foil". It works like a charm and I would never be without it!

Thoughtit was good and easy to make. It could have used a little more kick to it. I probably would add more sage. I also only used skinless/boneless chicken breasts and baked them for 30 minutes at 350.

yum yum yum! I added some lemon juice to the mustard butter sauce and cut 3 breasts into about 14 somewhat thin pieces. I needed more breading to bread that many pieces, but it was really delicious that way. I served with the red pepper garlic sauce from "chicken with red bell peppers" (on this site) which I highly recommend. The combination of that sauce with this chicken is a four forker!

This recipe rates 4-forks based on ease, flavor and versatility. Before preparing this recipe, I recommend that you read all the wonderful ideas from the previous reviewers - you'll get many more ideas. I followed others suggestions and used skinless boneless chicken thighs and dried bread crumbs. The variety of spices [fresh or dried] you can use are incredible. Like the reviewer from Houston remarked - this is not gourmet, but truly a dependable quick, easy & tasty standby. ENJOY!

I made this for dinner tonight. Did not have fresh sage and used fresh taragon instead. Also used honey dijon mustard. The chicken was moist and had enough pizazz to be really good. I will definitely make this again when looking for an easy way to cook boneless chicken breasts.

I needed a last minute recipe for boneless chicken breasts that was easy to make and that I would already have the ingredients for. This was the perfect solution. I substituted spicy brown mustard for the dijon and it tasted just fine.

I make this time and time again, it's so easy and so versatile. I've always used boneless chicken thighs and the fresh bread crumbs, but I may try the Panko suggestion in a previous review. This makes a good, lower fat Texas favorite--chicken "fried" steak with cream gravy. I bake it at a higher temperature in a well seasoned iron skillet. There are enough drippings and crunchy bits to make a good cream gravy with low fat milk. Only your arteries and hips can tell the difference!! Maybe not a gourmet recipe, but one dependable standby that will always be in my repertoire.

I can't believe how easy it was! I used several substitutions to give it a mexican food twist: Asiago cheese instead of parmesan, Cumin, Chili powder and red-pepper flakes instead of sage, and country style dijon instead of dijon. I mixed sour cream and green salsa for to make a dipping sauce. Mmmmmm, good.

This was very good. I've made it using dry bread crumbs, and occasionally without the cheese as well, and it is still moist and flavorful. The dijon really makes it!

I have been making a similar dish for years. I also add Italian Seasoning and a couple teaspoons of feta cheese to the crumb mixture. I have enjoyed this coting on both bone-in chicken and boeless breasts.

I was disappointed with this recipe, especially since I had read all the great reviews before I made it. I found it rather boring - not any better than some of the Shake and Bake coatings I have used in the past. I couldn't even taste the Parmesan cheese. I guess the search continues for a good coated chicken recipe....

This was a real easy dish to make that you can tailor to you tastes just by adding whichever spice you desire. I served it with buttermilk ranch mashed potatoes and steamed corn. If you have very little time and feel like being creative with spice (I added paprika, nutmeg, and oregano) this is the dish.

Excellent! The 1st recipe Ive tried for skinless chicken that is breaded, baked & still tastes sinfully good! And so easy!

We LOVED this! I used boneless, skinless thighs because we like dark meat, and I added some corn meal to the seasoned bread crumbs I had left over from a stuffing recipe. It's like the fried chicken you always wish you had the time and inclination to cook!! BIG SUGGESTION: spray the foil with oil before you bake. That said, this is a winner.

I didn't like the texture of the fresh breadcrumbs. It tasted bready rather than crispy. I think it would have been better using dry breadcrumbs.

This is a great after-work dinner. Also, I've tried a variety of crumbs (crouton crumbs, cornbread crumbs, etc.)I've yet to find one that really didn't work, so it's very forgiving and allows you to use whatever bread is becoming stale. Serve with a baked potato, side salad, and glass of white wine - all the bases are covered!

It was very simple to make, and the directions were very precise. I substituted the dijon mustard with a mixture of spicy brown and zesty honey mustard, and substituted the parmesan and sage with basil, oregano, thyme, marjoram, and rosemary, seasoned to taste. (Were out of parmesan and sage.) We both thought it was excellent.

Very good. I used 4 skinless boneless chicken breasts. If you use more chicken I would double the butter/dijon sauce but not the breadcrumbs. I would definitely make this again and for company this time. I served it with the orzo pilap with green onions and parmesan cheese recipie from this site. Excellent as well.

Easy, quick, and tasty. I agree with the person who said you need to grease the foil in some manner. Next time I might use a tad more sage. I used 4 breasts instead of breasts & legs -- good fail-safe recipe for company.

Very moist and tasty alternative to regular deep fried chicken. Since we cook without salt in our home we were pleased that the fresh parmesian and sage really enhanced the flavor. Will make it again, and for large groups like reunions and potlucks! Great Stuff!

This is a healthier alternative to fried chicken. In place of the bread crumbs I used panko, which is a japanese bread flake. I also substituted half of the parmesan with romano cheese and a few shakes of garlic powder. The dijon mustard added zest. I served the chicken with sides of roasted garlic mashed potatoes and steamed green beans amandine. A nice simple dinner. Two simple, but important things that weren't mentioned in the recipe is to butter or oil your baking sheet to prevent sticking, and also turn the chicken mid-way during baking.

This is a great recipe and I've made it several times since it appeared. Very easy to prepare and tasty enough to serve company. The dijon mustard I used has a bit of a kick to it. Make your bread crumbs from a quality pugliese bread. Yummm.
