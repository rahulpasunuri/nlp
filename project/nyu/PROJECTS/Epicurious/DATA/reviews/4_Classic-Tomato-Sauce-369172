Added some chopped green peppers and mushrooms to the sauce for extra flavor (and needing to use them). Best part about a good basic sauce is that you can tweak it to your liking

Very good! I made this and then pulled a can of Hunt's tomato sauce out of the pantry to compare the two. Obviously, this recipe won hands down but what struck me was how "chemical" the canned variety tasted. This was pure and smooth and flavorful.

Really great basic tomato sauce. As stated, the key is to sweat the onions and simmer long and low. Made it a few days ahead so flavors could marry. Also made meatballs and they were fantastic.
