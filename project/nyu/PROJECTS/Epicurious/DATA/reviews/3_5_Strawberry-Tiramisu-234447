This was a delicious, fresh spring take on regular tiramisu. I served it Mother's Day after (home smoked)pulled pork sandwiches and even the kids loved it... Can't wait to have leftovers tonight.

when will i learn to make recipes as written, rather than trusting comments? i went light on the cointreau in this dish (probably used about 2/3 the recommended amount) and it was just a faint hint of sweet orange flavor - no more boozy than vanilla extract. could definitely have stood the full amount. due to the shape of my dish (trifle) i ended up with three layers of ladyfingers and still only used about half the recomended quantity - fyi to those who might want to try it in a trifle dish. the resulting presentation was beautiful! i am looking forward to eating the leftovers in the next day or two, as tiramisu` usually improves with age! (and for the record, i didn't find it to be just an expensive strawberry shortcake variation. i guess that's in the eye, taste, and wallet of the beholder...)

My husband loved this as did our guests. I think the quality of the strawberry preserves is important. Also, next time will go lighter on the Cointreau.

i have made this three times this summer and each time it was different. the first time i used triple sec in place of the cointreau, but the strawberries i used were EXCEPTIONAL and i also used my own homemade jam from said exceptional strawberries. it was AMAZING! the second i time i made it, i was in norway and wanted to make it for a wedding. i couldn't find lady fingers anywhere, so i substituted sponge cake layers that i let dry a bit. the strawberries weren't great and i used store bought jam. i did however procure some cointreau. it turned out ok. the third time was for a bridal shower. had the cointreau, lady fingers, store bought jam and very average strawberries. it was delicious, but nothing compared to the first one i made. honestly, i think it all boils down to the strawberries and jam that are used. i did like the cointreau better than the triple sec, but honestly it wasn't THAT great an improvement. the strawberries made a much more marked difference.

This is an excellent recipe except for the alcohol. I made half with grand marnier and half with just the whipped cream mixture for the children. The adults preferred the childrens version over the adult version. It was too overpowering. I give it four stars without the alcohol.

Rating: 2
Conceptually a great dessert. The amount of alcohol however was too great and took over all of the other flavors. I would possibly make this again but would not use the Cointreau. I could barely taste the mascarpone or the orange flavor itself. A minority of my guests enjoyed this...the rest ate the other desserts.

Inedible. Followed recipe exactly as written, could only taste Cointreau. A waste of strawberries and mascarpone.

Oh MY!!! Divine. We made our own strawberry preserves and went light on the sugar. I wanted more of a tart taste instead of sweet taste. Was not able to find the crispy Ladyfingers, so used the soft, which turned out fine. We made this for a large dinner event. We charges $20.00 for the meal that was very elaborate. A gentleman said to us as he handed the money over, The dessert alone was worth every penny. ;-)

Great taste, followed directions exactly. But for the cost of ingredients, it's basically a fancy strawberry shortcake. Won't make again, too many other options out there to try.

Rating: 2
I had this only a few hours after I made it, but mostly I just tasted the preserve. Also too much cream diluted the mascarpone. It did help that I added the zest of 1 orange instead of the liqueur. I think if I were to make this again I might add some balsamic vinegar to add depth and cut the sweetness. However, overall it's an expensive recipe for not enough yield in flavor.

Ten forks! This has been a wonderful staple to the recipe box. I've made it at least six times in as many months and get rave reviews each time! It makes a very elegant presentation in a crystal dish and packs well in a more practical large lunchbox. The dessert also keeps quite well as leftovers (a very rare occassion indeed!). Strawberries are a favourite, and I add blueberries if they're available. Have also made a mango and peach version (with mango vodka -- though the alcohol didn't come through too well; the cointreau is better). Have used all manners of conserves - marmalade, apricot, strawberry, etc. A definite keeper and a star!

I can't believe so many reviewers did not like this dessert! I find it exceptional and so have all those who have tried it (a large group at a ladies' luncheon and last year's Fourth of July family dinner). I followed the recipe faithfully both times and both times this Tiramisu was superb.

Deeee-licious! Everyone loved this. It was still wonderful two days later, too. I don't know how many pounds of strawberries I used- I had two full quarts and used almost all of them. In my opinion, there's no such thing as too many strawberries. I think next time I make it I would use a trifle dish, too.

Apropos the comments by n1cf and chefjeff  have you noticed that there also seems to be a direct correlation between the number of items changed in the recipe and the number of spelling errors in the reviews? In any case, I followed the recipe exactly, and all I can say is that of the 10 desserts at the potluck dinner I made it for, the tiramisu was the first one that was gone (rather quickly !) and got the most rave reviews - though some people called it a trifle and others strawberry shortcake - but then again - a rose by any other name....

Not worth the time effort and expense. Even though I used more strawberries then called for still wasn't enough. Very bland tasting and hated the presentation. Next time I'll stick with strawberry shortcake like the family wanted.

My dinner guests liked it. I didn't! presentation: dollop of whip cream, fanned strawberry, chocolate shavings, looked great! However, I wouldn't make it again despite it being very easy, it was very dependent on the quality of strawberries, the ingredients were expensive, it lacked intensity, and a bit too heavy with the mascarpone.

a little extra tip (though probably not child-friendly): add a little bit of veeery finely chopped basil to the strawberries and let it all soak for a while before putting it into the dish. The basil gives it an amazing taste! yuummm!!=)

It was not bad, but not great either. Too much preserves for me, and the cheese mixture was too heavy (I expected it to be more fluffy, like in real tiramisu).

This was so easy! I followed the recipe but couldn't find crisp ladyfingers anywhere, so I just used the soft kind and figured it wouldn't have to sit as long. I was right.

Loved this! I used skipped all of the alcohol and used OJ in it's place. Used 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 marscapone. Next time i will pipe on whipped cream and top with strawberries for a more attractive finish. This is a simple, non-bake dessert that adult and kids loved equally.

I thought this was a nice change to regular tiramisu (and the best recipe for that is the one from Gourmet in 2003). I would use a little less Cointreau and more orange juice and add some zest. It was certainly good the way it was.

I am planning to make this for our Christmas dinner and I will rate it later. I just had to comment on the 'ChefJeff' comment, which put a smile on my face. I am often amazed by the ridiculous modifications described by cooks on this site, e.g., "The recipe called for duck, but since: (1)I am not fond of duck (2)oranges give me severe heartburn (3)I am on a diet and (4)I am extremely health conscious...I substituted chicken for the duck, strawberries for the oranges, dried lemon peel for the orange zest, grape jelly for the orange marmalade, apple juice for the orange liqueur, and corn oil margarine for the butter. Since the result was perfectly dreadful and none of my guests could eat it, I can't even give this recipe one fork!!!" More to follow.

I have made this recipe twice. The first time, the only change I made was to reduce the liquier to 2 Tablespoons mixed with the straberry jam, then continued as written. I served 18 people and it was enough, with raves from everyone. The second time I made it I used sweet orange marmalade instead of strawberry jam (I don't like strawberry jam and I found it an over-powering flavor). Again I got rave reviews. I took this one to a recipe party and everyone took a copy. I used the crisp lady fingers and it was not soggy. This is a keeper.

I loved this dessert. It was not hard to make, and for the summer mounths it is great, because you do not have to bake it and it is very refreshing. I used Grand Marnier with the Jam and Schloss Kirsch with orange extract in the cream and cheese, instead of Mascarpone I used cream cheese because of the high price of Mascarpone right now. It turned out great, everyone loved it. My sister-in-law, who likes the treditional Tarimasu is having me make it for her Daughters baby show. Because it is not the most attractive dish, I top it off with whip cream, and I used a #96 decorating tip around the edges, then toped that off with a few strawberries cut in half and faned them out and used a little mint leaves for colour. I had people who do not drink liquer at all loving this dish. Try it, you will love it. You have to let it sit over night to come out right.

I made this for the dessert course for my wife for our anniversary dinner. It was nice because it could be made a day ahead (has to be). It was exceptional! I made it exactly as described with no subsitutions (w/ Cointreau). The lady fingers were perfect consistency the next day when we had it. I probably should have halved the recipe as this made enough for 10 people. (We're still eating it.) I agree with the other reviewer who said it's not the most attractive dish. To make it look nicer I made some extra whipped cream before serving for the top and decorated with lots of fresh strawberries on top, sliced and miniature ones too. Also, powdered sugar and a mint leaf. Next time I'll use a smaller pan and make more layers. (Only two layers were possible in a 13x9x2 pan.)

I made this first thing Sunday morning and served after Monday noon meal and was satisfied with results. Due to reading other reviews, I rolled the cookies in the jam mixture before placing them in the pan to ensure that they would soften all around, and that worked well. The dish size stated (13 x 9 x 2) was too small for the number of cookies stated; I used a larger dish but still fewer cookies. Increased jam, juice, and liquor as much as I had ingredients on hand to do so, and that worked well. To me, the jam mixture also seemed a bit too sweet for the rest of the ingredients, but everyone at work raved about it. Next time I will probably try to find jam such as "just fruit" and use that in place of, or mixed half and half with, the regularly sweetened jam. Overall, the result was very pleasing, but also higher (taller) than the picture displayed. Perhaps the ladyfingers I found were larger than the ones used in testing.

This got rave reviews from our friends. The only changes I made were: Used soft lady fingers from Trader Joes (couldn't find the hard ones without chasing to four different stores.) And I used Amaretto after tasting three different liquers and deciding that would taste the best. It was excellent. A great warm weather alternative to regular tiramisu.

Rating: 3
I have to change my earlier review - sorry. It went from 2 to 3 forks, because, strangely enough, it really improves with age. And I am impressed that the ladyfingers magically turned into something resembling white cake, with the liquer and cream mixture. I definitely recommend making it several days -- even three - ahead of serving, as it just gets better and better.

Delicious and very easy to make. I made a half recipe in an 11 x 7 inch pan, except I used as many ladyfingers as would fit in the pan. Turned out great, and would likely serve 8. Light but rich all at once!

This actually gets 2.5 forks. I didn't understand what all the fuss was, but then I couldn't find the mascarpone at the grocery store (first time I needed it, of course) so I had to use cream cheese. I had no problem with "too soggy" or "too crunchy" or whatever - in fact the texture was perfect. I actually misread the recipe and put half of the preserve mixture on the bottom. Was worried the ladyfingers on bottom would be squishy and the ones on top would be too hard, but the top ones were perfect and the bottom ones, though soft, tasted okay. My kids loved it. I guess they'd give it three forks. I also used Triple Sec which I think should be okay (rather than Cointreau or Grand Marnier). Did not notice an alcholic taste. It actually wasn't too hard to make but didn't look anywhere near as beautiful as the photo.

Well- - -after reading a few reviews, let me offer some loving and patient advice- - -First off, all of you wonderful home cooks- - -READ the recipe- - -buy the ingredients that the recipe calls for- - -don't make your own lady fingers- - -don't buy soft lady fingers. Don't change up or change down the amounts of anything- - -Sorry for shouting, but FOLLOW THE RECIPE as written. Nine of us, sharing a very warm father's day 2006 evening, all LOVED this recipe- - -it was perfection.

I made this exactly as written and thought it turned out fabulous! It was sweet, but not too much so, and very light. Unlike other reviewers, I did not find the flavor to be too "muddy" nor did I find the Cointreau over-powering. In fact, I could barely taste the liqueur at all - it seems to only have intensified the flavor of the fresh strawberries. I ended up having to make my own lady fingers from scratch (from a wonderful recipe in "The Joy of Cooking") because trips to 3 different grocery stores yielded absolutely no lady fingers of any form. That part was time consuming but worth the effort. Even 2 days after making the dessert it's still not too soggy. I served it for my husband and a dinner guest and between the 3 of us we ate half of the whole pan! So, they definitely enjoyed it too. We enjoyed a 375ml bottle of Quady Vineyards Elysium Black Muscat along with the dessert and found it to be an excellent pairing. I will most surely make this recipe again!

This was a wonderful new twist on tiramisu. I cut the recipe in half and made it in one layer in an 8X8 pan. Everyone loved it so much, I'm sorry that I didn't make the whole recipe! It was even better after a few days in the fridge. Will definitely make this one again.

Attempted to follow recipe faithfully but used Gran Marnier rather than Cointreau and my grocery store only had Bruno's Giant Ladyfingers which were dry but large so estimating number required was difficult. I'm cooking for two so halved all the quantities to the best of my ability based on previous comments. Had no problem with liquid content...not overly liquid on the third day and the ladyfingers softened nicely. Did find the strawberry preserves overly sweet and think I might try again with more fresh lightly sugared and pureed berries instead of the preserves. Very tasty and I'll make again.

While the cream mixture was good, the preserves layer was way too sweet for my liking. It distracted rather than enhanced the fresh strawberries. Probably won't make this again.

This recipe was good, but a bit too sweet for me. I did do some substituting though.

I made this recipe on Sunday morning for supper and the biscuits were still crispy. I think more jam/cointreau is necessary to moisten the biscuits and definately half the recipe. I found it way too sweet for my taste and will probably use a sugar reduced jam next time and unsweetened orange juice. I think dipping the biscuits in an orange juice/cointreau mixture to soften them before hand would help if I was making the recipe for the same day.

I made this yesterday for a Mother's Day brunch today... and it got raves. I had no Cointreau or OJ... so I omitted them completely. Since I've made Tiramisu before I figured (and it turns out correctly) that the cheese/whipped cream mix would soften the savoiardi biscuits enough. It is important to make this a day ahead. This will become my spring time go-to dessert. Next time I'm going to use a mix of berries.

I will assume it is not a joke that someone is asking how to hull a strawberry and is it necessary. The answer would be YES.. All hulling a strawberry means taking out the green top that accompanies fresh strawberries, and taking out a little bit of the core. Hope this helps...

To Maria from El Cerrito, CA. You suppose to STIR some (1/4) of the whipping cream mixture into the mascarpone mixture to lighten the mascarpose so it becomes easier to FOLD IN the rest of the whipping cream. At the end you will have just one mixture. Hope that I helped.

To answer Maria's question: Whenever you are mixing a heavier item into whipped cream, you always start by folding in a little of it, otherwise you will "flatten" the whipped cream. So to clarify the last sentences of the first paragraph: "Stir 1/4 of whipped cream mixture into mascarpone mixture to lighten. Fold remaining whipped cream into the marscapone mixture."

Maria: first you fold the 1/4 of the whipped cream mixture into the mascarpone (to lighten it). then you fold the remaining 3/4 of whipped cream into the "mascarpone + 1/4 of whipped cream" mix.

A lovely dessert, and one I grew up with in the Midwest. We called it "ice box cake", never having heard of tiramisu, and used all whipped cream, never having heard of mascarpone! I think this should be refrigerated for at least 24 hours to moisten the ladyfingers consistantly and create that special texture. Can also be made and decorated with fresh, sweet peaches.

I shouldn't rate the recipe yet as I just saw it and plan to make it this weekend. By I had a question for you folks who've made it - in the first paragraph, the last sentence says "fold in remaining whipped cream". Do I fold this into the mascarpone mixture or into the whipping cream mixture? Sorry if it sounds dumb, I just couldn't figure it out from the sentence. Thanks for your help!

This is a great recipe! Yes, it is easy to make and a wonderful treat. One caution thought--it serves a lot more than 8 people--I would say 12 servings is more like it.

I found the recipe so easy to follow my 14 year old son made it. It came out great and we now have a new tradition for Easter or anytime.

I've made this version of Giada's strawberry tiramisu and her raspberry version - in both versions I only had Grand Marnier on hand and it was absolutely wonderful and super simple to put together. If decent fresh strawberries are hard to find, use a good quality frozen...it worked out just a well.

I thought this was good and easy to make, however I would describe it more as Italian Strawberry Shortcake. I also agree that increasing the preserve mixture is a smart move.

I have made this twice already (once in a trifle to increase the beauty of the presentation) and I passed the recipe along to a friend who also made it to rave reviews. You should definitely make it a day in advance. I would recommend doubling the preserve, cointreau, orange juice mixture to really moisten the lady fingers - I did this the second time I made it and it was even better than the first time. Everyone has loved it!

Made this a day ahead for Easter deessert. Was loved by all! I think next time I will add 1/2 C. orange juice for more liquid and make 2 days ahead to really soften the lady fingers. I bought high quality ingredients and I am sure this made the difference.

Very light tasting. Appropriate for spring and summer. I would make it at least two days in advance for the lady fingers to fully soften.

I made this for Easter dinner and it was wonderful. Not too heavy after a big meal. A few people thought it could use a few more strawberries, but I thought the amount was right on.

I made this for Easter dessert, it looked nice but just wasn't very good. I followed the recipe, made it a day ahead of time and everything. It was dry and there wasn't nearly enough strawberry flavor. The strawberry preserves just tasted like strawberry preserves. No one in my family finished theirs. I wouldn't recommend this at all.

Made this for Easter dinner, and it was a big hit. I substituted Splenda for sugar and used a jar of strawberry preserves made with Splenda due to a guest who is having to watch her sugar intake, and it still came out good (although I would prefer "the real deal"). The only change I would make the next time is to decrease the amount of Cointreau used by just a bit, maybe by 1/4 or 1/3, as I found it just a bit strong. The ladyfingers softened up perfectly when I made the dessert a day ahead and let it sit in the fridge.

I could not find Mascarpone at my store so I used Whipped Cream Cheese and it was delicious and still had the taste we were looking for.

I thought this was excellent overall. Made it for Easter dinner dessert. We are not "liqueur" people and I got sticker shock at the price of Cointreau, so I went with Grand Marnier instead, since I could buy a smaller bottle and not spend $35. It was a little strong. I added the full amount of G.M. to the strawberry preserves, but cut back on the amount in the mascarpone and whipped cream. If I were to do it again, I would halve the amount in the preserve mixture as well, though it did add a nice little "kick".

Very tasty and easy. I had to prepare this 2 days in advance and it was great! One note: next time I make it I will add a few extra tablespoons of Cointreau! Yum

This was one of those recipes that I couldn't wait to make. Of course it was super easy and made a big hit with the family. Maybe next time we'll have it with raspberries.

This was great! Made it for a dinner party and everyone really enjoyed it. It is easy to prepare and definitely benefited from sitting in the fridge overnight. I am looking forward to making this again.
