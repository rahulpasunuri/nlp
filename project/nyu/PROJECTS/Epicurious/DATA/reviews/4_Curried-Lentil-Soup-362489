This soup was quick and easy to make, lent itself well to modifications (I threw in a couple handfuls of barley and kasha and substituted hummus for the chickpeas/lemon juice) and got rave reviews from my husband and our guests. Yum.

i found this recipe bland. i had to add extra lemon,cherry tomatoes, black pepper, cumin, and garnish with cilantro and a dollop of greek yogurt to get it where i wanted it to go. my husband did enjoy it then very much. i used red lentils and perhaps they don't hold up as well as the green. if i were to make it again i'd use the above plus fresh ginger and extra garlic too, the humus is quite tasty though. i think i'll search for another recipe.

Very tasty and good texture with the green onions. My jar of hot curry powder turned out to contain only one tablespoon, so I added 1 teaspoon ground cumin; 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander; 1/4 teaspoon turmeric; 1/4 teaspoon cayenne; and 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, and it turned out very well. The spices (and amounts) that I added, other than the curry powder and the ground ginger, are from the Indian Spiced Cauliflower and Potatoes recipe on Epicurious, which I highly recommend.

Oh My! I believe this may have just become my new favorite soup. Pretty easy and incredibly flavorful (and actually very inexpensive!) I couldn't find french green lentils so I used indigo that I found at Whole Foods. Maybe the french would be better but this came out fabulous!!!

Best lentil soup ever. I made some changes based on what I had on hand. Used chicken broth, no carrot, 2 small potatoes instead of chick peas. I was short on curry powder so I threw in some leftover homemade curry sauce from a previous meal (which had coconut milk, fish sauce, lemongrass), or a bit of bottled curry sauce also works. I have used TJs yellow curry sauce. Tossed in some pastrami bites and awesomeness ensued.

I loved the idea of pureeing chickpeas instead of adding cream. I did make some changes. I used 2 cups of chicken broth & 2 cups of vegetable broth, added about 1/2 cup finely chopped (leftover) ham and pancetta from the freezer, and a healthy squeeze of tomato paste (about 2 TBS).

This has to be the BEST Lentil Soup I've ever made. I didn't catch the reviews in time to discover that it needed more flavor. So, instead of chicken stock and salt, I added Tony Chauchere's Creole Seasoning, (which is flavorful, not spicy). I used chopped white onion and one chopped fresh garlic for the topping instead of scallions. Mine needed the butter for flavor. I also tossed in some cooked Basmati rice. YUM.

I made this exactly as written and I think it was terrible (and I cook alot of curried things). It's looks terrible too. The pureed garbanzo mixture looks bad against the whole lentils. I pureed it, added cumin, and that made it palatable. Best to just stick with Egyptian Lentil soup recipes which are similar, but made with the little red lentil that fall apart w/o pureeing, and has a better, though related flavor.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! The flavor is so amazing. I'm a vegan so I substituted the butter for margarine and used vegetable stock instead of water to make the flavor a bit richer. I chopped up parsley to add on top along with the scallions. I also covered the pan for the last 15 minutes of cooking to be sure the lentils would be ready. My entire family had many helpings. This is a winner!!

It turned out exactly as it looks in the picture! (a very rare occurrence with me), and it tastes delicious. Reminds me of Indian curries. this would go excellently with a bowl of rice or chapati even.

I didn't have lemon juice, but I made everything else exactly as the recipe says. So glad I discovered this.

Well, my girlfriend and I love dipping stuff. So, we decided to reduce the water by half! Results = AMAZING! We added a kale salad mix and salted buttered tortillas with a hint of garlic...powder. AND the consistancy was simpily delightful. I would like to quote myself here "it tastes like it came from a restaurant". RIGHT!? Highly recommend this recipe, likely a new staple.

Love love love this. Definitely a keeper. I did make a few adjustments. Chicken stock instead of water as suggested by other reviewers, but then also didn't add any extra salt. Kept the carrot ratio as written, but added some celery. Didn't add the butter at all. So good!

the humus you make for this soup gives it a wonderful creaminess. we started the recipe by sautéeing two strips of bacon with the onions for added richness. the green onions are a must. will definitely make this again!

Great recipe to start with. I gave this my own twist with the following changes/additions: - added butternut squash to the vegetables for sweetness and texture - additional seasoning such as turmeric, thyme and cumin - i used an immersion blender to puree the vegetables a little bit - i did not puree the chickpea separately.. by using the immerson blender, I was able to keep some of them whole - i added tofu and some parsley towards the end - i also added some red chili pepper for heat This was even better on the second days after all of the spices got absorbed.

Rating: 4
Really delicious. I used a spicy curry, so I kept it to 2 tbsp, but I double the garlic and quadrupled the carrots. I added cubed smoked ham because I had it on hand, and it was a good addition. I also used a mixture of red and green lentils, which worked fine. And it's even better the next day!

Shocked at all the amazing reviews. Relatively easy, and chock full of veggies, but not a great soup at the end of the day. I did use extra garlic and curry, and I even added a little cayenne, but in all the flavors were just okay. I did use mild curry powder (and if were to do it again, would use a spicier curry, as perhaps that would have made it tastier.)

I was looking for a fall soup recipe that had a kick to it and this is definitely it! Per others suggestions I doubled the amount of curry powder and the amount of garlic. I also like my soup a bit chunkier so I added about 1 cup of chopped carrots instead of just using the 1 medium. Also, I used two cups of chicken broth and two and a half cups of water instead of just water. I have already made this twice, to rave reviews and plan on adding it to my fall/winter soup repetoire.

Rating: 3
this is a very good recipe although i was a little let down after reading all the fantastic reviews. I doubled the carrot and there still could have been quite a bit more, it's a sea of lentils. i would have liked more chunks of vegetables, maybe potato as well. it's very yummy but the flavor could be a little more complex. I had to cook the lentils twice as long as it says and they were still a bit crunchy. I wouldn't skip the butter, it adds a lot.

Rating: 4
This soup is flavorful, pungent and very satisfying. It's a party in your mouth. I reduced the butter to 1 Tbsp to make it healthier. I also cooked the carrots longer than called for to soften. Other than these small changes I followed the directions as written. I'm hoping my kids will love it as much as I do!

This soup was tasty! I used a mix of brown and red lentils, since that's what I had, and I used chicken broth instead of water. I also used about half the amount of chickpeas, again because its what I had in the cupboard. And I added two stalks of chopped celery. Unfortunately I was using a new extra spicy curry powder and although I added less than the recommended amount, the soup still turned out REALLY spicy. I am sure it was my curry powder, but I figured I'd put out a warning to others to test the spiciness as you go! I served the soup with full fat greek yogurt the I mixed some chopped mint into, and this tempered the spiciness enough for us to enjoy it.

Rating: 4
I followed other reviewers and doubled the amounts of curry and garlic. Once adjusted, this soup is wonderful. As some have mentioned, I added a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove for a hint of sweetness which played off my madras curry beautifully. Given the heat of my concoction (2 bowls and I broke a sweat), I found that an off-dry Reisling, high in acidity, paired well with this soup. I can only imagine a structured Cab Franc would disappear underneath the weight of these potent flavors. I'll definitely be playing with this in the future.

The chickpeas and lemon added a great tangy taste to this, and I'm glad that I kept the butter in because it really blended the soup and chickpea puree, creating a very smooth taste.

Rating: 0
I agree with the other reviews in that increasing the garlic and spices is a must. I used 2 tbsp. of hot curry and 2 tbsp. of sweet curry. Cinnamon, nutmeg and clove finish with hauntingly lovely sweetness. I doubled the carrots and used 3 c. of my own homemade veggie stock along with 1 c. of water. Ditch the butter - it's unnecessary. A dollop of plain yoghurt right before serving is divine.

Rating: 4
This recipe is our new favorite! I also followed the suggestions of adding more garlic, curry, and carrots. I used orange lentils instead of green and Better than Bouillon vegetarian broth for added flavor. And then, for a wonderful addition, we each added a dollop of plain yogurt to our bowls. Absolutely delicious!

This is a family favorite. I use half chicken broth and half water. I have used curry powder and I have also used herbamare for the seasoning. I always start it off with 3 or 4 slices of Trader Joe's apple smoked bacon. It is a huge hit.

Well hello there, Epicurious. It has been a little while. After a hiatus from so much that I love in the world, namely cooking, due to a complete lack of time, I'm back. And my Curried Lentil Soup is hoisting me back into the saddle. What a f a n t a s t i c recipe. After perusing some of the reviews, and reading some of the disappointment expressed, I was a little apprehensive to to go forward with the soup, but am so glad I did. As per some suggestions, I upped the spices for more flavour. A little more garlic, a hefty extra helping of curry, and then I played around with some cinnamon, cumin and nutmeg until the blend was 'just right', that even Goldilocks would have been proud. Forget the butter; it didn't need it. The olive oil and pureed chickpeas add the perfect element of velvety. I let this soup simmer for a few hours to let everything jive until the flavours knew each other well, and it became a beautiful marriage. For as cold of a spring night as we're having here now, this soup fits the bill.

Rating: 2
This was kind of flat - I think it's because of the water, instead of using a broth. I didn't look over any of the reviews but should have. I'd love to make again and try some alterations. I'd give this a 2-1/2 if possible.

This is a decent recipe, but I much prefer the spicy lentil soup in Mark Bittman's book. I have made a lot lentil soups in the past, and although this one is good, it is not one of the best. It is a little bit boring and the butter is overkill.

This has become my go-to recipe for Lentil soup. I actually don't change it at all, maybe just add an extra garlic clove. My curry powder is pretty strong and spicy, so I add 2 rounded tbsp and then taste and adjust if necessary. I love the addition of the chickpea puree! It sounded so weird, and my boyfriend was so skeptical (especially when he saw the way the consistency of the soup changed when I added it), but it adds a richness and creaminess that is excellent. This has been added to our regular rotation of veggie meals. It's super easy and totally delicious. One note- maybe we eat more than other people, but unless we add a salad or some other course to the soup, we generally only get about 4 servings out of it.

Rating: 3
So good! I stayed mostly on track but played with it a little using a mix of other reviewer's suggestions. Did not make a puree with chickpeas, rather just added them after the simmer time and blended the soup with an immersion blender, leaving it a bit chunky as I like it that way. Will most definitely be making again!

Wow - incredibly delicious & easy! One of my favorite Epicurious recipes to date. I used 3-4 TB. of curry, added about 1-2 tsp. of cayenne (as my curry powder wasn't all that spicy) and doubled the garlic. I also used about 2 cups of vegan vegetable broth in place of half of the water. Served it with an arugula salad with a light lemon vinaigrette and warmed sesame pita bread for dipping!

As many users indicated, this was a very delicious and easy recipe. I have been searching for a good lentil soup recipe for a long time and I think I finally found the one.

This soup is very filling and tasty. I found that after the lentils were cooked I had to add another 2 or 3 cups of liquid. I chose boxed chicken stock for this to keep from watering down the flavours. The 2 tablespoons of curry powder was plenty. I also opted to add 1 stalk of celery and 1 parsnip. Also, isntead of pureeing the chickpeas with lemon and garlic, I added them whole and used the immersion blender to whiz up some of the soup. Also omitted the butter and extra olive oil. Overall very tasty and great for lunches in a hurry. I just freeze in lunch size portions and grab when I'm in a rush!

I used low-sodium chicken stock instead of water and was glad I did...regular stock would have been too salty.

Easy to make, tastes great, and even better the next day (and the next!).

I used regular brown lentils and it turned out well. I'll second the "more carrot" crowd; I put in one medium and one small carrot and could have still used more. And I second those who have said this recipe benefits from freshly-made curry powder (I used this recipe and was very happy with it: http://allrecipes.com//Recipe/mild-curry-powder/Detail.aspx). I also would have liked a rough estimate of how much salt to put in rather than having to fly blind. I used a mortar and pestle to smash the chick peas, since I had already used it to grind spices and didn't want to dirty the food processor. It turned out fine, if probably more chunky than creamy. Both my boyfriend and I thought that the fresh squeezed lemon juice added to taste at the table really made the dish. Don't skip that step!

This gets high marks for being delicious and incredibly easy! You more than likely already have everything on hand and the prep is minimal but with big results.

Very flavorful, hearty dish. We are not vegetarian, so I used chicken stock instead of water and also threw in some chopped leftover chicken. I have never used pureed chickpeas before.

Great recipe! I used brown lentils (Goya) and curry powder (2 tbs) from Trader Joe's. Added thyme, bay leaf, and an extra carrot and subbed veggie broth for the water. Omitted the butter. The garbanzo puree makes the soup thick and delicious. So glad it made a big pot so I have plenty more!

Lovely soup! Made exactly as described but used Trader Joe's steamed lentils instead of dried and reduced water to 3 cups. Simmered for 15 minutes instead of 30. Use a fine quality curry like Kalustyan's Imperial Curry Powder (mild) available in NYC or online. Brilliant!

I had the same experience as the cook below - we love spice, love heat, but this is a CURRY MEGABLAST (and I used exactly 2 T.). Like, I think I'll be sweating curry today at the gym.

This recipe has great potential, but I think 2 T of curry powder is far too strong. (And I have a tolerance for heat/like of curry.) Perhaps my curry was on the strong side, but I'd recommend scaling back quite a bit if you don't like it too hot. Otherwise, a nice soup. Also, I added sweet potatoes along with the carrots and chopped one granny smith apple which would make for a nice balance if the soup were not so spicy!

I absolutely loved this soup, as did my six year old son. It was hearty, smelled fantastic, and had a great flavour. I will definitely be making it again soon only next time I will follow the advice of a fellow reviewer and double the chickpea puree, using half to make hummus. Also, I am going to forego curry powder for my own blend of cumin and coriander for a more Middle Eastern feel.

First I have to say I love the review by twoloves, just down from my review. They added some chopped kale to make it a biy healthier, then added some sliced hot dog wieners near the end for flavour! haha Now that sounds like a healthy soup! I made the soup as listed and we were all delighted with the results. I think they key to this, and any successful recipe, is to use fresh curry powder or paste. Even if you purchase a pre-made powder, buy the best one you can afford and try to use it up within a reasonable amount of time. Next time I will double the recipe, it was that good.

Delicious and easy. Added a teaspoon of garam masala at the end of the cooking time to add more flavor.

Rating: 4
This is excellent but I did make a few adjustments. First, I used regular lentils and they came out just fine. I also omitted the butter, green onions and lemon at the end. I did add chopped kale to make it a bit healthier and rustic. I also added cut up hot dogs toward the end to make it a complete meal. Delish!

Somehow this was both blah and almost too hot to eat. Maybe old lentils and definitely my bad for over-currying with a batch of curry I haven't used much before. I will try again. Nice winter supper with a green salad, and thanks for the hummus suggestion - though now I have a ton of that leftover! I added some celery with the carrot & onion.

Fantastic! My 11-yr old nephew went back for seconds too! The only problem was that we only had 'sweet' curry in the house, so we had to add hot-sauce at the end. Looking forward to making it again with 'realy' curry powder.

Delicious! No need to search for a better curried lentil soup--you've found it. I recommend doubling the chickpea part of the recipe. Pull out half the puree for your soup, and then add some tahini and salt (to taste) to what's left in the food processor--hummus! Serve with warmed pitas alongside of the soup.

Great recipe. I made it with no modifications and was delighted with the results.

Rating: 3
The only modifications that I made were that I used Moosewood's garlic stock instead of water (I have a stockpile of it!) and that I didn't use the butter (didn't need it) and we liked it a lot. Smelled amazing while it was cooking.

This soup is DELISH and HEALTHY! Would not change the recipe in any way. Both meat eaters and non meat eaters loved it.

I just made this and while it was quick, easy and had a nice texture, I found it rather bland. I used a Sambar curry powder, which had a nice heat, and plenty of salt. But next time I think I'd add even more garlic and butter. Can easily be adapted, added to (tomatoes, for example)

This was really good! I had it with these pepper pies and it went quite well together http://www.fourgreensteps.com/community/recipes/main-courses/pepper-pies

Quick and easy recipe that I will make again. Despite omitting the butter in this recipe, finished product seemed loaded with olive oil. Next time I will eliminate the oil in the chick pea puree. I too sautéed all of the garlic up front; the taste was great.

This tasted like Indian food + buttery soup...delicious in my book! I used Madras Curry Powder and regular green lentils.

Excellent soup! My husband ate 3 bowls and asked for it to be made every week. I forgot to add water at the end, but it was fine because we liked the consistency. Also, I put all the garlic in with the onions and carrots (on accident), so maybe that might cut down on the sharp garlic taste in the chickpea blend, mentioned by a reviewer below.

Just finished making this dish. I look the mouth full of flavor! The garlic and curry combination really make it for me. Will make again.

This lentil soup had a nice kick to it. I followed the recipe exactly and I thought the curry was just the right amount.

I should have added more water than I did but it was still really great flavor. I added a 1/2 cup at the end and it needed at least another cup to have the correct consistency.

Good,but way too much curry! Maybe my Penzey's is stronger than most, but the curry was overwhelming. I'll make this again with less than half the curry.

Rating: 4
Quick, simple and delicious! Even my twelve year old son ate more than a few spoonfuls! The combination of the French lentils (which tend to maintain their shape so much better than brown lentils) and the garbanzo puree was fabulous. I followed the recipe exactly though I did, as suggested, add a little extra curry powder at the end. Served it with a green salad for a perfect late fall supper.

Rating: 4
I too followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the amount of curry. Only because the curry that I have came from a dear Indian friend who brought me some curry she and her family made while visiting India. This is a great lentil soup recipe!

Fabulous soup. Took the last of it for lunch today and can't wait to make it again. I love spicy dishes and curry, so this was a no doubter for me to try when I saw it in the magazine. Made it pretty much verbatim to the recipe but I can see trying a few variations of spice to give it a range of different personalities. Highly recommend this soup.

Rating: 3
Very good. The raw garlic in the chickpea puree came across very strong at first, but I left the combined soup on the heat for awhile and it mellowed.

Rating: 0
Outstanding. I used lime juice instead (I had a bunch of extra limes); we did cut down on the butter and I think were better off for it. We ate it for a meal along with herbed rolls to balance out the spice of the soup. Great simple meal - healthy too!

Rating: 4
Excellent! Followed recipe almost to a T...Used red lentils instead of green because they were the only small lentils available at the market.Used the recommended 2 T of curry powder (red) and it was quite spicy, so careful if you're sensitive to spice. Added some ground cumin, too, which improved it. When I told my husband I was making lentil soup he said "bleh," but he went back for two bowls and said he really liked it. (Also liked mine with a little dollop of nonfat sour cream on top, in addition to the lemon and green onion, to smooth & cool out the flavors--Greek yogurt would work too).

Excellent recipe! I thought I had tried all lentil soup variations, but this is truly exceptional! Do not omit the lemon or butter. Both are essential and make this lentil soup stand above others. Great recipe! Will definitely make again.

Followed the recipe to a T, used curry and garam masala (1 T). Served 6 for dinner with a salad. Received good reviews. I just had a bowl for lunch and it was even better sitting a day.

This is a delicious lentil soup. I followed the directions to a "t" except I forgot to add the lemon juice. Without a doubt, this is the best lentil soup recipe I've ever used and will discard all others in favor of this one!

Rating: 4
We really liked this soup. We were hesitant to add the lemon juice so we experimented with a small bowl of it adding lemon and tasting and decided that we preferred the soup without any of the lemon. Next time I will omit the butter. I will definitely be making this again.

I made this soup as written except I replaced the water with chicken broth (vegetable broth another option), and it was very good with lots of complex flavor.

I must admit that this was a disappointing soup. I am all for lentils and the story accompanying this in the magazine got me drooling. The problem, no flavour. I did follow the recipe exactly and I loved the idea of adding hummous to the soup. It just didn't come together into anything harmonious. Maybe it was my curry powder? Or maybe it will come together tomorrow? Or maybe I added too much lemon at the end to compensate? I much prefer her beluga lentil soup recipe (that comes from the Zuni Cafe cookbook).
