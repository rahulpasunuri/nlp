I love soups and make them all the time for meals. They have the perfect balance of everything for a healthy meal. My family really liked this recipe. My husband loves Vietamese style soups. It reminds him of his college days in the Bay Area where you could get a soup bowl for $3.50. That was a while ago...I like everything about this recipe except the lime juice. I found the amount in the recipe dominated the other flavors. Is this South West or Vietnamese? I would recomend that you eliminate the lime juice and then I would give it a 4.

When I've had a bad day or am sick, this is the recipe I reach for. It's my ultimate comfort food. By adding star anise and real Thai basil it tastes "authentic" enough without having to spend three hours in the kitchen cooking and cleaning as required by the other more "authentic" pho recipes.

I made this soup for a collective dinner with an asian theme. It was enjoyed by everyone. I made a couple of changes. I could not find serrano chile so instead of using vegetable oil to sauté de shallots and ginger, I used chile sesame oil. I also pan-roasted the beef strips a bit to crisp them up. To serve, buffet style, I put the noodles in the broth, the vegetables in a large bowl and the beef in a separate plate. People put the vegetables and beef in their soup bowl and then poured broth over it. It worked!

To Jasimar- OK, so you know what pho should taste like. You can't eat this recipe. So don't eat it. Simple enough- problem solved :)

Has anyone read the text that accompanies this recipe? It never claims to be authentic pho- it's a "version" of it. I've eaten plenty of pho, and no, this is not the real thing. I've made this and it is OK when I need a pho "fix" and don't feel like leaving the house to get it (I use lots of sambal oelek- I know, not authentic). And for the record, I've worked with short order cooks who can whip out meals for 60 people an hour, for 9 or 10 hours at a time (no breaks) and still have the energy and creativity to put together beautiful meals at home. The "authentic" and "amalgamation" issue is rather contradictory, don't you think? As a final note, I live in TX and I don't eat Spam, but a big 'ol "thank ya much" to the enlightened (and obviously more sophisticated) reviewers for adding fuel to the regional prejudice that seems to be so prevalent on this site recently. BTW- I haven't eaten armadillo in months :)

My apology to cooks who love this dish. I'm not a professional chef, but I do know how to make the real Pho. Unfortunately, none of the recipes I've read on how to make Pho is correct. The rule of thumb for making great broth is always use fresh ingredients, and in this case, use ox tails or beef neck bones. Both are equally good for pho in my experience. Also, use plenty of fresh ginger roots (approx. 2-3 rounds, cut in halves) and "whole" onions (1 or 2 will do) for added sweetness and flavor. You'll need to grill or brown them a little to allow the aroma to come out before simmering them in broth. Never use soy sauce for almost any Vietnamese soups, only fish sauce (the expensive kind, either the "three crabs" or "flying lion" brand, if they're available in your area) and rock sugar in place of MSG for taste. Rice noodles are very important as well since it will bring out the texture to your dish. They're usually flat and thin. You can also buy it fresh. As for the sliced beef on top, choose either eye round or tri-tip (high grade for tenderness). To do it right, you'll need at least 3 hours to prepare this dish. For spice, use 3 or 4 dried star-anise and 1 or 2 cinnamon sticks, plus 1 cardamon. There's one other spice that I don't remember the English term, sorry. But don't worry, it will still taste good. You'll simmer all these spices along with the gingers and onions near the beginning (after clearing most residue) with your bones. To keep the broth clear, try to filter the residue as often as you can throughout. Just a note, this is my first comment on Epicurious. I hope my input will help revitalize this authentic dish. Bon Appetit.

Yes, it's not the restaurant version, but hey.... when you're looking for something to make at home that's not really complicated and not the "same old same old", it works. Remeber, recipes are guidelines. If something works better for you, feel free to amend as needed.

I've never had Pho before, but I love Vietnamese cuisine so I thought I would give it a try. I wasn't thrilled! I'm looking forward to trying it again, but in a restaurant. Who knows, I may have been the problem.

Wow! Never seen such hostility in review, I am chinese and eat with vietnamese families quite often. Not everyone makes there soup with star anise or even beef. There are grandmothers who replace the beef flanks with frozen meat balls but they still call it pho after making it for 30 some-odd years. I make my own without any star anise cause its too strong when i make dinner just for myself (yes I usually eat alone...I'm sure it has nothing to do with my cooking?). And the noodles become way too soggy if left over. Oh, i also add rice, meatballs, hot sauce in soup and eat with oyster sauce.

Hey Pho Nazis, simma down. I would like to remind all of you "appalled" folks out there that this was a recipe for "Vietnamese-STYLE noodle soup" not Pho. If you put Pho in a recipe query this doesn't come up so relax folks. Now go dazzle yourselves with some more of your own self-anointed esoteric food knowledge.

My 14 year old daughter made this several months ago and we all totally loved it - the combination of different tastes (herbs and spices) and texture (soft vs. crunchy). We raved about it. Am making it again tonight so thought would check out the reviews for any improvements and was amazed at the negative reviews. Maybe we just like good tasting food without caring if it connects to the "original" recipe.

Nice recipe but it's not quite right. (a) 1 tsp of serrano chile is on the light side. There should always be a bunch of chiles on the side as a condiment with this style soup. (b) There is no star anise in the broth and there really should be. Not much, maybe 1-3 stars, but it should be present. (c) Should have some additional plum sauce or chili paste as additional condiment. Peave: The concept of Pho having long cooked beef is simply wrong with one caveat. Pho uses long-cooked tripe or tendon, but any flank or brisket that is present in the soup is uncooked until the steaming hot broth comes in contact with it just before serving.

Based on previous reviews, I gave this recipe a try expecting it to be rather lackluster. I made a few variations based on what was available in the store and was pleasantly surprised when I was done. I doubled the serrano (leaving in the seeds), added a large clove of garlic during the saute, used regular green onions for scallions, used two tbsp. of fish sauce instead of three and regular packaged sliced roast beef because my local store didn't have a deli. Granted, it wasn't exactly "gourmet cuisine", but it was a nice, quick, fairly simple meal.

1. This isnt a real pho recipe. It is a quicky pho recipe. 2. To "A Cook", I got news for ya pal, "Vietnamese Pho is an amalagamation of Chinese noodle soup, French boullion and Vietnamese indigenous ingredients. MOST cuisines are amalgamations of other cultures. You just showed your inexperience. What do short order cooks know anyway? What a clown. You sound mighty racist to me.

Get off the 'authentic' debate already! There's nothing more fun than to tweak a recipe to your own taste (and imagination). I'm Asian-American, love all kinds of 'asian' dishes - pho, pancit, sushi, etc. etc. I truly appreciate all cuisines and collect cookbooks that cover the gamut of styles and types - my husband swears I make the best chicken gumbo around (even after a trip to New Orleans). Anyways - just wanted to pass on information to real cooks out there - check out the 'Spicy Vietnamese Beef and Noodle Soup' also on this website. It's a nice contrast to this (better too I believe).

When I used to live in Calgary, I'd go out for pho in my neighbourhood once or twice a month. Now that I live in East Cowes on the Isle of Wight, I can only dream about making this soup in the summer when I can grow my own cilantro, mint and basil. Can't buy it here in the winter, sigh.

I agree with soya-miso. Each to his own taste bud. Everyone in my VNese family has her/his own version of preparing pho. I would never refuse to try something just because it doesn't conform to what I believe is the "authentic" recipe. Authentic according to whom?

This recipe takes longer to make than my own version, but it's not bad...just different. Each to his own taste bud. As some of the more intelligent have stated, "It's Vietnamese-STYLE." By the way, I'm VN and like Spam...and I use it as an ingredient in my hot pot. Gasp! Will you now condemn me for not being authentic to hot pot-dom? See ya'll in Austin for Spam Jam!

When I used to live in Calgary I wouldn't have bothered with this recipe since I could go for Vietnamese soup any time... but now that I live in Switzerland this was a taste of heaven! My husband and I loved it!!! I would definetly make it again. I added crab sticks and shrimp to it, simply delicious...

I can buy really tasty pho in almost any neighborhood for about 5 bucks, its on the table in about 5 minutes and I don't have to do dishes after. The only reason I would bother making this recipe is so I could put those super-tasty snow peas in it. Never get those at Vietnamese restaurants. Mmmm...snow peas, love those snow peas.

I'm usually a defender of the "don't feed the trolls" theory myself, but this time I couldn't resist. People who get bent out of shape when their idea of "authetic" is violated are pitiful. This recipe refers to Pho in it's description, but clearly claims that it is merely "pho-esque." I live in Manhattan, eat pho regularly, and I can tell you that each of the 8-10 "authentic" Viet Namese restaurants I eat it at serve different variations. I know pho, yet this recipe does not OFFEND me (because I'm well-adjusted). To Frisco (I know how you hate that!) If you insist on bashing the South - try to at least be clever and original! To Tampa: Emeril is not a GREAT chef - just a LOUD one (and rich!) Eat your food - don't throw it at other people . . . .

Oh, this is classic. I had to click on this recipe because I just *knew* the comments would have degenerated into a debate about "authentic" recipes. Well, my fellow Epicurious readers sure didn't disappoint me! I'm sorry, but "this recipe is offensive"? If you're offended by a recipe, you have wayyyy too much time on your hands. I agree with the cook from hell!

Okay, I'm Vietnamese and of course this recipe is not meant to be *authentic* as it said "style". The broth, done right, is an overnight simmering procedure with ox-tail. Of course, the general middle america (or wherever else) crowd is not going to get into this venture. I'll try this "quick" recipe, but I'll put in some star anise to give it that aroma. Having said that, what the heck does "snow pea" doing in this recipe?

Rating: 2
This recipe is a good short-cut. To make it more authentic tasting, roast some star anise and add it to the beef broth. Let the beef broth simmer with the star anise for about 15 minutes or so. (Note: You will need more broth, since some of it will evaporate.) In addition, substitute thai basil instead of regular basil. You can normally buy this at most larger Asian food marktets.

Goodness! In fairness to Epicurious as well as Gourmet magazine, and also with respect for this recipe's former reviewers, I feel compelled to point out an apparent reading failure. Where's the beef? The words "Vietnamese-style" signal that the dish is *not* authentically Vietnamese. Directly following, the copy provides a definition of "PHO" and clearly states that this is "our quick version." All Southerners eat Spam? Hahaha. What has that to do with the price of Pho? Tell it to Emeril, or any of the great chefs of New Orleans!!!!

I have never thought anyone who hasn't made a recipe should make a comment and now I'm doing that very thing I so dislike. However, I've eaten Pho at least weekly with my husband for the past 20 years and I have never once been served this style of Asian soup with snowpeas. I gave up reading the recipe at this point and found it necessary to post my comments. Snow peas are served in some Chinese soups, but not in this particular Vietnamese soup.

To the cook in California. I am not sure how you people do things in California, but to accuse all southerners of eating Spam is like saying OJ was not guilty. You may be right about the fresh beef broth. I was shopping for the correct ingredients in an Oriental grocery one day, however, when a Vietnamese woman helped me. She suggested the Pho soup base. Hey, if it's good enough for this Vietnamese woman who has probably never even heard of Spam or OJ, it's good enough for me. Tasted great. You can make fun of our biscuits and fried chicken, but please don't insult the authentic Pho Soup which southerners also enjoy. I am wondering if you've ever even tried the soup base. Very little, if any, difference from what you get in a Vietnamese Restaurant. The base is a paste (not like boullion cubes) to which water is added. All other ingredients are fresh. The oriental chile sauce together with fresh jalapenos can be added at the table. It's done this way in every Vietnamese Restaurant in which I've ever eaten. Guten Appetit!

I registered to be a member on this site JUST so i could rate THIS recipe. Whoever made this recipe, im SURE it's a great soup, but to call it PHO or "vietnamese noodle soup" is Freaking stupid. That's like making an eggroll and calling it a "burrito" because both eggrolls and burritos have meat inside and are rolled in some sort of wrap. Please, take this recipe off or just change the name. You make yourself look like an idiot. Email me if you want to respond to my rating.

This recipe is not even close to Pho. Snow Peas? Not only that, star anise is a large part of the recipe and it is not listed at all. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone. I am equally appauled.

Actually, Pho is traditionally a very clean soup with a clear broth and very fresh, barely cooked, ingredients. Do not use pho starter.. that is the same as using knorr cubes! The broth should be made from beef or from liquid broth bought at fine stores. The spiciness is added at the table from chilis not from a pre-fab paste. Can't help but think that everyone in the South is addicted to Spam. Try some fresh ingredients fro a change!

Not going to rate this because I haven't made it but I couldn't resist writing. I am sitting at my desk at work eating huge container (2 lunches) of Pho (with beef brisket) from a restaurant up the street called Pho Maille. It's owned and operated by a Vietnamese family and the soups are to die for. Anyway, the previous reviewer hit it dead on. Authentic pho contains thin slices of meat that cook in the broth (on the way to your table). It must be "seasoned" with chile sauce and/or chile oil and hoisen. Perfect thing for a chilly afternoon. We have tons of asian resturants in Anchorage. If you have a Vietnamese place near you, try this soup. Will taste very different from the above recipe.
