I adapted this recipe as a side dish for a dinner party with great results. Instead of russet, I used tri-color potatoes. I boiled them in 1" cubes. Then, I mixed the boiled potatoes and all other ingredients, and baked it rather than pureeing. I forgot to serve the rouille, though it smelled great. This was a very easy and colorful baked potato dish!

I was surprised at how filling these were! I made this in about an hour, since my mashed potatoes cooled quickly. I used skim milk (no problems with potatoes sticking together) and I skipped the thyme since I don't love it, and I thought these were delicious and really hearty for their size. I ate 2 with a salad and felt very full. They kept well in the fridge as un-fried patties so I just threw them in the pan when I wanted them. The rouille is addictive, too!

I added 3/4 cup parmigiano-reggiano and the egg as others suggest. I thought this had amazing flavor before it was cooked. Somehow after cooking it loses some of the flavor, humm.. I don't know why that could be. I tested one before serving to company. It held together great and looks beautiful. I think some will love it and some will be "meh". Loved the Rouille, made as directed but added extra cayenne. I'm checking the box that I'd make it again but unsure if I will. We'll see what the guests think.

Really delicious although a little time intensive. Would definitely double the rouille as I found it was a large flavour component and I could have done with more.

A lot of work. I think if you add an egg it will bind together better. Also, it is a tad heavy on the salt. Delicious none-the-less.

We are not vegetarians, but loved this as a meatless entree, along with steamed carrots and a salad. The potato cakes are tasty on their own, but excellent with the rouille (an easy and versatile version of this sauce). I had no trouble shaping the potato cakes, and they held together very well.

I mashed the potatoes with potato water and a little olive oil instead of milk and butter to make it healthier and stick together better. As long as you only turn once they are manageable. The rouille was excellent. The potatoes made great left overs as well if you end up with too much potato, just save the mix and fry up fresh later.

Awesome recipe. Will definitely make again. Any recipe that has my 6 year old eating kale without complaint is A-OK by me. I subbed hot hungarian paprika for smoked paprika in the rouille, cause I think smoked paprika is gross. Loved it with the rouille but everyone else chose to eat the cakes plain.

I used a red pepper rouille, and am glad I did. I omitted the milk and made the cakes small, so I didn't have any issues with them falling apart. They were a little blah, though; I think some cheese or bacon might help. I'm not sure I would make this again without trying something else to add more flavor to the cakes.

I followed this recipe as written (also agree with reviewer who marvels at the way recipes are altered)--nothing extraordinary. By following the recipe, my cakes did not fall apart. I only made enough cakes for one night and put the rest of the mix in the fridge--cakes came out just fine the next day. My husband hated the rouille (I didn't find it all that great either), again, nothing extraordinary. To be honest, this recipe requires a lot of pre-prep and the results just don't equal 4 forks. I am glad I made--love when I can incorporate healthy veggies, it but doubt if I will make it again.

Fantastic recipe! Great as dinner the night before with salad and a good Rioja, even better in the morning with spicy black beans and poached eggs (sans rouille). Note: I added an egg white to the mixture like most everyone else.

We enjoyed these and what a great way to get the family to eat Kale! The next time I make these I will add some grated Parmesan or Romano cheese to the mix before forming the patties. I also think increasing the cayenne pepper in the Rouille would be wonderful.

I really enjoyed these. I decided to use an egg after reading the other reviews. I served them for dinner last night and had lots of leftovers. I ate one for breakfast and one for lunch today!

These were absolutely delicious, and easy to make. Although I'm cracking up at all the comments on how "healthy" they are! Mashed potatoes fried in oil = healthy?

Made exactly as written. Potato cakes did not fall apart. My husband and I had them with a salad and we both thought they were pretty good but I'm still not a huge fan of kale. I will make these again as a side dish.

OOOh, yum. I could eat these every day! Although I sliced my finger while chopping the kale, necessitating 6 stitches for the love, these cakes were so good. Three of us ate all but 2 of them which I enjoyed the next day for lunch. Hearty, pretty healthy, really flavorful, they can stand as an entree with some good sides, or as a side all their own.

Made as written. Fell apart just a little. Still delicious. Egg as binder might change the flavor/texture too much. Go get some kale and make these!

The best thing about this recipe was the rouille. I will now use it on everything! I dipped fresh vegetables in it, put it on my sandwich and even ate it with my eggs! YUM!

Sooo good. Three of us just ate the entire recipe. Yum!

Haven't made this yet but just a tip--I often make fish cakes and if I don't have leftover potatoes, I'll just microwave-bake them and mash them up. No butter or milk. Very easy and they come out sticky and moist, perfect for forming patties.

Healthy & delicious. We rarely eat greens and this recipe made them taste great. Following another reviewer's advice, I didn't use the milk. The patties were easy to make and stayed together. Our son prefered them to be mushy, but the adults prefered them when they were well done and crispy around the edges.

Would make this every week. My 6 year old son loves these cakes and didn't want to stop eating them. I will be making these again for sure.

I would definitely make this again--the flavor was wonderful--although I did take some liberties by adding more cayenne to the rouille. We like spice in our house! I think I wound up with the proportion of potato to kale being slightly off--it was more kale, but I still think it was delicious. I kind of eye-balled the potato and kale proportions and I wanted a bit more kale, since we are trying to eat healthier and a bit more seasonal. Overall, a successful dish.

Loved the flavour of these but, like the previous reviewer, had difficulty cooking them. I think the addition of an egg would help but I would also omit the milk and butter from the mashed potatoes. I will definitely be trying this recipe again.

Delicious! Unfortunately, the cooking of these is very difficult, as they fall apart. I thought I had missed an ingredient or something, but had followed the recipe exactly. Maybe a binding ingredient would help, like egg? The taste was wonderful, however, and I'll make them again, trying an egg.

This was a big hit at Christmas dinner. A nice change from the usual mashed potatoes.

It really bugs me when people review a recipe, but change all of the ingredients. So, in the spirit of full disclosure, I did that, a little. I generally make my mashed potatoes with olive oil instead of dairy. So even though, the ingredients are a little different, the result is close enough. This is a really simple recipe. It's a great way to get more greens into a meal. I just had the leftovers for breakfast, topped with a poached egg.
