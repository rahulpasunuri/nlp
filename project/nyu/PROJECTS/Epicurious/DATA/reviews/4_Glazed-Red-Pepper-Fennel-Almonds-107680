I've been making these for a few years and all my friends devour them at parties. I use fresh chopped rosemary from the garden in place of fennel. I also double the recipe, using 1 cup raw almonds & 1 cup hazelnuts, but I don't double the pepper flakes. Delicious every time!

These are SO delicious. And a great quick easy thing to prepare to bring to a get-together. I've also used anise seeds instead of the fennel, and like that even better.

I'm not leaving a rating because I didn't make the recipe as written, but I wanted to comment on what I did do because it might be helpful to someone. I had a bunch of pre-toasted nuts that I accidentally bought unsalted, so I wanted to do something to make them interesting. I was afraid to put them in the oven and burn them up because they are already toasted, so I just made them on the stovetop. I dumped all ingredients other than the nuts in a non-stick skillet and cooked until bubbly on medium-high heat, then added the almonds. I then cooked them for about 5 minutes, tossing every minute or 30 seconds. At this point they looked shiny and dry, and were clumping when I tossed them. Next, spread them out on parchment paper and separate them. In a couple minutes once they have cooled they are perfect, shiny, crisp, totally addictive.

I've made these as printed & they're delicious. Today I made a few changes, because I'm taking them as a hostess gift, & the hostess is not fond of fennel. I used the sugar, salt & water amounts...then 1/3 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp butter & 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper as a substitute for the fennel & dried red pepper. Equally good!

Always gets rave reviews, as long as guests like fennel that is. I half the red pepper flake amount, not everyone can handle the heat. I think you could leave out the red pepper and still have smashing success. Love this recipe!

Love this recipe! Only problem for me is that they got sticky in the bowl when set out. I do live near the coast so perhaps it is the humidity? Any suggestions?

a friend made these for a party-- yummy but watch out for the addiction factor!

Made these for all the folks at my office as Christmas presents and they were a HUGE hit! I would recommend this recipe to anyone unless you are 9on a diet and have as little willpower as I do. ;-)

These are seriously tasty! And they are so pretty in a bowl, too, with their shiny dark glossiness. Very, very addictive, so watch out!

I've been bagging these up as little christms giveaways for a few years now-- everyone loves them! What's better is that people think they must be very complicated to make (and it's very easy!).

Very good, and better than expected. Great snack or appetizer!

Just cooked up a batch for a holiday basket I'm making. I was skeptical but encouraged based on the rating and the comments. After making them, I'm now ready to cook up my second batch because I think I'll devour the first one myself (jk...or am I?)! P.S. I cut down on the salt too. With all the peppery goodness, it really doesn't need it.

These were absolutely incredible...and I'm not even a fennel fan! Great for holiday cocktail parties...or to stuff in a care package. I'll be making these again and again.

Made with 2 cups pecans and only slightly increased red pepper and fennel. Perfect.

Don't even bother to make one serving of these! I started out with triple the amount for a Super Bowl party and they may not be left for this Sunday! The fennel gets sugary and crunchy-every bit as tasty as the almonds themselves! If you make more than one serving at a time, do cut back (slightly) on the red pepper if you don't like things too warm. In my experience tripling or even doubling a potent spice can lead to trouble! Enjoy!

Loved it- a friend suggested we put up a sign warning people that they were spicy, since they look only sweet in a bowl. I made a double batch for New Year's- not everyone loved 'em but I did.

I have made this several times. They disappear quickly and everyone requests the recipe. Great with iced vodka martinis for cocktail parties!

Yummy!!! I got this recipe from a friend and I made it for a Superbowl party. Needless to say, hands were CONSTANTLY in the bowl! I followed the directions exactly as printed and the almonds came out perfectly! I have made these over and over again. Always a hit w/ everyone!

The first line says these can be made a week ahead- I wouldn't recommend it, because you'll eat them all. I just made them now for New Year's Eve tomorrow night, and I may need a second batch! I used 1 C. almonds, 1 C. pecans, and increased the glaze ingredients by only a third, that was sufficient. Yummy good!

These are a perfect cocktail snack - a little spicy, a little sweet, a little savory, and a lot addictive.

People beg me for this recipe. The nuts are unusual and addictive. I keep small bowls of them on the table during dinner parties.

Yummmm! I made this first with pecans. I cut the salt in half at the suggestion of other reviewers and other experience with too-salty flavored nut recipes, and used turbinado sugar. They were so good, I immediately made a batch of the almonds, and mixed together. My gift recipients could not stop eating them. I highly recommend the mix of pecans and almonds -- I suspect you could roast them together, but I did them separately. I've tripled the amount of nuts, but only doubled the seasoning ingredients. I've got another batch (just almonds) in the oven right now.

I've made several batches of these almonds. The sweet & spice combination are very addictive! Fee free to adjust crushed red pepper to your liking. And the fennel adds a very interesting, deep flavor. The prep couldn't be simpler! Just make sure to stir at least once, maybe twice, during baking. And don't overbake. Mmmmmm!

Made these for a party and everyone went wild for them. Great and easy to make.

These nuts were really good, but I thought they were on the salty side. I'll make them again, but I'll cut the salt in half. Very good flavors going on and nice contrast. I might try substituting brown sugar to see if that makes any difference.

Worked well with pecans-- thanks for the tip! I did have a problem with them burning, unfortunately. Next time I'll probably just cook them on the stovetop so I can watch them more closely.

These nuts are excellent. The only trouble is eating too many of them. They were a huge success with guests.

I liked the contrast of sweet and spicy. MY guests liked them too.

Easy, fast, and delicious! I used pecans since I had them in abundance, and it worked well, although I did need to increase the roasting time by about 8-10 minutes. The fennel and pepper seeds found great hiding places in the pecan grooves which are absent in the smootheness of almonds. -Used kosher salt. I'm looking forward to trying this with the recommended almonds, as well as with walnuts.

Made this dish Sunday for a small snack with company before dinner. It was fabulous! I used about 2 cups raw almonds and the listed amount of spices. It seemed perfect - wondering if 1 cup would not be enough. They are a bit spicy, so those who don't like spicy, beware!
