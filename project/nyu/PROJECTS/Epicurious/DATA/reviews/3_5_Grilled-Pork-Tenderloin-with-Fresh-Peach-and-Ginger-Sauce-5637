A nice sauce for peach season. Reduced the sugar- don't like 'sweet meat'. Didn't have fresh ginger so substituted ground- about 1 tsp.-Turned out fine. Very easy and fast. Served with green beans and rice. Also the watermelon and cucumber hoisin salad- probably didn't need that.

Great easy recipe. Dinner guests loved it. Few leftovers received raves the next day . Will definitely have an encore!

I made this yesterday for a dinner party. I too thought the sauce was off. I used low sodium soy, so I did not have an overly salty result as some other comments indicate. Mine was bitter, I think maybe the balsamic I used was very acid. So, at the end, I put about 3 tablespoons more of brown sugar in at the end. As a marinade, it was great. But once you made the reduction, I found it overly acid. The brown sugar seems to balance it. I got rave reviews.

This was fantastic. We made it with pork tenderlions and fresh picked peaches two weeks ago. Marinating chicken breasts tonight to grill tomorrow.

I have been using recipes from this site for YEARS and consider myself a very good cook. This is by far the WORST meal I've made. The pork itself was okay but the peach and ginger sauce was HORRIBLE. I can't believe that 87% would make it again, I find that hard to believe. Is there a professional chef out there that could shed some light on this recipe? There are so many great recipes out here don't bother with this one.

I started making this dish back when I did a stint as charter sail boat chef. It is elegant and very easy to make and the guests thought I was a genius. I've made this for both large and small dinner parties and the reaction is always the same. Using canned peaches is fine and make sure you don't overcook the pork to ensure it's moist. I'm making it again tonight!

I made this recipe tonight with boneless chicken breasts. I marinated them only 2 hours and grilled them. I used chicken instead of pork because my guest prefers chicken. The chicken and the sauce were wonderful.

Everyone RAVED about this and fought over the left overs! The key to this recipe is to be very very careful with the temperature of your pork. If you overcook it, it won't be moist and juicy like ours was. The flavors of the marinade were amazing too. I will make this for company many times.

I loved this recipe - easy & tasty. I used instead 1/2C of regular soya sauce and 1 tin of peaches cut into pieces, which worked fine. I marinated overnight. Delicious!

Rating: 4
This was a very rich and delicious entree that was very easy to make. Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Even though I typically like to grill, I decided to cook the pork in the oven, and it came out very moist and tender. I was making this last minute and only marinated the pork for about an hour, but it was still very flavorful. Also, I think the recipe made more sauce than was necessary. Next time I may reduce it by a third or a half. This recipe was so yummy and warm. Good for fall. I will likely make it for a dinner party, so I can share it with others!

Rating: 3
Really, really good. I did, however, leave out some of the ingredients, and that's why I didn't give it 4 forks. I used 1 tbsp sugar, added 1 tbs butter to the onions & oil, and 4 peaches. Didn't use soy or cinnamon after reading other reviews, and am glad, because the result was a very nice fresh, fruity, spicy sauce. Could probably also sub nectarines or apricots for the peaches.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe--easy, healthy, and delicious. The peaches give the dish a nice summery feel. I cooked down the leftover marinade and used it as a sauce for the pork. I also added chopped fresh basil from my garden since I had an overload. This will become on of my staple marinades!

I'm generally in agreement with the majority of reviewers with recipes. Not with this one. I followed directions just as written, with no substitutions. The pork turned out OK, not great. The peach and ginger sauce was, in my opinion, terrible. I ate some because I'd worked on it, but my husband just had a bite or two. We tossed the remainder of sauce. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if these flavors just didn't work for us (although we like all the components by themselves)

This is a GREAT recipe! I made it with a boneless pork loin that I marinated overnight then grilled for about 1/2 hour (turning every 10 min.) and it was wonderful. Very impressive for company. Serve with a good Red Zinfandel or other fruity robust red.

The peach and cinnamon made this taste a lot like Grandma's xmas ham (with pineapples and cloves). The ginger and soy sauce made it taste like Grandma grew up in Chinatown, however. On the whole not bad but quite traditional, familiar flavours.

This is an easy and very tasty dish. Especially good for entertaining. Every time I have served it, I get rave reviews.

Rating: 1
Very good concept but problematic with ingredient amounts as others have reported. Too much sugar: Reduce to 3 tbsp. at most as much too sweet and causes meat to quickly burn even at med-low heat on the upper rack of BBQ. Too much soy sauce: Reduce to a scant 1/2 cup and make sure it is sodium reduced to prevent excess saltiness. Way too much cinnamon: I reduced to 3/4 tsp. and it still overwhelmed the other flavours, especially the ginger. I added 2 cloves minced garlic to the marinade/sauce for a little more zip and its flavour was completely lost. When my husband came home from work, he called out, "Mmmm, I smell cinnamon buns for dessert." That just about says it all! Even with these changes, not sure I would make this again but enjoy the blend of peaches, ginger and pork so may tweak this recipe considerably and give it another try. On second thought.....no!

Rating: 1
I had high hopes for this, given the ingredients, but foolishly I dismissed the complaints from other cooks about the sauce being too salty. I should have listened. The sauce was essentially inedible. Perhaps the problem is that pork tenderloin these days comes pregnant with salt water. In any case, don't make this, unless you can get virgin pork, not the kind that lives is a sodium and water bath.

This is the first four fork rating I have ever given. We eat a lot of pork and have been looking for a new tenderloin recipe. This is the best one yet. I did not cut back on anything, especially the soy sauce. It acts like a brine when marinating, so it is important. Plan to marinate over night. It does make a difference (pork stays moist when cooking).

I discovered this recipe about one month ago and I have already made it three times for friends. Everyone raves about it. And they have made it since themselves. I did go easy on the soy sauce, a little less than the recipe called for. It was perfect. Highly recommended and very simple to prepare. I already know the recipe by heart!

I found this to be a fonderful blend of summer ingredients. I followed the receipt, had great results and plan on having it again. Is it surprising that the folks that didn't like this pork, cut back on the key ingredints?

I made this to take to a lunch potluck after church. Saturday night, I marinated the pork (1 t. cinnamon) and reduced the sauce base. Sunday morning I roasted the pork in the oven, prepped the peaches by pulsing them in the processor with fruit fresh, and stirred them into the sauce. At the potluck, I nuked the pork to warm it and brought the sauce to a boil -- served it on the side. I thought this was good, but I've had better pork tenderloin dishes.

I found this to be an excellent blend of superb ingredients. My husband and I devoured a .91lb tenderloin without a problem. Served with steamed snap peas, a salad of hearts of romaine,cherry tomatoes and farm-fresh cucumber chunks and lots of French bread to soak up the wonderful sauce.

A wonderful, easy, summer keeper. I chose this dish to take advantage of the buy one, get one free pork tenderloin at my market and now would buy the pork to MAKE IT! Fast, Yummy, it impressed even my good cook/foodie friends. The peaches do not even have to be ripe--the blanching brings out the sweetness. I have to confess, I only marinated it for an hour or so and it was delicious. Imagine what 6-8 hours would do!! I was also too impatient to let the marinade cool down, so I used a large measuring cup and put the meat in the warm marinade and covered it. Just make sure all the meat gets covered by the marinade. Next time I might double the marinade/sauce though, I would have like more!

Rating: 1
Considering all the rave reviews, I decided to make this recipe and that it would be fabulous. The only deviations from the original recipe were to cut both the soy sauce and cinnamon in half-I didn't have low sodium soy sauce, and there were plenty of recommendations to cut back on both of these ingredients. After saying all of this, I thought it turned out horrible. I tossed the leftover sauce. I apologized to my dinner guests. One of them said: "It's not terrible. It's okay." After the second bite he said: "Actually, it's a little less than OK" I would not make this again nor recommend it to anyone! Waste of time and good food (peaches and pork). better just to stew the peaches all on their own.

Rating: 4
This was a big hit for everyone who ate it! I took the suggestions of several other reviewers and cut back the cinnamon. Other than that I followed the recipe to the tee. Next time I will double the sauce so I can reduce it down further. I also believe that this recipe is not enough for eight people. I served two tenderloins for 4 people and it was just enough. The servings were not large. I will be cooking this again this coming weekend for a dinner party for 6 people and will definately serve with an extra tenderloin, or possibly two extra. That way we may actually be able to enjoy some leftovers. The meat and sauce are very sophisticated tasting with many levels to it. It really is so easy to make because it is all made the day before. That way you can sit back and enjoy your guests...

I used low-sodium soy sauce as well. I've made this a number of times with fresh peaches. I wanted to make it for a winter dinner party and couldn't find any decent fresh peaches, so I used canned (in juice, not syrup) sliced peaches and diced them. I like fresh better, but in a pinch...This is dish I make every summer.

The marinade was great, although I wasn't too thrilled with the sauce. I think it was because my peaches were coarsely chopped, they needed a fine chopping, maybe next time, I'll put it in the blender, but that just my opinion. My husband liked it. We did overcook the meat, you have to be careful not to, because it's such a lean cut of meat that it dries up quickly. Will try again though.

Rating: 4
Everyone who ate this liked it. I agree about the reduce sodium soy sauce. I didn't have any, but after reading the reviews decided to not use as much regular soy sauce. It was fine flavor-wise, but still a bit on the salty side. The marinade/sauce is DELICIOUS and pork tenderloin is such a great cut of meat....

This was delicious! I served it at a dinner party to rave reviews (including from my husband, my most forthright critic.) I marinaded the pork a full 24 hours. The sauce was really superb. I too used frozen peaches as it is too early in the season for fresh ones - I would be very surprised if it makes a difference whether the peaches are fresh or frozen. The leftovers, including the sauce, were terrific.

This is a quick & easy receipe that makes a nice presentation for a crowd. I had to use frozen fresh peaches instead of fresh because they were not available, but they worked well. I think mangos would also be great. One warning: a little sauce goes a long with with this dish, so it should be drizzled slightly on the cut pieces and the balance served separatly, so as to not overpower the pork tenderloin.

This was a great recipe I would definitely make again (especially for company). It was very easy and fool-proof. For example, I used the oven broiler instead of the grill, forgot to serve with chives, overcooked it a bit, used frozen instead of fresh peaches (weren't available in winter), used regular soy sauce instead of reduced sodium and it was still wonderful! Perfect for company. I served with herbed cous-cous, broccoli and biscuits (for the sauce) and it was delicious!

This is one of my favorite Bon Appetit recipes. It's great for a crowd, and most of the work is do-ahead, so it doesn't require a lot of attention during a dinner party. I have made it 4 or 5 times now, and guests always rave and ask for the recipe. A few tips that I've learned through trial and error: 1) Fresh peaches are better by far, but canned will do; 2) If you have a rotisserie attachment for your grill, use it--the restults are fantastic; 3) I actually take the meat off the grill when the thermometer registers 140-145...the meat continues to cook and reaches 155 by the time I'm ready to carve & serve; 4) Definitely marinate overnight...it makes a huge difference; and 5) Don't be shy with the ginger! As I said, everyone I have served this to absolutely loves it--I'm sure you'll have similar success!

This is an outstanding recipe. Due to a busy schedule, the pork was left in the marinade for 2 days. Not only did it not take long on the grill to cook but the meat was so tender and flavorful (instead of the peach, I made a blackberry sauce to go with it). We gave some to a neighbor, and she ate it like a brownie, right out of her hand without any fork and knife. My fiance has raved to everyone about this dish for months. We're visiting my future mother-in-law this Labor Day weekend, and the pork will be in the marinade bag before we go. Yum...

I have been making this dish for 2 years. It is fabulous. One of our very favorite grill recipes. Something different from the standard fare. I usually cook my pork to 140 or 145. It is safe these days unless you have issues. Pregnant or elderly should cook it longer.

I was disappointed with this dish. After all the rave reviews I was expecting something fantastic, but I really wasn't crazy about it. The sauce was OK, I wound up dumping the rest of it down the drain. I made two tenderloins, so I'm saving one for tomorrow, and I'm going to make a hash with it. Unfortunately, half way through cooking it on the grill, our propane tank ran out (no extra) and I roasted it in the oven to finish it. The meat DID come out very moist and tender but it was the taste of the marinade and sauce I wasn't crazy about. Not a keeper in this household

i have not made this recipe yet but do intend to do so. in reading the reviews i noticed many of the reviewers cooking their pork to 140. my husband works for a swine producer and i also cook my pork to 140. todays pork is very safe and over cooking can easily and very quickly dry out the meat. pork today is extremely lean so get an "instant" read meat themometer to help check the tempt. a slight touch of pink is what you want.

This is the perfect marinade for pork tenderloin. Peaches are not in season yet, so we used mangos instead. Next time I may add some peach nectar as well to balance it out even more. I agree that the sauce would be prettier if extra warmed fresh peaches were served along side of the sauce.

An excellent recipe to add to your kitchen basics. Wonderful for entertainng. In winter I prepare in oven and it's even easier. When peaches are out to season, I've used apples, pears, or mangos. All excellent. I prefer not to reduce the sauce as directed but just to bring to boil and add fruit immediately before serving.

This was as good as everyone else said it was. I added two minced garlic cloves when sauteing the onions, and used mandarin oranges instead of peaches since it was all I had in the house. I was leary of the 140 degrees so I went with 150 and it was still delicious.

I've made this dish twice to positive reviews; the combination is sweet, but not overpowering. One modification I made during the second time 'round was to reduce the amount of soy sauce (to about half the designated amount). This enables the flavor of the peaches to really shine through. For those of you who have the original magazine recipe, the coleslaw recipe that accompanies it is great. Mix in the dressing a few hours before serving so the flavors blend better.

My husband wasn't sure what I was asking him to grill but we were both surprised at the taste. The marinade is strong tasting, 'robust' as they say but very, very good. It would be good served with wild rice so the rice could soak up the marinade.

The only thing coming out of anyones mouth was a true compliment about how great the meal tasted. Perfect for a summer dinner out on the patio.

As a culinary school trained chef, I had high expectations for this and the recipe came out great. My guests were very impressed and said it was to die for.

Terrible! The soy sauce and cinnamon dominate the dish, leaving the peaches with a strong soy-sauce and cinnamon taste that is undesirable. The sauce is much too strong for the dish and the peaches - I had some perfectly ripe peaches and you could not even taste them. I dumped out the rest of the sauce because it made the dish taste so awful.

Delicious! Make sure the meat is at least 3/4 in. thick. I let them rest in the juice overnight. Make plenty of marinade for left overs. Put each survivor in a zip-loc, covered with juice and sqeeze out all air. My wife took it to work 3 days later dumped it in the microwave and drove the office nuts!

Very tasty and easy to make. This is a good company dinner - so much can be made ahead and everyone thinks it is hard to make.

Couldn't find peaches that looked good, but mangoes were ripe so substituted them for the peaches. Delicious!
