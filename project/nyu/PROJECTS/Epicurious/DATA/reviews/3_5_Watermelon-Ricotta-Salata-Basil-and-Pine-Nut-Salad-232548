Made as per the recipe - taste was fine, but the appearance is lacking. Not very pretty (too little green). I made it for a group dinner and was disappointed with the presentation. A number of other watermelon salads out there are just as tasty and prettier. The ricotta salata is excellent with the melon!

Very pretty and a great idea for all that leftover watermelon.

I forgot to mention I made this salad without the pine nuts, as pine nuts were elsewhere in my menu. I did not miss them one bit!

I made this for my dinner party guests last night, and they tucked into it before I could tell them what it was. There was a moment of shock when they realized it was watermelon, and then without missing a beat, sheer delight in the combination of flavors. They all swore it had mint in it, which might be a nice addition. One of them insisted on slurping the juices off his plate! I just now ate last night's leftovers, dubious the salad would still be good after a day. Even though it was better freshly tossed, it made a great day-old salad. Incredibly delicious! Don't fear--make it!

Delicious. Has to be tossed with dressing right before serving. If you can't find ricotta salata, it's also good with feta.

A wonderful play on textures and flavors - this salad is a must in watermelon season. I've found that it's worth the effort to pick out seeds from seeded melons when prepping. I think the new seedless melons have had their flavor and sweetness bred out of them in the name of convenience. I like the firmer texture of ricotta salata when I can find it, but a mild feta is a perfectly reasonable substitute.

Ugh! This was as odd as it sounded. I don't think I've ever given 1 fork, but this is not good. Until I noticed that the recipe came from Bon Appetit, I thought that perhaps I was the victim of a practical joke played by the other reviewers. I still can't help but wonder. Really, don't make this salad.

made several times to great review. my suggestion would be to not use salt or pepper. the cheese will add some salt by itself.

Great! On the advice of other reviewers, I used crumbled feta instead of the ricotta salata and it turned out fantastic. My friend couldn't stop raving and wanted the recipe. It, too, am currently eating the leftovers..yum!

This was very good. My family loved it. I used feta since that is what I had on hand. I will definitely make this again and try the ricotta salata.

First, I don't give out 4 stars that much but this was really 3 1/2 - very easy and made a colorful presentation. I couldn't find ricotta salata so I used some really good, authentic feta that Trader Joe's sells (yellow/green wrapping by Pastures of Eden). Although this was delicious that evening (I tossed it about half an hour before dinner), I don't think that it holds up well after a few hours, as the basil gets soggy and brown. You could prepare the dressing ahead in a jar and chop up the watermelon well in advance. Then, add the dressing just before serving and also toss in the basil and pinenuts. Enjoy!

I used a little less olive oil and no pine nuts to make this a little healthier (I tried it with the pine nuts, but the texture benefit wasn't worth the pine nuts' "bad" fats). Instead of the ricotta salata, I used fresh, crumbled goat cheese. The dish was outstanding -- an instant hit with my family. I'm eating the leftovers right now (made a BIG batch).

Definitely a winner - wouldn't change a thing. I will add this to my summertime repertoire of unusual salads.

I loved this salad. Very light and the ricotta salata added just the right touch of saltiness. I actually used a golden watermelon instead of a red melon and it still tasted great.

I can see where this ingredient list sounds unlikely, but the salad is absolutely delicious. There's nothing that doesn't go together here, if you think flavor by flavor. I think this is great as part of a meal of 3 or 4 salads, composed on the plate. It will add a refreshing and delectable contrast.

Looking at the list of ingredients in this salad, I had my doubts, but the basil and watermelon paired together is wonderful. Yes, we can do without mint in a fruit salad. The saltiness of the ricotta salada and the pine nuts is a perfect compliment to the watermelon. I had many requests for the recipe thanks to Cat Cora. With the abundance of watermelon this year, it's a "must try".
