This recipe definitely required some minor tweaking. I roasted the squash, added more black pepper, cayenne and red pepper flakes, smoked sea salt and a generous squeeze of lemon. Didn't use cheese but added this on top of the dish. Served with chicken and mozzarella ravioli. Yum!

Made as directed except used rubbed sage, not fresh, and added ham cubes and served with additional cheese.. Just fine for a quick dinner and the microwaved leftovers were even better. We eat very spicy food all the time and found this mild dish just fine as a chg of pace..

This was so delicious! I wouldn't change a thing. The butter, sage, butternut squash, and parmigiano are all really flavorful together. My family loved it! Make sure you process the squash and onion in the food processor like it stated into really small pieces. Then as you're cooking the squash, it will turn into a delicious creamy sauce. No need to double the sage as others stated, the earthiness of the one tablespoon is just the perfect accompaniment for this dish. Also, using chicken broth would make it too salty as it reduces. The pasta water is flavorful enough as long as you salt it well for the sauce and pasta. It's all about balance in this dish.

My husband is a pasta lover and I really wanted to make something seasonal and healthy. We love this concept and it's really easy to make. It does need more spices, although I haven't had Sage on hand, I've used Herbs De Provence and added more basil as well as oregano. We like spicy foods so I might play with adding a little heat next time. As far as consistency goes, it's still grainy as it's written. I think the next time I make it, after I've cooked it with the onions, I'm going to put it back into the processor and pureeing it so it has the consistency of a marinara sauce. Because there has to be modifications, I gave it a 3 instead of 4 but this will definitely be a regular dish in our home! My husband asks for it often and my 7 month old daughter loves the sauce.

I have made this recipe a few times with several variations. The best I could come up with was coarsely chopping up the butternut squash and serving it more as a thick hearty sauce, almost a side of itself. Spot of parmesan.

Because others said this recipe was bland, I used 1/4 c white wine and 1/4 cup chicken broth in place of water. I also used frozen instead of fresh squash and ground instead of fresh sage because that is what I had on hand. I suspect it could be better w/ fresh sage but I still expected it to be a lot better w/ my modifications. I wouldn't bother modifying or making exactly as the recipe says again. Next time I want something with butternut squash I will try a soup recipe. I am still glad I tried the recipe because I had the ingredients on hand and needed to use them.

I roasted the squash which was nice. Then I coarsley mashed the squash so there were quite a few chunks which helped the flavour. I still prefer butternut as soup though.

This was quite a good winter warmer with one major modification; I roasted the squash with the onion in a little olive oil. This really brings out the best in this vegetable and makes for a nice creamy sauce (it's also soo much easier to peel after roasting). Minor mods; I also used veg. stock in place of water, and added a little spice with cayenne. If memory serves correctly, it did need thinning with pasta water so bear this in mind.

This didn't have much flavor. I tried hard-- used many times the amount of sage and sauteed it in butter before adding it, used chicken broth instead of water, but it wasn't enough.

This dish was pretty bland, even though I used chicken broth and doubled the sage as other reviewers had suggested. It was better after a couple of days in the fridge, after the flavours deepened, but still not anything to rave about.

This is an easy way to turn butternut squash into a meal. The flavors all combined well. I doubled the amount of sage used and added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes for spiciness. Next time I'll use 1 cup of chicken or vegetable broth instead of 1 1/2 cups of water. That should add more flavor. 1 1/2 cups of liquid took too long to evaporate and overcooked the squash in the process.

This was good, but not great. Used chicken broth as suggested. Did take me much longer then specified for squash to get tender, though, despite having processed it into very fine pieces. The squash flavor did seem a little bit flat, so next time may try roasting the squash first to bring out more of it's natural sweetness before adding it to the other ingredients.

This was a very easy way to use butternut squash, which I'd never prepared before. I used peeled, cubed butternut squash from Trader Joe's. Per other reviwer's advice, I used chicken stock instead of water in the sauce. It was very creamy and good. I think it could have used more sage, which I will adjust the next time I make it.

Unfortunately, I followed the recipe as written. It was rather bland and made for a rather "blah meal".

My roommate and I really enjoyed this dish. I heeded other people's suggestions and used a combo of Romano and Parmesan cheese, as well as chicken stock instead of water. I actually liked the consistency of the dish--mine's came out creamy and cheesy... total comfort food! Next time I might keep some larger chunks of squash though, for added texture

I took some of the suggestions here including increasing the sage and using stock instead of water. This recipe definately needs some heat to cut the sweetness of the squash. The next time I make it I'll add either cayenne or red pepper flakes. I would also suggest using a stronger cheese.

An interesting concept and I did like the flavor, but it isn't something I'll probably make again. It certainly is a well conceived combination: slightly sweet squash and onion, savory sage, and salty cheese. I think the recipe fails on its texture. Since the squash and onion are finely chopped, the result is a dish that seems grainy. Two forks!

Very tasty. I used more sage and more squash. It's quick and easy - after you peel and cut the squash.

As is, I wouldn't make the recipe again. It was lacking. Use chicken broth instead of water. Brown the butter and add to the pasta, that added a lot of flavor. Put a clove of garlic in with the squash and onion and use pecorino instead of parmeasan. These really kicked up the flavor.

Yummy!!! I followed the suggestions of others and added more sage,simmered the squash in chicken broth until almost melted down. I let it sit at room temp for a few hours before finishing it off with the (whole wheat) penne. Added lots of freshly ground black pepper too.Really wonderful-I think the combination of sage-squash-parmesan is inspired. I gave it four forks because it is an example of simple sometimes being best.

This was wonderful! I added extra sage and used vegetable broth instead of water when cooking. As it simmered, I added more broth until the squash had nearly cooked completely down. It takes a little extra time, but it gives the completed sauce extra body and flavor. Delicious!

I thought this was good, but needed additional sage. I gave 3 stars because my husband told me that it was much better the next as leftovers. If I were to make it again I would make the sauce the night before sans cheese as others have done.

A very easy and satisfying quick meal that's also quite rich. I used frozen squash chunks to make things go even faster. I would say 4 servings is closer to the mark though, if this is all you're having for dinner.

This recipe is a keeper!! Made the sauce in the afternoon, adding the cheese later while the pasta (De Cecco brand is excellent) was cooking. Used 2T. butter and 2T. olive oil and a bit more sage. So easy and delicious. My guests loved it. Am thinking who to invite over next to make this again!

This is great and so quick. The whole family loved it. Made the sauce up to adding the cheese the night before. Reheated sauce, adding in the parmesan while the pasta cooked. Only change was to add another tablespoon of sage, more salt & ground pepper and half a cup of toasted pinenuts. Great dish for visits by the vegetarian brother-in-law.

Amazing dish. We changed it up a bit, however. Insted of the sugested pasta we used four cheese ravioli and made the squash and onions more of a sause by blending it together. This is a great recipe you can make and add your own twist to. We are gunna try it again with steamed spinich add to it.

This is absolutely delicious! A perfect fall dish that is quick and easy-great for a weekday dinner. Four forks because of how quick it is to make-even though I had to chop the squash and onion by hand everything came together in no time. The squash melts into a tasty sauce that is perfectly accented with the parmesan and sage. You could easily pass this off as part of an elegant dinner. I couldn't believe that something with such simple ingredients (and so easy to put together) tasted this great! I'll be making this often this winter! (The recipe works great halved, as well.)
