This is the only slaw I make now. It ticks all my boxes - fresh, delicious, quick, make in advance, excellent side to many proteins, travels well, everyone likes it. Although I'm not a fan of changing recipes, plain greek yoghurt is a staple in my fridge and it does work well instead of sour cream. I always garnish this slaw with a generous handful of crushed dry roasted peanuts or cashews on top, which rounds it off perfectly.

Loved the flavor! Fabulous! Also used a jalapeno pepper as that was what I had on hand.

Great recipe! I hate regular coleslaw, but this was delicious. I added carrots and a little extra lime juice and zest, left out the garlic, and cut the amount of sour cream and mayonnaise in half. Also added just a touch of agave syrup to sweeten it up a bit. So good!

This is one of my favorite dishes to bring to pot lucks -- it's always a hit. I add a lot more lime zest, cilantro, and garlic than called for, but I do that to everything. I once had to use a jalapeno instead of a serrano -- I was disappointed, but some cayenne helped. The last time I made it, we used it on tacos and burgers at a pool party, which also went over very well.

Delicious! Served this with fish tacos and it was great. This is also good as a side dish. I shredded the cabbage in a vitamix with the chile, garlic, cilantro, onions, and lime juice. I added the mayo (didn't use sour cream) and grated lime peel at the end. It was quick and easy!

I was very disappointed. I followed the recipe directly, and it tasted like I was eating pure lime and cabbage. Maybe this would be alright as a topping as some suggested; fish tacos, lamb burger. It was not enjoyable as a side dish. Would not make again.

This has been consistently one of our favorites at the table. We use light mayo and light sour cream and still think it tastes amazing--great as a condiment on veggie burgers, too!!!

This was great. I never make creamy slaws, but I'm glad I tried this one. It will go super with the black bean soup and butternut squash we just cooked up. I also used yogurt as suggested and mixed red and green cabbage. Finally, I've recently started doing slaws in the food processor with the slice and grate attachments, and it makes them infinitely easier.

Perfect on a late summer buffet with ribs, other fresh salads, fruits, etc. Guests loved it! Garnished with some toasted sesame seeds.

Y U M!!! This was delicious! The only slight change I made was to use plain yogurt in place of the sourcream as others had mentioned. Oh,I also, I made the sauce ahead but added it to the cabbage just a little bit before serving instead of letting it sit on the cabbage. Huge hit with my family. I will add this to my list of items to take to potlucks.

Really yummy! I did the dressing and cabbage etc. separately, then added the dressing a little at a time until it was evenly coated. I didn't want there to be too much dressing. (That happened with a caesar salad I made and it was an unhappy result cuz I didn't have extra lettuce...) The dressing sure is good though - I was licking it up!

Have made this several times for fish AND pulled pork tacos. Huge hit, every time-even with people who say they've never liked slaw because they don't like mayo.

So good! We loved this. I stayed on recipe with the exception of using an Anaheim chili for less heat and I added a few chugs of sweet chili sauce to cut down the acidity of the lime a bit. This is very refreshing. We had this with grilled garlic naan bread and epicurious's piri-piri chicken. Each dish was great on its own, but also together as a wrap.

Loved this slaw! I usually don't like slaw, but this just rocked my world! Because my local market was out of serrano peppers, I replaced it with anaheim peppers and it was very good! We will be making this often!

Everyone loved this slaw! Used plain yogurt instead of sour cream and canola mayo. Subbed in chives and jalapeno instead of serrano and green onion. Served it alone and on burgers, sandwiches etc. Big hit.

Made this for dinner last night and everyone loved it. The garlic and serrano add a nice kick that is balanced by the creaminess. The only change I made was to use nonfat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. We had it with steak in a spicy marinade, which worked well together.

I really enjoyed this refreshing slaw. I Used jalapeno instead and it was great. Will make for my next party...

My husband and I try every coleslaw recipe we can find, and this is our current favorite. It has just enough spice to be interesting, and not too much of a creamy dressing to make it "sloppy" like other recipes. I followed the recipe as shown, except I used about 2 tablespoons of minced white onion and added it to the mayo/sour cream mixture, and omitted the green onions. Delicious!

A tasty (though not terribly adventurous) twist on traditional creamy cole slaw. Thoroughly enjoyed this (along with cheese and avocado) as a topping for roasted veggie soft tacos.

I'm a big fan of slaws. Really enjoyed what the brightness of the lime and the 'zip' of the chili added to the fresh crunch of the cabbage. The sour cream/mayo mixture was the perfect binder. I'll make this again...often.

the slaw was delicious...a fresh flavor. the one instruction that I would change is NOT to make it a day ahead. luckily, I prepared the recipe about two hours before serving it. what was leftover was watery the next day, although still tasty, but not presentable. the bagged slaw mix was used, but doubtful that it caused the extra juice in the leftovers.

This is the third time I've made this recipe. For those of you who haven't made it yet... this isn't your basic creamy slaw... consider it more of a light, creamy, vinegar slaw with lime juice substituting for the vinegar. And if your limes are juicy and on the sweet side, you shouldn't need to add sugar as some have suggested. I use bagged slaw (angle hair, with carrots, whatever...) but leave out the garlic. I think it's a little too heavy for the light flavors of the cilantro and lime and becomes overbearing after a day or two. I double the cilantro, the serrano and add more lime juice and salt to taste. This is great with crab cakes or fish tacos.

This recipe is delicious. I was hesitant to make this based on the ingredients but it turned out great and was a big hit at our dinner party. As suggested by another reviewer, I did quickly boil the shredded cabbage. This went well with bbq and would be good for fish tacos.

I just made this slaw for the second time. It is something I will continue to make over and over. The tang of the lime is fabulous, along with the cilantro. The only thing I did differently was add red cabbage just because I didn't have enough green cabbage. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. Delicious!

I tried this recipe because I think typical coleslaw is too sweet and I really like it. I used packaged cabbage that's already shredded with bits of carrot in it. Very quick and easy to make.

Just made this last night! Delicious. Made it with cumin kebabs from this site. Only alterations: used bagged cabbage (another reviwere suggested) and blanched it by quickly running some boiling hot water through it in order to soften the cabbage bitterness, lastly I added lots more lime :) Great alternatively to super creamy slaw. I should add I made it with 2%fat yogurt and light mayo.

This was a hit at 4th of July BBQ. I used prepped cabbage and broccoli. Held up great in near 100 heat. Was nice for those who liked a little heat and those who don't.

I found myself actually adding more lime juice and then some rice vinegar. No sweet for me. Then I tossed in some jalapeno and crushed red pepper. By the end, it was pleasantly tart with good spice... to my liking!

I made this to put on grilled ahi burgers and it was perfect. I also used it in fish tacos! I love the tanginess even though others added sugar. I like it just the way it is written. I will definitely make this again.

I made this from the magazine before reading reviews here- and my coworker and I agreed that a little splenda made it better. It seems others felt it needed a little sweetness to balance the lime. Splenda was all we had in the office. I think I'll try adding a little honey next time. It was good as written- but not great.

I added chopped peanuts and my husband and I both thought that without them it wouldn't have been great.

Rating: 3
Very good flavor without any additions or substitutions especially if only being used as an accompaniment. Definitely add a bit of sugar to cut down on the sour taste from the lime juice, however, if you're serving to a large group that is expecting more of a typical slaw flavor.

I wanted to love this recipe, especially after reading the reviews. I forced myself to eat several servings after all of the work it took. However, after following the recipe exactly and serving it to guests (who will eat almost anything I put in front of them) most of this slaw ended up in the trash.

Made this for a BB-Q and it went over well, but I felt it could use more spice. Next time I might use a jalapeno & include the seeds. Best if allowed a day or two in the fridge.

I am not a big slaw fan but I set out to make whatever the recipe of the day was. I am so glad I did! I left out the peppers and LOVED every bite. Will make this again and again. Great advice to double the recipe. My husband and I almost ate this completely I will double for guest.

I also used packaged slaw, which made this an easy slaw to whip up. This one is a keeper and I will make it again and again. People who don't like slaw, like this dish. The lime is perfect and adds the zing that most slaws don't have. Double the recipe!

I used the packaged slaw, which was easier and had more color...I used a jalapeno instead, which added perfect taste of heat.

I served this as a side to McCormick Baja Citrus-marinated grilled shrimp and it was yummy. A super easy, make-ahead meal. We made shrimp tacos with it the next night and I liked that even better!

This had an interesting flavor, but I found it kind of sour. Maybe too much lime juice on my part? I even added a little sugar to it. I like the idea of putting it on a burger or taco...it wasn't well received at my table though. Not your typical coleslaw, and I think that threw my family off.

Guests really liked this recipe with many going back for seconds. The dressing is tangy and flavorful. I made the dressing in advance and refrigerated it until mixing it with the cabbage just before dinner. This dish went well with grilled pork tenderloin.

This was a big hit at a summer party, I added carrots for some color and granulated garlic instead of pressing fresh. It was yummy, but not exceptional.

this is pretty much how i've been making cole slaw for a few years. exact proportions adjusted to whats on hand. i use equal portions of mayo, yogurt,sour cream, and probably less of all 3 than whats called for here. personal preference, i like the dressing a little lighter. also, while this slaw holds up well to the test of time, i prefer it the day its made. yum.
