As others stated, use much less oil. I only trimmed the scallions (did not halve them) and threw in the garlic cloves in their skins so they roasted nicely. I did not use the herbs. We loved the taste and texture, which caramelized nicely. The beans were done in about 1/2 hour.

Excellent reviews all around our table...even from those who don't like green beans! I also used only half the oil and it was enough. Have recently tried it with brussel sprouts; another hit!

This is so tasty and delicious! I cut the recipe in half the first time around, since I was only serving four people. These were gobbled up so fast that I wished I had made more. Leftovers (if any) good in a dinner salad too.

I was disappointed with the appearance of this dish which is why I've only given it two forks. Perhaps I didn't cook them long enough though.

Excellent recipe and it has become a staple on our dinner table.

i made these for thanksgiving and they were superb. Do not change a thing, but the beans do shrink......A LOT. I would not hesitate to make 3 pounds next time.

I didn't care for the beans, I overcooked them, but there were lots of compliments around the table so I'll try these again. Less oil is needed; I like the idea of adding bacon on top per another review. THE KEY is to really watch the beans and pull them out of the oven when you feel they are done. I got busy towards the end and they were in the oven 10-20 min. too long for me - far too many crispy green beans.

Really delicious & easy, loved by all - as several other cooks mention, you don't need so much oil. We garnished with lots of crispy chopped bacon. Ignore the photo & think with your fork instead!

I really wanted this to be good but the beans came out really dry. I think it would be best with frozen green beans.

Wonderful alternative to typical steamed green beans and way better than the usual green bean casserole mess. We used beans from the freezer and they worked great. Will definitely make again.

The most delicious beans ever ever...rich and carmelized. I made them for Thanksgiving and they were a big hit, a new fave. I used less oil and used dried rosemary, garlic sage and fresh thyme...just because that was what I had.

I was a bit skeptical when I saw the photo on the website but boy was I wrong! So easy to make and absolutely delicious!

My family loves grilled green beans, so I gave this a try. It was excellent. We just happened to have had a guest for dinner, and she begged for the recipe. I did dramatically reduce the oil in the dish and used shallots in place of the garlic, as my family really doesn't like garlic much. I did shorten the time down to about 30 minutes. So I definitely will be making it again.

Looks terrible and who'd want to eat vegetables that have been cooked that long???

We've made this twice (with less oil). It was a big hit and plan to make this a Thanksgiving tradition! Very flavorful.

This was a great recipe. I served it for Thanksgiving and two of my guests asked for the recipe. I've made it twice, once with dried thyme and ground sage. Fresh or dried work fine. Experiment with the amount of oil. You may be able to get away with less.

Everyone loved this vegetable dish at Thanksgiving. I only used 2T olive oil, and doubled the herbs. Also used haricots verts. A great dish for a party because you don't need to do anything last minute on the stove - it just roasts in the oven.

Delicious - made it for Thanksgiving as a more interesting green bean dish, but they were cooked in no more than 30 minutes.

I made this with yellow wax beans because the grocery store was out of fresh green beans. Took a little longer to cook but still turned out amazing!

I would direct people to the "Green Beans with Caramelized Shallots" at this website... much simpler, takes much less time, and flavors and textures much fresher. Easy to tweek using bacon/bacon grease, garlic, at the front end or splash of brandy/cognac at the finish. A 15 min Wow! vs. a 1 hour eahh!

They look so unappetizing, I can't imagine serving them to anyone.

I too was surprised at how good this was. I will cut back the cooking time and also the amount of oil. We will be having this on Thanksgiving!

I parboiled the beans and put them under the broiler as I was short on time. Added the herbs and garlic 2 minutes before it was done and it was divine. Easy and delicious. I think you can easily cut the oil in half and not ruin the results. I will be making this again and again.

Really good alternative to the usual greenbeans. I only cooked about 45 minutes and they seemed more than done enough. Next time I'll probably cook them closer to 1/2 hour.

Was surprised at how good this was. I think the recipe calls for too much oil, however, so I am going to try less next time. Everything else was great.
