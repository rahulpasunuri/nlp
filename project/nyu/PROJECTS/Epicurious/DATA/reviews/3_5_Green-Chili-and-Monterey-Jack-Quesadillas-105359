I didn't have any fresh chili on hand so I diced some canned chipotles in adobe and smeared it on top of the cheese mixture before I put it in the skillet. I simply sprayed the skillet with cooking spray to cut down on oil. It was very good and very easy!

Delicious recipe! I used half dry, aged monterey jack and half regular jack and I think it really helped bump up the flavor. These are very tasty and one of those recipes I'll make again and again.

This was great! I used large jalenpeno toritllas and served with black beans, salsa and guac on the side. Yum! I'm sure I will refer to this many times in the future, with lots of variations.

This was pretty tasty. I left out the cilantro (my boyfriend is a cilantro hater) and upped the garlic a little. Although it's just a fancier version of a grilled cheese sandwich, it's very good. I used Whole Foods medium spicy fresh salsa, and that was a good combination with the cheese and the peppers. I found that I had to keep an eye on the peppers, and used a lower heat setting to cook them for a little longer, and it took a few minutes (like four) to get the garlic cooked with the peppers. All in all, a good, very filling dinner.

I loved the recipe. It was a major hit at my dinner party served as appetizers. Lots of good guac and sour cream are essential. I found that I did not use as many chiles as suggested and leftovers (which I used in an omlette the next morning).

Tastes like I paid a fortune at a restaurant to make this meal. By the time I cooked this recipe my cilantro was not good to use, but this recipe is still outstanding!!!! It can only get better with cilantro. Use olive oil with garlic in it and added double the garlic suggested.

Excellent! As did other reviewers, I added shredded chicken to the mix. Got rave reviews from all.

We made these with and without chicken for a football party. Big hit, especially with our 2-year-old

This is a great recipe to play around with and add your favourite ingredients. I've used ground beef, sliced beef, sliced chicken, even just plain 'ol cheese quesadillas (used monterey and cheddar) are all delicious. I served, as so many before me, with sour cream & salsa on the side. My son, who is so picky he'll hardly eat anything, LOVED this recipe. 'Nuff said.

This dish was simple and fast, very tasty and, judging by the reaction of my husband and kids (the quesadillas disappeared quickly to rave reviews between mouthfuls), it will become a staple at our dinner table. I served the quesadillas with sour cream, guacamole, and additional salsa on the side.

A great-tasting meal that's easy to put together after a long day of work. I had some smoked pepper salsa handy, which was a nice addition.
