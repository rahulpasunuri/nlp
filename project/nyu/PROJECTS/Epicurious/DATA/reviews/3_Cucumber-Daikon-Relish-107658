Easy to make and an excellent side for both Miso Marinated Salmon as well as a Miso-Glazed sea bass. I would cut the rice vinegar to less than 1/3 and adjust the sugar accordingly

Made this along with the salmon dish and jasmine rice w/edamame. Generally not a fan of cucumbers, but could not get enough of this salad. Have made it several times now - great for a low-cal lunch.

Very good - I was so pleased to be able to recreate such an authentic flavor so easily. Works very well with Chicken Satay (recipe from another site).

Excellent recipe. To me, seemed to recreate the unique taste I'd only found in restaurants. I add finely sliced carrots in equal amount to the daikon. Very popular in our house and goes great with chicken satay skewers.

Delicious! Well worth the effort and pairs very nicely with the miso-marinated salmon.

I have made the Miso marinated salmon and Daikon Cucumber relish many times and always get raves for it. I use 1/2 cup Spenda instead of the sugar in the relish. My husband loves the leftover dressing on his rice.

I thought this relish was delicious! You definitely need to drain the dressing, but the flavors are amazing. I served it last night with the miso marinated salmon (always a winner) and I had the leftover relish for breakfast!

The daikon did not mix well with the cucumber, left a weird taste in the sauce. Otherwise, cucumber would've tasted fine with the rest of the ingredients.

This was tasty, but I would cut back the vinegar a bit (and maybe reduce the sugar to compensate), because I found it too watery even though I followed the instructions exactly. Very nice complement to the Miso-Marinated Salmon recipe on this site.

I served this relish with the Miso-Marinated Salmon. Relish is a good way to use plentiful cucumbers from the garden. Two comments: I halved the amount of sugar and it was still a bit to sweet. I also halved the amount of cayenne and it was still HOT. (my cayenne is extra hot). I liked that too sweet, too hot taste - my husband's tastes would like each to be toned down just a bit.
