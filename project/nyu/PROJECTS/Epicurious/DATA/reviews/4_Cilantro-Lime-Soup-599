The soup was fabulous! I made it for some girlfriends, and we really enjoyed it! It seems pretty healthy, and it's deff delicious! As a college student I will make this soup again for sure, because it is so easy to make and tasty.

Didn't have corn so used fresh brussels sprouts and a few chopped olives. The soup is excellent and very easy to make. My wife and son loved it so much that they want me to make it again soon.

Loved this recipe! I made some alterations from another Mexican Lime Soup. I used 9 cups of broth, substituted an additional 1/4 cup of cilantro for the cilantro sprigs, added 1 tsp cumin, 1 cup black beans, and topped with crushed tortillas. My entire family enjoyed it.

I love this soup! It was shockingly easy and really, really tasty. I left out the chicken, and used veggie broth and the juice from 2.5 lemons instead of lime. I also used a can of tomatoes that came with jalapeno seasonings added. The huge bunch of cilantro is what adds so much flavor.

This is a wonderful recipe! It's so fast and easy. I forgot to grab corn at the grocery store, so I ended up improvising and using thinly sliced green and yellow squash. It turned out great!! I also added half a jalapeno. I'll definitely make it again.

This was very good, and easy to make. I also added some black beans to make it more filling. I feel like it could have taken even more cilantro at the beginning. Still very good, and we would prob make it again at some point.

So good. My kids even love it!

I thought this was very good, although I did make a few adjustments: I added dried cumin and oregano with the chili powder, I used a 14oz. can of petite cut tomatoes with juices instead of fresh tomatoes, I cut down the broth to 4 cups, and I added a few splashes of Tobasco sauce for heat. I also cooked the chicken breasts whole and shredded them afterwards (looks more authentic). Served with extra slices of lime, avocado, sliced jalapeno peppers (my fiancee is into heat), along with the sour cream & cilantro. Delicioso!

I thought it needed about half the broth and to cook longer. I added 1/3 cup rice, more lime juice, and slices of avocado.

This is the best soup I have ever had! It was so easy to make, and everyone loved it. We were also hungry and it was cold, so this soup hit the spot.

Rating: 4
Mmmmmm! Fairly easy to make compared to other cilantro soup recipes I've tried. I was afraid that 1 tbsp of chili powder would be too much, but you couldn't distinctly taste it in the soup. I added white rice to make it more of a complete meal. I also used 4 cups of broth, and that was plenty. Will make again, next time with avocado.

simply wonderful soup. I make it alot and add a can of black beans. VERY VERY TASTY :)

I really miss my spell-checker and also forgot to mention that I put in a fresh cayenne pepper from the garden, with a couple of slits cut in the sides, when I put in the tied cillantro and removed it when I removed the tied cillantro.

I loved this recipe. I added sour cream and shredded cheese for garnish. Some heat from peppers, as other reviewers suggested, would be great.

I have four children, so my cooking has to be REAL fast. I used the exact ingredients, with canned corn, canned tomatoes, and bottled lime juice. It was terrific. I'd recommend this speedy version to anyone.

I love this soup- in the winter I omit the lime and add New Mexican chiles when you add the cilantro and remove them after simmering.

Rating: 2
Dissapointed in this soup. To the simmering soup I added corn cobs (good move) and lime halves (bad move). It came out tasting bitter and too lime-y. Would make this again without lime halves to see if the stellar results would occur. I used bone-in chicken and simmered for a much longer time than 10 minutes.

Rating: 3
Thanks to all the reviewers' suggestions, I ended up with a flavorful and chock-full-of-"stuff" soup using 4 c chicken broth, 2 chicken breasts, 1 large onion, 2 garlic cloves, 2 tomatoes, 3 ears of corn, 2 limes (~1/3c juice), 1.5T chipotle peppers in adobo, and 1/2 bunch of cilantro. (Next time I might up the broth a bit and reduce the chipotle to 1T, though.) I didn't bother with the salt and pepper, but I thought the dollop of sour cream helped to balance out the spiciness. I've frozen single-size portions to bring for lunch, and right now I'm happily finishing a serving which tastes just as fresh as it did yesterday. It's more trouble, but I highly recommend using fresh corn.

I can't believe I forgot to review this one when I first made it. It tastes, strikingly, like a liquid enchilada. . . a good one. Simple to make, excellent results. I actually have let the lime halves cook in the broth with the herbs before removing them; adds a little something, in my opinion.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! This was simply excellent, and I will make it again and again. Note: For me, 1 corn cob yielded almost one cup of corn; I used two large tomatoes for 1 cup; and two limes gave me 1/4 cup of lime juice.

Thought this soup was marvelous. As others report, a really nice blending of flavors, esp w/the lime. One suggestion - it got hot here, so we served it chilled, like a gazpacho. We crumbled blue corn tortilla chips on top and everyone had compliments!

Very easy and delicious. I even left out the chicken and it was still yummy!

Really great. I used ground Cayenne pepper instead of the chili powder, which made it spicier. Also, I doubled the corn and used a can of chopped tomatoes instead of fresh. I like this soup because it doesn't have to sit for a day before it tastes good (although all soups seem to be better a day later...)!

Rating: 4
Wonderful flavor! I didn't seed the tomatoes and they still tasted great. Also, I didn't add any salt or pepper because the flavor was great. I highly recommend garnishing with sour cream.

Excellent and quick to make. I used fresh corn and tomatoes and added wome extra of each. Also I threw the cobbs in while it was cooking. Homemade chicken stock is the only thing that could make it better!

After reading the reviews of this soup I couldn't wait to make it. Taking into consideration all the other reviews I went on my merry way to shop for the groceries needed. Changes I made which made a hearty soup = just over 2 cups of corn and just over 2 cups of tomatoes. I added a full bunch of cilantro as it was easier than separating. I also added only 1/2 tablespoon of chili as my husbands taste buds have no been killed yet and he can't take the heat! With these changes made the soup was delicious and has now taken tied first place with another soup we found on epicurious (Kale and White Bean Soup). I was also cooking for young children so I cooked up some rice (cooked in broth) and served it over the rice - a hit!

The lime juice is what adds sparkle and makes this recipe rise above what would otherwise be a standard hum-drum veggie soup. Because good tomatoes are out of season, I added half a can of tomatoes with diced chiles for extra kick and served with a side of lightly fried and salted flour tortilla strips. Refreshing and satisfying at the same time!!

Rating: 4
Used a large Vidalia onion and 4 cloves garlic. After the broth addition, added 2 handfuls fresh cut green beans, 4 ears fresh cut corn along with 2 ripe tomatoes and chopped chicken. That, along with the suggestions of jack cheese, avocado, and tortilla strips gave the soup plenty of substance. Also supplied some minced jalapeno and chopped green onion for those who wanted it spicier. 1/3 cup fresh lime juice was perfect. Very close approximation to soupa de lima from Cozumel/Isla Mujeres in Mexico.

Rating: 4
Not sure about the need to add more substance to this soup... though I do usually increase the amt of chicken, corn, & tomatoes (and broth!). I also cut up some corn tortillas into strips and fry them in some vegetable oil, salt as soon as they're done, and then pile them on top of the soup before serving. When the season's right I also add sliced avocado as a garnish alongside the sour cream. Yum!

The combination of cilantro and lime is delicious! I add celery to the soup as well. Very easy to make. Would definitely recommend this recipe!!!

This was a definite "do again" recipe! I took the former reviews to heart and used only 3 cups of chicken broth. I used ancho chile powder (2/3 Tablespoon) for extra heat. I used rice instead of corn and cooked it for 20 minutes instead of 10 minutes. I cut up some avocado and poured the soup over the avo. Outstanding!

Rating: 2
This soup has a good flavor, but I think it contains nearly twice too much broth for the amount of "stuff" in the soup. I also think that it could use a bit more lime juice (perhaps 1/3 cup). Next time, I may add a can of stewed tomatoes (including the juice) and one can of chicken broth plus either rice or tortilla strips.

Rating: 3
I felt the soup needs to cook longer than 10 minutes to develop its flavors, but the combination of ingredients is excellent. I agree with most reviewers that it needs something of more substance. I added 2 cubed Yukon Gold or other potatoes (not Russet), or so, during the last 15 minutes of cooking.

This soup was great! I kept in the cilantro, added pieces of lime and more onions while it was cooking. Overall, very good base, just "doctored" it up a bit.

Everyone loved this exquisite-tasting soup! It also looks beautiful while the yellow corn, red tomato, and green cilantro are cooking together. The only thing I can possibly think of changing for next time is increasing the amount of "stuff" in the soup.

I LOVE this soup. I've made it twice in the past two months. I used less broth than the recipe calls for and more lime. I'll make it over and over from now on.

Rating: 3
A delicious light summer soup. The flavours blend exquisitely. I used the amount of lime juice called for (just short of one large lime) and thought it worked well. Adding extra chicken, tomatoes, or onions wouldn't hurt to give it a little more body, but it's superb as written. Definitely something I'll fix again for company!

Rating: 3
Wow this soup is really good. I made it because I needed something new to do with chicken and even on a really hot Texas day in july it made a great and easy dinner. I also added slice avocado and a little bit of jack cheese when I served it. I couldn't keep my roommates out of the pot.

Rating: 2
This is good, but I had to add a bit to it. I think it needs a touch more spice, maybe more garlic, but the fresh vegetables and the sprightliness of the lime juice make for a good springboard recipe. I think mine needed a bit more chicken. But I will try it again. It's very pretty soup!

My wife LOVES the lime soup we had when in Cozumel. This recipe is the only one we have found that fulfills her cravings for limesoup. Although I did add A LOT more lime juice then the recipe called for.

I lived in Merida, Yucatan when I was nine, and sopa de lima (lime soup) was one of my favorite dishes. This recipe comes closer than any I've found to approximating the flavors I remember. I usually add more chili powder and more cilantro than the recipe calls for. Also, I've made a vegetarian version, with tempeh instead of chicken and veggie broth instead of chicken broth-- it was quite good.

Delicious! Added 2 tablespoons of Chipoltle in Adobo (from Chile Today-Hot Tamale - 1-800-Hot-Pepper)and it gave the soup a great "kick".

I really like this soup. It had a great Tex-Mex taste. I didn't use chicken and I took the advice of some of the other cooks and used a bit less lime juice. I added the lime juice a little at a time until I got the taste I was looking for. This is a keeper!

This soup was delicious! Next time, I will add more vegetables. You could even leave out the chicken, and it would make a great vegetable soup. I'd recommend using a little less lime since it was quite tangy.

Wow, is the only description that anyone has when they try it. It has such an refreshing flavor from the lime and the cilantro is mellowed enough even for non-cilantro lovers. If I had to choose only one soup to ever eat again, it would be this one! Instead of the chicken breasts, I use fresh chicken tenders that I cut in half. They are more tender than breasts and most of the time cheaper too. Less cutting also is attractive.

This soup is so wonderful. I used seafood; chunks of red snapper and shrimp in lieu of chicken - it was wonderful. I topped the soup with crumbled Mexican cheese and avacado slices. Nice texture and delicious flavor - I am looking forward to making this soup when its ingredients are in season - frest vine-ripened tomatoes, grilled sweet corn on the cobb, and avacados - think I'll use lobster tails...yum!

this soup went head-to-head with three others at a new year's day open house and won hands down. you can simplify it further by substituting fresh supermarket salsa for the tomatoes and hot pepper. grilled corn also makes a wonderful addition.

Easy to make, and very tasty. The flvors blend exceptionally well. I have modfied the recipe by increasing the chicken broth to 6 cups, and adding 3/4 cup of cooked white rice just before serving. I have also found that the cooked soup freezes well.
