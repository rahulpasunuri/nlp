I cooked this to save the leftovers of the Holiday roast...The beef was already cooked, of course, but I made the broth with it anyway. Used 1/2 the guajillos and did not add the chiles de arbol. It was pleasantly spicy and would have been overwhelming if done with all the chiles they recommend. Very yummy over (leftover) mashed potatoes :) Next time I'll make with tortillas and serve as tacos.

I used a 2 1/2 lb. chuck roast, cut into 4 chunks and put it in a slow cooker on high for about 4 1/2 - 5 hours. The meat was incredibly moist and tender. I also left out the arbol chiles in the sauce, but I didn't feel like I was missing anything. I served it with corn tortillas, guacamole, homemade salsa, cilantro/onion, Mexican blend cheese and sour cream. It was very easy to make but the taste was much more sophisticated than the recipe indicates. I also served Tijuana rice and frijoles as sides. Ole!! Everyone loved it.

Very tasty. Made this with 3lbs of chuck roast I had divided into three big chunks. Cooked the meat in a pressure cooker instead. Cooking time was 1 hour on high pressure (2) setting. Left the arbol chiles out of the sauce. Was hot enough as-is and you can always let guest sprinkle some on at the table.

I made this for breakfast last 4th of July to prepare for a long day of cooking and grilling with a bunch of friends. It was a massive hit and really easy to make, even though I had to get up at 5am to make it in time for everyone. Cook from Baltimore: depending on the exact quality of skirt steak, you will need to adjust your simmering time, but it's easy to check on it to see if it needs to simmer longer. I ended up simmering for a little over 3hrs and it came out perfect.

My family and I really liked this, but my family thought that the beef needed to be simmered for a lot more than the 2 1/2 hours that I gave it. Also, unless you like REALLY hot food, I would suggest adding most of the peppers, tasting it, and then adding more peppers if you want to. Having said that, though, I do have to say that my peppers may have been hotter than usual. We served this with tortillas, corn, diced fresh onion, and Spanish rice, and it was delicious. I would also suggest cutting the shredded beef into strips that are no more than 2 inches long, because longer strips are really hard to eat. Overall, I thought that this was good, and I may make it again.

This was fantastic. We couldn't get skirt steak so we used flank steak with great results. This recipe made piles of leftovers, which we recycled into enchiladas a couple nights later. The beef tastes good at first, but definitely tastes better the next day. We served it with corn tortillas and avocado and were really quite happy.
