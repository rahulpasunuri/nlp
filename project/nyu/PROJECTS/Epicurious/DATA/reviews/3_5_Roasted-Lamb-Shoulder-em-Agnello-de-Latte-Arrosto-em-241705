I made this recipe for a dinner party for 8 (with 1.5 times the recipe) and almost had a disaster. It would be helpful if the recipe would say how much liquid should be in the pan in relation to the meat -- e.g. "until it half covers the meat" or whatever it's supposed to be. Mine was covered with liquid the entire baking time. So it came out of the marinade an unappetizing grey, and then came out of the oven even more grey, tasting of and with a texture like boiled meat. It looked nothing like the photograph. [My advice is use the liquid sparingly until it half covers the meat, check and add as needed, and take it out when it looks browned and done.] I did not go to the last step as turning the meat on the stove in the sauce didn't seem like it would help. In a panic, I called a friend who writes cookbooks with celebrity chefs. On her recommendation, I steamed some carrot rounds and added them to the meat -- for color. I browned the meat (in oil), deglazed the pan with a little of the marinade / cooking liquid, poured that on the meat, reduced the rest of the sauce in a pot, added lots of salt and HONEY (mine was too sour, perhaps because I used half white wine vinegar when the red ran out), individually plated it with fresh rosemary, and (THE BEST PART) called it "lamb brisket with a mediterranean jus". No one raved, but everyone ate what they were served. I have a feeling this could be really good, but I'm not going to find out.

If you follow this receive it is perfect. I have read the lesser reviews and I believe a step has been missed in each. There is a stage where the lamb is in a lot of liquid but the recipe states that the liquid should be boiled off. I did not have a press purée so I used a blender. It was perfect. I used 3.5 lbs for 7 people and there was not a scrap left. We had fresh hot biscuits with this and my American friends loved it.

This was very good, but not as great as I had expected based on the reviews. Maybe it needed more salt, or I just didn't use enough herbs, or something. I might make it again, but I'm not going to go out of my way for it.

This recipe probably would be fine as written. I used moose shoulder roast and I think it needed a few more hours...was a little on the tough side. I also was unable to marinate it for 24 hours which would have helped. Think I will try this in the slow cooker next time.Also maybe add some bacon fat (if using moose).

I extended this recipe to accommodate 14 guests. Don't know what went wrong, as I perfectly followed the recipe. I consider myself an accomplished cook but this dish didn't show it!! The combination of broth and marinade created a gigantic pool of liquid. It was as if the meat was swimming and never had the opportunity to really cook down, instead it over cooked. Lots of work for lots of disappointment. Maybe I should try it again for a small group. ah well......

This is a GOURMET recipe!! I used on 2.25 pounds of lamb for my husband and myself for our empty-nest Easter dinner. I cut all ingredients to 1/3 of the recipe. I followed the marinade directions 24 hours ahead, just as instructed. If I were doing this for 6 people with the larger amount of lamb, I think this would be a challenge. I was nervous about the 425 oven for 2 1/2 hours. I used my blue enameled roast pan with lid, and kept the lid ajar for the first hour. I pulled it out at 30 minutes to turn the pieces. After 1 hour, I turned the oven down to 375 and removed the lid. BTW, the cinnamon makes the dish smell so wonderful! Then, after the next 30 minutes at 375, the lamb pieces looked brown. So, short of the 2 1/2 hours of the recipe, I removed it from the oven and used my meat thermometer to check the internal temp. Pressing the veggies into the gravy was excellent! I used a turkey stock in the pan. No additonal seasoning was necessary. My husband RAVED over this! He opened a Syrah and said this meal was better than anything we could have had in Pasadena for $50 or more. I served asparagus on the side. We took a hike before enjoying strawberry shortcake for dessert.

Very tasty - I did not have a sieve so i just removed fat and mashed about 1/2 the veggies into a puree to serve with the meat- it was great!

Followed the directions and it came out perfectly.I think letting it marinate for at least 24 hours is key. Put the vegetables thru a food mill and the sauce was delicious. You won't have any leftovers.

Followed the recipe, except that I only added about a tablespoon of oil for the marinade and I only added about a half a cup of homemade beef broth. Plenty of sauce left after nearly 3 hours of cooking. VERY DELICIOUS and sooo easy to make. Will make again!

This didn't work out for me. I'm sure that I carry the blame, because others had great success with it. I don't like the fact that the meat was basically stewing in the broth. I was surprised that it was not pan seared first. I found the flavor bland and the texture unpleasant.

This dish was a big hit...and there are no leftovers. I made a smaller version with 5 lamb shoulder steaks cut thinner than the recipe calls for. It was perhaps 3 pounds total. To compensate I cooked it about an hour and a half, removing the foil after 30 minutes. I didn't note the reduction of the sauce and glazing of the meat at the end at first reading. This was an important step, making for an exceptionally flavorful dish my partner said was the best lamb she has ever eaten. I served it with mashed sweet potatoes.

This was delicious. The lamb and pan items didn't "caramelize" as expected, but it was tender and delicious. I served it w/fresh mashed potatoes, roasted butternut squash and green beans. Thank you!

My mother grew up on a turkey farm, so I brought this dish to go alongside the turkey that many family members craved. Lamb was more popular than turkey this year! I followed the recipe exactly, and didn't get as much carmelizing as I expected, but it was tender and flavorful and wonderful. My father, who had no intention of trying any, was coerced into a 'thank you bite' and pronounced it similar to- but better than- pot roast. This is a high compliment from him! I served it with steamed kale and roasted butternut with pecans and parsley. We'll do it again this Easter!

I used about 6 thick shoulder chops that the butcher had already cut. This was a great recipe and a bit different from the usual roasted lamb. I did not have a problem with the liquid drying out, but it did start reduce and I had to add some additional stock the last half hour. The sauce was so good!!! Really great and I will make it again. This dish, however, is not a traditional dish- and for those wanting that roated lamb thing, it is not the same. But it certainly was yummy.

I bought 7 pounds of lamb shoulder for our Easter dinner and followed the instructions and video carefully. I cannot tell you how wonderful this tasted. I had hoped to have leftovers - not! We had 19 for Easter dinner and even the children loved this one! Definitely a keeper.

I made this for Easter and it was incredible. I'll make it with more vegetables like a pot roast next time. I only marinated it for about an hour before cooking it, and the flavor was just amazing. Definitely a keeper.

I bought the lamb shoulder before I knew what I was going to do with it so had to make the stew with what I had on hand. cinnamon powder vs sticks, dried herbs vs fresh, no time to marinade, just all of it (with lots of extra carrots) thrown into a pot big enough to cover it, and into the Aga for 2.5 hours. I just served it in chunks and thickened the gravy with Bisto (I know, a real cheat). Served it with oven roasted potatos and...IT WAS FANTASTIC. There were three adults and an 8 yr old and not a drop left! I am making it again tonight. I will try to follow the recipe more closely, but I really cant imagine it being any better!

Ended up marinating 2 days not 1, omitting only the celery in the marinade. Cooked like a dream and really was a lamb pot roast. Tender and delicious. A little heavy for Easter but DEFINATEly a do over!
