I made this for the first time in several years - my last review of it was in 2003! Still very good. I used a mixture of Granny Smith and Pink Lady apples and I made it as a Galette this time. Very easy. The combo of Rosemary and the Apples is sophisticated and makes a wonderful light dessert.

delicious - have made this several times now, and it always gets compliments. Such an easy idea, but a nice twist on good old apple and cinnamon.

I agree with the others--too much sugar. It is also too runny, even with 1 tbsp. of cornstarch. I've made it three times and varied and it's always too runny. I'll try a different apple tart recipe and use rosemary with that recipe. Thought the crust was easy to make but bland.

This really deserves 3 1/2 forks - I have made this tart three times now and everyone who I've served it to has loved it. The last time I made it I used Mutsu apples and thyme leaves rather than rosemary, and it was superb. I love it with rosemary, but highly recommend trying it with thyme too, or lemon thyme if you have some. As for the crust, I don't have any complaints. When making any pastry crust I try my best to keep everything chilled and I basically handle it as if it's made of glass (i.e., don't touch it any more than absolutely necessary), and I am usually very pleased with the results. I recommend cutting the butter and then putting it in the freezer for 10-15 minutes, and definitely use icy-cold ice water rather than merely "chilled." Also - and this is the reason why I don't think store-bought crusts are worth the 15 minutes they save - the best pastry crusts require the best butter you can get your hands on - either from the farmers' market or good imported butter, such as Plugra.

This recipe was great! A big hit. I thought the dough was very easy, but didn't use all the water so add it slowly! I also thought the recipe had too much sugar, so I reduced it by about a third, added about 1T of lemon juice and a few T of flour. If you actually have left-overs, this is also great the next morning with a cup of coffee!

The rosemary and apple combination is wonderful together. But I have some modifications as well. First, more rosemary, about another teaspoon, if not more. We found the amount of sugar overwhelming, so I will add less next time. I did use a store bought crust to save time and it was ok, but next time I'll make my own (based on reviews, I won't use the pastry included here). I brushed the apples with melted butter for appearance. Also, I had to bake about 45 minutes (total). I know this is a lot of changes but it is well worth it

My husband made this for last night's dinner party and the pie was a success. The rosemary is a nice flavor surprise. I say it rates 3 forks although several of our guests say it rates 3.5 forks. We served it with vanilla custard yogurt as an optional topping. Hubby made it in a quiche pan rather than tart pan - it worked just fine.

Don't let the simplicity of this recipe deceive you--the flavors are WONDERFUL! It's always a big hit when company comes over, especially if served with ice cream.

Delightful mixture of flavors! I have to admit, I used a Pillsbury dough and fit it into a tart pan instead of making my own. It took about 4 large Granny Smith apples and I needed to cook it around 40-45 minutes. I used a little lightly whipped cream to go along with it. Delicious! 3/6/03 Update: I have made this at least 3 times...the combination of flavors is superb!

First of all let me say that the apple-rosemary combination is GREAT! Now let me say that the rest of the recipe has some serious drawbacks which I don't know how the other cooks averted. I am a very experienced cook and had serious troubles with the removable tart ring - the egg wash dripped down the sides of the crust and acted like cement, adhering the crust to the removable ring. Also, apple pie without a thickening agent is a sure-fire way of making soup - thin, runny soup. Finally, I have not had many crusts as unpaletable as this one - find a more reliable source (i.e., Julia Child). I wound up making one of these tarts, tossing it, then reconfiguring this as a bottom-crust only pie (in a regular pie plate, tossing the apples with the rosemary, sugar and adding 3 T. of cornstarch), dotting with 1-2 T. butter, folding up the sides as in the original recipe (make the circle a generous 14 inches - don't skimp), brushing with cream and sprinkling with sugar. It was fantastic. I also added the juice of 1/2 lemon which really complemented the apple-rosemary flavor. I highly recommend the concept behind this recipe, but with some of these modifications. Like the author's chocolate chip & salt cookies, she has really terrific concepts which I think need some better foundations.

Very interesting combination of flavors. I especially liked that it was not so sweet. The only change I made was to use a different crust-- I'm not very adept with pastry and given previous reviewer's difficulties, I used my only tried and true recipe (Beatrice Ojakangis' Lemon Pastry). My friends all thought it was wonderful though, and I wll definitely make this again.

I must admit I was curious about the combination of apples and rosemary but above all else I am adventurous when it comes to food. My philosophy on food I've never tries before is 'If so many people eat it,then it must be good.' Thanks for the receipe.

The flavor was excellent, but the pastry extraordinarily hard to manage. I think I'll keep the apple/rosemary combination idea, but I doubt I'll make the recipe again.

Delicious. I didn't add all the sugar the recipe called for because I wanted it to be more herbal rather than sweet, and it had a wonderful flavor. Great reviews from everyone I served it to, even the ones who don't love rosemary as much as me.

Easy to make, absolutely delicious, and unusual--my guests loved it, but it took them a while to figure out the secret ingredient.
