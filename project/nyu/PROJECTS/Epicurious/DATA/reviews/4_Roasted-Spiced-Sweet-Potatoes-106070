Awesome side dish. These are great with anything and I even ate them cold. I also dipped them in sour cream and yogurt - at different times - tasty. I can see cutting the potatoes thinner and making some sweet and spiced chips. I used olive oil instead and cut down on the hot pepper just a little - flavor explosion. If you like sweet potatoes and some flavor - you will dig it.

Really liked the spice mixture with this recipe. I cut the sweet poatoes a little thinner than recipe suggested - they were done in about 30 minutes. A great way to eat a superfood! I may bake some sweet potatoes soon and sprinkle some of the extra spice mixture in with a little butter to flavor them.

This simple but unique spice mix is perfect for the sweet potatoes!

I made it as described, leaving the skins on, using olive oil and cutting the pieces thinner (maybe 3/4 inch) and they cooked in 30 minutes. I forgot to turn them 1/2 way; I'll try that next time. DELICIOUS, EASY EASY EASY.

The ONLY way to make sweet potatoes, especially for people who don't think they like them. I know; I was one of them. :-) I also double the spices except for the crushed red pepper (same) and the kosher salt (triple). These are just too good to skip, and they go with almost anything. Tonight, it's meat loaf; my husband is delighted.

This sweet potato recipe is a winner! I followed the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing except move the pan to the top rack in the oven for the last 5 minutes so the potatoes get a little crisp around the edges.

I love these fries because they aren't bad for you and they taste so good. My only critique is that they are very spicy, so I cut down on the red pepper flakes a bit.

Rating: 4
The entire ontological point of sweet potatoes is to allow people to consume this recipe, and all other sweet potato dishes are merely side benefits. It's that good. I doubled all the spices except the pepper flakes, cut the sweet potatoes a little thinner, and maybe cooked them a little longer (until they are melt-in-your-mouth tender with slightly crispy bits at the points) and/or used a little extra oil.

Great flavors and family really loved these. I did not peel potatoes. I cut the pepper flakes down by ~half since one child doesn't like things too hot. I could not get them crisp even though I cut them thin and put on roast for another 10 minutes, but still great.

We loved this recipe! I didn't have fennel, so subbed with thyme (though I probably would have enjoyed it with fennel too!) If strips are cut thinner they bake faster and get crispier. I'm a cripy fan, the bf likes um a bit softer so we went with 1/2 inch wedges and did about 15 min and 15 min.

Rating: 3
As others suggested I cut my sweet potato wedges thinner than the recipe called for. I took the skin off but there's no need to. The combination of seasoning was incredible! Who knew!? My only problem was I was unable to get these crispy but man, even soft and mushy the flavors were out of this world that I didn't mind a single bit. Sweet potatoes were a better alternative than regular bland potatoes...I can't believe I haven't been cooking with them before.

These were pretty good sweet potatoes, but I prefer the thyme-roasted sweet potatoes from this site. They're similar in that it's a savory way to make sweet potatoes, and it's a little spicy. I gave that recipe 4 forks, and that's REALLY saying something--I rarely give recipes 4 forks. As for this recipe, I agree with the people who say that you should try the fennel even if you don't normally like it, because it basically blends in with the potatoes, and adds another layer of flavor without adding a fennel taste. Also, the cooking time in this recipe is not adequate. It's true that if they burn a tiny bit, they carmelize, which is yummy. Also, there's no need to peel the potatoes. It's more nutritious not to, and the skins are not noticeable.

This is the first sweet potato recipe I really enjoyed. Why people put sugar and marshmallows on them I do not understand, it makes them tooooo sweet and I have never enjoyed them. This was outstanding and I will make this again, although I will cut the potatoes into chunks instead of wedges the next time.

Rating: 3
This had very good potential (the spice combo is great), and I will make it again, but next time will lower the oven temperature a bit and make the slices of sweet potato a bit thinner. The few thin slices in the batch I made got burnt, but the very thick ones were soft and not at all crispy. Making them all consistently somewhere in the middle will improve the outcome.

These are some of the best sweet potato fries I have ever tasted, and they aren't even fried! I used anise seed instead of the fennel. Yum!

I discoverd this recipe two years ago and it was a hit. I have made several large batches since then because I was going through the mixture so quickly. I even bought very nice metal tins and gave the mixture away for gifts. Everyone raved about it and has asked for more! I use olive oil instead of vegie oil and use it on all types of vegies, especially zucchini which turns out wonderful when grilled. Make this and use your imagination on what you put it on!

Rating: 4
These are amazing! I have made them at least ten times in the month since discovering the recipe. I've actually started making a 5x batch of the spices in my blender so that I just have a baggie full on demand! Also, in general, I cannot stand fennel, so to anybody tempted to leave something out, I urge you to try the recipe as written, which is how I've left it and love it!

Most excellent! I didn't change anything. Served with grilled port tenderloin, apricot-chipotle salsa, and green beans. Will definitely make again - soon.

These are delicious, and I'm not a sweet potato fan! I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of onion powder to the spice mix. I also subbed sea salt for kosher salt. The flavours balanced perfectly. To cut the potatoes, use a cleaver and pound down (shielding your hand with a towel). Much easier that way. Will make these nutricious wedges again for sure! Very tasty

I made this dish with only one slight modification which was to reduce the pepper flakes to 3/8 tsp as 1/4 tsp didn't seem like enough but 1/2 tsp seemed like too much to someone who is sensitive to "heat." As the dish was cooking, the aromas seeping from the oven were delightful and we enjoyed the savory seasonings as a great change of pace from the way in which sweet potatoes are normally served here in the Deep South. I reheated in the microwave and was less than pleased with the texture, but the taste was still very good. For some, it might be worth it to reheat the leftovers in the oven or perhaps a toaster oven.

I searched for quite a while for a savory recipe for sweet potatoes and decided on this one. Everyone is right, the spice combination is delicious. It's refreshing to see a recipe that is simple, uses basic ingredients mother nature created, and allows them to shine. As suggested earlier, make extra of the spice recipe for future use and don't omit the fennel because it is an integral ingredient that compliments the others. Sometimes there are ingredients we don't like because we've never had them in a way that appeals to us. If you thought you didn't like fennel, be open minded and give this combo a shot. Having this again within 24 hours.

I was looking for a way to prep baby sweet potatoes when I came across this recipe. Worked wonderfully. Crunchy outside. Creamy soft inside. Can't wait to try it again on regular sweet potatoes, and add some hot smoked Spanish paprika for a spicier result.

All the comments about how this wins over people who don't normally like sweet potatoes are true. Didn't have red pepper flakes so I ground a roasted fresh hot pepper in the mortar with the oil and the spices. Used garlic oil too. Really nice.

This recipe converted me from a lifelong dislike for sweet potatoes. I have made these a number of times now, and rarely modify the recipe. This seasoning blend is just right for my taste. I sometimes serve this with plain low fat sour cream or make a dip of low fat plain yogurt seasoned with a little lime and cilantro. It benefits by being served with something cooling like the dips, or perhaps pear slices would be nice. It's preferable to make the seasoning on demand, but I have made up enough of the seasoning for several batches in an airtight container to keep it handy. Keeps the prep time short and sweet, which is often a necessity.

After grinding the spices, I was skeptical because the fennel seemed to overpower the other spices. But I couldn't taste the fennel at all, and my husband, who doesn't like particularly like sweet potatoes or fennel, thought it was delicious.

This is a really nice way to prepare sweet potatoes and may even convert those who don't like sweet potatoes to change their minds. I made some changes since I didn't have the right ingredients. I used 1/2 t. ground coriander, omitted the fennel seeds, used 1/2 t. ground dried oregano and a pinch of hot red pepper flakes. I also used olive oil because I prefer it. This dish is one of my favs for a winter meal.

I've already made this a 2nd time. Used olive oil instead of veggie oil and ground coriander, about half the amount called for seeds. The first time, everyone loved it and asked for it at the next family meal. The 2nd time I made smaller wedges so they would be a bit crisper. Love the kick from the red pepper. Definitely a great change from mashed or baked regular potatoes.

The sweet potato-fennel combo is wonderful. I allowed my potatoes to get a little too brown by accident and discovered that with grapeseed oil, they carmelize rather than burn. YUM! I'm going to try to do that deliberately next time.

Have already made this recipe twice in a week. It's so good, the first time I didn't make enough! It's spicy without being overwhelmingly so, just enough to make your mouth water.

Enjoyed this a fair bit. Not "4 Forks" because it is nothing really NEW - the main technique is just baking with oil, a 'healthy' way to get a home fry taste to your potatoes. However the particular spice mix is great and the idea to use sweet potatoes is novel. I made 2 potatoes and used up all the spice mix & oil, but I did not have fennel (I am sure it would add something.)

I quadrupled the seasonings for 4 large potatoes, and used Olio Sasso olive oil. (Don't omit the fennel; it is a catalyst for the other spices!) I had my husband (who usually dislikes anise) test the results prior to taking it to a Thanksgiving dinner and had to bake more! Most dinner guests loved it in spite of the heat of the Thai peppers. It is a grown-up version that will become a tradition in our house. This is a keeper! Thanks, Gourmet (and Epicurious) for sharing it.

Wonderfully easy recipe for sweet potatoes. I doubled the spices as I like a lot, also used about 3 lbs potatoes rather than two. The only mistake I made is that I doubled the salt, also.
