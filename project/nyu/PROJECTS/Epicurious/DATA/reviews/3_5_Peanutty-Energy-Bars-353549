Add me to the cooks who had a dry, crumbly finished product. The taste was good (with only 1/2 the corn syrup) but not exceptional. One of my favorite ingredients -- the Rice Krispies! I will give it one more try but I'm going to add marshmallows a la Rice Krispie Squares and see how it goes.

Easy! Fits the bill to replace expensive store-bought alternatives, but a little overboard on the sugar, which is why it tastes so good. To eliminate crumbliness: Use 9" x 13" pan, after filling pan, then cover with a plastic bag and use your hands to compress it down. Wait until the next day to cut into squares.

Love this recipe for it'e ease of preparation and flavor. Using the wheat germ adds to flavor, and nutrition. I've subbed honey and agave syrup for the corn syrup, and like to use a tropical dried fruit mix, along with some added toasted, dried coconut.

I love the taste but they are too crumbly and misbehaving to be called bars. I will work with the sticky ingredients to remedy this problem. I too played with the ingredients based on the reviews. I used honey roasted almonds, salted peanuts, rice krispie cereal, whole oats, dried strawberries from Jungle Jim's, regular peanut butter, 50/50 agave nectar and honey, and vanilla. They taste like a PB&J sandwich. I make the Kashi bars often and they are gooey and stick together better than these so I might start by adding some molasses or maple syrup. It's a keeper of a recipe. Just know that you might be serving it in a cup or bowl and not as a bar.

Fantastic recipe. These bars taste better than any energy/granola bar you'll find at the supermarket and the recipe is easy to modify to suit your tastes. Make it on your stovetop. It keeps the mix warm and makes it easier to combine the ingredients. If you get it heated through it also makes it easy to spread in the baking dish. I was able to cut the brown sugar in half (and used honey/maple syrup for the corn syrup) and the bars still came out great. I'll fool around with reducing the sweeteners in future batches, these come out quite sweet.

Really good concept. Instead of microwaving the wet ingredients, I did it stovetop, so that I could keep the mix warm while combining everything. Subbed in some different nuts and cereal, with great results! Looking forward to experimenting with this one!

I made it per the instructions, and it's a crumbly mess. Yummy, but more like gorp than a bar -- disappointing. I did put some chocolate in for 1/5 of the nuts, which helped glue it together, but like others have found, it was difficult to stir it all together quickly enough, and it didn't hold once out of the pan. Maybe I'll try heating the wet ingredients on the stove -- they might stay hot longer so I can mix it better. And maybe add the wet to the dry instead of vice versa? Or maybe I'll just look for another recipe...

Weirdly easy (took me five minutes, maybe). I omitted the dried fruit element but otherwise followed exactly. Definitely not so good for you in terms of sugar content, but better all around than processed crapola granola bars. Very tasty stuff.

This tastes great, but mine didn't hold together. I left it overnight and it was pretty crumbly - any advice? Although we can't send it for school lunches (nut free environment), I like it for after school treats.

I would give this 4 forks, except...the first time I made it, the wet ingredients looked too dry (I had gotten distracted) and then the whole thing looked too dry when I mixed it up. So, I made another batch of the wet ingedients and mixed it in as well. To no one's surprise, the bars were so moist they just fell apart. I am now making my second batch, and did not screw up the wet ingredients. However, the whole thing still looked too dry and not at all like the bars would have any integrity after cutting. And there's lots of loose oats and wheat germ that did not pick up the wet mixture. It is, as I type, in the oven. I'm hoping warming it up will somehow melt the peanut butter/honey/sugar mix and infuse the loose stuff so that this will make actual bars. Instead of just awesome, crumbly topping for my ice cream.

Made these for my son's preschool class and everyone loved them. I was asked to print the recipe so everyone could have a copy (kids & teachers). Used dried blueberries & dried cherries for the fruit. Cut the bars small, since they don't hold together very well.

The kids can't stop eating this, my 7 year old couldn't keep his fingers out of it before it set. Made some replacements -- almond butter and cashews in place of the peanut butter and peanuts, agave and honey instead of corn syrup. Used a mix of raisins, diced prunes, diced figs, craisins and dried mango. In an 8x8 pan they are about 1" thick, so used a 9x13 instead. The recipe says to mix the first 6 ingredients, but there are only 5 dry ingredients, the optional sixth ingredient is at the end of the list.

I am giving this 3 stars for now. I made them for a long distance cycling ride and thought they packed well and tasted great. I went with all peanuts and dates for dried fruit but like another reviewer commented, I had a difficult time to mix everything together before the mixture hardened! Work very quickly! It is hard to keep everything together otherwise.

These are fantastic! They are like hearty rice krispie treats. Filling, tasty and easy to make. I will definitely make them again since I ate half the pan already.

Also, re: the nutritional value - while the type of fats in this bar aren't specified, the ingredients are all foods that contain predominately "good" fats - poly and monounsaturated fats - which actually reduce your overall levels of saturated fat and lower triglycerides. Yes, I wouldn't go and eat 3 of these in a row, but as a snack or "power" bar, these are a great, healthy and tasty option. Better than most of the processed, sitting-on-the-shelf bars out there with lots of refined sugars and preservatives.

Love this! I am no longer buying granola bars or energy bars anymore. I made my bars using almond butter and they turned out delicious. I plan to make the next batch with peanut butter & chocolate chips. The possibilities are endless! Just a word of warning: Be sure to mix quickly when adding the hot syrup to the dry ingredients. I took my time and wasn't able to mix all of my dry ingredients as the syrup hardens fast.

Simple, tasty, and a great before a workout. I went with natural peanut butter, almonds, and whole grain cereal with granola. This recipe has a lot of room to play around with ingredients to make it your own.

I'm going to try these this weekend, to share with my ultimate frisbee team. I just wanted to comment on the last post about the carb content. High carbs are desirable in an energy bar. It's useable energy. A typical Clif bar has about 40-45 gm carbs.

I made this to eat on a long distance bike ride. I made several substitutions to this recipe. The end result was very good...great flavor/texture, denser, more complex carbs and heart healthy oils, greater vitamin value, and natural sugars. Here are the substitutions: Dried Fruit: 3 mashed ripe bananas Regular Peanut Butter: All Natural Peanut Butter (drain oil and replace with honey and salt to taste) Peanuts: Slivered Almonds, finely chopped Rice Krispies: Whole grain cereal with high vitamin/mineral content (such as Total), crushed Corn Syrup: Raw honey Wheat Germ: Milled Flax Seed *OPTIONAL: 1/8-1/4tsp cinnamon (complements both the bananas and the PB)

Quick and easy summer bar. I added slivered prunes, flaked coconut, chock chips and used mixed nuts instead of just peanuts. My kids loved it and so did I.

This was a quick, easy and delicous no bake summer bar. I used mixed nuts instead of just peanuts. I added a tablespoon of coconut flakes, slivered prunes and 1/4 cup of chocolate chips. Wow!

I'm not certain this is all that "healthy"! 30 grams of carbs and 9 grams of fat per serving! UGH! For only 6 grams of protein, which is actually good for you, it's hardly worth making or eating!
