This is the biggest waste of perfectly good veal I have ever made! I have made several recipes from the epicurious web site and have been very pleased with most. I count on the reviews to determine if the recipes are worthwhile. This, by far, has been the worst recipe that I have found on this site. At the end of our meal my wife and kids were saying, "I am starved."
