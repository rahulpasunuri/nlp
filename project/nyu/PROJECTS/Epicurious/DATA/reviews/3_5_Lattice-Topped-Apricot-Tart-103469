Apricot does not have a huge following. However, I made this tart for several who stated they did not like apricots until they tasted the tart. It has tremendous apricot flavor! It's a perfect balance of textures and flavors. I too struggled with the crust, but by the second tart figured out that by adding one whole egg, in addition to the three yolks worked perfectly. I was using medium, instead of large eggs. I also used my stand up mixer with the paddle attachment, on low speed to do the kneading. I didn't discover the recipe until half way through my trees season so I only got to make about 10 tarts. But, I have already had several requests for the recipe, and am putting this in the "keepers" box to make again, year after year!

The filling concept was interesting and the fresh apricot falvor is enhanced by the three "layers" it calls for: marmalade from a jar, home-made compote and fresh fruit to top it off. But the dough is a disaster! It never came together, was ipossible to knead at all, and then it got too brown too early in the oven before the bottom crust was fully cooked.

oh also - we ate it with vanilla ice cream. heaven! as far as the crumbly dough, i think that can be a result of the fact that measuring flour by cups (rather than by weight) is quite inexact. i'm guessing that i probably packed my cups a bit more than i should have, which is why the dough was able to take more butter in order to come together. (and it wasn't greasy at all). so playing it by ear is probably the best bet....

very good, simple tart. my friends enjoyed it very much. you have to use freshly picked apricots for this - the tart depends upon it. i used a 8" x 11" tart pan, and i multiplied the recipe by 1.5. the filling was just barely enough - i used 12 apricots and next time i'd probably use 15-16 (i.e. double the number, even though my pan is only about 1/3 bigger in area. my apricots were on the smallish side.) i also pureed the filling, which worked nicely. as far as the dough - i had to use more butter to get the dough to come together (i used the equivalent of about 12 1/2 tbsps). but once i did it was fine. i didn't make the lattice top - i thought just the crust on the bottom was enough, well, crust. i would also use less sugar next time (i'd probably go down to 1/2 cup or even less) - the filling was sweet enough.

This was the best tart recipe ever for me. I used organic apricots from Whole Foods, my local produce store, and they made the entire difference. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup; no more was necessary. When it came to the dough, I experienced the crumbliness others did and I thought that by adding an additional tablespoon of butter it would help. It did not and fortunately made the crust even richer rather than ruin it. Next time I will stick to the original 11 tablespoons. In any case, I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added about 2 tablespoons of room temperature water and I gently worked it until it was smooth and pliable. That did the trick. When cutting and applying the strips, I had to pop the dough into the freezer for 20 seconds several times so that the strips would not break. The results were marvelous.

I enjoyed this tart. I too had difficulty with the crust staying together and made a crumble top. I had an 8" spring pan so the crust was a bit too thick. My husband suggested that I add more sugar and substitute brown sugar. I used 5 Tbs of dark brown sugar in the filling and it was delicious. My husband wants me to make it again!

Because of all the reviews that complained about the dough falling apart, I added water to bind it. The dough was way too mushy- I think it would have held together very well without. As it turned out, since I have an 11, rather than 9, inch pan, I just added about one half cup extra flour, and the dough was fine. I have had problems in the past with other pie doughs that don't hold together well. But that is probably more a function of trying too work it too little (because directions always caution against kneading it too much) rather than an inherent problem with the recipe. The filling was nice- a little on the tart side, but I prefer it that way. And the lattice top made it look very elegant. Don't be afraid of the dough, just knead it till it holds together well, rather than just smushing it together.

Filling has intense apricot flavor, but strips of dough broke in pieces when trying to make lattice top. Will use another crust recipe next time.

Delicious and receives rave reviews from guests. Crust often doesn't hold together well enough to make a lattice top, but mixed with cinnamon and sugar and crumbled on top tastes even better in my opinion.

Well, just made the recipie without seeing results ...but! The crust did not come together so ... the topping is a crumble crust... we will see how it turns out. So ...anyone else with this problem?

I took this to a BBQ, and it was the hit of the party! Most of the guests were Martha wannabes and begged for the recipe. I pureed half of the filling, which I spread on the preserves, then covered with the remaining apricots. Serve it with marscapone whipped with a pinch of sugar and lemon zest. Yum!

I tried this recipe when it first appeared in the magazine, and have made it constantly since then. I tease my family that they are probably sick of seeing it, but I bake it for friends, family and bake sales. It is the most consistently beautiful thing I bake, and I bake quite a lot. I have passed this recipe on to many people who have also passed it on. I think that is the best judge of a recipes' quality. I have even been asked to make it for sale at the orchard where I buy my apricots. Thanks Bon Apetite for a real winner.

I love this recipe. I made it all last summer (2000). It is not too sweet, full of fruit flavor, and is stunning to look at. I always make just a bit more of the crust, so I can be generous both with crust and lattice top. Yum.

I am not an experienced cook, but I found this dish to be pretty simple. The prep and cook time is a little more than what I would like, but it is well worth it! Also, I didn't have apricots so I used nectarine. Big hit with my family...I think all try even more fruits.

My good friend Robin made this for dessert last night and everyone at the table was just raving about it! It looked beautiful and tasted heavenly! Robin said the crust was not all that easy to prepare but she seemed to feel that it was worth the effort. I'm not a baker, but if I were, I would definitely try to make this recipe because it was truly outstanding.
