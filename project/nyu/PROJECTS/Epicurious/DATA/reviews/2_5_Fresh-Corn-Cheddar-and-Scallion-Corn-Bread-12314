This is our favorite corn bread. I use 1 cup fine ground cornmeal and 1/2 cup stone ground cornmeal. Use a good aged sharp Cheddar. We cook it in cast iron corn stick and muffin pans for a crispy outside.

I thought this was fantastic, except that it took about three times as long to finish baking as the recipe indicated. I added a smidge of melted butter to the top as soon as it came out of the oven. I served it with very flavorful chili, and it went well.

I thought this was very blah. I added a jalepeno and it still had little flavor. For all the fat and cheese, I would expect more payoff.

Bland and rubbery (from the cheese) in flat squares(from the jelly rool pan). What was I thinking to sere this for a party!

I so loved the fresh corn spoon bread which was delicious and so close to my spoon bread recipe that with the sweet fresh summer corn was a delight. Don't make any changes. Old corn would not work. Only change I would make would be a very, very slight addition of mustard. Dijon, but very slight as the fresh summer corn is sweet and very good on it's own.

I omitted the salt and the scallions and since i am located at a high elevation i had to increase the cooking time by an additional 8 minutes. With these alterations, the cornbread was great. Plus i used fresh white corn, it makes the difference.

Tastes dag nasty. I think the scallions are a bad call.

I am also glad I read the previous reviews: I omitted the salt (could add maybe 1/8 tsp), and increased the sugar to 2+1/2 tbsp. I also used frozen corn (microwaved for 3 minutes) instead of fresh, and since buttermilk is not a big thing here in Canada, I substituted 1+1/2 cups of 2% milk + 1 tsp cider vinegar, and finally, added 1/4 tsp of Cayenne pepper for a little zip. It turned out FABULOUS! I baked it in my toaster oven, and it yielded 24 mini-muffins plus one toaster-oven pan of cornbread. Yum, I would definitely make this again, it's sure to impress guests!!

Happy I read the previous reviews! My family is accustomed to "Jiffy" mix cornbread which is quite sweet. I wouldn't say this bread is "salty", but it's not close to being sweet. Tripled the sugar and sprinkled a bit more over the top. Still the kid wouldn't eat it, but the adults were pleased.

Didn't like it at all. Way too salty.

This was quick and easy and very good. Next time I think I will double the sugar. I don't normally like cornbread sweet but I think a bit more sugar would enhance the flavor.

We made this for dinner tonight along with the half time chili (which was great). The corn bread was so salty we couldnt eat it. Were going to make it tomorrow night to have with the remaining chili but with NO SALT. I think the bread would be great if the flavours weren't overpowered by salt.

Really good. Add 1 tsp chipotle chili powder (from Penzeys or somewhere else) for nice flavor. I like that it's super quick to assemble AND to bake, that it makes enough to for more than two people, and that in its thin shape it is perfect for topping with a scoopful of homemade chili. Don't overbake, and remember to butter the pan even if it's nonstick.

DELICIOUS!! I really liked the texture of the fresh corn and flavour of the scallions. This cornbread was moist, not too sweet - just perfect. I was very happy with the way this turned out and will make it again soon!

This is my favorite corn bread recipe. Fresh corn helps but frozen works. By using a jelly roll pan the pieces are perfect for a bread basket. Serve with honey butter or plain.
