Amazing! White pearls were used instead of red because I couldn't find them. Nonetheless, it was still savory! It reminded me of an ALMOST french onion soup. I just love onions, cheese and broth! lol. It's a pain to plop the onions out of the skin but it's fun as well! You'd have to make so many of these to feed a crowd!

Turned out great - very savory. The onions cooked down quite a bit so don't be intimidated by the 2.5lbs - you'll need that much to serve 6 or more people. The cooking time turned out longer than the recipe called for.

Delicious, easy side. Have also used frozen pearl onions (Trader Joe's), which are a big timesaver and taste delicious too (wish they were red pearl onions, but because they come pre- peeled I'm not complaining!).

Absolutely wonderful, great flavor. The onions carmelize in the the chicken broth. They have a wonderful rich texture. The recipe couldn't be easier to make. Blanching the onions and peeling the skins, is tricky. However, it is well worth the time.

I used both red and white onions for a color contrast -- the dish was very pretty -- and delicious! I agree with the previous reviewer, you must cook this uncovered in order for the liquids to evaporate and form a glaze.

I made these as a side dish for our Christmas Eve dinner. I have to say that I loved the photo and the idea of the recipe - but when I read the ingredients I wasn't sure it would be very good. I was wrong. It was the best thing I made. It was so good that when my oldest daughter had her first bite she counted all the individual onions that hadn't been served yet and gave everyone a quota of how many they could take for seconds. Slipping the peels off the onions is slightly time-consuming but other than that the recipe is not at all labor intensive. The only change I made to the recipe below was using 20oz. of onions - just because that's what two small bags added up to be. I didn't adjust the rest of the ingredients and so mine were even more caramelized and delicious than the photos

I made this with shallots and I got thumbs up all around. In fact I made a lovely meal with ginger shrimp, lemon rice and roasted beets and everyone raved about the shallots!

Made it for Thanksgiving and a huge hit. The onions aren't too difficult to peel and the rest is easy. The hardest part was finding the red pearl onions.

Great dish! I enlisted the help of my boyfriend to peel all of those little onions. I was serving vegetarians, so I substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth, and it turned out well. It looked pretty in a porcelain dish and had a nice sweet flavor.

Very tasty! The recipe says to cook them covered when it should be *uncovered*, so beware that when you make these. Otherwise you won't have a glaze.

We had this Christmas day - prepared the day ahead and reheated. The onions were a pain to peal but the taste is great!
