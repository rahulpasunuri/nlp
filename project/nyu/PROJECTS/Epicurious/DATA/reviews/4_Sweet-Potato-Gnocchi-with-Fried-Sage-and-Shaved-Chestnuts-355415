Due to the fact that this recipe yielded sweet potato gnocchi that were just as delicious as those from other recipes, but not more delicious, I didn't feel it rated an "exceptional" 4 forks rating. However, that does not diminish the deliciousness of these sweeties. They are a little time consuming, as are all gnocchi, but they're very easy to make.

It was easy to make. (I am always nervous about making gnocchi.) Make sure to use the right potatoes. I loved the crispy sage. I didn't cook all of the gnocchi so it went on a flat pan in the freezer until frozen then into a baggie for later.

I was nervous making gnocchi for the first time, convinced that they would be hard little lumps. This recipe was time consuming, but not difficult and the end product was worth every minute. They are light and airy, melt in your mouth delicious. My family of 5 cleaned their plates. Will be making these again & again...

This turned out very well for our stay-in NYE dinner. I used more like two and a half cups of flour and couldn't find chestnuts so roasted pine nuts instead. The gnocchi were a great texture and flavor while the sage complemented the sweet potato heartiness very well. Next time I'd like a creamier sauce so may try pureeing the roasted nuts and reducing with a white wine. Overall, delicious and definitely making again.

This was spectacular. We made it as a fist course but wished I had made more. It was great left over as well

Wow, what an amazing recipe. This was my first time making gnocchi, and I would rate it as easy. The fried sage leaves were perfect. I omitted the chestnuts and it still worked nicely. Add more butter for the sauce. I used this as a side dish for red wine braised short ribs. It was perfect.

My past with gnocchi is not a pretty one but this! Perfect little pillows of nyum. I didn't quite use all of the flour....I added by 1/2 cups till the dough was just barely sticky. I will def make these again. YUMMMM!

My boyfriend made this for me and it was amazing, though lots of work. We didn't have a potato ricer, so he just mashed the potatoes, and it was still perfect. I've had gnocchi in a butter sauce like this at restaurants before, and it's always far too heavy to have more than a couple bites, but this was the perfect amount of richness. Indulgent, but doable as a main course with some healthier side veggies.

Amazing. Used walnuts instead of chestnuts, and the flavors were amazing. The dough was a little difficult to work with, and had a gluey texture, but it was fine once cooked.

Definitely a bit of work to make, but DEFINITELY worthwhile!!! We made this exactly as written, and found it to be a fantastic variation on traditional gnocchi. Fresh sage leaves from the garden really made this one top-notch.

Served these as a first coure for Turkey Day, everyone loved them but me. They were no more difficult than any other gnocchi and in fact they cooked up very light. I found them too sweet and the butter-sage sauce was not enough of a savory counterpoint. But I was alone. Probably wont make them again

Nice combination of flavors. Negatives for me were too many greasy ingredients, and the chestnuts were too thin, so their wonderful taste barely registered against all that sage. I'd use more and in larger pieces next time. My gnocchi were mushy and too floury tasting. I added the flour in one bunch and next time would do it gradually stopping when the texture seems right.

Wonderful and not as hard as it looks. I served 1/2 and put the rest in the freezer. Look forward to seeing how this effects the delicate texture. Used walnuts instead of the chestnuts which were hard to find. Great flavor and nice crunch. This well definately find a place at this season's Thanksgiving table!

These are definitely worth the time and labor. They are delicious. I substituted 1/2 cup toasted and chopped hazelnuts for the chestnuts. I'm not about to pay $19 for a jar of chestnuts. It was just as flavorful with the hazelnuts, and I like the contrast in texture.

I made this last night and it turned out delicious. It was a fun, laborious, 2-person jobdefinitely not a weeknight kind of dinner but a weekend project. Two "corrections": Use a yam instead of a sweet potato to get the pretty orange color and intense flavor (I used a regular pale sweet potato.) Secondly don't pile the uncooked gnocchi on each other or they'll stick together and you'll have to re-roll and cut them. I did this, piling them on a plate before doing the thing with the fork and placing them on the baking pan. Next time I will cut the pasta, roll them into balls and then immediately roll with a fork and place on pan.

Yes, it takes a bit of time, but it is SO worth it!
