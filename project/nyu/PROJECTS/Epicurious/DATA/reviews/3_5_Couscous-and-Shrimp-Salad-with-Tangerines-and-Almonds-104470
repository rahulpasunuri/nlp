I thought this was a very nice recipe. I halved the main ingredients and made a third of the dressing, and left out the shrimp to make it vegetarian. It was simple to make, and has a nice, light, and unusual flavor combination

awesome! love the cumin-yogurt sauce. I've made several variations that are awesome too!

I make this for all my parties-it's usually the first thing to go. My husband doesn't like fruit in his food so when I make it for meals for the two of us I just leave out the tangerines and raisins. He usually devours the entire thing himself!

After reading the reviews I decided to make this recipe but I also manipulated it a small amount. Instead of using 6 cups of water, I used only 5. I also didn't use ALL of the dressing. I loved this recipe and so did my family, it was very very good. I will be making it again of course, on a regular basis.

I was really excited to find a recipe that would serve so many people- perfect for a large party. However, I thought that the final dish was just ok. My husband loved it, but hardly anyone at the party touched the salad, so we have tons of leftovers. I would make this again, but only after making some changes to the recipe. I didn't use all the dressing and I still felt that there was too much. I would use half, even less. I would also add more toasted almonds and more green onions to give the salad a much needed crunch. Perhaps this salad would be better with these changes, but I might look for a different recipe entirely.

Healthy, quick, , colorful, great the next day. This recipe halves and fourths well. For the small amount of effort you put into this, you get a lot out of it. Diced red pepper is a nice option if you are not going to use the yogurt sauce.

A number of things didn't work out... my couscous turned out really soggy and still had a lot of water remaining even after standing still for 15 minutes. There was too much dressing for the amount that was measured out. In total I had a huge bowl of dressing afterwards. I didn't particulary like the shrimp in this recipe... the other ingredients seem to bring out the fishy taste in the shrimp and failed to flavour them. In my opinion, good try but no cigar... I fished out the shrimp, saved the remaining dressing and threw out the rest without even eating any of it. I won't be making this one again despite all the great feedback.

This was so good and so easy! I used precooked IQF shrimp. The dressing was a bit heavy so next time I will try using the juice from the mandarin oranges for half of the oil.

a nice dish. i used extra lemon juice, scallions (it especially needed the color), toasted cumin seeds, mandarin oranges from a can and currants instead of raisins. i also used roasted whole almonds that had been very coarsely chopped, and the texture was very nice that way. i thought the dressing quantity was perfect.

I like this recipe. I like using dried cranberries, and yes the canned mandarin oranges but cashews instead of almonds!!

I was a bit afraid of this recipe when I was preparing my menu for Easter dinner. I was very pleasantly surprised and my guests loved it. I would say that there was too much dressing and I'm sure it didn't need that much. Next time I would use non fat yogurt and a bit less olive oil to cut some of the fat and calories.

I halfed the recipe and added some grated ginger to the sauce. I did not make it ahead. I used videlia onion instead of green onion and I had no raisins. To make it easy I used a package cous cous mix with red pepper. I added a small amount of sauce to the mixture but served most of sauce at side on a lettuce leaf.

I was so psyched about this recipe, but it was just a disaster. Bland and gummy, it did not improve the next day or the next. I was so disappointed.

I also took the advice of others and made this recipe a day in advance. I couldn't find any golden raisins (apparently, a rare commodity around here!) but it still worked very well. Since it's just two of us, I halved the ingredients and still had plenty left over. Tinker a bit with the seasonings (fennel, etc.) if you prefer your spices a bit more robust. I've also served this over feldsalat (lamb's lettuce) and spooned some leftover dressing over the entire dish which made for a very nice summer dinner. Definitely a favorite!

Thanks to the other reviewers who said this dish tasted better the next day. I made the dressing the night before and tinkered with it (more cumin, salt, lemon juice, pepper). I tossed it with the ingredients a few hours before taking it to a party, where it received many compliments. I also tinkered with the ingredients - using canned mandarin oranges instead of tangerines, minced sundried tomatoes instead of raisins, and slivered almonds instead of sliced (good added texture). I also added a bunch of chopped parsley. Next time, I think I'll use regular orange sections instead of mandarin. Can't wait to have the leftovers today. Make this one -- it's really delicious and you feel like you're eating something good for you!

I tasted this dish at a dinner party last week and requested the recipe because it was absolutely divine.Our host served it in a traditional Moroccan tagine,a spectacular presentation,I am so thrilled that I found the recipe and cannot wait to try it for my next dinner party.

This was fabulous. I wanted to make it as dinner for 2 so I cut ingredients by 1/3. I added a little fresh grated ginger to the dressing and some chopped cilantro and parsley to add more punch to the dish and served it on a bed of young greens. A light and wonderful dinner.

I made this dish for my annual open house and it was such a hit. I gave the recipe out to many friends and fans. I was looking for my recipe and I had lost it! Que lors what to do? Go to Epicurious.com thank you - you saved my party.

I have made this delicious salad many times since its publication in December 2000. I've made it for many parties and everyone always raves about it. All the ingredients are great together and tastes even better the next day as leftovers!

I brought this to a party last night and received complements all night. I used mandarin oranges and broken pecan pieces but otherwise followed the recipe. It was a tasty light salad which I will make again (you can quarter the recipe easily). I expect to fool around with ingredients and think artichoke hearts/green peas/red pepper/mandarin oranges/pecans/raisins would be delightful. Oh, I used vegetable broth for the couscous instead of water.

This was a great recipe and easy, too, if you buy precooked shrimp. I used canned mandarin oranges. It was a great flavor and beautiful, too! It definitely serves 24 people, too! I made the sauce and the cous cous the day before. There was plenty of flavor, too. I garnished the dish with fresh, edible flowers in contrasting colors.

This just didn't do it for me. I tried enhancing it with, variously, more raisins, lemon, cumin, even adding currants. It was just okay. Perhaps more crunch, with more nuts, would have helped somewhat, but I didn't want to make it a higher calorie dish.

I was going to give this recipe only 1 fork, but then I tried the leftovers. It is definitely better after sitting in the refrig. for a day or two. I thought there was too much dressing with the original recipe. Next time I will try using less couscous, reduce the amount of dressing, and possibly substitute orange juice for some of the oil (?) to give it a little more tangy flavor. It's a little bit bland.

This was a great party recipe. It is very pretty and festive looking. I increased the shrimp by 1/2 pound and decreased the oil by 1/2 cup and used mandarin oranges rather than tangerines. Very easy and many people liked it.

I made this recipe last year for my partner's birthday (part of a buffet of nibblies). It was a HUGE hit. I am making it again for our Christmas party - I think it is now a tradition. It seems like a lot of dressing, but the couscous soaks it up. I also use the Clementines or mandarin oranges or "Christmas Oranges" we used to call them.

This is a really great party recipe. It's not often you find one made for 24 people. I made a few changes based on other reviews - I used 3 large cans of mandarin oranges, I used about 3 pounds of shrimp instead of 2, and I used a 19 oz can of chick peas. I added an extra clove of garlic to the dressing and lots of salt and pepper. Next time, I'll cut down on the lemon juice. The dressing needed a lot of salt to get rid of the tartness of the yogurt/lemon combination. Overall, it was easy, beautiful, and delicious. You can't miss with this one!

I made this for a party- people raved and asked what it was. I cut the couscous down to 2 boxes and still had lots left after 18 people had really enjoyed it. The cumin and yogurt combo is delicious.

I love this! My husband made it for me for dinner, and I can't wait to have the (rather huge amount of) leftovers. He wasn't too impressed, but I think it's great. The mandarins were a good substitution. He thought it could use a little less oil, and maybe he's right, but I wouldn't alter it much. It's perfect the way it is.

This dish just didn't work for me. I made it exactly as written, except that I did substitute mandarins for the tangerines. I served it with three other salads at a salad luncheon, and almost everyone else thought it was the best of the four. To me, however, the flavors just didn't seem to meld or go together well. A disappointment, because I love all the ingredients individually.

what a fabulous recipe! I'm not a very adventuresoem cook, but even I felt quite safe to make my own additions. I added some curry powder, but I'm not sure it really made any impact. You could definitely make everything in advance (day before) and add the toasted almonds at the last minute. yum yum for summer!

I used canned mandarin oranges and this recipe was great. I skipped the shrimp because I used this recipe as a sidedish. It was very tasty. I think the golden raisins make the dish. I would definetly make this dish again. It would be great for a potluck or buffet dinner. Hello to the cook from Temple. We are neighbors!

Everyone loved this salad. It was a bit of a pain to seed all those tangerines, so I might try seedless mandarins next time. Has anyone tried canned mandarins?

The flavor of this is fairly mild, so don't be afraid to use a little extra cumin, garlic & lemon in the sauce. Overall, a light & tasty recipe that I will definitely make again.

This is a great salad. Served as part of an open house buffet to great reviews. I used mandarins instead of tangerines as they are so readily availavble in December. Also, it makes a HUGE amount - 2 large serving bowls.
