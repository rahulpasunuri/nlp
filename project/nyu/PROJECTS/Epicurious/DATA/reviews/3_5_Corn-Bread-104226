Excellent, moist. Only thing I changed was added 1/4 honey and used a glass 13x9 pan. Crunchy edges and moist flavorful cornbread. Everyone loved it!

Mine came out moist & buttery but realize that the cornbread that I've been craving is the corn muffin kind. I need a recipe with sugar. Also, the buttermilk sour taste was a bit too strong for my liking.

use only UNSALTED butter. add 1 can creamed corn, 2/3 cup sugar. Bake in buttered 13 x 9 pan at 375 for 50 minutes.

Excellent, I made 1/2 of the recipe and added 1/2 can creamed corn and 1 1/2 sticks of butter. It was very moist.

Super easy to make, but definitely needs salted butter or more salt in general. It was bland and could have been great. Too bad...

This was really great. We made it to accompany posole: yum! Because we are in a cooking club in which we trade meals for two, we divided the batter into mini tins with a drizzle of melted butter, then baked for 10ish minutes (i.e., no searing skillet). It was just right: a little crispy on the top edges, flavorful throughout. We used a tad less flour based on the 'dry' comments..perfect. We can now freeze our minni tins for nightly meals. yum.

I cut the recipe in half, use 1 stick of butter instead of 1 and a half, and use 2% milk plus a tbsp of lemon juice for the buttermilk. Keep it in the oven for 15 minutes. I've made it several times and it has always come out moist and delicious!

I have done a lot of variations on this basic recipe and found that heating the skillets or a 9x12 glass corningware dish with a enough oil in the bottom to cover the pan works better. No splattering, but when you put in the batter it gives a nice fried crust to the bottom of the cornbread, and helps with the moisture problem.

WARNING - IF YOU HEAT THE SKILLET TO 450 THEN ADD THE MELTED BUTTER - it will splatter all over your kitchen and burn you and whoever is standing there. It is a nice idea, but didn't work for me.

I added 1/2 can of creamed corn, and used half finer ground cornmeal and half course ground - those changes along with the salty crust from the butter made this the best cornbread I've ever had! Some might prefer a touch of sweetness, but this was perfect for me.

I am not a cook. I wanted a cornbread recipe that I could build on and this one is it. Someone suggested using cream corn, and that really helps because this receipe is a little dry....but that could be just me. I am not a cook, you see. :o)

This wasn't terrible, but I'll be looking for another cornbread recipe. It was very crumbly when I tried to cut it into slices, stuck kind of badly to the pan, and was super salty. And it didn't really taste very much like corn, just sort of floury with a hint somewhere of corn.

I cut the recipe in half, used yellow instead of white cornmeal, and it was so dry! Maybe I'll try one of the suggestions above - I need to have it perfect by Thanksgiving - YIKES!

Perfect cornbread. The real shmeel.

Cornbread was simple and wonderful. I used yellow cornmeal rather than white.

I made this with the bacon fat and a second time with olive oil. Go for the bacon fat! Much better.

I'm on a gluten-free diet, so I replaced the flour with brown rice flour and added one more egg (to 1/2 the recipe). It browns faster, but is moister. I also use bacon fat (1/4 cup) instead of butter, as indicated in other recipes.

Yum! Worked perfectly the first time, and it's some of the better corn bread this Northerner has eaten. Worked great as a half recipe and I also added 1 tbsp. honey to the wet mix but didn't taste it much, so maybe a bit more next time.

I like this recipe- the buttermilk made it moist. I like my cornbread sweet so I added a little brown sugar and honey and it turned out very well.

This is delicious!! It's very easy to make. I cut the recipe in half, and it worked perfectly. It's crusty on the outside and moist on the inside. Perfect. I also used yellow cornmeal because we didn't have white. It worked fine.
