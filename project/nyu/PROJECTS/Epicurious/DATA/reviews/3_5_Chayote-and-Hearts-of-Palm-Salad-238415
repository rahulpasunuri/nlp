I too loooove chayotes. To sgtwwilson, chayotes let loose a glueish liquid when they are peeled. So, the thing is you should peel them underneath an open tap. The running water will prevent your hands to get glued! :-)

This recipe is a nice refreshing side for a heartier main.. I felt it lacked spice/kick so I added a jalepeno and it was just perfect.

I was very excited to find a recipe with chayote. Chayote was introduced to me while I was living in Costa Rica and I fell in love with this squash-like vegetable the first time it was served. I tweaked the recipe a little bit-I abhor celery so I left it out and I didn't have any cilantro on hand. Since I'd never had chayote crunchy, I cooked it for about 15 minutes. I used salad cut hearts of palm, again because it was what I had on hand. It was still crunchy and the recipe was quite tasty. I'm not sure how having the salad cut hearts of palm could have affected the taste but I cut the pieces up a bit more and enjoyed it. Next time, I'll be sure to add the cilantro-it's one of my favorites but this didn't take long and I loved the taste. I did not find it too acidic at all.

This salad was not well balanced. I think the hearts of palm/parsley combination is not a good one. Furthermore this salad is not particularly attractive, the hearts of palm are delicate and kind of mush into everything else. I liked the chayote but no one else did, and like the other reviewers mentioned, wear gloves, they make your hands feel quite odd. The benefit to making this salad is that it is really easy and quick. I think I liked all of the ingredients separately but together they were a bit of a mess.

I was not too impressed with this salad. I feel that it lacks variety in the mouth as both the hearts of palm and the lim juice are acidic. Also not very pretty on the plate.

This turned out wonderfully! Very simple and very refreshing... It went really well with the bison/venison meatball sliders I made. I might wear gloves the next time I work with uncooked Chayote, it left my hands feeling like I had soaked them in bleach :)

This was a great summer salad. Very clean and fresh. I paired it with the grilled pork chops with Adobo spice rub and polenta. My hubby loved it.
