Super yum! This was easy and deeeeelicious! This will go in our regular rotation, for sure. Will also serve it for our meat-eating guests.

Very tasty. I didn't have fresh thyme, but I think it would have made a difference. The dry thyme was a little to "woodsie." I think this could easily serve 4, if you add side dishes or a salad.

A great recipe, I subtituted sourdough with rye bread the second time I made it, and it was recieved with rave reviews at a lunch party. Everyone make this dish!!
