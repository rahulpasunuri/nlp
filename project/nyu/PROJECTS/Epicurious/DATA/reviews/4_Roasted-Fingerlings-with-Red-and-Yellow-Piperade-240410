Easy, delicious. I liked it so much when I tasted it after roasting that I decided not to add the vinegar. I used a variety of olive oil that's naturally buttery, which gave this dish a very rich flavor. Also used baby white potatoes because the store was out of fingerlings. This isn't a world-class gourmet recipe, but I give it 4 forks because for what it is -- a fast, easy, flavorful side dish -- it's terrific.

I roast the peppers and onions separately from the potatoes, they're done long before the potatoes. I use whatever fresh herbs I have on hand. Sometimes I add some grainy mustard as well. Very good recipe.

I would like to try this again using the fresh herbs, since my version with dried herbs was good but nothing special. I followed previous reviewers' advice and roasted the peppers, onions and potatoes together from the start (and I really cheated and used frozen bell pepper strips that I let sit out about an hour to thaw a bit. So much cheaper than fresh.) I think it's a good side dish and easy to assemble, plus it makes a nice savory addition for a brunch potluck.

Delicious. Easy for a crowd as can make ahead of time and incredibly delicious. Love this served with the grilled flank steak in the rosemary/honey/soy sauce marinade.

I love this reciepe! I substitued apple cider vinegar for champagne. I think if you want crispy vegetables and potatoes you slice thiner, if you want less crispy you slice thicker, the key is to having everything chopped proportionally. I added sliced garlic to mine.

Great! Made recipe exactly.

Great! My poor little onions crisped up, so I would definitely recommend not slicing them thin as the recipe called for. Next time I make this, I'll probably add on some parmesan cheese on top for a little something extra.

Good but a question: Garlic is mentioned in the "at a glance" box and also in the "piperade" definition but doesn't appear in the recipe. Is it missing

Correction ! I cut the peppers larger than suggested.

I thought it was delicious and would make this for company. I used parchment paper and did not cut the peppers larger than recipe suggested. Used Robbins Family Farm Ascolano olive oil and Robbins Family Farm Balsamic Vinegar. FANTASTIC!

I liked this recipe, but I agree that the peppers should be sliced larger than the recipe calls for. I also think that there's no need to cook the peppers and onions for 10 minutes before the potatoes. If anything, I would start the potatoes first. The peppers and onions easily burn to a crisp. Overall, though, this recipe is yummy and easy.

Wonderful! I parboiled the potatoes first and roasted them with the peppers, I think the potatoes stay creamier that way, otherwise they dry out on me. I served with grilled apple turkey sausages. My kids loved it!

I have made this recipe twice and both times got rave reviews. However, I do have a couple of suggestions- the first time I made this, I did not use the champagne vinegar. The second time I made it, I followed the recipe to a "T". I must admit that I liked the non-champagne vinegar version better. Furthermore, my husband discovered that the potatoes were delish when dipped in the balsamic vinegar from his salad. So, if you choose to use the vinegar, I would recommend a high quality balsamic vinegar over the champagne vinegar. Nevertheless, you cannot go wrong with this dish. It is fabulous!

Yummy, yum, yum! Skipped the chives (out of season). The shallots were sufficient. Used dried thyme (smaller amount). The whole family enjoyed the dish.

Easy and perfect. Can't get potatoes any better.

My teenaged daughter made this for Thanksgiving dinner--she doubled the recipe (we had 15 people) and used the convection/microwave to cook in 1/3 batches. It was the most talked about part of the meal. Amazing! We had numerous requests for the recipe. It's a keeper!!!

This was very tasty, but since I cut amounts to 1/4 to serve for 2 people the onions and peppers burned to little crisps. Next time I'll cut them much thicker.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I had some problems with pan stickage, but I may have scrimped a little on the olive oil so the recipe's probably not to blame. I too skipped the vinegar, and I also skipped the thyme. There was plenty of flavor without them.

What a great side dish for Thanksgiving. Totally forgot to do the vinegar thing, but it didn't matter. Not one potato or pepper strip was left. It was superb and we'll make this again.

These potatoes were amazing! Our new favorite for an easy, tasty side dish. I will also chop the pepper and onions a little thicker next time. And I did halve the recipe since it was just for two of us. Worked out great. Also had to use red potatoes as suggested since I they didn't have fingerlings at our store, they tasted great too.

Fabulous side dish. The flavor worked so well together. I recommend that you slice the onions and peppers a little thicker becausee they 'shrivel' while roasting. Also, the roasting time is way too long. I think mine were done and brown in about 30 minutes.

I might halve the recipe; it was too much! Also, be sure to use plenty of salt and pepper or it can be bland. Loved the pepers and vinegar tasets.

We tried this recipe over the weekend, with steaks. It was easy, great recipe. I used Amy's organic fingerling potatoes. Highly recommend.
