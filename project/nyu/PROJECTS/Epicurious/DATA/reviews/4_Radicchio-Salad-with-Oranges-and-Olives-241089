Traditional Southern Italy recipe this salad is so refreshing and has the sweet salty mix. As for the orange simply peel it and take a knive and remove the white from the outer edge. Then slice into thin rounds. Break apart the rounds you are going to mix into bite size segments and place a few of the rounds whole on top for presentation. I also used two different kinds of olives and cut a half cup of fennel bulb.(Suggest you eliminate the salt. It doesn't add anything to this flavorful dish and the olives provide plenty of it.)

This is one of the best salads I've ever had. It turned out that Whole Foods had a pre-packaged "European salad mix" with mache, frisee, and radicchio, so I used that. As for the oranges, I realized it was pretty easy to remove the sections themselves from inside the membrane with some squeezing and pulling, but they came out more like chunks than sections, so I basically just put the orange chunks and the orange juice together in the dressing, and it was fine.

Good, but not the standout I expected from reading the other reviews. Very light and a good accompaniment to spicy dishes though.

Excellent counter to a heavy Mediterranean dinner. The combination of lettuce types provided different textures and the oranges, vinegar, onions and feta gave it great flavors.

I loved it! I omitted the onions, still great!

Stellar and so refreshing any time of year. Make it today.

I made this twice last week! (despite the fact that I just winged it with the orange instructions) Love the combo of orangs and kalamatas.

Even if you follow the basic outline of this salad it will be well received. There is a vagueness in the directions about the oranges so I made the dressing with orange juice and then used orange segments in the salad and did not stress about trying to figure out what they are talking about.
