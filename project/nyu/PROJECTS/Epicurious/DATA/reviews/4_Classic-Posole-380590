This was fantastic! I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it and took seconds! The pork was especially amazing - totally using that technique (and maybe the rub, too) with other meats/dishes. I used the suggested toppings, in addition to sour cream and avocado - I think the lime was essential to creating optimal flavor. Tip: I used Penzey's smoked paprika and Mexican Oregano - I'm certain that using high quality spices contributed to the great flavor!As for authenticity or lack thereof, who cares? The soup was delicious and recipes/ethic foods morph from the original all the time into (still) wonderful dishes (pizza anyone?).

I used this as a base, since i cant ever follow a recipe and it was awesome! I used some smoked salt and rotel tomatoes with chiles and lime. I also toasted cumin seeds and cooked the pork a little differently. We are having this with homemade tamales today.

For me, this was a good base recipe to work off. I took into consideration the criticisms of the experience posole eaters, when making the full recipe. My major change was using a dutch oven for the pork. I cut the pork into about 5 large chunks, then season and sear it in the dutch oven. Pouring off excess fat, then braising in the same dish, the pork cooked in about 1 1/2hrs. About 2-3hrs total time spent on the meat, from beginning to very end. Still super tender. I have added the pork portion of this recipe to my regular rotation. Yum!

I can certainly understand the labor saving device of using canned product here. But it is not the traditional posole. For that you must use dried or dried/frozen. The flavor and texture are totally different. I'm with another reviewer regarding the beans and cheese. I've lived in the Southwest for a long time and eaten a lot of bowls of posole without ever encountering cheese or beans. I also prefer using dark meat turkey in lieu of pork giving it a richer flavor. I also cut down on the broth as this is not supposed to be soupy.

This was very good but definitely needed a bit of doctoring up at the end. I added more cumin, a bunch of chili powder, and some chipotle powder. I also heeded the warning of some of the other reviewers and just added a little broth at a time because I wanted a thicker consistency. Very good!!!

As written, this really does make 8- 10 servings; I should have made a half recipe - we were eating it for days. I used half the amount of broth, and I'm glad I didn't use more. I will play with this recipe to better suit my family's tastes. We didn't care for so much hominy; we would use half the amount next time. And, for our tastes, the recipe could use hot sauce or salsa or chile peppers or cayenne or something to spice it up.

I made this tonight. It was bland. I used 5 cups of broth and it was WAY too soupy. I would not make this again.

This recipe is easy, delicious, and perfect for a chilly day. I made this recipe vegetarian by making my own seitan with the pork seasonings and a little liquid smoke. After having leftovers a few times, we used up the very last of the mixture on top of eggs scrambled with a bit of cheddar and scallions. The limes are important, so don't skip those. We enjoyed it with sour cream even more than the cheese.

I've now made this 3 times in 3 months and has become a new family favorite. I add a can each of pinto, great norther and garbonzo beans, which allows for more leftovers!

I followed the recipe exactly. It is awesome! It's especially good with shredded cheddar cheese and cilantro sprinkled on top.

This was amazing! I made it vegetarian w/o the meat, and using veg bullion cubes to make the broth. I even forgot to get the fresh tomatoes and lime at the store, but this recipe was unstoppable! I added some hot sauce and avocado to my bowl... double thumbs up.

I really enjoyed this, as did everyone else. I reduced the broth by about 1/3 to concentrate the flavor...good idea. 5 hours is about right on the roasting ofr 2 pounds. I did not have any smoked paprika in hand at 3a.m. when I started this, but look forward to the added flavor that will surely provide.

This was very easy and delicious. I cut the canned tomatoes, pinto beans and hominey in half to reduce the volume (just my husband and I). I have kept the pork separate and add to the soup mix as I am eating it since the pork will make great tacos or enchildadas and it will freeze better if necessary. The meat just melts in your mouth and has such great flavor. To the person who used pork tenderloin: go ahead and try the nice fatty shoulder/pork rib, the fat all melts off and you do not have to eat it but the meat has a totally different feel to it that is heavenly and flavorful. The lean pork loin will just not have the same texture.

I combined this recipe with the "Holiday Posole" recipe also on this site-per that recipe, the pork cooks much quicker. Skipped the beans in this recipe and added diced green chiles, a jalapeno and a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce. Had so much pan juices, I just skipped the chicken broth and added the juices and a bunch of water. Served w/ cabbage and radishes per "kitabl" and it totally rocked!

I saw this recipe and was inspired. The posole was everything I thought it was going to be. My husband really enjoyed it. I used pork tenderloin and reduced the oil the flavor was still there without the fat. Will make this again in a couple of months makes alot.

After shredding pork and skimming fat from the pan juices, do you return the shredded pork to the pan juices?

Beans? Cheese? I've had pozole all my life and I have never not once seen those two things any where near a pozole bowl. traditional garnishes are radishes and shredded cabbage.

I made this yesterday afternoon/evening and it was exactly what I hoped it would be - so much flavor, easy, and warming on a cold New England day. It reminded me of meals I've had in traditional Mexican homes more than what is typically passed off as Mexican food in restaurants. We all loved it! One guest said "You are young, but you throw it down like a granny," which was a compliment. We all laughed.

Very easy and good. I wrapped the meat mixture in foil inside a baking dish and cooked it for 2 1/2 hours as time was short, lifted it out of the juices, chopped it and added it to the broth for a few minutes, and it was still delicious. Makes quite a bit of soup. The kids said this one is a keeper.
