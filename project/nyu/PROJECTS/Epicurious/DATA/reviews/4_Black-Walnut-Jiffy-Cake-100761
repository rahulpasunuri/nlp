Very easy to make and a big hit. Crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. I made cupcakes out of the batter and used regular walnuts. Topped off the cupcakes with an icing of confectioners sugar, lemon juice, and a little vanilla extract. I might sprinkle some poppy seeds on top next time.

I lowered the temperature to 325 degrees and started in a cold oven. The cake was not dry. Also, I used the traditional method for mixing pound cakes, and added the flour last, with as little mixing as possible. Cake was moist and delicious.

I followed the advice of my fellow bakers and tested this cake baked in a 10 x 4 tube pan at 55 minutes and it was decidedly done. The combination of black walnuts and lemon extract is truly delicious. Both flavors hold up on their own, but also compliment each other very nicely. When the cake was cooling, I made a simple syrup with lemon extract to brush across the top, which provided an extra moist top with a hint of lemon and slight crunch once cooled. Wonderful!

I made this as a birthday cake for a friend who instantly rated it delicious (of course). Take heed of the suggestions from both the Cook from Rochester on 4/22/99, and Noren Nelson on 3/01/99 as they are both right on target. My cake was done at 55 minutes and, to me, was a trifle on the dry side. I can't imagine what would happen to the poor cake if it baked for the 75 minutes called for. I frosted mine with a lemon buttercream icing. I probably wouldn't make it again, not because it's not a very nice cake, but because there are so many delicious bundt-type cake recipes out there just begging to be tried.

We followed these odd directions to the letter & got a rich, fruity pound-cake like result. Very good!

I am in the midst of making this recipe and just realized it has no baking powder or baking soda and wanted to see what others had to say - I guess I'll find out myself!!!!

Due to the flavor of the black walnuts, this was a very tasty and easy cake. I toasted the black walnuts first. And I also baked the cake for 50 minutes and found that it tested done at that point. To gild the lily, I had some left over chocolate ganache which I spooned over the top.

This recipe highlights the unique flavor of black walnuts. I believe however, that the directions are incorrect. I think the 4th procedure (Add eggs...) should preceed the 3rd procedure (On low speed.....) The cake seems a bit dry but a damp paper towel over the top when placed in a plastic bag seemed to solve the problem.
