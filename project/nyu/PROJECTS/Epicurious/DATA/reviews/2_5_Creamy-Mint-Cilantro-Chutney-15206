The sauce is O.K., but not better than a bottled steak sauce or chutney. I thought it needed something else for flavor. The mint and the cilantro didn't combine beautifully. I won't bother trying to tweak the recipe, it's not worth the effort.

This is an unusual tasting sauce and used on the correct foods will compliment the dish and the meal. This is a strong tasting sauce and should not be used on meek entrees.

I have used this recipe many times for dinner parties after testing it on my husband - everyone enjoys it. I often make it to accompany chicked kebabs which I have prepared using the marinade for Moroccan Spiced Beef - very good combination. Ymmy and the chutney (more of a sauce really) is an attractive colour.
