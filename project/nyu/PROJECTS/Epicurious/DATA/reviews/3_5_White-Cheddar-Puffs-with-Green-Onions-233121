these were delicious. I did not add bacon (suggested many times in reviews) as I thought it would be too heavy with the cheese and butter. Instead I used a garlic press and added two cloves of garlic to the boiling water/butter mixture. Kids loved it!!

These are similar to gougères, though with a different flavor profile. This recipe is easily halved for smaller gatherings. I followed the advice of other reviewers and made the puffs small -- half the recipe yielded 27 puffs. They were tasty but a tad bland. I will add cayenne next time and perhaps sprinkle kosher salt on top before freezing or baking

Easy to make. Change 1/2 cup of the cheese to pepper jack. Add bacon bits (I made my own). Use a small ice cream scoop and make dough balls on a cookie sheet. Freeze it. Use when needed. The smaller you make these, the better they will be. Larger "scoops" do not cook as well as I learned the first time I made these. Second time around I came out with just over 4 dozen of these little guys and they were a huge hit.

These were awesome! Guests raved, it was the hit of our party. They were fairly easy too. Only issue is that there was no way I was going to get 48 out of this...I got 32 and they were small. Cooking time for me was roughly 25-27 minutes when they were cold. THe other thing I love about this receipe is that they can be made ahead and cooked later. I cooked half the day I made them and the other half the next day for another event...still just as good. A keeper recipe for sure...

I had to make an hors d'oeuvre for a party at the last minute and liked the sound of this recipe. I incorporated all the suggestions to improve it (bacon, extra cheese, cayenne). I even added some shallot as I didn't have enough green onion. The finished puffs are certainly airy, but the flavor is bland. I won't be adding this to my recipe file.

These are phenomenal! I got a little worried while adding the eggs, because the mixture seemed more like a batter than a sticky dough. Once I added the cheese and onions the dough did become the right consistency. I froze them over night, and popped them in the oven just as guests were arriving to rave reviews! This will be a new holiday tradition for my family.

I have made these many times and every time everyone wants more. I use smoked applewood cheddar and before I put them in the oven sprinkle them with a smoked salt or bacon salt.

This were very good. They turned out light and airy in the middle like a popover, yet crispy on the outside. You do need to use a very good quality cheddar, however. I used an 11 year cheddar and (as suggested in the other reviews) sprinkled in a little crumbled bacon.

I added a dash of curry for a little zip. I brought these to a New year's Eve party and they were a hit. So easy.

Rating: 2
I forgot to follow the suggestions of adding more cheese, or using a spicy cheese, or adding bacon. They were the consisitency of a cream puff but the flavor was not up to my expectation. Supposed to bring them to a Christmas Eve dinner. Will make something else. Would be embarrassed to bring these :( I might try them again with suggested additions especially bacon but not as recipe states.

These were delicious when hot out of the oven. I did add a little extra cheese and a pinch of cayenne to the mix. The sharp cheddar made all the difference. WIll definitely make again.

Guests were knocking each other over FOR these little cheese puffs. They were fantastic! Made some minor adjustments based on other reviews. Added 4 strips of bacon, cooked first, then in the Cuisinart to chop it. Also added an additional 1/2 cup of cheese. The extra cheese was a pepper jack. Used sharp cheddar (not white) because I bought it by mistake. VERY EASY to make. Use an ice cream scooper, put them on a sheet, freeze them, then bag them. Keeps frozen and can use when needed.

Wonderful and easy to make. I will add this recipe to my stand-by/go-to file. The puffs were the consistency of cream puffs, that sort of really airy, moist interior. My step-son, who is a VERY PICKY eater nearly devoured the whole batch. My only change was to use an English "Beer Cheese" cheddar I found at a grocery store tasting. It had added spices and a very sharp cheddar-y taste. The result was a very tasty puff with the cheese and onions playing off each other quite well.

I made these along with the Asparagus and Mushroom Tarts, on epicurious, as appetizers for a cooking group. Both were a bit hit and I made these exactly as the recipe read. I made the dough balls the night before and rested in the frig as suggested. They baked up prefectly in 30 mintues, don't use convection bake they will dry out (my test run proved this). I will certainly make again. They were delicious.

I've made this recipe a few times, and I think the key to keep them from being bland is to use pepper jack or habenero jack cheese along. I like to do half cheddar and half of the hotter cheese so that the hot isn't too hot.

These were great - got rave reviews. I added bacon and used 1/2C extra of xtra sharp cheddar. Will make these again, however wondering if there is a dip anyone can suggest to go along with these as an appetizer?

Either I seriously messed up when making this or this just isn't that good. It just tasted like bread with some cheese mixed in. I don't think I'll be making this again.

These were just okay. Nothing too exciting. I wouldn't make them again.

These are easy, delicious and elegant. Note that the size of 1 1/4 to 1 1/2" makes what I would call a canape-sized puff and yields much more than the recipe states. I got about four dozen big-bite-sized puffs. As they were for my bread basket for thanksgiving dinner, I wished I had upped the size a bit to make them seem like more of a dinner roll. Still delicious, and definitely a keeper of a recipe, particularly for cocktail parties.

These were called "puffs from heaven" at a recent party - guests were knocking each other over to get to the pan coming hot out of the oven. I agree that a super sharp cheddar is the way to go - we used an aged Irish cheddar and it was perfect. Getting ready to try these again for New Year's Day Brunch...may amp them up with a bit of cayenne or bacon as suggested.

I've made these a few times now. I've found that they are a good accompaniment to many kinds of meals, even great with brunch. My kids, who would normally scoff at something with scallions, love them.

excellent make ahead recipe that held up well to some significant changes. replaced the green onions with two bottles chopped pepper-stuffed olives, and froze the batter for a week before using. they were fantastic: light and delicious.

Made these for Thanksgiving dinner. We timed the oven wrong and so they came out about half an hour after everything else, and they were still so good that we didn't have any leftovers. They had a very nice cheesy taste, as we used a good sharp Vermont cheddar.

Rating: 4
An excellent and easy puff recipe. Use a high quality cheddar for best results. I found English Cheddar to be best. For an added twist, I also made this recipe with fresh made bacon bits. Those who tried both preferred the bacon addition.

Rating: 0
this is definitely a staple- a twist on the classic pate a choux- or cream puff batter ... try adding a bit of cayenne pepper for added flavor. I agree about chives being better- less watery when chopped.. Also, I am going to do these with some horseradish flavored cheddar spread- I love the cheese as a spread, so it's gotta be good in the puffs...

I thought these were pretty good - especially when cleaning the gravy off of the plate. Last year I made them for Thanksgiving and they even took a little joyride. I put them on top of my grandma's car in the garage because the fridge was jammed and my grandfather took off down the one-way road with them. Luckily they were well wrapped and no one was the wiser!

I thought these were good - the texture is very much like popovers. I followed another reviewer's idea and made it with habenero jack cheese instead of cheddar which added to the flavor. I also quartered the recipe so that it would be the right amount for two. Yum!

Surprised so many people were disappointed. I thought they were very tasty, as did my guests at Christmas (one of whom is a fine cook and food writer). I visited here again to get the recipe as an appetizer for guests this weekend. They are easy to make ahead. They are not very filling, and they go very quickly.

This recipe seemed like a simple tasty finger food for a family party. It was easy to make, however the puffs were very bland and the taste of baked egg yolk was overwhelming. It needed more salt and more flavor in general. I will not make this dish again.

I just didn't care for these. Mine seemed too eggy and the onion and cheese flavors didn't seem to work smoothly together. Not awful, just not worth making again.

Easy to make and a definite hit with my lunch guests. I took note of what a previous reviewer said about the puffs being bland and made sure to use strong cheddar, packed tightly into the cup measure.

I made a double batch -- half for Thanksgiving, half for a dinner party the next night. They were a huge hit, and practically inhaled by guests as soon as they came out of the oven. Each batch fills two baking sheets, so stagger the cooking to keep them coming. For one batch I used hot habanero pepper cheese. This was a bit too hot, but I liked the concept. Next time I would use jalapeno jack cheese instead. Also, I would try chives in place of green onion, for smaller pieces. For the next-day batch, I kept the dough chilled in a bowl in a mass, and formed and backed the puffs the next evening; this worked fine.

I thought these would be a lot better and I thought they were okay, but not great. Granted, I completely forgot to add the salt to the batter! So, I had to sprinkle it on. My Thanksgiving guests liked them a lot, but I'm going to try something else next time.

The best appetizer for Thanksgiving, but now I make it for most dinner parties too. Adults and children enjoyed this very much, couldn't make enough of them. Now I double the recipe as the minute I put them out they disappear. Wouldn't change a thing in the recipe. Perfect every time.

I made these for my sister's baby shower and they were a huge hit. I made them and froze them a few days ahead so all I had to do was drop them on the sheet and put them in the oven. I reduced the onions slightly. You MUST use extra-sharp cheddar or they will not be really "cheesy tasting".

WOW! I turned up the heat by adding some chopped jalapeno slices! These are a huge hit at parties!

Although the dough did not lend itself to being formed into little ovals (too sticky), they were fine just being put in free-form portions on the pan and they came out pretty, nicely textured (like a popover), and delicious.

Very good--I added a little bacon for flavor. It was nice to have them pre-made and then pop them in the oven. I had two left over and heated those briefly in the microwave--just as good! They would be yummy with soup or salad.

These were only ok...the bestthing about these is that they are super easy! I thought that they needed a little kick...maybe a touch of red pepper would do it. They are great left over and reheated in the oven.

Saw reserved salt for a sprinkle and just assumed it was after they were cooked. Without that, they are pretty bland, sort of like a popover texture. Will serve with champagne, but just don't love 'em.

I made these ahead of time and just before dinner, I popped them in the oven. When I served the salads, I put 4 on each plate and they were a wonderful change from rolls or bread. I put the extras in a dish and they were gone before the salads. Light and tasty.

Very good, very easy and a perfect match with sparkling wine before dinner. These really are best when they are warm and they don't stay warm long; then again they don't last long either! On the evenng we served them, everyone loved them.
