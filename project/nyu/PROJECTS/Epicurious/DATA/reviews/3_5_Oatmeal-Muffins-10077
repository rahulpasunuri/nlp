Just remade adding 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, zest of large deep colored orange, 1/2 cp each dried canberries and pecans. No sugar on top. 375 (no higher) for 20 min. Over the top

Terrific muffin! Subbed dried cranberries for the currents and added 1/2 cp chp pecans. Baked at 375 for 20 minutes, perfect. My oven temperature is on the money so I think 400 is way too hot. Interesting sidenote, I sprinkled raw sugar on the top of all but one before baking and while the raw sugar looked great, the naked one rose much higher

I made too many changes to this recipe to review it - however, I would like to ask why Epicurious has labelled this a "healthy" and kid-friendly recipe. This is a delicious recipe for a decadent treat, and shouldn't be confused for anything else.

These are great! I added fresh blueberries instead of currants and topped the muffins with a mix of the juice of a handful of blueberries and confectioners sugar. Really good, fairly healthy, pretty and my 4 year old loves them...he's on his second as I'm writing this.

Ok, I read a lot of the reviews and these muffins were SO GOOD with the changes I ended up making. I used all whole wheat flour, half butter and half applesauce, added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 1/2 cups chopped granny smith apples, and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. I also used baking cups and baked them at 325. The muffins didn't stick at all. Oh and I sprinkled some turbinado sugar on top. I think they're absolutely perfect this way.

Rating: 3
I wish I had read the reviews first as I would have cut down the butter a bit - no worries though - Hubby inhaled one, happily proclaiming it 'awesome'. He is not usually much of a fan of muffins. I did have to sub the buttermilk with soured 1% and I added a mashed banana that needed to go. Chocolate chips instead of currents this time, next time cranberries. Really versatile!

Rating: 3
Just a quick follow up -- I made these again today with several of the changes I mentioned. Soaked the oats the full hour (made a difference); I used half vegetable oil / half of the melted butter -- the crumb was MUCH better, and the muffin held together beautifully. I also used part blueberries and part currants, added a dash of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla. Splendiferous ;)

Really so simple and straight forward -- clearly a classic recipe as the description implies through its brief history. But, I swear, if one day I'm not baking with a better oven and whipping together recipes with better knowledge of how to do so at altitude, I'm giving up altogether. Well, not really, but sometimes the science of altitude baking isn't as straight forward as the science of sea level baking. My muffins didn't rise quite as I would have liked, and though their crumb and consistency were rather incredible (these are certainly not a very dense muffin), I do still wish they were more moist. Possible fixes: soak the oats the full hour next time (only did so about 40 minutes this go around); add a dollop (T. or so) of crème fraiche; opt to use part oil / part melted butter. I'm also going to test my oven to see if it was, indeed, at 400°F. When all is said and done, though, this recipe is an absolute must in any muffin-making repertoire. Mix, bake, repeat.

I used half the butter called for, 1/3 cup brown sugar and almost a cup of mostly thawed blueberries. They're delicious, soft and sweet. My husband said they're like pillows. I'll take that.

I made these without the currants and topped each muffin with 2 teaspoons of strawberry jam. They were delicious, but next time I'll halve the butter and substitute half apple sauce and add 1 tbsp of ground flaxseed. These are very rich muffins.

Update, these were awesome 2nd time around using quick oats, chocolate chips & a cap-full of vanilla extract. Definitely let the oats soak in the buttermilk like the recipe says! Yum! I'm at altitude too, I didn't change anything but cooked them for more like 18 minutes rather than 20. I could have maybe even taken them out a minute or two earlier.

I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted craisens (dried cranberries) for currants. They were delicious & moist. Great texture. I brought them on a road trip & they were still delicious after almost a week driving in the car! I think I'm going to make it again today using chocolate chips (because I ran out of dried fruit).

Follow recipe exactly to get a perfect texture and crumb. I've made this recipe over half dozen times since I discovered it a month ago. I used fresh ground wheat flour instead of all purpose and it turned out GREAT! We've tried out different mix-ins: raisins and frozen blueberries and raspberries. All good.

Great recipe. As usual, I use just 2/3 the sugar and sometimes add cinnamon, or maple syrup for flavor. Oh, and I always make these with fresh blueberries, instead of currants. Delish,

Made these today with 3 changes - 1 t. cinnamon, plumped the currants, and a dollop of strawberry jam in the center of the muffin. Only tasted them warm - delicious!

This is a really good muffin. Based on other reviewers' suggestions, I reduced the butter to 4 tbsp and cut the brown sugar in half. It was still pretty sweet, but reducing the butter may be why the muffin was a bit crumbly. The buttermilk soak changed the oatmeal's texture for the better. I will make this muffin again and again.

I love this recipe and make them whenever I have guests in town. A few tips: Can substitute 1% milk for buttermilk and can soak for 15min. I used Wheat Flour (more healthy and can't taste the difference). Also added a little cinnamon and vanilla. Used half the butter recommended and was perfect. Also used blueberries (roll in flour so they don't explode prior to baking). Delicious! Will make again and again!

I follow this recipe as written with the exception of baking at ~350 F, any higher is too hot in my oven. I also add blueberries. It is possible to substitute half the butter with applesauce as well. Delicious and hearty muffins!

These muffins are so delicious! I added craisins and walnuts to half the batch and they were even more wonderful. They are moist and the slight texture and background of the oatmeal is nice. But beware for those who are watching their figure: They are high calorie. I did the math and they equal out to about 200 cal per muffin - without any added fruit or nuts.

i have made these twice. once i followed the recipe but added chocolate chips instead of currants and added 1 tsp vanilla. they turned out great. the next time i substituted 3/4 cup of the buttermilk with skim milk, replacing all of the butter with spiced chunky applesauce, and cutting the sugar in half. i added vanilla to both batches. the second batch was definitely healthier and the muffins were still quite good but stuck to the paper baking cups i used. next time i'll bake these directly into the muffin pan. i will definitely make these again.

Rating: 3
These are good. The two times I've made them, I just let the oats sit in the buttermilk while I put the other ingredients together with no adverse outcome. I wouldn't call them "healthy" being made with 2x the amount of butter as most muffins and with white flour.

Rating: 3
These were very good, but could use a little cinnamon or chocolate chips or orange zest for a flavor kick. I was about to make these on a very busy day, then saw the instructions to let the oats and buttermilk sit for an hour. Didn't have an hour, so I microwaved the oats, buttermilk and the stick of butter until the oats were soft, essentially oatmeal. I didn't even let it cool that long, stirred in the eggs then the rest of the ingredients and crossed my fingers. The texture was outstanding, they weren't too sweet, and as I said, just needed the tiniest flavor boost. Will definitely make again.

These muffins are delicious. I made them yesterday and after they were in the oven I realized I hadn't added the brown sugar...lol. But even with no sugar they were very good. I made them again today and they were even better! Normally I follow a recipe to a T the first time but I am trying to get more whole grains into my diet so I used 1/2 white & 1/2 whole wheat flour. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of cinnamon.

I loved this recipe. The muffins were a filling breakfast treat. I used yogurt thinned with a little bit of water instead of buttermilk and half white, half whole wheat flour. I also added cranberries instead and currants and almonds and pumpkin pie spice as well. I made extra large muffins so they took about 25 minutes to bake. Next time I would add extra cranberries. I will definitely make this recipe again- maybe even with dried cherries and chocolate chips!

This was healthy, but not a huge hit at the office. It took the full day before they were all gone and usually stuff does not last two hours.

I absolutely loved the outcome of these. Moist, healthy and delicious - what more can you ask of a muffin? I did make some alterations, though. Instead of butter milk, I used 1 cup of soy milk with a tbsp of vinegar. I used about 1/3 of a cup of brown sugar, and I used a 1/4 cup of butter and a 1/4 cup of apple sauce. I also used all whole wheat instead of white, and replaced the currants with dark chocolate chips. The next time I make these I'm going to use a little less sugar, replace the 1/4 cup of butter with a 1/4 cup of grape seed oil, and use 1/3 of a cup of chocolate chips, maybe less. I didn't rate the recipe because I made too many changes to the original recipe.

The recipe is good but the method did not yield the desired results. The muffins cooked too quickly. If I make them again, I will bake them at a lower temperature. They also stuck to my baking cups which has never happened before. I subsituted some butter with applesauce and used raisins instead of currants. I also used 2% milk since it's what I had

These muffins are delicious, if a little heavy. They really are yummy, buttery and filling, as a muffin should be. I've rested on the following modifications: 1. fat free yogurt instead of buttermilk 2. whole wheat flour instead of white 3. chocolate chips instead of currants 4. add 1 tsp vanilla, 1 Tbsp cinnamon At some point I'm going to attempt to replace much of the butter with pumpkin, which should be exciting!

This was a great recipe! I made a few small tweaks: substituted skim milk for buttermilk (because that's what I had) and substituted half the butter with applesauce.

The batter seemed really wet but the muffins are moist and delicious and I will be making them again!

Like others I use this recipe as a base for many of my own changes. I'm only reviewing this with my changes for others who may wish to do something similar... my twist is for a healthy breakfast muffin. I use lowfat buttermilk, sub some butter with applesauce, pumpkin or banana. I use all whole wheat flour & always add spices (usually cinnamon, nutmeg, sometimes ginger...). I always throw nuts & fruit in & the batter can hold a lot! I usually throw in apples, nuts, dried fruit & it's always worked fine. This is no gourmet muffin but for a healthy, quick breakfast it's great & we make it all the time.

We are snowed in today, and I decided to try this muffin recipe. The muffins are gone - they lasted all of 30 minutes. Like others, I made a few changes. With no buttermilk on hand, I used skim milk with a couple of tsps. vinegar. Also, I cut the amount of butter in half. I didn't have any applesauce or bananas to add in place of the butter, but they were moist and delish, just the same. Added a gala apple chopped into small chunks instead of currants, and used dark brown sugar instead of the light brown sugar. Like others, I added 1 tsp. of vanilla, and 1 tsp. of cinnamon. I also added a touch of cloves and ginger. I never butter a muffin tin, but always use cupcake baking cups, instead. (In my opinion, there's no need to add more fat to a muffin recipe.) These muffins are not as sweet as bakery muffins, and I prefer them that way. Lovely, moist, and tasty!! I will make these again...even when we're not snowed in!

Rating: 4
Easy, moist, delicious and not too sweet. Following other readers' comments, I added a teaspoon each of vanilla and cinnamon. I made the mistake of letting the oatmeal and buttermilk rest together a little too long, causing the oatmeal to soak up too much of the buttermilk, so I added an extra tablespoon or so of buttermilk to the batter.

Rating: 3
Glad I read the reviews first and really played on the flexibility of the recipe. Had buttermilk on hand; used quick oats; 1/4 cup raisins; 1/4 cup walnuts; 1/4 cup multi-grains (King Arthur); used half whole wheat flour and half white; 1 tsp vanilla; 1 tsp cinnamon; halved the amount of butter and used 1/4 cup applesauce. Baked in mini-muffin tin for 10 minutes at 400 (will turn down a bit next time). Yum!

Rating: 4
This is a great-tasting basic recipe that reacts well to variation. My take on the recipe was to double it. Then I substituted apple sauce for half of the butter, a combination of whole wheat flour, buckwheat flour and oat bran for the white all-purpose flour, added dried apple instead of currants, and threw in cinnamon and vanilla. The result was moist and delicious, and best of all, healthy! (Although you would never guess based on how good they taste :)

This is a nice recipe. Like other reviewers, I found that it required less baking time in my oven--about 16 minutes. I also made some substitutions--3 tablespoons of pureed apricot jam for 3 tablespoons of the butter (leaving 5 tablespoons of butter) and white chocolate chips instead of currants. I also reduced the amount of sugar to between 1/4 and 1/3 cup. On the advice of other reviewers, I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla. I'm really pleased with the results. Delicious muffins! A very adaptable recipe.

As others have written, this is a very versatile, delicious and forgiving recipe. Have tried the short-cut route of using minute oats for a quick soak of just a few minutes with success. Have also decreased butter to 6 tbsp without problems, and replaced half the all-purpose flour with whole wheat (anything to get that into my children). Have added all sort of stuff, from banana chunks to dates to chocolate chips. Maybe I just have a hot oven, but I find they bake up quickly in 16-17 minutes.

Rating: 3
This is an excellent and very forgiving base recipe. You must like oatmeal, however, as it is very predominant. I made a few mistakes putting these together (I forgot to add the butter before adding the flour mixture), and baked it in a 9x9 glass baking dish. After reading reviews, I decided to add vanilla, cinnamon, ginger and blueberries -- delicious. I think I will continue to "play" with this recipe. I would like to double the recipe and try baking it in a bundt pan.

Excellent! Didn't have an hour to soak oatmeal and didn't have buttermilk, so used quick-cook oats and 1 cup milk with 2 tsp distilled vinegar and let it sit while I got the dry ingredients together.

Quick and so flavorful - this recipe is a keeper. I made improvisations, incl baking in a 9x9 pan at 350 for about 25 mins. I used vanilla soy yogurt instead of buttermilk; added 1 peeled, diced apple, which I softened in the melting butter and 1 t. cinnamon; added an extra egg; skimped on the br sugar; added 1/2 c. chopped walnuts; added 2 T ground flax seed. The result is moist, flavorful and healthy...butter makes everything better! I'll make this again in the summer, to take sailing and enjoy for breakfast. Thanks for everyone else's comments - it's always great to see what's worked for others.

Great recipe! Tastes like an oatmeal raisin cookie, disguised as a muffin! It was a huge hit with everyone from my husband to my picky two year old. Definitely add the teaspoon each of cinnamon and vanilla other posters have mentioned. Also, check for doneness before the time listed - mine came out a bit dry when I baked them the full amount of time but were perfect the second time when I cut the time and pulled them out while there were still damp crumbs on the toothpick. Finally, the 12 muffin yield must be for small muffins. I found it made only 8 regular sized muffins so I'll double the recipe next time.

If there is a simpler muffin recipe around that delivers an equivalent product, I'd like to know what it is. I made 1 1/2 the recipe, and made the following minor changes: instead of using all light brown sugar, I also used some maple sugar (about 1/4 c.). For the fruit, I used 1/2 c. dried blueberries, and let them soak with the buttermilk/oat mixture.

I made these last night with a few changes and didnt find them to be anything special. I added 1 tsp. cinnamon in the flour mixture, raisins, and 1/4 flax seed. Also put raw sugar and cinnamon on the tops before baking. Maybe its because i used 1/2 c. unbleached flour and a 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, but i just found the texture to be a little rough.

After reading all of these reviews, and baking these muffins two times with variations, I got this great idea. I teach a food preparation course at LSU (I wonder if this recipe came from some course taught here in 1940). I have 6 groups in each lab and I am going to have the students prepare the muffins with variations (the original, yogurt instead of buttermilk, 1/2 white 1/2 wheat, 1/2 olive oil 1/2 butter, replace fat with apple sauce, regular milk plus lemon juice or vinegar) I will report back.

These came out great! Here are some modifications I made to try and make it a bit more healthful: instead of a stick of butter, I used 2 tablespoons butter and about 2 tablespoons veg oil (still came out moist and tasty); replaced about 1/4 cup of flour with oat bran and flax meal; added some vanilla extract and frozen blueberries. I will definitely use this recipe again.

They turned out very moist and I think will make a great snack for toddlers and their mommies alike. Definitely a do-over.

One warning: This doesn't make muffins as sweet as the store-bought ones (which in my opinion, is a good thing). I normally double the recipe and, as I rarely have buttermilk on hand, have used plain or vanilla yogurt or a mixture with sour cream instead to soak the oats. I normally add more spices to suit my taste, a teaspoon or more of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, etc. and have included chopped nuts and craisins (my favorite) instead of currants. To keep your fruit moist, pour hot water or put them in a pyrex measuring cup with hot water in the microwave for a minute or two, let them steep for a few minutes, then drain and add them to the mixture. You will never have that dried out, burned tasting fruit in a muffin (or cookie - use the tip whenever using dried fruit like raisins) again. Yum!

Oh my! Scrumptious no-fail recipe! -- used raisins instead of currents and add 1/2 cup choppped/smashed nuts (pecans, walnuts or toasted skinned hazelnuts all work fine) AND finely ground 1/2 tablespoon of good Ceylon cinnamon which I sift in with the flour etc. I love this recipe. I should try this with candied ginger chopped up instead of raisins and pistachios instead of the other nuts with cardamom instead of the cinnamon. And may be throw in a splash of rose water. The muffin's the limit.

I just made these awesome muffins this morning. They won't last 'til noon -- they're THAT good. I followed the suggestion of a previous reviewer and added 2T maple syrup, 1t cinnamon and 1/2t cardamom as well as substituting a 6 oz packet of SunMaid Baking Raisins. They were perfectly done @ 20 minutes. Delicious! Will definitely make again and again.

These are excellent muffins. I had some dried cranberries that I wanted to use up, so I added those instead of the currents. I also added some chopped pecans and sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar before baking. The resulting muffin was remarkably addicting. This recipe with or without the substitutions is a keeper

I substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and dried cranberries instead of the currants. I thought about grinding pecans and adding them but didn't have the time. They are yummy with what seems like the perfect miosture content.

I loved these muffins. I was looking for a simple, plain muffin, and this was perfect. They were also very moist. The only modification I made was to add 1/2 cup of pecans.

I love this recipe! I didn't have currants, so I added about 1/2 c. coconut for a little crunch, and plan to add berries next time. Simple, buttery, and bursting with oatmeal and buttermilk tenderness.

Rating: 4
Changes I made: instead of 1 cup of flour, I used 1/2 cup of white flour, 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup wheat germ, which gives a nice crunch. I substituted 1/4 cup melted butter and 3 Tablespoons of oil for the 1/2 cup of melted butter, and I used frozen blueberries instead of currants. My 20-month old daughter and I love these!

I would actually give this recipe 3 1/2 forks with the additions I made. Instead of the dried currants I added 1/2 cup dried cherries, 1/2 cup chopped almonds and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract. And, I put some turbinado sugar on top before sticking them in the oven. They turned out very very yummy. I will definitely make these again.

I wanted a typical old fashioned muffin and this was it. I only substituted Maple sugar for brown sugar because I was out of brown sugar. REally good. and my husband really liked them.

Actually I'd give this one 3 and 1/2 stars, with my additions. Used mild-flavoured olive oil instead of butter, peeled and mashed up a very ripe pear, added a small handful of chopped candied ginger and used dried cherries instead of currants. Delicious! Great the next day, warmed up for 15 seconds in the microwave.

This basic recipe is a good oat muffin which is great for breakfast. However, I embellished on it by adding 1/2 cup dried cherries, 1/2 cup pecan chips, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon, which resulted in a rating of 4 for me. I make them over and over again.

Rating: 3
Very good. Nice texture and flavor. Next time I will try a variation; maybe dried cranberries, maybe the apples/raisins one, the base recipe is open to possibilites. Just watch baking time- mine got a little too brown on the bottom in 20 min. in a dark muffin pan.

Rating: 3
Crunchy on the outside, moist and tender on the inside. What more could a B&B wish to serve their guests? We sprinkle the tops with turbinado sugar (most often available at health food stores) before baking. From time to time we add our finely chopped home made candied orange peel together with the currants, and sit back collecting the accolades from our guests.

Rating: 4
Great muffins. I made the following changes: I didn't have buttermilk, so I mixed regular milk with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice as a substitute. Raisins instead of currants, a bit of cardamom, cinnamon and two tablespoons of maple syrup and you've got some fantastic little muffins. My friends loved them - moist, flavorful and just the right density.

These were not sweet enough for my taste. However, I took them to my mothers house and everyone else loved them. Hence the three forks.

Rating: 3
Good stuff. Unlike all the lowfat reviewers, I kept all the fat intact. The texture and moisture were right on. I, too, think that the buttermilk is key. (In fact, that is partially why I chose this recipe, and also the butter which adds more flavor than oil does as is called for in many muffin recipes). Next time I will keep the basic recipe as is and add a few things to enhance the flavor: zest of one lemon or orange, one tsp. vanilla, a little cinnamon and nutmeg, and a bit of turbinado sugar on top before baking. I also soaked the buttermilk and oats in the fridge overnight to save time in the morning. Great shortcut. Try them, a dee-lish oatmeal muffin recipe. I would give them four stars except it is a muffin recipe, not brownies or chili or the like!

Yummy. Frankly I can't tell you much about how this recipe turns out, because I changed so many things. I was blind and didn't see the bag of all-purpose flour on the counter so I used rice flour, and they turned out so crumbly you had to eat it with a fork! But something that worked out *really* well: didn't even have raisins or anything to replace the currants, so I chopped up an apple, and added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg, and that turned out great. Also I used cream instead of buttermilk cause my family doesn't even keep regular milk around the house and I didn't want to use soy milk. Next time I'm gonna keep the apples but make sure to use the correct flour so they'll actually turn out as muffins and not crumb cake ^_^

These are delicious muffins, they have substance without being too heavy, and are pleasantly sweet but not overly so. I used blueberries instead of currants - lots of fresh or dried fruits could be substituted for the currants. This is one I will be making often.

These are delicious muffins! I used dried cranberries instead of currants and they were great, but I'll try other things in the future for something different. Easy to make. Will probably make some substitutions in the future to make them even more healthy.

I cannot eat butter so I substituted Trader Joe's margarine. I didn't realize it was NOT unsalted margarine and my muffins turned out a bit on the salty side. If you use salted margarine, make sure to reduce (by half?) or maybe eliminate the salt altogether.

I've made these muffins several times now and they have been consistently excellent. I tried a previous reviewer's recommendations for "healthier" muffins with decent results but my preferred version balancing taste with nutrition is: sub soy milk + lemon juice for buttermilk; use w.w. pastry flour instead of white; reduce fat by one quarter but don't replace with mashed banana or applesauce (compromises the fine texture). Add 1 tsp vanilla and use 3/4 c wild blueberries instead of currants.

I have been making these muffins since the recipe came out in 1995. This is unusual for me since I have tons of cookbooks and cooking magazines and enjoy trying new recipes. Somehow, I keep coming back to this recipe. You can mix the buttermilk and oats and leave in the refigerator for a day or two- then when you're ready to make the muffins you won't have to wait an hour.

I really liked these muffins, and have made them twice. The first time, I made the muffins for my neighbors--exactly as written. (Except to sprinkle on some turbinado sugar on the tops before baking.) The second time, I modified the recipe to make it healthier. I blended the 1 c. oats in the blender a bit, and substituted soymilk with 1 TBS. lemon juice mixed in. (Instead of the buttermilk.) In place of the beaten egg, I used 2 TBS. of apple juice. The 1/2 c. melted butter was replaced with 1 very ripe mashed banana, and the 1 c. AP flour was replaced with whole wheat *PASTRY* flour. In addition to the above changes, I also left the currants out. Added vanilla, cinnamon, cloves, & allspice. Sprinkled turbinado sugar on the tops of the muffins the second time around as well. The turbinado sugar (aka: Sugar In The Raw) adds a wonderful crunch. Healthy, and not too sweet. Yumm. :o)

Moist, a bit oily, and i added 1 cup of craisin and grated lemon zest and a 1/2 tea sp of vanilla. Also used self raising flour, milk + 1 tbs of lemon juice instead of the buttermilk, Very hard to get butter milk in my student hoste. yummy!

12/27/01: Everyone absolutely loved these. They were not overly sweet and the texture was perfectly moist and light. The oatmeal gave them substance yet did not make them crumbly whatsoever. Next time, I will increase the amount of dried fruit. 9/2/02: This time, I added 1t cinnamon to the dry ingredients, replaced the currants with 1c lightly floured raisins, used 4 mini-loaf pans instead of 12 muffin cups (out of necessity), and sprinkled brown sugar on top before baking. I definitely like the cinnamon and raisins changes. The loaf muffins came out somewhat crumbly; don't know if that was caused by the pan shape/size or the loaf pan or the larger size of the dried fruit. Next time, I will try sprinkling cinnamon-sugar or raw sugar on top before baking.

Amazing! I make muffins frequently and am always looking for something "better" but they don't get any better than this! I have found the ultimate oatmeal muiffin recipe!! Very moist, even the next day, very tasty, and not overly "wholesome" tasting (important to husband!). I added 3/4 tsp of cinnamon and sprinkled tops with a large-crystal brown sugar (raw or turbinado) before baking - produced a wonderful and sweet crustiness to tops!!

An easy delicious recipe.I used golden raisins instead of currants.

Great, easy recipe - Few things: you have to use buttermilk, its crucial to the flavour/consistancy. I only had time to let B-milk and oats sit for 30 mins and that was just fine. I used dried cranberries, chopped apple and a little cinnamon (awesome and moist).

Rating: 4
Turned out great. I let the oats and buttermilk mixture stand overnight, and prepped most ingredients the night before, so it was an easy work morning recipe. I didn't have currants, so I folded in a mixture of chopped apple, raisins, and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. A keeper (think I should double it next time).

Great recipe, especially with the low-fat changes originally suggested by the Canadian cook. A bit dry the next morning, but after a quick trip to the microwave, very tasty.

These were delicious. I only made slight changes to the recipe - I added chopped dates instead of the raisins and I only used 5 tablespoons of melted unsalted butter instead of the whole stick. I didn't use anything to replace the remaining the butter. I also ended up soaking the oatmeal in the buttermilk overnight and I made the muffins the next morning, which didn't seem to cause a problem. I made these into jumbo muffins using my huge tin and it made five of them. Yummy. They were moist and tasted like an oatmeal cookie cake. The dates were excellent in these muffins. I'll have to try these with the raisins as well, but I can't imagine them tasting as good! Cinnamon chips or chocolate chips would also taste great! I will definitely make these often.

I love this muffin. It's moist & tasty, not too sweet either. Makes a great tea time snack or breakfast. I add raisins & diced, candied ginger. I make the candied ginger myself by boiling sliced ginger in water then adding sugar later. I save the syrup and dice the ginger slices to add to the muffins.

I made the following changes to successfully transform this recipe into a nonfat muffin. 1/2 cup butter = 1/3 cup applesauce, 1 cup buttermilk = 2/3 cup nonfat vanilla yogurt, 1 egg = 2 egg whites. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 2/3 cup raisins. It makes a very tasty moist muffin.

Delicious muffins - just added 1 tsp. cinnamon and used raisins instead of currants - they're tender and not too sweet.

I tried most of the suggestions made by the cook from Toronto (diet and health conscious) except: I eliminated the balsamic vinegar, reduced the cinnamon to 1/4 tsp. and reduced the brown sugar to 1/3 c. (because I used non-fat vanilla yogurt, which is also sweet) and Skim Plus milk. Great recipe you can obviously play around with depending on what you have on hand-and still end up with fabulous muffins.

FOR DIET AND HEALTH CONSCIOUS, REPLACE BUTTER WITH OLIVE OIL AND FOR MOISTURE ADD ONE RIPE BANANA OR 1 CUP OF SHREDDED APPLES. ADD 1 TSP CINNAMON. REPLACE BUTTERMILK WITH 3/4 CUP NON-FAT YOGURT,1/4 CUP SKIM MILK AND 1 TABLESPOON BALSAMIC VINEGAR. ALSO ADD 1/2 CUP DRIED CRANBERRIES AND 1/2 CUP CHOPPED PECANS. REALLY REALLY GOOD. SUBSTITUTE ALL WHITE FLOUR WITH 1/2 WHOLE WHEAT AND 1/2 UNBLEACHED.

What a treat! Muffins were perfect - light, moist and tender. Because I didn't have buttermilk I subbed with 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup 1% milk - next time I will plan ahead so I have buttermilk on hand. Also used raisins in place of currants and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. The baking time was right on and they came out of the pans easily. This is a winner for sure!!!

12/5/01; I finally made these as written, except used dates instead of currants. I find the flavor good, but with the buttermilk they're incredibly crumbly, and rather annoying to eat! I'll make them again, but go back to the yogurt that I used the first time. (2/27/01 I'm not rating, as I did alter the recipe, based on what was on hand. However....these are great (I just had several!). I used quick oats with yogurt, dark brown sugar and a combination of golden raisins and dried tart cherries. They still turned out wonderfully. I'll try them again with the buttermilk (we were out, as I'd made pancakes yesterday for breakfast).As suggested by previous reviewers, these would be very good with chopped dates. Maybe next time...)

As you can tell from all the previous reviews, these muffins still taste great no matter how they're modified. I made my batch with sour milk and chopped raisins instead of buttermilk and currants, which I didn't have on hand. They were delicious! I think this is the closest I've ever come to perfect muffins, and I've tried a lot of muffin recipes. Next week I will try them with the correct ingredients. I will also decrease the butter by half, because if I have one complaint it's that they are a little greasy.

I have devoured one of these muffins and I have to say they are just beautiful. I did make a few alterations. I added 1/4 cup custard Powder, 400 gram of tin apple and used an egg substitute made up of egg whites, skim milk powder and yellow food dye. I am really into watching my cholesterol these days, so the less egg the better. I did however used very light margarine, but next time I will add apple juice or puree to cut down the fat. The quantity filled the muffin pan beautifully. Love these ones.

I was surprised at how good these were. I confess that I omitted the currants and use milk chocolate chips instead, but they were great -- tasted like an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. Nice moist texture, but not heavy, keep well for several days. I'll definately be making them again.

These are wonderful muffins - moist and delicious(not at all dense or heavy). I used dates instead of currents for a softer texture and used dark brown sugar (no light brown sugar in the house) and the muffins were devoured - not even a crumb left! Highly recommended for a breakfast or brunch.

My family (including the kids) agreed that these muffins were great. I cut the amount of butter exactly in half to reduce the amount of fat per muffin from 7.6 grams to 3.8 grams. They were delicious nonetheless and had a great texture. I also added a touch more brown sugar (about 1/8 of a cup).
