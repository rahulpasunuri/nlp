This recipe has been a permanent member of my cooking repertoire since 1998. The salad is simple to make and everyone loves it. I make it at least once a week for my husband and for every summer dining event to which we are invited. Thank you for such a great recipe.

Made this exactly as the recipe states and it was amazing. It's very easy to make, but the prep work is tedious. I think it's worth it. Nice presentation as well.

This is a great salad that I have made multiple times. It is easy and you would usually have everything on hand at home to make this. Does not take long. Don't leave off the Kalamata olives since it is wonderful in this salad.

Great hybrid of a Greek and American chopped salad.

Very tasty!

Everyone loved this. Used less vinegar than called for, and Vidalia rather than red onion. I'm sure it would be good with chopped bell pepper, fresh herbs such as dill,parsley, oregano, basil or thyme. Great with grilled lamb.

They make this salad in Turkey only they use lemon juice instead of vinegar and they also add fresh dill. I fell in love with it there and now I make it constantly!

Great simple salad. I used crumbled goat cheese instead of feta and omitted the olives.

Excellent Greek Salad, this is how I will make mine from now on. My son loved it (without the olives and feta) and husband had 3 servings! I too cut back on the olive oil and added more vinegar. Definite keeper! Served with the honeyed lamb chops, great dinner!

i used pre-washed and chopped romaine which made this very quick. i also cut down on the olive oil.

For us, this salad needs a 2-1/2 rating (really like it, stop short of calling it delicious). It's very good and we'll make it again. Amazing how tasty these simple and few ingredients turn out. VERY generous portions. P.S. After discovering it is still good the next day, we give it three forks without qualification.

This salad is so versatile -- it can be matched will grilled fish in the summer or a heavier dish in the winter. And the prep time is minimal.

My favorite Greek Salad. I make it all the time. It goes really well with the honey grilled lamb chops (another favorite).

This was a delicious version of Greek salad that my whole family enjoyed. It does make alot, but that works with our 4 as I will always devour good veggies and salad over the rest of the meal.

Very good salad. However, it will feed closer to eight people, not four!

This is an easy refreshing salad that goes great with the lamb chops with red wine, garlic and honey glaze. I have made these dishes several times and had rave reviews from my family and friends.
