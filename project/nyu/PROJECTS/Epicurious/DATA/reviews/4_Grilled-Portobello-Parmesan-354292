Made these last night - delicious! Just as good for lunch the next day, too. I broiled instead of bbq'd, used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and used a grated Italian cheese mix. A nice change from our regular portobello burgers. This one is a keeper! (I reserve a "4" fork rating for the truly unbeatable recipes.)

The meateaters were fighting the vegetarians for the extras. Yes, they are that good. Made exactly as written however did not have great tomatoes so I skipped it. Fabulous.

Yuummmmy! This is a real keeper. I tossed some green onions I had handy in with the ricotta mixture, and will do that again. I didn't have fontina, so I used fresh mozzarella, which worked great. You could add all kinds of other things from the frig, too.

This was good! My only changes were to baste the caps of the mushrooms with the remaining marinade during the first grilling and to use a small amount of grated mozzerella instead of the Fontina (too much cheese!).

Loved it. This meal is very simple and depends on the freshest of flavors. Don't cut corners with dried herbs or Safeway tomatoes. You won't be let down.

What's not to love about big steaky mushrooms and cheese!

I was introduced to this recipe in my knitting group. Thanks Heidi! I do not have a grill, so I cooked the mushrooms gill side down in a skillet, using the top of the skillet to press the mushrooms. Then turned them over and let them cook a little more, using skillet to press the mushroom. Then turned them back over to prepare.... In stead of fresh basil and tomato slices, I quartered cherry tomatoes and mixed them with pesto adn dolloped this on each mushroom, followed it with the ricotta mix (which I used pesto instead of basil leaves), and a slice of fontina cheese - heated all of this in the same skillet using top in its proper form (!) to create heat to melt the cheese. OINK...

Super quick, super easy, beyond delicious! Made this in the broiler as other reviews suggested. Made extra dressing and heavily coated the mushrooms before baking them, it soaked in amazingly! Used fresh mozarella instead of fontina.

Easy as pie! Did these under the broiler. Broiled the mushrooms for 10 minutes. Placed tomatoes in caps and broiled another 6 minutes, then topped with the cheeses. Great for an appetizer too.

Sooo yummy. My husband is not a cheese person and loved these. A wonderful alternative to meat on the grill. Fresh mushrooms and good quality cheeses are key.

Excellent. I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, since that is what I had. Also, mozarella slices instead of fontina. I also served it with some warmed marinara over the top. We loved it. I am looking forward to making this again.

Forgot the balsamic, but still good! Used fresh mozz instead of Fontina, and skim milk ricotta.

This is excellent. I did not have ricotta so I used cottage cheese and all was SUPER. You could subsitute any cheese for your final layer and this would be excellent. One recipe you can persoanlize!

We loved this as a main dish with some salad. My daughter has recently announced that she's vegetarian so it's been a bit of a challenge to find dishes that she and the rest of us carnivores will eat...and voila! I found the thick slice of tomato to be a bit over powering and think maybe next time I'll reduce or eliminate the tomato and add bit of pesto.

This is a great recipe! Substituted mozarella for the fontina. Mixed in some grated parmesan and a bit of italian seasoning with the ricotta. Convection baked them (not quite outdoor grilling weather yet!) at 375F until the cheese was bubbly and starting to brown. Served with marinara sauce. Delicious!

I followed the suggestions of the reviewer from Wheaton, IL... mushrooms were great but too cheesy for me (did I really write that?)... I'd forgotten the fresh basil when I went to the market and am sure that was part of the problem. We'll try it again, perhaps combining some crabmeat with the cheese...yummmmm

My wife and I just made this tonight and I can't wait to have it again! We loved, loved, loved it. Thankfully we had made enough for 2 mushrooms each, and we still could have eaten another one each--not because we were hungry, but because they tasted sooo good. And the prep time was really fast, so I was happy to not spend a lot of time cooking and more time enjoying the food.

I cut the recipe down to 2 mushrooms and substituted low fat mozzerela for ricotta because I had it on hand. Husband loved! Next time I'll try with correct cheese! Worth making again and again.

These were great! I used a couple shortcuts that made them come together easier than expected. Used a Trader Joes cheese blend that included parmesan and fontina-mixed that in with the ricotta and used as the topping. Also just flipped mushrooms on the grill and filled instead of transfering to pan and back to grill. Fabulous and easy!

Certainly a good recipe in theory. I couldn't find the heirloom tomatoes so I used vine ripened ones. And I think that was the problem. While the fontina was delicious (especially with the smokiness of the grill) I found myself looking for more of a sweet, tomato-y punch. Perhaps next time I'll substitute reconstituted sun-dried tomatoes instead.

Not normally a fan of vegetarian dishes but this was wonderful. Used part skim ricotta to cut back in the fat content. Definitely making it again.

I enjoyed this though I agree with the reviewer about potentially skipping the fontina in the future - especially when the heirlooms are in season. One change that I will make is let the mushrooms marinate for a while (maybe a half hour or hour) before grilling so the mushrooms are a little more flavorful. I think this also has potential for an appetizer - smaller mushrooms, little slices of tomato, finger...

This is a delicious, easy make ahead meatless main dish. Also a good recipe for children to assemble. Local heirlooms have not yet made it to the market yet, so substituted more cost-effective plum tomatoes. Recommend very generous spoonfuls of the balsamic/oil/garlic combo. It adds a nice good punch of flavor after grilling. I agree with reviewer, one per person is not adequate. Might try a variation using a slice or two of proscuitto.... This recipe is a keeper.

Not enough flavor for me. I thought the cheese just overwhelmed the tomato. Next time I'll just top the tomato with a mixture of parmesean and bread crumbs and a mixture of herbs to give it a crunch.

This was a really good recipe. I ate them as leftovers and was suprised at how well they kept. I had an amusing mishap in making these whereby I broke the portobello in half. Three strategically placed toothpicks later, all was well, but be careful pulling the stems out!

yummy but tough on the wallet...between the heirloom tomatoes, fontina cheese and portabella's. actually, i would try it next time w/out the fontina - maybe just a little more parmesean on top of the ricotta instead. be sure to use a good thick slice of tomato - divine.

Delicious just as written. Kids, teens and adults all enjoyed this meal. Be warned that the portobellos can shrink somewhat during grilling. If you have hardy appetites, make sure you make enough. I think we could all have eaten 2.

This dish was extremely tasty. While classically a napoleon it comes out similar to an individual mushroom lasagna without the pasta. The Portobellos propensity to soak up flavors grabbed the smokey grilled taste and brought it to the table. Definitely a keeper.

Best Meatless Monday meal ever! My husband says this vegetarian recipe is the best I've made since we started the Meatless Monday tradition last year. Very easy and perfect for a dinner on a hot summer evening.

These were really good. I was scared that the tomatoes would go soft, but they didn't and everything tasted great. The balsamic vinegar gives the dish a nice kick. We ate this with polenta.
