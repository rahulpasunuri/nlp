First, full disclosure: I used Simply Potatoes hashbrowns, not freshly grated potatoes. I have a horrible grater and didn't want to spend two hours grating potatoes on a busy, holiday day! The recipe itself is great and other than the potato substitution, I prepared it as written except that I didn't wipe out the pan every time ... only when the oil was getting thin and smokey. And I would make these again, with the same shortcut, but with one change. I would dump the hashbrowns out and cut them up more finely. An essential part of latkes is that the potatoes be cut up very finely so that they almost mash together. That didn't happen with these potatoes, but if I chop them up next time, I think it'll work and save a ton of time. Purists, I know you'll hate that, but I'd rather spend the time visiting with family than grating potatoes!

Incredibly delicious. When we've made it we've used different kinds of cheese and each time it has been fantastic.

Very good and easy potato pancake recipe. I spiced up the spinach dip with some garlic powder and used less potato for 2 people but other than that - perfect as is.

These came out really great. I used red potatoes and they came out excellent. The creamed spinach came out pretty bland however. I added dill and onion powder and extra sour cream and it was very good. In fact we have extra spinach dip so we are making them again tonight.

Great recipe, easy to make. We substituted sweet potatoes (not yams) for the potatoes and people loved them.
