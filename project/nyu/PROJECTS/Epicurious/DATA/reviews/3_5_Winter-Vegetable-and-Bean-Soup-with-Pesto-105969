Love this soup... Some tips? For pesto use 1/4 cup+ Parmesan,leave out the diced tomato for the pesto and add some walnuts or pine nuts instead and 3-4 T of olive oil with a pinch of salt. The pesto is the highlight on this awesome soup! For the soup we left out the orzo to cut empty calories then added 10oz. of spinach along with pepper, an extra potato, carrot, fresh cracked pepper and the canned tomatoes to "beef" it up. This is a wonderful dinner!

The soup ended up great but I doctored it A LOT. My impression is that it would not have much flavor otherwise. I omitted the potato and used quinoa instead of orzo. I added about 1/3 c (at least) marsala cooking wine and allowed the veggies to soften in that. I also used 1.75 cans of cannellini beans (about 1/2-3/4 c mashed to thicken the soup), 2 large stalks of celery, garlic, and parmesan cheese to the soup. Also a splash of Worcestershire (but probably more salt alone could have sufficed). The pesto I made pretty much according to recipe except with only 1/4 c tomatoes. Turned out delicious, but not sure I could call it the same recipe.

This was a delicious soup, easily adaptable. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and added a yellow squash that was in the fridge. The pesto gave it an amazing flavor. I cooked the pasta and the green beans for less time, as I like veggies to have more of a crunch. Will definitely make again and experiment with other additions.

Delicious! I blended a third of the beans with some of the broth for a thicker base, and doubled the grains. Used 1/2 c quinoa and 1/2 c orzo. Also used a full teaspoon of crushed red pepper. And used both Chicken Broth and Vegetable broth.

We enjoyed this simple soup. My husband likes a thicker almost stew-like soup so I added another quarter cup orzo. Will try this again using quinoa.

I can't believe I have't made this soup before! Perfect for the first really cold night of winter. Used an immersion blender to make a potage and served with crusty bread. Can't wait for the leftovers!

This was very good - easy, quick and adapted well to the changes I made. I added two chopped tomatoes, celery and couscous instead of orzo. It was filling and inexpensive.

delicious and interesting, especially with the pesto. i used less stock than called for (to make it heartier) and used a mix of grains instead of the orzo (premixed trader joe's israeli couscous, quinoa, baby garbanzo beans etc). i also added some of the canned tomatoes directly to the soup, but not too many. it was a super easy meal to make and everyone, including my toddler, devoured it.

This was a great recipe that came together quickly. I just stirred all the pesto into the soup, which was great. Also, after making the pesto, I put the remainder of the can of tomatoes into the soup as well, which added nice flavor. I like thicker soup so I reduced stock to 6 cups. This was still a bit watery for me so I pureed the white beans with some of the soup and it thickened nicely. I'll be making this again, especially since you could modify the veggies and/or beans based on what's at hand.

Good soup and easy to make although I used some olive oil to saute the vegetables before adding broth. I didn't have basil but made the pesto with baby spinach I had. Was fine but will try with basil pesto to compare.

Awesome soup. Simple. Hearty. Healthy. The only thing I would do different is cook the orzo separately so I could add the perfect amount to my bowl. Plus, the orzo got kind of waterlogged by the time I ate it for leftovers. Delicious.

This soup was so flavourful and delicious. Instead of adding the crushed red pepper at the end, I cut up some dried red chilies while I was sauteing the veggies. When I make it again, I may experiment with adding other veggies as well.

Very easy and delicious recipe for a rainy day. I took other reviewers' advice and added the leftover tomatoes to the soup. Since the only diced tomatoes that I could find were fire roasted with green peppers, I omitted the crushed red peppers at the end. It still had a subtle kick to it.

Given the mixed reviews, I was uncertain about what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised. The soup without the pesto is just OK - but with the pesto it's delish! It's also very easy to make - now that I've made it once, it will come together quite easily. Very healthy and low fat too. It was great as leftovers the next night. I used 3 leeks because they were sold as a threesome (why waste a leek), added the leftover tomatoes as others had suggested also. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is.

This was just OK. If I were to make it again I would use chicken broth instead of vegetable. Also, be careful with how much pesto you put in your bowl. It is very overpowering.

This healthy soup is surprisingly flavorful with the addition of the pesto. I couldn't figure out how that would work but it adds such character and allows each person to alter the flavor according to their tastes.

This soup was great on a cold rainy day. Since I was out of cannellini beans, I substituted dried navy beans and field peas cooked in chicken broth (substituted 3 cups homemade chicken broth and water for the vegetable broth). Instead of the pesto in this recipe I used leftover homemade sundried tomato pesto. My family loved the soup, and my mother said the flavors of the soup were very French.

This recipe is very fast and easy. There are many layers of flavors to it. A very hardy winter soup. I also added sun dried tomato paste to it, and I used pinenuts in the pesto recipe. A great meal with some bread.

1-As suggested by 'cook', read all the reviews.Also entertaining on this site is 'Spam Sushi'. 2-I did make this and it's fine. If you have time make your own pesto, broth etc. add what you like. If not, add from a can or jar, it's soup (winter soup), it's OK, really, it's cold here too and I have to make this kind of soup frequently. 3-Submit your ideas and be nice about it, maybe follow 'Austin' advice.

I've been making this soup for two years now and love it! The first time my boyfriend saw it he was skeptical (too many vegetables, he thought) but even he thinks it's great. The pesto certainly adds a lot to the final product. I have followed others' advice and add zucchini, in addition to the grean beans, the remaining tomoatoes, and mash 1/2 of the beans to add some texture. This soup can definitely be served as a weeknight meal by itself!

This was a great winter soup, I added some zucchini, and bought pesto. Used the pesto as more of a garnish on top, instead of part of the soup. The only other change I would make is to cook the orzo on the side next time, pasta gets too soggy in soup. A definite keeper. (Note:The soup itself does not need very much salt, especially if you add a lot of pesto.)

This dish was quite tasty. Like another reviewer, I also added zuccini, but along with the green beans( I like lots of veggies in my soup). Added whole can of diced tomatoes with juice. Pesto was yummy. On the second day, I threw in some scallops and shrimp. Absolutely delicious! I threw in some green olives before eating. Will make this again.

I loved this soup! I also thought the soup base was bland and was worried how the outcome would be, but once you add the pesto it really makes a difference. If you think about it the soup really isn't finished without the pesto so don't rate the soup on just the base alone.

I thought this was great, even with the midwinter price of fresh basil. The rest of the ingredients are inexpensive, it's easy to make and conducive to tinkering if you are so inclined. A couple of people thought it was bland. If this soup is bland, you're not done seasoning it!

By itself, this soup was very good. With the pesto, it is outstanding! And easy, and cheap, and in my opinion pretty good for you. I did puree about a third of the can of cannellini to give the soup some body, also did what other reviewers suggested and put in the remainder of the canned tomatoes. Other than a pinch of herbs & a splash of red wine, that was it. Yummmmmmmm ...

I think this soup is good. I used 3 leeks not two since they were sold by 3 at the grocer and what was I going to do with the extra leek? I also used just olive oil not virgin b/c i didn't have any and didn't wanna go to the store. I think it tastes great! I love Pesto! Pesto is the key here! It's very flavorfull.

It would be nice to add little pieces of celery root (celeriac) and one onion to the base. It gives it more taste and you can elinminate the orzo. There is enough starch in the form of the potato and the beans.

I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of this soup. I think the key is to blend it with a hand blender in order to make it thicker. It went down well with my family and it is quick and easy. I did not add the tomato to the pesto and it was perfectly OK without it.

Yes, this is not the most scintillating of soups, but it still tastes good, is colorful, pretty, and healthy. I used purchased low-fat pesto and that helped cut down on some of the fat. A nice soup for those cold winter days when you want something warm and nourishing, but not flashy. Makes a great casual meal with a glass of red wine and a hearty bread.

Well, I have to agree with the San Francisco cook. This soup was kind of boring without the pesto, but with the pesto it was delicious. But that's because I love pesto! I found it similar to a Minestrone recipe in Joy of Cooking (latest edition). But there was much more fat/oil in this recipe. I don't think I'll make it again. The minestrone recipe was more delicious without all the unncessary fat and cholestrol. I added zucchini to this recipe which beefed it up a bit and I too saved most of the tomatoes for the soup itself.

With all the amazing bean and vegetable soups out there, this one seems very boring. The pesto is nice, but doesn't make up for the blandness of the base soup.

This was a great soup. I used 8 cups of water and 3 vegetable bouillon cubes. I also changed it a bit by adding more red pepper, spinach, and zucchini instead of green beans. Instead of Orzo, I used Stellette pasta (mini star-shaped pasta) for added fun. I have already made this twice and plan on making more of it in the future. A great soup to have on cold winter nights.

I found this quite tasty although I varied the ingredients based on what I had on hand--namely cous-cous instead of orzo. And I used chicken bouillion instead of vegetable broth. Thought the amount of leeks called for was out of proportion to the rest of the recipe. But over all...nice soup!

Sorry to be the singular dissenting voice, but I really didn't think this was that great! I made it exactly as written for a simple Christmas Eve supper, and the only saving element was the pesto! The soup itself is nothing special, and isn't worth repeating. The pesto is good, because it's pretty impossible to ruin pesto, and that flavor saved the soup. My ten year old son, however, thinks it was "phenomenal", so who knows? I'll go back to my stepmother's Italian family pesto recipe, and make a different soup (or some pasta) to enjoy it. (A note to all those moaning about basil...our local food co-op carries bulk fresh basil)

I made this with red instead of white beans and zuchini instead of green beans. Also, I used just half a cup of my own frozen pesto made from basil, parsely, oil, and pine nuts. This was pleny of pesto flavor. Two cups of basil sounds like it would be oerpowering but that is just a guess.

Rating: 3
This does seem like a basic provencal vegetable soup with pistou to me, but as a suggestion to those not interested in their local bank's "basil mortgage plan" this is my suggestion--most pesto is about the same--I make mine in july, when basil is everywhere, and I keep it in the fridge covered with a thin layer olive oil. It keeps all winter and is ready when you need it for soup, pasta, whatever.

"Chicago" didn't write this recipe. In fact, it is very traditional and very close to my grandmother's minestrone (she was from the region of Italy closest to France). I was very happy to find it and think it is great.

Finding that much basil in winter without going into debt is nearly impossible in most areas. I finish many dishes with a bit of lemon zest, and did with this. These vegetables are basically winter ones. I like the idea of zucchini and commend the cookbook writer for the work it took to do the book. Sorry some people are so insecure they have to bash others' efforts. "Be kind to one another" is still a good motto.

Like the last reviewer, we tried the recipe and found it to be very tasty. I modified it a little bit. Used prepared pesto (about 1/4 cup) instead of making my own and then threw in 1/2 cup tomatoes and the garlic with the other veggies. Also added about a cup of cooked kale that I had sitting in my refrig. Very quick, easy meal.

I have to concur with the person from San Francisco. To see a message like the one from the person in Chicago is really disturbing. Stop getting your aggressions out on innocent people. I don't log on to read this kind of venom but to get away from it. You need help.

YUMMY. I felt sorry for this poor recipe -- it got such negative comments that I felt I had to try it out of pity. I did fear it would be bland. But it's surprisingly tasty -- great even without the pesto -- hearty without being heavy, makes a ton, and could be varied in many ways. You could add ham or sausage, spinach, corn, etc. My husband loved it, and he has never seen pesto in his life, and hates anything vegetarian.

I expected to see a recipe with "winter vegetables" i.e. acorn squash, butternut squash, turnips, parsnips. The vegs. used are available all year round. Isn't "pesto" Italian and "pistou" French? The recipe sounds decent, as a springboard, but it would need a little "tweaking" to make it a 3-fork recipe, in my humble opinion. I've written a cookbook with 300 recipes, 100 of which I've created. It's just a modest little creation for family and friends but I have sold over 500 copies. I published it myself, so it's not on the best seller list, or anything like that. I just have a passion for cooking and everyone is always asking for a recipe so I thought I would write them down, for posterity.
