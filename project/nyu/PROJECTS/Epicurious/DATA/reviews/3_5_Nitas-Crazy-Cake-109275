I used to make this cake all the time when I was a kid and our family loved it. I think the taste improves if white vinegar is NOT used. Use balsamic, cider, or wine vinegar instead. Also, instead of adding water, add coffee or orange juice. You can make a vegan icing with a nut butter, non-dairy milk, and vegan chocolate chips.

Eggs are among things DH can't digest well, so eventually I will make this recipe as written, as well. Sweet potato variation of pumpkin variation was Christmas- dinner dessert, and it was good. Store had run out of canned pumpkin, so I bought 2 smallish sweet potatos and roasted them for an hour at 350F while bread baked the previous day. Peeled & pushed potato thru strainer to get rid of strings & undercooked bits (OK, I need a food mill; it is a small sieve & took awhile!). No spices; used melted butter (probably accounts for cake being a little denser than perfect), 1/2 T. red- wine vinegar & 1/2 T. balsamic (Newman's Own, not aged Acetico Balsamico; you run what you brung . . .) No chemical taste from soda/vinegar; not too sweet, altho I may try reducing sugar by 1-2 T. next time. A keeper.

My kids have allergies so I was looking for an easy cake without eggs. I have made this several ways now -- original and modified following others' suggestions (also compared with Wacky Chocolate Cake recipe on this site). For Pumpkin muffins: replace cocoa with 1 cup canned pumpkin, reduce water to 3/4 cup, add spices: 1/2 tsp each allspice, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg, and 1 tsp ginger. I've done applesauce instead of oil, and 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup sugar rather than all sugar. BUT, my friends make a Duh Chocolate Cake that is almost this recipe without the vinegar and it works great. So why add vinegar? DUH CHOCOLATE CAKE: Preheat oven to 350. Mix in big bowl: 3 cups flour, 2 cups sugar, 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 2 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt. Add in: 2 cups cold water, 1 cup vegetable oil, 1 Tbsp vanilla. Divide batter into three 9" greased and floured pans and sprinkle each pan with 1/2 cup chocolate chips (1 1/2 cups total). For cupcakes, just pour in about half the batter, sprinkle with chips, then top off batter. Bake 25 minutes or until tester comes out clean. Yum.

Excellent last-minute cake. I used good-quality dark chocolate cocoa and the end result had a satisfactorily chocolately taste, though not strong by any standards. The crumb did remind me a bit of a box cake mix (dry at the edges and a little crumbly), but then, I'd say this recipe is even faster than a box cake. Sure, there are better chocolate cakes, but none easier! It's especially nice to only have one pan to clean. Mine was so last-minute I frosted it with what I had on hand--Nutella--and it was delicious!

Wonderful cake for a snack. I use a small cup of cinnamon applesauce instead of oil. Lower cal, but just as rich and the cinnamon adds a nice flavor. You'll have to bake it longer, usually about 40 minutes - be sure to check with a toothpick.

I just made this cake exactly as the directions say to, and the cake was good! It was very moist and not overly sweet. It is a good snack, and if dressed up would make a great dessert for guest. I have to bring a dish to a potluck lunch next week, and there is a vegan in the group. This will be a good dessert for everyone.

This is my husband's favorite chocolate cake. I have made it several times and I love how easy and tasty this cake is. Nothing fancy, just a good everyday cocoa cake.

I love this cake but the secret to make it really special is to sprinkle about 2 TBLS cinnamon sugar on top before baking. The sugar changes into this crunchy thin sheet that is perfect with the moist cake. This is a really old recipe- my Mom told me they made it during the Depression.

I just tried this recipe as cupcakes and they were terrible. Not enough chocolate flavor and they left a strange greasy coating on the tongue.

Delicious and so easy! This is a cake my 3 year- old and I make together. I have to disagree with the self-proclaimed "cake lady" who felt anyone who attempted this cake was "crazy". Clearly something went askew when you made it. Perhaps you should try it again before you write it off.

I thought this cake was extraordinary (and I have a tough public). I've been looking for a non-dairy chocolate cake to eat after meat (we keep kosher) and this was exactly what I was looking for. It might be a very simple/ordinary cake but it is moist, great-tasting and great looking. It is also very easy handle once it's done.

This is such a good, everyday cake. My boys ask for it all the time, even on their birthdays--served only with powdered sugar. It's great with coffee in the morning! Soooo easy.

This is the easiest and at the same time one of the most delicious cakes I've ever made. I make it all the time and get rave reviews from family and friends. To the reviewers who found it bland I can say that it totally depends on the quality of cocoa. I always use the darkest cocoa available and it makes the cake so chocolatey - much better than many recipes that use melted chocolate, and without the fuss.

This is the first cake recipe I've found that doesn't have eggs (egg allergy in the family) so it's great. You don't need fancy ingredients. The kids love it. I put a ganache frosting on it and the adults just devour it.

this cake is also good if you use hershey's chocolate bars for the frosting. just place on top of the cake after removing from the oven and spread with a knife as they melt.

This cake is a staple at our house. Like the other reviewer, our child has a dairy allergy. We can make this cake quickly without our normal substitutions, and it makes her and her parents very happy! We make the cake exactly as stated and it's tasty everytime. As for the baker who doesn't like this recipe...I bake lots of things from scratch, too (because of the allergy), and none of my friends have ever, ever hesitated to clean their plate when Crazy Cake was served. Fancy, schmancy gourmet this may not be--but to me, sometimes down-home, quick and dirty, simple cooking is the best answer.

I found this recipe very easy to make and I added chocolate chips to the top, which was suggested by someone else on the board. I found this to be a great treat!

I think the reason this cake is called "Crazy Cake" is because anyone who tries to make it, is absolutely crazy. This is is worst cake ever! I have a reputation as "the cake lady." I make cakes every week for friends, co-workers, family. This cake smelled horrible and tasted even worse. I will never make it again and don't recommend that anyone attempt it either!

With a little adjustment, this is the very first piece of cake my two year old boy with multiple food allergies has ever been able to eat!! I've tried it two ways: 1. switched out the cocoa for pumpkin -- I used one cup of pumpkin and reduced the water to 3/4 cup. This was his first birthday cake and a big hit with all. (I also created a frosting of crisco, regular sugar ground with a food processor, and bananas.) 2. switched out the cocoa for two bananas -- and EVERYONE asks me for the recipe! -- a wonderful egg-free, milk-free, corn-free, soy-free cake! This will be a weekly bake. Thank you thank you thank you! cj

Very good for what it is - a quick snack cake from scratch, with simple ingredients so it's easy to make on impulse. And that's just fine with me. Great fun for my daughter to mix in the pan (beats Easy Bake any day!), and she can lick the utensils because there's no eggs! It's not super-chocolately, but it isn't overly sweet either, which is nice. I have a similar recipe from Betty Crocker that adds 1/2c. chocolate chips scattered on top before baking. That really improves it, but it's OK without. I did round up the fork rating because it's quite good for little time and effort. Can't have enough of those recipes!

Made it in a 8x8x2-in round nonstick pan. it was alright, but i'm not sure if i'd make it again. i kinda sensed the chemically thing too, although i used splenda instead of sugar, so that may have contributed to it. it was moist, which was nice, but the chocolate flavor was kind of muted. i made a sort of frosting with low-fat ricotta, powdered sugar, and cocoa, which definitely helped. this cake really needs an icing or ice cream (or maybe pour a liquid over it in a tres-leches-type fashion).

I hate to be a dissenter, and I loved the story that went with this recipe. But this was not a hit in my house. My kids ate a little of it warm, with lots of good vanilla ice cream, but wouldn't touch it after that. It struck us as chemical-y tasting, with the soda and vinegar. I use a couple other quick, easy chocolate cakes, which taste much better, in cookbooks by Alice Medrich and Norman van Aken.

In answer to the question below; I didn't have the type pan mentioned either. I used the correct size but as it wasn't "non-stick" I just buttered and floured the pan. It was fine. Good basic chocolate cake and very easy.

This is a very easy every-day cake, I LOVED the fact I didn't have to mess any bowl to prepare this cake that this cake is eggless. On an other note, this is the recipe of the chocolate batter in the black-bottom cupcake recipe.

Yum...besides being better than a mix, it just feels good to make something so good from scratch! My kids get home from school at 3:30 and I decided at 2:30 that I wanted to make them a snack -- this is what I made. It was so good warm, with a glass of cold milk. How awesome too that I didn't have to dirty ANY bowls to make this cake! One last comment: this was perfect for my kids but I don't think I'd serve it to company unless it was WAY dressed up with either icing or ice cream.

My ex-fiance's family used to celebrate every birthday w/ this "whaky" cake. I never got the "secret recipie" and this was one of his family traditions I was very sorry to no longer be a part of!! Thank you Nita for publishing this recipie so now I can make this a family tradition of my own! This cake is a perfect, classic, simple cake! A peanut butter frosting is a must for those of you who love the taste of chocolate and peanut butter!
