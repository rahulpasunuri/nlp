This marinade has quite simple ingredients and aside from marinating the chicken overnight, it comes together rather quickly. This marinade transforms the chicken into something so much greater than the sum of all the individual ingredients. Win! It was delicious and I can't wait to make it again.

I began with chicken tenders to save time, and 30-45 minutes was sufficient. They were delicious and moist, so flavorful and healthy! My family loved them!

Wow! SO good!!!! so healthy and delicious! I did not use the mint and decreased the oil to 2 TBLsp. I also just put all the ingredients into a ziploc (as opposed to brushing the chicken with lemon juice and oil while it grilled) It was absolutely fantastic! However it DOES need to marinate for longer than 30 minutes. I did 8 hours which was great. I tried it again with only 1 hour to marinate and it wasn't nearly as tasty. However this dish has been made 3 times in my house in the last week- that's how good it is!! I also made a tahini sauce to go with it. served with pita, a basic greek salad and rice pilaf. My favorite recipe so far. (and my 6 year old wolfs it down- thats a big plus too!)

Delicious, and amazingly easy! The only think I changed from the written recipe was to marinate the chicken for an entire day before grilling. It was so flavorful and moist... will definitely make this again. Rave reviews from my guests, and great as leftovers the next day.

I have made this several times to rave reviews. I have never made it kebab style in order to save time. I have just marinated the chicken breasts and cooked them whole. I recommend marinating them longer, maybe for half a day or more. I also made it once with bone in, with skin chicken breast and it turned out great. I put some of the marinade under the skin. I had a vegetarian guest as well so I made a double batch of the marinade and used half on extra firm tofu and grilled it too. Everyone loved it. Tofu is a bit trickier to grill, but if you make sure it has seared before trying to turn it, it works better. This is in my regular rotation now.

I have made many times since first trying it. The only thing I changed was I did not brush the kebabs with the lemon and olive oil. I did it the first time and thought it was a little too lemony. Will make it again and again.

This has become a BBQ staple! I marinate the chicken in all of the ingredients, including the lemon juice and oil - I also use lemon zest. Often, I'll prepare the marinade & chicken & freeze it in a ziploc bag - that way, it is there when I need it & marinades as it defrosts. Easy!

I agree with everyone -- yum! We christened our new barbecue with this recipe and I will definitely be making it again soon. I didn't have fresh mint on hand so I used basil on the skewers instead. It was a decent sub. Served with cold tzatziki from Trader Joe's and rice pilaf.

This was very easy to prepare and most of all tasty. I did not make the kababs. Instead, I marinated skinless and boneless chicken breast for a few hours and prepated them on my George Foreman grill.

This recipe is a winner! I made it for our annual cook out and it was a hit; we had nothing left. I made a few changes; I cut the chicken into strips and marinated it for about two hours; after that I inserted one strip of chicken per skewer and did not add the onions or the mint leaves that called for  it was delicious. This recipe is so versatile that I can make many different dishes with the same chicken. It is perfect!

I've read every single review for this recipe and can't figure out - how people handled the garlic. Best to crush whole cloves (as the recipe seems to suggest) or do you add chopped/minced garlic? This may explain why some people found the recipe too bland.

What a great, new flavor for chicken! I accidently marinated the pieces for 24 hours (long story), then grilled the skewers as directed and served alongside couscous and a simple zucchini carpaccio.

i put this chicken over a green salad, including chopped fresh mint with the greens instead of in the marinade. it was fantastic.

Rating: 4
Big flavor. A massive hit at the party we threw last night and a personal hit with me because they're so easy to make. I assembled the kebabs ahead of time and then we just threw on the grill when guests arrived. They cooked up so quickly that there was no need to bother with the lemon/oil basting. Just squeeze some lemon directly over them when they're finished. Oh, and keep the cubes of chicken small. The marinade is paste-like, and with smaller cubes, there is a fantastic flavor-to-meat ratio. The mint is the real kicker. People kept asking "Is this mint?!" It curls over the chicken when you grill it, so it ends up being this perfect mint-chicken-onion mouthful.

Rating: 4
You know how sometimes you make recipes and they end up not being very flavorful or you think "that wasn't worth the work." This is definitely _not_ one of those recipes. It's absolutely excellent. The garlic/spice mixture is paste-like so it really coats the chicken, and if you do small, one-inch cubes as the recipe recommends, then the flavor-to-meat ratio is really strong. Also, this is _ideal_ party food. You can assemble the kebabs ahead of time and they grill up likety-split. So quick in fact that I don't recommend bothering with the olive oil/lemon baste that the recipe calls for. Just squeeze some lemon over top of them when they're finished. We tripled the recipe for a party last night and people absolutely scarfed them down.

I've made these many times, exactly as written. I just served them again but with a side dish of homemade tzatziki sauce. It was better than ever! I'm lucky to have fresh garden mint.

We made this for friends and everyone liked it a lot. Very nice mix of flavors with garlic, mint, red onion and lemon. Excellent together with the Greek salad. I cooked the kebabs on a gas grill on medium heat for about 15 minutes, turning and basting them frequently. We also used extra garlic for more flavor. After marinating for 30 minutes we skewered the ingredients and let them sit in the fridge for several more hours. The combination is pretty healthy too.

We miss good Greek food and have found this to be a fabulous, easy marinade to simulate Greek flavors. We don't use the whole recipe, just the marinade.

It is perfect with the "cucumber and tomato(omit) tzatziki" recipe also on this site. Add grilled pita, tomato & onion and you have homemade gyro or souvlaki.

This was delicious and a hit. I made the following changes: I added the lemon juice, plus some, and a little more oil than called for to the marinade and didn't bother basting the kebabs during cooking. I also used double the amount called for of fresh mint and oregano in the marinade. I like the onions to be softer and caramelized, which wouldn't have happened given the short time the chicken cooks. So I microwaved them for a few minutes, to cook a little, before putting them on the skewers. I served this with the tzatziki from this site. Excellent.

Not bad, yet nothing to swoon over. I didn't particulary like the Greek salad accompanyment-- red pepper tends to overwhelm the other flavors, and I didn't think the dressing was assertive enough.

This recipe is delicious, simple, and can be made ahead for a party. We had a party for 60 this summer and it all went in minutes! The Greek salad is also fantastic with this making it all look very attractive.

I broiled this on a rainy day in the oven. We have an electric oven so I chose the Hi Broil setting and put the kebabs in a roasting pan about 4" from the heating element. I broiled them for 5 minutes, turned then over and then another 5 minutes. I have to say they were not quite as good as grilled, but almost! A great recipe!

I took the chance and cooked this for guests not having prepared it before. The recipe was incredibley simple and presented an unusual flavor combination that was a pleasant surprise to all. I served it with couscous and the Greek salad as suggested, and honeydew melon with coconut milk for dessert. Delicious!

This was a simple and delicious dish! I made it for a party and it was a great way to serve a lot of people. The salad that is reccomended with it is AMAZING on its own and as an accompaniment.

This was really good, i loved the mint. I cut back on the oil by a lot and didn't brush them with the lemon/oil mixture at all while i grilled them. I served them with the lemon risotto also found on this website.

This marinade is excellent. I have used it with both pork and chicken, and let the meat marinade overnight. For an accompanying sauce, I used tzatziki, which worked really well with the grilled kebabs. This dish has become a family favourite!!

Excellent! Easy to make and is well liked by both youngsters and grownups!

Very yummy and moist. If you keep it in the marinade overnight it will have a much stronger garlic flavor (also good but a VERY different dish).

This recipe has become a keeper and gets used often at our house. I follow the recipe pretty much as written and have been afraid to marinate the chicken longer than recommended for fear of "cooking" the meat with the lemon juice. This is sooo easy & good - enjoy!

I used some lemon juice in the marinade (a mistake that worked out well), added lemon rind, and used fresh oregano and mint for the marinade. The mint in the kebobs really worked out well. Rave reviews and requests for the recipe from guests. The salad was a nice accompaniment.

This was very easy to make and tasted great. The fresh mint was terrific and unusual on the grill. The greek salad that accompanies this was also a hit.

Rating: 3
I used fresh herbs - 3 times the dried amount- because they were at their peak in my garden. I marinated this overnight. Next time, if I marinate overnight, I will cut back a little on the garlic as it had quite the dose of garlic (I liked it that way, but a few guests were a little overwhelmed). The mint - oregano flavor was terrific.

Rating: 4
Great, great recipe. Definitely recommend marinating overnight as the marinade was much more detectable in the leftovers. Greek salad a great accompaniment but grilled veg (tomatoes, especially) also fabulous.

This dish is fabulous! I like to marinate the chicken overnight. That way all of the prep work is done and all I have to worry about is grilling the chicken the next day. We love this because it's so simple.

Rating: 4
This is exactly what I look for on this site, an overwhelming 4 forks up with very little "tweeking"! Very tastey. Did not have dried mint, so used fresh mint and oregano instead, doubling the amount required for the dried herbs. I marinated the chicken for 2 hours, and thought it could have gone even longer then that. The kabobs were moist and very good. Try this, bet you'll be pleased with the results.

Rating: 4
I loved, LOVED this recipe! I brought it to a Memorial Day BBQ and everyone loved it too! So simple, yet so tasty. I made a couple of adjustments, like adding kalamata olives to the skewers (which was delicious!), more mint leaves, and lemon juice to the marinade (I love Lemon juice and chicken together!). In fact, I loved this so much that I made more the next day and put them in the broiler, since I don't have a BBQ. Turned out great!

We must have said "wow" ten times :) We made this recipe along with the Greek salad. Served it with Toasted-Garlic Rice with Fresh Herbs & Limes also found on epicurious.com. Looking forward to making again soon....

This recipe was really tasty. It took a bit of preparing but the flavours really came out well in the chicken. I would possible try putting several mint leaves in between the chicken as the flavour had a tendency to get lost with the red onion. But deffinately a very tasty dish and one I would love to try again. I have taken it home to Scotland to try on the rest of my family!

This was a fantastic recipe!! The chicken had incredible flavor from the marinade and was so moist. Greek salad was delish, also. My 9-year old son claims he does not like chicken and he couldn't get enough of this. This will be a standard in the summer when we constantly grill. Do not change a thing in this recipe!

I had made this before, when I saw it in the magazine, and stumbled upon it again surfing the site for a recipe with mint. I added lemon jice to the marinade, and it was better than I remember. I agree with the other reviews-the chicken is delicious, the salad is a great side, and it's a beautiful summer-time meal!

Rating: 3
We really enjoyed this dish, although we doubled all the lemon. Next time, I will also add the zest of a lemon to the marinade. Once prepared, we found that dipping the chicken into a lemon vinagrette was quite pleasant. The dish went nicely with mushrooms with lemon cream (also found at this site).

Pretty tasty little kebabs. I took the liberty of adding mushrooms and green peppers to my skewers and it turned out pretty well. I used a George Foreman grill and they were moist and tasty. I would take the other reviewer's suggestion to marinate them a while longer - 30 mins (or 45 mins as I did) was not enough. I'd make these again.

Excellent chicken kebabs. Goes great with the Greek salad, cous cous and some tzatziki sauce!

I've been making this recipe since it first appeared in 2001. My family adores it, and it's easy. This is best made during summer with fresh summer produce. If you have leftovers, the chicken is great cold the next day stuffed into pita bread with some of the Greek salad.

The flavors are wonderful, and it's very easy to prepare!

I gave this dish four forks instead of three because of the ease of preparation. It was very quick and easy to make, but really packed a flavor punch. The Greek salad was a wonderful but I would definitely make it only when I could get garden fresh produce.

Rating: 3
Good, tasty low-cal recipe which I will certainly make again. Will marinate the chicken for several hours next time as 1 hour didn't seem to be enough. I made the yogurt dip recipe suggested by the cook who used to live in Greece and it was wonderful! The left overs make a good veggie dip. All in all, a recipe worth making!

Rating: 4
I made this for an end of summer barbecue at our house which we ended up having indoors because of the rain. Nothing about the recipe is complicated - it just takes some time to marinade the chicken and then put the kabobs together. Everyone raved. It really is a delicious recipe. I made it exactly as written except I added some fresh mint to the dried mint called for in the marinade and let the chicken marinade in the fridge for a couple of hours. Served with heirloom tomato salad, hummus, pita, and greek orzo salad. Don't skip the fresh mint if you can find it! It really adds that something special to this recipe, both in flavour and colour.

Alaska: That is not an authentic Greek cucumber sauce, known as "tzatziki". The real stuff (which is awesome on EVERYTHING) is: 1 carton yogurt (full fat, drained overnight in cheesecloth to make "yogurt cheese"), 1 cucumber, peeled, seeded (this is a must) and grated, garlic crushed (to taste but at least 2 cloves), 2-4 TBS olive oil, S/P, dill. Mix and let sit in the fridge for a couple of hours. Real Greek tzatziki doesn't contain tomato like the recipes on this site imply. Lived in Greece, this is it. Enjoy :)

I made this recipe last night, along with the Greek Salad. Other than reducing the red onions in the salad a bit, I followed the recipe exactly. I followed the suggestion by some other reviewer and served the kabobs with a side of cucumber dill sauce (on this website). Excellent. The fresh mint was really good. I thought it would fry up to nothing by the time the chicken was cooked. It does turn dark, but the flavor is wonderful. I made hummus (Barefoot Contessa's recipe) with pita bread as an appetizer and served the chicken with roasted pine nut couscous.

Rating: 3
Very, very easy, and very very good. For all food purists, stop here; for ordinary folks, I think the salad is better using bottled italian dressing instead of the oil and vinegar. The salad is forgiving: can add more of any of the vegetables.

Delisshhhhh. Only substitution was to reduce the amount of oil. Very, very repeateable given its easiness, healthiness, and yumminess factors. TRY IT!

I'm a city kid, don't have a grill so I made this in the broiler. Skip the skewers, just lay the chicken and onion out on the broiler pan and cook for about 15 minutes. Served with Tabbuleh salad, hummus and pita bread, it was great. The mint (used fresh) was such a nice flavor. I also reduced the oil. This feels healthy and tastes great.

This is light and different BBQ fare. I have already made it twice, (boyfriend loves it) and both times had people asking how to make them. I didn't make the salad, but served with tabouli, tzatziki and pita from the local deli. Yummy and really easy to make for company.

Both the salad and kebabs were *very* tasty. Served with hummus and pita, it was a filling spring-time meal. I disagree with adding more onions, however.

These were very good. We really enjoyed the flavors expecially the red onion, next time I will use more red onion. Also took longer to cook than 9 minutes, fire was probably not hot enough. Looking forward to the leftover kebob for lunch today, unless my husband gets to it first. Be sure to try the greek salad with the recipe. Great together.

I put all the oil, herbs, lemon juice and s&p together and marinaded the chicken about 5 hours (which I recommend), then skewered it with the onions and mint leaves and grilled over coals. Tasty, but nothing to scream about. Might be good for entertaining, because it can be largely done ahead, and should be well received by even the most finicky eaters. I served this with the bulgur wheat and garbanzo bean salad also on this site -- big mistake.
