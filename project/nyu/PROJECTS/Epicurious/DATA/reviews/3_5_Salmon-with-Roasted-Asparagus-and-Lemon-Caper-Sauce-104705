very easy dish to make. The lemon caper sauce tastes great, although the recipe could have called for a little more of it in general.

Super easy and excellent for everyday or dinner party. I prefer it with thin sliced green onion vs red onion. I make this quite often in the spring when my asparagus is in season.

Awesomely simple recipe, with delicious flavors. The sauce as written is a little flat, but it's a great starting point and you can tweak the flavors from there. I added more onion and capers, and a healthy grind of pepper.

Had to substitute green olives for capers and was still great.

This is fabulous! Quick, easy, best salmon all in one meal. LOVE LOVE LOVE this!!!! And perfect to serve for friends for dinner. Asparagus and salmon, all in one, on the plate. Beautiful! Add some nice bread, a good bottle of wine, and you have it. And you get to talk with you guest while it's cooking. A real no brainer!

I really just wanted to try the sauce and found it was incredibly tart and salty. I thinned it out with adding a sprinkle of Italian herb mix and extra olive oil. This helped it a great deal and it was the perfect sauce for a fish dish.

I was super excited to make this because I liked the combination of ingredients so much but I must say that it was so so. I agree with another reviewer that the sauce was too tart. I did like the idea of cooking the salmon over the vegetables though.

A keeper!! Easy, light. I put the sauce on the fish before baking, just made sense and glad I did. I would double sauce next time and no need to drizzle olive oil over asparagus either.

Delish! Increased sauce by 50%, parsley instead of thyme. I used frozen salmon and doubled the asparagus. Both salmon and asparagus were perfectly cooked. Served with baked potatoes. Both husband and toddler loved it.

Rating: 3
Using the asparagus as a grill for the salmon is brilliant. The end result is delicious. The asparagus remains moist and its contact with the fish gives its flavour a new dimension. Yum. I cooked the fish for 15 minutes and that was just right. I must say that I was not a big fan of the sauce/salsa. Too tarty for my palate. Too overpowering. I would definitely cook asparagus and fish that way again minus sauce.

Loved it. Easy, easy, easy and so good! Didn't make asparagus and doubled sauce. Marinated 30 minutes at room temp and used half of the marinade after the salmon was cooked.

The sauce and fish go hand in hand, delicious, I'll use this sauce many times in the future. I've made it to go with other fish and experimented trying out different herbs with different fish. The asparagus were tasty also but limp and soggy while I prefer mine crisp, but the fish took on a slight asparagus flavor, very good. I've since switched out vegetables under the fish with squash and zucchini and other veggies that stand up when cooked longer. All in all, a good base recipe that can be built on.

I tweaked this recipe considerably, and it turned out quite well. I omitted the capers (I hate them, and didn't want to spend the money on something I would probably never use again) and used sweet onions instead of red onions. I cooked the onion pieces with the asparagus and on top of the salmon, but left them out of the sauce (I also hate raw onion). I put lemon juice on the fish and asparagus prior to cooking. Someone later told me this can dry out the fish, something to investigate next time. I placed lemon slices on top of the fish as suggested by another member, and placed the fresh thyme on top as well (looks beautiful). I sprinkled garlic powder lightly over everything prior to placing in the oven. I served with garlic and olive oil couscous, which went amazingly.

I love this. It is delicious and really quick and easy. I left out the red onion(dislike) and skimped on the lemon zest(lazy). I served this with some garlic and chive mashed potatoes.

Rating: 4
Easy and tasty!!! This is an excellent dish to serve in warmer weather as the relish was refreshing with the salmon. The asparagus was a little overcooked but still tasted delicious! I would use a thinner piece of salmon next time to ensure the whole meal is cooked evenly. The piece I used was far too thick and took ages to cook thoroughly. I didn't use lemon peel also, but the relish turned out great. I actually grilled the salmon with thin slices of lemon laid out on top - added a little more zing to the fish.

I've been using the same marinade for years and was looking for something new to serve family and picky children. This is a keeper. The lemon-caper sauce enhances the flavor of both the fish and asparagus. Add rice, couscous, or mashed potatoes to pull a whole meal together.

I roasted the salmon over fennel and marinated it in some olive oil with lemon zest, parsley, S&P. In the sauce, I added the garlic as was suggested, along with sundried tomatoes, S&P, crushed red pepper, lemon zest, a pinch of sugar, parsley (didn't have thyme) and a couple of fennel fronds. Came out great!

Ok, maybe I am missing something, but this was just ok in our book. Used big salmon filets(with the skin on the bottom)and blanched asparagus on top.

Made this for dinner last night and both my husband and I really liked it. We eat salmon at least once a week so I am always intersted in new ideas. The topping for the salmon was the best----very fresh and clean tasting and really made the meal. Like others, I put half the sauce on the fish before cooking and then topped it with the remaing sauce before serving. Even thought it was just the two of us I made the full recipe for the sauce and thought that amount was perfect for two. So if I made this for more people I would increase the sauce accordingly. I would serve this to company and will also add it to my regular recipes for "just us". A definite keeper.

This was awesome; one of the best things I have ever eaten. We made this for valentines day along with the chocolate heart cake with chocolate cinnamon mousse (also from this site and also great). It was perfect because the flavors were crisp and fresh, and the dish was very easy to make. Nice when making a more complicated dessert. The whole family, including an 11 year old, loved it.

Wow! I was just cooking for myself, so I altered the recipe by roasting the asparagus for 10 mins by itself. I then added the salmon for 7 more mins. Fantastic!

I made a mistake while preparing this dish: I wasn't paying attention and added two cloves of chopped garlic to the sauce, then spooned the sauce over the salmon before putting it in the oven...delicious! In addition to a great meal, the whole house smelled like fresh thyme! My version took the full 20 minutes to bake and the asparagus was still crunchy.

Like many, I'd give this 3.5 forks. It is simple and delicious, but lacks the complexity I might save for a 4-forker. I served this tonight with a local favourite of mine and everyone (many are good cooks themselves) loved it. I followed the recipe exactly (except did 17 mins on fish as I hate overdone fish and like veg al dente). Then did crushed new potatoes with fresh mint - boil new potatoes til just soft, drain and add lots of fresh chopped mint, sea salt, fresh pepper and mild olive oil and gently crush with masher or big spoon. Do just before serving. Fresh mint really goes well with salmon and sauce. Absolutely yum.

Combined the sauce & salmon idea here with another Epicurious recipe Sauteed Red Snapper with Lemon Asparagus Puree. Check it out. The puree with the salmon was brilliant, esp. with the addition of capers plus I added lemon zest and some ver jus to give it bite, and also added a pat of butter at the end to give the puree a bit of richness. Served with red quinoa pilaf flavored with allspice and thyme. So you had rich salmon, tangy asparagus, and nutty fragrant pilaf. Add in a great Pinot and you are set.

Excellent for company. Great presentation. I disagree with those who would add the sauce before cooking. Doing so would overpower the flavor of the salmon and the asparagus. I've long roasted asparagus as an appetizer or side dish, and this recipe takes the roasted asparagus to a higher plane.

This was really good. I was a little worried about it being too lemony..it was just a tad sharp, but not too bad. Next time I'll reduce the lemon juice just a bit. The flavor of the sauce really complimented the richness of the salmon. Loved how quick and easy this was too! I'll be making again!

Served this for my parents, who are currently on a low carb kick. I prepared the fresh sauce in the morning and let it sit in the fridge until lunch time; thanks to the tips to increase the amount of sauce, I had just enough to go around (doubled it). Great, quick prep time and nice flavors.

I'v emade the recipe as listed here and enjoy it very much. However, for convenience matters, most of the time I now just make the sauce and serve it with different fish (cod, tuna, salmon, monkfish, halibut) that we pan-sear or otherwise prepare simply & quickly with some steamed veggies. This is also fantastic with grilled pork. Perfect for weeknight fast dinners.

This dish was even better as leftovers because the sauce actually penetrated the salmon through and through. I would recommend spooning the sauce ( double the recipe as others recommended) over the fish at least an hour earlier then serve plate it with some sauce at the end. Very easy and presentable...

Rating: 4
This was very delicious, as well as simple and FAST to make! The salmon was flavorful and melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the asparagus came out just the way we like it -- tender-crisp -- with the additional flavors of the sauce, which blended perfectly with the strong flavor of asparagus. Add some rice and it's a gourmet meal you can serve on any day of the week. I agree with others that you should double the sauce, as well as pour some over the salmon before baking. However, rather than pour it all over, I poured half over it, and saved the rest to pour over when plating it. This way the flavors get baked into the salmon and roasted into the asparagus, yet you still have enough left to add even more flavor upon serving. Be sure to use fresh-squeezed lemon juice and fresh (not dried) thyme -- believe me, it makes a huge difference. Enjoy!

Rating: 3
Good & very easy recipe. Roast the asparagus a little before putting the salmon on top, just b/c my husband will only eat them a little on the overcooked side. Put cayenne, s&p on the top of the salmon. Extra capers & lemon in the sauce. Serve with some kind of rice dish. Really tasty.

Rating: 3
I doubled the sauce recipe and poured it pver the fish before baking it. Then I saved the juice and poured it over before serving it. It blended the flavors of oil, lemon, and thyme together well. The only drawback is that there wasn't a lot of sauce left after baking. I think that triple or quadruple the sauce would have given the proper amount of sauce if used for basting.

Rating: 3
Not only was this recipe easy for me (a cooking novice) to follow, but the smell of the salmon and roasting asparagus nearly convinced my two vegetarian roommates to begin eating seafood again. The asparagus emerged from the oven tender and complimented the salmon well; the lemon-caper sauce was flavorful without being overpowering.

Rating: 3
Excellent. Very flavourful. Easy to prepare. I didn't have a problem with the asparagus. They were medium thickness and came up nice and tender but firm. I took the advise of others, and doubled the sauce - thank you for that tip! Also, used dill instead of thyme just because I've always prefered dill with fish! And I did cut back on the oil. Will be making this one again soon!

Rating: 3
Its a great recipe as is but I like it even more with some modifications. I followed the advice of "A Cook from Brooklyn, NY on 05/11/05" by getting thinner individual salmon filets to prevent over cooking of the asparagus (it worked well.) Then I used 1/2 of the sauce during the baking process. With the other 1/2 serving of the sauce I left out the oil and mixed in sour cream instead. When serving we used a dollop of the modified sauce on top and served with a side of seasoned wild rice. Yummy!

Rating: 3
This was so simple and easy. I cooked the fish with some of the sauce, poured the rest on after cooking. My only complaint is that the asparagus under the fish got a bit soggy. I'd use thicker stalks next time, or cook them next to the fish instead of under it. Enjoy!

Rating: 3
Talk about killing two birds with one stone! Both asparagus and salmon are great roasted, and cooking them together is very smart ... I used thick, fresh California asparagus that I peeled (snapping the thick ones leaves you with little more than the tips). Roasting brought out a delicious sweetness.

So good, and so easy. I more than doubled the sauce and used half while cooking, reserving the other half to spoon over the salmon when served. The asparagus was fantastic.

Sorry to be the lone dissenter, but I really did not enjoy this dish. Although the presentation was very nice, there was a bitter, sour and very unpleasant after-taste that detracted from the flavour of the salmon. Really don't know what it was: perhaps an overly sour lemon or capers that had been in the fridge too long? I have many excellent salmon recipes so doubt that I will make this one again. However, please don't let my comments prevent you from trying this recipe. With so many great reviews, it is apparent something went wrong when I made this dish. I wish you better luck than I had!

Rating: 4
I rarely give 4 forks, but wow, what a great dish -- not only for how it looks and tastes, but also for how easy it is to prepare. My only regret is that I did not double the sauce -- I will do that in the future, and I will be making this a lot in the future! Also, it did take somewhat more than 20 minutes for the salmon to cook through.

So I had already decided to make this for a picky-eating couple who were coming to our house for dinner when my boyfriend called and told me that instead of 6 people, as I had thought, there would be 10 of us. Nice. But this recipe was incredibly easy to prepare ahead, simple to double (triple), impressively presented (I just arranged 10 filets on top of the asparagus in a roasting pan and garnished with a thin slice of lemon- brought the pan from the oven to the table and served the sauce on the side). It went over so well and I didn't feel stressed for a moment. AND it was delicious. Next time I have to feed a group (expected or not) I will certainly use this recipe again.

Relatively quick and easy. I used dill and didn't chop the capers. Poured the sauce over the salmon before cooking. The flavours were not quite as strong. but they melded nicely and cooking it took the edge off the red onion. ASparagus was perfect, even without blanching. Next time would try sauteeing shallots, then adding rest of sauce ingredients and pouring over after salmon is cooked.

This recipe is wonderful! I substituted baby dill for the thyme (I like it better with salmon), and decreased the olive oil big time (trying to consume less oil because of the fat). It was still really wonderful. I'd give three forks, but I added one fork because this dish has such healthy ingredients. Salmon is great for skin and mental health (or so they say). Red onion (and other darkly colored produce) reduces the risk of cancer. Yum! I'll definitely make this again!

Rating: 3
I made this without the asparagus, and used coarse ground salt and pepper on the salmon, and only used lemon juice, capers and dried thyme for the sauce. It was quite good, quick and easy (I usually grill salmon, but out of propane). Anyway, I found that I did not have to cook the salmon but 15 minutes, and it was almost overdone. Be careful with the time!

I'll add a half-fork because it's a great dish for company. The components can be prepared in advance: make sauce; sear the salmon (I add this step for added flavor and color), cover and refrigerate. Then just assemble and bake while having soup, salad, or another glass of wine. Can also be roasted on a bed of wilted spinach.

This is a good but not great dish. It is easy. However, I wonder why the first directions are to make the sauce, which is only used at the very end for serving.

I have made this dish several times now and every time I marvel at how simple it is to prepare such a delicious meal. I drizzle the sauce over the salmon as soon as I take it out of the oven, while it's still in the baking dish. This warms the sauce and lightly sautes the shallots or onions, without making another pan to wash. Perfect.

This recipe was VERY simple and delicious. I think that melted butter would have made the sauce taste better, but olive oil IS healthier. I can compare this recipe to that of salmon that you would get in a restaurant. I made this with a side of saffron rice, so, when I put the fish in the oven, I started the rice, and walked away. It also had a very easy clean up because I used tin foil on the pan. Very simple, I loved not slaving over the stove, or the sink. I would recommend because it is a very easy recipe.

Wow, I would have paid 25 bucks for this entree in a restaurant and gone home happy. I'm a strictly mediocre (albeit adventurous) cook, and this recipe made me look like a star. I sauteed the sauce a little bit first, and added a clove of garlic, a little white wine, and some fresh marjoram and sage to the sauce, then poured about half of it over the salmon before I cooked it. Bliss. One note- I used a pound fillet, and 20 minutes at 450 was exactly right.

I have already made this dish twice with great results. Since it's not always possible to find a piece of salmon of the thickness suggested (or with out skin) where I live, I have to adjust cooking times accordingly.

Everytime I made this dish it was a big hit. Easy to prepare, great presentation. I followed the recommendations and always double or triple the sauce. (Have also served the sauce over chicken!!).

Made lots extra of the sauce and it tasted weird by itself.Being suspicious at that point, I marinated the salmon in olive oil, white wine and dill before roasting.

This is a wonderful sauce, but like everyone else, I recommend doubling or tripling it. I used shallots and dill, instead of onion and thyme. Worked perfectly! Also did not chop the capers, as I like the look and texture of them whole. I heated the sauce slightly before serving it. I would cook the asparagus separately, as it's too hard to get the timing right along with the salmon, depending on the diameter of the spears. Really excellent dish!

Rating: 3
Thought this was just wonderful! Had a slightly thicker fillet and it took a few more mins.; asparagus was slightly larger as well so par-boiled it 1 min. first. Doubled the sauce as another viewer suggested and that was a good idea. The red onion was perfect and I think fresh thyme makes a difference. Beautiful presentation and will make this often... Enjoy!

The first time I made this lemon-caper sauce, I didn't have a red onion so I used a sweet yellow onion. The result was a soft pale yellow color which was a nice contrast to the color of the salmon. When I used the red onion as called for, I was dissapointed in the color of the sauce. It is not as apetitizing a color as with the yellow onion. Tastes great no matter which onion is used.

I never considered myself a big fan of salmon dishes until I came across this one and decided to make it for the first time for my boyfriend. Now, we both love salmon and in particular this recipe. This is a great dish to serve to your friends...easy to make, great presentation, and it's delicious!

My dinner guest pronounced this the best salmon dish she'd ever eaten. I made it on the spur of the moment and didn't have red onion so I used a large shallot I had on hand, which worked great. Following other reviewers' suggestions, I doubled the amount of sauce and spread some on the fish before baking. I served it with rice. Delicate and delicious, and I will make it again.

Very simple and quick. A 1.5 inch thick salmon fillet took 14 minutes. Like the others, doubled sauce and drizzled over fish before cooking. Thought the asparagus was delicious. Be sure to use thick stalks or else they will shrivel to nothing.

A showcase for the currently in-season wild Chinook salmon!! I'm not sure how well farmed salmon would do - the higher oil content of the wild variety did great things for the asparagus. In that wild salmon is thinner than most farmed varieties I cut the cooking time to about 12 minutes and it was perfect. Before roasting I did drape a few springs of dill and lemongrass slices over the fish. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe ROCKS! It was a smash hit at our Mother's Day dinner. I followed the advice of a previous tip and doubled the recipe for the sauce, spooning half on the salmon before cooking and added cream to the remaining sauce which was served with the dish.

This is my sister's favorite salmon dish when I cook! We use lime instead of lemon and always double the sauce, using half while cooking and the rest when serving. Although the asparagus is great, I have also served the salmon over mashed potatoes and wilted spinach with a little garlic. Many choices to pair this with.

This was simply fabulous. I love lox and bagels for breakfast, and this reminded me of those flavors when I read the recipe. What a fantastic use for supper, not to mention quick and with a little rice or orzo, a complete meal. I will certainly make this for company. Do make double the sauce and use half for baking, half to top. And it makes more than four servings of fish, add more asparagus to balance. A lovely spring dish.

I agree this recipe is really tasty. I didn't find any need to heat the sauce. I did increase the amount a little since that's where all the flavor is at. But it probably wouldn't be necessary. It was so easy to make. I love recipes that taste so good but can be made on a week night.

I am always looking for a salmon recipe and this is my new favorite! So easy, great tasting and great looking! I too doubled the sauce -- I put some on top of the salmon while it baked.

Wow! This is one of the easiest and tastiest salmon dishes (and we eat a lot of salmon) I've come across. I did double the sauce amount, even though I only made the salmon portion for 2, and the amount of sauce was just right. I also emulsifed the lemon juice with a bit more oo than called for, and then added the remaining ingredients. Quick, simple, delicious...thanks!

I love how the asparagus tasted making it this way. I had very small sized asparagus. That may be the reason they were perfectly cooked. My husband loved the sauce over the salmon. I took others advice and spread some of the sauce over the salmon prior to baking. I on the otherhand felt like the sauce was too sweet. I enjoyed it, but could not eat a lot of it.

This dish impressed my guests, and was tasty, but I would not make it again. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and slightly pre-cooked the asparagus and tripled the sauce and put some over the salmon while it cooked. However, I much prefer the seared salmon with balsamic glaze which is equally low fat and much less work (and would serve the asparagus on the side.) Note: One plus, the salmon coming out of the oven was perfectly cooked.

I thought this was excellent, done to perfection. I followed the recipe almost exactly as written, but doubled the sauce as everyone suggested. I used fresh lemon scented thyme from my garden, great! I also put the sauce on before cooking as well as after. I made it with salmon for myself and my 8 yr. old son, but made it with swordfish for my husband who can't eat salmon, he thought it was great, a real keeper and easy too!

Served the sauce with steelhead trout, which is similar to salmon. Skipped the asparagus. This was a hit! My 14yr old said "tasty", music to a mom's ears! I doubled the recipe as well, to ensure there would be enough sauce. I used a white onion, as I didn't have a red one, and it was fine. Probably would have more color appeal with a red one.

Tasty & simple. Changes- I baked the salmon with the lemon mixture on it & it added a lot of flavor. The capers were a nice twist to what I have already been doing. I think I will also stick to steaming my asparagus with a little lemon. The color after roasting left something to be desired & the overall flavor is the same.

I tried a few of the suggestions, like doubling the sauce and putting the sauce on the fish before cooking. I also made some hollandaise sauce and poured it over the fish after it came out of the oven. My fiance didn't like the asparagus roasted so I just steamed it the next time I made it. I love this recipe!!

Rating: 3
We have enjoyed this recipe both by adding the sauce before cooking and after cooking - and enjoy it both ways. Shallots worked best for us.We agree 100% with those who say to double the sauce. This recipe is best when really fresh, large asparagus(which we peel)is in season. We tried the zucchini strips, as suggested by someone, and the results were very good. Fresh lemon juice is far superior to the bottled variety.

Rating: 3
I've made this many times since finding it here. Last night I couldn't find asparagus and used strips of young zucchini in its place (with salt, pepper, & thyme on them before roasting). Very good that way too. I haven't doubled the sauce because we're trying to keep fats low, and the recipe is still excellent.

Rating: 2
I made this for dinner last night. It was OK. I had to cook the salmon for about 30 minutes, and the asparagus got overcooked. The asparagus was also a little scary--I love salmon, but I discovered that salmon flavored asparagus is not my favorite. The fish turned out great though. I added a clove of garlic to the sauce.

Rating: 3
This was so good! I didn't have any asparagus, so I just roasted the salmon and then served it with the sauce. I stupidly did not double the sauce recipe; everyone is right, it does not make enough. I think the sauce is very versatile -- I will try fresh on grilled salmon as well as baking it with the salmon. So good!

Rating: 3
Simple and tasty recipe. I would definitely cook the lemon caper sauce unlike what the recipe says. Raw onion on salmon just doesn't sound good to me. The asparagus got a little over cooked in the oven so if I do it again, I would probably cook that in a separate dish and take them out before the fish is done. Other than that, very tasty. I served it with Toasted Almond Saffron Rice (got the recipe here.) Very nice combo.

This was very good. Next time I will probably steam the asparagus a little bit before roasting because it was still a little tough when the salmon was done. That could be because my filet wasn't as thick as called for. I, too, put the sauce on before baking and would do so again.

Rating: 3
Doubling the sauce is absolutely necessary -- it is so fresh and tasty! Next time I would also roast the asparagus for less time; it didn't need as long as the salmon. Also, my friend and I discovered that while there was certainly enough salmon for four, she and I ate all the asparagus by ourselves. Next time, I will double it.

Rating: 3
We eat a lot of salmon so I am always looking for new ways to prepare it. We also love asparagus. What a combo! I had my doubts about the sauce so I microwaved it for 20 seconds before pouring it over the salmon. I served it directly from the baking sheet--salmon on top of asparagus, then drizzled the sauce. It was so easy and so elegant that I will serve it to guests. My husband said it is a "Repeat" which is how he rates new recipes.

Fantastic! Like the previous 2 reviewers, I poured the sauce over the salmon and asparagus before roasting, and the results were delicious and very easy.

Asparagus is not in season now, so I just baked the fish with the one change that I spread the sauce over the fish before I baked it. This cooked the raw ingredients in the sauce and it was delicious and the fish very moist. I also doubled the sauce recipe for a serving of 4.

I'm not sure if there is a purpose to placing the salmon on top of the asparagus, but when done this way, the fat from the fish is on the asparagus when done cooking. I like roasted asparagus, so I would make the again and place the asparagus around the fish. And definitely double the sauce.

I loved this recipe! I agree with others that you MUST make at least double the amount of sauce because you will want it. I ended up putting the salmon and asparagus in a roasting pot on the grill since another reviewer said it smoked up his house. I left it there for about 30 minutes (covered). The fish and asparagus were done but the new potatoes which I had added were still a little undercooked so I took those out and microwaved them a bit just to finish them up. They still retained the nice smokey flavor of the grill. Overall the flavors of this dish were just amazing. Something to make again and again. I usually cook my asparagus until just barely cooked and quite crunchy and although this method cooked it longer, the flavors were so intense and wonderful, it was ok that the asparagus had cooked a bit longer. Well worth it in flavor!!! Give this recipe a chance........it is really, really good!!

The sauce for this fish is absolutely delicious and simple to make! However, if you like your asparagus a little on the crisp-tender side, it should NOT be cooked with the fish since it becomes very mushy. It can be added a little later than the fish and this way everything retains it's fresh flavor.

Once the salmon was placed, I spread a thin layer of crushed garlic on each fillet. When the salmon was done, an entire meal was ready to be served!

Simply divine. We used 3/4 lb. salmon for two of us and it was perfect in 20 minutes. I also brushed the salmon lightly with olive oil before roasting. Used fresh dill instead of thyme in the sauce, and consumed it all on our two portions - so, double the sauce recipe for 4 people. The asparagus was a bit underdone when the fish was cooked; perhaps next time I'll put them in the oven a few minutes before placing the salmon on top. Eminently repeatable! Thanks!
