This was really an easy cookie recipe and so simple. My kids loved them and I made a few variations to them. One batch I added vanilla cinnamon sugar, and the next I added cinnamon and toasted pecans. I tried to bake them without turning them over, but they were better once I turned them over.

I will add A LOT more sugar to this recipe next time. They should be sweeter and a little gooier! Great technique to learn though and a good do ahead.

I'm not much of a baker which is exactly why I loved this recipe. It's really easy and really good. I add cinnamon and sugar between layers. Yum.

I had some leftover puff pastry, so I decided to try this recipe. Great results! I also rolled both sides to the center instead of folding, and I didn't roll out the pastry at all. After slicing, I made sure they were coated well with sugar, and sprinkled some more onto them before I put them into the oven. That way, there was plenty of sugar for them to caramelize in, and I did not need to flip them. I also let the baking sheet preheat in the oven, and arranged the palmiers on a large piece of foil, so that really saved on the cleaning time.

This was a wonderful and simple pastry to make and everyone loved it. I did a variation, adding finely chopped almonds, cinnamon, and nutmeg, which gave it a great kick. I recomend this to anyone whose looking for a simple way to sweeten any day.

I was looking for a simple recipe for a cookie exchange that my non-baking cousin could do, and this is definitely it. It doesn't get any easier than this and they taste GREAT! They do burn easily, so I'll need to play with the cooking times like everyone else to get it right. I might even try to add some mini chocolate chips.

Too easy! The only con to being small is that I tend to eat too many. With my darker teflon-coated cookie sheets, I reduced the initial baking time to 8 minutes.

The idea is good, but I thought the cookies were too small and they burned very easily. I think I will have to play around with it till I get it right. any suggestions would be great.

I always keep puff pastry handy now so I can make fresh palmiers on a moments notice. These are also great when sprinkled with cinnamon prior to baking. However, one word of caution: be sure not to overwork the pastry or your cookies won't come out big and puffy.

I use Turbinado sugar rather than granulated and I roll each end to the center rather than folding the pastry. Chilling is helpful. Plus I only bake on one side. Everyone loves these.

This was good. I had a little trouble keeping the "ears" together. Perhaps refrigeration before cooking or using light egg wash would have helped?
