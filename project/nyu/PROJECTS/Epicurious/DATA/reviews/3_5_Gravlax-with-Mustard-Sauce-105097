Delish! Gravlax makes an impressive and festive appetizer when entertaining, or serve it with buttered boiled potatoes. I like to present it on Rycrisp crackers with the mustard sauce and a garnish of dill. I made a couple of small changes to the recipe. First off, use tweezers to pull out any remaining bones (use your fingertips to feel for the bones). I added 2 tablespoons cracked coriander and 2 tablespoons Aquavit to the salt/sugar mix. The sauce is too oily, so either add one egg yolk or reduce the oil to 1/2 cup.

I put wrapped the salmon with the salt mixture in plastic wrap and put it a plastic box in the refrigerator for two days (which might have been too much, as the top of the salmon started to get little tough.) I changed the sauce recipe, using mayonnaise instead of oil, and using some sugar since I only had dijon. I added capers to the plate instead of lemons, and served with sliced baguette. It was excellent and people loved it.

I had no problem with the sauce, but you do have to beat it constantly while adding the oil VERY slowly!! It was as thick as mayonaisse when I was done- SOOOO good! This is the traditional Swedish Gravlax recipe, you really cannot fail! It is better with the skin on, but I have even done it with a piece of salmon with no skin.

I thought the gravlax were delicious and so simple to make! I made it for a celebratory brunch and people raved. The only issue with the recipe is that the mustard sauce seems to be missing the addition of two egg yokes. You can't get it to a "mayonnaise consistency" without them; this is just a vinaigrette.

Preparation of the salmon fine but not the sauce. Far too much salad oil. I had to mix with store-mayo to get any consistency that would spread without it slipping off the pumpernickel

Very good. Maybe I'm the only nerd who didn't do it but just in case there's someone like me out there: remove bones from the fish!. Otherwise you won't have a nice thin cut. The second time we did it, it was amazing. Mixed white and black peppercorns.

Absolutely delicious--great taste and texture. I used black peppercorns and put the salmon into the refrigerator right away (didn't leave it out at room temperature), then let it stay in the fridge for 3 days, periodically pouring off liquid and reversing position of fish. Important to weight down the salmon. I did not make the sauce but served the gravlax with new potatoes and cornichons. It might be good on a bread made with dried fruit for contrast between salt and sweet.

Very easy to make. Have used the recipe a couple of times. Recommend the recipe to anyone......

The recipe is great. I cured it for three days and added a 1/4 cup of aquavit, which made it more flavorful. For the mustard sauce, I used canola oil for the mustard and would NOT recommend using it because of the aftertaste of canola. The sauce, otherwise, is great tasting and easy to make.

This was fabulous. It was my first time to taste or even make this dish. First tasted as an appetizer on European pumpernickel bread with red onion slivers, capers, fresh dill, dallop of sour cream and fresh lemon. It was outstanding. Can't wait to try some with the mustard sauce.

This is a good recipe. The reason I wouldn't make it again is because although the recipe is sound and tasty, my version includes Wild Turkey bourbon whiskey and sliced red (or other sweet)onion slices. I cut the salmon to fit a plastic food storage container, seal it in a resealable food bag, and weight it down with a ceramic tile on which I put a heavy can of whatever (like tomatoes). Refrigerate. The last gravlax I made for last weekend's brunch cured for two weeks. There was nothing left but the skin (which, according to another review, I must and shall definitely crisp and char and serve as a condiment).

I was surprised that your recipe didn't include what I consider to be the standard ingredient with all Gravlax--fennel? My husband's recipe also has creme fraiche, mayonnaise and honey in the sauce. Very yummy! Just a hint for lovers of this type of salmon....try it on cooked pasta with a little of the sauce mixed in. Decadent!

We make Gravlax frequently and this is a good recipe. The proportions are fine, and the mustard sauce was excellent. I followed the directions.

Excellent recipe, but in addition to using extremly fresh salmon (not a problem in Seattle), I would suggest freezing the fillets for 24h at least then cure the fish under a weight in the refrigerator for 36-48h, covered in plastic wrap and turn every 12h and pour off the accumulating fluids that are exuding. The mustard sauce recipe is the simplist I have found yet.

I found a divine recipe in Williams-Sonoma Complete Entertaining Cookbook for Gravlax made which included with the usual; Gin, Juniper berries and mint. It was a great variation on a theme. Absolutely divine!

There's another recipe - see " Gravad Lax" I made kind of a mixture of both ( I also weighed it down with cans, sprinkeled it with brandy, and turned it over after 24 hrs for a total curing time of 48 hrs in the frige ) I found it difficult to slice. I cut the 3 1/2 lbs I made into 1 inch wide strips. I took one and lightly brushed it with liquid smoke and baked it at 350 degrees for 15 minutes, then chilled it. I loved the result so I took the rest of the pieces and smoked them in my gas BBQ with mesquite and hickory chips for an hour. I think the result is great - it's flakey, delicious by itself ( no sauce needed !) and would be great in omelets or salads.

Very good. I have made it twice. The second time I turned the salmon over after 12 hours. Better result this way.

To make the flavor more sophisticated, add 1 tsp each of ground cardamom and allspice. I also weigh down the salmon with heavy cans to enhance the texture. I serve it on baby potato pancakes with dilled sour cream. Try it!

I have not made the mustard sauce, but the salmon itself was delicious--a great alternative to store-bought kind.

Instead of the mustard sauce, I served the gravlax with dill cream cheese on pumpernickel cocktail bread. Very simple, very successful.

Elegant, fast and easy. Everything I look for in a dish.
