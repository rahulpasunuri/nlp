I would give this recipe 4 forks, but it's not really clear on the breadcrumb front. How crumby should the crumb be? Can I get a weight? For the record, I used about 25 grams (post-toasting) breadcrumbs, and it seemed to turn out just fine. I made this for an anglophile's birthday. He says that the tart has less molasses than he's used to. Next time I might up the molasses a bit and cut back on the sugar in the creme fraiche.

I shall dare to review this recipe, which is a great dessert, actually. Many Americans will know nothing of treacle other than its frequent mention in the Harry Potter books (they eat it ALL the time at special occasions). For those new to British cuisine, treacle is a delicious concoction of cane syrup and eggs, often baked into tart form. Think the "goo" from pecan pie, just not as cloyingly sweet. This particular recipe masterfully blends the sweetness of the treacle with the tartness of apple. The crust was simple to make and roll out, And the filling was simple enough. I use breadcrumbs made from overstock French bread from a local French bakery, and these work well. The resulting dessert is sweet, but not horribly so, with a certain richness and elegance. Sometimes tarts get overlooked for special occasions because they can be sad little flat things, especially when compared to a towering three tier carrot cake oozing with icing. But I find a tart like the one this recipe makes to be more sophisticated, delicious and simple than many of the sugary piles of mess Americans sometimes prefer. And plated correctly, this can be quite a beautiful dessert. At the very least, one should make this for a son/daughter or niece/nephew and tell them that this is what the famous Harry Potter eats before taking on the forces of evil.
