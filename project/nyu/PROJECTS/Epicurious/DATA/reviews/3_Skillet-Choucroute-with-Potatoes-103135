I found a jar of sauerkraut in the back of the pantry, and my husband likes kielbasa, so I tried this recipe. My husband NEVER takes third helpings of anything, but he did of this dish! It was really, really good. I noticed other cooks did not like the cider, so I just used 1 1/2 cups broth. That was the only change I made. No salt needed, of course, because the sauerkraut is so salty. Very quick and easy and so, so delicious. The tastes came together beautifully. A very unusual taste combination--different from what one eats every day--and a true European peasant meal. Gotta love Epicurious.com!

I agree with the cook from Boston. This recipe doesn't come together well. I followed the recipe and regretted taking the time to make it. I won't be making this again.

Sorry, this doesn't work for me. The dish didn't come together very well, and was disconcertingly sweet.

Delicious mid-week meal, quick and satisfying.

This is a fabulous quick mid-week recipe. Throw in some carraway seeds and juniper berries and replace the cider with riesling to jazz it up a bit. This will be in my repetoire for years to come.

This is a delicious easy weeknight meal. I added extra sauerkraut and broth to mine and I used white wine instead of the cider. It brought me back to my trip to Germany!

This was a tasty and easy meal to make. I substituted turkey kielbasa and lower sodium beef broth to make the dish a little healthier. A great dinner for a Wednesday!
