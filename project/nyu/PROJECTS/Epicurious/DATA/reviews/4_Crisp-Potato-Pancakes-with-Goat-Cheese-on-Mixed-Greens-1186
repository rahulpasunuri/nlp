A sly and relatively simple recipe that effuses flavor. Tip: instead of wringing out the water from the potatoes (never works for me), bake them half way first. You won't lose the necessary starch and you'll get a great golden color when they're fried.

I make these pancakes a lot...a real favorite. For Thanksgiving this year we are making them with sweet potatoes...the test batch were yummy.

This is a great recipe! I've made it twice so far, both times with the goat cheese, but I think in the future I'll substitute it with cream cheese or omit the cheese all together. I'm really picky about goat cheese and only like it in certain recipes and I guess this wasn't one of them.

Delish! Crispy and good....drying the potatoes was key to crispness...I made one with cream cheese since one of my guests wasn't into goat cheese...just as good!

This was pretty yummy! Served it with Duck with Blackberry Sauce, also on this site. I agree with other reviewers that the pancakes could be smaller. We didn't use monster russets, so our two regular organic potatoes made about 3. We'll make them a bit smaller next time. Also left out the garlic in the salad dressing because we didn't need to ward off vampires tonight. Was delicious.

Just made these and they are phenomenal. We added some jalapenos for heat and also threw some sliced ham and Swiss cheese. Great as a main or an app.

Really quite delicious. I loved the combination of the mixed greens, cheese and the potato pancake. In lieu of goat cheese, I used gorgonzola and loved it. Additionally, I changed the proportions of oil and vinegar in the salad dressing and liked it much better (more vinegar, less oil), but the combination of the shallots, garlic and chives is phenomenal.

The goat cheese is soo good in this recipe. At another reviewers suggestion I microwaved the potatoes for 2 minutes prior to making. I recommend grating the potatoes right before you are ready to make or they will turn an icky black color. Also I recommend making the cakes smaller. Overall - very yummie!!

I make this recipe for my breakfast - when my husband & I are feeling like something a little decadent. If we have it, I sub Boursin cheese (Gournay cheese - a soft, herbed cheese) for the goat cheese and serve the pancakes with a side of homemade apple sauce - delicious!

I only made the potato pancakes however it was an incredibly easy recipe to make and turned out delicious. Using a finer grate on the potatoes, I was able to cook up and brown the pancakes within 2-3 minutes on each side and they were perfectly cooked within that time. To richen up the flavor I used a mixture of butter and olive oil and then crumbled a little more goat cheese on top. I avoided the soggy pancakes by wringing the potatoes several times and then letting them air out for another five minutes or so. All in all this was a fabulous and delicious recipe!

The result was not crispy, but soggy, and too much goat cheese. Based on all the great reviews I'll try it again hoping for better results.

Very easy. Takes much more time than 6 minutes per side. Probably 10 per side, on a medium fire to avoid burning the potato cakes. I really liked the salad dressing. Chives are interesting--I could see green onion being just as good with a little more bite. I served this with salmon marinated in a dijon mustard, lemon juice, dried oregano, and olive oil, then cook in this sauce and serve over. Yummy!

Wonderful recipe. The goat's cheese offers a nice contrast to the potatoes. I have also tried this with Brie, which is nice and creamy, but doesn't give the potatoes the extra flavour that they need. I also enjoy this dish accompanied by something a little spicier.

I make this as an appitizer when cooking for 4+, but serve it as a main dish when cooking for 2. My guests (and I) are always impressed. I microwave the shredded potatoes about 2 mins. before frying. This way, they are cooked perfectly on the inside and nice and crisp on the outside.

This was truly divine - I served it with slices of smoked salmon and lemon wedges. This will be a regular.

Served this as a salad instead of an appetizer. WOW! So easy and all compliments. This makes a novice cook like me feel like a pro!

I made this last nite for a dinner party. It was simple yet delious. For a short cut, I used Ore Ida hash brown (found in the freezer section of your market) and tossed those in a bowl with some salt and pepper. I made these potato and goat cheese patties ahead of time and just reheated in oven before serving. The dressing was so tasty.

Very good and easy to make. I was in a time crunch and bought potatos already. Still worked great. Will definitely make this one over and over.

This is a superb recipe. A reviewer wondered why her potatoes turned black. The secret to avoiding this problem is to toss each potato into a bowl of cold, lightly salted water as soon as you have finished grating it. After all the potatoes have been grated, allow them to sit in the bowl of water while you assemble the other ingredients for the pancakes. When you're ready to use the grated potatoes, drain them into a colander and squeeze out all the liquid between your hands. Then quickly combine them with the other ingredients. Also, while I'm cooking each batch of potato pancakes, I keep the remaining potatoes in the bowl covered with a clean kitchen towel. This has always kept my potatoes from discoloring.

This is a bit more like a salad than appetizer, and was extremely well-received by our guests. I've made it a few times now, and everyone I make this for loves it.

I'm a new cook, so I'm sure everyone else didn't have this problem -- but I clearly didn't cook the pancakes soon enough after grating them (10 minutes?). The pancakes turned out a purpley-black shade, which I hear is due to exposure. Unattractive, but delicious. I will try again, moving faster next time!

Great and versatile for main course or appetizer. In lieu of chives in pancakes, mixed in chopped fresh parsley with the potato, a dash of cayenne (if you like a bit of spiciness) and turned out superb.

Really enjoyed dish. Kids liked potatoe pancakes and adding the greens and goat cheese made it a great "adult" dish. My only problem is that I did not make enough. Guests asked for more, but I had only made 2 pancakes per person.

Yum! I served this dish for brunch with a nice bottle of white wine. It can be an appitizer or a main course. Don't skip the greens. So good!

I didn't try this but a note to the person who couldn't find russets. Just find potatos that are not new. Baking potatoes are fine. I've used Yukon gold for pancakes before. They worked great!

CANNOT FIND RUSSET POTATOES IN THIS AREA. WHAT POTATO IS COMPARABLE. THANK YOU

Very tasty and original! I served this with Seared Salmon atop Baby Spinach, another recipe I got from this website
