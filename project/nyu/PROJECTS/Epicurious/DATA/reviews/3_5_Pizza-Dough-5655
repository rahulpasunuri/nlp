I have used this recipe for years...I do add more salt and use kosher at that. I think I 6x the recipe and make stromboli out of it. Turns out great every time and get great reviews. I did find the pre-baking of the crust helpful that was mentioned in these reviews. I will have to try that next time.

Just thought I'd add how I cook it... Preheat oven to 500°F. I use a stoneware pan (& the dough makes one large rectangular pizza). Once it is rolled out and on the pan, lightly prick dough all over with a fork (if rolled out too much you can make a cheese crust by putting cheese around the edges and folding over the extra dough - press in with fingers + fork, but don't prick the crust or cheese will bubble out). Bake until top is puffed and pale golden in patches (~ 6 to 10 min). Add toppings and bake until edge of crust is deep golden and cheese is bubbling and golden in patches (~8 to 10 min).

This dough is amazing. I add herbs to it, but even without them it is really good. Comes out perfect every time, and it's really easy to make.

I make this recipe about once a week. It makes a great, thin, crispy crust. It makes 2 medium pizzas. I freeze one for later in the week when I don't feel like cooking. Roll your dough out with a rolling pin. Put it in the fridge to keep it from rising until you are ready to use it. Preheat a pizza pan in your oven at about 500. Cook the crust by itself, turning once for a couple of minutes. It gets all those great bubbles in it. Top it and return it to the oven. This way you get a really crispy crust! I sometimes add garlic, parmesan or herbs to the dough. Love this recipe!

Thanks for the alterations HHosch. I reduced the regular flour by 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup cornmeal. The cornmeal gives it a nicer crunch.

After trying many pizza doughs, this is definitely the one I'm settling on! It is a very good dough, easy to stretch out, great tasting. I used a pizza stone (which I think makes an enormous difference no matter what dough you use!) and cornmeal on the pizza peel. I think that the bread dough (high gluten flour) makes all the difference. Please don't use all-purpose in its place!

I've had bad or mediocre results with other recipes and had been looking for a good pizza dough to use as a foundation for improving on my pizza making skill. This is definitely a good recipe for that. I have made this recipe a couple times now and have gotten good consistent results. The dough rises well and once baked the bread has a good taste to it and comes out crunchy where you want it to. I am now working on doing modifications as some have suggested in other reviews for this recipe. I am confident that it will come out great.

A great recipe. I used a mixture of flours... white, whole wheat, rye, spelt. It doesn't seem to make as much as it indicates. Two hungry adults were able to eat up a couple of lightly dressed pizzas (hey, we hadn't had lunch!) I would recommend a little more salt.

Sacramento, see instructions for using the pizza stone in the recipe for Pizza Marinara, on this site. The stone makes all the difference in the world! Also, try using cornmeal instead of flour on the pizza peel (the large wooden paddle you use to put the pizza on the stone and to remove it.)

Rating: 2
The flavor was bland, should have added some herbs as in the previous reviews. Splitting it into two balls made each pizza either very small or with a thin crust - don't split it if you want a thicker crust. It's a good enough recipe, but nothing that makes me want to try it again.

The dough turned out to be very good. We made 1 thick-crust pizza with it and around the edges of the crust we brushed olive oil and sprinkled garlic salt. It was very good and I think it would make great breadsticks!

I hope A Cook from Mukilteo will see this and help me with this question. According to your tips - Preheat a pizza stone at the highest temp you can for 30 min. before cooking the pizza. What's the best way to work with a hot pizza stone? Do I need to strech or press the raw pizza on the pizza stone?

I fear yeast... and even I did okay with this recipe, in spite of my fears at every turn (didn't process the right way, didn't knead properly, etc). The dough was crispy on the bottom and chewy (not tough) elsewhere. Its flavor is the only thing not stellar, so I will experiment with some seasonings next time.

Have made this many times now, very popular with the toddlers. I like to add 1 1/2 tbsp dried basil flakes and about 2 tbsp minced garlic for extra flavor. Re: the "envelope" of yeast, according to my Fleischmann's jar of rapid rise yeast, an "envelope" is supposed to be 2 1/4 tsp. Cheers!

This is an easy dough recipe. It makes a perfect amount. {to answer the post about the "envelope", in the states dry yeast is sold in a sleeve of 3 envelopes. One envelope is about 2 or so teaspoons (?) of dry yeast.

Was browsing and this caught my eye. Hey, been working on the "perfect pizza crust" for about two years now. Just about there, after lengthly (and sometimes painful for the poor individuals) conversations with pizza places throughout the US. It's really more about the technique than anything for getting a good crust. Challenge at home is also not having an oven than heats to those kinds of temperatures. What I've learned from the pizza guys: 1) (and the most important) The dough needs to sit overnight in the fridge, and then come to room temperature the next day before being used. This allows the glutens to develop. 2) Use a bread machine or dough hook. Hand-made leads to too much flour/ tough pizza dough. 3) Preheat a pizza stone at the highest temp you can for 30 min. before cooking the pizza. 4) Use a can of spray olive oil. After you have built your pizza, but before sliding it in the oven, spray the oil in a nice coat over the exposed uncooked crust rim. This will keep the crust from becoming cardboard while your pizza cooks. 5) I add about 3 T. olive oil to the dough to prevent cardboard crust. 6) Keep the crust thin in the middle and don't overload the cheese or toppings (leads to soggy pizza) 6) There is NO substitute for decent, whole-milk mozzarella. The good places all use it! ....OK, guess I'll go get a life now :)

Have made this twice. First time was better than the second. I will try it again, but will try some of the tips others have offered like adding herbs or cheese to the dough. I found it to be a bit bland but I have not found a better recipe yet.

This was an excellent pizza crust recipe and very easy. I made it in my KitchenAid mixer and I never did any kneading.

Very simple to make dough, I used fresh stone ground red wheat flour which made it a bit dryer but kept the healthy twist to pizza which I was seeking. Added crumbled nori (seaweed) to the dough for a Pacific Northwest twist. Dough made 2 very thin 14" rounds - next time I would double for a bit thicker crust for this size of rounds.

This is a great pizza crust, and easy too. The others below are right, add some herbs to taste (I add grated parm. cheese, garlic and basil). Also, this makes ONE crust for my large stone, not two. This one is a keeper!

This recipe made good but not great pizza dough. The texture is very good, but the flavor is lacking. I am still on a quest to find that "perfect pizza dough."

This was an excellent base - I made 2 very thin regular size crusts from this recipe (and another time I made 3 personal size crusts). I added various dried herbs and seasonings - basil, oregano, crushed red pepper, grated parm. I baked the crusts for about 10 minutes at 425, then wrapped them individually in foil/ziploc bags and froze them. When I wanted one, I just popped it out of the freezer (no need to thaw), added the toppings and baked on a pizza stone for about 10-15 minutes at 425 again. Super crispy and so good! Tastes so much better than frozen pizzas and if you freeze a batch of crusts ahead of time, it's really quick and easy to have homemade pizza anytime.

A very simple recipe, which came out beautifully crisp. I did not prebake it, just topped with veggies and cheese. It only made one 14" pizza.

This easy, and fun to make curst is my new staple. I added some herbs to the crust and was pleased with the outcome; very tasty. I only had enough dough to make one 14" thin-crust pizza, so those of you looking to make more than one pizza might consider doubling the recipe.

Good basic pizza dough. Everyone loved it. I did pre-bake them before topping, and then baked again. Helps make the crust crispier (a pizza stone helps too). This will be my standard pizza dough recipe from now on. Enjoy!

After making this recipe, I can't believe I ever bought pre-made pizza crust!!! It was so easy. My first time using yeast and it was a success. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and half regular, and I 'baked' the dough on the BBQ - 4 minutes per side. It was amazing. Topped it with homemade pesto, fresh tomatoes, grilled corn and grilled onions an a little fresh mozzarella and asiago cheese - AMAZING!! The crust was 3 forks, the entire pizza, 4 forks. (BTW - the pizza recipe is from the September 2002 Canadian Living magazine)

We liked the crispy crust this dough made. Add some roasted garlic. Very good.

This dough is delicious. We generally add some fresh Rosemary to the batch, which obviously enhances the flavor even more. Freezes nicely, even rose more after removing from the cold. Company raves over the crust and so do we!

I love this recipe. My kids love it, and it's something my husband and I can dress up so we enjoy it just as much! I like a thinner crust, so I can make 3 8" pizzas out of this recipe. I think the flavor is great as is, but I will probably increase the salt to 1 t. instead.

You definately need to add a handful of herbs or garlic to the dough and follow the additional measurements given by other reviewer(thanks for those!) then it is a good dough , better than the others listed.

i make this recipe pretty often, usually subbing in whole wheat flour for half the flour. it makes 3 personal-size crusts (6 if you double the recipe.) generally i bake them for 10 minutes at 450 degrees, then freeze them. then i just yank them out, throw on some toppings, and bake at 450 for another 15 minutes or so. good quick meal for during the work week!

Pizza dough was a great hit at our recent make-your-own-pizza party with 2 other families! I agree that the recipe does not go very far - makes two very small pizzas. For the cook from Minneapolis - how long do you bake the crusts that you freeze? I would like to make extra next time and freeze some extra crusts.

It was O.K. But, it didn't make enough for two crusts. I prefer other recipes.

This was so easy and turned out really well. I only have a mini food processor so I just mixed the ingredients with a wooden spoon, and it still came together beautifully. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested the addition of garlic, oregano and parsley -- yum! I found it was only necessary to knead the dough for about three minutes, though. Definitely a keeper!

An excellent recipe for pizza dough. Wonderful flavor, can be enhanced with your choice of herbs if desired. Dough is a joy to work with. By far the best that I have made. If you sometimes use mixes to make pizza crust, you won't after making this. Just as easy and infinitely better taste.

A decent, simple crust that I've made many times. I usually make a triple batch and par-bake and freeze the extra crusts for a quick pie at a later date. Forming and baking the crusts on parchment paper makes it easier to slide off the peel into the oven. I normally don't embellish the crust, but focus on great toppings to make a great pie.

I have been looking for a good pizza dough recipe, and so far this is the best one. I love the way this turned out. It made for a very tasty pizza. Thanks to the Central NC cook for her baking temp. and time suggestions. I followed them and it came out wonderful. After adding sauce, thawed frozen spinach, fresh tomatoes (yellow and red) about 5 cloves of minced garlic and mozzerella cheese...man, it tasted better than the pizzeria down the street!

This is a great thin/crispy crust recipe. It will make enough for two pies -- just roll it out really thin. After halving it, try putting each ball on a lightly floured piece of parchment paper then cover the dough with plastic wrap. Let it rest for 10 minutes, then roll each one out to 14 inches. Getting the dough even is more important than getting a perfect circle. Roll it out to 1/32 inch. Remove the plastic and add sauce, cheese, etc. If you want a thin, crisp crust, this is the recipe to make! Yum!

I used this as one crust rather than two. it made a nice crust that baked well on a pizza stone. next time I'll probably decrease the salt (depending on the toppings) because it seemed a little salt heavy.

HHosch, Your modified recipe was fantastic. Baked on a pizza stone, mini size with smoked salmon, butternut squash, goat cheese, corn, etc. Nicely flavored crust, excellent texture. LOVE THE WHOLE WHEAT!

Excellent basic pizza dough. The recipe makes enough for dough for one 14" round crust: perfect for two people. I substituted 1/2 cup cornmeal for 1/2 cup of the flour--it gave my dough a little more crunch and some extra flavor. And like others here, I used my Kitchen Aid mixer for blending and kneading.

Rating: 4
Great "starter" dough. I added spices to the dough before letting it rise, and they gave it a great flavor without losing the consistency. To save on kneading time and effort, I relied on my Kitchenaid mixer's dough hook, which cut the mix time in half. I used an "airbake" insulated pizza pan and cooked my pizza on 425 for 20 minutes, and it was very even throughout. It even withstood being covered in thick layers of cheese, roma tomatoes, red and yellow peppers, sauteed portabella mushrooms, and then more cheese. It only makes eight slices though, so double up if you need more!

I can tell that this recipe does not make much dough. Follow the directions, but add the following proportion of ingredients and you'll make two 12" - 14" crusts. 1+1/2cups warm water, 1Tblsp. honey, 1 C. Whole wheat flour, 2+1/2 - 3 C. bread flour, 2Tblsp. olive oil and 1 tsp. salt. Leave the dough slightly sticky for a lighter crust.

This is the only way I'll make pizza at home any more. Bake a loaf of this dough full of garlic and herbs and you have a great appetizer or use it for calzones, stuffed with peperoni and cheese.

The recipe suggests that two crusts are possible - make that two very small crusts. If you want to feed more than two people, the amount of dough would make just one crust. Otherwise, it was easy to make, but not overly delicious. I think adding some other ingredients, as other readers have suggested, might be a good thing.

Good Basic Pizza Dough. I lieu of using the salt I added 1/2 of fresh grated Parmesan cheese after punching the dough down. I also added finely minced sun dried tomatoes and calamata olives, oregano and minced garlic.

I am in search of a very good pizza dough recipe. Based on the reviews, I made this one. I thought it was just OK, nothing special. It was easy to make. I used my Kitchenaid with dough hooks to make the dough, Let it rise in a crockery bowl on top of my dryer while the dryer was running. I then used a preheated stone sprinkled with cornmeal and baked for 10 minutes. It was easy work with and was crisp, just didn't stand out.

I've been looking for a pizza dough recipe that everyone will love and I think this is it -- consistent, tasty, not too thin or too thick. I make the dough in my breadmaker and sometimes store it in the fridge overnight. I find the dough very easy to work with, even after refrigerating.

My favorite crust! I have made over ten pies already and have enjoyed it every time. Shaping the dough prior to putting the toppings can take some practice but, you won't regret it. I make the pizza on a wooden pizza pie retriever(Looks like a big spatula). Use lots of flour and cornmeal so it will slide to the stone easily. I preheat the stone for an hour at 500deg. Bake for about 10min. The crust comes out crispy and flavorful every time.

I've tried numerous pizza dough recipes, looking for one that would end up with a crust not too thin, not too thick, that would always work out, and that was simple ..... found it!!!
