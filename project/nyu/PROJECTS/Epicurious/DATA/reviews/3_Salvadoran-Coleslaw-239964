This went well with the Salvadoran Pupusas on this site, but I'd make minor adjustments next time. A little smokey paprika and a pinch of red pepper would be nice. I totally agree with the reviewer who decided to use white vinegar instead of cider vinegar. The latter is just too sweet (and don't make the mistake of using a sweet onion, or it will compound the issue). I used half white, half cider and it was still too sweet for our tastes. Oregano and pepper are a must as is taking the time to chill. You AND the curtido. ;o)

Can also be prepared without the blanching step and with plain white vinegar. I highly recommend adding dried oregano for color and flavor. Can be served over traditional Salvadoran pupusas!

My in-laws were from San Salvador, and always made this for Pupusa's and to go on turkey sandwiches after Thanksgiving. They also added some purple cabbage, oregano, salt & pepper and canned diced Ortega chili's.

I love Salvadoran Coleslaw (curtido). However, I made this recipe with regular white vinegar and prefer the taste much more than the cider vinegar. I also add crushed red pepper to give it a kick, dried oregano, as well as salt to taste.

I added a minced hot pepper because when i have had pupusas in a salvadorian restaurant they were served with a spicy coleslaw. This was a nice simple coleslaw which i enjoyed much more than the creamy type. I will make it again to serve with other dishes.
