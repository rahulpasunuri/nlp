I find that these take quite awhile to soften and really get pickled. You can speed up the process by microwaving the mixture for a minute or so.

These are a great condiment for tacos, and so easy. Also a beautiful color.

For such a simple condiment, these onions received tons of compliments. I made a double recipe for the pork tacos and it all went!
