Crisp & savory and just a little heat - potentially addictive. No cookie press here so I used bench flour to mold into a log and froze for about 45 minutes. Sliced up thinly and baked. Will freeze dough to use in a flash.

Good taste - a little greasy though - maybe low fat cheese next time...still delicious.

This is not one of my favorite dishes on this website. I would make something different if I were you.

This was supposed to be the new dish to try for my boyfriend's birthday party, but I forgot to make it in time. Went ahead and put it together later and discovered that I was happier not having to share these with anyone else. My boyfriend thinks they're just a bit too spicy, but they seemed fairly mild to me. They work best refridgerated, and then reheated whenever you want a snack. These crackers are my all-time favorite recipe from this site... so far.

Quick and easy. Great with wine, They have a nice little kick to them. I found the cookie press method of making straws a little tedious, and hard on my hands, so I used the cookie mode and made cheese cookies. They looked cute and worked out well.

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST AND EASIEST CRACKER. EVERYONE LOVES THEM. HAVE MADE THEM MANY TIMES USING THE COOKIE PRESS WITH THE RIBBON DISK AS RECIPE SUGGESTS. IS A REAL WINNER.

Not only do these crackers smell gorgeous while baking and look terrific when they come out of the oven, they're light and buttery and spicy and cheesy and TASTY! I sprinkled one batch with poppy seeds and one batch with sesame seeds, which adds a little piquant crunch to the cracker and looks pretty too.

I made these for New Years Eve. They are light and buttery but with a sneaky warm bite to them. It also is fast. I whipped out a batch in less than five minutes (less baking time). It is an absolute winner!
