Have been making this recipe for years...it's always a big hit! I usually use Grand Marnier instead of bourbon--because I never have bourbon in the house! I like it even better that way!

Oops The gingersnaps/pecan topping was in the Nov 2010 issue of bon appetit not 2011.Don't drink wine while writting reviews!

I can't believe I hadn't seen and made this before. The sweet potato puree was as tasty as written. Instead of the pecans I made the gingersnaps/pecan topping from the sweet potate pudding recipe in Nov 2011. A nice combo and big hit with the family.

I first had this recipe when my mother made it and have made it myself for a number of years now since she's gone. Always get rave reviews and it actually is popular to those that don't think they like sweet potatoes. I have added a little brown sugar at times depending on the sweet potatoes themselves. I also add some orange zest and some cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. It's a great make ahead dish. Love the idea of putting a pinch of cayenne in with the nuts so will try that this year.

I have been making this receipe since 1997. We have tried other sweet potatoe recipes but this is everyone's favorite year after year!

I've been making this for years and it's always a hit. It's a very flexible recipe - use more/less bourbon as you like. Lately I've been coarsely chopping the pecans before mixing them with the sugar - easier to serve. Typically I add a bit more sugar to the nuts. It wouldn't be Thanksgiving at our house without this dish.

I've made this recipe several times, always for Thanksgiving, and many times as an impressive side dish in winter. Like other reviewers, I also add more bourbon, but make no other changes. It is always a favorite, and was just requested for my 2008 Thanksgiving dinner.

An absolute new favorite. Even guests who do not care for sweet potatoes loved it. I did alter to be half sweet potato and half yam and Doubled the bourbon!!!!

I make this recipe every Thanksgiving and also for entertaining. I add more bourbon and use cinnamon and nutmeg for additional seasoning. I also add a touch of cayenne pepper and brown sugar to the pecans.

This is my favorite sweet potato recipe, and I've made it many times to rave reviews. I always add more bourbon, because for me, at 3 tbsps, there's no point in putting it in. I add it to taste, I also toss the pecans in extra brown sugar and butter to get them nice and sugary.

I made this last night for a dinner party and was not impressed. Very boozy but bland - all I tasted was bourbon and sweet potatoes. I have a another recipe I usually use - which includes cinnamon, nutmeg, cream, and orange juice with a pecan streusel topping - that is spicier and has much more flavor. I will definitely not waste my time making this again.

Not bad, but the bourbon taste was a bit too strong. Kids don't like the buttered pecans.

Quality flavor with a nice touch of brown sugar on top. Best way to get the potato out of the skin was to cut in half and scoop out with a spoon.

this was wonderful again this year-- I like to alternate recipes, and am glad I made this-- the people that liked sweet potatoes were in heaven. Plenty sweet without any added sugar (except the brown on top) I used slightly less than 3T of bourbon with about 71/2 lbs of potaotes, and felt it could have used a little more, but just taste it as you add in.

this is the favorite sweet potato recipe at our house. i serve it during the holidays to rave reviews. to reduce the fat content, i substitute praline syrup (torani) for the butter and it is delicious.

Everyone liked this fine, but I thought the bourbon was bit overpowering and also found the pureeing to be unncessary and rather unpleasant, as the potatoes were so smooth that they had a baby food-like texture. If I were to make it again, I'd cut the bourbon in half and mash the potatoes by hand, but I probably won't bother and will instead stick with other faves, including Maple-Glazed Yams with Pecan Topping from this site (Bon Appetit, December 1998).

Discovered this recipe just last Thanksgiving...wish I'd known about it sooner. Everyone loves it, even the guests that normally "hate" sweet potatoes. I think it was the Jack Daniels. It's a keeper for sure!

I printed this recipe years ago & finally used it this Thanksgiving. Can't believe I waited so long! My Mom always makes her yams with pineapple & marshmellows - she loved the taste as well as the simplicity of this recipe. I used 3 large cans of yams & Amaretto instead of Bourbon. We also made it in a shallow 9 x 13 dish so that every serving would get some of the yummy pecans. It was the hit @ our table, everyone asked for seconds! I think we found a new way to make yams from now on! Enjoy!

Thank you Esther!! I make this recipe every year for thanksgiving for the few (but faithful) sweet potato fans in my family. I followed your suggestion about using canned sweet potatoes and EVERYBODY ate them this year. No leftovers! (I also deviated slightly this year by drizzling about 1/8 of a cup of cream and 3 tbls of brown sugar into the mixture.) It's always a great dish, but your tip made it so convenient!

I have made this many times - it is often requested - to make easier I substitute canned sweet potatoes - warmup in microwave, drain then follow recipe - don't see a difference in quality

Made this for Thanksgiving for my cajun husband's entire family. Most everyone loved it but agreed that the bourbon was a bit overpowering. Definitely will make it again -- with half the bourbon next time.

I used a potato masher and while it was baking, pushed some of the brown sugar down into the mixture. The bourbon really made the dish. Didn't miss the pecans (none on hand). A simple yet delicious side dish.

Certainly could taste the bourbon. Next time I might cut it in half.

This recipe is so simple to prepare, but big on taste! I love that there is so little sugar added--who needs it with SWEET potatoes???! Much better than the usual marshmallow goop. It's a big hit every time. But I think there's a typo in the recipe--2 cups of pecan halves does not equal 8 ounces! I used 8 ounces, which was about a cup.

I've made this recipe for many years at Thanksgiving and it is delectable. I have always used Jack Daniels instead of bourbon (never had bourbon on hand) and it turns out great. Highly recommend this one.

A wonderful dish for any Thanksgiving meal. We used yams and added a bit of molasses. This was a WONDERFUL compliment to the 12 year old scotch injected turkey! WOO WEE! We will definately do this one again!

I made this dish for the first time for Thanksgiving and people went back for seconds! I added fresh orange juice and cinnamon to the puree' which enhanced the flavor without making it too sweet. I would have liked the brown sugar to melt a little into the potatos. I think next time I'll put the brown sugar on first and then the pecans and then heat a higher temp. This dish will definately make an appearance on my table again!

This was SO delicious that the non sweet potato people loved it too. I used Makers Mark and boy you could taste it and it was delicious. As others have said, the pecans were just scrumptious and easy to keep on eating. This is easy and great!

I just prepared this dish for Thanksgiving dinner today, as I did last year. It's only a moderate amount of work for something that is so well received by all. Will definately be part of my Thanksgiving menu in years to come. (I added a little extra brown sugar to the puree, which worked well).

I have made this dish at Thanksgivings past. (I don't cook every year.) It was always a big hit. People who say they don't like sweet potatos always change their mind after tasting these. Be sure to use top shelf bourbon. I will make it again this year. To tinker with the recipe, I might use a bag of Killer Pecans instead of plain ones. If you can get your hands on these spicy, addictive, nuts, DO IT!! If you live in LA, go to Surfas.

So good even my New Orleans Aunt approved and she prides herself on knowing good (the way she would make it) food. Easy to make ahead and pop in the oven for even lower stress on Thanksgiving

My brother-in-law just started eating sweet potatoes when he came to America. He wanted me to fix them a different way. I insisted on this method. He's glad I did. He's normally very generous but he wouldn't let any of our guests take the leftovers home!

This recipe was delicious and easy to make. People who generally don't like Sweet Potatoes just gobbled it up. I added one more tbls of bourbon and two more tbls butter to this recipe though. It is definitely the recipe I will keep in my files for a classic Thanksgiving dinner.

Wow! I've never had such an awesome rendition of sweet potatoes - I'm partial to yams so I used those instead. The bourbon, I also used Canadian whiskey, with the butter makes this dish totally unique. You can play around with the booze, depending on how strong you want it, but you can't really tell what's making the yams taste soooo good.

You may want to make extra pecans and stir them into the puree, as I find that people try to scoop as many as they can off the top...they're that good!

I tripled this recipe for a dinner party and it was excellent. Next time I will try adding a little grated orange rind to the puree.
