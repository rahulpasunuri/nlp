Substituted Yukon Gold's because I had them on hand and used approx 2 Tablespoons of butter and an generous splash of very good local Snowville Creamery cream. Love the coarse texture and flavors of garlic,chive and butter fat!!! Agree with reviewiers that praise simple flavors from great ingredients!!! P.S. this is great with the Grilled Steak and Peppers Vinaigrette from this site and the Hearty Menu

Not as strong tasting as I was expecting, and I had to add a whole lot more salt and pepper in the end to feel like I was eating anything... despite this, still a worthwhile recipe. Just DO NOT skimp on the chives.

Hard to go wrong with a base of potatoes and butter, but we did need to keep throwing garlic salt in to give it some pizazz, even after putting in more than 3 garlic cloves. Next time I will add a little milk or sour cream to give it just a touch more creaminess.

This was a great recipe and I got LOTS of compliments! My garlic was sprouting :( so I subbed garlic powder-- not the same but oh-so-delicious anyway. LOVED it, it stays in my recipe box!

red skin potatoes have more moisture than regular ones so dont need the addition of milk. I use fresh garlic chives-so easy to grow yourself or buy from asian market. I always cut back on the butter but sometimes substitute Trader Joe's Garlic oil for some of the butter. Costco also sells a dried garlic and mediterranean sea salt grinder that goes great with this.

This was a good and easy recipe. I agreed with the suggestions of the other cooks and used garlic salt and 1/4 cup milk, and I also added another 1-2 garlic cloves. My guests loved it!

A nice reminder that good food doesn't have to be complicated. I made this in advance the morning of Thanksgiving and found that it was not easy to reheat on the stove-top and required quite a bit of muscle work. So I suggest reheating this in the microwave or in batches with a liquid, like water leftover from boiling the potatoes. Also, I added the chives when I was ready to serve the potatoes and found it easiest to cut them into the mix using kitchen shears.

I added just a touch of whipping cream to this and some garlic salt in place of salt the second time I made this and I think it was an improvement.

For my "meat and potatoes" husband, this was a wonderful treat. The best Chives in the world are found at Watkinsonline.com. (Yes, that's the old Watkins company with the Vanilla!) Makes a tremendous difference. I have tried fresh and Watkins. Watkins wins.

This was a tasty take on mashed potatoes. I used thinly sliced scallion greens in place of chives, as I could not find any chives in my area (frustrating!), and added a little whole milk (maybe 1/2 cup) to get the potatoes to the consistency I desired. I'll undoubtedly make these again, but not until I can find some chives.

I forgot to mention that I peeled the potatoes used dried chive instead (didn't have fresh)and half-n-half.

I was pleasantly surprised when I made this dish today. My mother (an old-school southener)was smacking her lips. Always nice to get another perspective.

For a first time cook, this was very simple to make! I added half of the butter and a combination of sour cream and 2% milk. My boyfriend is used to his mom's cooking (she is a wonderful cook) and was surprised that I could make something so delicious. Thanks!

I used a couple of friends, in addition to my family, as guinea pigs for this recipe. Our friends took seconds! This recipe is so tasty that it is surprising that it's so easy to make. I served it with Apricot Chicken but I think it would compliment any dish.

Just because there's no milk or cream in these, doesn't make them inferior - it makes them different than what some are used to. So, unless you are one of those people who have a mere handfull of "tried-and-true" recipes, who just keep making the same things over and over - you know, the type of household where family members know what they are having for dinner that night by looking at their desk calendars - then this is worth your time.

Out of this world! For the rater worried that mashed potatoes need milk ... the creaminess of the new potatoes provides the silky texture you're afraid you'll miss. This quick, simple recipe is a new family favorite.

Sorry, I know it annoys some reviewers when we who pipe up haven't made something, but I just wanted to remark that I can't imagine mashed potatoes without some kind of milk in them. For those who didn't think this recipe was great, check out the recipe for "Champ," i.e. Irish Mashed Potatoes. My family worships mashed potatoes, and I thought I had figured out the best way to make them, until I made Champ for St. Pat's and I will never make mashed potatoes any other way. Just add garlic to the recipe.

I absolutly adore mashed potatoes, and this recipe is the best! The chucky yet creamy texture melts in your mouth. This is what home cooking's all about.

This is an easy recipe for yummy potatoes, but to make it a little more healthy I used about half the amount of butter and then added skim milk to achieve the smoothness I wanted. The sour cream idea sounds good too!

This is delicious and healthier if you substitute low-fat chicken broth or veggie broth for the butter. Also, I often use garlic olive oil in my mashed potatoes, again, no butter; it's delicious AND healthier (and preparation is even faster).

This sounds good, but is there a way to get away from the amount of butter being used? Being diet conscience; and new at this, there must be a better way.

To the Durham reader - did you read the first sentence 'cooked for a family of six' and 'streamlined'? This recipe is good for what it is, easy, fast, and a very tasty side dish - (and didn't come out of a pre-packaging). I, too have rediscovered the delights of simplicity, and I defy anyone to dispute the self-evident fact that meal-making does not need to become a 6 hour ritual for it to qualify as 'gourmet'. In my many years of cooking, I have streamlined many recipes, and surprise, surprise, all recipients of the simpler meal have been totally amazed that the dish tasted every bit as good as the stretched out original recipe.

This is a great weeknight dish. It is quick and easy. It is also delicious. A nice change from the usual plain old side of rice. If you are like me and do not like instant mashed potatoes, this is the way to go.

Although quite tasty, it was nothing special and lacked eye appeal. I should have known by the photo, but was looking for an alternative to good old garlic mashed. I didn't care for the appearance of the potato skins at all and thought the texture was oddly mealy, given all the butter. I love potatoes cooked just about any which way, but this recipe didn't please or satisfy. Sorry to be a downer, but this is a mediocre recipe at best.

To the cook from NC that doesn't like "simple" recipes. Get a pig and go search for truffles! Sometimes the simplist of foods i.e. these potatoes become popular and it is good to see how they are cooked. Also, I always enjoy the modifications and changes made by fellow Epicurians. Epicurious - you just keep doin' what you're doin'!

To a Cook from Durham...We can't all be gourmet chefs from the start! I think it's great that recipes of all difficulties are included; after all, if one is frustrated, it is likely one will give up.

I am sorry that I need to rate some "raters" instead of the dish itself. There are plenty of very involved recipes on this site, if that is what suits your fancy. The fact that a recipe is simple does not mean it is a bad one. I can asure you there are Michelin Star chefs that make very simple recipes a work of art. There is a lot to be said about good taste when accompanied by simplicity. On the other hand, you may cook for a week and produce mediocre results. Please stop judging recipes based on the old "if it is hard to make, then it's good" argument. it is a tired one and a wrong one as well. Oh, the recipe: it is simple, easy, quick and good.

There is nothing wrong with this dish, but this is just another in the new wave of non-recipes from Epicurious. Has your audience suddenly shifted to non-cooks?
