I added a few shakes of hot sauce as the previous user recommended. The salad was a little salty, a little sweet, and with just enough spice from the hot sauce. I will definetely make this again.

Yikes, was just boring. I wasn't looking for a mayo based dressing but ended up adding mayo and crushed celery seed just for some flavor.

I have made this recipe 3 times in the past to weeks- everyone in my family loves it. I use red cabbage and add a little kick by throwing in a few dashes of hot sauce.
