Good recipe though I used barracuda, mackerel and blue fish. As mentioned by another reviewer the chowder does taste better the second day after flavors meld together. Very easy to make this recipe.

I am from Bermuda and I can assure you this is not Bermuda Fish Chowder. Don't get me wrong, it sounds like a great "chowder", but it's no Bermuda Fish Chowder. First we would never and I mean never use shellfish nor would we use ever cod! It should be renamed to Seafood Chowder...remove the Bermuda.

I loved this. My house smells wonderful. My tweeks: 5 0z. of precut julienned carrots, used bottled clam juice (3-8oz. bottles of juice) for the fish stock, 4 cups of chicken broth, deleted the water, used the juice and contents from 2 (6.5oz. cans) chopped clams, used the juice and contents from 2 (10oz. cans) of whole clams. Didn't have Sherry Pepper sauce. Used only some hot pepper sauce. Minimized because family members that don't like hot hot flavors. This was wonderful with cheese bread for dipping. This was awesome. Would definitely make again and again.

This is a great recipe! Been making it for years. Made it exactly to the letter the first time and it was a hit with everyone. I sometimes make different substitutions as far as seafood but keep the amount the same with equally impressive results.

Definite crowd pleaser. People had seconds and fought over the leftovers. We left out the shellfish because of allergies, and substituted dry sherry and hot sauce for the special sherry pepper sauce. We used frozen cod, tilapia and haddock. We found fish stock at Loblaws.

Despite the long list of ingredients, this chowder goes together quite easily and cooks unattended for much of the time. Fantastic rich flavors that are so much more complex than typical US chowders, leaving me to wonder at the comments of the cook who claimed to have 'more refined' tastes. We make it all the time, omitting shellfish when serving those who observe kashrut or those with shellfish allergies and it has never ceased to generate rave reviews.

Outstanding, I made it exactly as written and it transported me (more than a decade later) right back to the pink sands of Bermuda

Though my husband liked this, I thought it's a bit overrated. If you like a tomato-rich-worcestershire-rum flavor, you'll probably enjoy it. My tastes are more refined! It wasn't worth going 20 minutes away for the sherry pepper sauce.

The name of the hot sauce most frequently found in Bermunda is Outerbridges Sherry Pepper Sauce. Just Google the name for many sources. The soup is a close match to that found at the many pubs on Bermuda

I am making this now, and it is going to be incredible! Made a few changes...used 4 cups of fish stock, one cup chicken stock, one cup white wine and 2 cups water along with a beef bullion cube. Used red snapper, canned clams and fresh shrimp and added a diced potato. Will serve with hot crusty baguette. Lovely!

Having been to Bermuda every year over the past 20 years, this is terrible! Not even remotely close to what it should taste like. Don't waste the time!

This one is a screamer. After you try that first bite you know what the ratings are all about. Then, if you truly like to cook, you begin to imagine the possibilities that these new flavors have.

Excellent, but felt it was better the next day. Got thicker and more flavorful. Will make it day before next time. Mussels were better than clams, and followed others advice to use regular sherry and Tabasco.

This is some of the best chowder I've ever had, and I've eaten a lot. We've made this several times, with only minor variations, using whatever fresh seafood & shellfish are available in our local market. DELICIOUS!!

I used this at a Superbowl party. This is a great recipe that compared reasonably well to the chowder that was the staple of all restaurants on the island when I lived there. I left out the shrimp and clams as this was never customary on the island and it was still great. I suspect that most recipes in use in Bermuda may use beef stock instead of fish since they have a more beefy flavor than what this recipe yielded. In recommend using the remaining rum with ginger beer to make Dark and Stormy's, another great island tradition.

This dish is spectacular! It's so good that it makes your eyes roll to the back of your head. Holy smokes, we loved it - my husband had 3 servings! Adapting from other reviewers' tips, I made a few modifications which made for a stunning chowder. For the fish stock and water, I used Better than Boullion Lobster Base to make 3 cups, 4 cups water and 3/4 cups sauvingon blanc. And for the Sherry pepper sauce (which I couldn't find in any store), I used 2 tbsp sherry with a few dashes of tobasco. It smelled and tasted so good that we couldn't wait for it to stand 1 hour. I can only imagine how good it must be when you let it sit. This is one of the best dishes that I've ever made. Truly memorable!

Amazing dish - my family could not get enough of it. It seemed to take a very long time to make, well over the 40 minutes, even with a helper to cut everything. Definately worth it, I am making it for Christmas Dinner, two years in a row.

It's good, but I didn't think it lived up to the hype, especially considering the trouble and costs (finding Gosling's Black Seal, Sherry Pepper sauce, etc.) It's a pretty straightforward soup, and the hot sauces, allspice and rum don't really transform it into something magical, just a nice chunky mix of seafood that's got a good heat. I used my own fish broth from snapper heads and frames, which was fun.

This was a truly delicious Saturday night winter supper, with some crusty sesame semolina bread. Thanks to Trader Joe's flash-frozen seafood, it wasn't as much of an extravagance as some have suggested. Since husband dislikes clams, I left those out, and used a combo of cod, tilapia, mahi mahi filets, and rock shrimp. To make up for the missing clams, I upped the fish filets by another half pound. For the fish stock, I used Better Than Bouillion's Lobster base, which has been excellent as a starter for lobster bisque. And, as I no longer had any sherry pepper sauce on hand, improvsed at the finish with a combo of sherry, angostura bitters, and tabasco. This recipe makes much more than the stated 12 cups. At least 4 quarts.

Awesome simply does not begin to describe this dish. I served this to several friends Monday night and they LOVED it. One guy couldn't tear himself away and finally scraped the remains out of the pot. I used about 3 1/2 cups fish stock, 4 cups water and 1/2 cup white wine, but otherwise followed the recipe. (OK - was running behind and maybe didn't let it steep the full hour.) Frankly, I just couldn't hold off the admiring crowd any longer. Will definitely make again and again.

Halved this recipe and used freshly caught tuna, frozen shrimp, scallops and squid. Didn't have leeks so used extra onion. Didn't have green pepper so used red. Didn't have dark rum so used Bacardi's. Didn't have sherry pepper sauce so used sherry and Tabasco. Even with all these substitutions, it came out GREAT! My husband love it. Will definitely make this one again.

This was a huge hit! I made this with some fresh grouper that my brother-in-law caught. I doubled the clams and I didn't have time to find the sherry pepper sauce so I used a caribbean hot sauce instead. I will be definately be making this dish again.

Forget Manhattan and New England. This is it. I made it with fish stock instead of water. Don't like green pepper, so used red and sprinkled on chopped parsley before serving. Will make frequently.

This recipe is fabulous. I've made it several times. I've subsituted vegetable stock for the water once and canned clams for the for the ones in shells and it's still great! Using the stock made it a more hearty chowder.

This was really good. I used Cod, shrimp, and clams since that is what I had available-I think a greater variety would be nice. I agree that the sherry pepper sauce adds a lot to the chowder. The fish got a bit soft for my preference-I don't think I'd simmer as long next time. I think it will be a fun recipe to play around with if you have the time-a good recipe for a lazy Sunday.

Made this for Christmas Eve with assorted seafood:black cod, ling cod, side stripes and scallops. Used our own canned fish stock made from salmon. No sherry pepper but substituted sherry and hot pepper sauce. Everyone raved, had seconds, and thirds!

This ranks among the best recipes I've tried from this site. I patiently waited to make it until my sherry pepper sauce order arrived from Outerbridges.com and the sauce was worth the wait. The chowder is a bit pricey but worth every penny.

Made adjustments due to lack of ingredients but with good results: made shrimp instead of fish stock, in place of tomatoes & paste subbed with Rotel w/ Green Chilies, used grouper and shrimp but should have added to soup last 15 min to keep seafood from getting tough (as previously suggested). Ordered sherry pepper sauce for next time (drhot.net). Try it! It's delicious!

It's still on the stove so this may be premature... But it looks, smells and tastes wonderful. I wish I had read the reviews beforehand-- omitting the water and replacing it with fish stock would have been nice. Can't wait to eat it (it's almost ready).

My wife and I went to Bermuda on our honeymoon almost 10 years ago. We still remember the fish chowder from the Hog Penny Pub ... by far the best fish chowder on the island. This recipe took us back to that special place! WONDERFUL!!

I've made this recipe more than a half dozen times...it never disappoints..it's perhaps the best and most unique chowder, I've had. The sherry pepper sauce is a "must" and is available at outerbridges.com. I use 8 cups of homeade fish stock and omit the five cups of water...I also believe a good chowder needs corn...so I use fresh sweet corn cut right off the husks... You can follow this basic recipe and use whatever fresh shellfish (including lobster) is abundant at the time, just don't overcook, I usually add shellfish during the last fifteen minutes, as it will continue to cook after the heat is off.

This is fantastic. I substituted mussels for the clams because mussels are much easier to find on the east coast of this province. In fact, this is just the recipe I've been looking for to serve to mainland guests. Everything, including the rum, is indicative of Newfoundland cuisine. I ordered the sherry pepper sauce from Outerbridge's on the Internet. Wow!

great tasting chowder I shelled shrimp wrapped them in cheese cloth like the spices but seperately, cooked in broth for 30 minutes and took them out it adds a terffic shrimp stock @ the same time

This was the best chowder recipe ever! Although I was unable to find sherry pepper sauce I can't imagine anything making this chowder any better. It was superb!

Yummy!! You need to be willing to put in the time, but it is definitely worth it. We didn't have the Sherry Pepper Sauce and would love to know where to buy.

I've tried many different chowder recipes and was very impressed at how easy and how well this recipe came out. I even tried it without the rum and the sherry pepper and thought it tasted great. Next time I'll add the rum and sherry and see what happens!

I had a grand time trying this recipe. As we live on the Gulf of Mexico and do a good bit of fishing we are constantly in search of THE chowder recipe. With this one, the search has ended. It was well worth the time and money to restock our Outerbridges supplies there really is no adequate substitute for their sherry pepper sauce. We also added some of their rum sherry pepper sauce and it just made a very good thing even better. By the way, this is traditional Bermuda chowder to the point that it does taste better the longer it ages. Unfortunately, I've had a hard time trying to age it--it just gets eaten too quickly!

i was a little apprehensive about making such a detailed dish, however, since i honeymooned in bermuda, i had a chance to try the original and loved it! i made it shortly after our 1st anniversary with freshly caught bluefish and striped bass. i substituted canned clams for fresh as my market was out of them. the rum adds a wonderful sweetness to the broth . i happened to have the sherry peppers sauce and will try it on the chowder tomorrow. my husband can't believe how good it is. and my fisherman will have his tomorrow. i know i will probably end up making another pot, as it will go fast! ps- had fish chowder at the frog and onion pub in bermuda at the royal naval dockyard and it does not compare to this one!

I like your recipes, but why don't you also mention european weights and measures. Like kilo's grams liters degrees celsius instead of just cups and pints and fahrenheit? greetings willemijnijn
