I loved it as is, but it was a bit thin. The next time I made it, I added cooked chicken strips and some fresh Hawaiian pineapple - mmmmm....

WAY too much peanut butter. I wanted to like this soup so much, but it was a real let-down. If I ever make this again I might try it with half the amount of peanut butter.

Excellent combination of flavors. This was a huge hit at a wine dinner -- we served it with a zinfandel (red). I didn't make any changes.

Great soup, though very heavy and rich. If using as an appetizer, use very small bowls.

Oops - forgot to add that I obviously ommitted the rice and I also left out the sugar - the addition of sweet potato is enough. 3 large diced, seeded and skinned tomatoes were added too.

I admit, I did deviate from the recipe somewhat based on comments from other reviewers - please don't hate me. But my boyfriend said it was his favourite soup of all the ones I've made....so I thought I better review it. I added some fresh ginger and a whole diced sweet potato. I pureed half of the soup at the end and garnished with cilantro. Enjoy!

My husband nor I liked this soup at all and he loves peanut butter. If there were a no fork rating that's what I would give it. It might be better with a lot less peanut butter. I'm not so sure about even that.

What an absolute explosion of flavor! I was in absolute shock when I first tasted it. I added the sweet potatos as a member had said - it was a wonderful addition! I used 100% natural peanut butter. And added lots more curry about 2Tbs more. After it was cooked, I threw the soup into a food processor and pureed it. It was a hit with my friend, she couldn't get over how wonderful it tasted.

For some reason I wanted to make chicken skewers and dip them in this soup. It had a good flavor but I had just about 4 cups of the chicken stock which made for a very thick, dip-like soup. Next time I'll definately add more chicken stock.

This was an amazing soup. I ended up modifying the recipe by peeling and cutting a sweet potato and small butternut squash into small pieces and added it in with the rice and carrots. I also extended the cooking time to about 40 minutes total. I will definitely be using this recipe in the future.

I am enjoying this WONDERFUL soup as I type. I crushed some whole peanuts to sprinkle on top which gave the soup a good crunch. I will definatly make this around Christmas time for guests. Will compensate for the peanuts with less peanut-butter maybe try the coconut milk. Thanks for all the tips.

My boyfriend was in heaven! Thanks to the reviewers below...I added red curry paste and a little pepper flake and about a 1/4 cup coconut milk. A few pieces of shrimp would dress this up nicely. We'll be making this soup again!

This was unbelievably delicious! It was wonderful as is and quite easy. I ran out of regular curry powder so used about 1/3 red curry, which added a bit more heat that was just right. Be sure to add the cilantro and green onion garnish as they topped it off just right.

This was delicious but so rich! I added a chopped red chile and served with a dollop of plain yogurt as others suggested and it was so good. I don't have a processor so I didn't puree at all and it was still great. Next time I'll probably add coconut milk and red pepper.

Very nice soup, but it can be improved. My suggestions: toss in a few hot red chilis with the onions, add a bit less broth and compensate for it with a can of coconut milk during the pureeing process, and puree the entire batch rather than just half. Wow! Kicks butt accompanied by a nice big glass of Shiraz.

To the person who doesn't like curry: Omit the curry and use ground red pepper for a spicy flavor.

One of my favorites. A very satisfying meal in itself.Of course, I'm a peanut butter lover. Add more sugar if the curry gets too spicy.

Fantastic soup. Be sure to top with scallion, as it really enhances the overall flavor. Also, I topped mine with a little dollop of plain yoghurt, so as to bring out the flavor and give a good presentation to the dish. If you're worried about fat content, you can easily reduce the amount of peanut butter and still get a very rich and delicous sauce. I think anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 cup of peanut butter will do the trick.
