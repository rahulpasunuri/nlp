I find this a good starting point for a party enchilada recipe -- I make it in a larger dish and add bunches of cilantro and a lot more cheese. I also added chipotle chiles to the sauce and nixed the vinegar and bread crumbs. It has been a big hit every time I make it!

This sauce was really quite strange. Something about bread crumbs and vinegar. It was at once soupy and strangely textured...grainey. And red chiles are sharp enough flavored to not need vinegar. I think I'll stick with a good, hard-to-screw up, Chile Colorado when I'm making red enchiladas from now on.

I loved the sauce in this recipe. I did add about two teaspoons sugar to the sauce. Next time I make this recipe I will roll the enchiladas instead of using the stacking method. I love no meat dishes, but meat could be added easily to the recipe, especially if you rolled the tortilla. I think the sauce makes this recipe.

I'm sorry to be so negative, but this recipe realy let me down. First of all, it was a soupy mess. Apparently the enchilada sauce (which did have good flavor) should be cooked down more than indicated by the recipe. We also thought the enchiladas were much too onion-y and that the black olives didn't work well in the dish. I'd give this recipe less than one fork if I could.
