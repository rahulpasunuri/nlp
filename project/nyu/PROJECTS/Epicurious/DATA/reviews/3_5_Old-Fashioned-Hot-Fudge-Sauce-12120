Best fudge recipe I've ever made and so easy to make. Delicious with ice cream or a dip for strawberries. I'm still amazed that using only 2oz of chocolate could result in such a delicious fudge.

This was amazing! Kept it's thick and chewy texture on cold ice cream. Yum yum yum. My family went crazy for it. Great on bananas! :) Worth having corn syrup in the house for.

I never got to actually taste it on ice cream because it was eaten up before then. It's also very good if you eat it from a jar. Be careful though if you reheat it. You must let it naturally come to room temperature before you stick it in the refridgerator or else it becomes grainy (I think it's something to do with the sugar molecules). I will assume it tastes excellent on ice cream though.

I made this for a party and used it as a fondue sauce. I find most chocolate fondue recipes taste like chocolate syrup and I wanted something richer. This was perfect for dipping pound cake cubes and mini ice cream balls. It was a huge hit.

I had to make this twice! The first time I was surrounded by family members with spoons. It didn't make it to the ice cream! Best hot fudge ever.

I've made this several times, both as gifts, and for my family. It is always a hit. And it is very simple to make.

I made this for christmas gifts and ate an entire jar myself. It's absolutely fabulous, even without the salt. It's easy easy easy and is heavenly on poundcake, on ice cream, or on the edge of a shortbread recipe. I've found my hot fudge recipe!!

I don't know what went wrong but after 8 minutes it was burned tasting and turned to rock after a few minutes.

This is one of the best hot fudge sauce recipes I've even made. Years ago, I worked at Inverness Country Club and they were reknown for their signature dessert, The Hot Fudge Nut Ball. (French vanilla ice cream rolled in toasted pecans, place in a champagne glass and drenched in hot fudge........ a dessert to die for. This hot fudge recipe is the closest I've found to being there. Enjoy!!!!

This is an excellent hot fudge sauce and very simple to make. I makes a wonderful sundae. Stores in the refrigerator well and reheats well in the microwave (30 seconds on high). A definite hit for a chocolate lovers.
