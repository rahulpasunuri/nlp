This is Fantastic! Will definitely make it again. Complex, but actually easy. 15-year-old loved it, but would like less honey. Adjust to 1/2 TBSP. Also, I didn't have cinnamon sticks, so I used about 1 tsp Vietnamese ground cinnamon. Served with couscous and tarragon green beans. More, please! 6-7-12

This is one of my favorite weeknight dinners. I serve it with white rice, which is excellent with some of the extra orange sauce, and a chopped greek salad with cucumber, feta, red pepper, onion and olives. My friends ask for 'orange juice chicken' all the time!

Easy recipe. Excellent with saffron-scented cous-cous

We loved this recipe. It was easy to prep ahead of time, so I could whip it together as my husband was serving the salad, cooked it after the salad was eaten. Doubled the sauce as many said. Delicious, simple, and tasted more complex than it was. I served it with Fragrant Rice Pilaf and roasted (grilled) asparagus to rave reviews.

This was great! Easy to prepare and soo impressive for the little effort. Be warned; if you do this indoors, there will be a LOT of smoke. Perhaps better for the barbecue. L emon and Olive Cous Cous is the perfect accompaniment.

Made this on the George Foreman grill several times and even the kids liked it. I like it in the winter when I can't get outside to grill.

This was excellent. The aroma from the spiced oil was wonderful, it was easy to make. I will definately make this again.

I've made this dish part of my regular dinner rotation. The flavor is wonderful. I frequently use 4-5 chicken tenderloins instead of breasts and don't ever pound out the meat. I reduce the thickness of the chicken pieces by simply cutting them in half. Certainly double the sauce.

Easy, and full of impressive flavors. Was not quite enough sauce though. I would consider using more orange juice, honey, etc.

I love spicy ethnic foods but found this to be disappointing. It's such a long time since I have made a sauce with so much butter and the spiced oil was excessive. Even my teenagers asked if there was butter in the sauce and both said the dish was OK but don't make it again. There are better recipes with fresher flavors.

I made this last night, we gave it 3 1/2 forks. So easy and so good, just loved the cinnamon flavor in the sauce. Served it couscous with toasted almonds and raisins.

Made this into tasty drumsticks cooked on BBQ; used all the spiced oil to baste and just served the strained sweet/spicy sauce seperately, did not add any of the spicy oil to it; still a good dressing for the spiced drumsticks. Takes about 20 minutes on the BBQ for medium drumsticks at medium heat, turning once. Not too spicy and the hot/sweet/tang is a good mix.

This was easy to prepare (we used a grill), and I liked the flavors, although I would like them to be a bit stronder next time, so I'd second the other reviewer's comments about doubling the sauce. I'd double the oil and really season the chicken thoroughly (I went a bit light this time because I was unsure of the strength and to make sure enough was left for the sauce). It was a crowd pleaser.

This is a great recipe. We love it. After reading the reviews here is how I would make it from now on. Double the sauce. Double the making of the seasoned oil. Remove much of the seasoned oil from that pan, leaving enough oil to cook the ckicken in that pan. I see no need to grill. When chicken is done, remove and tent with foil. Add sauce, unstrained but with cinnamon stick removed, to the pan. Bring to a boil. I used rice that ia seasoned with olives and parsley. It was a great meal.

I'm a college grad just getting into cooking..trying to go beyond speghetti and hot dogs :) This dish was quick and easy. I was so excited that it was actually going well that I forgot to cook anything else with it! Next time I think I may add asparagus, mushrooms and scallions and throw it over some pasta with a little more sauce. I also didn't have any sticks of cinnamin and had to use crushed...I'm sure the flavor will be more subtle with a stick but it was great none the less!

One pounded chicken breast with this seasoning packs a lot of flavor and value. I combined the sauce with cooked couscous (1/3 c.) and placed the chicken on top of it and surrounded it with grilled eggplant, zucchini and asparagus and served it with a green salad with bleu cheese. The amount of pepper flakes does not produce a fiery result. My husband did not care for the sweet taste, so the next time I will not make the sauce but will use the flattened breast with the same seasoning on chicken sandwiches. This easy to prepare dish is a budget stretcher.

i used blood oranges and the flavor was wonderfully complex

Delicious! The recipe makes the preparation of this dish sound more confusing than it is. In reality it's quick, easy, and very tasty. My recommendations: double the sauce, serve with the cous cous with olives and lemon recipe from this site; roasted sweet potatoes made a good side.

This was a fast dish that my kids enjoyed. I was not inspired by it, not enough fresh flavor for my liking, but it was fast and easy. Maybe a final splash of lemon on the chicken before pulling it off the griddle...

I made this again (with double the sauce and half the chicken) and instead of pouring the sauce through a sieve, I just picked out the cinnamon stick. This made the sauce spicier because more of the pepper flakes made it into the sauce. I also used more lemon juice than called for, because once you squeeze a lemon, why not throw in all of the juice? So it was less sweet. I think I'll try deglazing the grill pan next time too.

After reading the 'controversy' surrounding the amount of sauce and spices best to make for this dish to be optimum, I followed popular opinion and increased measurements on both. I had 2 lbs of chicken and the recipe called for 1 3/4, so quadrupled both sauce and spice mixtures as a few had suggested. Doing so only made one cup of sauce vs. the original 1/4 cup. So I would recommend doing the same. The only change I made (that no one else mentioned) was that the sauce was just a bit too thin, so at the end I added a bit of arrowroot (or cornstarch will do of course) to thicken it, and it made it a nicer consistency. I also poured it into the same pan that the chicken had grilled in to deglaze all the seasonings on the bottom of pan (from the spiced oil on the chicken) and to pick them up into the sauce. I did not want to lose all the flavor of those spices after hearing so many complain that the final flavor didn't have as much punch as the aromas had during the cooking process. (It also helped for easy clean up!) I did not find the sauce sweet b/c the hot pepper and lemon balanced it out. It was a lovely yellow-orange color from the addition of the paprika and would be great with rice on the side. Unfortunately, this wording/organization of the written recipe made it seem much more complicated than it actually was. I mention this only in case someone else is put off by the directions. It's really very easy AFTER you take a little time to decipher it. It's not your same-old-same-old chicken.

Very tasty and easy once you read it through. (I wish someone had told me to be really careful to not burn the spices, but it was easy enough to make a new batch.) I, also, will punch up the flavors next time, and I like the idea of marinating in the spiced oil. Definitely worth trying!

I've made this twice: once exactly according to recipe and once "my way." On their version ... The spiciness on the chicken is seriously subtle -- especially in comparison to how it smells when you are cooking it. I think that's the source of many readers' disappointment. The sauce is awfully sweet. But the chicken turns out deliciously juicy. On my version ... 1) Double the spices in the oil and marinate the chicken breasts in the oil overnight. 2) Instead of orange juice and honey, use good sherry as the base of your sauce. Adds new dimensions of flavor and tones down without doing away with the sweetness. Also, triple the red chile flakes in the sauce's first step. And I thought the lemon-olive couscous was good. Hit it with a little olive oil at the end if you find it too dry! Two forks for their version; three forks for mine!

This dish, for the time, is superb. Made it three times now, and twice for other people who are still talking about it. I wonder, how hard is it, for those short of sauce, to make some more? Seriously - I am a sauce freak and have had enough each time. Just... make... more... sauce...

My husband and I also loved this recipe and thought it paired well with the 'Couscous with Olives and Lemon'. I made the sauce with the specified quantities, but with not quite 1 pound of chicken. There was just barely enough sauce. So you really do have to double the sauce and if you want more, triple or quadruple it. Just a comment on spices - make sure they are fresh or your dish will be bland.

My husband and I actually loved this recipe! We served it with the "matching" Couscous with Olives and Lemon (there doesn't seem to be a link in this recipe but you can find it via site search). The sauce is delicious over the couscous, which we made with Kalamata olives and extra parsely and lemon. If you like lots of sauce, I agree with others that doubling it is a good idea, and if you like more/other spices, there are some good suggestions below.

Good, but not great; its best feature is that it is very quick and easy. I made a full recipe of sauce for a single chicken breast and that was addequate but not overwhelming. I'd recommend doubling, even quad-ing the sauce, esp. if you want to serve it over rice, etc.

I doubled the sauce and actually used small thin boneless porkchops we already had on hand. It was very good but perhaps the amount of oil would have been too little for chicken breasts hammered flat.. very good and quick

This begs for a dollop of harissa to finish it. There are many recipes in the Epicurious collection for this fabulous Moroccan condiment.

Very disappointing lack of flavor. I did follow the recipe as directed. Blah and would not even attempt to fix this one. Forget it.

This was very good-- I doubled the sauce, added a bit more cumin and hot pepper as we like spicy. Im saving the left over sauce to use on steamed carrots as I think that would be good, maybe with some raisins or fruit added.

Can you make this dish w/out a grill pan? A saute pan is the best I could do

The oil becomes spiced once you follow the directions, it isn't a prepared oil.

This recipe intrigues me, and I would love to try it. However, there is much mention of the "spiced oil", but I have been unable to discover what type of spiced oil is recommended. Can someone fill me in?

Absolutely fabulous!! and yes, very quick. I loved it! I did double the sauce, doubling the spices was a waste because I realized it's only used to season the pan and oil brush the chicken. This recipe is a keeper. I even passed it around to my friends.

Excellent. Improve the flavor of any chicken dish by using kosher chicken which is treated by using course salt (to draw out the blood) - then rinsed. It retains just enough salt to give a major flavor boost.

Used pre-sliced packaged turkey breast with great success. They're uniformly sliced to the correct thickness, cost less than sliced chicken breast, and grill beautifully. The spiced oil prevents drying. Just be sure they're not overcooked. The sauce is absolutely necessary.

The litmus test in my house for a recipe is leftovers. This dinner was inhaled, and I didn't get to have leftovers for lunch. I flattend the chicken with a mallet... very thin. I served it with the cous cous as suggested, and also eggplant kuku.

Great flavors, but there was neither enough of the spice mixture nor the sauce. I'd recommend making more of each. Given the mediocre reviews of the olive-lemon couscous it's paired with in the magazine, I opted for the pine nut-green onion-raisin couscous on this site and it was a great complement.

These were very nice. Thought it was an easy dish with a different sort of flavor. The only change I made was to pound out the breasts instead of cutting them in half.

This is a really elegant and simple dish. It pairs very well with the lemon and olive couscous in the same issue. Both my wife and I were very pleased -- though I am not sure it is the simple weeknight dinner it was claimed to be. It is difficult to make boneless skinless chicken breasts taste very good, but this recipe comes through. The sauce and the spiced oil work well together. They also work well with the couscous. I would definitely recommend this for a nice family dinner.
