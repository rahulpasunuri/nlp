Good basic recipe. Can use different temperatures, just check often to make sure they're not getting too brown. At 42F, 1st side ready in 20 mins and 2nd side about 10 mins. Add pepper!

Really good, I probably use twice the garlic as is listed. Never any leftovers.

Very tasty. Used the higher heat setting recommended by one of the other reviewers - remember to adjust your time accordingly. Will definitely make this again.

oops... I pour that over the potatoes and put them on a paper towl to drain the excess. A lot of work for roasted potatoes. Maybe I will let the olive oil and garlic stand for a few hours before roasting next time.

The garlic flavor on these potatoes was a little weak. Which might have been okay but I served it with the thought that the side would provide a rich hardy garlicy base to the meal. Luckily, I also roasted some whole cloves along with the potatoes. I took the olive oil that was at the bottom of the pan and mixed it with the minced roasted cloves. I pour

A great, simple side dish. I give it 4 forks for it's simplicity and ease, and of course, b/c it tastes delicious! I always make this side with steaks. We are garlic lovers so I add more garlic. The kosher salt def. makes a differece.

This recipe was OK, but really not interesting enough to make again. We ended up dipping the potatoes in ketchup--kind of a baked French fry thing.

This was easy to make, relatively healthy if its not carbs you're counting, delicious and made the house wonderfully fragrant. We will make this again often, though I will try the suggestion of a higher oven temp for a crispier potato. I may try red potatoes too. We loved this!

I was worried about the simplicity of this recipe, but it smelled so delicious when it was roasting and was even better to taste that it was a nice surprise. I will certainly be making this dish again.

Roasting the potatoes at a higher temperature (as the previous cook suggested) does yield a crispier potato. I peel the garlic cloves, but leave them whole so the don't burn and turn bitter. Leaving the skins on is fine and a lot less work. Also works well with Red Bliss potatoes. I throw in a little butter at the end for taste.

This is a very nice dish. Whenever I roast potatoes, I like to raise the temperature to 425-450 degrees, depending on how many potatoes I am doing as I find I have better results with the end product. This makes the potatoes have a great crispy outside with a smooth, melt in your mouth interior.

Easy & delicious! We served this on Mother's Day and got rave reviews. The only suggestion as the previous reviewer recommends, is to turn on the broiler for a minute to get the browning complete. Next time we make this recipe, we'll try leaving the skins on the potatoes for a more rustic taste.

Very easy and tasty. I turned on the broiler for the last 5 minutes to get a crusty top.

In preparing this recipe with friends, I think we may have done a disservice by using a whole 5-lb bag of potatoes, just over the amount called for in the recipe. The potatoes never seemed to crisp enough, and certainly looked nothing like the pictures in Gourmet. I also found that the flavor suffered dramatically when reheated with leftovers two days later.

This was delicious and easy.
