Very good, I recommend adding some sriracha to the marinade and grilling 5 minutes a side on low heat. The slaw was tasty, but nothing special. Overall though, a delicious, easy meal

I was a little worried when I made it as it seemed underdressed but the taste was incredible. I didn't have red jalapeno so I used green and added some sweet red bell pepper for colour.

this was a huge hit at our house. Will definately make again. Loved the slaw and the steak had great flavor.

This was excellent. I substitued sesame oil for 1 of the 5 tbsp of oil in the marinade and used a porterouse instead of flank steak. Our jalapenos were large and very hot so I only used one and chopped it instead of slicing it. We like heat but I can't imagine eating a whole slice in one bite. It was amazing, my husband does not normally like slaw and he had seconds. I might add some carrot next time for more color.

Pretty good flavor but would have been much better if the cabbage was crispy. If I was to make it again, I would add sesame oil, ginger and garlic chili sauce to give it a truer asian flavor.

Steak was delicious. I substituted sesame oil for part of the vegetable oil because I love the flavor. The slaw was fine but didn't wow me. If I made it again, I think I'd use a purchased broccoli slaw mix, as other reviewers have done, for a little variation in flavor and texture.

Rating: 3
Super easy and tasty! Made the slaw with 2tbs of agave nectar instead of sugar. Also forgot the fresh Ginger on the slaw so dashed in some powdered. Worked well. For a try, added some thinly sliced mango on top of slaw when plated. Gave it something extra although I liked the slaw just fine without.

Rating: 4
Ended up marinating the steak and slaw for two days, so I was a little worried about how it would turn out. But it was so amazingly tender, so flavourful. The slaw held up perfectly too, because I used broccoli slaw instead of napa cabbage, so it didn't get soggy at all as I imagine cabbage would. Boyfriend loved the slaw, though I think it could have used something extra...

This was fantastic - I have made the slaw for other dishes as well. It has a better flavor after a day.

Very nice, simple dinner. Perfect for a warm summer evening. Quick and easy to prepare. I think the slaw needed a little something extra. Maybe it would have been better if is sat for a while longer marinating.

Super easy and you mostly have all the ingredients on hand. I marinated for about 6 hours. Served with a different Asian slaw from this site (served the leftovers on baguettes with that slaw and some basil--yum!). This will be a standard, go-to grilling recipe.

made this for the whole family. Had to use green jalapenos. Take the ribs and seeds out before adding to the vinegar mixture. Strain the chunks out before adding to the slaw and a 3 and 4 year old will eat everything on the plate!

Don't grill much and this was easy. Used green jalapeños without a problem. Loved the contrast with the sweet slaw. Great meal.

Loved this! No red jalapenos here so used green - far too hot for us (and I love hot food.) We took the jalapenos out and really enjoyed the slaw - nice combo of tart and spicy. No Napa cabbage in the store today either so used purple cabbage - lovely and tasty. The flank steak was great and very easy.

Excellent. We broiled the steak as the grill was unavailable and added cilantro to the slaw which added to the freshness. Highly recommended.

This was excellent. Simple and delicious. I prepared the cole slaw and marinated the steak the night before. Turned out perfectly. I doubled the entire recipe and substituted 2 packages "broccoli slaw" for the napa cabbage. I also was unable to find red jalepenos, so used one green instead. Just the right level of spice. There's four of us, and we were left with only one leftover serving (which was delicious for lunch). Served it with couscous cooked in beef broth and mushrooms to round out the flavors. Worked really well together.

The whole family liked this. I marinated it for about 2 hours and added more garlic and ginger to the marinade. Based on others suggestions I added red pepper, red cabbage and shredded carrots to the slaw which was delicious.

I made this steak following the recipe exactly and it was fabulous. I cooked on the grill, 5 minutes per side. We will definitely make this again and again. I will say that the sauce made from the leftover marinade didn't work - the ginger burned too quickly (more likely that I didn't watch it closely enough). But I did drizzle the oil from the sauce which added a nice flavor. I also used EVOO instead of veg oil, and added a splash of dark sesame oil too. Lastly, I tweaked the slaw to include some julienned red pepper and chopped cilantro. And I used honey instead of sugar in the same amounts. The slaw was only so-so - not sure I'd bother to make it again.

I've made this several times now. It's good hot or cold (Hollywood Bowl picnic) Like others, I increased the garlic & ginger, marinated the steak overnight and made the coleslaw the previous day. Fabulous, just fabulous!

Excellent dish, very easy and simple to make. I was unable to find a red jalapeno, so I used one green jalapeno. I also let the steak sit in the marinade for about an hour. I grilled the steak for 6 minutes on each side, it came out perfect. I would definitely recommend this dish

Rating: 4
Made this tonight. Was great. Used green jalapenos instead of red, mostly because i couldn't find red ones. I think the recipe can do fine with just the 1 pepper. My wife and I love hot food, but i think one jalapeno would have made this the perfect amount of heat.

Excellent beef! So flavorul. We used our new charcoal grill to make this and the edges got nice and crispy - absolutely delicious. Followed the recipe to a 't' with the exception of a splash of sesame oil I threw into the slaw. The slaw was a great accompiamant. Suprisgling good for so few ingredients. Will definately make agian.

This recipe is a hit with everybody. I have been asked to repeat it several times and the slaw is awesome! Thanks!

Everyone loved this meal. The recipe is very easy. The steak was so tender and flavorful. I could not find fresh red jalapenos in my area, so I used some from a jar. Glad I did not omit them, as they add a much needed kick to the slaw. I will make this slaw again as a stand alone. It was delicious. I chopped the onions, then forgot to add them at the end. They weren't missed. Cooked the steak 3 min a side, turning 3 times. Perfection!

Made this following the directions (except that I broil the flank steak because of the weather) and it was a big hit with the family. The marinade is not too overpowering for the children. The slaw was especially good. I will definitely use the dressing again and might add a few more veggies to the slaw (like carrots and peppers). It came together quite easily.

This is an excellent dish. The marinade gave the flank a wonderful taste and extremely tender. We were not that wild about the slaw, but will definitely try again.

The steak was great and we loved the taste of the slaw. We purchased Napa cabbage at a specialty grocery store and when we got it home, we discovered that it had many small black spots on the midribs (pepper spot). After a quick search on the internet, we went back to a different store for a small head of local cabbage. So, if you're buying Napa cabbage, I would suggest that you take a quick peek inside to check for spots before purchasing.

I was looking for a quick (little marinating time) recipe for flank steak and happened to have all of the ingredients on hand to make this. My husband and I loved it and will definitely include it in our rotation of "go-to" weeknight recipes. I found it was great as leftovers too.

I made this for cadets on a sponser sunday and it was so easy and well received that I made it for a family reunion...19 pounds of deliciousness and credit for a lot of work I didn't have to do! I would make the slaw the night before, it has more flavor when it sits.

Holy smokes was this good - a definite and enthusiastic four forks. My expectations were high with all the great reviews and both the steak and slaw did not disappoint. For the steak, I doubled the ginger, tripled the garlic and marinated overnight. Incredibly tender and delicious. Went heavy on the ginger for the slaw too and used the spicy chili-garlic sauce I had on hand instead of the jalapenos. Even my husband who can't stand slaw had a second helping. Made it mid- week but this will definitely be served to guests. Try this, you'll be glad you did.

I made this tasty dish for a festival/camping weekend with dear friends. We liked it - I was even asked to share the recipe. I did make a few subs due to traveling. I substituted standard chopped slaw for the napa and also added garlic to the slaw along with the ginger. I made the slaw dressing the night before. I also began marinating the beef the night before - it was a snap on the grill.

I made this dish for a festival/camping weekend with dear friends - it was very tasty and very easy. I was even requested to give the recipe! I did make a few modifications - for ease of use traveling with a cooler, I used standard pre-chopped slaw instead of the Napa cabbage. I also love garlic (okay I actually mistakenly chopped the garlic and ginger together in my food processor) and thus added a measure of garlic to the slaw as well. I made the slaw dressing and began marinating the steak 24 hours in advance - the dressing kept well and the meat was very tender.

Rating: 4
YUMM. Super easy. Market didn't have flank so I made it with skirt steak, which was delicious. Like other reviewers, didn't have red jalapenos so used 2 teaspoons of sriracha...i must have burned off all my taste buds because could have been a touch spicier for my taste.

I don't just dole out "four forks" but I must on this recipe. I've made it many times now because it's a very high return on investment in terms of taste and healthiness, for the effort expended. Friends request it when I am cooking and also want the recipe for themselves. I too added sesame oil to the dressing, red peppers to add color, and use chili garlic paste in place of the red jalapenos.

This is certainly an exceptional recipe. It's so very easy to do and so very delicious. I just made it for the first time for our barbecue season inaugural. I kept pretty much to the recipe, just using slivered red pepper, soy sauce, sesame oil and a few drops of Tabasco for the salad dressing and leaving out the jalapenos. Don't miss this week night wonder.

My husband LOVED the marinade, but we put it on chicken rather than steak. The slaw was tasty, but I think I'll make it without the jalapenos next time. The slaw had enough flavor without them, and it seemed to confuse the dish.

This was my 1st time grilling a flank steak. It came out very tender, but lacked flavour. I even marinated it for 5 hours longer than suggested. The slaw was delicious. Watch the amount of jalepenos you put in. 1 large green one, with the seeds, gave it a HUGE bite. Would make again, but would work on making the marinade stand out more.

I made this for a party of 20 guests for a late summer meal in the mountains. I doubled the marinade and tripled the amount of meat. I also marinated the steak for 6 hours and enjoyed the rest of the afternoon. It was listed as part of a menu with Asian slaw and a goat cheese salad. Fabulous! Everyone raved and everything could be made ahead. I just pulled everything out of the refrigerator an hour before the party to let it get to room temperature. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe is amazing. I invited friends over for dinner this evening along with my picky teenage children, doubled the receipe, and held my breathe. There was not a scrap left.

This was a delicious recipe, but I did make a couple adjustments. One was to marinade the meat, like others suggested for longer (I'm also a ginger fiend so I doubled the amount in the marinade as well). The other modification was to add some mayo to the slaw- I don't know if I got especially spicy red jalapenos, but the slaw was so hot you couldn't taste any of the other ingredients and I consider myself a "spicy-food-person." A little bit of mayo went a long way in cutting though the spiciness though, and really brought out the vinegar and ginger flavors. Will definitely make again, with my minor adjustments.

Made this for a quick dinner omitting the slaw.However, I marinated the meat for about three hours to allow the steak to absorb the flavors of the marinade. Also broiled it for about five minutes per side instead of grilling it. Everybody loved it. Cooked extra and made a beef salad with it the following day adding scallions, julienned carrots, snow peas, red pepper strips and made a soy/sesame dressing. Quick, easy and a keeper.

This was awesome. Really quick to make and great flavor. I made with an "Asian" slaw (it's on epicurious somewhere!) which was just cabbage, carrots and a little red bell pepper tossed with rice wine vinegar, a bit of sesame oil and a TBSP of sugar. A delicious and fairly healthy meal was had by all!

Surprised this had so much flavor after a thirty minute marinade. In fact, I thought it was a bit salty, so I am going to reduce the soy sauce by a tablespoon next time. I think I will increase ginger. This went together fast and easy so is perfect for a weeknight, yet would be great for company. It would be compatible with all kinds of side dishes.

Great light meal. I used red cabbage and some grated carrot. I only used one green jalapeno and fished it out of the dressing before pouring on slaw and it was still spicy enough for us.

The beau wasn't initially thrilled when I told him I wasn't making our default flank steak marinade (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/103506), but we were both very impessed with how this turned out. Perfect summer recipe: easy to make, nice balance of rich meat and light tangy slaw... delicious! I'll definitely make this for our next BBQ dinner party.

This is truly a 4 fork recipe: big flavors, ease of preparation, and high in nutrition. I used red cabbage and spinach in the slaw since that's what I had on hand, and one serrano pepper since the store didn't have red jalapenos. Wonderful sweet/spicy combo and the grilling time for the flank steak was right on target. Will make again-a new summer favorite

This is a new family favorite! I serve the flank steak and slaw with fries on the side. The steak has a great flavor, and the slaw is amazing and incredibly healthy...

Nice balance of salty and sweet. I'd recommend doubling the marinade.

Did not add ginger, not a fan of it. Coleslaw was too hot with half a green jalapeno (my market does not carry red). Added chopped cashews to the coleslaw which was a nice addition.

Great flavors, slaw and flank steak compliment each other perfectly... and very satisfying without being too filling

That was quick, easy, and rocked the house. A keeper for a quick weekday meal.

Fantastic recipe - the slaw really makes the meal complete. We used a top round cut instead of a flank steak and let it marinate for a day. I seeded the peppers to conrol the heat and left the slices large enough for people to pull them out if they didn't want them. This will be a favourite this summer

Excellent. Especially loved the crunchy slaw.

Excellent combination of savory, sweet and spicy. I ended up with very spicy peppers, so I wish I had started with fewer. I used blade steak because the store didn't have flank steak. It made a wonderful substitute.

This was great. Because I wasn't going to cook it the day I marinated it, I put it in a bag in the freezer, which allows the marination to continue in slow motion. When I pulled it out 2 days later, it grilled up perfectly & very tastily. Served it with a chopped salad of grilled sweet onion, tomato & sugar snap peas. Will make it again this summer for sure.
