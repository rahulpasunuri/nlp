I didn't have honey so I used a Vietnamese Sweetened Chili Sauce for Eggrolls. I think it added a lot; my husband absolutely loved this recipe that I halved, served with the recommended mashed potatoes (see reviews) and asparagus. Every bit was eaten and he asked me to keep the leftover sauce to put on his next rice dish!

I made this using chicken thighs with skin on from Whole Foods. I served it with Rombauer Russian River Chardoney . It was delicious. I actually have made it several times

I enjoyed this recipe very much! I did substitute orange juice for fresh oranges and used orange peel. We love cilantro at our house so I added a lot of it. It was a hit. I'll make this over and over.

This was not spectacular. But it was a good basic marinade.I am not dying to make it again.

I read the previous reviews, and I made this recipe exactly, and I just don't see what got it such a high rating. It wasn't bad, just not what I'd expect from a recipe with 3-1/2 forks.

Very,very good marinade. We used skinless, boneless thighs. Mixed the finished sauce on hot rice noodles. I'll try cooking it the grill next.

not good.

I'm giving this a high rating not only because it tasted great but also because of the ease of preparation. I used boneless skinless thighs and added some minced ginger but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

The chicken marinade with oranges and honey is simply delicious! I made it with some baked potatoes, which went nicely with it.

I made just the Scallion Mashed Potatoes and served them with the Fennel-Dusted Chicken with Capers and Brown Butter from this website (also good). The Scallion Mashed Potatoes were a hit, and we had leftovers, which is always nice. I'll definitely make them again.

great marinade! i used a tangelo instead of the orange and agave nectar instead of the honey. i also added about a tablespoon of rice vinegar. i swirled in a tablespoon of butter in the sauce just to finish it off right before service, too. yummy! might add some fresh ginger next time!!

This was super easy to make, and it turned out very juice. I don't think it was too sweet at all - it just had a hint of honey and orange when it was done. This might have been because I didn't put the sauce with it. I had the sauce boiling on the stove, and at 6 min I was going to take it off, but I was like, "well, they said to leave it on for 10 minutes...", so I left it on, and about 30 seconds later I looked over and it was ashes. Oh well.... Also, the mashed potatoes are pretty good.

I used 6 boneless thighs and kept the rest of the recipe as is. I baked it at 425 for 40 minutes. Didn't find the zest of 3 oranges overpowering like someone mentioned. Make sure you don't zest the pith.

Hubby really loved this, I only used the zest of one orange though and a little less honey. I also just poured the marinade on top straight out of the oven.

I thought this was very tasty. Served it with couscous and sauteed green beans. It was reminiscent of a classic Chinese-American orange chicken. The sauce was very thick and rich once reduced. Definitely cut back on the amount of zest recommended. I marinated the chicken overnight which kept the chicken moist and juicy.

This was fine. A little sweet maybe -- I'm not sure the honey was necessary -- and 3 oranges' worth is a LOT of zest; I'd back off it a little bit unless you want your chicken to be vaguely reminiscent of that abrasive hand cleanser mechanics use. But it's decent, and you can't beat the ease of preparation.
