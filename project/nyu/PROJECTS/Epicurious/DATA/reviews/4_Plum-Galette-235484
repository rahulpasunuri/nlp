I'm not sure I should review this. I used the crust from the Almond-Pear Galette recipe. I used cardamom ice cream (made with the Cardamom Crème Anglaise recipe) instead of of the creme frache. Still, it got raves.

So easy and so terrific. Used red apricots, which are similar to plums, and their golden interior and flame-red skin were gorgeous. Used vanilla-infused Cognac in the creme fraiche--sensational. The creme fraiche is so elegant and makes this galette something quite special.

Wonderful flavor. Didn't realize I was out of vegetable shortening, so made the crust entirely with butter, and it was totally amazing. Dotted the fruit with butter as someone recommended.

Very easy and very tasty. I added chopped almonds to the bottom and used brown sugar instead of white on the bottom. I still used white sugar on top. Didn't really notice that much of a difference between the sugars. Did not make the cream, but maybe next time, when I'm entertaining. I plan on making this again and again, maybe trying apples, pears or berries (maybe a combo of them too!)

Wonderful summer dessert! It's delicious as is, but I also made it once with fresh figs instead of plums, and it was equally fantastic. I've made this recipe several times over the past two summers, and I expect I'll be making it several times EVERY summer from hereon.

Made this with Fresh italian prunes from the local farmer's market, couldn't have been more simple or delicious. Didn't have any cognac to mix into the sour cream, so instead added just a touch of vanilla extract.

The German name of the plumcake (with a yeast dough) is Zwetschgendatschi. (Zwetschgen is the name for the italian prune plums.) If you want an easy/no fail recipe for the yeast dough,contact me at Brooke11x@haasemann.de and I'll gladly send it to you by email.

to wallywash, yes it is Pflaumkuchen, or in the dialect that some of my family uses is (I'm gonna spell this wrong) Quatchekuchen. My recipe is riddled with exacting measurements like; enough flour, a little salt, some milk etc.(family recipies are soo easy to share, ha ha). I was planning on making it this weekend anyway since the plums are currently available (and in my fridge). I will see what I can do about pinning down the measurements and will post it to the recipe swap forum next week. It's nice to know that there are others as fond of this recipe as I am, I hope it will come close to what you remember.

Plums are not the only summer fruit that makes a great Galette, any stone fruit will do along with apples. The only tricky part is knowing how much flour/sugar mixture is needed to thicken the filling. I sprinkle some ground almonds on the botton of the crust and then mix equal amounts of a-p flour and sugar together and sprinkle that over the almonds. Also, lightly wet the crust with a pastry brush when you fold it over and pleat it and then sprinkle it with more sugar before it goes in the oven. To keep the fruit from drying out I normally dot it with some butter. Works great with Splenda too!

When I lived in Germany as a child, our cook made a Pflaumkuchen that sounds like one that doecooks from Philadelphia is talking about -- with a yeast dough. I've been seaerching for a recipe for this versin of Pflaumkuchen for years and would love it if doecooks would share it. Thanks. This recipe looks delicious, too, and I plan to make it as soon as Italian prune plums are available.

I think the baking time is off. I pulled the foil at 40 minutes and the crust took another 10-15 to brown. At this point, the plums looked a bit dry, so when it came out of the oven, I basted it with some blackberry preserves. The sauce is excellent. My "tasters" fought over the last spoonful. The recipe was very well received, thumbs up by the group.

I also got excited, like doecooks above, for this recipe that reminds me of the plum kuchen my mother made every August. I'm not much of a baker, so I used prepared roll-out pie crust, and I unfortunately have a hard time getting my hands on good Italian plums, so I used under-ripe, very hard plums instead. The results were still fantastic-- both to look at and to eat. Even my partner, who does not go in for desserts and sweet things, gave it a big thumbs up!

I am going to do a thing I hate, comment on a recipie I haven't made. BUT,I make a simular plum "cake" (actually a bread like not too sweet, yeast dough base)that every one in my family in Germany makes in August. If you can find them use Italian plums/ prunes depending on your market. They don't taste great raw, but baked they have no rival (my opinion). They are only around in august for a short time. Now I love my cake, and have tried to suppliment other plums in order to extend plum cake season but the results are never as good, by far. And the cook time for the galette and the way it is assembled is nearly identical to my "cake" so if you find them I think it is worth using the Italian plums. You might need to go a bit heavier on the sugar though but not by much.

I used methyle plums, which are smaller than the regular plum, and I think the extra peels made it sour. Not gigantically pleased, but will try again with other fruits, or possibly poaching fruit in sugar water and will increase the sugar in the dough.

Lovely! So easy, makes almost no mess and tastes great! (the leftovers, even, cleaned themselves right up) I admit that I used a frozen roll-out pie crust, so can't vouch for that part of the recipe. I also used regular flour instead of semolina and still came out beautiful! In a city where produce is overpriced and underwhelming, it's good to have recipes using plain ol' plums!
