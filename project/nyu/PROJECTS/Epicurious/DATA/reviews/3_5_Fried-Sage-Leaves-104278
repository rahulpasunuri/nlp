To the person asking what one does with fried sage leaves: eat them! Very delicate and enjoyable. I had fried sage leaves years ago at a restaurant in Seattle and thought I remembered them as being panko breaded, so that's how I make them: Mix an egg, grind up panko so it's fine(I use a spice grinder but a rolling pin works well, too), dip sage leaves in egg then panko, and slip into hot oil (could have some garlic in the oil!) about 3-4 at a time for about 4 seconds/side and voila... yummy, crispy, great appetizer with cherry tomatoes, small mozzarella balls, baguette, and some balsamic dressing for dipping.

Excellent! I didn't follow the above method, though. I fried the sage leaves according to the less wasteful Sage & Garlic Mashed Potatoes recipe at http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=10848.

Four cups of oil? Yeesh!! You can do this in a small sauce pan with about 1/2 cup oil, working in smaller batches. These make a great garnish for topping a pasta dish, pref. a white sauce, or to top a cream of mushroom or cream of carrot soup.

Oh yeah! I ususally like to lightly salt them and enjoy them with a really cold beer on fall afternoons. Nothing better to enjoy out on the back porch in the late afternoon.

I am tempted to try this recipe since my outside herb garden still has sage hanging in there, but I can't figure out what one does with fried sage leaves. Can someone tell me?
