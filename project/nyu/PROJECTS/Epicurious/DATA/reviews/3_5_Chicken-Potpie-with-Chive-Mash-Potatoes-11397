Thank you for this recipe - lovely flavorings and surprisingly low-cal for such a flavorful dish. A good basic recipe that you can fiddle with - which I definitely would next time, with changes akin to A Cook From Oakland. I'd omit the boiled onion and replace with sautéed onion or additional sauteed shallots. Also, the sauce was a bit too runny and there wasn't quite not enough of it. I'd def add more herbs, stock and reduce with a bit more flour you get a more roux-like consistency. I didn't have mushrooms (which might have thickened it a little) or peas, but added extra carrot and put in some green beans and left over broccoli. It was delish, but prob would be better with mushrooms and peas. Finally, shredding the chicken would take up the flavor of sauce better than cubed. Oh, and I didn't have sour cream but added a few TBS butter. Just fine!

This is the perfect recipe for leftover Thanksgiving turkey! I followed the recipe as written, but substituted cooked turkey (that had been brined before roasting) for the chicken. This was incredibly flavorful. Will definitely make it again.

While the end result was OK, I did not feel it was worth all the effort. It was too bland.

I love this recipe. I used shredded rotisserie chicken meat instead to save on time. I also had no wine or sherry and the recipe still came out delicious! I am sure the wine and sherry would enhance it even more. I used one pan for everything so as not to dirty additional items. The only thing that was a bit time consuming to me was piping the potatoes on...my ziploc kept busting open. I will definitely make this again, but maybe I will invest in a piping bag!

I made this recipe pretty much as written, with two minor changes (I doubled the amount of peas and used 1/2 cup less broth). As written, I wouldn't make this recipe again. It was ok, but the taste didn't warrant all the effort. And, even with 1/2 cup less broth, my sauce was still runny. I may try it again , though, with these changes: 1. Use only 1 1/2 c. broth and let the sauce simmer a little longer; 2. Up the spices! A lot!; 3. Use half the amount of celery; 4. Cook the celery and carrots a couple minutes longer than specified; 5. Omit the pearl onions; 6. Either omit the mushrooms or double the quantity. 1/4 lb wasn't really enough to justify dirtying yet another pan 7. Make sure to salt the potato water with 1 Tbsp. salt; 8. Make maybe 50% more mashed potatoes.

I followed the recipe exactly other than the potatoes, I used regular pie crust. This was delicious!!! Worth the time.

I just made this using Thanksgiving leftovers, stock,turkey, and mashed potatoes. I didn't have pearl onions, and instead sauteed some leeks with the shallots. I also used some cream when making the sauce. It was so good that two of us polished it off and we're both skinny people. Way better with the mashed potatoes on top than crust. You can improvise with whatever veggies you want. I'm making extra mashed potatoes next time just so I'll have for this recipe. So much better than the chicken and fall vegetable potpie. I like turnips, but thought they were overpowwering in that recipe.

This is an amazing dish! It was time consuming but worth it. I followed the recipe exactly, and I wouldn't change a thing. The sauce is creamy and flavorful, there are plenty of veggies. It also seems to make more like 6 or 7 dinner servings, which is awesome.

This is a great warm-your-winter-tummy/yummy-leftovers recipe, but it definitely needs some tweaking. Luckily, I had some chevre. I crumbled this over the veggie mix, but under the potato mash, & it was perfect. Also, I substituted golden balsamic vinegar for the sherry to beautiful, bright effect.

Homey, healthy, and delish. A bit too labor-intensive for a busy weeknight but, on a snowy weekend in January, when you're just looking for a reason to putter in the kitchen, this is comfort food par excellence. Next time, I'll up the thyme, tarragon, nutmeg, and pepper.

Please ignore my neighbor to the east, who evidently felt it necessary to post that comment 6 times. One of the most useful things about this site is the reviews and advice from other cooks that have done various tweakings to recipes and discovered ways to make an OK recipe good, or a good recipe great. I for one always read the reviews before trying a recipe, and very often take the advice from others, and am usually grateful. So y'all keep it up! P.S. I haven't even tried this recipe yet, though I intend to (it's going into my recipe box) - just had to say that.

People, how do you expect readers to judge a recipe when you change 18 of the ingredients but then still give a recipe four forks? You have to rate it as if you made it as described, otherwise you do the rest of us no good.

Made this for a Sunday dinner and it was quite nice. Used puff pastry instead of mashed potatoes and everyone loved it. Mixture needs to be seasoned as well or it's a little bland even with the sauce using regular broth.

This was such a fabulous recipe! I took the advice of others and I added more veggies- instead of .5 cup of frozen peas I added a whole (small) bag od frozen mixed vegetables and I omitted the celery. I also used a large regular yello onion instead of shallots and it turned out great!! The dish does need a bit of salt though, so I would suggest not using low-salt chicken broth and adding salt while it cooks!

I used turkey cutlets instead of chicken. I cut the recipie in half, and it was still more than 2 people could eat with a salad on the side. I poached the turkey in 1.C. dry vermouth, 2 C. water and 2 sliced garlic cloves and a chicken boullion cube. I simmered the carrots and celery in 1.5 C. water with chicken boullion cube added. It gave the turkey and veg a little more flavour. I used dry vermouth again in the sauce and omitted the sherry. I used frozen pearl onions and frozen peas. Nest time I may just use frozen mixed veg and eliminate the need to boil up all of the different veg. It was all very tasty but used an inordinate number of pans to produce.

Having first read the reviews that this recipe turned out runny, I took the advice of one reviewer... the key to perfection is in adding slightly more veggies. Also, make sure that the sauce has nicely thickened before pouring it on the veggies.

So delicious! I made this on the night of the first snowfall in NYC and it was so cozy and comforting and good. I added about twice the sour cream as well as some salt and butter to the potatoes. Also, the lady in front of me at the grocery store was impressed by all the vegetables I was getting.

I have made this recipe for years without ever reading the reviews, and I was stunned with what I read. This is one of my most requested comfort food recipes, however I usually add more veggies than the recipe calls for so my sauce is never runny.

The soup on its own is a great meal; add some salad and bread and enjoy in front of the fireplace.

I made this for my parents who like casseroles and have to watch their fat intake and was very pleased with it. I agree with the review that added herbs de'provence. That makes it a little more special. I also used frozen pearl onions to reduce the prep time and have even cooked my vegetables in the microwave which also reduced prep time.

This was very so-so way too runny and tasted bland there should br a crust for the bottom.I don't think I would ever make this again. What alot of work. Disappointing.

Prep is lengthy would recommend making the filling in advance. Instead of the bay leaf I used Provencal herbs from France. Would definitely make this again it was an excellent dish and would do well with guests I think.
