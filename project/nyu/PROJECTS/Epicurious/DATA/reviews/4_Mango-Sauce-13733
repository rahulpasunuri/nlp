Whipped this up to top a store bought key lime pie, delicious! Will use the extra for ice cream.

This is really simple and easy to make. I cheated and used canned puréed mango (from the Indian store) and just added the limes. I plan to use the left over sauce as a dipping sauce for meatballs, and serve it as an appetizer. I think it would also go well with crabcakes for a nice spring lunch.

I only had 1 mango so I substituted 2 kiwi and omitted the lime juice. Very tasty indeed!

This is really, really good and easy to make. It is outstanding on the key lime "cannoli" dessert, and I'm sure would go with many other dishes. The mangos I could find were not very ripe, so I added quite a bit more sugar than called for. The mangos should be very ripe: the riper the better!

Superb and versatile. Great with Key lime dessert. Can't wait to try with chicken, etc.

It is so simple and so good! ( here we say ONO, which means delicious)....I have used it over pound cake and if you mix it with a bit of plain yogurt it makes a great dressing for fresh greens and fruit salads.
