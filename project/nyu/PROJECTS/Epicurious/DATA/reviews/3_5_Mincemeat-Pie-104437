If you have memories of less than great mincemeat pies made from jarred mincemeat, they this recipe. I used butter because my grocery store did not have beef suet. The pie tasted very good, but I would like to try it with suet. This recipe does make enough filling for a 9 inch pie. The cooked fruit and allspice smells and tastes great and this is a very nice holiday pie.

I forgot to add that I made about 10 times this recipe, and used muffin tins to make little tarts. Tasty! I can't wait for christmas again!

I didn't follow this recipe exactly, but rather I read several recipes and combined that knowledge to make my own. I give mincemeat in general 4 forks. Mincemeat pie should be served at every holiday meal as far as I'm concerned. I used butter, and will use more liquor next time. If you're curious about mincemeat pie, please try it out. If you don't like the sound of suet in your pie, use butter. If you don't like raisins, omit them! Recipes should be adapted to your own taste. The mincemeat tastes better if it's given time to set before you use it. so make it several days or weeks before you plan to use it. (I jar mine up and keep it in the fridge until the day I want the pie) Now if only I could get my hands on some local heirloom apples....

To Cook From Baltimore: Beef Suet is the hard fat about the kidneys and loins in beef and mutton that yields tallow and NO OTHER fat can or should be substituted. Please ask your butcher for this. TO Bill McGaughey from Branson,Mo.: Approx. 1/2 lean beef stew meat that has been boiled, cooled and put through a grinder or processor should be added per pie. You can also use leftover roast beef that has been ground in lieu of stew beef.

Also, to be considered true mincemeat, approx. 1/2 lean beef stew meat that has been boiled, cooled and put through a grinder or processor should be added per pie.

Beef suet is the fat that is taken from around the kidney of the animal. Not beef fat from any other cut. Here we make little mince pies which are very traditional at christmas time. I use an orange pastry very tasty served with fresh cream.

Very Good but I am looking for a recipe that uses Beef roast (lean) ground up after roasting to make mincemeat . Any one have that kind of recipe ? I think the one I am looking for came from Bell's Best Pies--Not sure ??..and can't find the book .!

Suet is raw beef fat. You trim it from a cut of beef or you can buy it from your grocer or butcher.

I would like to make this recipe but what is beef suet?

I'd make this recipe again, but, I'd double the amounts to make twice as much - there was not enough filling for a nine inch pie. Anyway,as made obvious by the lack of reviews here, not everyone loves mincemeat pie. My boyfriend and I are among the few I know that love it!

I don't understand this recipe. The suet doesn't cook with the fruit before it goes into the pie shell?
