I love a good black bean burger, but this was not that. To be fair, I did half the recipe, but still...the texture and the flavor were way off. It fell apart, and was very bland. Sorry, but I would look for another option.

The taste of these burgers was very good! However, they were on the dry side, despite adding some grated onion. Next time I'll try more onion, maybe an egg, or a different brand of beans, as others have suggested.

Just made this tonight. I substituted the mayo with an egg and did double the cumin. I also let the beans air dry. The burgers were great. Kept there shape and didn't break apart and full of flavor. Will make again and again.

This recipe is very easy to prepare and tastes great! I treated it just like a burger; I added cheese and mayo and put it on a roll. I'll definitely be using this one again.

These burgers are delicious and I make them quite often, but getting the texture right is tricky. I have decided that it depends on the brand of canned beans you use. Sadly, the organic beans from my co-op always make for black bean sloppy joes (still delicious though) and using dried beans they were extra dry and crumbly and I had to add extra mayo and some oil. It seems like the regular grocery store brand beans work the best. Also if you substitute ground up corn tortilla chips it's tasty and works for gluten-free friends!

Very tasty burger recipe, I followed others' suggestions and added an egg and lessened the mayo, plus added more cumin, which gave it great flavor. Next time, I'll add some garlic salt and possibly some chopped olives or a bit of tapenade for some more salt flavor. Overall, very good and very filling!!

This was the first veggie burger I've made, and I was very pleased with the result. I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted an egg for mayo. I also used about 1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs, and doubled the cumin. They were a bit crumbly to eat, but held up quite well on the grill. And they were delicious!

We make this WITHOUT the mayonnaise and we double the cumin. Served on either Jenifer Street Market's ciabatta rolls or Rudy's organic whole wheat buns, with fresh lettuce, tomato, and avocado, this is a big winner in our house. LJBN

Added two eggs to hold it together and a bit of extra breadcrumbs to firm it up. Used red beans. It held together fine, but the flavor was bland and though the outside was crisp, the inside was mushy. Not worth trying again.

Rating: 3
Based on previous reviews increased bread crumbs to 1/2-cup, doubled cumin and cayenne and allowed drained beans to air dry for about 10 minutes. Patties stayed together nicely and were delcious! Served with salsa, carmelized onions and sour cream. Perfect with sweet potato fries. Definitely adding this recipe to our "go to" meals.

Really simple and tasty! I'd definitely make these again. I didn't have any problems with the burgers falling apart. I prepped the beans by I rinsing them and then letting them dry out in the fridge ahead of time. Wet beans = soft, fall-apart burgers.

Kids tried it but were not thrilled. They were easy to make and I think they are tasty. Nice topped with a fresh salsa. I might try making this again but reworking it so I can make it on my foreman. Less mess then frying.

I should have tried the egg. The mayo didn't hold it together and I wish it was less mushy. Also, using a food processor was useless. It wouldn't mix. I used my hands in a big bowl. It is good, but nothing special.

Great! I dry the beans in the oven at 170 for 10 mins or so. I also use a burger press to keep them together.

Delicious even though they fell apart. I will make them again and try some things others have suggested to keep them intact. For an extra kick, I added a fresh jalapeno to my "burger" mixture in the food processor and made a pureed/whipped guacamole to top it off, it was fantastic!

The taste was fine but did not wow. It was also way to crumbly and fell apart faster than it could be eaten.

I make these all the time, and I love them. It is essential to drain the beans and let them stand to dry for at least 20 minutes. Also, if I don't have bread crumbs, I just substitute oats. These are delicious as the recipe is, or great with onion or chile peppers. My kids love them, even!

Rating: 0
These are so easy and delicious. They are great just the way they are, but I can imagine using the recipe as a base for all sorts of other ingredients including seasonings and vegetables. They do squish a bit on the bun, and I wonder if cooking them longer, or adding more breadcrumbs might help.

Rating: 3
I made these exact to the recipe except I made mine into lots of mini burgers instead of 4 normal ones. They were flavorful (but next time I might add a bit more cayenne pepper) and they held together very well in a frying pan with a little oil, and stayed together on the buns (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Hamburger-Buns-242614) I found the intenal texture to be a little bit too soft/pasty. It was still delicious for a little 2 bite mini burger, but I feel that had I made big ones it would have been off-putting. Maybe next time I'll just lightly squish the beans with a potato masher instead of a food processor add/or a little brown rice to give it more texture.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! Perfect size and very, very easy to make. I second the call for including an egg and reducing the mayo. I'd also suggest adding a bit more cayenne if you want a notable kick. Another suggestion for improving things is to give the beans a little time to dry so there's less moisture and the burgers hold together better.

Rating: 4
Since other people had mentioned that these burgers were lacking some pizzazz I added a 4 oz can of diced green chiles to the mix. They were great. I also substituted 1 egg for the mayo and baked them at 350F for 10-20 minutes, as suggested. Veggie burgers are usually sticky and hard to handle - this approach solved everything! Topping with a spicier salsa gave some zing too.

Great recipe! Followed recipe except added the sauteed onion and garlic as suggested - also threw in a handful of chopped peppers (red/yellow/green) - This is going in the regular supper rotation!

This was delicious and easy. My husband and I added some grated onion to add that kick that everyone is looking for. Also, I didn't use oregano and it was fine. Don't forget the cilantro, that is important for the flavor. We added more bread crumbs than the recipe called for. And the next time I make it I will try adding an egg so that it holds together better.

Loved this. Served it without a bun and with sliced avocado, salsa, sour cream, and a red cabbage salad. Very easy, healthy, delicious.

I followed the recipe precisely and served with salsa, sour cream and lettuce on a hamburger bun as suggested. I thought the burgers were great, took no time to make and seemed pretty healthy. One of the 4 burgers cracked when I flipped it but it didn't fall apart and the others were fine. I will make this again.

Fell apart. Not very flavorful. Needed a kick.

I used brown rice cooked in beef broth instead of bread crumbs, but forgot to use the egg. It probably would have held together better, but wasn't that bad. I cooked them in the oven, like one of the readers had suggested. I could flip them easily without them coming apart. The flavor is great!

I tried eggs and olive oil, next time I'll just use an egg. Overall good, would recommend using avocados. Used are George Foreman grill (don't laugh the man's a genius) and it worked great.

They need a lot more punch!! I tried to punch them up a little by adding hot spices and garlic, but it wasn't enough. I used 1 egg and 1 Tbs of mayo and they came out great in a frying pan- no problems with them falling apart. Next time I'll modify the recipe even more.

I hate to be a wet blanket, but I was very disappointed with this recipe as it was posted. After reading a few comments re the mushy texture of the beans, I opted to add more breadcrumbs and mayo and set my mixture in the freezer for 20 minutes to make it more malleable and even took an extra step to create six very thin pattiesstill no luck. I couldn't even flip the patties without them falling apart so I'm thinking of using the mixture as a taco filling for tomorrow night. Perhaps I made a critical error in not adding an egg, but I didn't have eggs on hand so I had to make due. Not sure what went wrong, but I would not recommend this.

Rating: 3
These are really delicious. I'd give 3.5 forks if I could. Mine held together fine, make sure you drain the beans well. I even patted them dry-er with paper towels, and just used regular nasty store bread crumbs which absorbed plenty and kept the puree stiff. They could use more zip, but they were delicious with salsa and sour cream. Definitely one we'll make again, my 10 and 14 year-olds inhaled them. The full recipe disappeared into the three of us. Perfect quick weeknight dinner.

I had some leftover cuban black beans from last night and so I decided to try to try the burgers. I modified the recipe a bit. I used egg rather than the mayo, I added more seasonings-cumin, cillantro, and chipotle, and I used panko rather than bread crumbs. I baked the burgers in the oven 350 for 15 minutes. I was very pleased with the result. The burger was firm and worked very nicely in a bun with salsa, grated cheese, and sour cream. I will keep this in my file for backyard bbqs. I am guessing that these can be made ahead and put on the grill to re-heat. I will definitely make these again.

I made this recipe last week with a few modifications. I seasoned with garlic, added an egg, and left out the mayo as other reviewers suggested. I accidentally blended both cans of beans and added a small can of corn to help them stick together. Instead of frying I baked them in the oven for about 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees, flipping once. They turned out great! They weren't greasy and they stuck together quite well. I would make these again!

Rating: 3
I made these with two egg whites instead of mayo. Sauteed 1/4 onion and garlic, added two chipotle canned peppers and some adobe sauce from the can. Topped with either cheese, salsa or both, these were good and I would make again. Don't need the oil that this calls for, if you can brush the grill you are cooking on with oil, at the beginning and when you flip them. Held together great.

Do yourself a favor and don't make these. I added onion and garlic to the puree, and they were still pretty bland. They didn't hold together. But most troubling was their mushy, overly bean-y texture. I love beans and I love veggie burgers, but these did not do it for me.

Rating: 3
I couldn't find cans, so ended up cooking 28 ounces of beans, which was a lot. They were tastier than I expected, but I wish I'd added garlic as well, and perhaps even a bit more cilantro. We had it with homemade wholegrain pitas, salad, and avocado. My husband ate all his, and my 20 month old toddler had some too. I used a masher, not a food processor, and just made thin patties to avoid them falling apart too much.

Had some problems with the burgers breaking apart. Based on other reviews, I anticipated this and served the burgers in whole wheat wraps with salsa, avocado, and sour cream. In the end, they looked more like a vegetarian burrito. Tasted delicious, even if not a true burger!

I found this to be tasty, but they don't exactly firm up when you cook them at least not in 5 minutes. Next time I am going to make thinner patties, cook on a lower temp, for more time. I will update this review then.

The reviews scared me a little bit, but I was starving and had about 20 minutes to feed my son; I had everything in the pantry, so I went for it. Result: DELICIOUS! I'm not sure what the problem was for everyone else. I did add salt and pepper and used an egg instead of mayo, like most people suggested. I think maybe garlic powder, too. But I was very pleased; my son ate it all (and he usually hates beans!); my husband asked for it again--though he suggested making mini-burgers and putting them in pita, like falafel. These will definitely be a pantry staple for us. Oh, yeah--let them get REALLY crunchy on the outside. Mine weren't wet or mushy on the inside at all!

Rating: 3
Jazzed these up a bit by adding chopped onion, garlic and adobo sauce to the puree. I think they would have been pretty boring without! I made them thinner so they cooked more all through-yeilding 6 burgers. Really don't need buns but then I guess that really would't make them burgers!

Rating: 3
This recipe is easy and delicious. I followed the suggestion to add sour cream and salsa. I would add some fresh sliced jalapeno and onion next time. I added a tiny bit of sauteed minced garlic to the mix before making them into patties. They DO fall apart quite a bit. You can barely get them out of the skillet. It might need some egg, or just a pita instead of a regular bun. Everyone loved them...although they made us all poop a lot the next day. :O I guess that means they're "healthy".

I made them tonight and they were a big hit. Had them with sliced Spanish onion, sour cream and tomato slices. The only change I made to the recipe was to add 3/4 tsp. sea salt.

I made these for Super Bowl Sunday. Great way to have a burger, without the cholesterol.

Behold the power of the Black Bean Burger!

Prepared this on 2/7/09 and I thought it was delicious. It took me a little longer to prepare than the recipe says as, (1) I'm sort of an amateur cook and (2) fixing and chopping the cilantro took awhile. However, I thought it was worth it!

Rating: 4
Made this last night for dinner. So easy and so good! I added lime juice to the mixture and we ate them in pitas with salsa on top. The pitas worked out really well because the patties are a bit soft and don't stay together too well, so the pitas made a nice home to keep it all together. Just cut the pita in half and you have two nice little pockets. A perfect quick and easy weeknight meal. It'll definitely make another appearance on our table.

as written, probably would be more of a two-forker: I followed the suggestions to add garlic and sub egss for mayo - then added water chestnuts for texture, oatmeal to get them to stick together (too wet otherwise), and some dried parmesan for flavor. served with sauteed mushrooms. Got 5 burgers out of the deal. am looking forward to mixing it up even more.

These were good- the mixture is easy to form into patties and doesn't fall apart in the pan. the flavor was good, albeit it IS a different texture than a beef burger, obviously. I give two forks because I don't believe in recipe rating inflation!

These were not only super easy to make, but had great flavor! I threw them in the freezer for about 15 min before cooking and they turned out fine. The middle is slightly mushy, but that was fine with us. We topped them with homemade guac, caramlized onions and sharp cheddar.

Simple and cheap, this recipe went over well as a change of pace from the usual. I used two egg yolks and the crumbs of one slice of bread into half the bean mixture. The burgers held together - sort of - and the flavour was pleasant. Cooked, sliced mushrooms as a garnish would improve the meal. But I got three large patties. Four smaller patties might have been more successful in holding together. I can't see how this recipe is rated at 4 servings. I made the other half recipe into a bean dip using mayo and it was only ok.

I was disappointed. I added an egg and more breading than called for. But still didn't have the right texture. I thought I might have made the burgers too thick. If I try it again, I will add walnuts and corn. That may mask the mushy beans texture.

Rating: 1
Pretty disappointed. Apparently against my better judgment, I decided to follow the recipe exactly and not make any substitutions. While the burgers had a good flavor, they were incredibly mushy and did not hold together at all while cooking - which took way longer than 5 minutes. I only made 2 burgers and ended up throwing out the rest of the mixture. Some egg and possibly more breading would have helped here.

For those wanting real vegan food, use Veganase instead of egg-filled mayo. These really do require chilling before cooking or they are just too mushy. I also think blending these in the food processor is complete overkill! Just get a big bowl and a potato masher and then you can control the texture. Would you make crab cakes in a food processor?? I added some chopped scallion, red pepper and celery so they weren't mush burgers either. They are way too soft and baby food-like otherwise. But the basics are there. Very quick and easy and 10X better than frozen Garden Burgers.

Fabulous! I did not have cilantro, so subbed extra oregano, and like a few other people, added some diced garlic. My food processor is broken, so I mashed half the beans by hand with a fork, which worked well. I also used a little more breadcrumbs than this called for. Cannot wait to try this as a base for other beans and spices--thinking chickpea & curry, cannelini & italian and so on.

My husband said this was the best meal I ever made. Maybe a stretch, but I am learning my way around the kitchen:) I added an egg white for consistency as suggested and had no problems with the mixture falling apart. I did find that the inside did not cook that well while the outside was crispy, still very good. I served them as mini-burgers with the ready to make dough and chipotle mayo (just mayo, cilantro, lime, and chipotle).

This recipe was excellent. I made a few of my own alterations and incorporated suggestions of others. I mashed 1 can of beans using a potato masher. I used fresh bread crumbs, about 1 1/2 slices of whole grain bread -- pulsed in a mini processor. I lessened the amount of mayo to 2 TBS and lessened the cumin to 1 1/2 tsp. I added garlic (3 cloves, minced). All other spices were as noted in the recipe. Finally, I made 8 smaller burgers. Everyone loved them! We will definitely make this again! Served over rice, no salsa necessary.

These were ok. I followed the recipe to the T except that I used the entire 15 oz can and cut the recipe in half as there were only 2 of us. (Do they sell 14 oz. cans?) Mine didn't fall apart as other reviewers have stated. I used just a little bit more in the blender than I did the whole beans. (Think 7 oz. whole, 8 oz. in blender.) They held together and they were moist without being mushy. I'm wondering if the other reviewers used 2-15 oz. cans of beans. If so, the extra 2 oz might be the cause for the mush. My real beef with these veggie burgers is that they were fairly flavorless, though spicy. A bit of salt would do wonders in this recipe. No salt seems like a huge oversight on the flavor spectrum. We served this with fresh avocado slices and salsa fresca. That helped the flavor immensely, but I won't make these again. They took longer than 10 minutes to make and the results just weren't worth it. If you are really hyped to make Black Bean Burgers, try searching for them on the Martha Stewart website. They have a good looking recipe to try there.

I immediately made these for a group of friends after seeing it in the February issue of Gourmet. They were ridiculously easy and quick and everyone raved about them. Mine were also a little moist in the middle, I imagine due to the fact that the recipe is already meant to be a little wetter and I used 15 oz cans of black beans (instead of the recommended 14 oz cans). I think the extra beans over saturated the bread crumbs. Perhaps A Cook is on to something with the reduction of the mayonnaise.

These tasted great and had a wonderful, creamy texture, but unfortunately didn't hold together during the cooking (or eating) process. Might try again next time using egg as a binder. Also, seemed very rich; might try making five patties instead of a very filling four.I added a clove of garlic to the mix -- would actually make a good bean dip/hummus, minus the bread crumbs, in their precooked form.
