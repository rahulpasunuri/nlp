I am sooooo happy that I have found this recipe !!! I made it back in 2001 and it was fantastic. I have had several requests for it since. I had made it a few times back then, but now I have sooooo many Bon Appetit magazines that I forgot which one the recipe was in. Definitely make this one!

If you use parbaked croissants that you bake right before using, just sandwich two croissants together instead of trying to cut the croissant in half. Also only used one pint of blueberries and glad I did. The result was sweet chewy burnt custardy goodness. Also *very* filling.

I just made this dish and it turned out great! I skipped the filling, subbed triple sec for the brandy (I love orange and blueberry together) and added a little vanilla. I heated a couple splashes of maple syrup in the same pan with fresh blueberries and then poured over top. YUMMMY!

I'm reviewing this even though the recipe was more of an inspiration than a directive. Blueberry Croissant French Toast sounded delicious, but the half and half, brandy, and preserves sounded like a bit too much. I substituted 2% milk for the half and half, 1/2 tsp vanilla for the brandy, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg. Instead of the blueberry preserves, I cut pockets (it's not as hard as it sounds! this is a great recipe to practice this since it won't matter much if you mess it up!) into the croissants and stuffed them with fresh blueberries: much less sugar and completely delicious! In case anyone is interested in replicating, be sure to stuff prior to soaking. Stale croissants are a MUST - buy them Thursday or Friday for Sunday brunch and leave them in a paper bag on the counter. For cooks in a hurry: make your milk and egg mixture the night before. It only takes a few minutes, but it's nice to be halfway through with the recipe when you start in the morning!

You can't mess this recipe up because it's pretty easy and no matter what you do to a croissant, chances are it's going to taste pretty good. Next time I would spread some cream cheese on the croissant. It's a fairly quick recipe, so it's a good one when you don't have alot of time. Good, just not "wow".

The flavors were okay but my entire family found the consistency unpleasant. None of us care for french toast where the interior of the bread is mushy & custardy.

Very tasty, but could be less sweet. I used 2% milk instead of half n half, and next time I'll halve the amount of sugar. I also suggest using *stale* croissants (not fresh ones like I did ) to avoid soggy texture. (Duh, classic French toast mistake, I know!) The blueberry topping really makes this dish--don't skip it! To the person asking about what sort of brandy to use: Any kind of basic brandy will be fine; don't waste the good sipping stuff on French toast custard. You might even experiment with other liqueurs (I know I will).

Oh MY. This is killer. I used 1% milk and it was just fine. I think the brandy really makes this dish. Next time I may try orange marmalade inside instead, I think it would be a nice contrast. The amount of butter called for is really unnecessary, I will use the amount I normally use when making French toast next time. Other than that, a great dish, sure to impress.

I'd love to make this but am not sure of the brandy to use? Could someone recommend a brandy for this french toast? Thanks.

The only reason I didn't give it four forks was because of how rich it is....only a bad thing if you can't control yourself.

Loved it. Did not use the blueberry preserve. Substituted the brandy with vanilla extract. Yummy...

This was absolutely wonderful! Although I substituted the 1/2 and 1/2 with regular milk. Very, very rich...but I enjoyed every bite. The brandy ands a nice snap to this. I'll definitely make this again!

I made this with low-fat milk instead of half and half to save a few fat grams -- this was still one of the most fabulous breakfasts I have ever made. It is absolutely rich and decadent. The hint of brandy really tastes great. Don't leave it out!

Sensational! Wonderfully rich and decadent. Not being a blueberry fan, I used raspberry preserves and frozen raspberries. Works best with stale croissants -- don't use too fresh ones.
