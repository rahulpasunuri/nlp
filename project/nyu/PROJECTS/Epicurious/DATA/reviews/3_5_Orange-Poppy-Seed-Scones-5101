I read the reviews and added an additional egg white. I loved the texture (baked 18 minutes) but found them to be too low on orange flavor or sweetness, so I added an orange/mango glaze. I used a freshly squeezed orange for the recipe, but next time will try a thicker fresh juice (like an Odwalla smoothie blend) for more flavor punch.

If you are looking for something easy, very tasty and not sweet - this would be it! Great for breakfast or midafternoon tea. Have made it several times and received nothing but great reviews.

The flavors were quite subtle but worked well together. I found the batter needed an extra egg, which also made the scones slightly moister. I baked for fifteen minutes. The recipe was very easy and I will defintely make again.

This was a super quick and super easy recipe. I didn't have any trouble at all or need to make any adjustments. I made an orange glaze to drizzle over for a little something extra. I am not a big fan of scones but I really liked these.

I used to bake this all the time until I lost that issue, I used to add buttermilk to make it less dry then cut the circle into wedges, Rasberries were good added to this. I have just discovered the ginger Scone from La brea bakery listed on this site and while this is very very good the ginger scone is the best scone I have ever tasted, and believe me growing up here in Victoria BC CAnada I have tasted a LOT of scones. Try this it is very good but then try the ginger scone it is stuff dreams are made from....

I have made a lot of scones in my time, and these were by far the best. I did need to add an extra egg white to the batter to make it moist enough, and then I used the yoke to brush on top to get a nice brown cover. My brother, a harsh scone critic, called it "a little bit of sunshine bursting in my mouth." Granted, he tends to be dramatic, but he's got a point. They are fantastic! You could add more orange if you wanted to, but they don't really need any more.

This is one of my favorites...I'm not sure why anyone had trouble with this recipe...I make them often and have never had a problem.

Easy and good. I halved the recipe and ended up adding the other part of the egg. Substituted orange oil for orange peel. Very good flavor.

Does this recipe actually work? After I combined the egg/juice mixture with the flour mixture it was still way to dry to bind together. I ended up having to add over 1/3 cup buttermilk just to get everything to bind (the result was good, but that's a different recipe).

I have made this rceipe regularily since I first saw it in Gourmet Magazine. My family loves them. I do, however, have a couple of comments; 1. Rather than kneading on a floured surface and then patting into flat pieces (this makes the pastry tough), gently shape the pastry into 6 rounds and place them on the cookie sheet to bake. 2. You can substitute a variety of things in place of the poppy seeds, i.e., dried currents, cranberries, cherries or raisins and nuts.
