I tried two different ideas with the Pecan recipe. I added 3 cups of chopped nuts and it worked great. I also tried this recipe with walnuts and it was equally delicious. I also lined the pan with heavy duty foil and gave it a good dose of cooking spray. When it came time to cut the cookies I just lifted them out of the pan with the foil. There was no sticking and they cut easily. Will definitely make these again.

These are great. Everyone who tased them said they were really good. I used parchment paper, an 8 by 8" pan and I baked them for 25 minutes. I was very happy with how they turned out. I used half the shortbread base for this recipe and the other half for the lemon bars. Both are great recipes. Now I want to try the other recipes that go with the hot shortbread base.

Rating: 4
I should also have added that I added about 1/4 tsp. salt to the topping and also cut them into bite-size triangles. These are really a candy, not a cookie, and they are very rich. And addictive! I'm not sure our batch will last until tomorrow...

These are delicious. There were a couple of minor issues, though. First, I could tell as soon as I measured the filing ingredients into the pan that it wasn't enough filling for this size pan. I made 1 1/2 times the filling. I would highly recommend to others that you do, too. Otherwise I think they'll be too thin and too sticky. As it was, the edges were too sticky and would crack fillings, so I had to cut them off and throw them away. Second, I found the honey flavor a bit overpowering. Next time (and there will be a next time, my husband took one nibble and his eyes lit up) I think I'll try Lyle's Golden Syrup or dark corn syrup. Finally, the crust is a great texture, but really greasy. I'm not sure how to fix that problem yet. However, even with it's faults, this is an easy and stunning recipe.

This bar cookie receives raves from my pecan and non-pecan loving family and friends. I make 2 adjustemnts--I increase the pecans by 1 cup (50%), and I cut the bars into small bite size squares...these are so intense that a bite is all one needs, until the next bite!

This is my go to recipe for pecan bars. The shortbread crust is perfect for keeping a crisp bottom to the bars. They are so rich and delicious that you just need a small piece. It reminds me more of a decadent candy bar than a cookie bar. I drizzle melted white chocolate and dark chocolate over the cooled bars and let set prior to serving.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe many times, and it is incredibly easy & delicious! Two things I would mention: (1) no not overcook the butter / pecan filling as it will become too hard when baked if you do, and (2) use the suggestion of others that say to line the pan with parchment or foil as it makes getting the bars out of the pan so much easier. I also use about 1 1/2 the amount of pecans and rough chop the 1st 2 cups then add an additional cup of non-chopped halves, but this is just personal preference. They are fine just as directed. It is the easiest pecan-pie bars I've ever made that are this delicious! There is never a morsel left on the plate when you serve these!

Fantastic! I made these and the hot shortbread base exactly as written, except used parchment paper (with overhang) to line the pan. Just popped them out of the pan when cool, and they sliced easily. Delicious by themselves, and I'm sure will be fabulous with ice cream. Will make again.

This is a very easy recipe to make--great for a tailgate party. I always line my pan with Release aluminum foil, and I substitute Karo syrup (usually a mix of light and dark) for the honey. The Karo makes these bars more like real pecan pie.

These are definitely delicious... fabulous fabulous flavor... but did I do something wrong? They stuck so vehemently to the bottom of my brownie pan that I had to practically chisel them out! I served together with ice cream for a delicious treat... but was disappointed at the difficulty in serving them. I also scratched my good calphalon pan in the process.

3.5 stars. I made the recipe as is and found it quite good; however, I was hoping for a crunchier crust (instead of chewy). Love them chopped up and over vanilla ice cream.

Excellent! I will put these in my "favorites" category for an easy dessert to make out of ingredients that I usually have in my pantry. I expected them to be very gooey and sticky, but they cut up nicely and traveled well. I added a tad more salt to the shortbread base and the pecan syrup because I love the salty/sweet combination. These are a keeper!

I have done a lot of baking for 50 yrs. I made 4 pans of these and took to a family reunion. Everyone LOVED these. I usually make a recipe exactly as written and then change it to my liking. The only thing I changed was to cut down on the second baking time a little. I used lasagne pans and only sprayed them. If you have problems removing from pan and/or cutting, it is because you didn't make them right. Absolutely no problems and very, very delicious.

vegan version: 8 oz. pecans 1/2 C vegan margarine 1 C. packed light brown sugar 1/3 C. agave nectar 2 Tbsp. soymilk hot shortbread base (made with margarine instead of butter). these came out very good. i think the bake time should be decreased by a few minutes, though. and next time, i, like the reviewer 2 before me, would make half again as much of the nut topping. VERY quick and easy to make.

Very easy to make and with all the flavors of caramel, pecan, and shortbread. I also added a layer of chocolate chips onto the shortbread before I poured the pecan mixture on top, but I think it would have been great (and more caramel-y) without the chocolate. Either way, delicious and easy!

I buttered my pan and allowed it cool for 20 minutes on a rack. Then I was able to flip the pan over and flip it back onto a cutting board. I had no trouble cutting into spares. Because I used butter, I believe it made the edges a little dark. I just cut the almost burnt edges off. These were good, but I do not think they taste like pecan pie.

Rating: 3
So yummy we had to sneak a few before taking them to a party tomorrow. I did have trouble getting the shortbread base packed down in the pan. My solution was to go outside in the 30 degree weather to do it. It was much easier that way, presumably because the butter had become too soft inside.

Really delicious. Soft and chewy. Added a lil' hint of Bourbon, going for the Derby Pie style. Next time might sprinkle a few chocolate chips, too, but wouldn't want overkill. It was just lovely the way it was.

I made these for dessert at a Thanksgiving potluck dinner, and everyone loved them -- even me, and I usually don't like or eat pecan pie. The shortbread base was great -- I wouldn't change anything in the recipe. I made mine in a silicon lasagna pan and they were very easy to pop out. Will be making these again and again for holiday treats!

These were awesome! Followed the recipe precisely aside from cutting the honey down to about a quarter cup. Used parchment paper and there was no sticking problem. Took these to a Thanksgiving potluck and they were gobbled up to rave reviews. It's impossible to find Karo syrup here in Belgium, so making a traditional pecan pie is almost impossible, and I am thrilled to have this recipe as an alternative.

Awesome recipe and easy as, well, pie! Followed recipe precisely, aside from cutting the honey back to about a quarter cup. Took this to a Thanksgiving potluck this past weekend and they were gobbled up! Eek, sorry -- I couldn't resist... As it's impossible to find Karo syrup here in Belgium, making traditional pecan pie is difficult, and this is just as good and a lot easier.

These were wonderful! I don't always like honey, so I was afraid the honey flavor would be overwhelming, but it wasn't. I thought the crust was perfect and I definitely would not reduce it. I cut them into tiny diamonds and I can't wait to bring them to Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow!

These ROCK! At an all-dessert buffet they were the fastest gone and the most requested recipe by far. I used a non-stick pan and after running a spatula along the edges just turned it out onto a large cutting board when cool and cut with a sharp knife. Came out perfect with clean edges. LOVE this recipe!

This has been a family favorite since the day the magazine hit the stand. I make this all through the holidays and always get RAVES and requests for the recipe. I make it in a 9x11 pyrex dish and push the crust up the sides of the pan - solves the sticking problem. Also, i use dark brown sugar for a molasses flavor throughout. Enjoy!

Absolutely delicious and relatively quick. I followed previous reviewer's suggestions and added 2 tsp vanila and used 1/4 cup maple syrup instead of honey (I ran out). Two complaints: 1) you end up using a lot of equipment, translating to a lot of cleaning afterwards and 2) the bars didn't slice nicely. I used a serrated knife but the bars still didn't have clean edges. Any suggestions?

I discovered this recipe in October and made it nearly once a week through the holidays for potlucks and parties. It is incredibly delicious and is very easy to make. Based on other reviews, I lined my 10x13 lasagne pan with parchment paper, so cleanup was easy, too. No problems with the crust being too thick. These are better than any pecan pie I've had!

Rating: 3
Everyone's talking about how bad these are for you. Sure, they're a special treat, but if you make 24 bars from a 9x13 pan, each bar will have 208 calories and 12 grams of fat. "Cook from 3/29/01" - do your math again! The whole pan is only 5000 calories! I could easily make 30 with my batch, if I could ever get them out of the pan!! These buggers are super-sticky. Not a treat you want to take to your dentist. They really do taste delicious, but make sure you use extra grease in your pan. Also, I removed 1 cup of the shortbread after pressing it in the pan because the crust was WAY too thick. (Got myself some delicious date bars from the leftover crust). I made them a second time and substituted pancake syrup for the honey and added an egg and the texture was much MUCH better - same great taste but much easier to cut and eat.

Rating: 3
Followed the recipes exactly for both the pecan topping and the shortbread base. I did adjust the cooking times using my convection oven. 15 mins. for blind baking the crust, and 15 mins. total after applying the topping. I lined the pan with parchment that was cut apprx. 1" larger then bottom of pan, then sprayed with a non-stick aerosol. I cooled the bars in the pan until just warm to the touch, then removed from the pan along with the parchment and cut into bars while they were still pliable. I was able to cut perfect bars without crumbling. Good on it's own but not comparable to pecan pie!

Rating: 4
Oh, these were so good! I've made all 3 varieties of bars with the shortbread base, and all are terrific. I found no need to cut back on the base, with the pecan bars especially. I added 2 tsp of vanilla and cut honey to 1/4 C, and still found plenty of honey flavor. The suggestions to line the pan (I used parchment) and serve pieces in cupcake papers were both excellent ones, and so these were a delicious, easy, popular dessert at our holiday party!

Rating: 4
We made the bars tonight and used many of the suggestions of other reviewers: 3/4 cup brown sugar; 1/4 cup honey and 2/3 of the shortbread mixture in a pan lined with parchment paper, ungreased, baked for 15 minutes. The bars were easy to cut when cooled and so delicious that I had to hide them from my husband so he wouldn't eat them all.

Rating: 3
I used only 1/2 of the shortbread recipe, added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to it and only baked it 12 min, to a whole filling recipe. The crust was much less intrusive this way. Also for those looking for a vegan recipe (AKA Parve) try mashing 2 Tbsp firm tofu with 1 Tbsp soy milk in place of the cream. I agree with the 1 Tbsp vanilla. Yum!

Rating: 3
Loved these. Made them using the suggestion of 3/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup honey plus some vanilla. They were still quite sweet. I think the crust was just the slightest bit too thick, so next time I won't put all of it in the pan. I had no trouble getting the bars out of the pan, but I greased the pan well beforehand.

Rating: 4
in reference to my first review below (sherman oaks, ca), i made the bars again as a dessert for Thanksgiving and added 3 teaspoons (yes 3) of vanilla and everyone finished the bars. i thought it would be too vanilla-y but they were SO good and tasted like toffee.

Rating: 3
Great treats! I made the following modifications based on the reviews: added 1t vanilla, used 3/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup honey, toasted pecans before stirring them in. I also found that my food processor didn't do a good job breaking up the pecans in nice-sized chunks, so I did it by hand. Baked for 15 mins. Lining pan with greased foil makes for easy clean-up.

Rating: 4
EXCELLENT. I bring them to every function that requires a dessert and ALWAYS get asked for the recipe.

Rating: 3
Tastes and looks good. Based on reviews, I decided to add 1t vanilla and to reduce the sugar and honey by 1/4 -- which was good because it gave the pecans a stronger presence. I baked for only 14 mins because the topping already was bubbling by then. Finally, I lined the pan with foil to make the cookies easy to remove. To the San Francisco cook: Try getting pecans for $2.95/lb at Costco or $3.99/lb at Trader Joe's.

Yummy! I bake these every year, and I have to share them with my friends and coworkers or else I'd eat them all. I do cut the baking time in half. A lot of people have problems with the stickiness, but that can easily be avoided. I line the pan with foil and grease the sides (anywhere the pecan mixture will touch). When they've cooled, the whole thing lifts out of the pan (use the foil as handles), then use a chef's knife to cut into bars. I've never had any problems doing it this way (and no messy pan!). And now everyone at work thinks I'm a goddess in the kitchen!

Fab! This recipe was great & relatively easy to make - I doubled the recipe for a cocktail party & it was extremely popular! So far seven requests for the recipe...I did let the base cool completely before putting on the topping. Also watched the time very carefully to avoid some of the problems others had.

I always receive rave reviews when I bake these bars. I have modified the recipe by adding 7.5 ounces of chopped bittersweet chocolate to the short bread after baking it for twenty minutes. I then place the pan back in the oven for a minute or so. After removing and spreading the chocolate I add the pecan mixture and continue per the recipe directions.

I thought this were wonderful. My husband and I are both hugh pecan pie fans so I couldn't wait to try these. I cut the recipe in half and made them in a 8x8 pan.

Maybe that was the problem with the previous viewers bars, they were probably over cooked. I will definately make these again and again.

I followed the recipe exactly and mine came out looking great but with very little flavor. My pecans were fresh and delicious so I think the recipe definitly needs a tsp of vanilla.

I've made these a number of times since my first review and have a few suggestions. Add a couple teaspoons vanilla to the recipe,it really makes a difference. Also,line the pan with parchment leaving enough paper to go up each side by a few inches for "handles".

This, along with the shortbread base, produce a chewy, cruny, sweet taste. We love it. However, one major drop back is calories count. It's whopping 6000+! A couple of those would eat up all my quota for dinner. This is wonderful to make for your guests, but not if you were to eat them youself.

I made these and the fudge bar cookies using the same crust. Both were easy and big hits for a tailgate party dessert. I agree the baking time is too long - I baked them about 10 minutes, until filling was bubbling. Also, they stuck in the pan so I would probably use a non-stick spray next time although the recipe didn't say anything about greasing the baking pan.

I agree with the cook from New Jersey. I didn't bake them as long so they weren't quite like brittle (a little more chewy) but they were very difficult to cut out of the pan.
