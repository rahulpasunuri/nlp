Very simple recipe. They are delicious, not too sweet like others wrote. They are very gooey, maybe next time I'll add 5 minutes to bake time. After they cooled, I put them in the fridge, and they were even better. They became less gooey and turned more like fudge. I'll make them again. I didn't alter the recipe at all, but I didn't add nuts. The batter was smooth and poured easily. Don't know why others wrote that their batter was lumpy or thick, maybe the butter/choc mixture got too hot.. that would cook the eggs when you added it to the egg/sugar mixture.

These are outrageous! Soo good and soo easy to make. I agree with other reviewers, however, that they require more time to bake. I baked mine for 35 minutes and they turned out nicely although I think I might let them go a bit longer next time. Even at 35 minutes they had a very fudgy consistency. I didn't find the brownies to be too sweet as others have mentioned - it's dessert after all! - and I wouldn't alter the ingredients at all. Enjoy!

The first time I made these, I listened to other reviewers and used more chocolate, less sugar. With the unsweetened chocolate, though, these were too bitter for my taste. The second time I made them, I followed the recipe's proportions exactly, and they came out delicious. The baking time for these is VERY sensitive. I don't even bother setting a timer, but I check them constantly. The toothpick test always works for me. Also, I noticed the batter is very thick and somewhat stiff, so if you pour it into the pan lumpy, you end up with lumpy brownies. Make sure to smooth it out before baking.

to make these brownies even better I increased the chocolate decreated the sugar and added baileys into the mix while the chocolate was melting in a double broiler. delicious.

These brownies were good but bake for only 25 minutes! I added 10 mins due to reviews and it was TOO long!

being as i am living in france this year the correct chocolate was a little confusing to find, so i just used black... i pared it with the fudge frosting recipe and it was totaly yummy! my french family gobbled it up! i will deffinatly make this again, although i used the wrong size pan and they were very thin, they will still totaly delicious. the fudge frosting was a totaly perfect combo... just have a glass of water ready they are very sweet!

These brownies were good, but I am still searching for the BEST brownie recipe, one I remember making years ago. This recipe is the best one I have found so far. And VERY easy.

Bless you for including this recipe. I made this twenty-five years ago, finding it to be the quintessential fudgy brownie. Unfortunately I misplaced it and have been looking for it for years. If removed promptly from the oven just as crumbs are visible on a toothpick test, the brownies literally have the consistency of fudge. This receipe has always worked perfect for me. Perhaps some of the problems cited were due to inaccurate oven thermostats or not removing the brownies promptly from the oven when they are done. I don't find the sweetness excessive. These are especially good eaten cold from the refrigerator or even the freezer. Thanks Epicurious!

our guest jackie says "i would never make these again, unless i realized that i had done something wrong." these brownies were dry and lacked the sweet browny taste we were hoping for. they are in no way "fudgy."

Fantastic recipie, but if you want to make them that step better, reduct the sugar to 3/4 cup (or even down to 2/3), increase the amount of chocolate to 200g, add a splash of Kaluha and dot raspberry's over the top before it bakes. After all these additional items are incorporated the length of time has to be increased, to about 40mins (start checking after the 30min mark). Mine were absolutely perfect at about 37mins. Perfectly squidgy and delectable!

I took the advice of some of the viewers and cut back on the sugar, but it still turned out to be too sweet. It took a lot longer than 25 mins to bake.... about an hour. But once it was done it tasted pretty good. I'll probably try a few more brownie recipes before i settle on this one

Very good. Crumbly tup, fudgy center. However it was way to sweet for our taste. Next time I'll reduce the amount of sugar at least 1/4 cup. Definitely use the walnuts. My oven bakes really fast so 25 minutes were just right.

I paid attention to the reviews that I read prior to making these brownies, so I purposely left them in the oven for 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for. They were just great...a crunchy top and chewy inside. Let them cool completely before cutting or eating, as they tend to be too gooey when they're warm.

Very tasty and easy-same comments as those before me though-took at least 45 minutes to bake and was still not 100% done. Kids liked recipe with white chocolate chips better than this one.

This is my favorite brownie recipe ever. I've made them for ten years now. I have found that they take longer than the 25 minutes baking time the recipe calls for....more like 35.

the most delicious brownies i have ever eaten. i substituted the chopped walnuts with milk chocolate chips, and added hot fudge flavored frosting (for further fudginess). they were absolutely delectable, and just as good the next day straight from the fridge! thank you, barbara fairchild!

If you're reading this, you'll probably make this recipe again regardless of my review, since everyone else seems to like it. But I thought the brownies were TERRIBLE. I followed the instructions exactly, but they failed to bake in 25 minutes so I left them in another 15 minutes. At this point the top surface began to crack and the toothpick was no longer wet so I figured they must be done. They stuck to the greased pan and were raw in the middle. So much for dessert...thankfully I had a watermelon in the fridge! Normally I'm very happy with the recipes I've taken off this site. Not this one, though. I guess I'll have to find a brownie recipe elsewhere.

Very good and very easy. My fiance and I enjoyed them but I hate to say it we like Duncan Hines better.

My husband also agrees these are the best brownies he ever ate, and he is a big chocolate fan. I've made them for dessert for guests, with a little ice cream, and they are a big hit. They keep for a couple of weeks in the frig.

Excellent. Brownies are even better cold from the fridge the next day. Easy to make, too!
