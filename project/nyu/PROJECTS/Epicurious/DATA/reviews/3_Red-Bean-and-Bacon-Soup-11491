Full-time-job-moms don't have time to soak beans, so I used two cans ... I thought this was good, the kids ate it up. I made some cheddar scones to go with and a spinach salad - perfect. I think you could even do it without the bacon, but why would you?

My husband and I love this soup. The flavors are fantastic and it is a great soup for a cold winter night. The sherry adds a great kick of flavor.

Well, I had some trepidation making this given the reviews, but I had Anasazi dried beans, and needed a red bean recipe so that I could use them. I know that some will think that I shouldn't give this 4 stars, since I altered the recipe considerably, but, the core spices were great and the final product great too. I omitted the bacon altogether, and used 2 tablespoons of canola oil to saute the veggies. I was generous on the celery and carrots, and used chicken broth where the recipe called for water, in addition to the chicken broth called for in the recipe. Used about 8 cups broth in total. I used a hand held mixer and didn't puree totally, leaving some beans and veggies discernable. The soup was delightful. Healthy, comforting and tasty. I will definitely make it again.

My son and I ate this and it was fine, but nothing to write home about. It gets points for warming us on a chilly fall night. We both thought the best part was the crumbled bacon on top and the corn bread I made on the side. (I'm working on being creative with the left overs because I'm not excited about going back to it.)

Good recipe. Spicy and smokey. Here's how I tried to shorten the cook time. Forget dry soaking, bought plain old canned red beans. Added chopped smoked pork neck meat for a richer, smokier flavor. And forget the part about the food mill. I took a metal sieve or colonder and scooped the soup into it and squeezed out the biggest pieces, just enough to create a thicker consistency. Or, like the other reviewer, I'd run it all through the food processor. Also added more cayenne and chili powder because I like it caliente!

I thought it was kind of bland, and was expecting something a bit heartier from a bean & bacon soup. It was ok, I made it, so I ate it.

I made this soup for a group of friends on a houseboat holiday. Everybody loved it. Great flavour, warm and filling on a winter's day.

This was the best bean soup I have ever made. All of the ingredients worked together to give the soup a really nice flavor. I pulsed it in batches in my food processor and I liked the pureed but not totally smooth texture. The garnishes, bacon, green onion and sour cream made it really delicious!

this recipe is bursting with flavour. I like a bit more spice to my food so I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper sauce to it. Really nice.

Perfect fare for a -20f day! I used smoked suasage instead of bacon & added a chipotle in adobo sauce. Wow! Sent it right over the top! We ate it for supper with fresh baked corn bread. Tomorrow I will skim off the fat. sigh

My family loved this soup. My 9 year raved about it and wants it every time I make soup. I did not force soup throug a food mill I just used my hand blender for a few moments and I was just great.

Excellent recipe for a cold night!! I would soak beans overnight for full flavor. Also, I did not put through a food mill.

I work in a local resturaunt. I made this for our patrons. This soup is very flavorful and a little on the spicy side. I will make it again, but I will need to adjust the spices a little to accomodate all of our patrons.. I personally LOVED it!!!

This is a "maybe I'd make it again" recipe, tho it could be my substitutions that made it less than exciting. I subbed turkey bacon for the real stuff, which still gives it flavor but not the required bacon fat. I did the onions in about two teaspoons of olive oil instead. Also, embarassed to admit I wasn't sure what a food mill is, I pureed this in batches in the blender. It's not bad, tho. Try it and see what you think.

This was yummy. I used canned kidney beans and adjusted the simmering time accordingly. Froze the leftovers and they were even better the next time.
