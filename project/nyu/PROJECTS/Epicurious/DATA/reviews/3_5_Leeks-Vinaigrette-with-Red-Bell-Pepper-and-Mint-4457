Been making this for years now and it's still great. It's an unusual 'salad' that pleases guests that get tired of the green variety. I change nothing.

My dinner guests and I thought this was a very flavorful, outstanding side dish. I would definately make it again. The combination of ingredients was delicious and not ordinary.

This recipe was not very exciting. The presentation was quite pretty, but I found it to be bland. An interesting mix of flavors, but I wouldn't bother to make it again.

It would help if I weren't so lazy about going to the store... I substituted yellow for the red pepper, brazil nuts for the walnuts, parmesan for the feta... And for health's sake used less cheese and nuts. Oh well. I did like it. Rather a cacophonous jumble of flavors, but still good. Not sure I would have liked it any better making the recipe exactly as written.

Delicious & a success with my dinner guests. I followed the recipe very closely but added a little sugar to the dressing to cut the vinegar. With the walnuts, feta & mint, it looks beautiful on a plate.
