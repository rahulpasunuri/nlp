I loved this recipe! I roasted the butternut squash with garlic, and also added shiitake mushrooms to it, and it was delicious!

We make this in our outdoor wood fired pizza oven. It has been a huge hit with everyone who tasted it, even my mom who doesn't like goat cheese! I have made it several times, and have used extra cheese (except when my mom is eating it, lol!), and have substituted swiss chard for the spinach on occasion with equally delicious results. I have also used sage, instead of thyme (usually fresh) depending on what is plentiful in the garden, and that change is very good. I usually add a touch of garlic to the onions when I cook them, and sometimes a pinch of nutmeg to the squash. This is recipe that begs for improvisation, and turns out great every time! It has been the most re-pinned and "liked" recipe on my Pinterest recipe board!

This was so easy and so delicious! I used more goat cheese than it called for and I'll definitely make this again. Maybe even tomorrow... because it was just so good.

This was really delicious. I used the whole wheat pizza dough recipe on the site eatliverun.com, and used half. I saw other reviewers saying it was dry, but I have to disagree. Maybe they didn't use all the olive oil called for? At any rate, I thought this was really delicious, healthy, and easy, and I'm looking forward to making it again.

I loved this recipe, I used goat cheese rolled in cracked pepper, and served this pizza with red wine braised short ribs-Together they were amazing!

I definitely did not think this pizza lacked flavor at all. I cooked the onions just as recommended and I broke the goat cheese up into little crumbles all over the pizza. The goat cheese added a fabulous flair and because I used frozen spinach (cooked with the onion to thaw it) I think I may have had better luck with the reported moisture issues as this pizza was simply scrumptious! Definitely will make again!

I liked the combination of veggies on this pizza as well. I too found it lacked flavor. Granted I did forget to put on the thyme but I did tweak it a little by putting some manchego cheese in addition to the goat cheese amd added a little leftover proschutto (sp?). It was still a little lacking, maybe some garlic with roasting the squash?

Re: Dryness and flavor, sprinkle with salt and freshly ground pepper and drizzle with a little heavy cream after topping the pizza, and use fresh thyme rather than dried. I also gently sauteed the spinach with a pinch of nutmeg before adding it to the topping.

I liked the combination of veggies on this pizza and it was easy to make but I found it lacked flavor and it was on the dry side. I think it might benefit from a drizzle of balsamic reduction or another sauce to add a bit of moisture.

Wow, followed the instructions and it turned out really delicious, the way they recommend making the onions is very important and I loved the flavors. It is a different pizza and I really enjoyed it.
