I'm on a soup kick and made a version of this last night. I used collards instead of chard because that was at the store and added in cumin and coriander after I sweated out the onions and celery as others recommended. I added 2 big tablespoons of harissa - I had a can from my sister in law who is Tunisian. At first bite it was way too hot, but it mellowed a bit - still a nice kick.

The only reason I didn't award 4 forks occurred because this soup is really nothing without the harissa sauce. With the sauce it is a second helping meal. I only used a couple of tablespoons of orzo and added a bit of Vogel's Herbamare, just because it is one of my go-to ingredients.Love the harissa sauce recipe on epicurious. This soup will be a staple in our kitchen.

Lovely and healthy but definitely needs an extra bit of something. I used lobster oil with the harissa and that seemed to do the trick. I might make it with lobster stock next time.

After reading that some considered this bland, I upped the chicken stock vs. water ratio. In fact, I added much less liquid in total so it ended up thicker - closer to a stew consistency. Also, this is the first time I made harissa, and I am totally addicted (put on my eggs this morning).

Yawn! Without the Harissa, this tastes like water with cooked vegetables. With the harissa, it tastes like watered down harissa. We were able to salvage it by adding extra bullion and spices, but there are other better bean soups out there. Don't waste your time!

Yum.. Bland without the Harissa (found a recipe for it on the Epicurious -- with Cinnamon Roasted Chicken), very spicy with it.

I didn't think it would be very flavorful because there aren't many spices in the recipe. But it was delicious. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and Tabasco sauce instead of harissa. The only thing I would do differently next time is cook the pasta separately. If you don't eat all of the soup right away, the pasta gets overcooked and mushy. Otherwise, delicious!

This soup was fabulous in its flavor and simplicity- i used barley instead of the orzo, and although it yakes longer to cook, it make the soup extra wholesome and hearty. I also used vegetable broth and the harissa was a good idea.

This is one of my favorite soup recipes though I added one cup (or more) of white wine to the broth and one 15 oz. can of cannellini beans. Quick and easy to prepare and makes great leftovers.

Y.u.m.m.m.y--this soup is so easy and so healthy. I love lima beans and chard, so this was absolutely heaven. Although, the recipe did sound a bit bland so I added lots of rosemary, oregano, thyme, and subsituted an extra cup of broth for one cup of water.an extra cup of chicken broth. And the harissa is a MUST, otherwise the recipe is just too bland. If you can't find harissa, any moroccan/north african condiment will do.

I couldn't find Harissa, but spiced it up with hot pepper. It is a great wintertime soup that would probably be better with a homemade broth. Very healthy, too.
