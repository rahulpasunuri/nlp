I loved the idea of this recipe and the cheesecake was great. The caramel was hard as a rock and could not be cut, though. Any ideas what went wrong? I would love to try it again.

I have made this recipe two times already, me and the people I made it for loved it! the only thing I would change about it is add a little bit of ricotta cheese to make it fluffier because cheesecake can be a little dense especially with the toffee topping. Otherwise, YUM! and will totally make again

Made for Thanksgiving 2012: good but not great cheesecake; baked for 1 hour 5 minutes and it was overdone; used all of caramel topping which wasn't a problem since it stayed on top since it was still in the pan; made 1 1/2 times recipe of crust since I like to have the crust going up the sides

This cheesecake was absolutely fabulous! It baked perfectly even, did not crack, and was so creamy! My chef husband was very impressed. Nobody ate the other desserts at thanksgiving! This recipe will definitely be made again.

Brought it to a BBQ and all 8 adults LOVED it. Not only is it delicious, but the presentation is quite impressive. I followed the recipe and had no problems. I did dribble a little caramel over the sides because I like that look, and put some heath dust and stood ginger snap pieces in the middle. I did have too much caramel, but I'll just save it for something else. My husband, who said that he wouldn't have a piece because he doesn't do dessert anymore, not only had a piece, but continues to talk about how good it was and that was probably the best dessert I've ever made, and I've made A LOT over the years!

Not being a fan of gingersnaps, I used a box of Lorna Dunnes instead, the water bath method gave the cheesecake a wonderfull creamy texture without being too heavy. This was a simple to follow recipe that had people convinced I was a pro.

Delicious and decadent! For a thinner cheesecake: make 5/8 of the filling and 2/3 of crust and topping, and bake for only 35-40 minutes in an 8-inch pie pan.

Rating: 3
This was yummy, but still a little denser than I think is ideal, which is why I've rated in three stars. The caramel sauce is very lovely, though strangely not too sweet. I used only about 2/3rds of the caramel sauce but wish I had put all of it on.

Made this for Christmas and it was spectacular. The carmel sauce is to die for. I followed the recipe as stated, except instead of using Heath bar chips on top I just sprinkled with a little flaked sea salt. Got the salty carmel thing going and it was so good. I had a little carmel leftover and I saved it for ice cream. The texture of the cheese cake and the toffee flavor are wonderful, but the carmel sauce is the best. You won't ever want store bought carmel sauce again.

This is an excellent cheesecake. I make it 1.5 times larger in a 12" spring form pan. If your caramel is a little grainy just stir in a table spoon of butter as its cooling. It will smooth right out!

Absolutely amazing cheesecake. This is only the 2nd time I've made cheesecake, and I was nervouse about doing a water bath as no one I know has ever done it that way before. There was not one morsel left of this dessert on Christmas. Will definitely make again.

Every year I search and search for the perfect recipe to make, hardly ever making the same cheesecake twice. This one will be the exception to the rule. This was incredible! I didn't use all the caramel on the cheesecake like others suggested. I put it in a small container for those to add more if they wanted additional caramel on thier piece. The texture is amazing. I plan to change up the topping - maybe chopping up a twix, snickers bar or my favorite - take five candy bar with the pretzel in it to make it a salty/sweet treat. Try this, you won't be dissappointed.

I'm making this recipe for coworkers, and one of them is diabetic, so my goal is to make this sugar free. Does anybody know whether making the caramel sauce is possible with stevia instead of sugar?

Rating: 4
I have made this cheesecake so many times I am almost tired of making it but have constant requests to make for various special occasions. A couple of changes to try if you are in the mood to experiment is to use dark brown sugar and/or toast pecans with sea salt rather than adding the toffee for a little salt to counteract the very sweet cheesecake and caramel.

Rating: 4
This is a great cheese cake to make for those who love sweets. The cake is nice and creamy but the caramel and the toffee make it exceptionally sweet. This cake is also great for Birthdays, "parties" or casual get-togethers. I think next time thought I will use less of the caramel.

Not being a fan of gingersnap I substituted with Lorna Doones to make a shortbread crust. I also followed other rewiew recommendations and only used about half of the caramel sauce which was more than enough. The cheesecake was wonderfully creamy, and a huge hit.

I followed this recipe to a T; ingredients, measurements and baking times. The cheesecake turned out beautifully. Be aware, however, that this is an incredibly sweet and rich tasting cheesecake. The ginger snap crust was a welcome change from the traditional graham craker crust. Overall, great dessert, but a touch too sweet for me, personally. If you have a huge sweet tooth, then this is your cheesecake!

I made this for Easter and received rave reviews. The caramel is a bit tricky to make (it took us 5 tries actually). Instead of using the toffee we sprinkled salt for a salted caramel cheesecake. INCREDIBLE! If the caramel is too much for you, of if it doesn't work the cheese cake is great on its own too. Using brown sugar instead of white sugar adds a more complex flavor that's fantastic.

I am in awe of how well this cheesecake turned out! It is so fluffy and light - not dry, didn't crack and wasn't heavy. It is so wonderfully smooth and creamy, each bite is heavenly. I followed all of the instructions, only swapping gingersnaps for graham crackers (personal preference). The only change I would make next time is to make half the amount of caramel - though I'm sure we won't have any problems finishing off all the extra. I did add some salt to my caramel as well - I don't like things too sweet. I won't ever look for another cheesecake recipe - this is a winner in my book!

I have been making this cheesecake for the holidays since it first appeared! My nephew, who is not a little guy, tries to hide it so he can have the whole thing to himself!!! It is by far and away the best cheesecake ever!! Just make sure and watch the caramel closely so it doesn't burn and you are good to go! Make sure and have some Granny Smith apples on hand to dip in the extra caramel!!

This cheesecake was a great hit for our family Christmas dinner. I read the reviews before making it and took some hints from others. The poor reviews seemed to be from people who didn't follow the recipe. I made the caramel sauce-it turned out perfectly. Used about 2/3 on the cheesecake and saved the rest to add to each slice. I had some left over and used it on ice cream sundays two days later. I can't imagine using jarred sauce-it has a distinctly processed flavor in the best of circumstances.

Cheesecake looked wonderful, tasted great but very difficult to serve - the caramel was thick and sticky - will make it again but will be more diligent when cooking the caramel and probably use less of it on the cheesecake

Rating: 4
Easy to make and delicious. I only used 2 Heath bars and it was plenty. One important thing to note is that you need to crush the lumps out of the packed brown sugar prior to creaming it with your cream cheese. The mixer beaters don't do it. I saw that my batter was looking lumpy and squished it out with my hands. Next time, I'll do it before it is mixed.

This has become a "go to" recipe in my house. Everyone who trys it loves it. Not that difficult to make and tastes great.

I have made this cheesecake many times....my family and co-workers say this is their favorite. I follow the recipe with the exception of folding two chopped Skor Bars into the batter before baking. I don't use a water bath, although I have a casserole dish with water in the oven during the baking time. Great recipe...this one is a keeper!!

Rating: 3
This was a great caramel cheesecake recipe. I used half graham crackers, half gingersnaps for the crust (and yes, some of the butter did drip out of the crust). I've never been successful with a water bath and a springform pan, so I lowered the oven temp a bit and crossed my fingers - it seemed to work fine. I used about half of the caramel sauce (any more would have just run off the sides), and 3 Heath bars was probably 1 too many.

Rating: 4
I read a lot of reviews and found that people had difficulty with part of the recipe, especially the caramel. Please read my reply and helpful hints : ) I have made home made caramel about 10 years back, so I don't have a large experience in it. That being said... I followed the directions, it came out perfect! If you have hard stiff caramel, you cooked it too long, OBVIOUSLY. While you are stirring it you will check for the consistency. A TRICK... Take a Clear tall glass of cold water, as the caramel is thickening simply drop a drip of it into the water, if it falls apart, cook longer. If it stays in a ball, get it off the heat, you're done. Don't let the ball get too stiff, you do want a slight softness to the caramel, so that when you cut the piece and serve it starts to ooze its creaminess over the sides, just slightly. Tip, you can buy heath bar tid bits in a bag if you don't want the chocolate. Another Tip, I didn't have a spring form pan on the beginning, I used a large heavy metal pan, placed within a pan (like double boiler while cooking) I raised the crust edging up along the sides & poured in the filling. It was THE BOMB! This recipe is sooo yummeriffic, my girlfriend bought two spring form pans, so her and I are making two more this weekend Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/review/preview/Toffee-Crunch-Caramel-Cheesecake-231417#ixzz0jz5fDeBD

As I bake alot, I did not bother with the water bath, rather, when baking cheesecakes, put an ovenproof dish of water in oven when baking to create a moist oven. It turned out wonderful...would use a bit less caramel sauce...I think a drizzle is enough. Great cheesecake texture.

Wow, this was beyond amazing. As people were taking their first bites, they were stopping to talk with their mouths full to tell me how great this was. In my house were 3 people that didnt like cheesecake but were trying it to be polite to the hostess. They couldnt stop eating it and telling me how much they loved it. The caramel ran off the sides, never thickened enough. Due to that, the presentation was lacking a bit, but the flavor, WOW. I even think it was better the 2nd and 3rd day.

I made a cookie crust. & worried about the reviews about cheesecake part, so decided to make my favorite New York style Cheesecake recipe and made the caramel crunch topping and all turned out great. I think you have to be somewhat familiar with making candy, perhaps you might use a candy thermometer to be sure not to over cook.It's important to brush sides down with wet pastry brush (I use a high quality sm.trim sizepaint brush) at the beginning of process while your melting the sugar & then stop stirring or it will sugar. Then you must watch it closely, if too short cooking time will be runny, too long (which may be just 1-2 minutes too long & it will be too hard. So I altered this alotfrom the recipe but turned out yummy. So saying no to making it again because this is really not this recipe

This is very good! I made exactly as instructed, but didn't mess up the caramel only because I've made it before. Go to the foodnetwork site and look up Ina Garten's caramel sauce recipe, it's got great instructions. Make the caramel sauce yourself, it's worth it!

I had to use a 10 inch pan or else it would have been to full. I also heated the cream before I added it to prevent the boil over mess. I will add more cream next time to make the caramel not so stiff.

This is wonderful. I made it exactly as written. Don't trade out the gingersnap crust, the flavors as- is work perfectly. I did have to make the caramel sauce twice, as the first time I followed the directions and let the caramel turn auburn before putting in the cream, but once it reduced to 1 1/4 cups it tasted burnt. The second time, I added the cream when the caramel first started showing signs of darkening and by the time it reduced it was perfect. My boyfriend said it was a 'definite winner' and I brought leftovers to work and the whole thing is gone!

I was able to fix the overly thick and grainy caramel sauce by adding one more cup of heavy cream.The recipe should say 2 cups of heavy cream instead of one.The cake is in need of a little more sugar. I didn't put the toffee anymore but I was adding more caramel on every spoon of the cake I eat.

Rating: 1
I made this cake because it was rated 4 stars.But I wonder why?It isn't the smooth,silky cheesecake that I am used to. I tend to reduce the sugar on most of my recipes but this one needs more sugar! How much do I pack the brown sugar in my measuring cup? Maybe I should use a hammer...And the caramel sauce is difficult to perfect. I cooled my caramel sauce in the pan and it came out grainy and thick. I will add more cream to thin it down and hopefully it will turn smooth. But I will not put it on the cheesecake til I'm sure it won't harden and turn my mediocre cheesecake to a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!

OK I'm back again since I've served this cheesecake and I have to say it was "da bomb". Served it to my office nad EVERYBODY said that it was the best cheesecake they've ever had! Even my assistant said, "Make sure you're sitting down when you eat this.." So I guess what I like and what the masses like are a little different? 5 forks then when it comes to mass appeal and success.

I would say that this recipe is OK. I baked it for a colleague's birthday - I used a 9 x 7 inch rectangular pan. Baking was shortened to 55 mins. I used dark brown sugar (from another review) with the hopes to make more of a caramel flavour. It's ok. I can imagine how the regular brown sugar can be bland as per other reviews. I used Whole Foods Caramel sauce because I didn't feel like messing with the caramel. I think the Heath put it over the top of being way too sweet! I would reduce it down to just one Heath bar or maybe two. I thinka sprinkle of chopped up heath coated in nuts would be better to cut the sweet - you can find these in a bake shop or a gourmet wine and cheese store. I would not rush out to make this recipe again anytime soon.

Rating: 4
Aside from being gorgeous, this cheesecake is fabulous. The gingerbread crust is a lovely combination with the Heath bar topping. Caramel can be a bit tricky to make - you must be diligent with the pastry brush and water otherwise it will be overdone; which is why the previous reviewer complained of the topping being too hard. MAKE IT, you won't regret it.

There are two things I make very well and that people request; cookies and cheescake. So, when my son asked that I make this for his birthday I agreed. I followed the recipe to a T. The ginger crust was overpowering. It was not good. The cake itself was good but the texture was off. It was not what I'm used to. The caramel sauce was the big issue though. I did exactly what the recipe said and it looked gorgeous. I poured the sauce over the cake and put it in the fridge to cool. When we went to ge the cake we had a solid rock of caramel covering the cake. We had to break it off. I wish I had just bought caramel sauce instead of making it because it was a disaster. I have no idea what I could have done differently. I'm going back to my normal cheesecake recipe which is always a hit and has a creamier texture. If my son wants caramel or toffee we'll just buy it and he can add that to his slice.

I have made this cheesecake about 10 times and have never had a bad review. Friends ask that I make it for any type of dinner that I host (and that they are hosting as well). The carmel can be tricky to get thick enough, so on occassion I purchase carmel sauce, and I always cover the entire top with Heath Bars to get an added crunch and toffee flavor.

Rating: 4
Made crust and filling exactly as written, but followed other reviewers recommendations and used bottled sauce for the topping (had guests coming and didn't want to risk problems with the toffee). Cake is exceptional and I will definitely try making my own caramel topping next time. I was a little uneasy about putting the hot cake in the refrigerator as recipe says, but it worked ok for the most part. The top did crack, so I will run a knife around the sides of the pan next time. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 4
This is probably the best cheesecake I've ever made. I did a graham cracker crust instead of the gingersnap. The caramel sauce took a very watchful eye. You don't want to take it too far (dark) because it will burn. I sprinkled the entire cheesecake top with the candy. I will make it over and over again!

Rating: 4
Really really good. I used this recipe but made it into mini cheesecakes. I had to double the crust ingredients but left the filling as is. This made 24 cheesecakes in regular muffin tins. I also bought prepared caramel sauce to cut down on time and used 6 skor bars. Everybody loved them.

Delicious! I didn't quite understand the importance of tightly wrapping the pan - my crust ended up a little soggier than I had hoped, I didn't realize that it had to bake IN the water until I had already submerged the pan. I ended up only using 3 bars - and it was plenty sweet and crunchy enough. I will definitely make this again, it was a big hit!

I am a very adept baker, but this was my first cheesecake. I think I may have overcooked it, because it was a tad dry. It didn't ever crack, so maybe I am just not a fan of this cheescake. I wished it to be lighter and fluffier. The topping was great in flavour, but I agree with other reviewers who suggest store bought caramel sauce. The toffee hardened up, not brittle, but chewy, so it seperated from the cheesecake when cool- or try a butterscotch sauce, of butter, brown suger and heavy cream instead. The gingersnap crust was great though, it would be perfect with a light lemon cheesecake.

I have made this twice--once for Christmas, once for a friend's birthday. Both times received RAVE reviews. Mine cracked a bit the second time, but the caramel covered that up nicely.

This is a fantastic recipe and also relatively simple! This is not, however, a recipe for those that want a firm cake. After reading some reviews claiming that their cake fell apart, I read some other recipes and decided to add another 4oz of cream cheese and 3tbsp of flour and mine came out perfectly fine. The topping is a bit tricky, but it just has to be monitored constantly. The heat should be lowered and the cream added about 10 seconds after the sugar begins to turn a darker colour. I think the term 'dark amber' is a bit misleading. If I waited for it to turn dark amber, it would have burned and hardened. Though, I would probably make 1/2 the amount of topping next time - there was loads left over. I also added about a 1/2 tsp of fresh nutmeg and cinnamon to the crust to give it some extra spice. I would definitely make it again!

Rating: 4
The recipe is time consuming and very complex. However, very worth the work. It's a fantastic cheesecake recipe. I had to substitute the vanilla extract for a dash of rum extract because I didn't have any left. Unexpectedly, it game a more lemony taste to the recipe. I will definitely make again.

Every year my husband and I make a "cake" of the other's choice for their Feb birthday. In 2007 he requested cheesecake, so I made this recipe. He is always a fan of my cooking, but he was floored and LOVED IT saying it could rival any patisserie or restaurant in the city. I have made it only 3 times since for a beach picnic and parties (he can't be too spoiled afterall) and this is what I have learned: 3 layers of foil is a must around the pan when water bathing; Take out the crust even if you don't think it's done - it continues to harden; Horrors, I know, but I use store-bought caramel sauce in lieu of making my own; I find 1 Heath or Skor bar is enough (Toffee bits also works in a pinch) I took the advice of another reader and mixed a few bits in the batter which is also very nice; the quality of gingersnap is important... I seem to struggle to find a good brand, but the more ginger-y and less hard (not soft) the better. Pop the cookies in to the food processor and viola; making this in advance is fine, though if it is not made and consumed within 4 days, the crust tends to get a bit soft, though the husband does not mind it that way. The caramel is the factor that can make this sweet, so either use sparingly or cut in small pieces. To this "Cake's" cred he has requested it again this year...

excellent cheesecake. light and beautiful in presentation. i used a 10" springform, added 1/2 more cup of gingersnaps to fill the bottom but no additional butter. also, next time would use just 1/2 the amount for the carmel glaze as we had too much and it ran down. didn't have toffee, used pretty pecan halves around the edge. this was a big hit on new years eve!

To those who critcised.Permit me to tell them,This was a perfectly standard cheese cake basic recipe.I am a french pastry chef.I didnt find that there was too much sugar.Im assuming that 1 "packed" cup represented 500 grams, because i work by weight.If you found it too sweet, then it was from the caramel.In that case, do what another reader did, she topped with blueberries or any other fruit you like.If you do want the caramel, then here are some suggestions.Caramel can be "blonde" or "dark".for the topping, somewhere in between is probably what you should go for.add a bit of water to the sugar, and mix before you put it on the burner.Med Heat is preferable.U wont stress out.Stir and watch it.It will become golden and start to darken.watch carefully.you choose the darkenss you want, and at exactly that point you add the liquid.Now here is where you can actually choose the flavour of the caramel,orange, lemon,whatever,the sugar will become one sticky mass.turn down heat, and stir till all dissolved, then up the heat, and thicken slowly.Trust me you will never be disappointed.Remembe r pastry requires precision, patience,and artistry.There are also interesting combination of cream cheeses you could use etc.just use your imagination.and make sure you balance liquids and solids...good luck

As others had said, the taste of the cheesecake was quite flat. I made mini-cheesecakes, so for my second batch I added some almond extract to the mix and a bit of coffee.

Before i made this cake i read all of the reviews. They were very helpful as to learn from the experiences people had while making this cake. I wasnt sure why the water basin was necesary and found out that it stops the cake from cracking. Another method is to leave the cake in the oven to cool with the oven door ajar. This worked perfectly. I could not find gingersnap cookies so used regular butter biscuits but did not bake the crust first. I found that this helped stop the base from sticking. I did wrap the springform tin with aluminium foil. I baked the cake for one hour at 180 degrees celcius which was perfect. Let the cake stand in the fridge overnight. For the caramel sauce I dissolved the sugar in the water until it became just golden and then added the cream and left over heat for another two or three minutes. I then put the sauce aside to cool. It became very thick and then added some more cream to thin it out enough to pour on to the cake. I dont want to brag but it came out just like the picture and tasted even better. I an going to make it again for a party this weekend. For suggestions contact me on trekmyers@yahoo.com.au

All over the bottom of the oven while baking, all over the counter while cooling, and the pans ended up glued to the refrigerator shelf-and this is with layers of foil on the outside of the pans and using a baking sheet. I agree the stickiness is a problem while removing from the pans. I greased the pans in preparation to no avail. At any rate, it tastes great if you can deal with all of that. I added a layer of Heath bits to the cake before baking and used store bought caramel sauce with Heath bits sprinkled on top. Looked great, tasted great.

I have made this twice now. It gets rave reviews and is very impressive, but beware, it is a lot of work! There are two things I have learned and wanted to pass on: 1. The thinner the ginger snaps, the better. I really like the brand Carriage Trade (in the box). 2. The crust will not be "firm" as the recipe states when it comes out of the oven!! It only needs ten minutes and even if it looks and feels soft and looks buttery, take it out!! It will harden out of the oven, and if it doesn't, you can always put it back in, but you cannot take it back if you overcook it! Great cheesecake.

Definitely a winner! Thanks for the suggestion about vanilla in the carmel -- absolutely add some, it makes a huge difference. I added the cream to the carmel just as it started to turn color and the final color is perfect. My cake took longer to bake than specified.

A very rich cheesecake! But aren't they all?? After reading earlier comments, here's some adjustments I made: For the crust, I needed more butter for the 7-1/4 oz of gingersnaps (might not have been a problem if I had measured 1-1/2 cups instead?); then I had plenty to also go up the sides of the pan. I didn't pre-bake the crust -- it almost always turns out as hard as a brick when I do that. I had no problem with it being hard or sticking. Just for kicks, I stirred in some of the Heath bits into the batter -- maybe that's what made it so rich!! On the caramel, definitely watch for the "amber" and don't let it go too far, it will taste burnt. After stirring in the cream (and I think it could stand a little vanilla, too), cook it to 220 degrees on a candy thermometer. This will give you just the right consistency. Very impressive desert, I didn't have a crumb left over!

my grandmother used to make a cheesecake like this years ago. I started making a cheesecake similar to this recipe in 1982. This still holds true to great taste. For the person who said the caramel tasted burnt, when cooking sugar, you have to be very careful. using the water method is time consuming, but with good results. The one and most important thing, is that you can not leave it and turn away, especially when it is turning brown or caramalizing. As soon as you see the sugar turning dark, swirl the pan gently and remove from heat if you have too. If the caramel gets too dark it will taste burnt. When you remove the sugar from the heat, the sugar will get a little darker from the residule heat.

I have made this cake a numerous times. Each time it comes out better than the time before. I did make some changes and the one rave I got was on the crust. I made a Cheerios type crust. I crushed up a lot of cheerios and substituted them for the gingersnaps/graham cracker crust, you may have to use your own judgement on how much of a crust you want and go accordingly. One person wanted to scrape off the cheesecake mixture and eat just the crust. But everyone loves this Cheesecake complete or just the crust! I have made up over 20 copies of this recipe to place in various parts of my kitchen as I had to call the home office to get the original, as my husband (yes, still) threw out my magazine that this recipe was in.

this cake was ok. maybe im just not much of a cheesecake person? I used graham crackers instead of gingersnaps due to lack of time. I multuplied the crust recipe by 1.5, and there still was very minimal crust. the cheese layer was nothing special, maybe a bit bland. and the toffee, although cooked perfectly, tasted burnt. I made it for my dads b-day. he said it was excellent, though he is my dad, and a cheesecake lover. so maybe its just my bias opinion?

Rating: 3
Very tasty. It got rave reviews from my coworkers since I didn't want to eat the entire cheesecale myself. I had to add more water than called for since the sugar was taking so long to melt for the sauce, and it made the sauce a little too thin. But the sauce did stay on top long enough for everyone to scarf down the cheesecake. My very first one too!

This was fabulous. I used Trader Joe's triple ginger snaps--yummy! I did not have time to look for those special candy bars, so I just used small pieces of "lace" cookies (chocolate/nuts). Fantastic! Next time I will follow the instructions to use THREE layers of foil to wrap around the pan before immersing it in water. I didn't, and a little water seeped in and softened the crust in one place. No real damage, but it could have been worse. This is the most delicious and "dramatic" cheesecake I have ever made.

Rating: 4
This is the best cheesecake. I've had rave reviews from it and even a request from a neighbor to make it for her Christmas Eve party. The only change I made is using a chocolate wafer crust and putting the toffee all over the top. Also, to remember if you are making the caramel during rainy weather you'll need to cook the caramel longer otherwise it doesn't set up as firm. This is a keeper!!

This was a wonderful dessert! I used high quality bottled caramel sauce to avoid the burning issue, and put a layer of the toffee bars in the middle of the cheesecake. It was delicious!

I made it for thanksgiving and everyone loved it, although, it is extremely rich and you cant have a lot of it. I think it might have been the gingersnap crust. Although it is a very good idea to use gingersnaps, it was a little much.

I loved this cheescake.You can freeze the caramel for 5 minutes to set up faster.Put the carmel in a liquid measure to pour/spoon easier.I made this for my husbands work.

I found that boiling the caramel without knowing to what temperature, caused the caramel to get too hard. It was then almost impossible to cut through and the whole top almost slide off the cheesecake at serving time. I ended up throwing out the leftovers as people were too polite to say that it was a dud recipe.

My family loved this cheesecake. I didn't have any problems with overbaking - it did crack while cooling, so next time I'll run the knife around the edge of the pan before I put it in the refrigerator. Based on the comments on the crust, I lined the bottom of my pan with parchment, and it released beautifully. As for the topping...it's only the second time I've tried making caramel, and there is obviously a trick I'm missing. I didn't use the times suggested in the recipe - I watched for the amber color (stopped well before scorching), and cooked after adding the cream until it was reduced to 1-1/4 cups. The top was so hard that I tried 2 different knives (neither worked - I needed a chisel), and the cake looked awful on the plates, but the taste was fantastic! I'm thinking now that reducing it as far as it says is just to much - maybe 1-3/4 cups or even 1-1/2 cups would be less Sugar Daddy-ish.

This was well received at Easter, and something I would definitely make again. I did make a few small changes, however; I used toffee bits in the actual cheesecake, used purchased caramel sauce on the top, and covered the top of the cheesecake with more toffee bits. I didn't find it too sweet it at all--and there was only one slice left at the end of the meal! :)

made this for my husbands b-day party. very big hit with his family. to avoid other reviewers problems i added 1 tbsp more butter to crust to prevent sticking, decided to go with my standard caramel sauce recipe (found on this site with the sticky toffee pudding). and i added a layer of toffee bits in the middle of the cheesecake. presentation and taste were excellent.

I made this for the first time this weekend and everyone loved it! I must say, I too had problems with the crust sticking, and burnt the caramel the first time around. I re-made the caramel but did not focus on the time so much, and went more by feel and it came out wonderful. I am attending a birthday party this weekend and will be making it again!

I baked this for the specified time and according to the look as directed. However, the next day when cut - it was still a bit runny in the middle. Other recipes I have used cook until a certain temperature (usually 160 degrees) so that may have been a better method. I also made the caramel, but it hardened on the top of the cheesecake so cutting the cheesecake with the hard caramel and the oozy center was almost impossible. Everyone liked the taste (not really any raves), but they did love the gingersnap crust - I made the gingersnaps with an old recipe. This wasn't worth the effort - even if the center wasn't gooey, I think overall it was just too sweet.

This Cheesecake is definitely over the top! I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I did have a problem with the crust sticking to the pan, so would also be sure to use non-stick spray.

I have made this a couple of times and it has been delicious both times. The first time I did have a problem with the crust sticking to my calphalon springform pan so the second time I made the cheesecake I sprayed the bottom of my springform with a cooking spray and it worked beautifully. Everyone who has tried this cheesecake just loves it. I did make the caramel sauce in the recipe and I have to admit the first time it got a little scorched. So I would recommend watching it very closely when cooking go by color and taste not strictly by the time the recipe calls for. This is a delicious cheesecake!

Rating: 4
Great with easy chages. Graham cracker crumbs, instead of gingersnaps, with only a 5 minute, pre-bake. Then I a 1/2 a jar of Mrs. Richardson's Butterscoth Caramel topping, instead of making the topping. Out of this world!

I made this for a party and was disappointed. I thought the cake lacked flavor and it seemed heavy. I guess that's a matter of taste. I was frightened by some of the comments regarding the topping so I drizzled purchased caramel sauce on top. I generally don't make changes to a recipe. All in all, lacking!

Rating: 3
I thought this was a really good cheesecake, but very sweet. My caramel sauce turned out fine, didn't get hard as others said. However, I did not use it all and used much less candy than the recipe called for to top the cheesecake. One of my guests even had seconds. I will make this again. It was really pretty with the sauce covering the top, but because it was so sweet I may only drizzle with the sacue next time.

I have made this cheesecake several times. It has been the hit of the party. The first time I accidentally put almond extract instead of the called for vanilla. It was such a hit that I'm still using the almond extract. I also added some chopped pecans to the crust.

Best cheesecake I've ever eaten. Couple things about the recipe, though: The cheesecake took way less than 1 hour 10 minutes to bake. I checked it after 1 hour and the top was starting to brown. Fortunately it was still perfect but it had me scared for a moment. Secondly, four Skor bars is WAY too much candy. I chopped up three and only ended up using maybe half of what I had cut up. Third, and this was probably due to something I did and not the recipe, the crust stuck to the bottom of my brand-new calphalon springform pan and not the cheesecake itself. But all in all, incredibly delicious, absolutely worth the time and effort. Yum!!

My mother made this and she, too, had problems with the caramel. The first batch burned in an instant (as someone else said) and the second batch didn't quite thicken enough. Maybe if you reduce the cream by 1/4 cup? While serving it, she said she wouldn't make it again, then we tasted it and it's fabulous... so as we say in our family, "It's a keeper!"

I have made this a few times but use a different cheesecake recipe. The topping is GREAT but I too had problems with the caramel hardening.

This is delicious, however, the carmel topping on the top when refridgerated is very difficult to cut through. You almost need an electric knife! This causes presentation problems. I think next time I make it I will drizzle the plate with carmel and maybe a little over the cheesecake at serving time. Otherwise fantastic flavor.

I had problems with the caramel topping. I cooked it to reduce to 1 1/4 cups, and it was like hard candy. I made another batch of caramel and cooked it much less time. Don't know if I would make again, but it turned out well. I think the directions, or proportions are incorrect

I made the cheesecake for Christmas. The recipe was very easy to follow. I did vary the recipe a bit, I did not use the water method, I never do and the results were picture perfect -- we almost didn't want to slice it! All my family and friends were raving about it for weeks, and I have even received many requests to make it again. I used grahm cracker crust instead, because I didn't have gingersnaps on hand. I also left out the toffee bar topping, the caramel was just right and not too sweet. Again, this was the BEST cheesecake EVERY!!!

What a disaster this was. I have made 100's of cheesecakes (used to have a business selling them), so I know what I'm doing. This way overbakes the cake and I had a huge deep "x" break through the centre. Here is a tip for fool proof, smooth cheesecake: Bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. Remove from oven. After 10 minutes, run a knife around the outside edge. Allow to come to room temperature and then refridgerate overnight. No breaks! Also, toffee burned in an instance. Giving temperature guidelines and using a candy thermometer would have gone a long way to improving this. Had to use store bought sauce because toffee was not good.

Everyone raved about this cheesecake. My crust stuck, too, even though my pan was non-stick. I used Heath Bar baking bits that can be found in the baking aisle near the chocolate chips. My only advice is to keep a close eye on the caramel as it gets close to completion - I had to toss a batch that I overcooked when I got distracted with other tasks in the kitchen.

We liked this very much--leftovers were equally good a few days later. I made two changes based on leftovers from Christmas baking. I used the last of the ginger cookies for the crust and my own English toffee for the topping. The toffee recipe is from my ancient Betty Crocker Cookbook from the 60s--better than Heath Bars by a long measure. Incorporating the homemade cookies and candy was really a plus.

I made this to rave reviews for a New Year's Eve dinner party. And I had a lot to live up to once I promised the cover recipe from Bon Appetit! My crust didn't stick to the pan, although I had my usual problem of a little water seeping in. I have finally purchased extra wide heavy duty foil for all future cheesecakes - if you like to make cheesecakes, it is worth the investment. Some reviewers weren't fond of the cheesecake recipe, but I really liked that it was less sweet than usual - otherwise the caramel and heath bars would have made it too sweet. I found that my grocery stores here have stopped carrying individual candy bars but I was able to find Heath bars at a 7-11. I will definitely make this cheesecake again... and again... my new favorite! My old favorite was Coconut Fudge Cheesecake from this site, also a winner!

I've had a hard time finding Heath bars in grocery stores too. But now I know that you can find Heath Bars at any CVS drug store in PA & NY. They are usually right in the front with the rest of the candy by the cash registers.

The cheesecake is delicious, but I had the same problem as another reviewer ... the crust stuck to the bottom of the pan. I think next time I will invert the bottom of my springform pan, and possibly try lining it with parchment. If that fails, I'll try a regular graham cracker crust. Toffee baking bits are an excellent substitute for impossible to find Skor or Heath bars.

I can only rate this as 2 forks as I only loved half of it. The topping was fantastic, maybe one of the best I've had! The cheesecake itself was not really worth eating without the topping though. I would suggest maybe finding a good NY Cheesecake basic recipe and put the caramel on top.

Made this cheesecake and caramel topping with absolutely no problems for a football party. I forget to cover the pan with foil during the first crust bake. It turned out a bit hard on the bottom. I followed the recipe exactly for the caramel topping and it turned out perfect, even with some leftover for ice cream. The parents and adults both loved it. I had to substitute Hershey's Symphony bar with toffee and almonds because after checking 6 convenience stores and grocery stores I gave up looking for Heath or Skor bars. I think they must not be popular in my area! I baked in a 9" pan with no problems (same time and temp).

I gave four forks because most of my guests said it was the best cheesecake they had ever eaten. However I make many cheesecakes, and someone usually makes the same comment, possibly because they are accustomed to instant versions or purchased cheesecakes only? But it was very tasty, though not as large as others, only using four packages of cream cheese and baking in an 8 inch pan. I had twelve guests, including children and there wasn't a morsel leftover. However, I did have caramel and toffee leftover after using as much as possibly atop the cake. The caramel was perfect, a beautiful texture, and I had no problems with it hardening.

I've made this twice now. Loved the caramel topping but not the cheeseake itself so just made my favorite cheesecake recipe and used this topping.

Great flavor though.

Best cheesecake ever, wonderful mix of flavours with the ginger crust and caramel. Easy enough to put together, my caramel dripped down the sides but I liked it that way.
