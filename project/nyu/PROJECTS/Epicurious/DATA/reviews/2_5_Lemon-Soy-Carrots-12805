I gave it three after some changes -mostly because it was SO easy. I substitued orange juice for the lemon and threw in a tiny dash of cayenne pepper to give it a touch of heat. Also, I didn't use the butter. After they cooked I seasoned with pepper/salt. A good, simple recipe for using up carrots on a weekday night.

I used this to accompany an oriental chicken recipe & thought it was missing something. The next night we had leftover chicken so I played with this... drizzled carrots with a bit of olive oil, brown sugar & soy sauce and microwaved... way more what I was looking for.

This is a very nice accompaniment for many dishes that we like. I just shake a bag of baby carrots into a microwave dish until it looks like enough, add the other ingredients and zap! A great result for the amount of work.

We found this to be so blah - no life to it! I have become so expectant from this forum that I was sorely disappointed. I can do better with my own imagination.

I've made this several times to accompany both steak and chicken. It's easy and tastes great. I definitely recommend it.

These carrots were pretty good. I forgot to add the butter at the end, but they tasted fine. Sauce was really good on rice.
