I couldn't find sherry vinegar so i used red wine. I also amended the recipe to 1/3 c olive oil and 1/3 cup vinegar like the below recommendations. It was fantastic.

I had never had gazpacho before and decided to give this recipe a try for guests. Fabulous!! I followed advice from prior reviews and increased the vinegar to 1/3 cup and reduced the oil to 1/3 cup. I put the ingredients in my food processor in batches then ran that through my food mill. The resulting texture is wonderful. I made the first batch for company and the second for myself!

We had to use red tomatoes and orange bell peppers. The flavor was very nice although something seemed slightly out of balance. I would try this once again and hopefully with the original ingredients (they were not available and in this market may not ever be available). As a previous reviewer noted, separating the skins of the tomatoes and bell peppers using a fine sieve did not work; the soup was too thick to move through the sieve. We used a salad spinner, which had larger holes, instead to remove the largest chunks (without spinning, I might add); this helped a lot in terms of removing the skins/odd bits.

Perfect and refreshing for a light lunch. Beautiful to look at too! I served it with crusty bread and cheese.

Good recipe. Easy. Added in some Cumin which worked well. Whole Foods let me down having no heirlooms, but some of their over-ripe hothouse tomatoes worked great.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! Perfect for summer. I served it in little shot glasses as an amuse.

This was a great easy gazpacho. Heirloom tomatoes are a must. No reason to overcomplicate things -- just use great tomatoes and it's a summer hit . . . .

so good! i used all variety of heirloom tomatoes, 1 red bell pepper along with 1 yellow, added some crunchy bread slices to make it more authentic, and 2 cloves of garlic because i like that. super fabulous. the perfect summer soup that I will eat all season long.

I had to use red tomatoes (winter in Canada), but it was still amazing. We tried passing the soup through a sieve, but all we were left with was a very thin watery juice. So we dumped the solids back in and created a wonderful gazpacho. Flavour is refreshing, different, and delicious!

Loved the yellow gazpacho, it took me right back to Spain! I used yellow heirloom tomatoes that I found at the farmer's market, rather than beefsteak tomatoes. I substituted dried shallots instead for onions, and used chile peppers instead of hot sauce. I forgot to get an orange, so I tossed in a little OJ. Rather than a blender and sieve, my food processor did the trick. Served with homemade sangria...simply delicious!!

I loved making and serving this dish. I made it exactly as the recipe was written, substituting only yellow heirlooms tomatoes and using a food mill on med mesh for a little more texture. I served a dab of Red Rooster sauce on the side with the garnishes for those who wanted it more spicy. One of my guests said he generally didn't like soups, but he love this one.

Fabulous again. This year I had a load of Striped German tomatoes (I think, giant but not pure yellow) and orange peppers so got a somewhat warmer looking soup. I seeded peppers and cleaned orange very well and found that our very powerful blender did such a good job it seemed pointless to seive. Forgot the tobasco but the result was still luscious.

I gave three stars as this was my first try on gazpacho. My only deviation from the recipe is that I used only 1/4 Cup of olive oil. And I have to say, we could definitely taste the oil, and I would even use one tablespoon less next time. I used big yellow beefsteaks from my garden, and measured everything. I went out and bought the sherry vinegar especially and after tasting it, I can't imagine using anything else. I found a good orange, not easy in August, and also used the zest. And sea salt, because I think iodized salt would impart too much of a chemical taste to the delicate tomatoes. Also, I did run it through a sieve so as to remove residual seeds and skins.

Had this at the Metroplitan Museum of Art in NYC, at the Petrie Court Cafe. Loved it and made it at home the next day. To achieve the texture of the museum recipe, I used a food mill instead of a fine sieve. The soup at the Petrie Court had more texture than my fine sieve allowed.

Made this without the orange but still tasted fabulous. The golden color is wonderful.
