I made this last night. I was cooking for 3 children so I did not use any onion & threw in a hand full of shredded cheese. I made them pretty small & flat. I also used small wheat slider rolls- they were great ! Even my 2 year old liked them!

Moist but tasteless. Made it following the recipe exactly but grilled it over med heat for 12 minutes. I should of known better, turkey burgers are just bad. I am convinced, there is no yummy turkey burger out there. My 2 1/2 year old took one bite and ate his fruits and vegatables instead. Thankfully my husband was out of town!

This was the best turkey burger I've ever made. The onion and bread crumbs give it the juiciness it needs. I think maybe the difference in reviews can be explained by the type of bread crumbs used? I used fresh bread crumbs, which makes all the difference. Dried would have definitely made dry burgers. This is a keeper.

The only change I made was to use way less (1/2 cup total) bread crumbs. The burgers were delicious - very moist. My red-meat husband said that he would definitely eat them regularly.

Yikes -- these burgers tasted exactly like meatloaf! We were very disappointed...but the dog was excited to get the leftovers! :)

These burgers had good flavor, but dry as a bone! I even added an egg after reading others comments. My quest for a great turkey burger continues...

Added an egg. A little more olive oil. Did on the George grill. Very good.

Really excellent burger taste -- the only thing I changed was to add an egg & a little bit more olive oil to ensure moistness, especially because you must cook the turkey meat thoroughly. Result was a very, very tender, tasty burger enjoyed by all, ages 3-31! P.S. I also served with a quick chipotle mayo spread.

These turkey patties were so easy. They were also tasty, plump, and juicy-- even though I accidentally left them on the stove much longer than called for and omitted the cheese. Since the turkey has a rather soft texture, I used crunchy toasted English muffins instead of rolls for contrast.

Very tasty - I'll make this again.

I have to disagree with the other reviewers. The burgers were dry and my family did not enjoy them. Perhaps less breadcrumbs would make a difference.

These were so easy & delicious, & I made them for adults! A local restaurant is famous for their turkey burgers & these were every bit as good. I followed the directions exactly except for using mozzarella instead of cheddar.

Probably the best tasting turkey burgers I have ever had. I could eat them all the time, which is rare considering I prefer meats to poultry. Even if overcooked, the burgers stay moist. A real keeper.

Excellent introduction for new foods for little ones. My 6 year old and 2 year old were both fine with it. Next time I would omit the chopped onion and use onion powder. The 6 year old did not like the chopped onion. Tasty for adults too! Moist and good flavor.

Not only was this kid-friendly, it was adult-friendly as well. The problem with most turkey burgers is that they tend to dry out when you cook them. But in this recipe the fresh bread crumbs and oil gave the burgers nice texture and helped keep the turkey moist. My two year old ate an entire burger on his own. That's how good they are! I grilled the burgers and left out the onions. I think grilling may also have helped keep the burgers moist.

This is one of the best ground turkey recipes I have found. I substituted provolone cheese for the cheddar and added bacon to the sandwiches, because that's what I had on hand and they turned out to be quite good. The burgers themselves were a little dry, but tasty.
