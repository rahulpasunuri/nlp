I'd like to add that this is not just an Italian specialty! My father's family is from Trinidad, and my grandmother always made this dish. We ate it for breakfast with fresh pan fried bread.

I did NOT enjoy the texture of the salt cod. I think if it was fresh cod, it might have been a better dish.

I've been making this for years. I got the recipe from my grandmother who made it every Christmas eve. She was eighty when she died in 1975. Shame on her for ripping off Mario Batali. My point is that Mario Baltali (while a great chef) basically markets what's been tried and proven. He pretty much depends on the naivete of people like those who have posted here to establish his reputation as a culinary visionary.

Does someone actually think Mario Batali came up with this? Please - this is a meditteranian staple especially in Naples and it's been around forever.

Made this a few nights ago: I cut the baccalà a little smaller than in the recipe, and used cayenne pepper instead of flakes, but it was very tasty. Was a *little* too salty but had sauteed some potatoes which absorbed the saltiness. Excellent recipe.

I used well 'desalted' cod, and this was a hit with some non-adventurous eaters. I would note that if you use new hot pepper flakes, the sauce will be HOT.

An easy, quick dinner. I made it with frozen cod, first baking the cod in the oven then adding the rest of the ingredients after sauteing. The family ate it all - no leftovers!

The pepper and capers work nicely to flavor the sauce in this recipe. We paired with an Albarino white which did not compete with the taste and worked well.

This was delicious. From childhood memories, I tend to avoid cod recipe. But my husband bought a bag of frozen fillet. It was not salt cod but it still worked out fine.

This was fantastic; reminds me of christmas back home. I think the reason it is a knock off of a Mario Batali recipe is because it is a Mario Batali recipe.

This is almost a copy of Mario Batali's Baccala All'Amalfi - this recipe just didn't add white wine.

This was such a hit with family and friends at a special party. Will add to our Christmas Eve menu this year. The fish monger told me to soak fish and capers for 1 day only but to add more carpers, which I did.
