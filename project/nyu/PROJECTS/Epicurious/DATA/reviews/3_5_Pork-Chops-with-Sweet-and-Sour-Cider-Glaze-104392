I am very happy with this recipe. I doubled the recipe because I was working with four 2 thick pork loin chops. I did start the apple cider and sugar in a separate pan because I didnt want the pork chop temperature to drop while waiting for the apple cider to come up to temperature. So after the browning stage, I added the hot apple cider and sugar mixture directly to the chops. Im a huge fan of sauces, and wouldnt dream of skipping the vinegar, its what makes the sauce mouth-watering. I did substitute 2:1 dijon mustard for mustard seed because I didnt have any mustard seed. I highly recommend taking the time to let the sauce thicken on its own. I was hungry and willing to eat the chops with the thin sauce after the second cooking stage, but the chops were so thick I had to let them simmer in the final sauce stage for over 10 minutes to bring them up to 150 degrees. Good thing I did, because during that time the sauce caramelized and added a warm complexity to the sauce flavor. My 2.5 year old son, whos dinners normally consist of mac n cheese and hot dogs, finished his pork chop on his own, without us having to remind him to eat his dinner! I think this recipe is worth making again, and I think I will also try it on veggies, turkey, and chicken; if I try it on lamb or steak, I plan to add sour cherries too. Yum!

This was easy and delicious! I did however make a few substitutions: apple juice for the cider and Keen's dry mustard for mustard seed. I also seasoned the pork with a seasoning salt while I was browning it.

Simple, tasty. I thickened the sauce with a bit of cornstarch, because I don't like watery sauce.

This dish was delicious - I used good, fresh organic pork chops and organic apple cider. Served it with the green with apples (as recommended) on top of some garlicky mashed potatoes. Really only took about 20 minutes and looked like a $$ restaurant meal.

Mediocre dish - weak flavors in the glaze. It was fine once but I wouldn't make it again.

We really enjoyed this. I would definitely make it again- however next time I might try grilling the pork chops and making the glaze on its own. Very flavorful

Good weeknight meal. Lots of flavor. I tossed in a couple tsp. of butter at the end to make the sauce a bit richer and liked the addition.

YUM! I liked it, the kids loved it, I'm sure hubby will like it for leftovers tomorrow. Served with white rice (boring, I know, but it's good in a pinch!) and corn. Simple sides but the kiddos gobbled it ALL up. They gave it 4 forks!

Not bad, not great, just somewhat boring but easy. Mustard didn't come through

Fantastic! Sweet and a twinge of sour....we loved it. The 3 year old ate it up too. I doubled the sauce and took a little extra time to reduce, but I turned the heat up and it worked out just fine.

Yum ..... Delicious. Followed recipe, except used Dijon mustard (about a tablespoon). Will certainly make this again.

1 out of 3 did not like it (myself). I thought it was too sweet. The other two people LOVED IT , it was filling, fast, and not greasy. MAKE SURE YOU USE THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF BROWN SUGAR SO GLAZE WONT TAKE TOO LONG

The sauce was scrumptious and was eagerly lapped up by everyone. I substituted some lemon for the vinegar and mustard for mustard seed. It came out really well and tasted great.

This recipe is easy and great. Substitute ground mustard for the seeds for a more potent taste.

Yum. Good chops man! Made this last nite, the only difference - I added a heap of fresh garlic - you can't have meat without garlic. Browned the meat then removed it. Added the garlic for a few, then the cider, and reduced it quite a bit - took longer than 5 min to get it to a consistancy that I liked. Added the vnigar and mustard and finished the meat in the sauce at the end. We thought that the sauce was a good consistancy and went great with mashed potatos, but you could thicken it if you prefere gravey.

I read all the suggestions and went forward with a couple of twists. I used orange juice and rice wine vinegar instead of the apple juice and cidar vinegar. Very good! No problem with thickening either. This might be a good combo for one of those thick slices of ham that that they sell for another quick version. Went together very fast because I had a hungry husband looking for dinner.

This is delicious! And I had all of the ingredients in the house. Even better. Previous reviews were very helpful--I also used mustard (probably about a tablespoon) instead of seeds, and simmered the sauce for more like 8 minutes instead of 5. Also--I patted the browned chops with a bit of flour to further thicken the sauce. I paired it with spinach salad with tomatoes, almonds, and a apple cider vinegrette.

This was quick, easy and delicious. I didn't have the mustard seeds, so substituted a tablespoon of dark mustard. The sauce wasn't too sour or too sweet. Just right. The kids cleaned their plates!

For what it is (a quick and easy weeknight meal), this is wonderful. I use mustard instead of mustard seeds, and cook the sauce longer than the recipe says to--always a great meal, and delicious with oven-roasted yukon golds!

I also was skeptical when I read other reviews. No more..this is easy and delicious. I did not have mustard seeds on hand so nixed them. When cooked enough, the sauce is the perfect consistency. Easy meal for a week night.

I was leary when I saw the bad reviews, but I still tried the chops and it turned out wonderful. For those who said it was watery, they just didn't cook the sauce long enough. It is an fast and simple dish, Ideal after a long day at work.

Not a bad subtle taste, but nothing too exciting. If you like putting a fruit sauce on pork loin, give this a try. I think I prefer my pork chops not to be sweetish...

This recipe is fantastic, easy, inexpensive... I made it with the Kale-Apple-Onion sautee and mashed potates, and even served it with one of the suggested wines. Beautiful! Only change was cooking times - the sauce needs more simmering time to really reach that good, thick texture.

Rating: 4
The sauce doesn't come out watery if you just keep cooking it. It takes almost twice as long as the suggested time unless you really crank the heat up. It should have the consistancy of maple syrup and be incredibly delicious. It goes very well as a gravy for taters on the side. I'm also revisiting this recipe. It's a sure-fire way to get juicy, flavorful chops!

Revisited this recipe-(see comments below) Ran out of apple cider, and used cranberry juice instead. Made the same adjustments, adding a bit more thickener- came out tart, and great! Different! Previous comments- I thought this was a very simple, quick recipe. My thanks to the reviewer who pointed out that the sauce might turn out a bit watery. To avoid this, I made sure I added 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of dark brown sugar, used Temeraire old-fashioned Dijon Mustard in place of the seeds, and after reducing the sauce as recommended, I added 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon of water, to thicken the sauce to my desired consistency. Thumbs up from my family. It's a keeper.

I thought this dish was absolutely great. It was quick and very tasty. I initially thought apple cider and pork was a bad combination, but it was surprisingly delicious. I have to say it was a good combinatio nof sweet and sour.

Used stainless rather than non-stick pan, center cut rather than rib chops, juice rather than cider, mustard rather than seed, and borrowed another cook's idea - added 1/8 tsp fresh grated ginger to the vinegar and mustard. Boiling to a glaze took closer to 9 minutes than 5. It was really delicious!

Used apple juice (2/3) and white Porto (1/3) instead of apple cider. Very good and easy!

This is yummy! I used yellow mustard seeds but don't think they added much. Next time I'll use mustard. I found that it took a little longer to thicken the sauce than the recipe says, but it did thicken nicely without using a thickener.

Excellent dish, we made adjustments because we used more than 2 chops but it turned out to be 100 percent, as for the accompaniment in our local grocery store they do not have Kale so we substituted for Spinach, it was a worthwhile dish and we will surely make it again!!!!!

I thought this was excellent after a few modifications, but I could only give it a "2" as is. I substituted ginger for the mustard and just a bit of cloves, added about 1/3 cup of soy sauce and then combined everything at once and marinated or "brined" the pork chops in it for about 4 hours (overnight is fine.) After cooking the pork chops I removed them and added the marinade bringing it to a boil, scaping the pan and reducing the sauce. Once reduced, you can add a teaspoon or so of cornstarch till desired consistency is achieved or add chuncky applesauce for more of a chutney or relish.

This is a simple and tasty recipe. I made a few modifications near the end. I used apple juice instead of apple cider. I, too, used mustard instead of mustard seed. I also thickened it with corn starch. And, finally, I served the sauce on the side instead of returning the chops to simmer in the glaze. The chops without the glaze still retained the wonderful taste of apples and brown sugar. It's a very versitile recipe.

This recipe is great overall...and I followed it exactly. Next time, I might try it with the dijon mustard and the apple slices (sounds like a nice touch). Very easy and received rave reviews from the hubby.

I was very disappointed with this recipe; I thought it would be much better based on other reviews. Lacked in flavor and sauce was water-thin. You would have to add a thickening agent to have any "sauce" worthwile. I don't believe I'll waste my time with this one again.

This dish was straight-forward and easy to make. However, it turned out a bit lackluster and was ho-hum on depth of flavor. I spiced it up by adding crushed garlic and rubbing the pork with soy sauce. I also added five spice and cloves to the apple juice, since I didn't have apple cider on hand. My meat-loving husband liked this one, too.

This really deserves 3 1/2 stars. So quick and easy, and absolutely no prep work involved. I made 3 pork chops and doubled the sauce, and served it over wide egg noodles. The extra sauce came in handy for this. I reduced the sauce for a good 10-15 minutes, and stirred in a little cornstarch dissolved in cider toward the end. It thickened nicely. I also used ground mustard powder instead of mustard seeds.

This recipe is great for the workweek when there's not much time to cook. I substituted apple cider vinegar with balsamic, and used Grey Poupon horseradish mustard in lieu of the seeds (saved a trip to the market at dinner hour). The sauce was just right. Served it with mashed potatoes and spinach with grated nutmeg for seasoning. Yummy!

My new favorite pork recipe! This was quick, easy, and good! I don't normally stock mustard seeds, so I used about 1/2 tsp. dijon mustard instead. I also made 1TB of corn starch/water paste and added it at the end to thicken the sauce a bit. Served with rice pilaf to soak up the extra sauce. Even my teenage son loved it.

This was so good! Three forks for taste & 1 for ease. Next time I will add dijon mustard. I don't think the seeds added much if anything. I had to use brown Sugar Twin (out of the other) & it worked just fine. Added a tad of cornstarch, the butter & brandy. Served sauce on thyme mashed potatoes. MM MM Good!

I seem to be the lone dissenter. Didn't hate it. But was just so-so. I expected more cider and mustard flavor to penetrate the meat. It was quick and easy. Hubby liked it. I might make it again and try jazzing it up a little.

We absolutely loved this one! It was really simple and quick to make. I added a little brandy to the glaze and followed the recommendations of others by adding the cornstarch and butter. It was great! One small thing. I forgot to add the mustard (oooops) so the glaze was a little more on the sweet side. But meal was still so delicious I didn't realized until after the meal was over. So, I guess you can't go wrong with this one, or in my case, you can, but it still turns out great anyway!

I agree with everyone. This is a good, easy recipe. I substituted apple jucie for the cider and increased the brown sugar to 2 tablespoons. At the end I also added cornstarch. Another variation, season the chops with 1/4-1/2 tsp. dried thyme along with the salt and pepper.

This was a wonderful recipe. My husband loved it and rated it a keeper. I noticed the sauce was a little watery and I sprinkled some Wondra flour (of all things) but it works great no lumps. Just recently discovered it again. My chops were 1 1/2 inch so they took a bit longer - worth the wait! Will definately make this again and again.

This dish was relatively easy to make, and didn't take too much time. Everyone said that it was delicious, so I would try it again. The only problem that I ran into was the sauce; it didn't turn into a glaze even after reduction. It was very watery although the flavor was good.
