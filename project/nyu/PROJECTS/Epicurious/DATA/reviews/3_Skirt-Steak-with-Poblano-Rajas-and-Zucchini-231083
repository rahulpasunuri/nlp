It looked promising but veg mixture was very bland.

The steak was wonderful, but I don't get the cream in the vegetables. Not enough flavor added there to make up for the extra fat/calories. The poblano chile/cilantro mix is superb.

this is fantastic! my one essential change was using red onions instead of green onions. soften them for a bit in the pan before adding zucchini and poblanos and it takes this recipe to another level.

This dish is delicious! It's a great twist on comfort food and has some amazing flavors that unexpectedly work great together. I'll definitely make this again!

I enjoyed the dish, but thought the cream sauce needed more flavor. I followed the recipe closely and used spicy poblanos (as spicy as they get anyway) so the sauce had a little kick but not enough flavor in my opinion. I would do it again but add something to the whipping cream for flavor.

This recipe was superb! I substituted hatch chiles for poblanos, and used an inexpensive cut of meat. Instead of browning the meat, I cooked it slowly for several hours, and then added the delicious creamy topping. My husband loved it as well and said the cilantro made the dish! Delicious!
