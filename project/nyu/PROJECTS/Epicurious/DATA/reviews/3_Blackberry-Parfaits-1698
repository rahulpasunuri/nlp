Just ok. I was expecting more, but the quality of the pudding was just acceptable. I'd recommend going with a different pudding/custard, which might bring it up to three forks for me.

It tasted good, looked pretty and was very easy to make. I used fresh blackberries and 2% milk.

Very nice; pretty when garnished with toasted almond slivers or slices, whose crunch gives a nice textural contrast to the smoothness of the custard. Of course, fresh blackberries can be used rather than frozen, which makes this an ideal dessert for a lunch party on a hot August day ... you can enjoy the taste of the seasonal fruit fresh instead of cooked, and avoid the heating up the oven to bake a dessert!

Very rich and tasty. Perfect end to a meal. I used vanilla flavored soy milk instead of regular milk and it was still delicious!

Didn't think this was anything special although the custard can be used as a base for other desserts. So many desserts, so little time. Too many out there waiting to be tried to make this again.

My family loves this and so have guests. Berries with the pudding are just plain yummy. The first couple of times I made this verbatim. My kids, though, like the taste is better without the amaretto. I've substituted a little orange juice or a little almond oil. I've made it with 1% and 2% and both work fine - well, it is creamier with more fat.
