I was only interested in the aioli to add to broccoli and scallops. The aioli was on the best I've tried on epicurious. I even added the cilantro to the broccoli and fish. Don't know about the word "drizzle", as every aioli I've made is the consistency of mayonnaise, but in every way, this is a winner.

Delicious! I also added an extra clove of garlic. I couldn't stop eating it, and need someone to take the bowl away.

This was tasty but it was potato salad, really, and didn't fit for me as a hot side dish.

I quartered and boiled some small red potatoes and tossed them in the aioli. Kids liked it. Nice riff on potato salad.

I've only made the saffron aioli, but it is absolutely delicious. I've only used regular paprika because I am out of smoked, and it seems to work just fine. I've used it as a sauce for a fondue party, as a dip for grilled chicken skewers, and for veggies. Yum!

Quick, easy and a nice change from the usual. I always use the smoked pimenton

The saffron aioli really made the dish. I used regular size Yukon gold potatoes cut into quarters and used the aioli more as a dipping sauce as it was quite thick. I was happy to have leftovers for use with raw or steamed vegetables and meats.

Excellent! The aioli was so delicious it ended up on top of the steak and swiss chard as well. I used the leftover aioli and potatoes to make potato salad - just added green onions. YMMMM!

We, too, substituted regular paprika and cooked the potatoes about 5 min. less. Everyone loved it, including my husband, who grumbled that it was too good and there was too much of it.

This recipe is good except leave out the smoked paprika, use regular. The smoked flavor is too strong. Also use saffron aioli on veggies such as asparagus or as a dip. It's versatile.

We belong to a CSA and the week's produce sack included new potatoes, beets, and green beans, to which I added leeks, fennel and fresh tomatoes to make a grand aioli. My entire family loved it, and the left-overs were even better the next day. This has definitely become a summer favorite.
