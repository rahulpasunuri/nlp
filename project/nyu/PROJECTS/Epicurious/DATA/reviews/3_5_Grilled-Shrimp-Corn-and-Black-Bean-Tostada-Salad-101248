This is a great salad. The only thing I did differently was to add honey to the dressing. Lovely.

Another rave review! Made as written with the exception of sprinkling the shrimp with a little cayenne before grilling. Lots of flavor. I forgot the tortilla chips :( but served it with crusty bread.

Really liked this:)only used a small amount of cumin and no pepper in dressing due to I wanted the kids to eat it. This is a keeper

I loved this recipe. Except next time I'd definitely do the avocado and a little less cumin. Other than that this was exactly what I was looking for. I recently moved to Coastal Georgia where I pass a bank of shrimp boats everyday. I needed a good quick shrimp recipe.

This salad is a summer-time favorite. The only change I made was to use romaine lettuce. A much healthier choice and more appealing presentation!

Rating: 3
If I could I would give this dish 3 1/2 forks! The only change I made was to add a little adobo to the dressing since I felt it was lacking something and needed quite a bit of salt/seasoning for my taste. My husband loved this also and it was perfect for a hot summer night when you don't want to do too much actual cooking. It's a definite keeper! I served this with home made baked tortilla chips and a side salad of jicama and watermelon, with a little dash of lime, chile powder and salt...perfect!

I am sad to say that this just wasn't that great. Not worth the effort.

We have been making this recipe since its debut and it is a perennial favorite. If we don't have shrimp on hand (or aren't up for grilling) we top the salad with feta cheese. Frozen corn provides another short-cut. We serve this with margueritas and home-made tortilla chips (tortillas cut into 8 wedges,topped with grated Parmesan and baked at 375 degrees for 4-1/2 minutes). Always feels like a celebration!

a dish quick and healthy enough to enjoy any day of the week, but delicious enough to serve for company. I added 1/2 avocado to the salad and used romaine lettuce instead of iceberg, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe. This is going to be a regular at our house.

An all-time favorite Bon Appetit recipe. Really beautiful summer colors, and the lime-cilantro-shrimp combo is hard to beat. Please grill the shrimp, it's not the same otherwise. Substitute frozen corn when the good stuff isn't available.

Good recipe. I like that it is flexible and you can add anything you want. I did not follow exactly. Used canned corn and red peppers. I followed the other reviewer's suggestion to make the dressing more limey. Served the chips on the side. Didn't grill the shrimp, just deveined, cooked, removed tails, and threw in. But the concept is delicious. Added more spices. Love the lime/cilantro dressing and for people who never cook, when they eat this, they think it is exotic. Everyone had 3rd and 4th helpings.

This was pretty tasty. I added some cayenne pepper to the shrimp, next time I will add more. As well as more jalapeno. I also added avocado, but still felt that something was missing. I decided next time, I will DEFINITELY throw in some Oaxaca or queso fresco. Didn't bother with the chips or anything. Had to add more lime to the dressing, becaue it was too olive oil-y. Overall, good. Needs some work, but I will make it again.

I could echo a lot of what others have said. Delicious, beautiful but not enough heat. I've decided to try a cajun dry rub on the shrimp before I grill it. Will definitely make it again.

The salad made a gorgeous presentation, but the dressing was flavorless as written. I added honey, rice vinegar and a ton of salt and pepper to make it passable. I wish the dressing had matched the promise of the rest of the salad. Use something else or doctor this recipe greatly. The salad itself was gorgeous, although I added cucumber, red pepper and avocado. This recipe is good, but could be great with the right dressing. Also, the recipe states that it serves four. It's more like fourteen.

This is great. I made a few changes, however. Made it the first time and followed recipe with no changes. Although it was good, we felt the dressing could use a little more kick and for us, though we love onions, it was almost too much. So, next time I made it, I marinated the shrimp in lime juice, garlic, cilantro and salted before grilling. For the dressing, I used the Spicy Cilantro Sauce recipe from this site (you got to try this, it's outstanding and works on many types of food). I cut back on the red and green onion a little and didn't add any additional cilantro to the salad since it's predominant in the sauce. Also doubled-up on the grilled corn. FANTASTIC. Liked it the original way, loved it with the few alterations.

A perfect summer salad. We added marinated, grilled chicken to the top as well (especially for our friends who don't eat shrimp). It was light, tasty, colorful, and easy to prepare.

Really delicious. I marinated the shrimp for 30 minutes or so and grilled them at a very high temperature to get a nice char on them. I used mixed spring lettuces because that's what I had, but think I would prefer iceberg and will try it next time. I added avocado and used 3 ears of corn. When I make it again, I will add chopped cucumber since I felt like it needed a little crunch and I will cook my own black beans since I like them very firm. I happened to have half a loaf of jalapeno cheddar bread and made large croutons by tossing cubes in olive oil on the stove and dusting with sea salt. I have to admit, I ate most of these before even sat down, right out of the pan. But I did add some to my salad instead of the chips and found the combination of the jalapeno and shrimp and olive oil really glorious.

Had this for an end of the summer outside dinner--just perfect. I listened to the reviews and added more salt to the dressing as well as i used 3 ears of corn instead for two. it was a beautiful dish with all the colors and i used blue tortilla chips to finish. this is a keeper!

Wow! What a delicious combination of flavors. We will definitely make this again. It makes for a light yet satisfying meal and it would be suitable for casual entertaining. Don't forget to salt the dressing. The corn on the cob didn't look so hot at the market, so I used super sweet frozen corn. I let it thaw and then lightly browned in a sautee pan over high heat with a little of the dressing. I used two red jalapeno peppers for the dressing, added a chopped red pepper to the salad and served with sliced avocado and blue chips. Yum. Even our two and five year children enjoyed this one. The jalapeno does not make this a spicy dish, just very flavorful! Try it! I can't wait to eat it again.

Love this salad. I have made it a number of times for guests and it always gets great reviews. The grilled corn makes this dish.

Rating: 3
We love spicy mexican style dishes, so I was very excited to make this. My husband thought it was good, but we didn't think it was very spicy. I thought there might have been a bit too much lime juice, but it was beautiful. I used flour tortillas and deep fried them into bowls instead of tortilla chips. I'll probably make it again.

I've made this salad several times now and cannot get enough. I made it without shrimp and with frozen corn the first 3 times, and it was STILL good. This last time, I used previously frozen Argentinian shrimp and fresh grilled corn: OUTSTANDING. I can't imagine how good it will be with proper fresh shrimp. Be sure to add sufficient salt to the dressing and as another reviewer said, don't be afraid to let loose with the jalapeno. Delicious and vibrant flavors.

I made the shrimp in a skillet with the dressing and they were incredibly flavorful. Don't skimp on the jalepeno! I wasn't that impressed with the dressing on the salad, though, and found it pretty bland. Next time I'll just use it on the shrimp.

Awesome! Excellent summer entertaiment dish. Quick and full of flavor.

Also great as a filling for soft-taco shells. Grilling the corn is also a good way to use corn that isn't quite "local" yet. Ultimate Summer dish!

Easy to make and yummy. I made my own tortilla chips which made this even more special. A perfect, light, summertime dinner.

I rarely review recipes, but this is so good I can't not comment. So fresh, so summery. Key points: chop some red bell pepper into the salad; sprinkle the shrimp w/cayenne before grilling; mix the lettuce and dressing in at the last minute so it won't wilt.

I brushed the corn and shrimp with some Texas Pete's Hot sauce in addition to the marinade, and also added a couple of dashes to the salad. Diced red bell peppers would be a nice addition, and maybe some chopped mango? Will definitely make many times again. Yum!

My roommates and I loved this so much we made it twice in the same week and caught eachother digging for the leftovers for breakfast! We added avacado and decreased the amount of oil. Absolutely fabulous

This salad was delicious. I added Avocado and Artichoke Hearts. This would be great to take to a party or to have at a barbeque. My husband enjoyed it too...

We added a bit of pureed chipotle in adobo to the dressing(which we always have on hand)for the fun of it. Delightful! We used 1/4 c oil and just made less dressing. Worked out well. 3 1/2 forks.

I have made this a few times and always pleased. When I don't have shrimp, I make the salad without, and complement the dish with BBQ chicken, drizzled with some lime and garlic.

What a great summer, hot weather recipe. Fresh, colorful and easy. Passed on iceberg lettuce and used red lettuce. Used a bit of Cayenne pepper for some kick instead of jalapeno. Added a little sliced heart of palm. For low fat chips I split whole wheat pitas then cut in eights. Sprayed with lightly with non-stick spray and sprinkled lightly with granulated garlic (www.Penzeys.com), kosher salt, and a little Emeril's Southwestern spice mix. Baked until crispy. Tasty and healthy addtion to the salad. Will definitely make again.

Wonderful, light, and beautiful salad. Very easy to put together. Grilled shrimp on a piece of foil (on gas grill), they remain more tender and juicy that way. Also used the lime flavor corn chip (Tostitos, I believe), and crunched up in the salad. Very tasty!

Rating: 4
This is a great light supper. It would be a nice appetizer on the small round Tostitoes with a little quacamole layer, then the salad topped by a small shrimp with the tail left on. I microwaved the corn 8 minutes and then broiled it under the broiler to caramelize it. I wanted to prep that part ahead. Worked fine.

I completely impressed my inlaws, husband and myself with this recipe. Absolutely delicious, and simple. It was time consuming to make with all the chopping, but is worth it. If a corner could be cut I would use cooked frozen corn. Instead of iceberg I used red leaf lettuce. To complete the meal I made Black bean cakes (amazing) and frozen mango (mango sorbet recipe, but skipped the sugar - so good).

We loved this, I even crunched the tortilla in the salad and made it like a taco salad.

Great recipe to take along to a summer Pot Luck - it makes WAY more than 4 servings. If you're in a rush use Green Giant Niblets canned corn. Also I use smaller shrimp so there is more distribution in the salad since it's so big.

This is fabulous. I can't believe more people aren't making it. It takes some time, but is well worth every bit of it. I hadn't purchased enough cilantro, so I sublimented with dried in the dressing only.

Good recipe!!! However, even though I thought I was finely chopping the cilantro, it made clumps when I whisked it together, so I put it all in my blender for a minute or two and that did the trick--a very tasty and fine dressing.

A wonderful spring or summer part dish. A lot of it can be made ahead of time, so it really only takes a few minutes to put together. I used only half as much cilantro and it was still delicious.
