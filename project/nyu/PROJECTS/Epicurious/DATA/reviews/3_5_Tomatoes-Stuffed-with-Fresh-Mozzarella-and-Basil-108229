An elegant and impressive presentation for a dinner party and it tastes good, too! I would make this again.

I didn't peel the tomato and decided to cut the top 3/4 of the way through like a lid. I followed the lead of one reviewer and added thyme and lemon directly to the cheese cubes instead of making the vinaigrette then following another user's hint, I wrapped them in foil and let sit on the grill for a couple of minutes. The tomato and ingredients remained cool, but the mozzarella was a little softer and it tasted good!

I was at a dinner party where my friend prepared this dish. I was so impressed with the visual appeal and the taste didn't let me down either. Fantastic cool summer appetizer. Loved it!! Thanks Steve.

Served with "Stuffed Tomatoes with Grilled Corn" so to achieve a similar look, did not peel tomato. I cut it in half and salted it. My main issue with this receipe is the vinaigrette, which is overly grassy--the flavors don't mesh and fight each other. The recipe is fine for company or for a summer appetizer, but the vinaigrette prevents it from being great. For much better flavor, toss the chopped mozarella and basil with a bit of olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper and lemon juice (toss in a tiny bit of chopped thyme and parsley). These flavors need to be moderated to play well with the basil vinaigrette.

I cannot say enough about this recipe. It's awesome. Very impressive looking and perfect as an appetizer. A bit tricky hollowing out the tomatoes but after making it several times, I have it down. Great to make a few hours ahead of time before guests arrive.

Loved it - had to be careful not to wreck the shell when scopping out the insides. Will definately make it again.

I used smallish tomatoes and just cut them in half to make a perfect bite sized hors d'oeuvres. Scooped out the insides and filled with diced mozzarella and vinaigrette made exactly to this recipe. It looked very pretty but was only so-so in flavor. The vinaigrette was nothing to write home about. I would do a similar dish again, but will look for a different vinaigrette recipe, and will be sure to marinate the cheese longer in order to really get the flavor in there.

This is a great recipe. The basil sauce is delicious. It is a lot of work to scoop out the tomatoes, but it is worth it. I ended up just cutting them up and removing the seeds and serving as a salad.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and it was a big success. A beautiful presentation. I used the costco marinated mozzarella as someone suggested and added a few sprigs of basil. i also sliced from the side and not the bottom and had a few pieces of the cheese flowing out as shown in the picture. Would definitely make this again.

P.S. As you might have guessed, (since I didn't remove skins) I put this recipe together w/ the tomatoes still uncooked. Since the grill was already hot, after stuffing tomatoes, I wrapped them in foil and popped them onto grill just long enough for flavors to blend and mozzarella to melt. This also helped to "bind" ingredients together. Next time I'm going to add a few small fresh shrimp, or perhaps some crab meat to this recipe.

Wonderful dish for a hot summer night...I am curious though. We have fresh garden tomatoes, and never remove the skin.... I didn't find it necessary for this recipe. Am I missing something here??

Great appetizer and presentation is impressive. Slightly time consuming to make, but you can make it way ahead of time for company. Have since made this recipe several times and passed it on to friends and family. Truly perfect for that little dinner party!

I have made this for several large dinner parties (10-14 people) and it is a hit every time. I blanch the tomatoes, as instructed, and the skins come right off. Then I use my pinky and sometimes index finger to dig out the flesh. I purchased the small mozzarella balls (soaked in marinade) from Costco. I cut them in half and they became an easy filling; I didn't need to put basil inside the tomatoes because of the heavy marinade already on the mozzarella. I usually make the tomatoes hours in advance so I wrap each tomato in plastic wrap which helps the tomato retain its shape until it is time to serve it. I serve the tomato on mixed greens and either serve the vinaigrette in a shot glass or pour it over the tomato. My dinner guests/clients are always impressed with this dish.

I don't know why some users complain about this recipe. It is easy as they come. As one user correctly pointed, the way to peal the tomatoes with out them getting mushy is dipping them for around 30 secs in boiling hot water (I mean bubbling, not just hot) and immediately dunking them in a bowl with ice water (lots of ice). The peal comes right off with no extra "meat" and the red in the tomatos stays put. Also, I added less vinegar and mustard than asked in the vinagrette. I made the dressing in the "mortar" and it was not so "pesto-ish" and still the flavor in the basil was released from the crushing action. It is one of my favorite dishes for spring/summer/early fall dinner parties and everybody is always asking me for the recipe. I consider it to be a sure hit!!

I didn't like this dish at all. I made it for a dinner party and my guests thought the same. It probably would have been better if the tomatoes were not cooked and left raw, for a more salad-like dish. It just took too long to make and it was very difficult peeling the tomato skins. The basil vinaigrette, however, was good and I used it for a salad dressing.

It tasted good, but didn't look as impressive as the previous reviews had promised. I used strawberry tomatoes and blanched them for the 30 seconds precisely and the skins came off very easily. I think they would have looked better had I not taken the skins off. They weren't as vibrantly red and they looked a bit mealy. The vinaigrette was okay, but I think that if I EVER made this again, I would just use olive oil and balsalmic vinegar like one cook had suggested. Sliced tomatoes layered with fresh mozzarella and basil would have been just as delicious and more enticing. Sometimes simpler IS better.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe -- except drizzled the vinaigrette on instead of using shot glasses. It was good. The second time I made this I added proscuitto to the mozzarella and basil and it was fabulous.

I make something similiar to this recipe, but I use cherry tomatoes and serve them as an hors d'oeurve. Scoop out the pulp & seeds from the cherry tomatoes. Dice mozzarella (or provolone) into cubes that just fit tomatoes. Toss cheese in the vinaigrette & chopped fresh basil... then stuff the cheese into the tomatoes. Also good using cherry peppers... the way my Sicilian mother made them.

hey berkeley, try blanching the tomatoes only for 30 seconds and then placing them in an ice water bath. the skin will come right off and the tomatoes won't continue to cook creating mush. big tomatoes help on a recipe like this too

august and september tomatoes are my no. 1 favorite food, and i'm a little on the fence on this recipe--it was beautiful, not difficult, and i loved the vinaigrette in the shot glasses. i agree it was on the vinegary side, but i didn't mind that; some might want to use less vinegar. i used our garden heirloom tomatoes, which are fabulous tasting but always imperfect in appearance. and once i took off skins they had all sorts of nicks where the imperfections were, so not nearly as beautiful as picture, which i'm guessing used those cluster tomatoes that still don't have much taste... i'd much rather have good tomato flavor than beauty. the filling could have used something to bind it a bit. my husband said don't make again, when i asked before our next dinner party, so i guess there's my answer. still it was fun to make once.

My fiance attends culinary school and is doing a report on herbs. He neded to include recipes. I found this site and recipe. We decided to try it out and it was amazing. I never liked tomatoes until I tried this. The vinigrette adds so much flavor. It was delish!!!!

i loved the presentation of this dish, and it was easy to make. the tomato skins came off very easily. be sure not to cut off too much of the bottom of the tomato. yes....you need to be very careful when cutting the pulp out. i used a grapefruit knife and was very lucky not to tear the tomato. everyone loved the pesto dressing. i used balsamic vinegar becuase that's what i had. it's a great dressing. when you cut up the cheese and basil and stuff the tomato, it does make it look rounder and larger. this is truly an elegant addition to any meal.

Almost end of summer, beautiful tomatoes and basil in the garden, happen to have fresh mozzarella on hand. What a tragic waste of ingrediants. Pourquoi? Blanching the tomatoes, while allowing easy peeling of skin, results in epic struggle to remove now-toughened innards; impossible to wrest free without damaging shell. Shell turns to part-mush/part-found art. Cheese and chopped basil plunked inside, with nothing to bind them, is exactly as it sounds. Compounding this mess: the glorious basil and oil in the blender, looking every bit like pesto, is a harsh imposter--rendered inedible with vinegar. I tried it, I tossed it--and now, with my head and heart longing for a simple basil, mozzarella, tomato salad to salve my sad afternoon of culinary woe--I am off the the supermarket to buy replacement ingrediants.

Elegant and quite easy to make. Great for summer entertaining. Looks complex and impressive, sauce is perfect. Used melon ball scooper for the mozzarella.

What a great way to serve tomatoes ... this has that tomato caprese (sp) summery taste, and I was so thrilled to use my own fresh basil in this dish. I just love it. I look forward to making this again, this time for dinner guests.

Beautiful! I didn't have enough pretty shot glasses to go around so I decoratively splashed the vinaigrette onto the plates and used the remaining, modified with some additional fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary, parsley, oregano) and garlic as a marinade for lamb chops. Delicious.

Delicious! Ended up dipping our grilled chicken in the vinaigrette because we couldn't get enough of it. I added fresh garlic to the vinaigrette and drizzled it over and around the tomato instead of serving in a shot glass. Presentation was still lovely -- would be great to serve for a luncheon.
