I make this whenever persimmons are in season. I also make it using replacements such as dried cranberries. Recently, I did not have feta and used blue cheese crumbles, which I actually liked better. I toast raw hazelnuts which I think is essential to the great taste.

Delicious, colorful and very easy to make. I used a bit less feta than called for. Otherwise it would have overpowered the flavors of the other ingredients.

This is a great fall salad. The persimmons give it just a bit of sweetness which is balanced out by the feta and dressing. I made it for Thanksgiving and have been eating the leftovers all week. I am a bit addicted. My guests liked it as well. I think the secret is using high quality ingredients. I bought raw hazelnuts and toasted them myself and used a fresh sheep's milk feta cheese. I couldn't find the sherry vinegar so I used a Cabernet vinegar instead and it turned out great.

Very nice with a a few adjustments. I followed a previous reviewer's idea to roast the shallots. I don't really like raw shallots or onions in salads so roasting the shallots was the perfect answer. I used them as a garnish. Also added the feta, and hazelnuts as garnish instead of in the salad ; it looks much nicer. Used half olive, have walnut oil in dressing. I can imagine that pears would be a good subs if persimmons were not available but bananas (as a reviewer suggested to be better than persimmon) seriously.....

Great combination of flavors. I did use goat cheese because I prefer it over feta and a combination of red wine and fig balsamic vinegar since I did not have sherry wine. Loved the colors as well as the taste. Next time I may roast the shallot and there will be a next time, yum!

Hands down, my favorite salad recipe. I usually substitute bananas for the persimmons, which I think makes this even better.

Awesome and simple. I substituted pecans because Persimmons are so sweet and they also go well with the Feta. Will be on the Thanksgiving table!

As usual, I made this once strictly by the book, and then several times thereafter with various deviations. The basic ingredients make for a wonderful contrast of textures and flavors, although fresh feta is markedly better than the the precrumbled/supermarket kind. The butter lettuce goes highly recommended, much better than other greens I have tried which includes spinach and a frisee mix. Regarding the dressing, I've decided I prefer using solely hazelnut oil. Sounds boring, but it brings out the other flavors in a remarkable way. Roasting the hazelnuts beforehand is vital, and I prefer to roast with a small amount of sea salt and sugar.

I couldn't find persimmons, so I used bosc pears. I also substituted mixed greens for the butter lettuce. The dressing is delicious, the salad was excellent. I made it for my supper club, and there was NOTHING left to take home!

This is the best salad I've ever made, and I'm always looking for a good salad recipe. The second time I made it, I was unable to find persimmons, so I used Bosc pears and it was still excellent. I also made sure to toast the hazel nuts just before putting them in the salad and I think it made it just that much tastier.

This is a perfectly delicious salad & a wonderful use of Fuyu persimmons. It's too bad they're not available year 'round.

Very tasty. Loved the Butter lettuce. Guesta loved it and it made good use of some of my 30 dozen persimmons!

This was a wonderful, simple salad. I don't like raw onions of any kind, so I sauteed the shallots before I added them to the dressing---very nice.

This salad was absolutely delicious. We made it part of our Thanksgiving dinner this year and everyone wanted more -- I'm glad I doubled the recipe! Even the kids liked it! Be sure your persimmons are ripe as it makes the salad even tastier. A definite keeper!

Very easy and good. The persimmons didn't have the bite I'm used to, maybe because I'm used to Hachiya.

Good and easy. Cut the persimmons into bite size pieces - smaller than the recipe indicates. I also would try a sturdier lettuce. The boston lettuce seemed a little flimsy with the persimmons and nuts.

I rarely give four forks, but this salad is delicious. The flavors blend so nicely together. My guests devoured it and were wishing for more.

This was really, really good, as well as really, really easy. What more could one want? The balance of flavors was just great and the salad was very pretty.
