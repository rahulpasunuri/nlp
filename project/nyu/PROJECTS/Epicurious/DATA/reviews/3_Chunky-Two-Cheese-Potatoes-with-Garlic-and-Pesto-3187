This is a good recipe BASE but needs some flavor enhancement. More tomatoes, shallots, garlic and pepper. I didn't use the pesto because it didn't work with my menu but that omission was not the flavor 'kick'. I think a stronger cheese would help, maybe Gruyere? Also, half and half should work instead of cream and less of it. The overall texture and recipe concept is great. I liked the crunchy cheese on top. Warning: the potatoes cool off quickly.

This was very good and also very high in fat. I used what I had on hand: red potatoes, homemade pesto, sun-dried tomatoes NOT packed in oil, mild cheddar cheese. If I make this again I will make it with half and half instead of whipping cream, and probably no cheese at all or just a sprinkling at most. I served it with salmon baked with sliced onion, and a green salad with a simple oil/vinegar/dijon mustard dressing.

We made this for Christmas brunch, along with a fruit salad and Puffed Apple Pancake. The dish was very tolerant of a slightly higher temperature (400) and longer cooking time - it may even have been better because of it. Our 10 people ate the whole thing and everyone liked it. This is a great dish for a brunch because you can make it before the guests arrive, then it takes care of itself in the oven.

I followed many of the suggestions the previous critics gave. I still didn't think it was that great. Yes, it does have a delectable presentation, but it's just too rich, and much too fattening.

I don't know what went wrong with this recipe but this is the second time I tried to make this and the potatoes were hard and did not get cooked! Was definitely not worth the effort. Even cooking it longer did not seem to help. Did other people's potatoes get soft???

This recipe, prepared as directed is bland. Wonderfull presenation when served direct from the oven; golden brown and bubbly. I have made this dish again, with the following improvements: Substitute Gruyere for the Jalsburg. Gruyere has a more distinctive flavor. Increase Pesto to 4-6oz. Increase Sun Dried Tomatoes to a 4oz dried package- not packed in oil. In my case, I made my own pesto, incorporating the tomatoes at the same time. Now all flavors are easily tasted, but due to the amount prepared, are not overwhelming.

I've made this dish time and time again, and it is wonderful. It's a family favorite. I've noticed the results can be different depending on the type of pesto and tomato you use, i.e. some pestos are oiler than others and can tend to be greasy if you use too much. I like to cook this dish in a big shallow roaster so that the potatoes are not on top of each other, but it works well in a smaller dish as well.

Easy to prepare and satisfying but just a tarted up gratin of potatoes. The pesto flavor is completely lost.

This was heavenly. . .the aroma while cooking was incredible. It was the most popular item at a potluck dinner. I think the Jarlsberg cheese is key. Do you think there is any way of making this less fattening? Maybe using buttermilk, 1/2 & 1/2 or less whipping cream?

Mabey we are wierd, but both of us hated this dish. There was no flavor, despite all the garlic, pesto, shallots and cheese, which we used quite liberally. While it smelled delicious, there was no flavor. We were both so disapointed with the results of our labor. Also, there is WAY too much fat in this.

The aroma when this is baking will make your stomach growl, and when it's ready to serve there is never enough! Delicious.

This a fabulous potato dish that works equally well as part of an elegant dinner or for Sunday brunch. There are NEVER leftovers.

This dish was served as part of our Christmas Eve buffet. These potatoes nicely complimented an assortment of meats (ham, beef & chicken). Our guests commented as to how very good they were and many requested the receipe. It was the first dish to go.
