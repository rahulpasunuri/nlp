I have made this recipe many times and it always turns out well. The only thing I want to add to the other reviews is that I have found that if you dress the salad too much in advance the sweet potato salad mellows out a lot. I would taste it before serving then add reserved or extra lime juice, salt and pepper

Grate the potatoes rather than roasting or boiling them, and I would definitely recommend increasing the lime. Has anyone tried to add ginger? That might be interesting. . .

I love sweet potatoes, and have made very good salads with them before, but not this time. Like some other reviewers who didn't care for this one, I tasted it and immediately thought, "I must have done something wrong." Bland and just weird tasting.

Delicious! We love sweet potatoes and this is a great new way to make them! Easy & healthy too!

I made this for July 4th and loved it. My husband LOVES sweet potatoes and I was looking for a more nutritious potato salad. We roast a lot of sweet potatoes at our house and it seems like that would be way too gooey, I cut them in the 1 inch squares and watched them like a hawk. They were perfect in texture, but I did cut the chunks again as I was tossing the salad. I used both jewel yams as well as the more yellow sweet potato since I had both on hand. I think the yellow probably tasted better, but it was fun having both colors.

Amazing! I roasted the potatoes in the oven and would highly recommend it. Took it to a BBQ and got lots of requests for the recipe. Make plenty, because it is just sooo good!

Hi - I totally disagree with earlier reviewers who suggest roasting potatoes --- when you do that with oil you create a shell and the dressing wont be absorbed in the same manner. Also I suggest not cooking peppers (as some suggested too) - the crunch of the fresh pepper is needed to liven things up a bit. I boiled the potatoes and kept a close eye on them and they held up fine -- plus when you put the dressing on the warm potatoes everything marries beautifully. make sure you follow directions to start potatoes in cold water --- this helps them be less crumbly. Delicious recipe - I recommend making a little extra dressing - people loved it.

I made this recipe as written, (I think that it's unfair to "review" a recipe after one has changed it) & I was amazed at how much I liked it - quite a nice way to make sweet potatoes savory. The flavor combos are terrific together. Yum! I nuked my sweets, which was easier than boiling & the consistency was fine.

Very good but must be made a day in advance so that the flavors can be absorbed by the sweet potatoes. Like others, I roasted the potatoes and peppers, and also increased the lime juice.

Pretty good. Very easy, better if it sits overnight.

Not so good. I roasted the potatoes and red pepper and they tasted wonderful, but adding the lime and olive oil gave this a strange taste. I love lime and cilantro but this just didn't taste good. I must have done something wrong because so many of you really liked this. I threw it down the drain and rushed to the deli for prepared potatoe salad.

Pretty good. Not as flavorful as I expected. I added about 1 teaspoon of sugar to lighten the flavor a bit. Believe it or not, my one year old gobbled it up. Would make it again, all year 'round.

This was fantastic and simple. I used a whole large red bell pepper, extra cilantro, and garnished with whole cilantro leaves and toasted pecan pieces. Served room temperature. I made the dressing the day before, then mixed up the salad, refrigerated it a few hours, then transported it to a Father's Day picnic. It travelled really well and was a huge hit with cold baked chicken and a green salad. I'll definitely add this as a year-round staple, and try with other mix-ins like maybe corn or green beans.

I roasted the potatoes and peppers as previously suggested. This potoato salad was delicious and held up nicely for days. Easy do ahead recipe. Served at room temperature.

This recipe was excellent! I agree with some of the earlier reviews that mentioned roasting the sweet potatos and the peppers first. It really enhanced the flavor of the salad. I made this recipe for company and it was a huge hit.

I have made this recipe tons of times. I cook a lot and have brought numerous dishes to events, but this salad has gotten the most requests for the recipe. I always roast the potatoes. This is a great dish for a summer party.

We've made this twice. First time "by the book" except we roasted the sweet potatoes as someone else suggested. It was so good we made it again, this time I used Thai basil (I had it at hand) and it was even better. And it does not take very long, as roasting the potatoes at 400 degrees, if they are cut 1 inch cubes.

I made a half batch of this salad as a trial run before a family get together - and boy I'm glad I did. It was so bland I would have been embarrassed to serve it - especially against the amazing cooking of my cousins. Adding sweet chili sauce gave it a bit more flavour but not enough.

Great dish. Perfect as is. I made it this afternoon for a cook out we were hosting this evening. I finally had to ban my SO from the kitchen because he kept eating it and I was afraid there would be none left for company. I tossed sweet potatoes and yams with a little olive oil and fresh rosemary and roasted them on the grill as recommended by other reviewers. I used a little less oil than the recipe suggests. It was excellent. I will make it again.

Delicious. I roasted the potatoes instead of boiling (per other reviewers' suggestions), and I augmented with fresh jalapeno. Served this salad at a cookout and it was devoured!

A tasty and different dish. After reading other reviews I decided to make it with both sweet potatoes and yams. It made a very colorful presentation. I sliced them thin and grilled them over a charcoal grill with mesquite chips for a few minutes and then finished them off by boiling. Also used roasted red pepper. Served with Grilled Rubbed Skirt Steak...excellent combination.

Confusing in that sweet potatoes were listed as the ingredient but I wonder if yams was meant. Two very different things which would render very different results. I used the sweet potatoes as indicated in the recipe but question whether it would have been better with yams and if that is what is really meant here. Did you all use sweet potatoes or yams? Might try to make again.

Wonderful. This dish was very much admired when I served it last night. Following other cook's suggestions I roasted the sweet potatoes and pepper in a little bit of olive oil then tossed with the remaining ingredients. Will definitely make again soon. Fresh lime juice and cilantro are a must.

Wow what an easy yummy weeknight dish! I improvised a bit, as I just came across the recipe and decided I had to have it right now! I roasted the sweet potato (with a little rosemary salt, black pepper, and olive oil) as others suggested, then I tossed the potatoes with roasted red and yellow peppers from the jar (from Trader Joe's-delicious!), added all the spices (except for cilantro), lime juice, olive oil, tossed it all together, put it over some spring salad mix, and added a bit of crumbled goat cheese....delicious!

This is a great alternative to potato salad and was very well received by all guests. It went well with all the meat we cooked at the barbaque including the kangaroo. The first time I try a recipe I follow it to the letter then add or substract things if I make it again. Next time I will char grill the sweet potato and capsicum to intensify the flavours.

If you roast the sweet potatoes and the red peppers as well, this is truly a spectacular dish. I used probably 5lbs of potatoes for a large party, roasted them in the oven for until tender (1 hr), halfway through I tossed with the dressing. When finished, I refrigerated overnight. The next morning I roasted red peppers on the grill ( I recommend using more peppers and scallions than the recipe calls for). Made another batch of dressing, added the roasted peppers and the scallions and refrigerated for 4 hours. Tossed the potatoes with the dressing just before serving and everyone ooh-ed and aah-ed!

I made Gourmet's Layered Taco Salad (August 2003) first, which uses the same dressing and used the excess dressing to dribble over uncooked, peeled chunked sweet potatoes. Then roasted the potatoes @ 400, 15 minutes per side and dribbled dressing on second side. Used two sweet potatoes, would use a minumum of three next time. The salad does have a wonderful taste!

This recipe was so good! I wanted to do something different for a barbecue I was invited to. Several people asked me for the recipe. I too roasted the potatoes. YUM!

Really nice. I didn't have cilantro; still good. The roasting of the sweet potatos is a great idea, and they could even be tossed in some of the vinagrette before roasting for optimum flavor. Then before serving, add the scallions and red pepper, and the remaining dressing. I've done this with russet chunks and lemon vinagrette and it works great. With this recipe, the cumin would toast up nicely and you'd achieve extra sublimity. Great as is though.

Rating: 4
This is really a good idea. I made the vinagrette, but served it drizzled over my roasted sweet potatoes. Just cube, toss with olive oil, salt and pepper, roast in oven, top with chili lime vinagrette. I really think this will go over well for summer barbeques also.

My sister-in-law brought this to my son's 21st birthday party. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!! She placed potatoes in a plastic bag with a little olive oil and roasted them in the oven for 35-40 minutes. She also used cayenne pepper in place of the chili powder and more scallions. What a wonderful combination of flavors! And what a presentation-looked so pretty. A definite keeper!

I also roasted the potatoes, after peeling and cutting them into chunks. Taste before you serve; I found I needed to add a lot of extra salt at the end. I also added more lime juice.

I couldn't resist the temptation to roast the sweet potatoes. This way they wouldn't be as fragile and would have a more complex not so sweet flavor. I cut them in 1" disks then cut the disks in fourths to speed up the cubing process. I tossed them in a plastic bag with olive oil, dumped them into a roasting pan with salt & cracked pepper and roasted them for 1 hour at 375°. After that I followed the recipe. This is a definite keeper! It looks beautiful and it tastes soooo good. After sitting 15 minutes I thought it was perfect after that it absorbed all of the dressing and it was still good and the next day it's good enough to sneak from the fridge (I just checked.)

Not bad. Not good. Just so-so. Actually, I thought the best thing about this recipe was the "Tester's Notes" about zapping the lime in the microwave--that worked just great!!!
