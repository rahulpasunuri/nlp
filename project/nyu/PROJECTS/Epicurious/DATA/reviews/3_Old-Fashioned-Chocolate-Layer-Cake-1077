A good simple cake, not overly sweet. I chose the recipe because my boyfriend had never made a cake from scratch before and it seemed to be a simple recipe. The cake itself was a little too tender. I think I prefer boxed cake mix to this cake recipe

Salt. Salt is the missing ingredient you can't put your finger on. I can't believe this recipe doesn't have any. Maybe it's a typo. So add 1/4 tsp. of table salt in with the flour and baking soda. Also--make sure you cream the butter and sugar till light and fluffy, and make sure your baking soda is fresh. With these changes, this is one of the best chocolate cakes I've come across--good depth of chocolate flavor, very tender and light, and not overly sweet.

I couldn't even keep this cake down. I made it and threw it away. There was absolutely no flavor, obviously lacking something that my boyfriend just couldn't put his finger on... would reccomend a boxed cake instead.

It's not that this isn't a perfectly fine chocolate cake -- it's just sort of bland and not very impressive. I was particularly annoyed at the fact that all three layers stuck to the cake pans when I tried to get them out. Good thing frosting covers a multitude of sins.

Made this for my husband's birthday. He was looking for a layer cake like the one his grandmother used to make. This cake didn't even come close. Very little taste. The frosting was the best part. In total, lacking. There are much better cakes out there.

This was a hit at a birthday party and I'm making it again for another. I like the simplicity of the ingredients (I don't have a lot of money to be spending on gourmet ingredients).

I made this cake for a party--I turned it into a three layered heart-shaped cake. I got a lot of compliments on it, and it was so moist. The coffee gave it a nice flavor, not too strong, and subtly enhanced the chocolate. I would definitely make this again.

This recipe was fine, but no big deal.

Made it for 3 friends' birthdays and everyone loved it - especially the hint of coffee. Am making it again today for husband's birthday.

I baked this cake for my son's birthday and was very disappointed with the end result. Perhaps my baking soda was a bit old since all three layers were a bit concave. The flavor was so-so and it was moist but I think I would try another recipe next time.

I normally don't like icing or frosting. And I normally don't like layer cakes. My son really had his heart set on having a layer cake at his birthday. The ones I had gotten the last four times from local bakeries were disappointing (dry cakes with oily icing)So i decided I'd try my hand at making it myself. It was a hit. The kids and parents loved the cake. People even came back for seconds. Usually after a party I find myself throwing away paper plates with gobs of uneaten icing on it. Not this time. The plates were licked clean.

This is an easy recipe that results in a rich, delightful cake. I would recommend that people not only butter and flour the pans but add a circle of wax paper or parchment to the pan bottoms. It makes tipping the cakes out easier and leaves a smooth surface for adding the frosting. I made it for my husband's birthday today and will make it into cupcakes for my son's birthday in a couple of weeks. Yum!

Boy, I did just about everything wrong and this cake was still delicious! Made in a 9x13 pan and inverted onto platter. Didn't have the unsweetend choc for cake, so called the Hersey 800# on back of cocoa box. Substituted cocoa & Crisco as per their instructions. Also substituted vanilla yogurt for the sour cream. A REALLY good chocolate cake with a "milk" chocolate flavored frosting. Simple too.

I obviously did something wrong. The center of my cake collapsed. I guess I won't be making this one again.

Very easy to make! The cake was moist and rich, but not too heavy. I didn't want to fuss with the layers, so I baked it in a 9x13 pan, and it worked just fine--although you do have to bake it for longer. It keeps very well, and was even moister the next day. I didn't make the frosting, but I wouldn't hesitate to do so if it is as good as the cake was!

Even though it's a simple, old fashioned recipe, it was still decadent. I would suggest it for b-day parties.
