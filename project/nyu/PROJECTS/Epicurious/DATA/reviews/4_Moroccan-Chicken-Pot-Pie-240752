A question: can't stand olives, what would others recommend for substitutions?

Rating: 4
Fantastic recipe. My guests, who are very discerning eaters, raved about this dish. Following the suggestions of other guests, I used thighs instead of breasts, doubled the spices, added some cayenne pepper for a little kick, added a can of chick peas, and added roasted baby carrots which I cut in half. I also took the pie out of the oven after 15 minutes, covered the edges of the crust with tin foil, and then cooked it for another 15 minutes. I know I will make this again.

I just made this dish for yet another dinner party and each time I promise to share the recipe after everyone has licked their plates! Consistent with other reviewers, I make the following adjustments: double the spices, add chickpeas for more filling, sub green olives for 1/4 green olives and 3/4 canned black olives. The dish gets better after a day or two so make plenty!

Rating: 4
This turned out extremely well with some minor modifications. As others suggested, I cut down on the green olives and instead added 2/3 cut black olives, 1/3 green, and some capers. I also added a can of chick peas, added some red chili powder, and increased the raisins as well. It was an easy dish, but impressed my guest (and me!)

Rating: 4
Easy, quick, and delicious! I used my cast iron frying pan to prep the chicken, etc., and then just folded the crust over it and put it in the oven to bake, to minimize clean up.

-I used 4 16 oz. individual pots instead of the larger cake pan, and it turned out wonderfully. - To compensate for the added volume, I added 1 medium-sized sweet potato (microwaved for 5 minutes),along with 1/2 a bag of baby carrots (microwaved for 1 minute). I sliced the carrots in thirds and cubed the sweet potato. Both of these were mixed in along with the onions, olives , and raisins. (I added a little extra here as well.) -Go light on the olives, though the taste wasn't that strong, so more of them probably wouldn't have hurt.

decent meal. however, i should have gone with my first thought. i want comfort food and i want pot pie . if i'd wanted moroccan, i should've made that. I have the leftovers for lentils, rice and what not now however.

Rating: 4
Really yummy. I loved the non-traditional combination of flavors. Added chunks of cooked carrot and potato since I didn't want an all-meat dish. My only suggestion is that the olives contribute a lot of salt to the mix, so be very sparing with any additional salt when seasoning. Toasted slivered almonds might also be a nice addition.

Rating: 4
Flavorful, healthy, inexpensive, and so easy to make...perfect! As suggested by most reviewers, I doubled the spices (being mindful that cinnamon is strong) and the result was just right. Used chopped chicken breast and let it sit in the spices while I prepared everything else. I also cut down the olives a bit, added oven-roasted baby carrots, 1 can of organic chick beans, and simmered (covered) on the stove for ~25 mins instead of baking. Served over whole wheat couscous. It was a total hit! Definitely adding this meal to my regular dinner rotation (as per my boyfriend's enthusiastic request).

Rating: 4
Very tasty and fairly simple dinner--one of those that even when having the leftovers make you comment, "This is still really good." My tweaks: doubled the spices as recommended by others and used thighs instead of breast. Also added carrots and some (thawed) frozen greens to make it more of a one-dish meal--no salad necessary. Will definitely add it to the regular rotation.

Rating: 4
I was at first skeptical about this recipe for the odd spice combination. Thank goodness I tried it. This is now a staple in my house where I don't really like olives and my husband is not a fan of raisins, but we can't get enough of this pot pie! Yummy!

Rating: 3
Flavors were great. Did not put it in a pie, but rather baked it in a casserole. The golden raisins are awesome as they soak up all the flavors during the baking. The spices definitely place you in the African realm. I served this atop rice and it was received well. I would make this again without hesitation -- I might use some thighs next time though to add to the flavor.

i loe this for it's flavor and ease of preparation. I like to make it in a square dish, and make moroccan tile designs on the crust.

Rating: 4
I add some carrot, celery, and garlic, more spices, kalamatas along with the green olives, more raisins, more chicken, sometimes garbanzos - by the time I'm done, I have two pies worth of filling. Good thing, because my husband LOVES this. Freeze half before baking (without crust) for later. Leftovers are great.

Rating: 3
I'd give this 4 stars, but I changed enough things that it's somewhat different. I used a homemade roasted chicken, pulled apart. I added the ground seeds of two cardamoms, 3 minced garlic gloves sauteed with the onion and eliminated the green olives and substituted kalamati. I also upped the raisins to a half cup and used 1 tablespoon of hot Hungarian paprika. The base recipe is terrific -- I just like lots of spices!

Rating: 4
Easy and very tasty. Used a Trader Joe's pie crust - just one on top. Doubled spices and chicken.

Rating: 4
Only changes I made were to double all spices and add ~50% more chicken. Guests LOVED it and I will be making it again. For next time: bake the bottom crust before filling to prevent it from having a soggy texture (even though guests didn't seem to mind).

I was not very impressed with this recipe. I should have read the comments before I made it, I think some of the suggestions might have helped. The 4 fork rating made me believe that my gut instincts must be wrong.

Rating: 4
Sometimes ingredients matter. Noting comments about it being bland, I used the recipe amounts for spices, but they were Penzey's. The cinnamon in particular is SO WAY DIFFERENT from what you get in the supermarket. Also contributing, perhaps, was that I used meat from a whole chicken which I cut up (breast + dark meat) and used stock from the carcass to add to the dish. FANTASTIC!

Rating: 4
loved this. only change I would recommend is to do a milk wash on the crust prior to baking. other than that, was just fine as is.

Rating: 4
I generally despise reviews that have nothing to do with the recipe, but if you are too lazy (like I am) to actually pot pie this, I wanted to note that this makes an excellent chicken dish. I usually use whole chicken thighs and cook it in the pressure cooker for about 8 minutes then serve it over Israeli couscous. Fast, tasty, and easy to do on a weeknight.

Rating: 4
We loved this dish! I halved the cinnamon and it was just right. Also used a rectangular dish to avoid cutting the phyllo. Next time I'll be doubling the almonds - best part of the dish.

Rating: 3
Fantastic. Thanks to previous reviewers - doubled the spices and was happy with it. Very simple to make, and homey but still exotic. Will go into rotation.

Rating: 2
Agree this needed more spice, which is why I only rated it two forks. Added more cinnamon and some cayenne, left out the olives, and topped it off with phyllo dough instead of pie pastry. Also sprinkled a little more cinnamon on top and used shredded chicken. It reminded me more of dishes I've had at Moroccan restaurants and was delicious otherwise.

This recipe was amazing!! I only made one change and that was I didn't use olives because I don't care for there taste. I will make this recipe again in the future!!!

Rating: 4
This was amazing! Here are my modifications: 1) Used ground turkey instead of chicken 2) Doubled amounts of paprika, cumin and cinnamon 3) Used the juice of 1 lemon (vs 2 tbps of lemon pulp) 4) Used regular raisins instead of golden (only b/c I forgot to buy them at the store!) I will definitely make this again, and will try to buy the right raisins ;)

This is a fabulous dish. We serve it at parties and for family meals. The sweetness combined with the olives if devine.

Great recipe. I made the chicken part the day before. I think that enhanced the oveall flavor. Used chicken breasts instead of thighs. Overall, a delicious recipe. Will do it again!

Rating: 2
Husband loved it but I felt the flavor was a little off- a bit sour, a bit bitter. After reading the reviews, I think that next time I will double the spices and possibly eliminate or at least radically reduce the amount of olives.

Rating: 4
This is a keeper. The only alterations to the recipe were: doubled the spices (per many other reviewers), and added capers to the olives.

Rating: 4
This recipe was amazing with some changes.... Following everyone's advice, I added roasted carrots, sweet potato and turnip to the onion mix; substituted capers for the olives; used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store; and tripled the spices. I didn't bother putting it in the oven and cooked it on the stove for almost the same amount of time, requiring 5 cups of chicken broth. I skipped the crust and poured it over wheat couscous instead. Yummy flavor and a little healthier!

Rating: 3
I didn't know the Moroccan's knew comfort food. This was very good. I also used honey, diced sweet potatos. We cut the pieces very small, put the frying pan in the oven (covered) with some phylo pastry shells for the 20 mins. Scooped into the pastry shells made for an exceptional presentation and the leftovers didn't get soggy.

I LOVE this recipe! It doesn't take much time and is delicious. I've made it several times and it has always been received quite favorably. I don't like green olives, so alwyas substitute calamatas, and it still turns out great.

Delicious...until I messed it up. The filling was ABSOLUTELY delicious. I wanted a bit more salt and the cap came off and destroyed my dish! :( Just the same, I'd pay money for a candle that made my kitchen smell that good!

This has such terrific potential. Thanks to other reviewers, we doubled the spices, added roasted sweet potato (at 425 for 15 minutes, then added to the onion/olives) and chick peas. I will make this again and will increase the spices even more, double the raisins and add honey. We tried it over couscous in place of the crust, and I'll try the crust next time.

Rating: 4
This was a real winner in my household! Thanks to all the reviewers who suggested going heavy on the spices. A can of chick peas was also a great addition, and we did this as a double-crust pie. We served it with some sliced tomatoes, sprinkled with oil, salt, pepper, and parmesan, and then microwaved. Yummy! And the leftovers were good, too.

I am by no means a decent cook (baking is my thing), but I made this for a cold night recently and it was easy and absolutely fabulous. I took others' advice and added carrots, chick peas, cauliflower florets and honey. Terrific!

This dish was one of the best meals I have eaten in a long time. I could eat this everyday it was so good. It was very simple to prepare. I was out of paprika, so I subsituted garam masala for all of the spices and it tasted quite good.

This is an awesome recipe! Great flavors--love the addition of the olives. I agree: definitely double the spices and add cayenne for a little more "heat"! I added a sweet potato (coated with olive oil and baked about 10 minutes before adding to the pan of onions and raisins). I also added a carrot, but thought it wasn't really needed. I made this with a bottom as well as a top crust and found it best to put the bottom crust in the dish and then refrigerate it until you are about to add the filling and top crust to bake. This keeps it from getting soggy and gummy during baking!

Rating: 4
I made this with pheasant breast for an impromptu dinner party over the (Canadian) Thanksgiving weekend. With a frozen crust (I had to use a mix, which increased prep time), this makes for a relatively simple but very tasty crowd-pleasing dinner. Left-overs also keep well for serving 1-2 days later.

Rating: 4
Perfect weeknight meal! So easy and fast, and really delicious. The only modification we made was to double the spices as suggested, and it was the way to go. Next time we will also add roast sweet potatoes, and cook with pie dough underneath as well as on top.

amazing recipe! everybody loved it! made own dough instead of frozen and used red raisins instead of golden....

This recipe was tasty and easy, but I think the olives overwhelmed the other flavors. Next time I will double the spices as others recommend and maybe cut down the olives a bit in favor of raisins.

Wonderful recipe! As per other reviews I added chopped carrots and potatoes to the onion saute. I cut the onion down to about 1 cup, or 1 medium/small onion and left out the raisins as I didn't have any. Both my wife and I thought it was delicious and will definately try this again.

Rating: 3
Tasty. Per other reviewers, I doubled the spices. We like spicy, so I added cayenne pepper at the table, but it would have been good to add it into the dish while it was cooking. Also, the amount of raisins called for almost exactly equals a small kids' box of raisins. I used regular ones instead of golden and it worked fine. I'll make this again.

Delicious! I was unsure if I would like the raisins (because I don't care for them in most dishes), but I used them and was glad I did. They ended up sweet and plump and I will add more next time. I used a top and bottom crust in a 91/2 inch glass pie dish, 1 1/2x the spices, chopped up one lg sweet potato, roasted it in the oven, then added it to the onion mixture. I also used a whole can of reduced sodium chicken broth (about 2 cups). With all of these changes, it was absolutely delicious, and I will be making it again.

This recipe is a hit with my family. I always add one lg. sweet potato chopped and 1c. chopped caulifower florets, adding a bit more broth, flour and spices. Last night for guests I made as individual pot pies using a pate brisse crust recipe. Everyone loved it. Highly recommended!

Rating: 4
Really good. I followed some of the other suggestions - used both top and bottom of the pie dough, added carrots and potatoes and doubled the spices. I also cooked it for 15 minutes longer. My husband doesn't like olives and he really liked this! Will definitely make again, it was a great, simple, winter meal.

Rating: 3
This was a big hit! However, i did make some changes. I upped the spices a bit, per other reviews, and I added some carrots and potatoes to 'fill it out'. I made this a second time and served it over Morrocan rice...YUM! Either way it was delicious.

Whole dinner group loved it. Sub'ed turkey for the chicken and added 1/3 cup garbonzos and 1/3cup carrot chunks as other users suggested and up the spice to go along with it. Every last morsel was consumed.

It was good, but wouldn't be good enough to make it into my "Epicurious Cookbook" if I were ever to have one printed. Followed the recipe, but next time will add carrots and chickpeas for sure. to the cook who found the olive overpowering: did you use a cup of olives, chopped 9as the recipe suggested) or a cup of chopped olives? Big difference there in the # of olives used...

Rating: 4
I adapted this to be vegetarian with 1 pkg tofu diced into 1 inch pieces in place of the chicken. I also added 1 c each of diced potatoes and garbanzo beans as other posts suggested. I baked it with a top and bottom crust for 40 minutes removing the foil half way through. It was excellent. The quality of the olives really makes all the difference.

Rating: 3
YUM! Love this! 3 forks bc I altered it slightly - I omitted olives (husband detests) added 1 can of chickpeas and a cup of carrots for substance. Daftly, I didn't increase the spices for the addt'l ingredients although next time I will double spices because we love spice! Increased flour and broth slightly to account for other ingredients. Not soupy at all! Also, I only had a 8x8 square glass dish and it worked just fine. Definitely a keeper for us!

We loved this. And the result appears to have taken much more time than the preparation actually requires. I did add a can of chickpeas and am convinced this was the best part. (I increased the spices marginally to compensate). I also felt that it should be a little sweeter ... so added a tsp of honey.

Rating: 4
I used dried currants as I forgot to buy raisins, but the golden color would have looked better in the pie. We love green olives so I was a bit generous with them - it was soooo good! I was thinking about adding other veggies, or maybe canned chick peas next time, just to make it go farther. Definitely worth a try.

Rating: 4
A new favorite - we have made it twice so far and it is likely to stay in our regular rotation. So easy and delicious. We don't use the olives (my husband doesn't like them, sigh) so our version is sweeter thanks to the raisins. We have also added carrots and peas for bulk and texture. I like the idea of potatoes for next time!

Rating: 3
I think the olives I used last time for this recipe were not good, because I really like olives and the taste was WAY too overpowering. Made this again last night with potatoes, carrots, & parsnips, & it was fantastic. I put some allspice too which was a great addition. I left out the olives, just to see how it would be. The spices make the dish, I think.

Rating: 3
Unfortunately, the olive taste was too overpowering. Otherwise, I think this would have been delicious. It was too salty as well. I had carrots & parsnips on hand and used those. That was a good addition, plus I put some dried currants. Will make again without the olives (and I like olives, but it was too much).

I thought the filling was outstanding and so easy to make. I gave it three stars because I didn't care for the pot pie form. Next time I will steam some basmati rice and spoon the mix beside the rice. It was deeelish!!

I made this last night and we both loved it! The filling fit perfectly in a 9" x 9" square pan, and so did the crust. I served it with minted peas on the side and we just loved the dish. The lemon gave a slightly tart offset to the sweeter raisins and cinnamon. Will definately make this again!

I had two friends over for dinner last week and made this pie. I was hoping for lots of leftovers. I didn't stop one of my friends, he would have eaten 3/4 of the pie. as it was, he ate at least half. Delicious. I made my own pie crust since I didn't have any frozen ones. All butter. Fabulous.

Rating: 0
Delecious. I used sicilian olives, finely chopped some brussel sprouts and red cabbage and made my own pie dough. This makes enough for a 9X11 dish, a 9" pie dish is too small. The recipe needs more raisins for balance, but the sweetness could also be accomplished with carrots. Next time, I will leave off the crust and serve over rice

Rating: 3
Substituted calamata olives for green, and used filo dough instead of pie crust. Used a 9x13 glass baking dish and covered with 8 sheets of filo dough, tucking all around, and spraying each layer with butter spray. It was delicious, but needs a bit more raisings next time.

Rating: 4
Yum! This was so different and delicious. I added 1 Russet potato diced 1/2 inch cubes to add more substance and "pot pie" feeling. Worked great - just needed to add 1/2 cup broth and an extra tablespoon flour to compensate. Really, I can't imagine this pie without the potato. But I might try cauliflower next time instead. And I think a diced carrot would do well with the raisins. I'll update here if I try it.

This was OK, for a pot pie, it seemed to be needing more vegetables, or something. The seasoning for the chicken was good, I may try making just the filling and serve over rice.

I liked this recipe -- but not as much as I would like a traditional chicken pot pie. I made a moose pot pie, a traditional chicken pot pie and this pot pie and in comparing them all this morrocan pie was the least favourite. It was good. It was different, but it doesn't stand up to tradition.

This was very tasty; reminiscent of a chicken picadillo pie I used to make but without so many ingredients and so much prep work. I used calamata olives and they had the perfect briney flavor. Be sure to let the pie sit for several minutes after you pull it out of the oven to set, otherwise it will be too liquidy.

Really delicious and easy! The only thing I might do differently next time is to cover the pie crust with foil towards the end of the cook time, to prevent it from browning too much. I especially love that this is easy enough for weeknight meals but special enough for entertaining.

This is really exceptional and so easy! I uesed black and green olives and black raisins, and it was great. Will definitely make this again.
