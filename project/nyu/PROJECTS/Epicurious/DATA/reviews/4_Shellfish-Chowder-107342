Surprisingly delicious. And quick. The hardest part is the shopping.

Good, not great and very easy. A tweak I suggest. Together with the shallots finely mince 2 small carrots and a stalk of celery. Also, as suggested below I cooked an extra potato and pureed this with 1/2 cup of milk and added this to thicken the chowder. I used bay scallops (1 Pound) 1/2 pound of shrimp and 1/2 pound of lump crab meat.

My dear friend made this the other night. She added fresh corn and used some Monk fish in the receipe as well. She said she used whole milk only - no mnetion of clam juice. It was delish! She served it with minature corn muffins followed by a simple salad. For dessert she had candied orange slices. It was light and simple and easy for entertaining. I will copy her on this for my family and other friends :)

As with everyone, I tweaked the recipe as I found the basic recipe a little bit dull. I used cubed pancetta instead of bacon, added some corn and used homemade shellfish stock (12 Oz.) instead of clam juice. Came out lovely.

Yummy! This was the first chowder I've made, and it was perfect! I used the whole bottle of clam juice (240 mL), and half regular milk, half 10%. I used fake crab instead of lobster, and more bacon... Mmm.

So good! It's not really warm-weather dish, but I ran across the recipe and couldn't resist. I followed the recipe with just a few changes. I used 1 cup skim milk and 1 1/2 cups fat-free half-and-half, and used crab instead of lobster. I added the kernels from one ear of home-grown sweet corn. The bacon was real, but from a pouch. I served it with warm, fresh sourdough bread and a lovely riesling. My husband was blown away!

Very simple and delicous, Lose the clam juice and substitute lobster or shrmp stock. I used 1# samll winter shrimp and 3/4 # bay scallops.Deglazing after the bacon and making a 2:2 blond roux really helped this come together for a very nice, thick consistancy. Mo definitely a keeper.

Really an outstanding chowder. We lived near Cape Cod most of our lives and have tried scores of chowders from there and none was as good as this one. I did make 2 changes as recommended, I used one half milk and one half half and half and I also added about 3/4's of a cup of sweet corn that I had press and sealed up from the last fresh corn of this past fall. This is one killer chowder! Oh ya, and even better, if thats possible, are the leftovers a day or 2 later.

Made a few substitutions and it still came out great. I didn't use any bacon. I sauteed the shallots, potatoes in 2 tbsp. butter and used the whole bottle (1 cup of clam juice (the whole bottle). I used 1.5 cups of 2% milk and 1.5 cups of fat-free half and half, and added just a little cornstarch to thicken it. For the seafood I used 3/4 cups of shrimp, 1/2 cup of crabmeat and 1/2 cup of sea scallops. It was delcious with sourdough bread!

Best chowder we ever had!!!! I increased the shrimp and scallops to a pound each. I ordered the shellfish from Clearwater Seafood (online) - awesome too. Now to be our Christmas Eve supper!

Made this as a starter for company on a cold day. I used frozen scallops and frozen/previously cooked shrimp, as well as canned crab meat. Used 1 cup 2% milk, 1.25 cups half & half. Everything else was the same. WONDERFUL. Even one of our guests, who I later learn, isn't crazy about chowders loved it!!! I can't imagine how good this is with fresh seafood!!!

super make ahead dish. added the seafood just before serving.

Fabulous - worth every penny. (Even here in New England lobster is expensive.) My guests & I loved the fact that it was so light; the whole milk is perfect. I had frozen lobster stock and used that instead of clam juice, which made it doubly delicious. My only observation was that it took longer than I'd planned; I don't know why the instructions say "simmer covered," because it took too long to reduce the liquid. Next time I will leave the top off.

This recipe was very simple and excellent in taste! I did modify it a tad....I increased the scallops to a full pound, and also increased the shrimp to 1/2 lb. I used imitation lobster meat, too. The chowder was a tad thin for me so I thickened it up with some cornstarch and that did the trick. I will definitely make this again.

Made this as the April soup for my parents, gave them a certificate at Christmas for a different soup every month of the year which has been fun and definitely some work.....used bay scallops (at $8.00/lb cheaper, why not), shrimp, oysters and chopped clams. Took another reviewers idea and used a little more potato and pureed some of them for added body, also used a combo of half and half and milk and thyme instead of cilantro, oh and a portebello mushroom coarsely chopped and sauteed in a pat of butter before adding to the mix. This is the kind of recipe that invites creativity.

Made as a last minute featured holiday dish. Easy to make, fabulous flavor, holds up as a leftover (if you can hide some) the next day. Delicious - and as good as the ingredients you put in it.

I would make this dish again with a few changes. I would use cream instead of milk and would add some crab or shrimp base for extra flavor. I followed this recipe to the letter and my end product was too thin and lacked a good seafood flavor.

As a grad student with money and time limitations, I experimented with a low-cost version using foods that can be kept on hand. I used 3/4 lb. frozen mixed seafood and canned crab meat. I used 1 c. evaporated milk and 1 1/2 c. skim milk. It was still delicious this way. Great recipe.

Has anyone thought about trying no fat half and half for the flavor of cream without the calories in seafood chowders/

This is the first dreadful meal that I've ever made from epicurious. Something went terribly wrong and the finished product ended up watery and flavorless. I did substitute crab for the lobster, but don't think that was it. My roommate said it was the first inedible dinner I've made since she's known me. Our other friend liked it, but refused seconds so...maybe I was just having an off night.

Absolutely delicious. We made it with whole milk as directly by the recipe and found it to be perfect. We used crab, rather than lobster, as it much easier to get here in Seattle. I look forward to making this again!!

Delicious! Made this recently: used 2 lobsters and 1/2 lb of shrimp, (that's what I had on hand; had to skip the scallops because I didn't have them), substituted 1/2 cup of heavy cream for the same of milk and it was terrific. Served with crusty bread and a salad as a wonderful, tasty, pretty-easy-to-make meal. Next time my brother sends me lobsters from Maine, I will make this recipe again.

This was my first chowder attempt also & it was delicious. I added clams & I did 1/2 milk & 1/2 half & half based upon the others' suggestions. I felt it was a bit pricey to make for everyday, but it is a wonderful special occasion recipe.

This receipe was fantastic! We made it for New Year's Eve and immediately decided to make it a new family tradition.

Excellent! Easy! And not too heavy. This is probably one of the best seafood chowders I've made. The combination of seafood was great and it was refreshing to have milk as the base vs. cream.

Rating: 4
I thought it was great, but I have some ideas for next time. The chowder itself was a bit thin, so next time I will puree most of the potatoes into the milk for increased thickness, leaving only a few chopped potatoes in the for texture. I think that clams would be a nice addition to this dish. In addition to the bacon, chives and cilantro, I would add just a pinch of fresh grated parmesan on the top.

I had never made chowder before, so I was a little scared, but this was so easy...and totally delicious...I served it at a Holiday party the the guests went nuts...I tripled the recipe and added a cup and a half of heavy cream...It was wonderful...Fresh seafood is best, I'm sure...but I used a bag of shrimp that had already been shelled and deveined...and precooked...I just thawed it and added it the same time as the steamed lobster...I also increased the shrimp contend .... I can't say enough...Very, Very good stuff...

To the cook in France & all others: Bottled clam juice is awful, count yourself lucky to live in a place that does/could not have such a wretched idea. It's the equivalent of heavily salted water with essence of over cooked clams that are too big to be used for any real recipe. Substitute with a fish stock or the liquid from steaming clams or mussels!

This recipe was absolutely delicious and simple to make. Got to love a one-pot meal! Used 1 1/2 cups of whole milk and 1 cup of half-and-half to get the total 2 1/2 cups. My fishmonger was sold out of lobster/lump crab, so I used extra shrimp. The sourdough bread bowl idea is an excellent one - makes the meal really special and so yummy to eat the sides of the bread that have soaked up the heavenly chowder!

To the cook from France: I've never done this, but would it work to boil some fresh clams and use the cooking water for clam juice?

With 20 degree temperature and snow in the forecast this recipe inspired me to make chowder for dinner last night. I used this recipe as my starting point, but combined the shrimp and scallops with 1 lb. of haddock instead of the lobster or crab to create an interesting fish chowder. Sauteed two chopped portobellos and a garlic clove with the shallots, used half-and-half as well as chicken stock in the broth, and thickened slightly with a beurre manie at the end. It was scrumptious and hearty. Leftovers for lunch today!

What can I substitute for bottled clam juice?? I live in France and it does not exist here. Help ! Thanks writers.inc@wanadoo.fr

Great, satisfying, seafood-stocked recipe. I did make some changes, however. I used half cream and half milk instead of all milk for a bit more body. Dried tarragon instead of fresh. Ommitted the cilantro and used green onion in place of chives. I also added a splash of Marsala for a little extra flavor. That said, this was one tasty dish. Unfortunately, my fishmonger was out of lobsters, so I also had to substitute lump crab. I think the lobster would have been a much better flavor/texture contrast -- the crab got a bit lost. I also popped about a dozen fresh cherrystone clams in. Guess I adapted more than I thought, huh?

This was a delicious and easy chowder. I subsituted lowfat milk and it turned out excellent. Served in sourdough bread bowls, divine.
