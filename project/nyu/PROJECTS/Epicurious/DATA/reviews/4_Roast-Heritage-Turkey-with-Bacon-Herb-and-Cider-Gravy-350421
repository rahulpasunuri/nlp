I think I must start by saying I used a fresh, regular bird from Wegmans. After that I followed this recipe to the letter. The gravy was great, definitely follow the steps for the gravy base and all that follows. That being said, I come from a family that loves the skin, though the compound butter made for a moist bird, none of us liked the final flavor of the skin. I think the bacon dominated the final flavor, and it wasn't that good! May use the base again but not the bacon-based herbed butter. I will go back to using a basic herb-based butter for under the skin.

I opted for the traditional turkey gravy, but I did marinate my heritage turkey in the bacon butter and was pleased with the result. I didn't want the bacon flavor to dominate, so I used just two slices, which added a nice SUBTLE note of smokiness to my bird and the gravy.

Great recipe. One question I have is whether the bacon is raw or cooked when you add it to the herb butter. I would think adding it raw would make the turkey even more moist. Suggestions?

I was fortunate to have the opportunity to buy a fresh farm raised local turkey before Thanksgiving. This was the most delicious turkey I have ever tasted. This recipe was well worth all of the effort. I did not have the time to let the butter mixture sit for long nor did I have time to wait over night for the mixture to set on the inside of the turkey. No matter, it was awesome! I will definitely make this again and will try to start more ahead of time. The gravy was also soooo good. I agree with some other reviewer about the veges. Don't throw them away, serve with the gravy. They are so delicious.

Excellent! Made with chicken, and made no gravy.

The ingredients sounded mouthwatering and the reviews led me to believe that this recipe would hold true. Unfortunately this just wasn't for me. I cared neither for the flavor of the turkey nor the gravy, which tasted like it was more from a ham base because of the bacon. I much prefer a good old fashioned roasted turkey.

This year, I purchased an organic 'heritage' turkey and decided to try this recipe. It was great! Definitely important to start ahead of time. We started the day before by making the butter log and putting the mixture under the turkey skin, per the recipe. The gravy was incredible. There was a subtle sweetness of the apples it came together beautifully... not fatty but richly flavored. I added some extra chopped apples to the mixture under the turkey and shoved a whole quartered apple and a quartered lemon inside it. Turkey is never my favorite food but the meat was moist and delicious. No obvious bacon flavor... that would have been fine, but it wasn't necessary.

This turkey came out great but I did make some changes. 1st I did not use a heritage turkey, if I was going to spend $150 on turkey I would still by a grocery store turkey and donate 5 more to the food bank. 2nd I simply made turkey stock from a 5lb package of turkey drum sticks (try to by just 1 turkey leg) with the gravy base ingredients but no cider or vinegar it made about 4 quarts and I made it a month in advance and froze it. I cooked the turkey as directed but I did make the herb butter a couple of weekend in advance and froze it also. When the turkey was done I strained the drippings in to a fat separator deglazed the pan with 1cup of cider and vinegar and added it to the drippings, I poured off the fat and using a ratio of ¼ cup each of fat and flour to 2 cups of liquids made the gravy (I made 8 cups but you can make as little as you like, use the rest of the broth in your turkey soup.)

This recipe was incredible! I cooked it for my roommates and they absolutely loved it. A couple things: --I can't believe the recipe just says to throw away the veggies you cook with the turkey. These were so delicious and soft after soaking up the turkey juices for 4 hours. I served them sprinkled over the carved turkey and they went over great. If nothing else they'd be perfect in a stew. --add more apple cider to the gravy base. I doubled what it calls for and still only got the slightest apple taste in the end project. Regardless, this was a great turkey. It's a good amount of work but definitely worth it.

I loved this Turkey recipe. I made it last weekend for about 20 friends and everyone loved it! I did not attempt the cider gravy because it looked a little to labour intense after 6 hours of cooking the turkey. I would recommend cooking the Turkey Breast up, as the recipe does not specify. I paired this recipe with the "sourdough, sausage, apples and golden raisin" recipe from epicurous. They paired each other marvellously!

Ok. Here's the deal. I bought the largest cheapest old hag of a turkey I could find. I found a 28 lb. utility grade bird and talked nice to her. She followed me home. I used this recipe to get her dressed up for Christmas and the result was stellar. She was as delicate and tasty as any 65$ butterball dainty I've ever had before and the gravy is a surprise! I expected to be a little heavy, read savory. Instead, it was light and oh so flavourful. I only ended up with 4 cups of broth from the cider so I upped the ante in the gravy with the fat skimmed turkey broth (the rest of which I added to my after Christmas turkey broth). This was a pain in the ass to make, I couldn't believe I actually found applewood smoked bacon, at twice the price of anything else of course. My turkey was missing all of its breast skin so I had to shave its back and do a transplant. Lots and lots of work but since when is the Christmas hag easy street? I will make this again. For the record, I stuffed the bird with a very standard bread stuffing which turned out well.

I made this turkey for Christmas and found it to be very tender and tasty. I gave it only three forks because the gravy was a lot of work and not very good. I even doubled the apple cider to have more of an apple taste per other reviewers' suggestions and it still didn't have even a hint of apple flavor. Plus, it made five cups of gravy. I had four cups of leftovers! Next time, I will make this turkey with a different (and easier) sauce recipe or just simple cranberry sauce.

We used this rub this past Thanksgiving and it was the best turkey we've ever eaten. It was a little tough getting the butter mixture under the membrane, so be prepared to spend some time doing that for at least an hour or so. But it was very worth it. The turkey did not taste like bacon at all, but it did turn out moist and very flavorful. We normally brine our turkey, but this was even better. We did not attempt the cider gravy. Too much work and didn't have an organic turkey leg available.

We did this last year for Thanksgiving and it was Ahhh-mazing!! I have to say I underestimated the time commitment to the gravy but time in the kitchen has never been more worth it!! I saved every last leftover drop and froze it to use later. Mmmm. I cant wait to make it again this year! Paired with truffled mashed potatoes (black truffle salt) and cranberry-port-mediteranean herb sauce. We also served Kestrel (another WA wine) and a spiced wine.

Troutfisher, no need to brine, the bacon fat infuses into the turkey so deeply (i started 3 days ahead) that every inch of the turkey is moist!!!! absolutely fabulous! i did it last year never made turkey before now i have ppl asking me to do it again and have a thanks giving dinner so they can come over and eat after doing a family lunch :)

I can't wait to try this recipe for Thanksgiving. Has anyone brined their bird before following this recipe? I'm wondering about the meat moisture.

This was fantastic. Cooked this and everyone loved it. I used martinelli's apple cider for the gravy and upped the amount to almost a full cup. Then i ended up thickening it with a small amount of roux instead of the flower additions since i was worried about clumping. Killer Recipe

The turkey was so moist. I made it for an 8-lb turkey breast instead of a whole turkey, it was delicious. First turkey I had ever touched and my boyfriend thinks it is better than his mothers! I failed a little on the gravy end of things but we had a back up plan so all turned out well.

Thought this was GREAT. First bird I've ever made on my own, and I had a great time of it. While the prep was a little intensive (it started 3 days prior to Thanksgiving), it came out wonderful!!! Relatively easy despite the time consuming nature. My advice:I basted it every half hour, and even went so far as to inject the bird with its own juices. Had to use your basic turkey, as the heritage turkeys to be had were REALLY expensive (mine was about 15lbs I think). Used a different gravy recipie from epicurious (a madiera gravy with shiitake mushrooms). It was absolutely wonderful and moist (and I am picky about dry turkeys- I hate 'em)

I've made turkeys before, but I'm sorry to say that this one wasn't anything to write home about. I followed the gravy and bird recipe exactly, used fresh farmer's market herbs and veggies, and a heritage bird from a company I usually get my bird from. Came out dry and just your average bird. I needed a little bit more flour to thicken the gravy, and all of the butter just seemed excessive as it melted out and basically got poured off when making the gravy. Gravy was pretty good but a lot of work that wasn't worth the results.

No Heritage turkeys in Dubai, but 2x12 lb young frozen birds prepared with the bacon-herb butter were amazing! I baked them unstuffed in a convection oven, breast side down for first two hours, then flipped for another hour to brown top. All 24 guests raved that it was THE best & most moist turkey they had ever tasted: I have to agree. Did my own traditional gravy, 2 types of stuffing, braised carrots & brussel sprouts, chunky cranberry jam, pumpkin cheesecake - it was an amazing evening of gluttony not to be repeated soon - and with disappointingly few left-overs!

I hosted thanksgiving for the first time ever and this was the first turkey I have ever made. I found the directions easy to follow. I had to add a little more flower to the gravy, but aside from that, it was right on. I used a 22 lb turkey, it took about 4 1/2 hours to cook, and it tasted incredible. Everyone said it was the best turkey they ever had. The white meat was moist, and the flavor was great. The apple cider gravy was also great. I am now in charge of the turkey every year...

This was amazing. Used the same amount of butter for a 14 lbs turkey though, so I was little bit more excessive than the recipe called for. You could taste the bacon and herbs even deep within the turkey, and there wasn't a part that was too dry - very moist and tender throughout!

OMG! This turkey was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Yes, it was the first turkey I've ever made, but it trumps ANY turkey I've ever tasted, hands down. There were no heritage turkeys in Boston easily accessible to me during October (Canadian Thanksgiving), so I made due with a standard issue supermarket turkey. I was amazed at how well it turned out! I was careful to clean the turkey really well (a lady at the wine shop taught me to rub it with lemon and salt, inside and out, and rinse well), and followed the instructions, taking liberties in the amount of butter, and cider used. I added 3 sticks of butter, instead of 2, and increased the mustard amount accordingly. For the gravy, I did it to taste and increased the apple cider amount at the last minute because I found it lacked the 'apple' taste I was looking for in the final product. Once I added another 1/2 cup and boiled it down a bit, it was absolutely amazing. Everyone raved about how moist and fantastic the turkey was. It was a HUGE hit. Everyone agreed it was the best turkey they'd ever had. Success! Make sure you do the cider gravy - it's what really made the dish special. (Note: Since I had no room in my fridge the day before for a turkey, I got 3 turkey drumsticks instead of the neck + turkey leg to make the gravy. It turned out fab). I highly recommend this recipe!

This recipe makes a very tender, flavorful turkey. The gravy is a lot of work, as everyone else has said, and I don't know that I would do that part again. However the herb butter is great, and the turkey itself is excellent.

This was the best turykey I have ever made - - that's 40 years of cooking. I do have a combo convection which cooks quickly but the herb butter was terrific and the white meat was so moist and tasty! placeing the turykey on the wonderful vegetables gave the turkey flavor and the house smelled wonderful. I did not do the cider gravy but did use the juice from the turkey drippings for the gravy - again - the veggies gave the gravy a richer taste.

I am French, living in France and I was in charge of the turkey for the Thanksgiving dinner my American friend organized last evening. André ta dinde est excellente! Everybody was very impressed, I was so proud et happy for mon amie américaine. Lots of work, but a very good result. Bacon herb and Cider gravy, are the secret of such a result. I chose the Wild Mushroom and Spinach Stuffing to pair it with and it was simplement genial. Vive lAmérique!

Delicious! Made it for two turkey breasts. Since we cooked the birds on the grill, we added a bottle of white wine and about 4 cups of chicken broth between the two base pans so that things stayed moist and juicy. The skin was absolutely scrumptious! The gravy was definitely worth the steps; even having substituted a cut-up chicken for the various turkey parts.

I didn't make the cider gravy, but I did salt and butter the bird a day and a half before cooking. It was fabulous! No need to brine. I live where it is always warm, so a brining bird has to go in the frig or a cooler. What a pain in the neck that is. My bird was a Bell & Evans. The buttering and salting a day and a half ahead went against my better judgment, but I trusted the experts. The bird was perfect, sliced well, great. Many, many compliments, and the gravy had the flavor or the bacon and herbs through it. I couldn't have been happier, and all my brining turkey recipes are going in the trash! Enjoy this one. It's terrific!!

Used this recipe for our bird this year. Both the meat and the gravy had a wonderful flavor; however, I did think that it was a bit time consuming to prepare. It was totally worth it though, just get started a few days early. I paired with the sausage and apple stuffing (which was also great) to match both the sage and apple flavors.

Yeah ok so I skipped most of the recipe. I made a turkey breast instead of the whole thing and totally skipped the ridiculously complicated gravy. The bacon butter totally makes this recipe - brine your bird and then stuff the butter under the skin. Fricking amazing. I made gravy with the drippings and you could taste the bacon flavor all the way through. Make it with the Cornbread dressing with Bacon & Pecans and Perfect Mashed Potatoes. mmmmmmm.

We hosted Thanksgiving dinner this year and this was the recipe of choice. I must say, it was phenomenal. I paired it with the sage stuffing which was sensational and together they created magic! It did require a bit more effort and preparation, but oh how worth it. It was tender, succulent and bursting with flavor. I recieved many compliments and my family thoroughly enjoyed the meal. This is definitely a recipe that is worth repeating.

to: A Cook from nashville - - - You need to buy a turkey drumstick - do not carve it off your uncooked bird. Also, you may want to buy a neck while you are at it. Usually I make the gravy base/stock ahead of time and my turkey isn't always unthawed by then. Any grocery store or meat market will be able to sell you drumsticks and necks. Good luck! I haven't made this yet, but every year I use a different recipe from Bon Appetit or Gourmet for my bird, and I have never been disappointed.

Oh. My. Gosh. Yes to this! First, I didn't get a heritage turkey, can't afford it, but your basic grocery store turkey works just fine. Second, Seela from Virginia, I also wondered if you cook the bacon. I didn't and I think that is correct. The bacon herb butter comes out like a pate and just cooks right in to the bird and veggies. Amazing!

For the bacon butter, do you cook the bacon first, or is it supposed to cook with the turkey?

Replace the bacon with reserved bacon fat only. It will add all the flavor plus moistness to the meat. I did this last year and was overwhelmed with "How did you do this" compliments.
