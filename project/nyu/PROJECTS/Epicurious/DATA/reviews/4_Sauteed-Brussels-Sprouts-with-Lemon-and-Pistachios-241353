Delicious and easy. Had to substitute olive oil, garlic and toasted walnuts. Sliced brussels sprouts lengthwise and cooked about 5 minutes.

Tasty recipe. I used salted pistachios and it only added flavor to the dish. I'll make it again and again.

I ran the sprouts over the mandoline, and substituted olive oil and butter for the grapeseed oil. It was quick and tasty.

Simple and good. Usually I steer clear of using brussel sprout leaves (too much work) and thinly slice the sprouts instead, but I had some very loose brussel sprouts that were perfect. Didn't make any changes, except added the pistachios at the end right about a minute or two before removing from the heat. The pistachios were a nice change of flavor from pine nuts or other nuts.

I loved this recipe and I am not a big fan of brussel sprouts. It was fresh and the nuts and lemon juice finished it off nicely! I swill serve many times, my husband realy enjoyed it also.

i really had hoped to like this more. i love brussel srouts and everything in this receipe but somehow it didn't all work that great for me. i thought i was good but nothing special. i didn't have the nuts or grapeseed oil and perhaps thats the difference but i didn't find this interesting enough to try it again.

My family typically does not enjoy brussel sprouts. This recipe however is absolutely TO DIE FOR!!

EXCELLENT!! We've tried other recipes for 'people who hate brussels sprounts', but this is the BEST! Rather than peel, which I found very tedious, I used a mandolin to thinly slice the sprouts, and used toasted pine nuts instead of pistachio, since we had some in the house.

We make this receipe often as our circle of friends (mostly the women) enjoy brussel sprouts - BUT this receipe appealed to everyone. My husband uses toasted pine nuts instead of pistachios; YUMMERS!!

Simple to make especially if you just cut the stems off of the sprouts and slice them around 4 times per head (I made it as a snack since I had all the ingredients on hand and was looking to do something with some stray sprouts). I think using butter rather than grapeseed oil gave the dish an overall sweeter taste. Definitely rough chop/coarse process the nut to distibute the texture. I don't think this dish will conver the "haters"--if you need to do that, make the "brussel sprouts and carrots" dish from this site.

This totally exceeded both my and my husband's expectations. (He just gave me a skeptical look when he heard what I was making and it ended up being his favorite part of the meal.) I was cooking for two, and here's what I did: no grapeseed oil on hand so I used about 1 tbs olive oil and 1 tbs butter, threw in a lobe of chopped shallot (DEFINITELY use shallot - substituting garlic and/or onion would be bitter for this particular dish, I think). Gave 3/4 cup of salted pistachios a light chop. Pulled apart the 6 biggest sprouts in the bag & quartered their cores. Cooked as directed, squeezed half a lemon on it, and it was delicious. I'll definitely be making this again and again.

These were just okay. I have a similar recipe that tastes better and is easier to prepare that both my husband I prefer. I simply slice some sprouts saute them for a few minutes in some grapeseed oil and then toss them with some lemon juice and toasted almonds. Again very similar to this one, but we prefer it.

Nice dish. We paired with Pork and Porcini Ragu + gnocchi and the whole dish was beautiful and tasty. We cut the recipe by 2/3 for just the two of us--probably should have done 1/2.

A real winner and so simple. Instead of separating sprout leaves, I just shredded them in the food processor. I made them both ways and shredding them did not detract from presentation or taste.

Rating: 4
My husband & I loved this recipe! It is my new fav way to make brussel sprouts! Adjustments: I used 3T of butter instead of grapeseed oil, peeled leaves from 1/2 the sprouts and cut the rest in half. Either way works beacause the leaves come off anyways while sauteing. If you do peel them, the tip of cutting the core definitely makes it easier. Also, I reccommend crushing the pistachios instead of cooking them whole for a more evenly distributed flavor.

Rating: 4
I've made this a few times now, and still love it. Separating the leaves is tedious but the short cooking time allows the nutty flavor to shine. Usually I roast/carmalize brussels sprouts, and this is a nice light variation. I separated the leaves the night before a dinner party, and thanksgiving which made it really simple to throw together at the last minute.

Rating: 3
Very good and very easy. Toasting the pistachios as another reviewer wrote is key for the differentiation of texture. I didn't bother separating the leaves, just cut the cores and then did a sort of chiffonade of the brussels, which worked great. Used Meyer lemons to make it extra bright in winter time. Next time will add just a little pancetta.

Rating: 4
This has become one of our favorite recipes. We make it all the time, however, it's much easier (and just as tasty) to simply trip the brussel sprouts and cut them in half - no need to go through the tedious task of separating all the leaves. I like the way the brussel sprout halves brown while they sauté. I use canola oil (grapeseed doesn't add anything that I noticed), and I lightly toast the pistachios before tossing them in. LOVE this recipe!

Simple, easy and delicious. Made it for thanksgiving and 2 people who declared that they hated brussel sprouts asked for seconds! Tip for peeling the brussel sprouts - cut a fair amount of the core off the bottom before peeling.

This is a staple in my family. I'm a student and make this regularly at school (it's fast, easy, healthy, requires few ingredients, and is absolutely delicious - but you know, other than that it's rotten) and came home and made it for my family... my mom makes it at least once a month now. Definitely a keeper. (Usually I just halve the brussel sprouts. Fresh brussel sprouts are definitely better than frozen in this case.)

Such a pretty dish; too bad we were completely underwhelmed by its flavor. Not one of the four of us (two sprout "lovers", one "liker" and a "rather-not") thought the time involved was worth it. It tasted bland to us, not even "Brussels Sprout-y"; my only detour from the ingredients listed was to use light-tasting olive oil rather than grapeseed since that is what I had on hand. We all agreed that my own recipe (I have posted it to epicurious.com) for "Brussels Sprouts with Mushrooms and Bacon" is more to our tastes.

Rating: 4
I really loved this recipe. I peeled off what leaves I could and sliced the rest, which turned out great. I used garlic and a little onion with olive oil and butter. I didn't have the grapeseed oil. I agree the pistachios don't add a lot of flavor, but I was still glad they were there. I never thought I could love brussel sprouts so much!

Rating: 4
So worth the time separating the leaves! Didn't have pistachios on hand so substituted pinenuts and it turned out lovely. I served this for a dinner party I was having and one guest who had bad childhood memories from her mom's sprouts went back for 2nd and 3rds!! This is definetly on the menu for Thanksgiving! Yu-uum.

I think they only sell small size brussels sprouts here? I've never seen bigger. Anyway I kind of liked it and will try again. I never really had brussels sprouts and did not expect them to be bitter after cooking, since they were sweet and cabbagy before they were cooked. Next time I will put the pistachios more near the end, I think they over cooked and lost flavor. they were better raw. I really loved how cute the dish LOOKS. It's so green and 'bouclé'.

This is a wonderful recipe. Very easy to make. I do cook the brussels more than 3 min, more like five, they turn out not as tough. They cook down and this recipe is more for 2-3 people depending on what else it is prepared with them. Love this recipe!

I love this recipe and prepare it regularly with a few changes: I use olive oil or canola oil instead of grapeseed and, like the previous review, I slice them: it is quicker. It is still very good for a week night and the next day I eat them cold as a salad!

This was quick and wonderful. I used smaller Brussels sprouts and sliced them thinly. I had to run with what I had on hand, so I used red onion instead of shallot, and almonds and cashews in place of pistachios. It was fantastic!

I am huge lover of roasted brussels sprouts but my husband just tolerates them. This recipe however lifts it to fairly edible for him, and I like it a lot too. I used "baby" sprouts instead of the large ones called for in the recipe, so I was able to chop the core and add it in instead of throwing them away - it seems a lot less wasteful this way. I ended up cooking for 4-5 minutes instead of the suggested 3 minutes, but the leaves are still bright green. I was out of grapeseed oil, so I used peanut oil, and used meyer lemon juice instead of regular lemons. I had to use a mix of salted and spiced pistachios, since that is all I had, but it worked out really well. Since we are salting to taste, I don't see how it can make a significant difference in the taste of the dish. Overall, definitely a keeper. Next time, I will slice instead of mincing the shallots to prevent them from getting too brown.

Although I improvised quite a bit...it was delicious. I didn't have everything on hand so I used 2 parts garlic oil and 2 parts basil oil instead of grapeseed oil, cashews instead of pistatchios and cayenne pepper, YUM. We cannot wait to try the recipe as listed!

Brussel Sprouts have always been a favorite of mine; but I did not find this to be my favorite recipe for them. Perhaps the sprouts I used were not fresh enough because I found they were a little tough and that 3 minutes was just not long enough to cook them. I used hazelnuts in place of the pistachios and I liked the presentation of the leaves versus whole sprouts.

My husband and I have always disliked brussels sprouts in the past, but this recipe converted us. We couldn't get enough of it! I omitted the shallots, as I didn't have any on hand, and I subbed walnuts. I can see how it would be perfect with the pistachios and can't wait to try it again with all the ingredients. As it was, the dish still tasted wonderful - perfectly nutty and lemony. Make this tonight!

This is the best brussel sprout recipe we've ever tasted. The leaves turn a "brilliant green" color. We plan to make this one of our key meals to serve when we entertain. We don't plan to mention "brussel sprouts". We will let our guests "guess". This doesn't taste like "brussel sprouts". We are calling it our mystery meal. The grapeseed oil is so versatile. Use less rather than more lemon juice.

I love brussesl sprouts, and honestly, I'm tired of people touting the whole bacon deal with brussel sprouts. So I thought this would be nice change of pace. It is, but not 4 forks worth it for me. The shallots add a lot, there is a bit too much lemon, and the pistachios only add a little. I might try to add a bit of a dry white next time. It's worth making again, it just needs some tweeking.

The wife and I love Brussels sprouts. This dish was quick, easy and painless. I left out the lemon and used only zest. Went with just a touch more of the grape seed oil and a few extra nuts. For de-glazing I hit it with just a touch of chablis (just enough to release the shallots). We served this with a ring of Jasmine Rice as an entree. Worked fine for the two of us and like I said quick and painless *) peace, Rob

It was fussy to separate the leaves but the cooking was so fast and easy that made up for the prep work. My book group loved it - and I forgot the lemon! Also probably half of the people at the dinner said they thought didn't like brussel sprouts until they had them this way. A keeper.

I made the recipe exactly as written. I do not think the pistachios added a great deal. Followed the tips for getting the leaves prepped and it was not too bad. A nice light side dish. Asked my husband if he liked it? His reply: I Love this! He is however a fan of Brussels sprouts. Me, not so much-and I thought it was very good.

This was not the brussel sprouts from those nightmarish meals of long ago. The time it took to trim and core them were well worth it. These were beautiful to look at, and delicious to eat, and bordered on an exotic taste. I followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing.

Once you get the leaves separated it's a no brainer. If the sprouts are really tight, rolling them back & forth on their side after coring helps to make the process easier. Once you get to the center nugget, just quarter it & it cooks perfectly with the leaves. I love pistachios, but found that cutting the amount in half was more than enough. A keeper!

Fussy to make (what with the coring and shucking!),but surprisingly delicious! --the textures and flavors complement themselves beautifully. Didn't use the amount of lemon juice that the recipe called for: I just drizzled it on top of the salad. Yum!
