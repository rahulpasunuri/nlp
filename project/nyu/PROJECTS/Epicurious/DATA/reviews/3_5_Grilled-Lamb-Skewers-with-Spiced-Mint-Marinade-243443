I make this with fresh mint from my herb garden, it's good. I use red pepper flakes rather than the pink and Szechuan peppercorns, and just use it as a marinade for lamb steaks rather than skewers.

I really enjoyed this variation and have tried several times. My favorite way to serve it is by marinating a rack of lamb cut into 4 ribs overnight. I substituted the brown sugar with 1/4 cup honey.Also increased the amounts of sesame oil and soy sauce

Awesome alternative for asian style lamb. I normally make lamb mediterranean style - this is a great asian style recipe. The entire family loved it!

I loved this recipe. We ran low on lamb so I only had a small piece, but it was delicious. It's hard to buy things like pink peppercorns and Szechuan peppercorns that are $6.99/bottle at Whole Foods. I don't know what I'm going to use them in again, but I hope something good!
