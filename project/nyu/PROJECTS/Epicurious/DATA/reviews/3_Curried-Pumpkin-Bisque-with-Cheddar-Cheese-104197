Thanks to the other reviewers, I was able to make a delicious, elegant starter for my dinner party last night! The suggestions I took: double the spices, red rather than green pepper, add some sour cream, puree the soup. Also, I had home made turkey stock, so I used that rather than the canned chicken stock. I would make this version of the soup again and again - my husband went crazy over it!

Maybe I just don't like pumpkin soup, but I thought that this soup - even with suggested additions of more pumpkin, extra spice, etc - was kind of strange and even still a little bland. I think a tomato curry soup is a better option. I ate half a cup, it was OK, but nothing I'd eat a whole batch of.

The original recipe is a one-forker. However, I took the advice of other reviewers and used 4 cups of chicken broth instead of five, TRIPLED the curry, added a little red pepper, and used 1 1/2 cans pumpkin instead of just one. I also added about 1/2 cup of heavy cream. Definately better the second day. My 2 year old daughter even liked it!

Puree in small batches for a beautiful consistency that makes the addition of cream or half and half unnecessary. This is a quick, easy and healthful recipe. I definitely agree with modifications previously noted: doubled the pumpkin, used more curry, and added 1/4 tsp each of cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cloves and cayenne. If you like Mulligatawny Soup, you'll like this.

Everytime I make this soup for someone new, they are always shocked at how good this tastes. To make it vegetarian, I've used 2-3 cups of veggie broth and add more water. I don't think a full 5 cups of broth are necessary for flavor.

If you modify this soup quite a bit, it's fine. The two star rating, though, is probably on the high side as the recipe is written which mostly tastes like chicken broth. After dismayed initial tastings, I doubled the amount of pumpkin and curry powder, added a teaspoon of dried ginger, and threw in a few left over chicken breasts in chunks. If I'd had a couple of Granny Smiths they'd be in there too. Just be prepared to do some substantial doctoring if you like any boldness of flavor at all.

I think this soup is wonderful. It is so easy to do, and for busy times it is great made ahead.

If I can make this, ANYONE can! Delicious, but as others point out modifications help add flavor and texture. I add 1/2 cup red peppers AND pinch of clove along with the curry & sage. Right before serving, stir in some 1/2 & 1/2 or heavy cream.

This soup was certainly easy to make, but I can't understand all the rave reviews. I made it exactly as written and found it to have not much flavor, even with the curry. The best thing about it was the cheese, and that's not a good thing. Reading through the reviews I see that most of those who loved it altered the recipe, especially adding more spices. This soup certainly needs more spices, but by itself it doesn't rate a rave review.

This soup came out great, though it was hard to tell there was pumpkin in it. I added some cloves and a little more curry powder. I also didn't add as much cheese but put in a little heavy cream. The soup was very colorful and great for cold weather.

I sauteed some garlic in with the onions and bell peppers, because garlic can improve just about any recipe in my opinion. I also used the "season in layers" philosphy (borrowed from Emeril), meaning that I liberally sprinkled curry powder each time I added a new major ingredient, and I wound up using a lot more than one teaspoon. I would suggest tasting as you go and seasoning according to your personal preference. I made this for last Thanksgiving and everyone raved. We forgot the cheese and it was really tasty without it--and much more low calorie!

I made this for 25 people last Thanksgiving, and they were having two and three bowls each. Throw in a potato, some cream and a little extra ceyenne as suggested somewhere down the line, and this bisque will bowl over everyone, even those who look at you and say "Pumpkin Curry?!?" Even the kids liked this soup. Make it and be assured of praise and love from everyone who tastes it!

This is one of my favorite soup recipes. It's very simple. I find that combination of cheddar chesse and curry to very flavorful.

The soup was truly fantastic -- I added a little dollup of sour cream with the cheese and it was superb! Hearty enough to eat alone. Only problem: we felt like we smelled like onions for days!

This was a great recipe and much easier than similar ones I have made where I have had to peel, dice and cook a whole butternut squash! So use this as a base for all kinds of squash soup recipes. I did add some cayenne--personal preference--but all the measurements are just right, I think. Also, I pureed it in the food processor, as that makes it a bit more elegant.

I added extra pumpkin, extra curry, and extra sage to this recipe and still found it only mildly interesting. It was an ok soup and easy to make, but I'm not sure I would bother with it again.

I really love this soup. It was so easy to put together, yet so rich and warming. I was feeling ill and wanted some soup but didn't want to spend hours making it. This fit the bill just right. I followed the directions exactly, and used my staple Maggi Chicken Boullion for the broth. Yummy!

This was exceptional! For a dinner party, it was the star of the meal. I used a red instead of green pepper and imported, "hot" curry powder, adding an extra 1/4 tsp to the recipe. I also added some cinnamon, clove and cayenne after tasting the final product in the simmer stage. I then added some half-and-half to give the soup more body.

This soup uses interesting combinations to create a wonderful flavor. It's hearty, yet healthy, and perfect for pumpkin-lovers! It goes well with a grainy bread too. I plan to serve this next Fall as a pre-Thanksgiving snack.

I didn't follow this recipe to the letter, but what I did turned out very well. I ommitted the green pepper and cheddar cheese because I didn't have any on hand. I added two pinches of sugar and some cream to balance the curry and sage. It was delicious!

This soup was a great surprise to everyone who enjoyed it. Also, since I am a vegetarian I omitted the chicken broth and used vegetable broth instead- it still turned out great!

An EXCELLENT soup recipe! A brand new comfort food. This was a welcome addition to our traditional Canadian Thanksgiving dinner. Easy to make as well, as I am new to soup-making.

I have made this several times, and have taken it to work in a crockpot. Everyone has enjoyed it, even one person who said he was not going to try it because of the curry. I have pumpkin plants volunteer in my garden each spring - so I bake, puree and freeze it for use in pies and pumkpin bread. It is easy so easy and fast to make, and the sharp cheddar is a great topping. I'll be making this often.

This soup is tasty, but the curry and pumpkin flavours are lost to the onions and sage. It's really just a vegetable soup. I've had much better curried pumpkin soup. It should be thick with pumpkin!

The perfect recipe when you have a can of pumpkin that you just don't know what to do with. The cheddar cheese adds just the right taste to down play the curry for the non curry lovers (my husband).

I was reading Bon Appetit when I saw this recipe. I had left over pumpkin from the cheesecake I had made for Thanksgiving. So...I decided to experiment. Needless to say, my father was very impressed with my "gourmet" cooking and my boyfriend who loves his mom's Italian cooking said it was the best soup he has ever had, as well as, the best meal I ever made!

I thought this soup was easy, robust and an excellent starter. The flavors jump on your palate and we received rave reviews. A light way to start a big meal. Make a day ahead.

This was a disappointment. A much better choice would be the Butternut-Corn Chowder with Goat Cheese Crouton recipe (that's incredible). I'm just glad I tried this out before Thanksgiving!! It has no pizzaz, I could doctor it, but why when other recipes are so much better.
