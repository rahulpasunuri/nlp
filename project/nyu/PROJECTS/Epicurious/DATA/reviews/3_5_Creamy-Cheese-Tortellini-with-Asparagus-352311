Very, very good. I just don't see how it an be prepared in 20 minutes, however. It took quite a bit longer to boil down the broth on the electric stove of our rented vacation condo, but it was well worth it in the end. The flavours are wonderful and there is a lot of sauce. I found unsalted chicken broth and I would recommend using this. Will definitely make it again.

Love this recipe. It's extremely easy to make, and the flavor that comes out is amazing. Not complex, but really good. This is something I could make every week and never get tired of.

Use less thyme and less broth (or more cornstarch) and then throw in some sauteed pancetta? Sinfully delish!

Was looking for something to make for weekday dinner with what I had on hand... Perfect! I substituted broccoli, just blanched it very briefly and shocked in cold water before adding. Served with chicken. Even the kid who hates broccoli had seconds, and my picky son ate leftovers for breakfast this morning...winner!

This was fairly easy and flavorful. I reduced the sauce just a little more than called for, it wasn't soupy at all. My husband was pleased and he usually hates pasta dishes.

Wholeheartedly agree with reducing the chicken broth to about 3 cups, better with a thicker sauce. Tried this with 3 slices of thinly cubed bacon for added crunch...mmmm. Adding the bacon fat also adds a dimension to this dish that makes it more sophisticated. Will take the suggestion below and try proscuitto as well next time.

The flavors here were delicious and the dish was relatively easy to put together. I wish I had read the other reviews a little closer and made the sauce thicker. this was more of a tortellini chowder, than tortellini in cream sauce. I will definitely make again, but will thicken the sauce so it's less soupy.

This is a very good recipe. I used 4 cups stock and reduced it to 1 cup. I did thicken the sauce a bit more than was called for. I also added prosciutto with the asparagus. It's one I'll definitely make again and again.

Quick, easy and so tasty! Followed the advice of other reviewers and used between 2-3 cups of broth. Substituted veggie broth for chicken broth and dried thyme for fresh. This recipe will definitely go into rotation for weeknights.

Easy and delicious. Used tarragon instead of thyme.

The sauce is wonderful in this dish. I halved the recipe (more than enough for 2)and used condensed chicken broth & extra garlic which gave the dish a lot of flavor. Definitely will make again and again!

I only used 3 cups of broth. This recipe was a keeper with the kids, very easy and a great taste.

I think 4 cups broth is a little too much- I expected the sauce to be more like Alfredo, and it was more like a soup base. I plan on cooking 2 cups of broth next time. Great taste, fast recipe!
