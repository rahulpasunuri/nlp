This is a real crowd pleaser. I serve it with chunks of Italian bread, celery and cucumber sticks for dipping. It disappears in minutes.

Excellent. Fresh bright taste. It's very colorful and works well as a dip but I have also used it as a garnish for roasted meats and fish and as a topping for cream cheese covered crackers.

This dip is great!!! I got so many requests for the recipe. It has such a freshness to it. It's not a creamy dip but more like a fresh salsa or something (minus the heat)

DELICIOUS! I substituted pumpkin seeds for almonds (that's all I had) so it has a more bitter,nuttier flavor but still delicious. Doubled the garlic (I always do) and it's magnificent. Great with carrot sticks or pita chips. Olive oil gives it a richness. Used balsamic vinegar(that's all I had) and tastes great!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it went over pretty well! As the recipe is written you can add as much or as little garlic and onion - next time I would add more. It was a little on the bland side. I made the dip a day ahead and it worked out just fine.

Disappointing and bland. I even added an extra garlic clove, a teaspoon of cumin and 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper, to no avail. Fun to make, but the taste was not worth the effort.

I've made this dip many times, and handed out the recipe each time I've served it! It is quite easy, and adds great color to the table. I highly recommend this dip.

This is a nice and versatile dip. I've prepared it for several different ocassions and, so far, all my guests were delighted and surprised. It is also great with crudites.

I used a piece of whole wheat bread for the sandwich bread called for. What a wonderful dip!

Very tasty for a dip that's healthful.

I've made this recipe several times for festive events, as it's quick and very pretty. I love it, but it is a somewhat unusual taste--guests generally feel strongly one way or the other. Well-toasted pita is a must.

I didn't care for the dip; although some of my guests did. I believe it's an acquired taste; nothing I would make again.
