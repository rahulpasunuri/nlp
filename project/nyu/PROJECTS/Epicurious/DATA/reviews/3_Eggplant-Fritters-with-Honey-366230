Different and sweet carb side to a main meal. I attempted to have a "Spainish" theme to my meal and served with the Spanish Crusted Roast Pork Tenderloin and Sauteed Persimmons and Green Beans with Chives. Definitely not a Spanish flavor but an excellent meal and I was at least able to find all the ingrediants here which proves challenging all the time.

This is how my Brit born mother made eggplant in Ontario in the 1940's.....no Spanish links at all....but the honey is new. It's absolutely delicious and I make it to this day.
