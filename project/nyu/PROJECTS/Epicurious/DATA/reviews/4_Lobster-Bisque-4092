I have had some really good bisque at 5 star restaurants and this was really close. I did change 2 items, I used nothing but the boiling liquid instead of fish stock and 3 1 1/4 lobsters. For the rest of the recipe I stayed true. I really liked it. The whole family said do it again!

Although my husband liked it, I thought it was mediocre. A very expensive dish, with a lot of steps, for a sort of blah bisque. I might make it again, but it will need a lot of tweaking to make it worth the trouble.

I cut this recipe in half for just my husband and I for a dinner and it turned out great. I used 1 1/2 lbs spiny lobster but still was great. Would not change a thing.

I make this bisque almost every time we cook lobster. I use the cooking water rather than fish stock or clam juice, but I leave it simmer for hours (easily 3 hours). It's a wonderful rich bisque and I was surprised that very little cream is required. Yum!

I have make this bisque a number of times with great success. It is a very nice way to display the fresh lobster flavor with fresh herbs and a great broth. I personally use less cream, but to each their own. Every one that has tried this at my house absolutely loves it. BTY, I like the lobster pieces in the bisque. Haven't tried serving it with puff pastry on top, great on its own. Highly recommend!

I was looking for a bisque that could utilize my leftover lobster tails... so this is what I did (after work:). I had 2.5 or 3 tails left over from roasting a couple nights ago. Chopped the shells and followed the recipe. instead of 2C lobster water I used some chicken broth from the fridge. I also didn't have brandy and used all sherry. I had no patience for cutting the fresh herbs (tho I had them..) so just threw in .5 dried. Also used 1/2 &1/2 not heavy cream and it turned out great, despite all my shortcuts. Everyone loved this and I'll definitely use it for a leftover lobster recipe again.

Made this last night. It is easy to put together but time consuming. The tarragon and tyme mixture is right on. I ommited the cornstarch. I will double the recipe next time.

As a native Mainer (and one who enjoys lobster frequently), bisque is something we create from leftovers (kind of like eating your cake and having it too). No need to waste all that delicious lobster meat in a bisque; so go ahead and enjoy your lobster dinner and then refrigerate carcasses to chop and boil down later. I liked this recipe a lot. A few modifications; onion - I used some white and some red. Since we only had flavored brandies, I substituted the brandy for cognac. Also, I omitted cornstarch and let the recipe reduce longer.

I don't like garlic with lobster so I left it out. There's no need for fish stock if you make lobster stock from the shells. I added cayanne, paprika and saffron. Used nonfat milk instead of heavy cream to keep the fat down. It's easy to make food taste good with tons of fat. Good recipe as is but it could be better.

Rating: 3
Good recipe but I never put lobster meat into a bisque. It's a waste of money. I eat the lobster meat and use only the shells and bodies. I skipped almost all of the slicing/chopping since I cooked it for 6 hours before straining and finishing. Substituted commercial lobster base for the clam juice and fat-free milk for the cream -- reducing the fat and calories into a realistic range. I used VSOP brandy and high-quality dry sherry which I flamed after the initial frying. Yummy...

i used this recipe as a base for a sauce. i used a red onion instead of white and cut the tomato paste. and 2 lobster tails as live lobsters are hard to come by where im at. it was served over fettuccini with the meat from the lobster tails. the length of time it took to simmer was enough to finish the rest of my meal so it all came out together also i used remy martin vsop brandy very very good. i will be making this again!

We followed this recipe exactly for a 7 course meal. The amounts recommended really are just right. Make sure to use the dry sherry. Lobster makes this bisque sweet and delicious. Everyone loved it!

My family does a big dinner every Wednesday and whipping this together in 2 hours is possible but if you are cooking other things at the same time it gets messy. My favorite part was "Coarsely chop lobster shells" which is impossible with out a cleaver and making a huge mess. I suggest using a pair of kitchen shears. Also use a VERY Wide pan when making the stock/soup. Other wise this was an easy and very tasty bisque. Four Forks!

Made the lobster broth with 7 carcasses. I believe that the broth is the basis to the whole bisque. I simmered the lobster and water,(16 cups)veggies, etc. for 5-6 hours (you would do this for a chicken stock!) and then skimmed off the shells, etc. I took 4 cups of the broth and added 1/2 cup of sherry. Boiled for 10 minutes to reduce to 3 cups. At this time, I combined the cornstarch with the liquid until thickened, then added light cream (how many calories do we need) and then poured the hot bisque over about 1/4 cup of chopped lobster. I had a couple of pieces of cheese bread which i toasted and cut up. Sprinkled this on top. Lovely. Everyone loved it. I froze the leftover broth so I can do again later in the season with the frozen lobster I had leftover. yum!

So, labor day weekend at the jersey shore and the special was lobster at $4.99 a pound. We purchased 7 1.70 lb lobsters. Steamed them in our large clam steamer for 10 minutes. Added the carcasses and all the shells to the steamer water. Added carrot, onion,bay,. garlic, tomatoes and 16 cups of water/steamer water. Simmered for 5-6 hours. Great depth to the broth. At this point I strained the broth. Take 4 cups, add 1/2 cup sherry, simmer until it reduces to 3 cups, do the cornstarch with the broth,add light cream (do we really need whipping?) add about 1/4 cup of lobster to the bottom of the bowl and pour the hot bisque over the top. Wonderful...remember, this does not need to be thick but a nice consistency to cover a spoon. I am freezing the rest of the broth for another go roumd later in the season with the leftover lobster.

Rating: 4
Fabulous recipe. I get lobster at $6 a pound, so it's in fact quite inexpensive. Completely agree with several reviews that recommend NOT putting the lobster meat into the bisque, but rather placing it in the bowl right before serving. I've had rave reviews on the half dozen occasions I've served it. In fact, I'm making it tomorrow night!

Rating: 4
I made this to rave reviews. One of the best lobster bisques I've ever had. Quite time consuming to prepare but oh so decadent to eat. I followed the recipe as written and it was great. The lobsters turned out perfectly. I would certainly make this again for a special occasion. Very rich - either a tiny serving or serve as a main course soup.

Rating: 4
I used frozen lobster shells that I had saved from a previous lobster dinner. Since I didn't have the lobster meat, I used shrimp and added it at the end. I also added low sodium chicken broth as needed. Instead of whipping cream, I used low fat sour cream. Altogether, great!

Rating: 4
Excellent! I made a recipe for three using a 1 1/2# lobster. Simmering for 1 hour was too long for a reduced recipe. So I added water to the shells and veggie and created more flavorful liquid. I prepared one day ahead. I baked some puff pastry circles and placed on top of each small crock as noted by the restaurant.

Rating: 4
We have made this recipe half a dozen times and again last night for a dinner party of 10....huge hit. We think we have refined it down to the perfect dish with the following enhancements: 1. Double the amount of lobster which we cut into large but still bite size chunks which we add at room temperature to the bottom of the serving bowl prior to ladling in piping hot soup (at least 4-6 chunks per bowl 2. We use Lobster Base (Better Than Bouillon is a good brand) instead of fish stock or clam juice. 3. We make the stock 1 day ahead 4. We add a dollop of Creme Fraiche on top of the soup and sprinkle fresh chives 5. Finally and most importantly we float Cognac on top of the dish prior to serving. Yummmmy!

$120 in groceries for a mediocre soup. would not make again.

I've had several people tell me this is the best bisque they've ever had. I vary the recipe slightly by doing the following: After straining the soup, I toss the strained vegetables into my food processor and puree them. I then dump the puree into the strainer and push it through. This adds considerably to the flavor and texture of the soup, and allows me to cut back on the cornstarch.

Rating: 4
I will be making the dish for the 5th time this evening and have received rave reviews every time. Personally, I don't find the dish to involve that much effort but we tend to cook pretty complex dishes. I am also lucky enough to have an asian market around the corner that sells lobster for $10 per pound which reduces the cost of the dish.

Rating: 2
I must admit I was excited about making this dish from scratch but need to join the few dissenters. Again, time and $20/lb for the lobster just made the results a bit underwhelming. One note that may make me try this one more time on a cold day: The store only had 2 bottles of clam juice left so I had to use Kitchen Basics Seafood stock for the other 16 oz. I did not test it before adding...a mistake...it had a certain dogfood type aroma to it that was apparent in the finished bisque. Next time (if?) I'm using lobster stock, and pretasting all ingredients. And since I made the base the day before, I might add extra sherry prior to serving so it comes through more.

Rating: 4
I've made this soup several times and every time it's a hit. Lots of work but well worth it in the end. I added an extra 1/2 cup of sherry and dished the lobster meat before pouring the soup over it. This prevents overcooking and toughening the meat. Very rich and delicious.

Rating: 4
I made the recipe as written. It's takes some work, but is well worth it.

Will be an absolute hit if you use the "Strong Fish Stock" by Jasper White. Only one suggestion for preventing overcooking the reserved lobster meat. Don't add the meat to the pot at the end as directed; I'd simply place them in your serving bowls, chilled and ladle the hot bisque on top to warm them. The bisque will be plenty hot... Or you can always take them out of the refridgerator well before the cream is added to warm the meat closer to room temp. So rich, you may want to check your cholesterol before consuming.

I prepared this the night before, but didn't add the lobster until I was ready to reheat for serving. This is a delicious recipe. I cooked a potato with the other vegetables and I used fat free half & half. There was no need to use cornstarch to thicken it. This recipe is a keeper, but I would only make it for a special occasion.

This was a very rich, extremely delicious soup that is also very difficult to make. It is definitely worth the time and effort, but if I were to make it again, I would perhaps make it the night before a dinner party, and warm it up before serving.

Made this for New Years Eve dinner and what a hit. Despite what some people believe, bisques should be a light broth, not at all like a chowder, so don't be discouraged if it looks thin. I added a little more sherry as a lot burns off. This recipe is competition for a bisque at any restaurant.

I've made lobster bisque for xmas eve for the past 6 years and this is the best (Julia's recipe is just about as good, but much more work since she saves the tomalley). This isn't a hard recipe at all, but you really shouldn't skip the lobster stock part or it will taste lousy. Also, I boil down the cooking liquid to concentrate the flavor in those reserved 2 cups.

A wise man once told me that time is not of the essence, but taste buds control a mans desire and fuel his loins. This dish melted with complex flavors and exhuberant texture to create a masterpiece only known as lobster bisque. Being a new food critic, I have the ability to allow my virgin taste buds to absorb every inch of flavor. Definitely a ten in my book. Impressive to say the least. Another keeper for my cookbook.

Rating: 3
Excellent! Don't be concerned with all the reviewers who complained about the amount of time involved. It is no more involved than the time needed for a decent chicken soup. I live in New England so I bought lobsters that were already cooked, which saved me a tiny bit of effort. The only modification to the recipe for me was to boil the shells for about 10 minutes so that I could use the cooking water rather than bottled clam juice. The results were superb and I actually cooked the bisque on my gas grill so that my house didn't smell like lobster shells for a week! Try this recipe. The key to success is organization. And DO NOT skip out on the whipping cream. It is essential for a velvety consistency.

I enjoyed the Bisque, but it was a lot of work for this recipe. I followed it exactly and enjoyed the flavors. I will make it again.

I now make this recipe on a semi-regular basis. Mostly owing to the fact that my friends absolutely insist that I prepare it when they come over. Ever since the first time I made it, I have had nothing but glowing reviews. Regarding the earlier reviewer's comments about clam juice, I have always used shellfish stock. It brings a very nice flavor to the dish. I also do not use the sherry--just the cognac.

Rating: 3
This soup had a great flavor. I cut down on the tarragon a little. To cut calories, I used 1/2 & 1/2. Still got compliments from friends and family although it was not as thick as I would have liked. Might have to use a bit of heavy cream next time.

Just made this recipe for Christmas Eve. I left out the Cognac,(doubled the sherry amount to compensate), left out the garlic and the chopped tomtato. In place of fish stock ,I tried "Savory Basics" Lobster Stock concentrate and made 6 cups worth of Lobster Stock to replace the 4 cups of fish stock and 2 cups of the water the lobsters were cooked in. I am not a good cook, but this came out great. It was worth the time and expense for something special for the family. Flavor out the wahzoo.

I made this bisque without the cream. It was robust and rich enough without it! I used trader joes frozen lobster tail meat and that worked out fine. So, I didn't have the lobster shells but still, it was a hit. Also, I'm on Atkins, and this totally fits in with barely a carb.

Made this as an appetizer for 20 ppl at a dinner party, and every single one raved about it. Pretty labor intensive, but well worth it for a special occasion. Thanks to the cook from Newfoundland for the coral suggestion (how's life on the rock?).

Rating: 3
This ia an excellent rich recipe that can be tweaked a bit. If, like the cook from Brussels, you use a stock made from lobster shells, you won't need as much lobster meat. You could, for example, serve the tails and larger claws as an elegant little dinner for two, reserving the bodies, smaller claws and little legs for the bisque. Believe me, this will still be quite rich, but you might have room for the main course. Buying female lobsters is always a good idea when making bisque. Their coral (red waxy roe) can be mixed with a little softened butter, pushed through a sieve and stirred into the bisque to enhance it.

I used this recipe as a course in the dinner I surprised my girlfriend with on Valentines Day. We both loved it and I will be pulling this one out on those special occasions from now on. This was my first time using this recipe and I used heavy cream instead, I don't have anything to compare but it was quite excellent.

Using fish stock really helps, but where I live it's hard to get it. So, I use anchovy paste [available in any supermarket aisle with tuna, sardines, etc.] and boiling water. Start with 1 Tbsp. in 4 cups of boiling water, then dilute it to taste for saltiness. Add stock, diluted to taste, in amount specified in the recipe. Freeze what's left. Don't be afraid of anchovies. They add great depth of flavor if used properly. Fresher than boullion cubes, too. Also, I baked the bisque in ramekins [500 ml] topped with puff pastry, served with a salad. Make sure the pastry is sealed along the edge, so it doesn't slip into the bisque. Otherwise, it doesn't brown & puff, just stews. Really elegant.

Rating: 4
best Lobster bisque I've had. I use a broth made from lobster shells rather than clam or fish broth. I save all lobster shells we eat in freezer until I have enough to make a broth. I also puree half of the meat in the soup. If you don't have sherry, its great with just cognac or armagnac

Rating: 4
Lots of effort, but sooo worth it! I have never received more compliments on anything I have cooked. I am a lifelong Massachusetts resident and it is the best I have had anywhere. For the record, the one fork vote says she used lobster meat and that's the problem. The flavor of this recipe comes from all the lobster parts that steep in the stock. I used clam juice and did most the day before, and I noticed no problems at all.

Can I rate 50 forks? I made a double batch for New Years Eve and could have skipped the crown roast of pork! My guests went wild and one even sent a thank you card with a gift certificate for 20 bucks. This was the first time I made it and will not be the last. I think we will give qts. away for next Christmas.

I hate to be the one dissenting voice here, but I couldn't get this recipe to work (unlike many others on this excellent site). While in Boston, I tried this out having obtained fresh lobster meat from Legal seafood. The first time I tried this, I used clam juice. The results were bland. I used fish stock (bottled) the next time, and the whole thing smelled terrible. I say this only to warn anyone who wants to try this for the first time with guests coming over. I admit to not having much experience with fish soups. Lobster is expensive, so beginners would do well to just try making the bisque part and seeing if they like it. Mine tastes like nothing, and couldn't be salvaged by spicing it up more. I don't want to malign a good recipe, so I'll also say that lobster bisque, in my mind, is a recipe that sounds classier than it tastes. I hope you have better luck than I did!

Great recipe for a special dinner! For those inexperienced in working with whole lobsters (like me), yes indeed, you do put EVERYTHING in to saute and then simmer. Not a pretty sight, but delicious when all was done!

We varied this recipe a bit and substituted king crab, shrimp and scallops for the lobster. Then made a mistake and added too much tomato paste - but the result was terrific anyway. Next time we'll use the proper amount of tomato paste and I think it will be even better. The end result is well worth the time it takes to make this bisque. Might try making it a day ahead next time (the leftovers were great too).

Oh my God! What a great recipe. I just made this one hour ago for New Year's Eve dinner. We skipped the beef tenderloin with port balsamic sauce with asparagus and pommes de terre parisienne and went straight to the pumpkin bread pudding brule. This is amazing. I thickenend it a bit more because I put in 3 lobster shells, etc. It is wonderful. I put a dolup of sour cream in the middle and had 3 bowls full. Happy New Year.

Had to serve 10, so added a lobster and incresed other ingredients to scale. I did add water to the strained shells, re-simmer, and add to the bisque as a kind of remouillage. Otherwise, only minor changes to taste. This was a FANTASTIC first course for our Christmas meal.

A wonderful combination of flavors for the palate to savor...I do agree it is very labor intensive, but so well worth the work involved...am making it this Thanksgiving for family...the best bisque I have ever had. My family LOVED it when I made it the first time..A great crowd pleaser for sure!

Exceptional. I browned the shells in a combination of rendered bacon fat and olive oil and left out the tarragon because my husband and I can't stand it. This was by far the best lobster bisque we have ever had -- we also had leftovers the next day which were really good but not superlative. My recommendation: do not make this a day ahead of time because the flavors blend too much. Indeed, my husband and our dinner guests raved about how they were able to pick out each ingredient when it was made a few hours before consuming. A keeper for sure!
