Very balanced, and so quick to put together. We all loved this. I adore pine nuts but they are so pricey, I want to try it next time with chopped pistachios.

Couscous can be boring but this is rich and delicious. I substituted toasted almond slivers for the pine nuts and added orange zest (with the mint) and the juice of the orange I used for zest (to the stock). Very nice. Super easy.

This recipe was so easy to prepare for a party. It has a wonderful fragance and tastes great. I served it with roast pork and spinach pear gorgonzola salad.

I also used craisins instead of currants and it turned out great. It goes well with chicken, lamb and pork. This recipe yields alot, so with the leftovers I sometimes add feta and serve it chilled as a salad. Guests and family always love it.

I left out the butter and pine nuts to cut down on the fat. Put a tsp of olive oil in the water instead. It's a nice combination of flavours
