Great potatoes. Made them as written and they were a big hit. This will definitely be a repeat in our household.

Great flavor and so easy to make. I used baby new potatoes and halved them. Roasted at 400 on convection for a nice crisp exterior and tender inside. The spice mixture was perfect. You do not need as much oil as called for.

Wonderful! I used baby red potatoes and they were so tender after baking - and I even cut the oil. The spices were HOT so next time I'm going to cut down on the cayenne pepper and chili powder just a tad. They were lovely with pork cutlets.

I served this recipe exactly as written and everyone loved it--even snoopy nieces and nephews. It couldn't be more simple.

These are fantastic..I make them all summer to go with whatever we are grilling and everyone I have served them to loves them. They are great the next day with eggs for breakfast!

I agree with earlier reviewers on a couple of points; I only used garlic powder (it was plenty salty), and 45 mins. was plenty of baking time. Otherwise, these are a nice compliment to any meat and so simple to prepare. Enjoy! KIMBER

I have made this recipe over-and-over again. Our kids love them, and that is not an easy task. I do cut down on the salt and cayenne, and still find them very pungent.

The recipe is excellent. Everyone in my family loves these potatoes.

My husband loves these. I have found that 45 minutes is plenty of cooking time. They are a great substitute for french fries for those of us watching our figure!

I thought these potatoes were just ok. My husband however really enjoyed them. It was ok for something different but I probably won't make this again anytime soon.

We loved these! I made them with the Beef and Gorgonzola Burgers also on the site. They do need to be served with a hearty meat since they're so assertively flavored. Mine were tender after 45 minutes. My husband thought they were overly salty - I'm a salt lover so it didn't bother me, but if you don't like salt you might want to either omit it or use regular garlic powder.

A great recipe. I did parboil the red spuds for 5 minutes to cut down on the cooking time. It is rather hot in AZ. I then baked them at 4oo degrees for 25 minutes. I used baby reds.

I thought these potatoes were great, but I have a couple of suggestions. I doubled the recipe and ended up putting way too many potatoes on the first pan that I used. The potatoes STEAMED instead of roasting. On the second & third pan, I spread them out, making sure that they weren't touching & that each potato (flesh side down) touched the pan. Those batches were so much more crispy! Also, I doubled the amount of oil since I was doubling the recipe, & I realized later that there seemed to be way too much oil. I'm not sure if you need to cut the oil for one recipe, but I would definitely reduce it if you're doubling the recipe. Over all, these potatoes got rave reviews.

My family loved these potatoes. I reduced the cayenne by half and that was spicy enough for some the tender palates. They were tasty, moist on the inside, easy, and can be prepared ahead of time. I don't have garlic salt, so used garlic powder- a little less than 2 teasp. - we do like garlic. The first time I made these really stuck to the pan so Thank-you to Bethesda's suggestion to heat the pan and keep the flesh side down. The potatoes did not stick and were even better the second time.

I have made this a few times and my family loves it. I find it tastes better when reheated.

I have made this a few times. It is very easy and good. I did not think it was necessary to add the salt along with the garlic salt.

This is a great recipe because you can be versatile with the ingredients and the timing. For example, I used hot pepper flakes instead of cayenne and chili and let the spuds roast for an extra 20 minutes while I was finishing up everything else. They were delicious and crispy--thank you to everyone who reinforced the idea of heating up the oil before tossing. I served them with a marinated grilled London broil and crisp-tender baby carrots and zucchini chunks.

Flavor was great and preparation easy. I microwaved the seasoned potatoes until almost tender than put them on the grill for a few minutes - afterall it's summertime.

These were good, but a little overwhelmingly flavored. I prefer using just a minced clove of fresh garlic and some herbs (esp. sage and rosemary.) The previous reviewer is right regarding sticking...Put your baking sheet in the oven, on a low rack position, and warm it up first. When at temperature, pour your potatoes out onto the hot sheet, and be sure that a large "flesh-side" of each potato piece is down against the pan. It is the contact with the hot pan in the hot oven that browns the pieces. Half way thru, remove the pan, and you should be able to flip each potato piece onto a new flesh-side with a pair of tongs.

Great potatoes - I heated the oil in my large cast-iron skillet and chopped the potatoes (russets) and mixed in the spices. They won't stick to the pan and they get a great crust.

These were yummy! I made them just as directed and they had a nice bite. Make sure to heat your pan for a few minutes before adding -- they won't stick. The only drawback is that you have to be careful what you serve them with as they are very strong-flavored -- i.e, don't serve with a delicate fish. Best with grilled meat or chicken.

These were OK, I wasn't crazy about them, but it was just something to make that was different. My family was not too thrilled with them either.
