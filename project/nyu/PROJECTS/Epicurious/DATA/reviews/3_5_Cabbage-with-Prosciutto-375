Don't put too much liquid. The cabbage really sweats. Also, Don't use a red onion, which I did.

This was wonderful! We are already cabbage fans but we really liked the thin slicing of the cabbage, and the flavor the prosciutto added. Wonderful and super easy!

This recipe seemed too simple to be true, but it is actually quite good! I used jamon serrano just because I already had some in the fridge and it was great. I don't think I sliced the cabbage thin enough because it took a bit longer to cook than indicated. Would definitely make this again for a quick, easy, delicious family dinner.

We have made this recipe twice now. It is a great weekday evening meal but I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to company. The flavor combinations are wonderful. We substitute shallots for the onions and it worked just fine.

cooked as written with the exception of using broth instead of water.

Very simple recipe that can be a main dish or a side dish. (omit the prosciutto) I always add matchsticked carrot to add color, and you can try to add different spices. Rosemary pairs nicely with the prosciutto and I top it off with parmasean. I generally add caraway seeds when I don't add the ham. I will try to add a diced tart green apple at some point.

My husband, a guest and I absolutely loved this dish. Mild, yet tasty and quite off the beaten path. The best part is that it is so easy.

When I found this recipe, I had actually been looking for a recipe for haluski (sp?). I sauteed the onions (1/2 olive oil, 1/2 butter) with diced prosciutto, halved the amount of cabbage, used around 1/2 cup (or less), of chicken broth in place of the water, cooked covered till tender, then added an equal amt. of cooked noodles tossed with butter. The family loved it.
