We absolutely loved this tonight. I was afraid to put too much zing with the horseradish with our guests so I only added 2 Tbsp, which just right for them. I would have loved to have more bite, but it was just right for everybody else. Would definitely recommend this one. Easy, easy, easy

This reciped was delicious! I served it as a side dish with beef tenderloin. I also made carmelized onions and put them on top. They addes a lot of flavor. I will definitely make these again.

Have made this twice so far and will make it again. Very simple recipe but so tasty, especially with beef. Added more horseradish to taste. Used a hand masher, not a mixer.

Add extra horseradish for an extra kick. Beware too much mixing -- gets gummy very easily.

Very tasty! I served these with the tender pork tenderloin recipe (on this site) and roasted carrots(see foodtv.com - Barefoot Contessa for this recipe) What a fantastic dinner! The sauce from the tenderloin tasted great with the potatoes.

I used lo fat buttermilk, butter & added horseradish until it was enough for us. I also do not peel the potatoes & "smash" them instead of whipping or mashing them. Peels add more vitamins. Great with beef roast. The guys always like my "smashed" potatoes. The horseradish really raised their eyebrows! Next time I'll try it with sour cream!

We all loved these potatoes!! I fixed them the night before and heated them in the oven.

These potatoes are delicious and versatile. I served them with the Cedar-Planked Maple-Glazed Salmon (also on Epicurious). The potatoes would also be wonderful with steak.

These are excellent. I served with the Rosemary Roasted Salmon (also on Epicurious) and a salad. It was a most satisfying meal.

We enjoyed this dish with flank steak. I chose the recipe, originally, just to get rid of some prepared horse radish (you just don't use that much in Bloody Marys), and it was surprisingly good. Turns out that I'll be making it more often!

I have been to the Chamberlain's in Dallas, and these potaotes taste just like the real thing. They are wonderful with a grilled dish.

Very easy to make and a great twist to the classic smashed potatoes.
