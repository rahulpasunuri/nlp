Tasty, super easy to prepare while you're making other parts of your meal. Great foundation to add beans or other ingredients. You can use whatever vegetables you want, really.

So yummy!

Great recipe - but do follow the suggestions regarding liquid. I left out the broth all together, and added the tomatoes without draining them. Delish. :)

I've made this recipe for several years and it's always a hit. I don't care for carrots so I substitute a yam. I also only use half the juice from the tomatoes. The veggies caramelize and come together in a very sweet and yummy dish.

I loved this vegetable ragu! I roasted the vegetables on a very large baking sheet, and only roasted them for 40 minutes for the first step instead of 60 minutes. I did add the juices with the tomatoes, though my tomatoes had more of a puree than juice, and added only one cup of vegetable broth. The vegetables came out perfectly - definitely not mushy as some other reviewers have experienced.

I loved the rice cakes. But,,,the ragu was just ok. lot of work and disappointing outcome. I didn't drain the tomatoes, maybe that would have been better. Also, IF i were to make this again, I think I would cut the veggies a little bigger. I had to decrease the roasting time for mine, and the result was mushy.

My husband and I thought this was really tasty. A couple of tips from my experience, following the comments made by others: I drained the tomatoes before adding them to the mix, so that the end product wouldn't be mushy. The store didn't have cremini mushrooms, so I had to improvise. The sliced mushrooms I bought got pretty "toasty," so definitely cut the mushrooms into wedges, not slices. Also, since the mushrooms release so much water, I drained the pan juices about 25 minutes into the roasting time. The combo of this ragu with the brown rice cakes is definitely worth the time it takes to chop everything up!

I'm confused by the use of broth while completing the roasting of the vegetables. It made my vegetables mushy.

My family loves this recipe. The fennel bulb was something new for us, but added a very exotic flavor that even the kids enjoyed.

Good recipe to make if you have something else to do while the vegetables are roasting. The store was out of fennel, so I lost a good taste component, however I added eggplant and that worked well. Threw in some portabellas and those were nice too. Yummy!
