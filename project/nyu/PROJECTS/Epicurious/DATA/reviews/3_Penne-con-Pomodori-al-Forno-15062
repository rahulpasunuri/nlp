A really good and novel way to cook pasta. I too like several other reviewers found it necessary to cook the pasta for about 40 minutes and to increase the temp to 400 degrees. I too used an entire can of anchovies as the can does contain around 12-14 fish. Next time I'll follow the suggestion of adding a few cloves of garlic and maybe some basil.

I love this dish - I make it with a few modifications, though - i add garlic powder, dried basil and fresh mozzerella to the layers, and it comes out better every time. It's so easy to make, so delicious and so inexpensive.

As usual, I changed up this recipe quite a bit to reflect what was in my cupboards and fridge. Here's what I had that was a totally delicious variation: small sweet organic cherry tomatos, halved. Chopped garlic. Orechiette pasta by De Cecco (like thick pasta saucers). Chili paste from a thai take-out place. Regular curly parsley. I think the rest was by the recipe. I had less liquid because of the small tomatoes. This pasta was a big hit, and great even heated as leftovers.

I took some of the comments to heart and added garlic and basil, plus extra anchovies, and then cooked it for 40 minutes, instead of 15-20. It was absolutely wonderful. This dish has become a favorite.

It was so easy, I will absolutely make this again. I loved the subtle flavor of the anchovies, I wouldn't add any more, but I will reduce the crushed red pepper that I use next time. I sprinkled it between every tomato layer, and that was too much.

This was fantastic. I love dishes that are simple to make but taste complicated! I added garlic (4 cloves, minced) and can't imagine the dish without it! You also need some nice crusty bread to sop up the sauce at the bottom of your place! Definitely one of my best summer time recipes ever! Thanks!

Very good, and even tho I added some crushed garlic and dried basil, it still lacked something; not sure what. I also think it needs more taste, perhaps more anchovies? I used two cans. Maybe the cans I used were not large enough? They sort of disintegrated. Next time I'll use more seasonings and use fresh basil instead of the parsley.

What a novel way to make a tomato sauce. I confess, though, that I cheated, and added a clove of garlic. I made it with penne and mostacholli, and look forward to trying other pastas,as well.

Very simple, very good. I added some crushed garlic and a little basil. Maybe some feta next time ... yum!

Wonderful flavour. Keeping in mind Phil's experience, I kept a close eye on how the tomatoes were cooking down. I did need to put the oven temp. back up to 400 and increase the time to about 30-35 minutes. I suspect that, if I had a cast iron pan, these steps would have been unnecessary.

This has quickly become a classic in my home. I use one whole tin of anchovies and less rather than more oil -- 1/4 to 1/3 cup max. I also like the conversational tone the recipe is written in.

I followed this recipe exactly and found it very disappointing. Besides not having a lot of flavor, it was too spicy (hot) for my guests, and the tomatoes didn't cook dow like they were supposed to so it wasn't very saucy.
