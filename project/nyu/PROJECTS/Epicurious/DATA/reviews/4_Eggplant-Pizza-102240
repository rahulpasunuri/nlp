The pizza was really good! I substituted goat cheese for the mozzarella and I added a pint of cherry tomatoes halved.

I did this on the grill and immediately topped with fresh arugula. Delicious.

I'm grateful for the recipe but i can tell without trying it that my regular pizza dough would be better. I make enough for two pies - the first rises for at least 8 hrs and the second half rises for a few more days in the fridge. But mostly I want to suggest that we don't need to waste the foil. If your baking sheet is oiled clean up is not that big a deal.

all we can say is W-o-W what a great pizza ... the garlic red pepper flake topping was amazing (we used 1 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes because we love them) and the suggestion of a light tomatoe sauce base complimented the eggplant amazingly ... it's a must try ... this is now our favourite pizza !

I love this recipe as a pizza but I cut up the egg plant and tossed it with the garlic oil and chili mixture and put it with linguini when I wanted something faster than the pizza.

The Japanese eggplant in my garden produced so much, it was beginning to be a struggle to eat. No more! The crust is a bit crispy for a knife and fork, but is so nice against the creamy eggplant and cheese. I did make the mistake of making the dough first, then broiling the eggplant. Had to wait for eggplant to cool; not the recipe's fault though! The call for "grated" mozzarella seemed a bit odd, I used the fine shredding cone on the KitchenAid and store-bought grated Parmesan. I plan to make it again just one week since the last time!

Apart from adding a thin layer of tomato sauce under the eggplant, I followed exactly. I was very happy with the pizza. The crust is light and tasty, the eggplant is delicious, and the garlic/hot pepper oil adds a perfect amount of heat.

So yummy! I used a pre-made boboli crust, as others have suggested and it was just wonderful! I eliminated the red pepper and sprinkled it with dried oregano and basil before putting it in the oven. I will be making this again!

I had some itty bitty eggplants in my garden this year, and I wanted to make something really great with them. This recipe DID NOT disappoint! I admit, because of time constraints, I used frozen pizza crust, and I used fresh chilies from my garden in the place of dried, but otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. Absolutely delicious! The normally bland eggplants are spicy and flavorful with the addition of the garlic-chili olive oil drizzled over top, and the combination of cheese is tasty. Note: The pizza is not overly oily. Normally, I try to watch how much oily food I eat, but this was just enough to add flavor without being greasy.

Seriously underwhelming. There are far better pizza crusts out there. Maybe everything hinges on the eggplant, but this was a major disappointment.

I loved the pizza and my boyfriend (who worked at a gourmet pizza place through college) said it was some of the best he'd had. I added pesto as a base on top of the crust, and also fresh tomatos and feta cheese as additional toppings.

This pizza was fabulous! It's a family favorite now!

REALLY Good!!!!

This recipe was fantastic, even for non-eggplant lovers! My family devoured it, most of whom do not like eggplant. I'd also like to note, this was the best pizza dough recipe ever! The crust was absolutley perfect. This one is a winner!

This was delicious! It was a huge hit at my house, and nobody in my family even likes eggplant! The crust was the perfect texture as well, definetley best pizza dough recipe.

I made this once a year ago and it was a flop, but I blamed myself and the lack of a pizza stone. So, today, armed with my pizza stone (and a kitchen aid mixer with dough hook) and an "Emeril" easy pizza dough recipe, I went for it again. Big mistake! This recipe is borrrrring. I am kicking myself for trying it again. Dominos could do better than this bland waste of time. Boy am I feeling bitter and hungry. :(

This was a little disappointing. Although the garlic-red pepper oil was divine, (and I will use it elsewhere), it wasn't enough to jazz up this recipe. Overall it seemed bland. I will say my mother loved it, so it may just be one of those recipes you either like or don't. So even though it wasn't bad to me it wasn't great and I will look for other pizza recipes.

YUM! Spicy and eggpplant-y. I used my own pizza crust, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Fresh mozzarella really sets it off.

Delicious--I'd give it 3.5 forks if such a rating existed. However, I had a big problem with the crust. I made the dough as instructed but it wasn't firm enough to form a ball in the food processor. I thought I made a mistake in measuring, so I repeated the process. Same problem. So, I added A LOT of flour while kneading. The crust was delicious and had the right texture, but I really think the dough needs more flour.

Awesome !!! I used whole wheat crust pre-made(TJ's)I brushed the crust and top of eggplant after cooked with garlic olive oil, I also subsituted some Pepper Jack chesse I'd had and sprinkled a few sundried tomato on it before the cheese! This was the best- and great for breakfast the next day, warm in microwave (paper plate-sm cup water, and pizza-cover with saran wrap heat for 25 sec.-the water creates moisture in the microwave so dough is not tough!)Best way to eat eggplant!!

Very good! Quick and easy too if you use a boboli crust. I liked the little "kick" of the pepper and the garlic. Will do again- always looking for different ways to prepare eggplant.

I'm a low-carber and I love this recipe with minor adaptation. Instead of the traditional crust, I used the eggplant as the crust. It also cuts down on prep time and calories... :)

I loved this pizza, but my husband did not. He thought it was way too garlicky, that's what I liked the best. I too used a boboli thin crust pizza shell rather than making my own and I added a bit more cheese. I'll make this again but I think I'll half the recipe and use a single serving crust!!

Good pizza.

This was the best pizza I've ever made. We loved it. The only thing that I would like to work on the next time I make it (and I plan to again soon) is we did find the pizza to be a bit dry. I may not have added enough cheese or enough oil when sauteing the garlic. I plan to increase both ingrediants by a little next time to give it that extra moisture.

To save time, I cheated and used a Boboli pizza crust. Loaded my Misto sprayer with regular olive oil, and threw in a lot more red pepper flakes than called for. Wow! It was all I could do not to eat the whole thing in one sitting! This will be a regular at my house from now on!

I roasted the eggplant with a light brush of olive oil for about 45 minutes. Instead of plain mozzerella, I used smoked gruyere (mixed with a little freshly grated parmasean. It wasa fantastic. With the spicy garlic oil drizzle - it is delicious!!!! I have made at least 4 times (my version) since I received magazine back in August.

I really enjoyed this pizza. I would definately make it again. I tried the olive oil spray and it worked good also.

Simply delicius and very similar to an eggplant pizza I ate in Florence - Italy. Congratulations!

My wife and I loved this easy to prepare recipe. I have used Parmesan one time and Asiago the other with very little difference. I'd probably use good Parmesan the next time.
