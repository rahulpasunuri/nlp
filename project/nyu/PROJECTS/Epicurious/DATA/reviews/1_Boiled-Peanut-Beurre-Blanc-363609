beurre blanc is a white butter sauce. beurre = butter; blanc = white. there are no eggs in a beurre blanc.

I served this with trout as a fun GA-mountain thing. I think it has huge possibilities, but something is way off with the proportions. It's not a true beurre blanc without eggs--were they left out of the ingredients? And 1 c. of reduced vinegar/wine to 1 stick of butter makes a very acid and thin sauce.I think a lot is missing from the recipe itself and the ingredients. I may try stirring boiled peanuts (chopped would be an improvement) and the gremolata into another beurre blanc base...I love the concept.
