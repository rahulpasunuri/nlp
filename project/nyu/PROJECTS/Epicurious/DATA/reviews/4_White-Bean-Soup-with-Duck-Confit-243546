Had to make some changes for what I had on hand, but came out wonderful! I made a roast duck two days before and made stock out of the carcass. So I used the leftover meat and duck stock instead of confit and chicken stock. I also used duck fat instead of olive oil, and I sauteed bacon before the veggies. Used canned beans to save time. Didn't have cognac, so omitted. Next time I will have to try the cognac, I bet it would send it over the top!

One of our favorites, especially in winter. I've made this dish a dozen times, but as a cassoulet-like main course rather than a soup. I omit the water and reduce the broth until the dish has a thick consistency. I usually use canned beans instead of dried, and saute the vegetables in duck fat if it's available, but otherwise follow the recipe.

Complex flavors. A hearty and delicious soup. Loved it. Such a great feeling to make something wonderful that you've never made before. Will definitely make it again.

Brilliant and delicious! Used dried beans soaked overnight and also used previously made duck stock in place of chix broth. Crispy duck skins are a decadent necessity.

I had made a confit of duck breast that was way too salty to eat on its own, and this soup was the perfect fix for it. I omitted the salt from the recipe, and a brief simmer of the salty duck in the unsalted soup balanced the seasonings perfectly. I made some minor modifications. Since I wanted a quick soup, I used 2 cans of cannellini beans instead of dried beans; therefore, I only added 4C of chicken broth, and I used 2 fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Additionally, I didn't have bones on hand, so I skipped that step, and I completely forgot to add the cracklings. I gave the soup a few quick pulses with the stick blender, leaving a nice balance of chunky and creamy texture. Even with these modifications (more to the form of the ingredients than the ingredients themselves), the soup was heartily delicious and filling, bursting with complex and satisfying flavors. It was quick and easy to make, and is definitely going into my repertoire. I can only imagine that following the recipe without departure would yield an even more rewarding result, as indicated by other reviewers.

Absolutely delicious! The whole clove was unusual but satisfying. The skin cracklings are musts.

I had dried cranberry beans from Iacoppi farms and Rancho Gordo. I knew they would take much longer to cook than white beans, so I handled them separately from the soup until they were nearly done. Other than that, I followed the recipe, using the bean liquor in place of the water and combining the beans and liquor with the broth and veggies to finish cooking the beans. I ended up adding 4 cu. bean liquor to 4 cu. stock and 3 cu. water (less liquid than the recipe called for). The result was one of the most satisfying full-meal soups I've made. Next time, I'll up the water a bit and add a bunch of chard or kale for a green bonus. Served with a chunk of Acme Pain au Levain and a very rich white Burgundy. Amazing!

Believably excellent given the beautiful ingredients. Served with country whole grain bread and Vermont butter. This makes a ton which we shared with neighbors and co-workers. Can't get enough of those cracklin's. I used Tom Colicchio's confit recipe because that's what I was trying to use up.

Fabulous winter soup. I just happened to have leftover Confit Duck Legs and gave this recipe a try. I followed it exactly and it was wonderul. I froze the lfetovers and they defrost and taste great. I am so sad Gourmet is gone. Where do greats like Paul Grimes go?? I have googled him and hope he shows up in other food publications. Again, great, easy and tasty recipe.

My daughters friends(age 21 ish) decided to cook a Christmas feast in my kitchen on Dec.23rd. My gift at the end was a clean kitchen (thanks to Katy) and a roast duck carcass with lots of meat and skin left on the bone. With this as a fill in for the confit I followed the recipe almost exactly. After the bones had cooked with the veggies I removed them and covered with cold water and simmered to create a stock that I used in place of the 8 cups of water. Also used an immersion blender instead of transfering solids and liquid to blender. The result as indicated in the recipe was a hearty soup that my father-in-law would have described as rich. A slice of home baked wheat bead and a glass of red wine - in the words of Alton Brown "Good Eats". Review from my 22 year old son was that he would have preferred the beans left whole and I think I concur even though I am enjoying the leftovers again today.

A really great soup. I bought duck confit legs at the butcher, then proceeded per the recipe. I followed it pretty closely, including the cognac, parsley and skin crisps. Really good, and not a lot of work on a lazy Sunday.

This is one of the most flavorful soups I have ever made. I love the addition of the cognac and the cloves, and contrary to what I thought before I made it, the fried duck skin on top is delicious. This soup is great on its own, but don't leave out the duck skin!
