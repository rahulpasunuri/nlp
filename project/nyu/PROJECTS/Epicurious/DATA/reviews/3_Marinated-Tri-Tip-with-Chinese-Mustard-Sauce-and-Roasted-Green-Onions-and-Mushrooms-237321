I'm sorry but this recipe isn't very good I followed the directions to the best of my ability, and did not stray from original recipe. The color was baby-poo yellowish brown for the sauce, which got thrown out after NOBODY wanted 2nds. Others may love this recipe but I just don't get it, the ingredients are ones I like but not this way.

I wouldn't make this dish again. The sauce was disgusting - we threw it away before using it. The tri tip came out a bit tough, but OK. Vegetables were just OK. Overall, not worth the effort.

I must admit i don't think this will be for everyone. Everyone I have had try it said it was great but very few will call it exceptional. If you are an onion and mushroom fanatic then you will love this. It one of those dishes i could eat weekly and never grow tired of it.

Wow - very easy. Sauce was great. One of my guest does not like chinese mustard so made a red wine sauce and offered both. Meat picked up flavors of the marinade. Very flavorful dinner. People forget a marinade does not penetrate the meat, acid (wine) marinades make the meat mushy if left too long.

easy and delicious, i made this last night and my husband who isn't a big red meat eater was still raving about it this morning, especially the mustard sauce, and wanted leftovers for lunch! instead of the vegetables i served it with baked potatoes with butter and chives and a simple green salad. i agree the recipe for the sauce needs to be more than doubled for a large tri tip. mine was only 3 lbs and there was barely enough sauce for the two of us. will definitely make this again.

Today will be my 2nd time making this dish - 1st time was a hit. I accidentally added too much mustard in the marinade and I purposefully added more garlic. Used a good piece of tri- tip and it was delish! Loved the roasted shrooms and onions!

Very easy and great flavor. The meat was done perfectly on the grill - about 10 minutes per side, med-high. I roasted the veggies in the oven as directed. The Chinese Mustard Sauce is Hot use sparingly! I served this with a potato salad recipe.

Re; previous entry. That was supposed to be "thin" slices.

I have made this twice and received rave reviews both times ! Get a good piece of meat to begin with. Use a meat thermometer and don't overcook. Cut thing slices on the diagonal (tip from Heartland "meat lady.") My first tri-tip was from Trader Joe's; the second from Heartland Meats at Chicago's Green Market. Try it for yourself.

Four of us put thumbs down. Depressing brown color and much too many green onions. We all had stomach pains in the morning. A big disappointment.

I found this recipe very simple and very good. I had a 2 lb. tri-tip roast so I reduced the heat to 425 and cooked for about 30 minutes. The meat was excellent, as was the sauce. Double the sauce recipe - it does not make very much.

I usually prepare Tri-Tip using the Grilled Tri-Tip Roast with Tequilla Marinade on this site, but this recipe offered a roast version. I pierced the meat with a fork and then marinaded with the red wine recipe, adding a little olive oil, for two hours. Toss the mushrooms and onions (I quartered sweet onions) in olive oil, salt and pepper and oregino. The important thing is to not overcook Tri-Tip. 120 F for medium rare is perfect and let it rest 10 minutes. I found that roasting the beef on a rack with the mushrooms and onions around at 425 degrees for 12 minutes, turning over everything and then another 10 minutes produced the desired results. Always measure with an instant-read thermometer.

This was the worst recipes yet. The meat because it was roasted was very tough, even though I marinated overnight. The timing was way off, the meat was very well done not medium rare as the recipe said. Little flavor as well. A definite do not make again.
