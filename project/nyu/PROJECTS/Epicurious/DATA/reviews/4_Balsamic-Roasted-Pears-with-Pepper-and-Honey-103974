Super Easy, Totally Delicious. Nothing else to say about it really. Except it's one of the best recipes on the whole site.

I've made this desert several times. It's a truly delicious and very easy desert to make. One small change I made was to add the honey at the same time as the vinegar, letting it roast a bit on the pears. Otherwise, Perfect!

Will definitely make again. Next time, will reduce balsamic first, peel the pears, and use Camembert as suggested by reviewer. Oh, and I used much less honey. About 2T.

This is one of those recipes I go to when we have company as well as when my husband and I are in the mood for dessert. It is super easy and can be readied for the oven before guests arrive. It has it all-- unexpected combination of honey and pepper with the goat cheese and pears is wonderful. This is a definite 4 star dessert!

This is a fantastic, easy recipe for nay occasion. I had some extra pears that needed to be used and this recipe sounded like a great way to use them. I am so glad that I tried this recipe. It was incredibly easy and came out looking and tasting very impressive. This will definitely become one of my staple recipes when pears are in season.

Mmmm...died and gone to heaven. Our pear tree is sharing its bounty so I whipped this up for lunch today. While I eyeballed measurements, the ingredients were the same and it was absolutely fabulous.

This is an excellent and extremely easy recipe. I used finely ground szechuan peppercorns rather than black peppercorns, which added a nice flavor. IMHO, the cheese is not necessary.

So easy and so flavorful! We are putting this recipe into our favorites!

Wonderful. I just set each pear half on top of a pat of butter instead of the two step melt/add pears method. I tossed some pecans in the melted butter while the balsamic cooked and served them cut side up with some portugese raw goats milk cheese and and the pecans. Mmmm...making it again right now.

Great dish. Quick, easy to prepare and the result is delicious. I made it many times, and I think it tastes good when prepared in advance. (Just reheat slightly the sauce so the butter doesn't make film on the surface...)

i have only made this dish once, but it was at least two years ago and i still can't stop thinking about it. pear recipes came up in conversation at work the other day and i raved so much about this dessert that i'm bringing several copies of the recipe to work tomorrow. i wouldn't change a thing about it. it's easy, it's relatively inexpensive, it's not a heart attack on a plate and it's incredibly luxurious. all good things. my husband didn't like cooked fruit until he tasted these pears.

This was a beautiful dish. My husband and I had it as a light dinner one night. It exceeded all my expectations with it's creamy texture and wonderful combination of flavors. The balsamic vinegar carmelizes slightly in the oven and tastes so rich and heavenly. I cannot say enough good things about this one. I'm making it again tonight because I didn't get enough of it the first time even though we each had a double portion.

This was a great and simple dessert. The mix of sweet and savory was just right for me. And with most poached/roasted pear desserts (and I've made about 2 dozen) it was not heavy and filling. Although the left overs weren't quite as good as the first night. They still got eaten.

This is really quite nice. A good change from too sweet desserts. Since I had a raw milk French Roquefort, I used that. It's a lovely combination of flavors and textures. I roasted them with a grocery store balsamic, but served them with a drizzle of tradizionale. Luscious.

I loved this recipe!!!! Although I didn't have pears, I was dying to try it. So I substituted MacIntosh apples and thought the results were delicious. It made for a good breakfast with pumpernickel toast and strong coffee. Yum!!! I think I'll try it again this week with pears.

A really unusual and easy dessert. I don't care for goat cheese and use camembert instead which I warm in the micro until it begins to run. Serve it on the side of the dish. decorate the pears with crystalised violets.

I love pears so I'm probably biased but I thought this recipe was excellent. The flavor wasn't particularly outstanding but it was still very good. I couldn't find goatcheese anywhere so I just bought some marble jack cheese and cut it into cubes. It was a big hit!

We've served this twice to company to rave reviews. It's easy to do but is a wonderful (and unusual)blend of flavors!
