This is a great summery recipe. As far as the mint problem everyone discussed...just add more mint. I added double the amt of mint and it was very delicious. Would definitely make again.

I made this dish twice. The first time, I tried it as is and made it for a friend. She thought it was incredible, but I thought that the mint flavor was lost under all those heavy lentils and the sharp feta. The second time, I used cilantro instead of mint, which drastically improved the flavor. The cilantro was assertive enough to match the feta, and the flavors melded very well.

Found this recipe after I ate something similar but much tastier at Ella's on Sacramento Street in SF. My suggestions: add 2 color lentils (red & green), fresh white corn, the red pepper as suggested, and perhaps some sugar snap peas cut in thirds for extra color. Definitely makes it more interesting and flavorful.

This was OK, but it was not as minty as I thought it would be. Also, the directions for how much water to add to the lentils were a bit odd. The feta was good, but it didn't meld well with everything else. Basically, good components that didn't work together very well, which resulted in a so-so dish. It also does *not* keep well in the fridge.

A good, light but solid dish. The feta cheese seemed a little incongrous and the salad is good with or without it.
