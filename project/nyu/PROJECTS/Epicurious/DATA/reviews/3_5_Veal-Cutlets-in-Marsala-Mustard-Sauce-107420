Fast and easy recipe that delivers great flavor. Changes - used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream, two tsp mustard and fresh dill. Definitely a keeper -- good for weekday meal or for company.

Made this dish last night-very tasty- added granulated garlic and italian seasoning to meat because I don't cook with salt (Very low-salt diet required). Also sauteed mushrooms and added to sauce. Will make again for company-complete dinner with pasta and haricot verts took 45 minutes!

Great recipe. I doubled the sauce and it is fantastic. I served this with Asparagus-Wild Mushroom Risotto with Parmesan from the FoodNetwork website - wonderful dinner.

I used thin cut lean pork chops for this b/c we don't eat veal. The sauce is amazing. My husband hates chicken marsala (one of my favorites) but he loves this recipe's combo of marsala and mustard. The fresh parsley really keeps it fresh and not too heavy. It is on our family's "Cook at least twice a month list."

Great easy recipe. My wife and daughter will not eat veal so I subsititued pork cutlets. Also a little salt and pepper on them prior to the flour. Used sweet marsala and a tablespoon of mustard and it was wonderful!

Easy and delicious. I think I'll add some mushrooms next time.

This dish is so easy to make and it had a great flavor, although I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used beef scallopini instead of veal and used dry sherry instead of the marsala. But it was very tasty and so quick to prepare.

The mustard taste is not very distinguishable. The mushrooms usually present in Veal Marsala cry for a return to lift this nondescript dish out of the duldrums. Fortunately the zucchini and tomato lasagne salad I served was exceptional and filling and made up for this disappointing veal.

Wow!!! My hubby hates mustard, but the simplistic flavors (esp the cream, mustard, marsala combo) really is flavorful! Also... I was trying to minimize on the carbs (didn't flour the veal), so let the veal brown a little, and there were still "bits" to scrape off. It was SO QUICK and so easy! Will do this again. Might try it with chicken next time...

Most delicious. I was skeptical at first about pairing mustard with marsala, but I prepared it as written and it definitely works! Very good balance of flavors.

I thought this was better than traditional Marsala sauce, which always seems so sweet (even tho I use dry Marsala). The mustard seems to cut the sweetness a little. May double next time, or use Colemans. Think I will try the dill, too, as suggested below. Did pasta & steamed veggies on side as suggested - perfect.

What a great simple easy dinner to make! We had steamed vegetables with our veal and it was fabulous. We will definately make this dish again.

I let my husband choose the menu for tonight. He loves dishes that use mustard so of course this was one of his first choices. I cooked it exactly according to the recipe except I used dill instead of parsley. I love to cook and experiment with recipes and have created many great meals, but this was really beyond comparison. We absolutely loved it. As my Greek friend who's a chef/restaurant owner would say, "It's better than sex."

I felt for a quick recipe it was very good. Throw some tortellini in a pot with a pre-made Alfredo sauce with herbs and a vegetable, a bottle of red and we had a great quick dinner.

I wouldn't waste the calories on this recipe. It was just O.K. & not really worth the bother. I missed the mushrooms from the classic & really din't like the addition of cream to the usual sauce.
