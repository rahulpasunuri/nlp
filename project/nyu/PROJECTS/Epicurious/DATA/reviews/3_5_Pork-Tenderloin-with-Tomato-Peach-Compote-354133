This is a good recipe. I liked it. We ate it and enjoyed it. I just wasn't crazy about it. I don't know that I will make it again. My boyfriend liked it more than I did. I liked the peaches but wasn't crazy about the tomatoes in the compote. However, my boyfriend thought that the tomatoes balanced the flavors nicely. Yet, I still wouldn't make it again.

Made this with pork chops and really ripe, fresh peaches and tomatoes. Just used some good quality curry powder on the meat, and sea salt instead of sugar in the compote. Lots of flavor - will definitely make this again (in fact I'm making it again tonight).

MUST USE fresh peaches and (preferably heirloom) tomatoes. Very nice, very easy summer dish.

I made this last night and my husband said it was the best new thing we've had in a long time. I couldn't get a pork tenderloin so I used thick cut boneless loin chops. I had six chops, and unscientifically increased the recipe. Doubled the spices, used a lot more tomato than called for and so forth. I didn't use garlic because we don't really like it, but I doubled (tripled?) the ginger. My husband and I both found the compote delicious. I was able to find a very fresh peach that was full of flavor, but the tomatoes in the stores are nothing special. Hopefully later in the summer it will be better. I will definitely be putting this in regular rotation.

I served this dish for a summertime dinner party for 8 and there were raves all around. Be sure not to overcook the pork. I like it just a little pink. It remains moist and flavorful, kindly accepting to the flavors of the compote.

Wow... surprisingly delicious! I added a little white wine to the onions while they were cooking and a tablespoon of butter... it gave the compote more flavor. Also a sprinkle of hot pepper flakes (which I pretty much put on almost everything) is great for a slight kick. The rub for the pork was absolutely perfect... Will definitely make again!

Very tasty. I read the reviews before making this recipe and took the advice of a few reviewers plus added a few of my own ideas to the compote. The wet rub worked fine except that it burned a little bit in the pan in the oven. I scooped out the obvious burned stuff before deglazing the pan with white wine, as suggested by one reviewer. That worked great. I also added just a hint of cumin and probably 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. I also added a little more than the suggested amount of sugar, and then cooked everything down just a bit longer with about 1/4 cup of chicken broth. That added just enough salt and flavor to really set off the other flavors. It was delicious.

Not the best pork t-loin recipe I've found, but very good. We both really enjoyed it - the compote is delicious with the pork. Worth keeping around in case I get tired of some of my other favorite pork recipes, but not out-of-this-world.

This dish has a lot of potential, but needs a few adjustments in my opinion. First off, I'd use a dry rub next time. When you sear meat with a wet garlic rub, the garlic burns and sticks to the pan. Burnt garlic is not good. I think a dry rub made from pepper, salt, coriander & cumin (maybe minced ginger) would work. Then the compote: I agree that it needs a little booster. I sauteed the onions for a long time on low heat, then added the tomato and peach. But the magic ingredients were 1/8 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground coriander and salt to taste. I left out the thyme because I felt it would clash with the peaches - good call. My wife & I though it was really good. It made a nice savory, rich sauce that worked great with the pork. Some bitter greens would make a good side dish to compliment the sweetness on the dish. I also recommend a Zin or Pino with a lot of stewed fruit taste to compliment the compote.

This was fine, but not wonderful...the flavors just didn't seem to work together that well. There are better prok tenderloin-fruit preparations on the website, particularly the Island Pork Tenderloin Salad. Probably won't make this one again.

Tenderloin was very tender, juicy, and the rub brought out the flavor. Compote was kind of innocuous. It needs a little something, and I'm inclined to try the others' suggestions to add habaneros or maybe a little cayenne. Maybe some cumin for the compote . . .

I thought this was just okay. I really think I should have listened to the person who rated below who added habenaros or something to it. I thought that the compote was okay, but somewhat boring.

absolutely delicious! super easy! i would recommend chopping the tomatoes & peaches smaller than recommended,more of a dice. Peaches were in season (and delicious) but we added the sugar b/c they weren't quite ripe yet. I would definitely try this again with super ripe peaches and no sugar. YUMMY!

I was looking for a quick recipe and although it took a little longe then anticipated the pork was wonderfully tender and the compote is fabulous. Definitely will add this to our favorites.

Easy and delicious!! The combination of peach, curry & tomato was so good. My friend said that it tasted like a "restaurant quality" dish...even our young children liked it! I served it with the green beans with sweet onion vinaigrette (also on this site). This dish will go into heavy rotation at our house as long as tomatoes and peaches are in-season.

Seasonal, flavorful, and so easy to make.

I loved this recipe. It was very easy and fast. It was also a nice change to have something not grilled this time of year. We added 3 seeded and minced habanero peppers to the compote which complemented the sweetness well. We also had to deglaze the pan because there were so many bits that did not come up when we sauted the onion. I had to use sherry because I was out of white wine. It was all very delicious. Definitely will make again.

We enjoyed the pork but even that was not as flavorful as I expected. I let the rub sit on the meat for about an hour. The compote was unique, but it did not have much flavor. We served the dish over white rice and also had a salad.

The rub was delicious; the compote was a bit bland.

yum, will make it again soon.

This is flavorful and quick recipe. My 12 yr old daughter had seconds!! I saved about a 2 tsp of the rub to add to the compote and it did add a bit more ginger/curry flavor.(I always make a bit more than the recipe calls for for rubs) This is a keeper!

We made this with mango instead of peach, and used our own concoction of spices (turmeric, cumin, coriander, etc) rather than store bought curry powder. The store had run out of pork tenderloin so we had to use thick cut boneless loin chops. The pork came out a tad dry, but that is always true of pork nowadays. The compote and rub were so delicious it made up for it. I'd make it with fish or other better tasting meats in the future.
