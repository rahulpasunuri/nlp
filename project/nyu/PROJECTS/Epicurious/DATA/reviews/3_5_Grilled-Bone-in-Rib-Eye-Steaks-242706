This is was very good. I found another great way to make rib-eyes using cast iron at www.thegrilllife.com

Generously salt those babies at least 6 hours before cooking to intensify flavor. Be sure to bring them to room temperature before cooking to ensure even cooking. I suggest rare for rib-eyes, so cut down on cooking time. And, for christ's sake, make yourself a good marinade. Rib-eyes are good all by themselves, but they can always be enhanced. Finally, be sure to let your steaks rest for ten minutes after taking them off the grill. This will allow the juices (which contract to the center of the meat while on the heat) to redistribute.

If you really want to do this up, cook several cloves of garlic in the olive oil BEFORE you put it on the meat. Some thyme also helps to bump up the "smokiness" of it and give it a nice flavor. I also like to put some of the stems from my rosemary under the steaks as they're grilling. Sauteed mushrooms and onions along with a small pat of butter make the ideal topping.

Even though ribeye is the perfect gilling meat, it can still be kicked up a couple of notches. Throw some Worchestershire sause and a good house pepper blend (Montreal Steak blend, or better yet, Ye Olde Spice Shop in St. Charles Mo has a garlic pepper that is out of sight). Sear and then go indirect as the recipe indicates, and then get ready as your guests will inhale the finished product. Should go well with the blue cheese tomatoes, or perhaps grilled corn.

I've been cooking bone in rib eye steaks just like this for years now. I believe there are two keys to making this a success... fresh well marbled beef at least 2-3 inches thick a and a preheated grill to cook the beef a temperate of not less than 400 degrees.

How will I ever get my hands on all those ingredients?

Simple and delishious. I often rub them first with a cut clove of garlic.
