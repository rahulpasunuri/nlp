I was so surprised to see this receipe with only 2 1/2 forks. It is fabulous!

I have had this recipe saved for a while thinking that my kids under 6 - big fans of both pepperoni and spaghetti - would love it. In the words of my 2 year old - YUCK - it was even too bland for them.

I liked this recipe. My husband thought it was barely so-so. I doubt I'll make it again since I dind't absolutely have to have more. But the flavor was pretty good.

I did not include the pepperoni or sour cream when I made this last night but they were still good. (I know they'd have a lot more flavor with pepperoni and would probably warrant a higher score with the meat.) Made this last night to accompany the Poached Ginger Salmon Steaks - it was a good combination

I HAVE BEEN MAKING THIS RECIPE AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH SINCE IT WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN 1993. IT IS QUICK AND DELICOUS AND GOOD THE NEXT DAY.
