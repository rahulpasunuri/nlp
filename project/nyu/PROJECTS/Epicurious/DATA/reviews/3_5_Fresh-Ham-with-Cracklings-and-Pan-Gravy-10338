Made this today, 4/8/12, Easter. It was fantastic. Used a 10lb fresh, (that's brown) ham. Also used a 24 oz can of Miller beer. Followed the directions with the exception of making the cracklings. (just not our thing.) Left the skin intact, although pierced, and roasted away. Added beef broth as needed, once the beer started evaporating. It made the best pan gravy ever. The beer really added the oomph to this dish. Thank you. I will make this again.

I have been cooking with beer for years and it is the secret of many of my gravies. Some beers have a high sugar content and will burn if they evaporate especially if they are mixed with pan drippings that as they concentrate can get beyond 212 (boiling point of water )to the actual oven temperature or beyond if your heat source is close to the pan. add water as necessary or better yet beef stock or more beer or both to make sure nothing in the pan burns. as for dry meat the teqnuqie here is flawless the idea of the hot oven at the start is to seal the meat and keep the juices in I would go to a 550 oven if my oven runs cold (if your oven has thin walls or bad insulation it will cool too fast also opening the door drops the temperature at least 100 degrees so wait a few minutes before turning the temp down, The 160 degree recommendation after all is from the government (nuf said) some how Europeans have survived on rarer cuts for centuries, the press has us so germophobic that i have read article that our immune systems are actually compromised because we don't get a chance to fight them off. I am a fan of "black and blue" steaks and really rare lamb chops and have somehow survived to the age of 60 with out a day in the hospital. people who dried this out were afraid of non existent cysts in their meat also if you are using a meat thermometer make sure you are reading meat temperature and not bone temperature I put fresh thyme in the slices in the rind to kick it up a notch (don't forget to use diamond crystal kosher salt morton has the sodium alumninate in it which will ruin any thing you cook (think of tasting your septic pencil )) this recipe you will have to work at to screw up one more tip put your flour in a small jar with a bit of cold beer or ice cold water and shake it up before mixing it with your gravy and you will never get a lump ( starch only de-solves in COLD water)

The guidelines to the cooking temperatures has changed dramatically since 1990, as of now, the temperature to which pork should be cooked, has been lowered from well done or 170 (77C) to medium 160 F (70 C). This allows sufficient cooking to ensure the meat is safe to eat (trichina, now virtually nonexistent in pork, is killed at 137 F /58 C). While the National Pork Producers Council & USDA recommend cooking pork to "medium" or an internal temperature of 160 F (70C), they also suggest removing larger cuts of pork such as roasts, from the oven when they reach 155 F ( 68 C). The meat will rise in temperature as it stands before carving, in a phenomenon known as "carryover cooking."

Hi! In my opinion it should be better specify the specific fresh ham suitable for the recipe uploaded. I am fanatic of Italian ones (for example my last discovery is http://www.renieri.net/prosciutto_e.html ) but I am also sure that not all recipes go well with Italian fresh ham!

I have been making fresh ham for over 20 years- it has NEVER been dry, if anything it can be dark on the outside and undercooked on the inside if cooked too fast or if not brought to room temp before roasting. My suspicion is that those with dry meat did not start with a RAW piece of PORK. This recipe was great, easy, and tasty. I would recommend being conservative with the salt as it can result in a very salty gravy. Caution that it could take longer to roast if the roast is more than the 8-10 lbs mentioned. About 20"/lb is expected, meat thermometer is a MUST!

Have been making this for YEARS it is a favorite of my guests..."when are you going to make that ham with cracklins again?". Amount of beer needed can vary, you have to gauge it and use a meat thermometer of course. I've never had a problem with meat turning out dry or undercooked.... and great with sandwiches next day!

I will never make this recipe again. I read all the reviews, took out the meat when it reached 170 degrees and it was so undercooked. I microwaved some slices and threw the rest out. The gravy was pretty tasty. No more pork for my family.

This recipe led to a large piece of $17.00 dried-up-on-the-outside, pink-on-the-inside meat. As a butcher's daughter I know what fresh ham is, and I purchased the right piece of meat. I roasted it exactly according to the recipe directions - but after several hours the "face" of the ham was clearly cooked, although the thermometer only read 130. I had the great idea of slicing off the cracklings in strips and using toothpicks to skewer them over the exposed meat of the ham. This did serve as a baster for the meat, but in the end I had to slice off pieces and put the rest of the ham back to cook more -- several times. Thank goodness my father, who I had made this recipe for, was unable to attend at the last minute. ALSO - the amount of liquid (1 bottle of beer) was insufficient to prevent REALLY dark brown fond from forming. Although I ended up adding some more liquid around the three-hour mark, the drippings still had an almost burnt flavor that was not pleasing. Yes, there is a reason that they smoke hams!

Just making sure that people know that a "fresh ham" is an uncured raw pork roast that is a cut from the "ham" of the pig. I have a suspicion that those who thought that the recipe yeilded a dry piece of meat, thought that a fresh ham was a cured ham that you just bought or one that talked back in a sassy way.

This was a huge success. I do recommend a meat thermometer so you don't under/over cook the meat. The next time I make it the only change I will make is to cut back on the salt. The meat was delicious but I found the gravy a little too salty for my tastes. Not all agreed with me.

This was the best ham we have ever had. It was incredibly juicy and tender. This recipe is a keeper.

Fresh ham has always been a family treat for holiday meals. Plan on enough time for meat to cook (it took 4 1/2 hrs for 18 lbs using an electronic meat therometer). Score rind into 1.5 inch squares before baking to assure more crispy cracklins by end of baking. Used electric knife to cut through tough hide. EVERYONE was happy with meat. 'Better than grandma's preparation!" (VERY high praise)

I used a 9 lb. boneless ham and doubled the beer. I took it out of the oven at just over 160 and thought it was done perfectly. Everyone loved the gravy and craklings. It made a great Easter dinner with not too much trouble.

Pork shouldn't be cooked to over 160 degrees. You should take the meat out of the oven when it reaches 150 and allow it to rest. No wonder this meat is coming out dry. It's overcooked!

The gravy was really good, but the meat was very disappointing - - much too dry, even though I watched it carefully and used a meat thermometer. My Mom's simple recipe is much moister. Sorry I made this the centerpiece of Easter dinner. I won't bother doing this one again.

A little on the dry side, should have doubled the beer! Didn't bother with the crackling, but no one missed it. Made wonderful leftovers.

This is really, really delicious. I didn't make the cracklings and gravy.

This was the first time I ever made a fresh ham and it was delicious. It took about an hour longer in my oven, which I hadn't planned on, so I didn't make the cracklings and my gravy came out kind of so so, sort of burnt, but the meat itself was tender and moist and all my guests loved it, including the kids who had it with applesauce.

This was an explosion of flavors in our mouths! It's my husband's new favorite dish! I used double the beer and left out the sage. The gravy was unbelievable. I put sauted mushrooms over the pork and topped it with the gravy. It was so tender we could easily cut it with a fork. I sauted red sweet peppers in a balsamic reduction for the perfect accompaniment. I am looking forward to the next time, I'll make sure we have company to share this one!

This was very well recieved by my family. We loved the gravy. To the cook from Laguna, did you try the recipe? Or are you just lurking about to trash other reviewers comments. If you note, the stay at home mom said she didn't have time to make cracklings NOT that she wasn't allowed.

We made this for St. Patrick's Day this year - What a success story!! It took 5 hours to cook a 14-lb leg - but so worth waiting for. The gravy was also fabulous. The cracklings, however, were not favorably received. If you have ever had pork rinds, this is cracklings!! Everyone was polite and tried them, but no one took seconds, except my dog!:) I would pass on making them as they are extra work and greasy work to boot. I do think that the pork rind was a part of the success of this dish because it kept the meat moist. The moral: leave it on for the roasting phase, then discard it with the layer of fat.

Tell us that your review is a joke, cook from Columbia, S.C. Right?! You didn't do the cracklings because you are a stay-at-home mom? Aren't stay-at-home moms allowed to make cracklings? Ha Ha! Come on!

I only gave it 3 forks because I didn't do the cracklings. I am a stay at home mom, so I didn't have time. All in all it was well worth the effort.

It's hard to find a recipe that brings out the best in fresh ham -- this is a great one! The cracklings are a bit of trouble but worth it; diners like the interest, taste, and uniqueness.
