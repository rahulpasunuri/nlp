This was met with no ethusiasm at a New Year's Eve cocktail party that I hosted. While pretty, the flavor was too "fishy" for many of the guests. Be sure that your friends are BIG seafood fans before serving this one.

This is easy to make. The baked salmon fillet combined with cold smoked salmon is great.

I haven't tried it. I am stumped as to whether recipe calls for cold smoked salmon or hot smoked salmon. The recipe reads deliciously.
