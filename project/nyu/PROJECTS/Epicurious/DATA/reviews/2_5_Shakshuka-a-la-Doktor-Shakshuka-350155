Never never use canned tomatoes in shakshuka! It's meant to use very ripe or overripe tomatoes that are no longer good for salad. In the Old City, across from Shoreshim Books, we had shakshuka with tomatoes, eggplant, and onions. Good olive oil makes the dish.

The shakshuka came out amazing. We used spicy canned tomatoes and added mushrooms, bell peppers, and pepper jack cheese. Spread over bread, even with some avocado, it made the perfect brunch. B'tavon!

This recipe was decent, but not outstanding. It didn't have the zest of shakshuka that I've eaten in Israel, or even in New York (try the shakshuka at Hummus Place!). I won't make it again.
