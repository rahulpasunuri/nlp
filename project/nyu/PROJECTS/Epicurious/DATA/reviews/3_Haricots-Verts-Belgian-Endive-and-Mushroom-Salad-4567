Seemed rather tasteless.

Too many mushrooms. I made an overdose. Howver this is a great base for stir fry whatever. I had left overs and used the undressed salad as part of a stir with cubed chicken breasts and Thai sauces.

This a deliciously crunchy and savory salad. A must-try!

This was a light and refreshing salad. There are a lot of interesting tastes. If you love endives, you'll really love this salad.

Great salad. It is a good accompaniment to a meal that requires more than just greens. Easy enough for a weeknight and definitely a must for company.

I made this for a New Year's eve buffet and it was a big hit. I used frozen haricots verts from Trader Joe's -- easy and delicious. The flavor combinations and different textures of the ingredients make it a really appealing dish. I'll definitely make it again.

Fantastic side dish! We served it with Christmas dinner and were thrilled. A wonderful, super-easy alternative to a salad, and much greater than the sum of its parts.

I made this salad on Christmas Eve last year, and it was a hugh success. Very refreshing, light and lovely and I plan on making it again this weekend for my guests.
