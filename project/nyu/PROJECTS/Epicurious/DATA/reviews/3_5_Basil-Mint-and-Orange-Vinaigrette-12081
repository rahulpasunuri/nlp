After reading the others' reviews, I feel like I've done something wrong. My vinaigrette came out terribly. First, after something like 5 minutes in the blender it was very tattered looking...I left it like that as I didn't want to over emulsify it. My son told me it made his nose run and smelled like bathroom cleaner...after a taste, I had to agree.

Wonderful and so easy. I used a whole orange and its zest. To the reviewer below me: throw everything in a blender instead of chopping!

It's great. Does take a while though, to chop up all of those herbs.

This is really a nice citrus dressing. Used the last of the mint and basil from the garden and drizzled on big salads topped with a piece of sauteed flounder. I did use white balsamic vinegar and since I didnt have an orange, a couple drops of Orange oil did the trick. Will definitely keep this one.

I increased the amount of orange zest and substituted grapeseed oil. The dressing was great on a simple salad of field greens, shallot and goat cheese. Whatever you do--I highly recommend using goat cheese. The combination of flavors is INCREDIBLE!

I use this dressing to make an amazing chicken salad. Toss cooked chicken cubes with this dressing, some arugula, and chopped oily sun-dried tomatoes. it's addictive.

Something a little different! I added a dash (probably a teaspoon or so) of lime juice to brighten it up a bit more and people were sopping up the remains in the salad bowl with bread! I used this on a chopped veggie salad as part of a middle-eastern menu.

Wonderful, fresh vinaigrette. The mint and orange really add something special. Perfect over tomatoes and feta or mozarrella.

We really enjoyed this dressing. Brightens up a salad for summer.
