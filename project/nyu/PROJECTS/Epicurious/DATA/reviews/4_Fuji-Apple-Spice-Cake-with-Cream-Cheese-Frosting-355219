This is my second review. I halved the sugar in this recipe - both for the cake and frosting. For the cake, I kept to the all the brown sugar that was called for and only used 1/4 cup of white. I also swapped half of the fuji for a tart granny smith. Perfect!

This cake was fantastic! I followed the recipe as written and was very pleased with the results, as were all of my co-workers. The frosting was easy and really good, especially with the cake. I used Honeycrisp apples, and they worked out beautifully.

I swapped half of the plain flout for wholewheat, used the same amount of applesauce and butter and the texture was good - not too dry. As others have written, this cake is just too sweet. I cut down on the amount of sugar in the cake and in the frosting and still found it too sweet. Will probably cut the sugar in the cake by half the next time I bake it. Yes, I will bake it again because it had a beautiful crumb and texture. Will probably switch out the Fuji apples for something a little more tart, as well.

I had to make a dessert for a crowd but couldn't do anything with chocolate or nuts, so I made this (subbed currants for the pecans). This cake was really good! I cut back on the sugar as others suggested to 1 C granulated and used a scant 3/4 C of the brown. Don't skip the liquor- I used dark rum and it was a nice addition. And the frosting was delicious as well. It cut beautifully too. I've saved it to my recipe box and will definitely make it again.

I felt like this cake was WAY too sweet, the sugar needs to be reduced. It is moist and I love the texture that the apple gives it. I will make this again but next time I will definitely reduce the sugar and increase the applesauce.

Super silky, gorgeously rich... I made cupcakes, with some revisions based on the feedback of others as well as what I had available: reduced sugar to 1 cup and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, dark spiced rum, used chunky homemade applesauce that was pretty sweet (leftover from apple-cider brined pork chops), used very ripe fresh pears instead of the apples, and no nuts. Really tasted much more sophisticated than it seemed... I baked the cupcakes tonight and will frost in the morning.

My cake was very dense but not dry. It did have a similar consistency to carrot cake. There was no need to level the cake crowns, as the cakes were kind of flat and did not have crowns. I thought there were too many pecans. The cake would have benefitted from a lot more spices. Made enough to feed an army. No one in my family cared for the cream cheese frosting. The cake was ok, not awful, but it wasn't a hit with my family and we don't usually stock applesauce, so I won't make again.

Made this for my husband's birthday and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved it and my husband (who is not a huge dessert fan) refused to give any of the small amount of leftovers away - he wanted it all for himself! Only changes I made were to add a little more spice per other reviewers recommendations, 1 more apple (used Fuji), and did not add nuts to the batter (still toasted some pecans and added on top). It was pretty easy to make but does take some time. Cream cheese frosting was good - not too sweet - but I might also try the caramel frosting suggestion. My family (little kids included) can't wait for me to make this again! Really yummy!!!

The only addition I made to this was to add a little more apple. I love fruit rich deserts so I put in an extra apple. The only critique I got was that I could have spiced it a little more. Next time I"ll keep that in mind but this turned out really, really well.

I have a lot of feelings about this cake. First, the base is awesomely yummy (to the last reviewer - it may have been dry due to overbaking. I took mine out after only 38 minutes and it was about as done as it could have been without being dry). Second, even though the cake is totally addictive, it is awfully, face-puckeringly sweet. I cut the white sugar down to 1 cup, which turned out well. But the sugar in the cream-cheese frosting could also be cut way down. (One reviewer mentioned sweetening their cream-cheese frosting with maple syrup, which sounds like a good idea.) I think if I make this cake again, I might do it as a Bundt or sheet cake and drizzle it with a simple, thin glaze of lemon/water/confectioner's sugar. The cake itself is so moist and perfect and I think the cream cheese frosting overpowers it a little. However - not gonna lie - I can't stop eating it, even with all these feelings that I feel about how it could be improved upon. I will also say that it benefited from a night in fridge. I couldn't really wait the full hour for the frosting to set after making it last night (could you?), and it was sort of a slip-n-slide. This morning, after firming up in the fridge, it was much improved.

This had a great taste (I did lower the sugar content by almost half) but it was a little dry.

Excellent cake. I bake often for work and they said this morning that is was the best ever! I followed the recipe, except for using homemade sweetened applesauce and decreasing the white sugar to 1 cup. I also used the bourbon. It seemed perfect. Definitely a keeper!

This was my first time to make an applesauce cake or any type of spice cake. I tried to closely follow the directions. But I did reduced the sugar in this, based on other reviews, and it was still so sweet that I decided not to frost it. While it was delicious, I thought it was too much work/effort for something that is a rustic style cake. In my opinion, it is also unnecessarily unhealthy. The quantity butter and sugar seemed extraneous. It's not a particularly "decadent" desert that would seem to justify the amount of butter and sugar. Next time I'd opt for a simpler, healthier applesauce bread.

I've made this cake three times now, and each time it's come out beautifully and been a complete hit. I use unsweetened homemade applesauce instead of store bought, I add cloves instead of nutmeg, use half whole wheat flour, and use more interesting apples than Fuji, such as York or Winesap. Good aromatic sweet-tart pie apples. I also use a honey-sweetened butter-cream cheese icing instead of the powdered sugar recipe listed here. The last time I made it, I added golden raisins to the cake. The end product has been amazing each time!

I followed the recipe and used rum. I decorated the top with toasted pecans and also some pomegranate seeds, which made it look very nice. The cake was ok but too sweet (and I like sweet desserts). It was more work than the average cake and not worth it.

Rating: 4
Anyone have difficulty with this cake falling apart after you cut a few slices? Fantastic flavor, but I've made it twice, following the recipe exactly, and both times had serious structural issues. The thing literally crumbled into pieces. Giving 4 forks because no one else has mentioned a problem and the cake tastes amazing, so I don't want to drag the rating down.

I made this cake this weekend past (October 2, 2010) for an early Thanksgiving meal. Everyone liked it very much. I would decrease the sugar the next time, indeed. It was too sweet, although yummy. I used Gala Apples, and they were fine. The recipe isn't difficult to follow.

This was very easy to make and frost. It was a perfect fall cake and looked beautiful. I followed the recipe exactly, but left out the bourbon. It is definitely worth taking the time to toast some pecans for the top; they were a huge hit.

This is an excellent recipe, so excellent I'm going to try to sell it. It would be better for me, however to make a smaller cake to sell. I am trying to figure out how I would bake the cake in a smaller pan, like a mini (4 in wide and 2 in tall) bundt pan or an 8 in round cake pan. Any ideas?

This is one of my favorite cakes to make. I always get rave review with it. As a mater of fact, yesterday I won second place at my company picnic baking contest with it. Thanks to whoever created this wonderfulk recipe!

i made this cake vegan (i.e. without any animal products) by substituting nondairy margarine in place of the butter and ener-g brand egg replacer in place of the eggs. for the frosting i used tofutti brand dairy-free cream cheese. the results were FANTASTIC. i've baked dozens of different cakes and this was one of the best ever. scrumptious.

Fabulous! Easy to make (although I didn't have to cut the top off the layers because they didn't rise very much)and deliciously moist and flavorful. I used Calvados. I think you could easily make this as a sheet cake with no frosting, too.

Rating: 4
This cake smelled simply divine in the oven, and the taste matched the smell! I thought with all that applesauce, why so much butter, so I cut back to 3/4 cup butter and added an extra 1/4 cup of applesauce. I bet more could be cut out without any ill effects. Made this for a dinner party where someone had a nut allergy, so I substituted 1.5 cups golden raisins, which I simmered in 3 tablespoons of bourbon until they plumped and absorbed the bourbon. Went ahead and added the auggested 2tbs bourbon into the batter as well. I would like another slice of this cake right now just writing about it! mmmmMMMMMMMM!

Excellent results even with less sugar, otherwise followed recipe exactly. Cake did not rise at all, has anyone else had this happen or is it supposed to be dense?

Wonderful, moist cake. Keeps well for several days. Made it for Thanksgiving using dark rum and everyone loved it.

Someone gave us 2 huge crates of apples which made 10 liters of apple juice and 12 cups of applesauce. I needed a recipe that used as many apples and applesauce as possible and yielded a delicious cake worth my time. I made this recipe 6 times and everyone I gave a cake to raved over it. I followed the recipe except for the frosting and I used my tried & true recipe for the frosting: 4oz. cream cheese beaten w/2t. vanilla and 2C. powdered sugar. Beat 1C. cream until firm and fold into cream cheese mixture. YUM!

Amazing! This cake tastes like it came from a high-quality professional bakery. I made the cake as directed except that I used Calvados apple brandy and added in an extra chopped apple based on other reviewers' feedback. Next time, walnuts could probably be substituted for the pecans.

A Cook from Toronto: Is the recipe w/ caramel sauce you speak of this one? http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Apple-Walnut-Upside-Down-Cake-with-Calvados-Caramel-Sauce-13278 Am baking this right now and it sure smells delish!! Already made the cream cheese frosting but the caramel one sounds promising...

I have already made this cake twice and I'm being asked for it again - it is really good. I made it just as directed (used rum for the booze because that's what I had). It has been devoured both times.

This cake is AMAZING. I made a dairy-free version, and used a mix of margarine (without trans fat) and apple sauce instead of the butter. But... I doubled the recipe and completely goofed on doubling the butter, which I only realised until just before putting this into the oven. I tried to make up for it by mixing in a bit of oil into the batter in the pan. It ended up being perfectly fine and still very moist, even with ~1/2 the fat content. I used local organic jonagolds instead of fujis; also delish.

Terrific cake!! I added raisins and made the applesauce from scratch with no added sugar. Really nice crumb and lovely spices too. The frosting was awesome and not too sweet. Definitely would make again!!!

This was great cake. I cooked it a smidge too long because I failed to adjust the time for my convection oven. The frosting was phenomenal. I had walnuts on hand and substituted them for the pecans.

This is a woderful cake. It has great texture and is rich without being overly sweet. The frosting adds more richness without being too sweet. The frosting is probably the best version I have used. Too often cream cheese frostings are cloyingly sweet. All the flavor elements compliment each other well. I followed the recipe as written. Bourbon was my choice of alcohol. This is the best apple spice cake I have tasted.

I made this in a bundt pan. And substituted 1/2 c non-fat yogurt for half of the butter. The cake turned out super moist. It is good, but I prefer a good pumpkin cake with cream cheese frosting over this.

Have made this lovely cake 2X to rave reviews! The first time, as written and the second with the caramel frosting from November's Bon Appetit. It was devoured both times, but I think I prefer the caramel frosting.

I followed the recipe exactly (I added the 2tbs calvados brandy) and I thought it was ok, but nothing special. I found it a little dry and underspiced, and there weren't enough apple bits for me.

This was a fine spice cake but it really fell short in the apple department. I had expected more of an apple flavor and I found the cream cheese frosting to be overly sweet and not so cream cheesey.

Truly moist and delicious. I omitted brandy and pecans (which my husband dislikes) and found the cake delightful. The apple flavor was great, especially with the spice. Definitely a do-again.
