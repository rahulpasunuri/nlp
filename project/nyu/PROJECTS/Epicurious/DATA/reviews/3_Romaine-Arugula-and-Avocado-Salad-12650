Really nice, simple salad. Emulsifying the dressing really gave it a nice, creamy consistency (without a ton of fat). Great way to use all these summer greens.

I added about 3 Tbs. of sliced black olives to this. It turned out very good, but next time I would replace the cider vinegar/oil mixture with a bottled red wine or balsamic vinaigrette, as my family did not much care for the dressing as it is written. Super simple, though, thus the 3 forks.
