Love watermelon and lime! Such an amazing,refreshing combo. However, I'm not the biggest cilantro fan. Mint is the perfect substitute (perhaps a little basil could be interesting too). I go a bit heavy with the lime juice as well - it's so good and tart - I find myself slurping up the leftover juices. Delightful!

This was a great super easy recipe that got reviews. The cilantro adds a little something extra and everyone loved the taste of the rum contrasting with the other flavors

I thought I didn't like watermelon until I made this salad. Now I want to try every watermelon salad on this site. I didn't notice in the instructions that only 2 teaspoons of lime juice are called for and I used all of the juice from the lime. Which I think was a good idea! Also, a wee bit more rum was tossed in. A dash of cayenne pepper as suggested by other reviewers was an inspired addition. This is only the third recipe in as many years that we've awarded 4 forks. It was a truly wonderful side dish.

This is a wonderful salad! I took the suggestion of adding the jicama and cayenne. Everyone at the party loved it and I'm making it again this weekend!

For an interesting variation, add sliced jicama and sprinkle the salad with a dash of cayenne pepper. The sweet of the fruit, sour of the lime, and heat of the cayenne dance on the tongue!

A wonderful summertime dessert. Got rave reviews from some very picky eaters.

Delicious and refreshing! This recipe is very easy, a little bit different, and the perfect compliment to a spicy Southwestern meal!

I followed the advice of a previous cook and added the feta cheese. The salad was very good, but I would not add the cheese next time to the salad, but perhaps offer it for each person to use according to their individual taste. This would also make the salad more appealing when reserving the leftovers. Salad was very refreshing.

For a quick, light dessert, this refreshing rendition of watermelon is wonderful. At times, when cilantro was not on hand, I have substituted fresh mint. Served in balloon crystal goblets and topped with a lime garnish, it is a lovely ending for a warm-weather meal.

Add some feta cheese-chunked and it's a real winner
