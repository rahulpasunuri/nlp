I have made this tart so many times and it is always a hit with family and friends. Definetly double the onions, as they do cook down, and I didn't have enought goat cheese last time I made it so I added mozzarella as well. Don't forget extra basil and foil the crust at the end.

What is the problem with making the dish using the recipe given? Everybody thinks they're "special"? There's the same problem with something as simple as Buffalo wings- people use BBQ sauce or chipotle- change the blue cheese to something else- that's all fine but you don't get to call them Buffalo wings.

I LOVE this recipe. I used leeks and much prefer them to the onions. And homemade pesto drizzled on top before serving is really nice too.

This is a beautiful dish! Great appetizer for anytime. I sprinkle a few pine nuts on top before broiling. This gives the pie a tasty crunch. And, don't forget to add minced garlic to the onion mixture!

Pretty easy and very tasty. A nice way to do something a little different with your summer tomatoes. Looks pretty too, though mine fell apart a little when cut.

Really enjoyed this. Made my own pie crust, used double the onions as suggested and added some oregano. I also used traditional goat cheese (not Goat's milk Feta). Feta may add that saltiness that is often enjoyed with a sweet/salty combo.Maybe I'll try that next time!

This recipe came out fantastic and was a lovely way to use some of the tomatoes from our garden. I made a pie dough in the cuisinart; which was quick and easy. Only had half the feta on hand, so didn't sprinkle any on top. Served with a chickpea salad, grilled shrimp and a bottle of Vouvray wine. WOW. My family loved it. My Mother asked me to make one for a luncheon she's having!!!! One caveat, do not forget the foil around the edge of the crust, I know from experience that it will burn.

This is one of my all time favorite summer recipes. I do double the onion and I just add julienned basil on the top at the very end. That way you get the flavor without it being cooked to death. I also add pine nuts at the end so they get a bit roasted. It is a good addition of flavor.

I've been making this tart for a couple of years, and we love it. I use fresh tomatoes in the summer, but remove most of the seeds so there isn't quite as much moisture. I also use about one and one-half onions - may try two the next time. This is really easy if you use a Pillsbury unroll-it pie crust. I'm sure homemade pastry would be great, but I think the red box stuff is pretty decent.

Use Cornmeal crust in Epi recipe called Goat Cheese tart in cornmeal crust. Easier, more interesting. I added Herbs du Provence to crust

I have now made this recipe twice and loved it both times! The first time I made it, I had some phyllo available so I used that. The second time I tried it with a homemade pastry crust, which was better tasting, but the ease of the phyllo was certainly a plus. I also doubled the onions as suggested by many and used Spanish onions. A good, easy dish that many enjoyed!

Pretty good tart, easy to make. As suggested, I used two onions. Kept the rest the same. Would add some herbs next time.

Rating: 3
Really delicious! Changes: 2 onions, basil chiffonade over onion layer and summer tomatoes. Tastes very rich and sweet. Any suggestions on adding an ingredient or a spice that would slightly tone down the sweetness of the onion? I did use Spanish onions, not Vidalia which would have been sweeter.

Rating: 4
I read most of the reviews before plunging in and made a few changes as well. I used shortcrust pastry sheets. I also used 180g smooth Feta goat cheese as I couldnt get regular goat cheese and I doubled the onion as advised by many reviewers. I would not double the cheese recipe as I think you would ruin the delicate flavours. I served this with baked salmon and brocolli and in Australia this dish would feed about 6-8 people served this way as a side dish. Next time I will try using slow roasted tomatoes. I will definetly make this again as it was a refreshing change for a miserable winter night.

Rating: 3
So delicious, though I do admit to some changes.....doubled the onion as suggested and used Spanish onions....at the very end of cooking them I added the basil by chiffonading it into the onions.....and since I'm such a huge sun dried tomato fan, I halved, seeded and roasted the tomatoes with a little olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic first. Added another dimension of flavor.

I usually don't like real sweet carmelized onions, so I substituted leeks and it was very good, light, and delicious and simple too. My husband wants me to make again tomorrow for a party we're going to. Too bad you have to wait until nearly the end of summer to get really good ripe tasting tomatoes--a least here in MI.

I prepared everything ahead of time, including blind-baking the crust, then assembled and broiled at the last minute. Used lemon basil. Fresh, delicious and very easy.

This was very good. The pastry got very soggy though, as I let it sit a little while.I doubled the onion. The basil burned on me when I put the tart under the broiler, maybe next time I will "tuck" it inside so it is not exposed.

I've made this recipe several times and always gotten rave reviews. I make my own whole-wheat crust, which adds a nice bit of sweetness (and has the added benefit of making this very quick when I've frozen a batch in advance).

For the amount of labor involved (I just couldn't bring myself to use those packaged pie crust crappies.), this was disappointing. I'd rather use my quality tomatoes, onion and chevre for a simple salad or a bruschetta.

We really enjoyed this. I doubled the onion. I prefered it warm to cooled off b/c the crust got a bit soggy after letting it sit.

Very good. I used puff pastry sheets instead of pie dough, and used salt and pepper. Very yummy tomato flavor. Ofcourse, I haven't found anything I don't like if it has goat cheese in it.

I came across this recipe at a time I was (a) trying the low-carb approach and (b) awash in zuchinni. Instead of using pie dough, I sliced zuchinni thinly, parboiled it for a couple minutes so it pre-cooked, then laid it on the sides and bottom of a pie pan. Followed the rest of the recipe as written. Yummy with lower calories and fat than pastry. Even though I'm off lo-carb, I still make this with my zuchinni "crust."

I made this recently for my book club, and everyone enjoyed it. I less than 6 oz. of goat cheese because that's what I had, and it was fine. The onions are nice and mellow with the long cooking. Everyone commented on it, and someone asked for the recipe.

This is a lovely savory tart. Jeff, might I suggest therapy instead of cooking - the latter seems to bring up a lot of issues for you.

This tart is wonderfully delicious prepared as directed, although I have used herbed goat cheese on occasion with good results. It is a lovely addition to a Sunday brunch and I have received many requests for the recipe.

Rating: 2
If I had made this recipe as written, I think I would have rated it much higher. In reading some of the reviews, I was swayed to use more of everything. More cheese, more onions, more herbs, more this, more that. What I was left with was a dense, steroidal and garish creation instead of a subtle and delicate tart that would have been perfectly suited to a Sunday late-summer lunch. The sophisticated flavors of my heirloom tomatoes were lost amid a sea of cheese and onions. It seems that too many people these days ascribe to the more-is-more, extra value meal, cheese-in-the-crust gluttonous mentality that continues to pervade America. What gets lost is subtlety, nuance, self control and the simple appreciation of honest and natural products.

Rating: 4
I really loved this, but I admit to changing it some. I used my own pie crust made with bacon fat...maybe not ideal texture, but great taste. Then, since I couldn't find my usual brand of goat cheese, I decided to use Feta, and add chopped Kalamata olives and a can of mushed anchovies. I used 2 huge onions carmelized dark brown, and I used tomatoes grown in our backyard (not romas). I'd make this again tomorrow, if I had time. It was truly fantastic. I drained the tomatoes, and only had a (very) little water in my tart.

Yes, I would make this again and again! I made exactly as is in the recipe using Pillsbury dough which you unfold and put in tart pan. Defintely cover the tart edges with foil during the broiling so they don't burn. I also drained the sliced plum tomatoes about 5 minutes to take out some of their moisture before putting in tart. I threw in one heirloom tomato for a little added color. Uuuummmmm, good!

Rating: 1
Well ... at least it didn't TASTE bad. But when I spend an hour of hands on time (okay, okay, there was about five minutes to throw together a salad) I expect a recipe to be very good. Following other reviewers' recommendations, I used two red onions and cooked them for a full 40 minutes to extract their natural sweetness. And I used 6 oz goat cheese, 4 oz neufchatel and 4 oz Montery jack with a few fresh herbs thrown in ... thank heavens or I think this would have been dry and tasteless. After all the warnings to cover the crust edges during baking, they burned to a crisp while under the broiler. Frankly this had little hope ... roma tomatoes may be red in color but they have the texture and taste of cardboard. Halved grape tomatoes would be better ... if you insist on trying this. One good thing: I learned the efficacy of thinning a Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust. Once a bit thinner and trimmed, it wasn't half bad ... that from someone who's known for her pastry. If you're still reading ... move on to another recipe.

We love the typical Provencal kinds of tarts. This ones allows lots of variations but is sure good as it is. I used 2 huge onions (one vidalia) and found it to be enough. Didn't have enough chevre so I used Boursin as well. In total, almost 2 cups of cheese...and would do so again.

I have made this recipe a dozen times and everyone loves it. I would highly recommend it with beef but I have served it as a main dish for a quick dinner. Crumbled goat cheese works best.

Rating: 2
Hmmm... maybe my expectations were too high, but I found this just average. Did add another onion, as previous reviewers suggested, but still there were just enough caramelized onions to barely cover the bottom of the tart (I think Gourmet must have cheated on the photo)! I tossed in some toasted pine nuts for bulk, which helped, but not enough to encourage me to make this again.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. Made it for a dinner party not one speck left on the plate. I mixed the goat cheese with 8 oz of softened cream cheese. Also, next time I make it, I will double the onions. It was delicious!!!!

A new family favorite (with adjustments for some).. I did use 2 onions as suggested by other reviewers, and once tried it using one red and one yellow. I didn't try the crust recipe as I used one of my own and a prepared crust. One of my sons that doesn't care for goat cheese and couldn't be tricked, so I'll have to use an herb cheese when he's home!

I made this on the go last night with a crescent-roll crust (thanks to a previous reviewer) and my husband, who's used to Epicurious experiments by now, immediately said this should be a regular. Delicious and very pretty presentation. For the reviewer asking about goat cheese, by the way, I'm a fan of Silver Goat, which seems to please even the non-goat cheese lovers... and they have an herbed version, too, which is what I used on this with great results.

Rating: 3
Every time I make this tart everyone asks for the recipe! I have modified it slightly: I make my own pastry using 2 parts all-purpose flour to 1 part cake flour, a tip I learned from a Steve Raichlen cookbook; I use 2 onions; I use 8 oz goat cheese for a more substantial dish. I have made it 2 hours ahead of time, reheated it in the oven, then run it under the broiler, and it still comes out great.

This recipe did not live up to the expectations I had after reading the great reviews. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great either. For me the tastes didn't mesh well together. Maybe it's just my tastebuds.

To Boston 10/16 . . . pre-baking (blind baking) is important lest you end up with a gummy, pastey shell. You can do it in advance to save time, and of course a convection oven (I WISH I had one) will save a little time, too.

Rating: 0
Is it neccesary to prebake the pie shell? I have made a number of quiches and have just lined the tart or pie pan with the crust, filled and baked. I would like to try this recipe but was hoping to speed up the process. Thanks in advance.

This was very tasty, easy and visually pleasing. I will try the puff pastry next time, as the pie crust was too crusty to me and made it difficult to cut into wedges - the crust sort of fell apart. This mixture might even work in those ittle phyllo pastry cups. Definately a keeper!

This was awesome and so tasty. My husband and I just loved it. Very easy to make -- serve it with a salad and some red or white wine and your in business.

This was a beautiful appetizer. I used chevre, and caramalized the onions for much longer than the recipe stated. Also, I deglazed the onions with some white wine and reduced until the wine had evaporated before adding it to the tart. I will definitely be making this again!

I found this dish to be rather tasty. I used puff pastry rather than pie crust dough and I mixed some herbs into the goat cheese. Also, as I am not a fan of fresh tomatoes, I used sundried tomatoes for a very different effect. I used a vidalia and a red onion (as they were what I had on hand and I felt one onion would not be enough) and the effect was divine.

Minneapolis: have you tried Boursin? It's a soft, spreadable cheese that might be good in this recipe, but it will add an "herbed" flavor. Hope that helped and good luck.

I have a question I hope someone can help me with. I am not very fond of goat cheese as it tastes a bit like "basement" to me. Is there a type of goat cheese that is a bit more mellow and less musty smelling/ tasting? If not, Is there a good substitite for it? I find a ton of recipies that look great but I don't try them due to my aversion. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

I followed the advice of one reader and used crescent rolls as crust. Very good, easy, and kids liked. Great appetizer--can make ahead and stick in oven at last minute.

Fantastic Appetizer for a summer diner, and it could be a nice complement to winter festivites. One suggestion though, use red onions, the stronger taste stands up to the goat cheese. Also, carmelize more onions than necessary - 1 is not enough here.

Excellent recipe. I cheated and used the Pillsbury pie dough and it was fine. My only comment is that the recipe needs more onions as they cook down when they carmelize.I used 2 large onions and next time I will use another. I also added fresh basil to the layering of the quiche.

To make a mashed potato crust, take leftover mashed potatoes and heat them up so they are fluffy again. Pat into lightly greased pie pan and bake for ~ 15 minutes at ~ 350 degrees until the crust browns slightly (not too much because you are putting it back in the oven). Follow recipe as directed from there. I use this crust when I make quiches as well. Great taste with less fat.

I made this two nights ago and it was excellent. To the cook who noted that the goat cheese was overwhelming: I used a goat cheese that was blended with extra curds, so the pungent flavor was reduced (my husband does not like goat cheese either - but he loved this!) I also made my own pastry dough - it was an olive oil dough from "How To Bake" - it was a perfect match for this tart. I was extremely pleased with the results. If you have a green market near you, check it out for the best ingredients.

This was so delicious, my husband said he could eat one everyday! Ok, I cheated on this one too using Pilsbury Pie Crusts and a pie pan instead (since I've never made a tart before) but just make sure you keep the foil on the edges the whole time. But even with black edges, it disappeared in less then ten minutes!

Made this for a pot-luck at work and everyone was impressed...nobody believed it could be so easy! This will be a good stand-by dish for family and friend gatherings esp. since I have two young children and not much time for cooking things other than what they will eat (this is not a "kid dish").

Contrary to everyone else, neither my husband nor I cared for this. I made exactly as directed. The goat cheese seemed to overpower the dish...too much of it or something. It was a good french goat cheese, one I've used before so I know that wasn't the culprit. The pastry dough just kind of flaked off...kind of messy to eat. It did not seem light and summery to me; it was rather sickening. Just one (minority) opinion -- Bon Appetit!

Excellent! I also used the pillbury pie dough, made it very easy. I used a little more onions then directed knowing they cook down so much(2 medium). And it took more then 20 minutes to get them nice and brown. With tomatoes fresh from the garden, this will be a summertime favorite.

My husband and I both loved this so much. And if you buy Pillsbury prepared pie dough you don't even have to worry about rolling out the dough, just unfold it and put it in the pan. Also, I added a layer of prosciutto since this was our main dish and it was great. I'm sure I'll be making this one again.
