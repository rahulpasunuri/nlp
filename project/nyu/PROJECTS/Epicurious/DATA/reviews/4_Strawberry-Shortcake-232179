Best strawberry shortcake I have ever had.

This is a great little twist on the usual shipped cream (the sour cream). I always put my bowl and my beaters in the freezer for an hour before I make it. Much faster that way. Also, for a nice change I put in maple syrup instead of the sugar and vanilla.

I made this for my writing group to celebrate a members 95th birthday. Everyone liked it. I took someone's suggestion and added lemon zest from 1 whole lemon to the whipped cream, but I couldn't taste it. I would add more sugar to the cream next time. I felt it was a bit blah, but it held up very well. I had to take the dish to the library with me and was pleased at how well the cream kept its shape. I also used the Pillsbury Grand Homestyle Buttermilk Biscuits. I spread melted butter on top and sprinkled sugar over the butter. They came out really delicious and nobody guessed that they were not homemade. They were perfect as I was short on time. Good suggestion!

The buttermilk biscuit recipe is delicious. It's not my favorite to use as shortcake, though, which is why I only gave it 3 forks. But as a biscuit - fabulous! According to my son, the whipped cream recipe is "the best in the world."

This was my second strawberry shortcake I have ever had and it is amazing. The sause was great (because you can't go wrong with strawberries and sugar) and the biscuits were perfect. I cannot find one single flaw in this recipe.

The berry and whip cream suggestions are fine. I used creme fraiche, as I was out of sour cream. The accompanying shortcake recipe is just ok. Not at all memorable. I won't be making it (the shortcake) again.

I really enjoyed the flavour of this whipped cream. I should have whipped it a bit more as it did not hold its shpae after being out of the fridge for a few moments.

Delicious! The shortcake was buttery and just-right-crumbly. The strawberries were extra juicy due to sitting at room temperature while the sugar pulled out their amazing juices. And the best part of all was the sour cream added to the whipping cream. It gave it just the right tang and made everything taste fresh. The only thing I would add to this wonderful recipe is a mint spring or two for garnish.

The whipped cream/sour cream mixture was amazing. Will make it again.

This is so not gourmet, but because of time constraints I used Pilsbury Grands buttermilk biscuits hot out of the oven. Delicious! Love the contrast of the sweet and savory. Wasn't crazy about the whipped cream. I think it was the confectioners sugar. I thought it tasted like Cool Whip.

Kids and adults alike loved this. Perfect ending to a Spring meal. I made it with the Tea Scones recipe (from this site) instead of the buttermilk biscuits, baked in cake pan as another reviewer suggested. Sprinkle the top of the scone or biscuits with coarse sugar for extra sweetness and texture.

This was excellent. The biscuit recipe was very good. I did not mash the berries, as they were very ripe and "juiced" just by standing with a bit of sugar, no need to bruise. I would not make the biscuits ahead of time, as biscuits never taste as good the next day.

Super shortcake recipe! Here is a tip for sweeting the strawberries. Instead of adding sugar to the strawberries I always add a cup of my dad's homemade strawberry freezer jam and then let it sit on the counter for an hour. It sweetens and thickens the strawberries slightly and really gives you a huge strawberry flavor.

These were very good. My friend said that the biscuits are better than the ones his mom makes! Next time I would make the biscuits in advance to save some time on the day I'm serving it.

Yummy, almost exactly my grandmother's recipe. I don't mash the strawberries - I find just sitting a room temperature brings out the juices. Hint: roll out the biscuit dough thin, the double over. This will make biscuits easy to split in two. This is not Eton Mess, which has meringue (or maybe shortbread). Your shortcake should be a cute little tower, not a bowl full of, well, mess!

Delicious, and just right for a hot day. Just for clarification, Eaton Mess, in my experience, is a mixture of strawberries, sweetened cream and crumbled meringue (a real mess!) - lovely, but certainly not strawberry shortcake. :)

Enduring an early summer heatwave, this dessert was a perfectly delicious ending to a hot, hot day. The sweetened whipped cream balanced so nicely with the not too overly sweet biscuits and strawberries (only used a teas. of sugar to help them along). I wonder if the contributor has other thoughts from his dad and recipes from his mom to share? So great.

This is a traditional english dessert known as "Eaton mess"

This is an old recipe in my house. My Grandma made fresh biscuits only she served them cut in half with butter, then the strawberry and whip cream. I still serve it that way today...what a big hit...

A great recipe--the addition of sour cream (I used yogurt)adds a wonderful touch and cuts the richness (which is more than compensated for by the biscuits)!

Simple, easy, good. So many others commented on biscuits so I thought I would pass on another biscuit dessert - peel and slice ripe peaches, saute in a little butter, with salt and sugar added to taste. In the meantime, simmer some baker's sweet whipped cream in a saucepan with a stick of vanilla and a touch of sugar if addl sweetness is desired. Cut the biscuits in half, top with the warm peach mixture and pour a little of the warm cream over the top. The cream soaks into the biscuits and the whole thing is rich and delicious.

This is the BEST. The biscuts are the key. Wonderful

This was a really easy and homey version of strawberry shortcake. I sprinkled some sugar on top of the biscuits after I brushed them with milk, and that gave them a nice sheen. And I baked them the full 15 minutes or a bit longer just to give these a bit more texture. Add some lemon zest and lemon extract to the whipped cream. Lots of ways to vary this just slightly for little touches your guests will notice.

The classic. Biscuts are so much better than sponge cake. The perfect desert.
