I had this dish at Las Ventanas and made it on my fist wedding anniversary. Sublime! (both times!)

FABO! so simple and so flavorful. How can you go wrong with cream, cheese, bacon and eggs? I live in SoCal and I couldn't find queso chihuahua even at a Mexican market. I subbed Monterey Jack but would like to try it with the recommeded cheese next time - I'll keep looking.

an exceptional dish! i altered it by adding onions, garlic and shallots to the eggs and serving it with a dallop of fresh salsa before the cheese sauce. i couldn't find chihuahua cheese so subbed pepper jack.

This is a great Sunday morning breakfast. It really jazzes up boring old bacon and eggs. I only made 2 chiles, stuffed each chile with 2 eggs and 1/4 pound of bacon, and neither my husband nor I could finish it. This is definitely a keeper! I used Queso Cotija, and it turned out a little lumpy, but still delicious. This made WAY more cheese sauce than necessary, as I only put a couple Tablespoons of it over each chile (I cut the recipe in half)... but I'm sure I'll find another use for the leftovers.

this was good, but my cheese sauce was slightly chalky in texture (I used queso asadero) and the peppers were slightly too spicy, overwhelming the egg mixture. I prefer the SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH POBLANO CHILES AND CHEESE from this website for an easier and tastier alternative.

The dish is very good my Mexican Family and I love it. Also, I just wanted to say to the reviewers that thought that the cheese came from a dog is that Chihuahua is a region in Mexico not the dog.

It's sad to see that some people are so ignorant about international cuisine and foreign cheeses. The dish was excellent for a quick breaksfast or brunch...

Fun presentation, but it wasn't anything that great.

Being familiar with real mexican food and the enormous variety of cheeses to enjoy in mexican cuisine I went for it and very much enjoyed this dish. So did my friends at brunch. Great for brunch!!!!! Yes, I am doing it again.

Can't get the image out of my head. Had to laugh. Poor Chihuahuas. I didn't know that people milked them.

Great dish! It is a shame that most people won't attempt because they are unfamiliar with Mexican Cuisine and think Taco Bell is a great place to eat.
