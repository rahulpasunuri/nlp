I made these with a big pot of spaghetti for my daughter's soccer team before a big game - they devoured it!

I did my own variation: * 12 oz of HOT sausage * 1 cup of fresh breadcrumbs Made Mario Batalis basic tomato sauce. Made 13 "3oz" meatballs and fried them a bit in evoo and then cooked 'em for 22 minutes in the sauce on the stove top. Served over spaghetti. I liked the extra texture from the sausage A LOT.

Super tasty and easy to make. I made these with the Pasta Al Pomodoro http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Pasta-Al-Pomodoro-365186.

super easy and very tasty. I made one and half times the recipe but did not increase the number of eggs and it turned out great. so easy. enjoyed by the picky 6 year old too.

LOVE this. My new favorite meatball recipe. Easy prep and it really captures every flavor in the meat since you're not pouring off the fat. Eat them plain, on baguette, noodles, or next to spaghetti squash with garlic and parm. Enjoy!

I do this recipe with ground turkey and turkey sausage and it turns out great! My 10- & 4-yr-olds love it! Turkey is somehow 'wetter' than beef, so I add extra bread crumbs. It's still harder to work with, but turns out fine after cooking.

Easy and good--I'm saving this recipe, more for technique and percentages than for a plan to make it exactly as written. But the meat-egg-breadcrumb balance and the cooking-in-oven technique all worked perfectly for a wonderful texture. We made more sauce by our own recipe (in a slow cooker, simmering all day), and after following this recipe, dumped this sauce in with that one, along with the meatballs, to hold warm until we were ready to eat. Below, a reviewer describes meatballs essentially boiled in a sauce, and I find that texture unappealing (boiled meat--pah). This baked version is much easier than the browned stovetop method my mother taught me, and since the tough exterior the browning generates isn't the texture I'm after either, baking was just ideal. We varied the seasoning just slightly. But we'll absolutely make these again--they were no harder to make than would be the bag of frozen from the store, but much, much tastier.

My 4 forks are for taste and ease of preparation! I didn't have milk called for in other meatball recipes - came across this recipe and I'm amazed how easy it was! I didn't have dry Italian sausage and only had 1lb of 4% fat lean ground beef. I used Italian flavored panko for the breadcrumbs, 2 heaping teaspoon fulls of pre-minced bucket garlic from Costco, and grated Parmesan instead of Pecorino Romano because that's what I had on hand. Probably doubled salt and pepper in the mix, and sprinkled some onion powder I had in the cupboard. I mixed all ingredients except for beef first, to avoid over-working the meat and making it tough, worked in the meat, then made small (~1.5 inch) bite-sized meatballs with minimaal handling. I splashed a bit (half tablespoon) of olive oil into my meatball mixture, in case my beef was too lean - healthier than saturated animal fat I imagine. Browned meatballs first in 1 Tablespoon olive oil and butter mixture before adding jar of pasta sauce I had on hand. Simmered sauce while pasta was cooking. So easy, little thought required, and earned compliments from my very picky boyfriend - comfort food on the table in 1/2 hour!!!

How easy was this? made it with the egg plant lasagna and baked in same oven. Everyone loved them, Yum!

great for kids, and adults, too, though some adults might want more flavor. i made about 18 smaller balls instead of 12 and used the whole can (28 oz) of crushed tomatoes (i used fire roasted), and this was better for the kids than the larger balls.

These are easy to make and have been a huge hit with many people. I've made them with both beef/pork sausage and turkey/chicken sausage and both work well. I add oregano & red pepper flakes to the sauce. These are the real deal for fast, no-hassle meatballs.

I am sorry about giving the 2 forks but my heart goes to the soft yet firm meatballs. Each pasta shape has a different type of sauce. A good hearty sauce is needed for meatballs. I differ with the meatballs by, just after making the sauce in a large pot on the stove top,(or you can use your slow cooker), I add the uncooked meatballs. Simmer for 6 to 8 hours with 6 being the minimum. Do not open lid. After simmering for that length of time, lift lid and scrape off oil on the surface of the sauce. The meatballs are soft melt in your mouth and the sauce has a smooth wonderful taste. You can add par cooked sausage or chicken thighs,in the beginning along with the meatballs for a more filling meal.

"Meatloaf mix," often on sale, works well too. My family requests these simple and tasty meatballs often, possibly because I don't get the frazzles from making it.

Really easy and very good, if you don't have tomatoes in heavy puree, just use a couple of teaspoons of tomato puree.

punched up sauce by sauteeing half an onion, cutting up a tomato, and adding Italian seasoning to can of crushed tomato. Go ahead and use whole large can of crushed tomato BUT no need to add the water as they suggest. Also added chopped fresh parsley to meatballs and sauce. Cooked an extra nearly 10 minutes. Wow! Turned out very well, with changes.

These were fantastic. I tried the recipe because it looked so easy, but the flavor is wonderful. I may stop making meatballs any other way.

I thought these were amazing! I pretty much followed the recipe, but used an entire 28oz can of crushed tomatoes with a little extra water. I don't think 1/3 cup of breadcrumbs was too much either; they came out fabulous and the sausage (I used Hot Italian) gave the meatballs and the sauce a kick! I will probably make this version every time I make meatballs from now on!

A great nite for this recipe as it is getting a little chilly here! Loved it but maybe used a little too much bread crumbs as the meatballs flattened s they cooked. A simple and delightful recipe to make.

Flavorful and EASY! Baking meatballs in oven is so much easier than top of the stove. I subbed 1/3 of lb of ground pork for the sausage and the meatballs were still savory and interesting. Made just enough meatballs to fit into my glass baking dish.

Excellent! Great meatballs, I make my own marinara and never dump a can of tomatoes in with the meatballs.

Rating: 3
True, these are just basic meatballs with a very basic tomato sauce, but I loved them, and so did my dinner guests. Loved the ease, the texture and the flavor. If I just need a basic meatball, I will probably always make this recipe -- perhaps subsituting a marinara or something else for the sauce.

First time making meatballs - such an easy recipe. I really thought the sauce was going to be bland, but it was very flavorful. Made few changes - used spicy turkey sausage for a little kick. Used dry italian bread crumbs and added a little oregano as well. Doubled the garlic and sprinkled a little more parm cheese on the meatballs and sauce before cooking. I doubled the recipe and got about 36 meatballs. I really like that you don't have to fry them first. Hope they freeze well! This recipe is a keeper.

These were tasty (I added some chopped onion), but I prefer a heartier less crumbly meatball. Too many breadcrumbs.

We have made this several times, first exactly as recipe calls for, and then tried with the following minor alterations, which we think makes the dish better: replaced bread crumbs with saltines, added some parsley to meatball mixture, lightly saute the garlic cloves while unpeeled to reduce the strong flavor (and we do love garlic!), also added a touch of cayenne pepper, yum! We love the ease of this recipe, and the fact that the whole family will eat it!

I have made these meatballs twice. The first time they lacked flavor, and so the next time I used spicy sausage, but again, they were bland! They were not horrble--there was just nothing exciting about these meatballs.

I didn't start a letter home but these were pretty good. I'd say they were best in a meatball sub with some provalone.

Terrific...and easy! For the sauce, I used crushed fire roasted tomatoes by Muir Glen and added fresh basil. Will make again!

This was delicious! And SO easy! I did bake a bit longer than recommended. Meatballs are huge and there is enough for 6 servings

Good and easy too. I'll add a bit of crushed red pepper next time for some kick, real tomato sauce instead of crushed tomatoes for some spice, and more cheese and bread crumbs to the meat. These were very dense and meaty. But everyone was happy and they're worth making again.

fab-u-lous and easy too! served three dozen at a dinner party. Used a combination of diced toms and jarred pasta sauce. I also skimmed the sauce after baking to remove the excess fat (from the 85/15 groud beef)I reccomend having plenty of bread on hand to sop uo the tasty sauce.

These are delicious and easy to make. I served them over brown rice and my family loved them. Would definitely make again.
