Wow- this was delicious! I substituted one sweet potato for one of the russet potatoes, and didn't use any dill. Made it for Rosh Hashannah, for a group of mostly gentiles, everyone loved it. It definitely is not enough for 12-15 people though. I'd say it's perfect for 8-10.

I was charged with making the potato kugel for passover this year, and was looking for something more flavorful that the stuff that usually comes to the seder table. This was wonderful! I substituted margarine for the butter, and left out the sour cream (as dinner was brisket) but it was still wonderful.

I made this tonight with a tsimmes dish from this site, halving the recipe for my family. It was my first attempt at a kugel. I was not exactly sure how it was supposed to come out, but based on the ingredients, I expected it to be crispier than it was. It was kind of gluey in texture and I thought the dill was overwhelming. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if the results were proper, but don't think I would make this recipe again.

I have not made this recipe yet, but can 1 1/2 pound of potatoes really serve 12 -15 people?

Took this to a seder last year and was a huge hit - so they asked me to bring it again this year - delicious once again. Changes I made: use half the amount of rosemary, use 1 tsp. dried marjoram instead of trying to find fresh, use 6 Tblsp. fresh dill instead of dried. Add 1 tsp. kosher salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper. Also needed to bake 1 hour instead of 50 mins.

Good texture, but did't like the milky-taste...too overpowering. The herbs were good, and the presentation nice, but I would probably not put the sour cream and try to work out a new recipe based on this one.

Not bad for Passover. I even used dried herbs, not fresh.

Delicious! I used less rosemary thank called for and used flour instead of matzo meal and it was perfect!

I feel this dish has potential but has way too much dill. I was hoping for something I could use as a side dish for my child. I would tone way way down on the spices. The texture was nice though and it reheats very nicely.

This is a great side dish for any brunch and easy to make. I cut back a bit on the herbs, thinking it would be overly seasoned (and I like highly seasoned food). But when I make this again, I would use all of the quantity in the recipe.

I GAVE THIS RECIPE 4 FORKS BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT THAT MANY KUGEL RECIPES MY FAMILY REALLY LIKE AND THIS ONE THEY ALL RAVED ABOUT. WHEN WE GET TOGETHER THERE ARE ANYWHERE FROM 20 TO 25 PEOPLE AND I DID NOT GET ONE NEGATIVE REMARK. ONE MUST REMEMBER THAT THIS CAN ONLY BE SERVED WITH A DAIRY MEAL BECAUSE OF THE SOUR CREAM. I AM GOING TO LEAVE THE SOUR CREAM OUT THIS YEAR AND HOPE IT STILL IS GOOD
