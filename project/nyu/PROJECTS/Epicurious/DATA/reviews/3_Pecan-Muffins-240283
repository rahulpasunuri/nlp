These were delicious. Made with good walnut oil and walnuts, very sophisticated in taste. Yes, they will be good with pumpkin soup. Can hardly wait to pair the two this fall.

Very very good - I didn't have any nut oil so I just used sunflower oil, they still tasted great. I used golden unrefined sugar so it gave the muffins a bit of a crunch. Yummy. They have a lovely dense texture.

These were delicious! I used walnut oil and walnuts, then discovered I was massively short on walnuts, so made up the nut amount with 1/2 cup chopped almonds. I was also short on milk and made that up with a tiny bit of cream. I was thinking that to the extent almonds are a bit less oily than walnuts would make the cream element OK. I found this recipe incredibly easy as well; I had these in the oven in minutes. Finally, I only have a 6-cup muffin tin which I filled to the top, but these rose to 6 generous muffins rather than spreading everywhere and making a mess. All of this means I consider this to be a fool-proof recipe that I will enjoy making again!

Had a hard time finding either walnut or pecan oil. Finally found walnut oil, which I used with chopped pecans. Wonderful recipe; served these with homemade pumpkin soup, and the sweet muffins were a great combination with the savory soup.

i made these with walnut oil and walnuts instead of the pecans. liked the idea of using nutty oil in baking. didn't find the smell of walnut oil that appetising when smelled it from the bottle but it was quite wonderful in the finished product. my friends said they loved these. we ate them au naturel, but i think they'd be even better/different if paired with frosting involving, say, cream cheese and maple syrup. the texture was nice. will definitely make again but perhaps with frosting.
