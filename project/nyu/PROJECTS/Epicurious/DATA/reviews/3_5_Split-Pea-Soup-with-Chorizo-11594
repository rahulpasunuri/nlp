I listened to the other reviewers and used 1 lb of chorizo and 1/2 pound of split peas. I put in 4 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water. I should have used less water because it was a little too watery and not thick like you expect of split pea. I found the 1/2 teaspoon of thyme to add a strange flavor in combinations with the other ingredients so I added a chopped fresh tomato at the very end and it cut down the thyme taste which was a big improvement.

I made this with yellow split peas and 1/4 lb of really bold cured chorizo because that's what I had. It was really delicious. I sauteed the chorizo cut in little cubes because it's easier in a little olive oil and saved all of the fat to saute the onion, etc. I pureed the cooked chorizo in the mini processor so it would be shredded and blend well in every bite of the soup. The color was great with the yellow peas and orange carrots too. YUM will be making this again.

Very tasty soup. Used 11 oz pack of mild chorizo and that was enough to get a piece in every spoon full. Great on a cool fall day. Easy to make too.

This was fast, easy and good. I couldn't find cured chorizo so used the regular. I didn't find it overly spicy but that may have been the sausage. I will make this again.

I've made this soup multiple times over the years and it's a standard of mine. Finding cured chorizo is key: I can't imagine making it with the chorizo that comes all mushy in the tubes. It makes a lot of soup: I've frozen portions of it and reheated it with no bad side effects. A delicious take on a basic soup!

I read a lot of the reviews and saw that everyone recommended cutting back on the liquid because the soup was not thick enough. I added the 4 cups of broth but only 3 cups of water and the soup was far too thick - it was more like green cement than soup. It was very tasty but the next time I make it I will add more water, not less.

I made this soup last night with excellent results. The chorizo brings this classic soup to the optimum level of spiciness. I did use 1 lb rather than the 1 1/2 lbs used in the recipe. Although if you have a daring pallette and enjoy spicier foods, doing the 1 1/2 lbs may be the answer. Another deviation from the recipe, I doubled the amount of split peas to 2 lbs. This allowed me to use all of the 4 cups of water instead of cutting back on it as some previous reviewers did. Some other changes... -2 onions -5 ribs of celery (chopped in food chopper) -5 smaller carrots -2 fresh bay leafs -6 cloves of garlic -fresh thyme -5 smaller potatoes chopped -The recipe never noted when to return the chorizo to the mix... I returned them with the carrots. This is a fantastic recipe that leaves a lot of room to play around with.

Very tasty and simple to prepare. I, too, decreased liquid and wish I had decreased chorizo a bit as others recommended. A chopped potato was a great addition.

Fantastic soup! As always, I read the reviews and put in a little less liquid which worked beautifully. I didn't have to blend the soup at all. Most importantly, I used spicy jalepeno precooked chicken sausage, diced, and cooked in a tiny bit of butter. Agreed with other reviewers, one pound was plenty. I removed half of the sausage for the soup stage and left the other half in for flavoring the vegggies. The whole family loved it, especially the sausage bits. YUM.

Not being able to find cured chorizo, I used fresh. Removed meat from casings and browned. 1 1/2 lbs is too much, but will make again this way using 1 lb instead. I also left the sausage in the soup and the peas melded to a creamy consistency without pureeing. My hubby said it's the best split pea soup he has had and as for me I very much enjoyed this soup (peas are not my favorite).

I had never had split pea soup before, but since I am pregnant, I am trying to eat more of the dry legumes, and this seemed to be the soup with the best reviews. However, when I sent my husband to the store to get the sausage, they didn't have chorizo or andouille, so he just got a regular smoked kielbasa. As some of the reviewers suggested, I let the kielbasa remain in the pot for the entire cooking time. Besides this, I only made two more changes. Instead of adding 3 carrots, I added 2 carrots and one potato. And since I hate chunks of boiled carrot, I shredded them instead, which gave a nice sweetness to the soup to counteract the saltiness of the sausage and the broth. All in all, the dish was excellent. Not just good for you, but plain delicious. P.S. I don't know why ppl would even have to blend it, since after cooking it for the recommended time, the peas broke apart by themselves into a nice puree...

This was delish. The recipe was easy to make. Although the direction left out when to add the chorizo to the soup. I read some reviews and decided to add a third of the chorizo with the carrots. Then after the soup was cooked I used a hand held blender to blend the soup, just a bit. I did leave half of the texture. Then I added the remaining chorizo. The taste was so very flavorful. I definitely recommend this recipe to everyone.

Excellent flavor, but didn't get as thick as I expected. Will definitely make again, but probably cut down on the liquid or add more peas.

This was a delicious and easy one pot meal. I substituted one carrot with one potatoe and used andouille sausage instead of Chorizo. Diced the sausage more finely than the recipe calls for and added it back into the pot after pureeing the soup with a hand blender. You'd never miss cream - the soup was so thick. It's even better the next day, but be sure not to over salt as the salt from the sausage will intensify in the soup overnight and I did need to thin leftovers with a little liquid.

YUM!! I added potatoes with the carrots and used my hand blender to make the soup thicker. Fantastic.

I've made this twice, now -- once as written, and a second time using a concentrated ham base and water rather than chicken broth. I loved both versions. I'm on a low carb regimen so I left out the carrots, but am certain it is even better with. I found that I can use andouille sausage and even halve the quantity, and it has plenty of meat and zingy heat. Like the last reviewer, I too left the sausage in the pot for the entire cooking time. With andouille, there was no excess fat to drain, and the heat of the sausage really permeated the soup with the extra cooking time. Yum!

I ditto all the great comments on this recipe - it is a favorite of mine, and the easiest split pea soup recipe I've ever seen. My one comment to pass along - I just leave the sausage in the pot after browning and add the onions, etc. to it rather than removing it and adding it near the end of cooking. It gives the onions and celery a richer smokier taste and infuses itself into the soup during cooking. Something you might want to try sometime. By the way, my sausage never gives off much fat - not even a tablespoon so there isn't a problem with excessive fat. Yum! I love this soup!

This recipe is very easy to make. I followed the listed ingredients exactly and it turned out great. I had many compliments on it from my friends. I returned the chorizo to the soup when I added the carrots. As usual, I added a little ground red pepper to spice it up a bit.

I took another reviewers suggestion and substituted andouille sausage because I couldn't find smoked Chorizo; it turned out fantastic. I added extra peas and blended a few cups worth (without the sausage)because we like our soup thick. Also I served it with a few drops of balsamic vinegar in each bowl. It added just the right amount of zing!

First time ever making split pea soup and I was quite impressed. I used regular cooking chorizo sausage so after I fried it for a bit I cut it up into very small pieces and really fried it. I added it back in with the carrots. I had no problems with the consistancy. Quite filling, will make it again.

My hubby is no split pea fan, but he LOVED this recipe! Since it didn't say when to add the sausage back in, I did so with the carrots and it turned out fine. Served it with a touch of parmesan. Most definitely a keeper!

This was a very nice variation on the split pea theme. My teenager loves anything with split peas in it. For those of you who haven't been exposed to chorizo before..CURED chorizo is hard and fairly dry, a little softer than dry salami. So you can feel it in the market to tell what kind to get. It doesn't crumble when cooked unless you really try hard. It may be hard to find in the States. I would substitute Andouille for it easily rather than use the soft, crumbly variety of chorizo.

Good recipe, but after making it, I'd offer a few suggestions: 1. Use 1/4 to 1/3 more peas than listed if you want a really thick (French Canadian style) soup 2. If you like smooth, process the soup WITHOUT the chorizo, after simmering the carrots, then return to the pot with the chorizo, heat and serve. 3. Even better if made a day ahead!

A great winter soup and sooo easy! I've added potatoes with the carrots and cut them the same size and it was fabulous.

WOW! The chorizo I bought looked like it was in links and turned out to be loose, but I went ahead and used it that way, so it kind of looked like ground beef in the soup. The soup was too spicy for the kids to eat, but Grandpa Dan loved it (and if HE says it's good...). I have never liked split-pea soup, but I tried this one because of the chorizo. I was surprised at how good it was, and I can't wait to make this one for a large group. Definately a keeper-recipe.

The recipe does not specify when to return the sausage to the soup!!!!!!!

I used hot Italian sausage instead of the Chorizo and turned out wonderful. The spice added a little zing to just the regular pea soup.
