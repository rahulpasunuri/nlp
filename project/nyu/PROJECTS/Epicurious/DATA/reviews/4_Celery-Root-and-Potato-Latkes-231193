Made these for a Seder dinner last year and am doing it again this year. Fabulous flavor. I make them in mini form so they're more two-bite sized as an appetizer.

Super delish. The only change I would make would be to increase the salt to 1 1/2 tsp. (after squeezing the potato-onion mixture, as the recipe says).

So good! Even my very particular French boyfriend loved them. I used 2 potatoes, 1/2 onion, 1/4 of a giant celery root, and reduced the celery seeds somewhat. I might use a little more celery root next time but they were wonderful. You don't need that much oil--I just used enough to fill the pan about 1/4". I grated everything in the food processor all together then shoved in the chopping blade and gave it a few whirls to release some more starch.

Unbelievably delicious! My husband made these for our Holiday party & they were a hit! The problem was not eating them up before the guests arrived. Have made these several times since, not just for the holidays. Bravo!!

Very simple and tastey especially if you have a cuisinart. Do drain the water out of the potato onion mixture as mine were a bit wet inside but still delicious. Next time I will be sure to drain...

Superb! I used one large russet potato, one yellow onion and 1/2 celery root for 2 which made 10 latkes. Crispy, golden and wonderful flavor. Big hit with my husband and later with my family!
