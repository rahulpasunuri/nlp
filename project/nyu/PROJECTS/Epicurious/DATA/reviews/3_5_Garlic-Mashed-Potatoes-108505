The roasted garlic really infused nicely into the potatoes!

these potatoes, while decent, just don't have enough of the garlic flavor i crave--and i use the whole head. i find myself adding lots of salt and pepper, and i wouldn't use cream, but milk (always warm it before hand). it is much simpler to sautee a few mashed cloves in butter before mashing, and add the entire mixture to the potatoes. much simpler, and better beyond compare.

I just roasted the garlic until it was mush and added it to regular mashed potatoes. I love garlic so I used extra as well... I thought they were really good. I also used skim milk instead of the cream.

Another REALLY lazy way to make decent garlic mashed potatoes is to throw as many peeled cloves as you want into water to boil with the potatoes; drain and mash together with the usual butter and hot cream. easy and pretty good; not roasted garlic but mild, good flavor.

I thought the mashed potatoes turned out to be just okay. I used extra garlic like other suggested, however, still a little bland. I felt I had to use too much cream to soften it. Perhaps next time I should add whole milk instead.

I adapted this recipe for 6. I used the entire head of garlic in the recipe - and no one could taste it!

I really liked this recipe, given you can prepare it with almost anything. It is quick and easy, no extras...but very good!!! I would make the recipe larger for potato lovers like me :)

Had a bad day? Make these potatoes and you'll forget all about it. I added a little parsley since I had it and hand, which added nice color. Cover the roasted garlic with a bit of olive oil for longer keeping. You also get the bonus of flavored oil that way. This recipe is absolutely fabulous comfort food.

These were the best mashed potatoes ever! I could never eat mashed potatoes any other way again.
