I made this without the diced cooked chicken or the rice and I loved it! Complex and nicely spicy.

This is delicious! Anyone who finds this bland is using poor quality spices. This is the first time I have made Mulligatawny soup without an apple and I didn't miss it at all. I didn't bother to blend the soup as it was thick enough on it's own. I loved the lentils! It's a keeper for me.

So tasty especially after a few additions of carrots, celery and apple to the onion. The apple particularly added a nice touch. I also halved the coconut milk.

I chose to go with the vegetarian version from a previous reviewer...here's what I did: -added celery, carrots, and green bell pepper when cooking veggies (all chopped fine in food processor with onion and garlic) -I didn't have garam masala or tumeric so I used one jar of Masala Simmer Sauce from Trader Joe's and put that in with the veggies after they were cooked, added a little curry powder with spices -used 2 boxes of vegetable broth from Trader Joes's - low sodium -I used one can light coconut milk from Trader Joe's -didn't puree in food processor - too much work! -I cooked 2 cups of brown long grain rice and just put that in with the soup Great texture and taste! Great for a snowed in night in ATL!

This soup is awesome!!! I've made it several times - my husband and I just love it. We used about 4 shredded chicken breasts and brown rice to make it a bit heartier. This recipe is a staple in my repertoire. As an aside - the Spice House has the best quality spices.

Great soup. It made a lot, so I took the leftovers to work and heated it in a crockpot to share. It was a hit. Made it exactly as directed at first, then with the leftovers I added sauteed bell pepper, carrots, and celery. Even my 2 and 5 year olds loved it.

For a healthier and vegetarian twist: 1. Omit the chicken and coconut milk. 2. Add 6 medium-sized carrots, chopped. 3. Add 6 celery stocks, chopped. 4. Add the carrots well before the celery, and cook until both are lightly tender. Then blender leaving some texture to your preference.

This one knocked outta da park! It was my first time cooking with garam masala, so, I would think it was a natural 'four forker' because of that. What a wonderful spice it is--earthy, but florid in aroma at the same time. Sweet but pungent and savory to taste. I have wanted to try my hand at Mulligatawny soup for some time now since having it in a restaurant. It was absolutely delicious. We halved the cayenne pepper to 1/4 t. and added a handful of some 'baby like' carrots we had in the house after mincing them in a food processor. Speaking of which, I would recommend a food processor over a blender for pureeing. I think you can get by with just the 1/4 t. cayenne unless you really are pursuing heat, but I think that would detract from the other flavors in this wonderful soup. Loved it!

This was super easy and good, but didn't really remind me of a true mulligatawny. It was more a a light lentil stew with good flavors. I'll make it again, but will definitely double the spice and add carrots.

Rating: 4
Rounded the tablespoons/teaspoons on the spices, since we like heat. Browned the chicken breasts in olive oil with a little garlic and a 1/4t dusting of garam masala. Did not puree soup, based on recommendations. Served over basmati brown rice. Lovely recipe: this one's going in the regular rotation.

Rating: 4
Very hearty, tasty, warming soup. Great for cold winter days. I agree with others that no further pureeing is needed as Red Lentils are very tender. Next time, I will use no or less cayenne as it is a tad too hot for me. I like spicy, but not overpowering. Added a bit of Chinese Five Spice too.

Used exact spices except cayenne (add hot chili flakes to compensate); didn't blend at all, quite mushy as is; added 2 large carrots, peeled and thinly sliced, at the start with the onions; and I didn't put any chicken in, as we had another protein dish. It would be a MEAL with the chicken, without it, over rice, it's a very filling soup and you only need protein or a salad to accompany it. Good flavour. I wouldn't blend it unless you're a huge "cream of" soup fan, though, the lentils are quite tender without that.

I wrote something about this when I first made it, several years ago; but now I live with a Brazilian who likes fire in his bowl, so I add at least one red Thai chili or a fresh jalapeno to the onions and garlic when I am cooking the vegetables. I also use Garam Marsala paste. It is much more flavorful than the powder, and about three tablespoons of it. I always use Tilda basmati with it. The chicken stir-fried with a little chili oil and regular oil with salt and pepper tenderizes the chicken and just adds depth to the soup, if it is a main course. I puree it with an immersion wand, but only slightly. I also use some coriander leaves with the lemon slice on top. It is a beautiful presentation. I just served this as a first course of a dinner for 12 and they all wanted the recipe.

I made this, using some of the suggestions on here - sauteed carrots and celery with the onions, and added ginger with the garlic. Used lite coconut milk which was good, but not as "coconut-y" as other mulligatawny I've had. Worth it to save the calories though! I also used much less oil, maybe 2 T, and added a lot more spice than called for - extra Garam Masala, added cinnamon, which was key, a bit of cayenne hot sauce, lots of salt, and lots of lemon. Omitted the chicken, served it over brown rice I cooked with the leftover coconut milk (and to which I added some frozen peas at the end) and it is a delicious healthy lunch that makes enough for at least a week! At the end, it was 4 forks, but without the changes I made, would have been more of a 3 fork!

Never had real mulligatawny soup before, so I don't know what to compare it to. But, it was easy to make and rather tasty. Perfect for when we have a hankering for Indian spices but don't feel like getting take out. I'd probably leave out the coconut milk or use lite next time; the little bit of added richness was nice, but a little calorically extravagant.

Rating: 4
This stuff is addictive. Don't know if my spices were old, I bought them the day I made this, but had to add enough salt to lift out the flavor of them. Is this not a real Mulligatawny?

Yum! Don't puree it, and add carrots and celery, and some fried tofu if you're a vegetarian.

This was delicious! I made it to the recipe except substituted lite coconut milk and lime instead of lemon, and added a few pinches of salt- can't get enough of this.

The best part of Mulligatawny soup is the apple. Where is it? Also missing are the carrots and celery.

Rating: 4
This was very flavorful! I was surprised because it really did not take that long. It is important to brown the onions well, and cook the spices before adding the liquid - otherwise, they will taste gritty. I have made this without the coconut milk and the chicken and it is still good. This is definitely going into my collection.

This was an excellent soup! I made this for a cooking night with friends when the theme was "Indian"; however this is not a mulligatawny soup. This is a soup version of "dahl" which is a very traditional Indian lentil side dish served over rice. Mulligatawny is a vegetable soup. I happen to have wanted to make a lentil soup - so this was perfect for me! Very tasty!

This was a really fantastic soup! My family couldn't get enough of it. I added some chopped carrots and celery, but used the same amount of oil listed. Also I used light coconut milk instead of regular. Different than the first time I had mulligatawny, but still very excellent. I personally would like more of a kick, but this is definitely flavorful the way it is.

Rating: 4
Recipe calls for far too much oil. I used 2 T, that was more than enough. Otherwise, the recipe is delightful. I've never been able to detect coconut milk in mulligatawny before and didn't even know it was an ingredient. I think I will use 1/2 cup of LIGHT coconut milk next time instead to save some calories. The recipe also turns out well with vegetable broth, for all the vegetarians out there.

I made this for a monthly soup night we host at our home. It was the first time we ran out of soup, as people went back for seconds and thirds. I didn't puree the soup, but made pretty much to the recipe, except I went lighter on the oil.

Well I followed the recipe to the "T" and.... Bloody excellent! I don't know how some people claim the taste is bland, it is FULL of flavours! Here is my recommendation: Use Premium grade Coconut milk (you can drink the leftovers from the can :) Also, use good quality Chicken Stock and quality spices. I also used an immersion blender (so easy). Great Winter Meal, full of flavour and homey comfort.

This is a great winter recipe--just go with what's here and add or subtract what you don't like. I didn't puree it and I don't recommend doing so. I also added chopped celery and chopped carrots--it added a lot. I also used cream instead of coconut milk and next time, I'll try the coconut milk. An all-round keeper!

I guess I should speak up here, say that this is one of my fav recipes, and I make it time and time again. It's simple, the combo of lemon and chicken stock is appealing.

One fork is unbelievably generous for this disaster. First of all, I should have passed when I saw the inclusion of coconut milk. No Mulligatawny that I have ever had included coconut milk. The colour of this stuff was somewhere between bile green and molten pigeon poop. The garam masala was harsh and gritty and it had none of the subletly of a true Mullagatawny creation. I have been cooking Indian food for decades and this was the all time low. I would think this would be consumed by desparate soldiers somewhere in a trench no where near India.

Rating: 1
too much garam masala.. the coconut milk was an odd addition and because of the over use of the garam masala, the colour of the soup was a very unappetizing browny green. Not like the mulligatawny's I've had in my local favorite indian restaurants.

I never had or made Mulligatawny Soup, so I don't have a comparison to base my review of this particular recipe. My brother-in-law told me about this recipe, so I decided to give it a try. It was rich, spicy and delicious. I can't imagine anyone finding this bland. Maybe their spices were old? I used light coconut milk, chicken thighs and brown rice. Absolutely fantastic soup!

I just made this as quick solution to weekday dinners as I work late and do not have time to cook during the week days. It is delicious and satisfying. I bought my spices at the DeKalb Farmers Market in Atlanta and in a local Indian market down the street...maybe this is the trick?! It was/is awesome...and quick. It will be a regular esp during colder weather...

Don't waste your time! Complete disappointment! Not really even worth reviewing except to say don't bother. Bland, boring, lack luster, missing veggies, missing dimension, need I continue ...it's what I imagine fancy prison "mush" might taste like. If I could give it "negative forks" I would.

VERY disapointing. It was bland....needed more chicken and definitely vegetables. Will not make again.

I agree this was rather plain so my solution was to add lots of chopped fresh cilantro at serving time. This kicked up the color and flavor.

Very good. I used green lentils as the store was out of red. Is there a flavor difference? My soup came out plenty rich, thick, and spicy! I agree that chicken is not necessary. I made "faux naan" by putting pita bread topped with chopped garlic and olive oil under the broiler for a few minutes.

My husband and I were disappointed in this soup. It was a little plain and insipid, and that was really not what we expected. We really missed the vegetables that are almost completely missing from this recipe. The next time I make Muligatawny Soup, I think I will make a vegetable puree base and I may finish it with Almond milk (the suggestion of a friend). I will say that after the soup sat in the fridge for a day, it gained a lot in flavor.

My husband and I loved this. We'd never had Mulligatawny before. My 3 1/2 year old daughter found it too spicy, so I might cut back on the cayenne next time... at least until her taste buds mature.

Agree that good spices make all the difference - and disagree with the Cook from OR - diced apples are a quaint Anglo-Indian addition to this soup, which is of South Indian origin,

As with all Indian cooking, you will find a HUGE difference depending on the quality of your spices. Invest in some good ones for this recipe and it will not lack flavor.
