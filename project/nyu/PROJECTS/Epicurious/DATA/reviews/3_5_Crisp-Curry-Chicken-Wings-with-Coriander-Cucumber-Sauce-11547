Thought I had Major Grey's chutney, did not so I subsituted Greaves Peach Chutney, otherwise everything the same. The were solidly good, and reheat well. Everyone that came into my office area when I was heating them up at work commented on how good they smell and some asked for the recipe!

Used Jamaican Curry instead. They were a huge hit.

I made this recipe after I read the review from Baba of the Us Territories. It was so funny, that I had to try it. They were great, but not as funny as his review

I seem to be the lone ranger in these reviews but I didn't like it at all. My husband is Indian, so I'm used to the flavors, but this was too sweet and strong. I didn't use chicken wings - maybe that was the problem. One reviewer suggested putting it on regular chicken breasts which I did- obviously I did something wrong though.

Always read the directions through once before starting...even though I mixed all the ingredients together and skipped the glazing step they still turned out great. I would definitely call this a foolproof recipe, easy too. I double the recipe for fifteen people and only had four wings left over!

I have fixed this 4 times. It is so very good and very quick and easy. I have used the Major Gray Chutney, but am not sure it is essential ingredient. I did add lots of garlic and plenty of cayenne.

Good food, but my cousin Adji died suddenly during the supper. I believe that it was his gout and a combination of small shoes. Pushbawa, his widow, insisted that it was that the coriander was not cut in small enough pieces. To avaoid family quarelling, we have chosen to never make the dish again. In turn, Pushbawa will agree to remain in black for 12 years in honor of my cousin. Win/win

Excellent recipe! I have received RAVE reviews every time I have made this. It works really well with any skinless/boneless chicken and then slap it on the BBQ...never fails to impress.

These were great. I put all the chutney in the marinade, by mistake, but it didn't hurt the recipe. Served them during a card game, which was a bit messy, but didn't seem to slow anyone down!

I think I mixed the right amounts for the marinade, but when I did, it was like a very thick paste! So I added a bit of white wine vinegar and plain yogurt. Turned out very tasty!

The only thing I regret about this recipe is that I didn't find it sooner! I, also, doubled the recipe with the same disappearing-act result (the sauce didn't need to be doubled, however). I was a little worried about how this raita-type yogurt sauce would do, but it was a perfect accompaniment to the spicy wings and benefitted by a few hours in the frig to blend flavors.

It's a great thing to bring to a pot luck party because they re-heat well. I made double the amount of wings and they stil disappeared fast.

YUMMY! I followed one reviewer's advice and added a bit of honey to the glaze. Also, I left the wing tips on because I like them and turned to wings to brown both sides. Open your doors and windows....this set off my smoke alarm big time :)

I didn't add a thing to the recipe and thought it was great. The smooth Indian flavours came through. Everyone asked me for the recipe, which is always a great sign!

Excellent! I added a bunch of garlic, balsamic vinegar, and tons of Worcestershire sauce to the marinade; I let the wings marinate for about three days. To the glaze, I added (again) Worcestershire sauce, honey, garlic, and some olive oil. Instead of the given dip I mixed together some yogurt, sour cream, ranch dressing, ground coriander, cumin seed, and freshly grated parmesan cheese...mmm, good!

This is really a great recipe. I am making it for the second time tonight.
