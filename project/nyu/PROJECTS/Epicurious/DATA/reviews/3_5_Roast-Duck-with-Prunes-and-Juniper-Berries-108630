Wonderful flavor--cooked well in a small 1/2 oven in my stove. When turning the duck over, use a wide spatula and a meat fork-much easier.

I hate to add the 1 fork rating to a dish others have given 4, but having made a number of roast ducks, I experienced two major problems with this recipe. 1. The temperature was a very high 450. I got a nice crust on the skin naturally. The breast were cooked lovely, but the thighs were undercooked. 2. The giblets were used in almost a throw away manner that added no flavour to the dish. They would have been better used in the pan juices rather than in the duck cavity.

Wow ... out of this world. Rich, subtle, and delicious.

The flavor of the duck was great and the sauce was teriffic. I paired this plate up with a beautiful spring salad with blue-chesse wrapped in in prescuddio tied at the top with scallions, toasted/candied walnuts and a light mustard-lemon-vinegaratte dressing as well as a side of basmatti rice with a hint of lemon and plenty of crushed pistaccios. It was a terrific dinner, just not enough duck. =-)

While turning the duck over is really a two-person operation, I'd make this recipe again in a heartbeat. It is, by far, the most delicious duck recipe I've *ever* tried!

I was always looking for a recipe with Juniper berries and this one waw great, even by 8 year old daughter like this one. This is an excellent duck recipe, but it does require attention to detail. If you get distracted you could boil away the gravy.

This turned out great. The skin was brown and crispy, the prunes were delicious. I really could'nt taste the juniper berries though. Even though I bought a fresh bottle. I served with sauted mushrooms and turnips. The leftovers we ate for breakfast! Delicious.
