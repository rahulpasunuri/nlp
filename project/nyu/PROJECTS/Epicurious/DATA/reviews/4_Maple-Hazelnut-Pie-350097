Love this pie! Traditional pecan is just not that great to me, but this is perfect. The hazelnuts and maple are an unexpected combination. I used a good, more mellow, bourbon and it was great. This makes a great dessert to take somewhere because it surprises people. YUM!

Love this pie. It's a nice alternative to pecan pie during the holidays. I have made it for the past two Thanksgivings to rave reviews.

The bourbon came in too strong for me, as I don't like the taste of alcohol in my sweets. Others who do like alcohol flavor said they really liked this so it is a matter of taste. It is a shallow pie, more like a tart. I don't think I'll make it again.

This looks like a relatively easy (and delicious!) pie to make...but how long is the active time of making it?

With a bit of tweaking this is a delicious recipe. Do make it 24- hours in advance, the flavors need to meld. Do refrigerate. The burbon taste is only a nuance. Use a food processor for the hazelnuts...the mix of fine to coarsely chopped nut meats releases their flavor on many levels. Serve warm or room temperature w/a dollop of heavy cream or vanilla bean ice cream.

A few tips and this is an excellent recipe. Do make it 24 hours in advance of serving. Refigerate. It needs that time to set up properly and flavors to meld. The wonderful tang of the burbon reappears on day two. Serve in slender slices. Travels well!
