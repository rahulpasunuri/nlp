Very good grilling marinade. All spices that I have on hand. Easy to prepare. I will definitely use this one again.

I have made this several times and people love it! I think the key is to prepare the marinade the day before and let everything incubate overnight. Full of flavor!

This was an okay recipe with an interesting flavor but nothing to write home about.

My family enjoyed this dish, but did not rave about it. It was easy and fast to prepare.
