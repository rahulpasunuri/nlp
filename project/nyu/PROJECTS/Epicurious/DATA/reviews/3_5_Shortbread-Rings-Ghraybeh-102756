If you don't have the orange blossom water and rose water, don't bother making them, since at that point you're just making a regular shortbread cookie as opposed to the Gh'raybeh. The taste was subtle and divine, though not for the unadventurous, as the flower waters really perfume the cookies. Forming the rings was a bit tricky and time-consuming but well worth it, and they came out beautifully. Recommended.

These cookies are just ok. I followed the recipe except used grated orange peel instead of orange flower water. They were rather greasy and, while my family tried them and reported they were "good," noone asked for a second.

I also didn't have any orange-water or rose-water handy. Instead I used a tsp or so of cointreau, a dash of almond extract, and a dash of vanilla extract. I played around with it for a while until I found the taste I want - I literally would make a sample, eat it, and try again. I think it turned out to be an extra TBS of butter, 1/2 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp of almond extract, 2 tsp of cointreau, and a TBS of extra confectioner. I think next time I'll add some crushed almond and some orange zest into the cookies. They were too subtle for my taste, although I will probably be playing with this recipe, so definitely would recommend making them. 3 stars.

I love the subtle flavor of these cookies. I did have trouble getting the dough to cohere, though, so added 1/4 tsp water. The cookies were still light and crumbly.

I have made these 3 or 4 times always to rave reviews, not normally a fan of rosewater but it is very subtle here. I'm not an experienced baker so these are a good receipe for new baker.

I used all butter, so the cookies spread a bit. I couldn't find orange flower water (I'm on the lookout for it now, though :-), so I subbed half fresh orange zest and half orange extract for the amount of orange flower water called for. A delicate, sophisticated cookie with a taste that makes you reach for another, and another. Perfect with tea, and simplicity itself to put together. I think next time I won't bother making the rings (which I found was the only real work involved in the recipe), but will instead make small rounds.

Great cookie, and I didn't need to add any additional butter at all. I did, however, replace the orange flower water with about a quarter to half a teaspoon almond extract because I didn't have any.

I found that I needed to increase the butter a little bit to end up with dough that was a texture that would allow for being formed into rings, but the flavor was heavenly. These disappeared quickly at my office holiday party.

Gh'raybeh is a heavenly cookie. There are many variations of this recipe in the Middle East. I have not yet tried this recipe. Gh'raybeh is a recipe that takes time to perfect. The recipe I have is handed down from my mother. Take the time to experiment, that is if you love cooking. When the Gh'raybeh cookie recipe is perfected. It will be your calling card of cookies. A sophisticated and elegant recipe if prepared and presented properly. Good Luck!
