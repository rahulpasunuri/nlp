Great recipe but I was short on time and ingredients. I used 2/3-3/4 jar of pesto sauce, added canned chopped black olives, fresh chopped tomatoes and some fresh chopped basil for color and added flavor. Salted it a bit to accentuate the flavor and it was WONDERFUL! I spread a bit of pesto over the shark steaks for a marianade as I was making the pesto combination. I grilled the steaks partially then added the pesto combo on top to finish off the grilling. My husband loved it! We ate it left over the next day warmed up in the oven, so it was a great meal twice. I would serve it to guests.

This recipe was a disaster. It had no taste. I used shark. I used fresh tomatoes, everything else by the recipe. The fish itself tasted like cotton - no flavor whatsoever. I cooked it longer because mine was about 1" thick. The pesto never really got crispy on top in the broiler. Never again.

So yummy and simple. I used canned tomatoes and worked out great.

i made this tonight with shark that my neighbor just caught. it was a home run! i followed the recipe as it was written, but i used canned tomatoes. sometimes i think they have more flavor(and i am a jersey girl) this time of year. the almonds give it fabulous texture and flavor, and i used plain old regular green olives and will do the same next time. wee never cared for shark before, but i can't wait until our neighbor hooks (get it?) us up again.

I made the recipe exactly as given. We used fresh caught thresher shark. Following the instructions yielded the trapanese a little too thin for me. I will be more careful with tomato selection next time. And, choice of olives is important as well. I used Greek olives from the local deli. They were a little too powerful. I will either cut back the amount, or try a different olive next time.

This was great great,I used a homemade pesto and just added some ground almonds to it. Fantastic. Will make it again.

The fish and the sauce were AWESOME! The fish came out nice and juicy and the sauce was really good. It was very simple and easy to make. I can't wait to make this dish again. The previous reviewer who said the sauce was awful must have done something wrong. If this is not delicious, what is? Cardboard?

The fish was good, the sauce was terrible. Maybe I put too much on the fish, but it was just wasn't good at all. A real, simple pesto would have been better. The couple extra ingredients made this sauce taste too weird.

The pesto was delicious. The shark was awful. Would definately use this recipe on a different fish. Don't waste your timke with the shark.

This was a wonderful dish on a warm summers' evening. I used Blue Marlin instead of shark--any firm fleshed fish should work well. I grilled one side of the fish first, then turned it over, topped it with the pesto and finished grilling. I also used only 1 clove garlic since my hubby isn't a real garlic lover. Try sprinkling some grated Reggiano on top.

The Trapanese was great. I left out the almonds due to a nut allergy. I placed the fish on a bed of zucchini with suace in the middle. I will definately use the sause again for veggies and fish. Broiling with the bread crumbs gives it a nice crunch on top. Great!

Although my family did not care for the pesto trapanese sauce /shark combo (what kind of fish IS this?), the sauce itself is FABULOUS on toast points, wheat crackers, etc. as an appetizer. Retains color, flavor and keeps for days in the refrigerator.

well i had pretty thick fillets of shark, that took longer. didn't use bread crumbs but used a can of mexican tomato sauce and white wine, first broiling it then sautee'ing it slowly. just didn't like the texture of shark.

Just fabulous. The trapanese was the best I've ever had. I'll make it with one tablespoon of oil next time, just to cut the fat. I think it might even be better on chicken.

We used shark for the fish portion, and made the pesto from scratch. The recipe was absolutely delicious, with the shark steaks staying nice and moist. Not difficult to prepare. We also had calamari on the side, which seemed to complement the shark. A dry Italian wine was the best choice for this dish. We will definitely be making this again, and next time we will have guests, it was that good.

Delish! I used Shark steak, and followed the recipe to the letter, except I did not have almonds so I substituted almond extract, which was not such a great idea. It had a beautiful presentation and the pesto was fun to make. I look forward to making it again, only this time I will remember to buy the almonds! Enjoy!

The pesto trapanese sauce was incredible! I used swordfish and it worked well. The sauce could also be used on pasta. I will definately make this again.

I really liked this recipe - the fish (I used swordfish)stayed very moist and the pesto added great flavor. I would recommend reducing the amount of pesto suggested by about 1/3. I served the swordfish with a garbanzo bean and garlic crouton soup and a mixed greens salad with vinaigrette - it was great!

This was a great recipe. We tried to search for the recommended wine to no avail. I felt that the suggested pesto, 4 tablespoons per fish filet, was too much, and I went with 2 tablespoons. We used the extra pesto with salmon a few days later and it was also excellent; we were pleasantly surprised. This was an easy recipe and I would make it again.
