I loved this. I did as others suggested and added scallops after sauce was boiling. My scallops were large and took longer than 5 min to cook. I also added fresh lemongrass at beginning and added some fresh cilantro & basil at the end. I also held back a little on the fish sauce and was glad I did, sometimes I find it overpowering and hard to adjust if you put too much.

Very tasty. I did add about a tablespoon and a half of green curry paste to get it extra spice, along with lemongrass. Quick simple meal.

My husband and I basically used this recipe to give us a general idea in how to prepare it and we created from there. It turned out really well! We added: shallots, broccoli, palm sugar, 2 thai red pepper (when still sautéeing vegetables so it gave us the flavor and not too much heat, and actually, was perfectly hot - and I am very sensitive to peppers). We only added the scallops when the sauce was ready to avoid overcooking. I would never use soy sauce instead of fish sauce for this recipe.

I was so excited to try this, but I have to say was a little disappointed. If I make it again may try adding clam juice to lighten the milk texture.

I used all ingredients as called for except fish/soy sauce. I used the juice from the scallops instead. As others suggested I sauted the peppers and ginger a few minutes before adding coconut milk. Only added the scallops with 2 minutes to go. The only extra was a 1/2 tbs of chili garlic sauce for a little kick. My husband loved it.

recipe can be tripled, and tiny broccoli florets, thin cut carrot, mushrooms, etc. can be added to this for color,contrast and bulk. Add all(except mushrooms) right at the end along with scallops and let it cook as the broth cools off. Serve after 5-10 minutes. use light coconut milk, it doesn't change a thing except calorie content. great recipe.

Very good. I made alterations, based on other folks' comments. Chicken broth, curry paste, broccoli, snap peas, a couple of hot chilis, and a few pinches of sugar. Served over brown rice, very good!

This is a very strange combination of ingredients and it tastes that way. I would recommend using less lime juice and draining the liquid before eating.

Very tasty. I made some modifications though. I used 2:1 parts chicken broth to the coconut milk to cut down on the fat. I also added a 1/4 tsp of green curry paste, and some canned bamboo shoots and fresh sliced mushroom. I used frozen bay scallops which worked well. Also threw in some lemongrass. I recommend the lemongrass in a tube by Gourmet Garden, very easy to use and tastes fresh.

very tasty, very easy & quick. as has been said before, less time ont he scallops for sure. th first time i made it, they were rubbery. the second time, i put them in after the stew began to boil, and took it off the heat after just 2 or 3 mins or so. also, some red curry paste in the pan before the coconut milk adds some delicious depth. i served it over rice noodles.

This was really easy to prepare and very tasty. I agree with a lot of prior reviewers comments. Less time for the scallops for sure. I thought 3 TB of lime juice was a bit overpowering and will cut back to 2 TB next time. If you liked this, try the Thai Seafood Stew on this site--it has a some of the extras that many added to this recipe and is just as easy and quick.

I have made this twice now and the only changes I made were...MORE of ingredients...I used 1 lb of scallops, a whole red bell pepper, 2 T fresh ginger. Also, if you are using frozen scallops, make sure they are defrosted. If you add them to the mix frozen, they will add too much water and it won't taste as yummy. This recipe is delicious and QUICK!

this recipe was very easy and very tastey. i added 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro and served it over wide pasta.

I doubled the recipe, since I had 1 lb. of scallops, and added shrimp. I agree, the scallops will be like rubber if you follow the recipe. So, heat the coconut milk and pepper and ginger, add the shrimp, cook until barely pink, add the onions and scallops, cook maybe six minutes, and add the fish sauce/ soy sauce. I threw in about a teaspooon of red curry paste for zing. And another good way to get lemongrass flavor without the tough stalks is to use a tea infuser.

Scallops will be over cooked if you follow instructions in recipe. I Sauted bell pepper, ginger and a couple of small garlic cloves with a teaspoon of Thai green curry paste for about 3 minutes. Then I poured in the coconut milk and brought it to a boil. Then add the scallops and cook until just opaque. Time will depend on size of scallops you use. Remove from heat and add lime juice, fish sauce and green onions. It is a nice touch to dress soup with very fine lime zest once it is in serving bowls.

I agree with most of the reviewers in that this was delicious and easy to prepare. To "kick it up a notch", I added lemongrass, nuk choy (an asian green similar to bok choy), 2 thai chilies, clams, and added both fresh cilantro and fresh basil as garnishes. This would also be great with shiitake mushrooms or chili paste instead of the little chilies. One note - if you use lemongrass, make sure you add it in big pieces - if you chop it like I did you have to pick it all out. I used lite coconut milk as well. YUM!

I love asian food but I found this recipe too bland. I expected more flavor.

What a find! The taste is terrific and it literally takes abput 10 minutes to make. I served it over spicy Thai jasmine rice from a box mix and it was fabulous!

I like spicy food, so I added a TBS of Thai green curry paste to the coconut milk, and stirred in a thinly sliced serano pepper with the scallions. I also used shrimp along with the scallops and served it over Soba nooldes (japanese buckwheat noodles). Incredibly easy to prepare for such flavorful results. everyone I've made it for has loved it.

This dish is very good, easy and fast to prepare! I also used bay scallops and served over rice noodles. It was a hit, and I will be making this again.

I can't imagine anyone finding this "bland". The scallops are so delicately sweet, you could eat 'em raw and not find them bland! I loved this dish...easy, quick, fresh-tasting. It's a keeper for me.

This is one of my favorite recipes- so easy and so good. I've substituted bay scallops successfully and always use lite coconut milk. I've also made it for friends who enjoyed it as well. Definitely give it a try!

I enjoyed this simple, wonderfully flavored soup. I don't think it needs more "kick". The fresh ginger provides ample warmth. Anything more would overpower the subtle flavor of the scallops. I sauteed the pepper and a few T sweet onions in butter first. Used fish sauce, not soy sauce. Garnished with basil. Served over noodles.

Very quick. It does need an extra kick though. I also added some pea pods to add some color.

This is not something I will try again. Maybe it was my fault for using "lite" coconut milk rather than reg. It seemed like it was too simple to be true, and it was. I added two serrano chiles and a stalk of lemongrass(whole, then removed)and the flavor was still bland. We even sauteed the pep's and then ginger and serranos for added depth, but nothing helped. Skip it. My husband is yelling at me for not rating this "one fork." Okay, it is "one fork," Jeff!

Wonderful! I really enjoyed this, and it was so simple to make. I served it over udon noodles in big bowls, but next time will try it over rice. I am adding this to my list of favorites.

pretty good, but it needs a "kick". I added 1/2 tbs of Sambal Oelek (red chili paste), that did the trick.

This is so nice! It's quick, easy, delicate and very elegant. I served my stew over coconut rice with a glass of Riesling. Fantastic! No changes needed, in my opinion.
