well... all i can say is i seriously cannot understand the negative review loool! this stew is amazing! obviously as i was looking after my child the stew was left simmering a little longer than suggested (but i normally always do this with cookbook recipes!). the lamb was succulent and tender, the okra tender yet crunchy, and i even cooked a little basmati rice and served it with some of that! it was deliscious and EASY to remember how to do again! definately recommended to those who don't like spicy, yet love subtly tasty dishes!

Wow - this was horrendous! Can't believe I wasted good ingredients and time on this monstrosity. This is the first time I have been seriously unhappy with a recipe on this site. I would not recommend this to anyone.

delicious. i would definitely make this again. it is easy and the flavor is fantastic. be sure to get lamb cubes that are off the bone. (i think at least half the weight of my lamb was bone). also, add a little more water than called for. it says to simmer for 15 minutes after adding the okra but i found that some of the okra was too tough, so i would simmer it for 30 minutes next time.
