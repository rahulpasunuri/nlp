A nice change, but I don't recommend the custard. Instead I used Bird's custard powder (a product from the UK and often found in Indian groceries - or in the British section of larger supermarkets like Stop & Shop, Hannafords, Sweetbay and Publix amongst others). Otherwise this was a tasty, boozey treat!

This really didn't work out for me. The pears shrunk in baking so that I had very little left, and I burned the caramel sauce. The custard worked, so I ended up spooning it into dishes and covering it with the shrunken pears. I recommend taking things out earlier than directed!

I love trifle (so simple, soo delicious!) and I have made this one several times for various fall family gatherings. It is always a great hit! It's especially suited to Thanksgiving as it's easy, most of the steps can be done ahead, and it's very elegant. To those who found it too sweet, the sweetness may be impacted by the type of ladyfingers and amaretti you buy. I have found some brands to be sweeter than others. I have tried it both ways (as written and with a bit less added sugar) and have found that cutting back on the sugar does produce a more delicate and balanced dessert.

Made this for Thanksgiving. Just killer. Followed the recipe with the exception of reduced sugar and flour. Ladyfingers and spreadable fruit from TJ's and amaretti from Cost Plus. Though the latter appear to contain not a scintilla of almond, their flavor and crunchiness adds a lot to the trifle. I used Bosc pears and bought them in advance so they would have a chance to ripen. A mistake. They became soft before they were really roasted ---so don't be afraid of firm fruit. I also used 2 whole eggs and 2 yolks in the custard, and agree with the earlier reviewer that it would be nicer if cornstarch were used as a thickener rather than flour. However, since the custard is incorporated into so many other ingredients, it's really fine. Use a liberal hand with the brandy and amaretto. And ---no dessert purchased from a discount store can touch this.

Made for christmas dinnerfor forty guests. Cut down on sugar for pears and cream. Used half amaretti cookies and half white chocolate cadburylady fingers. Decorated with fresh raspberries and grated white chocolate. People took turns scraping the bowl!

Made this for X-mas Eve and it was way tooo sweet - maybe if the cookies were removed it would be better. Too bad - my pastry cream turned out great, the pears were tasty, it is easy to assemble, but boy it is way tooo sweet! I served this along with the Rasberry Marsala Trifle and everyone ate the Rasberry one! So the next day I started to pick the pear trifle apart - bite by bite - and I think if you take the amaretti cookies out it would be edible....I also cut down on the sugar and flour but it just was still sweet...

I was expecting so much more for a recipe that has received so many 4 fork reviews! I found this to be bland, in both taste and presentation. The pears (although I used D'anjou which could have been the problem) tasted just like canned pears and the pastry cream was thick, gloppy, and bland, even though I cut the flour and sugar as suggested in other reviews. Sorry, but this just wasn't up to par in my opinion!

Terrific trifle recipe. I followed previous reviewers' recommendations to cut down on the pastry cream sugar and flour, and it turned out great. I added amaretto to the whipped cream topping, as I found the recipe here a bit bland.

The amaretti cookies made this horribly sweet. I made this for Christmas last year and nobody could eat it because it was so sweet. Would not make again!!

Wonderful! I shall definitely make this again. A beautiful fall dessert. It is so rich that it easily serves more than eight.

Made this for Christmas and my entire family loved it. I used a bit more amaretto.

Rating: 4
This was an amazing dessert. I followed others recommendations of reducing sugar to 3/4 cup and flour to 1/4 cup in the pastry cream. Also didn't use as much sugar in the whipping cream to top the trifle. Used Italian ladyfingers which are little crisper. I prepared this for a dinner for 14 people--it was a hit. A little time consuming to make, but oh so worth it....I will make this again and again.

I prepared this trifle for a New Years Eve get-together. It was quite enough for 12 people. Everyone was in love with this trifle. I took the suggestions of cutting the sugar and flour (Great idea.) I also drizzled the roasted pears with poire williams for an extra umpff. I also substituted the amaretti cookies for normal almond cookies. I will keep this recipe for future use and have claimed it as my secret recipe. Hope you enjoy the trifle as much as my guest and I. Happy New Year!

I have made this for the second time now, for our holiday dessert table and I have to say that this is truly the piece de resistance! I used some roasted apples this year as my son had peeled a few too many for the pies and it turned out wonderfully with those as an addition to the bosc pears. This dish is perhaps harder to shop for than it is to prepare. Tips: Bosc pears are ripe when the skin at the top near the stem is slightly wrinkled. Amaretti cookies are available at Cost Plus and other bulk import stores. You can find them during the holiday season and you can freeze them. By the way, I sprinkle one crumbled on top after the whole think is completed and it looks divine. The custard may be the trickiest part of preparation and so I caution to add the heated cream slowly to the egg, never the other way around as the egg will cook and separate. As for the reviewer who claims that this was not worth the effort, and next to a Sam's Club Cake, it did not win any raves, some people, I suppose prefer McDonalds to a five star meal. If you are not one of those people however, I can assure you this dessert will not disappoint.

I, too, changes the flour and sugar amounts for the pastry cream and it came out fabulously. I could not find the cookies that it called for, so I substituted with "Almonette" cookies by Voortman (found at my local Publix and Winn Dixie) and it was great. Everyone raved!

I cannot understand the rave reviews over this recipe. I made it for a pre-wedding supper, using the changes suggested by other reviewers (less sugar and flour). It was still very sweet. I served it next to a big "million dollar" brownie cake from Sam's, which was surprisingly good. Can you guess which one got the rave reviews? Hint: It wasn't the trifle. For the effort wasted in finding hard to get ingredients (at least around here) and in view of the time and cost involved, it would have been better to make the Three Cities of Spain cheesecake or the Lime Mousse Cake, both of which are great recipes. This dessert was just okay, and I will not make it again.

I Made this for Christmas Eve and it was a huge success. Everyone raved. I halved the sugar and flour for the pastry cream (3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup flour). It turned out perfectly this way, not too sweet and creamy, not thick. I only added half the brandy and amaretto thinking it would be too strong had I followed the recipe. I was wrong! Next time I will all all 4 Tbsp each to give it more of that liquor kick. Delicious all the same though.

This was a spectacularly delicious dessert! I was asked to bring dessert to a new year's eve party, I brought this, and all the guests had to restrain themselves from licking their bowls. This served 10 guests generously, with enough left over for another four or more. I made a couple of small modifications. Following the advice of several reviewers, I made the pastry cream a little thinner, using a third cup of flour rather than a half cup. That was just right, I thought--creamy rather than thick. Also I used less sugar in the whipped cream. Other than that, it was pretty much by the recipe. For myself, I think it would be just as good using milk rather than cream in the pastry cream. Next time I think I will do that.

I made this recipe 3 times (once for Thanksgiving, twice for Xmas) and it was a hit every time. The pastry cream was a bit sweet the first time, so I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup the last 2 times. Also used less preserves to cut down on the sweetness. I agree that the pastry cream could be a little bit more...I will try less flour the next time. This one's a definite keeper!

My first trifle and it received rave reviews at the Christmas table! Serves closer to 11-12 than 8. Don't let the cream thicken too much and you may consider making a little extra.

Big hit!! I will make this again. As for pastry cream being to thick, I cut back a touch on the flour and that did the trick.

I agree with another review. The pastry cream was way to thick. I even tried thinning it with whipped cream and was not successful. I had to redo the cream using another recipe.

This is a good recipe but if the pastry cream is made differently it becomes a heavenly 4 star. I made it once with this recipe and once with a recipe for pastry cream that comes out silkier (uses half and half, cornstarch and butter, instead of the gloppy flour). If you want to make this, find a better pastry cream recipe!!!

I was really excited about this recipe after reading the reviews, and I love all the individual components - but I was disappointed with this. The custard was too sweet and overwhelmed the pears, which had a subtle flavor. I may try this again with adjustments, but a lot of this went to waste.

The first time I made this recipe I couldn't find lady fingers or the amaretti cookies so I used a Stella Dora biscuit type cookie and some kind of Italian macaroon. It was great. With substitutions or true to the recipe this Trifle has always gotten rave reviews. What's more, the longer it sits in your refrigerator, the better it tastes!

This dessert is truly outstanding! I received compliments from all. I was serving 11 people so I made a little extra; however, the original recipe (which is for 8) would have been fine, as I have quite a bit of leftovers. After a little looking, I got my Italian cookies at Bristol Farms and my soft lady fingers at Ralphs. I will definitely make this again. It is sure to become a family tradition.

This was a wonderful dessert!! I loved the combination of flavors. As stated before, not very complicated at all to make...especially if you make the cream and pears ahead of time. I will definitely keep this one on file.

WOW. I've never made a trifle before, so I was a bit nervous on how it would turn out, but it was great! Not nearly as complicated as it might sound. I made the pastry cream and the pears the night before, so all that was left was the assembly. Yum! And it does feed way more than 8!

I made this back in November for a Thanksgiving dinner party. It was a huge hit and relatively easy to prepare. Instead of ladyfingers, I used sliced sponge cake. I did however find the pastry cream a little too stiff. I would probably cut it with whipped cream next time for a lighter texture.

Like most of the other reviewers, I loved this recipe and, like many of them, made it for Xmas dinner. It was a sweet and light ending to a big meal, and it really looked elegant. I did find that I needed slightly more than 4oz of of the cookies.

We had this trifle for dessert on Christmas day and it was amazing. We were all stuffed from turkey but everyone made room to eat it. Next time I make it, I would make the entire dish (other than the cream) the day before to allow the flavours a bit more time to blend. Would definitely recommend it.

Made this as part of the English Menu for Christmas dinner for 17. This was our very first trifle, and we were a little leery as to how it would turn our. We made the triple chocolate cake on the cover as backup. Not to fear. It was wonderful and easily fed 17. Its richness lent itself to only one helping. The pastry cream was a question mark for us but it turned out fine. It was so good, I suppose we will have to make it again, and again and.........

I made this dish for Chistmas dinner and everyone seemed to like it, but no one raved. I think it might be a little sweet for some tastes--though my kids couldn't get enough of it. It was a great "do ahead" recipe, so I would probably make it again--I would just try to figure out a way to decrease the sugary taste.
