One of our favorites. Works really well with the Weight Watchers diet program.

Magnificent! I love that I can use my eggplant in a new way. I followed the recipe completely and it was perfect. I think I will try to substitute other shellfish when I can't readily get crab or shrimp. Fabulous!

This was delicious. I used smoked salmon (sauteed with the shrimp) instead of crabmeat. In the end I broiled the eggplants, so that the top became very crusty. My fiance said it was incredibly delicious. The eggplants really held the flavor of the fish well. I will use fewer breadcrumbs in the future.

Absolutely yummy! I loved the pairing of eggplant, shrimp and crab. I served it with glazed carrots and poached pears for dessert. I would definitely make this again!

There needs to be way more shrimp in these eggplants!! I not only used large shrimp (not XL or jumbo) but I also added 1/4 pound more and it still only averaged to be 3-4 each eggplant half. I would also recommend chopping the shrimp so you don't lose the best part in one small bite! I also used canned crab and I'm not sure if that contributed to the so-so flavor. Lastly, it was too bready for me. I would put a little less crumbs than required, better yet, I would substitute fresh French bread crumbs.

This dish was so disgusting that after a few horrified bites I had to throw the entire thing in the trash, something I have NEVER done before. I used the freshest ingredients and followed the recipe exactly, and the result was brown mush that tasted like prison food. The flavours did not complement each other at all. Even the addition of tomato sauce, in an attempt to salvage the eggplant/shrimp pairing, didn't work. I am completely baffled as to how anyone could say this was a palatable recipe. This is the only time I've ever disagreed so strongly with other reviews. What an expensive waste of food, time and effort.

This was very good. I was a bit hesitant but it came out delicious. Made a good dip of mayo and a good spicy sweet mustard a bit of cilantro. Delicious indeed!!! Can alway add a bit of sherry and a good cheese on the top melted. Yummy

In a word: Yum. Husband & I liked this. I felt adventurous as I don't cook with eggplant very often. I didn't use the crabmeat, just more shrimp. Next time I will try with crabmeat.

This was a great recipe, however, I omitted the crabmeat since my hubby only likes shrimp, yet it was still yummy. I did add a few more shrimp & breadcrumbs to get the right consistency. Have made this many times & get raves! Delicious!

I loved this recipe and thought it was worth repeating. My husband did not like it, so I will be doing it when he's out of town. He couldn't put his finger on what it was he didn't like.

This was great. I halved it--2 eggplants, 1 1/2 c. water, and added 2 caps portabellas, chopped, in with the onion saute. Delicious. It was a little bit brown, which worries me because I like colors on my plate, but it tasted great. And my picky BF ate TWO, so that was affirmation enough.

This was wonderful! At the point where you remove the skillet from the heat and before adding the crab and breadcrumbs, I ran this through the food processor and added the crab to it. I didn't measure the breadcrumbs, I added just enough to get the right consistency. I could eat this every day and I can think of so many other ways to serve this so I wouldn't grow bored...perhaps add a dash of wine and serve with crispy bread and crackers for an appetizer? This is excellent.

This seafood-stuffed eggplant is easy to make and very good. It is just as good if you do not have the crabmeat and just use shrimp

Very good. I wouldn't adjust the recipe at all, it's perfect the way it is.

The stuffing for this dish is excellent. My husband thought the stuffing was not firm enough, so I might bake it alone for 20 minutes before returning it to the eggplant. The stuffing would also be good stuffed into a lobster, filet, or stuffed in large pasta shells and baked.

Good, but not great. Needed something more. I might add mushrooms to the stuffing next time.

I thought this was very tasty even though I am not a big fan of eggplant. The stuffing was delicious and I received many compliments.
