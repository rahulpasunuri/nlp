Wow! We thought this was amazing. Used it tonight on steamed baby yukons and broiled salmon. Really flavorful. Can't wait to toss it with noodles or put it on steak.

Excellent compliment to my pan-fried tuna steaks. I only used 1 tblspn of lemon juice, but it was perfect. Beautiful blend and will definitely use again to compliemtn other other dishes.

This recipe has a perfect balance of flavors for a compound butter. I served it over steamed green beans and it brought them to another level. This recipe is a keeper!

Cut the lemon juice in half - we found it to be a bit overwhelming. Also, subbed red onion for shallot (all I had on hand). Came out great! Melted some to dip lobster into...guests raved!

I made this butter to use with grilled corn on the cob. It was delicious, and everyone was so impressed that I went through the effort to make it (although it wasn't hard at all).

Can someone please just review the recipe?

Also salted butter is made from a lower grade of cream, in addition to the amount of salt being an unknown.

Because salted butter is an unknown, whereas you can control the amount of saltiness when you salt the mixture yourself.

Can anyone explain to me why recipes sometimes call for unsalted butter, and then add salt anyway? I'm sincerely curious and would love to know! Pls e-mail me directly, thanks very much.
