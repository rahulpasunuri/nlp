I'd like to weigh in on the delicious side- this was a quick, easy and tasty dish. Like another reviewer, I didn't bother with the deep-frying (or related temperature taking) and instead just pan fried. Didn't bother with the fried onions- there was enough going on already. Also not sure if you need to egg-dip step- the chicken is wet from the marinade already.But the chicken came out tender and very flavorful.

i only marinated the chicken less than an hour and it still picked up flavor. i didn't have red wine vinegar on hand, so i substituted apple cider vinegar with a teaspoon of balsalmic. in hindsight, i think if i'd used a marsala wine, it would've been great with the balsalmic. the frying is much easier with a thermometer, of course, but i was impressed that the timing with the thermometer was the same as the recipe had listed to cook the chicken thoroughly and crisp the outside. i also think much harder to burn this breading than other fried chicken recipes. i'd probably add some thyme to the marinade as well, maybe grating in some onion while it sits and later straining it out. the thyme in the breading is good, but i'll probably play around with some other spices, and maybe adjust the breading to be little sweeter.

We enjoyed this recipe very much. The taste was different from fried chicken. It was a little time consuming but worth it. I made it with chichen breasts, my family favorite, removing the rib bones.

Not a very flavorful dish, far too much oil that left a greasy taste in your mouth. Would definitely not make it again. However, for a much more flavorful and healthy dish, use the same marinate sauce minus the mustard, brown the chicken under a broler for 3 minutes a side, place in a baking pan and pour about 1 1nch of wine in the pan, bake at 400 degrees for one hour, and sprinkle chopped mushrooms and swiss cheese in the last 15 minutes. Excellent dish! Use chicken quarters or Cornish hens.

Out of this world! I cheated a little and pan-fried the thighs instead of deep frying them, but the results were still wonderful. Very flavorful and a great fall dish. Next time I will try this with chicken breasts. Also, make sure you do the onions, they are an added treat definitely worth the effort.
