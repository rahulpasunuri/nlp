I have never been able to successfully make mashed potatoes. Maybe its the red potatoes, I don't know, but my family LOVED my potatoes, for once! Only variation I did was to use half milk/half 1/2 and 1/2, because we only have skim milk in the house and I thought the half and half would help. It did.

I am a novice cook, and this couldn't have been easier. Based on other comments, we browned 2 large cloves garlic in a little oil in a pan and threw that in before mashing. I also used half-and-half, as someone else did - but mainly due to not having any milk. We used red potatoes, and added salt, and they were outstanding.

Simple and just what I needed and leaves plenty of room for adding ingredients.

the potatoes turned out good but would have been better with 2 tablespoons of mayonaise.

Turned out a slight bit bland. I would use more garlic or something next time.

Loved it! Added garlic cloves to give it a kick. It was very creamy and tasty. I also used half and half insted of milk.

Great basic potatoes. I made them with the roasted garlic and will try the other flavor suggestions. I did try the potatoes prior to the addition of the garlic and still found them good.

Great basic recipe. Easy and pretty foolproof. I added some sauteed leeks. It was enjoyed by the adults and children alike.

You must generously salt the water you boil the potatoes in for there to be any flavor! Then still add more salt and pepper at end to make the taste come alive.

I'd never actually made mashed potatoes myself; this recipe was very easy to follow and turned out delicious. Perfect consistency. I only needed 3/4 cup of milk, but I did add a little bit more butter.

A good basic recipe that will never fail you. I add garlic and herbs (parsley, chives, & rosemary) when I have them handy to spruce up the dish.

The lazy way to make garlic mashed potatoes is to add a couple/few peeled garlic cloves to the water and boil them along with the taters. drain and mash together and add the milk, butter as wanted. yum. easy.

This is the way to do it. Just be sure to let the milk warm to room temperature and add it gradually. You may not need or want it all.

This is a great start, BUT try adding a little zest to your meal by adding roasted garlic to the mashing process. A flavored oil can also be a great substitute for butter.
