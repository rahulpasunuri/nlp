This is a good, simple recipe! My husband and son love it. I use whatever fruits are in season. I serve the fruit and syrup with Hagen Daz lemon sorbet. Great supper dessert!

Of course, I don't need to tell people in the Pacific Northwest that we routinely have a dozen varieties of fresh berries between June and August at our local farmers' markets: red, black and white currants, red and white gooseberries, raspberries, black raspberries, strawberries, tayberries, marionberries, boysenberries, blackberries, huckleberries, and even elderberries. Now if I could just get my lemon verbena to produce enough leaves for the early berries, lol.

Excellent dish; I've made it several times with fruit from the farmer's market (where it is easy to find _several varieties_ of each color gooseberries and currants, actually, along with the lemon verbena). I've varied the recipe by using any and all of the seasonal fruit available so far this summer and it's worked well with all of them.

Luckily, I, too live in the Twin Cities and we have wonderful Farmers' Markets. This is a delicious recipe - and to the first commenter, the recipe offeres CHOICES in fruits so you don't have to use those you don't have available. I'm delighted to have a way to use the Lemon Verbena I grow each year from plants purchased at market, it's one of my very favorite herbs.

You need to tell readers "cape Gooseberries" otherwise known as "ground cherries" as shown in your illustration which are totally different the regular gooseberries. Lemon Balm can be substituted for Lemon Verbena since it is common in gardens. In the end this was cloyingly sweet. Next time I would use half the sugar, or even less, especially if you are using seasonal fruit as it should already be sweet. It was so sweet I didn't bother with the cassis sorbet...it would be better with a pound cake to soak up the (reduced sugar) syrup. Right now in order to use this up I am serving fruit drained of syrup over thickened yoghurt. I would make this dish again (it looks beautiful) but not with that much sugar.

Note that you can comment without rating the recipe. That way you don't throw other readers off track with a rating when you have not made the recipe. The comments from the other reviewer are interesting. But some of us can find the ingredients called for. We have lemon verbena in our garden and can find currants from local farmers and farmers markets. It's nice to be able to try these things.

OK, so I haven't made this recipe (even in high summer with a fantastic local farmers' market, there is no fresh lemon verbena to be found). However, I have a few comments. First, gooseberries, unless very recently picked (like, a few days) even when ripe, don't necessarily have the nicest of textures. The ones from the farm on which I work are, in fact, rather mealy, and I think the best thing to do with them is simply to make pie or jam. Second, black currants are not, in fact, "too sour" to eat raw. In my experience selling them at our local farmers' market, they are an acquired taste; Brits seem to like them raw, and most people born/raised here in the States think they just taste...weird. Personally, I think they taste a bit like kerosene, though they make a divine jam. Finally, I have to wonder about the practicality of this recipe. Where, in the US, aside from, perhaps, NYC and SF (I am guessing), can one procure goooseberries AND white currants, not to mention lemon verbena? My boss is the only one who grows currants and gooseberries locally, and none of the grocery stores carry them; most people around here don't even seem to know what these items are. It seems that the author is thinking more of European grocery stores, and not taking into account a vast American reading/cooking audience.
