Perfection! This is one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten. I made it with the pasta salad with tomatoes and peas for a picnic concert. The sandwiches were a hit; we couldn't stop eating them.

We have eaten these sandwiches twice in a week--they're that good! A great, grown-up sandwich for a weeknight picnic. Since you make them the night before, it's just a matter of loading them into the basket. The artichoke spread is wonderful, both in terms of texture and flavor. Now I am combing Epicurious for similar sandwich recipes--I may never cook again!

Tasty sandwich that stores remarkably well. The flavors reminded my husband of torpedo sandwiches he used to enjoy in his youth. I used thinly sliced provolone instead of mozzarella. For the olivada, I blended (until it was smooth) 1 cup pitted deli green olives (seasoned with red peppers); 1 tablespoon drained and rinsed capers (helps reduce the saltiness); freshly- ground black pepper; a pinch of garlic powder; 1 teaspoon chopped lemon zest in a food processor, while slowing adding 3 tablespoons extra- virgin olive oil. Ill definitely make this again, both for summer dinners on the deck and to take with us on our vacation driving trips.

I made this last week and it was delicious! My boyfriend loved it. I did add a little crushed red pepper to the artichoke mixture to give it a little extra zip. I had also made bruschetta that day since I had some fresh basil left over. My boyfriend added some before eating, which also added some more flavor. I wouldn't add it before hand, though, because thre fresh tomatoes might make it too soggy.

This had so much potential but let me down. I think it would be better without the olivada, which the saltiness of which overwhelmed the other flavors. Next time I'll put the artichoke spread on both sides and have the salami and cheese in the middle. The flavor could have benefited from a stronger presence of the acid in the artichoke spread.

I made these for a picnic and they were a big hit! I made them the night before and wrapped them individually in parchment paper tied with kitchen twine. I used foccacia instead of the rolls, and provolone. I will definitely make them again.

This recipe was a hit with the in-laws. I omitted the olivada & mozzarella and it was still great. Not too many flavors. I will definitely make it again.

I used a loaf of Italian ciabatta bread (estimated it was approx the size of the 4 rolls combined). The only other change I made was provolone instead of mozzarella. Made this the night before a picnic lunch, wrapped tightly in saran and weighed down overnight in the fridge. It traveled well in the saddle bag of our motorcycle.

I made this for a ladies' luncheon and the ladies loved it! Flavorful and not too messy to eat. Love being able to do it all the night before.

Great sandwich. Prefer thin provolone to mozzarella. The cheese shouldn't be the focus of this sandwich - it's the filling that makes it so good.

Amazing sandwich. Made them a day ahead for a picnic, and they were a big hit with everyone.

Made these for the family for an 18-hr road trip. Used basil wraps istead of bread, made my own olivada, used chorizo instead- VERY flavorful. Satisfying without being too filling. Recommend for picnics or school lunches!

Be sure to do ahead--it allows the flavors to develop and blend. Everyone raved about them and I'll definitely do this recipe again. Similar to a "muffaletta" sandwich, New Orleans, style.

A damn good sandwich, and I only performed a half-assed execution of this recipe -- no measuring, no olivada, no refrigeration. Simple to make yet impressive for a party. One note on the recipe -- why bother to drain the oil from the tomatoes if you're going to add olive oil later? I used the tomato oil with good results.

Terrific sandwich. I also used foccacia and think that it works better than rolls. I'm planning on adding some sliced peperoncini next time, yum!

Yes, these are "to die for"! Made them on focaccia also and used both green olive and black olive tapenade. They sat for several hours before cutting and were a big hit at a tailgate party. I truly loved them because they contain some of my favorite foods and will certainly be making them again soon!

Very good. I used foccacia as well. Great summer picnic fare. You have to let it sit overnight.

I've made these sandwiches twice now and both times got rave reviews. The second time I used foccacia and it was to die for. This one is a keeper.

made these sandwiches for out of town friends who came over for an impromptu evening. i omitted the olives - thought the salami was salty enough. used genoa salami which had a nice flavor. nothing to die for but nice of a relaxing meal.

Made these to take to a party on a sail boat in San Diego on a beautiful summer day (now that you are all jealous!) They dissappeared in seconds, and the pre-teens liked them too. The secrets are the very best bread you can get, which by definition cannot come from a supermarket, and the resting period.
