I'm the same - never been able to make good white rice...so embarrassing! My husband can't believe I have to consult a recipe for rice. But this recipe works and makes quality rice everytime.

I'm so embarrassed. I've never been able to successfully make rice...even in a rice cooker! This is the first time that I've ever made rice that worked! Yeah! No more picking rice up from my local Chinese restaurant!

Using a rice cooker is the best, easiest, no-brainer method to properly cook rice. And THE BEST medium grain rice I have eaten is the KOKUHO RICE from KODA FARMS. I have many asian friends and my relatives who have eaten this specific rice for many years (2-3 generations).

I searched for I don't knnow how long...to find a recipe that would tell me how to cook rice int he microwave...Finally! Thank goodness for those who thought to post their reviews with their own variations. College students living in dorms only have microwaves at their disposal (usually). Thanks! :P

The recipe sounds delicious enough, but I have difficulty stomaching spicy food. All that salt! Pass the Tums! Anywho, I added it anyway-"Bam!" I said, as I dumped it in. When I made it, I wasn't sure what size cup to use, since it wasn't specified, but it turned out OK. I have to hand it to the cook in WV who recommended this recipe- it was pretty good.

For those of you who don't know, rice is pretty important to most of the world, and like most simple things, is quite an art form (perfect rice anyway). This recipe is the first I've seen that lists the correct amount of water and salt, but I put the rice in with the water and salt, bring everything to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to very low, cover tightly, and cook for exactly 15 minutes. Then fluff with a fork, cover again and let stand for 5. Perfect every time!

I have to admit, I didn't really try this recipe, I'm quite fond of the way I make it. I'm from the Lowcountry in South Carolina and we LOOOVE rice. Anyway, I just have to say, I have so much fun reading all the comments on this site! Thanks to all the great suggestions on various recipes, I have prepared many wonderful dishes. And thats really what its all about isn't it?

Yes, I agree with Boulder, CO that there is definitely a technique to making rice! If you think about it, there are many techniques, depending on the type of rice and its appropriate cooking method. There are some rices which require rinsing, there are some rices which require soaking,... A rice cooker is good, a microwave is handy, baking in the oven is nice - but it all depends! That's why it's lovely to see a basic rice recipe like this inexplicably controversial one, to show that it's not really all that frightening.

I'm sure that this rice is excellent but you can make the BEST rice if you follow these instructions: turn your pot on High, melt some butter in the pot, pour the rice in, stir the rice till it turns opaque, dump in the water, stir, and return to a boil. Then simmer on low for however long it takes (30 minutes at altitude). The butter trick definitely makes it taste much better. So it is just rice but I think there is a technique!

There are many reasons people need a basic recipe for plain white rice -- as well as hard boiled eggs, Jello (especially with fruit added), white sauce, etc. etc. Mine is medical; I have minimal long-term memory, so EVERY time I cook anything I have to have a book, box, bag or printed Epicurious recipe on the kitchen counter right next to me. I can even forget what I'm supposed to do if the book is across the kitchen. Enough on that. The point is I applaud Epicurious for reconizing various needs and continuing to post simple as well as complex recipes for all of us. Within my limitations, I am considered a very good cook and have managed my share of souffles and sauces. So please don't judge everyone by your own viewpoint. And keep the silly comments coming; they're fun!

This is a good proportion of rice and water -- but to guarantee that nothing burns or sticks, I would recommend cooking rice in the microwave. It's more forgiving -- generally, for each 1 cup rice, use 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cups water or broth. Microwave on high for 6-7 minutes, then 50% power for 12-14 minutes. Easy.

I would personally like to thank the folks at Epicurious for trying to be a web site for all people. Rice can be an intimidating thing for a novice cook to attempt, I have many friends whom I cannot persuade to step out of the box (minute rice, that is). To those who think they are displaying a sort of sarcastic wit, cut it out. Remember you too had to learn how to cook once.

I cooked this last night. Nice simple recipe. I found the dish a little bland and will definitely cook it again - maybe next time I'll try a sauce or something with it.

Thanks. I'll still screw it up.

If you're indignant over the simplicity of this recipe, you could move on to various cooking methods and various types of rice (govindavog, calasparra, etc.). A good book to read is Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid's Seductions of Rice. If you want to know more than you ever thought you'd want to know about rice, you can have a boo at www.riceonline.com.

I have nothing against rice cookers, but it's always a good idea to know how to make rice without one. You wouldn't want to rely on a food processor without having learned how to handle a chef's knife first, would you?

I agree with a Cook on 2/26/02. Believe it or not, with boil-in-the-bag rice and the advent of the microwave, many people do not know/remember the traditional stove top method of preparing white rice. Thank you for posting this recipe.

I do believe that Ipswich, England was being facetious. I loved the bit about the "epitomy" (sic) of perfection.

Rating: 2
To Ipswich . . . Something (or someone) is either perfect or not -- there are no degrees of perfection. We all know, however, that there is no such thing as perfection, as your post proves brilliantly.

White rice, as with anything else culinary, has many ways in which it can be cooked. 20+ years ago I subscribed to Craig Claiborne and Pierre Franey's ratio of 1 part rice to 1-1/2 parts water, approx. 17 mins., and it has never failed me. And I've been making rice at least once a week for 25+ years. Be that as it may, since I learned to cook white rice in the microwave 12 yrs. ago, I almost always prepare it that way: 1 part rice, 1-3/4 parts water; 2 (or 3) qt. glass casserole; 7 mins. on High, 14-16 mins. on Medium; let sit 5 mins., then uncover and fluff. This is a VERY forgiving recipe, almost impossible to screw up. You can hold the rice for at least an hour -- or for days in the fridge. I also often add seasonings during cooking. Nonetheless, nowadays I almost always use brown rice, and that's gotta be done on the stove, 45 mins., no bout adoubt it :- P.S. Forget about rice steamers -- worthless cabinet-space wasters. FYI, many Italians swear by cooking rice like pasta, with beaucoup water, then draining. And then there's the Chinese method, and the Egyptian, and the Persian.... yawn. Happy internecine squabbles, kids.

Many people (including myself) try to impress and out-do each other by seeking out unusual dishes with fancy ingredients, yet they lack many "foundation" skills. For instance, I don't know how to scale and bone a whole fish, and I wouldn't know how much water to add to, say, 5 cups of rice without consulting a recipe. There's something for everyone at Epicurious, so we should take what we can use, and be happy that the recipes we don't need will be of assistance to other folks. Peace!

Hello! Unlike most reviewers here, I actually made the rice out of curiosity. It turned out perfectly. (My previous results with rice have been hit & miss, depending on the amount and type of rice.) Proper guidance for making all kinds of food - isn't that what Epicurious is all about?

Since I usually use the proportions of two cups of liquid to one cup of rice, I did try this to see what it would be like. It doesn't give as good results as does the 2 to 1 ratio. The rice does not become fluffy. I would give it less than 1 fork if it were an option. I sometime use a rice steamer, and in that instance less liquid than 2 to 1 is used.

I drain rice, and I am originally from the Deep South. It is also common in Asian cuisine. And not everybody can make rice well. I have a friend who is quite a gourmet, who can't even make rice in a rice cooker!

FYI Toronto, et al: Many people simply throw rice into a large pot of boiling water and drain it through a colander when its done. In fact, I understand that this is the preferred method in the Carolinas, where much of our rice is grown.

This recipe is here as an accompaniment to CHICKEN AND VEGETABLES BRAISED IN PEANUT SAUCE, an African recipe. It gives aguide line on how much rice to prepare.
