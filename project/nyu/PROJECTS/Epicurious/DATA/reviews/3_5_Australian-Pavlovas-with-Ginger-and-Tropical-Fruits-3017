Pavlova is the dessert to please everyone and with the ginger and cardamom added, the kids hated it and most of the adults found it "interesting" As for the whipped cream concoction we found it unnecessary and would have preferred plain whipped cream or double thickened cream. You can add whatever fruit is in season -don't limit yourself!

I (uncharacteristically) tried to follow the recipe fairly faithfully. The only changes I made were some variation in the fruits and forming the meringue into a large rectangle rather than individual smaller units suggested. Overall, it was quite good but my panel of ravenous experts,aka teenagers who have eaten my Pavlova for years, felt that the ginger was disconcertingly chewy in the midst of the crunch of the meringue, although they some liked the ginger flavor. The whipped cream/sour cream topping also didn't rate as highly with them as the slightly sweened and flavored (perhaps a little rum, brandy or Frangelica) chantilly-like whipped cream I usually make. This is a good recipe and I certainly didn't have to force myself to take a second portion, but the household seemed to prefer the old standby. I might experiment with adding ginger juice to the meringue the next time I make it.

This has been a big topic of argument between the two countries. Australians are positive it was first invented there BUT it has been proven otherwise. A recipe book printed in the late 1920's was found in a New Zealand libary with a basic recipe for pavlova. A recipe printed five years before the Australian pavlova recipe.

Perfection! I used about 1/3 less ginger, and that was enough! Otherwise, it was absolutely perfect.

This is even better than the "original" pavlova recipe. Ginger and cardamom add a nice zip.

This recipie received a glowing review from all members of my wine (and food) club, when Australian wines were the theme. I received several requests for the recipie.

Was just interested to see whether this recipe is first attributed to Australia or New Zealand, as the two countries are having differences over the origin. Will be interesting to find out who wins. I think I would add other fruits like banana, paw-paw (papaya), and prickly pears with plain whipped cream and a touch of sugar. I will try out the recipe and let you know. It's a very appealing recipe, but rather time consuming, and, of course, fattening - but once in a while one could forget the diet!
