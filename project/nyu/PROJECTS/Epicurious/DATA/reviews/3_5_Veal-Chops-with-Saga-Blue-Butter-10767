Simple technique worked beautifully. The blue cheese overpowers the delicate veal, even grass-fed. Going to try the morel recipe next month!

I don't give 4 forks often, but this dish warrants it. Made this for my husband's 50th birthday and he raved. Like the cook before me, I grilled the special cut veal chops I ordered from my butcher. Easy and elegant, this one's a keeper.

Incredibly simple way to add wonderful flavor to a veal chop. Grilled chop on barbecue for 7 minutes each side.

Excellent and easy dish to prepare. Saga blue cheese is a perfect match for the delicate veal chop!

I love elegant dishes that are easy to make. This is a good recipe to use when you are having another couple over and want to impress them but not be cooking all the time. I used very thick veal chops and prepared exactly as described in the recipe. The mild "blueness" of the saga, which is rich in its own right, combined nicely with the butter and other ingredients. A very delicate flavoring for a very delicate-tasting meat. I served it with orzo, mixed with butter, chopped parsley, lemon juice, a little salt and a fair amount of ground pepper. Just add a green vegatable or a salad and you are ready to go.

This is a very easy and delicious recipe. I marinated my chops in balsamic & a little olive oil and then grilled them. I made a balsamic reduction sauce to drizzel over the chops & butter. Served with sauteed spinach over orzo! Yummy!

My husband and I made this for a weekend dinner. Delicious. We used 1 1/2" chops, and made the whole recipe for just us. The onions were wonderful, glad we made more, and the leftover sauce, went great with pasta as a side a few days later. Would use this recipe for company.

This is simple to make but only just okay to my mind. Basil Crusted Veal Chops or my all time favorite, Roasted Veal Chops with Shallots, Tomatoes and Olive Jus, are better.

outstanding, multi purpose butter. i personaly prepare it and serve it with a certified angus, 12 oz, kansas city strip steak, dry aged 28 days. sells like a champ! randomly run it on special at the number one rated bbq house in the country by zagets, here in kansas city, the home of real bbq. oh yes, the restaurant is jack stack, and yes, it is that good!
