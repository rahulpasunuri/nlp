I made this recipe for a luncheon for 20 ladies. They were devoured! Everyone thought the sandwiches were great. It is a super easy recipe since you just throw everything into a food processor. As another cook suggested, I added the nuts after I had blended the other ingredients to give it a little crunch.

I will confess that this recipe is not for everyone. I did a party for 50 and thought this would be a nice change of pace. At this party, people raved about it. I would also add, like previous reviewers, it is imperative you use high quality ingredients. This was one of those recipes where people were pleasantly surprised by the fact that I served a tea sandwich and that it was something one does not come across often. If you are in a pinch, I suggest using the Pepperidge Farms white bread. Cut the crusts off and put exactly 1/4 cup of ham spread on it. Then you get nice triangles. Do not make ahead of time. Even if you lightly butter the bread, it doesn't quite have the same "freshness".

As with most 'generic' recipes, this one depends heavily on the quality of the ingredients. I used a well-smoked ham, a sweet red onion and a local bakery Italian loaf... I also added the pecans towards the end of the pulsing, so they were still somewhat chunky. This is a great 'base' recipe, that can be adjusted to one's pantry or tastes. I've made this with everything from salami to keilbasa, I've varied the type of onion, pickle and mustard I've used, and it always turns out. A keeper.

Eh. We made these for a cocktail party and they were fine, but there are better tea sandwiches out there. Try the onion and parsley with lemon cayenne mayonnaise on this site. We dipped the sides in minced parsley to get that pretty look in the photo, which was indeed nice, but the taste was not exciting to me.

I made this for my New Year's Eve party. I was hesitant to use white bread for anything, but it worked really well. Also, I used a Mexican habanero hot sauce instead of Tabasco for a little extra kick and everyone loved it.
