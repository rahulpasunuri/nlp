I have not made these but a friend has made them twice- once for my wife and I and once for a dinner party of twenty. Both times everyone was blown away. He made the beet salad both times but the gorgonzola bombolini(donut) is so good that no one cares about the beet salad. No disrespect to the other reviewers but they did not eat the same thing I ate. I will try and make it myself very soon.

I like gorgonzola, but this was just not the worth the effort. Really its just ok, its not great. Even over the beet salad that this can accompany I wouldn't bother. Its not a dish that someone who is not a great gorgonzola fan will stand up and become a convert after tasting it.

I loved these; the dough is sticky but it fries up well. The only thing is, my bombolini turned quite dark very quickly, i don't think it was the oil bc i used a new batch of oil - i think they cook in about 30 seconds. the gorgonzola was perfect for the slight sweetness of the bread.

These were good. I had to add a LOT more flour to make a doughy consistency. Had trouble with the second rise and I used newly purchased yeast. But the end result was very yummy and they were all gone in a trice!

This was a real treat! They were perfectly fluffy - crispy on the outside with melted cheese on the inside. This recipe went well with the beets. I used Point Reyes blue, but I'm sure other cheeses would be excellent as well!

Not sure they're worth the work, but if you're a sucker for gorgonzola like I am (or any blue cheese for that matter), give these a try for something different and fun.

Excellent, and easy to make. Dough is sticky so have extra flour on hand. My only complaint was how the recipe was written. I couldn't get my yeast to proof, so in the end I add a pinch of sugar to the milk/yeast mixture, and viola! Yummy! I served mine with Buffalo sew instead of the beet salad.

Yummy. The gorgonzola was a great surprise inside. I look forward to trying the Bomboloni with other fillings that are more kid- friendly.

I must admit, I'm not a fan of deep frying, things never seem to come out as well as they do in the magazines, and half the time I get totally spattered with oil. But this recipe made me look at deep frying in a whole new light. You definitely want to have a lot of flour on your workspace, the dough is really sticky, but otherwise they assemble easily. I used the Oregon blue cheese, and they fried up beautifully. They were slightly crisp on the outside, and didn't spatter at all. Didn't have a chance to eat them until they'd cooled down completely, but they were still quite excellent. I'll definitely be making this again, and I'll even try different fillings, too.
