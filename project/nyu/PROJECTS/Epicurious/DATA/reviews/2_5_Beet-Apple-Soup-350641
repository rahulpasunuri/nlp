I roasted the beets instead of boiling them. I also didn't use the apple juice. Recipe turned out fine. Good beet and apple flavor. Very healthy and tasted good. Would prefer to have my beets in a different form most of the time though.

The recipe sounded great and easy, but it really wasn't worth the trouble. The soup was very sweet and didn't have the subtle layers of flavor you would expect from the ingredients. Try it, but don't expect too much...

The recipe seems to have been corrected. I made this last night and it was excellent.
