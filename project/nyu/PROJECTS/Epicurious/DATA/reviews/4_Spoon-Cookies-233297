I have made these cookies dozens of times as they are my entire extended family's favorite cookies. Trial and error has taught me the following tips: 1. Watch the butter closely, it turns from "browned" to "down" the sink in seconds. 2. After 5 minutes in the ice bath, pour the butter into a large metal mixing bowl. Let the butter stand for at least 1 hour before you add sugar and vanilla. 3. Mix the dry ingredients with a whisk for at least 1 minute, turning the bowl as you go. Many people skip this step but, you keep the dough consistent if you complete this step. 4. Use a wooden spoon to mix the dry and liquid ingredients together. Don't use a mixer or a whisk. Like a biscuit, you are "cutting in" the fat to the flour. 5. When the dough is nearly mixed, go ahead and stick your hands in it! (wash them first!) Finish mixing the dough by hand until consistent. 6. Place the dough in a zip lock bag for at least 12 (yes, 12) hours or overnight. Do NOT refrigerate! This will give you cookies that won't crumble or turn into sand when you bake them!

Never refrigerate the dough-you will end up with a pile of hard dry sand that is even more difficult to shape. The browning of the butter can be tricky-there is a fine line between browning it for optimum flavor and burning the whole thing and tossing it in the trash. The people that love them become almost cult like in their obsession. Nothing better than that kind of foodie love for a baker.

Every year I say I'm not going to bother, and every year I make a double batch that is still not quite enough. This year, I cooled the butter/sugar, beat it with the kitchen aid and then added the vanilla/flour/etc. I shaped these into thumbprints (not easy) and baked them with the jam. Completely amazing, but I think the sandwich version is better. Still the best. cookie. ever!

I think that i have reviewed this before, but i feel its important to mention again what a wonderful cookie this is. The dough can be tricky but it is ultimately a very versatile. And the brown butter technique is worth its weight in gold!!! Have reused it multiple times in other recipes with amazing results. Trying new recipes is essential for the fact that a exposes the home cook to new options and techniques that might not have been attempted before. The brown butter was a taste that I had been trying to replicate in other dishes and learning this technique as described in the cookie recipe has been worth it. Go for it!!!!

I've made these cookies a couple times now and e them. I am so glad I found the recipe again. I had the original Gourmet magazine they printed it in but, have moved and lost it somewhere. For those who wonder about the texture, it is supposed to be grainy according to the article in the mag. I like mine dipped slightly in dark chocolate with or without the raspberry jam.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe before, and it is as delicious as everyone says! Yes, it's a bit difficult to work with the dough, but it is worth it. Waiting two days is also important - it's amazing what that does for these cookies! It also helps them firm up even more so they don't crumble when you bite them. The first time I made these I waited until the butter resolidified to mix in the flour, and they were great. This time, I forgot what the reviewers said happened if you didn't, and mixed in the flour while the butter was still liquid but beginning to turn opaque (per recipe instructions). I'm a little worried what will happen now, but we'll see!

These cookies never fail to garner complements. Easy recipe.Skip the kitchen sink with ice water bit. When the butter is browned and smelling nutty just transfer to a bowl that can withstand high temps and let the butter cool to room temp on the counter.I also never sandwich the cookies with jam. I find it makes them over sweet.

I have made this recipe 4 times now and I have a solution to the sandy texture problem encountered by some. It is important to let the browned butter cool before adding the sugar and more importantly, letting it solidify before adding to the flour mixture. I prefer using the food processor to mix the flour, baking soda, and salt. The first time I made this recipe, my butter mixture was still liquid when I mixed it into the flour. The result was sandy cookies that spread out into a mess on the cookie sheet. The second time, I waited until the butter and sugar mixture was solid again. The dough looked more like pastry in the food processor and the cookie retained its spoon shape in the oven. I also chilled the dough in the fridge for about an hour. That helped too. Using a very thin layer of jam helps the cookies set well. A beautiful recipe in which technique matters.

Rating: 1
I am with the people who don't understand what the fuss is about here. I followed the recipe exactly and these cookies turn in to sand when you bite in to them, and I find the taste to be downright odd...it tastes like the baking soda. it also made closer to a dozen than 30 cookies, and even with the smaller number there wasn't enough preserves...I don't know what is going to happen to them in the next two days but I can't imagine it is going to work magic.

Rating: 3
I love the flavor of these cookies, but the spoon thing is a pain in the Christmas stocking. I also prefer a greater ratio of jam to cookie than this recipe provides. I roll the dough out to about 1/4" and cut them into rounds. I use four fruits or raspberry jam for the filling and add Grand Marnier to taste. It all combines to make a fantastic, five fork cookie.

Rating: 4
I made 2 batches of these right away...so good! One with raspberry preserves, one with cherry preserves. I would recommend popping in a movie or listening to a favorite album to keep your mind off how long it takes to form these. The end result is worth the effort but I still think I will save baking them for special occasions. I love that there are no eggs, soy, or milk in this recipe - this means my nephew with allergies can have some too!

These cookies are sinfully good. I followed the recipe closely but mixed the flour mixture together with the butter mixture in the food processor just until it came together as a dough. Then, bearing in mind the criticisms of others who found the dough difficult to handle and too crumbly, I applied the fraisage technique (smearing the dough away from you with the heel of your hand and then gathering it together, repeating this a few times). The dough was extremely easy to handle after this. I used my Danish Princess (1938 Holmes and Edwards) teaspoon to form the dough - rather tedious but you do get into a rhythm. Yield: 42 melt-in-the-mouth cookies. And yes, they are delicious the day they are made but transcendent after two days. The original article in Gourmet is an amusing read for those of you who can get your hands on the December 2005 issue of this wonderful magazine.

I tried making 2 batches of these today. I followed the directions exactly, but the cookies spread out really thin in the oven. Then, when they were cooling, they were so crumbly that I couldn't even pick them up with a thin spatula. I have the second batch of dough that I put in the refrigerator. I hope this batch turns into something edible.

I didn't believe the recipe when it said to serve after two days. I've always believed cookies should be fresh. So, I made two batches. One three days before and one the night before. The people who could tell the difference, preferred the 'aged' cookies.

I decided to make these cookies on a whim, and don't understand what all the fuss is about! I, personally, found them difficult to make, and frustrating to "fill" using the fruit preserves. They were messy, and the taste certainly didn't make them worth the effort.

Rating: 2
I can't figure out if my taste is just really different from everyone else's, or if I did something wrong. We tasted these each day and by the 3rd day they were still the same - sandy texture, cloyingly sweet and crumbly-not-quite-melty. They are good, but not even close to the best cookies ever. I ended up with double the # as the recipe says it will make. I used a "power berry" all-fruit spread and dipped each cookie halfway in so we didn't make sandwiches. I used a deep teaspoon so maybe that affected the texture/chemistry of it? I think I'll try it again (halved) with a more shallow spoon. Again, they're good and I want to give it another shot to see what everyone is talking about... 100 reviewers can't be wrong!

Never refrigerate the dough. Also, if it's not forming into a ball, I found that a little bourbon does the trick! Plus, it adds another dimension to the cookies. As with almost everything in life, patience is virtue, the longer you wait the better the cookies taste.

Superlative! Elegant, sophisticated. A family favorite. Well worth the effort. The original article in Gourmet is an enjoyable read as well as serving as an excellent tutorial on how to properly brown butter  it will require your undivided attention but is key to their success. We are divided into teams: those that insist on consuming them immediately and those willing to wait a few days. Both sides are right! And both sides agree that these gems do not lose their allure even after being hidden in the freezer for a month. Highly recommended, sincerely, Dorina

Divine. You don't understand how so until you make these. It's worth the time and effort. Cooking the butter properly is key to this recipe. It will fill your house with the most amazing aroma. It is rather cruel to have to wait a few days before eating them but it's definitely part of the process!

You have to like butter, and if you do, they're heaven. I didn't bother with the preserves or sandwiching, they're beautiful and delicious on their own. My husband thought they were just okay, but I'm trying to figure out when I can make them again. Sadly, I overcooked one tray of them (oven's on the fritz), but my son tried one of the "burned" ones and said it was the best cookie he'd ever had. Which in this house is saying something since there are cookies a lot!

I've had this recipe saved since it was published 3 years ago and I finally had an opportunity to make these today. I intended to give these away but I am keeping them all for only a few close friends. These are devine. The texture is wonderful. They just melt in your mouth (and your hands while you are putting the jam on them). I used a sugar shell spoon, so mine came out bigger than they should have and I only got 18 sandwiches. It's important to use a stainless steel pot because I only have hard anondized pots and it was hard to tell when the butter was browned. I used the description in the article as a guide to browning the butter because the explanation of the foam and clouds was very helpful. Enjoy!

These are really unusual, but delicious. Made them 2 days in advance of Thanksgiving without a trial run, but was very pleased with the result. I also cut the cookies from logs of dough for ease, but recommend that the cookies be cut relatively thin. Otherwise the "sandwich" becomes too thick to eat easily. I thought they were better as halves. As recommended I used cherry preserves. A bit more sophisticated than your standard cookie.

These are excellent cookies that appeal to most people, even those who don't like shortbread. The first time, I made them in spoons as suggested, but the process was slow and tedious, and I found the cookies a bit too big given their richness, especially for sandwiches, where the jam favor was lost. Now I shape the dough into 3 very small logs, leave them overnight in fridge, then slice and bake tiny coins. This is much easier, the bite size is perfect for the rich sandwiches (you can always eat several!), and the jam flavor comes through. In spite of the author recommendations, I have never found these to benefit from sitting- although they do age gracefully- and I agree with other reviewers that tart raspberry jam makes the best filling. But I also really like the cookies plain!

Delicious and unusual. Lots of fun to make. Followed directions without any adjustments. Perfect as is.

The texture of this cookie does change in two days or more but the flavor does not  we ate some right after baking, after one day and after two days. Its more like a pecan sandie the first day then it gets softer and less crumbly. They are delicious on any day. I made it with blackberry jam and thought they were great as did everyone who tried them. If you dont want to ruin your pot by sticking it in cold water after its been heated just transfer the butter to a bowl set over cold water. We tried to shape them using spoons but gave up  we used a small scoop and flattened them a bit. I will definitely be making these again soon.

Easily the best cookies I've ever made... friends were raving about them. It's especially important to be patient with the butter - the flecks on the bottom of the butter add the best nutty flavor!!

Rating: 4
Everytime I make these cookies, someone asks "What are those cookies? They're amazing." I found that you are really better off making the cookies without refrigerating the dough because it becomes more difficult to work with after it has been refrigerated, you never get the right consistency back. Just let them rest and then press them into a spoon. Using a piece of plastic wrap to press them in hard really helps. Then just slip them out by sliding the dough forward off the spoon. A plastic spoon also seems to help. I have tried a few different preseerves but seedless raspberry seems to taste best- -a little tart and you don't need to strain it.

Like others before me, I am not sure what I did to keep these cookies from turning out right. When all the ingredients were mixed together, the dough was like sand. I put it in a bowl to chill, hoping some alchemy would turn it into something manageable, but alas, when I took it out of the refrigerator the next morning, it was cold sand. Not being willing to struggle with an intractable material, I added some heavy cream to the mixture and blended it in to make the dough workable. I baked it as you would shortbread, scoring it into triangles and sprinkling it with sugar. When it came out of the oven, it looked beautiful. The dough had turned a nutty shade and the sugar was crusted and glistening. Upon tasting, a day later, however, I deemed this recipe a failure, at least for me. It was acceptable, but not sublime. I realize I might have upset the chemistry by adding the cream, though. I have tasted brown butter icing so I knew a brown butter cookie dough had great potential. If someone manages to make these turn out as they were intended to, I would like to suggest that she sandwich the cookies with brown butter icing instead of jam. It seems to me that that would be heaven.

Rating: 2
I'm trying to figure out just what I did wrong with these. I followed the recipe exactly except I had to chill the dough before baking. I brought it back up to room temp and cut slices from the log. When I tried taking them off of the cookie sheet they crumbled as much or more than they did before baking them. The flavor is good, and they would be wonderful dipped in chocolate or filled with jam. If I could only actually pick them up without getting a handful of crumbs they would be great! I will try again, but would be interested to know if anyone else had this problem?

These are some of the best holiday cookies, ever. I use plum jam, that I make over the summer - no seeds to worry about. I also find that making the spoon-shaped cookies can be a bit tedious. Instead, I roll my dough into a log and slice. It saves quite a bit of time.

in response to the last review...DONT add more flour .... if it is "soupy" your butter might be too hot when you are mixing it all in. Try waiting until the butter is completely cool before adding the flour.... Good luck!

Rating: 2
I tried these today, had no problems browning the butter, but the dough wasquite soupy, ao I added @ another half cup of flour; allowed them to rest in refrigerator a couple of hours before making them. They taste great -- I used raspberry jam, and agree that you need a tart flavor to counterpoint the butter. Howerver, they are awfully soft and mushy, and I thought (based on the article) that the dough would be more crumbly at the forming stage, and that they would be come out of the oven a little crisp(?) They refused to color much in the oven, even when I raised the temp to 350F. I'll try them again, perhaps with more flour.

Rating: 4
These cookies have a lovely flavor that is not run of the mill. Cooking the butter is both a fun process and makes for a really great taste. I doubled the preserves and found that once the cookie was together it still wasn't enough, as the cookie seemed to absorb the preserves. I used a high quality pear preserve; but it was lost. Next time I will use a stronger flavor or I will half dip individual cookies in a high quality dark chocolate. I also found that shaping the cookies in the spoon was easy, just smoosh the crumbs down and nicely shaped cookies will slide off withoout a problem.

I love these. First time I did the spoon thing, but was dissatisfied with the resulting shapes- a little irregular around the edges, plus tedious to do. Now, I roll out the dough and cut with a 1 1/4inch diameter rim shot glass. SO much easier, faster and produces more little sandwiches. They are very sweet to look at too. A good noshing size. I made them about 1/8 inch thick, baking time was ok as written 11 mins or so. I watched closely, used a silpat.. Came out great.

Rating: 4
These were great despite having cheated completely. First of all, I used margarine melted in the micro and I didn't fill my sink with water. The dough didn't "develop" for more than 30 minutes. I tried shaping with a spoon but it got annoying so I formed small balls and flattened them. Aside from that, it was the same. Bottom line is that they were great. Better the second day than the first but no discernible difference on the 3rd day (there was only one cookie left at that point). I would imagine that if made exactly as written they'd be even better, but even as it is I'd make them again for sure.

I made these as part of my 2006 Christmas cookie gift boxes and they are my favorite holiday cookie I have ever made. I've passed the recipe on to at least 10 people (all of whom requested/demanded it) and I made two additional batches. I used a high end seedless raspberry jam and I think the cookies would also pair really nicely with an apricot/peach or a cherry jam. The butter browning process goes exactly as described in the directions (I had never attempted the process before) and the dough really does improve with age... I made my dough on a Wednesday evening and baked it on a Sunday after reading the reviews. I only wish that a batch would yield more cookies as I only got about 14 sandwiches and I wanted to keep more for myself!

We've made these for the past two years and they've become a favorite among family & friends. We've experimented and found that really there's no discernible difference between dough that's allowed to sit, per the recipe, or dough used shortly after being made. There is a difference though if you let the cookies cook too long. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to try the rolling / cutting idea to save time, but she loves the clam-shell shape too much!

These were delicious (note the word *were*). I have to thank the reviewer that suggested rolling them out. I did exactly that and used a silver dollar sized biscuit cutter. It was so much easier and made the cookies more manageable. I used strawberry preserves and added a couple of tablespoons of Grand Marnier while it heated. It was perfect!

My friends, Thia and Anna bossed me into making these cookies! I'm so glad they did. They are incredible! I did as one reviewer suggested and (gently) rolled some of the dough and cut into small circles to make a sandwich. They were easier to eat, but not as cute.

Wow! The browned butter provides a wonderfully rich, complex flavor. I used a 4-quart Le Creuset pot to brown 1 pound of butter. I also used raspberry jam - the slight tartness complements the cookie very nicely. Note that the quality of the jam makes a difference so splurge a bit! I tried several teaspoons before finding a smallish one that worked well and yielded a few more than 3 dozen cookies per batch. The tedious part is shaping the cookies. I let the dough sit overnight in a cool basement. Didn't have trouble working with it - just press hard to ensure it holds together. A keeper! The entire family loves this one! I'm also using them for gifts - a dozen packaged in a simple cello bag with the intriguing article and recipe attached.

Rating: 3
These are simple, lovely little cookies. The browned butter makes them subtly more flavorful than standard buttery-crumbly Christmas cookies. A bit of raspberry jam sandwiched in the center adds nice fruitiness and tang. Bittersweet chocolate could also be good. And I wouldn't hesitate to add some finely chopped toasted pecans either way. The possibilities are happy and numerous!

I don't understand what everyone's raving about. I made the cookies exactly according to the directions. They taste like ordinary butter cookies.

This is my second year making these cookies and despite a recommendation in a cooking group last year that I make a roll and cut (then sandwich), I spooned out a tripled batch this year (and think I have a repetitive stress injury now). As much as I wanted the dough to sit for 10-12 hours to give me time, it was MUCH easier to spoon out the dough that I let sit for just an hour or two. I use Bonne Maman cherry and strawberry mixed and it's great. I LOVE these cookies!

If you can find Bonne Maman jam in your supermarket, their "Four Fruits" preserve -- raspberry, strawberry, cherry and red currant -- is ideal for this cookie.

Made these again this year. Experimented with rolling little balls then making a divet for the jam (good) and also in rolling out the dough and cutting into small rounds, then creating sandwiches with those. Both work well, but the rolling and cutting worked best, and made the prettiest cookie. I've already had people asking me when I'll have cookies for them this year. this recipe is definately a keeper.

i made these twice, and cannot think of a cookie that i've liked better. They get better with time, it is true. by the third day they will MELT in your mouth!!! My co-workers devoured them, and want more. I used a shell shaped sugar serving spoon, slightly smaller than a teaspoon, and it worked well. Also, the first time i made them, i used the jam, I thought they were too bulky, so the next time i didn't use jam and servrd them alone (not sandwiched) i like them better alone!

Would I make this again? YES YES YES!!! I have and will continue to for a long time. I am getting more and more daring with browing the butter, and I encourage everyone to wait as long as you can.

The best foods are the ones that taste better after 3 days. These really aren't that much work if you do only one batch. Also, I liked them better without the jam- I felt that the jam distracted from the sublime taste of the browned butter. So it's also going to be less work if you don't have to do all of that sandwiching. However, if you do want jam, use a pastry bag or a ziploc bag with a corner snipped off to expedite this process.

I used a tablespoon and baked them for a few minutes more. Greater cookie to jam ratio, but good for the impatient and still very presentable. My sister offered, "Tastes like cookie dough!" and she was right. The cookies were tender but with crystalline crunches, like the sugar in raw cookie dough. I added nutmeg to the flour, since while gilding the lily why not add some sequins, etc., and found them rich, rich, rich. Perfect for certain appetites.

These are excellent cookies. I made them *exactly* as written, no subsitutions. The recipe is simple to follow; the only part that's labor-intensive is shaping them with spoons. Even as you're pressing the dough into the spoon, it may crumble. Just keep pressing, and you'll get them to stay together. I may do as other cooks have suggested and try a simpler shape. Regarding the jam, it's a small component of the cookie's deep, complex flavor. The flavor and texture really do need a couple of days to develop, so be patient. And keep your expectations realistic. These may be similar to shortbread or pecan sandies, but they have a more sophisticated flavor than either. You could make them sweet and gooey with more jam, but that really isn't the point of these cookies. One more thing. A lot of people have had differing yields from a single batch. I got 26 cookies out of mine. Since spoons vary in size, it makes sense that the cookies will too.

Rating: 3
I gave this recipe three forks because the brown butter cookies on their own were wonderful. However, they were way too big, and you couldn't even taste the jam in the middle. I will make them again, except I think I going to use a smaller spoon, even if I have to change the shape. It may also help to add more jam. Good potential, but the recipe needs some tinkering.

Rating: 4
I made these for my Christmas gift boxes. They are very good, and the aging time makes them extra buttery and good. However, I thought the jam flavor is pretty much completely lost in the sandwich cookie, so next time would try to make them thinner. Overall, an excellent cookie, though. I made these exactly per the recipe.

I made these to give to friends at work and in our neighborhood and received the most incredible response. My son says they are the best cookies he has ever had and he's 24!

These are every bit as good as described! For variation, I dipped the flat side of two "spoons" into melted bittersweet chocolate, sandwiched them together and rolled the edges (where the chocolate had slightly squished out) in toasted hazelnut meal.

This is the most amazing cookie recipe. I have made them several times and they disappear from any dessert table. YUM!@!!! Just don't burn the butter!!!!

I made these the first time since I considered the article to be a challenge, and I love them, as does everyone I've given them to - I'm starting to believe her in rankings, though they aren't as arduous as she makes them sound. I've made two double batches and a quadruple batch in the past two weeks - used a 5qt dutch oven to brown the butter. I make them on parchment paper, so that I can continue to shape them when they're in the oven; slide the parchment onto the counter to finish cooling after ~ 5 min, then slide the filled parchment on the cooled counter. Shaping isn't so bad if you get in a zone - slightly warming the dough does help. I've found that they are forgiving if shape isn't perfect.

very good, however spooning took some time and didn't keep their shape. Towards the end I started rolling into small balls which made a cuter and more manageable cookie. Surprisingly, the cookies without the jam tastes like "pecan sandies" - I'm onto the fig swirls...

The dough is incredibly easy to make. The first time I made it, I didn't know how quickly the butter would brown once it starts to turn. The butter was a little too brown, the strawberry preserves too sweet, and the cookies tasted way too buttery and sugary. The second time I made it, the water had run out of the sink and I panicked, turned the water on to refill, and accidently poured water directly into the butter! What a steam cloud. I didn't throw the butter away, but made the cookies anyway and they were unbelievably good!! I used rasberry preserves to offset the sweetness of the cookie and it was melt in your mouth perfect. I think I'll pour water in the butter now every time I make these cookies.

Loved these little jewels. Only change that I made was that I used a small salsa spoon to shape the cookies. I like small cookies and the teaspoons made the sandwiches too large. Otherwise they are a marvel!

My new favorite cookie! Made exactly as written. Next time will try letting the dough rest for only an hour to see if it will be a little more malleable.

These are very tasty, but almost not worth the tedious process of shaping the dough. As a once a year cookie, I probably would make these again. I used raspberry preserves with these, which I thought was perfect.

These are buttery, crumbly and really outstanding! Decided to press the dough into micro-mini muffin pans based on reviews. The first batch I formed a 3/4" balls then pressed them firmly into each cavity. These needed lots of time to get deeply golden (look and taste best this way). These were delicious!!!! (I also pressed some into teeny tart pans--looked pretty too. The next batch I pressed only 1 teaspoon into the muffin tin. These were then made into sandwiches (flat sides *out*). I have yet to taste these.

Certainly a good cookie, but I wasn't amazed by them. Easy and fun to make, though. Most tedious part was molding the dough in spoons--should have just flattened out balls/ovals.

Absolutely superb! The browned butter flavor is really special. As another reviewer suggested, I reduced the amount of flour by maybe 1/4 cup - just added it until the dough was on the verge of being too crumbly. Even then, I had to warm the dough in my hand to get it to form into the spoon shape. A bit tedious, but WELL worth it!

I absolutely LOVE these cookies. The browned butter give a wonderful flavor. Forming the cookies is rather tedious, but I found that toward the end of the dough I had gotten much faster from practice. I followed measurements exactly but had to add more browned butter to make the dough cohere. This may be because my flour was particularly dry. I tried both raspberry preserves and strawberry preserves and liquified them in the microwave. The raspberry is far superior. The preserves were a little runny at first, but after about a day, the cookies had set and held together well. Don't make these if you are a person who is unable to delay gratification.

I made a batch of these last night, tasted the dough, and immediately made a second batch. These are easy (just keep a close eye on the butter and pull it off the stove when it reaches a dark amber color), and the flavor is out of this world. If I end up making a third batch, I might consider using a dash of cinnamon. Also, regarding other user's comments about the cookies being too crumbly, I held back a little less than 1/4 cup of flour, which seemed to make a real difference in their ability to hold up. A remarkable cookie, and this coming from a real cookie-phile.

I was surprised to read others comments about the number of cookies being less than expected. I read the recipe carefully, and everything seemed to go very smoothly. I actually came out with 42 cookies, one of which I just had to taste early. Now I'll wait to see how the other 41 taste in a couple days. The spoon stuffing was tedious, but for a once/year delicacy, I'd do that much again. I'm very curious about why it is that they should develop a better taste after a couple days. Maybe Harold McGee can tell us.

I loved this recipe...EASY EASY EASY...to put togeather....It is really importent to follow the directions when it comes to browning the butter..I dinna have the ice-water ready and my butter was quite dark....The cookie mixing was very very quick and easy. I measured everything down to the last ML (or OZ) after reading about all the cookie crumbles. I had no problems there...I did refridgrate it over night.....The whole spoon shaping was boring and I was thinking of getting my rolling pin out BUT..was afraid that the flour used in the rolling would make the crumbling start :( The jam I heated in Microwave for 27 secs ..no problems there they sandwich togeather nicely......I did eat one (or three) and they are rich and incredible...I can not wait until day two :) I am going to be making these again for sure..but I will see if I can not roll them out....

For someone that does not indulge in too many sweets except during the holiday season, I found this cookie to be extremely buttery, too much for my taste. I just finished making 1/2 a batch. Made 19 cookies. The recipe is actually simple for the most part, but turns tedious when spooning the dough into the teaspoons and transferring them onto the cookie sheet. If the cookies are still crumbling after having cooled, I would guess that they were not in the oven baking for enough time - if the sides are uneven and brown, probably overbaked by an extra 2 min or so. I will taste it in another couple of days and report back - don't know if I'd make this one again.

I followed this recipe carefully but found the cookies extremely crumbly. I couldn't spread the jam as they would simply fall apartin my hard. Does anyone have a suggestion for what I might have done wrong? I let them rest but didn't refrigerate...could that have helped? Perhaps the length of time baked...I tried 10 minutes and 12 minutes. Any help you can provide would be appreciated as they had a wonderful flavor.

I failed at these cookies. I didn't brown the butter properly and the dough turned otu so poorly that I just quit. I will try again once my baking confidence has recovered from my utter failure.

I used a deep spoon and the cookies look like little golf balls once asembled. The spoon is not necessary, next time I will roll one inch balls and flatten them slightly. Also, the preserves were too runny even after it cooled. I will try a smooth preserve next time without heating, or just a sprinkle of powered sugar. The taste however is rich and buttery. Will definitely keep this recipe.

An absolutely HEAVENLY cookie! Don't be scared off by the tales of difficulty. They weren't very hard to make at all. I used seedless raspberry jam. All I can say is YUM-MY!!!!!!!

The story intrigued me also. Will have to wait til tomorrow to see if cookies are as ethereal as promised, but initial taste has me hopeful. I also used an antique silver spoon for the deep bowl and make exactly 30 cookies.

Awesome! Loved the authors story so just had to try these. Found them very time consuming compared to roll-out and other cookie recipes. Couldn't resist trying one when came out of the oven before putting together - fantastic melt-in-your-mouth flavor! I used 1/2 cherry & strawberry preserves as author suggested but found a bit bitter, could be the preserves, so will try more strawberry with next batch. Mine made 32 sandwich cookies - used old silver teaspoon, typically smaller than newer stainless flatware which could be reason for more cookies. They don't look anything like the picture though, rough edges, and are a bit crumbly so will be interesting to see how they store in tins for giftgiving. But so yummie who cares! This is a very different christmas cookie recipe, one I'm going to share with all at my book group christmas cookie swap.

Not as tedious as the recipe suggests. Only had blueberry preserves when I first made these; too sweet without adding anything. The tartness of cherry preserves is a much better contrast.

MAKE THESE COOKIES. They are every bit as good as the article suggests, despite their humdrum look. My otherwise generous mother ferreted away my entire supply after a recent visit. Then on her drive back home, she called me in a total panic because she couldn't find them in her purse, and feared she'd left them behind (not to worry, they were lurking in the backseat). We now call them "Turn the Car Around" Cookies.

I absolutely love these. They are a step above really good shortbread. They do become melty and more flavorful after a couple of days. Way more sandy the first day, but still pretty good. I got about 26 cookies, but we ate a few plain. So I think the yield is probably accurate. I'd definitely make them again - it really is worth the trouble. I used cherry preserves, and the tartness was a nice complement to the sweetness of the cookie.

The first time I made these I made the mistake of using Plugra... great for shortbread but for these you actually want the extra milk solids which are what turn brown... still, the flavor is very subtle, the texture sandy and melty. The seond time I used plain old Land o' Lakes, and got a beautiful browned butter. Like the other reviewer, I did not get the same cookie count as the recipe - 25 at best. A lot of work, but a very interesting cookie.

yes, yes, yes I will make these again. They are great.

The recipe was easy to make. I ended up with only about 25 cookies (I guess mine were a little larger). The browned butter DOES give it a wonderful flavor - I tasted one today and will try to wait 2 more days before eating the others. I will definitely make these again! MMMMMmmm
