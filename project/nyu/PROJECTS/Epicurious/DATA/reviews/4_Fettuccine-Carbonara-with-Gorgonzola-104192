Decadent and absolutely perfect as-is. Was concerned about the heaviness of the cream & cheese but after reading the reviews decided to try it exactly as the recipe calls. Very glad I did. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed!

I tried this recipe last night and was amazed at how the flavours worked together. This is an awesome recipe which I'll definitely make again and again. The only change I made was to increase the bacon to 150 grams

Rich and flavorful, a total hit at the dinner party. Used the sauce over pasta for some of the guests and over spaghetti squash for my gluten-free friends. It was easy to do and received the most compliments of anything I made in my several course dinner. Definitely a keeper.

This was very good, but I found the gorgonzola a bit too much and probably won't make this again.

Rating: 4
The first time I made this I used jarred artichokes, which made the sauce taste slightly "off" due to the vinegar. The second time I made as directed, just without artichokes (I couldn't find frozen) and it was awesomely rich and SO EASY! The pepper kick can vary depending on how fresh the pepper, so I will probably cut back on that slightly next time. And there will definitely be a next time!

YUM.... But we just bought the red pepper flakes and they overpowered slightly wish I would have used less Will make again!!.

I rarely give 4 forks but this definitely deserved it. Exceptional dish and worth every calorie! Would also be good with chicken and diced onion

Definitely four forks. Rich, but absolutely awesome. Only substitution was blue cheese instead of Gorgonzola....it was great! My son made for Mother's Day meal...one of his first cooking experiments and it worked beautifully.

Talk about pasta Carbonara kicked up ten notches! This sauce is amazing & my family is still raving. I substituted regular fettuccine with organic whole wheat with flax fettuccine and used Cambozola instead of Gorganzola. It was outstanding! I didn't use the extra liquid as the recipe suggests. I don't think it needed to be thinned but may try next time for kicks.

I used fresh peas instead of artichokes, but other than that, I followed the recipe to-the-letter. It's excellent. The amount of gorgonzola is just right, making the sauce interesting but not overwhelming. It's also quick and easy enough to serve as a weeknight meal.

Made it without all the carbonara business, and was still delicious. Canned artichokes were fine, gorgonzola, and half the cream required...over fresh pasta I rolled out myself.

Rich, Delicious and Perfect. I've been making this since it was published in 2000. I make it with the ingredients that it calls for (and don't understand why people want to make substitutions before they even try a recipe and then, as a kicker, rate the recipe which is no longer the dish they made.) Anyway, we love this pasta because it is "rich, creamy, cheesy goodness" with artichokes for a healthy touch (right). I've even requested it for my birthday weekend instead of going out to my fav Italian restaurant. I recommend trying as is before making changes.

I used 8oz of Lima bean and 8oz of Button Mushrooms instead of artichoke hearts. This dish is very rich and heavy. It is a great winter dish.

Don't change this recipe unless you have tried it as written first! Trader Joes has frozen artichokes. I am not a slave to recipes but first try it as is!

Have been making this for years always to rave reviews. A very good quality gorgonzola is a must.

Rating: 3
I agree - YUM as is - a nice "twist" on carbonara - would serve as first course rather than main course as it is very rich and a small portion satisfies!

Rating: 3
Very good; however suggest using less olive oil, perhaps just enough to coat the pan. Also added peas (a whole bag which was a bit much) and caramelized onions (one). I did not need the last 1/2 cup of cheeses at the end.

Rating: 4
This recipe is a definite crowd pleaser. I cooked it with salmon and everyone loved it. It has a bit of a kick to it if you use fresh pepper, so halve the crushed red pepper if you don't like that. I agree with the previous chef as far as substitutions go. A traditional carbonara is just eggs, bacon, cream, and pepper, so there are already enough substitutions as is. If you don't like too much gorgonzola, lose the garnish and mix it all into the sauce. Delicious

the cook from ohio stated it best YUM your readers kill me they change everything in the reciepe and by the time thier done its nothing like what it was suppose to be if your going to add chicken and sun dried tonatoes then type that in the search bar, I cooked it just the way it was stated Yum next time maybe an extra clove or two of garlic

It was very good! My family loved it very much. I added shrimp, chicken, and sun dried tomatoes to it. I would definitely make this dish again.

I have never been one to describe any food as "too rich," but I think this might be my exception. It was delicious, but I think I'd decrease the amount of cream and half & half. I really like the gorgonzola flavor, so I'd add more of that.

Yum!

This dish was very rich and tasty. Didn't use the parsley and added more kosher salt. Might substitute peas next time.

Very good. Substituted peas for the artichoke which added a nice sweetness. Used less red pepper and added fresh rosemary.

I used Gorgonzola Dolce, added sun dried tomatoes (not packed in oil) and substituted busting loose basil for the poor parsley. Yum!

Rating: 4
With a sauce this creamy, I like to add something that is astringent to give a bit of contrast. The artichoke hearts are too bland. Try quartered green olives, not too many, but enough so that you get a bite every now and again. Capers may also work for this purpose.

Rating: 3
A great tasting carbonara! My special lady loves this dish, and I have already made it twice since the first time. The second time I put about half the amount of red pepper flakes, although I really think the amount the recipe calls for is good (go half if you dont like some spice) I think i'm going to try pineapple instead of artichokes next time. This is going to be one of my feature dishes when I want to wow the crowd. Ciao

I made this as written except I substituted sliced mushrooms for the artichokes, fat free half and half for the real stuff and 1/2 t. red pepper flakes. I also made homemade fettuccini because the recipe looked so good. It was well worth the time and effort!! This dish takes comfort food to a whole new level. To die for!!!

Rating: 4
This recipe is amazing. I have made it with several variations. I tried to cut the gorgonzola in half and use brie to replace it. Another time I used all the gorgonzola and replaced the bacon with a pound of shrimp. I always replace the artichokes with crimini mushrooms. This dish is great no matter what variations you make!

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting mushrooms for the artichokes. It was very good--about 3 and a half forks good. The only change next time would be to lessen the crushed red pepper to 3/4 tsp.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! You must make this - my husband was licking the plate. Like the reviewer from Hagerstown, MD, I also substituted mushrooms for artichokes (out of sheer necessity), but I think mushrooms complement the other flavors extremely well. Otherwise, I followed the dish to the letter. We only live 2 miles from Andiamo! and eat there quite often. It is a great cozy neighborhood restaurant with some first rate northern Italian food.

Rating: 3
I liked this recipe, but I felt it was too spicy for my taste. Next time I would probably reduce the red and black pepper to 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon each. Also, for those who don't like artichoke hearts, try substituting with frozen broccoli. That's what I did, and I thought it was great!

Rating: 4
This recipe was the best pasta dish my wife and I have ever had! After reading the other reviews I did cut back on the gorgonzola cheese (5-6 ounces rather than 1 1/2 cups) and I substituted prosciutto (sauteed briefly) for the bacon. Fantastic dish.

Rating: 4
In a word, AMAZING!! I read a previous rating and decided to substitute the artichoke hearts with mushrooms...the outcome was excellent. i also tossed in peas and some chicken breast which turned out great. My guests were very pleased and i plan to use this recipe for future events. Yummmm!

Got snowed in the other day and didn't have all the ingredients. Substituted low fat sour cream for the dairy products, left out the arts and the eggs and used 4 oz block of fresh goat cheese. some would say this isn't Carbobara but it was great.

Great!! Follow the gorgonzola by the 6oz. not the 1 1/2 cups and it is wonderful. Seems like a typo!

I found this to be too thick. I really does call for too much Gorgonzola. Seemed like too much pasta for not much bacon. I like Gorgonzola, but this was like I was just eating a block of cheese.

I made this for my Italian Grandmother's B-Day party. Even she was impressed!

Was a hit at with the guests. I added the mushrooms and would cut down on the atrichokes as thawed artichokes just don't taste that good.

Rating: 4
OK!!! I loved this. However,I had read previous reviews and was hesitant about the artichokes (I'm not a huge fan). I did everything in the recipe and listened to comments made by others. I did not put in artichokes but did add "Walnut encrusted chicken breast" (Cut into strips). I think this gave it the ummph it needed. I've always been a fan of the walnuts and gorgonzola combo. It did work, as was the general concencis of my guests!

Great!!! I made this twice, but the second time I used evaporated milk insted of the cream and the half and half to cut down on the fat and spinach instead of artichoke. It was still great, and with less guilt.

Rating: 4
Ohmigosh!! While this is not exactly healthy, it is for those special occasions. Our guests were soooo happy and satisfied with this delicious entree that I doubt we could have come up with anything that would have delighted them more. We all agreed that when you go out for dinner or to a lovely dinner party, you want something special that you wouldn't cook every night at home. This is THE ANSWER, full of fat and everything bad and absolutely heavenly!! I'll make it again for another group of friends next weekend!! And I'll use every bit of the gorgonzola listed in the recipe!!

Rating: 3
We both enjoyed this and went back for seconds, but there are several things I'd do differently next time. I was looking for something to make regular s.c. more intesting or complex, but really thought that the gorgonzola flavor here was far too overpowering. Next time, I'll use more parmesan, and less gorgonzola. I also agree that it lacked "something to bite into." Next time, I will use more artichoke hearts (I used 1 14 oz can; next time, I may use 2). Also, it was really too spicy, even for people who love spicy food, so I'll use a little less red pepper.

Rating: 3
It was good but really missing something to bit into. The artichokes lost all of their firmness. I might add spinach or mushrooms to it next time. Also, be sure the red pepper you use isn't too hot for your guests.

Rating: 3
I thought this dish was easy to prepare and very tasty, however, I felt that it was a little over-kill with the artichoke hearts. The next time I make it I probably will use either 1/3 or 1/2 of the artichokes in the recipe.

Rating: 4
I agree with earlier reviewers that this is the best pasta dish I've ever had. And don't be timid with the red pepper flakes, the pasta and eggs added at the end will tone down the heat.

Although we enjoyed the taste, couldn't handle it's richness. If you like cream sauces and cheese though, this ones definitely a winner! Tried it as the centerpiece to an italian themed dinner party which was already heavy on the cheese and was a bit overwhelmed.

What is the deal???? This is soooooooo gooooooood and soooooooooo comforting and who cares about the faaaaaaaaaaaaat? It's a dish to be served to your most intimate guests or for a snuggly candle lit dinner. It's not a pretty dish because the gorgonzola makes the sauce a green/gray color. Dim lights and candles took care of that....and the flavors did the rest. I would not serve this dish at a formal meal(because of the appearance) or to guests who don't have a sense of decadence. Otherwise.....cook, drink wine, and then enjoy the rest of the evening!!!!!!!

Rating: 3
Mmmm, this is by far one of the best pasta recipes I have ever had the pleasure to prepare. The gorgonzola is fantastic! A bowl of pasta has never disappeared so quickly. I used an herbed olive oil when preparing the sauce and it added tremendous flavor. This dish is not for those on a diet. However, for a decadent meal that is not too difficult to prepare it is perfect.

This recipe is wonderful! I made it for a dinner party and am making it again for Easter. It's a keeper.

A wonderfully rich and creamy dish. Deffinitely not for those of you worried about cholesteral, or those without a portable defibulator. There were 'oohs' and 'ahhhhs' reverberating around the dinning room (my favorite compliment) and only accented by a nice crusty loaf of garlic bread.

This carbonara is delicious! I'm not overly fond of cream sauces, but the flavors of this one are incredible. Surprisingly, it tasted even better when reheated the next day. I couldn't find frozen artichokes, so I used canned. This recipe is quick and easy.

This dish is heavenly! I served it as part of a buffet so I substituted penne for the fettuccine for easier serving. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, and the results were fabulous. It's very rich so a little goes a long way. Pure decadence!

This is a great carbonara recipe. . . in fact, I've never had a carbonara dish I really liked before this one. The blue cheese makes it taste more elegant, I think. Also, the bacon grease is not incorporated into the sauce, which makes it slightly less unhealthy than most carbonara. That's a stretch but. . . . . Anyway, try this. It is great.
