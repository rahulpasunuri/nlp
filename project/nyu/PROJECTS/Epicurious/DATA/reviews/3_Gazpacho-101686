Classic.

similar to this recipe, but slightly different: No parsley, used a teaspoon of cumin. No onion, but doubled the garlic... Delicious!

Great simple soup. I used Brandywine tomatoes instead of the plum for a sweeter, more tomatoe-y taste.

This is exactly how I remember gazpacho from Spain. I can't wait to make it again.

Of all the Epicurious recipes for Gazpacho, I like this one the best. Although not considered to be authentic, adding just a little tomato juice might be necessary considering that good tomatoes are hard to find in stores. This recipe calls for way too much garlic, at least cut in half. While visitng friends in Spain, they served gazpacho with slices of bread that were cooked in olove oil (heat oil over mod-high heat, brown bread slices, then cut into cubes) which was a very tasty addition. Also, I looked like a dope tourist in Sevilla when I requested a spoon with my order of Gazpacho (served in a goblet) and then realized after looking around that the Spanish DRINK gazpacho!

I liked the simplicity, and the balance of flavors although I found the onion a little overpowering and will use a smaller proportion next time. I also roasted the bell pepper. This gazpacho seems much more authentic to me than the ones that call for V-8 and worchestershire sauce! This doesn't need extra flavors, or pepper, or even salt, as long as you're using great ingredients (ripe, organic tomatoes are key).

Not being a great fan of Gazpacho I was mistrustful when Mum wanted to make this one. It turned out to be delicious. A deceptively simple recipe, a little spicy (the raw garlic did it) and incredibly filling for such a light veggo meal.

Maybe it's just me, but bread doesn't seem necessary. I added basil, more veggies, white pepper, tomato,and habanero to spice it up.

Can tell you haven't been to Spain. Your recipe lacks taste. Requires more veggies.

Needs more flavor, leave out the bread, add basil, beef broth, peel tomatoes, salt, white pepper and perhaps a dash of Maggi Seasoning and couple drops of tobasco, also can use tomato juice for more volume. I just prefer my personal recipe.
