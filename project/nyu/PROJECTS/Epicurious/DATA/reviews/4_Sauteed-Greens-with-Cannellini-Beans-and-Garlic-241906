My husband and I felt like something was missing from this recipe. We used Italian greens. I would make it again, but I would experiment with the recipe.

Works well as a side with many different types of fish. Will experiment with various greens but spinach works well.

Wonderful recipe. I added a splash extra broth and served over cooked quinoa, it was very tasty and healthy! Such a flavorful dish.

Wow I just finished making this recipe. I didn't have any sherry so I used a lemon vinegar. I used just a sprinkle of the red pepper. My husband thought is was amazing. He thought it was better than what we had at a restaurant recently. Excellent!!

Amaze. Used bok choy with great success. Upped the garlic and cooked the stems first before adding the beans and the leaves. Finished the broth with a bit of butter instead of oo and white wine vinegar instead of sherry vinegar. The vinegar cuts the bitter aftertaste of some of the more potent greens. Splendid alongside roasted curry cauliflower!

I made this with kale that I bought at the farmer's market. It was so easy and fresh and delicious. I followed the recipe as stated with one exception - I only used 2 TBP of olive oil, which I thought was plenty. 5 would have been way too much. I forgot the sherry at the end! Even so, this was so tasty and I feel like I have just done my body good!! Served it as a side with grilled salmon. The beans really make the dish.

I made this without the cannellini beans because I didn't have any and realized afterwards that I used white wine vinegar instead of sherry wine (whoops). I was expecting a rather bland dish and put out the salt and pepper - surprisingly enough, it needed nothing. The kale was delicious and my vegetable-averse boyfriend asked for seconds.

Made this with beet greens and cooked up the cannellini beans from dry. Superb. I am not a big white bean guy, but the flavor here had me scarfing them.

This was not nearly as exciting as I thought it would be - and I added sausage! Maybe it was the greens I chose - escarole - it was a little too crunchy. Next time I might cook it longer or use a different variety of greens. Something was just lacking...

Really great, simple recipe for winter greens. (We get bags of mixed greens from our CSA: kale, chard, spinach, mustard greens). Made it with extra broth and brown rice, and I used black beans instead of cannellini because it's what I had on hand, and I just realized I forgot the vinegar at the end. In any case, it was tasty.

I made this but I used chickpeas, added crushed almonds, and served it over quinoa. So not really the same thing but a similar idea, very healthy and hearty dinner.

Rating: 3
My changes are: add a sauteed onion, use a bit more garlic, and use two cans of beans instead of one. I use a ton more broth (maybe six cups), and sometimes add in some small pasta. For a little extra flavor (unless you're a vegetarian), cook up some bacon first, then cook the onion and garlic in the bacon fat instead of olive oil. Gives the entire thing a bit of smoky flavor. If you want, crumble the bacon in each bowl when you serve. Of course, this recipe stands on its own too!

Yum! Easy! I used kale and champagne white wine vinegar, and served it over brown rice (that I cooked with some butter). It is so healthy and delicious. I'll make this again and again. Great leftovers too!

I I used the precut greens by Glory Foods and that shortened my prep time. I was cooking for a larger group so I used two cans of cannellini beans and 1 & 1/2 bags of mustard greens. I love garlic so I used 6 cloves. I used only 1 cup of broth even though I was using more greens & beans. It was plenty of broth so I would suggest just playing that part by ear. And I only had distilled white vinegar but it was perfect. This dish is absolutely yummy!

Oh man. I did the farmer's market kale thing too and it was exceptional. Kale takes a bit of time to wilt down, but it would be a great side for a meat dish. The amount of cayenne was just perfect. My only change was I used white balsamic vinegar.

Rating: 3
Delicious way to use the beautiful kale from the farmers market at the moment. I used canned butter beans, as thats what I had on hand. They were lovely in this dish. We topped it with a bit of mozzarella and ate it with some crusty bread. Perfect early fall meal. Yum!

Personally, I prefer to use Sherry (yes Harvey's Bristol Cream Sherry) in greens and beans, it imparts a wonderful flavor!

Fabulous, flavorful and so healthy! I sauteed some chopped pancetta along with the garlic first which really added a nice texture and flavor to the dish. I would definitely add more garlic next time, but I am a big fan of garlic.

I'll be making this one for company--it would be great as a tapa alongside some other different things. I tried it two ways; first, with a splash of sherry vinegar and a bit of smoked spanish paprika; and also with a dash of Liquid Smoke, plus some crumbled feta. Very good in different ways. Careful with the sherry vinegar--a little goes a long way with acidity. Gives that Spanish flavor, though.

This was terrific. The garlic melts in your mouth, perfect amount of spice (crushed red peppers). The only change I will make next time is to add more greens and less beans.

Excellent, versatile recipe- 3 1/2 forks. I used kale as my green, which gave just the right amount of bite. I cooked israeli couscous in broth and mixed it in at the end (with a little lemon) to make a complete meal. I served the dish with parmesan cheese, but then, I serve most things with parmesan cheese.

To be completely fair, this reminded me of something a college student (who can't cook) would eat. It's healthy, it's easy, it's cheap. But it doesn't taste good at all. It just tastes like a can of beans and some sauteed spinach. The texture is pretty gross, too.

This is an outstanding recipe. It is healthy, delicious, and very easy to make. It's one of those dishes that just makes you feel good! I used organic baby spinach leaves and it was a huge hit.

Very simple side dish that tastes incredible. I make it with spinach, and substitute cider vinegar and a dash of cooking sherry for the sherry vinegar (which I haven't been able to find). Cooks up in minutes and is gobbled up in seconds at the dinner table.

Rating: 4
Gave this four forks for its simplicity to deliciousness ratio--easy to prepare and so yummy. I've made it a couple of times now with kale, veggie bouillon, and red wine vinegar or lemon juice instead of the sherry vinegar to finish. I prefer the heartiness of kale but for those who want to use spinach, just reduce the broth considerably (1/4 cup?)--and you won't need more than a couple of minutes to wilt the greens and heat the beans through (if you're using canned, which I did). Enjoy!

Rating: 4
This recipe is outstanding! It's economical, quick, easy to prepare, nutritious and delicious. You can't hope for more than that! I altered the recipe slightly by adjusting quantities. The garlic cloves I used were huge, so they were probably more like six cloves instead of three. I used one bunch of broccoli rabe (rapini) and two 15oz cans of cannellini beans which I drained, but did not rinse. I upped the crushed red pepper flakes to a little more than a half teaspoon. I had a little more than half a can of concentrated beef broth (Campbell's) left over from dinner last night, so I added water to fill the can and used it all. I cooked the entire recipe on high heat which boiled off most of what some reviewers have thought was too much liquid. I didn't have any sherry wine vinegar, so used red wine vinegar instead. I made this recipe for lunch today and quite frankly, I had to control myself from not eating the entire pot. It just tasted soooo good to me. I can't wait to prepare this for friends and family. Most definitely a keeper!

This is such a fantastic basic recipe to start with. I always add banana peppers to mine. Vary the cooking time according to the hardiness of the greens. Love it with more broth and pasta as a dinner. Sausage is delicious also, I add sundried toms in winter and grape toms at other times of the year. It is just one of the most satisfying meals I know of and so quick.

Really good! I started w/ 4 slices of turkey bacon & once those were done I placed on paper towels to drain, then started the rest of the recipe in the same pan.

I just bought some of this at a deli & now I see it here for today. The deli made it with escarole. There's had a lot of liquid to it also, but it was very good as the liquid absorbed into the rice. This can actually be a soup if you add lots of liquid and a little bit of meat, like pork, for a caldo gallego, potato, and then a heavier green is good, like kale or collard greens. To remove the thick stem one folds it, rolls it up and then cuts the stem off. I think for the side dish version with less liquid and less cooking then a thinner green works better like spinach

Funny how gross spinach seemed when you were little, all slimy and stuff. How taste changes and this is sooo good. We added pecorino romano ribbons. A small slice of lemon not only looks pretty with it, but a little squeeze is really good as well. It is becoming a regular at our home.

I following previous suggestions to halve the broth, up the garlic, and double the vinegar - all spot on, so thanks for that. I served this over quinoa that I had mixed with the juice and zest of a lemon and frankly, I think that's what made this dish. The lemon added some much needed freshness and I think I will always serve the dish that way. I made this with kale and found that much more than 10 minutes was needed to get it to the right doneness. This was my first time preparing kale and so I really didn't budget the right amount of time and our dinner was pretty delayed because of that. But, live and learn - overall, a very good, hearty, inexpensive, and extremely healthy dish that I will definitely make again.

My husband and I had never tried kale until we received a bunch in our share from the CSA. Glad I read the other reviews and cut the broth to 1/2 cup. I used 2 teaspoons of the Sherry wine vinegar. The only thing I added after the drizzle of olive oil was a sprinkle of pink finishing salt. Fabulous. Had great taste, served as a main dish over steamed brown rice.

I used kale and halved the broth and that seemed to be a good ratio. Served it over brown rice. The flavor left something to be desired. If I make it again I would add more vinegar and spice -- as written it just tasted like an example of why people are scared of "healthy" food.

This dish was FABULOUS!! My husband had 3 helpings. I deviated a wee bit from the recipe. I used heirloom butterscotch beans in place of cannelini, I doubled the garlic and was heavy handed with the crushed red pepper. I served it over whole wheat fusilli. Magnifico!!! And a great way to use up an over abundant supply of greens.

I found this to be a little bitter. Was it the brocolli rabe I used? Or the balsamic vinegar? Any input would be great.

Made this with broccoli rabe. It was good, maybe not the_most_flavorful incarnation of itself it could be, but a recipe that's definitely worth keeping and fiddling with in terms of seasonings, garlic, etc. If nothing else, it's the kind of nutritional knockout recipe we're always trying to achieve.

My boyfriend and I both love this recipe! It's relatively easy, and so tasty. It has just enough spice from the red pepper to give it a zing, and can be adjusted to your liking. It does take a lot longer than this recipe says for the chicken stock to be absorbed. It more or less just cooks down and reduces in about 10-15mind. I just let it simmer with no lid on the whole time. I've made this with both spinich and kale. I was partial to spinich, but it really just depends on which flavor you prefer.

Terrific. I made it with broccoli raab, followed advice here and cut the broth by half, and served while still vividly green and just tender.

Rating: 4
I took the advice from the other reviewer and used much less chicken stock. Since I was serving it with Soy Cumin Chicken (also an epi recipe) I omitted the beans and used rice wine vinegar instead of the sherry vinegar. I used about the same amount of greens, but no more than 1/2 cup of stock, simmered covered for a few minutes until al dente, then I took the lid off and let the remaining liquid boil away. The short cooking time ensures a wonderful flavor and texture to the greens, which are often cooked way too long.

This dish has such a great flavor. I used kale for my greens and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and I served it over brown rice. The whole meal costs about $2.50 to make, and its so nutritious also. I might make baked tofu to go with it next time, but on its own this dish is very filling.

Wowser! Took the hint on 1/2 c. broth and any bean at hand. Used baby chard, baby beet greens, pea shoots and spinach from today's farmer's market. Sauteed a little bacon (and browned garlic in the drippings), toasted some pine nuts and cooked the tiny pearl sized beets and used as toppings. That plus Thai red rice made this really sing.

This is a very good, easy, and healthy dish. I make it often as a quick lunch for myself. I use spinach and butter beans, but any white bean would be good. I use far less oil than called for--I use only 1 tsp. for the whole recipe and it still is very, very good. I love the broth--yummy!!

Delicious! I used broccoli rabe, which cooks more quickly than kale. I used the full cup of broth and actually really enjoyed the soupiness--the broth took on amazing flavor from the garlic and vinegar (I used red wine rather than sherry).

This is a great recipe, even though I modified it a fair bit. I cut down on the oil, only used a couple of tablespoons of broth, omitted the red pepper and used red wine vinegar instead since that's what I had on hand.

I made this last night with swiss chard and it was great. Loved the garlic and red pepper flakes, really makes it sing. Could also use chickpeas or kidney beans instead.
