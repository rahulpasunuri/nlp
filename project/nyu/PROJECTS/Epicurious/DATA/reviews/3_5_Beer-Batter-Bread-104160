If you like Irish Soda Bread, this type of bread will be to your liking as well. It is very quick and good. I used Sam Adams Original and about 1/2 of the melted (salted) butter. Will make it again and try some variations as suggested in the reviews. Mine looked just like the picture, the top is crusty and bumpy looking. Also, I did use some of the butter to grease the loaf pan.

Loved the flavor and texture when made by a friend--not sure if it was the same recipe. But my batch had a horribly bitter aftertaste. We used Sam Adams Lager, so I'm going to try a richer, but less bitter beer. Probably use suggestions from other reviewers.

This is such a great recipe! So easy and yet it was the highlight of an otherwise elaborate dinner. I have tried it with Guinness with good results and then light beer which lacked flavor. Last night I made it with Pacifico and had an excellent beer flavor that was not overpowering!

Made this last night with Michelob Ultra, since that's what we were given as a thank-you gift. Haven't drank beer since first semester of college and it looks like I never will again, so this is the best use for it. Good jumping-off place for lots of variations. I would think an earthy dark beer would do better, but the Ultra didn't ruin it either. Lighten up on the butter - 3 Tbsp melted is plenty to cover the loaf pan and have lots left for drizzling on top. Makes a nice crust. Will put this recipe in my "fave" box.

Really good recipe! I used some not-so-good home brew, cut back on the sugar and butter, added some thyme. Delicious! About to make another loaf - I have a lot of bad home brew to use up!

Instead of using a pan, drop dough ball onto cookie sheet, then cut large "x" in top, and do an egg wash on the top for a nice crsip crust. You make an oblong shape, and get 2 batches on one sheet - share one with a neighbor,

I've made this with every kind of leftover beer (even Guiness) and it always is a hit. If you do happen to have any leftover bread, it makes awesome toast the next morning!

I love this recipe and make it all the time. Any time my meal could use a hearty bread on the side, this is my old standby. There are a couple modifications that I use though: the butter called for is way too much, you can easily cut it in half or better. Then, I always sprinkle the top of mine with fresh ground sea salt just before baking... That makes a huge difference. It gives the crust a delicious, buttery, salty flavor, almost like a soft pretzel. And finally, my most important piece of advice; USE DARK BEER. You wouldn't think it would make a difference, but it does. I tried making this with bud light once and it didn't even cook right (overdone outside, doughy inside) I think that may be because of too much water, not enough yeast in light beer. I typically use Guinness and it turns out great! By the way... This recipe is super easy! It's best eaten warm, but that's not a problem; it's usually gone long before it gets a chance to cool down!

This recipe was delicious. I added shredded cheese, garlic powder, and onion powder. I also mixed a tablespoon of beer in with the butter to spread over the bread batter before baking. I took 10 minutes off of the baking time. Over all it came out excellent. This will definitely be a regular at the dinner table. maybe I will replace flour with whole wheat flour.

This is a good fast bread. I made it with 1/3 whole wheat flour but found it a little bland and too sweet. Next time I'll add some nuts and seeds and reduce the sugar.

Simple and quick to prepare and a great way to use up old beer. We went to a pot luck picnic and someone put a few cans of beer in our cooler afterwards. We don't drink much beer and two summers later I decided to get rid of them. I have made this twice. Good, slightly sweet, and more of the texture of a sweet bread (moist and dense). To avoid the sticking to the pan others have mentioned, the only change I made in the recipe was to spray the pan with Pam and only use slightly less than a tablespoon of melted butter on the top. The loaf turned out of the pan easily. I will make this at least three more times (that's how many cans of beer I have left). It makes good toast and would probably be a good bread with soup or stew.

Wonderful flavor; easy to make; you'll make it again and again. I used Moulson's Golden for the beer, which seemed to impart a just-right nuttiness.

Used a pilsner, disappointingly couldn't taste the beer at all. Other than that, it's a fine and easy quick bread if you like quick bread.

I made this with magic hat #9 and added a sauteed onion and some grated cheddar. The result was a dense but moist loaf, distinctively "beery" in a good way. The onion was a really nice touch but I might decrease the sugar next time if I add it again. This will be a fun recipe to play with. I'd like it to be a little lighter, maybe a more carbonated beer.

Rating: 4
Great versatile recipe. My only suggestion is to use 1/3 of the melted butter to coat the bottom and sides of the pan so the bread doesn't stick. First loaf I made at Thanksgiving, the entire bottom stuck to the pan. Second time around, I made a couple of nights ago, I made sure to coat the pan and, it pretty much did the trick (just one tiny spot stuck). Maybe I need new pans? :)

Rating: 4
This is a home run recipe and so easy to make that I kept thinking I'd forgotten to do something! Tried it with Molson's Golden, which added a rich yeasty beer flavor without being in your face. Tip: cool the bread one hour, then slice off a piece while it's still a bit warm---stellar! One slight modification: did not put quite all of the 1/4 cup of melted butter on the top.

I used 3 cups self rising flour, Newcastle and a touch of honey. Nothing else and it was perfect. Too bad I spent so much time on everything else, this was all everybody talked about.

This is a very easy recipe, and quick in terms of prep time. It goes well with soup, and if you don't have the time to make a traditional loaf of bread with all the risings, etc., this fills in well! I would use less sugar next time, however. It was almost like a dessert bread. I just used old bud light, but then, I'm no beer connoisseur.

Used very standard household stuff...regular all-purpose flour and Molson Golden made a great, versatile bread. I'll definitely make some variations, because there is such great opportunity to do so, but I'll also make this standard loaf time and time again. Fabulous!

I have made this bread several times, and based on other reviews, tried different variations. I used Bud Light once, and will never again. It left a bitter taste. Amstel Light was very good. Goose Island Honkers Ale provided a richer flavor. I tried sneaking in 1 cup of whole wheat flour a few times, but my family was not impressed. I also found that I needed to bake a little longer (45 minutes) to get a golden crust with a moist center. This is a great recipe because it is so easy to have really fresh, delicious, bread quickly.

Compared with the "no-knead bread" recipe popularized in the New York Times, this "Beer Batter Bread" is superior because (1) in less time, (2) with less effort, one achieves a product that is (3) richer in flavor, and (4) more easily manipulable in terms of flavor profile. Highly recommended.

Great basic recipe! I needed one to adapt to use hard cider instead of beer. I used some of the other suggestions and turned this recipe into a sweeter version that I am now calling Double Apple Cider Bread. I used 1 1/2c flour, 1c whole wheat flour, 1/2c oatmeal, 1T baiking powder, 1t salt, 1/2t baking soda, 1t cinnamon, 1/3c light brown sugar, 1/2c chopped dried apples, & 12oz bottle hard apple cider. Mixed the dry ingredients well to break up lumps, then added the cider and stirred just until blended & baked as 375 for 35-40 minutes. It made a great breakfast bread. Thanks for all the suggestions - keep the creativity flowing.

I made this bread with King Arthur "Whole Wheat White" flour, and a Paulaner non-alcoholic "Thomas-brau" that was just hanging around. The result tasted distinctly like pretzels, which we loved! It was just perfect slathered with some good dijon mustard (or any mustard, for that matter) I'll definitely be making this again!

Rating: 4
For the reviewers using Guinness- Guinness has a lot of nitrogen in it to provide a certain mouthfeel, and not a lot of CO2. You need to use a beer with only CO2 (which is most beers). The CO2 is what makes the dough rise. Reviewers using Guinness note a "brick" like consistency. Give this recipe another shot with a different brew!

Rating: 0
so i guess i didn't really understand the "mixing as little as possible" and one reviewer said that it's better to leave dry spots than to overmix, so needless to say, it didnt quite turn out... a few floury lumps that i had to rip out... i will make it again and mix it well. i used Pete's Wicked Strawberry Blonde, delicious.

Easy and fast, and tastes good. Subbed one cup of flour for whole wheat with no problem. Except one issue: the bread had a yummy, overall beer tang, except for the occasional bitter spot, like maybe one per slice. Any theories for this? Ooops...wait, just realized I used baking soda instead of baking powder. I guess that's it!

This was great! the only change I made was I decreased the sugar to 2T since 3 seemed like too much, and I brushed the inside of the pan with some of the melted butter since some reviewers said it stuck in the pan. I used Long Trail Ale and it had a subtle beer flavor. The texture is more dense than a yeast bread but by no means too dense. The dough looked like a shaggy pizza dough but came out wonderfully.

I was going to make cornbread to go with a stew, but found I was out of cornmeal. Since I needed something fast that required few ingredients, I decided to try this recipe. It turned out to be a very good accompaniment to the stew, and my husband loved it. Nice chewy texture, and the crust is wonderful. I used a cheap beer, and the very slight bitter taste added interest and softened quite nicely under some salted butter. I will be making this often.

Four stars for versatility alone. Try it with one of those orange coriander Belgian beers. Also great for open face grilled cheese sandwiches.

Did anyone think it should be made with 2 cups of flour instead of 3? I thought maybe it was a typo. 3 cups of flour made more of a dough than a batter.

Haven't made this version yet, but just wanted to comment to everyone that if you're having issues with bitterness, try another beer. Alton Brown of the Food Network recommends using lighter beers because darker ones do get bitter when cooked. I made a batch of beer bread last night with a Sierra Nevada, and it had a slightly bitter taste that was smoothed out nicely with some butter slathered on it. I think next time I might try an even lighter beer...

I didn't like this bread. Maybe it was the beer I used? I used a Sam Adams winter ale. The bread tasted slightly bitter, and had it not been for the cup of parm cheese I added, I wouldn't have liked it at all. It did come out just how it lookes in the picture though.

Wow, this was the quickest, easiest, tastiest bread I've ever baked. I chose Thomas Hooker India Pale Ale, which gave the bread slight bitter bite, complementing the sweetness of the sugar.

This is crazy easy and delicious. Just dump the beer in and barely mix it with your dry ingredients. The batter seems weird, but it will turn out great - very light.

made this twice yesterday however i made the bread into muffins instead of a loaf. The first time i used a dogfish ale and added some cheddar cheese it was soo soo a bit on the bitter side The second time i made it with corona and used less baking powder, added some cheese a drop of french's fried onions and some cayanne [sp?] pepper as well as some black pepper. This one came out amazing, split the muffin open while it was still warm and made a turkey sandwich. soooo good

I made this bread with a good quality barleywine, which is both stronger and sweeter than your average beer, and very flavourful. Twice, I baked the bread for potlucks. Twice, it was UTTERLY DEMOLISHED, to rave reviews. The second time, I accompanied it with a vintage cheddar, and it was a nice pairing. Seriously, this bread got me more compliments--from people who are true foodies--than almost anything else I've ever cooked. And I'm a GOOD cook. To the cook whose bread came out like a brick: that's something I've had happen to me when I overstir the batter for a quickbread. It really toughens it up. I would say that it's better that there be a few lumps and yes, even a few dry spots in the batter than that you overstir it. I was careful not to do so, and mine came out with a perfect texture. Probably the best quickbread I've ever made.

Mine turned out like a brick . It tasted like Guiness and that is not a bad thing ( for me) Not one of my family members liked it. Seems to need to rise more.

I made this today for the first time and everyone loved it! I mixed about a cup of shredded smoked mozarella cheese in with the dry ingredients before adding the beer.

I also omitted the butter on top and the crust still came out wonderfully crunchy. I will definitely make this again!

Just OK, though I'll probably make again with a lot of additions as it's so easy. Used an amber beer. As others have said, the crust was delicious, but the center a little too bland and heavy. Good broiled in slices with cheddar, though. Used a flexible silicon loaf pan which made removal easy.

Produces a somewhat dense, cakey loaf with a pale but slightly crunchy crust. I could definitely taste the beer, but it wasn't too strong,just lending a yeasty hops aroma. The loaf doesn't slice well, and tearing off generous chunks worked best in the end. It suits slatherings of butter, or cheese. I make mine with Heineken.

I make this bread often, it has become one of our staples. it's so easy to impress people with fresh warm bread at dinner! Delicious the next day toasted (in a toaster oven, not regular toaster, it breaks) I read all the reviews and have tried quite a few types of beer. You might want to play with the sugar amount if it seems too bitter but it kind of depends on the beer. Make sure to grease the pan first! it's not in the instructions, and usually the melted butter surrounds the batter but it can stick really bad.

Rating: 2
Like it don't love it compared to the old standby beer bread of using just 3 cups self rising flour, 3 tbsp sugar and 1 can room temp beer. beat, bake one hour at 350, butter the top. easier and just as delicious. maybe it's cheating using self rising flour, but it cuts out several steps. Use a good medium to strong beer. adding cheese is a fun touch, but my crew prefers it plain with beef stew !

I have had the "Tastefully Simple" beer bread and had a craving for it but I was out of it. I tried this recipe using 1 c. Whole Wheat flour & 2 c. All-purpose and it is great! Much less expensive as I believe it sells for $5.99. I may increase the sugar a bit as it was slightly bitter, or add a dash of splenda. I may try the muffin idea in the future, too.

I really liked this bread, but I do have a few comments. Do bake at 375, not 350 as the previous reviewer suggests. I used Henry Weinhard's and it was great. I also added 2 tbsp of gluten just to try it. I felt weird not mixing in the ingredients much, and then found the loaf to be crumbly to slice - it could be the gluten or maybe I'll just mix it more. But it seems like this might make good rolls instead of sliced bread, so I think I'll try that, and add some jalapenos maybe. It made excellent toast with marmelade, which I wasn't expecting but really worked!

After reading the reviews, I used 1/4 cup sugar and substituted self-rising flour for the flour, bpowder and salt. I used Budweiser and it was cold right out of the frig--the bread turned out terrific. Based on my old Southern lLiving recipe, I baked it for 45 minutes at 350degrees and then poured the butter over it and baked an additional 10 minutes. The bread was delicious! I had a group of boy 13 year olds over when it came out of the over and they devoured it. They gave it two thumbs up!

With such a simple recipe, you'd think I could make it right, but I forgot the salt! Don't forget the salt! It still works fine, tastes even better w/a little mustard, ham & cheese on it. I did add a little grated pepper jack & chili powder to the dry mix, but not enough to taste it, more next time. Grated a little parmesan on top & it gave it a nice crunch. May try a little more spice, cheese & maybe even some garlic. There are all kinds of ways to add to this bread. Will have to try this again & add salt the next time!

I found this recipe a bit too salty. I would cut down on the salt, or use an even simpler beer bread recipe (also very tasty): combine 3 cups bread flour, 1 bottle room temp beer (not flat), 3 tbsps sugar. Turn into loaf pan, drizzle butter on top if you want. Bake at 350 for 45 mins to an hour (until browned). Enjoy!

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe as above except I omitted the butter and baked it in a 9x9 cake pan rather than as a loaf (it took only 17 mins at 375). My boyfriend (who is trying to stay low-carb) loved it so much he ate over half the pan at dinner! I used a Hefeweizen Ale and it seemed to work great. Be sure to mix the batter as little as possible to keep the bread from getting too dense (and remember it will mix a bit more as you're scraping it out of the bowl). Best right out of the oven, and really tasty with jam!

After reading so many positive reviews, I'll have to try this again, maybe adding some sugar. I was thrilled to find this recipe since my grandpa's beer bread is a great memory and made it with a lager from a local microbrewery, and it smelled delicious in the oven, but I must have done something wrong since it was pretty bitter. Also the consistency was a little odd, way denser than I expected, but maybe that's just this bread.

made it 4 times in 3 days- just kept disappearing. wouldnt say its the best bread ever, but pleasing taste... began to tamper with the recipe and added about another two teaspoons. added sugar balanced the flavor- but caution- i was using egyptain beer which is notoriously bad... perhaps the bread doesnt need the sugar in the states... satisfying texture and weight though- great warm!

It didn't rise that high, but high enough, and my roommate and I both thought the texture was light and cakey...beer cake! Plus, the apt. smelled like being out at the ballpark. Next time, I'll try it using pumpkin ale for some college-style pumpkin bread. Cheers!

I wasn't that impressed with this and I RARELY give a recipe less than two forks. I just love food. I found that the bread didn't rise like New Haven, CT said it would. I was expecting it to rise a lot more. Perhaps it's my baking powder? It was the consistency of a dense banana bread. I used 2/3 whole wheat flour, perhaps that's why? Somehow I don't think so. Anyway, like all bread it tastes great toasted with jam and it's so easy to make so I will make it again. Another thing - after adding the beer it was the consistency of bread dough, not batter. I don't know how you would NOT mix it without getting everything even a little incorporated. I'll keep trying.........

I have made this bread with a lot of substitions, I have made it with whole wheat flour & all purpose flour, mixed, with varing amounts each time, depending on what I happen to have on hand, I have also used whole grain flour, mixed with whole wheat and all purpose flour, being careful not to add too much as it takes longer to cook, because it tends to be a more dense bread (which we all like) I have done many variations, all of which are very good. I have also have added different herbs (chives, parsley, oregano, or any herb that I have on hand) I have also added jalopeno or sweet red peppers...yum! I have experimented with many different types of beer. We tend to like the micro beers or darker beers the best, to drink and of coarse for the bread. I would be hard pressed to select which recipe that we liked best. I make this bread two to three times a week. It is definitely a keeper for this family. The one thing that I do each time that I make this bread is to butter and flour the pan first, that way the bread just slips out of the pan, no bits stuck in the bottom

i've made this bread twice now, both times because i was pressed for time and it seemed quick and easy. (which it is - almost ridiculously so.) but i do rather like this bread - it's dense and lightly sweet and altogether interesting. i say this because it rises high and fluffy in the pan, but its texture is by contrast quite dense and spongey, if that makes any sense. the butter added at the end gives it a lovely crust, too - i found myself ripping away it first before eating the rest, haha...

Fast & Easy! Tried a few variations so far and loved them all. If you want the bread less sweet, cut the sugar down to 1 tbsp. Can also add garlic powder/salt, fresh garlic, fresh/dried herbs, etc. to give it a different kick. Good, dense bread that goes well with soups, stews, etc.

So easy and great results! It took 3 minutes to prepare! I used a home brew wheat ale beer. Be sure to grease the pan too! The texture was nice and dense (great with stew or soup), but a little crumbly! I would make it again!

excellent texture - great taste (didn't notice the beer)! I found mixing this in the kitchen-aide mixer the key - that adds the air necessary for the texture. it's makes the best toast if it lasts until day two.

Yep, it pretty much tasted like beer. Don't know what I was expecting, after all it's called beer bread, and beer is the major ingredient... it makes perfect sense that it would taste exactly like a beer. My husband thought it was pretty good, but then he likes beer. So overall, I would have to say, if you don't like beer, you probably won't like this bread too much.

I made this with some homebrew American Weizenbeir and had excellent results on the first try. I cannot vouch for repeatability and reliability.

Three out of four of us liked this recipe... The bread was very dense, but had a nice crusty top. And SOOOOO easy to make! It is definitely better when hot, so try to serve it shortly after it comes out of the oven!

I found this bread tasty and extremely easy. I agree with using a cheep bottled beer. That will cut down on any aftertaste. My husband doesn't like beer but loved the bread. Even my four year old asked for seconds. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this bread twice and both times it left the worst aftertaste in my mouth. I will never make it again. It was not a hit in my household. The recipe leaves something to be desired. It tasted like solidified beer!

We didn't really care for the 1st batch, but it was a bit undercooked. I had to increase the cook time by 10 min over the maximum stated. I let the 2nd batch go to a dark golden brown, and liked the texture much better. I took it to a Thanksgiving gathering, and many went back for seconds. With all of the good food there, it speaks well for the bread that folks were compelled to have another slice! When we ate leftovers the next day, the flavors really came forward! Making it couldn't be any faster or easier.

A huge hit with all the guests and family on Thanksgiving. Wonderfully easy and quick to make. You could cut the amount of melted butter in half and still have a wonderful buttery flavor. Definitely use cheap beer, and in a bottle. First time with canned beer left a metalic after taste.

A hupge hit w/ my New York friends.Im origonally from Texas and I love it. Its so easy to play with. Maybe some cheese or peppers or corn bits. Can't go wrong.Try mixing it more for a less dense texture. Very versatile.

I made it with the Cheddar and Green Pepper Spread and it was delicious. A big hit with the family.

OH MY YUM YUM YUM. When you live in an environment like I do, there's never any yeast in the house, and there is ALWAYS beer. Although I do love a good kneaded yeast bread, this is so much easier (and so delicious) it might make making my own kneaded breads obsolete. Much tastier and easier than a bread machine too!

This is such an easy, no-fail bread. I made it last night with a Japanese beer and it was delicious. I added 4T wheat germ. It's even better toasted with butter. YUM!

I baked this in muffin tins. It is crusty, yeasty and delicious. Taken to a salmon supper it was a hit with the other guests. Grated sharp cheddar cheese would be a nice addition.

I loved this bread. It goes wondefully well with soup. I was a little worried about how lumpy it was but it turned out great. I did as other reviewers said and buttered my baking dish. It came out just fine. My company took a slice home and asked for the recipe.

I made something very similar from a different source... the recipe was 3 cups self rising flour, 3 tb sugar and one can of beer. It was VERY good, VERY easy and would go great with soup and a hearty salad for dinner. I love the suggestion to add fresh herbs... and I'm also thinking that finely chopped carmelized onion would be a great addition. I made it without any added fat (but greased the pan) and it was great. It would also be good for a stuffing recipe....

Delicious! I added a heaping tablespoon of dill, and I took the previous advice and greased my bread pan. This was a huge hit and I plan to make it often, perhaps adding different herbs and maybe some grated sharp cheddar.

This bread was delicious. I used a tiny bit of the butter to coat the pan and the bread just slipped out. It was equally good with cream cheese or olive oil, garlic, and Italian spices.

hard crust... flat flavor

Great tasting bread but I must have done something wrong. It stuck to the bottom of the pan something horrible and wasted part of the loaf. Next time, I'll add some of the butter to the batter and grease the pan before baking.

This is a great quick bread. I suggest putting some of the melted butter in the batter and pour some over the top. I sprinkled the top with sesame seeds... It's always a big hit in our home.

Really tasty and VERY easy! Chefs all say the cheaper the beer, the better the bread-so don't waste your microbrew on this!

This took all of about 5 minutes to mix.The "lumpy" batter worried me at first, but shouldn't have because the bread came out wonderfully! My husband especially liked the crunchy outside from the butter that was poured on before putting it in the oven. This is a definite recipe to have around during those shocking moments when you discover you have no bread in the house!

This bread is GREAT! So easy to put together. I used a medium ale and the flavor was light and delicious.
