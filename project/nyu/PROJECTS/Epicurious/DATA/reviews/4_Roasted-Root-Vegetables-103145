This dish has become a family favorite. I double the sweet potatoes, add chopped up leeks ( add green part after about 25-30 minutes of cooking)and add several pinches of cayenne pepper. Great, filling side dish!

I make this a lot every year. People who hate vegetables gobble it up and ask for the recipe. I've evolved to using white sweet potatoes instead of yams, only one fennel bulb, and add 2 large carrots. I also add a Tablespoon of honey to the broth. Have added sauteed polish sausage to completed dish and served as a main course to rave reviews.

I have made this many times over the years for family and guests and it is always a hit. The fennel and celery root are a nice change from more common vegetables in dishes like this.

Although I made some minor changes (didn't have fennel - added a little honey and water instead of broth) I doubt that it changed the recipe that much. This was absolutely wonderful. I think the secret is to make sure you cook it long enough. I just cooked and stirred every ten minutes. When it started to stick a little I added the honey water and scallions and cooked only 5 min more. 10 would be ok if you dont want the scallions tender/crisp. Probably most root veggies would work with this, but the celeriac (never had before) was a super part of the taste

I added turnips and skipped the broth and green onions, a delicious roast!

Substituted parsnips & carrots for the yams, cut down on the oil, and skipped the green onions and broth. Really delicious.. and the leftovers make great veggie cream cheese!

Nothing to rave about, but certainly nutritious. Served with pork tenderloin.

I've made this dish several times. Each time, I added something different to the basic recipe. Some ideas: parsnips cut into strips, carrots, sliced delicata squash, blue potatoes (sweet, but milder than the orange type), finely chopped rosemary, sprigs of thyme, leeks, rutabagas, etc... Any combination of these veggies yield fantastic results and is a great way to clear out the fridge and vegetable baskets.

We loved it and so did my kids! I also added carrots and a little bit of honey, abd the garlic was wonderful. I think that when the garlic is undercooked though they are nasty!

I thought I was in heaven when my husband pulled this out of the oven. The sweet garlic and yams were delightful. The fennel and celery root so tender. Sage - what a simple and delicious spice. We halved the recipe for the two of us and couldn't discipline ourselves to save any leftovers. We will definitely be making this again!

I have finally found a way to get toddlers to eat veggies. Everyone else loves them, too. But reviewer below: why would you roast and toss whole garlic cloves here IF YOU DON'T ENJOY EATING THEM? They're not going to turn into apples, are they?

it was a good, simple side dish. I recommend adding the honey...

"...Didn't enjoy chewing on whole roasted garlic cloves"?!??! Horrors! Sweet, carmelized garlic is what makes life on this planet worth living, IMHO...

After having read all the rave reviews, I was surprised to be somewhat disappointed with this recipe. It was easy to prepare, but not really all that special. My husband and I also didn't like chewing on whole roasted garlic cloves.

Very nice dish indeed. We had a multi-course meal last evening and many of the first complements were for this dish. I might cut down on the roasting time on the vegetables, though it's important to note I was cooking with a Viking!

Excellent! I did not change a thing and I thought it was perfect.

It is a good balance de perfume of vegetables. In order to make sweeter, I add 2 tsp of liquid honey and I cut the quantity of garlic because it is too much for myself. Congratulations.

In an effort to expand the range of reasonably healthy food in my repertoire, I made these on a whim. I didn't have any fennel, nor any sage on hand, but I used the remainder of the ingredients and these were fantastic! I made them again for a dinner party and was asked for the recipe...the highest compliment I think you can get! I'll make this one quite a bit.

This was excellent! I had never used fennel or celery root and wasn't sure how this would taste. I served it for a dinner party and there was nothing left. Everyone loved it. I made no changes in the ingredients. I'll definitely make this again!
