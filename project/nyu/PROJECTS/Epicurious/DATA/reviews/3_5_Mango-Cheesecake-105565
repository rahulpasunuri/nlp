It's the perfect cheesecake recipe. It's creamy and refreshing with just the right bit of tanginess. I used brown sugar for the crust and slightly unripe mangoes. Yummy!

Simply delicious. Got ideas from previous reviews. One-quarter cup of brown sugar and a quarter cup of white sugar for the crust made for a terrific taste. Bought canned mango from the Indian store and used two cups in the recipe. Easy and delicious. Loved by all who helped me eat this!

This cheesecake is amazing! I substituted the vanilla for rum, added 1/4tsp of lime zest and 2 tsp lime juice to filling. I made it with fresh Dominican mangoes and served it with a raspberry coulis...soooo goood!

An exceptional dessert. My friends keep asking for this over and over again.

Agree with others that this is more like a fluffy flan than a creamy cheesecake. I used an entire 15 oz can of mango puree (for only $1.99) from the Indian store. It definitely gave me the mango flavor I was looking for. I sprinkled in some cardamom powder and it tasted just like Indian mango kulfi ice cream. I also added about 5 more minutes to the baking time. Delicious!

Excellent recipe! People have called up prior to parties requesting me to make this and are then scraping crumbs off the serving plate after served. Very easy recipe to follow and comes out amazing everytime. Only change I made was to use a canned mango puree I found at an Indian store instead of the fresh mangoes- it gives it a real depth of mango flavor without being too overpowering. I use the same measurement of 13 oz. I also use half brown sugar and half white sugar for the crust, gives it a great caramel-ish flavor as well. Definitely recommend anyone to make this!

I read the reviews before making this cake and took some advice. I used 2 cups of canned mango puree and 1 fresh mango, added the lime juice and some lime zest and an additional package of cream cheese. I layered mango slices on top and also made a puree of 1 fresh mango and some sugar just like I do with strawberries when I make a regular cheesecake. The cheesecake was still not as dense, but the mango taste with the lime kicker was definitely there. The fact that it is still lighter than a regular cheesecake makes it perfect for spring and summer. I would not add the sliced mango to the top again. The puree alone is enough. The slices make it hard to cut and serve and it was overkill with the puree. Maybe either or but not both.

Update. After cooking, it was ok. Like others, its more like a flan. Won't bother making it again. Pretty weak on the mango flavour.

Rating it as four fork recipe prior to baking. Made some changes - took suggestion to add lime juice. Didn't have 3 blocks of cream cheese, so I used two cream cheese, and a small tub of marcapone cheese. Used rum flavouring instead of vanilla. Tastes amazing licking the boowl. Hope the cooked version is as good.

When I made this I could tell when I tasted the filling that the mango flavor needed help, so I added the juice of a very large, very juicy lime. What a difference! It pumped up the mango and made the cheesecake really sing.

This was a wonderful and easy cheesecake to make. I used mango puree instead of fresh mango. Saved time, the taste was concentrated and it was a hit with my guests.

I have been making this cheesecake off and on since it was printed. Nothing but rave reviews. I am generally "stalked" by friends after making it for them asking when I would make another one...The last time I made the cheesecake I wasn't happy with the fresh mango available to me so I used sliced canned (drained) mango and decided I liked the flavor and texture even more. A lovely cheesecake.

I made this again with fresh mango because I didn't have any of TJ's frozen available. The flavor is much better with the frozen mangoes!

This tastes yummy. After reading the reviews, I added a mango glaze as a topping. But this cake had a mousse consistency...how can i make it a little denser to give it the texture of a real cheesecake?

This is a great recipe and I have made it several times. I use 20 oz of Trader Joe's frozen mango chunks for the filling and light cream cheese. I serve it with another 8 oz of diced mango and garnish with pureed mango. It is a light and delicious dessert!

Rating: 4
Loved this cheesecake. I used Trader Joes sliced mangoes in a jar and the flavor was quite good. I also spruced up the crust by adding a little ground cardamom and coriander. I took the cake to a dinner party and all the guests insisted I was always invited. I guess that means they like it.

The texture of this cheesecake is quite nice. However, after reading other reviewers' comments regarding the flavor, I have to agree. I used lovely fresh mangoes, available this time of year in Florida, plus I added mango flavoring. The flavor just wasn't there. Perhaps if Ratna brand canned mango puree is used it might bring out the flavor. This brand was suggested in another recipe. I've come to the conclusion that mangos are just too delicate a flavor to be cooked. I made a puree of fresh mangos to put over the cheesecake when I served it. That really added a nice flavor to the whole dessert.

Rating: 4
Exceptional recipe! Based on other reviews, I did made a few changes which substantially solved the lack of mango flavor. I used 4 mangoes instead of 3, pureed them, then cooked them down in a saucepan over mediume heat until the pureed mango measured 2 1/2 cups. I used the 2 cups of reduced puree as directed in the recipe (reserving the other 1/2 cup for a topping) and added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. To make the topping, I used the reserved 1/2 cup reduced puree, added 3 Tb sugar, and 1 teaspoon Cognac, stirring over medium heat until warmed through. Spread the topping over the cheesecake then decorate as directed with another sliced mango. This is a wonderfully light and flavorful cheesecake!

This is the best cheesecake ever. Served it for our Dinner Club and got raves. I used many of the recipe suggestions found in the reviews...added the cornstarch...used canned mango...baked longer. Have made it several times and get asked to bring it when my turn for dessert. I used a can of sliced mango to garnish in a pinwheel pattern.KO1

I agree with the many other comments that the cheesecake does not have a very strong mango flavor. I tried using 1 ½ cups of the Trader Joes mango-sauce and ½ cup of very ripe mango puree, still pretty mango flavorless. That being said the cheesecake is very good, I think the mango helps make it very light. If you want a very yummy cheesecake that tastes more like a regular, plain cheesecake this is the recipe for you. I guess you do get all the extra vitamins from the added mango, not too bad.

I made this for a filipino baby shower and it was a huge hit. I topped it off with a reduced mango/papaya puree and sliced kiwi, papaya, and starfruit. The presentation was awesome. Everyone ooh'd and ahh'd. The cake itself is light but did need a little extra mango flavor.

Rating: 3
This is a nice lighter tasting cheesecake that works well after a heavy meal. I agree with the other reviewers that it needs a little flavor boost - maybe a fresh mango sauce of some sort would help. I would also recommend using very ripe mangos in order to intensify the flavor or use a mango puree. I didn't make the crust as I have one with ground pecans that I typically use and was a great complimentary flavor to the mango.

Rating: 2
Quite easy to make, but had very little flavor. Extremely bland with no mango or cheesecake flavor at all. Agree with another review that it had more of a flan consistency. It did take an additional 1/2 hour to bake and was very light. Possibly another variety of mango would impart more taste. The crust was excellent, but overall, the result was a big disappointment. Like the idea of adding raspberry sauce to perk it up, but frankly, we love mangoes and expected it to taste like mango. Two cups of pureed mango should have made it quite flavorful.

Excellent! Light yet rich.

I just finished making this recipe. I find it has more of a flan consistency than a cheesecake. It's still cooling down and my guests will be here in a few hours. I only hope it's as good as everyone says. Right now I am not that convinced!

Tastes just like my mom's mango ice cream. We all loved it and will definitely make it again

I agree with some of the other reviewers that this cheesecake needs a flavour boost. I used fresh mangoes, and maybe the canned puree would have been better. I added 2 Tbsp. of Grand Marnier, which helped a bit. I reduced the sugar in the filling to 1 cup and probably could have cut it back to 3/4 cup. I'd give the texture of the filling 4 forks...it was very light and creamy. I didn't make the crust with the recipe, but made a gingersnap crust with less sugar in it instead. It was a nice pairing with the filling. I topped the cheesecake with a blueberry/blackberry/raspberry sauce which was quite tart, and went well with the sweet filling. This is a nice change from a dense, rich N.Y. style cheesecake and would be great after a heavy meal. I feel it definitely needs something to improve the flavour.

This cheesecake was delectable! I used fresh mangoes from my backyard tree and WOW! I recently had a mango cheesecake from COSTCO at a party and it tasted like cardboard. Go for the homemade and use fresh, very ripe mangoes if you can. I'll be sure to make it again before mango season is over.

My 13 year old daughter made this and the whole family loved it. They all shunned the mango pudding I made in favor if this. It was quick, easy, and delicious

Instead of fresh mango, I really recommend using mango puree from an Indian grocery. I'm sure those are made in India and the mangos there are much more "mangoy" than mangos we get here. My cheesecake was so intense in flavor and just got raves. Also, threw in a tablespoon or two of cornstarch in the batter, it reduces the crack after baking.

Made it twice in a week. The first time (I pureed frozen mango chunks) was perfect. The second time (used frozen peaches) had a terrible texture - curdled like the previous poster from Sharon, MA. Does anyone have any ideas why this happened? I am new to cheesecakes, liked this recipe and am eager to remake it but would like to avoid what happened.

This is really good. I goofed and put 1 and 1/2 cups sugar, so added the juice of 1 lime and 1/2 lemon. I had 3 cups of pulp from very ripe mangos, so added it all and an extra egg. Had so much filling I threw another crust together and made two and froze one for later. Mine baked in about an hour with the extra pulp and egg divided into two dishes. Tropical and good.

This recipe is very easy and delicious! I occasionally cut a few corners if I'm in a hurry; I use canned mangoes (which can be found at an Asian grocery if your local store doesn't carry it) and store-bought crust, and it STILL turns out great! I have had many friends and family members request this dessert for special occasions.

Marvelous! My family just finished DESTROYING this wonderful cheesecake. I used a can of mango puree (sweetend) from an ethnic grocery.

This cheesecake won raves at an Indian-themed dinner I attended recently. One guest even asked me to make another one for him to take to his mother for her birthday. The first time I tried this recipe, I followed it closely, using the number of fresh mangos indicated, and found the mango flavor rather mild but still pleasing. The second time, I added 2/3 cup of canned mango juice and 1 Tbs of flour to the batter before baking. This variation yielded a final product with superb flavor, color and texture. Highly recommended!

I admit when I first made this recipe it was ho-hum, but my kids love mango, and mango cheesecake was requested for my daughter's birthday! So I persisted. Instead of using pureed mango, I had a mango sauce (mango, water, sugar, lemon & lime juice) from Trader Joe's, I sub'd 1 1/2 c sauce for pureed mango. Next, after baking,I put a sour cream topping of about 1 c sour cream and 1/2 c sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, baked in a 500 degree oven til set, about 5-10 mins. Finally after totally cooled I topped entire cheesecake with sliced fresh mango-Now this is a great cheesecake!

if the mangos get too ripe they get "hairy" and can be unappetizing for some. also you might want to get 6 mangos (twice what is called for) and use the mangos with the most flavor. then use the leftovers in a mango drink.

I've tasted much better cheesecakes than this one. I used very ripe and flavorful mangos and served it with fruit, but it still lacked some flavor. Other people liked it because it wasn't an overbearing flavor, but agreed it was just OK.

This recipe is great the way it is except that I incorporated one cup of thawed or fresh, if available, raspberries into the filling giving this cheesecake another layer of flavor. Finish it off with cubed fresh mango and fresh plump raspberries. Mmmmm wonderful. Even more people will love this version.

My favorite flavored cheesecake recipe. For a bridal shower I converted the recipe to make 2 dozen mini cheesecakes which I topped with sliced kiwi and strawberries and glazed with apricot preserves. Everyone thought it was from a bakery and the flavor of all of the fruits worked wonderfully together. The fruit only added a little extra time to the process and was well worth it.

This is an easy recipe and I have made this cheesecake about 6 times now. It is so good because it plays up the sublety of the mango and lets it have its own say. The cheesecake is moist and light and a delightful amber colour. Guests I have served this to are always amazed at how delicious it is.

I had lots of riped mangoes at home and I made this cake. Even though my husband is not a mango fan, but he really liked it! I should have reduced the amount of sugar since mango was very sweet. I also added some lemon zest in it and it came out really good!

great recipe.for the mango puree I used half pineapple mangos and put lime zest in the crust with no extra sugar. I also put a few tablespoons of rum and it turned out exquisite. I will definately do it again and again..it is excellent alone or with whipped cream, but I imagine it is all due to the fresh mango...so when in season!!.../A

I really like this recipe. I have used Asian mangos which are subtly sweeter than the South American variety (find them at your local Asian Market; they are a uniform golden yellow and smaller than their cousins). I used 5 of these and added more mango then recommended. This was the second time I made this recipe. It makes a difference when you take the time to blend the ingrediants well - makes it fluffier. Definitely better the second time around. I also served it with whipped cream and fresh mango. The rum sounds like a good addition or perhaps some grand marnier. I recently made this cake as the ending to an Indian meal. Definitely a nice touch after all the curry, tumeric and cardmon. The best part about this recipe is it is easy to make and everyone loves it!

This is a great recipe, the cheesecake was very moist, I also added a small can of crushed pineapple, with the mangoes, instead of vanilla flavoring, I used a few teaspoons of rum, it bought out the flavor of the mangoes.

This cheesecake was the talk of the New Year's Eve party I hosted! I think the important thing is to substitute the fresh mangoes for the canned mango puree that can be found in many supermarkets. Then, the amount of sugar used should be decreased. Finally, I topped the cheesecake with thinly sliced strawberries and a light strawberry glaze. The red of the ripe strawberries against golden orange of the cheesecake looked fabulous. I would definitely try this recipe again!

I've made this cake twice but only because my family loves it. Although its Ok as far as cheesecakes go, I also found that the taste isn't that outstanding. Also, I found that the cake was somewhat stringy due to the pureed mango.

I used presweetened kesar mango puree (from the Indian grocery store) as a substitute to fresh pureed mango, and this made the cheesecake quite smooth and a lovely saffron color. I also decreased the sugar down, and put lime zest in the crust. I covered it with left over canned mango puree and fresh mango slices before serving.

i thought the recipe wonderful, i will definitely make this again, it was a hit.
