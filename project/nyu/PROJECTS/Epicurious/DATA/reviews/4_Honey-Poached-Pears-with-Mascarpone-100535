These were fantastic! I subsituted ricotta for the marscapone, which worked just as well. I am sure that I will make this again and again and again...

This was the dessert for a catered in-home dinner for 6 - they all loved it! The whipped mascarpone was lovely change from ice or whipped cream - however, I have tried to repeat it twice with slightly different poached fruits and both times it curdled as the whipping began! I guess the good result is only possible with this exact recipe...

I realized too late that I had neither vanilla bean nor dry white wine. I used a little vanilla extract and, oddly enough, balsamic vinegar in place of the wine. The result was still mind-blowing! I look forward to making this again with all the right ingredients.

This was an easy, luscious and refreshing dessert. Perfect with brown sugar ginger cookies found elsewhere on this site. The mascarpone did not whip up into soft peaks, but did form a thick cream mixture.

This was a very good, light, simple, and elegant. I'd probably play around with the cooking liquid. Maybe add some liqueur or whole cinnamon sticks. I did double the recipe for 4 people though, half of a pear isn't much of a serving. I loved the fact that I could make it well in advance too! That always makes my life easier. It was very tasty and I will certainly make it again.

I made this as a sweet ending to a wine pairing dinner I hosted, but topped it off with a swirl of amaretto chocolate sauce and a mint sprig. The only substitution I made was amaretto instead of rum/brandy, to continue the theme with the sauce. Mascarpone paired beautifully with Banyuls - guests raved!

I would have given this four forks, but I altered the recipe in that I just whipped the mascarpone with a little cream, splenda and vanilla. Fanned the pears on the plate with a drizzle of poaching syrup and a dollop of the mascarpone with an couple of sweetened strawberries for color. A wonderful light end to a meal!

My husband and I loved this recipe...easy to prepare, light, elegant and subtle in its flavoring. The marscarpone is scrumptious...we had to stop ourselves from eating it before we got it on the pears. This is a great recipe for company, and I plan to make it again soon.

A great do ahead recipe for "winter fruit". I added a pinch of lavender to the poaching liquid, strained it out after reducing. I substituted goat cheese for marscapone for lactose sensitive dinner guest. Nice sweet/tart flavor.

Absolutely wonderful. Perfect make ahead dessert when you want something light and simple. Took it to a dinner party last night and everyone loved it. My husband said it was about perfect in his book. I was also surprised to find out that mascarpone whips up like whip cream. I always thought it was more like sour cream for consistency. I will be using it more as a whipped accompaniment to desserts.

This recipe was a hit! It was so easy to make and made for a gorgeous presentation. My small and simple neighborhood grocery store did not have mascarpone cheese, so I substituted a mixture of cream cheese and ricotta in its place. I whipped the cheeses in my mixer on high for about two minutes, and it came out to be a delicious substitution. The vanilla bean specks make it all the more lovely and scrumptious, so I would highly recommend spending the few extra dollars on real vanilla beans.

The pears & poaching liquid was fantastic. I ended up doubling the suggested amount of rum in order to get a smoother consistency in the marscapone. Everything was fantastic!

I picked this recipe because after an unexpectedly great meal we wanted dessert. We had pears and mascarpone. We used Calvados because it was what we had on hand - it was fantastic.

These were delicious! I made poached pears before but these were much better. I love the idea of boiling the poaching liquad to a syrup. Instead of serving them with mascarpone I whipped 1/4 cup mascarpone with 1/4 cup whipping cream and 2 tablespoons of sugar. It was great

I might not use the rum next time--the flavor was a bit strong.

I have made this recipe several times when having a dinner party. It is absolutely delicious. Not only is it a tasty, lighter dessert, but the presentation is most impressive. It is also fairly easy to prepare.

I made the poor man's version substituting 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract for the vanilla bean. It was surprisingly delicious.

My husband absolutely raved over this dish, and he's not a dessert person! I served it for Valentine's Day with a French Sauternes, a perfect accompaniment. For an extra touch I cut little hearts out of bleu cheese and served on the pears. Wonderful!

Wonderful! My entire family thinks I am a whiz in the kitchen. I added whipping cream to the marcapone cheese so the kids wouldn't be afraid. I'm even going to make it as part of our christmas tradition!

This wonderfal fall desert was simple and elegant with delicious flavors. Make sure you use a real vanilla bean for a really rich flavor. I poached the pears slightly longer than the recipe called for. Since I didn't have any brandy or rum, I used cassis (a black currant flavored liqueur) and the result was perfect. My guests raved.

Easy to make ahead and perfect dessert after Spinach Lasagne. Friends and family said "It's a new favorite!"

A very pretty presentation and extremely easy to make. Perfect for using up the last little bit of mascarpone cheese left over from making Tiramisu last week.

Very good, and very pretty, but don't use too strongly flavoured honey! I gilde the lily with a few fresh raspberries sprinkled on top.
