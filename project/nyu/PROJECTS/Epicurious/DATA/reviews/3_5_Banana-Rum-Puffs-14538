Meh. The pastry is delicious, if a bit finicky to work with since it was so soft. The puffs looked cute and tempting when finished. But I found the filling flavor to be bleah. I like banana but found this particular combination of flavors unappealing. I think I may have to play with another fruit because the crust was yummy and worth rescuing somehow. But, as is, it's not worth repeating.

Made these for Christmas gift baskets and people devoured them. I got calls the next day begging for the recipe. I'm making them into a holiday tradition. Well worth the effort.

This was just alright. The banana flavor isn't very strong, neither is the rum. Overall it just to mild and nondescript.

This desert was a big holiday hit! I swizzled some melted chocolate over the tops (I love banana and chocolate together)!

My husband loves these - I make them every Christmas. They are best when fresh.
