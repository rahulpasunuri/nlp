Man is this recipe rich! If you don't add the flavorings, it's a great basic recipe for ice-cream. Not for the low-cal minded though! Reading the first review, I was nervous, but didn't run into the same pitfalls. I cooked it only until about 160 (enough to kill bugs) and it was getting thick enough to coat a spoon. After cooling for several hours, it was still quite pourable. I added about 1/2 c Apple Korn, and it added a nice apple taste, but I would've liked the flavor to be a bit stronger. I also would've liked a stronger cinnamon flavor, though I doubled the amount of cinnamon sticks called for in the recipe. I might add crushed cinnamon candy or extract next time. I will definitely keep the base and experiment with other flavorings!

THis recipe deserves a negative fork, not even one! I don't think they tested this, because the amount of calvados called for completely overpowers the recipe, adn once you've poured it all in, there's no turning back. I would definitely suggest adding the calvados on the side of caution. Also, the custard thickened in the fridge overnight and never thinned the consistency needed to pour through a sieve to get all the little shards of cinnamon stick out. I would use regular cinnamon if making this again.
