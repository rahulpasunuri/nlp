This is a very colorful and tasty dish. I followed the recipe closely, but will try some of the recommendations from other reviewers. Great dish for family and company.

Yummy...I made the rice and dressing as written but felt it was lacking so added unrefined coconut oil which made the recipe for me...when I make it again I'll skip the flavorless cooking oil and use coconut oil...plus some extra more than likely.

This was so good and so easy! Even though I was worried the rice would be "bland" according to some of the reviews here, I made the recipe exactly as written. It turned out wonderfully! I couldn't imagine serving a more flavorful rice when the bean topping and dressing already have so much going on. I do think that if you have some bigger eaters around you may find that this does not serve 4 main course servings. I will probably double next time. (By just buying a second can of beans and 2 limes you will have enough from the leftover ingredients to make doubled)

Easy, fast, healthy, and tasty! What more can you ask for?

I made this as a light meal during a heat wave and served it as a main course. I was afraid my husband would still be hungry afterward but we were both quite full! We upped the amount of chipotle peppers and used an orange pepper instead of green. Very tasty and colorful. I might add chopped tomatoes and maybe some garlic next time. We served jalapeno cheddar tortillas on the side. Yum!

As previous reviewers wrote, this versatile dish is great with many other things. I served it with grilled flank steak and avocado salsa. Fantastic! I agree that yellow pepper is preferable to green. It looks and tastes better.

A major hit. Vegetarians and Meat Eaters loved it equally. I served it with an arugula salad with shaved corn and avocado, and thinly sliced grilled steak and chicken. Many people wanted the recipe.

Made this last night to go with grilled jerk chicken. It was really good. Roasted my own red and yellow peppers, skipped the green. Will try the leftovers in flour taco shells tonight.

This was really good, and relatively simple to make. I will make it again. I think the beans/veggies would be better with a bit of a dressing, as they were a bit plain.

Used brown rice for a bit more texture. Amd yellow pepper because I do not like green. Delicious!

This is such a lovely, colorful dish, but be careful with the chipotle peppers, even if you like heat! I diced up two to add to the beans and if it wasn't for the rice to cool things down, the beans would have been too spicy. Try using whole cumin seeds for the dressing -- they add an even nuttier flavor to the dish.

The dressing is the lime juice, oil & cumin which you warm up in a skillet.

This is more of a question...The recipe says to add some of the "dressing" to the beans, but I do not see any dressing ingredients. Can anyone help?

The flavors are great! Good for box lunches. Filling! I took it to work and my co-workers could smell it and were really curious about what I was eating.

Rolled these up in lightly steamed flour tortillas (be sure to oil the steaming surface!), so that they end up as soft tacos/floppy burritos. Great, filling, and lo-cal! Added slices of avocado just before folding the tortilla, just because I could.

I have prepared this dish several times since finding it in Bon Appétit, July 2001. Always make it as printed, and we enjoy it as a vegetarian salad. I will try some of the variations suggested in reviews here.

I've made this at the cottage for guests, taken it on picnics and brought it to buffet/potluck dinners. It never ceases to get rave reviews and generate requests for the recipe. And the fact that it doesn't have any mayonnaise makes it a great summer salad that you don't have to worry about refrigerating - I like it best close to room temperature.

I have made this recipe 3 times in the last 3 months. I was a bit skeptical at first but it is easy and tasty.

Rating: 3
I thought this was pretty good. It was pretty easy to prepare, although I think the step where you add part of the dressing to rice was unnecessary, and very light. I think this becomes a dish you make again when you serve it with lots of little sides people can add as they want: avocado, grated cheddar cheese, hot sauce, chopped onion and corn chips.

Delish. Easy to make for a weeknight. Served it with grilled spicy cilantro chicken sausage, and added a little sliced avocado. Yummy.

I made this for my daughter's wedding reception (250 people!), and it was the only dish that was completely finished. Lots of people asked for the recipe. I would give it 4 stars, but it is only rice. Easily increased for many people.

We really liked this dish. It was easy and quick to prepare, very colorful, spicy, delicious, healthy. What's not to like? This would be a great dish to take to a potluck picnic.

A hit with vegetarian and non-vegetarian friends since it first appeared in Bon Appetit. Gas stove, broiler, or grill work well for roasting peppers. Prep for dressing is labor-intensive, but worth it. Double the dressing recipe to counteract for dehydration in the refrigerator and for last-minute re-dressing.

Very good. I served it with deviled eggs and melon.

This was fantastic! I really enjoyed it and it was fun to make, the whole kitchen smelled wonderful. Unfortunately, I didn't make enough and didn't get any of my own, but I tried some and loved it, and the guests adored it.

I really liked it. We skipped on the bell peppers and added a little more Red and Chipotle peppers than called for. Served with dill-rubbed salmon and served with lime slices, it was a really good combination.

I served this at an outdoor barbecue as a cold side dish to Jamaican-style chicken breasts. What a hit! Recipe was a bit blander than I favor, so doubled the lime juice. I am not all that fond of the smoky flavor of the chipotle peppers, so used only 1 tsp. Recipe doubled w/o adjustment. As written-superb. With my adjustments-perfect for me. Served leftovers heated up - divine! Presented half/half - not mixed together and this looked great on a blue dish.

Rating: 3
Excellent recipe, and easy to make. The rice needs a bit more dressing. Would add a bit of chopped tomato to the beans, and chopped cilantro to the rice. We served it with cheese quesadillas for a weeknight meal, but it would go great with grilled pork.

Perfect for any time of year. It's even better the second or third day. Warm or cold...it never fails to taste great! A great dish to take to a potluck or picnic.

I have been making this recipe since I first saw it over 3 years ago. My husband and I absolutely love it. We follow the recipe every time with one exception - we really like hot things, so we end up adding at least 2 whole chipotle chiles. A great recipe!

Rating: 2
This was ok. I followed the recipe exactly and served with warm corn tortillas. Lime was the predominate flavor. It was very pretty with different colors and textures, but the taste was just ok. Would be good as 1 of many side dishes at a potluck maybe. I probably won't make it again.

Rating: 3
As is, the recipe is not quite spicy enough, so I add a bit more chipotle -- about 1/2 tsp. more. I also serve it with sour cream on the side to stir in. It's a perfect summer dinner when paired with a chilled cucumber soup.

I made this recipe but couldn't eat it immediately and served it the following day. I warmed it in the microwave and served it with a dollop of sour cream. It was a huge hit! Very colorful and very tasty, very healthy.

I've made this recipe twice now. I think it's great! I followed the recipe exactly as it is.And I think the presentation is beautiful.

Okay, so I didn't use fresh lime and my rice was boil in a bag, and I used yellow roasted peppers instead of red...oh, and I used chipotle sauce instead of peppers. But, these were things I had on hand and during the recipe search, I felt this was adaptable to my pantry. I liked the dish, as did my daughter's vegan friend. One other tolerated it; another didn't like it all. I didn't get a clear lime flavor from the dressing - one of the reasons I picked this one from a search for a black bean dish. On the other hand, loved the cilantro, beans, onions and cumin. If I were to make it again, I would use a more powerful lime dressing.

I made this as a side dish with the fresh tuna tacos. It was a hit. I added some extra roasted peppers and used peppers I roasted instead of the jar type. All the flavors went so well together. I'll definitely be making it again and probably always as a side dish.

Delicious- my entire family enjoyed this recipe for light summer dinner

I tried serving this warm with shredded chicken, warm corn tortillas, some sour cream and tapatio-basically tacos. It just didn't do it for us. It was okay, but I definately won't make it again. I think I would have even liked it less as a room-temp salad, as it is supposed to be.

We love this recipe, have made it several times.

This is one of my favorite summer recipes. I have been making it since the recipe first appeared in Bon Appetit almost two years ago. I love everything about this dish: flavor, texture, and color. Also, any leftover bean-pepper mixture adds welcome spice and crunch to canned vegetable or tomato soup. Yum!

I brought this dish to a large family function and everyone asked me for the recipe. It was a little bland at first but I found the flavors got better when I let the salad sit a few hours in the fridge. I thought the best part was the yellow rice. It had an unusual but addictive tangy taste. I also made a version with shredded roast chicken added to the beans.

Rating: 1
The dressing was way too tart for my taste -- I couldn't detect the cumin at all. I made this dish for my youth group at church and ended up throwing it out half an hour before and serving my mom's black bean burritos instead.

Rating: 3
In a rush (i.e., not paying close attention to the recipe) I toasted the rice in the dressing for a minute or so before adding water - turned out delicious. I just made more of the dressing and added it to the beans - thought the chipotle chilies made this a delicious quick dish!

Loved the spicy black beans,but the yellow rice was disappointing.Next time will serve with plain white rice and some avocado.

Dish was OK. Tumeric didn't do anything for the rice . Might be tempted to use curry if I try again. Think that might bump up the taste. Found it a little bland. Funny, since there were so many good ingredients in it. No rave reviews from fellow dinners on this one.

I made this for a Memorial Day get-together of neighbors and no one could believe it was made by a gringo! They all thought it was delicious; everyone kept asking who had made the dish. I followed the recipe exactly and plan to make it again for Father's Day.

We loved the black beans, but thought the rice was just okay (kind of bland, even though we added garlic). We served everything warm alongside the Grilled Chicken with Tricolor Salsa from this site, which was wonderful. We much prefer this yellow rice recipe: in 2T olive oil, sauté one large peeled and chopped onion and 2 cloves minced garlic. Add one undrained 14-1/2 oz can chopped tomatoes and 2C chicken broth. Bring to a boil, and boil 5 minutes. Add 3 bay leaves, a generous pinch of saffron, 1C white rice, salt, pepper and 1/2C chopped red bell pepper (or pimento, or peas). Cover skillet and simmer until liquid is absorbed and rice is cooked through (approx. 30 mins.). Delicious.

I have made this twice now and I think the key is making sure your lime juice is fresh (not from concerntrate in those little green plastic limes) and to toast your cumin and grind it yourself (this truly makes a difference). I served it with Cumin rubbed chicken and stuffed red peppers and a very cold Corona!

I really enjoyed this recipe, and it was simple to make too, as long as you leave time for the rice to cool. Delicious and healthy! I served with warm tortillas and made burritos with them and grilled chicken. A real keeper!

Good combination of tastes, textures, and colors. I fixed my own roasted red peppers and black beans, but it was too much work and probably wouldn't do it again. I'd cut the cumin in half; the tumeric-flavored rice didn't have a chance. I added chopped tomatoes--the roma variety which holds up well. Overall, quite nice.

This is excellent. It is an easy to prepare ahead summer picnic recipe. Carries easily in plastic containers and cna be assembled and served on site.

I agree - this is a great recipe. I mixed the beans and rice the next day and it was wonderful. This will become a standard at our house.

Great summer recipe. I roasted my own red pepper and added more chipotle (we like things really spicy). Might try a little more dressing next time. Served the beans on top of rice. Tortillas are nice with this.

Yummy and nutritious. Made it for guests. Everyone liked it - especially the presentation. My lime was a bit tarte. For the next time, I will taste the lime and perhaps add a little sugar.

This is superb! I was a little concerned that I wouldn't like it - that I'd have too much left-over that wouldn't keep well - but next time might even double the recipe! It makes an incomparable, rich-tasting take-to-work lunch... this and an apple make me content.

I loved it--didn't change a thing except to pile the beans on top of the rice. Great combination of flavors and textures.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. We roasted our own red pepper and eliminated the green pepper. Only added 1 tsp. of Chipolte to the beans which was more than enough. We added BBQ chicken to the rice. We heated the beans and served the dish warm with a warm torilla. It was excellent.

An excellent summer salad that we will certainly make again. It also looked very attractive arranged on a plate with the rice in a ring around the bean mixture.

My husband and I really loved this recipie. I roasted my own peppers, omitted the green pepper(which I don't really like) and added some roasted chicken. The flavors really came together well. I will be making this again!

This was excellent. Even my husband who likes meat in all his meals liked this and felt satified afterwards. I skipped the chipotle chilies for the sake of my two year old and added a few drops of Frank's Red Hot Sauce.
