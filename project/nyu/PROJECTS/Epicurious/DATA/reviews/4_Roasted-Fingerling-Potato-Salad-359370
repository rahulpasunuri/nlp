Really good but don't think the eggs would add much. We roasted the potatoes in duck fat. Mmmm.

Potatoes are so forgiving, and such an amazing sponge for flavor!!! I made this with red potatoes, roasted with the skin on. I did not have scallions or tarragon on hand, so I substituted with thinly sliced red onion and fresh oregano. With some crusty french bread to wipe up the herb salad from the plates, this made the perfect summer dinner. My husband can't wait to have this salad and I can not wait to make it again. No more messing with mayo!

This is an amazing recipe - I only had dried herbs on hand and still great - but will use fresh next time. Only thing a little off for me was the timing - I had to 'roast' about 10-15 minutes longer 'face down' and when turned about 15-20 minutes - not 12 - otherwise - perfect and such a good change from the mayo 'stuff'.

Feeling brave I used Japanese cabbage instead of parsley. Also omitted egg and used bacon, which was put in vinaigrette, along with 2Tbacon grease drippings Yum!!

Simply outstanding - a perfect summer side and no need to worry about refrigeration

This is delicious. Perfect as is, but I'm also wondering if it would be good with just a couple of high-quality green olive slices thrown in.

My new favorite potato recipe. Great for a picnic dinner.

Excellent and attractive salad. Can mix with red potatoes and consider trying with a different herb to change flavor a bit.

For those of you who "play" with recipes DON'T with this one. I added more eggs---don't because it becomes an egg salad with potatoes. I was too generous with the vinegar (why? don't ask). After I ate most of the eggs, I served it to my husband who loved it...I will make it again...with care, then it will deserve 4 forks for sure. This wonderful potato salad beats the regular mayonnaise sludge. Thank you Epicurious.

I wanted to stick with tradition and serve potato salad on Independence Day ... but not some mayonnaise glob of starch. This recipe fit the bill. And, yes, you must roast the potatoes; it imparts such a nutty flavor that you wouldn't otherwise have with boiled potatoes. I think serving at room temp would be best, but I made early in the day, tossed all together, and chilled. It was very well received, but would serve at room temp next time (and I will make this again).

delicious. agreed that roasting is a must-- I couldn't find fingerlings, so I used a kilo bag of smallish (cut) organic yellow potatoes, roasted for the same amount of time. Amount of dressing was perfect-- I didn't have red wine vin on hand, so I used basalmic. A bit of brown sugar is great to cut the acidity. Brought this to a barbeque, and let the dressing marinate on the potatoes overnight in the fridge-- great!! Loved the eggs and tarragon too. Everyone raved- definitely a winner.

Delicious and simple-a lovely twist on a classic. Also looked great on its serving platter. Served it with burgers and marinated asparagus and greens- yum!

This was a really great dish, so easy and so tasty - you HAVE to roast the potato's! This was an excellent side dish to roast porchetta - rave reviews from everyone.

Delicious. Roast the potatoes, the taste is totally different. The reviewer that advocated boiling them is insane.

My neighbor and I made this along with the shrimp skewers and they both were a hit. I wouldn't change a thing!

I've made potato salads similar to this that I've preferred to this one. While tasty, I didn't find that roasting the potatoes added a whole lot to the dish, but it did make the kitchen really hot on an already hot summer day. I'd just boil the potatoes next time and save some time and trouble. Other recipes I've made in the past have called for capers and cornichons. I particularly like to add the cornichons for the extra texture they bring. While I thought this recipe was fine overall, I'd probably return to what I've made in the past--less effort with more flavor and texture.

Made this potato salad to go with grilled pasture-fed beef hamburgers. Even my 17-year old teenage son loved this recipe. I tossed the herb mixture with the roasted potatoes and eggs. Can't imagine not doing blending all these flavors into the roasted potatoes. I also added a pinch of brown sugar to take a bit of acidity and tartness out of the vinegar/herb/mustard mixture. I will be making this for a girl's foodie weekend in the Hamptons. Fresh, savory and delicious.

I loved this recipe too. I misread the recipe and tossed the potatoes with the herb salad but I think it was a mistake for the better. Wonderful flavors.

Yum-the photo enticed me and the finished product was as good as it looked! Didn't have tarragon, but threw in a few other herbs from my garden. I tossed a little extra sherry vinegar in at the end for some extra zest. This goes onto my 'favorites' list.

I also enjoyed this, and would even add more of the herb salad next time. My husband didn't really like it because he is not a fan of fresh herbs (I know!), but the dressing itself was outstanding.

Made this for a my group of "Foodie" friends this past week-end. I double the recipe with the exception of the eggs and tossed it all together about 2 hours before serving. It was LOVED by all. A great non-dairy alternative for potato salad.

Loved this potato salad. I tossed the dressing onto the potaoes and topped with eggs. I doubled the recipe but not the hard boiled eggs. 2 eggs were enough for about 4 lbs of potatoes.

This is a classy take on potato salad. Very unique and great flavor. Next time I will double the herb mixture and potentially toss the potatoes instead of spooning it on top.

This is a a very 'classy' take on potatoe sald". Very easy to make and delicious. I would suggest making more of the herb/egg topping and I might even try tossing it with the potatoes next time instead of sprinkling on top.
