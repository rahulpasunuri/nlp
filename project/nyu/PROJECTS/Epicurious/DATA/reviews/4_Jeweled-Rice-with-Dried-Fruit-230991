Can anyone tell me if using salted butter instead of unsalted would make a noticeable difference? Thanks!

Yummy yummy yummy. I'm persian and made this for my persian guests. They were impressed. This is not a traditional persian recipe but we do have rice with barberries. I served it with whole baked chicken.

I haven't made this recipe, but someone asked how the rice cooks with only a short parboil. The parboil will get some liquid in to the rice, and the rest comes from the not insubstantial amount of water that is in butter.

I made this to go with the Easter ham, what a great dish. Bright flavors and so colorful. Cooked it in my large Dutch oven, helps keep it warm too. It makes a HUGE amount and will cut it down the next time. I added some cinnamon and allspice to go with the cardamom. All the guests loved it.

Is it possible to make this dish with a rice cooker? I tried doing so and failed; I added the fruit mid-way through and it didn't taste good (spices didn't really mix). Thank you!

I love this recipe. It always impresses. It could easily be prepared the day before as it warms up really well.The smell of cardamoms fills the house and entices the tastebuds!!!

I've made this over and over for years. It's great to take to potlucks because you can pretty much guarantee you won't be bringing a duplicate of someone else's dish and it tastes great warm or room temperature. And it seems to go with everything. It makes a lot, which is a big plus, because I take leftovers to work and never get sick of it. But I rarely get to take any home because the platter is usually picked clean!

Would one of you chefs tell me just exactly how the rice cooks without burning when you've parboiled it only five minutes? I can see that having all that butter on the bottom would help some; but where does the moisture come from to soften the rice?

This dish is great. I will make it frequently. The crust comes right out with the rice; even standing less than 1 hour.

I followed the recipe, except for the apricots, which I deleted, as I am allergic to them. I increased the amount of raisins and cranberries to 3/4 cup each, to compensate for the missing apricots. Instead of pistachios I used pine nuts, because everybody in my family loves them. I made the rice for Christmas day and served turkey with it. It was a huge success, and I intend to make it my Christmas specialty and serve it every year. Everybody around the table had excellent reviews, not least the children!

This was fantastic. I made it for Thanksgiving for vegetarian guests. I substituted dried cherries for the raisins. I made it in an electric non-stick combo deep-fryer/slow cooker, set on 200 degrees - I later raised the temp to 250 to form the crust. It turned out perfectly. I sprinkled chopped pecans on top. The recipe was demanded by several guests. I will definitely make this again.

This was pretty good, and I imagine it would be quite impressive for company, but it was a little too fruity for my tastes.

This rice is light, healthy, and delicious! It was a hit at Thanksgiving and one of those dishes that makes people ask for the recipe before you leave.

Absolutely delicious! I couldn't wait the 30 minutes after cooking, so I tossed the the crust with the rice and pistachios. There was a perfect amount of crunchieness and the blended flavors were unexpectedly yummy. Tis recipe will replace my standard stuffing this year.

This is not a review but a question. Can I substitute Basmati brown rice?

I have made this dish at least 4 times, and it is a huge hit every time. I bought a bag of each of the fruits and pistachios at Trader Joe's, so I always have the ingredients on hand when I'm in the mood for this rice. I find it to be very easy, not labor intensive at all. It is so flavorful and light, the best side dish I've found in a while!

Made this for Easter - trying it, of course, for the first time - and I followed the suggestion of cooking the rice and assembling in advance and then cooking later in the day with the rest of the dinner. I didn't have high expectations, having taken what seemed to be the easy way out, however the result was devoured by the whole group. Perfect side for Easter ham and asparagus; pleasing both visually and to the pallet

I tried to use brown basmati rice because I like to eat whole grains. Since I know brown basmati takes longer to cook, I tried to account for that by boiling it in the water longer. Still, I must have messed up because even after 40 min. on the stove top, the rice was crunchy. I am not adding some broth to try and make it cook faster, and hopefully I will be able to salvage what I started because the recipe looks delicious.

beautiful looking and delicioius. I prepared it in the morning, layered it as instructed and I did 2nd cooking 30 min before guests arrived. By the time we sat to dinner,it was perfect. Easy to make, i am sure I will make it again.

This dish was relatively easy to make, looked and smelled great, and tasted wonderful. To save time, I used roasted pistachios instead of sauteing them in butter.

Used cinnomon instead of cardomom and it was excellent and had a beautiful presentation. A real crowd pleaser- and a definate keeper.

Simple, quick and inexpensive, this dish made an impressive presentation on a holiday table. It was colorful, and had a complex flavor. I cooked the dish as instructed (actually about 45-50 minutes on electric range), and reheated 2 hours later on gas burner at medium heat for about 10 minutes. Crust released immediately and was a crunchy golden brown. To save fat, dry roast the pistachios, but don't skimp on the butter for the crust!
