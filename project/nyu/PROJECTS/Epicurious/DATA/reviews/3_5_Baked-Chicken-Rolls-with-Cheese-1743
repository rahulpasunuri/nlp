Like many others, I updated this recipe using the basic template. I substituted the cheese with cave aged Gruyere, and prior to placing the cheese on the breast filet, I placed a slice of Prociutto de Parma and sprinkled it with finely chopped sage. Also like others I used Panko, with grated Parmesan, Romano, and Peccorino.

I might be the only person here who followed (well, sort of) this recipe. Other reviewers are correct that this really is a template for just about any rolled stuffed baked chicken recipe you want to make. It's good for helping you figure out ratios. So, I did use the thyme and paprika in the amounts called for, but I used panko for my bread crumbs, and also added some garlic salt. Instead of muenster, I used sharp cheddar. It took a lot longer to cook, about 30 minutes to get the temp to 180, but I think this may have been due to the fact that I put all the rolls in a pyrex dish rather than spreading them out on a baking sheet. This is a delicious starting point for whatever you want to do. Next time I'll replace the paprika with chipotle pepper powder and use pepper jack.

i just made this for my fiance for valentine's day and he loved it! i told me to add it to the recipe book for when we get married! haha... and he is very picky! it's an easy and fun way to make chicken. i used the chicken tender strips instead of chicken breasts and it worked wonderfully

I like to use sharp cheddar and sun dried tomato pesto inside my rolls. Or Havarti and Dijon. Mmmm... I bake at 375 for 45 mins, but that is with the tenderloins cut off before pounding and then added to the filling. I also make it like this: floured, dipped in egg and dipped in a combo of bread/cracker crumbs, Italian type herbs and Parmesan cheese.

I have a very similar recipe using fontina cheese, sage, and roasted red pepper as the filling, and flour instead of bread crumbs. You really can't go wrong if you use ingredients you like!

I am getting the impression that this is the recipe that never was. Like many people I used this recipe as a jump off point for what I had available and I winged it. I mixed mozzeralla, grated parmesan, minced garlic, & asparagus tips. Instead of rolling the chicken I cut a pocket into it, seasoned it w/ salt & pepper and stuffed it with the cheese mixture. I tin foiled and olive oiled a baking sheet and happened to find some lemon thyme in the fridge and scattered that over the top. I baked at 400 degrees for about 40 minutes. My kids absolutely LOVED it as did I. My husband came home and lamented that he had eaten at the airport already and couldn't eat another bite. I will be making my version again. What's yours? :0]

This was so easy to make and a recipe that has so many options. I read the other reviews & used panko breadcrumbs. I sauteed portabello mush. and onions & added that to the chz & chx. Next time I want to add broccoli or aspar. This is a dish you cannot get tired of!

Changed the recipe slightly, used mozarella and roasted red pepper as the "stuffing". Good weeknight meal.

Quite simple and tasty. I left out the breadcrumbs, and didn't miss them. It took longer to cook than the recipe suggests, probably close to 30 minutes. Will make again, maybe adding something spicy next time.

Rating: 3
This was very yummy, and I will definitely make it again. To the cheese I added sauteed onions, garlic and broccoli, and perhaps that caused the increase in cooking time. I started with 30 minutes (based on other reviews), and then used a thermometer to make sure it came to 180 degrees. It took probably almost 45 minutes. I'm glad I used the thermometer. Like others, I used a different cheese inside (what I had on hand) and used parmesan instead of romano. My husband and daughter both really liked it, so I will keep this in the recipe rotation!

This recipe was quick and easy to prepare. The ingredients seemed kid-friendly but my children did not especially like it. My husband and I ate it but thought it was just OK. I wouldn't make it again.

Was I following a different recipe? This was a disaster. My chicken breast halves weighed just under 1 lb. each, so when I flattened them they were huge. Rolled up they looked like giant torpedos. I layered pepperoni and a stick of Swiss cheese. After 45 minutes in the oven the centers were still raw. My 13 year old, who will eat anything, hardly touched his. This is not a recipe I will spend my time on again.

Rating: 3
What a great, quick recipe! I made this with fontinella cheese, and rolled fresh asparagus into the chicken as well. Very quick and easy, and everyone loved it. Just a note, I did roll the flattened breasts the long way (e.g. I rolled from a long side, creating a long roll that only wrapped the filling once. No problems with them falling apart, and I sliced them into rounds to serve. I'll definitely make this again, and vary the filling, as others have mentioned.

Rating: 2
This is good, but nothing special. I think it would be better with a sauce pooled on the plate, and then slice the chicken roll and place on the sauce. Maybe a Mornay. If I made this for company, I would have to spruce it up a bit.

I have made this dish many times, and although it takes a bit of work to prepare the chicken rolls, the presentation is lovely. The rolls can be prepared ahead of time and refrigerated overnight, which I would do if you're having a dinner party. It's a great make-ahead dinner entree.

I also used Monterey Jack cheese, but most of it melted out the sides of the chicken roll. Despite this minor setback, the dish was easy and very tasty. My husband loved it. I did bake it for 30 minutes, per the other reviewers. Yum!

This recipe was simple and delicious, and all of my very bland and picky family cleaned their plates. I followed other reviews and used monterry jack instead but It took a good 30 minuetes for the chicken to bake! This will be a staple on my rotation!

This was excellent! I also used the panko bread crumbs. I did not have muenster cheese so I used what I had on hand. I had swiss and feta so I divided these cheeses among the chicken breasts. Also had to bake for at least 25 minutes. I will DEFINATELY make this again.

Very easy and delicious. I used pepperjack cheese inside the chicken and added onion powder, garlic powder, and parsley to the breadcrumbs. Sprayed some olive oil on top of rolls with my Misto. I found I needed to bake it for about 25 minutes - chicken in the center of each roll wasn't quite done at 18 minutes - but important not to overbake this. Will make this again - was too easy not to keep.

Rating: 4
I really liked this chicken dish. I followed the basic recipe outline but used whatever I had on hand, i.e., Italian seasoned bread crumbs, pepper jack & parmesan cheeses. I seasoned the bread crumbs & cheese with herbs & spices of my choice -chili powder, Italian seasonings, paprika. Lots of flavor! My 10-yr-old enjoyed this as well. I will definitely be making this dish again.

My hubby and 1 yr. old gobbled this up. I used Parmesan instead of Romano, Italian seasoning for the thyme, and Provolone instead of Meunster. It helps to secure the rolls with a toothpick before dredging. Also, my chicken breasts were on the large side; I baked them for 20-22 min.

I made this recipe as printed, but used pepper jack cheese and cooked it for 20 minutes. It was moist and delicious. My only complaint is that it didn't brown as much as I had hoped for, but it was still great.

This recipe was extremely easy amd everyone loved it. I couldn't ask for more from what is intended to be a simple recipe. I did learn from other posters and put a slice of prosciutto inside, plue mozarella. (I used a high-end string cheese stick and halved it. So easy!) I also cooked them for 30 minutes, covering them w/ oiled tinfoil for the first 20. Great recipe!

I loved this last week, and I'm trying it again, this time w/ cheddar and broccoli in my wife's and pepperjack in mine :)

I used fresh bread crumbs by toasting garlic/cheddar bread then running it through the food processor briefly. I used sliced mozzerella cheese and a slice of partially nuked bacon inside before rolling it. I also brushed a mixture of olive and garlic/olive oil on both sides of the breast before stuffing. To the crumbs I added a good parmesan cheese, Lawley's seasoning mix, onion powder, garlic powder, basil, and oregano. I cooked it for almost 30 minutes which seemed to be enough, and served with a chopped tomato/garlic/onion sauce with Italian seasonings. Very good..future consideration would be to use prociutto instead of bacon. I am also intrigued with the idea of deep frying this, but we'll see - I think the filling would leak out.

I made this dish for a dinner party, and everyone loved it. They thought it must have been difficult to make, but it was soo easy!

I thought this recipe was fantastic - SO fast and easy and delicious...a great weeknight meal. I used Italian breadcrumbs, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. I have to disagree with the previous reviewer in that I think it would be great for company. You can make the rolls in advance and then pop them in the oven when company arrives. The presentation is really nice and if you really need to impress, could dress it up nicely with some fancy sides.

Took everybody's advice and spiced it up a bit using mozz cheese, Italian bread crumbs, and adding thinly sliced pepperoni in the middle. A thin covering of tomato sauce is an option as well.

Rating: 2
Used Italian bread crumbs instead of regular to try and boost the flavor--still came out a bit bland. Also, like other reviewers, I needed to cook it longer--@ 20 minutes or so. This is a solid, easy, good weekday meal--not good enough for company, but not every meal needs to be a culinary masterpiece. Next time might experiment with some of the ingredients suggested by other reviewers--I'm thinking that if I substitute the Muenster with Mozzarella and top with marinara sauce, I may get an easy version of Chicken Parmesan.

These were alright. If I made them again I'd tinker with the recipe, add different things.

We found these just to be 'ok'... weren't crazy about them. Agree with other reviewers - it needs a few more spices or something. I added thinly sliced pieces of fresh prosciutto & generous amounts of muenster. Will make again... but not in the near future.

Yum! Something tasty that kids will like. To make this "gourmet," it needs a more sophisticated-tasting cheese and some brightly colored ingredients that line the entire chicken breast so you can see them spiraling inside. I see that some reviewers have suggested spinach or prosciutto or ham, which definitely would provide the needed visual contrast. The cheese does ooze out by the time it's done baking, but who cares. BTW, you only need maybe a third of the breadcrumb mixture. Also, I didn't think and used shredded Romano cheese. As a result, it didn't stick to the chicken. Don't make the same mistake!

These were pretty easy and super tasty! Well worth the pounding and rolling of the chicken. Nice for just the family or serving to guests. I had to bake about 15 mins longer (at high altitude).

I followed the lead of the other reviewers and modified it a bit, using Monterey Jack cheese and diced tomatoes. My husband loved it more than I did, but I have to admit that it tasted better the next day as leftovers. It could be a company dish if you dress it up a bit more (using different kinds of cheeses and maybe adding spinach or mushrooms). I also added olive oil to the crumbs and definitely recommend you do that. It is a keeper for a nice, family dinner.

A great family recipe! Easy to prepare and enjoyed by all; anything the whole family will eat is a hit in my book. I used provolone cheese and a slice of ham since they were what I had on hand. A great recipe for the nights when quick and simple is key.

Once I made it I thought it looked like one of those 50's recipes from hell (see lileks.com's Gallery of Regrettable Food.) Much better after it has been baked, but by the time we talked about how much we were going to doctor it up, it was an entirely different meal. So-so, not great.

This dish was the hit of the entire dinner. It was the fastest and eastiest to make too. I used the suggestions and tips from the other reviews and I'm so glad I did. It did take 30 minutes to bake and instead of Muenster I used Monteray Jack and added a slice of Proscuitto with the cheese. I lined the whole length of the chicken breast with both the cheese and proscuitto - no problems with the cheese spilling out. I also added a bit of olive oil to the breadcrumb mixture. Amazing!

Rating: 3
This is a simple and satisfying weeknight kind of dish. Turkey breast fillets can also be used. To keep the cheese from escaping, slice it thinly instead of making sticks, and cover the whole breast instead of just the starting end of the roll. The rolls have more flavor if you also include a layer of prosciutto between the chicken and cheese. I also mix a little olive oil in with the breadcrumbs, and whatever herbs are in the fridge--fresh sage is a very nice alternative.

Fast, easy, delicious--and looks great, too. I experimented by using goat cheese, and also diced some tomatoes and rolled them up with the cheese--it added a nice touch, and wasn't so cheese-heavy. What's also great is that you can prepare this dish in advance--I put everything together the night before and just baked it right before company came. Definitely a keeper!

Great, simple - and delicious. I stuck to the recipe, except that the chicken definitely needed a few more minutes in the oven...it ended up staying in for almost 25 minutes, so just make sure to check for doneness. I served it with garlic roasted potatoes, caesar salad and steamed broccoli with lemon/garlic sauce.

This dish is "Simplicity at it's best". Nice presentation and delicious. The only problem is I had to cook the chicken more than twice as long as what was called for, even at 400 degrees. I also used imported provolone instead of muenster. Next time I might try baking a sliced tomato on top.

I've made this recipe several times and passed it along to a few people as well. I found that I had to cook it at 325 degrees for about a half an hour as it was cooked all the way thru.

You can dress it up and serve with a variety of accompaniments. Thanks
