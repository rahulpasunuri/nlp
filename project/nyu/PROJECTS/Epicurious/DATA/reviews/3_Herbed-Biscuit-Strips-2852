A nice easy recipe for a weeknight. I used just 1/4 cup butter. I didn't get 13, 1 inch strips from the dough either! They were nice tasting, but next time I would do regular biscuit shapes.

These were rather tasty and very easy. I used shredded Asiago, and I created my own Italian seasoning using basil, oregano, a little salt, and freshly-ground black pepper. We had these on the side with a nice Porterhouse steak tonight, and a salad afterwards. I'd make them again.

This recipe was very easy to make. The only substitutions I made were using parmesan cheese-from-a-can (the kraft kind) and oregano and garlic salt instead of italian seasoning. I would have used the recommended ingredients if I'd had them! The strips turned out a little dry, but were very good. Maybe serve with soup.
