this is my recipe, submitted to Gourmet years ago, & its still a favorite! Just a few comments/ suggestions; yes, the dough is very stiff, don't worry it will roll out easily. The unbaked but shaped pastries can be refrigerated for 2 days, or frozen for months and baked when thawed. Dough adapts to various fillings, even those that are savory (ie brie and chutney)

I have people who literally beg for these! I roll out the dough into a rectangle, then roll up jelly roll style and chill before cutting into 1 inch wide spirals. Looks pretty and WAY easier! I also brush the rolled dough with heated raspberry jam, cover with filling and press down beforerolling up.

On the advice of one of the other reviewers, I started with the dry ingredients in the mixer then added the butter and cream cheese. I would NOT do that again. The butter and cream cheese did not fully incorporate into the dough, making the resulting cookie more flaky than tender. Also, the dough wasn't sweet enough. The filling was great, but I added a bit of raspberry jam just to give some added moisture. Though the cookies were well recieved, I will probably try another recipe next time.

This recipe is very good and quite easy to make. The dough mixed very well in the processor. I also chopped the dates and the nuts in the food processor, and that worked very well. Though the dough is stiff, it softens easily and rolls out well on a flexible mat. I would use a slightly heaped 1/3 cup for the filling on each round that makes 8, and do pat it on to the dough. These will definitely be made again.

I made this recipe when I had not a lot of ingredients in the house and guests coming over. I used rasperry jam and chocolate chip for filling instead of dates. This got rave reviews and two years later people are still asking me for the recipe.

We made 5 of the 6 rugelach recipes on this site. This was one of the more popular ones, but what a huge, frustrating mess it was to make! Next time, I am going to make the dough backwards, by mixing the dry ingredients and then cutting in the butter and cream cheese, as the Chocolate Chip, Cherry, and Walnut Rugelach recipe outlines. Note that this dough is much stiffer than the rest, probably because it has so much flour. Let it "thaw" longer than the others. And because there was so much grainy filling, it was hard to spread and roll up. We had lots of filling left over.

I made half the filling with dates, and half with dried apricots. They were both great, although most of my friends and family preferred the apricots. Get the tangy California kind, not those tasteless Turkish ones. We liked the apricot filling tangy, but you could up the sugar a litle if you like things sweeter. Also, I added a couple tablespoons water to the apricot because they weren't as sticky as the dates. Anyway, the pastry was excellent, but a little tricky to work with. Definitely keep them cold in between. Also, another way to make the cookies is to roll each piece of dough out in a rectangle, spread the filling across the long end about halfway up, and then fold the dough over about one inch at a time to make a rectangular log, then cut into 8 pieces. That would be easier than rolling the pie pieces.

I used raspberry filling, but the pastry was definitely very exquisite. It was very easy to make, and best of all, everyone loved it. I will be making it again and again.
