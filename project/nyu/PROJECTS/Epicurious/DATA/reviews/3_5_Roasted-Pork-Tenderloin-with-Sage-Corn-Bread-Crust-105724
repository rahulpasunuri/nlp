Love the flavor, perfect doneness, and how easy it is (relatively)! After reading reviews (thanks everyone!) and cross-referencing some tenderloin roast recipes from Cooks Illustrated and Fine Cooking, here are adaptations made that I'm definitely sticking with in future. 1. Tripled sage 2. changed to 1 Tbsp dijon mustard but added 1 Tbsp honey 3. cut criss-cross hash-marks on fat at top of meat (to help with crust sticking) 4. refrigerate "crumbed" roast for 15 minutes 5. cook roast at 325 degree till meat thermometer registers at 145 (took 45 min for 1.33lb). One fault from my changes is that the crust didn't crisp as much as I'd likeprobably because of the thicker crust (I doubled the crumbs) and lower oven temp. To fix that in my next attempt, I plan to use the convection mode, and roast the meat on a rack.

We LOVE this recipe! I use ranch dressing in place of mustard. I used to do half mustard and half ranch because I don't like mustard. My fiance likes the ranch so much I do it all over now. I use pork loin when entertaining..its a hit!!! I make a batch of Jiffy corn muffins and add a little extra garlic, sage, and muffin. I brown the meat first and have no problem with the cornbread sticking. YOU HAVE TO PAT THE CORNBREAD ONTO THE MEAT. I use extra cornbread and cover the meat generously.

Good not great ...had no issues with breading staying on, I did not pre brown & bumped the sage as suggested. The pork it self was wonderfully moist, but the corn breading seemed a tad sweet, my wife loved it though, might have been my corn cakes being a lill to sweet or just to much breading...not sure.

I was lucky to have mine turn out looking very similar to that of the picture. I made two pork tenderloins and a handful of chicken tenderloins since my sister doesn't eat pork and it was all delicious. I guess I should thank whoever suggested not browning the meat ahead, that worked great. I used a 6 pack of corn muffins I bought at the store and even though it got great reviews I think the sage was too subtle and next time I'll use more. The honey mustard made the whole house smell great when my guests arrived too! I would definitely do this one again.

I gave the recipe 3 forks; it's good not exceptional. The Sommelier recommendations are way out of line with the quality of the recipe. How about some $15. to $20. bottles for this recipe? Come on! Insulting.

I made this with a small Pork Tenderloin - It was delicious to say the least. A few notes: I bought a moist cornbread from the store which did not turn out as well. It stayed moist and fell off the tenderloin is several areas. I would also recommend sticking to 1 teaspoon fresh sage. I used a bit more and found it to be quite powerful. Great overall flavor though!!

This turned out so great! I made a few changes to the method, however, and it solved the problems others reported with the breadcrumbs not sticking. I did not sear the meat! I coated the raw pork with salt and pepper and then coated with a mixture of Dijon mustard and a little honey. Then I patted on the cornbread mixture (made with extra garlic and extra sage). The cornbread mixture stuck to the pork great! It took about 10 extra minutes to bake, but it was worth it! I tented the pan with foil for most of the cooking time except for the last 5 minutes or so. I'll definitely make this again, but I might add even more sage next time.

I want to like this recipe. I have made it twice. I like corn bread, I like pork, I like sage. But as many have mentioned, the pork looks absolutely nothing like the picture, the breading falls off (although not as drastically as you may think from these reviews), the pork is slightly overcooked taken out at 155 degrees, and it's just blah. Not bad, but not special at all. I do not plan to make it again.

Rating: 3
My guests liked this a lot - and I'll defer to them since I don't much care for cornbread - but many agreed this could use a mustard-type sauce to accompany it. If I make this again (which is not guaranteed) I would make a mustard sauce to drizzle over the meat.

This site is wonderful and this is my first time to respond to a recipe. I always review the bloggers suggestions and followed the one this time to chill before roasting. Thank you so much, my presentation was perfect because of that! I just recd a call from my buddy thanking me again for a wonderful dinner.

This was absolutely delicious. The pork was amazingly tender and juicy. The flavors of the sweet corn bread mixed with the garlic and dijon was unbelievable. Love it!

Awesome! The cornbread crust doesn't stay on the meat too well. i bet if you dipped the pork in an egg and flour wash first it would, though. that's what I'm going to try next time.

I followed this recipe almost exactly, and it turned out wonderful. I substituted panko bread crumbs for the corn muffin. My husband really liked it, and he's not a big fan of pork. I served it with instant mashed potatoes and frozen peas for a quick, balanced meal.

Very pleasant and tender. Followed suggestions in other reviews and added 1 TBS honey to mustard, used 1/2 qty. of dry sage and 3 big cloves of garlic. Served with mango chutney, which complemented it nicely.

Absolutely delicious and so juicy for a pork tenderloin! We made Epicurious's Buttermilk Corn Bread for the crust because it uses fresh sage and complements the pork perfectly.

Next time I'm going to try using regular cornbread as the muffins are a little too sweet for my taste. I followed other reviewers tips and used 1/2 Dijon & 1/2 honey mustard. I chilled before I baked, this does add 10 minutes or so to the baking time. I also tented for the entire time it baked, it still browns nicely. Very tasty and easy. My husband liked it so much he had leftovers for lunch the next day.

This was very tasty, but the crumbs did not stay on well at all (the picture was very misleading). I would dredge the meat in beaten egg first and roll it in crumbs in a separate dish. It also took about 10 minutes more to cook. Good flavor, though.

loved this recipe. I added honey to the mustard and it was delicious. I used dried sage instead of fresh and doubled the garlic! YUMMY! My children loved it too!

Rating: 4
I have made this dish a number of times and it's my husband's favorite. I found that the key to keeping the corn bread coating on is to chill the the tenderloin for 15-20 minutes in the refrigerator after applying the corn bread. You will probably need to adjust the cooking time by 5-10 additional minutes but the presenation is fabulous!

Rating: 2
I've made this dish 2 times...both times the finished product was very similar in terms of composition. I used corn muffins instead of corn cakes and doubled the sage. One time I made the recipe as is and the second time I subbed honey for the mustard. The smell and the flavors are a great combination, however the corn bread coating falls off too easily. Needs more work.

Rating: 4
Really easy and great taste. I bought a corn muffin from the deli to use - it doesn't get any easier. I cooked (2) 1 lb pieces of meat and didn't increase the crumbs and it was fine.

Very easy and tasty. I served with squeeze of honey BBQ sauce over top- delicious!

I've made this great dish several times and my one recommendation is to tent the pork w/ foil right away to avoid burning the cornbread.

I made this for my mom's birthday, she loved it. I made two lbs of pork instead of one, so we would have some leftovers. I served it with roasted potatoes and zucchini. The best part was, I fried the remaining sage leaves and served them whole on top of the pork. Everybody freaked out. We served the dish with lemon garnish and it was really good with a little squirt. Also, I used honey mustard instead of Dijon.

A simple dish full of flavor. One caution: I salted the meat generously and salted the cornbread generously, which made for a slightly salty product. A wonderful and simple dish perfect for Fall!

This was very easy and tasted delicious. The crust was excellent and could be used on other meats. My dish took longer to cook than it said in the recipe-I don't know why but I needed to cook it for longer (maybe the roast was a little larger).

I make this often! Tips to get only three kithen items dirty: Just crumble the cornbread into the skillet with your hands. Instead of chopping sage, just fold up several leaves in one hand and use shears to snip tiny bits directly into skillet. Add a little grated cheese (asaigo, reggiano work well, and come pre-grated) to crumbs. Finally, unless you are serving folks picky about presentation, don't try to get an even coating of crumbs; you'll go nuts. Just mound the crumbs over the meat in the pan--they fall off when you cut the meat in any case.

I made this with leftover buttermilk cornbread, and it was delicious. I'm not a huge dijon fan and neither is my family, so I used my tried and true dijon substitute. 2 parts yellow mustard, 1 part white wine, and 1 part cream. The mustard sauce isn't as thick as dijon, but I had no problems with the cornbread mixture sticking to the pork. I followed the earlier suggestion and chilled the pork for about 20 minutes after breading, and then added extra baking time. It turned out great!

I didn't have corn muffins, so I used panko bread crumbs and it was a disaster. All of the crumbs fell off the pork. Perhaps I wasn't using enough butter as I wasn't measuring very carefully. The taste was fine, just lousy presentation.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! I decreased the salt by half, added rosemary and grounded pecans. The pecans were a delicious touch. Since the crust was not sticking completely (although not bad), I decided to lay the sliced pieces on some of the crust that had fallen off. It was so tasty and this was a great way to ensure every bite was flavorful.

As one reviewer said, the crumbs fall off easily. Although the crust is indeed tasty, presentation wise I think this dish fails. I wondered if instead of using crumbs that perhaps using a thick cornbread raw batter would work better?

Would definitely make this again. I bought a little box of Jiffy cornbread mix and made my own cornbread. I also covered with mustard before and after browning. My husband loved this and wants me to make it again..soon!

I made this dish several times before my final practical exam in Foods I course. I had a lot of problems keeping the "crust" on it while slicing. Also I didn't have time to make my own corn cakes on exam day so I subsituted breadcrumbs. Other slight modifications were to use rosemary instead of sage and I added Asiago cheese to my herbed breadcrumbs. I rubbed with dijon prior to pan searing, after seared I rolled in breadcrumbs, then roasted. I found a nice dried fruit compote served in a poached apple to be a nice addition to my plate presentation. My overall grade was a 96 which I was pleased with. I have made this several times since and my 16 year old picky eater son declares it his favorite dish, my hubby likes it too. We NEVER have left overs.

I made this dish for my parents when they came to visit us. My dad is strictly a meat and potatoes guy who thinks "country cooking" is the only way to cook. When he asked what I was making, and I told him the name of it, he said boil it down into simple terms. I said it's basically pork tenderloin with cornbread stuffing. All that to say...even my "don't feed me anything fancy" father absolutely loved it and asked me to send him the recipe! That's the greatest compliment I can get from him, and he is a fantastic cook. My recommendation is to make a pan of your own buttermilk cornbread to use, as I'm sure it will be much moister than anything store bought. I also used more sage than recommended - mainly because I love the flavor of sage. I will make this many more times in the future!

I, too, did not like the combination of mustard with the corn muffin breadcrumbs. The whole house smelled disgusting while it cooked and although my husband thought it was, at least, edible, my daughter couldn't eat it without gagging. We ended up scraping off the coating and dunking the slices in apple sauce to hide the taste.

Rating: 2
I did manage to find toaster cakes and even they could not save this meal. I was so excited to make this based on all these wonderful reviews but was quite disappointed in the result. I found the taste of the dijon too jarring to be paired with cornbread and sage. Also, because the crumbs fall off so easily I ended up needing to slice the tenderloin into thicker pieces than i normally would. I gave it a score of 2 simply because the pork was juicy if nothing else. Will definitely not be making this one again.

I have made this dish twice now! I make some cornbread to serve with the dinner as well as use on the pork itself. I find that you need a little more cornbread than the recipe calls for in the crust (the more the better really) but don't forget to add butter too. Great will roasted potatos!

I tried this recipe with a boneless pork loin. I used corn muffins from a local bakery and can't say enough how much all my dinner guests raved about the meat. It was very tender and the slightly sweet & savory crust was delightful.

I couldn't find any corn muffins and substituted bread crumbs -- came out well but probably would be better with the corn muffins. Nevertheless, my guests loved it. I would make this again but would spend more time looking for corn muffins!

Super easy, and delicious. I got a tenderloin that was split, which actually worked out well, because the extra crust gravitated to the middle, instead of falling off. I like my meat a little more done, so I'd cook it to a higher degree next time, but overall it was fabulous!

Rating: 4
This recipe is a stand-by for me. Great combination of flavors in a recipe that's easy to make quickly (especially if you can pick up corn muffins at the bakery...) Saute some green beans and simmer some spiced apples and you've got a really great, effortless meal.

Rating: 2
If half-forks were allowed, I'd give this two and a half. In this dish, a lot rides on the taste of the breading. I couldn't find corn toaster cakes ANYWHERE in this area so I used a corn muffin from the grocery store. Just wasn't wild about the taste of that muffin. I will try again, this time either with the toaster cakes if I can find them or maybe cornbread. I cut down on the salt after reading the remarks about saltiness, and that turned out to be a good idea.

Rating: 3
This was excellent. My husband scarfed it up and my dinner guests raved. I did as one reviewer suggested and put it in the refridgerator for a while before cooking. I think the definitely helped the crust to not fall off. Fairly easy to put together....especially if you already have cornbread on hand. This will be a fall favorite in our home.

Rating: 2
This is good for a weeknight meal...nothing special. It lacked "taste" impact. If I did make it again, I would use a lot more mustard. But overall, the pork was very moist(I brought it to 145 degrees and it rose to 160 after the resting period) and the prep was easy.

This was very good. I liked the presentation of the extra breadcrumbs sprinkled on top. It would be better if they didn't come off so easily but over all it was very tasty.

This is another 3 1/2 forker- scrumptious. After my breading fell off, I searched the epicurious tips and found one that recommends refrigerating your breaded food for 20 minutes before cooking to make it stick better. I'll try this next time- will probably need to increase the cooking time.

Rating: 3
A very good recipe, easy and flavorful. I followed the recipe exactly and it was ready in 25 minutes. The only reason I gave it three forks instead of four is because, as many have said, the breading falls off too easily, so it doesn't look as nice on the plate as I'd like. I may try a bound breading next time (dip in flour, then egg, then coating). If anyone tries this method let us know how it works out!

This is an outstanding recipe. Very low on the scale of kitchen anguish. Just put it all together & let it cook. The aroma is fabulous.My houseguests really enjoyed the crust too. I added a teasponn of horseradish to the mustard for that "extra" punch. Very Yummy, If You like Pork Tenderloin, You'll love making this recipe. I did have to cook longer than recipe states & also deleated salt content, but otherwise Most Excellent. Bon Appitte'

This was an absolutely wonderful dish! Very easy to prepare with outstanding results! My guests were back in the kitchen after the meal picking the cornbread crust drippings out of the pan. It was a tad too salty, so next time I'm cutting out the salt entirely and I'll tweak the measurements after the next tast test. It also took longer to cook than the recipe calls for but the results are amazing! I highly recommend!!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and served it with a salad of mixed beans, fennel, apples, shallots and mixed greens. It was easy to make and a made our house smell so wonderful!

I tried this for Christmas dinner for neighbors. Though it took longer to reach 155 degrees than in the recipe, three minutes in the microwave brought it to temperature nicely. And it was still moist and flavorful. I used a slightly sweet corn muffin and the last of my garden sage. People fought over the crust crumbs (yes, they do fall off, but who cares?)! My friend's husband went in the kitchen and scraped the roasting pan of crumbs and delivered them to her on a plate to tease her -- she just said thanks and ate them "for dessert"! She and I will both make this again.

This is an easy week night supper main dish that my husband and son liked well enough to leave no leftovers. It went well with applesauce, biscuits, and cole slaw. I took the meat out of the oven when it reached 150 degrees, which was plenty done enough and even starting to get a bit dry; next time I will rescue it at 145. The crumbs do tend to fall off the meat, but they are tasty enough to make up for their misbehavior.

Meat was moist. I used packaged cornbread stuffing mix but probably should have moistened it more with broth and butter as it did not want to stick on the tenderloin. Accompanied the dish with garlic rice and squash, it was a simple and easy menu.

This was OK, not great. The corn bread crumbs basically fell off the meat onto the plate when it was served, leaving us with mustard coated pork loin, not bad, but not worth the effort to get the corn muffin, since no one like corn toasties around here.

What a great recipe for "the other white meat"!! I used a pork roast instead of tenderloin, and it was juicy and delicious. You need extra cooking time for a roast, so it will be essential to tent it after 15 minutes. I served it with roasted aspargus followed by a bibb and radicchio salad. It's so pretty and tasty that it's now on the menu for my next dinner party.

This is a very simple and delicious recipe. The pork is moist and the crust very flavorful. It even reheated well, which is rare for a breaded item. I served it with saffron-orange rice and balsamic-glazed brussels sprouts. Mmmm!!!
