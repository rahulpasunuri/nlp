'Wowed' the guests and was a great alternative to the more traditional version that I also made just in case. I did, though, doctor it up a bit since I overcooked/boiled the consomme and eliminated most of the lemongrass flavor. Added more lemongrass at the end and simmered. Also used dried shiitake mushrooms which were awesome. Will become a mainstay in our family.

The matzoh balls were pretty good. Didn't care for the consomme though.

I served the soup tonight at our Seder, and I take back that the portions were short--it turned out to be just right. Sorry!

I only made the consomme because I use my own matzo ball recipe. The broth was nice and light and subtle in flavor, which was a pleasant change for Passover. I found the recipe a little bit short for serving 8; maybe 6 is more like it.

the broth is light and clean, even aromatic. the balls were fluffy. a twist, yet still satisfying at the gut.

this is the boring way to make them. substitute rendered chicken fat for the veg oil and add some chopped up parsley. now thats a matzoh ball!
