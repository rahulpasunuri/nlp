Super easy and quick. If you make it with shelled deveined shrimp than you might want to turn down heat after first 4-5 mins, after you add the lemon juice, so they don't burn. Also, to make it a little less garlicky, I sauteed the shrimp in the garlic, instead of adding the raw garlic to it at the end, which worked very well. I made it as an entree over steamed white rice. It was delicious. I highly recommend this recipe.

This was a delicious and easy way to prepare shrimp. I tossed the shrimp with the gremolata before sauteeing to brown the garlic a bit, and then topped with some extra and served with tabbouleh, hummus and pita. Will make this recipe again in the summer when BBQing!
