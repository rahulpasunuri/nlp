There are so many things you can do with plantains that the list is endless. You can basically do anything that you do with potatos and some more. You can boil them, put them in the oven until they are golden brown. You can cook with them when they are ripe or green (they taste very different). This recipe is one of the most simple ways to cook them and it is one of my favorites. In Venezuelan they even make big tostones (patacones) and use them as a kind of a bun for a hamburger. Go crazy with plantains, nothing can go wrong with them (be careful with the green one though, they are not so forgetful)

Very tasty and easy. Just what I was hoping it would taste like! I did use 2 plantains which had black spots, and one that was black, and the black spotted ones were much better. Softer and sweeter and just great-

Nice to know this recipe is so easy, but make sure that the heat isn't quite as hot as you'd think. Mine were charred, which was interesting, sure, but not what you're used to. And contrary to the other cook who had luck with 4 minutes per side, I think 2 would do.

There's a great little rest. in Dallas called "GLORIAS" that serves this dish a little breaded and with black beans and sour cream, on the side. Anyone know the breading for the plantain? It's delicious!!!!

This is a great, simple cuban side dish... Goes well with black beans and rice and slow roasted pork. Personally, I think the cooking time should be more like 4 minutes per side rather than 1-2 because I like the slightly carmelized consistency. -- In response to one of the other reviewers who inquired about additional plantain recipes, another common way to make plantain is called "tostones". Tostones are just less ripe plantain which are fried, then mashed flat, then fried again. They are crispier and less fruity... more like a french fried potatoe and less banana.

I have been looking for a recipe for sweet fried plantains and this is perfect. It is so simple and easy to make. I used olive oil and they came out just perfect. I will make these lots more.

These are just super! Rediscovering plantains is the best thing I've done in the vegetable (fruit?) department in some time. Prepared this way, they should be an excellent side dish for a favorite chili dish. I wonder what is another good plantain dish?
