I tend to view recipes as guidelines, so when I glanced over this recipe I thought that it had potential but that it needed some kick. I added some sundried tomatoes packed in oil, 3 cloves garlic, some shallots and lots of freshly ground black pepper. Next time I may try Sicilian olives instead of the tomatoes. It was good.

It sounds more interesting than it is. Quite bland and not worthy of the time and effort. I added tofu ground round which kind of saved it, but I won't make it again.

I really like this dish. It' great with grilled summer food. You can also make it ahead. I add extra cheese, chopped tomatoes and basil.

Although tempting to make because it is so easy, I found that it had very little flavor and not much potencial for improvement with out really changing it. If you like a mild side dish you may enjoy it.

This dish was easy and looked great. However, Not bursting with taste. My husband did not care for it at all -- hence my rating of not preparing it again.

This recipe is great w/ both yellow or red peppers and adds a lot of color to a buffet. It can be prepared ahead and then baked, which is a big plus and it's relatively low fat. An easy, good tasting addition to anyone's recipe file.
