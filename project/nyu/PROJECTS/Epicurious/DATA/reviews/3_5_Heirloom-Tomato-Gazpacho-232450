Simple, fantastic and fresh! I cut everything into chunks and tranformed into soup with my immersion blender. Done in minutes! Used smoked paprika instead of tabasco for a more subtle yet smoky bite. Would also try fresh serranos with just a bit of the smoked paprika. Great dinner with homemade cilantro lime shrimp on the side!

Hooray! Success on the first try; even my husband, who doesn't like raw tomatoes, loved it. I only used 1/4 cucumber, added a smallish avocado, used 5TBsp red wine vinegar and only 3TBsp olive oil, and added 1.5 clove garlic. It was great; I'm excited to see how it matures tomorrow!

This was amazing and so easy! I've made gazpacho that calls for bread and tomato juice and I was left to think, why bother? This uses 100% fresh seasonal veges; the tabasco and balsamic send it over the top!

I used the blender on this soup. I added two small avocados and instead of 1/2 tsp of tabasco I used 1 tsp of Nando's hot sauce. I get nothing but raves every time I make it.

I agree with half the onion and using a blender with about 1/2 of the combined ingredients to get the right consistency. I also added two cups of tomato juice. It was delicious!

Very easy to make. I typically use a food processor, but like the potato masher idea.

Too heavy on the red onion, and I like onion. Next time, I'll use half of a medium onion. I also used a food processor to get the right consistency, which worked well.

Quick, easy, delicious. I took 1/2 of the ingredients and pulsed them in the blender and then used a potato masher on the entire soup to arrive at the desired consistency. The cucumber stands up too heartily to a pair of forks or hands as suggested.
