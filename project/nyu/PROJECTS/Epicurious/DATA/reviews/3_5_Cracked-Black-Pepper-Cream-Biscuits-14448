i made these as a sort of stand alone breakfast biscuit. they are delicious and simple (i had never made homemade biscuits before). i did severely reduce the amount of pepper used since i didn't want that much pep. i think i only mixed in 1/4 of a tablespoon, and sprinkled a bit on top along with salt after they were buttered. i think next time i will make them with a meal.

Nice, hot and moist! The people from the office loved it

The bisquits were quite soft and delicious.Depending on the meal served with this recipe,alter the pepper(amount of pepper makes bisquits hot, but not intolerable).
