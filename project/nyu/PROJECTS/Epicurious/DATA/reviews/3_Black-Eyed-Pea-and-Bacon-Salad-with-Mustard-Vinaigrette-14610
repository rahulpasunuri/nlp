This is the second time that I've tried this recipe and I am giving up on it. I really kicked up everything in the dressing - more shallot, a total of 3 T of mustard ... mixed grainy and dijon and I used good balsamic. I suspect that this would be better with lower quality balsamic because it needs more tartness. I have other ways to make black eyed peas that I enjoy much more.

This is now my favorite recipe for black eyed peas. I also changed the ratio of peas to greens to focus on the peas. I wanted more of a side dish than a salad. I dressed it right before serving and it was delicious.

I used fresh black-eyed peas and much fewer greens to keep the focus on the peas. I also doubled the dressing and added it at the last minute, as others suggested. It was nice, although I felt like it could have used a little more punch. I might try this with apple cider vinegar and a little spicy brown mustard next time.

i loved this salad and agree with the earlier reviewer that it should be dressed just before serving. if you have to dress it early, add the greens later so they don't wilt so much.

I had high hopes for this salad based on the ingredients, but it fell short of my expectations. It felt like a fair amount of work for only a so-so result, and I would not make it again. I almost think it would have been better without the lettuce and arugula, which sort of confused things.

I've been making this salad for years...gotta have black-eyed peas on New years for good luck!

This recipe is very tasty, but indeed needs more dressing than indicated. One word of caution: I made this salad in the morning, intending to serve it that evening. If you plan to do this, reserve most of the dressing and wait to toss later. Mine was not only completely absorbed (no big surprise) but also the flavor totally disappeared. When it was first dressed, it was really quite delightful, but hours later, the flavor just flopped. I would absolutely make it again, however - just wait to dress it.

This was a super easy recipe and very good. I even substituted regular bacon and used turkey bacon instead which was even better than regular bacon since it has less fat and calories.

Made this recipe for something a little for a new years dinner. Everyone loved it! If you can, try to get fresh black-eyed peas -- it really makes a difference. The dressing is really only enough to cover the peas, tomatoes & bacon -- next time, I will do recipe & a half on the dressing.

This recipe was great!! I made it for New Year's Day lunch and it went perfectly with collards & pork chops! I am not a huge fan of celery so I only used one rib and added some chopped red pepper for additional crunch & flavor. As for the greens called for--I skipped on those and used fresh baby spinach which complimented all ingredients, especially the bacon. I also loved how simple it was to put together--I will definitely make this again!

Great salad. I skipped the romaine (still can't imagine why you'd use it) and substituted a great big handful of mixed herbs (basil, cilantro, mint, parsley) for the arugula. Probably used twice the amount of dressing as called for. And the salad needs quite a big pinch of salt and pepper to season all those beans. I let salad sit in fridge for 24 hours, then served as a room-temp accompaniment to grilled chicken. Perfect. Could be made with any legume (chickpeas, black beans, even navy). It's the 15 slices of chopped bacon that makes it so good.

At the very last minute I realized my dinner needed a salad. I looked in the fridge and discovered I had a bag of fresh black-eyed peas from the local farmers market. I had never cooked them before and adopted the fresh peas to this recipe. I used half of the bacon that was called for and quickly produced a great salad that was easy to put together just minutes before my meal was ready to put on the table. Great taste and so easy to prepare.

I have made this recipe every New Year's Day for the past four years and look forward to serving it to friends again this year. I usually make a little extra vinaigrette as the warm peas seem to like to soak it up. Give it a try!
