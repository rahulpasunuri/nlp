I agree with Minneapolis - smoked paprika and saffron made a big difference. But I made it with kosher, bone-in chicken breasts - very flavorful and an excellent combination with the olives.

After seeing the comments here about blandness, I decided to dress this up Spanish style. I subbed chicken stock for the water, and modified the spices to use Spanish sweet smoked paprika instead of the Hungarian, freshly ground black pepper, a 1/4 tsp crumbled saffron threads, and 1/4 tsp of cumin. At the stated cooking time, it still seemed a bit bland and I thought about mixing up some gremolata, but after sitting for about 90 minutes, the flavors were wonderful, the texture was rich and hearty, and the gremolata wasn't necessary. A huge hit at our Seder dinner. Use good quality green olives, not canned or pimento stuffed.

I doubled the recipe for a large dinner party. Everybody complimented it. Next time I will replace some of the paprika with Spanish Smoked Paprika to see if it has a little more flavor.

I served this dish last night and it was a huge success. I added fresh thyme and dry rosemary leaves to it as suggested by someone else and it was delicious. Highly recommended!

I agree with Vancouver as well, I tried several different variations and gave up.

I saw this recipe and I immediately thought, what a good idea! So I started making it and halfway through I threw in some fresh thyme and some dried rosemary which I happened to have on hand. Tasted great, but without the herbs it would probably have been mediocre; using only paprika won't do.

This was a fabulous recipe. I have made it with and without the tomatoes. Use canned diced tomatoes if ripe, fresh ones aren't available.

I agree with Vancouver,a total dud; I added beef and it was still lacking good, complimentary flavors. Don't waste your time.

This is really lame, tasteless and boring. I poached red snapper in the stew and it still was a dud recipe.

This was flavorful, filling and delicious -- also a great way to showcase the unique taste of large green olives. Because tomatoes are out of season, I used a 14-ounce can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. It was wonderful.

This is very, very good! Unusual and easy.
