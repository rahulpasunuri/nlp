We made this for Chinese New Year for 6 adults along with the twice-cooked five spice lam with red chiles. They went very well together and this recipe was really delicious. My sauce didn't thicken as well as I was hoping, but that may have been a planning issue. Don't use fresh shitakes-the chewy texture of the dried is a great contrast to the still slightly crunchy bok choy and the velvety lamb. One of my guests, who grew up celebrating Chinese New year, kept returning to the kitchen to have a few more of the mushrooms that didn't fit on the plate, so I took that as a good sign!

Fairly easy and very good. Nice that it called for dried shiitakes cos I live in Italy and it's hard to find fresh ones. I didn't have any oyster sauce so added a little tonkatsu instead and it came out fine. Also forgot to add in the tapioca starch mixture at the end, which kinda bummed me out cos I did happen to have tapioca starch and was happy to finally use it. Still it came out fine (a little watery-er), a pleasant side dish to tonight's stir fry.

Great dish! The second time I made it, I chopped the bok choy in smaller pieces --same with the mushrooms. I also added scallions. SO good! I served over thai noodles.

To round out the recipe, I added some stir-fried cubes of tofu. Yum.

Super (and much better than another using butter in the recipe) very Chinese. Make as an additional side when making the Sticky Rice with Chinese Sausage - Mmmmm! This recipe is our staple baby bok choy recipe.

This is a very good bok choy recipe (2 1/2 forks). I prepared the sauce sauteeing the ginger and garlic together as suggested. The sauce is good but I think I'd like it better if the mushrooms were in smalled pieces.

I stir fried the garlic and bok choi in 1 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp peanut oil then braised everything with the liquid for 3 minutes covered which made for softer bok choi but better blended flavor and a better coating of the sauce. My sister would have preferred more crisp tender like the recipe directs but my baby bok choi were a little grown up so I was afraid they might be too bitter if not cooked through. I left out the sugar and ginger but I also added chicken bullion paste to the shitake soaking water before adding to the pan, instead of using chicken broth which gave it a depth of flavor. (Be sure to use a good quality dried shitake if using my method or risk getting some grit from the soaking water.) It was wonderful. I finished the dish with a splash of sesame. Next time I will use less chicken paste as it was a bit salty. Thank you femvitale for your review.

I followed the recipe as is with the following modifications: Stir fried garlic and 4 slices of ginger in oil before adding the mushroom. Added one can of chicken broth. Added one container of firm tofu. Near the end of cooking, added chopped up bok choy to the soup. I did not find this bland like other reviewers. I think stir frying the ginger helped add flavor.

I've made this dish a number of times, as a good go-to veggie when you just don't feel like the same ole green beans, peas, etc. I really feel good about serving my family such a healthy option, too. As written, I look at this recipe as a good starting point, good enough as is but also open to personalization with a little tweaking. I like to make it without the corn starch-ing in the summertime. Sometimes I sub hot pepper sesame oil for the regular. I usually use vegetable boullion instead of chicken, and stir fry the ginger in with the bok choy, which amps up the flavor volume. A good one to play with.

I made this dish with *fresh* shiitake and Better Than Bouillon Chicken Base. I left out the sugar and sesame oil. Otherwise, I made it as a standard stirfry, starting with fried ginger and garlic and ending with a broth-and-starch sauce. It was delicious.

I thought this was terrible. I didn't like the dried shitakes and the sauce had no flavor at all. Very flat, boring dish.

Really good and easy. Market was out of baby bok choy, so used regular, but cut into 6" pieces. Also, I was out of oyster sauce, so used hoisen instead. Still fabulous!

The was an outstanding and very easy recipe. Make sure to serves this immediately after cooking -- you don't want the bok choy to get too soft.

This is a very easy, restaurant-quality dish. Even my young boys devoured the bok choy and declared it delicious! The ingredients are easy to find, especially in the Bay Area, so you don't have to go to three different stores. Sometimes, I throw in a about a pound of thinly sliced sauteed beef to the mushrooms and sauce before pouring over the bok choy. Served with white or brown rice, it is a great one-dish meal.
