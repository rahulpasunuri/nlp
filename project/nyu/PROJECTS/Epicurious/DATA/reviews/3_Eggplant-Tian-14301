Very nice side dish or for a light dinner, which we love... Tried it twice, once as written, once with more spinach, extra garlic, red onion, much more basil ... two different tastes, and the more subtle one is no less delicious than the souped-up one. Too many too precious "chefs" on these sites -- who are they trying to impress????

This was a lot of work and not that great. Maybe my basil wasn't quite fresh enough, but this flavor was completely missing from my dish. To make it easier to puree the basil mixture, I added 1/4 a chopped tomato and a couple table spoons of water, this allowed for enough volume in the blender...and it made a tastey spread that would be great on a sandwich

I cut the recipe in half and made individual portions, in 3" cermamic dishes. I added fresh parmasan cheese to each layer and baked at 400' for 30 minutes. After a brief rest 10 minutes I tipped the containers over onto the serving plates * they held together and were fantastic with grilled lamb chops.

I made this last night and my boyfriend and I, both vegetarians, thought it was delicious. As another reviewer suggested, I doubled the garlic, but I left the basil alone. Also, I used defrosted frozen spinach and didn't salt the eggplant (modern eggplants are bread to remove bitterness so 99 times out of 100 the salting step is unnecessary). With these timesavers, this will be a standard weekday dish for me. I'd like to mention to the previous reviewer that vegetarians and vegans have a tendency to enjoy the natural flavors of vegetables more than meat eaters do because our taste buds tune in to these flavors when we stop eating meat. However, I think this recipe would make a great side dish for those omnivores whose palates are refined enough that they don't, for example, eat everything in the supermarket indiscriminately!

I made this for a vegan dinnerguest and was completely underwhelmed. I love spinach and eggplant, but found that this dish was depressingly bland. The vegan claimed to enjoy it, but I can only guess that her threshhold for delicious is severely lowered after cutting out nearly half of the food products in the supermarket.

I've made this twice, the 2nd time doubling the spinach as suggested by others. I also doubled the garlic & basil and used a red onion. Delicious and 4 forks with the changes!

This recipe makes a beautiful presentation. I used a pie dish, so it had a little flare at the bottom when inverted. I served with tomato sauce on the side. Yum.

I followed the recipe completely, even used the tips in the other reviews. Waited an hour to see what is was gonna be like. Smelled great, wish the taste matched. Maybe living in the Southwest we have different ideas about what food should be, lets just say, not even my dog would eat it. My mom tossed it out when I was at school the next morning. Egglplants have been banned from my house :(.

This is a fantastic recipe!!! I can't imagine not doubling (at least) the spinach, though. I had just enough with two bunches. As terrible as this is, not only did my grocery store did not have fresh basil, but my only food processor broke, so I used dried basil instead! Normally I would find this a travesty, but since it bakes inside the layers I did it anyway, and it came out incredible!! Two days later I had about half left, so I made pizza dough and basted it with a garlic-parmesan balsamic vinagrette, pre-baked it on a baking sheet (the pizza stome I had was too small) for about 5-10 mins. Then I spread the rest over the dough and added cheese to the top. Amazing!! The best pizza I have had in a long time! With the exception of not requiring enough spinach, this recipe is perfect!

This is a dish that takes some time but can be done easier if prepared in steps. You definetly need more spinach than the recipe calls for. I served it hot in the caserole dish, with some bread and a large salad. My husband really enjoyed it!

Amazing dish. Very impressive visually and tastes even better. I recommend using twice as much spinach though.

Delicious, full of veggies, and no saturated fat! If you like pesto, you will like this dish. Looks like a lot of steps, but you can finish everything else while the eggplant is draining, and save more time by serving it in the casserole.

This looks beautiful on a platter, I added fresh mozzarella to the last layer and like it even more. It can get watery depending on consistency of tomatoes and cheese, so be prepared to drain some juice off plate before serving.

Soaking the eggplant in salt is essential to this recipe or else it's bitter. I also added Asiago cheese and more tomatoes than it called for. It was very pretty unmolded (on a rather deep platter). It's probably very low in fat and calories...even with the added Asiago. Try it...it's easy too.

This recipe is so versatile. Leftovers can be tossed with penne pasta or used as a stuffing for rice balls.
