Just served this at a holiday party, amazing! And it was easy to boot. The longest part was carmelizing the onions which I was able to do while I working on other things in the kitchen. The crust was super easy and did not require rolling, I just pushed it out in the pan with no problems. Everyone loved this appetizer!

It's rare that I deviate from the general consensus, but I found these to be a major disappointment. The dough fell apart when I tried to put it onto the baking sheet. The blue cheese seemed over cooked. They tasted ok, but did not look very appetizing at all. Sorry gang, but I'm tossing this one out the window.

Don't skip the crust. It is delicious and very easy! I took these to a party and the guests all found them addictive. Very simple, very delicious recipe!

This is excellent and I'm trying hard now not to devour it before tonight's party! As with a previous reviewer, I didn't bother rolling out the dough first, just pressed it directly on to the baking sheet. I also doubled the sugar. I recommend this highly, although it is true that it will not be the prettiest thing on the table.

This was easy to make and a big hit with guests. Many people commented that they liked the crust...so, while I like the time-saving idea of putting it on crackers or bread, the crust was simple and tasty enough that it was worth the extra effort. Save a few rosemary tips for garnish, as the green really livens up the presentation!

I love blue cheese, so I thought this was excellent. Used the leftovers for croutons in a mixed green salad with green apple. Tasty...

This was the perfect appetizer for my dinner party. To love this recipe you need to love Rosemary, Blue Cheese and Onions. If you don't like all of these things -- you might not like it. I used good quality blue cheese and fresh rosemary from my garden and the crust came out perfect a little crusty and soft and almost pita like in the middle. Everyone though I had bought the crust at a bakery it was so good. I only could eat a few squares at a time, but perfect for the situation where its only an appetizer.

We loved this appie! I used puff pastry for the crust - docked and then prebaked for about 12 minutes. I added a good tablespoon of sherry vinegar to the onions at the end of the caramelization, used Maytag Blue for the cheese and tossed a few dried cranberries over the top before baking. Just wonderful.

I have made this recipe as stated and it was excellent. I have also substitued feta cheese for the blue and added kalamata olives and it was fantastic!

I was a little skeptical about this appetizer, however they were the first thing to run out at my Thanksgiving party. I used Stilton blue and it was a little strong, going to try Gorgonzola next time.

I liked this recipe, but I agree with the other review...it took a bit longer than I expected. I used a bunch more cheese, too, so maybe next time I'll scale back a bit since the squares seemed a bit salty. They aren't as bad-looking as I thought (and as the other reviews said) and the crust was pretty crispy and nice. I did bake the crust a few minutes beforehand and added chopped rosemary to the dough. I also used a lot more rosemary in the onion mixture while caramelizing. All in all, I liked this recipe, but hopefully everyone else agrees tomorrow :-)

I made this for our Christmas party. The recipe took a bit longer than I thought it would, but other than that, it was pretty straightforward. There's not a lot of color to it when it's on the serving platter, so I tried to garnish it with some of the rosemary. But it is very tasty, and keeps well in the fridge afterwards for a couple of days.

Good recipe. Only cooked the toppings (not the crust). Used the toppings on crackers as an appetizer. You may want to consider doubling the amount if you use as an appetizer.

The recipe may call for too much cheese. I also added a little more rosemary than called for which turned out really well.

I've made a few times and use a sheet of puff pastry-easy!I balsamic glaze the onions and parbake puff to ensure it's crisp. A no brainer app!

These had a very good flavour. I patted the crust into a 9 by 13 baking pan and then blind baked it at 400 for about 15 minutes weighted and 10 minutes uncovered. The crust was nice and crispy, not soggy at all. I didn't find the recipe called for too many onions but I might use a bit less blue cheese next time.

I made this for New Year's Eve then again for a reception. The onions took 40 minutes to carmelize but was worth the waite. I would make it again with a different crust, maybe foccacia or pizza dough, am going to experiment. It was very popular with our guests.

I found the recipe made WAY too much onion. I figured whomever wrote it knew what they were doing and used all the onion it made, but it resulted in a soggy crust. Would make again but would use two small onions, NOT three large!

Very tasty, very easy. I used baguette slices instead of the crust, so this was virtually no work.

Rating: 3
I used baguette slices instead of making the crust following another's advice. I also drizzled a little fig molasses/balsamic syrup combination on the top after baking to add a sweet/tart component. My caramelized onions always seem to take a lot longer (40 min.) than specified in recipes to get them that dark golden color without crisping. These were quite good.

Forget the crust and just place the onions and cheese on thin slices of french bread- cuts the work in half, doesn't crumble, and tastes great.

I followed this recipe to the letter, but the end result was awful! The crust was very soft (almost soggy) and tasteless. If you are determined to try this, just put the cheese/onion mixture on a Carr's water cracker or some good baguette and save yourself the disappointment of the crust!

This was very good. The crust was a tad dull, but I followed another reader's advice and sprinkled it with sea salt before adding the topping. Next time, I will add some rosemary to the crust to bump up the flavor even more. I also added some pears to the onions along with the rosemary, etc. while they were cooking. This added sweetness and helped to keep the blue cheese from overwhelming the onions. Next time I will finish with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar reduction.

How can something be sooo tasty and yet sooo ugly. My guest's loved these and devoured every one. Easy to make but just lousy to look at!

Took these to a Christmas Eve open house, and they were received with rave reviews. I followed the recipe closely, and made sure that the blue cheese was well crumbled to distribute the flavor without having huge chunk of blue cheese. The presentation was not the greatest, but the room was lit mostly with candles, and once anyone tasted the squares, they went back for more. I did not roll out the dough, but rather patted it into a 13X9 cake pan. Worked just fine. The crust was quite tasty, and I will use it again with other toppings (maybe roasted red peppers, sauteed mushrooms, etc). Three and a half forks!!!

This dish is easy to make and comes out great. In a pinch, I even used the crust as a pizza dough.

I, too, served this at thanksgiving, and it was a hit. I added a pinch of cayenne to the dough, and sprinkled the dough with sea salt before baking. I also added more rosemary (maybe twice as much?) before baking. Finally, in order to make it look more presentable and identifiable, I sprinkled an additional 1/4 cup of especially finely crumbled blue cheese on top of the squares after they cooled. Yum!

Served this dish for Thanksgiving as well and it was a big hit. Would suggest reducing the amount of salt as it did seem a bit salty. Blue cheese was the primary "flavor," onions could have used a bit more rosemary.

Rating: 1
I thought the onion and blue cheese had a lot of flavor, but was ruined by the base/crust. I thought the crust lacked in flavor and texture. I would make this again, but would probably use either pizza dough or puffed pastry. I do agree more rosemary and cheese is needed.

The onions were wonderful and I wish I'd saved them for something else. They were quite tatestles. I brought the finished "product" to work and I overheard someone as if they were moldy lemon squares---which is just how they looked.

I thought this recipe was GREAT. It was a hit at a cocktail party and at Thanksgiving. If you use high quality Blue Cheese the taste is amazing. I did double the amount of rosemary and added additional kosher salt to the dough, which made a big difference.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it ended up in the trash!! If I could give this a zero fork, I would!! I thought the whole dish was completely without taste!! The crust was too thick and bland! The topping didn't have any flavor what so ever!! Such potential, what a let down!!

Made this to take to Thanksgiving. It tasted delicious, but I didn't think the presentation was that great. I almost felt compelled to tell people it tasted better than it looked. That said, it was very easy to make and I definitely enjoyed the leftovers (reheated) the following day or two.

Made this recipe to take to Thanksgiving dinner at a friend's house. Put the squares on a oval silver platter with rosemary sprigs as garnish. Everyone raved about them. Hint - After having trouble removing the dough from the pastry board to place on the baking sheet, I rolled out the dough on a pastry cloth. I was then able to flip the dough over on to the baking sheet intact. If you like this recipe, you will probably like the Onion Puffs recipe on this website. My husband and son like that recipe even better.

I thought I would be impressed by this recipe, but I wasn't. It was boring and two-dimensional. The crust tasted like cardboard, and the bleu cheese overwhelmed the other flavors. Would not make again.

20 minues of baking time turned this appetizer almost black. It looked truly unappetizing! Suggest more like 15 minutes. Also, I was disapppointed in the taste - it seemed bland to me. Good blue cheese and fresh rosemary is expensive - but the result was underwhelming.

Made this for an appetizer for Thanksgiving Day.These are very easy to made and my quests raved how good they tasted. This served with assorted olives, and breadsticks wrapped in Prosciutto, and a pumpkin seed gouda cheese made up my hor'deurves.Make sure to use a pungent blue cheese and add a crumble or two to each square when serving.

My guests and I all loved this easy-to-make recipe. Just caramelize the onions and crumble the blue cheese ahead of time, then mix up and roll out the dough, add toppings, then pop in the oven right before your guests arrive. Actually rolled it out thinner than the 10x13 specified in the recipe, so fills out a half sheet pan. Also reheats well, and would use crust recipe for other appetizer toppings.

I've made this recipe twice since receiving the issue -- both times for parties and both times everyone asked for the recipe. So nice....take it out of the oven just before you leave the house and it's at the right temperature and ready to serve when you arrive at your host home.
