Best frosting I have ever made- used it for cupcakes, and will make a cake soon just to use this again. It tastes just like marshmallow, and is so light and fluffy - Love it Love it Love it - emailed it to friends to make too - where has this frosting been all my life ?!

Followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out out perfect. Left it for most of the afternoon in an air-conditioned room where I do my baking (We live in the tropics and there wasn't space in my fridge) and it still held its shape and consistency - just. Definitely using this recipe again.

Love it! The best frosting I've ever made! Simple,easy, and delicious. I used a glass bowl instead of metal,which was fine, but the frosting took a little longer than seven minutes...it was definitely a patience-testing recipe. The frosting was a little too sweet for my liking. Regardless, everyone at the party liked it. It generously frosted and 2 layer 9" cake, with plenty leftover. I could probably frost two cakes and still have icing leftover. Overall, I recommend this frosting.Just remember patience is golden.

This was a complete flop. It didn't thicken up or ever turn into anything resembling frosting.

Great frosting, like candy. I use this to frost angelfood for birthday cakes. I used a whisk over the stove for the first 5 minutes then transfered it to my kitchenaid and whipped it on high speed for 2 minutes.

This frosting turns out pretty fluffy & airy but looks like it will disappear in 1/2 and hour! I say too many egg whites and not enough sugar. I've compared this recipe to others on the internet and it would have a better/stickier texture if there were only 2 eggs whites used & 1 1/2 or 2 cups of sugar used.

I made this frosting without a handheld mixer and it worked fabulously. I substituted pineapple juice for the water and added dark rum and vanilla. I put a lemon cream cheese icing inside my layered carrot cake and frosted the entire outside of the cake with this. It was delicious! Everyone said it was the best carrot cake they ever had. The combo of the cream cheese inside and rum-pinneapple seven minute outside keeps it from being too sweet. I use the joy of cooking carrot cake recipe and brushed the layers with orange liquor.

To avoid an alcohol taste in your frosting, or anything else for that matter, use vanilla sugar and leave out the liquid vanilla. You can buy vanilla sugar, but it's easy to make your own. Fill a large jar with sugar and bury a vanilla bean in it. Within a week or so you will have wonderful fragrant sugar. You can use a vanilla pod from which you have scrapped the seeds out for some other use. Shake the jar once in a while to mix it evenly. When you use some of the sugar, just replace it. It's wonderful in coffee, cakes, pastry creams, everything.

This is my all time favorite frosting. Make it with vanilla paste and it is really decadent. Never make it on a humid day or it will weep.

i had so much fun with this recipe. i had baked some devils food cupcakes, topped with a yummy chocolate ganache frosting, and i thought, if only i could find some sort of creamy goodness to inject inside them, they'd be just like the hostess cupcakes of my youth. this recipe did not disappoint! so creamy with a marshmallowy taste. one altertation i DID make was reduce the vanilla extract to 1 TEASPOON after reading other reviewers' comments about the alcohol-y aftertaste. if you have a pastry bag and icing tips, you can poke a hole in your cupcakes and squirt it inside!

I've never made Seven Minute Frosting before, so I can't really tell how this recipe stacks up against others. That being said, I thought it was pretty easy to do (although seven minutes was more like ten but that probably has more to do with me than the recipe). Anyway, I wanted something sweet to go on a chocolate cake and this really did the job nicely. I would definitely recommend it for any ability level of cook. It was fun to work with, looks nice and fluffy, and tastes great. Can't ask for more than that!

Does anyone know how long this icing will last - meaning, I guess, can I make it, say, the day before it's going on the cake?

Foolproof my foot! It never got to the "soft peak" stage. It tasted delicious, though.

Loved the marshmallows in the frosting, per earlier review. Delicious!!!

not a review, but a question---just curious, this has no sugar at all?

This is great recipe, but I have to agree that the hand-held beaters make a mess! as soon as it came off my stove and cooled enough I put it into my kitchenaid and beat it there. delicious and super easy. (I left out the cream of tartar and it didn't seem to make a difference, though it did take a little longer than the recipe said it would to get fluffy.)

This is wonderful, billowy, marshmallowy, delicious icing! Highly recommend!

Based on the prior reviews, I was excited to try this recipe, and I followed it exactly, but it really turned out terrible. Its too light, definately had that "alcohol" taste another reviewer mentioned, and although was initially nice and fluffy, quickly became wet and drippy. I will not make this one again.

This is an easy and tasty light frosting perfect for richer cakes, be careful not to add too much vanilla though as it makes the frosting have a bit of an alcohol taste that isn't very pleasant.

Yummy frosting. It is like a marshmallow creme. It has the added benefit of being dairy- and gluten-free also. Don't know why more people haven't rated it. I put it on cupcakes for my son's b'day party and it was great!

Great and easy. Kids love this with angel food cake... and they'll love it even more if, after transfering bowl from pan to counter, you slowly add 12 large marsmallows cut in small pieces, beating until melted.

I followed the recipe exactly using my timer. Perfect. Tip: I used a just bearly big enough bowl as it was filled to the brim. Without thinking I raised the beaters and you should see the splatters on the back of the stove! I will definitely have to go out and buy a bigger beater bowl as this is definitely a keeper.

This is a wonderful frosting for any cake or cupcake. I tint it for my Spice Cake with Sea Foam Frosting. Always a hit!

I've never made home made frosting before, but will definitely make this again. It was so easy and held up really well in transit on a very hot Father's Day.

This is all-time classic frosting recipe. I use it on cupcakes lately to give them a festive look. Tinted pink on Valentine's Day, green on St. Pat's. etc. It has never failed and I have been making it for years.
