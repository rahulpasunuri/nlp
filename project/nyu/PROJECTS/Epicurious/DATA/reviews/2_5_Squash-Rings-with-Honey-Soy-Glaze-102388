This was easy to follow and yielded a very pretty result but I think after adding the glaze you should lower the oven temp a little. http://www.mynewlywedcookingadventures.com/2013/03/bon-appetits-squash-rings-with-honey.html?spref=fb

I really like this recipe. It's not THAT sweet and you definitely have to use acorn squash as I think butternut is too bland to go with these flavors. Also, you actually eat the whole thing rather than when you serve squash out of halves and no one ever digs all the way to the bottom! This you can peel the skin off right before serving and it all gets eaten--esp. by my kids!

We just didn't care for this recipe. It's not that we couldn't eat it, or that we had to throw it away, but the final result was such that I wouldn't want to serve it again.

I used smaller organic squash, so there was plenty of sauce, plus put in add'l ginger and less vinegar. Seems to be a personal taste thing--I don't like super-sweet brown-sugar-sauce-type squash, so this was perfect. Maybe the low- fork ratings are for those whose taste runs toward sweeter squash?

The % should have spoken for itself. Not impressed. Don't think it even could be changed to make it 4 forks.

I would definitely make this dish again. To speed up the time to prepare I actually steamed the rings in the microwave first for about 6 minutes with a few table spoons of water. I then basted and boiled the rings in the broiler. It turned out great and definitely saved time.

Well I am a big squash fan, but we didn't care for this recipe. Neither of us usually cares for the commonly used "sweet" preparations of squash so I guess that is why. We just thought this might be different because we usually love Asian-inspired flavors. But no - back to more savory squash flavors (and good old squash with butter!).

Good, would cook again. The glaze minus the honey is actually great on fish (sea bass, haddock, etc.) add cilantro.

A great recipe to make when you are not focused on cooking.

I have made this recipe frequently since it was published. Very easy and great for fall.

This was very good. I made it with acorn squash as per the recipe and loved the glaze. Well worth the effort and wonderful with the Cider-Braised Pork Chops.

Easy recipe but not even worth the small effort. There are many other butternut squash recipes that are better.

easy to make, easy to remember and easy to change, easy to add on as a side dish when guests are showing up!

I, too, used butternut squash as I really love its creamy, rich flavour. (good size for rings, too.) I left the rice vinegar out and squeezed a touch of lemon instead. Added a touch of five-spice powder which gave it nice complexity. made extra glaze and basted more than required. If you like it sweeter, add a little pineapple juice to the glaze ... Occasionally, I also slice the squash thinly, toss with glaze and bake for some better-than-potato-chips snacks. and who waits for fall/winter? I make this year-round!

I thought that this was a very good recipe for squash. I only have it 2 forks because that's how I feel about squash in general. If you're a big squash fan you'll love it. I microwaved mine for 5 min, added the glaze and baked in oven for 10 mins and it was done and didn't require further baking.

I won't put any fork value on this yet because I omitted a key ingredient -- ginger -- but I made this on the fly last night and had all the other ingredients on hand, and it was really delicious! I made it with just one acorn squash and the sauce seemed to be just the right amount (though next time I'd go very easy on the salt and pepper). I'll be trying it again soon with ginger.

Bland and boring. I wouldn't bother with it again.

A winter favorite. I made this last winter and am going to make it again today. I was surprised at some of the negative comments.

i loved this recipe. made it using butternut squash too as i didn't have enough acorn. i only wish i had made a little more of the glaze, as it was delicious and there wasn't quite enough to go around. excellent results. i would definitely make this again.

I love this recipe! It is very easy and fast and has become a fast favorite in my household. I use powdered ginger though and it tastes just as good.

Good recipe maybe 2.5 forks, but I added butter to it.

I honestly can't understand the some of the bad reviews this recipe has gotten - I made it for people that weren't crazy about squash and they loved it! I used a little less vinegar and basted the squash with the sauce as it was cooking. The result - sweet&sour, and different!

I love healthy recipes like this. Great taste and good for you. I thought this was easy to make and visually very appealing.

I used only 1 squash with the specified amount of glaze, and thought it was just right. The taste was yummy, and the dish easy to make. Plus lining the pan with foil made cleanup a snap. Will certainly be making this again this fall/winter.

I used sweet dumpling squash instead and had good results. Really enjoyed the intense flavor from the glaze. I will make this again. The method is excellent for this type of squash. Cut into rings it may dry out in the oven, covering with the foil in the beginning is the key to not having this happen. I think this same glaze would be excellent over chicken pieces done the same way in the oven.

The sauce is wonderful just for dipping fingers into. The only change I would make is to make more sauce because it seems like a stretch as is. Presentation and color are rather appealing.

I found this receipe to be good....without the vinegar. I will use this as a pretty accompanyment to any main course. It dresses up the plate and easy to make.

I thought that the squash tasted horrible! I followed the recipe exactly and neither my husband nor myself could eat it. I tried the recipe because it sounded interesting, but I would much prefer squash with just a little butter.

I'm always looking for new ways to prepare acorn squash and I'll try anything with Oriental seasonings. This one is a keeper. I wasn't looking for it to be sweet, just tasty and it certainly was! I've already passed it on to friends.

You can't believe this recipe until you try it. I can't imagine how anyone found this to be bland. It was almost too flavorful. Serve this with less flavorful dishes, because this is almost overwhelming. Also, I did not need additional sauce. I just kept basting the squash slices with the sauce in the pan. The dish ends up with sort of a sweet & sour taste.

Rating: 2
I found that I had to make more glaze than called for in the recipe, and even then it didn't give enough flavor to the squash. I also agree that the squash weren't sweet enough. I'm glad I gave it a test run before I decided to make it for Thanksgiving, because now I won't.

Very tasty! Be sure to use the foil lining on your pan or you will have a ness. Served with Pork Tenderloin, on the grill, and Spinach Salad with hot Apple Vinegar/Maple Syrup dressing. It was a great late fall dinner.

It smelled heavenly in the oven but some of my guests were disappointed that it wasn't sweet enough.

excellent way to cook squash. It's beautiful and even kids will love it. Don't try to bake it without the foil lining though.

Today is the second time we've had this wonderful side dish. I like the ease of preparation and the colorful appearance on the plate. I added just a pinch of five-spice powder to the glaze mixture and it adds just another dimension to the great flavor.
