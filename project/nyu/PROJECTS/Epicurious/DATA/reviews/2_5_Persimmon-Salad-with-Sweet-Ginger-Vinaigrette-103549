modified this recipe a bit and my husband and i both really enjoyed it.the vinaigrette was very flavorful. used nectarines and jicama instead of persimmons and water chestnuts. neither of us cared for the fried ginger strips, so we didnt use them. i didnt compose and toss the salad, rather, arranged the salad on plates, then added the dressing right before serving. we'll definitely be serving this to guests.

the salad needed more verve...it also did not last very long. you need to make it immediately before service. I would suggest adding blood orange segments, or tangerines, with the juice into the vinaigrette.
