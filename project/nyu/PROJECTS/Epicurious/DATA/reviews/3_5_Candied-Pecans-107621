I agree with the other reviewers, these taste slightly burned.

I have been looking for a successful candied pecan recipe and so far this one takes the cake. This recipe wasn't too sugary, but still had enough sweetness. Another pro was how the covering hardened. Unlike many recipes this covering dried hard and smooth, and it wasn't to strong. I used a little less sugar than the recipe called for, (which i would recommend doing if this is an added feature to a sweeter dish), and it was great! Oh and by the way, the sugar coating does not need to be a dark amber. Overall a great recipe.

These were very good and easy. Trick is to get the heat just right over a boil, but under a rolling boil.

This is really yummy with a modification I discovered by accident. I didn't cook the sugar long enough (took me over 20 minutes to get it light amber). When I was done the nuts were really sticky. So I just popped the pan in the oven for 15 minutes on 300 deg. then re-stirred and spread them out. Came out all toasty and nice! Also, you can double the amount of nuts and still have enough sugar to cover them.

I've made this multiple times and have never had it turn out badly. Watch it constantly....it suddenly will start to turn caramel color. Then it's done. Don't overcook. It does not need to be "deep amber". I make more than I need and keep the extra in an airtight jar for a week or so. I like to serve it on a salad with arugula, pear slices, minced purple onion, and shaved fontinella cheese. (I make a dressing using 2 parts olive oil to 1 part each red wine vinegar, real maple syrup, and dijon mustard) It gives a great sweet, crunchy addition and picks up the maple syrup in the dressing. Impressive for company. Sometimes this is all hubby and I will eat for dinner with a nice wine!

Very good - Very easy. A nice addition to a salad. - I left the cream of tartar out and it was perfect.

No big deal--and no good.

They turned out fine for me! Didn't use the cream of tartar and they were very sweet and did not taste burnt at all. Maybe the compaints are just from inexperience? They were probably trying to rush it and had the temp turned up too high. Carmelize the sugar w/ water at med-hi med. Toast the pecans for 5-7 minutes @ 350, then toss them in the carmelized sugar. What's the big deal???

Mine didn't quite turn out "burnt" tasting, but they did have a slightly bitter aftertaste. I'll keep looking for a recipe with a better outcome. I wanted to use mine for a lightly sweetened, delicately crispy texture for a salad. Disappointed.

Delicious!

Have often wondered how the ratings could be so different...So, here I am to say these were not worth making! Followed recipe exactly, boiled the syrup to "deep amber" color. My "tasters" said, "these taste burned"..Humm, what did I do wrong? Made some others in the oven, wonderful!

The cream of tarter is to keep the sugar/water mixture from crystallizing.

These are great, but, I have to ask - what purpose does the cream of tartar serve? anyone?
