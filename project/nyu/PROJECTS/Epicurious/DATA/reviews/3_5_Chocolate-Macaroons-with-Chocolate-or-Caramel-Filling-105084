The caramel filling is exactly what I was seeking to use in my caramel apple macarons (with the addition of apple flavoring oil). The recipe here for chocolate macarons (or "macarOOns" -- shudder) is atrocious. I can't believe the instructions actually tell you your cookies should be cracked! These are "macawrongs", not macarons. Macarons should have a smooth dome and a lovely, bubbly foot. Don't trust a macaron recipe with volume measurements instead of weight. You have to let the piped shells sit out until no longer sticky to the touch before you bake them. Chocolate macarons are tricky; you need to let the batter sit covered airtight for a few hours before piping them.

Wonderful recipe! I make it regularly for school events (make sure to label clearly so people know it contains nuts), office events and ladies luncheons, with the chocolate raspberry ganache on this website, from another macaroon recipe and it is always a hit.(Or any chocolate ganache flavored with raspberry extract.) Great use for extra egg whites.

I made these cookies extra large about the size of a New York Black and White cookie with the chocolate filling. My clients, friends and family couldn't get enough of them. They were an incredible hit. Can't wait to make them with the caramel filling next.

I've had the most success with this macaron recipe vs. those from tartelette, i love macarons, David Lebovitz, etc. Yes, the photo should be updated (should not have cracked cookies for true French macarons). I usually make 1/2 recipe with 3 L egg whites, scant 2 c. powdered sugar, 3/4 c. Just Almond Meal from Trader Joe's, 3 T unsweetened cocoa powder -- latter 3 ingredients combined in a food processor. I only pipe one baking sheet at a time, let it develop a skin/crust before baking (last night, this took 30 min.), and baked 8-9 min. in 400F oven. With 1/2 caramel recipe this yields ~2 dozen small sandwiches. They are truly delicious -- nice combo of crunch, chew, melt-in-your-mouth sweetness. And my cookies developed a "foot," one of the measures of success in the macaron world. Love it!

Four forks for the caramel filling! It's utterly delicious and EASY to make! I have looked at quite a few caramel filling recipes and they all seem laborious. Not this one. Oh, and so YUMMY!

Couldn't quite do four. Would probably give them a three and a half. They weren't difficult to make if you buy almond meal rather than grind the almonds yourself (based on weight, I used 1-3/4 cup of almond meal).

for those who want the caramel filling, the caramel liquid must be added EXQUISITELY slowly in order for it not to seize(harden and not combine) when hitting the yolk/cream mixture. If some caramel does seize, you can relax it by putting mixture back over low heat and slowly it will melt and combine with the rest of the mixture. it is a delicious filling.

would someone PLEASE tell me how to successfully make the caramel filling. tried 2x zilch the caramel crystalized as soon as it hit the egg yolk preparation. cant figure out what i am doing wrong. thanks

I haven't tried this recipe but they certainly don't look like true macarons. There are much better recipes and guides on the internet for making macarons. I've learned how to make them using blogs and they are brillant.

I'm made these for Passover and had no problem making these except it was a fair amount of work, but thought the end result was only fair and the cookies didn't have much flavor. Maybe they'll be better with the filling. I have much better results with a recipe with almond paste, egg whites and sugar.

I've made these twice now with delicious results. The first time I ended up with too much chocolate filling so I halved the filling recipe the second time around. I ended up with not enough and substituted Nutella which was fantastic. I'll skip the chocolate filling and use Nutella from now on. I found it hard to tell if the almonds were completely powdered and ended up with small bits of nuts in the finished cookie. They still tasted and looked great but next time I might grind them separately and sift them until they're truly all powder.

Pipe them small on the paper because they spread. Use two pans and bake only one pan at a time but you save time because you don't have to wait for the hot pan to cool. Have the 2nd one piped on and ready to bake.

i haven't tried this recipe but i make macarons all the time at work. if you want a smooth top and a foot, pipe them and let them dry before you put them in the oven. they need a leathery crust before they are ready to be cooked if you want a french macaron.

The macarons in this recipe come out cracked. If you have macarons in France, they are never cracked. They are smooth and have a "foot" or a separation from the bottom of the cookie to the top. (Many people here thought that was a mistake). I tried to get my cookies to come out without cracks and with that smooth, authentic look, but it seemed impossible. I cooked the cookies for 7 -8 minutes, the 11 minutes was too long in my oven. The cookies taste good, but don't look like a real French macaron. The carmel sauce was nearly impossible to make following this recipe. Not enough liquid, I ended up with crystallized sugar. I had to add a great deal more water to make it work.

Rating: 4
I processed the nuts in batches, and didn't let it run nearly enough so the texture was a little off. The flavor was excellent, though. Wasn't as time-consuming as I'd feared, and will definitely be making this again.

mmmm, read the reviews before I rated this recipe.... Decided it best I read the directions again to see if we used the right ingredients and followed the directions correctly.......yes we did. Maybe that's why they turned out so well. My daughter and I sampled some wonderful macaroons from a San Francisco specialty bakery last Christmas. Devine!!! We made this recipe and followed the directions and used the correct ingreds... The only difficulty we encountered was trying to grind all the almonds and 10X sugar in one batch. We ended up doing it in quarters and it was done in a flash. The results were as delicious as the ones we sampled in the city. I'll be making these several times this summer as summer guests arrive. Thanks again to Epicurious!!!

These cookies were amazing! The macaroons were light and the chocolate filling was the perfect compliment. Be sure to bake them until they look dry with cracked tops, one of my batches was a little undercooked and did not have the same light texture as the others. Although they are a little extra work, they are well worth it!

I made these for Passover. They were fabulous! One of our guests, who never compliments anything, came to me after dinner and asked if I had made the cookies and they were excellent.I only made the chocolate filling and used low fat milk(we don't have whole milk). I did not pipe the batter but dropped by spoonfuls on the parchment paper and that was fine. Grinding the nuts and sugar took longer than I thought, but when I did it in batches it went much quicker. I froze the few that were left and my grandchildren thought that they were really good right out of the freezer. Next time I will double the recipe so I can keep more in the freezer to have on hand.

This recipe is authentic. I have these twice and they are wonderful cookies. They are more work than an average cookie, and I wouldn't be delighted at the prospect of making them every day. But when I do have that extra energy, it's worth it.

Exactly what you are looking for if you want the Macaroons you would find in the bakeries in Europe. The fillings wer very easy...recipe is very straight forward, but I would suggest taking them out of the fridge and let them sit for a few before you try to fill the cookies, or else it will be quite difficult (if not IMPOSSIBLE with the caramel). The cookies themselves were SUPER difficult to make for me, because I didnt have the right kind of food processor (just a little chopper--tiny kitchen, have to make certain sacrifices), but after about 4 hours of work, the end product was fine. To make the process a bit quicker, I tried piping the dough (VERY sticky, by the way) onto parchment paper and then sliding that onto the baking sheet once they cooled and putting it into the oven. I think that was a bad idea, as it might have given the dough too much time to set, because none of those came out correctly. I would suggest putting the dough into the oven immediately after piping it out. If you do, you should get perfectly shaped (and delicious) cookies. Watch them like a hawk however, because they can burn easily, and you may have to turn down the heat a smidge (but not too much).

Excellent recipe. Made for Christmas party. Everyone loved them. I only made the chocolate filling. Proportion of filling to cookies was almost exact. Did not double or triple anything. I had a little trouble with the chocolate being too firm after chilling. Softened it by putting the bowl of chocolate on top of a bowl of hot water. I used a pastry bag to make it easier to top cookie.

These cookies got better and better as they chilled in my 'fridge. Since there are only two of us, we couldn't eat them all up in one day. From the recipe admonition suggesting that they should chill for "...up to 1 day..." I feared that something terrible might happen to the cookies if weren't all eaten in one day. Fear not, they held up very well. YUMMY!

Oops - I meant double the filling and triple the macaroons!

I've made these 2x now and I found that if you triple the chocolate filling and double the macaroons they come out about right for proportions of filling to macaroons. Plus, they will be so popular, you'll be glad you made extra!

Huge Hit! Everyone thought I was some kind of culinary genius. I used the caramel variation for a party for the out of town guests attending my cousin's wedding. They were all gone and I made 4 batches! They take a little practice, but definitely worth it. I spent the next week emailing the recipe to everyone that had requested it.

These were great! With the filling and the two cookies sandwiched together, they make quite a substantial cookie, so next time I will make them a little smaller. I only made the chocolate filling. It was very good, but didn't really need a full day to chill in the refrigerator before using. I made the filling the day before and had to let it sit out for an hour or so before it was soft enough to use. Next time I will make the filling the same day and let it chill for only a couple of hours.

I made these amazing cookies two years in a row for Passover. The first year, the chocolate ones were snatched up more quickly than the caramel, so past year I made only the chocolate. They are to die for. The batter is a little tricky because it is very sticky, but they look and taste wonderful. Hard to screw up.

Fabulous. Not sure what the reviewers who gave this 1 fork were thinking. The dough is very sticky but easy to deal with using a pastry bag. I agree that the oven temperature and baking time may vary - I baked for 9 minutes at 400 degrees with perfect results.

These were a hit. I made the chocolate filling and they were heavenly. I didn't have the pastry bag but chilled the dough and scooped out the dough using a teaspoon. Am about to make them again.

WOW! These are wonderful, true french macaroons. I found them fairly simple to make, they turned out even with my six year old helping. I tried the pastry bag and the scoop and found the pastry bag to work better, I made them too big with the scoop. They overcook in a second so watch them carefully. The caramel crystallized a bit because I absentmindedly gave it a stir but even so it was yummy. I'm going to make another batch with the chocolate filling.

It may be that French macaroons are the greatest gift that France has given to the world. (Maybe it was VanGogh...nah!) This recipe, while it doesn't quite rival authentic French macaroons, comes pretty close. All you need to do is follow the recipe: don't try and remove the cookies from the parchment until they've cooled (but do remove the parchment with cookies from the baking sheet immediately); don't use a silpat or waxed paper. I used a 1 Tbsp. cookie scoop (instead of a pastry bag) so that the cookies were all the same size.

I agree with other reviewers that the chocolate macaroons tasted so much like the ones I had in Paris. Very chewy and so delicious! I am not sure why other reviewers had a difficult time getting this recipe to work for them. I followed it exactly and got terrific results. One adjustment I made, though, was to turn the oven temperature down to 380 because there was some slight burning at the cookie edge when I kept the temp at 400.

I don't really cook, so I was a little nervous to make this, but the macaroons turned out to be amazing! They did take a really long time to make, but I think that might have just been me. They really reminded me of the ones we had in France. I made the chocolate filling, which I think could be good for other things too. The cookies were soft and chewy...yum! I would definately reccomend these!

Reading the negative reviews surprised me. Every time I've made these they were a hit. You have to be careful to not overcook them, but once the are combined with the filling and chilled, they're marvelous. I make them often.

Ever since we discovered the macaroons at Ladurée in Paris we've been hoping somebody would come up with the recipe so that we could recreate the experience at home. Thank you Bon Appetit for bringing us the real thing! Everybody who tries one of these awesome creations simply melts over the brilliant combination of textures and flavors -- nothing like it anywhere (except Paris!) For my second batch I added a tablespoon of instant espresso coffee crystals to the chocolate filling and although the consistency was a slight bit drier, the mocha flavor was exceptional. Also, if you don't have a real pastry bag use a heavy duty plastic freezer storage zip bag. Load the dough in, snip off one corner (half inch size) and squeeze! Works beautifully.

Maybe it is my new convection oven, but my macaroons were wonderful...had people asking me to please make them again. I did not use a pastry bag, too thick and sticky, but just dropped from spoon and evened out with finger. The caramel was a flop though. Definitely reminded me of the wonderful macaroons from Fauchon...if only I had the recipe for their Lemon ones!

A disaster. I too am not a novice baker and these were a gooey, sticky mess. They stuck to my silpats, were flat & tough. I too don't even want to bother to try again to figure out what went wrong. I never bothered with the filling and threw out half the batter after 3 attempts at baking the cookies to different degrees of doneness all failed.

Same thing here -- the cookies just puffed up a little, separated from the bottoms and no cracks!! They tasted horrible to boot. Been looking for a good Macaroon recipe and this is NOT IT!! Very disappointing.

Contrary to other reviews, this was the ABSOLUTE WORST cookie recipe I have EVER made!!& I am not by any definition, a cookie novice - for years, my Xmas tradition has been to make 12-15 different types of cookies, package them prettily & give them to friends/family. So over the years, I've tried tons of different recipes, making thousands of cookies. I've had the occasional disaster, but this glob of unusable, unredeemable mess has been the WORST. Even though I was anal about the precise measurement of the ingredients & followed the instructions to the letter, I obviously did something wrong. The tops never became "slightly cracked" as they should have. They actually rose a little & were shiny and smooth and separated slightly from the bottoms, making the cookie look nothing like it does in the picture. I tried baking one batch a bit longer than suggested & the bottoms burned before the tops reached their desired appearance &........they tasted terrible!!! I didn't even get to the filling part..why bother? I'll never know what I did wrong because I'll NEVER try these again.

Fabulous!!! I made them with the chocolate filling. Didn't bother with the pastry bag, I used a melon baller. They weren't all the same size, but I matched up similar sized ones when I assembled them. Probably because of that, I have some of the filling left over, but I have a feeling it won't be a problem!

These cookies are among the best that I make. Everyone tells me they are just outrageous. I have only made them with the chocolate filling and they aren't overly sweet or chocolately. The most difficult part is piping the macaroon cookies so that they come out uniformly round - the mixture seems to flow very quickly through a 1/2 inch tip. I think it's probably important to make sure the mixture is sufficiently cold before attempting to pipe. This is a superb recipe that requires time and patience.

I didn't try the caramel filling, just the chocolate and these tasted EXACTLY like the ones I bought every day in Paris. They were absolutely perfect in every way, a little sloppy to make, but worth the effort. They also keep very well for a long time sealed and refigerated. I took mine to Hawaii (from Ohio) and they were still great.
