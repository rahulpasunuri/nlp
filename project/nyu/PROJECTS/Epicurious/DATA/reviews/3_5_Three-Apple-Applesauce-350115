This was easy and came out great. It was my first time making the applesauce. I used Empire apples and less sugar.

I too would like to use less sugar in this recipe but since I will be canning the sauce I am hesitant to do it. I wonder if the sugar is needed for preserving. Otherwise, great recipe.

This recipe is so easy and delicious. The three different apples give it texture and flavor variation in every bite. I made it to the recipe the first time and it was really good, although it did turn dark in the canning jars. The second time I used less sugar (2C) and froze it instead of canning it. The less sugar used the less salt you suold put in. I no9ticed I did not taste the salt at full sugar but I did taste it a little with less.

Delete the salt, all of it. Way too much and totally unnecessary. I had to double the recipe (with no salt) just to accommodate the salt-lick aftertaste Tom | Tal l Clover Farm

I would have given this more forks, because the directions were excellent. However, 2 1/4 c was way too much sugar. I was leery of using that much the first time I made the recipe, so I only used 1 1/2c and it was still too sweet. The second time I made it, I used less than 1/2 c and was satisfied. It may have been that I was using farmers market apples (which are picked ripe and have a higher sugar content). If you make this recipe, don't add too much sugar to start. After you have cooked it down, taste then adjust accordingly.
