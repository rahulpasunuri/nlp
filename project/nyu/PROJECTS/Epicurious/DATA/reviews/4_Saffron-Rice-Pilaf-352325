Loved it! Made it with white rice (all I had on hand) the flavor was great. Served it with grilled salmon and brussel sprouts.

This has a pretty yellow color, but is an expensive dish with very little flavor. It makes a lot, and I don't know what I am going to do with it all, I really don't want to bring it to my dinner tonight. I am disappointed. I tried adding chicken broth and white wine to increase flavor.

This dish got wonderful reviews from the guests. I did soak the currents in HOT water to hydrate them. The party was rockin when I first started the rice cooking & I was nervous it might now cook well, but it was perfect! This will now be a go to dish for parties & fam. It's not difficult & is a nice change.

Recipe called for too much saffron,3/4 tsp. is overwhelming & ruined the dish. It gave this dish a harsh strong flavor. I'm all about 'strong flavor' but not this kind of strong, it wasn't strong in a good way. I wouldn't make again.

This is easy and delicious. I made ahead and reheated with a few drops of white wine and a little butter.

I made recipe X 1.5 and it scaled nicely. Do NOT increase the saffron though as it would surely overwhelm. Used real Spanish rice and fry those almonds good and brown for optimal flavor in the oil and prolonged crispness in the rice. Pre-plumped the currants in sherry/water. Guests raved and I am eating the scant leftovers for lunch as I write

I made this for my Morracan night dinner and it was fabulous! Very light - flavors were spectacular as a side dish to Morrocan chicken. Loved it!

Delicious & attractive company dish that goes well with any main course. I halved recipe except for the onion, and used chicken broth instead of water. After bringing rice mixture to a simmer on stovetop, I transferred it to the rice cooker and let it finish there. I fried almonds to a darker, caramel color and added them to the onions and currants (that I had soaked in water) at the last minute.

It was very mild, so if you are serving it with a dish with a strong sauce that would be good, but it doesn't stand on its own. Adding cumin helps. Not worth the cost of the saffron, I would just use turmeric next time. It was very pretty looking.

I made this for a dinner party and was told by my guests that they could not leave without the recipe. I cut the recipe by 1/2, made the rice the night before, reheated and then spooned in the almonds, currants and onions just prior to serving. My currants seemed on the dry side so I plumped them in boiling water for about 15 min. (I did this the night before too, drained and then refrigerated). Even cutting the recipe by 1/2, it generously served 4 with leftovers. Highly recommended...will become a standard in our house.

I also used raisins and added some grilled sausage to make it a main course. It was good.

I don't like raisins or almonds so substituted pine nuts, plus used some chicken stock. Very good.

Got rave reviews at our family Easter dinner with lamb and ham. The topping really made the dish.

This a keeper. It would also be excellent with grilled meats. I substituted golden raisins for the currents and used a little chicken broth to cook the rice but otherwise made it as written. I could it it by itself.

Beautiful dish. I used just a little less saffron but other than that, followed the recipe. The rice is brilliantly yellow and frosted with the currant mixture is a lovely presentation on a buffet. I made the day before and reheated in the oven covered at about 275. It was a hit.

Made this last night for Passover. Absolutely fabulous! The flavors are out of this world. I will make this again with other entrees. The rice turned out perfectly (I made it the day before and reheated in the microwave just before serving.) I added the onion/almond/currant mixture after reheating the rice and zapped it all for one more minute in the microwave. A keeper.
