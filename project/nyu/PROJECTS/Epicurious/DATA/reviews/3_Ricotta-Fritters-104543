I do acknowledge that the cheese is tricky (I used fresh)and it certainly looked nothing like the photo, but this recipe is beyond delicious. Served it at last night's dinner party to rave reviews. Do not skip the baked onions as the contrast between both items is divine!

Very Nice! Taking into consideration the other review here, I tried this dish by adding an egg, some sultanas and then rolling in batter. My oil was extremely hot, so it wouldn't break up - It didn't. Once cooked I rolled in sugar. YUMMO BUCKO

Yelp! Had to do a party on the fly; pulled up everything in the "quick appetizers" search. With ONE ingredient, this looked like a snap. But trying to form my fresh, dry ricotta into disks was a Sisyphean task--took nearly two hours, and they broke up in the pan anyway. After sampling one from my first panful, I didn't bother cooking up the rest.
