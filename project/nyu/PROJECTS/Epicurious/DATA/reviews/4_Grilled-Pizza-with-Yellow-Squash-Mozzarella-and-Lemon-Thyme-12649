A great way to use yellow squash growing like mad in the garden. I didn't have lemon thyme, so I added lemon zest to regular thyme. The lemon zest was a great addition. I also skipped the rolling out of the pizza dough and letting it sit in the fridge for an hour. After the first rising, I just rolled them out and scooped them onto my metal pizza peel and turned them over onto the grill (after brushing with garlic oil). Next time, I think that I will toss the squash with additional garlic or oil, salt and pepper.

Excellent flavors. The crust is very easy and pliable and turns out crisp and thin. I used a Selpat with a small amount of flour to roll out crust. Then placed crusts on a plate/pan separated by wax paper, covered and refrigerated. The crust will last a couple of days.

The first time I made this I liked it, but it was a bit salty. So the second time I reduced the cheese. I only used 1/2 c of mozzarella and then grated parm cheese when it was finished. Much better. You got to taste the crust, it wasn't overwhelmed.

Used fresh mozzarella and liked this recipe. Also used basil along with the thyme. Great way to use yellow squash.

This was excellent and filling! I made a few changes though -- I didn't have thyme on hand so I used basil and I caramelized the squash with the garlic (I highly recommend trying this!).

Delicious. But not the quickest the prepare after a day at work. You may want to make the dough in advance.
