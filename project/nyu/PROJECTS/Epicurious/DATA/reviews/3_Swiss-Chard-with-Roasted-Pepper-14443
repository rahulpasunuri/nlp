I sauteed the cooked kale (close enough) and roasted yellow bell pepper in some olive oil with garlic, then tossed in some cooked pasta and toasted pine nuts. With a little parmesan to finish it, it was a delicious dinner. Didn't take long to prepare, either.

Roasted pepper and Swiss Chard are a winning combination. I will add a close of roast garlic next time, just because I love the combination.
