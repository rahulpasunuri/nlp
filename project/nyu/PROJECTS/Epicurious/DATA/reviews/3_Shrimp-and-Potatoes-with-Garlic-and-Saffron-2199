Really great, super easy and tasty. I've made this a few times over the years.

This dish is great! I love the different textures of the peas, shrimp and potatoes, plus the saffron always adds a complex taste. Plus, this dish IS great the next day, which I think is an important factor in many dishes.

This is great! Been making it almost 2 decades. It can be a light or heavier meal depending on how u spoon it on plate & pairings. Sometimes make with white rice or angel hair pasta. It's a yum.

Fabulous dish. Complex flavors. Great for winter entertaining--making it a day ahead gives the ingredients time to "marry", and gives the host/ess the chance to be a guest at the party!

After reading the earlier reviews that this recipe lacked zip, I tried using diced tomatoes and tomato liquid and roasting (rather than boiling) the potatoes. It was still bland.

Very simple and produced a tasty sauce. Used thyme out of neccessity and popped in a bay leaf, my only variation. Very pretty too.

I used chopped up tomatoes instead of tomato paste and that gave the dish more texture--also cooked shrimp in the oil until colored before adding the tomato. I also used thyme instead of marjoram and it became an excellent one dish dinner.

Quick, easy, and delicious

While the ingredients and method looked promising, something didn't meld? No one in the family liked it. It may be a good base for changes, such as used diced tomatoes instead of paste, less saffron, more heat.
