I turned this into vegetarian dish by using Trader Joe's Soyrizo. It was fabulous. I crumbled the Soyrizo into the dish, since you cannot slice it and I used vegetable broth. My family loves this recipe.

This was a wonderful way to shake up the idea of pasta bake. I can only give it 3 forks, though, because of the modifications I made. I used 1 full cup of white wine, 1/2 a red pepper instead of green, 1 can of chopped tomatoes (drained), 2 cans of chicken broth, wasn't able to get the chorizo to stay in rounds so they just kind of dissolved in the liquid, used fideo pasta-2 boxes, threw in some shrimp at the end and then baked for 25 minutes. It was mushy by then but the flavor was good. I also topped the casserole right out of the oven with finely shredded Manchego, which also made the leftovers absolutely desirable. This made a full pan of 9X13 pyrexware. I might make it again, someday, it was a good Spanish casserole and I love Spanish food.

I modified this recipe quite a bit to fit what I had in my fridge/pantry. We also eat a lot of vegetarian food, so I decided to skip the sausage. I used half a green pepper and half a red pepper and mushrooms for the vegetables. I also used smoked paprika and red pepper flakes in place of sweet paprika and cayenne, again based on what I had on hand. I also added a pinch of saffron when I added the seasonings. I followed one user's suggestion to use diced tomatoes, which saved some time. I added a little extra white wine. Overall, I thought this dish was delicious. My husband isn't a huge fan of green peppers, so I will probably leave those out next time. I also think the smoked paprika added a little too much smoky flavor and overpowered the saffron. Next time I will use sweet paprika. Otherwise, it turned out perfectly. We ate it all! Will definitely make again.

Good; nice alternative to Italian spaghetti. Put queso fresco on top. Used only 8 oz pasta & 2 C broth; worked great. Still made a lot; will cut in 1/2 next time.

We first cooked this in 1996. Loved it then and still love it. Kids love it too. My husband makes his own chorizo which is just amazing. We add extra. I like a little extra wine and I use wild mushrooms. One pan, so easy clean up.

Very good! I added some crumbled feta on top which made it even more delicious!

After reading the reviews of this recipe, I decided to try it, with the following changes: I used 20 oz. of Italian sausage since chorizo is too spicy for us. Also took the suggestion of using canned diced tomatoes,I increased the wine to 1 cup, and used orecchiette pasta. Topped the finished dish with fresh grated Parmesan cheese. The result was really very good and had an interesting flavor which we both enjoyed. When I make it again, I will use a smaller amount of pasta, as I would prefer more sauce. But this was a keeper.

I really liked this recipe, primarily as a new technique for cooking pasta. This taste combination was good, but I could easily see it adapted for more Italian flavors, such as Italian sausage, Italian seasonings, diced eggplant, etc. If I make this Spanish combination again, I will make sure to use all of the olive oil (I skimped), and will add a quickly sauted summer squash or other vegetable to add color and moisture. I will also add a couple of chicken thighs, cooked and chunked, for variety. I added about a cup of frozen cooked shrimp before it went in the oven, and it was delicious.

This seemed like an awful lot of onions to me, but they did not overpower the dish. It was good; not great. Definitely helped by topping with parmesan before serving.

I didn't want to bake this dish, so I just used all ingredients and did a pan fried version. Pasta was boiled seperately and mixed together at the end. Great dish, with lots of flavour.

This was a bit different than the normal recipe that I cook, and I loved it. I used my own chicken broth, which added some salt, and I also used a stronger pasta(pipette) to prevent it from becoming "mushy". I covered the dish on the stove at the end to make sure the pasta cooked fully and I also used smoked turkey kielbasa which added a nice smokey flavor to the dish. I recommend this to everyone, it was delicious, and a super leftover. The only thing I would change would be to use drained diced tomatoes because peeling them took a decent amount of time. Enjoy!

My kids loved this, but my husband and I were just lukewarm. The flavor was nice (although I wished it was a bit spicier). I think the reason for the disparity is that the finished dish had the consistency of canned spaghetti (which, to my regret, the kids love!). I may not have gotten the cooking time just right (although I followed the recipe). I don't know that the pasta needed to be fully tender before baking or if maybe the baking needed to be longer, but either way this was just too mushy for me. Maybe with a sturdier pasta (penne, farfalle, etc) it would work better.

This is a wonderful dish--a crowd pleaser. Just wanted to clarify that Cataluna is in Europe, not South America.

Holy cow, this was good! I had some linguica I needed to use up. This sounded interesting, but I didn't expect it to be so good. And I was skeptical about there being no salt in the recipe, but it was delicious without.

Great South American recipe that is easy to prepare. I changed the recipe a little: 1 T. olive oil, 2 t. jarred minced garlic, halved the mushrooms, 15 oz. canned tomatoes cut into bit size pieces (with the juice), bite-size pieces of bell pepper, 3 chicken bouillon cubes dissolved in 3 c. water, and cooked in a deep cast iron skillet I served it with a side salad and hot home-made crescent rolls. This is one of my husband's new favorite recipes. Enjoy! pamela

Have made this recipe many times and love it. I make it in a dutch oven, only use 8 oz. angel hair pasta, drained cut-up canned tomatoes and add a lot of cayenne pepper. The last time I made it it had to sit for an hour before serving and it was wonderful and still hot.

Even using fresh ingredients, I did not care for this recipe. There are many others I would explore before coming back to this one.

This recipe is incredibly easy and, using only the freshest ingredients (I use organic foods when available)it is also incredibly good. Since I don't have a deep paella pan, I used a cast-iron dutch oven with good results. I spiced it up a bit with some fresh, minced cayenne pepper. This would be a great pot-luck or buffet dish!

Very tasty - the kids even loved it:) I suggest using canned tomatoes - the 15oz size, plus I added salt and pepper, before putting it in the oven. Furthermore, I found that sprinkling parmesean cheese on the top when serving, added a good finish to it. I served corn on the cob with it and garlic bread goes well too.
