This is definitely one of my family's favorite chicken soup recipes. I substitute 2% milk for heavy cream though and don't miss it at all. Sometimes, I'll add diced carrots in as well since my toddler loves carrots.

Delicious soup. Very elegant without being at all arduous to make and also a gets high marks on the comfort food scale. I followed the advice of another reviewer and doubled everything but the chicken and ended up with more of a very good soup, plus tons of leftover chicken to make chicken salad with. Seems like a strange ratio. You could make the original recipe and halve the amount of chicken and have a plenty hearty soup. Also couldn't get decent looking parsley so I substituted some fresh basil and it was lovely. Great soup. We'll definitely make it again.

excellent soup. i had two leftover roast chickens and also substituted water + bouillon for broth. I added some celery and did chives instead of parsley. very delicious.

Okay...I have to tell you that this soup was not even the slightest bit tasty. I made it exactly as written, and it was such a disappointment. I had waited until the first cool rainy day (today) to make a good new soup. This one is NOT it. Very bland and the 10 snow pea pods were not even visible. I will not be making it again. Sorry

No peas, wild rice cooked a bit longer instead and a bit of basil instead of parsley - very good.

p.s. also used cilantro instead of parsley. Yum! (But I like it either way.)

This has been my favorite soup for about a year now. Simple, quick, and tasty! It has wowed all who encounter it. I always use organic products whenever possible, and I just made it with non-organic products and the difference in taste was very, very noticable, especially with the cream & chicken. I like to toss in a few cloves of garlic with the lemon zest, and I also tossed in some capers at the end this time around. A very nice addition!

A little bland. Perhaps some herb would help (fresh basil? parsley? cilantro?) And I think the pea pods are not a felicitous choice. Perhaps a little spinach? I won't make this one again without some serious tinkering.

Really great soup recipe. I doubled the ingredients and followed the recipe exactly. Will take the reviewers advice to sub whole milk for cream to see if I can achieve the same results with a lighter version next time.

This is one of my all time favorite recipes and I am not normally a big soup fan. I too added garlic to the chicken while simmering and added extra lemon. I have to double or triple the recipe so I can have leftovers.

Excellent recipe. I doubled the broth and put in a handful of cheese tortellini because i just couldn't make chicken soup without some sort of noodles. I'll probably double or triple recipe next time around for leftovers.

Yum! Be careful with the lemon. I used juice from the entire lemon and it was pretty potent but still tasty. Next time I will add a teaspoon at a time. Also, to try to cut fat (and heavy cream is so expensive here!) I put in about 3/4 cup whole milk and let it reduce while constantly whisking until it was somewhat thick. The results were quite nice.

This soup is addictive. The more broth you eat, the more you want. I added garlic while the chicken simmered, otherwise, followed the recipe. Really good. (I tasted the chicken as I was cuttinig it up and it had a nice lemony flavor and it made me think, mmm, good way to start a chicken salad.)

I rarely make recipes more than once. I like to try new recipes all the time and only make them again if they are exceptional. This one fits the bill. I quadrupled the recipe and my husband raved about it even as leftovers. I did make a bit more roux (with whole wheat flour) and added garlic as some others suggested. I am sure my husband and the friends that were over will ask for it again.

Don't leave out the peas!! They add such great crunch and texture to this soup. I just made this soup again for the second time, and it is absolutely a nectar of the gods!!! Delicious! Pay attention to the recipe, because it only makes enough for two. Like liquid heaven!!!

Absolutely delicious!! Left out the peas, but added rice for more substance. Yummy

I followed the advice of the cook from Rochester, and left out the peas because I really don't like them, and everyone loved it! This soup's definitely a keeper...

This was one of the best recipes I've tried on this site. Normally, I get incredibly annoyed with people who write reviews about changing the recipe, but I exchanged basil for parsley and it was excellent!

The easiest way I found to make this delicious soup was to use canned broth and jazz it up. I added a quarterd onion(no need to peel), smashed garlic clove, rough chopped celery, parsley and carrot when cooking the chicken breast in the broth with lemon peel. I love the texture. Not too thick and not to thin, although I added an extra tablespoon of butter and flour to the roux.

WOW! This is a great soup. Out of 21 meals a week I eat soup about 5-7 times per week. Have been doing this for about 35 years. I am always on the lookout for a good soup recipe. I doubled the recipe except for the amount of chicken. I used one full breast. This is not a cream soup, it is a true velvet texture - between thin and cream. After adding the heavy cream I simmered for 10 minutes instead of 2. I also added 3 TBLS of lemon rather than 1 or 2 tsps. This soup has a delicate flavor. Don't be tempted to add a lot more snow peas than listed - it can take over the flavor. Even my 7 year old loved it. Yummy. Give it a try.

This easy delicious dish pleased everyone in my family and is now becoming a Christmas Eve tradition. I don't add peas because my husband doesn't like them. I also added fresh ground pepper (it makes all the difference). The preparation of the roux is very important to the smoothness of the soup. Thanks Bon Appetit!

I liked the lemon flavor of the soup. Will make it thicker next time. This is a save recipe.

Surprisingly good. I found it very flavorful, and far from bland. I did add a small amount of rosemary and basil, but it was at the end, so I don't know how much they added. Next time I might use a little less cream, but then, I'm not a big fan of dairy products.

Because of other's comments that this soup was a little bland, I added a little extra lemon . . . And ended up with a soup that was SO lemony that my husband and I could barely eat it! And I mean I added just a little more than the 1 teaspoon, maybe 1 1/2 teaspoon. Also, it was quite thin. Doesn't anyone know of a recipe for plain old CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP? That's what I was hoping this might be.

I thought the soup was a little thin, so I added a little flour (dissolved in water) while whisking. It was "velvety" but I thought the snow peas added too much bitterness, weird with the cream of the soup and the acidity of the lemon. My boyfriend loved it, though, and with a big hunk of bread, this was a full meal. I thought it was too much work for what it was. Use lots of ground pepper!

The soup needed to be a little thicker with more flavor in the broth, onion added at the chicken cooking step. I would make it again with these changes

I made a double batch and used it as the first course for a party of 8- - - everyone loved it so much I should have made twice as much! It was easy, smooth as silk, and very delicious.

Great soup even the kids enjoyed! Easy to prepare, I added extra lemon for more flavor and lots of fresh ground black pepper!
