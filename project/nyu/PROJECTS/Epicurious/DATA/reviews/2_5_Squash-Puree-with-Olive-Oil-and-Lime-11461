A creative way to prepare squash, but the lime is very overpowering. I would add it last, to taste.

This was a creative way to serve squash for a family that doesn't love it just plain baked. However, I would definitely hold back on the lime juice. Add it last to taste, as is it much too overpowering.

Not a big hit with me or my husband. The lime causes the squash to take on a bitter taste.

I made this exactly as directed by the St. Paul cook, and it was a major hit. Even my fussy parents, who like vegetables just as they are, really enjoyed it. So easy to make. A keeper for sure.

Surprisingly good. The lime juice really brightened the taste of the squash. I used butternut as the market didn't have the type called for. Served with jerk chicken, black beans,and yellow rice. Salad of shaved red onions and oranges.

The lime adds a nice brightness to the squash. I made this recipe a bit differently; I roasted the squash, coated lightly w/ olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper, in a 400 F oven for an hour. Then I just mashed the roasted squash with half a lime and extra salt and pepper to taste. Very easy, and everyone liked it.
