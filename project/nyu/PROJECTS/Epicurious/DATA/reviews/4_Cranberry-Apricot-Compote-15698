Made this for the first time today. I thought this recipe was really different. Overall, the recipe came out great. My only issue was that adding the shallots raw directly to the compote ends up making them sort of crunch by the end. I think I would prefer to maybe lightly saute the shallots first so that they are a little softer before adding them to the end of the cooking process. But the taste was fantastic.

Just made this today for tommorow's big turkey meal. It is really, really, delicious. Tart and sweet, tangy, YUMMY. Much more sophisticated than your average out-of-the-can sauce. And it could NOT be easier to make, so unbelievably simple, your guests will be wowed. As suggested by other reviewers, I cooked the shallots in the sauce for the last few minutes to soften them a bit. Enjoy!

This one is a keeper. I made it for the first time when it appeared in Gourmet several years back and I turned to it again this Thanksgiving. It's so wonderful and so easy! I halved the recipe this time, and it was fine. I'll try to find menus to include this compote so I can have it even when it's not Thanksgiving!

I made this as a garnish for duck confit at our wine class dinner-as it was a second course didnt want too much on the side and this was enough to fit the bill. Sweet and tart-perfect autumn fare.

Such reward for so little effort! A hit with everyone ~ even avowed cranberry loathers. (This one is even better than my mom's ~ shhh...)

This has become a staple at our thanksgiving table over the past few years. It is simple, and delicious and has turned the head of those who say they don't like cranberry sauce. I add the shallots about midway through the cooking of the cranberries to soften them a little.
