Even very ripe bananas are delicious in this, and I usually throw in blueberries as raspberries are harder to find. Sweet, sour and crunchy all at once!

Not only does this taste and look great, but when I have it for breakfast, it keeps me energized all morning and is great after a workout. I made it for people at work and it disappeared fast!
