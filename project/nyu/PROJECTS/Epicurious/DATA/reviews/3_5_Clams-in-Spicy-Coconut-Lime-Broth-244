As a teenager with a busy schedule, I kind of had to force myself to make time to cook this dish. I was expecting it to take at least an hour to make, but, to my delight, I was done within half an hour. I altered the recipes by leaving out the jalepeno and the scallion (my mother hates both), but adding twice the coconut. No clam juice or shallots, either. The end result was pretty good and reminded me of a Singaporean restaurant in my neighborhood. My only complaint was that the broth was a little too intense - not spicy intense, but intense like eating too-dark chocolate. If there were a way to water down the broth that didn't alter the flavor, I would.

just made this with a bag (maybe 5 lbs) of fresh clams from Costco. I didn't have bottled clam broth,nor would I use it anywasy,not necessary. I used one can of cocnut milk, the only other liquid was from the tomatoes ( blended cherry tomatoes and their juice), I had my chives from the garden to garnish. Wonderful!

I didn't really make this as stated, but as a basis for something slightly different. I omitted the tumeric, cumin, tomatoes and clam juice and added fresh lemongrass, thai fish sauce, palm sugar and fish stock. It was delicious and I am making it again tonight.

Wow, fast, easy and delish. Used Ro- tel tomatoes with jalapenos as didn't have any fresh and added fresh cilantro and basil at the end along with the green onions. Also, increased scallions and ginger, next time will add garlic.

This was very easy and delicious. I subbed green onions for shallots as hard to find where I live and also 1 cup prepared salsa for tomatoes and jalapeno. It had a great heat to it and the flavors blended beautifully. I will make this again.

The clams came out alright. I had so much left over broth that I decided to throw in some crab and other shellfih and it was wonderful. I will make this again but instead of claim I'll use crab!!

This was my first clam dish and it turned out very good and appealing. There was something about the clam juice that I used that irritated my taste buds- but I probably used a few tablespoons too much of it. This dish will taste much better if the curry is made a bit thicker. Will definately make it again.

Excellent Thai flavor and visually very attractive. Adding a little fresh lemongrass improves even more. I have made 3 times and it is fabulous and tasty and visually pleasing every time! Delicious served over jasmine rice in a large soup bowl.

just so-so.

I would actually give this 3.5 forks. I have made this twice in a short time span, as everyone raves. The second time, I increased the jalapeno (you need to play to your audience!) and added mussels. This was for a large group. The mussels decreased the expense and enhanced the flavor.

very easy and all the spice complemented each other. I would definately do this as an appetizer again. Good dipping with some french bread as well!

I love this dish! I didn't have clam juice so I left it out, used light coconut milk and added scallops. YUM. My jalapeno was fresh and added just the right amount of spice. I can't wait to make this again!

I love this recipe. I added some hot chili oil because my pepper was not hot enough. Next time I will add some more lime juice and also some chopped cilantro leaves. I served over fresh asian noodles. Very interesting flavors!

This was a great recipe. I served it with some pansit noodles, which was a great complement, and because everyone asked for bread to sop up the broth, I served some naan. I would recommend more clams than the recipe calls for, as I'm always disappointed when I remember how little meat you get out of 2 pounds of clams. I would think that those people who found this too mild could simply add the seeds of the jalapeño, or use a hotter pepper such as serrano.

Pretty bland. Kept adding more of eveything to get some flavor. Finally added some crushed red pepper which jazzed it up. Maybe my jalepenos were weak ones.

i made this dish twice and both times were terrific! couldn't get enough of the broth!

A great recipe. I've made it couple of times and everyone loves it. I made a few changes after the first time that my family thought improved the taste. I used the whole can of coconut milk, an extra jalapeno, the zest from the whole lime and substituted chicken broth for clam nectar which seemed to give the flavour a bit more depth.

Fantastic!! This dish has become our "house clam" recipe-we live in Southeast Alaska, so I dig my own steamers in the winter. I switched curry powder for turmeric, added two dried kaffir lime leaves, and added some flat champagne (leftover from NY's eve) to the bottle of clam juice. Awesome!! Even my clam hating friends were drinking the broth like it was orange juice...very highly recommended!!

I love clams, but really didn't think this recipe had much flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 2 jalapenos. It looked wonderful, but have made other clams dishes I prefer. Maybe if I would have reduced the sauce to thicken it up and concentrate the flavors before adding the clams it would have been better.

Wow! this was a great dish, I think you dont do it justice just using clams! I used clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops and calamari. Just put the calms and mussels in first, then the rest in a few minutes before serving. I also threw in a few extra chopped green onions at that time. Awesome and really pretty easy to make.

A wonderful dish! I made the recipe for my husband who loved it, but there was definitely only enough for two people.

Absolutely delicious!! I substituted garlic for the shallots since my grocery store didn't have them. I also left out the jalapeno since my guest does not like spicy food. Served it all over rice. I think the turmeric really makes it. Don't leave that out!

This went over very well. Next time, I will make the whole recipe plus half again as much. This made 2 large servings, a medium serving and just barely a serving for me. I threw in some lemon grass and while nice, I don't think it added anything. Otherwise, I followed the recipe.

A recipe definitely deserving of 4 forks rating... it is simple, quick, easy and most importantly, tastes great. I've already made it twice this week and it will be a staple in my files. The second time i made it, i made into more of a risotto which helped to give the whole dish a thicker consistency. It was just as good! I may try to put in either some lemon grass or kaffir lime leaves next time for an even better aroma.

Fantastic! I can't say enough good things about this recipe! I doubled the recipe, since I had dinner for six. It doubled just fine. This is a beautiful, delicious, intriguing dish that is simple and relatively quick to prepare -- and it's very impressive. I will make this often and add it to my list of "pet" recipes. Bravo!

This is a delicous dish with plenty of fresh lime flavor. I, too, added a full can of coconut milk. We ate the clams and broth over steamed rice; my husband loved the dish as much as I did. I plan to make this again soon.

What a wonderful mix of flavors! Even the kids liked the clams (although they didn't want the broth). I plan to add a bit more jalepeno or red chiles next time. We served it with crusty bread as an appetizer but I will definitey try it with pasta.

my husband I love clams and mussels, especially when there is plenty of sauce to dip a nice hard bread into...and this recipe was excellent. I used a whole 10oz can of coconut milk instead of just a cup and the zest of teh whole lime (about 2.5tsp) and a tad more lime juice. There was alot of broth left over because we didnt use it over pasta altho that would have been a great use for it, so the next night I cooked mussels in it...very good
