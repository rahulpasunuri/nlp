Prepared exactly as the recipe says, this was inedible. It was so sour as to bring tears to the eyes. Hoping to salvage it, I added another cup of sugar, a half cup of chopped pecans (for texture) and an 8-ounce can of crushed pineapple. It will be edible now, but it certainly isn't this recipe any more. This is one of the worst recipes I've ever gotten off Epicurious.

My 4-star rating is contingent on one piece of info that was not in the instructions: make this cranberry sauce at least TWO DAYS in advance (as suggested by other reviewers). I have never made cranberry sauce myself but have consumed a great deal of it. Since I was making Thanksgiving dinner this year, I decided to give it a go. I made this on Tuesday night before Thanksgiving and tasted it the next day- the flavors were sharp and overwhelmed by ginger and pepper. By Thursday, however, the flavors had mellowed considerably to produced a delightfully tart and sweet sauce with hints of pepper, orange and ginger. Delicious and easy. To save time I used an orange zester, which also lessens the risk of including any pith (white part of the peel) that will add a bitter taste. Will become my go-to cranberry recipe!

Excellent. It's become a tradition for me to make this each year.

Perfect in every way. Barely any leftovers; should have made more.

I omit the pepper but am otherwise in love with this stuff. So is everyone else who tries it.

Terrific, I always make enough to last me the entire year.

The flavors in this recipe are definitely wonderful together. However, there is entirely too much pepper in it. I will still serve the batch I made, but I'm making another cranberry relish too. I will also make it again, but with half the white pepper the recipe calls for or none at all. Some of my guests will not be able to take the spicyness of it.

I just got finished making this 10 minutes ago and I can already tell you it's going in the family cookbook. My 21 month old just tried and it keeps asking for more! Wonderfully easy. Use a fine cheese grater for the orange zest and the ginger. EASY EASY.

Delicious!! I too had never made cranberry sauce from scratch, but now I am a believer. My only recommendation is to make this a day or two in advance so that the flavors can meld together, and it can congeal. This will be a Thanksgiving staple.

fellow epicures, look no further, this is the relish for you! this is excellent! while time intensive, the julienned orange zest is well worth the labor. this is a delish and beautiful relish. i would say use no more than 1/2 cup orange juice, even if you have more. If your family are ginger lovers, like mine, reduce the white pepper somewhat and add a dash of ground ginger (which adds heat and gingerness).

I make this every year for thanksgiving and Christmas and it's a favorite. I prefer to use pink peppercorns to white - gives it a sharper flavor.

I doubled this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and had a mild panic attack when it turned out so thin. Thanks to the advice from other cooks I scooped out the berries, boiled down the juice with some Cointreau, and then added them back in once there was less liquid. I had also worried that the white pepper would be too strong but after a night in the fridge this dish was perfect on Thanksgiving Day. It was a big hit and everyone wanted the recipe!

I make this relish every Thanksgiving - delicious! If you have never had fresh relish, you must try this recipe. Recruit a helper when making, the citrus peel takes some time but is well worth the effort.

I made this for Thanksgiving in '03 and I think it was the best dish on the table.. Yummy!

This was easy and yummy. It complements rosemary lambchops perfectly, with a side of yams or mashed potatoes. The relish keeps like jam in the refrigerator, just be sure to always use a clean utensil when dishing it out.

Definitely make this ahead--on Monday or Tuesday. The flavor is much better after a few days, and it lets you get something out of the way. I made it last year, and it was great, so I am doing it again this year. Didn't change a thing.

This is the best cranberry sauce I've ever tasted! I didn't have white pepper, so I omitted it - it was still great. It can also be frozen and used at Christmas.

Loved this recipe and convered my hubby's "slide the jellied sauce out of the can, put it on the table while still in can-shaped form" family on Thanksgiving. You do need to like ginger, so this isn't for everyone. It's strong, tart, and very satisying if you are a cranberry lover. I took the entire peel from the first orange and chopped it in the processor, so my version was quite orange. Again, not the version that will please everyone but for us cranberry junkies out there, it's a great one to put on file.

I thought the relish was a little too gingery. Next time I make it I will cut the ginger portion a little. My family really liked it the way it was.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe for a Thanksgiving must-have that people actually don't like all that much. This version is outstanding, and people actually did like it -- not icky-sweet, but piquant and fresh, the condiment it's supposed to be. The orange-julienne is pretty, and easy to cut very fine (this from someone who hates to julienne).

Great tasting and easy to make! Turned over some jellied can lovers over to this recipe!

This was very tasty - just made it this morning. I used large oranges, so the liquid was a bit too much... be aware that midway through boiling the concoction down, it might be wise to use a slotted spoon to briefly scoop the berries out (once they've split and reached that great 'whole cranberry' cranberry sauce taste)... while the liquid boils down a bit. I liked the orange zest taste so much I added a shot of cointreau (after briefly scooping out the berries during boil-down). It's a nice touch.

This sauce is so yummy, and my mother in law actually asked me for the recipe (that's a BIG deal!) I don't know why anyone thinks this is bitter, but they likely screwed it up. I have made this at least 10 times and it always comes out yummy and sweet/tart.

Wonderfully distinct from the tinny store-bought version. Quick, simple. Our international family loves it because it's not too sweet - and they like the 'bite'. How do I know? They keep asking me to make it.

Rating: 3
Everyone loved it! Not too sweet; I added an extra teaspoon of ginger, great for ginger lovers.

I thought this was an excellent cranberry sauce--perhaps the people who found it to be bitter included some of the white pith from the orange peels, rather than just the orange part.

This cranberry relish looks beautiful on the table. It was fun to watch the lemon juice and sugar carmelize. Everyone here agreed that it needed more sugar. The ginger taste is nice.

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner this year. It was so bitter and the consistency like paste (I'll admit here that I may have over cooked it) that everyone took one bite and refused to eat more! The entire recipe, minus a few bites, went in the trash immediately following dinner. Horrible!

Rating: 3
I enjoyed this recipe very much, but I had my doubts that it would turn out. The first time I over-cooked the sugar. I'm still not sure at what point is best to throw the orange zest in. It did not sugar coat it as I expected. However, my end product did look like the picture after letting the end product cool in the pan for an hour or so. Next time I'd add a tad less orange zest.

Very easy and delicious.

I made this with fresh cranberries for Thanksgiving and was disappointed. It was very labor intensive and the orange peel and the ginger made it very bitter. I had to remove some of the peel and add honey in order to make it taste so-so. I think there are much better and easier cranberry recipes out there.

Rating: 4
This was an easy, but very tasty, addition to my Thanksgiving Day table. Even the in-laws enjoyed it.

Rating: 3
I agree, overpowering orange flavor - mostly from the julienned peel. I would reduce amount of peel by half, at least. Also, although it was delicious, I think it is a bit labor intensive for the end result.

Rating: 3
Great recipe, very easy. As I used a citrus zester to collect the zest, I took from BOTH orantges rather than one, as well as the juice from both oranges. I also doubled the amount of fresh ginger (grated it on my ginger grater rather than julienned - gets rid of those annoying strings). I also had the opposite problem other cooks seemed to have - my relish got VERY thick when the cranberries were added; guess it was because they were frozen and the caramelized sugar was hot. Anyway, I just added more orange juice and cooked to what I thought was the right consistencey. Must have been, as there was VERY little left after dinner last night. I also agree with the cook that suggested making it a couple of days ahead - big difference in the taste.

I just finished making this and it was very easy to make! However, my finished product looks nothing like the picture. How do I get the relish to be as thick as the one in the picture? Right now it's very watery.

I made a double batch of this last night (a few days ahead for Thanksgiving). It smells and looks really beautiful. I only used half of the white pepper recommended, and also added a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin, as it looked a little too loose.

Rating: 4
I initially wrote a so-so review of this condiment but this is better after a couple of days. I made it the day before but the flavors hadn't had sufficient time to meld. Prepare it at leasts two days prior and it will taste much better. But, for my taste, it has too much white pepper. I would definitely reduce the amount by half. The candied orange peel gives it a nice added flavor but I used the juice of one orange otherwise I think the orange flavor would be too overpowering.

I, too, had never made cranberry relish from scratch. It was easy, delicious and got rave reviews from everyone at the table! My boyfriend who's not a cranberry fan loved it and had a second helping the next day with leftovers.

This is the first year we have ever had real cranberry relish. My guests loved it! My husband put his addition to the table-the canned crannberry sauce, and everyone died laughing! This recipe is a must and I will make it every year from now on.

I can't believe that someone would substitute canned cranberry sauce for the real deal. Personally, I love homemade Cranberry relish -- it's a terrific foil to all the savory dishes at the table, and the ginger and orange add great flavor layers. I recommend this recipe to anyone!

This dish is wonderful. Everyone enjoyed it. That's why I'm making it again this year.

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and opinions are often influenced by circumstances. I am currently living 3500 miles from my childhood home, and the holidays make me particularly homesick. The smell and taste--even the preparation--of cranberry relish is definitely worth the work for me. And I DO eat cranberry relish--it's one of my favorite parts of Thanskgiving dinner!

Why go to all the fuss over making this. No one eats the relish anyway. Just use the canned version. It's faster and cheaper
