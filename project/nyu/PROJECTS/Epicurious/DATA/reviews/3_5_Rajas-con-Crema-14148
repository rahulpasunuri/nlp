This post has nothing to do with the actual recipe. I live in Northern California where there is a huge Mexican community. 2 brands of Crema aka Table Cream (NOT sour cream) are available. Neither come in a tub. Both come in a plastic mayonnaise type jar in the refrigerated section. I have tried both El Mexicano & the other one (can't remember the brand). They taste the same. Good luck!

Great recipe. For those discussing crema varieties, I don't know if its available in the US, but Mexicans actually prefer crema in a can. I know, it sounds awful- but there was this one brand I grew up with (and I come from a family of serious Mexican gourmet cooks!) always came out of a can. The only cream we got in a yoghurt-like cup was sour cream. I suggest adding corn kernels, it adds a wonderful flavor and texture contrast. This is fabulous in tacos, all by itself, if you can get ahold of GOOD fresh corn tortillas (easier said than done in the US!).

This was outstanding. I used 6 large poblanos and there was PLENTY of heat and flavor in this! We served the rajas with the "Grilled Garlic Marinated Steak with Lime" listed on this site with a bit of cilantro and cabbage on corn tortillas. We couldn't get enough! SOOO delicious. I used heavy cream, but will look for Crema Mexicana next time.

I have a recipe from El Naranjo in Oaxaca for rajas con crema. It also includes some queso fresco. This recipe doesn't. I can't imagine rajas con crema without this addition.

These were delicious. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added a chopped clove of garlic and a red pepper (beautiful colors) and then added a couple pinches of chipotle flakes to zip it up a bit. These will definitely be on my Cinco de Mayo menu.

This is the second time I've made rajas con crema. This time, I tried to punch it up a little by adding a minced clove of garlic and some grated Cotija cheese...still blah. I've had this in Mexican restaurants and I liked it..it seems simple enough..I guess I just don't get it.

? what happened to the review I just submitted

I found this one when searching for a new recipe for Fajitas. It reminded me of a great Mexican creme soup made with roasted poblanos,so I gave it a try. My original plan was to use it as a topping for grilled chicken, but ended up needing a heartier dish,so turned it into a casserole/hot dish with grilled chicken, whole wheat penne, chicken broth, sour cream and cheese. It was a hit! Maybe next time I'll try the original taco's it was meant for.

I used Mexican crema as suggested by the other reviewers, and I mixed red bell peppers in with the poblanos. Delicious.

I've missed Rajas - since I gave up dairy years ago. My sweetheart suggested using coconut milk instead of heavy cream. And I think it's better! The coconut milk lends a sweet & tropical flavor. Try it with this easy recipe! My friends loved it so much it was gone within minutes - and none suspected it was vegan!

Now that crema is more available in the USA...you definitely do NOT want to use heavy creme! Look for crema mexicana - it's more like sour cream. Creme fraiche or heavy cream will melt and get all watery -- although that other comment about the French influence on crema has got me thinking.... The brand my visiting Mexico City expert uses when we can find it is Alpura (NOT the one in a box - in roundish containers, looks like yogurt), it has best consistency but also has chemicals added so I look for other brands. For the party we found an additive-free crema on 116th street NYC . . . Also, you can put the hot charred poblanos in a brown paper bag to let them steam, like you do red bell peppers in an italian frame of mind...

Great side dish to the steak recipe

The real thing. An excellent garnish or side dish as well as filling for tacos. You can get very satisfactory results from canned whole green chiles, but use fresh poblanos, if possible. It's worth the effort. Also, if possible, use Mexican cream. It's even more authentic.

Wow, this is excellent! I didn't have time to make creme fraiche so used heavy cream instead and it worked great. I would like to try it with creme fraiche when I have time, though, to see if there's a big difference. I now can't imagine having tacos without this! I'm addicted!

I haven't attempted this particular recipe yet, but was looking for one to mirror what I grew up on in Mexico... This is wonderful if you use as a filling for empanadas (buy mexican instant corn tortilla mix, and make slightly thicker. Place rajas in middle, pinch closed and fry).

If you can afford the cholesteroal, use butter instead of oil, it really gives them a huge flavor boost. I was taught to make rajas that way. Also, if you live on the West Coast and your market carries Mexican cheeses, look for Mexican Crema..it's actually the same as creme fraiche. The Mexicans learned to make it during the time they had a French Emperor, Maximillion, ruling them. That's also where the Bolillo comes from, as well.

Wonderful mixture of tastes and just the right amount of heat. I made a bed of the vegetables and served a seared chicken breast atop....simply to die for!
