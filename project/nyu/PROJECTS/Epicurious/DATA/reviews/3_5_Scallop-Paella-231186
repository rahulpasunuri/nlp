Made this last night. Pretty good flavor, but don't really see the point of Israeli couscous -- it was a little sticky compared to the way rice soaks up the yummy flavor of the seafood. Overall, the recipe seemed to be lacking in moisture. I'll try a more traditional recipe next time.

I modified this because I don't eat meat. Replaced the chorizo with Gimme Lean (I know, but it was actually good). I skipped the mussels and increased the clams, scallops and shrimp, because I couldn't get fresh mussels. I didn't miss them at all. I messed around with the order of things a bit, and managed to do the whole thing in one skillet and one soup pot. Result: damn good. Loved the texture of the Israeli couscous - I'm now a convert. It's so much better!

Yes, this took some time, and, yes, this took several pans...but this recipe was totally worth it! We made it in under 90 minutes and everyone had seconds...and it was even better the next day! We did make minimal changes to it (used clam juice, etc.) but overall stayed true to the recipe. My friends from San Juan PR (from where this recipe was inspired) fell in love!

This is just to balance out the 0 forks rating made by tinkerbee. I agree that the # of puts is excessive (one-pot paella!).

I like paella but I just read this recipe. Who wants to dirty four -- count 'em -- four pots???

I've made paella for years and I generally like couscous so I thought this would be an interesting variation. For starters, there's no way this dish takes an hour to prepare -- it takes quite a bit longer. (Just taking the beards off the mussels took me 20 minutes). I thought the end result had a good flavor, but maybe it's just the purist in me that didn't cotton to the cous cous.
