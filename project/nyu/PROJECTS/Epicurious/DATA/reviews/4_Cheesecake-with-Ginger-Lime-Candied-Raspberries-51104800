Delicious, and the ginger-lime raspberries are a must with it. Not sure why they are called "candied" raspberries, and also question why the description says it's a super-light filling. Super-light with a stick of butter, creme fraiche, and a cup of heavy cream, in addition to the cream cheese? Generally, I get fewer servings out of dessert recipes than are listed, but this for sure serves 8. I found it to taste a lot richer than a traditional cheesecake and more labor intensive, also, having to beat the cream separately. For this reason I'm not sure if I will make the cheesecake again, but I will definitely make the raspberries, perhaps to serve with a baked cheesecake. OTOH, this would be a good dessert to make in warm weather when you don't want to turn on the oven.

Delicious and very pretty... I made it 1.5 times the recipe and it fit perfectly to the top of a 9" springform pan. I added a bit more gelatin to be positive it would hold its shape. This is easy and quick to make. Wonderful for a nonbake cheesecake!

This was a perfect summer dessert that required no oven time. I loved the creamy consistency and it was easy to make ahead. I served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it.

I made the cheesecake in a 9" springform pan, unlined, and it came out beautifully.

This is a light refreshing summer dessert. The ginger and mint in the topping made it outstanding. My guests all raved about it.

This a a beautiful, simple, elegant recipe. I used gluten-free digestive biscuits for the base and halved the ginger in the topping. All of my guests loved it and because it was so light, everyone had seconds. This will be my 'go-to' cheesecake recipe from now on. Changing up the topping depending on the season, would be easy.

I will not be giving up my cheesecake but I thought this was a nice summer dessert with a good crust and filling. Not sure what I thought about the topping and I could be happy with some raspberries by themselves or in a light sugar syrup.Others liked the topping so I'm sure I will make it again.
