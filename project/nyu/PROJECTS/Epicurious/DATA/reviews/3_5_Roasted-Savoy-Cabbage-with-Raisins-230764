When I make this recipe again I will halve both the oil and butter and added toasted pine nuts for some crunch. Very nice!!

I normally don't buy cabbage but I got a head of savoy in my farm box and found this recipe. I made the recipe as instructed except I omitted the raisins since I'm not big on sweet flavors with vegetables. All three adults at dinner loved it (one asked for the recipe) and even my six year old daughter ate it up. I don't understand the one star review that said it was unappealing and dry: with 2 1/2 tablespoons of oil and 3 tablespoons of butter it is actually rather rich (yum!). And after 30 minutes in the oven it carmelized to a golden brown.

I am baffled at why this recipe would be considered to be so bad. I have been cooking it pretty often, and I find it to be excellent. I used it not only with Savoy cabbage, but also regular green and red cabbage, sometimes using dark raisins rather than golden, and each time was very successful. I wholeheartedly recommend this recipe!

I took Judy7 from Northern Virginia's advice and did NOT roast the cabbage. I used sliced red cabbage, not savoy. I simply stir-fried it with the butter, oil, fresh thyme, salt and pepper. Then I added a splash of water, covered it, and watched it closely. I think vinegar is optional.

I question as to whether this recipe was tested. It was not only dry, but the appearance was unappealing. It went from the oven to the trash.
