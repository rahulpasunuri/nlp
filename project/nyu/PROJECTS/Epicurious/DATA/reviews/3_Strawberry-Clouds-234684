A little too sweet, and the meringes were too crisp.

We loved this dessert! I never made meringue before and it stuck to the silpat. But it still tasted wonderful.

After making this I have to agree with most of the cooks out there - Way too sweet! What is going on in desert land? The last couple of recipes for desert have been sickly sweet concoctions that my kids won't even eat. For example was the bananna-marshmallow thing they had on last week. My kids took one bite and said "Yuck!" I have hypoglycemia so I don't indulge in sugary deserts (or other foods) but my family has a huge sweet tooth and no health restrictions, so I love to make them great deserts. Epicurious is just not cutting it these days! Gonna stick to my chocolate chip cookies and apple pie for now. Epicurious - GIVE US SOMETHING GOOD!

This dessert is indeed a "Pavlova" named for 1930's Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova. It is unclear whether the original idea came from Australia or New Zealand, and both countries claim it's origin. Wherever it originated, it's delicious!

Well, this is a direct copy of the Aussie favourite "Pavlova". Aussie's make the pavlova (the cloud base) then top it with whipped cream, sliced strawberries, sliced kiwi fruit and fresh passionfruit pulp. We don't use the cardom though. Just so that you are aware that this is not some new invention, but a tried and true Aussie favourite.

I saw this recipe and knew they blew it with the amount of sugar. I usually do a 2 egg whites to 1/4 cup sugar ratio. That allows a sweet topping to be added OR allows you to throw in some mini-chocolate chips in the "clouds". If you are just eating them as clouds, go only up a 2 whites to 1/2 sugar ratio, no higher.

a nice alternative to strawberry shortcake ... but I also thought it was a little too sweet.

Those of you who are skipping the cardomon are missing the best part! Cardomon pairs amazingly with strawberries!

Have to say I also thought this was WAY to sweet as did all my guests. Also the meringue was very difficult to eat, to crunchy to cut with a fork and to messy (with the berries and whipped cram) to eat with your hands. Try something else!!

I made this for Mother's Day - it was a big hit. I made it all same day so the meringues were fine. I did not think it was too sweet but one can always reduce the amount of sugar if you have concerns that it could be too sweet or omit the syrup that the recipe indicates should go on the berries. I also used vanilla and grand marnier instead of cardamom in the recipe.

This was a bit too sweet. My main problem was that the meringues where too chewy and where hard to eat. I made them the day before and sealed them--could this be the problem. It was as easy make ahead type dessert and looked good in presentation. I would make this recipe again if I could understand why the meringues turned out as they did.

Using almond extract or ground almonds or hazelnuts in the meringue is a wonderful substitute for cardamom.

My meringues were very hard--maybe I cooked them too long. Very pretty, but the whole dessert was just too sweet for us.

This is sooo easy and makes a fabulous presentation! Great flavors, simple and elegant. Thoroughly enjoyable... I did reduce the sugar in the meringues to 1/2 cup and they were just fine. Enjoy!!

Definitely would make it again. This tasted incredibly great! In fact, I'm thinking about making it for my wedding dessert!

What a delicious combination of flavor & texture! I had the leftover meringues & cream the next day with thawed frozen blackberries.

This is the quintessential dessert for entertaining -- it's delicious, easy to make, prepared in advance, looks good on the plate...what more can you ask for? I didn't have any cardomom, so I omitted it, and while I'm sure it would have provided a nice layer of flavor and complexity, the dish didn't suffer. I'll be making this at least a couple more times this spring, great recipe.

Delicious and actually pretty easy.
