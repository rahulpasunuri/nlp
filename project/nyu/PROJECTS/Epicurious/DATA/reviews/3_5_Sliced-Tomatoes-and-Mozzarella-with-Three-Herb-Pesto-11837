Premise is good, but the hearty, nutty taste of the pesto overwhelms the delicate flavours of the tomatoes/mozzarella. For a recipe that allows the tomatoes and cheese to shine, try the Insalata Caprese instead.

Have made just the pesto several times but finally put it all together with the tomatoes and mozarella - mmmm good! Try toasting the pine nuts for a little richer flavor.

Very good recipe!! The three herb pesto sauce is wonderful. Definitely a keeper.
