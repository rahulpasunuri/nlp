These were nice biscotti, but probably not as good as the cranberry-pistachio on this site. Despite cutting the sugar in half, they were still very sweet. However, the cinnamon-raisin combination was great (I tripled the amount of ground cinnamon). Also, they were very crispy and great for dunking in milk/coffee. Despite not being my favorite, I would definitely make them again. However, I might decrease the sugar even further and maybe increase the brandy, which added an interesting touch.

The kids and I made these for teacher gifts and had a few before going to bed. There were a hit with everyone!

JUST STARTING TO BAKE AND KT'S SO EASY. I LOVE THAT IT HAS NO EXTRA FAT BUT TASTES WONDERFUL. I GAVE THE RECIPE TO MY SISTER AND SHE'S MADE IT TWICE. ALSO A BIG HIT. I USED GRAND MARNIER INSTEAD OF BRANDY.

Other biscotti recipes I've used contained butter or oil, so I was a little afraid of this. My fears were unfounded. They came out great, and they cut nice and clean.

Didn't have any brandy so used amaretto. Drizzled some vanilla icing on half of them. Not a biscotti fan myself but others liked them alot. Yes, definitely watch the oven time as the edges brown quickly on the 2nd baking.

I've made this biscotti twice and have not been disappointed. The first time I added chocolate chips, and the second time I added dried cranberry - both yummy. I don't have any brandy, so I just doubled the vanilla, and it's still good. However, the recipe doesn't yield 2 dozen, it gives you half that much. I also lowered the temperature to 300 degrees on the second and third baking, as it comes out too crisp at the original temperature.

Extra crisp and pleasantly bite-able without being either too hard or soft. In other words, perfect! I substituted dried cherries (which I cut in half) for raisins, pistachio nuts for almonds and apple juice for brandy. Next time I would cut down on the amount of cinnamon and maybe cut a minute off the final baking time. Better double the recipe (as I did) because these won't last! NOTE: I plan to try other flavor substitutions with this excellent basic biscotti recipe.

Fabulous! The brandy really added a wonderful flavour. One of my favourite biscotti - and it's been perfect everytime I make it.

Excellent! Easy to make and delicious -- I added cinnamon covered raisins (by Dole) rather than plain and the result was delightful! I have been making biscotti for years -- I think I like these best. Low fat too.

I have made these a bazillion times and everyone adores them. I always make a double batch as there are never enough. They are addictive and so simple to prepare. I've even given the recipe, ingredients and a baking sheet as a 'make your own biscotti' gift to non-cooking friends who've raved over them. This recipe is a keeper!

Excellent recipe. I am used to adding a tiny bit of butter - about one table spoon which makes these a little more tender. I didn't have brandy, so substituted a table spoon of Limoncillo - lemon liquor and they came out great -- a litle hint of lemon flavor, but sweet too. I also threw in some chopped dried apricots with the raisins for extra chewiness. Yummy.

Very good. I forgot to keep track of the amount of time it takes until it is "almost brown." Consider doubling the receipe to start.

I made these biscotti as part of a holiday baking gift assortment. They were _very_ well received: even toddlers begged for seconds!

An excellent, very quick recipe. I tried it with cranberries instead of raisins, which was also good. Also, brushing beaten egg and sprinkling with a little sugar on the cookie after the first baking added a nice glazed appearance. Watch all of the cooking times as it tends to overbake easily.

This is one of the best biscotti recipes I had tried so far. I am a coffee lover and this biscotti is so good for dipping.
