This is a great recipe I make a lot, especially if I am accommodating vegetarians and meat-eaters at the same meal. I add chick peas to the veggie mix for protein, and then I grill merguez (spicy Moroccan sausage)or something similar on the side, which is how I have often seen this type of dish offered in Moroccan restaurants. Personally, I like to cut up the sausage and mix it in with the veggies and couscous. I offer some hot sauce with it too. As others have said, I definitely cook the carrots longer at first so the zucchini doesn't get soggy, and I add more wine to create more sauce. A winner!

This is a frequent side at our house. My teen kids like it (one loves it). Healthy, quick and versatile.

This was a nice recipe. I marked it as "good" only because it is not outstanding, but still really simple and nice. I added chickpeas so it could be a main course. A good and quick dins for a weeknight, would make again when needing something simple and want to use up the veggies in the fridge.

This is really good when the sauce is drenching the couscous (but not so much otherwise). I used whole wheat couscous, cauliflower, carrots, red onion, zucchini, and a chardonnay as the cooking wine. I might agree with an earlier review that said this is better as a side dish rather than a main course.

This came out great, but might use a little more sauce in the future. I served it with Moroccan chicken and Orange couscous.

I found this delicious and felt the need to do very little doctoring. I did squirt a little lemon and added some chopped parsley at the end to add brightness and color. I also increased the amount of vegetables (red onion, carrots, zucchini and parsnips)by about 1 cup and ground my own corriander. In making it again,I would add more liquid.

This was ok...neede a little kick of some sort to make it a little more exciting. Probably won't make it again.

most enjoyable. I didn't have any wine or coriander for that matter, so I suppose I can't truly rate the recipe. However, it came out quite tasty without the coriander (though I would like to try it with) and using chicken broth as a sub for the wine. the minted yogurt really added a zing when served as a condiment for the dish! We even had pistachio ice cream with orange slices for dessert. Will make again.

So easy and quick! I used red onion, carrots, and zucchini. But I didn't have golden raisins, so I used cranberry. It turned out great! The sweet and tangy taste of cranberry really adds to the flavor.

I overcooked my veggies! Added jicima for crunch at the end and used regular rasins. Will do again, this time with the veggies cooked properly.

this recipe took some coaxing, but it turned out great. i added more cumin and corriander than were called for, i added cinnamon and a little vinegar, and i cooked the couscous in the sauce instead of separately (added appropriate amount of water and tossed it all in).

A very tasty, couscous dish. I served it alongside lamb chops to great praise and requests for the recipe. I just referred them to epicurious instead. I think the use of yellow raisons is purely for visual aesthetic. They blended in with the dish and became an invisible, surprise, flavor explosion. I'm sure black raisons would still be better than leaving the raisons out altogether. I used red onion, bell pepper, and baby zuccini. I cooked the onion a bit prior to the rest of the veggies. The nice thing about this recipe is it is done when the veggies are done, so you don't worry about overcooking the zuccine as long as you give it a little less cooking time than the longer-cooking veggies (onion). It was quick and easy, too.

An excellent sidedish to any meal but I paired it with grilled moroccan chicken. Simple and tasty. Added yellow and red bell peppers as well for some color.

Once again, you've helped me save the day - thank you. I'm only starting out as a cook and with your help I've managed to delight some pretty picky eaters. This dish was a breeze to make and it is absolutely delish. I used regular raisins and it worked just fine. I definitely recommend making it.

A perfect summer dish! Flavourful, colourful and light! I took pine nuts instead om almonds and added some dry mint to my couscous. My friends couldn't believe I created this gourmet feast only in half an hour time.

Wonderful flavor! Followed the recipe exactly, except used part slivered almonds and part pine nuts (ran out of almonds). Made with Grilled Spice-Rubbed Flank Steak from this site and an Israeli salad. Excellent middle-eastern style meal.

This is quite a unique dish, very flavorful (definitely needs the dry white wine and raisins for the full "sweet" effects.) I made this with marinated moroccan chicken and glazed crunchy carrots.

This is one of my favorite vegetarian dishes. I use red onion, zucchini, carrots and yellow squash as the veggies, and a little more couscous than called for (to strech it). I cook the couscous in the veggie broth left in the can, with water to make up the diffence, which adds a little more flavor. I also use slivered almonds instead of sliced, a little crunchier, but pine nuts work in a pinch too.

If using carrots or other root veg, they need cooked for longer at the outset. Otherwise the courgettes (zucchini) will be mushy. Flavour pleasant enough, but didn't stand up as a veggie main course in its own right, even with added garlic - better served as a side dish with grilled lamb. I added some crumbled feta cheese to give it some added kick - not very authentic but then nor is the white wine or the yoghurt with mint.

I've put this into my regular rotation. Usually I make it with bok-choy, red & yellow peppers, bean sprouts and brocolli. I leave out the raisins and nuts, though. It's easy, fast, and yummy. It is dependent on the wine, though.

Quick and easy if you need a fast meal, I agree with previous reviewer regarding garlic. Or maybe I am just a garlic fanatic...

Made this dish as a side entree. Was satisfactory in that regard, but next time I will use vegetables with more kick. I used zucchini and carrots this time - was rather bland. Next time, more onions, something else which will contribute its own flavor to the whole.
