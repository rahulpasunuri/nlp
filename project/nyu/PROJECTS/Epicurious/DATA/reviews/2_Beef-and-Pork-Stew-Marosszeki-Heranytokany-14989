Most of the people who have posted don't know the secret to this famous Hungarian dish....you must stew this meal slowly in order to bring out the flavors! Absolutely delicious meal. Accomodate with Spaetzl (Nokedli) as well to make it a true traditional Hungarian dish. Enjoy!

Based on all the reviews regarding the blandness of the recipe, I made a few changes with ingredients I had on hand, and the final dish came out extremely flavorful. Everything was in a large skillet. It might not be authentic, but it will be very appetizing! VARIATION: -Substitute polish sausage and ground chuck. I opened up some of the casings to mix with the beef. -Substitute chicken broth enough to cover the meat (1/2 c is too little; 1-1/2 c is more like it) -Also added a generous pinch of kosher salt and french 4-spice to bring out the pork flavor. -Added cubed potatoes and carrots. -a few spoons of crushed tomatoes. -1 tsp. cornstarch mixed in 1/2 c. sour cream. Stir this in at the end while at a medium simmer and it will thicken with a couple of minutes.

It was okay but had to spice it up. Had no problem with the amount of liquid.

I also thought this sounded good but when I went to make it I too found that it lacked flavor. While I didn't have trouble with the liquid, I did have to do some SERIOUS doctoring to liven it up.

This recipe takes MUCH more liquid than it calls for -- Over the course of two hours I added at least 2 cups of liquid to keep from burning... Also, not much flavor.
