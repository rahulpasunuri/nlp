This was delicious. I come from a province in the southernmost tip of Italy, Calabria. There is no reason to get so angry about a few variations in a recipe. That is what adventure is for. We loved this dish.

My husband [French] enjoys the same snobism about anything cooked in America which professes to be a French dish. He poo poos things constantly when he hears the name of the recipe. You know what, he eats it and likes it anyway. This artichoke caponata was good, no matter what you call it. Long live those of us among the unwashed masses who just enjoy eating good food!

A true Sicilian Caponata has eggplant in it as the dominating vegetable. Your recipe does NOT qualify as a Sicilian Caponata. The dish can also have dried & grated tuna roe & sometimes even a hint of chocolate.There are other ingredients which your recipe does not mention. True Caponata is an experience not a meal. No. I didn't cook your recipe...no point!
