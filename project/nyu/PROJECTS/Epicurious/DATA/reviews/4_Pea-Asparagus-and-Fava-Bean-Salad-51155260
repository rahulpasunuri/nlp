Love this salad! The flavors and texture were right on. No changes to the recipe except I oven roasted the asparagus and used little more lemon juice in the dressing. Watch the cooking of the shallots as I found 10-12 minutes way too long. Although it says it serves 6 my husband and I had no problem eating it all between the two of us. This is definitely a keeper.

Tasty, delicious, very green and pretty. I made a few changes: couldn't find fava beans, so I subbed all peas. Still good, but what a bummer. I cooked the shallot in the leftover bacon greese, very good and saved time and mess. I used the bacon greese for the dressing which I regretted... It was too heavy and I had to lighten it up with a bunch more lemon juice and red wine vinagar, which then turned out pretty good. Overall it was a keeper.
