Very good marinade-- but it makes a lot, enough for 2 whole chickens I would say. Next time I will definitely increase the salt since it seemed a little under seasoned.

I didn't actually use the whole recipe, but rather just the marinade. It was fabulous! If the rest of the recipe is that good, then I will definitely be using it! I only marinated the chicken for about an hour and then sauteed it on the stove. It still turned out delicious. My family could not get enough.

I forgot to add that I didn't have much time that day so only marinated the chicken breasts for a total of about 1 hr and increased the garlic in the marinade by one clove. If the flavor turned out this good after just one hour, I wonder how good it would taste doing for the three hours or so the directions call for?

Forget the pita sandwich part - this chicken is so exceptionally flavored when done on a gas or BBQ grill, I will use it from now on as my go-to chicken ke-bab flavoring. I did like the pita sanwiches and made them mostly as described (using all fresh herbs where asked for dried)but increased the sauce and amount of onions per other reviews. I left the onions a bit more crunchy as this gave good texture and contrast within the pita. But, just grab a bite of that chicken BEFORE you put it in the pitas and you'll see what I mean. Even the next day, WOW! Absolutely to die for. Oh, yes, we don't like dark meat so I used boneless, skinless breast of chicken cooked on a gas barbeque for approx 5 min per side at med-high, turning about every three min. I let them rest about two min. Love this seasoning and you will too!

My fiance is famous for his unethusiastic responses but when I made this he absolutely raved. I didn't have time to marinade the chicken the way the recipe calls for and didn't want to deal with cooking the chicken in the oven so I marinated it in garlic, some yogurt, juice from half a lemon, and the thyme. I let it marinade for about a half hour while I made the sauce and then threw it in the George Forman. It turned out great, lots of flavor and very moist. We made curried couscous for a side dish. Excellent meal.

My husband and I really loved this dish. We will definitely make it again. I agree about the sauce I would also double that. I used lebne for the sauce as well which is a little thicker than yogurt but with the same flavor. You can achieve the same results with regular yogurt drained in cheesecloth over a pot in the frig overnight. This had such great flavor!

I have been making this for a couple of years and even my fussy kids like it! A couple of tips -- I marinade the chicken for about 6-8 hours, don't use more garlic than called for in the sauce (a mistake I made once, being a garlic lover!), be generous with fresh (not dried!) mint, make a double/triple portion of the onion topping (I skip the sesame seeds, we don't like them).

This recipe is missing basic instructions; how long to marinate...how far in advance to mix the sauce...it would really help!

This was unbelievable. My husband and I enjoyed it so much we had it two nights in a row. It's the best tasting grilled chicken I've ever had. It could be used on it's own for salads, sandwiches or whatever, but on the pita with the yogurt mint sauce, it was out of this world. Not too difficult to make either.

This is delicious and one of my favorite recipe. I added mushrooms.

We thought this a bit heavy and not that interesting.

This was great and much enjoyed by everyone who ate it. We dubbed it "Lebanese faijitas". The only problem was the quantities. I had 5 really hungry adults and ended up with a bit too much yoghurt sauce, not nearly enough chicken and way too little onion-tomato sauté (I tripled or more the yoghurt based on others' comments). But try it anyway. However much there is is delicious.

the first time i made this dish my family was crying out for more!! really popular though it wasn't enough for a family of four. the yoghurt was LUSH! would recommend double mint sauce. i doubled the amount of tomatoes and onions and just warmed the tomatoes up with the onions...lovely!

This dish incorporated the use of yogurt sauce in cooking incredibley well. I loved the sweet succulent taste the chicken inherited from the marinade. This will definitely be added to my recipe box!

LOVED this! This was very simple, very tasty, and great for a hot summer day. The yogurt sauce was incredible. My only recommendations would be to double or triple the sauce and the tomato topping. We doubled the sauce for just the two of us, and it was just enough for about 2-1/2 people! We definitely needed more tomato topping too. I made this with chicken breasts, because I don't like dark meat, and it came out fine (I was concerned it might be dry).

I used both the breasts and thighs of chicken in this recipe. Both were delicious. Be careful not to overcook the chicken. I served this for a large group of people, who enjoyed putting together their own sandwiches. I also served a couscous salad with raisins, olives and capers (see recipe) as a side dish, along with a greek salad. All went well together.

Excellent and quick version of several Greek pita sandwich recipes. Note: Be SURE to use FRESH mint leaves. It makes all the difference between stale and delicious!
