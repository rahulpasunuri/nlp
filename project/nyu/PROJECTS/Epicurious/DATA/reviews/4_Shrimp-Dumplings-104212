Filling's great. I sometimes use it (or a blend with ground pork) with gyoza wrappers to save time, but then it's no longer the shrimp dumplings served in Chinatown for dim sum. Those have translucent skins and are much more delicate.

Yum. We use gyoza wrappers- easy, cheap, freeze well. We cook these like pot stickers- brown the bottom and then steam with chicken broth. A good sauce for this~ 5 tbs rice vinegar, ¼ c light soy sauce, 2 tbs dark soy sauce, 3 tbs warm water, 1 ½ tbs sugar, 1 tbs sesame oil, 1 tsp Sriracha chile sauce, 2 tbs ginger, 2 tps garlic, 2 tsp jalepeno- mix until sugar is dissolved. Will keep up to two days.

We used gyoza wrappers, which are so easy to work with. We also added garlic and ginger to the filling. Will try Thai basil, too. A sauce that we like: 5 tbs rice vinegar, ¼ c light soy sauce, 2 tbs dark soy sauce, 3 tbs warm water, 1 ½ tbs sugar, 1 tbs sesame oil, 1 tsp Sriracha chile sauce, 2 tbs ginger, 2 tps garlic, 2 tsp jalepeno- mix until sugar is dissolved.

This has been a big hit the three times I have taken it to a party. Making it again for a wine tasting party tonight. Add water chesnuts rather than the bamboo shoots. Better texture

This is 'har gao' in dim sum restaurants. Made 2 batches, one w/ bamboo shoots and the other w/ water chestnuts (yum!). Everyone preferred the water chestnuts for the crunch and also the bamboo flavor was too strong. My 1st time making dough, here's my tip: Divide dough into 4 pieces. Take each piece and roll into a 1/2in. cylinder. Cut the roll into 1" pieces and roll each piece into a ball. Oil the work service and a butcher's cleaver. Take the ball and flatten w/ the side of the cleaver. Do it once or twice to desired thickness, and voila, a round dough wrapper! Should be 2 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter. I froze the extra by halving the steaming time and wrapped in plastic & foil. Resteam for 5 minutes.
