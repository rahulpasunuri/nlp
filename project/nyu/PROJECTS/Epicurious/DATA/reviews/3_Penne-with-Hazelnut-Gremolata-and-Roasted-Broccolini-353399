This recipe was fine. Not bad, not great. As a separate course, it would be disappointing, but as a side for the seared duck breast with cherries, it balanced fairly well. Still, will probably not repeat.

Delicious! I made mine with corn and quinoa gluten-free pasta. I would recommend a hard cheese like parmigiano reggiano or peccorino to go on top.

Huh. I just don't really understand this recipe. I made it for a dinner party as a side dish and found it to be a lot of work for minimal taste results. Chopping and roasting the nuts, grating the lemon peel, etc.. and I ended up with a very ordinary (and dry!) pasta dish. Wouldn't make it again.

I made this last night with my only change being the substitution of broccoli for the broccolini. It was a simple, fresh, tasty dish. Good flavor, minimal effort.
