Is this the gumbo you make when your Cajun friends or relatives are coming to visit? No. Is this the gumbo you make when you're in a hurry or have some leftover chicken thighs or okra? Yes. You already have most of the ingredients. Watch the roux; the small quantity means it gets dark quick.

Needs a LOT of tinkering, but it's a good base to get creative with. First, I added onion, garlic, and celery to step one and sauteed them in the oil (I always use olive oil), adding the flour (we had whole wheat on hand) near the end and cooked it for a few minutes to get the raw flour taste out. Along with the flour I added 2 bay leaves, the thyme, about 1/2 tablespoon of cajun seasoning, 1 tablespoon of paprika, 1/2 tablespoon of chili powder (we like spicy) and salt. Deglazed with canned diced tomatoes, then added some vegetable stock, chopped fresh okra (don't leave it whole, you need the "slime" to help thicken the sauce), chunks of summer squash (had some that needed to be eaten), and the chicken. On the chicken note: thighs or other dark meat are critical. Breast does not take well to being simmered usually. I boned and skinned 2 thighs, chopped them up, and let them sit in some olive oil and a combination of the same spices I used in the sauce plus 2 teaspoons of cumin and a healthy dash of red pepper flakes. Let it all simmer, uncovered, until the vegetables are tender. I added some tabasco near the end because it needed a little more kick. Served on simple yellow corn grits done with olive oil, salt & pepper. My southern roommate pronounced it delicious, it not terribly authentic. A good quick weeknight meal.

Pretend gumbo?

Double the flour or cornflour. Add garlic and onion to the roux. Use FRESH okra instead of frozen or canned. Don't add Tabasco but serve separately for individual tastes. Pearl barley goes well with this in place of rice. Bay leaf and/or tarragon may be added. My wife loved it as did I and she won't normally eat Creole. I do and I loved it too. It is easy and delicious.

Doubled the recipe and added onions and green bell pepper to the roux for flavor. Also added a bay leaf. Served in shallow bowls with a mound of rice in the middle. Good, solid comfort food.

I recently made this dish for our annual Mardi Gras Dinner at our Church for the second year in a row. I used chicken breast and multiplied everything to feed 120. There were no left overs.

EZ & quick (which is great on a weeknight) with relatively good flavors, but not much depth. Liked it, didn't love it.

This is creamy and delicious. A nice, mild blend of flavors that is soothing on a cold winter's night. And it couldn't be easier.....

this was just okay... added celery and onion to roux, just not as flavorful as I feel like gumbo should be. Was really easy and my spouse liked it.

This was quite tasty considering how simple it was to prepare. I also added a bay leaf, salt and pepper, simmered for 35 minutes, and added cooked brown rice at the end, and the consistency came out perfectly - not too soupy, not too thick. Will definitely make this again for a quick, tasty meal!

This is excellent, and very easy! No modifications needed--great comfort food on a chilly night,too.

This was excellent as-is. A little soupier than I expected, but very tasty and almost creamy. Extremely easy to make, but by all means--double it!

I have no idea whether this dish is "authentic" or not, but with a few minor changes it's really delicious and easy to prepare. I added chopped Spanish onion and green peppers to the roux, and subbed fresh okra (frozen is really terrible). Couldn't find the thighs so I used breast meat. Fresh thyme is a must. I doubled the recipe, (tripled the okra) but kept the 1 can of broth -- my gumbo was thick and rich. Over rice, it's delicious!

I used chicken breasts, small ones and doubled the recipe. I also put in one cup of pre-cookied rice at the end. It was superb---what a nice treat and very easy to make---the okra makes it!!

This was unbelievably good for how simple it was to make. I used chicken left over from a roast the night before, and stock made from the same chicken. I used whole plum tomatos, instead of the diced, and just broke up the tomato in the pot. My kids liked it, and my husband loved it because he could add as much tobasco sauce as he wanted. This was great.

This is great and easy. I added garlic, onion, and greens and cooked 35 minutes to soften. Shrimp sounds good in this dish as well.

this was easy to make, and tasted ok. it was kind of bland, though. next time i'll add some garlic and onion, and definitely more hot sauce.

Great dish, especially for being so simple. Didnt use okra at all.

I'm not a gumbo expert but this is pretty tasty, even if it's not authentic. I added kielbasa along with the chicken which gives it a nice smokey flavor.

Replace the frozen Okra and can diced tomatoes also canned chicken broth with fresh cut Okra and Plum tomatoes I don`t have to much use for canned tomatoes or frozen foods used some of the chicken to make my own broth but enjoyed the thrill of creating my own version,very tasty.

This is a good quick recipe. I can't recommend that you use frozen okra, however. It's often tough and stringy. Pick out your own fresh okra and choose the smallest pods -- they're tenderest and tastiest.

I made this gumbo with fresh okra and tomatoes and a smokey hot sauce. Being a yankee I can't vouch for its authenticity - but damn it was good! It was so quick and easy and came out great. I'll make it again next weekend.

Authentic or not, I enjoyed this gumbo. It was simple to prepare and was great over some brown rice. Just don't forget the tabasco.

i am a true cajun and i have never heard of putting tomatoes or tomato sauce in gumbo! we have eaten plenty of things with tomatoe in it, but certainly not gumbo. you either eat it with chicken & sausage or the seafood. a true cajun knows that! i did not make this recipe because i have my own of my mom's which is the best in the world! i would love to tell some of these people how to make a gumbo. let me know if you want the recipe and i will be glad to pass it on and let me know what you think of how a real gumbo supper tastes......

Very good and easy to make. To kick it up a notch on the healthy side, I cooked some veggies (onion and green peppers) in the roux before addind the okra (twice the amount) and broth. I also used chicken breasts and served it with brown rice. Not as "authentic" but very tasty. I will add a little more flour next time since I like my gumbo thicker.

A good recipe and one which I will make again. This is a creole recipe - not cajun - and I have used tomato in my gumbo and jambalaya my whole 68 year life.

I really enjoyed this soup. I substituted the frozen okra for fresh and I used already cooked white meat left over from lunch instead. It was quick and easy, very tasty. Thank You epicurious!

It was wonderful and easy. My husband and I really enjoyed it. I actually used seasoned tomatoes and let the soup boil down to a sauce.

Delicious! The thyme adds a wonderful flavor. I added a little extra okra and it was great. Next time I think I will try chicken breasts though, because the thighs were a little too fatty for me.
