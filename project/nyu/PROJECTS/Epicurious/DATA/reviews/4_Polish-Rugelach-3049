This recipe makes perfect cookies! For the filling I use finely chopped apricots instead of cranberries. I always just use cheap cream cheese instead of neufchatel and the result is still super tasty. There are pictures of these cookies and the preparation process on my blog: http://phdprocrastination.wordpress.com/2011/12/06/im-a-rugelach-monster/

Great cookies and fairly easy to make. I used cream cheese and they worked out fine. Also, don't overfill because the nut mixture will bubble out and make the cookie look messy, although they will still taste delicious!

I havent actually made this rugelach but it is almost identical to my favourite recipe in Gourmet 1994 Dec p 206....just add 2 egg yolks and 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the dough and you have it!

I have already made this recipe 3 times and everybody in my family keep on asking me to do it again. Not only is it easy to make, but the filling can be anything one can think of. Just don't worry if the rugelach doesn't look exactly perfect - it still tastes good.

The dough for this cookie is wonderful, and lends itself well to a variety of fillings. I've made the rugelach as described (which was outstanding) as well as experimented with different fillings. One I'd recommend: canned poppy-seed filling, 2tbsp melted butter and 1/4tsp ground cardamom. Wonderful!

Yummy,these taste like more! Easy to make and countless possibillities on filling variations. I put cream cheese in the dough and made more fill then called for. After indulging on these, the hubby told me to stop baking for a while, he's putting on weight.

If this is your your first attempt making rugelach this is a good recipe. Another suggested variation for the filling: replace the cranberries with white raisins; after you roll the dough spread a very thin layer of raspberry preserves on the dough; then follow the recipe.

I've made these several times to rave reviews. Last year I made them for a holiday bake sale and they were the first thing to go. Everyone loves them.

I made a lower-fat version of these cookies by adding drained apple-sauce + oil to the filling instead of butter. Also substituted freshly-ground cardamom for allspice: incredible! The dough was soft, and a little difficult to work with - but that may be because I substituted 1/2 stick margerine, 1/2 butter. Cutting into 4 wedges instead of 8 made beautiful big crescents: this recipe comes HIGHLY recommended!

I have been making these cookies since the recipe first appeared in Bon Appetit in 1996 and have never been disappointed. I'm getting ready to make them again this year for Christmas and I sure I will get the usual rave reviews :)

This cookie is not overly sweet, just a great mix of fruit and nuts (both of which I added a bit more that called for). I may have over stuffed them with filling, but that is the tastiest part!

This is a great recipe for me to make for my diabetic friends. The sugar is minimal, and you use dried berries or fruit. I have used dried cherries, apricots, peaches, etc., and it turns out wonderful.

Used a slightly different dough, but this filling, and I thought it was excellent. May use a tad less sugar next time, but this has a nice nutty crunch. Turned out much better than either my chocolate or cinnamon-sugar fillings. Recommended.

We made 5 of the 6 rugelach recipes on this site. Though this one was among the least popular among the guests, it was the easiest to make. The dough rolled out very smoothly, the filling was easy to spread (if the melted butter solidifies, microwave it briefly), the cookies assembled perfectly, and the egg gave them an attractive golden color.

MUCH easier than I expected. Was determined to fix rugelach and this came so highly recommended that I thought I'd give it a try. Intended to give them away but kept them for myself...best I've ever eaten!

I made this as one of the christmas cookie selection that I usually bake. I felt like these were quite " unspectacular " For all the effort that they took, I would rather have made something else. Perhaps I did something wrong ? They seemed to turn out ok, they just tasted very plain and nothing special

I made these for my dad as part of a Christmas gift basket. Poor dad didn't get many of them! These are very good and very easy to do, which was a relief; I had heard from so many people how difficult rugelach can be. I really like the dough recipe and will play around with different fillings for it.

Wonderful recipe. I usually purchase rugelach at a local bakery and have always wanted to make them. The recipe was easier to make than I has expected. Next time I will probably use dried apricots or cinnamon sugar in place of the craisins.

Delicious. Loads of compliments when I included this in my batch of christmas cookies.As dried cranberies are unavailable, I substituded dried apricots, which worked nicely.

Fantastic recipe. I omitted the fruit from the filling and added a bit of cocoa powder. Everyone loved them.

Very good and not too sweet!! A nice change of pace for the christmas cookie routine.

These is an excellent recipe -- the use of dried fruit instead of preserves, which is often called for, makes it taste better and fancier if you are giving it as a present. I used half cranberries and half apricot. The dough gets soft very quickly, so keeping them in the fridge while you are rolling the rest of a batch helps them keep their nice shape during baking.

These are rich and delicious! I subtituted regular cream cheese for the Neufchatel and dried cherries for the cranberries. There is no need to make more filling if you measure 3 tblsp. per dough round. Warning: it's hard to eat just one!

I love this recipe and am addicted to these cookies (which I originally made as gifts!). The only thing I would advise is turning the oven down a little bit (could just be my oven) and reducing the baking time by 3-4 minutes - otherwise mine became a very dark brown and schorched on the bottom. Yummy and not nearly as difficult as I thought they would be.

These were much easier than I expected and came out tender and delicious. I followed previous reviewers' advice and ground the cranberries and walnuts in the food processor. Made just half the batch for a Hanukkah party -- the rest is waiting in the fridge -- and they disappeared.

I've been making these cookies every year since the recipe came out in the magazine. Everyone loves them. I make them exactly as written, except that I usually make a little more filling. It's true that you need to chop the filling very fine. I use the food processor, pulsing it on and off. They go fast!

I gave this a four-fork rating because a batch of these cookies taken to the Thanksgiving dinner I just attended made a whole lot of people very happy! Everyone fell in love with these delicious, beautiful, tender little cookies. I made them exactly as the recipe said, and they were wonderful. I agree with the reviewer who said that the finer you chop the filling, the easier the cookies are to roll. That's entirely true. These are fantastic and would make a terrific Christmas gift. Next time I'm going to try making them with dried cherries or apricots or blueberries.

Wonderful cookies, especially for Christmas (since they are some trouble). The finer the filling is diced the better. You can also fill these cookies with almost anything sweet - I found a nice ginger marmelade that worked well. Just be prepared for a sticky pan if you use jam or jelly and don't overstuff!

These just melt in your mouth. Great for any holiday.

These are the best cookies! They take some patience to roll and prepare, but they are worth the effort. My co-workers are always scrambling to get some when I bring in my annual plate of cookies to the office.

For Liverpool, you can substitute dried apricots for the cranberries.

GREAT recipe! I've been making these for Christmas for the last several years, and everyone always loves them. This year I'm going to try to use leftover cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving instead of the dried cranberries. I hope it turns out!
