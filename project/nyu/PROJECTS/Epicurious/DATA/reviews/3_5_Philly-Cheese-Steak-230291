Tried it for lunch with my son. I used a sirloin roast which I sliced as thin as I could. I liked it and my son gave it a thumbs up. (Although he also added Worcestershire sauce to his.)

I made this tonight, used some thinly sliced ribeye instead. It really didn't have the flavor I had expected so next time I will experiment with some different things to flavor it up.

Good, quick and easy dinner. A healthy alternative that my husband would actually eat! (Still think he'd prefer the original, but overall a hit)

I must say, this was probably the best philly cheesesteak i've ever had (and i've been to philly!). I substituted the cheese for low-fat white American cheese and added some mushrooms. So good that I made it twice in 3 days! Yum!

kids loved it. I can see why the people in Philly are raving about this!
