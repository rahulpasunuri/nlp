This recipe is a hit. I made it years ago and have been trying to find it again since. It's a bit labor intensive, but the product turns out very nicely

I have done this recipe twice from the Novellis Book.It turned out very good. It is really amazing.. the flavours are great but it is not very easy to make. I have the book that shows the photographs and it helps to make it.
