I had a 3 lbs plus leg of lamb, so I decided to leave it whole. I mixed the dry spices (cardamon, cumin, salt, 1/8 ts of ground clove,and extra cayenne) and rubbed the lamb a day prior. I also made slits, which I stuffed with some garlic. I seared the lamb, then brown the onions with a little salt and sugar, then added cinamon stick, and some gharam masala. Followed the recipe pretty much after that, except, I threw in the spinach as a "bed" for the lamb. At the end, I removed the lamb, then added a little heavy cream, and thickened the sauce. The sauce was delicious, the spinach had a silky texture. Lamb medium rare 45 mins. . Rave reviews on this one! I will make this again, and soon!

It took a long time to prepare, but a lot of that time was spent trimming fat off the meat, rather than on the recipe itself. I used frozen chopped spinach, and the whole thing turned out great. I will take the cover off for the last 15 mins of cooking next time to thicken the sauce.

This was a delicious dish that reminded us of the lamb sag we have at the Indian restaurant. I might let the sauce thicken and cook a bit more, as the final result was a bit thin. Otherwise, excellent.

The Indian trinity in cooking is garlic, ginger, chillies,and are the start of most dishes. I used garam masala for dry spice as it gives the dish a warmer flavour. I cook the spinach longer and then it falls apart and has a mellower taste.Saag gosht is a fave!!

Fabulous! I did, however, make a few changes. I dredged the lamb in flour before browning it,used chicken broth instead of water, and added thyme, basil, and four whole allspice. I also headed the advice of my fellow cooks, and for that added zip used a can of tomatoes with jalapenos, and omitted the spinach. I also served it with the spiced saffron rice - a great combination!

We love this dish and find that it improves with age. I make the full recipe and put half in the freezer before adding the spinach. Chopping the spinach would probably be better, as it is a little awkward.

The recipe's ingredients list made it sound like more of a curry. It merely tasted like stewed meat. The spinach does not work in this recipe. I used a 10 oz. bag (as opposed to the 1.5 pounds) and the spinach just lie there in big clumps. I would either omit it altogether or chop it coarsely beforehand. Plus I would just add it to the stew raw and let it wilt from the stew.

Excellent. Rich flavor with a lot of depth. Not too spicy. I might make it more spicy next time. I served it with the spiced saffron rice and cauliflower suggested in the menu. My world traveler friends thought it was great.
