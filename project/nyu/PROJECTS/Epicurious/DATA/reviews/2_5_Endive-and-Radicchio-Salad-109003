I had some older radicchio and endive in my refrig. As I am the type who tries to use everything up I made this salad up for the two of us. I substituted the Sherry vinegar with Rice wine vinegar, used Sesame oil and no black sesame seeds. I made it up a couple of hours ahead and it was wonderful.

This salad was the perfect counterpoint to a rich meal, the flavors are fresh and bright and it's very pretty on the plate. Be sure to adequately dry the greens before dressing, though, or the salad will be bland.

This salad was a wonderful change of pace, a great way to use radicchio, and has a nice slightly Asian flavour -- it will be a staple for me from now on. I would use the dressing on other things. As for the other reviews, I think sesame oil can vary hugely in taste which may be why others didn't like it.

I stumbled across very fresh and relatively inexpensive (< $3/lb) radicchio and endive at my local "warehouse" supermarket, and made this salad last night to go with steamed lobster. My husband, not a salad fan, loved it, and so did I. I might try peanut oil instead of canola next time, and maybe a few hot pepper flakes. In spring perhaps a few fresh herbs with it, too.

This salad isn't awful, but it definitely needs some work. Too many other good salad recipes to make this one again.

Eating this was an odd experience. Each bite was bitter yet bland, leaving an unpleasant, lingering aftertaste of sesame seed oil. Because endive is so expensive, I kept hoping this dish would "open up," like wine in a glass -- that suddenly I'd lift a forkfull to my mouth and be converted into loving it. Yeah, salad ain't wine.
