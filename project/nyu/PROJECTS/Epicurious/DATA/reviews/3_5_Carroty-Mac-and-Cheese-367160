was looking forward to making this for a while and did a couple of months ago. since i worried that boiling the carrots would lose the vitamins i just added them raw, thinking they would get cooked enough in the baking. well, they did not and were still a little crunchy, making for an odd, but not bad, eating experience. i just saw that someone recently reviewed having sauteed the carrots... i will definitely try again using that method. overall i like the idea of adding some veg to this classic comfort food.

This is delicious- made a few adjustments, though. I caramelized the carrots with some onions and the butter instead of boiling them with the pasta, used yogurt because I didn't have sour cream, added paprika as another reviewer suggested. My 2 year old loved it, too. Next time, I'm adding some chopped cooked broccoli to the pasta/custard/carrot mix before baking, and spicing it up with more paprika and red pepper flakes.

I have been looking forward to making this recipe and finally did. I liked the idea of adding the carrots. They added some sweetness to the overall dish that balanced the sharpness of the cheese. I do think there was too much cheese (I can't believe I am saying this!). I had 2.5 cups on hand and it still seemed like it was too much. I like the concept of this, but maybe will use a different cheese sauce/approach in the future. Also, I do have to say I am surprised if the carrots go undetected by kids when they are eating this dish. Maybe I didn't grate them small enough, but I could clearly see the carrots in the dish, but it was not a problem in our household.

With so many carrots in this recipe, I don't feel guilty making this and it still tastes good!

A decent Mac and cheese. Ran it as written got good results. I might leave in a bit longer or add some bread crumb to the topping to make it browner and crunchier.

Three forks means 'delicious' and I thought this was! I didn't make any changes to the recipe, like other reviewers have. You do not need to, unless you're intent on making mac and cheese as healthy as possible. I am not. This was very satisfying comfort food, the carrots are a nice addition, the melted cheddar/parmesan crust turned out super tasty, and I will definitely make this again.

i too thought this was a weird recipe but after reading the reviews decided to try it out. i'm always looking for ways eat carrots as i don't like them raw. i agree that the dish doesn't taste overly carroty. i made the mistake of buying lowfat white cheddar cheese so the cheese didn't hid the carrot at all. but i found this to be a more healthful version of mac and cheese, maybe not decadently tasty but guilt-free

Was really delicious, though I made a lot of small changes. Used a box of rotini pasta & 8 large carrots. I add a teaspoon of red pepper flakes to the water while cooking pasta and it adds a hint of heat. Used the Mexican blend shredded cheese, but only 1 package (4 cups) for the whole. Used half the butter & a Tbs of olive oil. For the sauce, used a little extra fat-free sour cream & nonfat milk, and an extra egg (since I was making so much) and added a couple tablespoons thin-sliced onion & a couple chopped garlic cloves. Also added some chopped ham and handful of crumbled bacon. Next time might try adding some red pepper and beer!

I imagine the recipe as is would be great too, but I had some carrots to use up and enjoy a little heat in my mac and cheese. I used extra carrots in this recipe--closer to 3 cups, added some cayenne for a little heat and....wow...what a great result!

I made this for a completely skeptical audience (husband and daughter) and we were pleasantly surprised. I made some adjustments to help it be more WW friendly (13 points with my changes - still a splurge but manageable). Used Barilla veggie pasta - carrot variety, less butter, 1/2 cup fat free sour cream, skim milk, and 3 cups grated carrots. Used 2 c total sharp cheddar plus parm. Nobody missed the fat; the sauce was deliciously creamy and the carrots really blended with the pasta. I will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe pretty closely except substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream and 1% milk for whole milk. I also left out the butter - seemed totally unnecessary with all the cheese in it. The dish is a bit strange, but it tasted good and is probably fairly healthy. A good vegetarian option.

I used Co-Jack and a variety of gourmet cheeses (since that's what we had in the fridge). Extra carrots, since my husband likes them. And, I left out the additional salt. Good Lord -- with all that cheese and sour cream, you don't need to add salt!

Two forks mean good and that is exactly what I found this to be. I did like the fact that you could add the carrots to the mix and not have it effect the flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, so its not as if I tweaked it all sorts of ways and am now giving it a not so stellar rating. It was a good mac and cheese, but not exceptional.

I had been looking forward to making this recipe for the past couple of days now and finally got around to it for tonight's dinner. The hardest part after making this was waiting for it to cool down a bit before digging in. It smelled like grilled cheese--soooo cheesy! Took my first bite and wondered why I ever ate crap like Kraft Dinner (and enjoyed it back then)! It did end up being a little salty so I may reduce the amount of cheese by 1/4 - 1/2 cup and omit the salt entirely. Delicious!!

I was worried there wouldn't be enough "cheese" flavour but there was! I used a higher quality cheddar than your average grocery brands and I think that is what made the difference. I also had no Parmesan so I used Asiago in it's place. This is going into my meal rotation for sure.I may try adding a bit of roasted onion and garlic next time and I may replace some of the carrot with broccoli or cauliflower as an experiment.

I am a Southern woman who loves her mac and cheese, and I must declare that this is a winner. I also have a son with sensory issues that does not eat vegetables and he had no idea there were carrots in this recipe. He scarfed it down and asked for seconds and thirds. Winner.

My fiance and I joined a local CSA and have been getting a lot of carrots in our delivery lately, so we decided to try this recipe. I did not have whole wheat macaroni on hand, so I used tiny veggie pasta shells. I also substituted half and half for the milk (also on hand) and Greek yogurt for the sour cream (something I typically do). I left off the parmesan. I'm not a huge fan of carrots, but this recipe was FANTASTIC. I want to make it again as soon as the leftovers are gone.

This is a great dish. I have made it about a dozen times. We even used it as a side dish for Easter. I would buy quality cheese and avoid the packaged shredded cheese. It makes a difference.

This was easy and very good. My daughter loved it, and she didn't mind the carrots at all. Indeed, she told me the carrots were the best part.

I made this for vegetarian guests. I followed it exactly except I used whole wheat fettucine noodles, and instead of the sour cream I used a half cup of plain yogurt. I was a bit worried that I'd ruined it by using the yogurt, but the end product was good. Because I used long noodles we had to cut it,but my guests cleaned their plates and enjoyed leftovers.

This was good. I understood this would be a casserole-style mac n cheese, so I enjoyed it more than my kids did, who prefer a more traditional style. I added smoked gouda and tiny bacon crumbles, but other than that, stuck to the recipe. It was pretty dry, and did not need to bake as long as the recipe states. I am not sure what I would do differently next time, if it would be to increase the milk and sour cream, or the cheese itself. Either way, it will have to be tweaked a bit next time. Good recipe to tailor to your liking, so I will be using this again.

I made this last night for supper. It was excellent and pretty quick. I added 4 strips of bacon cut into small pieces, used 2 1/2 C of macaroni and also mixed in a little adobo sauce which gave it a nice heat. My boyfriend and co-workers loved it! Yummy!

I loved this recipe. I used fat free sour cream and 2% milk and it was so suprisingly good. The carrots and the whole wheat pasta just add more flavor and take away the guilt!

Used cream freche instead of sour cream because it was what I had, otherwise exactly the same and it was excellent. Next time I'll sprinkle some paprika on top, but it was gorgeous without.

I added a few strips of bacon that I cooked before hand, and a little nutmeg. This is comfort food without piles of butter (I cut it by half), and with low fat sour cream and skim milk, plus the veg, this is a super satisfying meal with only half the guilt (obvs because of the copious amounts of cheese.) Only problem is I wanted seconds...and thirds. Better put it away now before I eat more...

The only thing that can make this yummier is bacon! I used 1% milk and reg sour cream, and a bit more pasta (full package is 2 1/2 cups).

Soo yummy. I used regular macaroni, skim milk instead of whole, and added some garlic powder and a little nutmeg to the mixture as well. I didn't have 2.5 cups of cheddar so I filled the rest with shredded mozzarella that I had. I also added some panko bread crumbs to the top . Cooked 30 minutes and it was golden brown and firm but still tender. Definitely will make again and I think I might try adding diced ham or other ingredients. Yum!

I'd put 1/2 the recommended butter (or maybe less). Crunchy top yield High Yum Coefficient. Instead of sour cream, we used greek yogurt, which worked fine, and we felt good about it because it's good protein and not more fat on top of the cheese and butter.

I made this for some kids who were coming to an 'adult' party. All the adults wanted the mac and cheese. Great flavor, PERFECT color, really yummy. I didn't use whole wheat macaroni but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

This was easy... used non fat milk, and light sour cream. In the future will leave out 1/3 of the butter and add bacon.

Great result!! We used half/half instead of whole milk, light sour cream, more pasta(1/2 cup more), lots more pepper, and added the tiniest bit of stinky, nutty French cheese to the cheddar. Baked in a casserole dish and would do 5 to 10 minutes more in the oven to get an event crunchier top!

This recipe was easy and yummy. It had a lighter feel than I expected, which was great. The only change I made was to use low-fat sour cream.
