I followed the recipe and wasn't thrilled with the results. It was pretty, yes, but basically tasted like liquified beets. I doubt I'll make it again, but if I did I'd work to add more flavor.

I followed the recipe although I left out the dill and chives at the end as I had none on hand. I had a bowl while it was still steaming hot and fresh from the blender, and I only liked it. But then when I served it chilled the next day, I thought the texture and flavors were so much more powerful. Based on that, I decided to give it a delicious rating.

My wife laughs when I say "Beet Soup" is The Key to Life! My Mom and Grandmother made this. A couple of variations to try are: Add a teaspoon of cider vinegar for a bit of tartness. Add quarted, hot potatoes to cold soup. Serve with warm rye or pumpernickle and real butter, not spread.

surprisingly delicious (so good I'm freezing gallons using my garden beets)...I sauteed the red onion and garlic first, deleted the sugar, used water and broth. Great as hot soup too

After making this I really thought I had to write something in the reviews, here- I've never made a 4-star epicurious recipe that disappointed me, until this one. From the reviews I was expecting this to be a killer soup, but after I followed the recipe exactly as written, I thought it was 'good' at best. Beets are one of my favorite veggies and I wasn't that keen on this soup... wouldn't recommend this.

What a simple and yet fabulous soup! No need for the sugar, just like all the others have already stated. I did add a touch of sea salt though. This is be a regular go to soup for us, it was too easy to believe! I served this as a 1st course at a dinner party for 10 people and they loved it. I served it in small white tea cups and the color presentation had super wow appeal. A great way to start a meal.

I agree with previous reviewers. Leave the sugar out and taste before salting. I didn't have any fresh dill, so mixed dried dill with the sour cream the day before serving, which allowed the flavors to integrate. I also used an immersion blender with great results.

I made this with veggie stock, a bit more carrot then called for and didn't add any salt or sugar. Topped with sour cream, fresh dill and chives from the garden and it was a HUGE hit! I only chilled it for the minimum amount of time, as I was having company that evening, but next time I will make it the day before to see how the flavors develop. Highly reccomend it!

This is a delicious soup. Agree with other reviewers that its sweet enough without added sugar. I used a stick blender, and the resulting soup was smooth, velvety, and a beautiful color. I mixed dry dill with high-fat yogurt to use as a topping with the fresh chives. The flavor is even better after a couple of days in the fridge. I have not been a beet lover in the past, but am making an exception now!

A sophisticated take on the borcht of my Polish upbringing! Perfect soup for s summer luncheon or dinner first course. Rich and velvety, yet light. I added buttermilk instead of sour cream, making a beautiful design in the center of the bowl. Taste before adding salt or sugar. The amount of each will depend on the saltiness of your broth and the sweetness of your beets. Will def. make again.

I made this tasty soup to take to a birthday party. It was very well received by the guests. I left the soup with the host who agreed with the review that said that the longer the soup sat the better the flavor. The only modification I made was to use a little less broth because we like our soups on the thicker side.

This is delicious and easy. I doubled it keeping the proportions the same. I planned to serve half at a dinner party for four and keep the rest for myself, but at the end of the party there was almost no soup left--everyone wanted seconds.

I made this recipe w/ golden beets rather than red, sweet onion rather than regular, no sugar (as suggested by a cook from Holmdel below) and better chicken stock. I also boiled an additional cup of beet/carrot/onion mix in water to cover (replenished when it got low)for about an hour and added this liquid to the soup to enhance the yellow color. It turned out great, better than I could have hoped for. I made it for a group of 10 foodies and got excellent reviews. Serve in summer for best results.

This chilled soup is a standard in our house every summer. It's thick and delicious and, yes, it is a beet lover's soup. Using sweet onion and bringing it to a brisk simmer for closer to 40 minutes makes the need for sugar redundant. It's simple and delicious and EASY!

This soup is great, but strictly for beet-lovers. The longer the soup chills, the better. Also, be sure to add a lot of chives, as they give the soup a wonderful texture.
