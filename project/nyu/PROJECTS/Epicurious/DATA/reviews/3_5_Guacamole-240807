Excellent... I used lime instead of lemon and halved the garlic. Yum!

Very good. I used 1/2 the lemon juice and was generous with the onion and garlic. Also, I used cherry tomatoes. Thanks!

I thought this was very tasty and used lime juice instead of lemon. Liked that the lime juice kept the avocado from getting brown overnight.

The recipe turned out great with a few minor changes. I used less lemon juice as others suggested, added a little more jalepeno and used garlic powder instead of minced garlic so the flavor would blend more evenly throughout the dish. I'll definitely make it again.

I agree with those who used less lemon / lime. I chopped the onions more finely, 1/8 inch dice or smaller, and served with home fried corn tortilla chips while we watched the Super Bowl as the Saints beat the Colts. Who dat say they don't like this dish? Who dat?

I followed this recipe, taking the other reviewers' advice that two lemons would be too acidic, I used two limes instead and added salt and cilantro and it came out great!

I took the advice of other reviewers and used less lemon juice and bit of salt. Perfect!

Great recipe - however - the road to hell is paved with onions so I left those out. If you are using salty dipping chips then don't add any salt but if you are using non-salty chips then definitely add salt. I also added pepper and that worked out well.

This is a great guac recipe. I agree with other reviews - too much lemon. I went 1/2 lemon and 1/2 lime. Also, I am not a salt user but this recipe needs a dash of salt.

It was a good recipe...I made it without jalepenos so the kids can enjoy too..The only thing I would do next time is put less lemons. It says 2 lemons for the juice but I think mine were too big and it tastes too lemony.

Awful. Too much lemon juice (lime would probably be a better choice) resulted in a very acidic guac; balance of the rest of the ingredients is also off. I should have suspected something was off when I noticed that no salt was mentioned. Honestly, store-bought mix that you add to avocados tastes much better. Yuk.

I used cherry tomatoes for better flavor and juice of 1/2 lime. All depends on the quality of the avocados, but a great and delicious recipe.

Fabulous! Guacamole that tastes the same as that found in Houston TexMex Restaurants!
