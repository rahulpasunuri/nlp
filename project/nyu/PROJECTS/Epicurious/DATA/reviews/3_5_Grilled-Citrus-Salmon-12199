Yum,yum. Had some beautiful organic, just picked Meyer lemons and oranges. No limes but used a blood orange. What a beautiful rose color the sauce was! Used orange and lemon marmalade instead of lime as that is what I had. The salmon was from my freezer, a lovely silver, caught this summer. Really, this dish was gorgeous and delish. I highly recommend trying to make it with a blood orange for a vibrant bright contrast to the salmon. BTW, I baked it since it is the middle of winter in AK!

I made this for my family of fussy eater sons. EVERYONE loved it. By the way, "coriander sprigs" is called "cilantro" in Texas. There was no mention of how to cook the grilled mango, so I marinated them in balsamic vinger and grilled them. They were a huge hit as well. I used steelhead trout instead of salmon. It's also a pink fleshed fish, but without the fishy smell and taste of salmon. Also, marinating the fish in the acidic juice for an hour basically 'cooks' it, so be careful not to over-grill the fish. I found the reserved juice needed 1/2 tsp more sugar to cut the tartness. I think it depends on how sweet your orange juice is. The family wants this again soon.

This was wonderful. Even the kids loved it. The only change I made was adding about 1 TB of Dijon Mustard and a 1 ts. of olive oil. Definately keep the marinade, I warmed it and served it with the salmon.

Alright - for starters, where is the mango they suggest grilling first in the recipe ingrediants. It might be a great recipe if only it was complete

Delicious! Made it with fresh Alaskan king salmon, searing 2 mins flesh side down and then flipping to skin side down for remainder of cooking time. Reducing the sauce gave it just a kick of nice, intense citrus flavor on top.

great and easy! :-) i substituted lime marmalade with reduced sugar orange marmalade. and cilantro for fresh dill. came out amazing. boil and reduce marinade to use as sauce for salmon, or as vinegarette for spinach salad. very yummy!

This is one of the best salmon recipes I've ever made. I just wish it was easier to find lime marmelade (I don't always have the time to make my own). Haven't tried it with orange--maybe next time.

Finally--a recipe that makes Costco's farm raised salmon taste good! The salmon stayed moist and the sauce was delicious. I didn't have lime marmalade, so I used orange marmalade instead. I've tried many salmon recipes on this site and so far this is my favorite. My husband agrees, and he's not a big salmon fan. While I'm reluctant to use it on the more expensive wild salmon, I might try it next time I splurge on a good piece of Alaskan salmon.

This is a great and easy recipe! It has become a stape in our house. I usually add a lot more ginger, but that's because I love ginger. Some curry to the sauce is a good twist as well. Enjoy!

Excellent! I served this at a party last night and it was a hit. Because I cooked for 20, I used skinless salmon and baked it at 450 for 15 minutes instead of grilling. I also used orange marmalade. Very good - lots of compliments.

I'm wondering if this is a British recipe? The lime marmalade, and coriander, rather than cilantro, made me curious. Anyway, also couldn't find the lime, so used orange marmalade, and added zest of one lime to the mix. Used parsley instead of cilantro due to having a cilantro-hating guest (Dad) here for Father's Day. It was an excellent dish, and received rave reviews. Made a lot of sauce, and we put it in on a 3 1/2 pound salmon that we cut into two large fillets. Stayed moist when grilling.

Delicious and easy to make. Wilkins of Tiptree, England make an excellent lime marmalade which is available in my local deli and which,I imagine, should be obtainable elsewhere.In an emergency I have used a triple fruit marmalade bought in my local chain grocery.

Made this just as described with the sofrito bread and grilled mango. Everybody liked something. I had to use orange marmalade - the regular grocery store didn't have lime. But it was still great. I served the reserved juice/marmalade combo on the side as a sauce which was excellent.

Didn't expect to find lime marmalade in my pantry at the last minute; hoped for orange, found GUAVA . Added candied ginger to the marinade. Tasty change from my usual lemon grilled salmon.

Delicious. Light and refreshing. Did not have lime marmalade and subsituted fig jam and lime zest.

Delicious fresh and summery. Served for my father-in-law's August birthday. Used orange marmalade, omitted the orange juice and upped lemon and lime juices to 1/2 cup each. FYI, coriander is the same as cilantro. I used whole leaves rather than chopped, and served with additional fresh cilantro leaves. The flavors were light, but memorable.

This recipe is fantastic! Couldn't find coriander sprigs so I substituted fresh rosemary, also substituted a lemon-orange marmalade for the lime called for and it turned out great. Will certainly make this again.

I served it with mango salsa instead of grilled mangos and it was delicious.

I made this dish while staying at Yosemite two years ago. My guests still remember how good and impressive it was. I couldn't locate lime marmalade and used orange marmalade instead. It worked really well.

Very, very simple to make, i left out the corriander sprigs..100% winner ..girlfriend commented the grilled mango maybe didnt complement the dish, too much citrus but i disagreed..knock out..do it !!

This dish was a huge hit at our "moving out" BBQ. I could not find lime marmalade, however, and used lime curd... worked wonderfully.

I thought this was OK, but not extraordinary. The citrus sauce is yummy, but otherwise the marinade is pretty faint.

This is a fabulous recipe. Easy to make, and with excellent flavor. But you must make the mango and sofrita bread to go with it!

We thought this was a great recipe. I was fresh out of lime marmalade (who stocks that??!)so I just added peeled lime wedges (yum). I did this under my broiler and it was fantastic. You do need to like ginger though and fortunately both my husband and I do. Quick and easy.

I tried this recipie with minimal ingredients, leaving out the lime and marmalade and increasing the others. I found it excellent with frozen salmon grilled and pouring the excess marinade over while grilling. a great addition is fresh chopped parsley! or served with some parmesean couscous.

I had to jot this recipe down in a hurry, as my computer did not want to print it. I forgot the lemon juice, substituted Peach Mango jam for the marmalade, and used fresh grapefruit instead of orange. It was great. Zesty and fresh-tasting. Instead of mincing the ginger, I used my trick of cutting 1/8 inch slices and placing them in my garlic press (you have to place the "grain" of the gingerroot slices parallel to the holes for it to work well - lots of juice!!). Everyone loved this recipe.

I've made this twice now and my whole family loves it. I substituted lemon marmalade for the lime which I couldn't find, and added some lime zest.It turned out fantastic! The second time I made it I forgot to add the cilantro,it was missed ,but the dish still tasted good.

I really wanted this recipe to be delicious! The marinade was too labor-intensive, and didn't add anything at all! The sauce poured overtop after you grill the fish overwhelmed the flavor of the fish. Maybe suitable for frozen filets, but don't waste fresh ones with this recipe. I agree -- plain old lemon, butter, salt and pepper is better.

We had high hopes, but noone in my household liked this recipe. Noone at the BBQ even mentioned it.... It was OK, but plain old lemon, butter, salt, and pepper is much nicer. I was suprised by the lack of flavor...We eat salmon often and this did not knock our socks off at all....

This was a big hit at my Mother's Day cookout. Two self-professed salmon haters at the table loved it. I was concerned about the one hour marinating time, thinking the citric acid might "cook" the fish like in ceviche, but it was perfectly flavored and very tender. Used orange marmalade in place of the apparently elusive lime marmalade to good effect. The smoky flavor imparted by grilling the salmon was a perfect counterpoint to the fresh citrus notes and cilantro. I made a cucumber salsa from another recipe on this site as a complement. Outstanding. I will be making this one over and over again.

Simple & delicious & went very well with the grilled Mango - what an interesting idea. Couldn't bear to simply discard the marinade so I heated it & served it to the ginger lovers at the table: very strong, but popular in small doses.

This recipe is great. I've fixed it many times but have had to stop cooking it because my sister-in-law has also adopted it as a staple. I've used Apricot Preserves instead of Lime marmalade and compensated by adding slightly more lime juice. THis is really a no fail recipe and everyone loves it even people that aren't partial to fish.

The next time someone tells you they don't like fish-- make them this dish. It will blow their socks off! I'm a ginger freak, so I substituted ginger marmalade for the lime, and it was wonderful!

Couldn't find lime marmalade so I added Minutemaid frozen limeaid concentrate to the marinade w/ a bit of sugar. I skinned my salmon because there's more surface area to marinate. Cut the fillet with the grain (cross-wise) into spatula blade-sized pieces and it's no sweat to grill it and flip it without losing it through the grate. I also added a few chunks of water-soaked hickory wood to the charcoal for more flavor. It was fantastic and the guests loved it.

This dish has become an anticpated annual event and perfect excuse for a Summer gathering of relatives and friends. For nearly 4 Summers we have gathered people at our home for an annual grilled salmon dinner using this recipe. Only variations I have tried is the addition of one chopped jalepeno pepper and a touch of a very fine balsamic vinegar. It adds a bit more zing, but still does not overpower the salmon.

This meal was wonderful! We made it for guests, and I wanted a dish that I could make with both fish and chicken. The citrus marinade worked equally well on both. Very easy, too, to coordinate the whole meal, and have most of it ready before the guests arrived.

We loved this, but we substituted the lime marmalade with low sugar orange. We also chose to chop fresh Italian and curled parsley from the garden instead of using coriander.

Fabulous! Made this with the sofrito bread and grilled mango, also served a Thai cucumber salad. Everyone loved the meal and each person had a different 'favorite'. I really believe that if you decide to make the fish, make the bread and the mango, the combination of flavour is wonderful. I agreed with the review who said the marinade complemented the salmon without overpowering it.

The whole dinner is a little more complicated than most of the meals in the "quick" category, I think it took more than 45 mins. But FABULOUS! Great grilled mangoes, great grilled bread, great fish! Whichever thing I was taking a bite of was the thing I thought was the best! Hubby agreed!

The whole dinner was very tasty, especially the mango. Salmon still held it's flavour while allowing the marinade to complement the meal.

I love salmon and also mangoes. But, I have never thought of grilling the mango with the salmon. This recipe, in my opinion, was the absolute most delicious food I have ever grilled!!! The mango becomes so juicy it's unbelievable. The reserved juice mixture to add last is really great! However, I never found any "lime marmalade" so I bought some "orange marmalade" and that was fabulous!!! A perfect "10" recipe for grilling.

This dish is amazing -- so easy and elegant. The flavors are clean and sublime. We prefer the salmon on the rare side, and the mango is a jammy, surprising accompaniment. We often serve this to guests on our patio during the summer. It's been a staple for us since it was published.
