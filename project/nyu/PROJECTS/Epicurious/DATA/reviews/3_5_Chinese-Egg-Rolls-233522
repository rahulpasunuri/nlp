Wow! These egg rolls were surprisingly easy to make, albeit, messy. I followed the recipe as written, with some leftover pork roast. The key is hot, hot oil. They cooked in minutes. I served with cream cheese rangoons from the Spark People site.

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe! My hubby and I have been making it for a few years, and it is a huge hit every time. We don't make any changes to the filling recipe, though sometimes we use won ton wrappers to make cute little mini egg rolls. Sometimes we make extra filling to serve over rice - delicious!

I loved this recipe. I consider the cabbage in most egg rolls a filler, (even though I love cabbage). I made the recipe with ground pork, but I will use leftover roast pork next time, mostly for the texture. I had a bit of a problem with the egg rolls opening a bit during frying, but adding a bit of egg wash before sealing the edge seemed to remedy this issue.

These were delicious! Yes prep time is extensive but so well worth it. Followed recipe to the letter except substituted ground pork for the roast pork. Amazing, and my husband and I had a great time in the kitchen. Made a stirfry as well and hardly touched it. The egg rolls were too good!!

I added cabbage (actually, I cheated and used a bag of coleslaw mix) and fresh bean sprouts. Also substituted ground pork for roast pork. I doubled the recipe because my boyfriend can eat about 10 egg rolls in one sitting ... I figured if I was going to make the effort, I may as well get a lot out of it. I ended up with 80 ... yes, 80! .. egg rolls. As it turned out this was great. I froze them in my Food Saver and had them in the freezer to reheat in the oven. Usually we dip them in a mixture of soy sauce, apricot jelly, and sriracha.

First time I made this recipe, my husband and I both thought something was missing. I know they said "hold the cabbage" but it was just too gooey. The next time, I used ground pork instead of the pork roast, sauteed a half a head of napa cabbage (sliced thin), bean sprouts and some chopped onion with the other matchstick vegetables. MUCH BETTER!!

Excellent!!! I added glass noodles (aka mung bean noodles) to the mix to make them more like Thai Egg Rolls. Soak until soft, then cut into short lengths. The noodles take on the flavor of all the ingredients when cooked. Toss them in toward the end and cook for a few minutes before making up the rolls. If you are use to adding cabbage in your rolls - try the glass noodles; You'll never go back to adding cabbage in your rolls again!

THESE are INCREDIBLE. Delicious, better than any restaurant. I substituted a blend of Oyster and Portabello mushrooms for fresh Shiitake and they were wonderful. Making the filling the night before is a great time saver.

Best egg rolls I've ever had. I made this as part of a menu (including the hot and sour soup and potstickers both from epicurious) and the egg rolls and soup were raved about even weeks following the meal! Flavorful and easy - the toughest part is the frying! I'm making them now for a shower, but I'm going to quarter the egg roll wrappers and make minis for appetizers.

I agree with all. Delicious: I took them to my church potluck and they were the only dish completely gone. Time consuming: It did take me maybe 2 hours to make them. I think next time I would double the recipe, because I found they they only made 20, which as long as one is taking the time to make them, 20 doesn't seem enough. I chopped the shrimp in my food processor; good idea: we had flavor instead of texture. I served them with a sauce made of soy sauce, apple jelly and crushed red pepper.

If you are using Nasoya brand egg roll wrappers, it only makes six when you half the receipe (we halved it because we were only cooking for three). All six egg rolls were gone in ten minutes flat. Make the full receipe!!! We didn't use shrimp while we doubled the pork but it was still tasty. We used a sweet peanut sauce for dipping and it was very good. Basic soy sauce also works. It took a long time to chop up the veggies so we may try to chop them using a food processor next time. It may have been a yummy ten minutes but three hours of prep was a bit much.

This dish has caused me to no longer order dumplings or egg rolls out. It is an incredible recipe. It produces a delicate dumpling that packs alot of flavor!

Delicious and fairly simple recipe--given what it is. I added cabbage simply because I like the flavor, and it turned out well.
