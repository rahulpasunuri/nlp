This was not as good as I hoped, but the fault may have been mine rather than the recipe's. I omitted the plantains because I couldn't find them at my local market. In the end the fish itself was fantastic but the liquid was too thin. Perhaps the starch in the plantains would have worked as a thickener. I will try again with the plantains. Maybe I will also add coconut milk next time - Bahia style.

This recipe was good and relatively quick and easy. I used a mixture of cheaper white fish (tilapia and swai) and cut the recipe in half, but used the full amount of marinade and oil. The proportions were good and the flavor was delicious. I served the stew over creamy polenta, with bread on the side.

Made this tonight to use up four giant fish filets my boyfriend brought home. So much more delicious than expected! At a mild simmer, it took longer than 20 minutes for the top layer (shrimp) to cook through; I'd say closer to half an hour. I'm a huge vegetable fan and used a whole bouquet of parsley and cilantro, as well as more bell pepper than called for. Chopped kale or spinach would be two good ways to increase the veg factor here.

Outstanding!!! I used catfish instead of cod and it came out great. I had to turn the heat up a little at the end to steam the shrimp properly. All in all, it was super!

This soup was incredible! It's almost like a hot and spicy cerviche. I plan on having a pot on hand all summer long. It's very tasty and chock full of healthy things. Don't omit the plantains, they make the dish! I used less white fish. (3 pounds of quality fresh fish can get very expensive!) Also, when simmering the soup, I added a little white beer to the mix.

Just made this today. The fresh flavors throughout were incredible! I used a couple of shortcuts. First I made the stock from 2 cup canned vegetable stock plus 2 cups canned seafood stock -- you can't tell the difference from the recipe. Second, I used quick grits instead of polenta -- again you can't tell the difference. I will definitely make this again.

My favorite homemade soup. Also a nice little mental pick-me-up for cold midwestern winter days. The broth is insane. I used extremely sub-par frozen fish and that was the worst part. If you don't have good fish, just don't use any at all...stick with shrimp.

While it might not be perfectly "authentic" as a Bahian dish, it is exceptionally tasty! I cut the recipe in half for two people, and we had just enough left over for lunch today. I used ample pepper as suggested - the heat really does help make the dish. Used a bit more of the marinade too. The only slight change I'll make next time is to perhaps pre-steam or lightly cook the onion and plantain, which after 20 mins. were just a bit undercooked. Scallops might be really good in this dish, too....

Made this for dinner - after his first bite my hubby said this was definitely a 4-star recipe and a keeper. The soup was delicious: light, sweet and salty. I got some bread to serve with the soup but it was fantastic all on its own.

it'll be 8 pieces of fish weighing 6ozs each. I will make this tonight

Great recipe. I changed a bit. Used different fish - what ever was available and cheap (salmon, halibut, flounder) Added white wine Serrano chilli fresh ground pepper can't beat with fresh sourdough and easy to make.

I was only a couple of months back from a wonderful vacation in Rio for Carnival when I came across this recipe in Bon Appitet. I read it and thought it reminded me of a dish I had at a wonderful restaurant near the beach about 45 minutes outside of the city. It was called Fruita de Mar (the spelling may be off) or Fruit of the Sea. It was amazing - as was most of the food there. I immediately called some friends and invited them over for dinner. The stew was easy to prepare and just like I remembered it (although I used rice as my base and not manioc - which is really an acquired taste and texture.) I came here to search down this recipe so that I could make it for an upcoming dinner party, so to say I would make it again is an understatement.

This is a fantastic, surprisingly easy recipe. The broth - which comes entirely from the reducing vegetables - is sweet, spicy, and delicious. One note - how much fish is the recipe calling for? Is it 8 6-ounce pieces, or 8 pieces totaling 6 ounces? I just used a pound and a half of snapper and it was great - but I'm curious.

This was great -- the hubby gobbled it down for 3 consecutive meals. I had a bit more fish, so I doubled the pepper flakes and lime juice for marinade. Used only orange bell peppers, skipped the plantains and added 1/2 cup light coconut milk per another reviewer's suggestion. Sublime.

I am sorry to say it but as a brazilian this is not the Brazilian Fish Stew (Moqueca capixaba). There are no plantations on the Moqueca and the recipe is quite different. Don`t know why they put this recipe here because the technique and ingredients for the real moqueca capixaba are easily found on US.

I tried this the other night. It was kinda bland.

I did add a little amount of red pepper. I had no green bell peppers so used all yellow but still came out delicious. The cooking time is accurate on the recipe. Will make it again.

Thought this was an easy, healthy dinner. Living in Guam we have the cooking banana, a sweet version of the plantain. I thought the cooking banana added a great sweetness to the stew. This will be added to my recipe box for frequent use!

Another good Brazilian stew... next time I will leave the plantations out... I agree they don't add anything. I will also increase the amount of red pepper to kick it up a little more.

Excellent flavor and very easy to make. Next time I would leave out the plantains as I didnt see the point in them. Maybe add another fish or veggie to your liking. Overall I loved this dish.

Very good. The family loved it!!!

This was very good. My market did not have plantains so I substituted a small turnip (diced) microwaving it to partly cook it (3 minutes). I used cooked frozen shrimp and put it in at the last minute. The family loved it. Muito Ben!!!

Made this last night for my husband and I with 2 portions of fish, about 20 medium shrimp, 1 t Sambal Oleek for the chili, and half the vegetables. Couldn't find yellow plantain so I substituted a green plantain. Still could have been a bit hotter. I heated the vegetables before I added the fish (hake) and the time of 20 minutes was perfect.

This stew was better the next day. Although it was tasty, my guests did not rave about it. It took longer to cook than the recipe indicated.

If you need a simple, healthy but flavorful dish for weekly meal, you got it all here. Cut the recipe in half to serve just me and my boyfriend (with some leftovers for lunch tomorrow) and it still worked fine. I also agree this dish NEEDS heat, so do not go mild on the peppers. I actually added more and still thought it was too mild.

I couldn't find plantains at my lame local market and so used a greenish banana. It was still delicious, healthy and a pleasure to make. Wonderful visuals and aroma. I will make it again with plantains next time.

Tasty, fragrant, easy, light, healthy. I loved this. Was afraid it would be too spicy so only used a small amount of red pepper flakes but next time would use the full amount as I think it would be great with the spice. Not as great as a left over since the shrimp get a bit dried out with time.
