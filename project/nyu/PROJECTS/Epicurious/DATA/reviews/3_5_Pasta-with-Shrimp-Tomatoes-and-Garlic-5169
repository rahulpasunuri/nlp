Easy but nothing special. Added red pepper flakes and lemon to recipe but still nothing to brag about. It was kind of bland.

This was very plain. I didn't add anything other then the recipe and found it very bland. Surprised it got such high ratings. Usually this site is pretty accurate.

Wonderful, healthy, easy meal! Like others, I added a little cracked red pepper; I also added a little lemon juice. It's a keeper!!!

The egg white coating on the shrimp didn't seem to help the dish - the coating flaked off in the pan while cooking with the sauce and made it look curdled. Otherwise, the dish was pretty good, and very easy to make

This is a fantastic and easy recipe! I a agree, next time I'll give it a little kick. Added salt, pepper, and parmesan and a little more basil. Angel hair is best. I used linguine because that was what was in the house, but next time I will hold out for angel hair. Great!

I made this recipe as written, except that I used a can of drained diced tomatoes. It seemed to me that the "sauce" was really more of a garlic-wine broth. I like the concept, but I would make it differently if I were to make again. I would not substitute canned tomatoes, and I would only use 1/2 cup (not 1 1/2 cups). I would skip the egg and cornstarch entirely. I would use more garlic, plus 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper. I would only use 1/3 cup of wine. I might add mushrooms or lemon juice/zest. And the fresh basil is essential!

Nice light, simple pasta dish. I accidentally bought cooked shrimp so i didnt do the egg & cornstarch but it turned out fine.

Perfect! Just like a healthy shrimp scampi!

This was so fast and so delicious! Definitely add a little crushed red pepper (or something with a kick) when the shrimp and broth are simmering at the end. I will be making this again soon.

Easy, delicious and fast. Sprinkled a little cayenne over for extra zip.

Very quick and easy. Very good, too. I used canned tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano because I did not have fresh tomatoes. It will take a little longer to reduce if you don't drain the tomatoes. (I will next time.) I still used the minced garlic because my husband and I love garlic. I also used a few more shrimp. I will definitely make again.

Very nice and so easy. The egg mixture is essential to make the shrimps soft and tender. I love this recipe.

I cooked the shrimp in Emerils seasoning. I used Athenos Basil and tomatoe feta (I used the whole 8 oz's. I grated some lemon peel(with my ginger grater) into the dressing, also added 1/2 tsp oregano-used a orange pepper, 1/2 cup shredded fresh basil, and DelBols gluten free rice penne (I am gluten intollerant). It was missing some UMPH so I put some fresh black pepper and some salt. Would definitely make this one again, maybe next time w/ fresh mozzerella and parmesan. Parmesan in cold pasta salads seem to give it a sharpness that this was missing.(thats why I used more feta. Maybe those who thought this was bland needed some S &P.

I tried out this simple, low-fat version of this shrimp scampi and it was delicious. I liked the fact that it didn't require any butter or heavy cream, but it still had tons of flavor. I didn't bother with the wine or egg mixture to cook the shrimp. I added some baby bella mushrooms and minced onions. For acidity, I threw in some red wine vinegar. We loved it!

This was a fine, one-time easy dinner, but I wouldn't bother making it again. I added a bit of freshly-grated parm to top, which was very nice.

Although this recipe is quick and simple to make it lacks some zip. I added to the shrimp 8 large scallops which I seared in a hot pan to caramelize. Cooking the scallops first, as they take longer to cook than the shrimp. I then added a 1/2 teaspoon of chilies to the tomato sauce as well as 3 cloves of garlic rather than 1. The recipe is for 2 people I rather think that it may well be OK for 4.

This dish was easy to make and tasted great!

I doubled the recipe to make more reasonably sized portions for 2. I also used Yellow Teardrop Tomatoes. I did have to almost overseason it with basil and some all-purpose seasoning to outweigh the wine flavor. It still feel like it could use something more or be better as a cream sauce.

Rating: 4
A fine example that a few very good ingredients can make a very tasty dish! I leaned heavy on the garlic(as usual) and drained my organic fire-roasted diced tomatoes before adding them. Loved it with linguine!

After reading a majority of the reviews, I made this receipe with the changes recommended. I doubled the garlic, used my homemade tomato sauce in place of the diced (which had mushrooms and onions in it), I added green onion, doubled the shrimp and cooked it seperately. In addition, I used approximately 1+ teaspoons of salt and some crushed red pepper. My husband and I enjoyed it very much - would make it again!

We loved this! I am a new cook and found this to be very simple, though I did make quite a few variations. I used tomato sauce instead of diced tomatos (my boyfriend hates them). I also added more garlic and some basil. I took someone's advice from before and sauteed my shrimp separately, then added them to the sauce. It was excellent and prevented egg whites in the sauce. We will definitely make this again...soon!!!

Added more garlic and more cooked shrimp-just blah! It wasn't bad just blah! Need to drink lots of wine and buttered bread with this dish.

This was a great dish!! I did make some changes, added more shrimp, added about 7 cloves of minced garlic and a pinch of red pepper flakes into the oil while sauteeing the shrimp. Also added some chopped sundried tomatoes along with the fresh and added the basil to the sauce while cooking then as a topper with lots of parmesean. A definite keeper, liked it much better thaa a typical scampi!!

THIS IS THE BEST EVER!!! Here is what we did different: Used 1 whole small bulb garlic. used 1 lb of 15-21 count shrimp. added mushrooms, cooked first and removed before sauce. Cook mushrooms and then cook sauce in same skillet. peeled and seeded tomatoes, which reduced cooking time for sauce. used bowtie pasta, DON'T OVERCOOK SHRIMP! Very yummy.

It wasn't that this dish was bad, it just wasn't all that good. I made the recipe as listed, adding a bit more garlic, however it was really missing something. If I were to make it again, I would add some fresh slivered basil, or perhaps rosemary? Really it needs any spice that could round out and kick up the sauce a bit. Otherwise, it's just shrimp over noodles.

This is a great meal for company when you don't have time to cook. I also used the precooked shrimp and had some garlic bread with it.

Rating: 4
I rated this highly because it's delicious but ALSO because it's SO easy. Changes I made to make it even easier/better: I doubled the garlic, used precooked shrimp, but still used the velveting coating and just stir-fried until the coating cooked, then removed the shrimp before I simmered the sauce. (I HATE cleaning/deveining shrimp) I also process the tomatoes in the cuisinart to a crushed consistency as I always do rather than dice. I sprinkled the top with parmesan, and you couldn't tell what was egg white and what was parmesan. Next time, I would probably just increase the tomatoes to about a pound per 2 servings. Great easy recipe.

I used 3 cloves of garlic instead of one and added about one cup of sauteed, sliced mushrooms too. A delicious and simple dish which I will surely make again!

Recipe was great. Would definitely make again. I doubled the sauce.

Two criticisms: I needed to know whether or not to drain the tomatoes, and when I drained the shrimp, should I run cold water over them so I don't get cooked egg whites in my sauce? Other than that, we enjoyed the dish. I will make it again, but with these modifications: I will make roasted garlic ahead of time (we couldn't really taste the garlic in this dish). I will NOT drain the tomatoes, I WILL run cold water over the shrimp before draining, and I will cook the shrimp separately in a pan of 2 tblspns olive oil and lots of roasted garlic for 3 minutes. Then, I'll put the shrimp on the pasta, and pour the sauce over it when it's cooked. Yum!

This is great! The flavors make for a nice, simple summer dinner. I also was surprised how fast it all came together. I did not drain the shrimp as well as I should have from the mixture, so I was fishing out pieces of cooked egg white, but my date didn't seem to notice. (Distracted by the cook, I'm sure! ;) I also used twice as much garlic, and it still came out with nice flavor. A keeper for a quick dinner. Try it!

A perfect combination of fast, simple and delicious. Even BETTER if you leave the shells on the shrimp for more flavor, and don't be afraid to use LOTS more garlic! If you use Angel Hair pasta, put it into the boiling water the same time as you start cooking the shrimp, and everything is done about four minutes later. We drank the same Woodbridge Chardonnay with this that we we used for the recipe--an excellent pairing.

This was an excellent and easy to prepare meal. Served it to my wife and we both enjoyed it. However, the recipe and directions could have been a bit clearer. Somehow the batter for the shrimp didn't take hold. Thought I did everything correctly. Used green onion in place of basil.
