The tartlets were fantastic and were loved by my guests, but definitely was more than any of us could finish. I left off the pecans and served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which helped to offset the richness of the chocolate. Although the process was time-consuming, I would make these again for special occasions.

These deserts were wonderful. And really easy to make; I made the dough a week ahead and kept it in the freezer. I ended up not bothering with the truffles, and instead used the pecans on top of the tartlets. I also served the tartlets with a simple raspberry, strawberry and blackberry sauce to balance the richness of the chocolate. Make sure the crust isn't too thick, though, and that it's evenly pressed in the tartlet pan; one of mine was too thick and it distracted from the yummy filling.

I just made the truffles- bite size to take to work. Everyone liked them. They are very rich, but decadent!

This dessert is incredibly luscious and perfect for seducing any chocoholic. Don't be put off by the seemingly long list of instructions either--it's very easy to make. My leftover tartlets kept perfectly in the freezer.
