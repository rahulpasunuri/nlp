Absolutly fantastic! First time and they turned out great tasting and beautful. They are time consuming and worth it.

Make these when you have a little time on your hands. That being said, they are well worth the effort. Absolutely delicious. I served these with minestrone and they made it a wonderfully well rounded meal. They also freeze well, just reheat them as directed in the recipe.

Wonderful! A little time consuming, but worth every minute. Guests ended up taking my frozen 'spare's home. Just as well, since these are not low fat and if they stayed in my house, they'd be gone in one (gluttonous) lunch hour. I've made the chocolate croissants with extra dough, but you;d do well to make extra braids.

Love this recipe. Serve it with a little prune chutney on the side, dress some wild rocket and you have a very elegant ladies lunch!

This is delicious and looks very impressive. Maybe it's too salty for some people but everyone liked it. It takes time to prepare, but since the baked braids can be frozen, it's wise to make a lot and you can just reheat whenever you fancy a little treat. When you form the dough into braids, it's important not to work with too much dough at one time and keep the rest in the fridge, especially if the kitchen is warm.
