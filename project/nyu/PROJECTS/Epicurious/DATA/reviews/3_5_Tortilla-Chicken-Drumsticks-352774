For an even easier and tasty coating, try corn flake crumbs, some garlic powder, paprika, and salt. This has been a favorite in my family for over 30 years!

This was a hit with my family, including the children. I would double the cumin next time, we really couldn't taste it. Squeezing the lime wedges over the drumstick really added the finishing touch.

Very good, even with coarsely smashed tortilla chips! Super easy recipe.

Thanks for the prior reviews. I was able to use my food processor and grind pretty fine. I also added more spices. My family loved this dish!

Kinda disappointed. The tortilla chips left an off flavour, chicken was tasty but would definitely not make this again with tortilla chip coating. Haven't made the crusted baked chicken legs before and enjoyed that aspect, will try again though with a different crust, i.e. panko or spiced breadcrumbs

This is a delicious dish. I cut the tortilla chips in half, but left the other ingredients as listed. I also added 2 cloves of garlic. The chicken was moist and flavorful.

We absolutely loved it! I do agree however a little more spice would do the trick. I only had boneless skinless breasts, so I lightly pounded them first. I had no problem with processing the chips into a finer crumb; my tip is the type of corn chips! I used my favorite " Organic Corn Chip Dippers" from Trader Joes. They are much like Fritos, only a little healthier:)

Yum! Thanks to the great tips from previous cooks I added extra spices and also tried some boneless, skinless chicken pieces. Turned out perfectly! In the future, I'll make it just with boneless, skinless thighs and breasts. Those were the most popular. Also, I made a goat-cheese yogurt sauce that went quite well.

corn chip are a crispy crust but pulsing them in a food prosesser does not work. No matter how much you pulse them you will still end up with large pieces and finely ground meal. Next time I would pound the in a plastic bag with a meat mallet. I tried legs with the skin on and legs removing the skin. Preferred the one without the skin. Added 1 tsp. of butter to each leg during the last 10 minutes of cooking.

Corn chips do provide crispy crust but pulsing in food prossesor does not work. No matter how long you pulse them you will still end up with large pieces and finely ground pieces. Would put them in a plastic bag and pound them with mallet next time. I did some drumsticks with the skin removed and some with skin on. Preferred skin removed ones. I added 1 tsp. softened butter to each drumstick about 10 minutes before done

Really bad. That said great idea to use tortilla chips as bread crusts. Needs flavor - imagine chile w/o onions or garlic and only cumin and chile powder. What was I thinking? I knew it would be beyond bland. Will try again but add much spice as crust on chicken was fab! Potatoes suggested to go with were fab, as was dipping sauce.

Good alternative to using breadcrumbs on your chicken. I used chicken breasts instead of drumsticks and added some salsa on top of the finished product. Tasty!
