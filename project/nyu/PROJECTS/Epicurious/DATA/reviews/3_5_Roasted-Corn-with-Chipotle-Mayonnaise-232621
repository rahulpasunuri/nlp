We loved this side dish. I peeled the husk off my corn, sprayed it with butter Pam & grilled it 15 mins (3 sides x 5 mins) and it was perfect. I agree that mayo is what makes this good: just enough to coat the corn kernels. I added the chilis 1 chopped teaspoon at a time & kept tasting. They are strong and a little goes a long way. Summer corn is so delicious you don't want to overwhelm it. A little S&P and it was done. We didn't even use the lime. This recipe is a definite keeper!

I followed the recipe to a point-- I slathered the mayo on the corn weapped it in foil and oven roasted it! Awsome. If it is to hot, dont use the whole can of chilies

To the cook who thought the chipotles in adobo were too hot and asked for alternatives.............use less chipotle.....should make it less hot but give the flavor.

This is FABULOUS. I did cheat, though. I just boiled the corn and rather than use canned chipotles, I used Buffalo brand Chipotle sauce, which is a mexican Chipotle sauce that is basically pureed chipotles in adobo. Just put a glug of it in some mayo. This is the way I will be serving corn from now on. It is just SO GOOD.

The chipottle peppers in adobo sauce are extremely hot. Once I opened the can I did not even try the recipe. A less firey pepper, actually for my family a very mild pepper would be better. Any suggestions for substitutes?
