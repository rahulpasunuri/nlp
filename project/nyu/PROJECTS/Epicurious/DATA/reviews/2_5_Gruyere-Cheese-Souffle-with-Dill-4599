Very, very good recipe. I agree that it is not necessary to boil the mixture for 4 minutes. The roux thickened the egg mixture almost immediately and I only let it boil for about 1 1/2 minutes. I used whole milk in place of cream and added 8oz of wild mushrooms that were sauteed with some garlic and chopped in the food processor. Also, I did use individual 3/4 cup ramekins and reduced the cooking time to approx. 20-22 minutes. Served as a side dish to grilled steaks and loved the combo. Delicious and different.

I made this recipe over Christmas and it turned out beautifully exactly as written. I was just looking in here to see if anyone had done it in individual ramekins, which I think I'm going to try this weekend for six people as a side. I had no problems with it like the other reviewer and have made many souffles. Hopefully I won't screw it up this weekend!

We would never make this again! We ended up with scrambled eggs! We followed the recipe exactly, and added the cream mixture (containing the egg yolks) to the flour and butter. We were careful to watch the temperature - it never even got close to boiling - but we still ended up with a pan of scrambled eggs. We were perplexed that the recipe actually instructing boiling the whole mixture for 4 minutes - we're guessing that if we did boil for 4 minutes we'd have had an omelet. We threw out the batch and started again, this time with a different recipe, which came out beautifully.

Outstanding and simple to make. It's a hearty souffle that doesn't collapse when it's baked or served (provided you don't overbeat the egg whites). I highly recommend it.
