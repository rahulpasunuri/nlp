Agree with previous reviewers who categorized this as "unauthentic, instant", "sad homage to cassolet". Despite my better judgement, made it anyway as usually Bon appetit recipes never fail... But ewwwww... Tastes just like what it is... Leftover meat floating in chicken broth and mashed up beans. 1 fork is generous.

I've never had real Cassoulet, so I couldn't compare it to the real thing, but I found this a very quick and tasty dish. Perfect for weeknights. I was looking for something to do with some leftover chicken, and used my first attempt at homemade chicken stock. Other than using chicken, I didn't change the recipe at all. I have to add that this was definitely 4 servings for me, but I served it with salad and not alone.

It was good but not worth making again.

Okay, I am one who hates when people change the whole recipe and then review it. That being said, I made a few necessary changes, and it came out fantastic. First, I sauteed a couple pieces of chopped turkey bacon. I used truffle chicken sausage, added garlic, tomatoes, carrots and used homemade turkey stock, which I cooked in my pressure cooker. Oh, and don't forget to finish with a tsp of Minor's chicken base.

Each southwestern town in France has it's own version of cassoulet, many without duck confit. This is a great basic recipe which can be revised to work with what you have in the fridge. I made it with leftover thyme-y sausage and roast chicken and it was fantastic for a casual dinner on a cold night. I LOVE cassoulet but do not have the time to make it - this satisfies my craving.

This was a quick, easy, weeknight winter meal! Very tasty and hearty! Also works as a great starter soup for many other ingredient additions and substitutions.

This has become a family favorite! Rich flavor, freezes great, quick and easy. I use left over pork loin or roast and portobello mushroom sausage. I also add a can of diced tomatos for a little change.

A very sad homage to cassoulet, even for a soup. Not the rich flavors I've come to expect from anything calling itself cassoulet or cassoulet-like.

Very tasty and satisfying winter soup. I had some leftover weiswurst that I threw into the pot. It only enhanced the flavors. I'll be making it again.

I used leftover turkey pastrami instead of sausage, leftover white rice instead of beans, and added fresh chopped carrots in chunks the last ten minutes. Family loved it!

I've made this several times with left-over game and different sausages. While it is always a little different, it is an easy tasty dinner or hearty lunch.

I'd rate this 3 1/2 forks. I made the reduced fat/higher fiber version. Turkey sausage instead of kielbasa. Added celery, corn and a few green peas, then added a little more thyme and wine to compensate for the extra ingredients. Okay, so it's not really cassoulet - who cares? It's great.

This is an easy short-cut to a great dish. Yes, a traditional cassoulet is fantastic, but it also takes too many hours -- I just don't have the time! I added a little leftover pesto sauce, and cooked the dish a little longer for a thicker result. I also added some dried mushrooms for flavor early on. I am very pleased and would make it again.

Uhhh, not to be overly-picky, but I've had cassoulet dozens of times and this is NOT it. Cassoulet definately needs to be made with a duck confit-- duck that's been cooked and preserved in its own fat, then simmered for hours with all the other ingredients (including a good, mild but peppery sausage and loads of garlic) imparts a completely different flavor. It is to die for on a cold day. Skip this and try the Julia Childs recipe. BTW, Epicurious is called Epicurious for a reason; when I want unauthentic, instant dishes using short cuts and Betty Crocker, I go to websites like allrecipes.com.

This soup was a great way to usse up leftover turkey. I used chrizo, instead of the kielbasa It gave the soup a much more interesting flavor. I also addedmexican oregano.

I'm a big fan of the classic entree, so why not make the soup in a similar fashion with classic ingredients? use flagolletes(much better and authentic bean) and try using duck confit for the predominace of the meat as well as a good game sausage and some veal shank meat

Very easy and yummy! I chose not to puree the beans and it turned out just fine to me.

Wow, this was simple and delicious! I had 3 cups of left-over goose, so doubled the recipe for my family of 4. I will use all hot sausage the next time to add a little bite. Doubled provided 4 very generous portions with bread - by generous, I mean every one could have a second bowl. I added a finely diced carrot in the last 10 minute cooking time and didn't serve a salad.

Very satisfying main dish soup, served with a spinach salad and sourdough loaf. I added 3 leeks, white part only, sliced thin. I also used my own duck stock made with carcass, onion, carrots, peppercorns, garlic, bay leaf and thyme. Delicious!

This is a great use of all those Thanksgiving leftovers. I substituted white and dark meat turkey for the goose meat and ham for the smoked sausage, and it came out great! My friends didn't even realize they were eating leftovers.
