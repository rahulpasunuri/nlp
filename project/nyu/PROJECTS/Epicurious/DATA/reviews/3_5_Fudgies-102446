These are ok, they are very easy to make. My mum loved them but I thought they were too sweet and rather boring.

These are my favorite! I use Hersheys Cocoa and they are very quick and easy to make. Within minutes they are cooled and set enough to eat! My Mom made these when I was a little girl, she called them Steve's Cookies becaues they were my brothers favorite, she got the recipe from the school I attended, they sold them during our lunch and breaks. Approx. 40yrs ago! This recipe has been around a very long time. Enjoy!

I've had much better no bake chocolate cookies. I'd much rather have the ones with coconut.

I am 11 and found these "fudgies" to be amazing. I don't like oats, and just used peanut butter. Much better than any pb/chocolate candy.

These were too easy to be so good. Definately will make them again. I used cocoa because we never have chocolate in my house and they were just gorgeous.

This recipe was fun and easy for my 5 year old to help! Very addictive!!!

Great for kids. My mom made this recipe, without the peanut butter. I like it with. My husband, however, things the oats taste like coconut, which he hates.

For someone who is not particularly fond of peanut butter, these were surprisingly good! And they are sooo easy to make.

This is absolute comfort food to me. My grandfather's wife would make these for me when we went to visit when I was a kid. They are very rich and very sweet, but if you have had a bad day, and need a quick chocolate fix, these can't be beat. And if you make them for the special kids in your life, you'll be pretty cool too.

I used bakers chocolate squares and they turned out great. They are so easy to make, just watch out, it's hard to stop eating them!

Personally,stay with the cocoa powder, preferred brand,Hershey's.My sister made these all the time and called them,"Missouri cookies". These were a favorite when a cookie and chocolate were required elements.[cocoa is un-sweetened of course,just eye ball the amount,can't go wrong.]
