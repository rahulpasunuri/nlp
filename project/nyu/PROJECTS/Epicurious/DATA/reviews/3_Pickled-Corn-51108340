If you like pickles with a little heat (add the jalapeno seeds if you want real heat) then this is a surprisingly simple and great recipe. If you use sweet in-season corn and it will be one of the best and easiest pickling recipes from this summer.

Love the recipe. Made it three times so far. I used 2T Trader Joe's fine sea salt in the brine and used my pickling crock instead of a jar. The taste is an addictive mix of sweet, slightly salty with pronounced tastes of garlic and black pepper. I really don't taste much heat from the chiles.

I prepared this recipe exactly as written, including the minimum four days of brining. It was delicious and will become part of the summer time repertoire. A tasty addition to the antipasto plate.

I made 1/2 the recipe to try. Loved it! had a friend try it and they requested recipe no changes other than used green jalapeno I had on hand will make it again.

Answer to queenofbuttons: I pickle a lot of the vegetables we get from our CSA but had never seen a preparation for corn. So I tried this one. Everyone at the dinner table agreed it mostly just tasted like cold salted corn, not overly hot or garlicky or salty, and not particularly appealing either. If you like salted corn, maybe best to stick with buttered and salted corn on the cob, served hot. If you like the simple taste of fresh corn, cut it off the cob and stir it into a salsa or whole grain salad. This pickle was neither one thing or the other, just blah I felt. There may be other brines/pickling liquids that would impart more interesting flavor, but I don't know that I'd do it again whatever the recipe. The cobs were a little hard to cut up too, so work to enjoyment ratio wouldn't make trying another recipe worth it for me. I'm interested to hear other thoughts from people who tried this preparation.

It seems to me that of ALL these reviews, only one reviewer actually MADE the recipe. Why are you giving recipes bad ratings when you haven't tried them? Just because the recipe does not sound good, or interesting, or whatever - does not mean you should give it a negative review. I see this time and again on this site, and since this is a particularly good example, I'm mentioning it. Save your comments for the dish AFTER you have made it, please - when perhaps your comments as to how you liked it, what changes you might have made, what suggestions you have to improve it - might be of use to other readers.

Very disappointed in this recipe of the day! It sure doesn't appeal to me and I won't be saving it to my recipe box. I just joined this site a few days ago and I'm still waiting for a good recipe of the day.

For the people who did make this: What was the taste like? Salty? Garlicy? Mild or strong? How many days did you ferment?

Other than being a novel use for corn, this preparation wasn't fabulous. A fun project with so-so results.

The answer to "how this is pickled corn" is malo-lactic fermentation. This is the same process that produces classic sour pickles, sauerkraut, etc. The vegetables ferment in brine, producing vinegar-like acids that transform, flavor, and preserve the foods. You can Google, y'know...

The recipes of the day are going from merely mediocre to bad. Maybe the staff is on vacation. Is anyone minding the store?

It must be difficult when you know everything to see simple and uncomplicated recipes offered. It brings to mind a recipe for Joel Robechon's (one of the greatest chefs of all time) masterful mashed potatoes, potatoes, butter, milk and salt. It's a shame that such a non-recipe would be passed over by "A Cook" because of its simple, but refined elegance.

The definition of pickling is: " A solution of brine or vinegar, often spiced, for preserving and flavoring food". Salt water is a brine.
