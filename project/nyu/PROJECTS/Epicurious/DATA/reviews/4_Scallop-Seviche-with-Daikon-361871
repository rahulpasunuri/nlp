Even though we had to use frozen scallops, this recipe rocked. Daikon was understated. We sub-ed Tamari for the the soy sauce due to gluten issues. Also used a fresh red pepper in more than the 1/8 teaspoon called for. Yum

This was excellent and a nice light appetizer that went together easily. I did change it a bit. I chopped the scallops before marinating and drained them before serving. If you marinate at least 1/2 hr. they absorb plenty of flavor. I used crushed red pepper instead of chopped red chile and diced radishes (4 large) instead of daikon. I also added a bit more soy and salt to the marinade. Before serving, added a chopped avocado which gave it great color and added to the creamy flavor of the scallops. Rice cracker were a perfect accompaniment. A real winner!

Wow, I am amazed that this was delicious. I've never had scallops prepared this way. Very filling, too- more so than when cooked. I think I'll try the other scallop seviche recipes on this site.
