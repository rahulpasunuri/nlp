With a houseful of foodies, not much gets thrown away here. I was intrigued by the previous cook's increasing the spices from a measly 2 teaspoons to a total of 23! Bad idea! I'd try again with the specified spice proportions except that we learned something else as well, that for us, gingerbread isn't gingerbread without molasses.

I made this recipe and the classic gingerbread ("Gingerbread") in the epicurious archive and took both to work. Side by side taste tests made "Honey Gingerbread" the winner! I left out the stem ginger in syrup because I forgot to get it at the store, and substituted cream for buttermilk, to no detriment. I also jacked up the spices (in both recipes) -- 4 tablespoons ginger, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, 1 teaspon cloves, 1 teaspoon allspice, and 2 tablespoons nutmeg. Watch this one especially in the last ten minutes of baking so the corners don't burn. I topped mine off by cutting into squares after cooling, then dipping the squares in a quick powdered sugar fondant as with petit-fours. Delicious!
