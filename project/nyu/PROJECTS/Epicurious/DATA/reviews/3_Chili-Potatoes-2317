I altered this slightly, using Emeril's "Essence" instead of chili powder. This probably gave the potatoes a more complex layering of flavors including cayenne, paprika, thyme, onion and garlic. Easy, crisp and light, these were a great accompaniment to a southwestern style dinner of chili relleno casserole (Epicurious recipe) and black bean/corn meal fritters.
