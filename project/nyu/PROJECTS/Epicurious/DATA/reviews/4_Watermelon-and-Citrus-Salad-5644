Made this salad this weekend...couldn't believe how delicious it was. My kids loved it! Substituted arugula for watercress (didn't have watercress on hand) and it was wonderful....

I made this for our 4th of July family get together. EVERYONE loved it, even the people who don't like watermelon!! I doubled the recipe due to the number of people we were having, although I didn't double the olive oil for the dressing. I tossed all the salad ingredients together and then dressed the salad right before serving. GREAT. It was even good left over several days later. I just added a little more of the dressing (which I had left over). We don't like our salads overly dressed.

A lovely summer salad, perfect for a brunch or a starter to a warm weather meal. Interesting flavor contrasts, my guests loved this.

Made this as part of my mother's day feast. I did modify the recipe by not including the onion. Honestly, I was a little dubious, but it really worked. Definitely one to keep on hand, especially when you want something a little different from your traditional fruit salad.

What a terrific, unusual salad. I have made a couple of times now to rave reviews. Only substitutions: I used arugula instead of watercress, mandarin oranges, and juice from the canned oranges in place of the orange concentrate. A definite keeper!

This is fabulously refreshing and so beautiful. The only change I made was to use arugula in place of the watercress.

I made this salad for a party and tossed the salad in advance. The salad has great flavor and is better when it has a chance to sit for a short period of time, I would recommend letting the watermelon drain before dressing.

Culinary crisis averted when I found this family summertime favorite on-line! [I'd misplaced (or mis-filed my well-used copy.] Don't let Summer '04 go by without trying this. I don't change a thing. It's unforgettably refreshing and cool and unusual.

Waternelon and mint was the perfect combination. The dressing was delicious and added a terrific compliment. I make it several times every summer.
