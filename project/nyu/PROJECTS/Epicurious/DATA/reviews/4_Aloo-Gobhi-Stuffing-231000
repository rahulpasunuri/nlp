This was amazing! I love Indian food and sometimes struggle to get the flavor and spice combinations right, but this was absolutely delicious. I used toasted, slivered almonds in place of the cashews because that's what I had in the pantry. I'm excited to try stuffing a chicken with this mixture.

This was the surprise hit of my Thanksgiving meal, even among guests who had previously claimed to hate cauliflower. It will definitely be going into my regular rotation of dishes for company, although I will definitely be cutting the recipe in half. It was way more than enough to feed the eight of us.

Very nice and quite easy. I used a hot curry so there was a little heat in the dish. It was a fantastic accompaniment to the traditional Thanksgiving turkey. We are saving the leftovers for the rest of the week.

Made this last night. Turned out terrific. Like other people I added a few handfuls of raisins before baking. I also toasted the cashews in a skillet beforehand. Very tasty.

I have vegans to entertain at major holidays and am always looking for interesting dishes that can be adapted for them (most of the rest of us eat pretty much everything, including meat, dairy and eggs). This dish makes an enormous amount of pretty good food--for all of us (even my vegans , who eat a LOT of food) would share this with more than 8.

This was the favorite dish at our melting-pot theme Thanksgiving. Don't change a thing.

We thought this dish rather bland; the bread did not absorb any flavors and the dish did not mesh well. Perhaps leaving the bread out would improve the dish. Probably not worth trying again.

Yumm. A lovely stuffing. I used sweet potatoes instead of russet and also added raisins. In sauteeing the vegetables I used a half olive oil half butter mixture instead.

This was easy and delicious. I served it with roast chicken basted with a sauce of melted butter, honey, dijon mustard and curry powder, and poured some of the juices over the stuffing. The combination of flavors got rave reviews from my husband. I added a few golden raisins to the stuffing plus some chopped Italian parsley for color and baked it at 375 for about half an hour alongside the chicken. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.
