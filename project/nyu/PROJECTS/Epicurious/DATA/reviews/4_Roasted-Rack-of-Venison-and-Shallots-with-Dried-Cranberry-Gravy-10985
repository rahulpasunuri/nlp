I am very fortunate that I live in Wis. and I,my family and friends are avid deer hunters so we are always looking for new recipes. This one is wonderful. I followed the shallot suggestions, Thanks all. I also used sour cream for the gravy instead of the usual cornstarch, flour, etc. Yummy!

I concur with the majority of the reviews it was fantastic and easy to do. I did cook the shallots for 20 minutes but I would not recommend the 25 - 30 minutes in the recipe. I did not use the cornstarch and the gravy was rich and flavorful although I used about 1/2 of the recommended water. The Rack cooking time was perfect 23 minutes on the button came out rare but cooked all the way through. I would put a few more shallots in as the guests craved a shallot with every bite.

I've been an avid cook for almost 40 years and have been fortunate enough to have created many delectable meals. This Rack of Venison has to rate up in the top five of all time. It was incredible. The advice of a previous reviewer was perfect...definitely only roast the shallots for 15 minutes, then put the rack of venison on the roasting pan. The shallots were incredibly sweet, carmelized and tender, but still held their shape well during serving. I paired this with roasted matchstick parnips, fennel and carrot...and turnip & potatoe gratin. We started our meal with a New Orleans style crab bisque. It was definitely one of our best Christmas Eve meals ever.

My family raves each time I make this dish. It is a great dish to make for ones who are trying venison for the first time. It also works well with other cuts of venison.

Fantastic! It's a pity venison is rather hard to find... but the sauce is beyond compare. I have a word of caution regarding the shallots: 15 minutes of roasting at 425 F is enough, and adding them to the meat at the end of the roasting time (23 minutes) is also a good idea... unless you like your shallots deeply carbonized. Another thing: use 1T arrowroot dissolved in 1T water instead of cornstarch for a sauce that's both lighter and deeper in color. Enjoy!

This may be the easiest and most wonderful special meal you will ever serve. Our guests are wondering when we are roasting venison again.

This is spectacular! So so good. We made this for two Christmas dinners and it will will be a tradition from now on. Served it over the Baked Polenta with Jack cheese (substituting sauteed shallots for the green onions). Another great side was the fruity Carrots in Tangerine. This is an easy dinner to pull off and the results are well worth the effort and expense. The rack of venison was from New Zealand. I have never had such tender and juicy venison before. The rack did come out of the overn a bit too rare, so we just did a quick sear in the skillet before serving.

I made this entire menu for Christmas dinner several years ago. It was too late to order venison, so I used beef fillet. Of the many Christmas dinners I have cooked, I consider this the best. The menu was perfectly balanced. I am going to make the recipe with venison next time and am also planning to try it with rack of lamb. The other dishes (all on this site) were oxtail bouillon with parmesan puffs, oxtail pate, brown & wild rice pilaf, puree of 3 root vegetables, mixed greens with honey vinaigrette and gorgonzola, and chocolate linzertorte.

Dinner for four over Canadian Thanksgiving weekend, in an oceanside cottage in rural Newfoundland and Labrador, with very best friends. This has become a tradition, after golf and with fine wine. Try it all. You'll love it

This has become one of my specialties. All my friends who hunt bring me the venison and rave about this recipe! I've also made it with beef tenderloin and it is equally as special.

This is the best dish I have EVER made, and it tasted like a gormet dinner! It's hard to tell that the meat is venison, and the sauce is great too! I cooked the garlic spinach potatoes with this dish and it was just outstanding.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner and it is the one Christmas recipe that has been requested for repeats by several of the people who attended--so I've made it again several times. Great with wild rice and wild mushrooms. The sauce is fabulous.

I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also used a 4 pound roast instead of the rack. I tenderized the roast by stabbing it with a knife all over - especially in the tougher parts and I poured a little extra olive oil over the roast when cooking. I added fresh rosemary to the shallots when I roasted them. This was a fabulous dish.

Unbelieveable. Absolutely delicious. As a first time venison eater I was floored. It was a simple and easy to prepare. Our guests devoured it as if they had never eaten before. A wonderful dish we hope to make again. We all so paired it with a rice dish with some pingoli nuts. So good your tongue will slap your brains out.
