This was awful. Way too much vinegar and way w-a-y WAY too much oil. All my lovely fresh herbs reduced to a bowl of sour, oily grass!

For brilliant flavor and easiness, this is tops. Used red wine vinegar and red onion on hand instead of sherry vinegar and shallot, and also used a couple Tbsp less of both oil & vinegar. Followed others' suggestions and whirred in processor until finely chopped and mixed. Served over dill + garlic roasted potatoes & steamed veggies. Makes me think subbing dill for part of the mint and parsley would be really good.

I didn't have the sherry vinegar, but I did have sherry wine, I added almost 1/3 cup of sherry and then added white balsamic vinegar to make the full 1/3 cup. I also blended all but 1/4 of the sauce once all the ingredients were added. This was wonderful.

I thought I had mint but it hasn't come up yet so I made this with parsley only. It was very good. I used it as a salad dressing. Everyone enjoyed it.

Ditto previous reviewer. Next time I might reduce the olive oil a little--make it less soupy. Great compliment to the hens.

good, easy, and what you would expect it to taste like. I think the recipe is too complicated though. Just whir everything in a mini food processor and you're done.
