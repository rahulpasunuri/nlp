Easy, yes. Pretty and impressive, yes....but as always, the Genoise is a dry cake (even after a brush of lemon syrup) and ultimately amounts to just a nice presentation for ice cream. Not very exciting.

i don't know why, but it was a disaster! The ice cream melted even when it was in the freezer, and the meringue was all liquidy and it wouldn't rise up. I ended up with cake with sauce. I am determined to try this again, hoping that I will finally get a Baked Alaska!

As everyone said this is very simple and impressive. I should have beat the egg whites a few minutes past "glossy" They were a little softer than I would have liked. This was my boyfriend's son's first baked Alaska so a lot of fun!

Excellent, I used this as the base recipe but created mini Baked Alaskas for a party, turned out perfect and not too much trouble for the final result

Absolutely marvelous! The whole foods near my apartment, interestingly enough, had plenty of mango rice ice cream and toffee soy ice cream, but NO strawberry ice cream! As such, I used raspberry sorbet and vanilla ice cream. It worked out perfectly! I placed the cake in the oven for about 2 1/2 minutes on 500, then took it out and set an eggshell filled with grand marnier on top and set it aflame (spooning the flaming liquid over the meringue). Beautiful result, will make again!

Help!! My Cake portion was a disaster! Must have over mixed. I felt like I followed every part of this receipe -- small air bubbles appeared as well which usually is a sign of over- mixing. I will try one more time and hopefully have better results. Lucky that I gave myself a head start before my Election party "Baked Alaska" ;-)

Absolutely delicious, as well as beautiful. I hardly ever bake and this recipe was very easy to follow. The cake itself has a great flavor, kudos to the poppyseed. I couldn't find strawberry sorbet at the grocery store, so I picked up whatever looked the most appetizing which at the moment happened to be chocolate cookie extreme. Surprisingly good with the cake. :) Definitely try your hand at this one!

this dessert was simply amazing! easy to make, and even better to eat. i made it for my boyfriend but my family ate the leftovers and keep begging me to make it again.

Great, easy to make. Substituted round bowl for square pan to make it easier to cut/serve. For a dinner party of 6 would halve the recipe as lots left over.

3.5 forks.While this was really easy and relatively simple to prepare, I didn't like the way the cake came out. I used the chocolate cake from 'chocolate raspberry baked alaskas' on this site. I baked the cake the 9" pan and it was perfect. The cake was very fudgey and went great with the strawberry duo. I also used a 3 quart bowl with no problems.

This is a simple, elegant dessert bound to WOW your guests. I followed directions exactly and it couldn't have been easier. Leftovers freeze well. Next time I'll try orange sorbet with vanilla ice cream. Guests we're truly impressed.

My guests were sufficiently wowed with this recipe. It presents beautifully and looks like it would be complicated to make, but it's actually fairly easy. My only complaint about the recipe is that it tells you to freeze the cake along with the ice cream layers, but this frozen cake tastes dense and not airy like I thought it would. Oh yes, and the other thing -- I bought 1.75 quarts of strawberry ice cream because I couldn't find any 1 quart containers. It took me FOREVER to calculate how much ice cream to use from my container before I realized that 1 quart = 2 pints! The recipe could have stated 2 pints strawberry sorbet, 2 pints strawberry ice cream. It would have been much easier for me to find 2 pints of ice cream. Anyways, these are just my little picky complaints. Overall, I thought this was a great recipe!

This was beautiful and delicious. I had trouble getting the cake to thicken and form ribbons, I may have gotten it too warm. The second time I made it I used a poppyseed bread recipe for the bottom, was just as good. In the future I think I will experiment with other flavors.

I can't believe I just made my first baked Alaska! It was surprisingly easy and very impressive. I think the hardest part was cutting and serving the slices without scratching my nonstick springform pan. Now I feel more confident about experimenting with different combinations of sorbets and ice creams, as well as cake foundations. The cake turned out light and fluffy, but a little sweeter than I thought necessary. The meringue was also a bit too sweet. Does anyone know whether decreasing the sugar would adversely affect the texture of the meringue?

I usually don't give out 4 forks but this cake gets the top rating for its ease of preparation and likeability. I made 2/3 of the recipe in a 7" spring form using that as a mold instead of a bowl. It was easier and still very pretty. I served it at a friend's birthday party and everyone was amazed and delighted by the concept of a baked icecream cake. I'll be making this again very soon for sure.

My guests actually mis-took me for a 'real cook' after seeing this dessert. Big Hit!

Rating: 3
I made a lot of substitutions. Instead of one big Alaskan, I made 6 small ones and just cut out smaller round circles from a store bought lemon poppyseed cake. I added too much of the egg whites so be sure to keep it to about 1/2 inch thick around or less. Used a small butane torch instead and it saved the ice cream! Was simple and presented beautifully!

Rave reviews from my guests, and what a beautiful presentation! The cake was not much more difficult to make than opening a box and would make the cake again - it all goes so well together. The whole thing is just very impressive and tastes great.

This is a divine recipe! I've made it twice in two weeks for dinner parties- only to receive rave reviews. It's presentation is beautiful - and it is such a simple recipe!

This is a great recipe for company. I made it the night before my FIL's birthday dinner. We did it after a fondue dinner. Only thing I would change is that I would leave it in the oven longer or let is sit out for a few minutes before baking. It was hard to cut post-oven. The cake is great! But, if anyone wants to save time go for it. Only thing to keep in mind is that they recipe cake is thin. That maybe play a part in the over all presentation.

This is for Sarah from San Francisco: if you don't like poppyseeds, why not leave them out? Or you could use a lemon pound cake recipe instead. As a previous reviewer said, the possibilties are endless! Good luck!

I used a box cake mix for the cake layer.....very good. I made this a few days ahead and there is still some left in the freezer....such an easy dessert yet so elegant....Just think of all the many combinations of cake/sorbet/ice cream you could use, not to mention adding chocolate chips, nuts or toasted coconut!!!!!! Possibilites are limitless!!!!!!!! Be creative.....a very refreshing summer dessert too!

My dad made this last weekend to rave reviews. It was sooooo good! And, it was really impressive looking. The cake recipe is very good as well.

I thought this was wonderful and so did my guests. I had thought about a pound cake mix instead of the poppy seed cake and decided to make exactly what the recipe called for. I think, no matter how sophisticated your culinary tastes, Baked Alaska appeals to the kid in all of us. To save time, I think you could substitue a pound cake mix but I will stick to it the way it is.

Scrumptious but too much work for ice cream!! Next time I'll definitely use a boxed lemon poppy seed cake mix - after all, the ice cream isn't homemade so why get pretentious about the short layer of cake underneath? The two strawberry flavors are wonderful together tho!

I remember the one or two times my mom made Baked Alaska when I was a kid - I thought I had died and gone to heaven! So I am anxious to try this recipe. However, I really don't like poppyseeds. I know virtually any cake would work, but I'm curious if anyone has particular suggestions for a different cake.

I made this for our family for Easter and it was FABULOUS! Rave reviews from kids and adults! I cheated a little and used a lemon poppyseed cake recipe instead, but it saved a lot of time. My brother got out his Propane torch and browned the meringue. We have great pictures!

My sister-in-law made this recipe for Easter after seeing it on the cover of Bon Apetite. I helped her with the final stages. It was delicious. Everyone loved it. The ice cream still cold, the cake was warm and tasty and the meringue was delicious. I would definitely try to make this again.
