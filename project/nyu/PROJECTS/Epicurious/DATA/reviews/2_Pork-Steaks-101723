Very good recipe. I just added some thyme, tarragon, savory, saffron, capers, mango chutney, and a demi-glace with port, along with some apples and caramelized onions and half a pound of shiitake mushrooms. Oh, and I substituted chicken for pork and olive oil for butter. >:)

Recipe far too complicated and ingredients hard to find.
