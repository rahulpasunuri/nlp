This is so poorly written and confusing. Good thing I didn't make these, once you get to the jelly portion of the directions be prepared to get completely lost.

This cookie was very good. I too am a purist so didn't add the chocolate or cherry filling. Will try that for my grandchildren though. I didn't have enough patience to wait an hour before baking. Reduced heat to 350 and baked for 7 1/2 minutes on a silpat. They didn't crack at all. They were suprisingly delicate and light. Not chewy, crumbly or crunchy. A nice change from the old standby.

My dough came out very dry, and only became workable after adding 2 extra yolks. Decent flavor, but I've had better.

I used raspberry jam instead of cherry, and made sandwiches with both fillings...easier to store, although that won't be a problem 'cause they have all but disappeared in a day!

The texture of these cookies is perfect. I made the chocolate topping and had so much left over I made another batch of cookies. I used a 1 1/2 tsp. scoop which made cookies a little under 2 inches around. I might make them a little smaller next time. Otherwise a good, basic, easy peanut butter cookie recipe.

Followed recipe exactly. Filled with chocolate, didn't try cherry filling. I've had better peanut butter cookies and I felt that the chocolate centers were just too sweet. A good chocolate chip cookie is less work and much more tasty in my opinion.

I have tried a few other peanut butter cookie recipies,and this one beats the others hands down. I substituted half organic whole wheat flour and used half becel margarine and half butter. I did not add any filling. I found that they were rich and tasty - the consistency of shortbread. One note - I would either reduce the temperature to 350 degrees or ensure the rack was on a higher level to avoid burning the bottoms. Fabulous!

My peanut butter and jelly jewels were fabulous. They did fall in the oven and turned out more like cookies though. I made swirls of chocolate on the top and they looked beautiful! I think I over-mixed the flour into the cookie dough making it too soft. Next time I will hold back with the mixing. There will be a next time soon...

These aren't as much work as the recipe makes them seem. Don't make the cookies too big or they will crack. I just filled them with plain jam after they came out of the oven and they were heavenly. The chocolate ones are great, too.

These are among the best pb cookies I've had. Mine cracked quite a bit because I used whole wheat flour and natural pb (I dislike the taste of the commercial stuff) but they were still marvellous. Next time I'll underbake them slightly to get a chewier, plain pb cookie.

This is a wonderful recipe for just plain peanut butter cookies too. I made them without the chocolate or jam (but with extra double-strength vanilla) for my mother who is a peanut butter cookie "purist", and she raved about them. I can't wait to make them again-- this time for me-- with the chocolate!

The jelly reduction is too much work. Use regular jelly and put in before baking, like regular thumbprints. I filled all with jelly then piped on top zig-zags of dark chocolate. Delicious.

If you love peanut butter and chocolate together this is a cookie you will love. When you bake them the depression you made will puff back up, I used the wooden end of a ladle (easier than a small wooden spoon end) to tamp down a circular depression, leaving a nice clean edge. Do this as soon as they come out of the oven because once they cool they harden up a bit. I did not find the cookies to be overly sandy as some PB cookies are, rather on the fine side and I did not use superfine or processed sugar. I used callebaut chocolate (milk and bittersweet) and the filling came out perfect,awesome actually. I used a star tip and pastry bag to pipe the chocolate on. I was generous with the filling so I had to make up another 1/2 batch of the filling, this only took a few minutes and was worth it. I will do this from the start next time. The chocolate filling firms up a bit and the beautiful appearance of the piped filling stood up to being layered between waxed paper for storage. I will also use this filling to top and sandwich my spritz cookies sometime, I loved it so much I could just eat the filling (ok, I did eat a little..bakers perk I say). One last thing, don't make the balls of dough too big, I switched to a 3/4 in. scoop and found this to be a more attractive size.

Crisp and light, these cookies are more delicate than most other peanut butter cookies. I had problems with the cherry reduction. It is important not to cook the syup more than 5 minutes as it will burn. My syrup never acheived the described consistancy and I had to toss it, thereby forcing me to cover my cherries with chocolate. A pleasant accident! The instructions for this chocolate option are not clear in terms of how much butter to use. I used a total of 5 ounces chocolate and 3 tbls. butter.

This is a more refined version of the old standby, and one of my favorites, "Peanut Butter Blossoms",(the cookies with candy kisses). I always find Rose Beranbaum's recipes a little peripatetic. The ingredients are measured to the gram, (I draw the line at weighing an egg, [laying one, as well]), but then she says, casually, why not try using half of the peanut butter? I'm still trying to decide which I like better, the cherry or the chocolate, the cherry is indeed prettier, but I think the chocolate will be reached for more quickly.
