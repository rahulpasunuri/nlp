I just wish I could figure out an interesting way to serve this. It is so good - tastes just like corn, which is a little weird for a dessert but oddly clever. However, just plopping a scoop or two in a bowl doesn't do it justice- or set the stage. People need to know what they are about to indulge in to totally appreciate the unexpected flavors.

This ice cream is heavenly. Yes, a tad labor intensive. Yes, uses a lot of egg yolks, but the flavor is rich and delicious. I might cut down a bit on the sugar as I thought it was definitely sweet ... but a rich sweet vs. just sugary sweet. Definitely worth making again .... and again.

This is awesome, one of my go-to ice creams. The corn adds an interesting subtle note to the sweet creaminess, and the texture is really nice. I've also made it with frozen yellow corn kernels, omitting the cobs, and it's still awesome.

Served this very special gelato to a dinner party and each of the eight people - some not dessert eaters - were thrilled. Seconds were requested all around the table. We followed the recipe exactly and it turned out smooth, creamy and not too sweet -- you almost feel like you're eating health food. We served it with a caramel sauce that has a bit of lemon juice in it - a terrific flavor combo. It's not particularly quick and easy to make, but worth every minute of prep.

This is amazing stuff. I couldn't stand the idea of wasting eight egg whites, so I made some meringue cookies (meringue, sugar dash of cinnamon and cocoa). Served the gelato on top of the cookies. Broke up the cookie and ate the gelato and cookie as a mixture. Tasted like Captain Crunch. My BF says Corn Pops. Soooo good.

I had corn ice cream in Mexico years ago and have been thinking about it ever since. "Strangely delicious" is a good way of putting it. I used corn picked yesterday morning, 1% milk (instead of whole milk)and cream and a bit less sugar and salt than the recipe called for--still very rich and yummy. I am still undecided about the salt (more or less, or just right). A small amount of this stuff is very satisfying so that sets off the fact that it has to be really fattening!

This seemed more like a custardy ice cream than a gelato. It was a little labor intensive but worth the time and effort. The flavor reminds me of the slightly-undercooked corncake side dish that's often served with Mexican food. It's sweet, but the sweet taste isn't sugary; it just tastes like sweet corn. I used three medium-sized ears of white corn and did not need any extra whole milk. This is a very straight-forward recipe and turned out perfectly for me. Strangely delicious! If you're at all curious about this recipe, try it - you won't be disappointed.
