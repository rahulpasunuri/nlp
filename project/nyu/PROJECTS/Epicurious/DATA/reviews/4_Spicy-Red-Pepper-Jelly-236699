Fantastic! I've made this a couple of times now because it doesn't last long. Wonderful with cream cheese, I need to try it with some chèvre also. No problems getting it set. I've added jalapeños for an extra kick too.

Let's see, how can I sum this recipe up?.... AMAZING!!! I've made two batches so far and both turned out perfect. Instead of using just red peppers, I did a mix of Red, Yellow, Orange and Green, and even threw in some jalapenos. The taste was amazing, and the different colored pepper pieces were so pretty! I like to spread out a block of cream cheese on a platter, then spread the jelly over top. We made the jelly as wedding shower favors and everyone loved it! I'm going to make more for christmas gifts, and next year I'm adding peppers to my garden!!

I made 3 batches of this pepper jelly for the holiday season. Everyone LOVED it! I made it exactly to recipe and it came out perfectly. I followed the chef's notes and made separate batches for each instead of tripling the recipe. It was a little more time consuming than I wanted it to be, and my house felt like a sauna after all that boiling, but I'm sure it yielded the best possible results. This was also my first time sealing jars or making jelly, and I found it super easy, so don't be intimidated!

This jelly is ridiculously good! Made 84 4oz jars for a friends wedding as a favor, everyone loved it! This recipe makes exactly 5 8oz pint jars for me.

I've made this recipe twice now and neiher one has set up. I will continue to try because the taste of the (in my case) sauce is outstanding. Really don't understand what the problem is, I followed everything to the letter.

I absolutely love this jelly and must say don't be shy if you've never made anything like this before. It was my first time and everything came out beautifully. The second time I made it I didn't have enough red peppers and wanted a little extra kick, so used one small green pepper and 3 red jalapenos in lieu of 1 red and it is beautiful. I also just chopped them all up instead of using a food processor. And I don't can them, just refrigerate them and they last for months. You just can't go wrong. My family is now requesting me to bring this every Christmas with a hunk of brie. Heavenly.

Absolutely wonderful, and surprisingly simple. My first time canning anything and due to the small batch I was able to do this easily with materials available in my kitchen.

excellent! Made it as stated although I add an extra teaspoon (or two) of the pepper flakes for some power! Ever since I made it in dec 06... I get requests all year around to make it over and over again. Great homemade gift.

I would strain this before adding the pectin next time. There is probably a half jar of waste if you don't

This is amazing and in season will cost pennies a jar. Made exactly as stated.

I love spicy red-pepper jelly and have had troubles finding it to buy in the past. This was my first time making it and it turned out so well. My 3 year old daughter and I have made 2 batches already and she loves it as well. I found I did need to use more peppers then 3 to make 6 cups but maybe my peppers were smaller then normal.

So happy I tried this recipe! I was looking to make something similiar to the $6 a jar pepper jelly at Wholefoods. I like this better. It made 4+ jars. I'll definately be making another batch.

This is wonderful! Perfect amount of spice and sets up beautifully. I don't bother canning it unless I'm giving it as gifts. Just keep it in the fridge or freezer. I'm a caterer and I often serve this on homemade melbas with triple creme cheese or with crab cakes for parties--everyone loves it.

I used champagne vinegar becuase it was what I had on hand and tossed in two jalapenos with the bell peppers. I thought it turned out fantastic. I also got exactly four 8 oz jars.

Tasted one of my partial jars -- amazingly good! But the Sure-Jell pack warns that it may take 1-2 wks for the pectin to set. Don't know if I can wait that long to see if the recipe turns out correctly. Plan to hit the farmers' market again tomorrow for more red peppers. Christmas gifts!

I gave jars of these away for Christmas presents... have had two of the recipients offer to pay me to make more for them!

This is excellent with brie, and also with salmon cakes. The recipe only yielded four 8 oz. jars when I prepared it.
