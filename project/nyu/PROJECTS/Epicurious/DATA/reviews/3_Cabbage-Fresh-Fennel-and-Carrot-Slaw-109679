Ok. No-one really wanted to eat this so I think I ate most of it. I halved the recipe and used less mayo and substituted labneh for the sour cream. The fennel does add interest. It's definitely not the best coleslaw I've tasted (I have a recipe with apples, raisins and caraway that I prefer) but it's an easy recipe to use up that extra cabbage. It's convenient because it uses ingredients that can last a while in the fridge (although fennel does go brown on the outside).

This was delicious. I added julienned red and yellow peppers, so it was beautiful also. I didn't have lemon juice so I used white wine vinegar. I really missed the fresh flavor the lemon juice would have given. Will make sure I have lemons the next time I make this salad, which will be soon.

Wonderful "fresh" taste from the fennel. I wasn't sure if we'd like this since I've never used fennel in anything before. Great combination of flavors. We had this with burgers, which was good - but it would be fabulous with pulled pork barbeque.

"Will not make again"???? Apparently, Hollywood, CA, is, shall we say, "high". This is one of the best coleslaw recipes ever. I used more carrot, definitely more hot sauce. The fennel, I feel, makes the dish; however, fennel...well, not everyone likes it. So, if you don't -- use celery. It add's the same texture without the taste. This coleslaw should be served alongside BBQ ribs, chicken, whatever. Maybe with some corn on the cob with chipotle-butter???

This has become a family favorite! We use less onion and mayo, a little more hot sauce, and substitute soy sour cream or soy cream cheese.

One the best cole slaws I've ever tasted! Didn't have time to get the fennel...just fine with out it. The mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon, and hot sauce combination was outstanding!

A quick coleslaw to throw together. I had both green and red cabbage leftovers, so I used that. I also halved the recipe. The only thing I would do different is soak the onions in some water for about 15 minutes to tone down their flavour.
