I use this recipe whenever I make slaw. It surprises those who dont like cabbage slaw. I use the whole apple, so I double all of the ingredients. Put it on sandwiches, pulled pork, all sorts of burgers, and as a side dish. Delish!

We make bison burgers a lot and really enjoyed the addition of the mushroom. I sauteed the porabello with shallots in some ghee in our cast iron pan. I made my own mayo, added a dash of apple cider vinegar and a tsp of horseradish mustard (because that's what we had). I added some salt but omitted the sugar since we try to avoid it and I really think it would have been unnecessary, maybe even unpleasant with the sweetness of the apple there already. Also used cuke instead of celery, again just because that's what we had, and it was very refreshing but I'm sure added a little more moisture than was desirable. I think you could play around so much with the slaw, with red bell pepper, or any number of other crunchy veggie with the apple and it would be great. Will make this again and again.

Don't take the three-fork review for a sign of disapproval. This was really, really good--heck, I guess I SHOULD have given it four forks. Moist and flavorful, with a nice contrast from the slaw.

Excellent. Didn't change anything. Left over slaw good with extra greens as a salad.

Used ground beef and white mushrooms, and ended up with a truly succulent burger. When tasting the mushroom/onion saute prior to adding the beef, I almost spooned up the entire thing it was so good. With that as a precursor to the meal, I was hesitatnt to add the slaw. However, it was a perfect compliment of a light and cool crunch. Absolutely delicious.

I have a question....how do you cut celery lengthwise on a mandolin?

I made these burgers last 4th of July, just to keep up with the spirit of barbecuing (as I'm not the biggest fan of burgers) - and my family and friends loved them!! I added caramelized onions - the apple slaw is amazing!!

I thought this was pretty good but my husband and friend thought it was in the top three burgers they have eaten in the world. Next time, I will add more black pepper. I also made the 1000 island dressing for another recipe and my husband dipped his in there which he said made it even better.

These burgers were extremely easy to make and were very delicious. I grilled the burgers instead of cooking them on the stove but had to place them on foil otherwise they probably would have fallen apart. The apple slaw was amazing! It gave the the otherwise heavy yet flavorful burger a light and refreshing taste and was an excellent compliment. I made this recipe for some of my friends who were hesitant about eating buffalo but it tasted no different than beef but was a little more flavorful and juicy. Great recipe! Definitely give it a try!!

Wonderful recipe but I think I overdid on the onion/mushroom to bison ratio because they fell apart. Next time I'll be sure to drain the bison well before mixing and mix up in portions. I put the burgers on the grill and 3 of the four made it without crumbling apart. The slaw was simple perfection. Yum Yum.

I was surprised how much flavor these burgers have! Delish! Can't wait to make these again!

I have never made buffalo (bison?) burgers before, but these are pretty good: moist and tasty. Like another reviewer, I toasted the buns. I thought the slaw was going to be weird, but it was SO good, my family has requested it as a separate side. (I doubled the slaw recipe to have some to serve on the side. Also who wants to have half an apple left over?? Hurrah for my julienne mandoline!)

Absolutely delicious, although we did set off the fire alarms in my complex while cooking in the skillet! :) I would recommend throwing open a couple windows and then tucking in to enjoy a great and healthy twist on a regular burger. I was a little hesistant about the slaw, but it turned out to add such a great and interesting crunch to the burger. Give it a shot for sure!

There's plenty of good burger recipes available but only this one and the Bean and Bello Burger rate 4 forks in my estimation. Yes, lean ground beef also works - I've tried both - but the buffalo meat flavour really makes this burger distinct.

i teach my student life skills at the school i work which involves us cooking lunch for ourselves once a week. this recipe was our favorite by far, and we have been cooking for about a year and a half. we lessened the amount of mushrooms b/c of cost. delicious and easy!!

Wow, this is going in my recipe box for sure. I think this is the best tasting ground buffalo recipe I've ever tried. Really moist and tasty burgers and the slaw was awesome.

This would be a great recipe to make ahead of time - you could make up the patties and keep them in the freezer. I suppose you could also make the slaw ahead of time, too - but it's so easy I don't see the point. I'm a sommelier and until the good people at snooth come up with something - I paired this with a peppery Chianti and thought it worked out great.

To "A cook in Mississippi", stone ground mustard comes in a jar and it's available in pretty much every grocery store..small jar,prepared mustard usually on the top shelf of the mustard section...it looks like a very grainy mustard, not smooth like the rest of them..i can get it here in NC at food lion...you can probably substitute reg. mustard, but you should be able to find it...

Could anyone tell me exactly what whole-grain mustard it? I assume it is a bottled spice powder similar to "mustard". I have never seen the whole-grain here in the South. Is there much difference in the taste? Thanks.

I haven't tried these yet but often look at the reviews before I decide and just wanted to say to A cook from Spring, Texas - you have a good sense of humour

This was delicious. I have been using bison (the correct term) for a couple of years and much prefer it to beef. We also feel it has a better taste, and the knowledge it's grass fed not feed lot fed is important to us. I toasted the buns briefly under the broiler after brushing them with olive oil to keep them from getting soggy.

I used an extremely lean ground beef -- 98% lean, 2% fat, rather than buffalo, which is a pretty fair substitute, I feel. I made it into sliders, since I only had tiny slider buns from trader joe's. It was absolutely delicious, a great way to have moist yet healthier burgers. This was also an extremely cheap entree, yet tasted really fancy and gourmet, so great for company.

We made these this week for dinner and we were pleasantly surprised, even my skeptical hamburger-purist bf liked them. We don't really have access to buffalo here, but ground beef worked just fine. I would be careful about the buns you pick, though, we used your typical hamburger buns and they sort of spoiled the flavor and moistness (soaked up all the juices) of the burgers. With a better bun, this recipe could be a solid 4 forks.
