I made this recipe just as it's presented, and I thought it was terrific.

Great pie. My local grocery store was out of Golden Delicious apples, so I used Granny Smith. Tart, but still delicious. I added some cinnamon and nutmeg, and only baked the pie for 45 minutes total - it would have been burned to a crisp had I left it in the oven for the full recommended cooking time!

We loved this recipe. I did change a few things. To cut down on time I put the apples in the microwave for 5 mins. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. My husband said it was a Blue Ribbon pie!

I pick this recipe because I had some golden raisins, and when I started making it couldn't find the blinkety blank things. So I guess I didn't really make as directed. I subbed craisins and walnuts. My apples were mushy, so I'd probably either not pre-cook them or cut the time down. The crust was pretty good, though, and the pie held together, which is a first for me. I'd make it again to try it with the raisins, as intended.

When I suggested this to my wife, she thought it would be "interesting." She wasn't a fan of golden raisins. But this changed her mind. I prepared it and ate it later that evening at a get together with our friends. The lattice top turned out nice and golden and the crust got rave reviews from my wife. All the friends liked the raisin/apple combination. I ended up rewriting the recipe on my own to better use my time. There is a lot of preparation that goes into this recipe. I also made the crust my "hand" instead of using a processor. Less clean up and it is kind of fun to squish the dough into shape. Finally, I think the longer you can let this bake, the better, as long as it does not burn the crust. The softer the apple the better it accents the crispiness of the crust.
