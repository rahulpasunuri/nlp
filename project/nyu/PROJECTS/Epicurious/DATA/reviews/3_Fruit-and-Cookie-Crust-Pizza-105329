I made this with a scratch sugar cookie dough instead of the store-bought for a bunch of kids and they wouldn't touch it. It was "eh" at best.

The marshmallow cream and caramel sauce are overkill. I'll make it again but with just a regular cream cheese frosting (no marshmallow). I'll skip the caramel sauce and just drizzle with sweetened lemon juice to keep the fruit looking fresh.

Super tasty! I made this with condensed milk (instead of marshmallow cream) because that was what I had at the house. I also mixed crushed pineapples in with the cream cheese spread and used whipped cream cheese instead of the traditional. For fruit selection, I used strawberries, tart peaches, kiwis, and bananas and drizzled an warm apricot/pineapple preserve on top. My picky mother loved it!

I don't know how anyone can claim in 2001 that they have an "entirely new dish" when my mom was making this back in '85 - I think she got the recipe from one of those Pilsbury cookbooks, but who am I to judge. Skip the caramel sauce and add a warmed up glaze of orange marlemade to balance out the sweatness. I like to make mine in a jelly roll pan and use strawberries and blueberries for the 4th of July and make a Flag.

Sugar cookie crust is practically good all by itself but when all of the ingredients are added it's pretty good. I could have done without the pineapple and the bananas, but they are nice for color and for taste. It's important to get sweet fruit or ripe fruit unless you like the tangyness or bitterness of unripe fruit. And the caramel isn't necessary.

I use the sugar cookie dough but instead of the marshmallow cream use 1 cup of white chocolate chips for the 'sauce'. The glaze is orange juice thickened with cornstarch and you have a hit!

I've been making fruit pizza since I was little, but my grandmother and I always used sweetened condensed milk instead of the marshmallow creme. It turns out wonderful!

I was a little concerned about the "frosting" calling for marshmellow creme, but it definitely adds the sugar needed to balance the cream cheese. This is very easy to make and sure to be a hit at any gathering!

we substituted cool whip for the marshmallow creme and put a little confectioners sugar. Then made a simple syrup with a touch of lemon juice. But we like it both ways

I have always made this with melted orange or appricot jelly in place of the caramel. The jelly glazes keeps the fruit (especially bananas) from looking yucky

This was perfect for my husband's birthday party when last minute I realized I had forgotten to prepare a dessert. I put strawberries, raspberries and blueberries on top. Be careful when you are cooling the cookie. It turned out surprisingly beautiful.

I have a similair recipe from my aunt that has pleased many at our family reunions. Our version has an orange juice - lemon zest sauce that is poured over the top and chilled, allowing the fruit to gel into place. Mmm....

This is a good recipe--be sure to use a name brand dough (there is a big differnce between it and store brand--less so for choc chip dough). If you like this, you should pick up a cookbook my daughter just got for me called COOKIE DOUGH DELIGHTS--the whole book is recipes made with choc chip & sugar dough (store bought) that you "doctor". Made a wonderful nectarine tart, blueberry crumble bars, and double-ginger choc chip cookies--all were great.

It was a hit at my kids' high school band awards banquet...wasn't a crumb left. My only complaint was that the caramel turned white and runny...but it was still delicious.

This recipe gets a 2, but my variation gets a four! I put canned mandarin orange slices, pineapple, marschino cherries and kiwi on the pizza. Also, I leave out the marshmallow cream and drizzle an orange marmalade glaze over it all. (Orange marmalade jelly with a little bit of water). MMMMMM!

THE BEST DESSERT PIZZA BEGINS WITH PILLSBURY CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE DOUGH 9 THE KIDS ABSOLUTELY LOVE THOSE) THEN YOU DROP THEM ON A PIZZA PANS IN MOUNDS AND THEY MELT INTO EACH OTHER WHILE BAKING ( MIGHT NOT BE PERFECTLY ROUND BUT YOU TRIM IT) THEN YOU BAKE UNTIL DOUGH IS GOLDEN BUT NOT ALL THE WAY DONE THEN YOU LET "CRUST" COOL COMPLETELY AFTER "CRUST" HAS COOLED SPREAD PIZZA WITH WHIPPED CREAM THEN ARRANGE YOUR FRUIT ATTRACTIVELY AROUND THE ENDS OF THE CRUST IN ATTRACTIVE CIRCLES MAKING YOUR WAY TO THE MIDDLE (STRAWBERRIES KIWIS PEACHES) ARE BEST. THEN ENJOY IT IS A WONDERFUL DESSERT FOR KIDS AND ADULTS ALIKE. SIMPLE AND NOT AS HEAVY (OR SWEET) AS THIS RECIPE THIS RECIPE IS DEFINETLY SICKLY SWEET AND AND ITS TOO CRUMBLY.

This was definitely so-so. The crust cracked after baking, and I had a make-your-own-pizza bar, so people could put on the fruits they liked. Instead of caramel sauce, I gave guests a choice of chocolate frosting (as well as the marshmallow fluff.) There are many things I would make again before making this though.

Got a variation of this recipe from my sister in Colorado and made it last night. An easier way to handle the cookie dough is to slice it into 1/4 inch rounds and just place them onto the pizza pan. No need to roll it out, as the circles fill in while baking. I underbaked it a bit, then let completely cool before spreading it with cream cheese. Although I just used regular softened cream cheese, the consensus was that it would be better sweetened, so next time will try it with the added sugar and possibly vanilla. For the glaze, I heated apple jelly and brushed it onto the fruit. Used sliced kiwi, strawberries, raspberries and blueberries. A huge hit!

I love this recipe! And I am so proud that I was able to make something so simple yet sooo yummy. Instead of cutting the dough and forming it with my fingers, I just rolled it out with my rolling pin right on the baking stone I used to bake it on (I used flour to keep it from sticking) Very simple and easy. A winner for sure!

Very tasty, a little messy once cut, but still worth it!

I can't believe this recipe has shown up here. My mother-in-law has made a take on this for years. We use sugar cookie dough, cream cheese, vanilla and sugar for the filling, favorite fruits and top with a glaze of melted preserves, apricot or peach. Very pretty, very delicious and never any left overs.

Very good and easy to make. The most time consuming portion of the recipe was preparing and assembling the fruit. However, the end result was worth it. I think that it would be more fun if assembling the fruit is a group project. For fruit, I used strawberries, kiwi, blueberries, and bananas. All worked great. My husband rates this recipe as a "2", but thinks that he would like it better if there were more fruit - even if it is more of the same fruit (i.e., more quantity). We'll try that next time....

I made this for the first time yesterday and instead of cookie crust, I happened to have a pate brisee 10" baked pie crust in my freezer. I used that instead. I did not use the caramel sauce because right now (August) soft fruits are at their peak and caramel sauce seemed like overkill. It got rave reviews, in particular because the crust was light, thin and flaky, and not too sweet.

I used fat free cream cheese and fat free marshmallow cream, and since I didn't have the appropriate pizza pan I just rolled the sugar cookie dough out in a rectangular jelly roll pan. Though the creme topping was a little runny (I'm sure that had I used the real stuff the texture would have been perfect), this dessert was a real treat. My husband, who tends to be a tad scared of the kitchen, loved helping me make this dish and especially loved helping me eat it! Definitely a keeper -- one of those desserts you can make on a moment's notice and still wow everyone.

Pretty easy to put together. Preparing the fruit took the most time. I rolled the cookie dough on a pastry cloth instead of cutting into slices, then finished the fit with my fingers. First attempt the dough was slightly raw in the center so the 2nd try I baked it on a pizza pan with tiny holes all over. Cookie was cooked from edges to center this time. On the 2nd attempt I also used only about 2/3 of the marshmallow cream because I was looking for a firmer cream base. Both times I omitted the caramel sauce on top. Felt no one needed the extra sugar and it wasn't missed. It was recieved well for both events. The fruit was a light and refreshing taste after a full dinner. Now a family favorite for years to come.
