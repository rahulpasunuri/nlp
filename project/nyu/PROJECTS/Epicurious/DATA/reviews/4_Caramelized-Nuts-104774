Thanks mmccolum van! Your mods were exactly what I was looking for this christmas.I did what you did for a lb. of pecans and I am suddenly the sensational cook. So amazing!

This is a great recipe. Easy, and yields great results. I made a few mods. I wanted spicy nuts, so I added a little less than 1/4 teaspoon cayenne, and also added more than the called for 2.5 lbs. of nuts, as there was plenty of coating to cover more than that. I didn't use tin foil, but just sprayed the baking sheet heavily with olive oil spray. Worked great. Nuts were easy to separate. Also baked for 20 minutes, as pulling them at ten, the coating wasn't quite there yet. Sprinkling the nuts lightly with sea salt after they cool really improves the flavor and gives them that salty/sweet combo that everyone loves. Great recipe. Easy, easy, easy. Love it!

This is such a simple recipe and yields a great crunchy sweet taste of roasted nuts. I had better luck not using foil, the second time. I spread in a glass baking tray, sprayed with oil. Then I let them cool on a piece of oiled parchment paper -- waxed paper would work too. While still warm I tossed in a few dried cranberries, and look forward to giving these as winter hostess gift.

I attempted to make a "sweet and spicy" version of these nuts by adding cayenne, black pepper, some mesquite and some chili powder to the syrup before coating the nuts..... unfortunately my grand plan wound up being a bit more of an "oops". Wonderfully easy recipe, wish I had followed the directions!

This is delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I added a sprinkle of salt and I poured the extra syrup over the nuts instead of leaving it in the pan. It made a lovely brittle effect -- very beautiful, and easy to break apart into little nut clusters.

I made only 1/2 cup caramelized pecans to go with a salad of mango, hearts of palm, greens and a citrus dressing. I reduced the sugar, water and honey by half and used butter for greasing. This was a lot easier than caramelizing on the stove-top. It's so easy to go from perfect to grossly burnt over a flame so I really liked how much easier it was to do it mostly in the oven.

An excellent and easy to prepare recipe without muss or fuss. Use a vegetable spray and cool on sprayed cookie sheet with no need for foil. A hit a my catered events.

I have simplified this recipe, and just use pecans. It is an excellent recipe, and the nuts compliment a spinach salad nicely.

I made these for a get together...everyone loved them! They were VERY easy to make and kept well. I added an extra sprinkle of sugar after roasting the nuts and before they cooled. I will make this again.
