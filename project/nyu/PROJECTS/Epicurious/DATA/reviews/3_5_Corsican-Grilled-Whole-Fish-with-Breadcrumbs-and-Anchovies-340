I don't understand your review, Bermuda. This recipe essentially is the stuffing. Without the stuffing, you'd have fish draped in oil -- you don't find oil to be memorable? For the rest of you, this is a good dish. Not great. Stuffing has some strange Thanksgiving qualities about it but will work with different fish (we used lake trout).

This is delicious. I made the following changes: I did not use rosemary or thyme. I added sun- dried tomatoes that had been soaked in oil. I did not sautee the onions - just adds time and is not necessary. Instead of breadcrumbs I used crushed crackers that had some hot peppers in them. They're 'high-quality' gourmet type crackers - any flavour is suitable, cracked pepper, hot peppers, rosemary etc. Have made this three times.

Excellent! Don't listen to mr. bland below; I made this with Branzino yesterday at a barbecue, and it was an instant hit (even competing with some amazing venison sausage and a Chateaubriand)! I made the fishcakes tonight, and they're scrumptuous (I used a 50:50 corn meal : flower coating, and substituted plain yogurt with lime juice and chipotles for the sauce). Buono Appetito!

This was good if you like bland. I made it with a very fresh Benita fish. Without the stuffing it would be utterly forgettable. Try the whole fish baked in salt; it's amazing.

I used a whole 7 pound red snapper and doubled the stuffing and crumb topping. Grilled it for about 25 minutes. It was spectacular. With the leftovers, I made fish cakes. Simply mix the leftover stuffing, pieces of fish, an egg, and one chopped jalepeno pepper. Pack firmly into 3" cakes. Dredge cakes in flour and saute in olive oil. I served it with basil oil and a chipolte/sour cream sauce. A huge hit both nights.

My only regret was that I didn't make more of the delicious stuffing. I made this with striped bass (rockfish) and roasted it in the oven (400 degrees for 25 minutes). Fantastic!!!

This was a delicious recipe. My son caught a 4 lb. stripped bass(we call it rockfish here in Maryland) and we grilled it as soon as he brought it home. The stuffing was a surprise as the anchovy taste was mild and not overpowering, but very tasty and delicious. As a matter of fact I would suggest making more stuffing, maybe 1 1/2 or 2 times the recipe. I used all fresh herbs from my garden for the dressing which I think added to the good flavor. I might also suggest adding one clove of chopped garlic and will try that the next time.

Very tasty! I used dried thyme and rosemary.
