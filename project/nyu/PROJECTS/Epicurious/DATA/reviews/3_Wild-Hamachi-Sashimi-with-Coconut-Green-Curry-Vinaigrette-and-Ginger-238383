Great recipe with full but light flavors. A little too much sauce for the amount of fish, but the sauce save well.

I liked this sauce, light and fresh. A little time consuming but tasty. I like that you can make it a bit in advance, so you can keep it for company. Very light curry taste. I made it in Jan, bad idea, this is most definitely a summer recipe.
