I used the idea - and it was wonderful. I had a shallot and used light cream cheese - and Panko crumbs instead of bread. It turned out as a wow.

It's always terrific to discover a new way to present fresh Spring asparagus in a different fashion; this gratin was a huge hit with our guests for yesterday's Easter feast. B.J. Harrick

Tasty and easy-used wheat bread instead of white-who eats white bread anymore? Found that the shallots were over powering-1/2 cup? That was like 4 shallots..baked instead of broiled-still good and did ahead of time which is key for a dinner party

I served this with Easter lamb (for the second year in a row) and everyone loved it. Last year, I cooked the shallots over not-so-high heat until it seemed to me that they they were done. I also used 2/3 of a cup panko crumbs instead of bread (rather a lot of panko, but I love buttery crumb toppings). This year, though, I did make two other changes: I doubled the amount of mascarpone and increased the pine nuts to 1/3 of a cup. I thought that these changes made the dish even better. Next year, I will follow the advice of others who put the gratin in the oven to heat through and brown; my broiler did a number on the topping and it was burned in spots.

I used panko bread crumbs instead of bread pieces and it turned out great. Quick and delicious.

I've made this twice now. The first time I followed the directions. That's what I based my rating on. It's divine! Then yesterday, for Easter, I was cooking for 16 people, and thought to save last-minute time and hassle, I would make the gratin the day before, keeping the crumb topping separate until ready to cook. This meant I had to reheat the gratin in the oven before browning the crumb topping under the broiler. Well, folks, I found out there's a reason the instructions are written the way they are! Upon reheating the casserole, the mascarpone/parmigiano sauce separated and turned oily. I served it anyway, and it tasted good and got raves, but obviously it wasn't as good as it should have been. Oh well, lesson learned.

This was pretty good. In the future I will use more shallots and less parmigiano-reggiano.

Even my kids (who dislike asparagus) liked this. I substituted equal amounts of sour cream and cream cheese for the mascarpone cheese. Tasted yummy!

Delicious. A crowd favorite. Last time I made it, I added white asparagus. I also leave them as whole stems instead of cutting them into 1 and 1/2 inch pieces. i layer it in a 9x13 pan. It looks nice and everyone raves about it.

This recipe was perfect as written. I followed a suggestion from klloch and toasted my pine nuts, but found that to be completely unnecessary, and was afraid they would burn. Next time, I will follow exactly. I brought this to a friend's dinner party and it was a huge hit. This is a great dish for vegetarians and carnivores alike! Permanent staple in my file.

I made this recipe for Easter and served it with an herb crusted rack of lamb. It was a big hit. Everyone devoured it. Even those who said they do not like asparagus. I made the recipe as written except for one substitution. I used ricotta cheese as a replacement for the mascarpone. It worked out beautifully. I would make this dish any time. Easy to prepare. However, you really do need to watch it in the broiler as the topping can begin to burn quickly.

This was one of those wonderful recipes where I could just wing it. I started out with a little less then 1# of asparagus. Baked it at 350 for about 5-8 mins tops and used sourdough bread cut into small cubes for the topping. Might toast the pine nuts the next time prior to adding.

My new favorite vegetable dish. I used dallops of triple cream brie instead of marshcapone and it was awesome!

My goodness, a few folks got semi- hysterical about this recipe's supposed shortcomings. My husband and I loved it! Didn't burn the shallots because I didn't slavishing follow directions for something as simple as sauteing. Otherside made as written just because I happened to have everything on hand. Proportions seemed good. Used a ciabatta bread because that's all I had, and I thought the little cubes were a fun change from crumbs. Slightly undercooked asparagus on purpose. Next time I'll put it in a hot oven so the whole casserole heats back up while the top turns golden. I love asparagus and usually eat it simply roasted . Had never thought it was so sacred it couldn't occasionally be gussied up a little!

Made this dish as an Easter side, it was delicious. I used sourdough bread and a full cup of Mascarpone. What a treat!

I am always looking for recipes that I can assemble early in the day which then allows me to spend time with my guests. This is exactly what I was able to do with this one. I did everything but broil it during the day. I actually baked it instead of broiling (as recipe states) because I had assembled it during the day which required that I then heat it through. This is one of those recipes that is so simple to make that you just can't imagine that it would be as good as it is! I made it for a dinner party last night and it was a huge success. I, like other reviewers, did not cook the shallots as long as was recommended.

I made this as part of my thanksgiving feast and all of my family really enjoyed it. My recipe copy went to my sister in law (who doesn't really cook and was not intimated by the dish to try and make it for herself). It really deserves 3 1/2 forks.

About the only way I have really enjoyed asparagus is roasted/grilled-simple but good. We found this recipe this past spring and have several friends and family members trying it and loving it as well. My assignment for the family Thanksgiving table at my in-laws is a green vegetable. This is definitely going to be it!!

I made this dish for my June Gourmet group. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. As others have said, do be careful when broiling it. Since it only broils for a couple of minutes I would definitely "keep an eye" on it while broiling. Enjoy!

Great side dish. I subbed a few ingredients that I didn't have on hand. I used green onions for the shallots, used bread crumbs (freshly made), and a mixture of cream cheese, ricotta, and sour cream for the mascarpone. Very good!

Delicious. I agree with only blanching or lightly cooking asparagus first and topping does burn. Will try baking and crumbs instead of croutons.

Excellent dish. I followed the receipe as written and thought it was very good. It was worth the extra calories!

Scrumptious concept - terrible formula. Proportions and temperatures are set for a burned, dry outcome. NEW COOKS: Read all advice on this board before attempting. It's worth it - truly a fabulous dish, but don't follow the recipe to a T. Cut back on the bread (I used 1/3 cup bread crumbs and it was too dry for my taste), use crumbs, crushed chips or crackers for best results. Blanche the asparagus, don't fully cook first as the baking (don't broil it!) later does the job. Use water, stock, cooking wine or milk/cream (for experienced cooks) to thin the cheese sauce and improve consistency. Love the flavors and will make again my own way, but too many pitfalls for the inexperienced - you'd get better results and easier time by just melting the cheese in the micro, stirring in flavors and pouring over cooked asparagus.

I made this dish exactly as written. I used a great, chewy artisan bread. It's very rich and flavorful. My boyfriend loved it. We both like asparagus just steamed, but I'd say this is a great way to serve it if you want to impress or for a special occasion, as it is so rich. Very nice alongside chicken.

To the person who spent $16.00 on Saffron, maybe your recipe didn't come out the way it should have, because you didn't quite read the recipe. I can find nowhere in this recipe where it calls for Saffron. Try reading the recipe through the next time.

This recipe is fantastic...will make again and again. Why can't one enjoy fresh asparagus AND this recipe...sounds like cook from Canada is unhappy with life in general. Try smiling AND this recipe, it will make you feel better.

Very yummy. I made and assembled it all ahead. Then I put it in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes to reheat and brown the top. I did not broil it. I used more pine nuts and parmesan in the recipe than called for because I love that nutty, cheesy taste. My husband went back for second which is unheard of with a veggie dish. And to that reviewer who was saying you didn't need to do this to fresh asparagus-- I am open minded enough to like asparagus both plain AND fancy.

My husband loved this recipe and so did my guests. It was simple and elegant. I don't know why the one reader spent $16 on saffron, there is no saffron in this recipe. I did have to cut the broiler time because my broiler is not adjustable. Hubby says, "this is a keeper, make sure you don't lose it." It is now in my permanent recipe file.

Why do all of this to lovely, fresh, in season asparagus? I think some Epicurious reviewers are really only "wana be" cooks who think the more you do to an ingredient the better cook you must be, just NOT true folks! You don't have to make this to know it is just plain silly.

I thought this receipe was more trouble and expense then it was worth. I was embarrassed to serve it on my easter table. I did not have a nice creamy consistancy, had very little flavor even after spending $16.00 just for the saffron.

I tried this recipe for Easter dinner, along with a roast leg of lamb. It was a big hit! I modified the cooking time for the shallots as suggested by others, and used panko crumbs (Japanese breadcrumbs) which produced a light, buttery topping. I would definitely make this again. I would be interested in how others have made this dish ahead of time. It can't stay in the oven long enough to reheat the asparagus without burning the topping.

Excellent! Flavorful and pretty. I only cooked my aspargus for @ 1 1/2 minutes, as I like my veggies a bit crunchy. I will try this recipe with goat cheese in the future as another reviewer did....That sounds good!

Awesome side dish!! I used fresh white bread but instead of cubing it made crumbs...Nicer presentation and the crumbs absorbed more of the flavors.

oh my gosh. this was the most amazing dish! i've made it twice, once with goat cheese and then with the mascarpone - both smashing. it's got lots of different textures and flavors that all combine perfectly. i plan on making this again and again...

This dish was a hit at my Easter dinner. So easy to make, also. I used green onions since I couldn't find any shallots and used cracked wheat bread instead of white. It gave it a much more flavorful topping. I used the amount of mascarpone the recipe called for and didn't have a problem with dryness.

Rating: 1
I was really disappointed. I stopped the shallots etc. from burning by turning down the heat, a must. Still, the result was a pretty dry crust. And creamy? I doubled the mascarpone (not that cheap either) and it was barely detectable. The bottom of the pan collected a small pool of water. I should have dried the asparagus with paper towels. It would have been easier to saute the asparagus in shallots, butter and pine nuts. If I do it again, I shall try alouette or boursin cheese, and more of it.

A dish beyond compare and easily prepared in advance. I was able to hold it refridgerated for hours before warming and serving with no problems. Delicious and the picky 7 year old asked for more.

I made this dish during Passover and so replaced the bread with Matzah. I also used Ricotta instead of Mascarpone cheese because that's what we had around. Delicious! Everyone loved it (and I was the only one there keeping Passover so no one was excited about Matzah). Someone even wondered if the dish would be as good with bread.

This was the top rated new vegetable recipe by my guests of the vegetables for my 2006 dinner. Every year I add a new choice for my guests. Usually I make the dish b/4 presenting the new vegetable to my guests so I can rate it from practicality to taste and presentation. Time did not allow my usual experimentation so I went cold turkey. - The raves exceded anything I had presented in the past. My wife, a non asparagus lover absolutely loved it. The limited leftovers I had were fought for and dividied up at the door. A Keeper

Yowza! This was fabulous! I'm normally a fresh asparagus purist, either naked or with butter is perfection, but I'm so glad I tried this recipe. It was delicious, easy, and light.

Although tasty and a nice way to serve asparagus, this recipe was problematic in a few areas...tendency for the shallots to burn (as others have reported) due to an inappropriate cooking time/method and too much bread topping that gets overly hard and dried out. Next time I will use breadcrumbs instead of cubes as I didn't care for their appearance and texture. Otherwise, very flavourful and worthwhile making.

Rating: 4
Use the recipe description for the shallots instead of the cooking time. Ditto for the additions. With the shallots and crumbs cooked to a golden brown, the dish is wonderful. The mascarpone adds a hint of sweetness to accents the asparagus perfectly. If you feel daring, use a multi-grain bread instead of plain old white. The result is a richer, nuttier flavor,

the shallots inevitably burn.

I use to trust Gourmet, but this recipe makes no sense. It called for finely chopped shallots, which then are cooked 3 min at high heat; then 5 more minutes getting the croutons browned. There is no way the shallots aren't going to be burned to a crisp, even if you have the sense to turn down the heat. If you get the bread brown, the shallots will be burned, period. Only solution I can see is to cook them separately. I used Panko crumbs instead.

Don't be afraid to make this recipe. It is excellent. Served with the Skirt with Red Wine Sauce recipe and my grown daughter said if a five stars was the highest, this was a seven. Will definitely make again.

My husband frowns when I make asparagus. He loved this dish. I cut the ingredients in half and it turned out great! I steamed the asparagus in the microwave right before adding the cheese so the vegies were very hot and melted the cheese quickly.
