I love serving these biscuits for hors d'oeuvres but the recipe needs some revisions. I add two tablespoons of milk (I double the recipe) so that the dough will stick together enough so that I could make the roll. It was way too crumbly otherwise. After baking them I freeze them and just pull out what I need for a party, toasting them once they have thawed to crispen them up.

I have not tried this yet so I will not give it a rating... however - in response to the cook from Australia: in North America a pound of butter weighs 450 grams. A "stick" is a quarter of a pound, half of an 8-oz. cup (4 fl.oz.), or about 115 grams. Good luck with making recipes using Imperial measures!

I had no problem with the recipe. They turned out perfectly. Everyone at the party loved them, and they were especially good with a glass of white wine. The dough freezes well. It says you can make them for up to three days ahead--after a couple of days they were a little softer, so I popped the crackers back into the oven to "freshen up" and they were great. I would definitely make them again.

HELP to all you american cooks from an australian cook...when you say a stick of butter, does anyone know how many grams that is???? and i think that recipe would work much better with plain flour only

I was very disappointed in this recipe. It sounded so good, but my experience was awful. I made the dough a day ahead of baking the cracker. They looked so good in the oven,however, when I went to remove them from the baking sheet, all I ended up with was CRACKER CRUMBS, they just literally fell apart on me.. I froze the crumbs and I am going to use them to coat a lovely baked onion dish...If anyone makes these and gets them to turn out without falling apart please let me hear from you...I am with the others. PLEASE DO NOT GIVE A RECIEPE 4 FORKS WHEN YOU HAVEN'T EVEN MADE THE DISH...

Not enough zing for my liking. Some pepper, and maybe a little thme might improve the flavor. But, I didn't like the "mouth feel" either - all crumble and no crunch. I'm tossing this one.

Easy to make and great for roquefort lovers...served it with port at the end of the day.

How can two people rate a recipe three forks when they haven't tried it???? Must be a new concept!!

I haven't yet made this, but it looks excellent. I have made similar things, but the combination of roquefort and sesame seedsis new to me and sounds intriguing. I would have appreciated a suggestion for using plain flour and baking powder/soda, but i think I can manage.
