I have just made this 1 hour ago! the whole recipe is fantastic! Just 1 recommendation tho: include at least 1 tablespoon of course sea salt into the batter as well as sea salt is not salty but tasty! It's a total delish!!!

I have been making the Green Onion Buttermilk Biscuit from Nov 2000 for years. That recipes exceed this one by leaps and bounds. This recipe calls for an unnecessary amount of sugar (it really doesn't need any). Also, the cornmeal does little for the consistency. I would recommend sticking to an all flour biscuit, but steal this wonderful idea of topping the biscuit with salt and pepper. I used a smoked sea salt. Also, this did not bake well at Denver altitude (needs additional baking powder).

Have made this recipe a few times this summer and always to rave reviews. I've always been in a hurry and so had to muddle through a bit hastily, e.g., rather than rolling out the dough and cutting biscuits, I simply split it into 16 balls and then roughly hand-shaped biscuits from them. I also made my own self-rising flour with baking powder and salt. Regarding previous reviewers, I found that parchment paper was key to preventing the bottoms from burning and that very coarse, granular sea salt gave just the right touch of saltiness. These are generally quite good but absolutely divine fresh out of the oven. Made them with grilled rosemary chicken and people were grabbing seconds and thirds right away!

For once in my life, I made biscuits that actually rose properly. However, I felt that, while the green onions and pepper were a nice addition, the total lack of salt in the recipe made the biscuits taste oddly bland. The fact that salt was sprinkled on top did not really help, but in fact accentuated the fact that the biscuits themselves were rather flat. I also did not like the addition of the cornmeal, which surprised me. I did use whole grain, which might be the problem. Too gritty. Did anyone else feel that some salt in the biscuits themselves might help?

Can you make the dough ahead and freeze it?

Made as written and they were excellent. I am taking a break from grazing on them to write this. I can see how these would lend well to other herbs or flavourful cheeses in place of or augmenting the scallions. They are fluffy, golden deliciousness. Give them a shot.

When I made these, they came out quite dense and didn't fully cook in the center, though they were beginning to burn on the outside. But they still tasted good. I'm sure it was some mistake on my part. Perhaps because I didn't use the parchment or because I used salted butter instead of unsalted, I'm not sure. I used this recipe to help rid of some excess buttermilk and I will probably use it again only in a similar instance.

Very good! I threw in some chopped dill along with the green onions and they were delicious. My batch made way more than 14 biscuits, though. More like 20 with a 2 inch cutter. They are addictive when they first come out of the oven so have your softened butter ready!

These biscuits are amazeballs! I'm lactose intolerant so I used rice milk instead of the buttermilk. As another reviewer suggested, I made my own self-rising flour by adding 3 tsp baking powder to 2 cups of flour. They rose beautifully, even as drop biscuits. Delicious flavor- the green onions weren't too over-powering at all. I loved the texture too. I might try these with different herbs like rosemary or thyme, just to experiment.

Superb. The green onions are awesome with the buttermilk. I made my own self rising flour by adding 1.5 tsp baking powder for every 1 cup all-purpose flour. Worked very well.

Christinaglows, did you use the self-rising flour? If you used regular flour they will not rise.

I did not care for the green onions in them. Although they were okay, they were nothing spectacular. I've had better biscuits using Bisquick. If I made them again, I would leave out the green onions and maybe add another herb like rosemary, as suggested. As others have noted, my biscuits did not rise, but I didn't expect them to after reading the reviews. They were really more scone like than what I would consider a biscuit. As a savory scone, they'd probably be okay. But as a biscuit, they were pretty much a failure.

What went wrong?! I read the good reviews and thought this would be a great Thanksgiving day side but they were horrible - flat as a pancake and tasteless - even my dog hesitated before eating!!

So so delicious- do everyone a favor and pre-assemble the ingredients before you go to a party or have people to your house and quickly whisk everything together and bake them fresh so they come right out of the oven. I serve mine with this incredible butter from my local farmers' market. I also make them as drops- they look and taste delicious still. I also cut down on the sugar a bit.

Really great and had a good texture. You could reduce the sugar a bit, if you wanted. They were a bit sweet, but really delicious.

Loved this recipe! Followed the directions exactly and they came out perfectly... although, we forgot to sprinkle the second batch with salt and pepper and really missed that touch -- the first batch, with the salt and pepper, was much better. I served these with homemade miso soup.

I'm from the South, and I can say wholeheartedly: these are exquisite. I made them as drops rather than cookie-cuttering (saving mess and time) and they could not have been easier or more delicious.

These are the best biscuits I have ever tasted. Everyone loved them. The subtle crunchiness from the cornmeal, crispy outside, and delightfully tender inside make them irresistable. They're dangerous, I could eat way too many!

These were very easy when made in the food processor. I doubled the recipe and had no problem. They didn't puff up like I was expecting but they are delicious and I'm sure they'll be divine with the Easter ham. YUM.

I figured out quite by accident that these are the best crackers in the world if you use all purpose flour instead of self-rising flour. I used the all purpose by accident and rosemary instead of green onions. The result: the best, easiest crackers for cheese I have ever had. They were so good, I made some for all of my neighbors.

Made little 2-inch biscuits, still took 20 minutes at 425. Was out of corn meals, so substituted masa harina. Dense, as others noted, but very tasty and not tough. Thanks to previous reviewer, I used the food processor for whole thing - very quick/easy. Only change, aside from masa for cornmeal, added a small, finely diced jalapeno. Nice.

The biscuits were very good. I loved the combination of the green onions with the hint of sweetness from the sugar. My boyfriend and I made them for our New Year's Day dinner with Hoppin' John, Spinach, and Pork Tenderloin. I used a star shaped cookie cutter for the festivities. They would work quite well to soak up a soup or stew, particularly because they are dense.

This recipe doesn't double well. But made as a single batch, it's delicious (made my own self-rising flour: added 1.5t of baking powder per cup of flour).

I made these a few days before Thanksgiving as mini biscuits. They were delicious out of the oven, but they didn't freeze well. On Thanksgiving after thawing, they tasted a bit dense and stale. Tasty but not a good recipe to make ahead.

I made these for Thanksgiving and have multiple requests for the recipe now. They were delicious - I made some with the green onion and some without for the picky eaters - both were good, but the onion definitely makes them better. Did anyone have difficulty rolling these out? My dough was so sticky, I just made drop biscuits.

A great accompaniment to Thanksgiving. After a disaster with a dropped casserole I almost gave up hope that there'd be time to make these, but they came together in no time and were fantastic. Loved sea salt and cracked pepper on top. Made sage butter to spread on top.

Great taste and texture. Made as directed, except for baking time (less than indicated). Biscuits didn't achieve the height as pictured, but the taste really overcompensates. Great recipe.

Perfect for appetizer serving, too... just use a smaller cutter. This recipe has full flavor,visual appeal,and GREAT taste & texture. (Recipe was adjusted for not having self-rising flour on hand.) My husband's newest favorite.

Very good - the cornmeal gives them a great texture. Not as light and flaky as I like my biscuits to be. Excellent flavor - went well with Turkey and gravy as well as eggs. I made them on two occasions... 20 minutes is way to long too bake them, I would check them at about 15.

I followed the recipe exactly and found that the biscuits were flat, like many here have indicated. However, also like many here have indicated the flavor was/is delicious and everybody loved the flavor. I was hoping for an outcome more like the photo attached to this recipe even after reading the reviews, but like to stay true to the recipe as posted before I modify. I will try again, however, I will modify the recipe. I did not find these time consuming at all. One thing I will try is to roll the dough out twice as thick as the directions say. I think even with the self rising flour, they can use a bit of help in the height dept. They did cook faster than the directions said as well, even though my oven is pretty accurate.

I used a cookie punch in a leaf shape and they puffed up just right. I only baked 10-11 minutes, as the biscuit was smaller shaped. Great little crunch from the cornmeal and not too overpowering with the onion and light salting/pepper.

Fixed this for a group today. Everyone loved it. But allow more prep time than they say. And lo cal? Well, if you ate only one. But who would do that?

I could not find self-rising flour so I tried to add baking powder and salt to the flour, per directions I found online. Didn't really work out - as the biscuits did not rise at all and the result was a very dense scone-like biscuit. The flavor was good though!! I also refrigerated the dough for several hours while I was waiting for an oven (it was a busy Thanksgiving!), so that may also have made the difference. Will attempt again!

I must not have made these right because the other reviews are so good. I belive I followed the directions exactly. I thought they were too salty and the flavor was odd. Nobody at my Thanksgiving table even finished one so I will not be making these again.

These were very good @ Thanksgiving dinner! My husband ate 2----most unusual for a "non bread" person! Very tasty with the onions & I liked the added texture with the cornmeal. I would have preferred them to be sugarless, but all in all a nice change. They actually reminded me of savory scones, rather than biscuits. In fact, I will tweak this recipe to make a sweet scone from it. Mine didn't rise as much as the photo, but I used dried buttermilk so that could have made the difference. Special thanks to Devora1 from Northern California.....the food processor was a great time saver!

I loved these. I did not have buttermilk so used regular and a little lemon juice. My biscuits were pretty flat and dense - but I didn't mind at all. If I were making these for my parents I would decrease the sugar by half because they do not like sweetness in their biscuits. I thought it went nicely with the cornmeal and onion. I liked the onion in them even more than I expected. Will be making these again. I think the leftovers will make a great stuffing.

These sounded wonderful but mine turned out awful. The corn meal made them gritty (when a biscuit isn't expected to be so) and they just were not anything special. I won't even give them one fork as that signifies "OK."

Yum! I used a one-inch biscuit cutter, which made them two or three bite biscuits, and their flavor is enough to stand alone. I served them with roast beef and grainy mustard, but can see them with a variety of other meats or crumbled for stuffing. I am making and freezing two more batches, in order to use all the ingredients, and so I can bring to other parties. They were a hit!

These were really good, but I needed much more buttermilk than the recipe called for. I went to 1 cup, stopped measuring and started pouring it in. Maybe I'm used to a wetter biscuit (my first experience making them was using southern cook Nathalie Dupree's recipe), but I have no idea how they worked for you all with the stated amount.

Self-rising flour has leavening in it (most recipes call for about 1t baking powder to 1C flour). I made these biscuits almost completely in the food processor. It was so easy! Metal blade only. Chopped the onions, cut the butter w/ dry ingredients, added the buttermilk and dumped whole thing out to roll. Had 'em w/ chicken gravy one day and homemade tomato soup (great suggestion!) the next. DELISH!

These were fantastic! Only note, when I halved the recipe, all the proportions worked except that I needed to add a bit more buttermilk to the dough. I served the biscuits warm with the grapefruit-cranberry relish as well and that was a delicious pairing.

No longer a biscuit virgin! Though I feel I'm a relatively good cook, I've always been fearful of anything involving a rolling pin. Alas, I've conquered my fear! Dead easy, flakey beyond belief. I baked on the middle rack and they were a little too brown (not burned though); I will elevate the rack one level next time.
