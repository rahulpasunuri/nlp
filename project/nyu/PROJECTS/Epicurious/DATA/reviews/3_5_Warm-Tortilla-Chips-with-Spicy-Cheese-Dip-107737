Yummy!! I used feta and it still tasted great.

I always get a lot of requests for this recipe. It is very important to let it sit at least two hours for the flavors to mesh. The freshly roasted and ground cumin makes a big difference. I know some people who do enjoy this dip with feta but know that it tastes completely different.

This was delicious! LOVED the toasted cumin seeds. I doubled the recipe but did not double the chiles and it was still considered very spicy by party guests. The feta worked fine. Lots of compliments from guests on this one.

I've made this dip a few times and it goes over well. I skipped the roasted red peppers on the second and subsequent tries and think it's better. Add more cumin, too.

I love this recipe. It is now my dinner party favorite. It has wonderful complex flavours and is very versatile (if I don't have all the exact ingredients on hand!)

I made this and the salsa baked with Goat Cheese recipe. No one touched this dip, the flavor was spicy but not tasty, the salsa dip was a huge hit though!

Made this dip for a Cinco de Mayo party and it was a big hit. I followed the directions exactly using cotija cheese. I would not suggest using feta as a substitute for cotija and expect to get the results. The toasted cumin seeds really add a great toasty flavor. Do not short cut this step and use ground cumin from the store.

I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THIS DIP. IN FACT I THREW IT OUT. IT'S FLAVOURS JUST DIDN'T SEEM TO BLEND VERY NICELY.

Needed a quick dip recipe and just happened to have had all the ingredients on hand for this one - tho it was reduced fat feta cheese and canned green chiles. We liked it!! Will plan on making it again for a large Mexican theme party. The best use for reduced fat feta, for sure (yuk).
