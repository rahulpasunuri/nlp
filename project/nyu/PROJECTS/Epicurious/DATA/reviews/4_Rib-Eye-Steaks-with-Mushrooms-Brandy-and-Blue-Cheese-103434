This was ok but not something I would make again. I think I don't like warm blue cheese flavor.

Rating: 2
This was amazing. I cut down on the cheese and am glad I did. I think it would have been too strong otherwise. Very good sauce and easy to make. I agree with others that the sauce would also be good on pork or chicken.

This worked very well on NY strip steaks that we grilled outdoors. I made the sauce all in one pan, and it was delicious. It was plenty for 3 steaks. Would have been too much for 2, not enough for 4. Successfully used dried rosemary. Boiled down broth and mushroom mixture to almost nothing without ever coating a spoon, but the bleu cheese thickened the whole thing up and it was the perfect consistency for plopping on the steaks. Really yummy and fancy without too much effort. Will use for guests. Served with roasted red potatoes and simply boiled green beans cooked with a tablespoon of butter in the salted water. Perfection.

This recipe is by the far the favorite of our foodie group. I've made it several times (the last being tonight) and each time it comes out better than the next. This evening we finished the steaks in the oven (thicker than normal, needed extra cooking time) by putting the steaks pan and all into the oven at 400 degrees for an addt'l 5 minutes. I'd probably reduce that by two minutes or so to keep the rare middle. Otherwise, cooking the steaks in butter minus the mushroom/onion mixture resulting in a very soft, easily cutable steak. The sauce... Found the first few times that the sauce started thin but by adding either more of the cheese (I like mine a little more bleu than normal) or by adding a little flour to thicken it really makes a difference. Served with rosemary infused garlic mashed potatoes and a tomato salad. A crowd pleaser every time.

too runny. lacked consistency and diluted the flavor. my husband and 20yr old daughter both asked me never to make this again. they both like all the ingredients but together it did not gel

I needed a recipe to use up some blue cheese that I had in the fridge, and this was a really nice dish to do it with. However, since my husband and I were already a little tired of the strong cheese flavor from using it too much in the week, I heeded some prior reviews which mentioned only using a half cup. I'm glad I did as I think that any more than that would have overpowered the rest of the ingredients, but I wish that I had used a thickener to make up for the missing cheese. I'll definitely be making it again with the above adjustments, it's a great sauce for rib-eye cuts.

This was our New Year's Eve meal. Did it with a quality sirloin, puffed potatoes, and an endive salad. Wonderful.

Rating: 4
Amazing. We've done this several times with a whole beef tenderloin, which we grill, slice thick, and serve family-style with this sauce. I'm sure ribeyes would be as good or better. The proportions as listed definitely make a very "bleu-cheesey" product, so you may want to adjust quantities downward if you're looking for less intensity.

Rating: 4
Really good, easy and elegant. We had filets instead of rib eyes which worked fine. It was too much sauce for two people but I saved the leftover for round two, perhaps with chicken! I would use about 1/4 cup less blue cheese but other than that, I will definitely do it again.

Rating: 4
This was delicious!!! I might not use rib-eyes next time though, a little too fatty. Would be great with a leaner meat. My boyfriend LOVED this though!!!

Rating: 4
YUM! YUM! Delicious and easy! I would recommend reducing the quantitiy of broth to 1/2 cup so sauce is not so thin. Flavors go so well together. I have even thickened the sauce with a ittle cornstarch and served extras with garlic mashed potatoes! Whole family LOVED!

I love this recipe! I've been making it since it first appeared in the magazine. I'm always surprised at the flavor pay-off for such an easy preparation. I love the amount of blue cheese; I think the quality of blue cheese makes a difference. A cloying supermarket blue cheese (meaning that blue cheese that comes in crumbles or doesn't have any additional name besides "blue cheese") could be overpowering in a bad way.

Rating: 4
Unbelievable....this is so easy and so tasty...some reviews said the sauce was too rich, but I think it depends whether you are a blue cheese person or not...if you like blue cheese, don't change a thing....just grab a full bodied flavourful red, and you have an outstanding meal...a definite favourite that we will serve to many friends in the near future.

My wife brought home two nice T-Bones and I was ready to barbeque with my simple grilling marinade. But the wind was ferocious and it looked like snow so I opted for this recipe. It was delicious. I cut the blue cheese in about half and it was perfect. No problems with a nice thick sauce. We pan fried the steaks on a hot cast iron skillet for about 8-9 minutes which was perfect for medium rare. I'll definitely due this again, especially for folks who like that rich blue cheese flavor.

Cooked this recipe for my girlfriend tonight. I am a very neophyte cook, but it went over well. She's not a big fan of bleu cheese, so I used feta. I also used a little cornstarch to help thicken the sauce. A big hit, and an addition to my recipe box...

Rating: 4
Wow. WOW. Drop dead wonderful entree. I reduced the cheese by at least half and used a few less mushrooms for 2 filets. I also used chicken stock and it was fine. I think its a BAD idea to boil the mushrooms with the mixture (they would get tough), so I removed the mushroom mixture to a plate before cooking the filets in the same pan. Then I removed the filets before adding the liquid ingredients and reducing and then returning the shrooms to the pan to reheat. I think it would be fine to grill the steaks. The liquid will never "coat a spoon", but I reduced it to probably 1/3 cup before ading back the shrooms (they will REALLY soak up the juice), removing it from the heat and stirring in the cheese. I garnished it with a few more crumbles and served with mashed potatoes and simple green beans. Wow.

Very good. Followed other's recomendations and cut cheese in half. Definately recommend that change. We added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce. We did pan fry the steaks but next time will grill the meat to reduce the fat. Is a stand alone meal. It was so good I didn't touch my salad.

This recipe was ok - but not good enough to truly compliment the $50 in ribeyes I bought. I, too, had issues with a lack of sauce reduction. I did double the recipe - this may have had an adverse effect. I also wonder if my mushrooms had too much moisture left in them? Maybe they needed to be cooked down further before adding to the sauce? At any rate, the meal wasn't met with rave reviews. Also, the color left a bit to be desired, a little gray in my opinion. Oh well - off to try something new!

This is by far the best steak sauce I have found. I thinly sliced the steak on a bed of arugula (rocket) and spooned over the sauce. I served with roasted tiny baby potatoes, chorizo & peppers/chilli. BLOODY MARVELOUS!

This was amazing - we substituted whiskey for brandy and had a rather large onion so we added an extra tablespoon of butter, but the sauce was superb and complemented the beef perfectly.

I was surfing the net in May of 2002 looking for a good rib-eye recipe. My wife and I prefer the rib-eye (bone in) as it tends to have a better flavor than other better quality cuts. She loves blue cheese, I think it's a little strong so we agreed on feta cheese. This will be my third time with this recipe and my wife has a very good suggestion; Make enough of the sauce to save the left over for the following day and reheat it and serve over pasta. You could cube or slice any left over steak and include it also. This is definetly a FOUR FORK winner.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! Took the previous advice and used 1/2 the cheese and it was certainly enough. Also made the sauce with loin veal chops which I first seared in the pan and then finished at 475 in the oven in a baking dish. While the chops rested for 5-10 minutes I made the sauce. Also had made the mushroom, garlic,onion mixture a week earlier with mushrooms I needed to cook or throw out and then froze it, defrosting them for this recipe so the final sauce took no time.

Thanks to the cook from Cape Cod. I like when people reference other good recipes to look up. I did enjoy this one and will also try the toasted walnut butter one (it has huge ratings) I followed the advice of other reviewers.. and didn't let the cheese go too long. Cook until it JUST begins to melt.. Thus you're left with a nice texture. Use crimini mushrooms.. works nicely. Now I will go have my heart attack happily!

This is a very generous recipe for 2. It makes lots of sauce. The flavor is fantastic and the preparation easy. I made it for my husband and I using a combination of Stilton and Roquefort cheese because that's what I had in the frig. I cut back the cheese quantity by half and it was still pretty strong. Next time I will add more onion and rosemary.

I really liked this recipie, but I tweaked it a little. As others have, I grilled the steaks, but I used a little extra broth in the mushroom mix, as well as green peppercorns, and Gorgonzolla over Bleu. I melted in less cheese and added butter right at the end. Served w/mush+cheese on top and sauce around the side.I put it in a broiler to brown the cheese on top as well.

This is a fantastic dish, especially when you only cook for two...beware however, it does taste like a heart attack on a plate.

Very good. I liked the flavor of the blue cheese with the steak. The sauce was a bit thin, more so than I would like. We grilled the steaks rather than pan frying, so may have lost some of the intended flavor from the sauce, but all-in-all it was really quite tasty.

The sauce was delicious but didn't thicken as much as I would have liked. Had to use some gravy thickener which did the trick. I grilled the steaks as well rather than pan-frying. Very rich so would not make it too often.

THe dish was great...I might have won a heart with this one.I did make a couple of adjustments though. The sauce was rich and I didn't want to overpower the steak so I save some of the mushroom mix w/o sauce to top the steak off and drizzled the sauce on the plate under the steak.

This has become my husband's very favorite meal. I have also served the sauce with roasted pork tenderloin and with fresh-breadcrumb crusted pork tenderloin and it is fabulous each time. We prefer the sauce with more rosemary than the recipe calls for. This is a winner! If you liked this, you might also like the Veal Rib Eye with Ragout of Pearl Onions, Peas and Artichokes...soooo good. It's delicious with veal, beef or pork.

Rating: 3
Man, this was good!...but also very rich. Talk about heart attack on a plate -- but what a way to go. Hint for reviewers who wanted the sauce to be thicker - use beef consomme instead of broth and really bring it to a boil before pulling it off the fire and adding the cheese.

Rating: 1
Maybe this sauce just doesn't thicken in Massachusetts, but I'm with the cook from Boston. Aside to the cook from Palm Desert --- it's supposed to thicken before you add the cheese. At any rate I prefer Steaks with Blue Cheese & Toasted Walnut Butter to this one. Try it.

Rating: 0
To the person in Boston MA who had soupy sauce, you over cooked it and cooking it longer only made it worse. Next time only cook it until the cheese looks like it is 3/4 melted. It will continue to melt on the warm steaks but remain thick and creamy. Add additional room temp cheese as per your taste.

This dish was really delicious and easy - I adjusted the Bleu Cheese to taste though, as someone else also said, I was afraid the entire amount would be too overwhelming... I wound up cutting back on the cheese a bit - the sauce was SO GOOD and matched well with the steak.

We really liked this dish. I was suprised at how wonderful the flavor of the sauce turned out. That with the mushroo,onions and a good ribe eye steak was heaven. My husband just about died at every bite! We will definatly make this again, and I would reccomend using an expensive brandy,with a good quality blue cheese. This is a spendy dish to make but worth the effort and the money!

Rating: 4
Delicious recipe!!! I was hesitant about mixing cheese with steak, but I was plesantly surprised! I used 1 cup low fat blue cheese, rather than 1 1/4. Also, I sprinkled the steaks with salt and lots of ground black pepper. I pan seared the steaks with a little olive oil and some slices of garlic (gave the steaks a more complex flavor). After cooking steaks, I would also suggest tenting the steaks with foil then putting the reserve juices back into your sauce-this will help thicken it.

Made this for dinner last night. It was delicious however I had a slight problem with the sauce, it never thickened enough to "lightly coat a spoon" even after boiling for more than 10 minutes. I gave up at that point and just proceeded. Not sure what I did wrong. Followed the recipe to the letter except for 2 things: I doubled it to serve 4 and made the mushroom mixture about an hour and a half in advance so I could spend more time with guests and less time in the kitchen. After the steaks were done I proceeded with the recipe as indicated. Could it be that the mushroom mixure sat too long? The dish was still delish even if the sauce was very soupy. Want to make it again- Any advice?

I'd make this recipe again, especially for company. I toned down the richness of the recipe by using broth instead of butter to sautee the onions and I used only two ounces of blue cheese instead of four. The recipe is for two people--who wants to eat more than one ounce of blue cheese, anyway?

I will definately make this again, we loved the mushroom/cheese mixture. It was very caloric though. So I cut down a little bit on the cheese and butter, and it still turned out great.!
