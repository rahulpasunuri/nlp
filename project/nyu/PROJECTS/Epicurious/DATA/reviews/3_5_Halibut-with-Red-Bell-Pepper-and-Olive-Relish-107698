I thought this recipe was outstanding! I actually used all of the relish on the fish fillets, and substituted barramundi for the halibut because it happened to be on sale. Delicious!

Wow! This was the best fish recipe I've made in a long time. Based on a few previous reviews, I added Kalamata olives to the mix, and increased the Balsamic to 2 tablespoons. Also added a little extra tomato paste. I made the full relish recipe for 2 servings of fish. It was very flavorful and received rave reviews from my husband. Can't understand why some said it was ho hum and lacked flavor. They must have done something wrong. I think the relish would even make a great bruschetta topping. It was that good. Who ever said it would have been good served with orzo or couscous was spot on.

Fixed this for dinner last night. Put the first forkful in my mouth and thought it was delicious. Didn't change the recipe in any way. My husband and I thought it was wonderful!

This is a great go-to dish. The only change I make is to add in kalamata olives as well as the green olives. It goes great with couscous or orzo.

Made this for my parents to rave reviews. Mistakenly bought tilapia instead of halibut and used tried thyme instead of fresh but everything else was according to recipie. I'm not particularly fond of red peppers but I couldn't get enough of the relish! Am making it again tonight for my husband and will increase the amount of relish I make.

Wish there still was a question mark for "would you make this dish again". We enjoyed this but think there are many better recipes for halibut on this site. Only change I made was to use a mixture of olives; pimento stuffed, unstuffed Sicilian and Kalamata.

wonderful dish. I usually find halibut bland but this was great. As someone suggested I didn't bake the fish, just poached it in the pepper/garlic/onion mixture (left the veggies in) My husband just ate the leftover relish from a bowl it was so good. We had no leftovers and I made extra sauce.

I thought it was just OK. My husband probably enjoyed more than me.

We followed this recipe (kind of improvising with larger amounts for the relish in order to make more) and really enjoyed it. The cayenne gives it a nice kick. Will make it again. Might try black olives as a variation.

I removed the peppers and olives from the saute pan and made a court boullion. After removing & discarding the veggies from the boullion, I poached the fish in it. I then removed the fish to a plate & covered with foil while adding 4 tablespoons of white wine to broth & reducing. The I added the olive mixture as well as 2 tablespoons of butter to the sauce, put the fish back in to warm for a moment, & served. It was wonderful served with olive oil mashed potatoes & steamed veggies.

I've made this many times. I really like it with turbot. I leave out the olives because my family doesn't like them. I usually double the relish and my husband eats it straight. Easy to make!

So easy to make and my husband and I loved it! Great combo using olives and red bell pepper. I didnt have any tomato paste so I left it out. I wouldn't bother using it the next time I make it!

To the cook from New Jersey re: left over tomato paste, freeze it in tablespoon amounts or buy a tube of concentrated tomato paste. It is a wonderful recipe, I've been making it over and over again

Great recipe! Easy and always comes out good. Used black olives (instead of green). Added some white wine to pan with fish and relish in the oven.

After reading the reviews I think the percentage is skewed low somehow. My husband and I loved this relish. Properly prepared halibut is always wonderful but the combination of flavors in the relish really makes this recipe special. Be sure and buy fresh halibut.

I didn't have fresh thyme so I used a sprinkle of dried. Tasted fine. Nice change of pace on a weeknight but nothing special. And now I'm going to be spending the next month looking for recipes to use up the rest of the can of tomato paste!

Very nice and interesting. Refreshing change and I've never had anything quite like this before. Made it with red snapper (better pairing than with halibut). The relish is strong so it would overpower the halibut. Served it with plain white rice and it was great. Difficult to describe the taste but you must like red peppers and green olives to enjoy this dish. Quite simple and easy to make as well. One thing I changed was reducing the balsamic. One tablespoon would be too vinegary for my taste. Need just a nice bite. Dish is not bland in the slightest.

I love olives and love halibut but this recipe did nothing for me. Enjoyed it but too boring to do it again. Sorry Jason!

Fantastic dish! I made it and my husband thought it rated among my 10 best dishes ever! I then made it for guests and it was a big hit. RAVES!

As a young black man growing up in China, I know the importance of fine dining. This dish that Jay Gareffa created tickled my tastebuds in ways that I care not to mention. (You know what ways..Oh Tom you devil) I tried this dish with my friends Dalon and Derek from the hood. We thought it was masterful. The halibut and red pepper just complimented the 40 of Old E so nicely but the olive relish made me think more along the lines of and ice cold Elephant from Fette's. Either way I think this young man has a bright future. Brighter than that little flashlight he clung ever so tightly to in the dark woods of Monson. Boner pet it!
