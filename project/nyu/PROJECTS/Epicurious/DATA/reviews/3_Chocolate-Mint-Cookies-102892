The texture is distinctively different from most cookies. The interior is brownie-like, but the exterior is, as other reviewers have noted, almost taffy-like. Adding 3/4 tsp. of peppermint extract does create an appealing flavor. I found them to be very sugary, and not quite what I had hoped for in the way of texture.

I have been making these cookies for years. They are very easy to burn, take them out at 15 minutes even if they don't look done yet. I often make them with half bittersweet and half semi-sweet chocolate. I also made a gluten free batch for a friend using rice flour and they came out great.

i've made these cookies a dozen times for classmates and coworkers and they keep asking me to make more! the only complainers were not fans of mint. if you omit the peppermint extract from the recipe, it becomes a great (plain) double chocolate cookie. however i like it extra minty so i doubled the peppermint extract. love that chewiness too! (:

These cookies are, hands-down, the best I have ever made. They are fudgey and delicious, and my finickey boyfriend said they are the best he has ever had in his life! I took the temp down by 25 degrees and baked them a few minutes less than the recipe calls for, because my first batch burned on the bottom and got too crunchy. After making those adjustments, they were amazing! I recommend these to anyone. Also, I added 50% additional mint extract to the recipe and used dark chocolate chips in the dough.

loved these! next time i think i'll try with orange extract instead of mint, but great with the amount of mint doubled. will definitely make again.

These are wonderful! Slightly crisp around the edges, chewy in the center. I read the prior comments and added twice the mint extract - they were a little TOO minty that way, nex time I'll add more but not double. I'll also make them again without the mint because I love the texture, as did my 15 month old daughter.

This recipe was delicious! I was low fat because no marg or oil and the mint gave it a refreshing taste. I subbed the corn syrup for molasses and brown sugar for the white. I oiled the cookie sheet and if you take it off right away it dosent stick to the sheet! Great if you want to make cookied quickly and minimize the mess!

These cookies were good but not great. I would have liked them better if they were mintier. Also, they were a bit too chewy-almost like taffy. I am going to try freezing them. That may bring out the mint flavor.

Made these for my mother in law who is a Choc/mint nut. Even she didn't like them. I found them to be a bit tough and chewy.

I made these rich cookies to satisfy my chocolate craving. I didn't want to mess with foil and butter so I used parchment paper and they didn't stick at all. Right out of the oven the inside was mush and I wasn't sure if they were done, but they hardened overnight and turned out chewy and delicious.

They were okay at first. After a couple of days though, they got really tough and hard to chew. I don't think I did anything wrong. I wouldn't make them again.

Rating: 3
As other cooks have mentioned, I would add half again as much mint extract. One big suggestion is missing from the instructions for appearance. I did drop "heaping spoonfuls" and they looked ragged and uneven. If you roll the chilled dough into balls before baking then you have uniform, nicely cracked and presentable cookies. They also retain a chewier interior as well.

Rating: 3
They were great, but not how I had expected! Very crunchy, very rich (I used Ghiardelli double chocolate chips...yummm!) Subtle mint flavor because there was so much chocolate flavor. Perfect! (I was scared because my spoon-lick of the batter was disgustingly minty. I was afraid I mas making toothpaste cookies!) I plan to make them again for Christmas next week.

When I first made these cookies, I found that the bottoms burned too easily-I tried again with a second batch, readjusting the position of the oven racks, and they came out just fine. :) I loved the fudgy, rich texture they had, and had no problem with them sticking (I used Pam cooking spray on aluminum foil covered cookie sheets.) However, I found that the mint flavoring was barely detectable, so I made up a glaze with confectioners sugar, milk, and pep. extract-it made them great, and they were a big hit with everyone. I'd definitely make these again :)

I brought these to a dinner party and they were a big hit. The mint flavor is very faint, so if you want a strong minty flavor, you may want to add another drop or two of peppermint extract. Also, I put the leftovers in a sealed tupperware, but they still lost their chewyness the next day! So eat them quickly!

I would definitly make these again, not cooking them so long and not adding mint flavoring makes them appealing to almost anyone- i didnt add any mint flavor and everyone loved them.

These didn't come out looking like the picture at all. I hated them. I didn't enjoy cooking them and really not very good. Son couldn't taste the mint. They weren't chewy, they were crunchy and didn't cook looking nice at all. Bad bad recipe.

These cookies are wonderful--and easy to make vegan, just use dark chocolate chips and powdered egg replacer. Good quality chocolate is essential, I ruined them once by using cheap chocolate, but I've made them a number of times with good chocolate and they've been delicious.

I made these cookies for a treat for the customer service representatives for Customer Service Week and I received many requests for the recipe. Delicious!

I was worried about the cookies sticking after reading the reviews, but had no problem (you really just have to prepare the baking sheets well). Very different texture and taste - either you love it or hate it. If you prefer cookies chewy rather than crunchy and love mint, you'll love it. If you prefer traditional crunchy cookies and don't care for mint, you'll hate it. My tasters had mixed reviews based on these preferences but the ones who liked the concept loved the cookies.

i made these cookies for my husband's birthday, and he asked me never to make them again for him. they were too chewy and tasted like a reduced-fat version of a chocolate cookie. i ended up throwing out half of the batch because no one would eat them.

They did not come out like they look in the pisture. They were flat and if I didn't watch them real well, they burnt. They actually tasted great, but they looked awful.

I was SO surprised at the mixed reaction for these cookies! They are my FAVORITES and every single time I've made them I am asked for the recipe. My only comment is that when you scoop out the first batch, they always look and taste beautiful, but when you scoop out batch #2, after the batter has been refrozen or sitting on the counter, they look very grainy and not smooth and softly cracked. Still, I suspect others might be overcooking or something because I've always had excellent luck with these terrific cookies.

These are some of the best cookies I've ever tasted and everyone who tries them says the same. I even had someone beg me to sell them a batch for the holidays! I add even more mint than the recipe calls for, and they're scrumptuous (I'm a real mint lover). After making them several times, the way I've found to keep them from sticking is to bake them on insulated baking sheets, use parchment paper sprayed with cooking spray, then let them cool most of the way on the baking sheet before moving them to a wire rack to finish cooling. I also don't put the batter in the freezer, but instead put it in the fridge for a short while. I use a double boiler for melting the chocolate, since I haven't yet gotten myself to trust the microwave for that. They freeze really well, too. If you like cocolate and mint together, these cookies really are worth a try!

These cookies were gross. I do not recommend them. Not enough chocolate flavor, definetly too much mint flavor.

These cookies were easy to make and tasted delicious. It is important to use excellent, fresh ingredients and good quality baking sheets. If the dough is cold enough the cookies shouldn't stick to the aluminum foil.

Rating: 2
The cookies stuck to the foil and would not come off. So the next batch, I buttered the foil generously and the bottoms lookoed shiny and it was just gross. the first batch tasted good though. Also, they didn't taste minty at all and i put all the extract in.

Give me a break. The people who said this recipe didn't turn out good don't know how to cook, or should I say bake. These are some of the best cookies I've ever made, and I have made them and brought them into work with other desserts and they're a huge hit. Maybe people aren't melting the chocolate the right way in the microwave, that can make all of the difference. I bake them at 335 degrees instead of 350 for 15 minutes, and it they're the perfect combination of chewey and a bit crunchy, these cookies are excellent. Maybe they should also check the positon of the tray in the oven. I don't know how anyone can say these aren't good. Its also important to change the foil when baking because the bottoms will burn easily, and make sure to butter the foil generously. Great cookies.

The idea of these cookies sounds good. But the recipe really didn't deliver. They turned out tough and crumbly. I even tried to under-bake a batch.

I have made these 3 times since I tried teecipe at Christmastime. All whom have tasted them have requested more, or the recipe itself. In fact several of the mechanics that I work with have even expressed an interest in learning to bake over this recipe. Excellent, thank you much for what will become a household specialty here.

As an avid cookie baker, I was anxious to try this one, but was disappointed. I followed the directions exactly, but didn't like the look of them when they came out of the oven and each tray-ful looked a little different. The edges were too well done and with 2 1/2 cups of chips I would have liked them to taste more chocolatey. There also wasn't enough mint flavor. I agree with the cook who said they taste a little "eggy" the longer they sit out and for me that was only about an hour or so on a cooling rack. Give the recipe a try, but I wouldn't recommend doing it right before company comes in case you're dissatisfied as I was. If you want a good chocolate mint cookie recipe do a search for "mint chocolate cookie". There's a recipe for a great one in the December 2000 issue of Bon Appetit. You can also take a double chocolate chip cookie recipe and add a teaspoon of peppermint extract and get wonderful results as I usually do. If you like the combination of chocolate and orange, use orange extract or the grated zest of a large orange. E-mail me for a specific recipe! Good luck!

I would put this in between 2 and 3 forks, but would definitely make it again with some changes. First off, and this is my fault, I used milk chocolate chips because I didn't have semisweet, and that may have made a difference. Also, I would use a little more peppermint. And I would definitely try to serve these quickly because the longer they waited around the more stale they became, which brought out the egg flavor. Still, I love chocolate and peppermint and will try this quick and easy recipe again.

Very easy to make- they were ready to go in the oven after the ten minutes in the freezer. After 15 minutes in the oven they were perfect. The only thing I did differently was use mini chocolate chips. I wish all recipes turned out this well the first time I made them!

These cookies got rave reviews from co-workers and roommates. They are easy to make. I love mint, so I added a tiny bit more peppermint extract. I agree with an earlier reviewer; watch the baking carefully. The first batch I baked, I baked for 15 minutes and the bottoms were a little too crispy and dark. I would suggest 12-13 minutes.

This recipe was OK, but nothing too great. I think the lack of flour made the cookies to flat and runny. Also, it had to be frozen for way more than 10 minutes, so it wasn't really a quick recipe.

Very rich cookies and very pretty-looking. The tops are wrinkly and crackled like brownies, and the texture is wonderfully chewy. The chocolate and mint are both well balanced and go great together. I didn't have dark corn syrup, and substituted light corn syrup, also decreased the amount of chocolate chips folded in at the end--it still tasted great.

The cookies are unusual and rich, almost like brownies. I made 30 (rather than 21) and they were still large. The recipe is quite easy. My family enjoyed these; I will definitely make them again.
