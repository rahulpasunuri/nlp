I made this recipe with some slight variations, most notably some white miso broth for the chicken stock. We really enjoyed it. I have one question - can anyone explain why there is stock added to the dressing? Seems unusual, and I'd love to understand why it's there. Thanks!

I was looking for a warm weather dish, so was not interested in turning on the oven to roast vegetables (as suggested by other reviewers). I used what was on hand - brown rice, finely julienned carrots, grated zucchini, some red and yellow pepper, scallions and the dressing as written, with the veggies all uncooked. It was great. Didn't end up using all the dressing. Might toss on some sunflower seeds next time.

Even though I "toasted" the rice per the cook from Southern Colorado, and added garlic, this was an uninteresting salad. Worse, it didn't keep over well at all, an essential in my cooking life, as I always try to make 2 meals at once. The peppers and celery developed a funky aftertaste. My spouse liked it even less, and suggested we not even try to save the leftovers.

Thank you, mnancyjean, for suggesting to roast the veggies instead! I put my broiler on high and cut up all the veggies (I added cherry tomatoes from my local farmer's market), sprinkled them with finely chopped rosemary and roasted them all on a baking sheet for a few minutes - still crunchy, but much more flavorful! I'll be eating this all summer to maintain that bikini body!

Forget blanching - roast those veggies! Let the veg cool to room temp and then toss with the arugula, rice and dressing while the rice is still warm. The heat of the rice will slightly wilt the arugula (which is wonderfully tasty in this dish) and really enhance the dressing flavors. We served it with Ina Garten's Sole Meuniere.

Fantastic! Used spinach instead of arugula and left out the scallions, a bit more lemon and mustard, added an orange pepper...delicious! I did cook the squash/celery a bit more, like three minutes, but it was great. All three kids loved it, and even my hubby who usually won't touch things like this ate it up.

I liked it, but couldn't understand wether the scallions had to be raw or not. So, I did not include them in the salad, and increased the lemon juice to give more strength.

Good side dish. We used it as a side to grilled salmon. Often, when making a rice dish, I will "fry" the dry rice in 1-2 Tbsp. cooking oil (I use sunflower or olive) until it gets toasty, then add boiling water or broth. Cooking time is usually about the same, but the result is a nuttier-tasting rice. For the remainder of the salad, I used what was in my fridge - white onion, 2 Tbsp soy sauce diluted with 2 Tbsp water (instead of broth), carrots, celery, and some mixed organic salad mix chopped up. Very nice side dish.

Great Inspiration to make it my own. I used what was in my fridge: carrots, orange pepper, spinach, watercress, red onion, grape tomatoes and dill. Didnt used broth or mustard for dressing, but lots of lemon, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and dill. The dill really brought everything together. Light , yet hearty, tasty, crunchy. will serve with salmon.

I liked it. Used twice the amount of brown rice, and about the same amount of everything else. Used water instead of broth because I was in a hurry. Made the rice the day before. It's light yet substantial and packed with nutrients. Added the tomatoes, and thought avocado might also be good next time.

Excellent with the help of previous reviewer's modifications. The spinach instead of arugula, grape tomatoes cut in half, and crumbled feta give this dish the zing that it needs. I've made it several times for family and to take to pot luck dinners. A healthy alternative to all those simple starches out there!

Very veggie. And healthy tasting. Not crazy about the dressing. The overall taste is mediocre and predictable. Brown rice mixed with semi raw vegetables. Now how exciting can that be?? Used spinach instead of arugula. Will not make again. Too boring and not interesting to the palate.

Great side dish for grilled ahi tuna. I put some extra mustard in the dressing to add some needed zing. I might add a bit of garlic next time too. I added the leftover grilled tuna to the salad the next day and it made a tasty and very healthy lunch.

Very good and light for spring/summer. I took the advice of other reviewers and added spinach(fresh), feta and added fresh grape tomatoes. I omitted celery(i think it's yucky), arugula (because I didn't have on hand)and zucchini. I also didn't bother with the broth and used dijon mustard instead. I usually have these ingredients around so it wasn't a big production, especially when you have leftover brown rice. Paired with grilled salmon, it was delicious!

I think it might just be a taste preference. It wasn't a bad taste, it just wasn't something I enjoyed the flavor of.

Very pretty and very tasty. Loved the crunch. I added a little more mustard than called for and it had a nice kick. I also substituted spinach (I actually used frozen and it was fine). A keeper.

This was the prettiest salad on the buffet table - too bad it just didn't have any flavor. Very disappointing. I'd make it again, because it really was beautiful, so bright and colorful, but definitely come up with a modification to the dressing to kick it up a bit.

This was excellent--the mustard really made for a tasty dressing. I too used spinach and added some cooked lentils. I also added some crumbled feta. This recipe will go in the rotation for summer lunches! VEGETARIAN OPTION: Scoop out some of the water that you blanched the vegetables in and use that in place of the chicken broth in the dressing.

Excellent! I did not have any arugula so I used spinach leaves instead. Okay to make the day before, the leaves don't get soggy.
