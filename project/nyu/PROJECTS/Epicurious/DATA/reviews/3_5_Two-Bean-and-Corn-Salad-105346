Delicious! I added a bit of honey to the dressing and used black beans and small white beans. Didn't use celery - just peppers and onions.

Gets 4 forks for ease of making, ingredients regularly on hand (except cilantro) and fresh flavors. Didn't use jalapenos because feeding wee ones, but still delicious.

Incredibly easy to make with frozen or even good-quality canned corn. Very flavorful; excellent with grilled or southwestern dinners. I substituted balsamic dressing and added cumin and fresh cilantro.

This is a summer time favorite. I use four or five ears of fresh sweet corn instead of frozen and skip the great northern beans. Otherwise, I make it as is. It is always a hit at potlucks or summer gatherings.

This is a great recipe for a crowd. I had no jalapenos, so what? And instead of Great Northern beans I put in a can of Mixed Beans (that's what was in my cupboard). So delicious. I'd definitely make it again.

This has been my favorite summer salad! I think it's better the next day! I use raw sweet corn cut from the stalk.The sweet crunch makes it! I like red onion because this tends to be a bit sweet with the red pepper and corn.When ever I make this I get raves!

I always make this for a crowd and always to raves. Because we're in the Southwest, I always use pintos instead of Great Northern, omit the celery and add a yellow pepper for additional color. I too, use Vidallia instead of red onion and add a lot more jalapeno. I mix this all up a day or two early and add the cilantro just before serving. Like other reviewers, we'll eat it as a side dish and as a 'salsa'!

I did lemon juice instead of vinegar, added an adobo chili to the dressing, skipped the celery (don't think it works here) and cilantro (because i didn't have it but think it would be good). Did chickpeas instead of Northern because that's what I had. If it weren't for my no dairy diet, I would've added feta.

This is a great, flavorful side dish that I have made numerous times. I have substitued canellini beans for the navy beans before and it is very good that way. I love the cilantro and cumin flavors - it is a wonderful summer side dish, full of color and flavor. I recommend it!!

Great salad for the summer- fresh and cool. Kick it up a notch with additional cilantro and keep the seeds from the jalapeño pepper in!

Very easy to prepare. Using Vidalia onions allows you to put in the entire cup.

It was ok, but pretty bland and uninspiring. Would need major doctoring to be interesting, but not worth the effort for me.

this is a summer staple at our house! everyone always asks for the recipe! we omit the celery (we don't like it) & use only the black beans. i subbed pickled jalapenos out of necessity once, & i actually liked it better, so we use them all of the time now.

Delicious! finally found a bean salad that is easy and first-rate. Only changes were: used garbanzo beans (instead of navy or pinto) and lessened red onion to abt 1/3rd cup

Absolutely superb, a tongue treat from start to finish and easy to make..... I roasted the corn on the grill, and used red bell pepper for color. As we like spicy, I left the jalapeno's intact, and just sliced thinly with a coase chop to finish... It will be a regular on our summer menu list.

Also made this for a Labor Day BBQ. I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup, added lemon juice, another cup of corn, chopped seeded tomatoes instead of the bell pepper and substituted chopped green onions for the red. Like another reviewer, I find that raw red onions are overpowering. Next time I'd add two more chopped celery stalks and maybe the avocado. People were scooping this up with tortilla chips. Good stuff!

I made this for a Labor Day BBQ and everyone loved it. It is so easy to make and the variety of colors made a wonderful presentation. I went with a few suggestions by others and added carrots, 3 jalepenos instead of 2, and was liberal with the salt. I also added the juice of one lime to give it a bit of tang.

Very pretty blend of colors: black beans, creamy pinto beans, light green celery and deep green cilantro, red pepper, yellow corn, (added 1 cup) chopped carrot. After "vegging up" the full 1/3 cup of oil was needed and I RARELY use as much oil as specified. Next time I'll skip the starchy corn and substitute chopped tomato [later note: we preferred the corn to tomato, which got mushy by the second day]. Used 1/2 of a large jalepeno and while the dish was quite peppery even to my taste when first made (and I wondered if my pepper-sensitive guests would even eat it), five hours later there was no jalapeno pick-me-up and I wished I'd added the whole thing. A great summer salad to keep on hand. Do think a bit of chopped avocado would be a nice change in texture on occasion. Perfect with brined pork chops with spicy chutney from this site.

I have made this recipe time and time again and always with raves from guests. I do however, substitute fresh squeezed lime juice in place of the balsamic. It gives it a nice summery fresh taste and keeps all the veggies crisp!

I did not put the peppers and I loved it anyway. I made it for a party and everyone raved.

This is always a crowd-pleaser, and I've modified the recipe each time in search of perfection. Agree with the other reviewers, that you only need 1/2 to 1/3 of the amount of oil called for, and I've cut down on the onions because they can overpower the dish. Added a couple of dashes of hot sauce this last time and salt and pepper (it definitely needs salt) and I think I'm getting close. Will try the avocado recommended by another reviewer. Delicious!

I agree with another reviewer that this is a recipe that can be improvised easily and for fun. I used pinto beans in place of the Northern beans because then are firmer and I like them paired with black beans. I also added one pint of halved grape tomatoes.

made this for a second time this month. (have to utilize the fresh seasonal corn) i highly reccomend corn on the cob instead of frozen. please try with cajun shrimp tacos-PERFECT

My second time making this salad so I halved the olive oil and doubled the balsamic. All the rest stayed the same except that corn was in season so used fresh corn...not worth the trouble. As usual this receipe can be a great starting point for playing around. How come we do that? The heat was just right. The first time I used hot chili paste instead of the jalopenos...This is a keeper!

Rave reviews from guests. I served it with lump crab cakes for an outdoor casual meal. (I did omit the jalapeno.)

I have made this twice now and we love it. I used only one jalepeno because of the five year old picky eater but the flavor was still exceptional. Definately a keeper

Great base for a summer salad! We omitted celery and red pepper and added seeded chopped tomato. Also tried reviewer below's suggestion of fresh corn. Two ears worked beautifully -- so delicious and incredibly easy. Salad is even better the next day (we only used about 3 tbsp of oil, and a little extra vinegar, so perhaps that why ours wasn't mushy). Will definitely keep this one handy for a super summer side dish.

I took Eileen's word for it and doubled the recipe so I would have left-overs. Not a good idea....it turned to mush. I used fresh sweet corn, cut from the cob, instead of frozen. It was YUMMY!!!

I took this salad to a football tailgaiter. Everyone had seconds and thirds. It went well with enchiladas. I doubled the recipe although kept the amount of the oil the same. I also added additional balsamic vinegar. Will definately make again.

Very good, but I thought this salad needed some salt and pepper. I used white onion instead of red, and it picked a very interesting color from the beans (I don't recommend it).

Very tasty. I used half of the oil and served it with tortillas. Definitely a keeper.

Very tasty! This is a healthy but satisfying combination of flavors. Used a little less oil than called for, and it seemed fine. I timidly put in only one jalapeno--2 or 3 should be better. Also added cut up avocado right before serving (gotta get that fat content back up there!)
