These are perfect BBQ ribs for people who don't care for traditional BBQ sauce. Made this marinade to marinate flank steak (over night) sliced on the diagonal and then skewered on bamboo then grilled till done - absolutely amazing! Rave reviews from everyone at our 4th of July BBQ!

Nothing wrong with this nice standard recipe that suits fussy eaters. I found this recipe at the last minute when I realized my own recipe for BBQ ribs wasn't going to suit the collective palettes of the crowd I was cooking for. I didn't use the dipping sauce but only because I didn't think my guests would try it. I baked and basted in the oven for 2 hours at 350, increased the honey and decreased the salt, like other cooks suggested. I wouldn't make again but only because I have my own recipe that I typically use.

These ribs are the best. Chewy and wonderful flavors. A hit every time I make them.

I also loved this recipe. I found it a bit salty, so when I do it again, I might increase the honey and cut back a bit on the soy sauce. The dipping sauce is a great touch--make sure you choose juicy limes, or the saltiness again increases. I baked these for about 1.5 hours at 350 and the meat was falling off the bone. Great meal!

New, different, and tasty (: ! Used the recipe as a guideline as I'm not a huge one for measuring but used all the ingredients. Cooked it on the grill, mostly indirect and took awhile but was well worth it. I was afraid the meat would become tough because the marinade was drying off and there weren't any instructions to baste it, but they turned out great. Only negative point was it was a bit too saltiness and my mom coughed with all the pepper. Sauce reminds me of the same thing I dip shrimp in (you should try it if you haven't). Would make this again though!

I'm one of those BBQ guys who built their own smoker and makes his own rubs, etc. These ribs were exceptional, bar none. But it's hard to get tender ribs when grilled as in this recipe. I marinated them only about 2 hours, cooked them foil-covered at 350 for 1-1.5 hours and finished them on the grill for 5 minutes a side on full blast. If you think it's too salty or too fishy, you could cut back the marinade time.

I am not a rib person at all, but I couldn't get enough of these ones! The flavors are amazing, I just followed the recipe. The dipping sauce is a must, it adds a lot to the flavor of the ribs. I marinated them overnight. I don't have access to a barbecue so I just cooked them in the oven at 350 for about 2 hours (check them often after 1 1/4-1 1/2 hours, they may be done sooner). My husband says they're better than any ribs he's ever had at a restaurant. We will make these often, and try the marinade with chicken too.

I made this recipe and, I kid you not, convinced a strict vegetarian to try it. She ended up eating FOUR ribs. The mixture of flavors are amazing. Although some reviews below felt the ginger was overpowering, I feel the ginger is a key element to providing the marinade with its rich flavor. I agree that trying brown sugar or adding a little molasses might be a nice addition but I have not tried that personally. The one "MUST DO" for this recipe is the dipping sauce. My mom made this dipping sauce frequently when she served meat and chicken while I was growing up so I wanted to stay true to our tradition. It was the dipping sauce that convinced my vegan friend to try. I am so happy I found this recipe and will use it again and again. In matter of fact, just writing about it makes me want to make it tonight!

I knew this would be a good recipe. Just look at the ingredients! What surprised me was that it took VERY little effort. I only had time to marinate mine for 2 1/2, hours and the flavor payout was superb. imagine if I let it go overnight? WOW! Do not under any circumstances omit the fish sauce. DO NOT!

This is a delicious marinade. I did not do the dipping sauce. I also precooked the ribs covered in foil in a 350 degree oven for 1 hr. 45 min. Then finished on the barbeque for 10 min. ---superb!

Excellent recipe! Next time I'll sub low sodium soy and use slightly more honey. The lime/pepper/salt dip is essential to round out the flavors - a very nice departure from western ribs.

Amazingly delicious ribs. I left out the fish sauce and did not miss it. I also didn't use the salt dip because they were very good on their own. A must try!

I love these ribs! We still use charcoal, so I cooked them indirectly for about 45 min, then browned/blackened them. I wasn't sure about the dipping sauce, but it's good. I've substituted ground black pepper for the white, with good success. Now I want to try smoking them in my stovetop smoker!

Everyone in the house devoured the ribs. It's a great change from southern sweet tomato-based BBQ sauce. Skip the dipping sauce and drizzle the lime juice directly on the ribs. I tried one small bowl of the dipping sauce. The taste was OK in small dips, but anything more made gave the rib a grainy white pepper taste.

I loved this one. The ribs were juicy and the ginger gave 'em a nice sharp taste that I matched with a Dogfish 30 Minute IPA. I've done these a few times although I haven't gotten brave enough to do the "sauce."

The amount of fresh ginger in this recipe was way too heavy for my liking. I kept scraping it off my ribs to eat them. Other than that the other flavors were nice. Might try it again with much less ginger, maybe 1-2 tbsp instead of 1/4 cup.

We just prepared this and it was fabulous! Only made a half a rack for two and ended up wishing we had more. Looking forward to trying the marinade on pork tenderloin or chicken. Sub substituted brown sugar for salt in the dipping sauce. Yummy!

After marinating we smoked these ribs for 6 hours in our Big Green Egg. Fabulous. Love our Big Green Egg!

Way too SALTY!!! I went against my better instincts following a tablespoon of salt plus soy sauce plus fish sauce... I marinated for the full day so that might have been part of it... the ribs were tender, but the salt was so overwhelming that we threw out the left overs.

This is a great rib recipe. I would cut back on the salt a bit and skip the dipping sauce. Used it on chicken as well. The last eight minutes of grilling could be reduced - the ribs started to char too rapidly.

I have made this twice. The first time was not a success. The ginger was over powering and it was missing something. My boyfriend and I were excited to try this again with some of our own additions to the recipe. The second time had people sucking on the bones and their fingers! We followed the recipe exactly with the addition of 2 tbls molasses, omitted the regular sugar and replaced it with 2 1/2 tbls brown sugar, and a dash of dark sesame oil. These ribs were so good, we have found our stable marinade. I only gave three forks because I had to amend the original recipe to my liking.

The marinade was fabulous. I would cut the salt a little, and we consulted our Weber "bible" and opted for slow cooking. You can't cook great ribs in 18 minutes.

This turned out terribly for me. I followed the marinade exactly and the ribs tasted like fish! The fish sauce completely overwhelmed every other flavor except the ginger so it tasted like fish and ginger ribs, it was gross. I'm not sure why this happened as I followed the marinade exactly unless my fish sauce was too strong (checked the expiration and it is brand new). Wanted to like this but never again!

We thought this recipe was way too salty, with kosher salt, soy sauce and fish sauce. Would definitely not make it again.

yummm... ths is my new favorite rib marinade. I thought it was too salty with the dipping sauce, but liked the tange added by the lime and white pepper. Next time I will probably just add some white pepper to the marinade and a squeeze of lime at serving instead of using the dipping sauce. My husband loved it just way it was, though.

Very simple tasty marinade! Used it on pork chops and they came out nicely caramelized on the surface but very moist on the inside. Only change I would make is to double the ginger next time as I did not get a strong ginger flavor in the finished product. Dipping sauce quantities per person were a bit wasteful. I served half the called for amounts to each person and there was still a lot wasted. A little bit goes a long way with this dipping sauce since the recipe already has plenty of salt in it.

Fantastic marinade. The cooking times are off though.

I have now made this twice. The first time I followed the directions and the ribs came out a little salty. This last time I made the following changes. First I doubled the recipe, except as follows. Still only used 6 cloves of garlic they were large cloves. Used about 1/2 tablespoon of kosher salt and I added some juice from a pineapple that I had just cut up and the core was thrown in the food processor to add some more sugar and acid. They marinated for about 10 hours and they taste great
