Wow! This was incredible-so light and refreshing. A really good sweet, ripe honeydew is a must. The mint added a perfect coolness. I also used lime juice and it was awesome!

Incredibly refreshing, clean-tasting sorbet. I used fresh lime juice rather than lemon, and much more than called for. I had no problems making the minted simple syrup. I served this as a palate cleanser and everyone loved it. I've been asked to make more!

I think the cook from Pittsburgh must have done something wrong. I have made the minted simple syrup several times and never had the "brown foam" problem. It comes out clear and delicious -- great also for iced tea or on vanilla ice cream. LOVED the honeydew sorbet -- beautiful and with a light, clean taste that's perfect for a summer dinner. I serve it with brownies and get rave reviews.

This was delicious.The color was just the palest mint green,and the honeydew flavor came through,despite the mint.(Of course the melon has to be flavorful to begin with.)Very refreshing.

The minted simple syrup was a disappointment that ruined the honeydew color and flavor. Boiling the mint leaves produced a brown foam that I had to skim off, and it turned the honeydew a dark, dull green. Next time I'd cool the syrup before adding the mint leaves. I found that the mint flavor was unnecessarily strong, although perhaps I just packed my measuring cup too tightly. I think a very light hint of mint flavor would allow the natural sweetness of the honeydew to shine through.
