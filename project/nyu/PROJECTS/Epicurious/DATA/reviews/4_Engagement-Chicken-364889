I made this last night for dinner, it took about an hour longer than the recipe stated, so by the time we ate we were ravenous... HOWEVER... It was absolutely delicious! The flavor of the lemon really shone through without being overpowering, and it was moist and juicy despite being in the oven forever (that may just be the way my oven cooks :P). A bit of tweaking and this recipe will be the household norm :)

My fiance love love loved this dish! Although he had already proposed to me, I can tell that he was so excited of my cooking of this dish! I added some rosemary to the seasoning while the chicken was cooking and I think was a good addition. We are using the leftovers for chicken soup! Such a wonderful and easy recipe! Suggest it for new chefs and eager ladies! xxoo

Instead of putting the chicken on a rack, I fill my largest rectangular pyrex pan with fresh baby spinach and put the chicken on that. Then I surround the chicken with lots of other veggies. It's a complete meal and fabulous! I make this once a week.

I have 100 Recipes Every Woman Should Know in my shopping cart at amazon and after trying this Engagement Chicken recipe I'll definitely be buying it. I'm married but my husband loved this recipe. I told him if he had made it I'd have been asking him to marry ME! It really is that good. One thing I found with this recipe was that I could only fit ONE lemon in the chicken cavity. Also while the introduction talks about herb- infused juices there are no herb recommendations. So I sprinkled the chicken with some poultry seasoning and it worked great. I also only used a teaspoon of Fleur de Sel instead of the "tablespoon sea salt". At first the lemon juice started to caramalize but after about 1 1/2 hours there were enough juices for a sauce. I cooked a four- pound chicken for two hours and it was perfect. Now I can't wait to try other recipes from the cookbook. Also I served the chicken with fettucine alfredo and corn.

The name did make me cringe, but this is a great recipe. We add baby carrots, red potatoes, those little gem potatoes or brussel sprouts to the broth when there are are 15-20 mins left and you get great lemony potatoes or veggies. We've made this several times. It works great in the Le Creuset. My husband likes to use the left overs for tacos.

What is this, the 1950s?! Of the '100 recipes every woman should know', this is not one. I somehow, deep inside, hope that the name of the book and recipe are really tongue-in-cheek-retro-revival because I-want-to-be-a-Stepford-Wife-for-Halloween. But seriously folks, put the damn "fresh herb garnish" in the chicken before you shove it in the oven, it's of much better use there. Forget about the rotating thing, it's pointless and will only make a mess. Pour some white wine over the bird, and have a glass for yourself. Ask your partner to watch the dumb thing while you read a good book. Or even better, just make this recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Julias-Roast-Chicken-with-Lemon-and-Herbs-102264 at least reading it will make you feel like an emancipated member of the 21st century.

Delicious and moist, easy to make. Husband loved it. Would need guidance on what to do with leftovers.

I have made this dish 3 times now. My family (especially my fiance) LOVES this recipe! The only thing left after dinner is the carcass. The meat is always juicy and tender and it's so simple even the novice can nail it. I serve it with garlic mash potatoes and a green veggie, such as asparagus, broccoli, or brussel sprouts.

This is one of our household favorites. The lemons really infuse the chicken, giving it a nice, tangy flavor, and the engagement sauce is rich and delicious. This could not be easier to make...LOVE IT!

This is an awesome recipe. I turned it every 15 minutes as suggested on another site. I've never craved chicken before, but this definitely hits the spot. Will make it again!

I had to make this recipe even though I've been married for ten years. The story got me plus I thought the lemon juice would do something magical to 'crisp' the skin while cooking. But I have to be honest, this was my worst experience with roasting chicken. I had to add liquid (I used wine and stock) to the bottom of the pan because it dried out right away and started to smoke. The resulting 'gravy' was bitter and weird tasting, though this probably could've been fixed with stirring in some butter at the end. And the skin never did become crispy even after I cranked it to broil for the last ten minutes of cooking. Oh well - back to my standby recipe. Still like the story though!

Sounds good. It's also known as "Chicken With Two Lemons," a Marcella Hazan recipe.

Sounds fabulous... but huge-typo! : "and the trick of turning the chicken 15 minutes into cooking keeps the meet uniquely moist" ...Come on Epicurious, and for that matter Glamour. You're writing for a food-publication. MEAT not MEET! Wow.
