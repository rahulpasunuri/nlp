Just made this. Yes, it was easy. It did not blow me away, although other dinner guests used the "delicious." I made two additons. First, I added freshly chopped parsley when I mixed the seafood into the couscous, and it definitely added some fresh zing. But, I also wanted to up the protein factor and decrease the high carb ratio, so I added about a cup of backfin crabmeat. I only gave it two forks because it was good, but not great. It needed a little more "something" to be great.

This recipe was a treat for Christmas Eve. I made the filling a day ahead of time to allow to cool(and me not to be harried). This would be great on a buffet. Suggest making mayo ahead and doubling the recipie if you are serving buffet or family style, just for presentations sake.

This is really fantastic. It's fairly easy to make, tastes wonderful, and looks really good, too. Whenever I work with phyllo though, instead of melted butter, I use one of those misto olive oil sprays - it's so much easier.
