Agree with the cook from NY to use the recipe just as a sauce. I made the pudding and don't believe it is worth the effort. But the cranberry-dried fruit mixture can standalone as a Thanksgiving side dish without modification. Nicely tart and sweet, with a good chunky texture.

A favorite holiday dessert. Refreshing and makes a beautiful presentation unmolded and decorated with cream. People always intrigued by it.

I used this recipe (sans the bread) as cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving. It was GREAT! Complex, tart, and just a bit sweet. I also cut back the sugar to a couple of tablespoons, and the liquid to about half (the dried apricots and cherries produce enough sweetness). Try it!
