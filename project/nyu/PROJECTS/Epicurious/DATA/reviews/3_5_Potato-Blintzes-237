Great recipe I put it in the freezer over night much easier to fry.

The filling was great, but I could not find egg roll wraps in the grocery stores by me. So I had to use phyllo dough. I cut it a bit smaller and had to cook it longer. It actually tasted just fine. I will definetly try the recipe the correct way when I track down those wraps.

These were really yummy and easy. The only problem I had was that I made them in advance, up to the frying part. When I wanted to fry them, the egg roll wrappers were stuck to the plate!! I guess you should put wax paper on the plate or something to prevent this. Also, it's better to cook the onions at a lower heat...mine burned when I followed the directions. Thought I'd pass along the tip.

Yummy! My family loved these. I cheated on the low-fat part and added 1/4 cup cream cheese to the potato filling, and it was SO good! A must try!!

My family loved this receipe. I used 2% milk beause I don't keep whole milk, and it turned out fine. I especially liked using the egg roll wrappers-easy. I don't know if they freeze well, because the the leftovers were eaten the next day! They already want them again!
