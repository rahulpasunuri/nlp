This is a great recipe for two and very fast. Had one cornish hen in the freezer and defrosted it cold water. Did not have the have in stock anything for the suggested sides so made orzo in a manner similar to rissoto and added fresh sliced sauted mushrooms and sweet onions. Stirred in a few frozen green peas for color.

Turned this into a marinade with blood orange juice/peel, honey, and several other Moroccan spices. Very tasty, but watch when grilling with a honey-based sauce that the birds don't burn.

I used chicken breasts and added a little oil to make a paste. It was very good with a cilantro-yogurt sauce served over couscous.

WOW...I am not a curry fan at all, nor was one of the guests that I served this to, but we both thought it was amazing!! My husband, the curry guy, begs for this one over and over. It's a keeper!

This is a wonderful dish. I've used the spice rub on chicken, as well, then cook on a gas grill. Very easy outdoor cooking recipe with great results. Goes great with grilled veggie kabobs and a robust red wine

This was just ok. Squeezed some fresh lime over the quarters which helped.

My sweetie made this one Saturday and when I came back to the house after running errands I was blown away by the delicious aroma. This is a fantastic dish especially when accompanied by a cranberry cous cous. Have made this for company and it's well received.

I'm not usually a curry fan, but this was great! I doubled the rub recipe since I was making 2 hens, and baked them in the oven at 425 until they were done - but next time I think I'll make twice again the rub - I only had enough for a nice layer on the breasts, and it was SOOO good, I'd like a nice layer on the whole bird. Easy & delicious!

My hubbie raved and devoured almost an entire cornish hen. I am making four cornish hens for a group of friends today on the outdoor rotisserie. I have a feeling it will "rock." Other than experimenting with cooking techniques, I won't be changing a thing!

This is a household favorite. It smells so good while you're making it and then the flavor is just spectacular! The spice mixture works just as well with chicken breasts (bone in -- probably boneless too!). It's a great weeknight meal because it's quick. I usually serve it with couscous -- I use the Middle East Garlic flavored, and add a little curry seasoning. Add some grilled zucchini or some broccoli and you've got a perfect meal. Love it!

Made this in oven rather than BBQ and was wonderful. Cut the hens length-wise also. Big hit with cous cous! Easy and different dish for company.

It is great even with the skin off.

My husband and I love this recipe. It is quick and easy to make. I add some couscous and a salad we have a great summer meal.
