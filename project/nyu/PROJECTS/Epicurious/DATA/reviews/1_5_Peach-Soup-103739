This is a silly waste of time. Fruit soups should be cold and smooth. Drop the fruit and sherbert or ice cream into a blender and sweeten maple syrup or honey if necessary. Add slivered almonds and a sprig of mint as a garnish.

Way too difficult and for what? Blend some peaches with melon or mango or blueberries, add a little white wine, some lime juice. Sweeten if you want to with honey and taste. Change and taste again. Fruit soups are the easiest thing in the world to make when you let the fruit flavor come through.

Peach tea is tea that has peach flavoring added to it. Stash makes a very good version. Look for it in your well-stocked coffee shops or supermarkets.
