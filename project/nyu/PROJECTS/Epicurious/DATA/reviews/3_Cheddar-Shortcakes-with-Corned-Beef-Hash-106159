Had this for breakfast last weekend, and enjoyed the parts separately, but wondered about including them together. Hash AND biscuits? Seemed like a lot of starch. I wanted the hash (which was delicious) with fried eggs and the tomatillo salsa on top, and I loved that. The shortcakes were good on their own, although a bit on the salty side. They were lovely with a sliced tomato on top. Made a sandwich out of leftovers with tomato, lettuce and more melted cheese for lunch the next day. Yum!

I found this receipe was just okay. I used light old cheddar and found the biscuits had NO flavor. Maybe a regular cheese would have worked better, but I've made better cheese biscuits then this before, with low fat cheese. I also added an egg on top of the hash and served with ketchup.

The biscuits are just great. You can do them entirely in the FP. Whizz the dry ingredients together. Then pulse in the butter, likewise the shredded cheddar. Pour in the Sour Cream and water mix through the tube. Please, please, pulse lightly and don't over mix. I put buscuit patties on a parchment lined sheet to bake. . Hubby looked in the oven, and said something like OMG, they are huge. Next time I might make 8 or 12 from the same recipe. . For the hash, I stuck with the measurements, and used up the corned beef from 3/17. Split the biscuits, top with the hash. Garnish with poached eggs. So tasty we even forgot to use our favorite ketchup!

Made this for a southwest themed dinner last night and we all loved it. The shortcakes are huge, but delicious. Next time I am leaving the potatoes out of the hash because my only complaint would be that the dinner felt a bit starchy. The tomatillo salsa really adds to the dish. I pulsed it in the processor a few times to get a better consistency and added way more lime as others have indicated. Accompanied by a simple green salad with avocado, this was a great dinner.

To reviewer from Austin. Can you Read? Of course there's Corned Beef Listed in the ingredients. This was O.K. it's still hash.

This recipe was amazing. When the hash and the biscuits are fresh and hot, my husband and I cannot put them down. The biscuits were moist, but firm enough to hold the hash. The hash was light (for what it is) and the best I have ever had.

I find the shortcakes a little heavy, but my finace loves them so I continue to make them. The hash is great especially if you finish it under the broiler.

I made this a while back for a brunch with friends. As I recall I followed the recipe pretty closely and we all thought it was great. This should get a better review than is posted.

I, too, only made the hash accompanied by poached eggs. This has is really delicious. The change that I made was to use only 1 1/2 pounds of Yukon Gold potatoes. I also microwaved them with their peels and diced them when they were cool enough to handle. I left them unpeeled with no negative effect on the recipe. This recipe is really yummy!

So far I have only made the biscuits and I was amazed at the "dry and tasteless" comment; the second time I made them I made seven instead of six and used an extra-large baking sheet--they were a touch too moist inside the first time. I used the "nasty canned hash" and it was all quite tasty and well-received; I'll try the hash sometime.

I made the hash (without the salt called for--I thought the corned beef would be salty enough) and also made the biscuits. Thought it was quite good. It is still, however, hash. So I wouldn't hold it to highbrow gourmet standards. The recipe was just what I was looking for to use up leftover corned beef. Perfect with the homemade biscuits.

The biscuits were dry and tasteless and so was the corned beef hash. The corned beef by itself was very good.

This was a really good recipe. I didn't make the shortcake to go with it I just served it with eggs. After making this I will never be able to eat the canned stuff again. Oh and if you happen to use salted butter you won't need to add any salt to it.

What were you going to do, put a whole corned beef in the hash? Of course you slice it (Unless you're trying for the nasty canned stuff, then you dice finely or grind it up)

Yes the recipe does list the corned beef....although why it is sliced is beyond me: "1 lb (1/8-inch-thick) slices cooked corned beef, cut crosswise into 1/8-inch-wide strips".

Recipe does not list corned beef in the ingredients.
