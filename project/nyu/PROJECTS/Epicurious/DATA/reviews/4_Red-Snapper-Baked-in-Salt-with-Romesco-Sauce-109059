I have made this romesco sauce a few times, and have sometimes altered it by adding hazelnuts instead of almonds, and smoked paprika instead of plain. Although I LOVE garlic, I find that 3 cloves is actually quite a lot when raw and usually only use one. I haven't served it with whole snapper baked in salt, but can't wait to try!

This was great! Romesco was delicious and the fish cooked perfectly in the salt. Using that much salt was definitely intimidating (and seemed wasteful) but the end result was great. The fish was a bit salty in certain places and I would recommend brushing as much salt as possible off the fish before deboning.

Wow. I've tried some of the finest romescos in Newark's Ironbound district (if you know what that means, you know what good Spanish food is) and this recipe competes with them. If that's not evidence of the excellence, try this: it's my first time putting a review on Epicurious and that's how good it is...

Always wanted to try romesco sauce. Did, not impressed. Will say that I did not try the snapper baked in the salt. Used snapper though

altered the fish recipe too much to really review it, but the romesco sauce was fabulous

I only made the sauce but it was exceptional. Blend for a few minutes to make sure the mixture isn't at all chunky or grainy. Served over steamed salmon and it was easy and delicious.

I have made this 3 times now, each time to raves. The first time, my mother pleaded that I not ruin the beautiful snapper with all that salt. She was duly impressed that fish was so moist and perfectly seasoned. It is incredibly simple. I just add some sliced lemon and rosemary to the cavity. Biggest challenge is to debonely quickly enough to enjoy the hot fish.

Perfection. I would not change a thing.

I have made this twice now (in part to use up the leftover sauce) and it is just delicious. I have this served in restaurants but never made it myself - mainly because finding whole fish is a rarity in rural New Hampshire. For those intimidated by the amount of salt, I made it with a 1-pound red snapper and only needed about 3/4 lb. of salt. I did follow the same temperature and time recommendations and found the fish to be superbly moist nad flavorful. Finally, this is by all means the best recipe for Romesco sauce that I have ever found.

We failed to read ahead and see that we would need 3 pounds of salt, so just baked the fish with olive oil and a sprinkling of coarse salt. But the Romesco sauce was fantastic! It tasted wonderful with the fish and over the accompanying couscous.

This was hands-down one of my favorite recipies of the year. I made it for Christmas dinner and it was, according to my mother, "spectacular". The sauce takes some time, but is absolutely worth it. Pouring the salt on the fish is a bit terrifying (it forms a mountain!) -- but it is offset by the wow factor of breaking the crust (show your guests) and the delicious, un-salty taste (One warning: the areas around the gills were salty.) I served it on a platter with the romesco sauce all around.
