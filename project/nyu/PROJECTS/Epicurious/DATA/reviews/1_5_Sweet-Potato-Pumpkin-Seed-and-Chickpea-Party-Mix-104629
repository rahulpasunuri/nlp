Haven't tried it yet, but if I were, I'd do one of two things. 1) I'd make it Hummus style and make a chip dip out of it (a little olive oil, cinnamon, blend until creamy-ish). 2) Blend the ingredients and something spicy into a damp paste, fry them in little balls and serve that way.

After one hour of work (not counting the time spent searching for the pumpkin seeds), I ended up with a greasy kitchen and a mediocre party mix. On a positive note, the mix serves much more than two people!
