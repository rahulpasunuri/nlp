I live in New England, and I don't like spicy food very much. So I decided not to put in the canned chilies or jalepeño, but I did add half a lime. It makes a LOT of guacamole, so I halved the recipe which makes just enough for 5 or so people. Overall it was a pretty good recipe.

Where's the citrus? And canned chiles? Good grief. A good start, but needs help. Added lemon & lime, garlic, coarse sea salt, and some roasted fresh chiles.

This is AMAZING...so delicious! I didn't have any cilantro however (probably made a huge difference). I added another half an onion and some lemon juice which gave it a nice tang. I would totally make this again. Quick, easy and very, very yummy!

I liked this recipe, but if you don't like spicy guacamole I suggest not using chilies or jalepenos. I liked using red onion the best.

After reading the reviews, I decided to add a few things. Whole jalepeno, jalepeno juice along with 2 tsp minced garlic and juice of one lime. Turned out great.

The 63% approval rating is deceiving. It indicates whether or not you would make THIS recipe again. If you change it by adding red onions, fresh chilies, garlic, etc., it will no doubt produce delcious guacamole. But this recipe would not have been used. That said, the recipe as stated makes very substandard guacamole. Canned chilies? Why on earth? Fresh are as easy to find and taste a thousand times better. Next they'll be telling us to use bottled lemon juice.

Liked the basics. No canned chilies - used Serranos. Added more onions and also garlic powder. I also topped it with grated Asiago cheese. Wonderful!

Guacamole is rarely terrible, but having said that this recipe was not inspiring. My friends liked it but I thought it was just lacking that special something that would have really made it a treat. I would eat it if served to me, but wouldn't bother to make again.

I really liked this one! Used red onions for color, and used fresh (not canned) chiles. Love the fresh cilantro addition to traditional a guac. Added garlic too.

add 1/4 cup mayonaisse and 2 teaspoons black pepper and this recipe is the best quacamole I have ever had

solid recipe -- could use a bit more fire power from jalapenos

I like the guacamole recipe with charred tomatillos better but this was good. I increased the amount of tomatoes, onions and used a large jalpeno. It needed a little more flavor and I will definitely add fresh lime juice next time.

I made this recipe with two improvements...no canned green chilies (ugh) added additional japs and three cloves minced garlic. Heaven!

Easy and tasty guacamole. It is a little spicier and has more flavor than most. I completely agree with adding salt and lime juice (not too much, just a touch to make it perfect). As with anything made of avocados, it doesn't keep for too long.

I personally could eat guac made with nothing but avocados, salt, and lime juice. I made a variation of this recipe that came out well though - using chipotle instead of jalapeno, roma tomatoes, and adding salt, lime juice, and cumin - tasty! And organic avocados are a must!

This is a TRUE mexican guacamole. I have been making this dish for about 1 year now and it is always a hit. If you like a little spice, its a nice edge with a little more chille peppers. Minus the Jalepeno

I've made this one many times and it is always a hit. I've found that adding a whole jalapeno gives this recipe the bite it needs. Equally important is adding the salt and pepper which sounds like an afterthought but brings things together.

This is the perfect recipe for fresh, authentic guacamole. It was the perfect addition to beef and chicken fajitas. I will be making this again soon!

This has all the right ingredients except two VERY important ones and one optional one. First....you MUST add salt. Avocado sucks without salt to bring out the flavor (unless you get the real Mexican ones in which case you are a lucky son-of-a-gun). Second you must add lime juice. There's just something about avocado and lime. Third optional ingredient is either oregano (tiny bit) or ground cumin (tiny bit). Add those three to this recipe and you have a winner. Without them, this is flavorless.

We thought this was bland, even with the maximum amount of jalapenos.
