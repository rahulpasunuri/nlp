Made this for a casual week night dinner, my husband loved it! Tons of flavor in the tomoatoes and shallots, and the dressing was fantastic. Quick and easy and yummy! Making it for dinner with my parents tonight!

This dish met with unending compliments from my girlfriend and my parents too..I just grilled, to medium rare, three packaged 1/2 lb. top sirloin steaks because they were on sale at the local grocers..I generously seasoned them with Montreal's steak seasoning and afterwards let them rest on a covered plate for 20mins before slicing them on a thin bias..the steaks with juices turned out scrumptious..For the tomatoes I seasoned them with salt/pepper and spread them with a smashed clove of garlic to each half and topped them with several rings of shallots and pourings of olive oil and set them in the oven at 400..I accidentally overcooked them until they turned a bit mushy and soft, so I ended up scooping out most of the flesh and just used the incredibly sweetened rind much like when roasting red bell peppers...I bought a whole loaf of sourdough and swabbed the slices with this saved-for-a-special-occasion tuscan herb avocado oil (www.pacificaculinaria.com) and toasted the oiled slices on the grill..It's well worth the indulgence and effort to get some gourmet-flavored olive oil to make this a memorable banquet..Also I made the herb mixture first with the rice vinegar and sugar to allow the flavors to meld...Again a keeper recipe...Bon appetit.

This was a very tasty recipe. Pretty easy to make. The smell while I was roasting the tomatoes...was wonderful. Next time I'll use hardier bread to hold up to the scrumptious juices and my meat was a bit on the tough side. I don't know if it was the rib-eye steak cut or just the pieces of meat that I got. I do think that I only cooked it at 450 - 500 just scares me. I also had a lot of the roasted tomatoes left over because I didn't make as many sandwiches and it's great on other sandwiches.

The flavours and tastes of this recipe were wonderful. However, I would make a couple of small changes when making in the future. The oven temp was too high, I'd reduce that down; I'd cut the shallots thicker, as when finely sliced a lot blackened in the oven. I cut the bread very thickly as other users have suggested, however, whilst I love the idea from a flavour perspective, I'm not sure I'd baste the bread with the tomato oil before toasting, as it tended to be more tomato juice as opposed to oil, which meant it didn't crisp up and stayed quite soggy when I tried to toast them on the cast-iron griddle pan. Therefore I ended up chucking them in the oven to toast, so they were still crispy.

I loved this sandwich and the raves that came from the 9 people I served them to were glowing. I was nervous that I would not have enough of the herb spread for the whole group so I made aioli from Alice Water's "Art of Simple Food" book. I spread aioli on one slice and the herb sauce on the other. Insane. Can't wait to serve this again.

Truly a delicious receipe.The different blends of flavors are incredible. I have one question though. Is the oven temperature to be 500 degrees? I had a horrible mess within a few minutes. Oil spattered everywhere inside my oven and a smoke filled kitchen. Next time I will definitely lower the temperature.

This recipe Rocks! The flavor is incredible from the roasted tomatoes to the mint-cilantro sauce your mouth is sure to be pleased. I had not read the review before I made it and my bread was too thin and therefore soggy, but still delicious. I wonder what it would be like using Roma tomatoes?

If you don't utter expletives while eating this sandwich, you've lost your sense of taste. Might want to lay off licking that 40 grit sandpaper for awhile. I know what you're thinking. Ribeye and tomato, so what? Cannot be that good. Well even the person who wrote about it in Gourmet talked about being un-enthused about trying it but did so only because of the raving of her fellow staff members. She was grateful for their recommendation. The fabrication of this sandwhich results in its tremendous flavors staggering around your pallet like drunken octave of notes both individually and in chords. Sometimes its the tang of the rice wine vinegar and sourdough paired with the sweetness of the roasted tomato, other times its the savoryness of the slightly carmelized shallots interjecting in the conversation those tomatoes are having with the beef. All this crazy stuff is going on in every bite! My advice, other than to make this as soon as possible, is to sear those ribeyes quick and HOT so they don't dry out. Don't trim the fat of these guys either. If you're grill is hot enough, most of it will melt off. The smell of the tomatoes and shallots roasting is enough to drive a man wild.

I made this for my fiance and he absolutely loved it. Not your typical steak sandwich.It has so many different flavors.I will continue to make this for my family...

These were so good. But def. make sure your bread is thick, because it very juicy! My husband does not care for tomatoes, but gobbled these up and said they were perfect on the sandwich. He suggests that the steak not be cut into strips to make the sandwich more managable and not so messy.

Really surprised at the lack of reviews for this recipe. We loved it and have made it 3 times (as written) already. My tomatoes fall apart after 25 mins, but I let them continue on to get a great concentration of flavor. The herb infused vinegar/sugar combo lent such a crisp and interesting twist. I love, love the sweet & sour hit it delivers! Make sure your bread is cut thick so it'll hold up. Man was this ever tasty!

This sandwich has been voted a family keeper by my teenage sons and my husband. The roasted tomato provides serious flavour to the sandwich (not comparable to a fresh slice of tomato) as does the mint-cilantro sauce. Roasted chicken is as tasty as the beef (we offer both) and a selection of breads just adds to the fun. This recipe really rates 3-1/2 forks.
