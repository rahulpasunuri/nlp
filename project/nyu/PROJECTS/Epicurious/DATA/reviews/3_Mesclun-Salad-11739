It's kind of bland - definitely needs the items the other reviewer talked about. But simple and healthy!

This is a recipe I have been using for a few years. I add Balsimic Vinager instead of the sherry vinager. I'll also add some rings of red onion, tomatoes, shredded carrot. Whatever you feel like doing. I sometimes add a little sugar into the Olive Oil and Balsimic Vinager. It softens it a little bit. Pepper and a little salt is nice too. PS: To make the salad go further I'll add some torn Romaine Lettuce - Mesclun is great but $$!
