I printed this recipe out in Nov 2000 for a dish I wanted to include in a Thanksgiving menu for my restaurant. It is now 2012 and I still make it several times a year because it is absolutely wonderful. It does get much much more flavorful as it sits. The juice just gets better and better each day. I add 1-16oz can of whole cranberry sauce to add more flavor and bind the sauce together better. It makes a wonderful lite dish for the warm summer months because you serve it chilled. Makes my mouth water just thinking about this.

I've made this dish three years in a row for Thanksgiving potlucks at work. It's delicious. We take the leftovers the next day, warm the compote, and serve it over vanilla bean ice cream.

This is a definite "make a day ahead" recipe. When I tasted it the day it was made, I thought the cranberry taste was lost (I like tart). One the second day, it was more balanced with good sweet-tart flavor. Leftovers are great on french toast -- and there will be plenty leftover unless this is your main dish! I don't know how the editors decided this was for ten servings because we had 12 at dinner and everyone ate some -- and I still had 1/3 left.
