I loved this easy, delicious dish. I think I undercooked my tuna a bit (I probably cooked it for about a minute and a half total, and my steaks were over 1 inch thick), but better undercooked than overcooked! The sauce was amazing; I'd make it and serve lots of different meats. I used sunflower oil instead of peanut oil as that was what I had on hand; it worked just fine. It was a bit salty; perhaps next time I'd use a little less soy sauce or perhaps the low sodium kind.

This sauce is divine, we've made it multiple times but if you get too liberal with the sauce ingredients it can get bad very quickly, so stick with the original at least the first time. That said, usually we have this with chicken and less cream. If your ahi is the best of the best I'd pass for a simpler preparation, ie..sashimi :).

Great recipe! I followed what some of the other reviews said and used coconut milk instead of cream because it seemed like a natural with ginger, soy and cilantro. Also since I'm trying to be low carb I added more mushrooms and skipped the coconut cilantro rice that many people suggested to serve with it. My modified recipe is on my blog Spoons to Sporks.

Good, but not as fabulous as I was expecting...easy to prepare for a weeknight meal, and I would make again though. Did not feel the sauce thickened enough in three minutes...needed longer.

I have made this recipe countless times and it is always a hit. Everyone I have served has taken the recipe home with them. Since my husband doesn't like tuna, I usually serve it over pork (chops or tenderloin). One of our favorites!

This is the second time I've reviewed this recipe because it is just that fantastic. I serve the sauce with just about any fish or chicken. I plan to try cutting the soy sauce and/or using low sodium next time because it is too salty. It freezes well also, so great to have in the freezer for a quick, impressive meal.

YUM! This is the best tuna recipe I have made and the cream sauce - amazing. If I didn't mind gaining ten pounds I would eat it as a soup. Sooooo good!

Rating: 4
Yum!!! Love, love, love this recipe! The sauce is awesome! The only big adjustment--it's a big one--is that I reduced the soy sauce to 1T. It's enough to deepen the taste of the sauce without adding too much sodium. I also grilled the tuna, 3 minutes each side on high, while the sauce was still cooking so that the tuna wasn't overdone. When I followed the directions exactly for cooking the tuna, it was overdone. I used sushi-grade tuna. Enjoy!

So so good. When you are cooking for people you care about, make them this. It is deceptively easy. The work:deliciousness ratio is very very much in your favor. We usually have bok choy and Trader Joe's frozen basmati rice with it, and voila...a real deal dinner. The rice is great to take advantage of the sauce which otherwise you may be tempted to drink with a straw.

I've had my eye on this recpe for years and avoided making it b/c of the fat calorie load. Well decided to splurge w a sauce for my freshly caught striper. OMG, amazing. Reduced the soy sce to 3T and used one 3.5 oz pkg of shiitake. Made lots of sauce so used the rest the next night w some shredded cooked chicken over rice. I STILL have not gotten over how good that sauce is.

Reviews don't lie. This is easy and spectacularly savory.

This is an absolute staple in my recipe box. The sauce is so flavorful and simple and would be great on steak or chicken as well. Made this last night for a dinner party and paired it with the Cilantro Coconut Rice (another Epi Recipe) and some sauteed garlic green beans. Everyone went bananas for it. Next time I will try a low-cal route and use less butter and no cream and see how it turns out. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
That was the best dinner we have ever made. We used 3/4 of can of thai organic light coconut milk instead of cream. So we simmer sauce a little longer then 3 min: 6-7 min to prepare coconut better. I would suggest to sear tuna after all to save it's inside juice. We pared tuna with Cauliflower Purée (look it up on Epicurious | © 2005 by Ted Allen). we just added curry powder, parmesan and coconut milk instead of cooking liquid. That was amazing. I will definitely do it again. Easy. Quick. Healthy. Light. Creative. Lovely. Like $60 restaurant entree.

Rating: 4
Delicious and easy - great combination! I made as written, except followed others' advice and reduced soy sauce to about half as written. It was perfect. And I learned something new - soy sauce adds that subtle umami without really adding flavor - similar to the affect of fish sauce. Gives a sauce that elusive depth. Served it with squid ink pasta and frenched beans last night for dinner party. Delicious with Champagne.

Rating: 4
This is my go to special event recipe because I try not to eat much dairy. I follow it to the 't' except for the soy sauce reduction and since it's a special 'O' I buy the best tuna from Whole Foods. It never fails to get raves and if there's any sauce left over I put it over pasta the next night with a chicken breast.

This was so good I think I might have cried a little after I was done eating...grilled some halibut and used the sauce with some stamed rice and veggies. Do not wait another day to make this recipe.

Rating: 4
This is a very, very tasty dish. I took others suggestions of making a side dish that would soak up the sauce (smashed fingerlings)because it is so yummy! I only put 4 T of mushroom soy instead of 6T and it tasted great. It really seems to need all the components to balance it properly. The one thing I had to substitute was the mushrooms--I used portabello's becasue I couldn't get shiitakes.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent recipe! The first time I made it, I took other reviewers' suggestions and reduced the amount of soy sauce. My boyfriend raved about the dish and stated it was in his "top 5". Tonight I went by the written recipe (had printed it out previously without noting changes) and definitely tasted the increased amount of soy sauce. Much better reduced to 3-4T. But definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
Since I am not a seafood fan, I have made this sauce a couple of times substituting sesame chicken, with excellent results. Shortly before Thanksgiving, however, I was wandering through the supermarket when I was possessed with a truly perverse idea. Passing a large display of french fried onion rings, of the type used to top "classic" green bean casseroles, I had a thought. What if I subbed Ginger Shiitake Cream Sauce for the Cream of Mushroom soup, and used fresh, lightly pan seared green beans? I did this, topping everything with those dastardly onion rings, and it was pretty mind-blowing. It was also the first dish killed when I let people pack up leftovers. And I realize some folks will feel this's a debasement of a truly superb recipe, but what the heck? It tasted great!

Followed the recipe to the letter (replaced the tuna with salmon and did 3 tablespoons of soy sauce), it was delicious! Served with soba noodles.

Rating: 4
Wow - this was fantastic. Prepared for my husband and me last night. Like other reviewers I cut the soy sauce down (to 4 Tbs), and I also pressed sesame seeds into steaks before searing. Added 1/2 tsp of raw sugar to sauce (it needed a little bit of sweetness to balance it), and next time may try cutting cream in half and making up the difference with coconut milk. Served over Soba Noodles w/Vegetables, Crispy Tofu & Toasted Sesame seeds (minus the Tofu - recipe on Epicurious), and it was a PERFECT pairing. Sauce soaked into the soba noodles, and presentation was really pretty. Will make again for company.

I will join the other reviewers to say we loved this delicious recipe. Served with mashed cauliflower - a good pairing.

Rating: 4
OMG!!! This is better than unicorn loin with golden egg béarnaise. I wish that I could give it 5 forks. I didnt want to risk drying out the tuna in the oven, so I started the sauce first in a separate pan. After adding the soy sauce, I started the tuna, finishing them both at the same time. Next time Ill press sesame seeds into the fish with the pepper, and maybe try coconut milk with the cream. Shallots can be substituted for the green onions. Be sure to use peanut oil, with its high smoke point, rather than olive oil (oops!). This sauce would be excellent over shrimp, pork chops, chicken, or steak. Serve with mashed potatoes or rice, as a foil for the luscious sauce.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe. As others have, I usually start out with 3 T soy sauce and work up from there. I've also used different fish or meat along with the sauce, all successfully. My latest incarnation was shrimp tempura over the sauce with asparagus replacing the mushrooms, half a serrano added in with the garlic, and an avocado served alongside. Again, divine. Highly recommended as is or with your own ideas.

Just as good as others have said. Delicious! Next time I would add a little salt to the tuna steaks before searing.

I hate to dissent from the satisfied pack, but even with low sodium soy sauce this ended up being much too salty - the subtleties of the mushrooms and cilantro were both totally lost in the big hitting lime and soy with only the ginger and garlic keeping this from being a total mess. If I were to remake again, I would cut the already low-sodium soy sauce down even further.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Next time I'll use low sodium soy sauce.

I'm sure I've reviewed this before, but I have now concluded that this is the BEST DISH EVER on Epicurious. Here is why. First, ingredients are king. This mixture of flavours is unbelievably, undeniably awesome. From the soya sauce being held back by the cream, to the ginger being absorbed by the cilantro, this is a diabolically genius combination of flavours. Second, it is really quite easy. It's largely a one-pan dish, and you don't need to start in earnest until only a few minutes before dinner is served. That is great for entertaining. Third, it never fails. NEVER. Always awesome, and I've made it a bunch of times. Make this dish. Love this dish. Tell your friends of this dish.

This is one of my all time favorite recipes for tuna (that is not sashimi grade). I use Albacore. A low sodium soy sauce will take the worry out of it being too salty. Also, add the lime, a little at a time, to taste. I think it is a nice contrast to the other flavors, so would not make this dish without it. I have made it many times and always to rave reviews.

Very good, I was scared to add the lime because of other reviews but it was perfect. Also very quick!

Rating: 3
Any sauce with mushrooms, garlic, and over a cup of cream is bound to taste good, but the flavor of soy sauce in this was close to overpowering. The lime juice is absolutely necessary to tame the soy sauce. I doubt that I'll make it again, but I recommend that others interested in making this, start with 4 T of soy sauce and work up from there.

I changed a couple of things with the tuna by pressing black and white sesame seeds into it before searing and by reducing the cook time to a minute per side. Both changes worked well. But it was the sauce that made this dish. I can't exaggerate how much I loved it and will make it often.

Loved IT! and with less than 10 minutes of prep and cook time, you just can't go wrong! OH - I admit that I cheated as I used: 1. Lowered the Number of Tuna Steaks to 2 only (one for each person eating); 2. Substituted Ingredients:jarred ginger - prechopped, jarred sharllots - prechopped - in lieu of sliced green onions, dry cilantro (I'm not a big cilantro users and the dried meant less strong than the fresh). 3. What Shitake Mushrooms I had on hand, in a small pack of plastic wrapped mushrooms. I would highly recommend this Recipe. I added a great accompanyment the meal just by adding steamed fresh asparagus - with a cook time that didn't even effect total prep. cook time of less than 10 minutes. I am definitely making this one again, soon!! GREAT FOR THE FOLLOWING: 1. Busy Moms that want an easy 'fancy' dinner for a spous/partner. 2. Great for a Picnic, just store the sauce in a plastic container; place cooked tuna steaks in an aluminum foil wrap to keep them warm and set in still sealed outside iin the sun to warm to outside temp. prior to serving. Keep asparagus in seperate container until time of use, either in a cooler for cooling asparagus or the sun in their asparagus container to bring to outside temperatures. Don't forget your plates and utensils and napkins ...and you're all set. Last Tip: Don't forget your drinks: I recommennd a white Viva La Poission!!

Delicious recipe, extremely easy. I followed suggestions of a few others & wished I hadn't. First of all, DO NOT use fat-free half & half. The consisency does not set in the sauce & if you're spending so much on the other ingredients, it's not worth saving the calories, especially for entertaining. Secondly, it's not necessary to double the sauce. Had way too much sauce left over; plus, the tuna sat in the oven longer (next time I won't put it in the oven at all) b/c I doubled the sauce & b/c I was waiting for the sauce to coat the spoon- which it never did b/c of the half & half. Finally, I'll use low sodium soy sauce next time as it was the predominant taste in the sauce. All that having been said, it was still delicious.

Rating: 4
Oh my gosh... awesome. The sauce alone was fabulous and could be served over pasta. A definite keeper!

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! Only change I made was to substitute low fat half and half for the heavy cream and the sauce was still rich and coated the fish perfectly. Next time, for company, I will make the sauce ahead, except for the lime juice, and then reheat it and add the lime juice just before serving.

This sauce is amazing. I've made it a few times with the tuna but tonight used seared scallops & cooked shrimp IN the sauce which I'd doubled. I served it over angel hair & topped with asiago. I didn't use cilantro & used minced shallots as opposed to green onions. Not really fair to deviate so from the recipe & then review it but it was *seriously* good. It will definitely be used at the next dinner party.

Quick, easy and elegant. My only "tweak" to recipe as written is that I would recommend use of low-sodium soy sauce and would "play" with slicing of green onions (i.e., some minced, some sliced thin, some sliced larger). This is company-worthy fare and almost ridiculously easy to pull together.

I'll try to be original...I don't think I could be friends with someone who didn't like this sauce.

This is a restaurant quality recipe that's super easy to make. Hard to screw up.

Other reviewers suggested trying chicken with this recipe, so that's what I did! Here are my changes: -I substituted chicken breasts for the tuna, slicing them into 1/4" cutlets. I browned them for 30 seconds per side, then removed from pan and kept warm. -I substituted shallots for the green onions. -I only used an 8oz. container of heavy cream and it was fine. -After adding the heavy cream, I returned the chicken to the pan to finish cooking for the final 3 minutes, then added the fresh lime juice (which really makes this dish POP!!) -Serve with something that helps sop up the creamy sauce, like buttered noodles, rice, mashed potatoes, or a crusty bread. So, so, so, so good. Will DEFINITELY be making this again and again. Excellent.

I agree with kayboom from LA- could have eaten a bowl of the sauce with a spoon. Had never tried fresh tuna before and am a bit underwhlemed with the fish itself but can't wait to try the sauce on something else- plenty of suggestions here. Used the 1-min per side sear time posted here and it was nice an pink in the middle. Guess I just learned I am not a fan of tuna. Good but not great.

This was really really good. I think the lime juice is what makes this taste so much better than one would expect. I agree with the cook from Chicago that this might be a waste of good tuna -- probably better to use on a milder fish or chicken, maybe today's low flavor pork. I'll be trying those in the future.

FANTASTIC! Everyone loved this and it was extremely quick and easy. I've made it a few times, and tried using regular tuna steaks vs tuna loin steaks and there was a huge difference.

While this was quite good, and an interesting change from my usual peppered tuna steaks with some sort of sherry/soy sauce, I don't think it's a 4 forker. It comes out sort of like an Asian stroganoff, which isn't necessarily bad, but as many have said it is very rich and kind of overpowering. The sauce is tasty, but I think it's kind of a waste to use it on good tuna. I agree with the idea of making it for blander fish, or putting it on another type of meat altogether. I'll stick with light sauces for tuna and maybe make the sauce again to use on chicken instead.

I made this for my husband and we were so impressed that within two weeks we had company for dinner and made it again. It is very easy to whip together and tastes as good as any dish you'll get from a fine dining establishment. I used fresh yellow fin tuna, and actually the slices/steaks were closer to 2 inches thick. Go with the freshest ingredients you can get - the fresh ginger is a must, as are the shiitake mushrooms. This recipe will be one we will make time and time again.

The sauce is AMAZING!!! I could have eaten a bowl of it like soup! I doubled the amount of lime juice to brighten the flavor a bit. My one bad experience was with cooking the tuna--2 minutes each side resulted in overdone, tough fish, even though I used 1" thick tuna steaks as called for.

I make this pretty frequently and it is quite good (though not quite as amazing as the reviews would lead you to believe.) The sauce is very rich and flavorful, which tends to overpower tuna. I prefer using it to spice up blander/cheaper pieces of fish such as mahi. I usually replace the butter with 1tablespoon of olive oil and the whipping cream with half & half to cut down on calories/richness.

I reviewed this recipe several years ago and still come back to it often. It is our splurge meal (both on cost of very good quality ahi tuna and also on all the fat and calories!). I just made this again this past weekend. I think the next time I make it I will actually do the sauce first and sear the tuna last. Even in low heat in the oven the tuna cooked more than I wanted it to. For those who didn't have success with this recipe; make certain you have the highest quality ingredients (Whole Foods,etc.) . Shitake mushrooms are wonderful when they are fresh and they are unlike any other mushroom so you can't really substitute them. Also, the tuna should be just seared and not overcooked.

Rating: 4
One should realize that there is really very little sauce to go around if one serves six (as the recipe calls for). Indeed, watch the total sodium by using unsalted butter and low sodium soy sauce, but this is simply one of best recipes I've ever followed and I continue to come back to it over and over. The wasabi potatoes are a must as well.

Rating: 1
What a disappointment! I should have heeded the reviews of those 2 fork ratings, but decided to try it, since there were so many favorable inputs. I agree with other reviewers that the sauce is just too heavy. Not only that, the flavor just does not come together in a pleasing way. Many of the ingredients (in the recipe) are used for making a Chinese style steamed fish, and when whipping cream and lime are added to it, the "fusion" effect is not successful.

I was very disappointed with this recipe based all of the rave reviews. This sauce is very tasty, but much too rich for a piece of fish. At the price of quality tuna steaks, the last thing you want to do is cover it up with a strong, salty sauce. It would be better matched with chicken and do cut down on the amount of soy sauce in the recipe.

This is one of my favorite recipes and always impresses. The sauce is so, so great! The tuna was slightly over cooked when I made it because it continued to cook in the oven while I prepared the sauce, so next time I would stick very closely to the 2min on each side searing.

sauce is a little overpowering, but in all very tasty, my wife loves it, suggest readers use low sodium soy and unsalted butter, otherwise this dish will be way too salty...i think the sauce would also go very well with sauteed bacon wrapped scallops, will try it with the leftover sauce and let ya'all know if she tastes well...

this was outstanding. followed recipe exactly with one minor change.....doubled sauce recipe and made with 2/3 fat free half and half, 1/3 heavy whipping cream. got rave reviews from my special guests, and had enough sauce left over to use on some halibut the next day. made it with a garlic ginger coconut jasmine rice recipe i got by googling jasmine coconut rice. delicious!

The number of rave reviews for this recipe was extraordinary and I was looking forward to making this. 640 Epicurious readers can't be wrong, can they? There was the odd killjoy who didn't think it was so special. I'm afraid I have to join the killjoys who said this was good, but nothing special, because that's all it was. The tuna was nicely seared, but the sauce was... not special. It was okay, but didn't live up to the reviews that mentioned tears of joy, licking off cardboard, etc. It was a fairly ordinary cream sauce. I used all fresh ingredients that somehow didn't add up to the ambrosia described by reviewers.

Rating: 4
I thought there was no way this recipe could live up to the rave reviews on this site - but it does! The sauce is AMAZING. Would probably also be good with steak. It was a little on the salty side, though - and I love salt. I would recommend cutting down the soy sauce.

Rating: 4
Wow what an excellent entre. I thought I didn't like mushrooms until I made this dish. I followed the recipe nearly as is, though I cut all ingredients down by 1/3 and I salt and pepper'd both sides of the tuna before searing. Delish! I have made many seafood entres from this website and this one is the clear leader at this point in time.

This was very good. I would reduce the amount of soy next time, but this was still excellent. There were no leftovers.

Really delicious -- one of the best recipes I've made from Epicurious. I made a lot less (enough for two people) and so I quartered the ingredients but that worked out fine. Using shiitake mushrooms is key.

I made this for my husband and me - for myself I used a piece of tofu as I am vegetarian and tuna for him. I actually used coconut milk rather than the cream since the flavors seemed to cry out for something more "Asian" than cream. The sauce was much thinner than it would have been with cream but the flavor was delicious.

I have made this many times since I first found it on the site, always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I've used Ahi and yellowfin, depending on what looks best or available in the market. The fresh shiitake's are a must. Only change I make is to cut back on the soy sauce. The first time I made this with the first bite I exclaimed "This is so darn good if it was on top of my head my tongue would knock my brains out trying to get to it"!! Highly recommended!

Not bad, but not as good as the glowing reviews. We far prefer the African Adobo-Rubbed Tuna Steaks with Avocado Salsa also on this website. We served sesame noodles and sauteed spinach with the Ginger Shitake Sauce Tuna Steaks - the combination worked well.

I usually tinker with every recipe but the only change I made was to reduce the soy sauce. As a main entree I serve this with grilled ramps and fingerling potatoes in the spring. Other seasons I serve over jasmine rice with a side of french string beans. As an appetizer, I grind fennel/peppercorn to crust the edge of the tuna before searing and serve the sauce separately for the guests to dip. Always a hit.

Grilled chicken breast and poured the sauce over. Very good. I would cut back a little on the soy because it was salty.

Awesome, awesome, awesome! Took the advise of others and reduced the soy sauce so it wouldn't be too salty and it was perfect. Looking forward to trying it with chicken as one other reviewer suggested. -- tuna is a little to expensive to have for a weeknight meal and I think too many tuna sandwiches as a child has kind of turned me off the flavour of it....

First time reviewer... Fabulous sauce! Of course, I was skeptical of all the reviews.. kind of thought it was a 'jump on the bandwagon' thing. I cook regularly for a family I work for. They always compliment me on my cooking, but this is the first time they demanded a recipe! I would have to disagree with the comments that it made too much sauch. The mushrooms soak up a majority of the liquid, if prepared as directed. For a slight variation, I like spice, so I doubled the ginger and garlic, and increased the onions and cilantro slightly. I did decrease the soy.. Two T high quality soy, and two T soy lite... Perfect. Also, I used nonfat 1/2 & 1/2 just to cut some caloric corners. Still fabulous. Served with lime ginger wild rice and sauteed greens with a bit of garlic, a wee touch of ginger, and a splash of balsamic. Oh... and a super snap to make!!! Theres nothing better than a high class meal in no time at all. This is definitely going to be one of my favorites.. if not THEE favorite!

A really tasty dish and not too hard to make. I thought there could have been a little more sauce.Used vegetable oil instead and it tasted fine that way. My steaks cooked in a lot less time even though they were about 1 inch thick so if I made it again I'd reduce the cooking time.

Wow! Easy and delicious. The sauce is a keeper; as we licked up every morsel we discussed of all the sauteed/seared food it would complement: chicken, steaks, veal... The local store didn't have shiitakes, so we used chopped portabellas. It was so good, I'm not sure I'll even try it with shiitakes. I thought it was perfectly balanced; the amount of soy was great for us.

Okay, the tuna was sooo delicious. It was my first time cooking seared tuna. The recommended timing was perfect for my taste. The sauce was very salty and a little heavy. Maybe I left it on the fire too long. Next time I'm going to cut the soy sauce and add sake or something. I used the recommended amount of cilantro and couldn't taste it. I love cliantro with tuna so next time I'll be sure to add more and use it for a garnish. I also cooked some thin rice noodles and poured the sauce over them and placed the sliced tuna on top. It was pretty.

Rating: 4
This is such a straightforward and delicious recipe! I've found another way to decrease the sodium in the sauce which is to add several tablespoons (I added four) of sake. The sake imparts a bit of sweetness to it as well. This dish is excellent with simple sides such as (wasabi) mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach!

Rating: 4
This dish deserves the accolades. What a treat! I would agree with reviewers to use 5 tbsp. (or less) of low sodium soy, and use unsalted butter. Even with those changes, it's about as salty as anyone would want. No harm in remping up the ginger and garlic, either. Be careful to whom you serve this dish, because you won't be able to get rid of them!

This is one dish that makes me say "Wow - I'm really good at this cooking stuff!" I've made it several times. I use the amount of soy and don't find it overly salty at all. I don't measure the cilantro or green onions - I add a bunch of chopped cilantro and a bunch a chopped green onions, reserving extra for fresh garnish. I use a good chunk of grated ginger, and a good 4-6 cloves of chopped garlic. I want to try using fat-free half and half in the future, but as long as it is served without rice or potato, it's ok for a high-fat high-protein dish once in awhile. I served with sauted sugarsnap peas in sesame oil, squeeze of lime, and sesame seeds. I also use dried shitakes, squeezing out the extra water and giving them a good chop before sauteing. I've also tried this recipe on pork and chicken - it's a winner everytime, but it does pair best IMO with the lightly seared sushi-grade tuna.

I love the comments from Philly about the weeping that occurs after tasting the sauce, my sentiments exactly. And just like the comment from Breckonridge, this dish will absolutely impress. The only change I made was 1/2 soy sauce. I made this for a man I've been dating and after he tasted this he asked me to marry him. I said no of course, due to a fear of commitment, but I will commit to making this recipe again...so amazing.

I couldn't be more impressed with this recipe. The only change I made was cutting the soy sauce in half. I also went to my local butcher/fish market for a piece of ahi that was so fresh it was still wiggling! This melted in our mouths and I will absolutely make this again. When I do though, I will use fat-free 1/2 and 1/2 to cut the calories. So delish and comments were made around the table that it was better than restaurant quality!!! A must try, and a very EASY dish to prepare. I paired it with the lemon infused jasmine rice recipe and they went so well together!

We were looking for something a bit more interesting than Ham or Turkey for Easter dinner, and this recipe was absolutely fabulous. We read through almost all 600 reviews and have to agree that the gingered-shittake cream sauce was so good that it's darn near impossible to come up with an adequate superlative. And we used rehydrated dry shittakes because we couldn't find fresh ones. The sauce comes together real quickly, so cut up everything ahead of time. This recipe is a delicious fusion of traditional French and exotic Asian cooking, and it plates up very well, too.

This was really delicious. I used only a little soya sauce to taste as per other reviewers suggestion. And I used regular brown buttons. If anyone is looking for a lower-fat alternative, evaporated milk works great - don't be put off by the look of it - it thickens beautifully and gives you creamy satisfaction on a weeknight. Guests can have the real thing!

I made this sauce last night with seared scallops over udon noodles and loved it...as others have suggested I increased the ginger and garlic, reduced the soy to 3 tbsp, and used fat-free half and half. I also added a little red chili pepper and would definitely do this again, it adds a nice kick.

I have made this dish twice now and both times I have been extremely happy with the result. I excluded the shrooms, as my fiance and I are not fans, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. As a novice cook, but an expert critic, I found this recipe easy to make and delicious to eat. Leftover sauce is great with just about anything - steak - chicken - rice...

Rating: 4
This was truly an excellent dish and was well received by our company. As suggested by some reviewers, I made the sauce first in a separate pan and then seared the tuna for a little less time than called for in the recipe (about 1.5 minutes/side). We served the tuna with wasabi mashed potatoes and haricots verts with lemon brown butter (both from this site) which complemented the tuna well. We had quite a bit of sauce leftover which we had a few nights later over seared scallops with leftover mashed potatoes. From our pont of view, it was a great company dish to serve, which was especially important given that we had a guest who can't eat beef, pork or shellfish.

Rating: 4
The sauce is to die for, rich but the ginger gives it an Asian lightness and also extremely easy to make. I did not find it appropriate with the ahi as it overpowered the delicate fish. Both components are great recipes on their own. I will serve the sauce over beef with a scoop of sushi rice tonight.

My family was floored by this recipe. We love the blend of Southwest (cilantro, lime), oriental (soy ginger) and French (cream, mushrooms)in the sauce.

This is a fabulous dish! Very easy and and delicious. I just made this for a dinner party and got raves. Even though it is a cream sauce it is very light, and the combination of all the ingredients in the sauce marry well--the shitakis give a wonderful and distinctive flavor.

HOLY COW!!!!! What a fantastic dish and incredibly easy to make. My wife and I had planned to make this a couple of days ago for Friday night, but when we finally got around to dinner it just seemd like so much work.... Until we actually started making it, 15 minutes from start to finish, could have been faster if we weren't so tired. As we added each new element to the sauce our energy and excitement perked up higher. The payoff was everything the aromas implied it would be. We doubled the garlic, don't take that as an indictment though we almost always double the garlic. Our store doesn't carry fresh shitakes all the time so we used criminis, I believe that shitakes are the right way to go though, on the other hand if you use white mushrooms you won't be displeased. I think the others who used low sodium soy sauce were on to something the sauce was just a teeny bit salty, on the other hand if you don't salt the fish that makes it perfect and we did not salt the fish. Finally I believe since I am dieting, that I will try the same recipe with fat free half and half. I think the flavor profile would be very similar even with the loss of fat and of course the wonderful freshness that cream adds to a dish. An 8 oz. portion as the recipe is written works out to around 1000 calories so its calorie dense.

Rating: 4
This was great and the sauce was amazing and could be used with other fish and meat. I'll be making this again and again--even my husband who doesn't like the sauces on "fancy food" had extra of this. I used 3tbsps low sodium soy and 1 tbsp fish sauce -- next time I'd reduce the soy a bit more.

Great sauce. I used low-sodium soy and found it to be just perfect with the recipe amounts as written. I would caution on the searing times with the tuna. My steaks were a little over 1" thick and I only seared for 1 minute (maybe less) on each side and, after the in-oven time, found them to be just perfect.

Used olive oil spray instead of peanut oil. Used whipping cream, but it was very rich, so I think you could use a much smaller amount and thin it with extra lime juice.

We made the full amount of sauce with half the tuna for two people.

This sauce is superb! I tweeked the amounts to taste, and almost didn't add the lime juice(the sauce was so good as was), but I tried a drop on a spoonful and it was even better! I had to substitute tilapia for the tuna, but this sauce would be great on any seafood, chicken or pasta!

Served this to my (now) in-laws two days before the wedding, and completely won them over. Absolutely perfect. Used 4T soy sauce and thought that was just enough -- $$-wise, I also cheated with caught-that-day seared swordfish, but everything was divine nevertheless. BTW, if you're one of those folks who's really worried about salt in a recipe (and I can't really blame you) why not start really small with the soy sauce and add more later? It's not like you can't add a splash or two more if the occasion demands. But otherwise, well, the rest of us true chefs will just happily try a recipe *as written* before blindly badmouthing it.

After reading through ALL the reviews for this recipe yesterday, I had to try it and WOW, what a dish! I followed the recipe to the letter except for the cream.

I was very happy with this dish, and would make it again. I used only about 3 Tbs of soy sauce. Also, the amount of cream seemed inordinately high in the original recipe. I used about 1/5 cup of half and half, or it may have been a little less, and I was happy with the result. I also added some red and orange bell pepper, diced fairly small, when I added the mushrooms. Probably about a half a medium pepper total. The color helped with the presentation. Worked well, tasted and looked great. On the side I served wasabi smashed potatoes which I think went great and highly recommend. I served this with a German Hefe-weiss beer, which picked up the citrusy flavors from the cilantro and the lime juice, and went amazingly well. I think a Belgian witbier would also work beautifully because of the citrus and coriander notes.

To naughts from Philadelphia, why would you call other cooks on this site "Fools" for using the amount of soy sauce that the recipe calls for? Would you mind sharing your method of preparing the dish without being so rude? As for the recipe - very good, reminds me of a dish at a wonderful local Kansas City restaurant.

I love this recipe. I was a bit worried that it was too bland and needed salt, but when the soy sauce reduced, it was perfect--in fact, if you don't like salt as much as we do, you should heed the advice of a previous reviewer and be cautious with the soy sauce. I halved the recipe, since there are only 3 of us, except for the garlic, which we tend to like a lot of (in fact, I used 5 cloves); I think you'd have to sear 6 steaks in shifts, since 3 just about filled my 12-inch skillet (be sure not to use a non-stick skillet for this; the tuna won't sear as well). The lime gives the sauce a nice bite--we even squeezed a bit more juice onto the fish from the lime-wedge garnishes--and the shitakes and the tuna make for a wonderful texture. This dish is even visually gorgeous garnished as suggested; my kids, who usually tease me about the my lack of presentation skills, were duly impressed.

Absolutely fantastic! I would rate this above four forks if I could. This is better than any expensive restaurant food. I can't say enough about this fabulous recipe. The sauce is soooo good.

i just finished the leftovers of this dish, and i never like reheated fish. Of course, it was the sauce, which was great. Obviously, part of the appeal is the saltiness; i used a combination of soy and fish sauce. I can see that it would be great on a beef steak. Also, I grilled the tuna.

Rating: 4
My boy and I loved this meal, but a few changes were in order. First of all, I'd like to snicker at everyone who added six table spoons of soy sauce to the dish all at once. Fools! With a powerful ingredient like this the best method is to add a little, taste, and add a little more if needed. I ended up using less than a table spoon. In the future I'd like to try using fish sauce in its place. I used half and half instead of cream and it thickened beautifully. (I have a crazy notion to use coconut milk next time -- which might turn it into some bastardized version of tom kha gai but I really can't say that's a bad thing.) I increased the amount of garlic to five cloves, ended up adding more ginger at the end (probably 3 table spoons total), and also used the taste test method for the lime juice. The only blatantly silly thing about this recipe is the instruction to cook the fish first. There is nothing wrong with letting a sauce sit on the back of the stove for a few minutes, and you simply cannot put tuna in an oven and expect it to be anthing close to raw when it emerges. I used sushi grade tuna, made the sauce first, then seared the fish for probably a minute and a half a side. Topped with sauce that was still perfectly hot, it was heavenly. Oh, and if you want this to feed six people, double it. I'd say this is barely three servings of sauce.

FABULOUS! This is one of my all time favorite meals. EVERYONE for whom I have made this dish loves it. The flavor is divine and the presentation is very impressive (looks very nice with a slice of lime on top of the tuna). I always serve with wasabi mashed potatoes. Use low salt soy sauce.

I, unlike the majority of people who have tried this, did not enjoy the combination of the sauce and the tuna. The sauce on its own tasted just fine, but a sauce so rich in cream belongs nowhere near tuna in my opinion. It completely overpowers the fish and sits extremely heavy in your stomach. Truly a disappointing dish after having bought some beautiful tuna. I will definitely stick to the lighter recipes when preparing this fish in the future.

oh hell yes; my lady and i made this last night along with fried shrimp-basil-ginger wontons and a light greens-bean sprouts-cucumber salade lightly dresed with a citrusy sesame vinagrette. i used sashimi-grade ahi tuna and only a splash of soy sauce. it was heavenly.

So easy and so elegant! I followed the recommendations to cut down on the soy and my guests and I thought the sauce was perfect. I will definitely make this one again.

I love all the ingredients and after all the rave reviews had to try it but... The sauce just overpowered the tuna. I used less soy and salt-reduced as suggested but it was just too strong. I thought the sauce would be nice with steak, so may try that but definitely won't make it with tuna again.

Rating: 4
Outstanding dish. I halved the cooking time and the albacore I used was still not rare; next time I'll cook it 45 seconds on a side and let it sit on the counter, not in the oven. I also halved the soy sauce to good effect. I agree with others who say to go easy on the lime juice. I felt that it could have used a bit more of both the ginger and shiitakes as well; the flavors were a little subtle for my taste. (Caveat: I have a particular love of "hot" flavors such as chilies, ginger, and horseradish, so YMMV.) I had it with a Cellier des Dauphins Prestige Côtes du Rhône blanc, which was a good choice, and served it with jasmine rice and steamed asparagus. I liked it so much I'm going to make it again tonight.

Phenomenal, and truly deserving of its extensive praise! In answer to those who have wondered how to make it a bit less heavy (or are dairy-challenged, like me): I substituted (believe it or not!) Silk brand soy cream for half of the cream (using half-and-half for the rest) and used Spectrum margarine instead of margarine, and I truly can't imagine how this sauce could be any better! Take my word on this (and I really am a picky gourmand) - you will lose nothing, except fat, by making these substitutions. And the less fat, the more of this you can eat! Which is a very, very good thing.

Excellent recipe. Easy to make, very impressive, excellent taste. Tuna was medium with the time suggested - I'd cut the searing time in half to keep it rare. Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

Our first time with Tuna served rare. Great experience. I followed the previous reviews and added half the amount of soy sauce. I also used just one cup of cream. I would add less lime next time as it tends to overpower the fish a bit. My sister-in-law joined us for dinner; she is not a fish or mushroom fan; however loved the dish. Can't wait to make it again.

Rating: 4
Absolutely wonderful. Didn't have cilantro, didn't miss it. For just two of us, I did 1/2 the sauce recipe, and it was more than enough - even with several generous tasting spoonfuls for the cook! Reduced the soy sauce as others advised, and glad I did or it would have been too salty. Gave four forks because it is beautiful, delicious and practically foolproof!!

Rating: 4
This recipe deserves every positive word said about it. Absolutely delicious. I made two changes --- forgot to buy cilantro so did not include it, and used only 1 cup cream for a more concentrated flavor in the sauce. This was great for me, but perhaps might be a wee bit salty for some due to all that soy sauce.

This recipe is DIVINE! I don't care for cilantro so I replace it with parsley and use low sodium soy sauce. I made it a few time with baby shitakes which made the sauce a bit more delicate. I always double the sauce because everyone wants to lick it off their plates! This is also great with chicken breasts and thighs. I tried it with salmon but I think the salmon is a little too strong with this very bold sauce. I have a feeling it would be great with halibut too. I also think the lime is a must! Btw, you can usually find fresh shitakes at Costco for cheap!

I've been making this for quite a while and absolutely love it. Sometimes (usually) I forget the lime. I always cut soy in half and use lite. But tonight I swapped out the tuna for 2" thick prime filet mignon. OMG!!! Try it. Don't kill the filet on a grill or otherwise. Do the pan sear/sit/oven finish/sit routine and you'll be hardpressed to get closer to perfect.

Wonderful dish. Easy and quick to prepare and tastes delicious. I had some fresh oyster mushrooms, which went along great. I agree with using less soy sauce, it was a tad too salty for me. My tuna ended up being cooked all the way through, but its good that way also. I also suggest being careful not to go overboard on the lime. Overall great dish, and it definately has that 'restaurant' feel.

Very good. I used 4 tblspoons soy sauce, but next time I would use about 2 1/2. I would also add even more mushrooms. 2 minutes per side worked out just fine -- more medium than rare, which is fine with me. I served with rice (actually, red rice left over from a trip to Camargue, France -- I highly recommend this rice if you can find it) sauteed with ginger, onion, garlic, lime peel and lime juice and it went perfectly with the tuna and sauce.

lovely. tasted more like a lime-shiitake cream sauce, the ginger was not upfront. i skipped the soy sauce, knowing it wouldn't add anything pleasant. i saved half the cilantro and scallions to sprinkle on top just before serving for a fresher hint of flavor. i also used a lot more mushrooms and less cream, so it was more like a cream-coated ragout than sauce. loved it that way! i'll make twice the amount for my tuna next time. i served this with polenta and sugar snap peas.

That this dish was well received by my diners was a complete surprise, since I inordinately find that Pan-Asian dishes either hit or miss, there is no in-between. I used a little less of the cream and it still works well.

Definite crowd-pleaser! I used a little less cream than the recipe calls for, and added marble potatoes and chopped, young broccoli (both precooked for the most part). Let them simmer in the sauce as it cooked, and voila. So delicious and more colorful and healthy than just cream and mushrooms.

This is so simple and absolutely delicious! My husband and friends said they felt like they were eating in a restaurant! I made it almost exactly as the recipe calls, although probably added a little more garlic and ginger. The sauce is certainly what makes it!

WOW. It takes a lot -- I mean a lot -- for me to rate a recipe 4 forks, but this one deserves it. Absolutely delicious. The only modification I made was lighter on the soy sauce per recommendations; also, I did the tuna for 1 minute on each side and then put it in the oven, and I think next time I will do what Chapel Hill did and not put it in the oven. Doesn't need it. The sauce is really, really good. I served it with plain basmati rice and edamame sprinkled around the edge of the plate. It was good; next time I'll try just serving this as is. I don't know that it even needs anything else. My husband was so impressed, he wants me to serve this when my in-laws visit. :)

This was great. I too reduced the amount of soy sauce to 4T --it was all I had and the Tuna in my market didn't looks so good so I ended up with some very nice Mahi Mahi, which worked out just fine.

Sauce was wonderful, though a little salty. I'll go lighter on the soy sauce next time. Also, I agree that the cooking time on the tuna was too long. Has anybody tried this sauce with any other fish, poultry or meat?

wow - I made this recipe when it first came out in BA so many years back- loved it then. Forgot about it until this weekend - love it now! My only 'problem' was that we got so wrapped up watching the football game into double OT that I forgot to stir the lime juice into the sauce at the end. Had to "sprinkle" it over the dish, which just wasn't quite the same. Still fabulous. I made the full dose of sauce for the two of us and there was VERY little leftover. One minute each side on the tuna and no oven time gave a perfectly rare center which warmed up when topped with the hot sauce.

This turned out wonderful, even though the cream had gone 'round the bend & I had to use 2% milk for the sauce. One thing that disappointed me though was that the stated cooking time was too long - 2 minutes per side, then holding in a 200-degree oven for the seven minutes or so it took to prepare the sauce did not yield rare ahi. Still yummy, but next time I'll just flash-cook each side. The boyfriend also licked the plate - guess it's just that kind of sauce.

Rating: 4
Oh my, was this dish delicious!! Served it for my parents who tuely wanted to lick the plate. I added 2 additional cloves of garlic on accident, totally six, but would do it again in a heartbeat. Also, after reading the other reviews, I decided to go easy on the soy, which was a good move. I can see where it would have been too much. Used probably 4 1/2 -5 TBSP of Lite Soy sauce instead. PERFECT! Also as stated by an ealier reviewer,I agree that the lime juice was what made it without a doubt.

I dont leave feedback often, but after making this sauce for my new "someone", I had chime in on the praise. This dish was so easy and after tasting it, made me look like a outstanding cook. I cut down on the soy sauce just a bit, and ended up not using all of the mushrooms. I keep tasting the sauce as I went along, but it wasnt until I added the lime that it really blew me away. Since I didnt use the full amount of mushroom, I reduced the sauce just a little longer than in the directions. The flavors strong and lovely. Will be making this over and over again.

I have already left a review for this recipe some time ago, but have to leave another one. I was camping in Alaska late summer, and I bought some fresh halibut in Valdez...I bought all the ingredients for the sauce (which was amazing, considering where I was) and made it that night while camped out. It was very easy to prepare, even in the wild, and it was unbelievable w/ the halibut! Maybe it was eating a meal while gazing up at the northern lights, but it was the best ever. I would highly recommend the sauce for anyone cooking outside, or on a backpacking trip..it is easy and lightweight to take all these ingredients anywhere. And easy to remember the few ingredients it does take, if you're shopping on the fly.

This recipe is great, made it for the girlfriend and she absolutely loved it... Quick and flavorful. I would double the sauce (I made the amount on the recipe for 2 and it was perfect, it woud be tough to stretch it for six. Served with wasabi mashed potatoes and schezuan green beans.

Yummy mushroom-licious! Added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of pureed ginger at the end, and unfortunately didn't have lime, AND served it with pork tenderloin, but despite the changes so very tasty. I didn't even know that I liked shitake mushrooms. What have other people been doing with the stems? I chopped them fine and added them to the sauce.

I have made this recipe several times and it has always been a hit. The sauce is simple and it would work well with other fish. I have made it with halibut and I would have to say that I like it better. For company, I would prefer to use halibut because it has a milder taste, good for the "picky" company...

Rating: 4
Wonderfully delicious and pretty easy, too. We seared the tuna for a shorter amount of time than suggested, to use the sashami-grade tuna quite rare, and it turned out fine. We paired it with Rkatsiteli wine (a Russian grape variety, a white wine) from Horton Vineyards, which seemed just right.

This is so good, so good. Do the wasabi potatoes, green beans, the works. Yum. Or pick your own options, but the sauce is very good, the whole thing is just very good.

Finally made this dish after wanting to for some time. It is as good as everyone says. I took the advice of adding less soy sauce, but ultimately ended up having to add more. The sauce is very very good- kind of like a comfort food. I would guess that it would be excellent on chicken and pork as well. This dish is a tricky wine match- we found that champagne went very well with it.

Rating: 4
YUMMY! I made this with a sushi grade ahi and it was unbelievable. I added a sesame crust to the fish ( just toast the seeds and press into the fish before searing) and then seared medium rare. The sauce is amazing, even if you only use crimini mushrooms...my boyfriend was so impressed he bragged about my cooking for days! Canned tuna and expensive shitakes just doesnt sound right to this kid...but if you like it, carry on...peace

I am not sure how the cook from Gotham came to his/her conclusion. Certainly not from experience. This is an excellent recipe for canned albacore. It made a very nice sauce which could be served over rice or pasta. I am doing low carb, so it was fine as it was.

Rating: 4
This was wonderful. I used salmon because I had it on hand. Also used button and shitake equally. I agree with past reviewers the soy sauce should be reduced by a third. I didn't use the cilantro didn't have it. I served this with the garlic-miso vegetables also on this site. I'm doing a low carb thing right now so this was great!

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! I would definitely recommend this recipe for entertaining friends. On the other hand, (and I'm sure it depends on the area in which you live) but because the shiitake mushrooms and tuna steaks alone set me back $40 I would never make this as a regular dinner. Listening to the advice of other reviewers I added half the amount of soy - and because I personally don't care for cilantro I omitted it entirely. In addition, as an accompaniment to this recipe I made "Wasabi mashed potatoes" - it went perfectly with the tuna and the sauce. I cannot recommend this dish enough.

Rating: 4
Ohhhhh.......It was good.....It was REALLY good. Very rich in flavor, but not heavy on the stomach. I've tried this twice and the second time, cut the Soy to 5 TBLS and used a Low Sodium Soy - much better, I recommend doing the same. I wouldn't eat this every week, for health concerns, but if you want to indulge yourself and friends, this is the way to go.

Yum Yum Yum. I was looking for a quick but substantial dinner after a long workday. Even though I slightly overcooked the tuna (I'd never cooked it before) it was still marvelous.

The flavors in this sauce are my favorites, but I had never thought to pair with cream. What a treat! The cream and butter does make it decadent, but it goes a long way because it is so tasty. It was hard to restrain myself from eating too much of it - but the leftovers were great too. My husband won't eat tuna, so I got 1 tuna steak for myself and cooked some bonelesse chicken breasts (just dredged in seasoned flour) for him. Making the sauce separately makes it easy to substitute whatever meat/fish your family will eat. Served with the wasabi mashed potatoes from this site (which need MUCH more wasabi!) and steamed green beans. As an added bonus, I just pulled out some potatoes before adding the wasabi, sliced up a plain chicken breast and added some steamed green beans for my 4 year old. Love not having to cook a separate meal.

This is by far one of the best recipes I've ever made. Anyone who comes to dinner for the first time at our house "gets the tuna"! It's a great recipe to make for guests because you can prep so much of it ahead of time. We, however, grill our tuna instead of pan searing it. I also have cut the soy sauce in half. It really is a "to die for" recipe!!!

I added my review long ago and have since made this dish many times, varying meat, mushrooms, etc. The reviews are extensive - I haven't peeled back all the layers of praise - but I wonder... have we properly thanked the chef at Circa for sharing this recipe? Thank you, thank you, thank you...

The best sauce ever, though admitedly heavy. I can see where people think it's a bit overpowering for the tuna, but it's so good I'll forgive. I've made this several times and find it's best to use low sodium soy sauce, and halve the amount. I'm careful with the lime, too, and add it slowly. (To those of you who think it's too heavy or creamy - READ THE INGREDIENTS - 1.5 cups of whipping cream - if that doesn't sound appetizing, then this recipe isn't for you. Don't make it!!!)

To our taste, this sauce is unnecessarily creamy. Our preferences is for sauces rich in flavor (typically from deglazing or cooking down stock or wine). Still, there's much merit here. FYI, I add a bit of sesame oil when cooking the tuna, adds tremendous flavor.

Rating: 4
This is fabulous, but could use some small changes. Less soy sauce, 5 TBL or less. Used 1 cup cream and thickened with some flour and 1% milk, as needed. Serve with wasabi mashed potatoes and Sesame broccoli (use hot sesame oil in lieu of just sesame oil and 1/2 amount of sesame seeds). Both these recipes on this same site. All the above make for a phenominal meal, just make sure you use quality tuna, cooked rare.!!! This would also be good with edamame(soy beans).

I thought this was excellent. I've made it both with and without the cilantro, and didn't taste an extreme difference. Overall the recipe is fantastic. And very fast, especially if you enjoy your tuna rare. The entire process can be done in less than twenty minutes. On a side note, I wanted to comment on the previous review. To the woman who disliked the recipe immensely. Perhaps next time you should follow the recipe. The recipe does not call for chicken, or bell peppers. If it had, then maybe your commentary would be relevant. I find it amazing that you would give such a bad review on a recipe that you completely changed!

I've made this dish a few times, and (it should have seemed obvious to me) the quality of the soy sauce I use makes or breaks the dish! This sauce was absolutely horrible when I tried to make it with a brand that tastes like the stuff in packets- it was the only apparent flavor in the mess! With a more balanced soy sauce, though, this sauce was sublime with chicken, scallops, and fish :).

I'm sorry, but I don't think this was all that great. The sauce was disgusting. It tasted like salty cream which was most foul. I followed the recipe exactly except I used chicken breast and added red, green, yellow and orange bell peppers for color, however the the paste colored sauce ruined it. I would suggest finding a different kind of sauce to go with this - the amount of cream they suggest is absurd and unappetizing. I'm upset that I wasted money on good ingredients that could have been used to make a more tasty dish.

Rating: 4
This is an incredible dish, perhaphs one of the best meals I've ever made. My husband felt the sauce, although wonderful, is too flavorful for the expensive tuna I purchased and would be better suited to a more flavorful and less expensive meat. However, I'm sure he won't complain when I make it again. Also, I prefer the tuna seared on the outside and very pink,(raw), on the inside, so I make the sauce first, pour it on the serving dish and THEN sear the tuna and serve ASAP. (The tuna continues to cook when removed from the heat). I also coated the tuna with sesame seeds before cooking.

Rating: 4
Just a stunning, great recipe, both in terms of simplicity and payoff. As others have abundantly stated, it's delicious, with each flavor getting strong play. I love the comment about "portion control" -- our guests were as eager as I was to use our bread to eat all of the sauce (I would have encouraged licking the plate if they'd asked). I didn't find a problem with the presentation (I spruced it up with colorful garnish). Like others, I look forward to trying this recipe with other meats (but it's a perfect fit with good tuna), and will see if I can pull off a reasonable facsimile with reduced soy and butter, and a substitute for heavy cream. This has already become a springboard for variations in our household. 5 stars!

Very good. I would follow advice of reviewers next time and reduce soy slightly, it came throught a bit to strongly in the finished sauce.

This dish is awesome. I've made it twice now. First time with ahi tuna and it was out of this world. This time I tried it with chicken breast and it was also out of this world. For the chicken, I took the advice of a previous reviewer and used salt & pepper on the chicken breast and then dredged in flour before sauteing (sp?). Note: The first time I made this I used all half-and-half. The second time I used equal portions of heavy cream and half-and-half. The sauce is wonderful either way, but admittedly a little thicker when mixing half heavy cream and half half-and-half. In my opinion, the sauce is amazing either way and it's not necessary to use all heavy cream. This made a fabulous dinner - served with a side of Jasmine rice. Two thumbs up!

My husband gave it 5 forks. This has been his favorite recipe of the last dozen I have made off this site. I used boneless chicken thighs that were beyond cheap and pounded them thin. Dredged them in some flour seasoned with salt and pepper and then followed the recipe exactly except I used portobella mushrooms after removing the gils and stems. The presentation on a platter with the golden chicken first and the sauce over the top and the chunky mushroom slices on top looked so pretty. I loved the reader belows comment about just having bread and the sauce...makes sense with hungry teens. A good "company will love this" standard chicken recipe now added to my favorite file. I am sure tuna would be great too.

This recipe is simply delicious. It is very quick and easy to prepare. The whole family, even the fussy kids, loved it. The only thing that I wonder about is if it would be possible to make it with half&half instead of cream? I thought the cream was a little heavy.

This is a great recipe. The sauce is strong, so I cut back a bit on the ginger and it is absolutely wonderful for us. Funny, I've been combing this board for about 3 years and some recipes just keep coming back again and again in the constant comment section. This is one of them. Along with the bourbon baby back ribs in summer, pumpkin cheesecake around the holidays and halftime chili in the winter. Gotta figure these recipes have some timeless quality to them.

This recipe is fabulous and addictive, portion control is a real challenge when eating this. I made it exactly as written and served it with jasmine rice (perfect for absorbing the sauce). My only concern is my cholesterol level. Has anyone tried making this with half and half or reduced the fat in any way? I would love to hear. Thanks!

I have made this recipe at least five times,both my wife and I adore it. The only change I have made is a wee bit more ginger and lime to our tastes. I have both my son's coming in tomorrow and will be making this for the sixth time. I have also used this with lamb loin chops cooked rare, Wonderful.

Delicious! I replaced the tuna with salmon fillets (fresh tuna is very expensive in the UK, and not that great) and it was wonderful. In fact, I think its the sauce that everyone really wants to eat, and not the fish! Next time I will try it with chicken (even cheaper than salmon!) as I think the flavours would work wonderfully together.

This is one the best dishes I have ever prepared. I substituted scallops for the tuna and realized too late that I should have drained the scallops before putting them in the sauce--the sauce was pretty loose as a result, but was wonderful. I am on Weight Watchers and the whipping cream freaked me out, but it was worth it. Next time I will try with chicken and substite the cream with no fat cream.

After the rave reviews, I was slightly disappointed. But it was certainly good, and I have frozen half the sauce for later use (probably over cheaper chicken). I made jasmine rice with left over chopped ginger and lime juice, and some asparagus. Just trying not to think about the fat content. . .

This is a fantastic dish! I have made it several times since it first appeared in 1999. Be careful not to overcook the Tuna while keeping it warm in the oven, it keeps on cooking in there. I made that mistake last time I made this.I used yellow fin tuna steaks and it turned out great.

This sauce is SUBLIME. However, I think the sauce obliterated the delicate nuances of the ahi tuna I used ($20/lb!!). Now I know why so many have suggested pairing this sauce with chicken. Another option would be to use a delicate white fish--I will not be pairing this with ahi again, but look forward to experiementing with other types of fish. UPDATE: I REVIEWED THIS 5/02--HAD LEFTOVER SAUCE THAT I PUT IN THE FREEZER. I CAME UPON THE SAUCE 5/03--POURED IT OVER SKINLESS/BONELESS CHICKEN BREASTS, TOPPED WITH PANKO AND BAKED IT. IT WAS FABULOUS EVEN ONE YEAR LATER!!!

This sauce is incredible!!! Very rich and flavorful. I served it with grilled pork tenderloin, wasabi mashed potatoes(also from this site) and steamed asparagus.

Wonderful ! Wonderful! I just loved this dish. I was looking for something to make that would have tastes that would just jump out at you -- this was perfect. I made it just like the recipe called for --- although I only made two steaks, so the sauce in the recipe was just right. I agree you may want to do more sauce if you are doing more than 2-3 steaks. Really good recipe -- get the best ingredients you can find (Whole Foods or other 'upscale' grocery store) and don't overcook the tuna.

I agree with the cook who suggested reducing the soy. I've made this a few times and I like it better with less soy. Otherwise, it is really great. Super easy and delicious. To the cook from Dallas, I would avoid olive oil for high temp. cooking--stick with Peanut Oil, otherwise it may start smoking.

Hmmm. Not sure what I did wrong. I didn't really like this dish...the lime juice was too strong in the sauce. Also, it was my first time to make tuna on the stovetop...I had problems with the fish sticking to my cast iron skillet, even with plenty of olive oil. Any tips?

My whole family enjoyed this. Since I found the recipe only after buying some beautiful yellow-fin tuna steaks and looking for something to do with them, I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I substituted evaporated milk for the cream and lemon juice for lime juice and the result was excellent. Next time, however, I'll make it according to the recipe, assuming it will only be better.

Exquisite. I make 2-3 recipes from this site every week, and I've been wanting to try this for months, unfort. in my area, fresh shiitakes are not common. This was incredible, nearly perfect. Thanks to the advice of other reviewers, I doubled the sauce recipe, and cut way back on the soy. Kept it warm in the double-boiler while I readied the fish. It was devoured, and I caught my grandpa drinking the excess sauce of everyone's plates as he did the dishes (not that there was much sauce left over). This recipe--mainly the sauce--is truly outstanding. Next time I will cut the tuna into pieces and serve that and the sauce over very small portions of linguine.

Although the flavors are very nice I found the dish to be a bit on the heavy side. Tuna is so yummy you don't need such a fatty and heavy sauce to make it taste good. I did make this recipe as I am on a low carb diet, but have plenty of great fresh tuna recipes that don't pile on the fat as well.

not crazy about tuna, but this dish was superb. the mushroom mix and the sauce made the tuna an afterthought! don't cook the tuna too long and i recommend ahi grade tuna for searing.

The lime is a must and the soy should be reduced by half. Very interesting tastes. Agree the tuna is overwhelmed by the rich sauce. This would probably be better with shellfish or a fish that isn't as delicate as tuna.

Rating: 3
My husband made this for my birthday dinner and followed the recipe exactly. We both thought it was very good, but too salty. Reducing the soy sauce would correct this problem. The fish also was a little overdone because the recipe calls for keeping the pan-seared tuna in a 200-degree oven while you cook the sauce. This doesn't make any sense, especially if you prefer rare tuna. Why not cook the sauce first, then pan-sear the fish, and serve directly? Even with these criticisms we still thought this was a tasty dish, with modifications it could be a real keeper.

I've reviewed this recipe before, but another 4 fork won't affect the average much. I just wanted to answer a couple of people, one who asked if anyone had tried it with shrimp, and another who asked for a suggestion for another fish. Yes, I tried it with shrimp, it was fantastic. I just lightly floured the shrimp and sauteed them very quickly and served with rice and the sauce. And I've also made it with halibut, that was also wonderful. I don't eat meat, but I'm sure it would also be wonderful with chicken or pork. It seems to me to be a "white meat" sort of a flavor - fish, chicken or pork, but maybe that's just me. I also had just the sauce with pasta.

I was disappointed by the results of this recipe. It actually turned out to be a similar tasting recipe that I've used with chicken. Trust me, it tastes better with chicken. I think the fish is too overpowered by this dense sauce. For the chicken recipe, I use ginger, shitake mushrooms, soy sauce, a little bit of sugar and salt, some oyster sauce. Mix all together in a dish and steam the whole thing.

If you don't eat dairy or are looking for a low-fat alternative ... I substitute the cream with silken tofu that I cream in the food processor (do not add tofu without processing first). The consistency comes out a bit thicker but you can adjust later. I also use dried shiitakes and add some of the soaking water (which you can freeze for later use as vegetarian stock) to the sauce to adjust the consistency. I also use less soy as I found it a bit salty the first time round. We love this, though haven't tried it with real cream yet so we can't really compare it to the original recipe.

I don't like fish so I substituted frozen Steak-Umms for the tunafish. Also, couldn't get a hold of the shitake meshrooms any where and used sliced beets instead. This recipe turned out terrible and I don't recomend it to any one. Thumbs down!

To cook from "Seafood Wasteland" of Nebraska: as you can see by my previous review below, I made the sauce with trout fillets and it was lovely. I think it would also work with any mild tasting fish such as sole or even halibut. I suspect cod and salmon have too much of a "fishy" flavour for this sauce. Initial review: Fantastic, incredible, amazing! After reading so many enthusiastic reviews over such a long time, I had been wanting to make this for several months. All the reviews were correct - this is a simply wonderful dish! The sauce is to die for and the tuna was perfectly cooked! I also made some trout fillets and the sauce was a great complement for them as well. This is as good as it gets! Of the many recipes I have made from this site, this definitely ranks in the top 5! Manna from heaven!!!

Add my voice to the chorus that is singing the praises of this sauce! I made the sauce non-dairy, so I learned that 3/4 cup soy milk processed with 3/4 cup silken tofu makes a good stand in for the whipping cream... maybe the lactose intolerant or cholesterol watchers among you will care about that!

I didn't want to wade through pages of reviews to see if this question has been answered, but my husband can't stand tuna; how does this do with another fish, such as trout, catfish, or cod (these are fish I can find around here in the "seafood wasteland" known as Nebraska).

This was my 4th attempt at this recipe. It is a spectacular one too; this time I made it for in-laws from Sweden. Everyone was highly appreciative. I have to state though that in my opinion this is not an easy recipe. Cilantro has sand in it and needs to be picked over carefully, washed etc. Shitakes are wonderful, but they need special treatment. So while I do agree that the results of this recipe are great, I cannot in anyway agree that it is easy. I did as much as possible ahead of time too, but at the end I was chopping, sautéing, searing, mixing, measuring?pant pant. This is good, but it is not easy, it goes together beautifully, but it is labor intensive and you have got to move fast.

I thought this was a great dish overall, however, if I made it again I would make some changes. First, the tuna wasn't as rare as I would have liked it after having been in the oven while the sauce was cooking. I would probably just leave it out because I am a big fan of RARE and raw tuna. Second of all, I found the sauce to be very salty and I consider myself to be a salt lover. I would make it with low-sodium tamari next time to keep all the flavor but leave some of the salt. Overall, though, I really like it.

Made this for the second time, and I have to concur with the prior reviewers who say you should sear the tuna. While we don't like our tuna rare, the flavor was better this time when I pan seared it (I just let it cook a little longer, and then the warm oven did the rest) and used that pan for the sauce. Not to say that it wasn't incredible when I did the tuna on the grill, but this was even better. Even the kids think it's great. A true keeper. (By the way, I did reduce the soy sauce-as mentioned. I used a scant 4 tablespoons and it was perfect)

This tuna recipe is definitely a keeper! Yes, the tuna is good, but my oh my, the sauce is devine. Tip for storing unused ginger: put leftover ginger root in a jar and just cover with sherry--toss in the frig for this recipe again or any stir fry.

I served this to my fish hating brother who....requested the recipe!! Reduced the soy, halved the amount of mushrooms. I've cooked the tuna on the grill and using a grill pan - I prefer to have the sauce completed before cooking the fish. Wild rice and grilled asparagus, or wasabi mashed potates and a side of snow peas make a nice looking plate especially when you top the green veg with some minced fresh red pepper and garnish the tuna with cilantro/lime slices. This dish is fast, easy and wow! What more could you ask for?

Rating: 3
Wow, this was so great! I used tilapia (husband hates tuna). I think that the assertive flavor of tuna would really complement this dish as well, too bad for me! I also made it with spinach fettucine rather than the wasabi mashed potatoes. Next time I'll try it with the potatoes- the sauce was too thin to go over pasta, even after I reduced it.

Excellent. Had to try it after seeing all those forks, and I do concur! I got the hubby's "keeper" comment after the first bite. May cut down to 4tbl soy next time, but there's nothin' wrong with this tastey dish!

Rating: 4
Amazing, simply amazing. I think it was the lime juice finishing it off. Perhaps it was the fact that I got excited and made it 10 minutes early, just letting it simmer until it thickened slightly. A few reserved snippings of green onion on top, and my husband asked for it three times in one week - it was a great accompaniment to blackened grouper. (He only got it twice!) I had to use dried, reconstituted shitakes the second time, and it just wasn't the same - look for the fresh-real thing!

To quote a guest, "a keeper!" Just a few minor quibbles with an otherwise fabulous, easy-to-make dish: I would definitely reduce the soy sauce as suggested -- next time I'll halve it. I agree that it's a bit monochrome; serve it with something green, and mix in more fresh chopped cilantro after cooking the sauce. I put the tuna steak in the freezer about ten minutes before cooking so that it would stay rare, then tented it with foil instead of holding it in the oven. It's a bit rich, so I think it actually might go better with medium tuna or chicken than over almost-raw tuna. Served it with sticky rice salad with scallions, pan-roasted asparagus with thyme, and coconut creme brulee -- mmmm!

I made this recipe as stated and it was fabulous. Has anyone tried serving the sauce with swordfish? I am fairly new to cooking seafood and not sure what goes well with what.

Excellent meal! Tasty and easy. It looks and tastes like restaurant quality, so its a great meal for company. I took several people's advice: Definitely cut down on the soy-4T is plenty, and I loved the suggestion to use blended tofu instead of cream. I just gave it a spin in the food processor with a splash of milk--couldn't taste the difference and much more healthy. Works great when served over wild rice with a side of asparagus.

Don't do ANYTHING to this recipe. It's perfect.

What can I say? The sauce is EXCELLENT! I used 3 tbs of soy, next time I'll use 4. I also used regular button mushrooms and it was still fantastic. My husband is allergic to tuna so I used salmon. The person that posted the salmon cooking directions was right on the money. The best part of this site are the comments! We will be making this dish many times in the future.

OUTSTANDING! If you want the tuna raw, make sure you have it in the top of the oven, otherwise it comes out medium...

A very nice dish. I made the sauce with scallops and it worked equally well. I used about 4T of soy sauce. Also, you can definitely lighten it up by using light half-and-half and a little flour -- I didn't notice any difference in taste.

ay.... to not be able to remove the thought of this dish from my mind since we sat down to it months ago. my boyfriend's mother (always outdoes herself in the cuisine) made this when we were visiting and it was uncanning, each bite i had to close eyelids and just feel how wonderful it all was. i am a hard critique of seared tuna, which i have a love for, and think perhaps this may be the best tasting yet! make this, if you can afford just once, and it will be worth more than you can imagine! very filling as well.. skip dessert.

Rating: 4
Supremely delicious, unique sauce... though I think that searing the tuna exactly to my liking (black on the outside, raw inside) is going to take some practice. Perhaps I'll try freezing the tuna for 10 minutes before cooking as suggested....

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe --but a tad too salty. I would suggest using 3 Tbsp to start and adjust to your liking. I couldn't find fresh shitake so I used dried reconstituted. I also tried making this once with evaporated skim milk instead of cream and served it over grilled chicken breasts and it made for an excellent lighter version.

Yummy! That is all I can say...Yummy! I used dried shitakes that I blanched...really gave it a wonderful flavor.

Oh my! This recipe was amazing! Being a bit of a tuna neophyte (I like tuna fish in the can, water packed), this was an exciting adventure for me. My Asian boyfriend laughed at me...We both loved it. The contrast in flavors between the spicey ginger and mellow cream sauce complimented the meaty texture of the tuna. The shitake mushroom, I think you have to use shitake, gave an earthy touch to the dish. Coconut rice was lovely with the entree as was steamed green beans. We will make this again and again!

I made this for a dinner party. I was a little nervous because I hadn't made it before and I'm not a terribly advanced cook. But it was surprisingly easy to make and everyone RAVED about it. I couldn't believe how well it turned out. I followed the recipe exactly, except for using reduced-salt soy sauce and combining some lemon juice with the lime. The one drawback of this recipe is the expense, as other people have mentioned. But it's great for impressing your friends!

Rating: 4
What a lovely dish! I too, made just a few changes...I used both cilantro and fresh basil to equal the 1/4 c. of herbs. I'm a big fan of shallots as well, so I chopped 2 garlic cloves and 1 shallot. The whipping cream has my vote, believe me!!!!...but I did want to substitute with some clam juice too, not a big change...l l/4 c. whipping cream to l/4 c. clam juice....I'm looking forward to this again, real soon!!! If this doesn't make your whole body happy....WOW!!! Thanks for the info on grilling it...I thought about that too, and agree that too much flavor would be lost "out of the pan".

Rating: 2
After reading the rave reviews, I was disappointed by this recipe. FAR too salty... and I am not a person that shuns salt by any means. I love this combination of ingredients, generally speaking; however, I have prepared other recipes where this concept was better executed. I am considering making it again, with less soy or reduced salt soy as others have suggested... but I wonder if it is worth the expense of the ahi and the shitakes when other ingredients overwhelm their delicate flavor.

Rating: 4
Just a follow-up to the cook below who grilled the tuna....On my third time making this dish, I tried that approach also, but went back to the pan seared method. The combination of pan juices, hot oil and "little crusty bits" really adds to the depth of the sauce's flavor. With that said, I doubt anything you do to this recipe could make it taste bad. Virtually any grilled, seared, poached or roasted meat would fare well with this sauce.

Rating: 4
This dish has become the MOST requested when friends come for dinner. I've made it many times, and decided this last time not to put the steaks in the oven, to keep the meat rare. YUM -everyone raved!

Easy to prepare and delicious. I grilled the tuna and made the sauce separately. On the advice of several others, I omitted some of the soy sauce as well.

Served for guests with coconut rice and grilled asparagus. Delicious with a great presentation - a real show stopper. Great because you can chop it all up before guests arrive and then whip it up effortlessly while still socializing and entertaining. The guests said over and over how delicious it was. Try this recipe, you will not be disappointed.

Rating: 4
One of our all-time favorites ... with the revisions suggested below. Much less soy sauce (4 tbsp. or less), a touch more lime. Using button or cremini mushrooms is an acceptable sub, but by all means try with fresh shitakes if possible. The dish also lightens very well; I've been able to pass a light version (fat-free half & half, a touch of cornstarch to thicken) by my anti-dieting boyfriend with no complaints! Goes well with coconut ginger rice an Asian slaw salad featuring rice vinegar and soy, and a nice Pinot Grigio.

Rating: 4
This is delicious. I've been making the sauce and serving it with littleneck clams and scallops. Saute scallops and remove to plate while cooking sauce. Steam clams in white wine. Then add all to sauce when sauce is done and wait for the raves.

Rating: 1
What's wrong with me? I didn't think this was anything special. First, it was too salty. And, although not essential, presentation counts for something. This dish is basically brown - not the most attractive. Served with jasmine rice and snow peas - that didn't help.

Rating: 4
This was my first experience with cooking fresh tuna and it couldn't have been better. The sauce is fantastic; the shiitakes give it an earthy flavor and the ginger gives it a nice zing; it is a terrific compliment to the fish. I used 1/2 whipping cream and 1/2 half-n-half which worked fine. The only problem I encountered was when I seared the tuna; the oil got too hot and started to smoke. That was more my inexperience than anything. Next time I will just oil the tuna and sear it in a dry pan to avoid the smoke problem. I served this with wild rice, sugar snap peas, and for dessert, the ginger-cream tart with berries from this site. Outstanding!

Rating: 4
absolutely delicious. I highly recommend NOT following the advice to put the fish in the oven. My perfectly medium rare-rare Tuna became perfectly medium, probably in part because the pieces were a bit smaller, though the sauce took very little time to complete. We served ours as well with the wasabi mashed potatoes and steamed green beans. What a delightful combination. Excellent sauce for any mild fish fillet.

Rating: 4
Don't waste your money on sushi-grade tuna for this dish. It does not improve it in any way. The sauce, while excellent, does overpower the delicate flavor of the tuna. You can use a plain ol' piece of fresh tuna and it is still as good. Save your money on the good tuna for the sushi. Just my opinion.

Wonderful and delicious. Absolutely loved it, made it twice in two weeks it was so good!

Made this last night for dinner with friends. They could not stop talking about how good it was. I think part of the sucess was due to some excellent, fresh, sushi grade tuna I used that had been caught that morning. However, the sauce was also a HUGE hit. We served it with steamed rice and Steamed Asparagus with Ginger Garlic Sauce. It was a hit...

I made this tonight for my brother who was visiting from out of town. He has very high culinary standards and loves tuna. This dish was a definite success. I'm e-mailing the recipe to him now. The only thing I changed was not putting the tuna in the oven (I tented with foil) and reducing the soy sauce to 4 tablespoons. It still may have been too salty for some tastes, but not ours.

If I remember correctly, this RSVP recipe came from the Striped Bass in Phillie. I tried it when it first appeared in Bon Appetite & have been making it for years, it is one of my favorite recipes ever. Guests just LOVE it! It is pretty simple and quick. I found it a bit too salty for my taste so I modified it, I use unsalted butter and low-salt soy.

Ok, my crisis over peanut oil is over and I made the dish WITH the peanut oil and could smell it when it was cooking, but couldn't taste it, so no worries. I, like so many others, overcooked the tuna in the oven while I made the sauce. I think it would be best to make the tuna last. The sauce will keep just fine. I liked the sauce better without the lime juice. We had leftover sauce which I put over seared chicken the next day and it was great. Pretty easy and VERY GOOD!

Rating: 3
This is an awesome dish. I served it over pasta with a few variations: I used sesame oil. I used 1.5 cups half-n-half instead of whipping cream, plus 1/2 cup skim milk to make the sauce slightly less rich, and I used low sodium soy sauce.

Rating: 4
Oh my goodness! This is great! Probably one of my most favorite recipes on this site. I would recommend reducing the soy sauce too. If you don't like cream sauces (are you nuts?) then don't make this recipe. I've made it twice now and my husband even requested it for his birthday dinner. That tells you how special it is. Try it! You will LOVE it!

We liked this recipe very much, and it got filed in the "make again soon" category. And, even though I forgot to add the lime juice, it was still very good. Can't wait to try it again the right way.

Rating: 4
Sauce is awesome. The touch of lime at the end really makes the dish. The only negative thing I found was that the tuna no longer tasted "seared", but was more on the well done side after being kept warm in the oven. Next time I think I'll make the sauce first, then sear the tuna and serve immediately. The sauce also could be great with grilled marinated tuna steaks. Marinate for two hours in 1/3 cup olive oil, 2 Tbs. soy sauce, 1 smashed garlic clove, salt & pepper, then grill.

Rating: 4
Increasing the lime is a necessity, but when you do it's quite an incredible dish for the amount of time put into it, (hardly any). Maybe it's just the pack of hogs I cook for, but the sauce never seems to be enough to go around, and since it's relatively simple to make, I usually double up on the sauce.

I just made this for the second time, using half the amount of soy sauce and a bunch more lime juice and ginger and it was lovely. We had it with greens with a lime cilantro dressing and lightly steamed asparagus with wasabi butter. Ridiculously good.

To Cook in LA - Thanks for the recipe suggestion. I will definitely give it a whirl! As for ordering seafood from Alaska, I would highly recommend "New Sagaya" in Anchorage. Their website is newsagaya.com. Very high quality and prices run less than many other places because they seem to do such high volume. Thanks again. [If my review shows up again.....sorry. I'm still trying to figure out how to make add'l comments without deleting my previous review.] Well, I guess there is a first for everything, and I think mine is the first "marginal" review of this recipe. I would preface it, however, by saying that we are not big "cream" fans -- it's okay if it doesn't overkill the dish. Anyway, I spurged on some fresh ahi ($21.50 pound...gulp!) and made this as directed. The only changes I made was (1) used 1 cup whipping cream and 1/2 cup 1/2 & 1/2 and (2) used 4 tbls reduced sodium soy sauce. We loved the tuna - nice and rare and incredibly moist. The sauce, however, was kind of sickening. It was just too much/too heavy for the fish, we thought. I love ginger, cilantro, garlic, etc., and we did not use very much sauce. We simply did not like the sauce. It had kind of a gross tannish brown color. That being said, we are definitely in the minority with this review so to those of you so inclined to try this, go for it!

To the cook in Anchorage - you may want to check out 'Pan Seared Tuna with Ginger, Miso and Cilantro Sauce' on this site. No cream - lots of flavor. ps - am considering mail-order of Alaskan King crab legs from Alaska - is there a local fish company you can recommend?

Also, the ginger vanilla bean creme brulee really capped off a wonderful meal!

This was a delicious, unique sause! It went wonderfully with the salmon. Would also go great with chicken. I don't like cilantro so I replaced with Italian flat parsley, which was terrific! It is a bit rich for my taste as a full meal. Maybe I'll make it as a side dish, or make the portion smaller and add a large salad or increase fresh veg next time

I love this recipe. For the sauce, I used the amounts given for the solids, and did everything else by taste. I think this is better since both the soy and lime juices can be overwhelming. To cut calories, I used silken tofu (blended first) as a replacement for the whipped cream . . . would never know the difference.

This is by far the best recipe I have tried off this site.

This recipe was definitely worth all the work! The only thing is, I wished I had taken the time look over one of the reviewer's comments before I made it. He/she had cut the amount of whipping cream and lime juice in half, and noted that it still was wonderful. If, or rather, when I make it again, I will definitely do that. Not sure about the lime juice. I took another reviewer's comment and used low-fat half & half rather than the whipping cream, and I'd use it again.

An excellent combination of flavors! The first time I made this, about a year ago, we HAD TO HAVE IT once a week (for a couple months)!I cut the cream and lime measurements in half and found that to be more pleasing not only to the palate but to the waistline as well. This recipe is just as delicious with halibut or chicken breasts. Wonderful to serve for company plus it's quick and easy! I serve it over steamed rice.

I used half shiitake and half button mushrooms and substituted non-fat evaporated milk for the cream to lighted it up. The flavor was was not compromised. To avoid overcooking, I seared the tuna steaks after I finished the sauce as many people suggested. I will make this one again but for company next time!

Definitely choose your oil wisely. I grabbed the olive oil by accident and my kitchen filled with smoke. Luckily it did not effect the taste of the dish which was fabulous. Very easy, but have everything ready to go before you cook the fish. 5 stars, the best dish I've made from this site by far.

I'm a novice cook and this recipe was simple even for me! 20 mins. from start to finish. I reduced the soy sauce to 4 tbsp. based on others recommendation and omitted the shallots (husband doesn't like them) and it was PERFECT. It was probably the best dish I've ever made. I served it with regular mashed potatoes and corn. For those who don't like fish, they'd probably like the tuna steaks because this dish isn't fishy at all. My only "complaint" is how expensive tuna is so I will reserve this dish for special occassions only. I served this dish to my parents, and they were very impressed.

For being such an easy dish to prepare, it sure did manage to impress my guests. As previous reviews suggested, I decided to add less soy sauce than the original recipe. Also, be careful not to overcook the Tuna. I suggest just a few minutes in the pan and keep warm in the oven at the lowest temperature possible. This dish is something to make if the Boss comes over for dinner. Thumbs Up!

Including prep time, this recipe took a total of 15 minutes to make and it was one of the most flavorful seafood dishes! I reduced the soy a little, but kept everything else the same. The sauce was thick and a perfect texture. The cilantro makes a great garnish. Top it off with a good chardonay and you have a easy, fancy meal!

I am pregnant and can't eat rare fish so I made this recipe with roast salmon, figuring salmon could handle the dense sauce. The upside: extremely easy, even for a novice (me). The potential downside: VERY rich. Sauce in moderation. Make sure to sauce the plate, not the fish, as I did (oops). A belt buster with rice and asparagus, but everyone liked it anyway.

I almost don't need to review this recipe as it has so many raves, but here goes. This was fantastic! The flavours are awesome. I would have followed the recipe as given, but I discovered as I was cooking that I only had 10 fl oz of cream so reduced the soy sauce to about 4 tblspns. I kept all other amounts as given. I think if I had had the full one and a half cups of cream that 6 tblspns of soy would have been ok so think this is definitely personal taste as many reviewers have suggested reducing it. I would recommend caution when adding the soy - keep tasting as you add it. My other comment concerns the tuna. Cook this after the sauce is prepared as it will go on cooking once you put it in the oven. Even if you start off with rare tuna, once it's been kept warm it will cook all the way through (I already knew this so cooked the tuna once everything else was ready). I added the coriander as a garnish as I was cooking for a coriander-hater (used parsley for her which didn't add much) and that worked fine. I also served this with wasabi mash and agree with all the previous reviewers - the flavours work perfectly together. I found this recipe to be quick and easy and one of the best I've used from this site. To the cook in Sammamish, WA - it seems harsh to criticise the recipe for not being simple when you changed a lot of the method. Personally, I found the sauce perfect as it was and wouldn't change anything.

Rating: 4
I followed previous reviewers suggestions and lessened the soy sauce and held back the cilantro until the last minute of cooking - it was delicious. I made the whole recipes (serves 6) of sauce and have leftovers for grilled steak tonight! yum! Ditto that it would be great with any kind of fish/meat/poultry...actually, i think i'd rather not complicate my tuna so much and save the sauce for more "boring" types of meat/poultry, etc. Either way, you cannot go wrong.

Rating: 2
I made this recipe substituting Dover fillet of sole for the tuna. I had high expectations based on all the glowing reviews by previous cooks. I opted to puree the sauce because I didn't like the appearance of the mushrooms (too large of slices) in what was to be a delicate sauce. After I pureed the sauce the mushrooms made the sauce a much thicker consistency than what was intended so I diluted with approx. equal parts 1 1/2 cups white wine and 1 1/2 cups water. I also reduced the soy sauce to 4 Tbsp. It was a better appearance than what the recipe directed and light enough for a delicate fish like sole. It was just alot of work for what was supposed to be a simple meal.

I was really surprised that this recipe was not 4 forks and 100% would make it again! I have used many recipes from this site, and this one is by far one of the best. As others have stated, it can be used with chicken, and it is also great with shrimp. Go for it, let your imagination be your guide!

I've tried many recipes from this site, and this is the absolute best! It's simple and the sauce is to die for. SUGGESTION: if you have vegan friends (like me), you can omit the cream and substitue coconut milk and use as a marinade for tofu or a stir fry sauce. It's so delicious.

Made it this evening. I prepared everything in advance (chopping and measuring). it was quick to cook and so easy. The results were delicious! I did add the cilantro towards the end and it retained its flavor. There were a couple of non-tuna eaters in my group so I served filet mignon to them with the sauce. It is to die for!

Took the advice of one reviewer who used the left-overs with pasta. The first time I made it, I did it with the tuna. Like it, but over a home-made chicken tortelini..IT WAS TO DIE FOR!!! I added 1 TBS of toasted sesame oil in place of one of the TBS of olive oil...a touch more ginger, and even used regular fresh mushrooms. EVERYONE WENT NUTS OVER THIS! This sauce is so versatile and lends itself to more than just tuna. Next time I'll try it over chicken breasts. ONE OF THE BEST OF THE BEST FROM THIS WEBSITE! NO WONDER EVERYONE IS RAVING ABOUT IT! WILL STAY IN MY RECIPE ARCHIVES UNTIL I DIE...BUT NOT BEFORE PASSING IT ON!

Made this for my husband for Valentine's day. It contains so many of our favorite things! Previous reviewers were right on. This was very, very good. I too cut down on the soy (used 3 or 4 T of reduced sodium). Added another T or so of lime juice. Wasn't thinking at the time but the next time around i'll add the cilantro at the end for more flavor. Followed previous cook's suggestion and put tuna in the freezer for about 15 mins before searing. Only ended up searing the tuna (one 12 oz. steak) for about 1 1/2 mins each side, and when i saw how much it had cooked, i didn't put it in the preheated oven. Turned out perfectly (we like it rare). Served atop wasabi mashed yukon golds with mesclun on the side. Fantastic!! Leftover sauce and mashed potatoes were even better. Will make again very soon!

I read the reviews before making this, so a couple of comments. I used all 6 Tablespoons of the soy sauce...but I am one who salts everything. On the other hand, my husband salts nothing and is the first to complain about salty. He didn't. In fact, we had been at a highly reviewed local restaurant two days earlier, and he believes this dish exceeds anything we have tried there. My major modification was with the cilantro. It is a flavor that I do not enjoy. I found some fresh marjoram, instead. I probably threw in more fresh ginger than the recipe called for. Love that flavor! I wish I had followed the reviewers' suggestions for shorter tuna cooking times. If you have good ahi tuna, less is better. I completely agree with those who believe that the sauce would complement many dishes. Just don't compromise on the quality of ingredients.

I don't rate too many recipes with 4 forks, but this is deserving! I used all 6T soy, but reduced sodium kind. The balance of flavors was perfect, and the leftover sauce is just as good gracing pork, or beef. Had fun rounding out the meal with other asian inspired recipes from this website: shrimp broth w/lemongrass, coconut rice, and a dessert that matched this recipe for raves---ginger & vanilla bean creme brulee. Awesome dinner!

I don't think I've ever seen a recipe with so many pages of positive comments! I've been waiting for the right time to try this recipe out and I got the chance when we had friends over for dinner the other night. After trying it out myself, I agree that this is definitely a winner! Thanks to others for their suggestions - I only used about 4 tbs of reduced sodium soy sauce and that worked out well. I think 6 tbs of the regular stuff would have ruined the sauce. I also took the suggestion of those who paired this with Wasabi Mashed Potatoes. The combo was killer! I steamed some green beans and snow peas and sprinkled with S & P and some lemon juice. Everything went beautifully together. My husband said it was the best complete meal I'd ever cooked as far as everything tasting so great together. As for my guests, they raved and left absolutely nothing on their plates (which I took as the best compliment!). For others looking to serve a complete dinner I highly recommend the tuna, wasabi mashed, green beans & snow peas combo. I also served the Carrot-Ginger Soup with Lemon to start out and that worked with the other flavors as well. Made Coeur a la Creme with Raspberry Sauce for dessert. My only suggestions for the recipe itself would be to listen to all the other posters and add the soy sauce slowly until you like the flavor. Also, I bought the recommended amount of ahi tuna and thought the 6 oz. steaks were pretty big. I think 4 oz. steaks would be plenty. I grilled them on a grill pan about 2 min. per side and they were pink in the middle, but not raw. The grill marks make them look a little nicer too. All in all, a super dish...the sauce rocks!

This was great. Don't overcook the tuna. I seared for 3 minutes on each side thinking it would still be rare, but it wasn't after being in the oven. The sauce is fantastic!!! Any fish would be nice or even chicken. Served with wasabi mash. Also I only used 4T soy

Outstanding!!!This is incredible!!! We are making the sauce for this recipe tonight to enjoy with a steamed maine lobster and scallops for our Valentine's Day dinner.

This recipe is one your loved one will compliment you over and over again for.

Like most before me have said here, this dish is truly easy to prepare and so delicious that I plan on making it again this week. This is one of those truly elegant dishes that I can actually imagine preparing on a weeknight. Splurge on the best tuna you can find --- my recommendation is a nice, bright red ahi. Next time I will cook each side for a minute at the most, as I also found the tuna to be closer to medium rare after 2 minutes per side, which is a bit too done for this dish and my personal taste. Served with a crisp caesar salad. Delicious!

I made this dish for my boyfriend and we loved it!! I cut the recipe by 1/3 to make it for 2 people. I might use less soy next time as it was a little salty. I threw the cilantro, scallions, garlic, ginger and mushrooms in the food processor so the sauce took no time at all. It was well work spending the $15 on the tuna for a dish that is better than any $30 entree I have had at restaurant!!

The sauce is excellent. I made it with 3 tablespoons of soy sauce. I will use 3-4 tablespoons of soy sauce next time I make it. I will probably try the sauce with chicken as recommended by a previous reviewer. It is a simple and elegant recipe for company.

Great sauce. I used San-J Tamari Premium Soy Sauce and the cause came out too salty. Would use 5 Tbls. next time. Also, I would mince the ginger instead of chop. I am biting down on chunks of ginger. I let it cook longer (about 10 min.) so the ginger could soften up more and flavors could come together. Also added Cognac at the end to offset the salt. It worked.

This recipe was absolutely delicious and gorgeous on the plate. The only thing I would change for next time would be to do the tuna last. By the time I took it out of the oven it was cooked through, and I like it very, very rare. Also, you can never add enough shiitakes. I will probably double the amount next time. Prep time was about 35 minutes, but TOTALLY worth it!

Restaurant delicious and easy to prepare. My guests were in heaven and licking their plates clean. As one of my friends said "you can't go wrong when you use Shitake mushrooms and cream!" It pulls together quickly. My husband seared the tuna while I made the sauce, if you can team up with someone it is a nice way to skip the oven warm up. The suggested Wasabi mashed potatoes were great too.

We loved this dish; served it over rice. I spaced out the cilantro but added extra ginger and more shitakes. I agree with the cook who said to just sear the tuna. When I cooked as recommended, it was too well-done.

Rating: 2
The only reason I am giving 2 forks is because my husband liked the fish. I didn't find this recipe to be at all compelling or flavorful (although the ingredients would seem to contradict that). In fact, I found the lime juice imparted a bitter taste to the sauce. I won't make this one again.

Rating: 3
I made this dish on Friday for a date. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used only three Tbs. of soy sauce, but didn't feel that the sauce had enough "kick". I love highly seasoned foods and felt that this needed a bit more soy sauce (next time I'll use all six Tbs.) and a bit more ginger and garlic. The texture of the fish and the sauce were fantastic! I spooned some sauce over garlic mashed red potatoes and it was great! I highly recommend the dish, but test it out and perfect it before you serve it to guests!

Absolutely a wonderful recipe. Thought a cream ssuce may be too heavy for the delicate taste of extremely fresh tuna, but complimented it beautifully. Cooked the tuna rare, just seared on the outside. Provided some wasabi on the side for more flavor contrasts.

I could repeat what everyone else said, however this recipe is a keeper! My partner said after the 2nd go round, keep this recipe upfront. I made the tuna for 2 Monday, than last night with the left over sauce, I thinned with a little more 1/2 and 1/2, seared some bay scallops, server over egg noodles with sauce on top. Delicious both nights, the ginger lime combo makes it taste so fresh.

Made this for guests tonight. It was incredible. Without a doubt it is the most delicious way to serve tuna steaks. I held back some of the soy sauce based on comments I read here. I also used more mushrooms than the recipe calls for and fed 4 instead of six. We dipped our bread in the leftover sauce.

I originally made the dish as directed, except I added only 4 TBS of soy sauce, it was okay, but a little too rich and it seemed to be missing something. Also, two minutes for the tuna is too long (that plus warming it in the oven dried it out). A couple of days later, I almost threw out the leftover sauce but tried to work with it....so to a 1/2 cup of chicken stock, I added 1 and 1/2 TBS of flour, I then added the slurry to the sauce along with a 1/2 cup each of cilantro and sliced green onions, along with a cup of frozen medium shrimp. I served it over penne pasta with additional cilantro and green onions and a squeeze of lime and it was divine!!!! This is an awesome base recipe that has to be modified to tasters prefence, as I and other posters have done.

"Lovely, just lovely." Those are the only words my companion, Xanthea, could mutter between bites of this exquisite dish. I only used 4 TBSP soy sauce and it turned out just right. Looking forward to the winter months, I'm thinking of making this into a chowder. Who doesn't love a bowl of chowder while sitting at home cuddling in front on the fireplace on a cold, snowy, wintry day. I think I'll try adding potatoes, corn, and milk, omit the soy sauce and ginger and chopping up the tuna in to bite size pieces and making a tuna, potato, and corn chowder. Any thoughts as to whether that recipe would be successful? Cheers : ) Skyye

The recipe is 5 star restaurant quality recipe! Just make sure you use real soy sauce -- Asian -- and not the American corn syrup look-a-like. The real stuff isn't as powerful as the mock American.

What a dish! This was fabulous and easy. I took the advice from someone that cooks tuna on a regular basis and only seared it for 90 seconds on each side and it was good, but I actually like it more on the rare side than just pink in the middle, so if you feel that way too, I'd suggest searing it for 60 seconds per side. We served this on a nest of rice vermicelli and a side of sauteed snap peas, still crisp, just warm and coated with sesame oil and salt & pepper. DELISH!! I would recommend this recipe to others and will definitely make it again because of the flavour and ease.

I made this for Father's Day. My dad raved about this dish, saying it was the best meal he'd had in over a year (including meals at restaurants). I was disappointed that there wasn't more ginger flavor, perhaps because I used prepared crushed ginger instead of grating my own ginger root? Because of the complaints in the reviews, I started out with 3T of soy sauce, but ended up using the full amount called for by the recipe. The sauce was delicious, but next time I will make this with a more delicate fish.

Made this twice already! Everyone loves this, the sauce is wonderful! Any mushroom will do, first batch I made with portabella mushrooms, second with shiitake, the shiitake have more flavor, the second time I used chicken instead of tuna. Both times it was delicious, I also threw in broccolli flowers and spinach. The second time I had some artichokes that I needed to use up so I made a puree with them and added them into the sauce, I don't think it made any difference, just nutrition wise it might have had a slight effect. Will make this again!

I prepared this recipe with salmon filet instead of tuna, and used fat free sour cream instead of cream. I doubled the ingredients of the dressing, since it is delicious. Everybody loved it! The filet can be seared, and the dressing prepared ahead of time. Place filet under the broiler for few minutes, and warm the dressing. Beautiful presentation too!

Rating: 1
I found this recipe to be very disappointing. You do need to decrease the amount of soy sauce -- I added only 4 tablespoons and still found it too salty. The cream makes the sauce too bland without adequate brightness. My recommendation is to add more lime juice and perhaps a dash of hot spice/vinegary condiment like sirijha to brighten the dish. As I have dined at Circa restaurant in Philadelphia and have not found it to be outstanding, it is no wonder that this recipe follows suit.

Rating: 4
This was something I would expect to find as a special at a restaurant. The cream sauce is fantastic and so easy to make. I would however cut down on the soy, maybe 41/2 tblsp. or low salt soy sauce if they make it. I have already printed several copies and distributed them to my co-workers. Just try it, you won't be disappointed.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful dish. Even my 12 year old son, who is a little gun shy when it comes to seafood that isn't batter dipped and fried, loved it. I agree, you can use regular button mushrooms instead of shitakes, and the sauce is delicious on other meats such as chicken and especially pork. I only bought one very good sized tuna steak for 3 of us and made a lot of rice as an additional dish--this cut down on the expense but still filled us up enough. The sauce is terrific on the rice as well.

Rating: 4
My wife is not a big seafood lover so I slice 1 inch thick pork tenderlions and sear them for about 5-7 mins per side. This also makes a more aforddable meal for those who don't want to spend the extra $$ for Tuna,about 15.00 per lb.

Rating: 4
I agree with the ravers--the sauce is what makes this recipe. It makes your eyes roll back in your head. I can't wait to try it with other types of meats, or alone over pasta. I think the best advice, is to start slow with the soy sauce, and keep tasting to make sure it isn't too salty. If you do make it too salty, I would recommend adding more ingredients and dilute it to make a larger serving--it's so good you'll want leftovers anyway.

The other reviewers were spot on - the sauce was fantastic and this is quick and easy to prepare even for a novice. Served with basmati rice and fresh green beans with garlic and lemon, delish! Cooked this for two but used full sauce recipe, if making this for four I would definitely double the sauce. Cut the soy in half and still thought it could be reduced a bit more. Must use shitake's they give great flavor as does the cilantro. Definitely use fresh garlic, ginger (grated) and lime juice. Cooked tuna as directed, cooked thru but not at all dry (steaks about 1 1/2 -2 in.), next time will sear tuna and leave very rare in middle - think the flavor will be better with the sauce.

I am a junior in college with a substantial amount of cooking experience under my belt but with still a lot to learn. So when I made this dish for a dinner party for two of my friends, I was worried about how it would turn out. I've eaten at a fair share of great restaurants in NYC, and even with a spoiled palate, this tuna recipe is one of the best I can remember eating, not to mention that the preparation was so simple and straightforward. My friends absolutely loved the sauce, and one actually sopped up all of the sauce from his plate with a piece of bread, leaving no trace of sauce. Incredible.

Rating: 4
WOW! I made it for 2 and it was TERRIFIC! I barbecued 2 steaks (rub with a little oil, then 2-3 min/side on hot grill), put them on a plate in the preheated oven, then made the sauce by cutting all ingredients in scant halves (be sure to reduce cream to just 1/2 C). Careful - this sauce cooks quickly! Serve on heated plates alongside a simple cucumber salad (see Joy of Cooking) and presto - a superb, low effort meal - just the way I like it!

Rating: 3
Wow--most of the reviewers are right on target about this recipe. In the future, I'll read them before I start cooking! The amount of soy sauce suggested in the article must be a typo--it was WAY too salty with 6 tablespoons of soy sauce. In the future I'll reduce it to 3. Editors of Bon Appetit or Gourmet, you need to rewrite the recipe with this revision, otherwise the sauce is ruined.

Rating: 3
Like everyone else, we loved this one. Agree that the amount of cream can be cut without any great loss (it is rich enough) (if too thick, add some whole milk). Disagree, however, about the use of shiitakes. They are a must. Their smokey flavor really adds a lot, and the meaty texture compliments the fish wonderfully. Keep the amounts of everything else the same to achieve a tasty balance.

Two quick suggestions about what is really an outstanding sauce: 1. DEFINITELY either reduce the soy sauce to 3 - 4 tblsps OR use low sodium soy sauce - very salty if you don't do either! (Wish I'd read the other cooks' comments before I made it!!) 2. I'm the first to mention this, but I found the 3 tablespoons of lime juice gave the sauce an overpowering bitter edge. Next time, I'm starting with 1 tablespoon lime juice, tasting, then adding more if necessary versus going with the whole 3 tblsp to start. This is easy to do since adding the lime juice is the final step in preparation. Otherwise - this is a real winner and looks as nice as it tastes!

Rating: 3
I used the sauce only, on broiled marinated (honey, ponzu sauce, ground ginger, powdered garlic, ground pepper) boneless skinless chicken breasts. I did cut down on the soy sauce as people had mentioned, but found I needed to add my leftover marinade (mostly soy) to the cooking sauce to round out the flavors. In the future, I'd make the recipe with the full amounts of everything. I too used n/f half & half instead of heavy cream, and while I did use a tiny bit of cornstarch and water at the end to thicken it, thought it was superb, very creamy & great. my husband and sister-in-law loved it and both found it rich & wonderful. I couldn't imagine using anything but fresh shiitakes in here--they make the sauce. Also use a ginger grater for the ginger for better consistency.

I have made many recipes from this site, most of which were rated 3 and 4 forks, however, up until now I have not been moved to comment. I can honestly say that this was THE most awesome sauce that I have ever tasted! Yes, tuna is a very good fish no matter what you do with it (except over cook it!), but again it's the sauce that makes this recipe. I'm glad I read the reviews, 'cause too much soy sauce would have definately ruined it for me. As another reviewer commented, the regular white mushrooms are a fine substitue and made no difference in the outcome. This one really is a keeper! I am sure that I will make it again and again. Can't wait to try it over chicken breast!!!

I am a tuna fan, and this is DEFINATELY the best tuna i've ever had! it was simple, too. i over-cooked the tuna (but that was my fault). I made it exactly as it instructed, and it was perfect.

I've made this a number of times; we like it as much as the other reviewers. I usually make the sauce first, so that my tuna doesn't overcook, get cool or have some other dish not ready. I make half a recipe for the two of us, but save fat by using fat free half and half and a little cornstarch to thicken. I pan-sear in a grill pan with a little peanut oil. Also use 1/2 tsp peanut oil to make the sauce.

Awesome sauce! It would be great on an old shoe! Cilantro is a must as far as I am concerned and I loved the final addition of lime. I had to cook the cream a bit longer to get it to thicken. Even my kids ate the sauce and the never eat sauce!

I've made this twice and had rave reviews each time. This is "a keeper". It's easy and will make you look and sound like a real gourmet cook! I suggest reducing the soy to 4 Tbsp. I'm not crazy about cilantro so I cut that back a bit too. Cooking time goes fast (aromas are incredible!), make sure you have everything lined up before you start.

Wonderful sauce. My tuna seemed more done than I like it at 2 minutes a side, but thats a matter of taste. The sauce I'd definitely make again, and imagine it would taste wonderful over anything. Used half the soy, as recommended and left out the cilantro. I have leftover sauce, as I only had 2 tuna steaks, so will have fun thinking of what to serve it with. Yum.

Easy to make, excellent taste. Great company dish. I served with a pear and blue cheese salad and rice. I think a pecan couscous would be really good with it.

My wife claims this was the best fish she's ever tasted (she's a confirmed seafoodaholic). I used yellowfin tuna and left out the 3 tablespoons of lime juice. As always, the key to good fish is to buy the freshest you can find (avoid the grocery store if possible). Not difficult to make and it was definitely a hit.

I've made this recipe at least 5 times and it always turns out great. The sauce tastes great on steak, chicken, and pork tenderloin. Everyone I've ever made this for goes crazy and hounds me for the recipe.

This was awesome! Very easy and great with good sashimi grade tuna. I used half cream and half 2% milk and it still tasted great. My husband loved this--he used the sauce on chicken the next night.

Have you ever been to Italy and asked if you could get a deep dish, cheese filled crust, and ask that they not use olive oil, basil, or tomato?? After reading some of the reviews, I wondered how considerate some of the people where to the asian inspiration of this recipe. Asian? - shitake mushrooms, usage of soy sauce, and the use of tuna (seared only for a couple minutes on both sides - kind of like sashimi). Bottom line: I followed the recipe exactly the way its posted. Except that I did hold back on a tablespoon of soy sauce (shoyu).

Rating: 4
We've made it four times now and it has always been a hit. Sauce would be good over veal as well.

Rating: 4
I made this for family and friends and it was terrific. You have to be careful and not overcook the tuna (leave it red in the middle). If slightly overcook it (like I did) it dries out. But that just means you use more of the delicious sauce. By the way, the 1-1/2 cups of cream is about 120 grams of fat!! So be carfeul.

This was try to be Thai food! I was disappointed as after reading all the rave reviews I thought this is going to be great - but it wasn't. If I want something that takes like Tom Yum Gai - I'll just use the recipe for the Coconut chicken soup on this site which is pretty good and very similar in flavour without the expense of the fresh Tuna.

Rating: 4
we just made this recipe again, with some small variations, for friends who, as it turns out, professed to not like tuna or mushrooms. they claim to have been converted (having aparently never before having fresh tuna). this is one of the most special recipes in the website, which seems affirmed by the number of reviews it has received.

Rating: 4
Delicious and easy! We substituted dried shiitakes out of necessity. This gave the sauce a very woody flavor that I rather enjoyed.

We loved this recipe! Used salmon as suggested by another reviewer and it was great! Had lots of leftover sauce which I mixed with about 2 cups of chicken broth the next day for an excellent soup that tasted just like the Thai soup in restaurants. Thanks Epicurious!

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!! I used low sodium soy sauce and held back one tablespoon. It was really good. My husband, 2 yr old, 4 yr old and myself could not stop eating...we ate it with rice to soak up the delicious sauce with. Very simple to prepare. I can't wait to have it again.

We used salmon and it tasted wonderful. I also used 1/2 of the soy sauce. We will definitely be preparing this again soon. Certainly the next time we have company.

This was a tasty dish. The shitake is a nice addition. It's a bit heavy, though... consider going easy on the cilantro and soy, with more ginger and/or lime.

This recipe is perfect to impress anyone. They'll think you were in the kitchen slaving away when it only takes about 10 minutes total. I would use only half the amount of soy sauce as others mention. Also, this sauce is great on steaks too.

I made this the other night for my family. My husband and I loved the sauce. I used button mushrooms and it tasted great. I seared the tuna on both sides in a heavy grill pan and finished it in the oven, 2 minutes was not enough for the thick steaks I had, they were still raw. Served it with rice pilaf and roasted asparagus. Will make again soon!

Made this last night- variations were that we used Halibut, button mushrooms, and 1/2 the amount of soy. Overall it was great, but....both my wife and I thought that Tuna would have been much better ( Halibut 8$ a pound, Tuna $ 15 a pound I was being cheap) The sauce was great ! we served it with rice and fresh green beans and Oregon Pinot Noir to drink. I'll make it again.

Made this last evening for guests. It was a great hit. The sauce is a wonderful combination of flavors. I gave out the recipe to several people and overheard one of my guests raving about it the next day. I will definately make this again.

Very, Very good recipe! I made it according to the except I used halibut which I pan seared and then kept warm in the oven. The flavors were excellent. A good "company" meal!

This was an excellent, flavorful dish, thanks to the sauce. I only added 1/2 the soy as suggested by others, and that seemed fine. My opinion is you that you can't beat fresh shiitakes, so I might add other mushrooms, but never substitute them. I have alreaded forwarded the recipe to friends. YUM!

Rating: 4
Wonderful Sauce! Very easy, we substitued 50% of the mushrooms with buttons and used large fresh sea scallops instead of Tuna, cut down on the soy sauce and it was marvelous! My husband came home for lunch and then asked about the leftovers for dinner. Thanks to the previous reviews we knew about the soy sauce...everyone was correct...

I've prepared this dish several times with coconut rice and loved it. Worked well salmon too. I think the suggestion to cut down on the soy sauce is a good idea.

This is an incredibly simple and delicious dish. The sauce would probably go with just about anything including chicken (as several others mentioned) and even steaks.

Rating: 4
Yes, yes...4 forks! Really good and so darn easy to make! I do agree with others that the amount of soy should be cut in half. I've made this recipe twice now, once using shiitake mushrooms and once using regular white mushrooms and found that there really wasn't enough of a difference in taste to go to the expense of buying the shiitake's. Instead of whipping cream I used half and half with very good results. I rarely use anything but skim milk products but this is one of those recipes that I just have to say to heck with the calories and enjoy! I also advise you have everything pre-chopped, lime juice squeezed, etc. before cooking the tuna....that way you can sear it quickly, put it in a low oven for just the few minutes it will take to make the sauce and it won't be overcooked. We like ours very, very rare and by doing it this way the tuna was perfect!

Rating: 3
My friend and I loved this dish. It is simple to make yet gives the impression that you are a well-seasoned gourmet - that's fun... I cut the soy sauce in half and used the low sodium type. The bit of lime gives the sauce a special flavor. I served the dish with a colorful bunch of baby veggies - yum!

This was one of the best fish recipes I have ever made. The flavors of the ginger, mushrooms and soy sauce were fabulous. I followed the suggestions of reducing the soy sauce by 1/2 and it was fantastic. I will definitely make this for guests. (If you are cooking for someone that is lactose intolerant, I use Vitamite or Soy Milk and I thicken it with a little flour.)

This is one of the best tasting dishes I have ever encountered. I have never been a big fan of fish in any form, but this is wonderful. Talk about a pleasure of the senses, it fills the kitchen with a wonderful aroma, makes your mouth water, and finally when you get to eat it, it was worth every moment of torture.

Rating: 4
this sauce is superb. i made it with condensed whole milk and it was wonderfully creamy and aromatic i almost didn't taste the fish. i bet this would be a good sauce for chicken, which always needs jazzy sauces. served it with some steamed new potatoes tossed with butter and cilantro -- elegant (but fairly easy) dinner for a monday night.

Definitely the best recipe we've found on this site so far. The sauce is amazing.

This dish was so wonderful and unique, it made me look like a real gourmet! The shiitake mushrooms really made the difference, I wouldnt substitute them. I also might use less soy sauce and lime juice next time, it was a bit too tart and/or salty for me, but my boyfriend absolutely loved it the way it was!! The tuna needs to be cooked longer than the recipe dictates for a 1 inch cut. Very delicious and impressive dish

Rating: 3
Very nice taste! Even though I used lite soy sauce, the soy taste was a little strong. Next time I would use only half the amount called for in the recipe. Also, it took about 10-12 minutes to cook the tuna to a flaky texture. It went well with wild rice and french style green beans. The whole family loved it.

Oh my gosh! Talk about dying & going to culinary heaven! This dish is fabulous. The sauce is to die for. I wouldn't change a thing about it. I can see this sauce over halibut as well. Actually I can sit & eat the sauce all by itself! Can't wait to make this again - everybody raved about it.

A wonderful dish. I will absoultely make this again! I would also cut down on the amount of soy sauce (or use a light soy.) I didn't have any cream so I used evaporated milk instead (it worked out well - cream would have been better of course!)

My husband just returned from Baja and brought some fresh bonita. This is the first time I have ever cooked tuna of any kind and we both thought this sauce was absolutely delicious. The market had no shiitake mushrooms so I sustituted the regular ones. The dish was so elegant and beyond our expectations that I can't wait for him to bring back more, next trip!

I made this dish last night for my boyfriend and I and we both agreed that it is by far the most phenomenal sauce we have found for tuna. Splurge with the more expensive tuna and the shiitake mushrooms, the results are well worth it! This is the first recipe I have tried off of Epicurious...can't wait to try more!!

This is probably the best fish recipe I have ever tried. I'm not a big fan of cilantro, but the combination in this sauce worked really well together. I would also recommend searing the tuna after you make the sauce, instead of ocercooking the fish in the oven.

Excellent. I'm not usually a seafood eater but this one was enough to convert me. The first time my wife prepared this delectable treat she used cream. The second time she used 1/2 light cream and 1/2 skim, saving many calories and only slightly compromising the taste. Definitely a repeat performance.

The sauce for this is excellent. One of my favorite tuna recipes. It deserves four forks and is a definite repeat. However, it is not my favorite tuna dish. That comes from "Elizabeth on 37th" in Savannah, Ga. It's in their cookbook. I have had it there and made it several times. If there is a more satisfying tuna recipe in the world, please let me hear from you.

About the best recipe I've found at Epicurious, (and I've found many). Easy, very different, and the sauce is excellent with other fish or chicken. Regular mushrooms work quite well too for a less expensive dish. Do try to make the sauce in the seared tuna pan, just don't overcook the tuna in the oven! Mouth-watering, can't say enough good things about this one.

This recipe is easy and always a hit. The sauce also works great with grilled swordfish and salmon.

Absolutely the best fish dish I have ever had! I'm not a seafood lover, but this succulent Thai-inspired dish will make me a regular at the fish market. I would suggest splurging on good-quality ahi tuna and saving on the mushrooms (half shiitake and half something else) It's the blend of flavors that stands out, not the mushrooms. Also, make sure you use unsalted butter. Serve it over aromatic rice such as Louisiana Pecan and follow the dish with a refreshing dessert such as mint ice cream with chocolate straws. I'm in heaven!

Rating: 4
I have made this several times and, let me tell you, it is worth dodging the splattering oil. It's one of the best recipes I have found on this site. Something I alter: no cilantro. I hate it and believe that, even if one likes cilantro, the flavor would overpower the other, more subtle and elegant flavors of the dish.

We have made this twice already, it really is a show stopper. The first time, we forgot to add the lemon juice, tastes great with or without, even on the side- But added a little Spanish Cognac(Cardinal Mendoza) to the sauce, while you saute the mushrooms. Fabulous!!!!

Yummy! My husband doesn't like creamy food but he likes this one very much that we ate this for 3 days straight! I use dried shiitake mushroom since fresh ones are expensive. Turned out a bit too salty, so reduce the soy sauce to 5 tbs. I only use 1 c. of 'thin' whipping cream and 1/4 c. of milk. I substituted tuna with frozen chicken breast. I bake the breast in a hot oven while it's still frozen until done, and sear it 2 minutes per side on hot oil. The result: tender, juicy breast with crispy crust and yummy sauce. I serve it over japanese rice. I also grate the ginger and smash the garlics to release more of their flavor. Definitely a keeper!

WOW! Have had ingredients on hand, but couldn't find nice looking tuna, so I made it tonight with chicken breasts. It was wonderful (even though I found my lime juice still on the cupboard when I was cleaning up). I can hardly wait to try it again with tuna AND with lime juice. I prepared all ingredients for the sauce in advance, so it took less than 5 minutes to put it all together. A definite keeper!

Rating: 4
This is really delicious. I used a "tups" of olive oil and added a few dashes of Caribbean scotch- bonnet pepper sauce for some zing ! I half cooked the tuna just to barely sear the outside and left it to keep warm coveered in a low oven while we had the appetizer & finished up the sauce just before serving. You need to make the sauce in the same pan that you cooked the fish in for flavor. I also used 2 kinds of mushrooms as shitake is very expensive & I put more mushroons - make lots of sauce as it goes generously on basmati rice !

Rating: 4
Absolutely awesome. I followed the recommendations of some of the reviewers here and made the sauce first (so I wouldn't need to keep the tuna warm in the oven and thus overcook it). I also reduced the cooking time to a bit less than 1.5 minutes per side to keep the tuna rare. Increasing the sauce recipe was great as well. I'd suggest a colorful sidedish (I served it with couscous with butternut squash), and definitely garnish the tuna with the lime and cilantro if you're concerned about the appeal of the presentation. A huge, huge hit for both my intimate dinner for two and a friend's dinner party for eight. Highly recommended!

Make double sauce--it is good. I made it ahead but it thickened too much. I also kept dipping into the pan just to taste. And I used chicken, grilled. A real keeper.

Exquisite! Make extra sauce for sopping up with crusty bread. If you do the prep ahead of time, it only takes about 10 minutes to make, and can be brought straight to the table. A monster hit.

This was a deliciously different recipe. However, I would watch the tuna steaks when you sear them. If you truly want them rare, 2 minutes on each side is too much. Also, you might want to use low-sodium soy sauce as it can get rather salty.

The flavor of this recipe was wonderful, and it didn't require much if any cream. However, if you are going to make this for a dinner party (as I did), DO NOT RELY on warming it in the oven! (It was no longer pan seared but rather WELL DONE by the time I served it!)
