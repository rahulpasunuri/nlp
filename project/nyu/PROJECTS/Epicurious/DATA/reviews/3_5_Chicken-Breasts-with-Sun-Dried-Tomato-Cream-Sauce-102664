I just wanted to say thank you to Kim for such a wonderful and tasty recipe. As many did; I added my own touches: shitake mushrooms, lime thyme, onion powder, pepper flakes, and sea salt. I too made enough sauce to put over Kamut noodles. This was an easy to make and lovely to look at dish. I will make it again and again!

Well I am not sure if, after 188 reviews it is worth putting in my two cents but here we go. We enjoyed the combination of these ingredients. I added mushrooms and sliced the chicken breasts into strips, put the whole thing on whole wheat pasta. We enjoyed it very much and it was quick and easy. Used a leek instead of shallots.

Great recipe! I add 2 more cups of cream and season to taste and it makes a wonderful pasta sauce! Also, cutting the chicken into pieces and tossing together with bow-tie pasta is fantastic! Definitely a keeper. Great for kids, too!

This is very easy to make and is one of our favorites now. I usually add more of everything but the chicken so I can serve it as a pasta dish. It works either way. Simple and tasty. Next time I am using chicken off the bone to see how that works.

I didn't use more oil when sauteing the sun-dried tomatoes and didn't have whipping cream but added double bream and chicken broth. I also added garlic powder, thyme, basil & tabasco but it was still bland. If I do it again I'll try deglazing with white wine. Maybe it'll give it a certain something. It wasn't bad but I expected more. I wouldn't bother with it again.

This recipe was not only really simple, but the flavors were outstanding...it was a real hit with everyone in the house. I added a bit more sun dried tomatoes and reduced the cream more than the recommended time as well as added a bit of hot sauce for flavoring which resulted in a thicker, tastier sauce.

Rating: 3
Altered this recipe per others' suggestions, and I'm glad I did otherwise this would have been very bland. Added additional garlic powder to the minced garlic, dried basil & fresh thyme I had on hand & wanted to use before it went off, & quartered artichoke hearts. Also used half & half instead of heavy cream and added chicken stock to loosen the sauce. Sliced the chicken after cooking and served over thin spaghetti. I think this would have been very bland without the additions, but with them it was a good, easy, satisfying weekday meal.

This one is a winner. I have made this twice now and the second time I followed a reviewers advice and tripled the sauce and had it for pasta the next day. Awesome!

My family and I loved this meal. I did change a few things after reading some of the reviews. I pounded the chicken flat,cooked as directed then cut into large bite-sized pieces, I also added chopped mushrooms,basil and pinenuts. After the sauce was done I added Campanelle pasta and mixed in chicken to make a one pot meal, serve with a salad and bread and you've got a great quick meal. My picky teenager had 2 huge servings.

I also cut up the chicken breasts and cooked them in the sun-dried tomato oil. I added about 1/4 cup of wine and 1/4 cup water with a low salt chicken bullion after I took the chicken out and then halved the cream and added parmesan, oregano and basil... I had no shallots. I served the chicken and sauce over a plate of whole wheat penne... DELISH. This is definitely a keeper. I kept the sweet issue in mind and added salt and pepper to taste.

Rating: 4
Super fast and tasty. I pounded the chicken to flatten a bit. I added mushrooms cut in quarters, used the oil from the sun dried tomatoes to cook the chicken and then also to cook the garlic, onions, sundried tomotoes and mushrooms. Used 1/2 chicken broth and about 1/4 cup cream. Was excellent.

Rating: 4
My family and I just adore this recipe. For simplicity and shorter cooking time, I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and cook them in the large skillet and proceed as per rest of the recipe. Can be served over noodles to tame the richness, or to make the meal feed more, but we never do.

I used fresh basil and chicken broth to deglazed the pan as another cook suggested. I also subsituted half n half for the cream. Sliced the chicken and mixed it into the sauce with penne pasta and about 1 cup of the pasta water.Whole family enjoyed it including my 2 and 3 year old.

Absolutely delicious...there just seemed to be 'something' missing and I couldn't put my finger on it. I think I just used too few sundried tomatoes because I was scared that it would come out too sweet. Husband wanted more garlic but he's a garlic freak. In any case, I followed the directions but added the white wine as recommended. Fabulous.

This recipe is quite good as a pasta sauce...I cut up the chicken, added basil and parmesan. I used 1 tbsp of the sun-dried tomato oil as part of the oil in the recipe for additional flavor. After making the sauce I added the cut up chicken back to the sauce, heated and served over penne. Pasta lovers gave it a thumbs up!

This was soo good. I did what others said about the wine and Basil. What I also did was when it came time to sauteing the shallots, garlic, and tomatoes.

I've ended up making this recipe a couple of times. It's ok, but not fantastic. The sun dried tomatoes make the sauce a little too sweet for my liking. Besides the sweetness, the flavor is pleasant and very rich. If I make it again, I may try substituting the cream with something lighter.

Quick easy and delicious! My husband was still talking about it the next day. Just one thing, add a little garlic powder & salt to the chicken before cooking and let it sit for 5 mins (while you chop your shallots and garlic). This will give the chicken flavor. I can'I wait to make it again!

This recipe was good, but I made a few modifications. I added good quality sherry to the pan after the shallots, garlic and sun-dried tomatoes sauteed and deglazed the pan. I then added the cream and seasoned as in the recipe. This added tons of flavor and I can't wait to make it again.

A bit bland if you go with the straight recipe. I added pepper and garlic salt. Dried red pepper flakes would work well too. I chop the chicken up into pieces before cooking, making it much easier than cooking the whole piece at once. I tossed the sauce and chicken with pasta and it was delicious! Very easy dish to make.

This dish was very bland so I added tomato paste, I'm not sure what happened(too high of heat or??)but the sauce then curdled. I was disappointed as I've been looking for a good tomato cream sauce for a while, so I scoured my collection and found this: One recipe required you to reduce 1 cup of chicken stock to a 1/2 cup and then in a separate pan reduce 1 cup of cream to a 1/2 cup and then blend together and add the tomatoes. Another recipe uses a 28oz can of tomatoes with puree and just a 1/2 cup of cream. Both of these seem as though they would be much more flavorful then this recipe.

I've made this recipe several times with the following changes: deglaze the pan with white wine after sauteeing the shallots, garlic and sundried tomates, and adding roughly 1 T of dried dill the last few minutes of cooking.

made this last night and it turned out great. I flattened the chicken and cut it into small chunks, adding them back into the sauce to simmer after the cream had boiled a little. Also added a handful of chopped fresh basil when the cream went in, plus a little paprika, and served over fresh fettucini noodles. I think the key to the flavor is chopping up the tomatoes small enough that you get some in every bite. This is a great sauce, if you know how to play with it.

Rating: 4
I chose this recipe specifically for the sauce ... didn't bother cooking the chicken. I served the sauce over homemade ravioli and it was INCREDIBLE! I only used 1 tablespoon of olive oil and after sauteing the shallots, garlic, & tomatoes I added a few tablespoons of white wine, then the cream. It thickened beautifully in about 8-10 minutes.

This is definately a crowd pleaser. I added more sun-dried tomatoes and added black calmatoe olives which made it more elegant.

Loved this recipe. Probably one of my favorites on the site so far... Simple, tasty and fairly healthy (minus the cream...) I served it over fresh linguini and it was fantastic.

Also, add more sundried tomatos than it calls for. It needs more...

I had high hopes for this recipe after reading the changes a lot of the reviewers made. I increased the garlic, used dried/rehydrated sun dried tomatoes, and subbed Fat Free Half & Half for the cream, added 1/2 cup tomato sauce, and added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. It was OK, but it was still kind of bland! Sauce was way too chunky for our tastes. If I ever made it again I'd puree at least half of the shallot/garlic/tomato mixture. I even used Penzey's Northwoods Fire Seasoning on the chicken to give it some kick, but I still wasn't thrilled! Oh well, personal tastes!

This is a tasty, quick weeknight meal. I halved the amount of chicken (cooking for only 2) and seasoned with salt, pepper and basil. I used more garlic and had to substitute white onions for the shallots and added mushrooms. And, OK, I used more sun dried tomatoes. I had some red pepper flavored oil on hand so I substituted 1 T of that and tossed some cayenne into the 1/2 and 1/2...(out of cream.) The sauce is the main player here. Clearly, I didn't prepare the dish as originally intended but it was very nice served with pasta, nice tomatoes topped with basil and oil and crusty bread. Next time I'm trying this with veal medallions....works for me!

So, what I am saying is I needed the extra shallots and basil, etc.

I have to admit this was very good. Don't use chicken breasts with the bone, as they take _forever_ to cook. I used regular onion for the shallot, and plain dried reconstituted (not oil-packed) sundried tomatoes, w/2 T tomato paste, to cut down on the oil. I used a lot (maybe 2 c) of white wine to help the chicken cook and deglaze the pan, and this added to the flavor of the sauce. I also upped the garlic and used the cayenne pepper as suggested. The sauce, with all the wine and garlic and extra chicken juices, was really flavorful. I served this with white rice and veggie stuffed tomatoes (room temp.) and do not think it would be good at all over pasta. I would make it again, though it is too rich to eat frequently.

This was really easy but looked and tasted like it took a lot of effort. This is one of my favorite dishes!

I used someon's suggestion and added mushrooms. There should have been more volume to the sauce since I served it over linguine. Great quick meal.

The missing ingredient mentioned below is cayenne pepper, which brings out the other flavors as well as addig a subtle kick. Add a generous 1/8 tsp with the cream.

Sooo easy and sooo delicious!!! I served it with angel hair pasta and steamed asparagus. My husband actually licked his plate! Great dish to make for company.

What a wonderful, quick recipe. I took the suggestions from other reviewers and doubled the sauce, and served it over short rigatoni. My husband and I loved it and deemed it a keeper. Next time we'll share with company.

Hi there. Yes I found the recipe nice and simple and very tasty. I added the wine as recommended and also mushrooms and some fresh basil. I also seared the chicken only in the pan and then finished cooking it in the oven to make it a little tenderer than just pan frying. Very yummy. Thanks for the tip!!!

I would rate it a 3-1/2 fork if I could. Relative easy to make for something this tasty. An excellent work/weeknight dinner. Although there seems to be a subtle ingredient or seasoning missing to which I can not quite seem to quite pinpoint. Anyone else have this experince? Or is it just me? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

i added mushrooms to the sauce and the dish was quite delicious and easy. definitely one to be done again, not because it was the best dish i have done, but because of its simplicity. you get pretty good value out of the dish for the amount of effort required. that probably is a great priority of mine when entertaining.

Another hit recipe from this web site. Like others before me I added wine to increase the volume of the sauce. It is also well noting that if you are cooking chicken breasts for only a short time it is well either / or cut through them horizontally or flatten them with a meat bat, but do it again ,so easy and so quick.

I've made this recipe several times and it is now my wife's favorite. I tried doubling the recipe with less success, probably because I didn't let the sauce boil down and thicken. I add a side of roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes for a great meal.

Definitely will make this dish again. I pounded the chicken, also. I agree the sauce should be doubled. I used my own homemade dried tomates. My fiance and I both loved the flavor. I think I will try it over pasta next time.

I pounded the chicken breasts so that they would cook through and then put them back in the pan to simmer when I added the cream. I also used sun-dried tomatoes with herbs. Delicious! The next time I make these, I will double the sauce as some of the commenters recommended.

THIS RECIPE WAS DELICIOUS AND FUN TO MAKE. I DID IT A LITTLE DIFFERENT THOUGH. I WAS A LITTLE UNEASY ABOUT THE CHICKEN NOT BEING COOKED THOROUGHLY SO AFTER I DID AS THE DIRECTIONS REQUIRED, I CUT IT INTO CHUNKS AND PUT IT IN WITH THE SAUCE AND LET IT SIMMER FOR ABOUT 30MIN. I THEN PUT THE SAUCE AND CHICKEN OVER FETTUCINE NOODLES AND SERVED ALONG SIDE CAULIFLOWER. MY HUSBAND WAS EVEN IMPRESSED!

This was an easier version of the November 94 Bon Appetit recipe. Of the two, I much preferred the other. Definitely double the sauce, and better with pasta than with rice.

This recipe is fantastic...friends made it for me at a dinner party and I demanded the recipe. The way it was made for me was without the chicken, over bow-tie pasta. I added shrimp, mushrooms, and peas when I made it. Outstanding dish!!

My husband and I found this a bit bland but my children loved it. Since there are so few ingredients, I would be sure to use only the best in this recipe. For example, only fresh garlic and the best SD tomatoes. Additionally, I would pound the chicken for added tenderness. All in all, it needs a little more zing.

This was so easy to make and so good. Even my ten year old liked it and she doesn't like most of the new recipes I try. I served it with pasta, but forgot to double the sauce recipe. Next time I'm going to try making it with whole milk instead of cream to cut down on the fat.

Everybody who at at my house this weekend loved this dish. People literally cleaned their plates. I doubled the sauce recipe, used sun-dried tomatoes marinated in herbed olive oil and added some of the flavored oil to the skillet, and deglazed the pan with a little white wine. Served with angel hair pasta and sprinkled a little fresh basil on top--it was great.

This dish is wonderful for company! I took the suggestion of other reviewers and added tomato paste. Made it attractive and added to the flavor. I also doubled the sauce and served it over tri-colored bow-tie pasta which was a great choice for presentation. Tip - pound the chicken breasts a little, they look better.

Rating: 3
The recipe was quite good, although I did make modifications. First, after cooking the chicken in olive oil on each side, I added Italian Herbed chicken broth to poach them which ensured they cooked through. Then for the sauce instead of using cream, I used low fat milk and the remaining broth. Based on an earlier review, I doubled the sauce and there was plenty for both the chicken and the spaghetti served with it. Finally, as a time saver I prepared the sundried tomatoes, garlic and shallot as a mixture ahead of time and placed in the fridge until needed.

I used my own sun-dried tomatoes from the garden and plumped them in hot water for 10-15 minutes, drained, then chopped. We loved the sauce and it was better left over after the flavors melded for 24 hours. Would double the sauce next time as it was good left over on rice.

This was a very delicious dish and I will make it again. Next time, however, I'll follow other cooks' suggestion and double the sauce as the recipe as is leaves you a little short. Incidently, the leftovers made an incredible chicken on bagel sandwich.

The chicken breasts I used (6oz)were raw on the inside and done on the outside. I had to finish them in the oven. Also, had I not marinated them in Lawry's garlic/herb marinade, they would have been rather bland. The sauce also required seasoning. With so many changes, I would not make the recipe again as published.

Excellent Dinner for 2 or more. I made a few additions per other reviews. I used 2 cups heavy cream, used 6 roasted garlic cloves, deglazed the pan twice with 1/4 Port wine after cooking breasts and before adding cream. Added fresh mushrooms and small amount of fresh basil , oregano and thyne. Don't forget salt & pepper. Served with spaghetti and Mesculum salad greens. I am going to heat up leftovers now...LOVED THIS ONE!!

Wonderful. I had already marinated my chicken in Italian Dressing, so this added some zip to it. I also used sun dried tomatoes with herbs. I served it with vermicelli with olive oil and herbs and salad and foccacia with sun dried tomatoes and garlic. I will make this again and again.

ABSOLUTELY DIVINE as my husband put it!!! My husband & I both just loved it; I'm making it for company next! I did make a few slight adjustments: 4 lg-med. sized shallots instead of 2, 8 med. garlic cloves and I used half & half instead of the whipping cream. I also use sun dried tomatoes that are packed in an herbed olive oil; this I think makes a big difference in taste -vs- plain olive oil. When sauteeing remaining ingrds. I did shallots, then tomatoes finally garlic; if not shallots & garlic brown way to fast. EXCELLENT & So Easy! Next time I'm doubling the sauce.

I was going to make the Chicken with Sun-dried Tomato-cream Sauce BA 11/94 and used this one instead. The reviews of the former(95% in favor) complained of not enough flavor or garlic this recipes has it all. My husband and I loved it. I substituted evap. skim milk for the cream, deglazed the pan with white wine and added basil. In the end it was really a combination of the two recipe. I doubled the sauce and served it (whole breasts&sauce) over bow tie pasta. Easy recipe with great flavor. You have to like sun-dried tomatoes.

My husband and I loved this dish. I found myself wishing that I had made a little more sauce to put on the rice I made with it. It was so good that I will make it for company the next time. I didn't have the oil packed sun-dried tomatoes so I used rehydrated sun-dried tomatoes and they were fine.

This is a very simple, tasty recipe. It goes great with a variety of side dishes and has an elegant look to it. My chicken wasn't as moist as I would have preferred, but I think that was my fault not the recipe's!

Yummy!!! Because I wanted more sauce, I only used 3 chicken breast halves, and sauteed them in only 2 T oil. Once I removed the chicken from the pan, there really wasn't enough oil (even after adding the 1 T oil the recipe calls for), so I added about 1 T of the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes. When the dish was finished, I cut up the chicken into chunks before serving, so that the sauce would coat more of the chicken. One last note (just to prove what an idiot I am about cooking), be sure to add SALT & PEPPER when adjusting the taste. Dingbat that I am, I finished the dish, but thought it was a bit flat. Someone then suggested SALT (duh!!!) - all the difference in the world!

Excellent, simple dish. I too, added a touch tomato paste but I also deglazed the skillet with a little cognac after sauteeing the vegetables and then added chicken broth which I reduced two times before adding the cream. I also added some half-moons of zucchini for color and texture. The result was deceptively elegant.

This recipe received rave reviews in my home. The chicken was moist and tender, the sauce very pleasing to the palate. I served this with risotto, steamed green beans, a salad, and a crusty bread. Excellent--a definite addition to my recipe collection!

The chicken breasts were tender and moist. However, the sauce left a lot to be desired in taste and quantity. Perhaps I missed something; but, one cup of liquid to 1/2 c. dried tomatoes, 2 large shallotts and 4 cloves of garlic gave scanty sauce with flavor that was much too strong. In fact, we ate the chicken and discarded the small amount of sauce. If I ever made this again, I certainly would increase the amount of cream.

This was a big hit. One of my guests pronounced it the second best chicken dish she has ever had, and the other two guests practically fought over the last piece. A keeper.

My sister made this recipe twice in one week she loved it so much so I decided to try it. It was very tasty, the sun-dried tomatoes added a great tang to it. I added a tablespoon extra of tomatoes to give it more zing.
