Oh, yum! This made way more sauce than needed for the chicken recipe it accompanies, which meant leftovers! It's even better the second day, and is super-easy to make.

Great as a sause and just as great as a side dish!

I made with the spiced chicken breasts and it was a very nice compliment. It's a keeper.
