patsjapan clearly did not eat this dish or a xenophobe. it tastes very American (as if that matters)--in fact I made it in January, unaware of any Bon apetit thanksgiving connection and the comments i got were all about how good it would be prepared the way we traditionally prepare yams. It was delicious! I immediatley went out a bought more of this delicious winter squash.

Awesome! I'm not as opinionated or narrowminded as patsjapan below. Granted, I'm not the official magistrate dictator of Thanksgiving like they apparently are, but I found this dish satisfying, beautiful and a great addition to my Thanksgiving table. I really wanted a "Bay Area" inspired meal, and when I saw this I knew it would be the PERFECT dish to bring a little far east flavor to the holiday table. I added a little water as I processed the squash, as mine baked up a little dry. Other than this, I think this is a perfectly written recipe. The end result is a very nutty, vibrant squash dish with great flavor and color. Okay, I have to dig at patsjapan one more time, just because they were so gripey in their review. All squash originated in meso-America. Kobocha made its way to Asia and was introduced to Japan by Portugese sailors in the 16th century. What better way to celebrate Thanksgiving...the first multicultural holiday...than with a vegetable that came from America and was shared with Asians by Europeans? This dish is a great illustration of what happens when cultures share the food and flavors of their native lands...very cool.

If you like ginger and squash, this is delicious! Made it with 2% milk instead of cream and it was great. Definitely will make it again!

Bon Apetit is trying too hard! Trendy is NOT Thanksgiving...especially when adapting a different - Japanese - edible squash - pumpkin - to a truly American feast. Better to just serve turkey chop suey! At least that is Asian food not dressed up to masquerade as all AMerican!
