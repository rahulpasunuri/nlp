This is a really awesome tuna sandwich. The combination of basil, lemon, artichoke and tuna is wonderful. Definitely going to be the only way we eat canned tuna from now on!

I normally don't eat sandwiches, but we were going on a car trip along a beverage trail and I needed to make something that would be easy to take along AND go well with beer if we decided to eat our lunch at one of the breweries. This was perfect! It was a breeze to make, the flavor was outstanding, and we didn't have to worry about it getting soggy in the cooler! In fact we had leftovers the next day and although the bread had absorbed a lot more of the juices by then, and the lemon flavor became a lot more powerful, the crustiness of the baguette held it all together nicely. I will definitely be making these again.

I did a variation on this and I loved it so much I thought I'd share it in a pseudo-review. I sliced a baguette, spread a little mayo on one side, topped that side with canned tuna. The other side had a mixture of olive oil, lemon and crushed garlic drizzled into the bread with chopped artichoke hearts on it. The artichokes came from some I had trimmed and steamed in the oil, lemon, garlic mixture the night before. This was a fantastic way to use up what was left of them. It was so delicious that I'm planning on doing this with leftover artichokes from now on!

Awesome recipe, I used tuna in water actually and also added mayo (home made) and brushed the bread with artichoke paste, YUMMY!

so delicious and a great change from normal tuna salad with mayo. i did drain most of the oil from the tuna, and most of the oil from the artichokes to keep it a little less oily. and added basil to the salad in addition to in the sandwich. yum yum.
