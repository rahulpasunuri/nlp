This was FABULOUS! We eat wild birds a lot (duck, pheasant, dove, & quail) and this was my favorite. We used skinned birds and I put about 2 teaspoons of the sauce in the pan while the quail were cooking and there was no need to use more sauce afterwards. Finger licking good! (Didn't make the vegetables).
