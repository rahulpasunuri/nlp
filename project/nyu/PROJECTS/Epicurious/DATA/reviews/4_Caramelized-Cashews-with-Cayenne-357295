We made these twice and they were a huge hit both times. Double the cayenne. Don't use cumin powder if at all possible. The taste may be the same, but the little crunchy bits from the seeds adds much-desired texture. Cook a little longer than you think you should. The nuts have a good buffer from the maple syrup, so they won't burn, and if you don't cook it enough, the syrup will make them stick together. Don't make more than a day ahead. They'll form into a sticky ball and you'll end up chiseling them apart because you won't be able to stop eating them. Out of the thirty or so people who've tried these, only one thought they were "too weird" and didn't like them. Everyone else went nuts for them.

Usually adventurous with tastes (and a lover of cumin), i thought this had great potential. But i was wrong. Granted, I used a mixture of nuts but I don't think that was the problem... the cumin was overpowering and even when i diluted the recipe it didn't improve. When i tried to sweeten it more to balance, also didn't improve. I love epicurious and usually find so many great recipes here but this one is a pass for me.

This is a really easy and really really good recipe. I ended up using Grade B maple syrup, and they caramelized nicely. These are sweet with just the right hint of heat. The cumin seeds complimented the spicy-sweet flavor well.

Delicious and easy. A keeper!

The most difficult part of this recipe was washing the spoon used to stir the nuts during baking. Other than that, the recipe is simple and delicious. Parchment paper makes this even simpler - no need to transfer to aluminum foil.

Awesome recipe! I just modified it a bit for ease of preparation and to add to the yumminess factor. First of all, I subbed about 3/4 tsp. ground cumin for the cumin seeds, and added some freshly ground black pepper for more kick. Mixed these spices plus cayenne into maple syrup, then tossed in about 3 cups of mixed nuts: cashews, pecans, and almonds(all from Costco). Spread it out on parchment(wax) paper - no need for foil and spray oil! Left it in the oven for about 25 minutes on 350 degrees, tossing every few minutes. Sprinkled some kosher salt on top when almost done. Then let it cool for half hour on wax paper in cookie sheet. They were absolutely divine, especially the pecans! ENJOY!!!!!

Delicious recipe...one comment tho. You can stretch the recipe by either reducing the maple syrup or if you need a lot, for a party, then just increase the nuts, cumin, cayenne and salt. For example, I just made it with a huge bag of Costco almonds. Used 1/2 c Maple syrup, and tripled the seasonings. Excellent!!!

These are so easy and a bit unusual in a delicious way. I was not able to find grade B maple syrup so I bought the darkest grade A. It's fine, but I can see why the more intense maple flavor of the B grade would be an improvement. I would not substitute ground cumin for the seeds. You would take away that little extra dimension of crunch that the seeds provide.

Super easy and crazy tasty! The only problem I had was keeping sneaky fingers away before the party...they could have easily been eaten up right off the baking sheet! I used ground cumin, instead of the whole seeds and covered the baking sheet in foil for easy cleanup! Aside from the cashews, I always have the ingredients in stock. An easy, versatile crowd pleaser.

A great snack and appetizer to have sitting out in bowls at a party. I saved the salt and added it after removing the nuts from the oven. I used ground cumin rather than cumin seed. Easy and great for making ahead of time.

The technique was great but the cumin seed was way too overpowering. I would leave it out next time and use crushed black pepper instead.

I didn't have cumin seeds, so I added 3/4 tsp ground cumin. I try to be conservative with salt in general, but add the 1 tsp as directed (I made with less salt and ended up adding more at the end---you really need it to complement the sweetness). Great recipe.

These are really good. I also make them with pecans and they are just as delicious. My cross country running teenagers and college student love them as a snack.

This was absolutely delicious! Only suggestion is to mix all the spices and syrup before adding the cashews so that the flavors are more evenly distributed.

YUM. Delicious. I used salted cashews, plus the salt listed in the recipe, and I think they are well-balanced. (Not overly salty.) I hope we still have some left for the superbowl tomorrow!

Delicious! The maple syrup gets dark and very caramelized, so that the cashews are crunchy and candied. The cayenne and salt along with the maply syrup are a great combo. Perfect sweet and salty snack.
