Like most people, I doubled the spices and they still weren't very spicy; but they were still delicious. I brought these to a party and the guests went crazy for them. If you take the word 'spicy" out of the title you'll have a fabulous snack without disappointment!

I doubled the spices like everyone else and they were perfect. This made a great nibble at a 60th birthday/cocktail party. Several people asked for the recipe.

I tripled the spices, added 2 TB sugar and 1 TB cinnimon and baked at 325 for 15-20 minutes. Good, but not the taste that i wanted.

Just made these and am very underwhelmed... not horrible, but not even almost great (like a previous reviewer, was hoping to give these as a gift and will have to try another recipe... this batch will be for my garbage-disposal bf.) Way better spicy nuts recipes out there.

I doubled the tabasco and worcestershire to increase the spiciness and loved them.

When I made this last year I used walnuts and they were excellent. This year I used pecans, and although they're favored at the office, I think pecans overpower the spice. So try walnuts.....

Needs more flavor and spice. Not bad, not great.

Made these today to give as a present. I have to find another present because they are not very good. I even added more hot sauce and they still are not spicy. They are very bland actually.

Not enough spice! I recomend doubling the tobasco and worcs. sauce. Also, if you have some Creole seasoning like Tony Cherchere's, use it! If not, try a little red pepper, etc. The hotness really brings out the sweetness in the pecans - good at parties and big family dinners for snacking.

I love spicy food, but the majority of my family is not as eager. These nuts have just enough kick to keep me happy and are mild enough to satisfy people who don't like it so hot.

I make these (or a variation of) every year at Christmas. They are always a big hit. Never seem to last long.

I make these all the time for parties - they have a savory taste that goes great with wine or beer.
