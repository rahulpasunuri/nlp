Just made these, absolutely what I was looking for to satisfy my molasses cookie craving. Very simple to make, I didn't even wait for them in the fridge, but rolled them into balls and smooshed them a little with the palm of my hand. For the frosting, water works just as well as egg whites. These will be my official go-to recipe!

I made these cookies for Christmas and they were my favorite this year. They are crunchy and spicy and the cardamon gives a lovely flavor. I didn't decorate exactly as directed and instead used a star cookie cutter and lightly glazed.

I made this cookies as a holiday gift for my friends. They look very pretty with the icing, and everyone loved how they tasted. The dough does get hard to work with as it warms up so be sure to chill it long enough. If it starts to get soft, just stick it back into the freezer for a copule minutes. If you are worried about samonella in raw egg whites, water works fine too. Just watch how much you add, and stop when you like the consistancy.

This is a great tasting spice cookie. I didn't cut out shapes, instead I shaped some into crescent moons and others into jam thumbprints. A good quality cherry jam is an excellent match.

I didn't havce cookie cutters, so I just rolled the dough into balls and baked them like normal cookies. They were so good! I can't believe they came out of my oven. Veyr chewy and moist and flavorful and the icing added a really nice touch.

These cookies were good, but I expected them to be more flavorful than they were. They weren't exactly what I was wanting at the time, but they are tasty and elegant. I'll probably make them again.

These cookies have been a Christmas standard of mine since 1990 when I used to subscribe to Bon Apetit magazine. (Thank you epicurious.com for archiving so many wonderful recipes because I seem to have misplaced my dog-eared copy of the 1990 Holiday issue and I'm oh so grateful to have found this recipe online.) My suggestions for making these cookies? First, I work with at least two cookie sheets if not three. Second, split the dough into three parts and while the dough is soft, roll it out to the desired thickness between two layers of plastic wrap and lay these on a large plate or cookie sheet in your fridge. Third, keep the rolled out dough in the fridge until you are ready to use it. Once the dough warms up it is very difficult to use, but when it's cold, cutting these cookies is a breeze. Finally add the egg white a bit at a time to the powdered sugar depending on how thick you'd like the glaze to be. Enjoy! My friends and family always love these cookies.
