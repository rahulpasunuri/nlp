I added salt & pepper to veggies, and fresh baby spinach, and used high quality mozz slices instead of the cheese blend. I also love these frozen crusts I get at whole foods that are imported from italy - Pizza Romana. Have made this repeatedly and everyone loves it every time. Enjoy!

Great recipe, looked amazing. I would just suggest some salt and pepper, and I really liked another chefs suggestion of adding rosemary, chili pepper flakes etc. to the garlic oil. It made it fantastic!

I preroasted the vegetables, adding mushrooms and yellow squash. I used a homemade pizza dough and spread the uncooked dough with pesto before adding the veggies and cheese. 500 degrees for 8 minutes. Fantastic!

I love this recipe and make it often. It's a great pizza for the working week - quick, easy, fairly healthy with all those veggies, and yummy!

I realy liked this recipe after a few changes. I used a store bought cust (time saver) and added garlic, red pepper flakes, rosemary, and olive oil to the vegies before I roasted them. I also added a thin layer of sause to the crust. Cooked the vegies half-way then added them the prepared crust and finished baking. Yummy!!!

My meat loving husband enjoyed this pizza as much as I. Used olive oil flavored with red pepper on the crust and added sliced mushrooms. Crust was done before the vegetables. I too enjoyed cold leftovers the next day for lunch.

This pizza was okay for a quick weeknight dinner but lacked flavor and interest. I tossed the vegetables in a garlic and herb oil thinking that would add a little. I also added pepperoni.

Really good - quick and easy to make after work. My meat-loving family liked it, too. Could probably toss the vegetables with some chopped garlic, or in Italian dressing instead. Yes, the crust was done a few minutes before the vegetables.

I thought this pizza was very good. I added a thin coating of pizza sauce which I thought enhanced the flavors.

It's so great. I'm adding this to my recipe box. It's the perfect recipe to use up veggies in the fridge. A quickie.

I've already made this pizza three times since I found the recipe....it's just yummy and a nice twist. I love to make it and bring the leftovers for lunch. I use a pizza dough recipe from the August 1998 issue for this.

Easy to prepare and nutritious. The pizza crust was ready about 5 min. before the veggies. I included peeled eggplant slices which worked well.
