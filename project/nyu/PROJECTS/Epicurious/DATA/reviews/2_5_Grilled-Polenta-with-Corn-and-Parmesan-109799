We really like this recioe, although I pump it up with more onion, more corn kernels and definitely more parmigiano. I like to grate about 1 cup of the cheese into the polenta before stirring in the corn and onion.

I wish I had had this month's Bon Appetit when making this. The tip to make cutting corn off the cob easy (with the end secured in the hole of a bundt pan) would really have come in handy.

Nice and easy, and so many possible variations. It's not bad just served as polenta, but the grilling and little bit of Parmesan makes it especially good.

Loved it. Instead of water I use vegetable broth. It gives the polenta a great taste. I also buy polenta from the bulk bins at the store. It only takes five minutes to stir, and then throw it on the grill for added flavor. Excellent with some homemade marinera and a salad.

I would suggest substituting White Corn Meal for Stone Ground as it cooks in about 10 minutes vs. 30 per the recipe. I also used fresh white corn and cooking spray in lieu of brushing with oil which worked really well. Don't skimp on the parmesan. It can keep for a day or more before grilling. Definitely crispy and wonderful as a side dish!

Perfect accompaniment for a flavorful meat entree. I served this as a side to Grilled Porterhouse with Tarragon-Tomato Salad from this site. Excellent dinner. The polenta thickened up in a lot less than 30 minutes. I don't know if that is because I halved the recipe or?

Used fresh local corn, made early in the day & threw it on the BBQ that evening. It was a v. good side for my spicy marinated sirloin steaks.

Hmm. I made this for a dinner party last weekend and it was a big hit. Everyone in the group that cooks asked for the recipe. I did use extra garlic and added butter while I baked the polenta. I know the recipe calls for cooking it on the stove top, but believe me the oven is much easier and tidier. You only need stir it once. I can't imagine that baking it would have made much of a difference in taste, however.

Recipe is pretty much the traditional northern Italian version. Note to the other reviewers - polenta is supposed to be bland. It is designed to be served in a similar way to rice or noodles under a stew or cacciatore.

I took the suggestions of the previous reviewers and added more garlic and cheese for flavor. I would also add a bit of butter at the end. I grilled and fried it, added fresh parmesan and served with a side of marinara. A spicy salsa might also work well. I would make this again.

This dish had absolutely no taste - very bland - would not recommend even though the picture looks nice

one of the blandest-tasting polenta ever. to make it appetising, more garlic, butter and parmesan should be added to the mixture itself - changing the recipe completely...definitely won't be a second time.
