This was a very nice change from your regular mashed potatoes. I made them earlier in the day then popped them in the oven with the pork with gorganzola sauce recipe that is also on this site. Make a wonderful New Year's Eve dinner.

Served this for Christmas dinner with turkey and prime rib. Omitted the sun-dried tomatoes, then followed the recipe exactly. Prefer to use freshly grated nutmeg and found that this really enhanced parmesan cheese flavor. Everyone raved at these and didn't even notice that I hadn't made gravy. Fabulous and the best that I've ever tasted! Definitely a keeper!

Wow! Who would have thought a few extra ingredients like parmesan, sun-dried tomatoes, and fresh nutmeg would make mashed potatoes so wonderful? Serve them piping hot and get ready for the compliments!

I've been cooking for over 40 years, and always try new recipes for mashed potatoes. This one exceeded our expectations. I did use julienne cut sun- dried tomatoes in oil because that's what I had - omitted the olive oil in the recipe, and all turned out fine. A real keeper!

My family absolutely adored this dish. They all had seconds. I followed the recipe and I know that I'll make it time and again.

Really good! Made enough just for 2 people. Made the recipe a little different...used oil packed sun dried tomatoes, only used a little milk and butter, & didn't bake it. Added some chives. Really flavorful. Served it along w/some roasted asparagus, steaks w/roasted garlic & gorgonzola butter.

These were fabulous! I had never baked mashed potatoes either, and they came out great. I am having my boyfriend's parents over soon, and these will be on the menu. My boyfriend liked the flavor, but not pieces of tomato, but there weren't so many that he couldn't easily put them to the side. Much more flavorful than I had expected, I was pleasantly surprised.

I'm really surprised that more people haven't tried this recipe. My husband and I thought it was excellent. I didn't reinvent the recipe but made a couple of changes due to timing and what I had on hand. I did not need milk or half and half because 2T butter was enough to make the potatoes creamy. I also didn't see the part about putting them in the oven so I mashed the potatoes, added the parmesan and tomatoes, and served them. Excellent flavor, and much easier and faster. Definitely company worthy. I may try the oven method just for comparison.

This was pretty good. I added garlic and shredded some cheddar cheese on top instead of more parmesan. I would probably make it again but not impressive enough for company.

These were easy and delicious. I had never made baked mashed potatos before - it was nice to be able to put the dish together a day ahead of time. I will definitely make these again!!
