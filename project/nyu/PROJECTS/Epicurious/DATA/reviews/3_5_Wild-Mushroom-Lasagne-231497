This was ridiculously time consuming...between all the chopping and individual sautees, and standing by the stove whisking the sauce, it was the preparation that went on forever. For the effort, the end result, while tasty, was entirely anticlimactic.

I didn't have dried porcinis so I used dried shitakes. I doubled the amount of mushrooms but still had barely enough for a single layer of mushrooms. What I mean is that I think you have to spread the mushroom sauce too thinly to get the 3 layers out of it. I'll make more sauce next time. Everyone raved about.

I am not giving this recipe any forks. Even with some of the suggested revisions I found this recipe to be lacking in every possible way. The texture was thin and soupy, the flavor was flat and unsatisfying, the overall appearance...Melba toast, and to top it off, the amount of prep far exceeded the return. I do not think of minimalism when I think of meatless recipes, I think of combining tastes and textures to create interesting, exciting, and innovative outcomes that even the most staunch carnivore will crave. Would not recommend this recipe to anyone. There are too many fabulous meatless recipes available to waste one second considering this one!

This was not the recipe I had thought I was making; there is another "wild mushroom lasagne" recipe from Gourmet, but from 1999. This one seems pretty much your regulation lasagna minus the meat. Calling for only one kind of mushroom belies the moniker of "wild", and this, while good, was nothing spectacular like I was hoping. Average is what I would call this.

Wow. This is a wonderful light dish. I added twice the mushrooms and 1/2 the reserved liquid.

this was delish! I've made a mushroom white lasagna before, but really liked the addition of the tomatoes to this one. you could add more mushrooms if you wanted to, but not entirely necessary. be sure to allow the sauce to thicken. my dad and I made this alongside an Italian sausage lasagna (for the vegetarians) and everyone liked this one just as much as the meat version.

A good lasagna for an alternate to the traditional. The porcini mushrooms added a smoky and earthy flavour which seemed unusual with the tomatoes. Omitting the mushroom's soaking broth may reduce the competition between the acidic tomatoes and earthy mushrooms.

Made this as one of many courses at a Memorial Day party. It was a great option for our vegetarian guests - the bechamel recipe alone is a keeper! Also, I made my own lasagna noodles which added to the dish.

Very good with the bechamel sauce...my only change would be to boost the amount of mushrooms from 1 to 2 oz. Despite it's name, the recipe is more tomato- heavy than mushroom- heavy. Make sure to foil your oven- this dish will bubble over!

I read several reviews and added Cremini mushrooms but it was still a very bland disappointing dish. I won't be making it again.

This dish is ideal for an elegant appetizer but way too rich for a main course. I made it for a dinner party and my guests loved it but I couldn't finish it. I tried it again for a pot-luck but it does not reheat well and turned out dry and chewy.

I followed what other users suggested...added some fresh crimini mushrooms and cooked them with the onions. I also only used 1 cup water...would have been too runny. Turned out great!

This recipe required a fair amount of work, but turned out decidedly bland. There are also some oddities in the ingredient amounts. Even though I doubled the amount of mushrooms, there were far too few to add much flavor. Also, 5oz of grated parmesan is much more than 1.5 cups.

I used no-boil pasta with no problems and sauteed fresh crimini mushrooms instead of using dried porcini. It got compliments from my meat-eating fiancee, who normally shuns vegetarian dishes, so this is definitely a keeper.

Excellent dish, worth the effort. I also added cooked mushrooms to the layers and grated fontina cheese per earlier reviews. Next time I will try no-boil lasagne and see what happens. Note: This recipe fills the 13x9 pan to the top so watch for overflow while cooking.

Oops! In my last comments, forgot that in addition to using less dried porcini and water, you make up the mushroom difference with an 8oz carton of sliced baby bellas or mixed mushrooms of your choice! Otherwise, better keep the full 1 oz of dried porcini.

Really liked this and only modified it somewhat. I found it didn't even take 2 hours to make (alone) but I made everything simultaneously instead of sequentially. The changes: mince garlic and (obviously) keep in the bechamel. Use 1/2 oz dried porcini reconstituted with 1 c boiling water (still need to boil sauce longer than 30 min to get a decent, non-runny consistency). Use 1 c finely grated parmesan and on the middle 2 layers, also add to the parmesan goat cheese crumbles (mine come in a 3 oz package and I used the non-seasoned ones). Since there were only 2 of use, we had leftovers for 2 more meals and it froze well!

Made this for vegetarian relatives and they really enjoyed it. I couldn't understand why the only mushrooms were the dried ones, so I added some fresh sliced criminis at the same time as the onions. Also some Fontina as one reviewer suggested. I didn't think it was fabulous, and certainly not worth the prep time but with two in the kitchen it goes a bit faster. Three forks because the guests loved it.

Took closer to 3 hours start to finish, but well worth it (and fun to make). In addition to the dried, I added 1 10-oz package of thinly sliced cremini mushrooms (threw them in at the same time as the onions)--worked out perfect!

Used fresh pocini mushrooms as they are in season here and used extra button mushrooms as a filler. Increasing the mushrooms to 800 grams. I don't understand why no no-boil lasagne,it was all I had on hand and worked perfectly!

We loved this recipe. Took reviewers advice about adding more mushrooms and using less water, but pretty much followed the recipe. It really looked and tasted great and was worth the extra work. I was serving it to some really good cooks (I'm not one) and I was proud of this dish.

This was a hit! Excellent flavors, the only change I made was to sauté fresh mushrooms with the onions.

Eventhough it took me a while to prepare this dish, it is worth the effort. It was absoloutley delicious. Its sweetness complemented the broccoli Raab side dish with its bitter taste. For spicier dish, you could substitute red pepper flakes instead of sugar in the sauce.

Great lasagna. I added a pound of wild mushrooms to the sauce and did not use the dried mushroom rendering juice. This yielded a beautifully light lasagna that isn't too wet and tastes of mushrooms but not too strongly. Yum. Definitely making this one again.

I made this last night for a small gathering and everyone loved it. The bechamel sauce thicken up beautifully. I did saute a variety of wild mushrooms and added those to the layers. Used a high quality parmesan cheese also added a sharp fontina to the mix. A pinch of red pepper flakes to the tomato sauce and it was wonderful. I will keep this one in my recipe box and make it again.

Use only 1 cup of water to reconstitute the mushrooms. Bake it longer..I baked it 1 and 1/4 hours at 400. it was perfect.

I had never made lasagne before and I was a bit nervous trying this recipe. The bechamel sauce didn't thicken enough, but it still worked out perfectly and everyone who tried it absolutely loved it. I only baked for about 15 minutes, which was perfect. The lack of heavy cheese (besides parmesan) made it an incredibly light meal, and brought out the powerful mushroom flavor in the sauce. I will definitely make this again!

Like others, I thought the two sauces would cancel out, but, it did not happen. I have eaten other recipes using just the white sauce, but this added the moisture needed. Cook the sauce longer to take out more moisture and add fresh wild mushrooms-also, don't scrimp on good parmesan-I used a little more than the stated recipe amount.-Great recipe!

I was really looking forward to this recipe. The combo of the white bechamel and red tomato sauces sounded divine. Unfortunately, I thought the flavors cancelled each other out. The bechamel is a fairly delicate sauce, and it seemed to get lost in the stronger tomato. Also, I found that the end result was too wet.

This was a total hit, and I agree with the reviewer before me, it is a little labor intensive. But it wouldn't stop me from making it again, it was fantastic. If you've got the time, it is a great dish (just make someone else do all the dishes).

A little labor intensive for me, but well worth it. The flavor was fantastic. I, too, was worried about how few ingredients there were, but it was just fabulous.

I loved this recipe - easy to prepare for a dinner party. I adjusted the recipe and added a can of sliced mushrooms between the layers to give it more body and more of a mushroom flavor. Guests raved!!!

This was surprisingly delicious. I had never made a lasagna with so little ingredients before. Seconds were in order for everyone. I will definitely make this again.

I found this recipe to be among the most boring lasagnes I have made. I followed the recipe to a tee, save for one change (1% milk I had in the fridge for the whole milk). The sauce lacked flavor (I used Trader Joe's canned, whole plum tomatoes). I can't figure out where the mushroom flavor disappeared ... used all the liquid. Curious!?
