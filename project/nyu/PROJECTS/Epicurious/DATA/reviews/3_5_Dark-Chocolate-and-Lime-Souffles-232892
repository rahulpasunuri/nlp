My mother is, in some circles, known for her spectacular desserts. However, I have enjoyed this simple dessert more than any of the others that she has made. As far as I know, she follows the recipe closely. The limey whipped cream is crucial.

I used the zest and juice from three limes in the chocolate, the juice from two limes in the egg whites and the juice from one lime (total of 6 limes) in the whipped cream. My wife couldn't decide tonight between a key lime cheesecake and chocolate souffle, so I showed her this recipe and simply added more lime to the mix and it was the right decision. I cooked them for 13 min at 400-f and they were perfect.

I baked these for 10 1/2 minutes, and that was perfect - be sure to serve them immediately, as they continue to cook aferwards and will dry out if left too long. Other than that, absolutely delicious, and not too rich. Will add more lime next time, though.

After reading the reviews I added a tsp of lime oil and these came out just right - lots of chocolate with a tang of lime. They had the perfect light texture.

I too was surprised that you didn't taste much of the lime, which I was looking forward to. It took a little longer to make than I expected, and it was a little dense to be called a souffle. Definately only bake about 12 minutes or it's overbaked and too dry. I forgot to buy the whipping cream so I just added a little milk on top and the lime sugar and it was great. Would love to figure out how to make it more "limey". Would be good with orange peel too.

I didn't taste much of the lime at all. The chocolate was very good. Could use some additional lime flavoring.
