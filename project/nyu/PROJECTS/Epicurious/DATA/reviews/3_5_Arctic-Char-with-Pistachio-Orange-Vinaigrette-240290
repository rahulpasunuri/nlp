Soooo easy! A lovely dish. I've made many times with light olive oil and otherwise stuck to the recipe. This is my "I don't want to think tonight" go to recipe. I've also made with rainbow trout and salmon.

I have yet to find a recipe that yields such rave reviews from dinner guests for such little work. This dish is flat out luscious and 15 minutes from start to table is accurate. Finding pistachio oil can be a challenge but it is well worth the effort. I have made this dish with almonds and it is still great, but the pistachio oil puts it over the top.

Wow, this is great! Pistachio oil isn't the easiest to find but it'll be out there somewhere. I didn't find that the recipe was as dark brown as the recipe shows. But it is really good, for sure. If your arctic char is thicker -- say closer to 1" -- you'll probably need to do a few minutes more than the suggested time in the recipe.

er, I think in this instance the chef wants the oven set to "broil"- as hot as the upper heating element in your oven will get. It should be after you pass 500 degrees on your oven's temperature dial. Pay attention to rack placement and keep an eye on what is going on inside your oven. I would probably cook this with the oven door open.

it doesn't say what temperature to preheat it or to broil it. Does anyone know?

I loved this recipe and so did my guests. It was a bit of a hunt for the pistacio oil but I found all the ingredients and the fish was fabulous. the recipe was eas, fast and perfect for fussy fish eaters. I will definately serve this again.

Sorry to be one of those obnoxious cooks who changes a recipe all different ways and then reviews the different recipe that she created, but I couldn't get all the ingredients . . . The fish store had no arctic char so I used its close cousin, trout. For nut oil, what I had on hand was hazelnut oil. Otherwise I made this as directed, with pecans, and it was really good. So quick and easy to make. Especially good to serve to people who aren't huge fish lovers, because you can really pour on the sauce which adds more citrus flavor and lightens up the fishy taste. The citrus sauce would be a nice salad dressing too. Will definitely make this again.
