Delicious recipe. For those worried about raw eggs, there are now pasteurized shell eggs available on the market. They are heated to kill the bacteria and otherwise just like every other raw shell egg. I get mine at Shaws (Davidsons).

SO elegant and delicious in its simplicity. Saw it the first time on TV with Julia and Jacques. Dont get balled up about the raw egg-real Caesar salad isnt the same without it. I use a wooden bowl and sometimes will rub a cut garlic clove in the bowl but will never leave off the homemade croutons. Add sliced chicken or shrimp and you have a main meal.

This is just the best. After reading that the previous reviewer did it all with an immersion blender, I tried it and, to my taste, it was awful. So --- quickly and just before the dinner guests arrived, I prepared for the original method. It was a great hit with everyone, and eating the salad with our fingers was a quaint addition to our meal.

I must admit, I put all the dressing ingredients together and blend for a couple of seconds with my hand blender. Then I only use what I need and save for another day. I also add bacon. But it is the best caesar salad I have ever had and many people want the recipe. Maybe I'll try it one day just like Julia recommends!

Made this salad for a dinner party and it was a hit. Not only was it delicious (added a few sauteed anchovies) but eating it with our fingers added just the right touch.

Whether it is Julia's original recipe or not is beside the point. This recipe is by far the best Caesar Salad. I am not a huge fan of croutons so I added pressed garlic (2 cloves) at the pepper and salt stage. Easy yet remarkably delicious, it doesn't get much better than this!

SOrry, below should read: For those who think that coddling and egg for 45 seconds IS SAFE, IT does NOT sufficiently raise the temp for a safe egg

Rating: 3
I agree that this is very authentic and good. For those who think that coddling and egg for 45 seconds does NOT sufficiently raise the temp for a safe egg. Coddling the egg does make for a smother dressing. However, I have never had a problem with raw or coddled so I use both. With apologies to Julia, I would add some anchovies, but not whole or chopped or even paste. Try gently warming the anchovies in the oil in a saucepan over low heat. They melt into the oil. Then you can have all the additional (to the worcestershire) flavor you want. I find that this really doesn't offend people who say they don't like anchovies.

This was easy and delicious. I tore the romaine into smaller bits to make eating a bit easer. As I decided to prepare this after my chicken was in the oven I only had a loaf of rye bread to use for croutons, which worked out quite nicely. I was not sure if I should use the whole egg or just the yolk so I used just the yolk. As well in many years of cooking with raw egg I have never had a problem. However, if you are worried do coddle the egg to be safe. I do like ancovies in ceaser salad, but I did not miss them at all in the tastey orginal.

While I used less lemon, this is absolutely the most authentic recipe! Accept no substitutions.

This is the quintessential caesar recipe... and totally delicious... but, heretic or not, i love anchovies and so on they go... soy sauce? now that screams "heretic"... and worse... to me!

I have tried caesar salads from the nicest restaurants in LA to the most authentic in Ensenada and this is one of the most delicious dressings I've had. I made the salad for a party at my house for 100 people and everyone loved it!!!

From Julia & Jacques Cooking at Home: Julia says you can substitute a teaspoon or so of mayo for the egg. "Herbs and anchovies and things like that," however, adulterate it. Jacques nevertheless recommends his wife's Caesar salad. "She mixes all the dressing ingredients together--oil, lemon juice, Worcestershire, seasonings, chopped garlic, egg, and anchovy fillets in little pieces--and then tosses it with the broken-up Romaine leavese. And she tosses in some crumbled blue cheese, either Roquefort or Stilton, as well as Parmesan." Heretical! I shudder to think of the comments here if I, a mere lowly Epicurious fan, were to admit that I added blue cheese. Yet, Jacques is my hero. Has anyone tried this?

This is the most authentic caesar recipe. There is no mustard and no anchovies in the "real thing". And the sauted crutons are a must.

This is hands down the most authentic Caesar Salad recipe available. Don't listen to any of the detractors. It would be too easy to poke fun at them so (hehhe iceberg) but I will refrain. Anyone who's ever been to the birthplace of the caesar salad knows this is about as close as you're going to get it in your home kitchen.

Very delicious. I will definitely be making this one often. I couldn't find my vegetarian Worcestershire Sauce this time around (I'm an ovo-lacto veg) so I substituted soy sauce. Veggie Worcestershire will be even better, but both are suitable subs for any other veg's out there.

"definitely a connoisseur of Caesar Salad" from Shelton Connecticut - you gave it away with the iceberg lettuce. Like it or not, this is the classic. I was thrilled to find it. Yum!

Best Caesar's salad we've had yet. Well worth trying, a hit at our dinner party.

I served this with New Year's Eve dinner and as far as salad goes - was delicious! Followed the recipe exactly, coddled the egg and also included the cooked garlic bits (not at all burnt) and it was fabulous! The croutons were great too! I loved the dressing and it was perfect for those who don't like anchovies. Yum.

This is a great recipe. The lemon is great in it and I added the garlic right to the salad. Raw egg is the orginal way to serve this salad but for those who have safety concerns (bet you misstrust sushi too) use a coddled egg, egg replacement sounds disgusting...oh and the recipe did not call for BURNT GARLIC and too the cook who used ICEBERG LETTUCE instead of romaine well that is just too funny....that was a joke right????? If not then I have a great vegan chilli recipe that I subsituted beef instead of lentils.....JOKING LOL

It seems like some of you are judging this recipe with the wrong criteria. Anyone whose ever seen Julia make a Caesar Salad knows that it's not her recipe, it's Cardini's, the real deal. She's made it numerous times on her many programs and always mentions that she grew up not far from Cardini's establishment and this is in fact the way he made his salads way back when, to be eaten by hand no less. The ersatz versions made popular at cheap steak houses might appeal to certain connoisseurs who need to do their homework before criticizing a classic.

I'm with Softy on this one! I'm definitely a connoisseur of Caesar Salad, and without a doubt this is one of the worst I've ever tasted! The lemon is overwhelming, masking any other flavor that might be present in the dish. However, I must admit that the coddled egg is a wise choice. One can never be too careful of the everpresent danger of salmonella. For this recipe I decided to use Iceberg lettuce instead of the customary Romaine variety. Of the 16 garden club ladies lunching at my home, only one asked for the recipe. Julia definitely needs to revamp this one!

It is always surprising to see the ignorance of most cooks. Traditional caesar salad ALWAYS has a raw egg -- Julia has made it a bit more safe from modern egg production by coddling it. Use organic eggs for the real thing. As for the cook from the Bronx, where does it say to burn the garlic?

This was the worst caesar salad I have ever had. It had MUCH too much lemon and was missing a certain Je ne Sais Quois. I smell of buring garlic was atrocious!!!! I will forever hate Julia Child for this fiasco!!!!

I was quite delighted to discover that Julia's Ceasar Salad recipe is the one my favorite aunt gave me over 30 years ago. I should have known. I have been making this wonderful salad for all these years and even add some left-over grilled chicken to it once in a while. I have also made this for very large groups and pot lucks and every single time it has been the first dish to disappear. Thank you Julia, and Happy Birthday.

Did the cook from Seattle miss the part of the recipe where it says to CODDLE the egg?

I guess if you don't mind eating raw egg, this might be good. As someone this a comprimised immune system I would NOT appreciate someone serving me this salad, as is, at a dinner party. I would recommend that you use a pasturized egg substitute or replacement.

This is the recipe I use all the time now! Heck, we just make the croutons to snack on all the time. And for the person who said the dressing would be to lemony...it's not. It's just right!

I have had this very same salad in Mexico, at Caesar's, of course. It is very good, but when I make it at home I use 2 T of anchovy paste in it, and make the dressing in a jar with a hand blender. I guess this technically makes it aolii, and it is good on sandwiches, too. Then I use only as much dressing as I need for the amount of salad I want to make. I also top the tossed salad with anchovy fillets, and sometimes capers. With my additions, I rate this salad four forks.

This was spectacular. I hope Julia doesn't mind, but I was out of anchovies, and used a squirt of asian fish sauce instead, and it still tasted great! I also made some parmesan crisps to go with it. This salad looks a great as it tastes, and it is very easy!

Unless we miss-read this recipe, the juice of a whole lemon was WAY too lemony and tart. I would make with 1/2 the juice.

This is a great recipe--feels very authentic, and it's the only recipe you'll need. You can make the dish with uncut romaine hearts, as Julia suggests, and still keep things neat by providing chopsticks. I added the garlic to the dressing rather than to the croutons and used an anchovy-free worcestershire, and it turned out great.

The croutons were the best part. Be sure to season them well, especially with garlic, as suggested.
