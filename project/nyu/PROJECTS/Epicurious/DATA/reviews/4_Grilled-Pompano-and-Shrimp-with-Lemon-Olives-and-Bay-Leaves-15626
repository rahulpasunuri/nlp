This is really an easy recipe to prepare and it makes for a great meal with a very nice presentation. I used the seasoned pan method of cooking and used dried bay leaves at they were all I had. Recently planted a small bay tree on our deck to remedy this in the future for all recipes. I should also mention that the prep time for this recipe is less than 15 minutes once you have all of the ingredients. Now it's time for Gourmet to find some more recipes for Pompano, one really great fish.
