I also made this with beef tenderloin and I used lobster tails instead of a whole lobster, but the bearnaise was so good an accompaniment, everyone loved it. It had a briny seafood taste but was full of favour.. I added a little more lemon juice than called for, and it was just yummy. Will make again.

The description of what a NY Strip is leads me to believe the author has no idea what they are talking about. A NY Strip is not a Sirloin with the bone attached. The marbling, texture, and flavor of a good NY Strip makes Sirloin taste like the cheap cut of meat it is. Despite the affront to NY Strip fans everywhere, the recipe is a solid one that can be tweaked to the tastes of the cook. I have a tried and true Bearnaise recipe that I modified for this application. It uses culinary cream, partially replacing some of the butter. The end product is much more stable for restaurant use. Bearnaise will break quite easily, ruining the dish. This recipe is a nice twist on a Tournedos Bearnaise menu item that has been a favorite of our customers.

This is incredible. Used Filet mignon and doubled the bearnaise sauce. With 2 lobsters it was perfect for 8! I will do this again & again... everybody thought they were eating at a 5 stars restaurant and they were right!!

Made this for a camping trip using the Bearnaise butter recipe on this site modified to encompass all the flavours of this recipe minus those "pesky over a campfire" egg yolks. Froze the butter mixture with the shells and half poached lobster meat (Yes I followed Thomas Keller's method for butter poaching shellfish ;)). Start by grilling steaks on high. Midway through the steak cooking process, add a small skillet containing the defrosted lobster butter mixture and simmer for 3 minutes on the cooler side of grill. When steak is to your liking pour lobster butter (discarding shells)over meat and serve. What a taste sensation!

The directions for the lobster topping seemed complicated when I first read them but in fact it was easy once I was going through the steps. I had my butcher specifically cut the Kansas City steaks but really a New York strip cut would be fine. I broiled the steaks according to the recipe and if I make this again I would definitely grill the steaks. My dinner guests raved about the lobster topping.

I made this recipe and menu for a dinner party. Everyone was late but the sauce held together perfectly. It was da big hit. I will make it again. No changes needed.

Followed the directions exactly, and was very pleased with the result. The sauce came together wonderfully at the end and was fantastic over the steak. This is a rich and filling dish. Even the additional time for making the lobster butter was not that significant, I will make this again.

Made this for my husband on Valentine's day. We loved it! Plan on making it again!
