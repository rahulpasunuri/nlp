You need to serve this immediately after grilling!!! I made the mistake of grilling and then setting aside to grill something else and the beautiful red, orange and yellow stalks turned all brown. I think it could have been a great dish if I hadn't let it sit too long. I put three forks for potential.

I love that the beans and chard are in season at the same time. It was a bit of prep, but I think worth it.

The chard stems taste and crunch kind of like grilled celery. It was different, but quite a delicious way to make use of the stems.

Completely agree with previous review...very good, but definitely a lot of work. Not sure if it's so good that it's worth it either, but I'll likely try it again

Very tasty but on the long side to prepare.
