This recipe is really yummy, kind of a moist challah bread or a fluffy corn pudding consistency, not at all like a puree for me-I think other users may not have adequately have whipped the egg whites and may have overdone it when they folded them into the mixture-that's what gives the beautiful consistency...Also, don't let the cheddar cheese scare you off-It isn't a weird combo with the carrots-it makes it not so sweet...I used salted butter instead of unsalted and omitted the pecan topping entirely. Also added a spoonful of room temp cream cheese to the mixture when I added the carrots. It took a little longer than 30 minutes in my oven at 300.

After making this several times I now use sauteed pecans without the sugar. It is a great hit whenever I serve this. I have also prepared it the day before baking without volume problems.

Terrific recipe - slightly sweet tasting and a good compliment to roasted tenderloin.

I actually made a salty version of this yummy dish, and I think carrot purée would be a more better name than carrot pudding. Instead of sugar I added salt and pepper, along with some fresh parsely, shredded cheese and parmesean cheese. I added less butter than suggested, about half, and did not add the topping.

I served this with cajun chicken and sugar peas. It was a great compliment. I left off the nut topping , thought it would be too sweet. I also cooked it between 45 min to 1 hr.
