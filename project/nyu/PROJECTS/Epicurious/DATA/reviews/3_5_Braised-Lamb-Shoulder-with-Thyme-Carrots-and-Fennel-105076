I thought this recipe was quite excellent. I didn't have any fennel on hand so I left that out. After straining and crushing the cooked mixed vegetables, I reserved the veggie mush since my strainer had a fine sieve and there was a lot of it left. I tasted it and found it so delicious that I served it as a side dish of pureed mixed veggies. Cream biscuits went nicely with it.

This was delicious. A big success with our guests last night. I found it difficult to figure out this out: "Cut each chop lengthwise along bones into 3 separate pieces, leaving bones attached to meat." But I muddled along and found it didn't really matter in a stew like this. Changes: I ended up removing the meat from the bones before it was totally cooked, proceeding with the rest of the sauce, putting it all in the fridge, and then simmering for an hour before serving. Worked well. In addition, I did not do the carrot/fennel combo as I had planned roasted winter root vegetables that already included both. I served with flageolets. Needs a good bread to soak of the delicious sauce.
