yum, have made this multiple times. i use 6 sausages and lots more garlic. i too make it more like a soup with extra broth and an extra splash of wine. i put a parmesan rind in the pot as well. i too, cook everything together in one pot. i also use chard with the escarole or just chard if my store is out of escarole. usually 3 cans of beans or maybe four. my husband loves this. it is man food. i like it too. delish.

I also altered this a bit, to make it more soupy. I used only three Italian Turkey sausages, doubled the broth, no prosciutto.Added zucinni and carrots in the place of beans and also added tomatoes as others had suggested. I love the rustic taste and it is a great hearty soup for a cool fall evening.

I used 3 duck sausages and 2 small bunches of dinosaur kale with 1 can of cannelini beans. With 1 small onion, dash of crushed red pepper, 2 cloves of garlic, and 1 small splash of white wine and a bigger chug of chicken stock. Grated fresh parmesan on top. This easily would serve 3. Was AMAZING!! Can't wait to make again.

Nice, but much better with freshly cooked dried beans (use chicken stock, and add some dried sage). Escarole is perfect; kale would be far too bitter and need something to balance it. So stick with escarole, or endives, or mustard/collard greens. Sausage is up to you. I liked a combo of sweet and hot eyetye, with fennel. This was three meals, stretched out with some pasta. A Winner!!!!

MMMM very hearty on a cold day. YUMMm. Used spicy italian sausages and kale instead of escarole, 3 cans of cannellini, and pancetta instead of prosciutto. Also quadrupled the pepper cause my household likes it hot. Served with crusty bread.

This is a really great dish that can be adapted a lot of ways. I agree that adding canned diced tomatoes adds more body. Serving it with crusty bread to soak up the juice is a winner too. To reduce the amount of fat, cut the olive oil in half. The sausage gives up plenty to finish the dish. Leftovers are even better and can be used as a base for even more variations; we added small pasta 2 days later. Keeper!

Very very good, although proportions seem off. I used 3 sausages (plenty), 1 can of beans, and skipped the prosciutto. Great with some crusty bread or over pasta with parmesan cheese. Would I make it again? Yes, I'm making it again right now.

SO good. I used just 3 sausages, 2 cans of beans (one great northern, one cannellini), and halved the other ingredients as appropriate, except for the onion. It was perfect! Nice and thick, not too meaty, and I liked the combo of the two beans. I also used kale instead of escarole.

Rating: 3
This a definite keeper. I omitted the prosciutto. I cut the sausage into 1 inch pieces since my husband loves sausage and large pieces are more delicious than small pieces. I also cooked up some penne pasta and tossed it all together. Delicious.

I altered this recipe a bit to make it more like a soup. It was absolutely delicious. I reduced the recipe to about 4 servings. I eliminated the prosciutto and added more chicken broth (2 1/2 cups) with only 1 1/2 Italian sausages. I used one can of the beans, a half an onion and still used about a half a cup of white wine. Also, I couldn't find escarole so substituted Belgian endives (escarole is a type of endive) chopped. In order to thicken the soup I smashed about 1/3 of the can of beans into a paste and added that to the soup. This was delicious and now one of my favorite soups!

We only used 8 sausages and it was still a little much. Next time we will use 6. We did use a mix of sweet and hot Italian sausage though and that turned out great! I will definitely make this again the next time I get escarole from our CSA.

Have made this multiple times. I cut down the beans to only 1 can, or it seems a bit overloaded to me. Reminds me of my granmother's escarole and beans but the sausage goes very well and makes it a great one-dish supper.

Delicious! One of our favorite dishes on chilly evenings. I use half the amount of sausage [almost always use turkey sausage] and only two cans of beans. I, too, leave the sausage in the pan while moving through the recipe. Have never used the proscuitto - too salty. Substitute kale for escarole b/c I like the chewy texture. Will continue to have on the regular meal rotation.

This was very good. I left out a lot of meat. I also did not take the sausage out after frying it. I left it in the pot & then added the other ingredients, which made it easier & it tasted great!

Loved this recipe...so easy and delicious. We did substitute broccoli rabe for escarole.

WAY too salty and WAY too much meat. Made it exactly as written. We ate a bowl full each and put the remainder in the fridge. I'm willing to bet it gets tossed uneaten in a couple of days. Maybe half the sausage and skip the prosciutto?

Rating: 4
Great flavors and they meld really well. We got escarole in our farm share and had no idea what to do with it-- now I can't wait to pick up this week's share so I can make this again. Definitely mess with the bean/meat/greens proportions until you find one you like. I did one escarole, 2lbs sausage and 2 cans beans. Serve with crusty bread and good red wine.

My family loved this, but thought that there was a lot of meat in it. Next time I'm only going to put 8 sausages in instead of 12.

Rating: 4
The whole family loved this recipe. I did add a can of diced tomatoes as suggested by the previous reviews. I didn't have any escarole on hand so I used a 16 oz bag of frozen baby spinach that worked great. We would definitely make this again.

This is a perfect, hearty meal for a cold day. I cut the sausage amount to half (sweet and hot italian) and added a head of radicchio and less escarole as well as a can of diced tomatoes, more wine, pasta, fresh basil, and extra red pepper. The Radicchio adds some nice color and the basil is really nice - I highly recommend it. My husband raved all night and we have left overs for the next week as this recipe makes a ton! Don't skip this one!!

Very good. I added some leftover canned tomatoes and substituted pasta instead of beans (can't eat them) added more garlic and pepper flakes and it was delicious!

Rating: 3
I used about 3 T. of balsamic vinegar in place of the white wine and added a T. of sugar. along with 1/4 cup of tomato sauce. I also cooked it much longer than what was suggested, (simmer 1hr) so the sausage got more tender and the flavors blended more. I would make it again.

Excellent. It is "man" food, but the ladies will like it too.

This was really good. I did change a few things. I served it tossed with orchiette pasta, and since I was only cooking for two, I scaled back the ingredient amounts -- a small head of escarole, about 12 ounces of sausage, 1 can of white beans, half a large sweet onion, half a cup of wine, about the same amount of chicken stock. I did use three cloves of garlic (you can't have too much garlic in something like this!) and seasoned generously with salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper. I left out the prosciutto (I didn't have any), and resisted the urge to add fresh rosemary. I was glad -- it was delicious! I think I might try some rosemary next time, because it would likely be good that way as well... but I would probably leave out the prosciutto again. I suspect it would overwhelm the other flavors. This would also be great with broccoli rabe (I make something similar with broccoli rabe, chicken sausages and roasted garlic).

I couldn't find any escarole at my local grocery store, so I substituted kale with terrific results. I didn't find the dish too salty at all and thought the parmesan added a nice richness to the broth. Garlic fans may want to add a bit more than the recipe calls for. Good call on the crusty bread!

needs a lot more garlic and a lot less sausage & beans. i liked it, my husband really liked it. i think its a mans meal. i'd make it again more for him than me.

Hmm, rave reviews inspired me to give this a try. I'm not generally of fan of cooked leafy vegetables except for spinach, so I had my doubts. Sadly, they were justified. The texture of the escarole was, in a word, yucky. I also think the dish is a little bland without parmesan, but with parmesan, it was too salty. Overall, just a very hum-drum "so what" kinda meal.

Rating: 3
yes, this easily becomes a traditional Italian soup -- that's what I am making for dinner. I decided to balance the carbs, take it easy on the beans, so that I could have it with lots of nice FRENCH baguette! I also could not find escarole today, so I am using broccoli rabe. And I am using turkey sausage. And I didn't have wine. Well, I guess this is a different recipe, but it works all the same!

Rating: 3
After reading the reviews, I was excited to try such a simple recipe. I didn't cook the sausages in the dish but grilled them separately and proceeded with the recipe. The beans meld with the escarole and the prociutto adds the salt that is needed although I added a pinch more. I have to agree with other reviewers that this recipe would be great with pasta or a nice crusty bread. The recipe would probably work great as a hearty soup by adding more chicken broth.

Rating: 3
Pretty good one this - very tasty and my wife liked it a lot, but I don't think it looks too great. Next time I'm going to par-boil the sausages (in their casings) in a minimum of water then slice them and saute them as above in order to brown more. The left over water I'll reduce and mix with the stock. I also think that you can probably leave the beans a bit later as they taste better when they're firmer. Otherwise, fantastic!

I thought this soup was okay. I was disapointed because of the outstanding reviews here. It was easy and filling but there are much better recipes on this site.

This combination is great served over pasta. It reminded me of a "country rigatoni" that I remember from Carmine's in NYC... For a vegetarian guest, I left out the meats (she didn't mind the broth) and that version was great, too. Yum. I make this dish often.

In a word, excellent! Make sure you've got bread to soak up the delicious broth.

Based on all the rave reviews, one more shouldn't make a difference... but I'll chime in anyway! This was WONDERFUL. I used spicy Italian turkey sausage -- was fantastic, but would like to try mild next time.

This was a wonderful dish to serve to a crowd for a simple Autumn supper. Everyone loved it, and wanted the recipe for themselves. It was easy, and I will definitely make it again. I too added extra chicken stock to make it a bit soupier.

Excellent. However, freshly made beans vastly improve the dish and with just a little organization (soaking overnight) are quite simple. Don't forget fresh sage, garlic cloves and bay leaves when cooking beans. also used pancetta rather than prosciutto. And yes, a hearty red wine and crusty bread is all you need.

This was a great hearty meal that was easy to prepare. I too added extra chicken broth (2c) to make it more like soup and served with fresh italian bread to soak up that flavorful broth. A must make on a cold night.

Loved this dish - easy and so tasty. I doubled the escarole, too, and it was fantasic!

I made this for a picky partner who does not eat pork and has a sensitive stomach: i used cajun ostrich sausage instead of italian sausage and crushed red peppers: i also could not find escarole so i used dandelion root, both red & green.Finally we put it on a bed of baby endive, it was fantastic! The only other addition I would make is pine nuts, they would have made it even better!

Wonderful and very easy!! I used turkey sausage instead and the result was great.

Delicious flavor. If you use "Hot" Italian sausage leave out the crushed red peppers. Serve this dish on a bed of steamed rice, it will help soak up the wonderful broth.

Rating: 3
This was absolutely delicious. I made it more like a soup, by adding a lot more chicken broth. I also added an additional head of escarole, and cut back on the amount of beans (2 cans) and sausage.( I only used six). I thought it was even better the next day. This dish is very versatile. You can make it just the way you want it.

Excellent combination of ingredients. I cut back on the the sausage, using a mix of hot and mild. Also added the escarole closer to the end of cooking. also added some pancetta to recipe. Served with, mixed green salad with tomato/basil vinaigrette, crusty bread and 1996 LeBocce Chianti Classico.

This was fabulous.....I was a star the night I made this. I did, however, add a lot more escarole (I doubled it) to the dish to make it more traditional. This one's a must!
