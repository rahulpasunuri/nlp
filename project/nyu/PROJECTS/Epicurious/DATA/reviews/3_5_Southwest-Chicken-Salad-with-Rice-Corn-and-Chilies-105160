I really like this. I just skip the red bell peppers, though, and make all of them poblano (I like spicy). I also roast the corn, and I use brown rice instead of white (trying to be healthier!) All in all, it's an easy and tasty dish.

I made this recipe over and over last summer while the poblanos were coming in from my garden. I tweaked it a bit every time until arriving at the proportions that were most pleasing to me: doubled the chicken, poblanos and red bell peppers, halved the rice (brown basmati), and reversed the proportion of oil and lime juice in the dressing. Sometimes we ate it over a bed of mixed greens, sometimes in romaine lettuce hearts. Yum!

This is a great weeknight dish or crowd-pleaser meal. It comes together very quickly and yields more like 8 servings, so there is plenty for mexican-inspired leftovers the following day (burritos, anyone?). I baked the chicken (at 375 for about 30 minutes) since I am without access to a grill, and I used 16 oz. of frozen corn so there was no shucking necessary. These ingredients take very well to grilling, but the dish was delicious even baked. I will use more chipotle next time as well as some crushed chili peppers for some heat.

This dish was very good. It wasn't very "salady". Also, the dressing numbers don't add up - following the recipe nets you less than 1 cup of dressing, yet the directions call for you to use 1/2 cup of dressing on two occasions, plus have remaining dressing to add "to taste", so I don't know what's up with that. Anyway - very good! Serve with guacamole and chips.

I've been making this dish for about 4 years and it's awesome- my suggestion is to double the dressing recipe. This way there is plenty to use as marinade and to really coat the meat once it has been cooked and sliced up. You have to use corn on the cob to get that charred flavor from the grill, although Trader Joes does now sell frozen bagged corn that has been grilled so it has all that grilled flavor and color.

Served this at a baby shower of about 70 people, everyone loved it! I served it as an appetizer stuffed in individual endive leaves and it was a huge hit. You must use fresh corn and a good quality rice (I use Jasmine, my favorite), no instant rice...and dont skimp on the adobo, what a kick!

Made this for my family and everyone loved it. I didn't feel like using corn on the cob so used frozen corn which worked just fine. Delicious and refreshing. Served with fresh fruit. It was gobbled up by all.

Excellent flavor. I used less rice and still thought it provided too much bland filler. I'll probably eliminate it entirely on the next go around. With sweet corn and peppers so delicious,abundant and cheap this time of year, why not ditch the rice entirely and savor the grilled vegs themselves? Still a great recipe to tweak.

This recipe is a keeper! The grilled vegetables were delicious (I expecially loved the flavor of the grilled corn!). I halved the recipe for my husband and I, and he is looking forward to finishing it for lunch tomorrow. This will be a dish we make often.

The grilled corn was delicious, but I was disappointed in the salad itself. Even with adding additional lime juice, the flavor was not what I anticpated when I read the other reviews. I used a different brand of chipolte peppers than I normally used so did not get much of the smokey flavor that I like - maybe that was part of the problem. I would still like to find a southwestern style salad--any suggestions. Also, this made way more than six serving, so you may wish to cut down on the recipe, especially the amount of rice.

Great recipe. I usually don't include the chicken, but rather add other vegetables such as asparagus, peppers etc. Comes out wonderfull. Lately I make it with Basmati Rice. It adds a nutty flavor to the disk

This is a great recipe. I roast the vegetables and use a whole roasted chicken from the grocery store to make it easier. Very good.

This was great. It has been added to our favorite recipes and we will make it again. I wouldn't change anything.

My husband and I liked this. I halved the recipe and we had more than enough for the two of us. It is quick and simple to make.

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was very very good - it has just enough "warmth" to make it interesting, but not too spicy hot. I stuck the rice and the grilled vegetables and chicken in the refrigerator to cool off before slicing and this sped preparation considerably. I don't know why buying pre-roasted chicken would make it any faster, since it takes the same amount of time to grill the vegetables as it does to grill the chicken. Note: This makes a *lot* of salad, I had to use my largest mixing bowl to assemble it. It served four and more than half was left over, so next time I might halve the recipe or use less rice.

Excellent. I'm the leftovers cold for lunch today.

This recipe sounded so good except for one thing!I do not like rice, so I used pasta instead, (drained and rinsed well). I also decided to add a little bit more of the lime juice and I used 3 poblano chilies. WONDERFUL DISH!

I made this as a side-dish and it was a hit at the party. Tasty and flavourful. I will definitely make it again.

VERY good as written. Next time I'll add more lime juice and chipotles to the dressing. Will also include more poblano chilies and red bell peppers. I'll definitely repeat this recipe.

Made this dish last night for the first time and will definitely make again. Roasted the peppers whole, then peeled and cut into strips. Also, grilled the chicken breasts on the bone and left skin on while cooking, which made for moister meat. Garnished with sliced tomatoes and avocados. Very Good!

I made this recipe without the cilantro as I didn't have any on hand. Also I had to substitute lemon juice for the lime juice. My husband said it was "really good." We ate it as a main course, and found it delicious and filling.

Wonderful side salad for a Bar-B-Q or a main dish. It was a big hit at a party I had.

Excellent! Fresh, light and wonderful for a backyard barbecue with friends. Serve with a lime margharita (July 2001) and a lime mousse cheesecake (July 2000) for dessert.
