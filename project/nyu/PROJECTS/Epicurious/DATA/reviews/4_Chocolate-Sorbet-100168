Simple, fast intense, richly flavored with a light texture. Wouldn't set up in my ice cream make despite chilling the mixture in the fridge for 8 hours. Poured it into a large ceramic bowl and let it freeze overnight, turned out beautifully.

This turned out great. Use top-quality chocolate and real espresso (just subtract an equivalent amount of water). Does need to freeze overnight - I only had 5 hours and it was still soft and melted quickly. Really nice, rich flavor, smooth texture, not icy at all. Everyone loved it!

I have the regular size Cuisinart and there was so much chocolate mixture that it overflowed. The mess was horrible. Shouldn't that be cautioned in the recipe?

This recipe is great if made the day before and if served with a fruit sorbet. I suggest the Deborah Madison recipe. Also, instead of instant coffee, I just add a little bit of actual coffee from a french press.

This is a great recipe! COOK BEWARE!- Its a true chocolate lovers recipe- I am sure its not for everyone... I am lactose intolerant, so this is a great sub. for the real mccoy! Try getting the liquid as cold as possible before you put it in a ice cream maker(leave it in the freezer for a few hours before hand). I found that it takes about twice as long as normal ice cream to freeze. WORTH EVERY BITE!~
