This recipe finally gives me the versatile filling I've been looking for - from cakes to tarts. It is mild & creamy and adaptable to alot of different flavorings. I like to sweeten it with superfine sugar or even pure maple syrup, depending on what I'm using it for.

I TRIED THIS IN A STRAWBERRY TRIFFLE, IT WAS DELICIUS. I RECOMEND TO USE YOUR IMAGINATION, AN TRY TO MIX WITH KIWI, MANGO AND BANANA LIKE THIS: ON THE FLOOR OF YOUR TRIFFLE ARRANGE ONE LAYER OF POUND CAKE, THEN SOUR MASCARPONE CREAM, THEN ONE LAYER OF YOUR CHOISE ( DIFERENTE KIND OF FRUIT PER LAYER ) THEN AGAIN POUND CAKE, MASCARPONE AND FRUIT! IT WILL BE REAL GOOD!!
