I made this cake for Easter dinner and the guests fought over the leftovers. It was beyond delicious, and this has now been requested for three upcoming birthdays. I baked it in three 8" pans, which was perfect, and I didn't bother to frost the sides, which was easier (and prettier, in my opinion). I took the suggestion of using gelatin in the white chocolate mixture, but would not do that again. It made the chocolate mixture difficult to fold into the whipped cream. That said, the white chocolate chunks in the frosting were a hit, so go figure. Also, I got annoyed at cutting up the 6 T. of butter into the dry ingredients. I cut about 2 T into it, then said the hell with it, and creamed the other 4 T into the liquid part of the batter. If there is a compelling reason not to cream all the butter in at one time, please someone tell me. The poppy seed cake was amazing, and I would make that by itself any time. This cake was certainly more than worth the effort, and I'm looking forward to making it again soon.

I forgot to cut in the 6 T of butter and overcooked the cakes in 9" pans and this still turned out beautifully! The white chocolate cream is really a treat with fairly minimal effort - heavenly with fresh Louisiana strawberries! Oh, and I cheated and used 8 oz of Ghirardelli white chocolate chips and they worked fine.

Full disclosure: no, I have not made this recipe. To anhey and Skippy14: I had printed this recipe out in 2006 (!), and was just checking out recent reviews in anticipation of making it soon. My old copy only lists one amount of butter (1 cup) in the cake recipe. There seems to now be an extra 6 tablespoons listed for no apparent reason. I say omit it, and see what happens. 1 cup is probably plenty for a cake this size.

This took about 20 minutes longer than the recipe to finish cooking. After mixing the cream and sugar for te frosting, it got runny after putting in the chocolate mix (yes, it was room-temperature) I had to re-mix for 5 minutes to get it to a stronger consistency. Great taste, but needs to be tweaked to work.

Fantastic cake. I made it last year and this year for my birthday and I will be making it each year. Everybody loved this cake. I used frozen strawberries, let them sit for 10 min only then they are easy to slice. It takes 3 min for the sugar, eggs & lemon to reach the desired temperature, but 20 min for the mix to thicken.

Hi Anhey in Seattle-- I haven't made this cake yet, but I think that the recipe is just written in a way that's a little confusing. The cold butter cut into bits gets mixed in the first four ingredients, and the room temp butter gets beaten with sugar, etc. See if that makes sense.

I have not made this yet, but I am wondering about the 2 different amounts of butter the cake recipe calls for. Is that a mistake? How have you other people made it? I'm assuming it's a mistype, but thought I'd try to find out...

This cake was spectacular!! I didnt have a candy thermometer and the chocolate cream took forever to thicken up...about 20 minutes (not 3 like it says). But that's the only difficulty I had making it. The cake was moist, delicious, and beautiful! I made it for a birthday party and it was a hit. Im already wanting to make it again. The white chocolate cream balances wonderfully with the strawberries and the cake. Make this cake, you won't regret it!!!!

This cake was really marvelous but I was disappointed at how un-white chocolate tasting the filling and frosting turned out. I followed the recipe to the letter, using all 6 Tbls of lemon and that's what it turned out tasting like. It was very good but if you are thinking that it will be white chocolate tasting, it definitely doesn't. I used raspberry jam with the filling, omitting the strawberries (I was feeding people who have allergies to them) and it was very well received.

Strawberries were out of season when I made this, so I added 2 1/2 C of pureed frozen strawberries to 1 cup of white chocolate cream for the filling. I only cut the cake into two layers, filled it with the stawberry filling,and frosted it with the rest of the cream. The white chocolate cream by itself held up nicely, but the strawberry filling was very sloppy. I found the cake light and delicious, but the whole thing was about twice as good the second day--make it ahead of time and let the flavors blend overnight.

Flavors were great, but the texture of the cake was too dense in my opinion. I will definitely keep the white chocolate cream recipe for other cakes. It was very light and flavorful (used only 2 T. lemon juice but next time I'd use 3T). Be sure to whip the cream until very stiff... I used homemade strawberry jam between layers and it added just enough flavor. Thanks to other reviewers for advising to be generous with the frosting. It made plenty.

This cake was awesome! I made it for father's day, everyone thought it was great, but a little rich. I loved it just the way it was. Will definitely make again.

First of all, I did not use the poppy seeds. then looking at the previous reviews...I created what may be my best cake ever (and I bake ALOT). I made two layers and split them to make 4 layers. I put the white chocolate cream in between the layers with some chopped strawberries. then I iced the cake with a lemon buttercream and covered it with sliced strawberries. It lasted maybe about 20 min in my office. I would defiantly make it again.

I made this cake for a going away party for a friend. I followed the advice of edsz from Washington, DC (Thanks!) and multiplied all the amounts by 1.5. I baked it in 3 9X13 pans. It took approx. 15-18 minutes for each to bake at 350 degrees. I did not increase the lemon juice in the frosting and added 4 oz. more white chocolate. The result--an AMAZING cake that was a big hit at the party. Everyone commented on the lightness of the cake and that it was not oversweet. It was an excellent cake for an early summer afternoon party. Plus, as a 3 layer cake with strawberries on top--it was very impressive looking. I will definitely make it again.

This is an out-standing dessert, with a moist cake base, a killer presentation, an excellent combination of textures and flavors and frosting to die for -- IF you make it with pasteurized whipping cream. For reasons I cannot fathom, most of what is on the supermarket shelves is ULTRA-pasteurized whipping cream. As I have read elsewhere on this site, the high temperatures used in the ultra-pasteurizing process kills the very properties which allows cream to whip. The result is a wimpy, goopy version that does not pipe very successfully, even if you chill your bowl and whisk. Why they would sell something called "whipping cream" that doesn't really whip is one of the great mysteries of life, I guess. I have made this cake twice -- once with pasteurized whipping cream and one with ultra-pasteurized whipping cream, Night and day, my fellow cooks. Despite careful preparation and much prayer, the cake made with the u-p whipping cream listed badly, because the frosting was too insubstantial to hold the layers in place. As other reviewers have mentioned, I had a lot left over. Decorative piping? Fugedaboutit. SAVE YOURSELVES heartache and pain. It's not you. It's your whipping cream. Demand that your grocer carry a pasteurized brand. One final note: I baked mine in two nine-inch cake pans and split them for a four-layer beauty.

Outstanding! The cake was moist and delicious, and the white chocolate cream was as wonderful as the reviews. I baked the cake in 3 layer pans. Since the recipe made such a large quantity of the cream, I split the 3 cake layers into 6, and built upwards with the cream and berries (I stopped after 5 layers). Flavors were fantastic, cake and cream were easy to work with and held up well for 2 days. Will definitely make again.

I just wanted to add my 2 cents on the filling as it is a 4 forker IMHO. For a firmer filling I sprinkle 1 pack gelatin over the lemon juice, allow to soften then add it to the eggs and sugar; proceed per directions. I also fold in a couple handfuls of chopped strawberries to the mousse as well as adding the sliced strawberries on top. One person described it as an "upscale strawberry cake" taste. (I use a pound cake base w/ a white chocolate Italian Meringue Buttercream icing)

This Cake was FABULOUS. Though it DID take a little time to prepare, it was well worth the wait. It was difficult to keep from eating the entire thing before i served it. The only suggestion I have is to make sure you use plenty of strawberries. I used one layer of sliced strawberries between each layer of cake and it wasn't quite enough "berry" taste. Also- Whoever suggested using less lemon was right on. I used almost half the lemon suggested and the flavor was plenty strong. I will with out a doubt be making this one again sometime.

A BIGGER CAKE. I needed the cake to serve 14-16 people for Easter. Multiplied all the ingredients by 1.5 and made the cake in 3 - 9 x 13 pans. Even in my convection oven, I needed to change positions of the top and bottom pans half way through. The cake came out great and received wow reviews from everyone. Made the layers 2 days ahead. Made the frosting and assembled the cake the day before. Assembled the cake on a large foil-covered cutting board (It weighs a lot.) Had enough frosting to decorate the cake nicely.

Both the cake and the filling were excellent. However, I had a horrible time getting all the layers to stay together when sliced. I, too, cooked the lemon/egg mixture longer than the prescribed 3 minutes to thicken it, but still ended up with a rather sloppy (albeit delicious) mess after serving a few slices. I would love to make it again, though more successfully in the final construction stage. Any suggestions?

A great cake!!! Everyone raved about this cake when they tasted it and this is coming from a family of great cake-makers. I made the cake in 3 8.5 inch pans. It was moist but yet stood up very well when I iced and filled it with the strawberries. The chocolate cream was absolutely fantastic and I found that it made a lot--but not TOO much. When it tastes that great why not use it all anyway? It also sliced very well--didn't fall apart. I will definitely be making this cake again!

I found that the white chocolate cream was absolutely fantastic (I'm planning on using it in cream puffs and it makes a wonderful fruit dip) and that the cake was good, but I don't believe the two really suit each other. I said that I would make this again, but I believe that I won't make the cake and the cream together. The cake just seems too heavy for the cream. Maybe it's better suited for a lemon glaze.

Made it yesterday for a celebration dinner. Re: previous reviews, my egg/sugar/lemon for the frosting took exactly 3 minutes to heat to correct temperature. I did it in 3 pans too. Strawberries being not quite in season yet, I cheated by sprinkling a little powdered sugar over the berry layers to sweeten, which also drew out the juice to make the cake a little moister. Got raves.

This cake was one of the best I ever made. I am an expert baker(my daughter's friends call me the cake lady) and this cake was beautifull- very moist and a real show stopper. I even went off the South Beach diet to taste it!

This cake was FANTASTIC !! So far the tastiest cake I've made. ( I havent made all that many cakes but still it says something ! ) Only took about 3 hours to make, also used the three 8/9 inch pie pans didnt have the double broiler but winged it and it all turned out great minus any peaks.. I made up for it by slicing the strawberries very thin and layering them along the bottom perimeter of the cake.. and with the shredded white chocolate on the top and some sliced strawberries as well.. it looked gorgeous !! A+

Very nice "special occasion" cake - looks fantastic, especially when you make 4 layers. Heeded previous cooks' advice and cut down on lemon juice in icing to 3 tbsp. - would also cut down on the whipping cream next time to 2 cups. The recipe made too much chocolate cream, I thought. But the recipe was straightforward and the result was tasty. Held up for 2 days.

Totally suprised myself with this one - who knew I could bake!!! This cake is great and I look forward to the opportunity to make it again! I used two round cake pans and then split each in half, making it a 4-layer - even more decadent. Frosting is great and there is tons left over for taste-testing, but definitely make sure you let the white chocolate mixture cool completely before mixing it in...

i just have to say that this cake was the very first cake i've ever "made from scratch"...i may be a decent cook but baking was never my thing...well, i decided to bake a real cake for my boyfriend's birthday and since he doesn't like milk/dark chocolate (he's crazy), and he loves poppy seeds, this was the cake...after borrowing a mixer and whisk from my neighbour i set out to make this cake...8 hours later (hehe) it was a huge hit! he loved it, my neighbours loved it and i'm sure they were all just more surprised that it turned out at all, but i thought it was pretty good and it looked pretty too...aside from the fact that my whipping cream and sugar didn't form peaks and most of the cream layers with strawberries fell out the side (it looked like a volcano cake--who knew you were to add the sugar a little at a time to form peaks?) it tasted yummy...the chocolate cream is luscious (and i didn't use a double broiler, just low heat and more time)...thanks to whoever suggested using 3 pans...it probably worked to my advantage in the end...cheers

I don't know what happened to mine. I'm a pretty good baker, followed the recipe to a T, and used fresh ingredients, but for some reason my cake fell. It was about as light and fluffy as a brick. Very disappointing, although the white chocolate cream and strawberries were great.

I loved the flavor lemony whipped cream topping and filling. But I thought the cake flavor was a bit bland and the texture was pretty dense. I'll use the filling for a different cake recipe next time.

This is a wonderful cake. I used three 8 inch cake pans, much easier. For the eggs and sugar, I beat for about 9 minutes using a blender stick. The frosting was a nice consistency. I marinated the strawberries with 1 tablespoon of cointreau, and sliced extra strawberries to serve on the side. Made the cake and frosted the day before and it held up well. I think there is a typo in recipe, it says that cake can be at room temperature for 12 hours, I think it should be 1-2 hours.

I made this for a birthday party. Having made it twice, the lessons i learned were: 1. bake it in three separate pans, rather than one springform. its much easier that way. 2. when making the frosting: you need to whisk the sugar/egg/lemon juice combination for a while until it gets pretty thick. it takes well over the suggested 3 minutes. i thought the icing tasted really great. 3. i would add more strawberries to the filling next time. otherwise, it got rave reviews, everyone loved it and i will definitely make it again!

this was exquisite. it only needed 45 minutes in my oven - watch the top because it might burn a little. if it starts browning after half an hour, put a sheet of aluminum foil over it. everyone at the party raved about it. lots of fun to make, but fairly labor intensive. so only do this if you have the time and energy. the lemon flavors are just right - not too strong, but enough to complement the strawberries and white chocolate. this one's a keeper.

Heavenly. Icing was divine and I think I ate more than I used ;) Made this in two 9 inch cake pans, which I split and iced then put back together, resulting in 4 layers. Next time I'll put more frosting in layers. Didn't think I'd have enough but I had much left over. Soooooo good and a huge hit with everyone. Do yourself a favor and make this.

Simple cake to prepare and absolutely delicious! I reduced the amount of sugar slightly in the cake and the filling, and will probably reduce even more next time. I think people might have had a hard time with the filling as they didn't cook the yolks long enough. It should be thick like lemon curd, and by the time you add the chocolate your arm should be sore from whisking such a stiff mixture! It took at least 8-9 minutes (not 3 as stated in recipe) at high altitude to get the yolks to the correct consistency.

I doubled the cake recipe, increased the poppy seeds to 3/4 cup, and baked it in one 10x15 rectangular pan. In addition, my 1950s-vintage oven decided to go off at some point, so that when I went to check it for doneness, the oven was cold! I carefully put the partially-risen cake on the stove, reheated the oven, and started baking the cake again 15 minutes later. The next time I checked it I worried that it was browning too much on top and covered it with a piece of aluminum foil. The NEXT time I checked it I had to peel the foil off, along with the crust, and it wasn't done and had to go back in! In spite of all this, it came out wonderful, all of which is to say that this is a very forgiving recipe, to say the least! Given the mixed reviews of the icing recipe and the importance of this coming out good (a 50th birthday party) I used another icing recipe (cream cheese) and also added a thin layer of seedless raspberry jam between cake layers. Great recipe. And there was a bonus: the crust that baked onto the foil turned into these delicious crisp wafers. Next time I'm going to use some of the batter for cookies!

I left out the poppy seeds, baked it in a fancy cake tin, then used the cake as a base for strawberry shortcake. Awesome!!!!

I made this cake for my dad's birthday and he loved it! I baked the cake in 3 separate pans instead of 1 springform. True - it was time-consuming but it definitely turned out to be a very presentable cake. Next time, to make the cake a little more "interesting," I'll brush each layer with rum.

I am sorry to say that this is the first recipe from this site that I will not make again. Actually, the cake itself was excellent, but the white chocolate cream was terrible. Although the flavor was good, it was really just a flavored whipped cream - not very stiff at all and impossible to frost with. It is completely possible I somehow messed up the recipe, but I certainly can't find my mistake. The cream was so soft (althouh I had beaten it to stiff peaks) that by the end of the evening the cake collapsed into a gooey mess :-((

I made this cake for Easter and everyone loved it. I used a Pillsbury butter cake mix and added the lemon juice, lemon zest, and poppy seeds to it. It turned out perfect (I chose to do this after my first attempt at the cake recipe failed and I didn't have the time to re-do the entire thing again). I couldn't make chocolate "curls" so I just shaved a white chocolate bar with a vegetable peeler and it was very pretty. Good strawberries are key: don't be afraid to add more because all of my partakers wished there were more on the side.

I thought that this was a nice simple cake. However, because I was short on time, I didn't bother making the white chocolate topping. I simply made whipped cream with a little powdered sugar and then folded in some raspberries. I used this as the frosting and sprinkled a bunch more raspberries on top. Also I did cut down the amount of sugar in the cake by 1/2 a cup. A nice dessert!

Great! I made this for a bridal shower, got rave reviews. Frosting was hard to make, I think I overbeat it when folding it into the lemon cream. Would probably make in 3 layer pans next time....easier.

The taste of this cake is phenomenal. My husband just bought a stand mixer; I've made several cakes from this website. This is by far, one of my favorites. I did, however, have a difficult time with the white chocolate cream filling. The cream turned a funny green color. Nonetheless, it tasted fine. I omitted the poppy seeds and made a lemon buttercream to finish it off. It was delicious.

I made this cake for my son's 5th birthday party, and it got great rave reviews. Though the cake was a little toosophisicated for my son's five year old friends' tastebud, but I certainly did not hear any complaints from the parents. The cake was a show stopper with the kids(the strawberries decorated on the cake was absolutely scrumptious), and the taste was a hit with the parents! Will definitely make it again, but not for five year olds!
