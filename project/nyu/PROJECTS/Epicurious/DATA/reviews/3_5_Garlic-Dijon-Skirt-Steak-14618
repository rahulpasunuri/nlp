Loved how quick and easy this was! Full of flavor and a big hit in our house. I served it with a side of sweet potato fries and side salad.

Outstanding taste. I marinated it for a longer period approx. 4-5 hrs. and added the juice of one whole lime. At the suggestion of another user, I added about 1 tbl. of honey.

Very easy and delicious. Added slightly more lime juice (approx. 2 tsp) and 1-2 tsp. of honey. Marinated it for 4-5 hrs. Steak was very tender and flavorfull.

Very easy and delicious. I added slightly more than a Tbl. of lime juice and approx. 1-2 tsp. honey. Steak was very tender and tasty. Will definitely make again.

What a great but simple marinade for a skirt steak. Its not overpowering in any way and helps bring out all those great flavors you get with a skirt steak. I marinated it for an hour and took a users suggestion to add a little honey.

My boyfriend loves this and asks for it often. I always use lemon instaed of lime and adding honey is a MUST...but overall the changes take it from so-so to awesome. Oh...I also pan fry it and double the sauce.

While this recipe produced a perfectly palatable steak, the overall effects of the marinade were barely noticeable. We even extended the marinade time to 1.5 hours. Overall, I would say there are many, better recipes at this site.

so easy, so fast, and so good, considering the amount of time you have to invest. we pan-cooked it since we don't have a grill, but it was still quite nice.

My husband wasn't crazy about "skirt steak" he found it to be stringy. Although we did love the marinade, and would use it again on a different type of steak...
