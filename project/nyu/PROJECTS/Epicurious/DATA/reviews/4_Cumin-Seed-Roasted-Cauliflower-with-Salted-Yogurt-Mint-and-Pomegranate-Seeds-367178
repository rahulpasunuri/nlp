tried with the real fruit, and while it gives it a nice crunchy texture, flavorwise, the sourness of the pomagranate molasses is a nice flavor contrast. I think I'd add a little of both.

this recipe is surprisingly good. Very easy and delicious. I blended the yogurt with mint and a couple tb of mayo to make the topping. I used pomagranate molasses instead of the real deal.I will try it again with the fruit.

To me, an odd assortment of ingredients. Tried it since I have everything on hand. It was awesome! Everyone enjoyed it and went back until the plate was clean. Made as directed, roasting cauliflower took me longer than the 30 min. that was directed.

Hubby had never had pomegranate seeds but loved this recipe and the seeds. I grew up eting them-Granny (Syrian) had a tree in her yard. Fond memories and great dish.

Made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. The dish is beautiful and unlike the previous review I think that the pomegranate seeds are important - they give a unique pop of flavor to the dish. This was easy to put together and I'll be making it again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out pretty well. make sure to coat the florets evenly -- ones without a lot of seasoning taste bland. Also, pomegranate seeds are nice, but not as necessary as the yogurt and mint.
