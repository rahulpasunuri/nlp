Turned out perfectly. To those who had trouble with the improvised bain marie that was recommended as the process for heating up the yolk, corn syrup, sugar mixture-don't do it that way. I used my wonderful old copper double boiler and had no problems-the time it took to reach the proper temperature was 50 seconds longer that the recipe suggests it should take. I am sure I would have encountered the same problem had I used the recommended method. Just beat the mixture w/ a handheld beater while heating-I used my grill thermometer with the instant read-out for precision on temp. Also used Stella Doro almond toasts in lieu of the amaretti cookies -easier to find where I live. Also used approx. 1 1/2 X as many almond toast crumbs- crunchier-a contrast to the smoothness of the souffle. I let mine sit at room temp approx. 10-12 min. before serving - personal preference.

This recipe is refreshing and has great flavor but what a PIA to make. The step with the yolks and corn syrup cooking to 160 - I couldn't get either of 2 thermometers to register 160º so by instinct I took it off the water, too late. Continuing to beat, it became sticky and hardened in some spots. No way could it be FOLDED into the peaches and whipping cream. I put it back on the water to softened it enough to incorporate it into the peaches. There were some clumps in the souffles but they were just a burst of chewy sweetnes - like taffy. My souffles dishes were 1 cup so I didn't do the foil part, The presetation was nice but no way did it look like the picture.

I used amaretto instead of brandy in the peach puree. My ramekins hold a full cup, so the souffles didn't come over the top of them, but they still tasted great! I also made my own amaretti cookies and served them alongside.

Delicious !. Very elegant. Next time I will lower a bit the quantity of Amaretto.

I loved the recipe, but have 2 comments: The 3# of peaches provided about twice as much puree as I needed; my bowl over simmering water must not have been well-matched (not enough surface area of bowl over the water??) because after about 25 mins of cooking I was still at about 148 degrees and the mixture was almost marshmallow. Nonetheless I used it, and while it didn't fill the molds it was delicious. I'll definitely try it again.
