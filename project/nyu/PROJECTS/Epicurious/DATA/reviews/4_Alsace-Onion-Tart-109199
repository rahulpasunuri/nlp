Simply divine. This tart receives rave reviews and countless requests for the recipe. Yes, it's luscious and rich but no one will complain. I mix in and top the tart with guyere. Serve with a lightly dressed salad for brunch/lunch or on it's own for a delectable lazy breakfast (fit the dough into the tart part and cook the bacon and onions the night before so all you have is assembly the next day!)

My friend made this for a brunch this past Sunday, and it was wonderful. She mentioned that she'd found it at epicurious, so I hunted it down to save it in my own recipe box. I'll definitely make this.

This was delicious but too rich for my tastes. I suggest following others' recommendations of substituting half-and-half for the creme fraiche.

Oh wow so delicious! I followed this recipe closely, used homemade creme fraiche. This is rich and delicious, perfect sliced thin as an hors d'oeuvres. I did grate less than a quarter cup of Manchego on top for a twist and it was subtle but lovely. I had the smallest amount left to pour into a tiny tart to try before serving.

I added the Gruyere as suggested but put it on top (and pressed it in so the custard covered it a bit). I used 3 jumbo eggs instead of 4 large. I used a very high sided tart pan and so it took a longer time to cook through - would use a more traditional tart pan or pie plate next time. I should have reduced the salt with the cheese - it was too salty. But it was a hit anyway.

I followed this recipe closely, though substituted shortening for more butter, half n half to lighten it a bit, and used a mix of onions and shallots, for more nutty/sweet flavor. i also added a layer of grated swiss cheese in the end, under the broiler.. YUMMERS. the crust is uber flaky and the filling melts in your mouth!!

It's a great, great dish. I'm happy that other reviewers have enjoyed the dish even with what appears to me to be substantial changes that would be certain to alter the taste and texture of the tart. It's incredible as cooked and it is absolutely authentic if you prepare it the way Chef recommends.

Excellent but could use some treaking for individual tastes. I followed other reviewers' advice and reduced richness by substituting half and half for cream and two whole eggs and one egg yolk instead of 4 eggs. I had a problem getting all the custard in the tart pan - too shallow - so used a deep dish 10-11" pie pan the second time around. This is an excellent leftover when reheated for a few seconds in the microwave.

This was fabulous! I made it for brunch. I used turkey bacon and threw in a little gruyer cheese. I'll definately make it again!

I served this as a luncheon entree with thin wedges of honeydew and cantaloupe, also a tart green salad.

Delicate yet rich. What a perfect recipe for my spring onions. Followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change anything.

Absolutely delicious, though rather rich. I made it with crème fraîche, might try 15% cream next time.

this was just OK - really more like a glorified quiche. i had high expectations and was disappointed. I served at room temp and really should be served quite warm.

Made this for a Sunday brunch and everyone loved it. It is very rich and flavoursome and fed four greedy adults, accompanied by a potato salad, a green salad and some fresh French bread. I made it as written with the sole exception of substituting diced pancetta for the bacon as I had some to hand. Very easy to make and very highly recommended.

I made this last year as an experiment to serve to my family during the holidays. They are very picky eaters, and very suspicious of trying anything new. So, I decided to slip a wedge of this on the plate with the starter salad. The response has been unbelievable -- everyone loves it. They love it as a main course with a salad for dinner, or a sliver as a starter. Now I have to make it for every major holiday as a starter. Terrific! I have used heavy cream instead of creme fraiche; both are good, but I prefer it with creme fraiche. Also I have used a pre-made crust, and again, I prefer the home-made crust. One problem with the pre-made crust is that it is in pie-tin which is not quite as deep as my tart pan, and also the sides are slanted like a pie, not perpendicular like a tart pan.

I made this dish for my "Book Club" and everyone loved it. Not a morsel left. I even served it slightly chilled because I prepared it the day before. I think it would be even better warm. Made a few changes. Used 3 slices of bacon instead of 4. Reserved 1 Tblsp of the bacon fat and added 2 Tblsp of butter to saute the onions in. Used 3 lbs of yellow onions instead of 2 lbs. Reduced the cream to 3/4 of a cup. Used a packaged pie crust and did not cook beforehand to save time. Cooked it at 375 degrees for 40-45 minutes. This is a delicious dish. I will serve it again and again.

I made this tart for a French food supper club and everyone raved about it so that I had to send the recipe around afterwards! I also made it for Easter dinner with a different crowd and they loved it. It is a little time consumming and I fought with the pastry dough both times, but it is well worth it. I followed the suggestion of adding gruyere cheese on the bottom of the pie crust and it was delicious. This is one that will remain at the top of the recipe box.

Wonderful recipe...I cheated and used a ready made crust, but this recipe is all about the filling...carmelized the onions (took about 1 hour) and used creme fraiche

Really tasty. I sprinkled 1/4 cup grated Gruyere into the baked tart shell then spread onion filling evenly over the cheese (adapted from a similar recipe from The Lutece Cookbook). Perfect!

This dish is incredibly rich, but absolutely sublime when served with a salad (i made a lemon vinagrette and tossed it w/crispy romaine - a nice textural contrast to the tart.) be sure to roll the dough fairly thin; a thick dough will overwhelm the very delicate flavor of the tart.

One of the best recipes off this site. Followed the recipe almost to a tee. I deglazed the onions with some white wine and I only used half the dough. So good and beautiful.

A really lovely and elegant dish. A thin wedge with a simple salad made a nice starter for my dinner party. Very good warm and at room temperature. I would agree with increasing the amount of bacon if you like the smoky flavor, and caramelizing the onions until deep golden brown really brings out the flavor. Also, if you're going to serve it room temperature, I wouldn't top with cheese. It will harden and make it difficult to cut.

Girlfriend made this for me the other day, and it is wonderful. Time consuming, but not difficult. We used margerine instead of the butter and the vegetable shortening, and the dish turned out great. Very mild, yet great taste.

Time-consuming, but well worth the effort. The smoky-sweet bacon-onion mixture and the nutmeg give this tart a wonderful flavour. It's already very heavy, so I used less creme fraichce in my base and added some milk to it instead. I agree with the cook from Luxembourg that cooking the onions for a long time to maximise flavour is key, and next time I will try his suggestion of topping the tart with cheese. I might also use a little more bacon, but this recipe was terrific even as written.

I made this with creme fraiche as it is readily available in France. It was tres bon. But my daughter prefers the Flammenkuche (sp?).

such good flavor! my pastry dough was not behaving properly, but the finished product tasted great. the onions become sweet, giving off a soft flavor in your mouth. i might add more bacon next time, and take the advice of gruyere on top. definitely a good staple recipe for an onion tart, open to experimentation.

Very tasty, but richrichrich! Just one thin slice, and you've ingested enough calories to last from here to next Tuesday. Serve this with a very bright, green salad, and skip dessert.

Overall this is a very good recipe. I'm American, but my husband is from Strasbourg and this is one of my favourite dishes! The secret to making this great is to used smoked bacon/lardons if you can at all find it. Also - you must have the right onions - medium yellow works best, not white or red! The onions must be sliced as thinly as possible, and cooked slowly - I let mine caramelise to a nice light to medium brown color - don't worry, when you put them in the pan it looks like a huge amount but it greatly reduces in volume if you take time to cook properly. Don't skimp on cooking time - it takes a good 20-30 minutes or more! One big change - I always top with freshly grated gruyere cheese before baking - use swiss or emmenthal if you can't find gruyere. Also, my custard is less eggy - I use 3/4 cup milk, 3/4 cup heavy cream, 2 egg yolks only, and 1/3 cup flour for my base. (don't forget the nutmeg and S&P to taste!) And I don't pre-bake the crust. If I'd cut corners I'd do it on the pastry side rather than the onion side. At dinner parties we often serve this as a starter, then for the main meal we serve meat dish (often roasted without heavy sauce) and a few vegetables. Or can be served as a light meal with a simple lettuce/vinagerette salad on the side.
