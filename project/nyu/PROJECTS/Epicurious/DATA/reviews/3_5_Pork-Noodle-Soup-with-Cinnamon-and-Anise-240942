Noticed quite a few concerns about the broth not being substantial. I solved this by browning the pork and using deglazed liquid. Did not have the wine/sherry, so I omitted, and I don't think the broth suffered for lack of it. The house smelled INCREDIBLE while it was simmering. Some of you had a great tip about cooking the noodles separately so as not to absorb too much of the broth.

I listened to other reviewers and substituted 2c of the water for beef stock. I also added onion, carrot, celery, and ginger along with the garlic, and ended up having an extra pound of ribs so I threw that in as well. I too used dry sherry. I made the broth the night before like someone suggested, let it sit in the fridge, and scooped the fat out the next day easily. I also cooked the noodles separately, since I didn't want them to soak up all yummy broth!

I agree that I too thought the soup was lacking. I really liked the other's suggestions to make it POP more, and added celery, green onion, ginger, red pepper flakes, shredded bamboo shoots, and some pork and beef base to it. We served it with more green onion, the cilantro, and sriracha sauce on the side. I would also cut back on the sugar.

This soup was surprisingly boring, with the broth just tasting a lot like soy sauce. I ended up having to doctor it up a bit, using suggestions from other reviewers. I didn't mind that the noodles soak up the broth. I won't make this again.

Really tasty!! It needed more broth at the end - I made a broth of vigor and soaked the noodles in that before cooking. Noodles need to be soaked, more liquid at end, and serve w/mung beans as well as cilantro/scallion. Fabulous and my coworkers were all jealous of the leftovers!

Incredible! Used dry sherry (which I love) and anise seed. Was even better the next day, with friends. Did soak noodles per instructions on package, and did add more broth (just a mixture of water, more soy sauce, and sherry) after refrigerating overnight. This is a huge winner and will definitely be made again. Satisfying and comforting. Sriracha a must.

I threw this in my crockpot while at work all day. I tossed it in the fridge over night in order to let the fat rise. The chilled fat comes off in pieces. I soaked the cellophane noodles separate.

Made this with Asian wheat noodles, skipped the sugar (for a more savoury soup), substituted half the soy sauce with Thai fish sauce, and added some sliced chilli padis. It was easy to prepare, and excellent to taste. Would definitely make this again.

Great Flavor! I used equal parts chicken broth, beef broth, and water. Took the advice of soaking the noodles, glad I did. I will use ginger next time.

This was just like a dish that we get at our favorite sushi place. The noodles did suck up most of the broth. I will consider cooking them seperately then adding them at the end. I also added celery, carrots, onions and portabella mushrooms. Will consider using a beef pot roast and slicing it thin next time.

WOW! Tasty soup! Worth the effort! I cooked the ribs and let it cool overnight, much easier to skim the layer of fat off. Cooked noodles separately and added red pepper, mushrooms and spinach at the end. Yum!

I really easy to prepare dish that has big flavor. I would NOT recommend soaking the noodles in water before hand. I tried this and it caused soup to taste a bit water downed.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was INSANE! Super easy to prepare, just popped everything into a big old pot and let 'er simmer for three hours. You really do have to skim that fat off, and there's a lot of it. I added a generous splash of fish sauce at the end, and a hot red pepper with the green onions and cilantro. Oh, and the noodles- I soaked them in boiling water for fifteen minutes (until they go translucent), drained them and popped them into the broth. Amazing, easy, and it filled the house with a maddening scent- like a real chinese restaurant. Quick, hearty, easy, delicious!

This soup is great, and gets made at least a couple of times during the winter. I do add some nappa cabbage right at the end, and serve with sriracha on the side to spice it up as much as desired.

This recipe was delicious - an easy substitute for authentic pho with the same basic flavors. I used a cheap pork shoulder roast which I cut off the bone in large chunks and browned well in a nonstick pan. Browning the pork added amazing flavor. From there, I sauteed onion/garlic/ginger and then added back the bone from the roast and 1 part water to 2 parts homemade roasted chicken stock. I also strained the finished stock through cheesecloth to get a nice, clear broth.

The soup is too sweet. Next time I make this, I will cut down the brown sugar to 1 Tbsp maximum. I added a few slices of ginger, some peppercorns, a hot dried chili pepper. When the soup was ready to be served, I stirred in some fish sauce and some lime juice.

After going to three grocery stores in Chicago I was unable to find Star Anise anywhere (the asian markets were closed for the lunar new year, just my luck). So, I was forced to make the recipe with anise extract. This recipe was really quite good but the anise flavor was a little too strong for me. Of course, with no guidelines, this could be my fault for putting in too much extract. Other than that though, this couldn't be easier to make and it came out delicious. No doubt it's unusual in its flavor but I'd definitely make it again. And to other cooks, yes, you must soak the noodles first as instructed on the packaging, or you will end up with ZERO broth.

I added some ginger and used a combo of chicken broth and waterinstead of plain water. I also added kombu seaweed and shiitaki mushrooms. The cinnamon and star anise are such a wonderful accompaniment to the pork ribs. Ooh! I also used watercress instead of cilantro. Great!

Definitely a keeper but we all decided that it still needed a bit of tweaking. Perhaps because we are all sick with the cold from hell it didn't have the flavor I expected. I used the ingredients as stated except I added a 1/4 tsp of sichuan peppercorns. Still seemed to need a hit of salt. We used sriracha as an additional condiment along with the cilantro and green onions. Bottom line - it smelled amazing during the long cold afternoon while we waited for snow (that never showed up!) and according to my gourmet 18 year old son, I need to try again.

Wan't too excited with this soup. Pro's are that it is easy to make and I liked the pork and noodles (which prepare well when soaked in boiling water for 15 minutes than added to broth). The chinese wine and whole anise was very inexpensive ($5 for both) and easily found at any asian food market. However, it reminds me of Japanese sukiyaki broth and I must say, I like the sukiyaki broth SO much better! This was missing a little zing which is why many reviewers seem to add in chili ingredients. Maybe I'll try that next time to make it better. However, I highly recommend using the recipe for 'Sukiyaki with Red Snapper' in place of this broth. I would then give this a 4 star.

I'm confused about the "1 head garlic, halved crosswise". Do you take a whole head and cut it so that the cloves are all cut in half? What do you do with your other half?

Very good, but a few notes: I cooked on an extremely low heat for longer, to tenderize the pork. Used chicken stock instead of water, and added a few split thai chili peppers. I've found that cellophane noodles work best when cooked on a very low heat (seperately) for just a few minutes, and then rinsed in cold water to stop the cooking. We then added noodles to individual bowls, topped with the soup, cilantro and scallions, and added bean sprouts and some sriracha. Yum.

I also have not tried the recipe yet. Regarding the noodles absorbing most of the broth, you'd might want to try soaking them in warm water until pliable, maybe for 10-15 minutes, then adding it to broth. This way, the noodles do not absorb the soup. Hope this helps.

Nice soup. I used chicken stock instead of water and will add 5 spice powder next time. I also threw in some shredded green cabbage right before I served it. Nice texture and flavor.

Outstanding dish. Very simple and delish. I used a pork shoulder so I tweeked the cooking time, but kept the ratio of ingredients the same -- it really is perfect as written -- a nice change from the typical asian noodle soup. I served it with spring rolls -- a nice soup and salad meal.

Excellent easy to prepare dish. I had to make a few minor adjustments (substitute ingredients) but the end result was outstanding. I used cooking sherry, rice noodles and Chinese Five Spice (in place of the star anise). I also followed the recomendation and set aside some of the broth...and boy am I glad I did. The noodles just suck up all of the broth.

Haven't tried the recipe yet, but looking at it, seems a take-off of a northern Chinese soup that uses beef chunks instead, with Chinese flat noodles and a few dried red chilies. (tagliatelle-type). And please, please, do take note that there is NO flavor substitute for star anise; most especially anise seed is a different flavor altogether!!!

This was quite tasty. I washed the noodles well and they still soaked up a lot of the broth. Next time I think I will increase the broth 1 1/2x. Also make sure you very slowly simmer the pork, mine came out a little over cooked.

Yum!! My family, including two young children, loved this meal. I added a bag of baby spinach to make it a complete one-dish meal. I'm making it again this weekend and will definitely make sure I rinse the noodles well.

I agree that this tasted great, but the recipe must not be correct if one follows the directions to the letter but winds up having the noodles soak up all the broth. I'd recommend dividing the broth, adding the noodles and meat, and adding the remainded of the broth to each portion once it's been plated. Otherwise, this is pork and noodles, not soup!

This was an easy recipe, very tasty and clean tasting. I substituted anise seed as well, as there was no star anise to be found here. Also, I added about 10 szechuan peppercorns.

WOW! This was fantastic. And actually pretty easy to make. I forgot to rinse the noodles too and did think there wasn't enough broth, so it's good to know that perhaps the rinsing step will prevent that in the future. I only had 2oz of bean thread noodles on hand, so I also added rice noodles, which worked fine. Also, I used dry sherry. Definitely add the cilantro and onion for extra yumminess! I served with a side of broccolini for a complete meal.

This soup is absoutely FABULOUS!!! Full of flavor and very filling. I used low-sodium Tamari soy sauce because I prefer the more robust flavor. To the cook from the Bay Area - 1/2 tsp of crushed anise seed is about right. For the cinnamon, it's about 1/2 tsp per cinnamon stick. Lesson learned - rinse the bean threads very well or they will absorb too much of the broth.

Very delicious - this is great Chinese comfort food and satisfies cravings for stewed pork. Since we lacked the fresh spices, we substituted 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of ground star aniseed powder, and it still tasted wonderful. If others have better ratio suggestions for powder substitutes, please share. Also, we didn't bother shredding the pork after we took it off the bone (that can save some prep time). Instead, we just mixed in the whole chunks with the broth, which kept the meat juicy and flavorful on its own, but it doesn't look as presentable if serving to guests.

This was really good. I used udon noodles instead. Don't laugh but for the meat I found really cheap kabob type chunks of mystery pork at my local Super Wal-Mart and lo and behold, they cooked up super tender. My only advice would be to put the cin sticks in a cheesecloth as mine came apart and I had trouble fishing them out. My kids even liked this. Layers of flavor, complex tasting and super easy to make. The house smelled very enticing. ENJOY.

This recipe was delicious and easy! I could not find star anise at my grocery, so I used some anise seeds and some whole cloves (about 10 of each) instead. The resulting broth had amazing flavor, and the meat became melt-in-your-mouth tender. The fresh cilantro and scallions are important to the final flavor experience, so don't skip them! You may be tempted to use more noodles than called for, but don't, as they end up absorbing all of the broth. I will definitely make this again and again, much to the delight of my husband and teenage daughter!
