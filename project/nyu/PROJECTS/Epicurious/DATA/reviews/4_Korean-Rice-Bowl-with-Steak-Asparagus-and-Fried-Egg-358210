My wife and I like this dish very much and it is easy to make. We buy roasted black sesame seed (iri kurogoma) available at Asian markets instead of making our own and use hot chili sesame oil that spices it up to our taste.

What a great recipe! Don't forget the kimchi. We didn't have any, but my wife made an impromptu fast kimchi and it added a really nice heat element. The marinade is really tasty. Great quick meal!

I didn't make the entire recipe, but I found the marinade for the beef to be underwhelming. I was hoping for something that would taste a bit more the Korean BBQ we get at a restaurant

This was the first vehicle for my homemade kimchi and even my doubting husband approved. I subbed a beautiful grass fed flank steak because that was what I had and used broccoli and kale for the veggies. Can't wait for leftovers for lunch.

This has become a common meal for us. Everyone loves it. I do make extra salt to have on hand,it cuts the prep time. We also use flank steak and BBQ it for extra flavor. I add stir fried veggies. Superb!

I loved this recipe! It was so very easy. We didn't do the sesame seed salt or anything and didn't use some of the other seasonings, but I did follow the beef marinade recipe, which made the dish. Super easy if you let the beef marinade while the rice is cooking. Took me about 40 minutes total. We served it with soy sauce and sriracha sauce. This may become a regular dish for us!

Ok Ok maybe I was expecting more. This was soooo disappointing. I prepared the recipe to the letter. It turned out dry, boring, uninspired. It was like eating a bunch of leftovers slopped in a bowl. Sad.

This was excellent! I've made this several times now and love it. We are big korean barbecue fans, and the marinade on this beef was so flavorful! We use a top sirloin steak instead, which came out tender (be careful not to overcook the steak- it's thin, it cooks fast). I also use brown jasmine rice instead of white, since I have it in the cupboard. I didn't bother looking for fleur de del, but used sea salt instead. I also find it's better to only use about half of the sesame salt mixture on the asparagus- the rest is delicious sprinkled on the rice! The kimchi is a key component to the bowl, adding spice and tanginess. I am very happy with this dish.

Terrific marinade. I substituted sugar snaps for the asparagus and I did not bother with the salt but it was yummy anyway. Everyone, including the two kids loved it.

We loved this recipe, a very nice comfort meal and not too heavy. Can't wait to make it again!

Very good recipe. It was a little tricky finding fleur de sel and I thought that it really wasn't necessary and I used flank steak but the recipe is very good and my daughter is dropping by for the leftovers. Yummo.

I've made this meal 3 times and absolutely love it! I substituted shrimp for the beef using the same marinade and it was delicious! I also reduced the sugar to only 1 tablespoon, replaced vegetable with oil olive to make it a little more healthy. I also added mushrooms and bean sprouts to increase the veggies. Note, if using the beans sprouts, add them in during the last minute of sauteing the other veggies.

I made this for my American born, Japanese wife and she loved it. I followed the recipe mostly, but substituted skirt steak for strip and it worked out perfectly. I used dry Sherry instead of sake. Quick, easy and delicious.... the trifecta!

Wow. Wonderful. Found homemade kimchi at an asian market and they had great looking thinly sliced beef so to really save time, could get the meat at the market next time and there will be a next time. grilled meat and asparagus, otherwise, followed recipe exactly. Excellent!

Save yourself the trouble and buy the sesame salt...at an Asian grocery store.

Fabulous flavors! I made a double batch of the sesame salt and have used it on other vegetables. Be sure you have Korean hot sauce on the table.

Made this last night, great recipe, and it tasted great. Here's some photographic evidence of my labors. http://www.flickr.com/photos/bump/sets/72157623834887660/

Great! Used flank steak since it was what I had in the freezer. Will make again, but grill the meat and asparagus.

This was a crowd pleaser. I also didn't make the seaseme salt, and leftovers were good the second day. will definitely make again

FAR from authentic bibimbap, but very delicious, nontheless. I roasted the asparagus and used flank steak (cheaper and leaner and more flavorful) instead of NY strip, and had some lovely brown jasmine rice I used instead of white. Good and good for you!

Absolutely delicious. I would totally make this dish again!

The perfect weeknight dinner! This dish is fast, flavorful, filling, and so delicious. I also didn't make the sesame salt, and it was still great.

Delicious! The marinade for the meat was perfect, and the tip of freezing the steak allowed me to slice it extra thin, just as our favorite Korean BBQ place does. I did not make the sesame salt (no sesame seeds on hand). I just drizzled a little sesame oil on the asparagus and tossed with salt and chili powder. It was just fine. Don't skip the kim chee! It added great flavor to the dish. I would get a mild kim chee (not the hot) - we like spicy food, and the mild kim chee was plenty spicy.

This was amazing!! Mouth watering, tasty, aromatic good! My family loved it so much that my 8 year old licked her bowl clean and then said, "Hey Mom, you forgot to give me dinner, can I have some?" She then put in a request for me to make it EVERY night! The only changes I made was to add some sugar snap peas with the asparagus (because my youngest doesn't like asparagus) and to use jasmine rice, because the only medium or short grain rice Whole Foods had was either $9 for one bag or short grain brown rice. The jasmine was fragrant and worked perfectly. It was especially good with the sesame salt sprinkled on top. My girls also think that now we should have rice & eggs for breakfast with the yummy sesame salt. This dish is going to definitely become part of our regular rotation.
