Being a native-New Yorker of Creole descent (my Mom's from New Orleans), I must say it's a no-no to make gumbo with tomatoes. So my relatives refused to call this unusual Christmas-dish "gumbo". Nevertheless, the flavorful and hearty main-course received unanamous high praises from a New York/Louisianna crowd that's difficult to please when it comes to satisfying the palate! Having prepared the dish, I now know how to divide its evolution into separate days. This is not a meal you want to prepare all in one day if you can avoid it. I got started at about 9AM Xmas morning and we sat down to eat at about 6PM. My one big regret is that I didn't ask the butcher to cut the goose into pieces. This was the worst part of the recipe. Goose bones are no joke to tackle at home! Also, I used a good smoked turkey sausage instead of the tasso since my family no longer eats red meat. It held its own, adding a balance of strong spicy flavor. I also generously sprinkled each person's serving with "file" (pronounced fee-lay, a gumbo seasoning of sassafras leaves) and added a few shakes of Louisianna hot sauce, as well. This resulted in a wonderful layering of flavors that we Creoles love! We started the meal with a salad of baby lettuce, cherry tomatoes and cucumber, sprinkled lightly with Good Seasonings Italian dressing, made fresh with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The main course was served over white rice with crusty french bread and wine. If you want to serve a special, unique, gourmet-caliber winter meal, that's more tasty and tender than beef stew and more hearty (and a lot more sexy) than chicken soup, this is the recipe for you. Today I'm trying the potatoes roasted in goose fat using some of the leftover fat, as suggested. Final warning - don't eat too much goose or goose fat in one day. It's high in cholesterol! On second thought, just get out the stair stepper and go for it!
