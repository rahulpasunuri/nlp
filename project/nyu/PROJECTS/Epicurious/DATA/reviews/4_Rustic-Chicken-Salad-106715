I was looking for a way to use my farm share fennel, and this was a big hit. I followed the recipe except no parsley. It was a nice, light summer meal served with french bread. Even my five year old approved!

This salad was delicious. I followed the recipe almost exactly. It's perfect for lunch or a light dinner served on a bed of greens. The vinaigrette is great too.

It's too bad this recipe got an unfair 'review' by someone who never made it! This salad is fantastic! I've made it over the years for company and numerous picnics. It travels well and no need to be concerned about mayonnaise spoiling. You will impress your guests with this salad as it is truly gourmet - something you'd find at an upscale gourmet deli! It's great served over salad greens or on it's own with a lovely baguette...enjoy.
