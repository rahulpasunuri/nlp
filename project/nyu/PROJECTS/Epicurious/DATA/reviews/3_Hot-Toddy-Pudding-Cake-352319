Delightful! Very bright lemon flavor, and perfect for a cold winter evening. Also fairly easy to throw together.

Too lemon-y... needs something else to flavor it. Was okay, but lacking. Not sure I would try it again truthfully.

If you enjoy drinking hot toddy, this is a wonderful comfort dessert. Since I like my toddy spiced, I did the same with this recipe. I steeped the milk with 1 cinnamon stick, 1 star anise, and 2 whole cloves. To finish, I grated fresh nutmeg on top. Delightful.

No forks - Yuck! I made this recipe to the letter, including the scotch, and it was not good. This was for a small group of people who enjoy both scotch and lemony things. It's too lemony and I don't think the scotch cooked "out" all the way. It definitely needs more sugar. I'd tinker with the recipe, but I really don't think it's worth it. I just won't bother making it again.
