Very good. Works well with any good hard crusted bread such as French or Italian. If you can get good sherry vinegar, it's even better.

I used an oil mist bottle to spray the bread and used light wheatl bread. This lowered the calorie content but was just as delicious.

I multiplied this to serve 20 for a recent party. It was simple and tasty. It was a nice compliment to the Italian main dish. Except for buying the fresh mesclun, all of the ingredients are things I usually have on hand in my pantry, so I think it is a good salad to whip up at the last minute as part of a quick & easy dinner. I will definately make this again and again.
