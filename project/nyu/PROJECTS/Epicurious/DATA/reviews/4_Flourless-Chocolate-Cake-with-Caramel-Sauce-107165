I made this cake twice. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly and the top of the cake looked like the moon (cracking would have been the least of my concerns). It was also overcooked around the edges and bottom. Undaunted, I made a second cake. This time, I banged the pan on the counter a couple of times as I would to get air bubbles out of a regular cake containing flour. It made absolutely no difference. The second cake's surface also resembled the moon. I also baked the second cake for only 35 minutes, taking it out of the oven just when a toothpick inserted in the middle was coming out clean. Notwithstanding this, the sides and bottom of the second cake were also overcooked. I do not believe it is my oven, as this is the only time I have had a problem like this. I did use a dark-colored springform pan and I am wondering if that may be the source of the problem. I welcome any thoughts others may have!

Throw out any other chocolate cake recipe that you have. I have been using this recipe for years. It doesn't need the sauce, either. This is rich, smooth chocolate cake that stands on its own every time.

I made this caramel sauce to go with another flourless chocolate cake recipe on Epicurious. I only had salted butter and the sugar got a tad burnt but it still came together nicely. At first it was very thin, too thin for my liking. But after cooling it thickened up nicely, and after a night in the fridge it was a lovely consistency that easily spread/drizzled without any warming.

Absolutely easy & DELISH! Instead of the caramel I make either a cranberry sauce or a raspberry sauce for it, depending on the season. Berries, brandy, orange juice, orange peel, sugar. Boil it & let cool. It makes a sort of delightful jelly to cut the sweet of the cake. Every time someone has us over for dinner now they request this cake, thankfully it's easy to make!

Very disappointing, though, I guess expectations should be lowered for any flourless cake. Big waste of all those eggs, butter, and sugar.

I made this for Sunday lunch dessert particularly for my friend who has wheat intolerance. I used 1/2 semisweet and 1/2 bittersweet chocolate chips and only 1 cup sugar and the taste was really good and not too sweet. Goodness knows there's enough sugar in the caramel sauce, which also turned out very well. I shall certainly cook this easy and impressive dessert again.

I am in the minority who did not think this cake was anything special. The cake was light but, believe it or not, I thought it wasn't "chocolatey" or rich enough. It was very easy to prepare and uses ingredients I always have on hand, but I don't think the ease of preparation makes up for the lack of flavor. FYI, I used salted butter; the top of my cake cracked; the cake fell a little as it cooled.

I used dark chocolate and cut the sugar to just under a cup. I added salt and baked it about 50 minutes at 250 (this was accidental, but resulted in a nice moist, dense texture... no problems with it falling as some people have mentioned.) The caramel sauce was a nice counterpoint to the sweetness of the cake.

Didn't have cocoa powder, so I had to substitute with 1/2 cup of cake flour. Also I separated the eggs and beat the egg whites with 1/4 cup of sugar, just like a meringue and incorporated to the rest of the batter carefully so not to break the whites. Added vanilla and almond extracts to the chocolate batter. Turned out perfect very truffle like tasting, let it sit 1 day (if you can) even better.

Wonderful, and exceptionally easy recipe. I baked it in my convection oven at 325 degrees, for only 35 minutes, and the top cracked, much like cheesecakes do. It was puffed up when removed from the oven, but collapsed perfectly, about 10 minutes later - but the cracks remained. To save the "look" of the cake, I inverted it upside down on my cake plate. I covered the entire cake in chocolate ganache (1 cup whipping cream with 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate melted). I piped rosettes around the entire top and edges. Piled a bunch of fresh raspberries in the middle with a little dusting of powdered sugar, and it looked as good as it tasted!

I made this for Passover. Thankfully it was only family as the cake was impossible to cut so the presentation was less than attractive but the taste was superb. I did not make the sauce. It was sweet enough on its own. Everyone, especially the children loved it and want it again.

This cake is delicious, I have eaten at the restaurant it comes from many times, but never tried this, now I don't have to, I can make it myself! I did have trouble with the caramel sauce, and would suggest using store bought to keep it simple. It it also great with a raspberry sauce... yum! It is now my go-to chocolate cake recipe.

I have made this cake a number of times. It is easy and super delicious. I have to say I haven't even taken the time to make the caramel sauce - it is that good on its own. I just make some fresh whipped cream to go with it. I found it to be the perfect dessert for Passover, or a chocolate lover!

This was my first attempt at a flourless chocolate cake. It was so easy to make and I love that I had all the ingredients in my house. I did use a 9" springform and I was worried about the edges getting overcooked while the middle finished up- I checked it obsessively every 5 minutes after 35 and it did take 50 minutes to finish but the edges were fine. I had read about others having problems with the cake falling- this didn't happen and I was feeling great and kind of smug- until I cut into it in front of guests, the top collapsed and there was about a 4 inch gap between the top layer and the rest of the cake. Oh well, it tasted great and the carmel sauce was soooo good, it took exactly 7 minutes to get to an amber shade and 380 on my candy thermometer. I cut the lemon down to 3/4 t. after reading other reviews. I will make this again.

Used half sugar, half corn syrup and half bittersweet chocolate, half semisweet. Texture was amazing. Next time I'll reduce baking time by 5-10 minutes; edges were drier than I would have liked.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving when a chocolate dessert was requested to balance out the traditional holiday desserts. I used slightly less lemon juice after reading another review, used high quality chocolate and cocoa - a must for this - dusted with powdered sugar, served with whipped cream and the caramel sauce on the side. Simple and delicious.

So easy and delicious. The top was cracked and uneven so I put a layer of unsweetened whipped cream on top of the cake. It looked lovely and the cream really helped to cut the sweetness. The caramel sauce was wonderful and really made this an outstanding and different flourless chocolate cake. Can't wait to make again for company.

I made this for passover. My husband and I observe, but my company was not Jewish, so I wanted something that would please everyone, but would not have flour. It was great and a huge hit. The only thing was the carmel sauce came out a bit bitter. I may have boiled it a drop too long?

I made 2 cakes in the same day for a birthday. For the first cake I used Scharffen Berger Cocoa Powder. I was puzzled because it comes in a 6 oz package, looked like 2 cups, but very tightly packed it was one cup. Next time will use the whole 6 oz package without measuring, very convenient. I used organic semisweet chips and organic sugar. Also, used "organic valley" butter & eggs" as I am told they are from grass fed cows and the fat processes differently. Who knows, I was making it for a birthday cake on request for someone. All I know is that it was gone and calories are calories organic or not. On the second cake, again on request, I substituted dark agave nectar for sugar and organic bittersweet chocolate instead of semisweet. The other ingredients were the same. Cooking time was the same, and the cake was more moist, and had slightly more volume. It was less sweet, but hard to say whether because of the agave or change in chocolate. I used 9.25 springform - nonstick, no wax paper on one, parchment paper on the the other- no difference. I served with the raspberry sauce on this site - raspberries, liquer, lemon juice and sugar, as well as fresh whipped cream. I have never thought of chocolate as an aphrodesiac...but...upon tasting, pretty much all of the women at the party were thinking of one thing, and the men -seeing the look on their wives face, were of similar mind. Will definitely make again.

This cake was so delicious! Made it for Christmas dinner with the in-laws. It was huge hit. I offered the caramel sauce or whipped cream and fresh raspberries. It was all gone in a flash. The chocolate flavor is sophisticated, perfectly sweetened. I used Ghirardelli chocolate and cocoa being a San Francisco girl, but I may try Dagoba next time.

This is absolutely wonderful, if you're not concerned about fat and calories. It felt like my pants were tightening with each CRUMB! I took it to a function and it was the rave, for sure. I have to tell you, though, I cheated. I bought Hot Caramel topping for ice cream, and raspberry sauce. I took them in separate dishes and they were warmed in a warming carrier. Nobody asked me if I made the sauces; they just assumed I did. :) I did take credit for the cake and it was the best, and SO EASY!

I made this for Passover and my family loved it! I didn't have chocolate chips so used 8 oz of Lindt bittersweet chocolate bars instead. Also used a 9" rather than 10" springform, and that worked out fine. As others, I did not increase the baking time (ok, maybe a minute or two), and the cake came out really dense and moist. Yes, the top cracked, but it settled down as it cooled. My family loves the caramel sauce, but I thought this one had a too-lemony taste. I don't really like caramel too much anyway. Next time I will make a raspberry sauce or just some lightly whipped cream. My husband keeps eating it and saying it is "professional, restaurant quality." I have to laugh - I can barely cook!

This is a great, make ahead dessert. I omitted the carmel sauce in favor of powdered sugar sprinkled on top +/- fresh rasberries. I coated the springform with canola cooking oil spray and skipped the wax paper. This can be made a day or two ahead and stored in foil or plastic container.

I should have posted this review when I made this cake last year fora group of friends. It was absolutely delicious and they requested that I make it again despite a couple things that went wrong. Despite lining the bottom with was paper , the cake got really stuck! And as another reviewer mentioned, the cake was very crumbly and fell apart when I tried to serve it. Thank goodness everyone had enough cocktails to think it was terribly funny...while still exclaiming "this cake is so damn good!" Does anyone have any suggestions? I am definitely going to try to use a high end chocolate this year. Maybe that will help.

Easy enough to make, purchasing high quality chocolate and cater to your personal taste. I used a cup of unsweetend and half a cup of a strong dark 80% coco chocolate. Instead of ice cream, I made wipped cream. The cake was made for a dinner party and each individual adored the cake!

This cake is EXTREMELY rich. Serve your guests only a sliver of this cake. A little goes a long way. It was extremely easy to make and make sure you don't bake it too long so it remains moist. I did not make the caramel sauce but served it with a sauce made from melted ice cream (I just put a couple of scoops in the fridge until it melted) which I spooned around bottom of slice, topped with a little whipped cream and fresh raspberries. The whipped cream and fruit toned down the richness a bit. My dinner guests loved it.

The four forks is for the caramel sauce...delicious! One guest jokingly asked for a cup so he could just drink it! The cake was very easy, very rich.

Of course I will make this dish again! Of all the rich choc recipes I've tried, this is the easiest and the best-tasting. How couldn't it with chocolate and cocoa? It's simply genius. I also made the caramel sauce, which was a perfect accompaniment, but totally superfluous. It was my husband's birthday dinner so I also served whipped cream and raspberries but again, totally unnecessary. The cake is perfect even by itself, perhaps with a tall glass of milk. 1000 points.

Yum. This is super-easy to make and tastes just like a restaurant flourless chocolate cake. I agree with the reviewer who found 35 minutes to be plenty. The caramel sauce is great too-- though I would make it a little thicker next time. Serve with strawberries to lighten it up a bit.

I'm so happy I found this recipe!!! I'm attending a dinner party Friday night and the menu is from the Sideways movie and I was assigned the flourless chocolate cake. I found a recipe on another site and it was NOT good! It was a really wet cake. So, I came here to find a recipe and low and behold, exactly what I was looking for was right here! I just made a test cake to check out the recipe and it is AWESOME!!! I can't wait to see everyone's faces Friday night when they bite into this delight. I'm making this one again and again. :o) P.S. I'm a chocoholic and this definitely satisfies my chocolate tooth.

Whoa - an intense chocolate experience. The consistency of a particularly dense, fudgy brownie, but more intensely flavoured than most brownies could ever hope to be. The cake is nowhere near as sweet as you might expect it to be either (a good thing). I baked 10 minutes longer, as when I tested at 45 minutes, half the toothpick was coated in chocolatey sludge, though the cake had really risen. It fell shortly thereafter (expected in flourless cakes, however). The caramel sauce easily makes twice as much as needed, but as ice-cream season is soon to be upon us, the leftover can easily be put to good use. I agree the cake can serve up to 20 - a sliver will satisfy even most chocoholics - and it keeps well. Great result for little effort - a keeper.

I made this and it turned out wonderfully if flourless chocolate cake is what you're into. My husband and I decided we like a more traditional cake that isn't quite so rich, but if you're a chocoholic this is the cake for you! The caramel sauce didn't really stand out against the rich chocolate, but is wonderful warm over vanilla ice-cream. It'd also be good with apple crepes. I would make it again (it's also amazingly easy), but only if for a big group of chocolate fanatics.

Although I liked this cake, and it was, indeed, quite simple to make, for my time and money, I'd rather have Julia's Reine de Saba (Queen of Sheba!) cake from Mastering the Art of French Cooking.

Good, though unexceptional. I also skipped the caramel sauce and just dusted with confectioner's sugar and served with raspberry sauce and whipped cream. The cake was okay but oddly flavorless. I think it helps if you make it the day before and refrigerate it overnight. That adds to the density and texture of the cake. Not sure I would make it again. I have had much more intense and flavorful flourless chocolate cakes. Oh well, at least it was easy to make!

This is a fabulous recipe! I have several recipes for flourless chocolate cake and this is the easiest and best. Everyone from children to adult foodies loves it. I have used both Ghirardelli and Trader Joe's chocolate chips; both work fine. I use unsalted super-premium butter, Land O'Lakes Extra Creamy or Plugra, but this probably isn't necessary. I also add a small pinch of salt. My 9.5" springform pan works fine. Don't overbake this; a tester doesn't have to come out perfectly clean. And don't overbeat the egg mixture or the cake will rise a lot, then fall (but in an attractive way). I serve this with vanilla ice cream and sometimes whipped cream too; I think the caramel sauce is optional. Sift a little powdered sugar on top, serve it on a cake plate with a doily, and it looks like you spent hours making it. Oh, and it also freezes perfectly. What more could you ask?

this is soooo easy for the result you get! The cake is best made at least a day before, I have served it with ice cream (for a birthday), whipped cream, and with the ganache from the double chocolate layer cake from this site. it has been incredible everytime. this has actually replaced the double chocolate layer cake for me. you only need a tiny peice though! it is so rich!

Just made this cake for the first time (will serve it tomorrow after Christmas dinner). I'm assuming that it will taste great, but it sure doesn't look wonderful. It rose in the pan, with the center higher than the edge. The top was quite hard and after I took it out of the oven, it cracked into about four large sections. I think I've salvaged it by turning it over on to a serving dish, but am wondering if I did something seriously wrong. I mixed it by hand, rather than using my Kitchen Aid and won't do that again. Still, it smells fabulous -- I'm planning to serve it with raspberry sauce and whipped cream as I've prepared another dessert that features caramel. Comments please!

I've made this many times with no problems. Each time I've used unsalted butter and it's delicious. I must say that it gets better as the days pass. I now make this cake a day ahead, let it cool, wrap in saran and sit on a covered cake plate for at least 24 hours. Helps a bit with the dryness.

Tried it in both a 9" and 4" mini-springforms; I basically adjusted how much batter each container received. If you want to use a 9" instead of 10", just use a little less batter or expect to cook it a little longer and have a slightly more moist version. The smaller cakes were a bit more dry than the larger, but I was happy both ways. It's a very dense, dry cake, but for those not into rich chocolate, any cream dessert or sauce cuts it nicely. For the question below about butter: unspecified "butter" is generally salted.

Served this on Thanksgiving and it was a huge HIT! An exceptionally easy recipe for the cake. I burned the sauce a bit the first time (it was REALLY amber)but it was cheap and easy to make a second batch. A definite keeper.

Made this for a potluck after reading all the fantastic reviews, thinking of it as a test-run for Christmas dinner. It was incredibly easy! I made a raspberry sauce instead of the caramel sauce- good flavor combo, but the sauce was too thin to stand up to this. Next time I'll try drizzling with white chocolate. Trouble was, 12 slices were just too big/rich after the main course potluck. Absolutely not for the faint of heart, but I thought it was fabulous!

This was excellent. I made it with a pumpkin caramel sauce and served it with vanilla ice cream for thanksgiving. The cake is very rich though and most people could only eat a very small piece.

I did use margarine and everyone raved about the cake and it turned out fine. I also drizzled white chocolate and pecans on top instead of making the caramel sauce. It was great!

I just made this cake for the 2nd time, and it came out great once again. I made an espresso-caramel sauce to drizzle over the cake & ice cream instead of the caramel sauce from the recipe. Here's my espresso-caramel sauce for anyone who's interested: 1 can sweetened condensed milk 1 C brewed espresso Combine ingredients in med. saucepan, boil on low heat, stirring occasionally for the first 15 minutes, and then stirring constantly for another 10 - 15 until the mixture is cooked down to about 1/2 of original volume. A bit tedious, but I'm new to cooking and was worried I'd burn it if I tried to cook it over higher heat.

I made this for my daughter's birthday, there were seven of us with plenty of cake leftover. It was delicious! I also made the caramel sauce as per recipie, it was a little runny but good. I don't know if I would make the caramel sauce again but I will definitely make the cake again. It was easy to make and the grand finale to a special meal.

I really want to make this for an upcoming party, however one of my guests cannot have butter --- wonder if margarine would totally ruin it??? Any ideas?? Thanks

Happened on this recipe as I was perusing the new Epicurious website and made it on a whim.....in a word, it was fabulous! I made individual cakes in ramekins (baked approximately 25 minutes) and they came out perfect, slightly crunchy on the top and soft and fudgy on the inside. I didn't make the caramel sauce and after reading the reviews, I probably wouldn't. Too many other ways to serve this that are a lot less trouble! This is definitely a keeper and one that will certainly impress anyone who you serve it to!

This cake is incredible and extremely easy to do if you are pressed for time. I have made it both with and without the caramel sauce and do not find the sauce necessary.

This cake is definitely for hard core chocolate lovers and not for the faint hearted! No doubt it was a delicious cake, very rich and intense - moist inside and crispier on the outside, so it was a nice contrast. My guests loved it, but it was so rich, they didnt have room for anything else after! i served it with ice cream, and i would agree that the caramel sauce, though it added a nice touch, can be omitted.

Rating: 2
Good, but you have to like dense, moist, super-rich chocolate cake, which my "audience" didn't (they thought it was raw). The caramel sauce was totally unnecessary, probably because I didn't serve it with ice cream and instead dribbled it over the cake itself; not a great idea.

Great, easy recipie, made it twice, replace carmel sauce with fresh berries and vanilla ice cream once, and hot cherries and vanill ice cream the second time...great hit both times!

I liked this cake. It was very very easy to make. Maybe because it was so easy I didn't expect a lot. My guests raved. Said it was the best. Had to print recipe at the dinner party and then again for co-workers for the leftovers the next day. It is very rich and worth the calories was how one guest put it. I personally thought the carmel sauce was thin and lacked depth. Served this with whipped cream and raspberries. Good luck

A tip for those of you making the caramel sauce -- do NOT use a Calaphon pot (the dark ones)...you need a light colored pot (stainless or other) to see the caramel darken to "amber"...I was there with my flashlight trying to discern the color, without much success.

Rating: 2
The cake was quite good, extremely rich, and not difficult to make. Even a thin sliver of the cake was very satisfying. The caramel sauce, however, was not very exciting and was more sugary syrup without much depth to the caramel flavor. I guess I was hoping the sauce would be more like sweetened condensed milk caramel...

Very good EASY cake to make. Great recipe when you have to whip something up in a hurry! Taste like a big moist brownie.

This is wonderful, decadent, and easy. I made it for my book group, in particular for one member who can't eat wheat products. Everyone loved it. The smell of it baking the day before nearly drove my husband to distraction. Now I have leftovers for him to eat. The caramel sauce is wonderful and can be reheated in the microwave. I can't imagine adding ice cream too.

Simple & delicious! I made this cake for company, but specifically for a friend who is allergic to gluten. All 12 people at dinner raved about this cake. My gluten-free friend took the recipe, and the small remaining leftovers home. p.s. Almost everyone thought the caramel sauce was very good w/ this cake.

I amde several of these cakes for a function at church and people are still raving about them. I drizzled a bit of melted white chocolate over the pieces to serve and it looked quite elegant. I've taken this to work too and people now beg me to make it again. It is really delicious and very easy to make.

I am not an accomplished cook by any means, so if I can make this right, anybody can. It came out fabulous! I followed other reviewers' advice and only cooked it 40 minutes unstead of 45, checking on it at 35 minutes. I also did not make the caramel sauce but used powdered sugar. I think whipped cream mixed with Chambord or Bailey's as a frosting would also be very nice.

I served this recently at a dinner party and it was a huge hit. One of the guests actually hummed as he ate it. It was incredibly easy to make, which was nice because the other items on the menu were a little more time intensive. I followed the recipe except for one small, yummy change. Instead of 1 cup of whipping cream I did 1/2 cup whipping cream and 1/2 cup of Baileys.

I made this for a fancy birthday cake to share with friends and it was a huge hit! Not only was it a delicious, melt-in-your-mouth dessert, it was really easy to make! I followed the suggestions and baked the cake for only 35 minutes -- ideal baking time!

I made this for a dinner party that didn't end up happening, so my husband and I got stuck eating it all ourselves (yeah, boo-hoo!) It is so fabulous and easy. It tastes just like the chocolate torte at our favorite restaurant. I baked it for about 40 minutes, as suggested by other reviews. I might even go a few shorter next time. Oh, pity, I guess I'll just HAVE to make one next week for the dinner party that was postponed from this week. Better go the gym five times this week!

Deep, dense, dark and sinfully decadent! I rarely rate a recipe with 4 forks, but this one certainly deserves it. I used top quality Belgian chocolate which added to the richness. Instead of the caramel sauce, I served each slice with whipped cream, a few perfect fresh raspberries and drizzled Chambord over - a luscious raspberry liquer. Quick and easy to make with outstanding results. If you are looking for an impressive chocolate-lover's dessert, you have definitely found it. Bravo, Epicurious!

To call this cake "outstanding" isn't good enough but I can't think of a better word. Extremely simple to make, beautiful to serve and simply devine to eat! Works especially well for Passover when you want to avoid using flour. But, I've served it on many other occasions and shared the recipe as well.

I highly recommend this recipe -I made this in individual springform pans for a birthday buffet. I added two Tbsp. of instant espresso and cut them into 6ths. Topped with a touch of chocolate glaze and a chocolate covered espresso bean - HUGE HIT!

This cake is yum-yum-yummy. My husband can't have wheat products and normally any cake without flour tastes yuk. He loved it and even I gobbled it down. Very rich so you only need small slices. I didn't use this caramel sauce but my own recipe for caramel sauce so I can't comment on the sauce, but the cake was great.

This simple recipe produces fabulous results. I assure you will not be disappointed. I also chose to forego the carmel sauce as this cake is sinfully rich. A simple dusting on powdered sugar does beautifully. I will surely make this again.

I loved this recipe it was easy and tasted like it was made in a resturant...Only complant is i didn't care for the caramel sauce as much. My guest liked it but i thought it was to much. Would have wanted a bery sauce on it instead.

There is something to be said for following instructions. I tried this recipe in 3 different pans. Sheetpan, loaf and springform. Springform (as called for...) worked best. And what a success!!! Sheetpan worked for short, dense sheets, great for individual layer cakes. The loaf worked ok. Not much for presentation. I favor my raspberry puree (any acidic fruit, really) to the caramel, as it is dense enough. I also used 2Tbls. vanilla to round it out.

I made this for my sister-in law who cannot eat flour products- but everyone was in heaven. It was super moist but not goopy. The carmel sauce was great- I used leftovers for ice cream sundaes. I have passed this recipe along to family and friends. Its a keeper.

Much simpler than other flourless chocolate cakes, but just as delicious. I don't make the caramel sauce, but serve it with fresh whipped cream and berries instead. I also bake it in a waterbath, and right before taking the wax paper off I reheat the cake over a light flame on the stove for about 10 seconds so the paper comes off smoothly. The cake comes out perfectly and people always love it.

With all this butter and all those eggs, it's Choco-lesterol City! But is it worth those cottage cheese thighs? You bet your bottom dollar!

Tried many recipes here, but this is my first review and one worth taking the time to share the results. Very definitely one of the best desserts I've ever made. Basic ingredients produce a decadent product! Simple to make and with ingredients most folks have on hand without going to the store. Though not necessary, it's worth the extra few dollars to obtain high quality chocolate. Unless you're a caramel glutton like me, the recipe can be cut in half and still have plenty to go round; or keep it for other applications! Enjoy!

This is an amazing recipe. I have made this several times and each time it is wonderful and VERY easy to put together. It does get pretty rich with the caramel sauce, so I'd forget that and just serve it with some vanilla ice cream and/or fresh berries. I would suggest reducing the cooking time a bit - the first time I made this, I cooked it as per the recipe and the bottom was burned to the point of no return. I'd say if you shortened the cooking time by 5 to 7 minutes, you'd be fine. Excellent, excellent, excellent!!!

Wow. I made this cake for a friend's birthday party, and everyone loved it, even people who claimed they "didn't like cake." It was wonderfully rich, but not cloyingly sweet.

This was the absolute favorite of 3 desserts I made for a Mother's Day (paella)Lunch! Baked it (and made the caramel sauce) days earlier, well wrapped and froze it (refrigerated the sauce), then transported to our weekend home in the Santa Ynez Valley. I warmed it before serving and served with the warm caramel sauce and Hagen Daz vanilla ice cream. Huge hit!!! Extremely easy and would definitely make again and again. And, as an added note, the night before went to the Los Olivos Cafe and ordered a piece just so I could compare....I think mine might have even been better!!!!

The cake was very good and easy to prepare. The caramel sauce was a bit runny and did not have a very distinct flavour. Next time, I would probably serve the cake with a tarter sauce, like a raspberry sauce, to balance out the sweetness of the cake.

I made this for a small dinner party and it was a hit. I whisked in the eggs one by one and added some air to the batter that way. I also added a small amount of salt to accentuate the deep chocolate flavor. It does resemble a manhole cover once it cools so topping it with something will make it more presentable. I brought the leftovers in to work and people raved about the intense chocolate flavor. Nice and easy.

Made this dessert last night for a dinner gathering- what a HIT! Used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet, which worked out well as it did not taste too sweet.

Add ice-cream and fresh whipped cream for additional decadence!

Oh my goodness! This cake (fudge in disguise?) is super simple, quick and a great chocolate fix. I loved that I had everything in the house to make it and no special ingredients.

This recipe was great!! Very easy and it turned out tasting less like a brownie than many other flourless cakes I have made (Yeah!!). The sauce was wonderful and I only put fresh raspberries and a tiny bit of whipped cream on the top so presentation was also nice. I am making it again this weekend as my kids and husband also loved it!!
