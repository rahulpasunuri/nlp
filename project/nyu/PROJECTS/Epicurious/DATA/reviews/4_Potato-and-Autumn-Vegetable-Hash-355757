I love this recipe. I have made it several times with and without the potatoes and beet greens. We had this at Thanksgiving and there was no leftovers! Although it does take a while to do all of the chopping, I did the beets and the herb oil the day before.

The fall flavors are excellent. You can use even more of the herbs. This dish takes several hours to prepare, principally because of the chopping of the vegetables.
