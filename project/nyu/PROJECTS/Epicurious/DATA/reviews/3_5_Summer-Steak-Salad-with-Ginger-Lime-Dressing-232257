i was very impressed with this recipe! I used sirloin for the steak, just one piece cut up into 2- inch chunks was enough for two servings. I also had to substitute romaine for the greens, as our supermarket isn't very adventurous, and doesn't carry watercress, let alone the more exotic greens. I liked the addition of the pineapple; i've nevr had this combination and wasn't sure about it, but it really was nice with the steak. I will be adding this to my summer recipe box!

The marinated meat tastes nice; however, that is the only nice thing about this recipe. Way too much work for something that is barely edible.

A lovely salad. The combination of flavors is fantastic, and the pineapple gives this salad an incredible twist. I omitted the mizuna leaves (couldn't find them), used only one bunch of watercress and substituted coffee for sherry. It all turned out wonderfully. The next time around, however, I would let the pan get hotter and cook the steak for less time before adding the pineapple.

good flavors, I liked the dressing as well as the marinade. I only used 1 Tbs fish sauce in the dressing.... and added green onions to the marinade. I used skirt steak and cooked it on the grill. Sauteed the onions and shallot in a pan, then heated the marinade thru and stirred in the pineapple, tossed all with the salad and piled the thinly sliced steak on top. Pretty.

Mizuna: Japanese greens = spider mustard Notes: Mizuna has tender leaves and a pleasant, peppery flavor. Substitutes: young mustard greens (more pungent) OR arugula

I used chicken instead of steak (husband doesn't eat red meat) so I won't review the meat part of this, but the salad dressing was pretty fishy from the fish sauce. While it tasted OK, the smell was pretty overpowering. I'd use a different dressing if I made it again.

We loved this salad, especially the dressing. Don't leave out the basil in the salad--it really adds a lot. The only change I made was to use sliced tomato instead of the pineapple b/c of availability. Tomatoes worked really well as a substitution.

Great salad! Dressing is very good, but if you are sodium-conscious or just don't like it too salty, go easy on the fish sauce. I used one tbl spoon and thought it really didn't need more than that.

Wow! I was searching for something to make with my end-of-season Thai Basil (other than stir fry). This was simply amazing. I used some nice herb mix salad I had (that already had mizuna & watercress in it) with some baby spinach. I don't care for cucumbers, but I added some fresh tomatoes from our garden. The marinade on the NY strip was fantastic...might do that again with just the steak. I think the key here is to get a large skillet very, very hot. I used peanut oil which has a high burning point. The steak seared beautifully. I used a tip from another poster and only cooked the steak for about 1 minute or so per side. This will be a weeknight staple, and perhaps a company special dinner, especially if adding a bit of bean thread noodle to the salad for some carb. I would make the dressing and marinate the steak ahead to make it super easy and quick.

I loved this dish. Great flavors and not too difficult to make. Now I can stay home instead of going out for "vietnamese" food. My husband loved it along with my 10 year old cousin.

A perfect salad for a warm summer night. The combination of flavors distinguishes it from most main course salads. My entire family loved it and I made it EXACTLY as instructed. Delicious!

Don't know if I did something wrong but this was very bad. My husband, who will eat anything, literally stopped eating dinner. This is the first time he has ever done that. My greens also wilted after putting the meat on the salad. The flavors of the meat and the dressing were very good, just not together.

Really enjoyed this summer salad...used pork tenderloin instead of beef and cooked the pork on the grill.

Pretty good. I did make some changes though: I added a splash or two of Worcestershire sauce and a tsp. of chinese chili sauce to the marinade (you know, the red chunky stuff that's on the table at chinese restaurants), I added chopped cilantro and sliced green onions to the salad, omitted the mizuna, swapped the bibb lettuce for romaine, and finally sprinkled the whole thing with roasted peanuts before serving. The dressing I made as is, but I found it a little too tart for me.

This was a great light dish and a welcome change to a steak recipe. I used an herb greens mix and added basil and watercress which are key to the flavors on this. Changes I would make are as follows: We like a little kick so I will add more jalapeno next time. Also, if you prefer your meat med-rare then make the pan super hot and cook for only 2 minutes before adding the pineapple.

A great Summer Dish. I used beef tenderloin and added a small dash of crushed red pepper to the beef to add a little bite to this dish. Other than that followed the recipe for a wonderful Summer Lunch. Enjoy

I marinate my steak over night & grill my steak and rings of pineapple the next day. I like it this way better than throwing them on a pan. I used whatever greens I have on hand (like the salad in a bag I can just pick up in grocery store)plus the basil. Great taste, easy to make.

I opted for marinated flank steak on the grill. I could not find the asian green so I used watercress and spinach. I shared the meal with two friends and there was quite a bit of silence. The marinade and dressing made complex layers of flavor. I served soba noodles with it. It was a huge hit.

We liked this recipe. It was simple and very tasty but I would add more of the jalepeno pepper for more flavour and a bit more heat and perhaps a bit more lime juice for an increased Asian flavour - next time. Our guests rated it a 4 fork dinner.

I have made this recipe twice and adore it. I cheated the 2nd time because of time and threw a Teriyaki pork roast on the grill and thinly sliced before serving. I also added snow peas fresh from the garden for an oriental touch. Awesome! Any green leaf lettuce will do. The dressing is unbelievably good and so impressive for guests! Enjoy!

I have to say, my guests loved this. I'd give it 2 1/2 forks if I could. Because I keep kosher, I had to modify the recipe, and that may be why I didn't think it was delicious. The meat was very bland, and I think that if it had marinated longer and then been broiled, the dish would have been better. I couldn't use the oyster or fish sauce (subst. 1/2 soy 1/2 vinegar for fish sauce), so that did change the flavor. I like the idea, wasn't crazy about the implementation.

This dish was great and really easy to make. And for one who doesn't like to measure, the recipe is very forgiving. It will definitely top our list of delicious warm weather dishes!

This is a really good salad, both hot (the first time) and cold (for the leftovers). My lab-mates commented that it smelled really good. To make it fit the budget, I used round steak, and let it marinate overnight to tenderize.

I liked it and would make it again but didn't think it was anything to write home about. I would marinate the meat longer. I prepared the marinade and dressings and did all the slicing and dicing the day before so it was easy to throw together. I should have let my pan heat up more because there was so much moisture in the onions and meat that it was hard to get a good sear on the meat.

Despite all the chopping, this went together fairly quickly. I put brown rice on the stove and composed the salad while it cooked. It was all ready in just under an hour. Everyone, even the kids, enjoyed this salad.

A great change of pace salad! A wonderful mix of flavors and textures. Definitely a big hit with my family!

The meat with the pineapple was very flavorful. I didn't care for the watercress in the salad. Putting the warm meat on the salad wilted the greens, unless that was the idea. It was too much work. My kids didn't like it either.

Delicious summer salad. I added olive oil to the dressing, and used only about 2T fish sauce--personal preference. The marinade for the steak was delicious.

Made this salad for a potluck dinner party a friend was having, and it was a huge hit. I was most surprised by the amount of fish-sauce in the dressing, but it was perfectly balanced by the sugar. One tip: make sure your pan is smoking hot before the beef goes in--more carmelization=more flavor! A definite must. Also, I find cast-iron is better (and safer) for high-temperature searing than the suggested non-stick pan.

The flavors were delicious. My only complaint was the confusion of the recipe. The sauce with the oyster sauce was included with the steak and salad ingredients.The salad dressing with the fish sauce was by itself giving the impression that it was for the salad alone and not the meat. I may have put things together in the wrong order but it tasted great anyway. P.S. No explanations as to the * by the fish sauce and Oyster sauce,
