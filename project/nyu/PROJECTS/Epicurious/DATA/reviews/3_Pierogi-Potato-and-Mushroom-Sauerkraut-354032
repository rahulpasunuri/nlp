Didn't love this recipe, but I think it was because I used white whole wheat flour for the dough. I recommend boiling the pierogies and then frying them in some oil in a skillet--just boiling alone produces something that is like a dumpling. Here's a link to the rest of the recipe (on Google books): http://books.google.com/books?id=9lW15qtZhqEC&lpg=PA55&ots=xqMgZZp6mK&dq=%22vegan%20brunch%22%20pierogis&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q&f=false

The recipe is great but the commentary is unnecessary, wordy and makes an otherwise basic recipe bloated with dense posturing. I had to copy the recipe and edit out all the junk just to get to the necessities of how to make the things.

Browning left-over boiled pierogies in a fry pan with butter and onions the next day is another delicious way of serving them. As a matter of fact, I think my family likes them fried better than boiled! I use a different dough recipe, though this one was pretty decent.

What to do with the pierogos once formed? This is from another recipe here on epicurious that came from a recipe published in Gourmet: "Bring a 6- to 8-quart pot of salted water to a boil. Add half of pierogies, stirring once or twice to keep them from sticking together, and cook 5 minutes from time pierogies float to surface. Transfer as cooked with a slotted spoon to onion topping and toss gently to coat. Cook remaining pierogies in same manner, transferring to onions. Reheat pierogies in onion topping over low heat, gently tossing to coat."

Anyone know what you do after you roll out and cut the dough circles? The recipe leaves us hanging...

Seems like the next logical step would be to put the filling into matching dough rings, seal, and boil for some period of time. Guess we'll never know...
