Made this for Christmas Eve and it was fabulous, I think I made this in 2005 when it came out in BA. I made the porcini sauce the day before as we'll as the horseradish sauce (used baby bella for the fresh mushrooms). Everyone loved this, it cooked beautifully. Served with haricots verts and mashed potatoes as well as popovers, but plain popovers as my husband is a purist...will make again for sure.

My family was too large to get purchase a 9lb rib roast so I had to substitute it for a 12 lb (boneless) ribeye roast. I made some modifications as well. I added rosemary in addition to the thyme and more olive oil than what the recipe suggested. I cooked it at the recommended temperature for 1 hour and 38 minutes and the roast ended up overcooking past the point that I wanted it, which was disappointing. Next time I am going to set my timer to 1 hour and check the temperature of the roast more frequently. The presentation of this roast was impressive. I garnished it with left over Rosemary and Thyme and it became the center of our spread. I only had time to make the sour cream horseradish sauce but next time will plan ahead and make the porcini gravy instead, which would probably go better with the roast. I definitely plan on making this again, despite overcooking it, it made quite an impression on my guests!

This is an amazing recipe - particularly with the sauces and popovers. I did it with Gyurere popovers.

Made my very first rib roast for 20 people using this recipe and EVERYONE complimented it over and over. They couldn't believe Id never done one before (however Id say that has most to do with the cut of the meat rather than my skills). I couldn't get a single roast large enough for what I needed, so I made two smaller (a 6 lb. and a 7 lb.) roasts at the same time which had me pretty concerned with trying to calculate the time. I used a meat thermometer and would STRONGLY suggest everyone do so. Mine ended up coming out of the oven after about 1 hour 35 minutes (with the 6 lb'er coming out about 5 minutes before the other). The rub was wonderful-- tasty yet still let the flavor of the meat show through. The porcini sauce was very good, but keep in mind it was fairly time consuming (which a quick glance at the recipe should reveal) so if youre looking for a recipe that would allow you to, say, clean the house while the roast cooks, you either will have to do the bulk of the sauce prep ahead of time. I ended up with just enough time after finishing the sauce to shower and get myself ready before it was time to take the roast out-- probably about an hour. While the sauce was good, I wouldn't say it was necessary and if you're looking to make your day a little easier, Id skip it or just whip up an easier jus with another recipe. One thing this sauce was WONDERFUL for-- reheating shreds of the leftover meat in a bowl with the sauce not only kept it all very juicy, but gave it a different flavor from the first time around. (I made a sinful grilled cheese with the meat, sauce with a few of the mushrooms and mozzarella cheese. I ate those two days in a row!) I didn't make the popovers or the horseradish sauce as 1. it would have taken all day and 2. this was a plenty.

It's pretty hard to prepare a bad Rib Roast. I have cooked many over the years, as it is my personal holiday favorite. This rub was exceptional, and really added flavoring to the meat. Rave reviews from all 12 guests.

This was a wonderful dish. I would reduce the amount of salt in the rub. Horseradish sauce is great but the quantity is overwhelming. Family loved it.

Just made this for Christmas dinner and it received rave reviews from everyone. The porcini wine sauce was a wonderful accompaniment but best of all was the parmesan popovers. I had never made yorkshire pudding or even tasted it before so I was a bit nervous about these. But I'm a daring cook and decided to attempt them after reading all the favorable reviews. Indeed, they were easy to make (just a last minute thing that made it more diffiult to put the entire meal together properly and on time). But they added a very special touch to a holiday dinner. I will definitely made this entire dish again. I did not use 6 cloves of garlic, however. I marinated the meat with one minced clove, fresh time, oil and lots of sea salt (much more than recommended) 24 hrs in the frig. The salt gives the meat a good crust.

My would-be sister-in-law (if gay marriage were permitted) made this for our winter holiday family gathering last night. It was the most exquisite prime rib I have ever tasted. The sauce was incomparable. I'm sure she'll make it again. I'm adding it to my repretoir tomorrow!

WOW! Fantastic. Super tasty, and my guests were impressed. Make the sauce ahead of time and refrigerate it - makes it easier to skim off the fat and frees up your time on the big day. I cooked it to just 130º, and it was perfectly done. Will definitely make it again.

I've made this roast with the Bacon Porcini sauce and the Horseradish Sauce for the last few years. It's my go to Xmas dinner. I opt for the more traditional large Yorkshire Pudding made in the pan with drippings instead of the popovers. It's sinful, but I only eat it once a year so what the heck!

This has become our traditional Christmas Eve Dinner since it was first published in 2005. When making the porcini and bacon sauce don't be afraid to substitute other dried mushrooms if porcini is not available, as I have had to do this and every year it comes out just fine no matter what dried mushroom I have used. Our Dinner menu has evolved to this: mixed greens with a vinagrette and shallot dressing, The Standing rib roast with both the porcini bacon sauce and the horseradish cream sauce, yorkshire pudding with rosemary and bacon, and green beans with carmalized shallots. All of the dishes share the same flavors (bacon, rosemary, shallots) which make the dishes all fit well together. Every year I try different desserts, this year the meal was finished off with golden moist carrot cake topped with a cream cheese icing lightly flavored with disaronno. Very homey and perfect for immediate family.

A delicious Christmas Day meal rounded out by scalloped potatoes with goat cheese and herbs de provence, carrots with balsamic glaze, haricots vert with lemon zest and orange-cranberry sauce. Started with arugula with goat cheese, blood oranges and pomagranate seeds. Ended with a chocolate Christmas trifle. Followed the recipe exactly, as this was my first rib roast; substituted low-salt or no- salt. Bought the best meat from Whole Foods. Used a good Cabernet for the porcini sauce. Worked perfectly and met with rave reviews! Took me an extra 30-45 mins to get to 130 degrees, but worth the wait. Horseradish sauce was good, but really unnecessary. Next year, 12 lbs!

Outstanding! I made this for a Christmas Eve dinner and everyone raved. I did not deviate from the recipe but prepped the roast and sauce the day before. It was all perfect - right down to the roasting time. The roast was a perfect medium rare and exceptionally tender. The porcini sauce is simply delicious. I will definitely be making this again.

WOW, WOW, WOW, this was amazing!! Made for Thanksgving crowd to rave reviews!! First time making a rib roast, and this didn't dissapoint! What leftovers there were...everyone was fighting for them! I like the other reviewers did not add the butter at the end, seemed like over kill to me! I was also concerned about what other reviewers said about it being too salty, so I used both low sodium bacon and broth...came out PERFECT!!! A good bottle of cabernet, in my opinion made a huge difference! Family members are already requesting again for next year!

Fanastic recipe. The porcini bacon sauce is one of the best for beef. My guests raved about it. I used a boneless rib roast and cooked as directed, it came out perfect. I would highly recommend it for any occasion.

I've had this recipe in my box for over a year and finally had an occasion to make it. It did not disappoint! As one of my guests put it, "without a doubt, the best roast beef I've ever had". I bought a 9.25 lb roast and cooked it exactly as directed...the result was tender, perfectly medium-rare beef. The bacon porcini sauce was great, but as others have said, a little too salty even using 1/3 less sodium stock (and I too didn't add the butter at the end). I'm not sure what could be done to reduce the salt (because there is none added) except maybe cutting down on the bacon. Anyway, the horseradish sauce was also wonderful and both sauces made great warm roast beef sandwiches with the leftovers. I highly recommend buying the best beef you can afford...it melts in your mouth and the rub gives it great flavor. Can't wait for another special occasion to make this meal again.

I just made the roast and both sauces for a dinner party. It was all fantastic. The porcini sauce was amazing - everyone raved. After cooking it most of the day it was the perfect consistency and had a nice complex flavor. I'm now contemplating what I can do with the leftovers...

This is the way to cook a great piece of meat. Make sure you get the butcher to remove the bones in one big hunk and then tie them back on. They add lots of flavor, and you can save them for the next day as a snack. Almost better eating that the roast itself. The mushroom sauce is good, but the beef doesn't need it. I got lots more compliments on the horseradish sauce, which is alot easier to make ahead of time, and keeps for several weeks in the fridge and make a great dip for carrots and celery sticks.

Made this for xmas dinner. Huge hit. Outstanding. We don't drink or cook with wine so we substituted 1/2 cup of red wine vinegar and 4 cups beef stock for the 3 cups wine and 1 cup beef stock. The reduction took most of the day before xmas but was worth the time and effort. Like anything one cooks the choice of ingredients is paramount. Buy the best roast, the best broth etc. and you can't loose.

My first attempt at a standing rib roast and it was fabulous. I removed the roast from the oven at 120 and by the time we carved it it was a perfect medium rare. I couldn't get Porcini mushrooms so I used Chanterelle instead and it was wonderful. The horseradish sause and the Popovers were a big hit also.

A delicious rib roast. I only bought a three rib roast (4.5 lbs) as my dinner party was not huge and so I halved the seasoning rub and cooked the roast for probably a total of 60 minutes, 20 at the higher heat and about 20 minutes at 300 and the last 20 minutes at 225. When making a standing rib roast, I like to start with the high heat, between 450 and 500 for 15-20 minutes to sear the meat, but then I really drop the oven temp to cook the meat very slow. The result is meat that is so tender, it will melt in your mouth. Two things are key to this process, first you need to take the meat out of the fridge 2 hours early as directed here to bring it to room temp and second you need to use a digital thermometer that has the probe that you stick in the meat and the readout that sits on your counter. That way you can monitor the progress. I've taken 6 hours to cook a full rib roast at basically 200 degrees. The house smells awesome all day and the meat is like butter!

Absolutely great! I put the rub on the roast the night before - it was perfect. The sauce was thin - but didn't matter as it was so flavorful. It did take a long time to reduce, but was worth the effort. I made both the sauce and the horseradish cream sauce to go with the roast; most of my guests had both. I served potatoes with it, so the thin sauce was fine with both meat and potato casserole. Highly recommend. I plan to make both again.

We had this for Christmas dinner, done on a Weber BBQ. The meat was wonderful, but I had a hard time getting the sauce to reduce. I finally added back all the mushrooms (I used more than was called for)and it was OK. Tasted fine, but was still runny. I was so absorbed in worrying about the sauce I totally forgot to make the popovers.

We fixed it for our New Years Eve gourmet dinner.The roast was to die for. My wife made it exactly by the recipe. I agree you have to buy the best quality roast that you can find and definitely make the horseradish sauce with it. A real keeper. We kept the same amount of Porcini Sauce but cut the horseradish sauce in half,just enough for 6.

I had never cooked a roast before in my 41 years on this earth. With some emotional support from my family I decided to take the plunge and cook this recipe for Christmas dinner. It was a hit! I took hints from past postings and used low sodium broths for the sauce. I know now to prepare the popover batter before I even get my roast in the oven. Dinner was a little lat but everyone raved about the food and several even had seconds. I was very proud of myself and I am looking for an excuse to prepare this meal again. I served mashed potatoes also with this meal. This also made great leftovers.

Mixed review: The seasoning for the roast couldn't have been better. The Porcini & Bacon sauce was very nice, but not a knock-out. The horseradish sauce is tastey, good for sandwiches, but there is NO REASON to cover the well-rounded and robust flavor of a beautiful and pricey crown roast with this heavy sauce. Most of my guests left it on their plates.

This was our Christmas dinner and my first attempt at a standing rib roast. It was fabulous, as was the porcini sauce and horseradish sauce. Well worth the effort. I think the rub on the roast really made the dish. I didn't mind stemming the thyme, as it was worth it. The porcini sauce was so wonderful if a bit time consuming, and not too salty. I reused the pricey mushrooms and leftover sauce on pasta the next day !!!!

I made two roasts, as we had 32 for Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it - lots and lots of compliments. I used free-range chicken broth and had no problem with salitness in the mushroom sauce. The horseradish sauce was a big hit, also.

Our family has used the Bon Appetit menus for the last several Christmas dinners, and this was yet another hit. We used shitake mushrooms instead of porchini and mixed those into the final sauce instead of button mushrooms. The results were a very deep flavorful sauce. Since members of my family are lactose intolerant, we used a tofu sour cream for the horseradish cream sauce and it tasted great. The great thing about this recipe is that I didn't feel like I was cooking all day. Quick preparation the night before and about 3 hours on Christmas day.

fantastic, easy, and elegant meal. i agree that it was a bit on the salty side and would cut back next time. for the gravy, i simply skimmed the pan drippings, added a little cornstarch and water, and it was great. i'd definitely make this again!

I write this after reading the 11 previous reviews and agree with the comments of excessive saltiness made by a number of the reviewers. I used reduced sodium chicken broth but regular beef broth in the sauce. I cannot find salt free canned broths at local markets. The 1 TB of Kosher salt and the bacon bits added more salt contributing to the high salt content and and almost inedible quality of the sauce. In addition, the total sodium content of the sauce is at variance with current dietary guidelines from medical and nutritional experts -- avoid too much salt. Perhaps BA should start giving nutrient content for their recipes as do other food publications.I would never make that recipe again.

Great recipe, I did use another cooking method suggested by by butcher. Everyone raved about the taste of this roast and it will always be used when cooking this cut of meat.

Excellent and reliable. I have a good source of cheap porcini, so it's less of a budget stretch. The thyme rub is great - I stripped the leaves, but it occurs to me if you crush the salt/garlic/thyme in a mortar and pestle there's no need to strip the leaves - the stems will just come free when you grind up the mix and you can pick them off when you rub down the roast. Also highly recommend wearing thin latex gloves for the operation.

Roast was great. Regarding comments re porcini sauce, maybe too salty because of the juices from the roast? Used no salt chicken broth. Wasn't too salty for us.

This recipe was awesome!! Made it for Christmas dinner and got rave reviews! As for saltyness, I do not agree. I used low-salt beef broth, unsalted butter to finish the sauce and did not season it at the end. It was perfect. The do-ahead factor on the sauce and meat is great!

This was a great roast! The only change I made was in the type of roast I used; instead of standing rib, (not fond of it) I used a rump roast. The thyme garlic paste was wonderful as was the horseradish cream sauce. The porcini bacon sauce was very tasty, but a little too salty, and I am not sure I would make it again. Plus, spending nearly $8 on 2 oz. of dried porcini was a little too dear for me, especially since you end up straining them from the sauce in the end! (I did read the recipe correctly, I hope?!) Made my mom's recipe for plain popovers to go with the roast since it seemed easier. Great meal for a large crowd!

I'm not going to give a fork rating as I didn't make the sauces, but the effect of the garlic/thyme paste really wasn't worth the effort of stripping the thyme leaves - though it did smell great in the oven. My husband agreed the resulting flavor wasn't appreciably different than our usual method of sprinkling the roast with garlic salt and onion powder. I've used the thyme from my garden to make many wonderful things, but this wasn't one of them. (The accompanying popovers were very good though; if you want details see that recipe separately.)

This was my first attempt at a rib roast. I made this for my staff Holiday Dinner and everyone raved. It was so good I'm planning on doing it again for another big dinner party this weekend. I found the recipe very easy, and a simple yet elegant meal for a dinner party. I used a digital meat thermometer and took out the roast at 125 deg like the recipe said. My roast was 9#, and the cooking time was pretty close. I went ahead with the Porcini bacon reduction, which was a little work but well worth it. It was a bit salty, but I didn't really make an effort to go low sodium with the broths. The creamy horseradish sauce was wonderful and very easy to prepare. I let the roast stand for about 45 -60 min after taking it out so I could do the green onion/parmesian popovers. Unfortunately they flopped (always good to have extra dinner rolls laying around), but the roast was still warm and very juicy. Can't wait for the weekend to make again!

The roast was great, although I was foolish to cook it without a meat thermometer. It took longer than the recipe indicated and I had to rely on guesswork. The porcini sauce was absolutely delicious and I loved the horseradish sauce, as well. A wonderful holiday dinner.
