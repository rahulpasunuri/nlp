Used this sauce recipe with the addition of 2T. rice wine vinegar, and 1T. dark sesame oil for my Hawaiian Somen Salad. Top somen with slivered seedless cucumber, tamagoyaki, kamaboko, char siu, and diagonally sliced green onion over a bed of shredded napa cabbage, or iceberg lettuce.

Just an FYI, the thin brown-colored buckwheat noodles are called soba, and the white-colored wheat noodles used in this recipe are indeed called somen. Both can be used in this recipe. If serving hot, udon noodles (thick wheat noodles, also white) can be used, too. They are more filling than either somen or soba.

Growing up with a Japanese mom, I've made/eaten this a lot over the years. Instead of making the soup, my mom would just use Kikkoman's Memmi soup base (commonly available) and add cold water as per instructions on the back. Make the soup a little strong, then add an ice cube to help keep it cold. Also add finely grated ginger to the soup; also thinly sliced cucumber, ham, and pan-fried egg. Keep everything on ice. For spice, use shichimi togarashi, a Japanese red pepper spice mix. This is wonderful in the summer.

I did'nt want to give this an actual fork rating because I did not myself taste it. I made it for the little man to take to work for lunch. He really liked it and I will be making it again. I did use anothers suggestion and serve it with wasabi. I tried it with pork instead of chicken and it worked very well.

Yes, indeed, somen are white wheat noodles and soba are the buckwheat. I prefer the former in this recipe.

The brown buckwheat noodles are SOBA, the white noodles in this recipe are somen.

I haven't made this recipe, although I love having it in restaurants. I just wanted to comment that (in my experiences) somen usually refers to thin buckwheat noodles (which are brown, not white). I think that the buckwheat adds a lot to their taste, and recommend that others try to use them.

I followed the recipe pretty closely, then laid some very thinly (not paper-thin) sliced proscuitto (sp?)over the serving along with a little finely chopped cucumber as a garnish. The salty ham adds a nice contrast.

This was quite good! I could have doubled the recipe for the 4 of us. It was gobbled up! Very light and refreshing. I will add it to my summer menus often!

I love somen (cold noodles)! I think this is a great recipe. If you don't feel like making "TSUYU (SOUP)", you can just buy one at store. As long as you are able to try oriental foods, you'll like this. We normaly eat this on summer season.
