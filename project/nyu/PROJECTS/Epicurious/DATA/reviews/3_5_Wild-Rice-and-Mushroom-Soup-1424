A great soup! To the other jokers reviewing this poorly, but changing most of the ingredients or leaving out important ones that add flavor and depth... get real.

Delicious. I used fresh mushrooms (1/2 shitaki, 1/2 baby bellas), rosemary and thyme and the depth was fabulous. I forgot the milk (used skim) initially and was great with or without it.

This was okay, but I thought it needed more flavor. I couldn't find dried mushrooms so I used fresh instead, but I don't think that was the problem It was good, but nothing I'd crave again.

Used only chicken broth and added carrots and celery with shallots (instead of onion). Used both shitakes and oyster mushrooms. I loved the mushrooms. The broth was okay. Too much potato for me. Didn't use any milk but thinned it out with water.

Used fresh rosemary and button mushrooms. No potato or madeira. Also, used 2% milk. The fresh rosemary added a nice earthy taste. Very easy soup for first course or lunch.

I used to make a soup like this some years ago and was pleased to see the recipe to be reminded to make it. Its lovely. Tastes of Autumn.

Great recipe, easy midweek dinner. I use a container of fresh shitake mushrooms instead of dried, and use only chicken broth instead of beef broth. Serve with a green salad and crispy baguette. My kids love this!

This is a great hearty soup, it has a lot of depth and complexity given the few spices used. Suggestions: I chunked up a rotisserie chicken breast and warmed it in with the onion garlic mixture. I too think there was a bit too much onion...shallots would probably be better. Potato flakes worked well, I didnt blend anything. I will def. use fresh shrooms next time-- crimini or shitake.

Like Denise from Calgary, I apologize for not reviewing the recipe. People warning against storing rice at room temperature are not being germ fanatics. The "unpleasant" food poisoning Denise speaks of is nicknamed "Fried Rice Syndrome" because you usually pick it up from eating at Chinese restaurants where the leftover rice is not refrigerated and then subsequently made into stir fry. The symptoms include diarrhea and PROJECTILE VOMITING for up to 10 hours. Not worth it. If you want to dehydrate your rice a little bit, just be sure not to overcook it and stash it in the fridge overnight.

I thought that this recipe was excellent. I was going to have a little bowl just to taste it, and I ended up pigging out. Next time I'm going to at least double the recipe so that I have some left over to freeze. I work 12 hour night shifts, so it's great to be able to pull dinner out of the freezer to take to work. I used half an ounce of dried mushrooms, and added some fresh ones. I would highly reccomend doing the same, because as one other reviewer noted, the dried mushrooms tend to be very chewy. They do, however, add a nice depth of flavor to the broth (and they make their own mushroom broth.) As for the suggestion that you cook the rice and put it in the cupboard, I agree with the other person who said that that is a very bad idea. It would be bad enough if the rice were cooked in water, but it's cooked in chicken stock. I would imagine that you can accomplish the same thing in the fridge. I highly recomend making this soup!

I made this per the recipe, other than doing as another cook did and adding fresh mushrooms w/ the dried. I, too, think the dried can be too rubbery. But I really didn't like the soup much; too much onion made it "oniony" for us and I would at least halve the onion.

Rating: 4
i've made this twice-- the second time i used fresh shiitakes because it seems no amount of soaking can get rid of the rubbery feel of the dried ones! it's so much better with the fresh ones. and i have used a brown/wild rice blend which is fantastic. i am about to make it again today. i always use extra mushrooms because they are so good. it's a very easy recipe to make.

This was a delicious soup. I used vegetarian chicken and beef bouillon cubes instead of the broth and did everything else as written. It was an excellent soup and I believe i will be serving it as a first course for Thanksgiving.

MAKE THIS! This was easy and super tasty! I used mushroom stock, fresh herbs, added a handful of button mushrooms, eliminated the potato and madeira, didn't bother to puree (no potatoes to puree), and sprinkled with shaved parmesan. Next time I might add a little more rice. And I'll double the recipe.

This turned out to be a delicious soup. I tried it because I love both wild rice and mushrooms. I doubled the recipe because I was going to try this out on a group of around 8! I used fresh shiitake mushrooms, reduced the amount of potatoes slightly and used veggie broth only. I didn't have thyme nor Madeira, but the soup still turned out pretty good. I guess this is not a fair rating since I tweaked the recipe significantly. When I tasted it, I thought that there wasn't enough mushroom flavor. So I sauteed the remaining mushrooms that I had and used a little as a garnish with each soup bowl. All in all, a good, filling soup. Thank you for the recipe.

Very good soup. I used mushroom broth and about 5oz of fresh shiitake as I couldn't find dried. Flavorful, healthy and freezes well.

My family really enjoys this recipe, although I make an easier, vegetarian version. Use Marigold vegetable stock instead of chicken and beef stock. Also, fresh shitake (5 ounces or 150 grams) makes a good substitute for dried. Skip the milk and madeira and pureeing. Excellent a bit chunky.

Delicious -- rave reviews all around! I used crimini mushrooms and blended half of the mushrooms into the soup. I also used red potatoes (just hate the mealiness of russets) and lightly home fried them in teflon with a tiny bit of butter before adding to the broth. The extra browning flavor was remarkable and they were not gooey when pureed as so many warn red potatoes will be. That beef broth adds real depth, but next time I will use a wonderful organic mushroom broth I've discovered for both the base and the rice so my veggie friends can rave too. They were robbed!

I want to apologize ahead of time for not rating or reviewing this recipe (although it sounds wonderful). I just had to respond to the tip sent in by the gentleman from Sonoma County about storing your cooked rice overnight in a paper bag in the cupboard. I had to let everyone know that while this tip might work, there is a very real danger of food poisoning from the bacteria "Bacillus Cereus" which is VERY commonly found on rice. Once the rice has been cooked, if the temperature falls below 140F, the bacteria will start to multiply. Although this is NOT a fatal form of food poisoning, it is unpleasant to say the least, so make sure if you follow this technique, you reheat the the rice very quickly to a temperature of at least 165F before you eat it.

Tasty & very easy to make. I substituted half-and-half, a combo of dried porcinis and fresh mushrooms, and chicken broth instead of beef broth. I found it needed a lot of salt and pepper for more flavor.

very good. i've also made it with portobello mushrooms.

Great soup for wild rice lovers! I added cream instead of milk to make it richer. Also sauteed button mushrooms for soup instead of shitake mushrooms. Tasted excellent. Will definitely make again.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I will be adding this one to my "make monthly" list. I, like others, used regular button mushrooms and sauteed them. I also added half-and-half instead of the milke for a richer flavor. Also replaced the rosemary with tarragon...heavenly! My co-workers RAVED over this one. Would give this 5 forks if I could!

Easy to make and very good -- only recommendation is to not use too much potato because it gets too thick.

Delicious! I had leftover pheasant which had been pretty tough at it's first appearance on our table. So, I braised it in the chicken broth till tender, then cooked the wild rice in that same broth. I deboned the pheasant and added it at the end. Also,instead of milk, I used cream...rich and wonderful. I will definately make this again; my husband said to add it to his favorite "comfort" foods.

I didn't have shiitakes, but sauted criminis and put extra into finished soup. I loved it! A wonderful Fall soup.

I agree this baby needs a pinch more cracked black pepper corns and maybe a splash of cab. I tired a trick I learned with my house fried rice recipe and it improved this one too! Here's the tip: use stale wild rice! Make it the day before, seal it in a paper bag in you cupboard and prepair the soup the next day. It will be soft, chewy and have an al dente bite that is the bella of this beef bbq. Like the big resturants get. Enjoy! Stefano

This is a fantastic and very satisfying soup. The texture and flavor matched very well. Great as a first course or as a meal. Definitely a keeper in my recipe file.

My husband made this soup and it was terrific. Not only did it taste wonderful but the whole house smelled great! He added the mushrooms before pureeing it because he's not a mushroom fan. Also, he just stuck a hand blender in it rather than dealing with pouring it into the blender. We're thinking of garnishing it with toasted walnuts or cranberry puree next time.

We made this for a dinner party of fourteen and it was very well recieved. The recipe can be easily multiplied and can be reheated. I suggest adding more pepper.

Lovely on a cold winter evening. Would also be wonderful with other types of dried mushrooms, such as cepes or morels.
