I thought this recipe was absolutely delicious! I was worried the radicchio might be too bitter, or that the fennel too strong, but wow, this came together so nice! I highly recommend it.

This is one of my favourite pizza recipes. I have made it many times; always with ease and success, and to rave reviews from those to whom I've served it. Finally thought it was about time to do my bit to improve the overall rating in the hope that more people would try it and enjoy it. (Of course you do have to be a fan of the various ingredients)

This was a good idea turned bad. I am usually very trusting of Gourmet and Bon Appetit recipes but neither my husband nor I liked this pizza. I think that the same combination as a salad with fontina bruschetas would have been a better use for these expensive ingredients.

I thought this was a great pizza. My husband and I both agreed all the ingrediets blended well together. We thought however, the fennel could be eliminated. I also thought there could be less radicchio because the cheeses did not melt as well as they could have if there was a bit less of a mound on top and the crust was beginning to get hard. This pizza accompanied with a field green salad topped with a few of the extra roasted red peppers and goat cheese ended up to be a wonderful meal.
