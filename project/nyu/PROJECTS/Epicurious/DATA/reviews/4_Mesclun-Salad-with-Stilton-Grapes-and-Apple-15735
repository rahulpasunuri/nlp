I always like to try different salads. This one pops into the rotation sometimes. I love the tarragon in the dressing. Sometimes I substitute Maytag Blue Cheese for the Stilton. This is a very delicious and refreshing salad with the addition of the fruit.

This is a great salad. I make just as written except I use Maytag Blue Cheese (just like it better) instead of Stilton. We have made this a number of times and it has become a staple.

Have always hated blue cheese but not since trying this salad. It's amazing!

This is a good, tasty and nutritious salad. The sweetness & crispness of the apples and the crunch of the almonds go great with the slight bitterness of the greens.

This is a great salad to serve to picky eaters. Removing ingredients is easy and doesn't destroy the salad. But, it is definitely most delicious with everything included.
