The tomatillo sauce was amazing. I'll make it again and serve over enchiladas, steaks and other dishes. You have to cook it for quite a while to achieve a deep flavor. The whole dish, however, was disappointing given all the good reviews. I followed the directions to the letter, but the sweet potatoes were too firm and the whole thing tasted incongruous. My dinner guests picked at it and said things like, "Mmm, interesting ..."

FANTASTIC! If you love to cook as I do, then a little extra work isn't work at all....if you want fast food, go to Taco Bell...if you want an absolutely fabulous tasting, very authentic Mexican dish, then try this recipe...great cooking is never quick...it takes time to create masterpieces such as this...a little too much for the kids...the adults absolutely loved it! This will definately be on our New Year's buffet this year !! and a little note on the 'healthy' aspect of this recipe...a dish loaded with this much flavor and a little more fat than what you are used to won't kill you once in a while...and if it did, then I wouldn't mind dying with this dish on my fork...have a great day Ü

I found it fascinating that the cook from Cambridge substituted practically every ingredient while complaining that the recipe wasn't worth the work for the end result. It is a bit labor intensive... my suggestion would be that if you don't have time for all the steps, make something else.

This was a delicious vegetarian dish. Next time I will make a double batch because the crowd ate every bite and whined the next day that there were no leftovers to take for lunch. I was skeptical about the pickled onions but they complimented the dish quite nicely. I made a few substitutions without problems: lowfat sour cream, nonfat milk and store bought salsa (since tomatoes were out of season).

This was delicious -- and almost worth the 2+ hrs it took me to prepare it -- incl 15 min rinsing capsaicin out of my eyes. Next time, I'll be more careful with those peppers. I put a bit of the leftover milk-sour cream mixture in a sm dish for an additional garnish.

I followed the recipe except I broke up the tortillas before frying for a more traditional look. The chipotle salsa was really good after it sat awhile. I roasted the chiles and did some of the other prep (grating the cheese & washing the cilantro) the night before so it wasn't so much work in the morning. I served it with one fried egg on top of each portion with the salsa and a sprig of cilantro. In spite of the picture it really was beautiful.

This was pretty good, but not great considering the work involved. Tomatillos are hard to get around here, especially this time of year, so I used tomatillo salsa instead of making the tomatillo sauce. Since the salsa lacked cilantro, I added about 1/2 c chopped cilantro to the sour cream mixture, which I made with low fat sour cream and nonfat milk. (It didn't find it to be runny at all.) I didn't make the salsa roja. I can't even imagine how much time this would take if I made the salsa and tomatillo sauce. I didn't fry the tortillas -- I broiled them on a cookie sheet, a few minutes each side -- a trick I often use for making tostadas, too. Visually, this dish worked because of the lovely orange sweet potatoes. This dish was pretty tasty, but it was too heavy and lacked texture and flavor contrasts. Believe it or not, the marinated onions were the main source of such contrasts! This dish wasn't exactly healthy, either. For these reasons, I won't make this dish again. If I did, I'd seriously cut down on the sour cream, omit the monty jack (although I love monty jack, you couldn't taste it in this dish), and add layers of black beans for more substance. Perhaps this recipe is a good starting point.

I made this for a pre-Thanksgiving potluck and it was great! Being vegetarian and from Texas, I am always looking for new southwestern-style dishes to prepare. I didn't use any poblanos and substituted 1% milk for whole milk and it turned out fine. Actually it was quite spicy b/c I left in a few jalapeno seeds in the tomatillo sauce. The texture might not appeal to some -- kind of runny, but maybe it wouldn't be with whole milk. Definitely a keeper!
