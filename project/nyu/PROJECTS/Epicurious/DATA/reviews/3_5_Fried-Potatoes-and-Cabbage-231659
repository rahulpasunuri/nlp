I make this every year with my corned beef instead of boiling potatoes and cabbage. I used to make it per the recipe, but over the years I modified it by adding a little sliced onion, and I usually take the easy route and use a bag of shredded coleslaw mix instead of chopping up my own cabbage. To make it even easier on a weeknight, I have also used those frozen potatoes that you microwave and then mash. Everyone we make it for never goes back to boiled potato and cabbage again.

Really good and simple use of potatoes and cabbage together, with little effort. Steamed the skin-on potatoes until soft. Shredded a small head of cabbage in the food processor, as I would for slaw. Sauteed cabbage in Kerrygold butter (maybe will add a little garlic the next time) then added potatoes, smashing them in with the cabbage. Let it sit and get golden on the bottom, then put some more Kerrygold on top and stuck it under the broiler for a couple of minutes.

I'm adding this to my "holy moly" collection. I actually made it just according to the recipe (rare for me)and, while I can see playing around with it, it's fantastic as it is. I've been trying various Savoy cabbage recipes, hoping to get my 7 yr old son to appreciate it as I do. Even he had seconds -- I had thirds! That given, it makes more than 4 side servings, as my husband ate as well. We still have leftovers and I'm thinking I can mix it with some leftover sausages for a dynamite pierogi filling tomorrow.

I feel a little guilty giving such a simple dish 4 forks, but it really is easy and delicious. Also a great way to sneak veggies into vegetable-resistant people (add smashed up turnip, for instance). I did substitute olive oil for half of the butter and added a quarter of an onion, but bubble and squeak is supposed to be a mash up of the Sunday roast vegetable leftovers so it doesn't matter if there are substitutions in this case. I flipped a quarter of the pan at a time to get crust on both sides, which was not pretty but tasted wonderful.

Really basic and delicious comfort food that made me feel in touch with my Irish roots! I used the recipe shown with a few modifications: I used red potatoes and left the skins on for color and texture; added one medium sliced onion and cooked it along with the cabbage; added about a tablespoon of mustard as I mashed in the potatoes.

This is good winter comfort food! I used 4 medium to large plain white potatoes and left the skins on. Also added a large leek sliced across the grain. Used about 1/3 of a head of cabbage sliced thin. This amount comfortably filled my largest non-stick frying pan and fed 4 people with seconds. Paired with leftover ham, it was perfect.

Significant differences so no rating, but here's what I did: I heated about 2 tbsp of rendered duck fat in a pan, added about 1lb of medium-diced russet potatoes that had not been previously cooked and then added almost a full head of thinly sliced cabbage. I sauteed it until the cabbage was limp, salted it, and ate it. It was delicious. I'll make it again, but not for company--somehow it is too country for that in my opinion.

Perfect as is, but slightly less guilt-inducing with half butter, half olive oil.

Very easy and quick to make. I used white potatoes (not russet) and it turned out beautifully. I did brown the other side but it really isn't necessary.

This is a very simple, yet surprisingly delicious recipe, and a great way to get another vegetable in our diet. It's a great way to use leftover potatoes - you could just as easily use baked potatoes as boiled. We belong to a CSA, and are getting lots of cabbage right now, and one can only eat so much slaw.

Surprisingly tasty for such a simple dish. I drizzled a bit of olive oil on one side before flipping it, and I wasn't quite successful in keeping it together (but then again I can't really make omelets either). I also used Yukon gold potatoes since that's what I had on hand. It's good with a dallop of source cream in the middle.

When my mom made cabbage, potatoes & ham around St. Patrick's Day, I would never eat it. When she fried the leftovers the next day (just like this recipe suggests), I couldn't get enough! Delicious.

Try using Brussels' sprouts instead of cabbage.
