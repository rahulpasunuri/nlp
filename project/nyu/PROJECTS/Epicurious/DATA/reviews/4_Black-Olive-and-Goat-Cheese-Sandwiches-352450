At Trader Joe's I bought the olive tapenade, roasted bell peppers, thyme, flour tortillas, and Belgian Endive. I used enough cream to thin the goat cheese to the consistency of peanut butter. Also, I made sure to add fresh ground pepper before wrapping the sandwich up. This has become a favorite lunch treat!

This is great. I used Trader Joes tapenade and it was wonderful. i also did not have frisee and used a nice flavorful endive and it worked well.

I made these rollups for a 30-person brunch I threw for my wife's birthday. I ended up cutting them only in half and they were devoured by all ages with great compliments along the way: the mild goat cheese with the intense olive tase makes a compelling combination. I think it would work well with store-bought olive tampenade but I'm glad I learned how to make my own. Just be really careful of pits.. even in the pitted jars from a name brand I found a pit.
