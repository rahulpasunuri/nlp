Excellent! Made with sole - lovely taste!

I really enjoyed the dressing with the fish (I used sole) and the red cabbage. I added plenty of cilantro and some chopped red onion to the slaw. Used sunflower seeds since I didn't have pumpkin. I can't wait to use this dressing with fish tacos!! It's a winner.

Even though I didn't follow this recipe perfectly (due to my own oversights), it was still wonderful. I forgot to garnish with the seeds, so I tried them on the extra slaw. The seeds really add to it! I was a little nervous about the fish, because I have absolutely no experience with fish. I used tilapia, and it was mild and delicious. Great healthy dish.

Awesome. I recommend lightly toasting the pumpkin seeds. I used sole instead of trout.

Absolutely fantastic! I served it with rice that had been lightly browned in oil prior to cooking.

Really delicious fish! I used arctic char instead of trout and substituted all nonfat greek yogurt instead of the mayonnaise to make it healthier. Because my husband hates cilantro, we used flat Italian parsley instead and mistakenly bought roasted sunflower seeds instead of pumpkin seeds. We found the fish to be great, but the slaw was a little too dry and crunchy/fibrous. I'll definitely make the fish again, but I might skip the slaw.

This was so easy and fast! The flavors are huge! This is a new favorite. I made the recipe as written 2 nights ago and then made just the slaw again last night, substituting shredded carrot for the jicama.

let the slaw sit for a while it gets better with time. really good with branzino. made it for a dinner party and even the vegetarian wanted seconds (which there were none of).
