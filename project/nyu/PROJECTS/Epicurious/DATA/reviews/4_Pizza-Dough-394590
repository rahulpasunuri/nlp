The recipe is great. Just add 1 teaspoon sugar. I also add fresh parsley or oregano and it makes a great difference. If it turns too soft just knead it with additional flour. 350 deegrees on a BBQ over a pizza stone for about 20 minutes or until the crispness you desire is attained.

you don't have to wait over night, add a little bit of the water (very warm) to some yeast and sugar, let it sit and then mix into the flour/salt and add the water it will take only 90 minutes to rise

This was the best dough I have ever worked with and tasted better than 90% of the pizzas I have had. I left the dough for at least 24 hours and it was very easy to shape. The cooking time didn't quite work for me, it took longer than the stated time, but the crispness and flavor were extraordinary for a home baked pizza. Since I don't live in NYC, it tasted better than any takeout or restaurant pizza in my area.

Unlike the previous reviewer, we had no difficulty at all with this recipe -- in fact it worked perfectly, the first time, and produced a lovely, bubbly crisp crust. I was concerned, as well, about the timing factor. We let the dough rise about 20 hours (around 70-F) and did not have any issues with the dough being too soft. I did (and always do) weigh my bread ingredients using the metric measurements. Perhaps that accounts for my success.

Sorry, I meant to add that I've had marvelous results with Mr.Lahey's no-knead bread recipe, so I had high hopes for this pizza dough.

I tried this recipe when it came out in the March issue of Bon Appetit, which arrived in my Louisville, KY kitchen close to Feb. 1st. I think it still needs a little tweaking for it to work in a home kitchen - in the winter my house is around 65 degrees, which is quite a bit cooler than the 72 the recipe specifies. (And in the summer, my kitchen is usually more like 78.) The line - "It will take a little longer in a cooler room and a little less time in a much warmer room" could provide a little more specificity - are we talking anywhere from half as long to twice as long? When planning to make pizza with this dough, especially if you are planning a party as the article described, having the dough ready is pretty crucial. I tried this dough and apparently let it sit too long - it was WAY too soft to be handled, and I'm a very successful home-pizza maker with other recipes. Just relaying my experience with this. I want to try it again, but I don't know that I'll get back to it - it was too frustrating.
