These were super yummy and simple to make. I used sourdough bread and toasted them in a toaster oven. I love the make-ahead factor. This is one of those great keep-on-hand spreads since sage lasts long (compared to other herbs) and the citric acid probably would help to preserve it. I would give this 3.5 forks if I could!

I thought this was ok. Cheese was rich, maybe if you made small finger type sandwiches for an hor deurve. Otherwise alot of work for an adequate outcome.

I had this amazing sandwich at Chez Panisse in San Francisco. I was surprised to find the obvious knock-off recipe here without credit! I probably used 2 Tbs. of lemon juice and a scant tsp. of zest in this and it turned out great, especially after the mixture sat for a while. Also consider grinding some of the almonds really fine to make a more pasty consistency. A very filling and flavorful treat that tastes great after a night in the fridge.

I found the almond mixture way too lemony/tart.

I love grilled cheese sandwiches and I love nut butters so this is a total no brainer. I loved it!!! It is a little rich but paired with a light soup or salad is a fabulous lunch or quick work day meal.

The cheese was hard to cut, I would use a softer cheese. But, these did taste very good the next day!

I haven't made these but had the original at Tartine Bakery in SF. I generally love new flavors and rich foods, but this was so oily and heavy that after the first bite, I didn't enjoy it.
