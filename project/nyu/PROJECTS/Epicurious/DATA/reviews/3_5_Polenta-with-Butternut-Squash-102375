Recipe was just okay for us, prepared as written. The butternut squash puree was delicious, but the flavor was lost in the polenta.

I had extra squash left over after making a butternut squash soup so I decided to make this dish. I found it to be just ok. I am glad I tried it but next time I'll just make more soup. My one year old did really like it though which is always a good thing

Made this to go with Osso Buco. Interesting, but would not make again. Microwaved the fresh butternut squash, used fresh sage, a bit less Parmesan. The butternut squash overwhelmed the taste of the polenta - might as well have pureed the butternut squash and served as a side dish.....

This has become a favorite. The left-overs are great with beef stew or chili.

Made for New Years Eve. A lot of work but good and it does make a lot. This recipe can probably serve 10. 3 pounds of squash made a little over three cups so I added the full amount. I made the full menus and it was excellent!

I made this for a luncheon last week and it came out great--everyone ate all up! I was advised that it makes a lot, and indeed, increasing the recipe by a third served 12 people generously. I did use a different proportion of liquid to polenta (4 c broth to 1 c polenta) but I was working with Pastene's Instant Polenta, so I followed their directions. I used all broth, no water, and I added a little extra cheese just to use up what I bought. It definitely improved from sitting overnight. My husband who hates squash in any form really liked it (even as cold leftovers) so I am planning on serving this for Thanksgiving!

I hate it when people totally change up the recipe and then write up a review, but guess what I'm doing. Yesterday I carved up an obscenely large butternut, so luckily I had it lying around, or I don't think I'd have tried this recipe. Lucky, too, I had some polenta-in-a-tube, which was actually really good (with added basil and garlic). Since I already roasted the squash, I had it in big chunks rather than in puree form (makes it more hearty-seeming). I fried big rounds of the polenta in a little oil. Then I made a quick mushroom sauce (thanks to the other reviewers!) out of mushrooms, garlic, grapeseed oil, wine and soymilk. Poured it all over both the squash and polenta and it was yum. Not great, but yum. Oh, I'm vegan, and the meal did not suffer at all for the lack of cheese/butter/cream/whatever. I'll make it again some time, but only if I already have some squash ready beforehand.

I think this dish would benefit from a different cooking method for the squash. Essentially, the squash steams, so the puree ends up very mild and watery. The sage and garlic do work well. I might try to open roast the squash cubed with crushed garlic and sage drizzled with olive oil. The fresh sage is definitely a great addition to the polenta.

I used the polenta as a base for a light cream wild mushroom sauce as suggested in other reviews. It was incredible. The combo of squash, garlic and sage with the polenta was a perfect complement to the mushrooms. I made the squash puree the night before and made the sauce and polenta right before serving. This worked out great.

This was fantastic! It was so creamy and yummy as it was...I bet you could reduce the cheese if you want to lower the fat content, with little sacrifice to taste. Labor intensive but it makes a lot, and it's worth it

I started out with high hopes but ultimately was disappointed with this dish. I tasted the pureed squash and garlic before adding it to the polenta, and it was terrific, but its flavor got lost once it was added to the pot. I also had a problem with lumps in the polenta, which may have been caused by the fact that I could only get ahold of cornmeal from a health food store and it had been minimally milled. Next time I will just stop with the pureed squash and garlic, add a bit of salt, put it in a small gratin dish, bake it a few minutes, and serve it as a colorful side dish.

My husband doesn't like sage, so I omitted it. I serve this topped with broiled Chilean sea bass (or salmon), Buerre Blanc (sauce), freshly chopped dill or chives surrounded by broccoli florets. This recipe will impress your guests.

I've made this several times for company and it's been a hit each time (including with a toddler who refuses to each ANY orange vegetables).

I used fresh thyme from my garden rather than sage, omitted the salt, and used organic Delicata squash which I had on hand. We found this recipe delicious and beautifully subtle. I liked the original fresh taste better than the stronger herb taste of the second day reheating. I would like to serve a lightly flavored meat and onion and mushroom stew on a bed of this polenta as a tasty winter dish.

I made the recipe exactly as written except that since I'm a vegetarian I used vegetable broth, and I used Parrano cheese (melts a little better), and following the suggestion in a previous comment and served it with a simple mushroom sauce. Fantastic! But the best part was yet to come: I had about 3 or 4 cups of polenta left (there are only two of us) and I mixed in the leftover sauce, 2 eggs, about 1/3 cup of 1/2 and 1/2, ladled that into ramekins and baked it in a water bath for 45 minutes. I served that with a simple cheesee sauce and it was heavenly! I'd make it again just to have the leftovers to make that "flan" again.

Wasn't sure of this unusual combination but it was perfect! I served it with a simple, wild mushroom sauce. It was the highlight of a very upscale, multi-course meal served to a very discriminating group. Everyone raved.

Excellent! A very different taste and all our guests raved! I substituted sweet potatoes for polenta. A real keeper and I will make it again many times. Keep this one in your "special" receipe file!

I added a dash of cinnamon to give it a little kick. Tastes better the next day, once the flavors have had a chance to meld.

Excellent combination of very earthy flavors. I did not have butternut so I substituted accorn squash, it would probably do well with pumpkin. Definitely a repeater.

Loved the butternut squash baked with garlic and sage, but preferred mixing it with mashed Yukon Gold potatoes. Will definitely make it a regular fall recipe substituting the potatoes.

Excellent! I served this with pork shops and winter greens. Make it super easy by cooking the polenta in the microwave.
