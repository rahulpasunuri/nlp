I bought popsicle molds for my kids to make with the sitter this summer. This is the best recipe we've tried. I just used sugar syrup we already had though (equal parts sugar and water) and my daughter added it to taste. Delicious!

Made with 3 cups of pineapple and adjusted sugar and water accordingly. It made 8 popsicles, so 4 cups would make a lot more. I was conservative with the sugar as the pineapple was very ripe and sweet and I didn't want to overly sweeten it. The fresh pineapple chunks in the pops are great. Very tasty and easy to make.
