I found the addition of feta cheese greatly elevated the flavor of this otherwise very average salad. Flavor of cumin is strong, but I happen to really like cumin so that wasn't a problem.

This has the IDEA of a good salad. It's hard to put my finger on exactly what is off. You get just a taste of what this salad COULD be, with a change or two, but unfortunately it is, in my opinion, just..."off." Perhaps it's too much lemon juice, but on the other hand, the sweetness from the honey was pronounced as well. I liked the cumin but would grind the seeds next time so they aren't as intrusive. Liked the cabbage, cukes, and cilantro tastes. Not sure I'd bother again, but if I did, I might add some peanuts at the last minute.

The flavor was not that great and the tamarind made it look like a salad in mud. Not my favorite.

We really enjoyed this. I toasted the cumin and then ground it, though, as you would normally do with cumin in raita (which this salad resembles.)

This was just OK. The cumin seeds were very overwhelming. Plus, you could not taste the tamarind.
