This was very good, but not something that I would use for company. The recipe seemed quite simple so I did some adjustments. I don't know that they are necessary though. Instead of the feta cheese cubes, I used non-briny feta and added marinated artichoke hearts for interest. I also skilpped on the red onion and drizzled with olive oil

This was OK. I probably would not make it again-maybe it was the taste of the feta with pasta.I did not BBQ veggies - but roasted peppers, garlic and peppers in the oven with Olive oil and Italian seasoning.

This was good, but not amazing. It's an easy thing to throw together for company but it didn't blow me away. The addition of red pepper flakes helped.

A nice change from Italian pasta. I couldn't find feta in oil, but I found a block of garlic & herb feta that I cubed up. I also marinated the vegetables in olive oil, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper before grilling. I loved the grilled taste of the veggies!

This was excellent! I didnt have any feta in oil, so I marinated the bell peppers, onions, & tomatoes in red pepper salad dressing/marinade. Also pan roasted instead of bbq the veggies. I will definitely make this again. Best recipe I have found on here in a long long time.

Nice, easy summer recipe. The feta I had on hand was not in oil so I substituted plain olive oil, salt, pepper and one clove minced garlic. I also added two more cloves minced garlic to the hot pasta. Good dinner, and good leftovers for lunch the next day.

Love this recipe. I have made it over and over again to great reviews. Using the jar of Feta in Oil & herbs is a must! I do not devieate from the recipe one bit except to possibly add a little more olive oil at the end, depending on how much the veggies soak up. The fresh oregano gives it a great finish.

Very good with some modifications, I added a grilled chicken breast that I sliced up after grilling, and lots of garlic (also, I halved the bell peppers, grilled them, then sliced them. Much easier). BF not a big fan of feta I found out, so next time I'll try using little balls of mozzerella. Pretty easy, very tasty & healthful (PS I used whole wheat blend pasta)!

Wonderful! If you can't find feta in oil use good-quality feta, add some olive oil, and any blend of herbs you want. I used fresh oregano and sage. Minced garlic also boosts the flavor.

Delicious! You can't go wrong with anything with grilled vegetables. My husband eats several large servings because he loves the flavors.

Grilled vegetables are always delicious. Combine these yummy vegetables with pasta, feta, and fresh oregano makes a fantastic summer meal.

This recipe is dull, even with the additions other reviewers suggested. It actually tasted much better as a cold pasta salad alongside sandwiches the next day.

Used herbed feta packaged without oil (all the store had) and so I marinated it in olive oil for a few hours before making the recipe. I also added freshly chopped basil and garlic to the marinade, which jazzed it up some. Turned out very good.

Having read other reviews, decided to add a bit more "oomph", so added white balsamic vinegar, lemon pepper, garlic and red pepper flakes to oil from feta. Used baby bells cut in half and added zucinni slices for more fiber. Only skewered the onions and tomatoes. Added 1/2 the feta cubes to pasta as soon as it was drained along with a little of the marinade and put rest on top of each serving. Would probably add more garlic next time. Nice meatless dinner and miminal work.

Fantastic! Perfect for a hot summer night. It's so easy too. The flavors were wonderful. Fresh oregano is a must! I used herbed feta but didn't have it in oil so I took olive oil, added a couple cloves of chopped garlic and more fresh oregano. I quartered the peppers, grilled them, and then sliced them. This is a lot easier than trying to deal with all those slices.

I have made this dish twice. Once with just olive oil, garlic and oregano. I even added a chicken breast. I agree with the other reviewer - very bland and needed some zip. Made it again last night for vegetarian friends and I did buy a jar of the feta in oil and herbs. This time it was fantastic and had great reviews. I did chop some basil and put it in a bowl on the table along with extra feta but there were no takers. I did add two Oriental eggplants and two bananna peppers because I picked them from the garden that morning.

I would make this dish again only if it could be jazzed up somehow. It was very very very bland. Couldn't find Feta in marinade so made my own with a cube of feta, some olive oil and garlic. Definitely needs more spices. Concept is excellent but flavor is boring.
