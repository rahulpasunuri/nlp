This came out great. We actually made it with swordfish rather than mahi-mahi. Also, instead of boiling and straining tamarind pulp, I simply used prepared tamarind paste (in the Indan foods section). Tasted great but also didn't form a glaze. What do we need to do to get a glaze? Broil under high heat?

I agree the sauce was a bit thin. I even marinated the fish in the sauce before cooking, but the flavor did not come through. I may try again.

The flavor of the sauce was really good, but was not really a glaze and just ran off the fish. If I made it again I would reduce the sauce to a thicker consistancy. The fish on the grill was really good anyway.

To dorisintoronto, I wouldn't be too concerned about both the soy and fish sauce overpowering the fish, but I would personally omit the salt. Salt is rather unnecessary when you've got other ingredients to take that seasoning role.

This isn't really a review. I'm concerned that the soy sauce and fish sauce will be too salty and overpower the fish. Any thoughts?
