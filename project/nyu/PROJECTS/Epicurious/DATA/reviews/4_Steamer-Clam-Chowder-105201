This was amazing. I tripled it for a big soup and salad party we give every year. I used whole milk instead of cream. This made for a much more authentic chowder than the gloppy stuff that is served in most restaurants. I thought that the clam broth was going to be too salty, but it was perfect. I have almost two pints left to use for other soups. Well worth the work.

This was a very good basic recipe, but you do not have to cut the necks off of the clams. The black neck is all sweat meat. When the clam is under ground this can strech up to a foot long atleast so the clam can feed at the surface of the sand. If you want to cut the neck off after peeling the skin off that covers them (becouse you don't like the black color) then dip them in butter and eat them like you would a steamer. If you do not you are wasting a very tasty part of the clam.

Is there such a thing as "meaty" salt pork? Mine was definitely not meaty, but it really did add a depth of flavor to the chowder that was wonderful. I can't imagine bacon adding such flavor. Of coarse, this is not low calorie as the flavor came from fat, but it really was an excellent clam chowder.

very good, very easy. used littlenecks rather than steamers without any problem, and substituted fresh parsley for the thyme/bay leaves, again with no problem. agree with the other reviewer who said half & half or less cream than called for is appropriate; the broth is very rich on its own.

Outstanding!!! A real traditional, rich but brothy chowder. I'll definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe. I happened to get very gritty/sandy clams. In spite of repeated rinsings, I still had sand in the bottom of the pot in which I steamed the claims. When shucking them, I suspected (correctly) that the clam meat itself had too much grit. I placed the cooked clams into the strained broth and rinsed them thoroughly,lifting them out by hand. This cured the problem and the clams were grit-free when placed in the chowder. Of course, the broth needed to be strained again.

I'm allergic to shellfish, so I don't personally know how this came out, but all I got was rave reviews from my guests..."best clam chowder"..."better than my mother's"....."mmm mmm mmm" was about all I heard. Got the clams fresh and degritted from my shellfish place here in Maine. Of course, I did make this my own by doing some different things, including substituting sage leaves for bay leaves and using lemon thyme instead of regular thyme. Also used about 3/4 cup half and half instead of cream and celery seed instead of stalks (just because I forgot to get stalks). I'm going to use this recipe in our restaurant and see what others have to say.

There is no better clam chowder than this one! It is unbelievably good. I have made it four times, and the only thing I do differently is leave the bacon in, rather than crumbling it over. (This is key, in my opinion.) Whenever I make this dish, I prove to French friends that American cooking can be something to shout about!

Wonderful, rich, traditional recipe. Everyone loved it -- including the kids!

this is an awesome chowder recipe. It is very easy, but a bit time consuming. Also very rich, so we make it once a year at Thanksgiving. Substituting a little more butter instead of the pork fat is fine, and doesn't take away too much.
