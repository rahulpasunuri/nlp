I have not made this yet, but I have made caramel in a slow cooker by putting a can (literally still in the can) of condensed milk in a water bath. Easy and delish!

My family and friends all love this recipe, I get request for it for birthdays and holidays. It can be a bit tricky though, and it's easy to burn the caramel if your heat is even a touch too high. Heating the cream just a little and adding it slowly prevents the formation of a hard caramel lump that doesn't want to dissolve. All told, the effort involved is worth the final product!

I made this for a graduation and made just a couple of changes. First off, do not use Bakers or Refined Sugar for the caramel, it has a tendency to clump badly. I'm a diehard lover of caramel and make alot of it but after dumping 2 batches I went back to my tried and true method of stirring the sugar with a fork until it starts to melt, then swirling the pan every few minutes, followed by taking a pastry brush dipped in water to clean the sides. The caramel turned out perfect that way. Also I used amaretto cookies for the crust instead of the chocolate wafer and it took a lot of the ultra chocolate sweetness and gave it a nice balance. All in all a good recipe but I definitely don't recommend the way they suggest making the caramel.

This is my first cheesecake I've ever made, and it was delicious. I didn't think it was too rich, but then I'm a chocoholic. My family loved it too, but they wanted a chocolate sauce to go on top.

I followed the directions for the caramel explicitly and it did not turn out. After adding the cream, the lumps of caramel never dissolved. There are too many great cheesecake recipes that are far less time consuming. Don't waste your time on this one!

A 9" pan works fine. The caramel does take a long time to make but well worth the effort. Just get yourself a good sous chef to do the grunt work, a spoon in one hand and a beer in the other.

can anyone tell me what size springform pan should be used? The crumb base recipe is for a 24cm pan (9") but that seems rather large for the amount of cream cheese in the recipe.

I used a 17 oz. jar of Mrs. Richardsons' caramel sauce instead of making my own. The batter tasted great and the cheesecake smells pretty good.

I thought this was excellent. The caramel gives it a depth that is unexpected. This is not particularly difficult--most caramel recipes recommend cooking at low heat to avoid burning, which takes a long time. If you are willing to be vigilant, you can crank up the heat to make it go faster, but just understand that it could burn quickly. I'll definitely make again.

The cheesecake was ok but needed something, I warmed some Dulce de Leche and spread it evenly over the top and then drizzled on some semi-sweet ganache. The caramel is easier to handle if you warm the cream to a simmer before mixing it with the caramel. It shouldn't harden up as much, at least mine didn't. Next time I'd lower the baking temperature to 325, my springform pan is black and the crust got a tiny bit overdone.

this was good cheesecake but way too much work for the result. there are so many simple, sinful recipes for cheesecake out there, I didn't think it was worth the bother of making the caramel

Rating: 4
Sinful, orgasmic, unbelievably rich! I'm glad I read the reviews first on patience for the caramel, and that the method did say it would steam and ball up into a hard clump -- it did, I would have been in a panic if I wasn't expecting it (I'm not a big candy maker). Took this to Thanksgiving as only the second example of my cooking for my boyfriend's family, and it was a huge hit. Given it's richness, I would say it could serve 12 easily, and up to 16 vs. the 8-10 stated. Definitely my holiday triumph!

Horrible! I made the caramel, which turned out good. But, once I added the cream, I couldn't get the caramel to dissolve. I tried for nearly an hour as was left with large, hard chunks of caramel. I proceeded to add a small amount of chocolate, which turned into a paste. It was then impossible to continue from there, as it was ruined!

Phenomenal! I like plain cheesecakes but this was one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had. I used oreo's instead of the chocolate cookies, omitted water bath but kept the rest as it.

I recently made this for friends, the plates were left without a crumb. The sour cream adds an interesting flavour to the dessert, it is a perfect balance of sweet and rich. I read the reviews and drizzled the caramel sauce over the slices of cheesecake. I will definately make this one again!

This was very good - VERY rich - not for the faint of heart. Had alot of trouble with the caramel - took much longer than expected - but well worth the effort. Would try to serve smaller pieces next time - maybe with vanilla ice cream to cut some of the sweetness. The crust was incredible - used chocolate teddy grahams

WOW! I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a hit! I substituted 1 C of ricotta for one of the blocks of cream cheese to lighten it a bit, and I made a gluten-free crust with Italian Amaretti cookies (from the Italian market) instead of the chocolate. It was so delicious! Even my husband who is not a cheesecake fan had to admit it was yummy! A definite keeper!

This cheesecake is Excellent!! My daughter brought her roommate home from college bragging about my cooking, so thanks to this cheescake my reputation remains secure!

I should have read the reviews first--would have saved lots of caramel anxiety! It took forever, and I was under time pressure. Burned my hand splashing caramel on it, cursed lots--all the tips would have helped lots. But 18 Easter guests went home VERY happy with dessert! The texture is outstanding. I used low-fat chocolate Nilla wafers; that's all I could find, but it was a super crust.

I thought that this dessert was delicious but probably would not make it again due to the time that it takes to make the caramel. Would consider using ready-made caramel instead.

This was a breeze to make and tasted like I'd worked on it all day! Rich and delicious -- it didn't need any topping. A word of advice for first time caramel makers: low heat and be patient. The sugar really will melt down eventually but if you walk away and leave this cooking, you're asking for big trouble.

This cheesecake was a hit! I used an 8 inch pan instead of the 6 inch and it took about 40-45 minutes to cook. I took the advice of another and made the flourless chocolate cake caramel sauce and drizzled it over the top. The caramel sauce was just the right consistency.

By far, the most divine cheesecake recipe I've ever made and I've made lots! Smooth & creamy beyond compare! Definitely use a high quality chocolate-I use Guittard Vintage Dark Choc (64%) cacao. Taking time to carefully beat in each ingredient is key. Homeade caramel ingredient is awesome. This cheesecake is a hit every time I serve at a party.

Absolutely delicious! This cheesecake was very smooth and creamy and had a fantastic chocolate flavor. The caramel flavor was mild but complemented the chocolate very well. It was also very easy to make...except for the caramel. It was my first time making caramel, and I was very frustrated...even to the point of cursing at the sugar! However, I should have heeded the other reviews and realized that it would work. Next time I will have more patience! Eventually I ended up with a beautiful caramel sauce and the rest of the cheesecake was an cinch. I could not find chocolate wafer cookies for the crust, so I used chocolate Teddy Grahams instead. (The crust was great.) Also, be sure to use high-quality chocolate. It is worth the extra expense.

It's a good cheesecake - not the best but good. I would make it again. Nothing tricky about it except making the caramel which just took me a bit of time since I hadn't made it. It was difficult getting it to dissolve back into the cream. I think the whole caramelization process took me a 1/2 hour of just stirring and stirring and stirring....

This was the best chocolate cheesecake I've had! It was straightforward and easy (important since I have a four-week-old daughter... I have to bake during naps!). Don't worry about high heat while caramelizing the sugar... just watch it and stir constantly. Turn the heat down once the sugar starts to melt. Enjoy!!

This was a delicious cheesecake; not too hard to make. In response to those who found making the caramel portion of the recipe to be time-consuming, it's fine to turn up the heat. I cooked the sugar on moderate high heat and then turned it down once the sugar started melting and browning. Was not as time-consuming and it still came out okay. I made the caramel sauce from the recipe for FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH CARAMEL SAUCE to be spooned over the slices when I plated them. Was a big success!

My boyfriend and I were a hit by bringing this cheesecake to a Christmas party. Indeed, the caramel is a bit time consuming, but don't let that scare you. We could not find chocolate wafers, so we used Oreo cookies. We scraped out and discarded the creamy filling and saved the Oreo wafers for the crust. You'll need one medium bag of Oreo cookies to make one crust. FANTASTIC!

The carmel process was extremely time consuming, but the outcome was well worth it! Definetly alllow for an half hour or so to melt the sugar and remelt the caramel. I used 1 fat free cream cheese block with two low fat blocks and it was still rich and creamy. I also made a crust from chocolate graham crackers, sugar, and butter! My guest loved it!

this is aoutstanding desert..it has become the secret weapon at the fine dining restaurant i work at..a few suggestions-add a shot of amaretto/rum to the batter..also initially when preparing the caramel add 2 tbsp water and 1 tsp lemon juice and THEN boil and whisk in cream..this way the mixture gives a creamier texture to the cheesecake, also omit the sour cream..i garnish mine with caramel sauce and chocolate dipped amaretti biscuits..oral pleasure never felt sooo good...

This is a wonderful and fairly simple recipe. I served it with a dollop of coffee flavoured whip cream (I added about a 1/4 of a tsp of coffee extract to it) and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. I, too, found it time consuming making the caramel. However, I think it was likely because I was paranoid about burning it and had the temp too low.

Be prepared to spend some time on the caramel making part of the recipe, but it's definitely worth it. The cake is very creamy and smooth, with plenty of the caramel flavor blended with chocolate. I served it with some raspberry sauce over top(simmered frozen berries with some sugare and strained it)......it was a major hit!

Everyone loved this! True, the caramel flavor wasn't very pronounced, but it was delisious all the same. I made another batch of the caramel, poured it onto a sheet of waxed paper, let it harden, and then cracked it into small shards. It looked great as a garnish- very professional looking. A drizzle of chocolate sauce perfected it. An all around amazing cheesecake!

I make 3 different large cheesecakes every summer for an event we have in our home, and I tried this a year ago. It didn't seem to me the caramel flavor came through enough, so I made another batch of the caramel that went into the cheesecake, then used it as a sauce for the finished cheesecake. I thought it greatly improved it and made a really good cheesecake spectacular.

This turned out perfectly for me (which delighted me, as it was my first baked cheesecake and I was feeling trepidation about the whole process). However, I agree with the review that said that the caramel flavour didn't come through enough. It tasted like very chocolatey cheesecake to me. I think it might be nicer with the caramel turned into a sauce to drizzle on top...

This was my first try making a cheesecake (I wanted to do a test before making it for Thanksgiving), and it worked out pretty well. I think, though, that with the trouble it takes to make caramel, we should have been able to taste it more. Maybe I'll use a cup and a half of sugar next time. Other than that, was easy to make and tastes good.

I will *definitely* make this cheesecake again!!! :) (Also, I topped it off with a streusel topping and drizzled chocolate and caramel sauces on top.)

I am not a cheesecake fan, nor a fan of caramel. My family hates cheesecake. I don't know WHY I decided to make this, but I did. The way the caramel was hinted at on your taste buds, and how the chocolate was so amazingly blended with the cheese - it was a cake like no other I have ever had. My family ate nearly the whole thing, each liking it for a different reason. Friends of mine who LOVE cheesecake said it was the best they'd ever had. Oh - and I used 2 low-fat cream cheeses instead of full-fat ones. -Tygre

This is a fabulously rich chocolate cheesecake. I also made the caramel with 1/4 cup water -- if you haven't made caramel before, I recommend reading instructions for it in the Joy of Cooking or some other such text. I substituted yogurt for sour cream, and this cheesecake was still so rich that I think it should serve more like 16-20 people -- if 8 people ate this, I'm afraid they'd hallucinate.

I personally prefer a light and fluffy cheesecake but the people in my office disagreed with me and gave this a 4 forks.

This adapted to a low fat version using evaporated skim milk instead of heavy cream, and low fat cheese and sour cream. The sugar melts best in a heavy saucepan (Le Cruset) on direct heat - - watch out for the cream, it bubbles up in addition to "steams" Great flavor, easy to make and inexpensive.

I made this recipe as one of two deserts for a large party I gave. A guest contributed the second desert. The cheesecake came out all right but not worth the effort put into making it. I must have stirred that sugar for 45 minutes before it became caramel and then another messy 45 minutes for the caramel to dissolve. Not enough caramel taste to make all that trouble worth it. Worst moment was next day when guest asked for desert recipe, "not for the cheesecake, for that other desert". Oh well.
