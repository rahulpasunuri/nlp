This had the potential be be really good but had a couple of issues that will need to be resolved before a four fork rating is issued. First, the crust was good but the sides of the crust shrunk down to almost the same level as the bottom. Therefore, some of the filling ran down the sides and below the crust causing it to stick slightly. I did double up on the crust thickness along the sides but that didn't help. I did use an 11" tart pan instead of the listed 9" so perhaps the crust was too thin. Will need to do this again for re-evaluation. Second, there wasn't much sweetness, even with the 1/3 cup sugar added. Both the fresh apricots and cherries tasted sweet in the raw but did not translate that sweetness into the final tart. Overall, this is a good dish if you are not looking for a dessert which is expected to be sweet.

Wow! This was delicious. Despite the fact that I knew from experience that cherries and apricots go beautifully together, I had low expectations. The filling is so simple I couldn't imagine it coming together so well. However, this was sublime. The only change I made was to use an orange preserve (very sparingly, maybe a 1/4 of a cup) because that was what was on hand. Anyone who enjoys this should make the cherry/apricot crumble from the orignal Greens Cookbook by Deborah Madison. One of my all time favorites.

I made this for company and it was wonderful! I used fresh apricots only, since I didn't have any cherries and it was delicious. I just weighed out 25 ounces of fruit but when I started to place it on the crust it really seemed like too much, so I used somewhat less than the amount given in the recipe. I also added some slivered almonds on top, but they were unnecessary. The crust was easy to place in the pan (I used a 9 1/2 inch springform pan instead of a tart pan). The crust was light and buttery. I tried blanching the fruit but since some of the fruit was a little under-ripe and I didn't leave it in the pot long enough, I was unable to peel most of the apricots. As the other reviewers mentioned, the fruit tasted just as good with the peels on. The apricot preserves gave the dessert a beautiful glaze.

An incredibly delicious way to use the fresh local cherries, apricots and butter from my CSA. I didn't have a tart pan handy, so I made a rustic version--just put the dough round on a baking sheet, piled the fruit in the center, leaving about 1 1/2 inches all the way around, and folded the edges over. This recipe makes a very short crust; it is delicious and tender, but somewhat sticky and challenging to work with. A slice of this, served warm with vanilla ice cream, stopped the conversation cold around the dinner table. In the best possible sense.

This is a favorite recipe. It is quick, doesn't use much fruit so it is convenient and it always turns out. I do not peel the apricots and I just mix the fruit and tumble it onto the crust. If you are lucky to have leftovers, they make a great breakfast treat.

Great dessert, next time I will not blanch the apricots, they were too soft. Fresh cherries make this a great dessert. The crust was excellent-almost like a tender shortbread cookie.

One of my favorite summer desserts. To simplify, I don't blanch or peel the apricots or halve the cherries (why bother?). Only need to use 1/4-1/3 cup of apricot preserves.

We have a large apricot tree in our front yard - this is another good way to use up all those apricots (I'm tired of canning!). I didn't do any of the blanching - just sliced and put in the pastry shell. Tasted & looked great! I also did not strain the preserves, just heated on the stove. Next time I will use less than the 1/2 cup, though, because I thought it was a little drippy when I sliced. Remember to push your dough all the way up the sides of the tart pan, even a little higher than the edge because it does shrink.

This is a relatively easy summer dessert that yields big results. The prep is a little time-consuming, but not complicated.

I've already made it 3 times. This is a fantastic recipe. The blanching of the apricots is a bit of a pain, but the end result is divine!
