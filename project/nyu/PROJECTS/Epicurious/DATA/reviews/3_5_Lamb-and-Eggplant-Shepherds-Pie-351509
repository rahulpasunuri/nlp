Why do recipes include "preferably organic"????? Why why why? It doesn't make any difference taste wise, but I guess it is important to go all "Al Gore". It is like "gluten free" recipes. 1/2 of one percen of people are allergic to gluten. but now it is all the rage. Idiots. Oh, and I am sure the lamb ate alot of gluten in his life. It is like a chicken that you think never ate any bugs in his/her life. It ain't happening.

Yum. I didn't rate it because I didn't follow it exactly... I used ground kibbe (half lamb, half beef) because that's what my grocery store had. I also added some cinnamon to the filling... very nice. And parmigiana for the mashed potatoes... couldn't find kasseri. All in all, delicious comfort food for a cool autumn evening, and not too labor intensive. Shepherd's pie shouldn't be a big production.

Made this for a second time, again to rave reviews from my dinner party guests. It's labor intensive, but really yummy. I used ground lamb, which made it easier to prepare; I liked the consistency of the ground lamb, too. I use pecorino romano cheese, which is just fine!

yum yum yum. made it with ground lamb and goat cheese with the potatoes. This is a sunday night recipe for me as there are a lot of steps involved to make this but sooo worth it. lots of leftovers and can't wait to make it again my mouth waters at the thought of it!

Very Good. Did as a quick method by adding half of liquid. Also used leftover meat.

Very tasty and my husband loved it. I actually made it with ground lamb, and rather than flour and brown the meat, I browned it and drained the meat. Rather than cooking it for 1 hour and then 45 minutes, I added only 1/2 the broth and cooked it for about 20 minutes, and then with the top off until the juices had reduced. I couldn't find either of the suggested cheeses, so I just used goat cheese, which was still very good. Next time, I would back off on all of the salt, it was a very salty dish. Overall, will make again with all of the changes (less time and still very tasty).

This is absolutely delicious. The Kasseri cheese is a must in this recipe. I would suggest using a good pot such as Le Creuset for this dish as the bottom of the pot becomes very dark after adding the onions and there is so much flavour after deglazing with the wine. Do not use a non-stick pot for this recipe because the browned bits are a must. This is a definite keeper in my books!

The day I took the March Bon Appetit from my mailbox and saw this on the cover, I couldn't wait to make it. Finally, last night I made it, and it was fantastic! I was a bit skeptical with the mixed reviews. I cut the recipe in half, and made it in 4 gratin dishes. Also made the filling in the morning. My only changes were reducing the olive oil, using 1% milk, and Percorino Romano, as I looked everywhere for kasseri, and couldn't find it. So, so delicious. Time consuming, but well worth it.

Taking a few suggestions here really helped as I shortened the cook time by using ground lamb and I used less liquid, which resulted in a thick meaty-eggplant mixture that wouldn't be soupy underneath the mash. I used fire-roasted crushed tomatoes, so I wasn't able to cut back on that liquid, so it had to be the beef stock. Instead I threw in a bouillion cube to supplement. All in all, with the can of tomatoes, I used only 2 c of broth. Also, because I used ground lamb, I was able to use less olive oil too and I added about a tablespoon of flour after the onions were cooked to help thicken, as I did not "dust" the lamb cubes and brown. This worked very well, as it made a roux. I did use kasseri cheese. You shouldn't substitute feta, but pecorino romano as the recipe suggests, as kasseri is very similar and not as salty as feta. Plus the kasseri is harder and can be grated. One other little change, which might be personal taste, was to rough chop the eggplant after it was cooked. I thought that texture would work better with my ground lamb. I gave this three stars because it was better than good but not exceptional.

This was a great meal. I had people begging for more. I substituted TVP for the lamb and it still was amazing. Also, I couldn't find kasseri cheese, so I used feta, and again--it still was great. It was definatley time consuming, but it is perfect for a rainy day that you want to spend in the kitchen pondering life.

Rating: 4
This was a lot of work, but worth it. I added extra eggplant, as suggested, as well as extra garlic, and even a couple of parsnips. Couldn't get my hands on Kasseri at the last minute, so I used an aged pecorino romano instead. Even my very fussy husband called it "a keeper".

While making this, I kept saying "this better be worth it" because it is a very labor-intensive dish. It is worth every minute...absolutely delicious!

Lots of work, but worth it. Made the filling in advance over the weekend, extending the cooking time and allowing the texture to thicken and flavors to develop in the fridge. We will use the recipe for the potato topping on it's own -- it was that good.

This was very good and tasty. I made it exact to the recipe. It was more watery than I had hoped and do not believe cooking uncovered on the stovetop another 15 minutes would have helped. I drained and dried the eggplant very well. The lamb cost $25 so not sure it added so much to the dish for the cost. I'll try other meat next time and use it ground since the pie ended up mushy anyway. Great taste and filling - needs more potatoes to cover entire casserole and would add more eggplant - it got lost in the dish.

As a Brit who grew up on Shepherd's Pie, I couldn't wait to try this. I agree with the other reviewers, a crazy amount of work and steps for a tasteless runny result. You could make a much tastier one with ground lamb, either left over from a roast or fresh, and half the ingredients listed here. It also needs more mashed potato on top to counteract the runny problem so many complained about.

Rating: 3
I intend to make this as written in the future, but I made a quick version that I thought was delightful. For the filling, I used ground lamb and cooked it with the eggplantand other veg, then added the wine, broth and a flour and water slurry to thicken the gravy. This cut down on the cooking time substantially - as written it would take almost 4 hours - this way it was a quick weeknight meal. I also baked for only 20 minutes and then broiled for 3 minutes. The kasseri in the mashed was delicious and the whole meal was filling and delightful.

I used red wine to reduce with the onions and used fresh oregano and a can of whole peeled tomatoes in the sauce(broken up with the spoon while cooking). Also, I used lamb leg and cut/trimmed it off the bone myself. Used the bone for stock later in the week. I did not cover it for an hour and uncover for 45 min. Instead I cooked the sauce uncovered for @1 hour until thickened. The kaseri cheese is the element that made this dish really excellent in my opinion. I'm considering making this for my family's Greek Easter celebration this year. I thought is was THAT good.

I made the recipe with no changes. It is the only way to really rate or review a recipe, in my opinion, The family thought it was excellent. It made a huge amount of food so when I saw that I took half of the meat and eggplant and froze it. I do think when I thaw it, I will add some cinnamon to it. Overall, I thought it very easy to make. It was time consuming but did lots of things in between. I actually made the meat and eggplant part the day before and so the next day, it was very quick to finish it off and bake.

Rating: 2
I agree with most of what everyone is saying so far: too much liquid, and not enough flavor to merit the amount of time spent on prep. I actually halved the recipe (since there were only 2 of us), and decreased the liquids a bit on top of that. I also left the top off the entire time to help reduce the liquids more quickly. However I wonder if that contributed to the lack of flavor (not enough time to "stew")? I also doubled the oregano and added some cinnamon. I would double that quantity again next time. Overall, this dish was ok, and I'll try it again to see if I can oomph it a bit more.

I found this recipe to be quite bland and not worth the effort. My husband was equally unimpressed and he's generally appreciative of what I cook. There are better Shepherd's pie recipies (i.e., The Joy of Cooking's using simple ground beef or lamb) and better things to do with lamb that you take the trouble to trim and brown -- i.e., a flavorful Indian curry. If you do make this, don't omit the cheese from the potatoes, as it provides the only real flavor. I used Pecorino Romano.

It says one 1.5 pound eggplant.

Loved it but time consuming. Drained my Muir Glen tomatoes to leave approx. 1/4 cup liquid and simmered it down quite a bit. Next time will use the pressure cooker to shorten cooking time. Used extra eggplant and not sure why others stated they wished they would have cooked eggplant less.... needs to be soft as it doesn't cook in the oven. I love Cavender's Greek seasoning and Vegeta Gourmet seasoning and soup mix. Added 2 teaspoons of each for extra flavor. Great comfort food and tastes great on day 2 and 3 also.

This was an excellent recipe, with great flavor and consistency. A few comments: I used half the milk mixture for the potatoes, and I might think about splashing in a little red wine along with the white to add a little density to the eggplant lamb mixture. Other than those two minor comments, it was a treat. It actually was very easy - it just took time for each step to cook. so while it did take a long time to complete, most of it wasn't active cooking. And it did not feed 8-10; in our case, it was more like 6.

We would give this 2.5 forks if we could. The pie itself was tasty, but with all of the prep work, we were really thinking this was going to be a home run. Our final take: good, but our time would be better spent on another recipe.

This is the best ever of the lamb Shepherd's pie recipes. I made it exactly as written and we could not rave enough about it. I read that Julia Child always used white vermouth when a recipe called for white wine and that is what I used. A truly spectacular dish!

This was good, but I thought it was a little weird. It was like eating eggplant Parmesan and meat and potatoes mixed together. It tasted pretty good, but it was strange. Also, takes forever to make.

This was wonderful. I simmered it uncovered or partially uncovered for the entire time, and the consistency was perfect. I also added about a cup of diced carrots. If you use quality diced tomatoes, you shouldn't have a ton of liquid to drain - keep that in mind. This recipe takes a long time, but is perfect for a Sunday when you can let it simmer for hours while you're doing other things.

Humm I must have seen this recipe before somewhere else because I have it, and have made it with some exceptions. I'm always on the look out for anything that has lamb or eggplant. And was hoping this would be a huge deviation but alas its the same one. When I compared the recipes I did indeed find that there was a difference between the ratio of solids to liquid. With there being more liquid then is necessary in this recipe. I also have found this to be the case with several of the recipes. In the case of this one, just off hand I can see that the liquid ratio would be affected by the canned tomatoes. Depending on the brand the liquid ratio would vary dramatically. Higher end tomatoes have 1/4 cup of liquid and the lower end can have almost a cup. Needless to say that would change the viscosity and cooking time greatly. I have found that when these recipes are tested they use the best of the best so if you dont have then you will need to adjust. In a standard market the meats for instance is low grade choice where as they will use prime or the upper grades for all of their meats. You would have to make adjustments the meats are not the same. I do agree that to change the recipe beyond what it should be (adding velvetta as a substitute for any cheese or making a dish that is oven based in a microwave, OK that is just wrong, but I have seen people posting reviews that have done this). Perhaps other's have the time and money to expend on a recipe that they can see without a few tweeks would end in disaster and do it anyway for the "experience" and then just toss the messy results. But in these economic times I don't see many people doing that. Not to mention that I am Jewish so cant do the meat and milk thing. So in this recipe there is not butter in the potatoes.

i made the recipe as-is and this was absolutely delicious. definitely time consuming--not difficult, just lots of hours--but if you are in one of those all day cooking moods this is well worth it. great flavors, tender lamb (and tons of leftovers that just got better each day). the only change i will make next time is to either leave out some of the liquid or add in a longer reduction time at the end. it was a bit more soupy than stewey when i followed the recipe to a tee. and i couldn't find kasseri, so i used feta. yum.

It made a lot of food. This might sound weird, because there is a serving size recommendation, but it is very rich, so I think it makes more than it says. Also, it is very liquidy, if you make it, drain the tomatoes. And increase the eggplant. That was the best part of the dish. The dish is a lot of work...not sure if I would make it again.

Why do people review these recipes when they have changed ingredients, changed the make up of a recipe then say it didnt tase good? The whole idea i think is to review it as written with ingredioents, Then review it. Dont give a recipe a poor or bad review after you have changed ingredients and amounts of items in the recipes because then you are talking about YOUR recipe not the one as written. If make it, follow the recipe, if you dont have the correct ingredient go buy it. If you cant get the ingredient and you substitute something else and it tastes good to you thats fine but dont give a recipe a bad review for your mistakes.

This was very tasty and ultimate comfort food. I substituted ground lamb for ease of preparation, and can't imagine that the final product suffered because of it. The lamb flavor was lovely with the eggplant and herbs. It was a bit runny, but didn't deter my family from devouring it.

I agree with the others: very time consuming, too much liquid. I actually removed a couple of cups of the tomato sauce and added some flour to thicken it up. I used Pecorino Romano instead of the Greek cheese and the potatoes were really tasty. Although it was good, I don't think I'd make it again.

This was a good pie, I like mine with more kick to it butevery one else just loved it.

Poker Guys told me to shut up and eat it and quit talking about it. Good Job!!

Great comfort food. Not for the 30 minute chef howver! But if you make it in two stages as suggested it's great and you won't be too tired to enjoy the fruits of your labor. I ttok other reviewers advice and increased the amount of aggplant and cooked it less (good idea, but I didn't cook it quite long enough- so will adjust slghtly next time). My grocery didn't have kasseri, so substituted feta. It's a great fit for lamb. I would like a little more tartness and spice in the filling-maybe some balsamic vinegar and clove. The very first Shepard's Pie I had was from a great Irish lady who sautéd ground beef with onion, added ketchup and topped it with mashed potatoes with shredded cheddar cheese mixed in. Not very sophisticated , but yummy.

This lived up to the reviews-- it was delicious, but needs a few modifications because it's excessively liquidy. Because I'd read the reviews, I actually did all of the stove top simmering with the off, or partially off. It worked out well, however, it was still too liquidy. The next time I make this, and I will, I'm going to drain the diced tomatoes. Also, I made the suggested romano substitute and I found that 1 cup was more than sufficient-- at first it tasted far too sharp and I thought it would be awful, but assembled the two parts worked beautifully together. I made my potato topping ahead while my eggplant was sitting, so I reheated them right before I added them to the casserole. I ended up using some of the oven time as further reduction time on the stove top, and it worked just fine since everything went in hot. There's one mistake I made that definitely impacted my experience with the recipe-- I added the eggplant back in too early. Bummer. All in all, we and our guests loved the taste, but referred to it as "the goo" as we scraped the last of it out of the pot into our bowls. I look forward to making this again with a few minor adjustments!

Rating: 4
I agree with the other reviewers, this is a compliment-getting crowd-pleaser, and the amazing way my whole house smelled after I made it was an extra bonus. I also agree that it was time consuming (probably took me about 3.5 hours to make the lamb/eggplant filling only... and unless you are cooking all day, you definitely have to do that part ahead. Good for company, because if you do the lamb ahead, the potato part can be done about an hour before your guests arrive. The only thing I would change is, as others have suggested, reduce the lamb mixture a little longer so it is not quite as wet, before assembling with the potato topping. Mmmm can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight!

This, as everyone else has stated, took a long time, but it was sooooo worth it. My friend's husband doesn't care for lamb, so we made it one weekend when he was away. It was wonderful! It did make a lot, so I froze it for a next time.

Loved this recipe! My husband wants me to "star" as a definite keeper. I didn't cook the eggplant as long as suggested and it came out great. Also, I think I would add more eggplant next time too. I should have cooked the filling longer. You really want the filling firm, so that the topping doesn't sink into the filling. Time consuming, but well worth the results.

As another reviewer pointed out, this recipe is time-consuming, but if you are in the mood, very satisfying to prepare and consume! The house is filled with agreeable aromas which heighten anticipation of a great meal. Some men find this "perfume" more attractive than any other! I do agree that cooking time for the eggplant seemed too long (and for the lamb as well). My only alteration was to use "natural" lamb leg steaks from Trader Joe's and pecorino romano both of which worked well. The end product is copious, and I'm considering freezing half of the filling in the future for a second meal.

Astonishingly good. If you are in one of those cook-all-day moods and want a recipe that delivers on all that hard work, the flavors here are devine. The final product is huge, so we 2 ate it for 4 nights. It reheats nicely, each night becoming more tasty. Be sure to cook off all liquid in final 45 minute reduction, so the potatoes go down on a solid stew.

I thought this recipe was very good... but incredibly time consuming. I kept thinking of ways that I could have cut the time down, but I didn't actually do any of them, as I like to follow the recipe as closely as possible the first time I make it. Do not be scared of the EIGHT cloves of garlic in the filling; it isn't as crazy as you would expect. If you can't find kasseri cheese in your neck of the woods, I wouldn't worry too much. It adds a nice richness, but is actually a relatively mild cheese (compared to something like feta or halloumi). I would just leave it out if you can't find it. I think I would make it again, but it is incredibly time consuming (not difficult, but time consuming), so it won't go into my regular rotation.

This was one of the best sheperd's pies I've had. I agree with others that it is a little time consuming and the cheese is really unnecessary. Next time I will only put a sprinkling of cheese on top to make a nice golden crust. Also the eggplant cooked down to nothing, so maybe a little more of it, or cooked way less so it still holds it's shape would be nice. But, overall this was delicious.

I made this as written and thought it was delicious. The only thing I'll change next time will be to leave the kasseri cheese out of the mashed potatoes and maybe just sprinkle a little bit on top instead. I didn't think the flavor of the cheese came through all the other strong flavors and therefore it just added unecessary calories. Might even try a stronger flavored cheese sprinkled on top; maybe feta.

This was very tasty-albeit time consuming. I did prepare the filling the day before I planned to serve it. Next time I would saute the eggplant less than 8 minutes-myabe just 2-3 min. The flling was very good and the potato topping was decadent. It is a rich dish, and one helping was more than satisfying!

I made many, many changes and converted this to a vegetarian dish. A HUGE bonus to this is it really cuts the cooking time down - by more than half cut everything in half (except the eggplant) as I was cooking for only two, used Yves vegetarian ground "beef" in place of the lamb, used my own vegetable broth in place of the beef broth, baked the eggplant rather than fried it - also a time saver, used little baby yellow potatoes, unpeeled, used soy milk rather than regular milk, used machengo cheese rather than kasseri (couldn't find kasseri), and last but not least, baked in individual 8 oz ramikens rather than one pie dish. It was terrific, hearty comfort food that I will definitely make again. I cooked the onions while boiling the potatoes and baking the eggplant. then added the wine as directed, then the tomatoes, broth, garlic, oregano. At this point, you just open the package of vegetarian "beef" and mix it in with the other ingredients. as it's already cooked, I allowed the flavors to meld with the pan covered for about 20 minutes, then removed the cover, turned the heat up to reduce some of the liquid, stirred in the eggplant, filled the ramekins and popped them in the oven. oven time is a bit less too in the little ramekins than would be in a big pie dish. yummy
