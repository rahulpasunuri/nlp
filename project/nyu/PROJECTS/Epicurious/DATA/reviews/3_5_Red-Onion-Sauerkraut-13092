Whatever you do, don't make this in a cast iron pan. My first attempt I used green cabbage and the fore mentioned pan. Tasted great, it looked inky and was black. The second time used a non reactive pan and red cabbage. Now my family will all try it. It is really good and is pretty to boot. Great Christmas side dish and is really good made with duck fat instead of the vegetable oil.

I actually made this in an attempt (successful) to duplicate a fabulous Reuben sandwich I had In Seattle: toasted potato roll, pastrami, red wine kraut,cranberry aioli, Beecher's Flagship. Use your leftovers! This recipe is so delicious on its'own. Added chicken broth when the liquids got low. Chunk of pork cheek in the initial fry probably didn't hurt.

Made last night to test out prior to Oktoberfest and my neighbors loved it. Didn't have juniper berries, but substituted 2 star anise and a few grinds of fresh nutmeg; also added 1/4 tea fresh ground pepper. Makes enough for approx 10 servings; served it about 4 hours after completing and was very yummy. You won't be disappointed!

This recipe was a hit at our Octoberfest party. Everyone loved it and many wanted the recipe. I used 50% more cloves and Juniper berries than the recipe called for and it tasted great. Note to those tasting the finished product right after it was complete, I was unhappy with the way it tasted and was trying to figure out how to "fix" it. However, after it cooled and sat over night, it was absolutely fantastic!

Excellent red cabbage dish. I've used both olive oil and bacon fat in place of the vegetable oil. The bacon fat gave the dish a nice smoky taste. I left the cover on my skillet after adding the remaining ingredients to the onion and didn't need to add extra water. Both times, the dish got better as it sat in the refrigerator. It's good re-heated thoroughly and also just lukewarm.

It wasn't a bad recipe. quite tasty, but 6 servings!?! I would say at least 12. It made a lot. If I made it again, I would cut recipe in half!

I don't have tons of sauerkraut experience to use for comparison, but it was really tasty (the perfect mix of sweet and sour) and was well appreciated by the mouths it fed. Plus, it's a beauty to behold.

This is a surprizingly good recipe. I usually am not a fan of recipes with lots of onion but this is really good. It is also very good cold the next day. Even if you do not like sauerkraut, you will like this. It is great for Oktoberfest.
