Easy and delicious. Served with Ginger-Marinated Pork Tenderloin (from this site) and dijon-balsamic roasted carrots - the combination was fantastic. We will definitely be making again.

Such a simple way to dress up green beans -- love it! Left out the parsley, still tasted great. Next time I'd try crumbling or chopping the pine nuts to mix with the beans better.

A friend brought this to a Sunday dinner gathering and it was a huge favorite!!! She added crumbled Feta cheese and chopping the pine nuts is a very good idea...quite a keeper recipe.

Simple and delicious. Didn't add parsley as suggested by other reviewers and still tasted good. Also agree that pine nuts didn't "stick" to green beans well. Next time will try slivered almonds.

I found a good source for pine nuts there are American ORGANIC grown they are superb in-shell raw or shelled raw there web sight is www.wholesalepinenuts.com a simple comment to let you know you dont have to buy importer pine nuts any more. Mike

Simple and delicious. Personally, I prefer almonds instead of pine nuts, but it's yummy either way.

This is a regular at Thanksgiving for us, a contrast with all the heavy dishes.

This is a very tasty and elegant side fit for a special dinner with friends or any time. The directions were right on and this is so simple to make. The only problem I had was that the pine nuts fell to the bottom of the serving dish. Perhaps chopping them would help them cling to the beans better? Still deli!

Did not add parsley based on previous reviews. But it was so simple and easy for Thanksgiving. Nice to have a quick item that didn't require a lot of prep or oven time

Pine nuts are wonderful. Few things can beat something like roasted Pinon nuts in the winter. In Santa Fe the roasted pine nuts make the air extremely fragrant. Try not leaving them out.

I'm not a big green beans fan but this recipe showed me that green beans are delicious! I omitted the parsley based on previous reviews, and because someone didn't like pine nuts, kept those out, too (although the next time, I will include some for my portion of the dish). The lemon really brightens the green beans--literally and taste-wise. and I also sauteed some garlic because I love garlic. It was delicious. Delicious! Definitely a keeper in the recipe box.

Hey everyone, I agree the parsley does squat,but here's what I tried the second time. I have some dried french tarragon that I experimented with-crumbled it about 1/2 tsp in while sauteing and you'd be surprised how well it matches the lemon! Adds another bright element to the dish-never hurts to try those herbs you never use right?

I have made this recipe a couple of times and it is easy and delicious. I made it for a dinner party last summer and it seemed as if everyone enjoyed them.

Rating: 3
This was a nice alternative to the norm. I added the juice of 1/2 a lemon but otherwise followed the recipe. I agree with other reviewers that the parsley didn't really add anything to the recipe. We over-toasted the pine nuts which I think took away from the dish - I think I'll try this next time without toasting them.

Rating: 3
Easy and quick. The toasted pine nuts were yummy and the lemon zest, not too overpowering. Be careful when toasting the pine nuts, they can burn quickly.

These are very good, but better let sit overnight or another meal - I enjoyed them after the flavors had a chance to blend. I used the last picking of my vine grown beans.

For a green bean recipe, this is a really good one. Easy. Great flavors: lemony, nutty and fresh. I think it's my favorite green bean recipe so far.

Yum! Incredibly simple but quite tasty.

The recipe was good, but wasn't to me full of flavor or even company- worthy. I didn't put any parsley in it since many reviews said it wasn't particularly necessary, so I don't think that is the problem. This is the very first time that I based my choice of recipe on reviews and didn't agree with them. (Epicurious redeemed itself though with the fruit salad with ginger syrup that I made also. It was really wonderful...)

Rating: 4
super easy and really delicious. omitted the parsley as none was on hand. we ate it at room temp, as a salad-type side dish.

Rating: 4
Perfect blend of flavors. I sauteed the beans in a little bit of garlic oil before I added the other ingredients rather than tossing in olive oil. Just a personal preference. The lemon is subtle and the pine nuts are great. Not certain the parsley brings much to this dish.

I loved this. It made green beans exciting. It looked fancy but was so easy to make.

Rating: 3
My guests enjoyed, it was soooo easy to make and it was elegant on the table. The lemon zest was not a problem at all, I use a good quality zester and just put the yellow part, and it was very mild. Just the hint of lemon that it needed. Very good recipe for a luncheon!

I left the beans whole by accident but this was still fantastic. Easy and quick way to dress up plain jane beans. Got raves from guests.

I can't believe I am rating a green bean side dish as 4 forks! This was simple, easy to prepare, and delicious. I made the recipe to the letter, no changes. I think this is my new favorite way to prepare beans. For the reviewer who found the zest bitter, you may have accidently grated some of the pith (the white part) of the rind, which is bitter. Stick just to the yellow part.

Rating: 4
An excellent dish! So quick and easy but so tasty! I used a small amount of zest and added lemon juice (I sometimes find zest to be bitter) and it was great.

For something so simple, this is very flavorful. I even forgot the parsley. I made this for a dinner party and received a lot of compliments. Will certainly make again.

Yum! The pine nuts go from toasted to burning in a flash so hang out at the oven and as soon as you smell them, pull them out and place pan on a cooling rack.

In all honesty I'm not a huge green bean fan but was asked to make green beans for a picnic. I would definitely make this again. I think one of the keys is to leave a little crunch in the green beans.

I'm a displaced, born & raised New Mexican, and grew up eating Pinon (pine) nuts. This recipe took me home. I cannot overstate the importance of TOASTING the nuts you get from the store! Without toasting, they are pale, limp, and tasteless. Toast them, and they are a real treat. Add extra. You won't be sorry! Green Beans Almondine? Pah! For peasants!

Awsome. Perfect with grilled or baked fish and rice. Adds a new dimension to green beans.

This was OK. I'd make it again if there was a green-bean fan at the table. As it was, though, all the other food was eaten and these beans were left over. In other words, they were good for green beans but there's just so much you can do...

I added some lemon juice along with the zest and it was wonderful. Takes no longer than plain old beans but really gets the rave reviews.

I love these beans! My daughter made them for Easter and even the teenage boys were asking for seconds. I've made them since too many times to count and always to rave reviews. I don't measure the zest and parsley, just add to taste. The zester I have does a great job getting the zest just right and I think that makes the difference.

I used yellow wax beans and also added a little lemon juice and some finely minced garlic -- it came out great. Very light, well-balanced flavors. I will absolutely make this again and again.

Rating: 3
Very simple to make and simply delicious. Overall, a relatively bland taste, but very enjoyable (and would be great side to another main dish with more flavor). I prefer to cook the beans until just less than tendor, so they have a bit of crunch still. I also added a dash of lemon juice in addition to the lemon rind and it was wonderful - the perfect addition.

Rating: 3
GREAT recipe. So easy and light. It looks pretty on the table, and seems elegant, even though it's so simple. My "helper" accidentally toasted the pine nuts too much, and it was still delicious.

We really enjoyed this very simple side dish. I made a lemon vinaigrette with garlic and tossed that with the green beans and pine nuts. It was so easy to put together and much better than plain old green beans.

This combination of seasoning did not work at all for my family. I would not make this dish again.

This is very easy & tasty. I did as the Austin cook and used half reg olive oil and half Colavita Limonolio, a lemon flavored olive oil. I also squeezed a little fresh lemon juice over the finished dish. We really liked (I love pine nuts) this dish, as did our dinner guest, a very picky food snob who normally finds fault with everything. Thanks!

Extra tasty green beans. Made a few changes, used the beans uncut & toasted almond slivers instead of pine nuts. Everyone loved them & best of all, any leftovers are great in a salad.

This was pretty good but not fantastic. I agree with the previous reviewer that it was a bit bland, so I added half lemon oil and half olive oil. The lemon oil flavor went nicely with the toasted pine nut flavor. This recipe is a nice way to change up plain green beans.

I reduced the oil a bit and the dish was great. I served it at a dinner party and even the guests who don't like veggies much ate it happily. Re the comment below: I've found the prepackaged microwaveable beans to be very unreliable in quality, e.g. brown spots, rot, etc. It's safest, though more work, to stick with fresh picked beans.

Made this for Christmas Eve and it is the dish everyone wanted the recipe for! Cooked the beans well ahead of time and pulled them out and threw it in the skillet when I was almost ready to start serving dinner. Put in the zest, nuts and oil...forgot the parsley, but it wasn't missed. Great bean dish!

Lovely, simple dish. Flexible. I blanched the beans then tossed with zest and parsley, squeezed a bit of lemon juice over it, and served as a room temperature salad type of dish. I can see how this would be excellent warm as well. try varying the herb. I've made this with basil and it is very good.

After seeing all of the great reviews for this simple recipe, I thought I would try it. It certainly is easy, but it really wasn't that special. No raves at my table (but I guess at Thanksgiving, there are so many other decadent, yummy things on the table that this doesn't really stand out).

Excellent side dish -- the flavors are tasty and well-balanced, but they do not overpower the main dish. I used whole french green beans instead of cutting up larger ones but otherwise followed the recipe exactly (halved). My husband liked these so much he slurped up the last of them right out of the vegetable dish.

Mmm, good. Preferred it cold. Also, next time I think I'd double the lemon and add more pinenuts.

I made this recipe tonight for my husband and I. We absolutely loved it!!! It will definitley be in our rotation for vegetables. The contrast of the nutty toastiness of the pinenuts combined with the freshness of the lemon was divine. I would not change a thing! Right now my husband is sneaking the leftovers from the bowl!
