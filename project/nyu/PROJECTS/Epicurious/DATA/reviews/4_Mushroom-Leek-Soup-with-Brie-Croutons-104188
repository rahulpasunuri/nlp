Very good soup. I like my soup a little heartier. I did add a touch of thyme and so wish I had an immersion blender! I will make it again!

One of my absolute favourite soups. I (like others) use a hand-blender in the pot to smooth it out a bit. The flavour intensity of this soup is fantastic. The shiitake mushrooms are an absolute necessity here though, if you didn't include them, I can well imagine that the flavour would be lacking.

Excellent! I added 8 oz brie cheese to the soup. Makes this soup expensive but "over the top". I used assorted mushrooms, including one package of dried, of which I added the mushroom broth, after soaking to reconstitute. I put all of the soup in a blender. Then added some sauteed sliced baby Bella's for texture.The homemade croutons put in the broiler topped with the brie is heavenly.

I made this soup for a special dinner party. It was elegant, rich and delicious. I would definitely make it again. I made the recipe as written, except that I put in more sherry after I tasted the soup, because the two tablespoons called for in the recipe didn't bring out the flavor. I did not have to puree any of the soup. The chopped mushrooms and leeks gave it a lot of texture.

If the flavor was lacking for any of the other cooks preparing this recipe I am puzzled. The addition of some thyme, a squirt of lemon and a little more sherry than prescribed, plus using regular (not low sodium) organic pasture-raised chicken stock were my adaptatons. Therein, I suspect, is the lack of flavor. A low sodium stock just doesn't have the body. I, as others did, pureed about half the soup. Do make it the day or the morning before will fuse end intensify flavors. This is an elegant beautiful soup permanently ensconced in my repertoire. Served as a first course for a dinner party last night followed by salmon and some of the season's last sweet corn. Dinner, particularly the soupfour forks from all guests, some of them serious foodies.

This recipe did turn out bland as others have noted. There are other mushroom soup recipes that are better. I would add some herbs or spices to help make the soup pop.

This is the most amazing recipe. I used on 3/4 cup of cream and it was still amazing. I also used a hand blender on it. Finally, I topped it with a sprinkle of truffle salt - amazing!

I have always loved mushroom soup, but this recipe is without a doubt the best that I have ever eaten! I used only crimini mushrooms, and port because I did not have any sherry. I also used about 5 Tbl. instead of the 2 Tbl. that the recipe calls for. This is such a simple recipe to make. My family loved it and we cannot wait to have it again. Thanks to Peter Schott's; it's a shame that the restaraunt is no longer open.

I know readers like to change the original recipe, however, I made this as directed and it was a huge hit with my Book Club members. I'd make this again anytime.

I made it with portabellos only and found the soup only so-so. The flavors were ok but nothing outstanding, and the texture was not good. I think it would have improved a lot if you puree at least 3/4 of the soup.

Rating: 3
Outstanding soup recipe. As others mentioned, you certainly must puree a portion of the soup to give it body. I chose to use chantrelle and crimini mushrooms, and all our guests enjoyed the soup. For commercial service, the brie over crostini is easily baked while you dish the soup.

Rating: 4
Excellent soup, full of flavor. One of the best mushroom soups we've had. Used it as a meal alone. We used a mix of mushrooms; including portabella, brown, oyster, shitake, etc. and half and half. Didn't use the croutons, but am making it again tomorrow and will definately make the croutons and try the lemon juice 'to brighten it up'.

Rating: 1
I was looking forward to making this but I think it was not very interesting. I pureed 1/2 so it had a little body to it. I did not make the croutons...but with a soup the base is the main ingredient...not the garnish. Would go back to the roasted mushroom soup on this site instead. Won't make again

I've made this several times, and will make it again for New Years. I do puree some of the mixture, to thicken it. I also make it the day before, so the flavors have time to meld.

Likewise I used Chantrelles, shitakes, porcini and trumpets. I made a vegetable broth from the reamining leek ends, mushroom stems, a white onion, bay leaf, four cloves of garlic, and black pepper. Why waste the product? I also added minced garlic, finely chopped thyme, seeded and minced cerrano peppers, and thiny sliced roasted peppers. I know I am pushing the recipe in another direction, but the complement of color and mild spiciness picks up the flavor. Also squeeze a lemon into the mix towards the end of cooking should you entertain any of my modifications. I used half/half and supplemented the vegetable broth with a couple of low salt vegetable broth boullion cubes [Rapunzel Vegan No Salt Cubes] then added salt to taste. I am making this for an office luncheon and believe I have spent enough on fresh mushrooms, compared to the heinous starch-laden concoctions they will surely serve, so I elected not to serve brie. However, I chose a goat cheese spread on sour dough croutons. Too bad we cannot have wine at work!

This was nearly perfect. I tweaked a couple of things. I used a mix of chanterelles, cremini and shitake. I added a couple of cloves of minced garlic to the leek mixture as well as a bit of crumbled dried thyme. The consistency needed thickening so I partially pureed it, leaving many good "chunks" of mushrooms. It's really very good the following day as well. Will be making this again!

This soup was exactly what I was looking for. Next time I'll skip the croutons. They were good but not needed. I forgot the sherry. Also, I might add some fresh thyme. The best part, my kids loved it!

I am a Personal Chef and I made this soup for a dinner party and my guests just could not stop raving. It's such huge flavor for such simple ingredients. I add a BIG squeeze of lemon to the soup at the end of cooking and it really brightens up all the flavors. I will make this soup again and again.

I'm not afraid of fat but this was awfully rich - I served this in small portions before our meal and it was wonderful. I think the croutons really make the dish.

I made this recipe, adding a bit of fresh thyme, for a fall picnic, so didn't do the croutons. It was very good - will try the croutons next time when I make it at home.

This was a fantastic soup. I made it exactly as it was written. I know a lot of people like to cut down on the fat by using fat-free half and half, but if my theory is to splurge once in awhile........why substitute when you are only eating a small portion? You could not ask for anything better, even in a five-star restaurant. TRY IT!

Rating: 4
This dish was by far the best recipe I have found on the Epicurious site. Like one previous reviewer, I also used fat-free half and half. My husband and I absolutely loved it! He declared it "restaurant-quality." A new staple for our dinner parties, made even better without the guilt of the full-fat cream!

I made this soup for my mother's birthday and it was a hit with the mushroom lovers. I actually mixed it a little with another very similar recipe that I found from Sara Moulten. I used two chopped onions instead of the leeks, and did the individual bowls of soup baked in the oven with puff pastry tops. I probably added a dash more of sherry and a pich of crushed red pepper. I thought it had great flavor, and I know that I would love it with brie croutons.

We made this for Christmas last year and our guests requested it again. This soup is fantastic! I wasn't able to get crimini mushrooms at the store, so I used baby portobellos and I thought the soup had great flavor. I also used fat-free half and half and was very satisfied with the results. I am sure real cream would have been even better, but I was trying to be somewhat healthful and the soup was really excellent.

Rating: 4
Very good. Our guests ate it all, so we didn't get to try it the next day. I didn't use all of the butter, but next time I will use even less, as it looked a little greasy at the table. This is a great recipe that lends itself to all kinds of variation and substitution.

This was soooo yummy - especially on a chilly Bay Area Winter evening. I made it with 2% milk and used gorgonzola for the croutons since that's what we had on hand. This one goes in my permanent file...

We enjoyed it a lot, but it is a heavy soup and a super mushroom-y one at that. So if you're coming for a light flavor, this isn't going to get you there. Great body. :)

This was a wonderful soup....so rich and full of flavor...it was even better the next day. I think that it would work with different assortment of mushrooms if you can't find the required ones from the recipe! A real winner!

this is really yummy. i used a little less butter and about 1 1/2 cups of fat free half and half. i also added about 1/4 t of thyme and used one can of roasted garlic flavored chicken broth (these were the only ingredients i had in my house). i blended it a bit with a stick blender to make it a little thicker. next time will follow the recipe exactly, but it was delicious this way.

We have made this soup several times since the recipe was published. We often have it as our main course with a salad on the side. We have tried several mushroom soups over the past two years and this is definitely my favorite. We haven't made many adjustments to the recipe which is great as it is but we also found substituting ingredients if necessary works fine. So far everyone we have served it to has raved about it.

We found this soup to be elegant and delicious--the only change I made was to reduce 1 1/2 cups of cream slightly first, liking it a bit thicker. Used 3 kinds of mushrooms in the soup and made the brie croutons separately and served on the side. Absolutely wonderful!

I loved this soup. I made it on a Friday and made another batch the following Monday. Took some to my father, who is a soup expert and he loved it. For convenience I toasted the croutons and melted the cheese on them at home and when I served it placed the croutons on the bottom of the bowl and covered with the hot soup. Delicious! I used half and half but for an upcoming dinner party will go for the whipped cream.

Very easy to make and always a big hit. I must admit I leave out the croutons, and still love this soup. I sometimes blend with my hand-held to change the consistancy, but leaving the mushrooms sliced is also great.

Very, very good! Make sure that during the last step (while broiling the soup with croutons) that the croutons are fully wet so as not to burn the tips of these tasty morsels. This recipe as well as the Epicurious 'Mixed Mushroom' soup are top notch! Really, unbelievably good!

I hate cream of mushroom soup, but I loved this! I didn't make the croutons, but I'll try them next time. I made lots of substitutions, based on what was in the fridge: 2 leeks + 1 onion and 1 shallot, button mushrooms, parsley instead of green onions, less butter and cream, and I added a handful of dried mixed mushrooms. I also pureed half the batch to make it a bit smoother - I suggest trying this.

This is an excellent soup. I have made it for the past few thanksgivings and it is always a favorite. This year I used a variety of mushrooms--shiitake, portobello, hedgehog, oyster-- and it turned out very well. I would suggest making a homemade broth to enhance the flavor.

I have cooked this recipe many times and always to rave reviews. The elegance of the addition of the Brie croutons is a keeper. I have used a variety of mushrooms and it always comes out great. I have even added 2 pre boiled Idaho potatoes for a little extra body. With or without the potatoes this is a wonderful recipe!

Amazingly simple and delicious! I will use this recipe for many years! I lightened it up a tiny bit by cutting back on the butter slightly and using half and half rather than heavy cream. don't forget the brie toasts.

I used morel mushrooms because I couldn't find crimini, and I used fewer leeks (about 1 cup). The brie croutons were unremarkable, but the soup was fantastic. I did add more broth, and it turned out wonderfully!

I just tried this recipe out in hopes of using it with Christmas dinner. My family was around for a taste, and let me add they are picky and traditional and they went nuts!! THIS SOUP IS FANTASTIC!!! Extremely simple to make and the croutons just give it a little extra umph!! The only thing I did differently was add 1 cup more chicken broth cause I found it a tad too thick and I eliminated the green onions and simply added a sprinkle of chives. I couldn't find any Crimini mushrooms so I substituted with button mushrooms as did another reviewer and it was just fine. I look forward to serving this to my Christmas Eve dinner guests.

WOW! This is an excellent recipe! I followed to the t(spoon) with the exception of adding a cup and a half more broth (wanted a bigger batch). It was sooooo good!

What a wonderful soup! Velvety and flavorful. I made a few changes, adding 8oz. button mushrooms and about half a teaspoon of thyme to give it a little more flavor, and substituting Swiss cheese for the brie, which my husband can't stand. But the result was fantastic. Highly recommended.
