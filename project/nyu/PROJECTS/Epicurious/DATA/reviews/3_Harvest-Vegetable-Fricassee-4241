A delicious way to serve root veggies! I took another user's suggestion of pre-roasting the parsnips and they came out with a wonderful, nutty flavour. I also used red beets instead of carrots and rutabaga (swede) instead of turnips. I think this would work with virtually any type of root vegetable.

Sweet, savory, homey - perfect for a chilly fall evening.

I served this as the main course last night and we loved it. I used 2 large yellow turnips in place of the parsnips and it turned out delicious. Just be sure to start the turnips 2-3 minutes before you add the rest of the vegetables to the pan, as they take a bit longer to cook.

If you think you don't like parsnips, try sauteing them in a bit of olive oli before adding to the mix, or try them oven roasted......they have a whole new sweet nutty taste.

This isn't what I'd call a "unique" recipe by any means, but basic, wholesome, and very flexible. If you don't care for parsnips, try substituting rutabaga (swede), or yams/sweet potatoes, or white potatoes. We can't always find squash (living in the UK now), but rutabagas are everywhere. I suppose even turnips would work, but we aren't crazy about those either - anybody try turnips in this dish? p.s. And I threw a tablespoon of honey in once, too. That was tasty, tho upping the calorie count a bit!

I liked it all except the parsnips. I've tried to like them, but can't! Any suggestions for substitues would be welcome. Other than that, I thought it was good and will make again, probably with more taters.

If you want omega 3, buy golden flax seed, keep it in the frig, have a little coffee grinder (that you use for nothing else) handy on the cupboard, and grind a tablespoon every morning. Throw it on your cereal or mix it in cottage cheese or whatever, and you will improve your "heart health" 100%

I loved the combination of parsnips, carrots, and butternut squash. I added some potato to even out the sweetness, and it was terrific. I have heard olive oil is a good source of omega 3's and that omega 6's are found in abundance in other plant oils. Fat is not the enemy, check out the revisions suggested to the food pyramid with a search query on www.google.com. =) happy cooking!

We made this dish with only olive oil and browned the flour quite a bit to give it a carmel taste. It was slightly sweet and very tasty. Plan to make it again for Thanksgiving Day!

I have to slightly disagree with the first Weymouth cook. That this main dish is so loaded with veggies is wonderful, of course, but you won't be getting many omega-3's from this. For one, olive oil is pretty low in omega-3's; further, omega-3's are an unstable fat that breaks down into a far less beneficial fat when cooked. Try hemp seed oil or, less preferably, flax seed oil drizzled over top after cooking. If you want hemp seed oil (one of the very few vegetarian sources of omega-6), you better buy it soon, because the DEA is trying to ban all hemp comestibles, among other hemp products. :( Happy eating!

We did like this and I would definitely make this again but probably as a side dish...I guess I sound like a hopeless carnivore but I usually enjoy vegetarian dinners at least once a week. Too much starchy texture to be a meal in itself. I did top with mashed potatoes and put it under a broiler for a few minutes. It was great tasting and if it had some different textures, I would have rated it 3 or 4 forks!

I thought that this was just delicious and so easy to make. Contrary to what previous reviewer wrote, 9 grams of fat per main entree serving is not too much at all. Eating only non fat food is what's not healthy - we all need some fat in our diets - it serves an important purpose! Even if you want to cut down on the amount of animal fat you eat, one tablespoon of butter divided between four servings is less than a teaspoon each! And olive oil has so many health benefits - omega 3 fatty acids are great for us - we should be eating more! So please go for this recipe. Most of us need more vegetables in our diets and this is a delicious way to get them!

I actually cover this recipe with a layer of mashed potatoes and have a vegetarian shepherds pie. It is the ultimate winter comfort food.
