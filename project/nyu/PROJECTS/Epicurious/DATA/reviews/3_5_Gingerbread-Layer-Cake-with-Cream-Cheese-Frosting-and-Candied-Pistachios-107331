This cake was a big hit at a holiday party. I used dark molasses. I wonder if light molasses would have made a difference. I think I will add a little more confectioner's sugar to the frosting the next time to make it a little sweeter.

I made a variation of this for someone's birthday cake and made a few adjustments upon request. She doesn't drink at all, so I used coffee in place of the Guinness, and I left out the fresh ginger as she was afraid it would be too much. I also substituted an Irish Creme Buttercream Frosting from a carrot cake recipe here, using my home-made, non-alcoholic Irish creme, of course. The cake was wonderful, very rich, moist and deeply complex with the spices. The coffee simply added a richness to the cake and didn't overpower anything. I didn't miss the fresh ginger, but could see that it would bring some more fire and bite to the party. I baked four slightly thinner layers (using an extra egg for structure) so that I'd have an extra layer to trial frosting flavours with. I used regular cake pans, buttered, parchment papered, and dusted with confectioners (icing) sugar, no sticky problems. I did level the layers by slicing about a quarter inch off the tops so as to have a perfect cake for presentation at her birthday dinner. In fact, it looked so good that the maitre d' offered me a job in the kitchen. As the birthday girl's mother had a candle for the top, I left it plain (palette knifed parallel channels) and rolled the sides of the cake in the candied pistachios. Be warned, my first batch of nuts went brown in the oven very quickly, the second try were pulverised to pistachio powder when I tried chopping them in a nut grinder. All in all a fantastic combination.

The cake was fantastic and the icing was great! Just not together. The icing is really flavorful but drowns out the taste of the gingerbread cake. I was not going to do the roasted pistachios but I am glad I did. They made the icing. I think that the icing should be on a plain cake, like chocolate. The gingerbread cake is so delicious only a sprinkle of powdered sugar is needed.

Everything I could ask for in a cake! My husband and I love gingerbread, Guinness, and cake! Followed the directions exactly (well, only 2 substitutions) and didn't encounter any problems. Forgot to buy fresh ginger so I substituted crystallized ginger and doubled the amount which added a tiny bit of extra spice and texture to this light and fluffy cake. I prefer lemon over orange zest for the frosting. Uneven layers are inevitable when trying to fit 3 cake pans in an average oven, so very carefully give your cake pans a 180* turn halfway thru baking. It was a perfect dessert for Christmas Eve and it was even better the second day!

The center did fall on my cakes and they broke a bit when I took them out of the pans, but the frosting is thick so I was able to glue everything back together. I served this at the restaurant where I work and it sold out. Huge hit!

Whenever I make layer cakes they look funny and lopsided. The chocolate panna cotta cake is different, but this cake isn't. Putting the pistachios on top helps detract from the lopsidedness, but it doesn't look like a professional made it. Alas. Otherwise the cake was really yummy. I might make it as cupcakes and pipe the frosting on however. It'll just look nicer.

Rating: 3
i made this over the holidays. the gingerbread taste was spicy and rich which i loved, but my cakes fell in the center too (like other reviewers said) so the layered cake had a bit of an uneven, sunken appearance. also, i like lots of frosting and i felt the recipe was a little skimpy so i would increase the amount if you want to be generous. i agree, don't skip the pistachios they are perfect with the cream cheese/gingerbread combo.

I made this cake just because I'd never seen one with beer in in before. It has such a deep and interesting molasses flavor. I mixed whipped cream into the cream cheese frosting to make it a little lighter. Otherwise the cream cheese taste can overpower the molasses flavors.

I grated most of an orange and used all of it in the frosting, which I thought added to the frosting's flavor, but I found the consistency of the frosting quite gluey. Others really liked the cake, however, so it may be a personal preference.

I was a little dubious about making this cake for our family Christmas party as it had a few very negative reviews. I'm glad I took the chance because this was an excellent dessert and enjoyed by all. Great ginger flavor, nice moist cake and very pretty. I made a half recipe of the icing and then folded in about a cup of whipped cream. I used 9 inch pans (three) and the layers were just right and needed only the 25 minutes called for.

One word. WOW. This cake is DELICIOUS!! I served this at a dinner party and crossed my fingers that everyone liked gingerbread. It was a HUGE hit. It's being added to my holiday repertoire. A few comments on the recipe. First, I used 9" pans and added an egg (per the comments that the cake fell). It held it's shape pretty well - compressed slightly in the middle. However, the cook time was closer to 35-40 minutes rather than 25. I also added the 1/2 c. sugar to the frosting. Everything was excellent. I highly recommend this recipe, and as another reviewer posted, do not cut the pistachios. Everything works so well together. DELISH!

To Lawrence, KS. I've made this recipe many times-- it's a favorite of mine. I've always used regular (dark) molasses, it seems easier to find than light. But in the past I've also changed the beer from Guinness to Sam Smith Nut Brown Ale, which is a bit lighter, and light brown sugar (because it's what I have on hand). I've found it turns out wonderfully still-- perhaps the change in ingredients evens out over the long run.

Wonderful, festive and delicious. I've made this several times and it's always been a hit. I actually make MORE of the candied pistachios and give them in jars as gifts!

Presented beautifully and came out moist, dark, and well-balanced in terms of spicy and sweet. The candied pistachios really added something special, so dont omit them! Although I thought it was a baking success, probably wont make again because I brought home about ¼ of the cake from the office holiday party, and thats unusual. Maybe just not a particularly popular flavor.

Just made this cake for Thanksgiving dessert. It was amazing! Everyone kept talking about how good it was. Super easy to make, and has a great spice that goes well with the cream cheese. I was afraid of the frosting overpowering the cake, so I used someone else's suggestion and added an additional half cup of powdered sugar to the recipe. It came out perfect, not too sweet and not too cream cheesy. I will make this cake a tradition!

Great cake for the holidays. I made these into cupcakes for a Thanksgiving dessert buffet. The contrast of colors from dark cake, creamy frosting and the green candied pistachios makes a great presentation. The cake itself is moist and has a nice ginger flavor. Frosting is wonderful, however the frosting overpowers the cake. If you enjoy gingerbread then you may want to pair this cake with another less dominant topping or use the frosting sparingly. Overall, I will use these 3 recipes again, just not necessarily together as you lose the gingerbread to the frosting.

i used this recipe to make cupcakes and like some of the other reviewers i had trouble with the middles not rising. i cooked regular sized cupcakes for 20 minutes and the middles still stayed flat to concave. i sprayed the muffin tins heavily with cooking spray (Pam) and they popped out fine. the flavor is great and i like the crispy edges. i am trying to replicate a dessert i had at a restaurant recently that was a warm stout molasses cake with butterscotch drizzled over and sea salt sprinkled on top. this could work...

This recipe was a HUGE, HUGE hit this Thanksgiving. The orange cream cheese nicely complimented the gingerbread cake. It was a wonderful alternative to "traditional" holiday desserts. I changed the presentation slightly--instead of a layer cake, I made cupcakes, due to the large number of guest I hosted. The recipe yields 24 cupcake. I chose to pipe the icing, so there was a lot left-over. Next time, I'll half the icing recipe. Also, I used another reviewer's advice to spray a non-stick baking spray in the baking cups or my guests might have enjoyed an additional ingredient--paper. If you're craving to make something new for the holidays--then look no further!

This is Delicious! SO Moist and yummy! I read that you aer suppossed to comment on the recipe as written, but I had to make some changes to accomodate what I had so here is what I did: I only had blackstrap molasses and I couldn't find a mild one, so I added and extra egg s that it wouldn't fall. I also made a two layer 10" cake b/c that was the size pan I had. I also used lemon instead of orange for the icing. I just love lemon. And this cake does STICK! I lined my pan with wax paper and buttered the was paper, and it barely came free without a mess. I highly reccomend it. I will definitely mak this again!

This has become a standard at my Thanksgiving dinners. I think gingerbread purists might object to the frosting, but I'm always struck by how good it is with its hint of citrus. It's a beautiful, delicious cake. To the reviewer (Kelli) who didn't like this recipe because she doesn't like the combination of ginger and sweet: then why the f*** did you decide to make a gingerbread cake?! What were you expecting?

I have tried many gingerbread recipes and this was, by far, the best one I've ever made. I was a little leary of how the strong stout flavor would affect the taste of the cake, but once it was cooked, it wasn't recognizable. I recommend using silicone or parchment pan liners as this cake STICKS to the pan.

I made this for Christmas Dinner. It got rave reviews. Everyone from the 80 year olds to the 18 month olds loved it. I baked it in a bundt pan and it turned out great. I took other reviewers advice and served it with whipped cream/orange zest rather than icing. This was just the right touch with the strong flavor of the cake.

I've made this recipe at least 3 times. It's a favorite recipe with friends and family. Just a note, I could only find dark molasses, so it was very moist and unable to hold the shape of the cake pan - so I made it into a triffle! This is a winner!!!!

People might be interested to know that this recipe appears on this site three times (with a couple of very slight variations). The recipe is from pastry chef Claudia Fleming and is called Gingerbread Layer Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting and Candied Pistachios, Guinness Stout Ginger Cake, and Gramercy Tavern Gingerbread. Two include fresh ginger, one has more sugar and cinnamon, and one has a little more baking soda, but otherwise they're the same. Anyway, it's my absolute favorite dessert of all time, served with just some whipped cream. Incredible.

My friends and I made this for Thanksgiving a few years ago as a pumpkin alternative and it became an instant hit. We've made it every Thanksgiving since. If I had to be perfectly honest, the cake doesn't come out as nicely as I'd like (it seems a little greasy), but the combination of flavors in this recipe makes it all good.

I made this cake a year ago for an annual tea party, but I'm reviewing it now because a few days before this year's party, one of my guests asked, "Are you going to make that gingerbread thing with the cream cheese frosting and the pistachios again?" She was practically drooling right there in front of me. This is at a party where there are six to eight desserts, mind you, and she's been coming to it for about fifteen years. So I guess some people really like it a lot. (And the reviewer below who threw the cake out without serving it _or even tasting it_ is a moron. No two ways about it.) Me, I like any kind of gingerbread--the hotter, the better--and I loved the candied pistachios, but I found the frosting a little strong. I think I'd have preferred a vanilla buttercream, or something else without that cheesy tang.

Oh Yeah - this is the one. If you *like* ginger and strong flavors you'll love this cake. People who weren't fond of ginger thought there was too much of it in there, but I wasn't able to discern the ginger from the overall taste of the gingerbread, which was quite strong. The combination of the stout in the batter, the orange zest in the frosting (which was fabulous) and the crunchy pistachios was beyond heaven. I'm going to save the cake recipe and throw wild blueberries in it in the summer time - skipping the frosting. I can't wait for that. One word of warning - boil the stout and the molasses in a much larger pan than you think is necessary. When I added the baking soday it foamed something awful. It was pretty funny and we had a family science lesson.

This one a huge hit. Everyone who came to my house for Thanksgiving wanted the recipe. None of the other deserts got eaten. The recipe turned out terrific!!

Delicious! We made this cake for Christmas dinner, and it was a huge hit. The molasses and stout give depth to the cake's flavor, and the crunchy candied pistachios give provide a great contrast to the creamy frosting. But eat it up the day you make it: the cake doesn't age well.

Made this cake for Thanksgiving this year and everyone thought it looked great especially with the candied pistachios on top. The cake was very moist and had great flavor, however the cream cheese frosting was too rich and defenitely very overpowering. Will try a simple Whipped Cream Frosting next time. The cake by itself is probably very good, too - maybe even baked in a muffin pan.

I made this cake for Thanksgiving this year. It was definitely a success - mostly due to the cake's presentation and the gingerbread's depth of flavor. The only problem I had - the cakes fell a bit in the middle, which caused the lines of filling to appear bowed when served.

The first time I make a cake, I follow the recipe. However, it was clear that this recipe has some issues. They were pretty easy to solve, so I'll make this cake again. I solved the dome problem by using 9 inch pans. They work better for me than 8 inch pans. After reading many other recipes and comments here, I added another 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to the frosting. That way the cream cheese taste wasn't so strong, and the frosting isn't too sweet.

I made this for Thanksgiving. It was incredible! The Guinness added a wonderful depth of flavor, and the candied pistachios were a delightful finishing touch. It takes a little bit of effort, but it's well worth the end result both in taste, and in the awe you'll inspire by making this recipe. A definite "thumbs up"!!

I read the reviews before making this cake and was surprised at the number of people that said the cake did not have much ginger flavor. The recipe has 2 tablespoons ground ginger and 1 tablespoon minced ginger root and that is a lot of ginger. I found the cake to have a lot of ginger flavor. However, the cream cheese flavor somewhat overpowers it when the cake is put together. I found the second day though, once the cake was thoroughly chilled and flavors had mingled, that the cream cheese was not so overpowering. I liked the candied pistachios as a special touch for the cake. I will make the cake again, but I would like to use a frosting with subtler flavor. I am not sure what the appropriate frosting would be and would be interested to hear of any other frosting used with this recipe.

I made this cake for Christmas. It was delicious! Everyone loved it. I made the candied pistachios a day ahead and kept them in an airtight container overnight. I put them on the cake the day the cake was served and did not have a problem with sogginess. I put the nuts on the sides of the cake and garnished the top with fresh raspberries along the outer rim not for flavor but to make it look more festive & "Christmas-like". It looked wonderful. People were taking pictures of it. Tasted great, too.

The flavor of this cake was very good. My husband would probably give it four forks. I did find that the nuts placed on the cake one day before serving it became soft. Next time, I would wait to put the nuts until the day I served the cake. I used two 9 inch pans, because my oven will not fit three of any sized pan. The cake rose beautifully, but then fell. I've never had trouble with any other kind of cake, but gingerbread gives me trouble. Does anyone have any helpful hints? Luckily, the frosting covered everything and it looked beautiful.

I didn't make this cake but I wanted to make a clarification about what April wrote. She said she was frustrated that people rated their own modified recipes and didn't rate the actual recipes. I agree with her. I like to read how people like the recipe as written, and only then do I like to hear how they modified it. I'm not against modifying recipes at all. I do it all the time. If one rated recipes based on one's own modifications, however, then one doesn't get a clear idea of how the written recipe turns out, only of how the modified one turns out.

The cake itself has a wonderful moist taste, but the three layers of frosting and the candied pistachios are distracting and take away from the flavor. If I were to make it again, and I'm not, I would make it a sheet cake and serve some lemon sauce or hard sauce on the side.

This cake was fun to make and had such an interesting list of ingredients. However, I felt it had an overwhelming taste of ginger, and if I hadn't been so focused on making it exactly according to directions, I'd have cut the ginger content by two thirds. TWO TABLESPOONS of ground ginger?! A WHOLE TABLESPOON of minced fresh ginger?! My sinuses were clear from my winter cold, that's for sure! I would also recommend a simple dark beer if you're not a fan of Guiness stout (which I'm not) in the first place. You could certainly taste the stout in this recipe. Last but not least, DEFINITELY go with a milder molasses. All I had was blackstrap, and since I was making this on Christmas Day, I couldn't run to the store for the milder form.

To Rebecca and other cooks who 'experiement' - please don't stop! It is always interesting to learn from others - especially improvisations to the stated recipe.

Note to April and other strict constructionists of recipes: One of the purposes of the review option is, as stated on the site, to provide "a great way to pass on cooking hints, recommend ingredient substitutions, and offer serving suggestions." I find the substitutions and suggestions made by reviewers to be one of the more interesting aspects of the reviews. You can get some geat ideas of how to make some recipes better and learn what not to do. Improvising is one of the joys of cooking, and the personal touches are what make a recipe your own. I did substitute orange juice in the frosting in place of orange rind, but I thought the frosting was fine. My poor review was of the cake itself, and I made no changes in the ingredients. Sorry if this post offends anyone, but I posted it after reading the comments by April and similar comments in reviews of other recipes.

Although I only had two cake pans and my oven tends to burn the edges of anything facing the rear wall, I'd still say this cake came out quite delicious. I thought it would be dry, but was not at all. The beer/soda reaction was pretty stinky, but I think it added considerably to the awesome flavor of the cake. Now, I guess I'll have to buy a 3rd pan for the next time I make it, so it won't be so domed on top.

Everyone raved about this delicious cake! Having only one 8oz cream cheese on hand, I folded whipped heavy cream in with half of the frosting recipe, which was quite good. Following one person's advice, I used two 8" cake pans instead of three, but the layers turned out too thick and very domed, so I split each layer. The cake was too tall for the diameter, though, so next time, I'll use three pans - and there will definately be a next time!

Cake was delicious, simple to make and assemble ahead It's a perfect Thanksgiving dessert, not too sweet but flavourful enough to hold its own. My only criticism/warning to others - when you mix baking soda with the beer and molasses, the chemical reaction causes it to profusely bubble up, in my case all over the stove...so use a very large pot!

A big hit. Everyone at the dinner table asked for the recipe. I made it in one layer using a springform pan and served it plain, topped with a mixture of marscapone cheese & creme fraiche.

Great tasting cake. Very moist. Guests loved the candied pistachios. Layers were thin. Next time I may make only two 8 inch layers (layers were so thin there is no way overflow would be a problem) and add nuts between the layers as well. I did not using the frosting recipe but used the one from Joy of Cooking instead.
