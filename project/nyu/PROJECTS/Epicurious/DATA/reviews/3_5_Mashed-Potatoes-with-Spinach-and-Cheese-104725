In one word, YUMMY! I made this recipe, as a side dish to the Braised Meatballs in Red- Wine Gravy on this site. Both recipes were fantastic, and went together so well. My husband is rather a minimalist when it comes to potatoes, however he raved thru dinner about this recipe for mashed potatoes. This is definitely a keeper recipe. I highly suggest this recipe paired with the Braised Meatballs in Red-Wine Gravy on this site. They are fabulous together.

I love this dish. Since discovering it, I hardly make plain mashed potatoes anymore. I often add cheddar, since that seems to be what I have in the fridge most of the time.

Lovely mashed potatoes! I found that I could decrease the amount of cheese and spinach (because I didn't have the proper amount on hand) and the dish still was extremely tasty!

These were good, but not as fantastic as I thought they'd be with all the gruyere, butter, and spinach. I think they were just way richer than I'm used to, but these taters combined with the Braised Meatballs in Wine Gravy were very impressive.

Made some changes to the recipe, but loved the final outcome. I used one pkg of frozen spinach, added a bunch of sauteed green onions and used a combo of buttermilk and chicken stock to mash the potatoes....everyone at dinner loved them! Will definitely make these again.

I read the recipe wrong and only added 1 bag of spinach - thought it was perfect amount. Also, instead of warm milk I use chicken or beef stock, makes much creamier potatoes rather than pasty. Unbelievable with the braised meatballs in red wine gravy. A crowd pleaser for sure!!

I used fontina and brie in the potatoes.it was wonderful with braised meatballs in red-wine gravy.yum....

Very good, used fontina, added spinach till it looked about right- used much less than recommended. I liked this very much and will make again, subtle flavors but not boring.

This was pretty good, but not great. It is, however, a nice way to combine two vegetables.

It was wonderful, I love spinach and potatoes, however I did cheat and added some garlic as well!

Tastes like mashed potatoes and spinach -- nothing more, nothing less. Boring.

Rating: 2
I have to admit I just took the idea and didn't follow the amounts accurately but have to say this was much blander than I expected and fell way below my expectations. I'll give it another go but intend to try it with blue cheese next time.

I'm glad I took everyone's advice to use less spinach. I can't imagine using the amount called for here-- it would have totally overwhelmed the dish. I also did not precook the spinach; the heat from the potatoes wilts it just enough. Gruyere tasted fabulous, but I wish the flavor came through a little more. Perhaps I will increase the amount next time around. Overall, a yummy dish to serve with the accompanying Braised Meatballs.

This is excellent and everyone loved it, although I have not tried it on children yet. I agree less spinach is better. I also used red potatoes, because they are so naturally buttery that I only need to add a couple of tablespoons of butter. I also used non-fat milk and only a light sprinkling of cheddar cheese. This makes a healthful and hearty dish which I will serve again and again.

I loved this recipe - I made it with unpeeled red potatoes and it was OUTSTANDING!! DO NOT cook the spinach - just fold into the hot smashed/mashed potatoes....

This recipe got it on the texture scale. If you're stuck having to please a potato lover with mashed potatoes all the time, make this one, it's a whole new dish. Good way to slip the iron in there too!

I served this tonight at a dinner party and everyone loved it! I used one bag of spinach, added it raw to the mashed potatoes, put in a baking dish and topped with shredded gruyere cheese. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes. This will be a part of our Thanksgiving dinner this year. Wonderful!

Haven't made this one yet, but it's very similar to one I've made for years (and my mother before me). I use kale in mine. Just chop it, and add it to the potatoes while boiling (necessary with kale, as it's somewhat tougher than spinach). I'll try that with cheese as well, it sounds great. I serve it with sausage, as did my mother.

A staple in our house. I use all the spinach recommended, but agree with not cooking it beforehand. Especially tasty with the recommended braised meatballs in red-wine gravy. Also very tasty the next day.

I needed to use the rest of a 10 oz bag of spinach and came across this recipe. I was happy for the suggestion of NOT cooking the spinach first. After combining all of the ingredients, I realized my chicken breast were not quite done... so I put the potatoes in a small casserole, spinkled cheese on top and put it into the oven w/the chicken. In about 10 minutes, the cheese had melted and my chicken was done! PERFECT! (I used one of those shredded cheese blends.)

I used one 10 oz. bag of spinach and thought that it was plenty. I also recommend not cooking the spinach first, but be sure to add it while the potatoes are still really hot and let it sit for a while.Can't wait to make this again! Any suggestions for other cheeses to use?

Everyone loved these potatoes! If you like cheese, keep the amount suggested. I only used about 10 OZ of spinach, and I also did not cook it prior to adding them to the potatoes. I added white pepper, which I do to all mashed potatoes. I will definately make again!

This is phenomenal and a staple on our table in winter. I use unpeeled Yukon Gold potatoes and mash with skins. I also use fontina cheese and DON'T pre-cook the spinach. This is a delicious and filling comfort food. I usually serve it with roasted pork. My husband (a native of Holland)loves this dish; it's almost just like his mom used to make.

I discovered this recipe right in the magazine and have made it over and over to great aclaim. I have tried variations but always come back to the basic recipe.

This recipe would be just fabulous with any other kind of cheese. Be prepared for a rather unpleasant odor as you open the package of Gruyere. I will make it again, with anything but Gruyere.

This was a very good alternative to traditional mashed potatoes. I used only about 8-10 ozs. of spinach and 3 cups of gruyere, and it seemed to be the perfect combo. I couldn't imagine using all the spinach called for. I also took other's suggestions and did not steam the spinach first... just mixed it in fresh w/ the mashed potatoes and it wilted perfectly. Guests were impressed. I served it with my favorite Epicurious Marinated London Broil (1994). YUM!

This has become our favorite way to make potatoes. We have experimented with about four different cheeses (brie, camembert, gruyere, and one other goat cheese) and have been pleased with all of the outcomes! As far as the amount of spinach goes, we have found that it really works with any amount (do you want potatoes with spinach or spinach with potatoes?). Yum, yum.

Like another reviewer, I didn't cook the spinach first.. I never would have thought of this until I had the trout at Daily Grill, with spinach mashed potatos on the side.. excellent! The hot mashed potatos will cook the spinach just enough to not be mushy. Use less cheese!! great recipe, I make this once a week at a minimum

I used all the spinach recommended which was way too much. I think 2 bags would have been plenty. I drained the spinach, but did not pat it dry and found that the texture was fine. They have great flavor.

These were yummy! I didn't use the exact proportions listed. Just make them and add the other stuff to your liking. You wont be disappointed. It's a wonderful flavor and texture.

What a great recipe. I made it with only 1 bag of spinach and double the cheese and it turned out perfectly.

These were suprisingly good! I only used one bag of baby spinach though and thought it was plenty. I've also used grated romano cheese because that was what I had, and it was great. A good way to "sneak" spinach to my kid's too! Will be doing often!

Great recipe! For 2 people I used one 6 oz. bag of baby spinach and did not chop it; 1-1/4# Yukon Gold potatoes; 1 cup Gruyere; & 2-1/2 T butter which is approximately 1/3. I steamed the spinach and then absorbed excess moisture with paper towels. This is a generous recipe - we have leftovers. Can't wait to try it out on company.

Great recipe!! Used only half the spinach and all the cheese and everyone wanted the recipe. A definite keeper and perfect alternative when you want a change from garlic mashed potatoes!

Found this recipe easy to make with a nice change from your day-to-day mashed potatoes. Received rave reviews.

Yum! I used only one bag of baby spinach, chopped it and did not cook it first - it softens fine in the hot mashed potatoes. I also only used 2 cups of cheese, which was more than enough. Great variation on mashed potatoes and attractive.

This is really nice for those times when mashed potatoes would be nice, but for some reason garlic mashed (everyone's favorite) won't do. The proportions are a little off, though. I cut this recipe in half for two people and only needed ONE 5-oz. bag of spinach. A little spinach reallly goes a long way. Plus, you will want to chop the spinach, which is not mentioned in the directions. Also, I would say there is too much cheese called for. Add about half of it, and see if you want to add more. All in all a colorful and simple addition to a plate.
