I made this tonight with skinless, boneless chicken breasts and it was delicious. My husband announced it was "a keeper"! I reduced the cooking time to 5 minutes and the braising time to 15. We love the sauce and think it would be great on pork chops too.

After the mixed reviews, I have to chime in to say this was delicious. I used the wine and cider to scrape up thebrown bits after I discarded the oil and threw in some shallots as well. Heavy cream is a must if you don't want it to curdle. If you're looking to trim the fat, I've also used evaporated milk in similar recipes with good results. You just may need to add a slurry to achieve the proper consistency.

This has been a fool-proof recipe for making a really tender, subtly flavored chicken. We have made this often, exactly as the recipe states, for years now. We serve over rice with steamed veggies - fabulous!

My BF whipped this up for Sunday dinner complete with jasmine rice and steamed green beans. It was simple and delicious. He no issues with curdling at all, although it does take a while to reduce the braising liquid at the end. I'm tempted to add a bit more sage, and perhaps a few cubed apples the next time we make this. The cream is too luxurious for everyday eating, but for an occasional treat on a cold wet evening it's very comforting.

So simple, but so incredibly delicious. We make this about once a month, but worth of once a week!

Truly disgusting.

Feh. Of COURSE the sauce is going to turn to a form of thin, curdy buttermilk. VERY unappealing.

I couldn't give this recipe even 1 fork. Even with the addition of sauteed onion, this is one cream sauce definitely not worth the calories.

Simple, fast, delicious, even with previously-frozen chicken. Made it to save time, but really something special. Use good bread or mashed potatoes for the sauce.

Excellent, but messy. Brown the chicken outside if you have that opton.

All I can say is meh. This tasted like chicken, sauteed in olive oil. The sauce was thin, the flavor bland. I won't make this again.

I prepared the chicken differently by using boneless, skinless thighs. I pounded them thinly and then dredged in flour and egg and fried them. In the meantime, I prepared the sauce as directed and added the chicken to heat through at the end. Delicious!!!

Delicious! I served this with garlic mashed potatoes and haricot vert. My family loved it. I can't wait to make this again!

Easy and delicious. I sauteed onions and chanterelle mushrooms and added them when I braised the chicken. Divine!

This dish was simple and tasty -- good for a weeknight. It wasn't spectacular, though, and I'll probably only make it again if I have the ingredients on hand. It wasn't worth a special trip to buy cider, cream, and fresh sage. I think the addition of salt or bouillon would have been good. If I make it again, I'll season it more heavily. Also wish there were more cider flavor.

So, I'm not a meat eater, but had guests over that are. Thought this recipe looked easy and tasty. Not so. I'm not sure went wrong, but the sauce turned out looking and tasting like peanut butter. Not edible.

This is a fantastic recipe. I added ~1/2 cup of finely chopped shallots with the sauce ingredients, which really complimented the dish. Served with jasmine rice, this dish made for an excellent meal.

Loved this dish! Easy and elegant flavors. Only thing I added was some concentrated chicken base, about 1 tsp. My guests requested bread to sop up the sauce. Paired it with the Spicy Green Salad with Manchengo and Pears...it was a perfect pairing!

Excellent, very yummy, easy to make, my 4 year old son loved it.

This is very good. I used red wine instead of white (was what I had on hand) which gave it nice rich flavor and a pretty color.

Just finished reading the Last Touch page in the November, 2007 Gourmet issue. With fresh sage still in the garden and local apple cider available, this seemed a natural. What we didn't expect was how EASY and how DELICIOUS this recipe turned out to be! Perfect as is!

Excellent recipe. I substituted chicken stock for the wine but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The chicken also reheated well the next day
