This was tasty and easy... and I enjoyed both the leaves (the part you normally eat, you know) and the stem. Four dinner sharers vouch for it too.

I par-cook the artichokes first in the microwave and it works much better, plus reduces cooking time a little. Cut artichokes in half, put in bowl w/ maybe a cup of water, cover w/ plastic and microwave 5+ minutes until somewhat tender. Then cook as recipe states with a pinch of thymne - will be wonderful.

Hoped for a great new recipe, but found a really bad one. I feel this recipe totally missed the mark. Perhaps if you're looking for an artichoke heart recipe, this might work, but made according to the recipe, the rest of the artichoke was completly useless. Tough, hard, inedible. What a shame!

Ugh. Thank God I've tasted great braised Artichokes...if this had been my introduction to this dish, I'd say, "Never again!"

Best artichokes I've ever made! Doubt if I will ever go back to steaming or boiling artichokes. Will use this for all my artichoke recipes.

The artichokes taste so good! The petals were not very edible but the heart was delicious!

Flavor was just fine, not bitter at all, however the petals were not edible.

While I love artichokes, I also found these very bitter.

This recipe made my artichokes bitter and inedible. Back to boiling for me.

This dish was quite excellent. Although I disagree with Riverrun8 that the artichokes become bitter, it is true that they will be a bit tart. My family and I all liked this, but others may not. For a variation that will result in less tart artichokes, try substituting fresh orange juice in place of the wine and add a little sugar if you like. The mint and thyme worked splendidly, but other herbs, such as rosemary or oregano, work well also.

I had no luck with this recipe. Boiling the artichokes in wine gave them an unpleasant, bitter flavor. I think I will stick to steaming them in water and flavoring them with lemon, parmesan and butter.

I aLAOVE this recipe, but I use rosemary instead of mint or thyme, I also use 1/3 c. grated romano cheese and parsley,
