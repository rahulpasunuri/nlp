This was a lot of work, and the results did not impress. It was OK, but not worth the time. And yes, waaaay too much stock. Wish there was something I could do with the leftover sauce! I liked the potatoes, they took more cooking time and stock than was called for (around 20 - 25 minutes instead of 12 in the last step), but they were good, different, family liked them. I would use less parmesan, more salt next time.

I've made many, many recipes from this web site and often make my decision based on reviews of other cooks. Unfortunately I did not read the reviews on this recipe. I agree with another reviewer that it's too much work for what you get - thin, acidic broth, mushy vegetables, not a whole lot of flavor. The risotto saved the meal, but I had to add to it (parmesan, butter, cream) to make it work. Would not make this again.

I thought the recipe was very good especially with the potatoes as a side dish. My husband is not a picky eater, so I like to try different recipes & he too thought it was very tasty. And it was also good the next day for leftovers. I would definitely make this again.

All the prep work is to be expected, but the final result was not worth the trouble. Good but not the best short ribs I've ever made.

I used boneless short ribs which were much less fatty. I did throw in a few with the bones to flavor the sauce. Because it's so flippin cold here, I was able to put the pot out on the porch so the fat would solidify. Then I just removed it! I used my Videlia onion chopper for all of the veggies and apple. It made a nice uniform dice, especially great for the potato dish! We love this dish...will make it again and again!

Disappointing recipe. The apple and potato "risotto" was interesting, but there was nothing special about the short ribs.

I made this for a dinner party this weekend, and it's quite delicious. I agree on the chicken stock. Way too much. I used a 5 qt Dutch oven for this, and should have cut the wine down to 1 c. and about 4 c. chicken stock. I might consider adding a bit of thyme when I saute the vegetables next time, and finishing the sauce with some buter and flour kneaded together to thicken it up a bit more. Otherwise, a very good, hearty winter recipe that's sure to impress guests, without being too much work or being too delicate and finicky.

It's me again, the one questioning the 10 cups of chicken stock. As I said, I only added six and it turned out fine. The flavor is delicious but again, six cups stock + 2 cups wine was WAY more than enough to cover the ribs...I could have used 3 cups of stock and it would have been fine (maybe cut down on the wine if you don't want the wine taste to overpower the dish)...the braising liquid is only used to "drizzle" over the potatoes.... my gosh, it made enough to drizzle 100 plates! I think it's a typo...

Am I missing something here? It seems the 10 cups of chicken stock is excessive. I just put my ribs in the oven so I can't give a full review yet, but I didn't have a pot big enough to hold all that liquid (including my crock pot!). The 10 cups is IN ADDITION to the 2 cups of wine. After adding 6 cups I stopped... there was no more room in my large pot. Even then it was PLENTY enough to cover the ribs...that's why I wonder if it's a typo or something...even though no other reviewers so far have thought it's an issue. Anyone else?

Incredible. I followed the recipe as written, and the ribs were tender and delicious.

Amazing!

You can substitute apple juice for wine but will need maybe balsamic vinegar or white wine vinegar to make up for the acidity you are missing with juice. With a hearty beef recipe maybe try a fuller bodied juice like blueberry etc.

I can't cook with wine. Does anyone have a suggestion for substitution?
