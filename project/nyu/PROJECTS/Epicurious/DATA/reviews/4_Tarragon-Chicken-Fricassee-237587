Essentially, a coq au vin with white wine instead of red, and tarragon I've made for years. Dredge chicken in flour blended with S&P plus the tarragon before browning (will give a thicker sauce). Yes, use less cream, but more white wine. Replaced shallots with whole pearl or Cippolini onions. Add white mushrooms, sliced, quartered, or whole. Remove chicken and vegetable when done, and reduce or thicken sauce as desired. Yum!

worse thing i've tasted in awhile...if you want good fricasee try the Fanny Farmer cookbook. It's fantastically great; whereas this recipe is horrid!

OMG delicious! Really easy to pull together for a weeknight but special enough for company. I only had drumsticks and that was fine. Served with green bean salad fresh from the garden and it was a divine late summer meal!

This was quite tasty, but not worth the calories. You could tweak it by decreasing the cream and using skinless chicken -- or you could just find another recipe. Chicken Louisa, also here on Epicurious, is FABULOUS, and uses almost the same ingredients.

Followed the recipe except omitted the garlic as suggested by other reviewers. The sauce was a little runny, but I didn't want to spend extra time to reduce. It tasted great. Chicken was moist. The dish paired well with grilled new potatoes and we poured the sauce over both.

I did not use garlic, nor did I measure the tarragon, but got amazing results. The flavors are divine! This recipe is easy, and fairly quick to make. If you want to impress someone, keep this recipe in mind.

It seems that 90% of the recipes now contain garlic. I know it is a favorite of most people but it overpowers the delicate flavors of the chicken, wine and tarragon. Without the garlic this is a lovely dish

This was my first time making fricasee and I followed the recipe as written. It was absolutely delicious! I am just leaning to cook but I really impressed my boyfriend (who is quite a good cook) with this one. The only issue I had is that one of the chicken pieces, surprisingly one on the bottom of the skillet, was a bit pink in the middle. I cooked the chicken for 25 minutes but perhaps next time I'll add a few more minutes.

This is really rich, but the flavor balance is wonderful. I cut the sauce recipe in half & used about a pound of boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I just sauteed the chicken till cooked, then did the sauce in the skillet - no simmering. The cream reduced quite well - no hint of the sauce "breaking" at all.

Quite good. I didn't have white wine on hand so I just upped the amount of chicken stock. I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts so that it would cook a little more quickly. My husband and I both thought this tasted a little bit like some Thai curries we make. Somehow the sweetness of the heavy cream combined with the anise-y tarragon gave it a coconut curry edge. Yum.

I made this for company and everyone loved it. The flavor was wonderful. The Tarragon was just the right amount not overpowering. I will definiitely be making this frequently.

This was so easy and so good. I also halved the cream, just to cut down on some fat. It was delicious!

What a great dish! It takes no time to make, which is great mid-week and is certainly good enough to serve to friends. Have made it three times in as many weeks.

It was pretty delicious! Like the others, I reduced the heavy cream (to about 3/4 of a cup). I placed a few lemon slices in the sauce and that made it a perhaps a little to tart. & since I couldn't find a bay leaf, I simply did w/o. Still tasted great and was especially delicious over pasta!

I did not 'rate' this recipe, because I chose to roast the chicken, rather than fry it. I made the sauce in the roasting pan juices. I reduced the sauce until it 'thickened', and in so doing, the sauce turned a beautiful caramel color. The sauce was delicious - tasted as if it had cognac in it.

This is a fantastic recipe to have on hand. The ingrediants are esy to have on hand and it is delicious. I have made for friends many time with rave reviews. The sauce is rich, but if you are looking to make an impression, I reccomend this dish

This recipe has quickly become one of my go-to recipes. I use only chicken breasts and it turns out great for me every time. I would recommend keeping a close eye on it once you add the cream as it tends to separate if you're not careful.

I've had better Tarragon Chicken, although I can't recall where I got the recipe. Duh! Anyway, this one was good... I followed the other chefs advice and only used 1/2 cup of cream. I found the sauce to be too oily at the end... and it didn't reduce in the time suggested. I served this for my husband's birthday dinner, and he cleaned his plate with no complaints.

Great, well-balanced flavor. I used half the cream suggested, and it was still rich enough without overkill. Also accidentally used twice as much lemon, which was finegave it a really nice, bright flavor. Served it with lots of fragrant Carolina Plantation rice to soak up the sauce.

very easy and good. I only wish it did not call for so much cream. next time I will try it with just a little sour cream mixed in at the end.
