I made this for a party the month this recipe was published in 2003. It was received with rave reviews and requests for the recipe. Nine years later, a friend who was at that party asked me to make enough to bring to her wedding reception this weekend. To me, that is a rave review.

I can't stop eating this! Per some of the other reviewers, I went light on the oil and used what I had on-hand: cilantro instead of parsley and lime juice instead of vinegar. I used a 1-3 ratio for cilantro to mint, which worked out nicely.

Good combination of flavors. Only change to the recipe was I used less olive oil and replaced the champagne vinegar with fresh lime juice. Make sure to finely mince the onions, mint, parsley and jalapeno peppers. Changes to the herbs as suggested by others would be good -- use whatever strikes your fancy. Also agree that by using smaller cubes of watermelon it would be a great salsa, vice salad. A lot of possibilities.

Quite tasty and seemed to be a crowd pleaser. I cut up the watermelon and let it drain for a couple hours before assembling the salad. I cut back on the mint, added some fresh basil, as well as a little cayenne & white pepper. I also make a watermelon salad with feta, arugula and toasted sliced almonds - this was refreshingly different. I was tempted to skip the green onions but was glad I didn't - they really add a lot.

A good friend made this salad for me about 4 years ago and it took me the last 4 years to track it down. Thank god I found it I have been craving it. Soooo good.

Fabulous, refreshing, and EASY. It goes with just about any menu for the spring and summer. I add cilantro instead of parsley for a better depth of flavor.

Perfect flavor! But slightly soupy, I will try cutting the watermelon the night before and draining before using as suggested.

I've made this countless times and always get rave reviews. I use about a tablespoon LESS oil, and I use a lighter flavored oil, like Enova. I don't measure the watermelon too accurately and use more than called for alot of times. Also, since champaign vinegar is so expensive, I use rice vinegar (not the seasoned kind). Tomorrow I plan to make it with yellow watermelon. Love it!

Amazing, though I added a bit more watermelon.

I love this salad. It is the only way I got one of my friends to eat watermelon. The champagne vinegar is the perfect match to this. Great to serve with some spicy steaks.

Not bad, but we didn't think it necessarily improved on plain watermelon. Chop your herbs and green onions as finely as possible--use a processor if you have one.

A wonderfully refreshing salad! The cool juiciness of the watermelon goes well with slight jalapeno heat and freshness of the herbs. A summer must! I only changed one ingredient. I did not have champagne vinegar, so I substituted lime juice instead. Delicious!

I made this for a luncheon. Everyone loved it. I found that you can cut up the watermelon the nite before. Drain off the excess juice and toss with the rest of the ingredients. I prefer it feshly combined, as it becomes watery and mushy after a couple of hours. A keeper.

I made this salad exactly as the recipe called for, and it was awesome...a big hit at summer barbecues. I've also made it where I've chopped the watermelon into much smaller pieces and used it like a salsa...goes great with grilled salmon.

I made this several times this summer and everyone absolutley loved it. I would not change a thing!!!

Love this salad! The mint and watermelon are an obvious combination, but the other spicy flavors in this one make the salad so interesting! I've had lots of compliments on it. Tried it first with a vinegar other than the champagne vinegar, but the champagne vinegar was much better.

Good suggestions from reviewers, thanks... I thought about using cilantro, but didn't. Maybe I will next time. This is a good basic recipe! Tonight we followed it except for cutting back a little on the olive oil. It says season generously with salt and pepper and I did. My husband thought it was a little too salty, but it was just right for me.

My 3 fork rating isn't fair to the original recipe because I changed it so much. However, my version was so good that I felt I wanted to share it with readers. Not being a fan of watermelon, I used honeydew melon; cilantro rather than parsley, and unseasoned rice vinegar - fresh out of "champagne" vinegar. The red jalapeno I used added a pretty color. This salad was so good in the tasting that I nearly forgot to add the herbs. A really refreshing and different salad. Easy, too.

Nigella is not on the American food network. I did find her site going to Google, typing in Nigella & found the watermelon recipe on "Nigella Lawson, the domestic goddess-----" Paula Deen (American food network) also has a watermelon recipe using feta. Nigella adds black olives & lime juice (instead of vinegar) to hers.

Nigella watermelon/feta salad is waaayyy better. Make sure you slice the red onion very thin and let it steep in the lime juice a few hours. This salad was good until I tried Nigellas and now I will never make this one again :(

The watermelon feta salad was made on the food network by Nigella. I suggest checking her recipe file.

To Mary Schei (or anyone else who could help! My stepdaughter mentioned sampling a dish such as you described recently and reported that it was delicious, so I am looking for a recipe. Can you or anyone else help me locate a recipe for a salad composed of watermelon, onion, and feta cheese? Thank you. Would you be willing to take the time to share this recipe with me? I would greatly appreciate it!

Since we had a bunch of leftover (seedless!)watermelon, I decided to try this recipe. It was surprisingly good. I aseembled everything in advance without putting the dressing on until I served it. The guests raved about it. I will chop up the Italian parsley a little finer the next time. It can be too fibrous if not chopped well.

Try adding cilantro instead of mint and 1/2 cup green onions and 1/2 cup diced Vidalia onions. Also dice instead of cubing watermelon. Makes a refreshing salsa-like dish.

This salad was delicious--the crisp flavor of watermelon works really well with the onion and mint. The people who tried it at the cookout also loved it and asked me for the recipe. My only complaint was that the salad was soupy about four hours after I made it. I know this is just what happens with watermelon, but I wonder if salting it helped draw out the water faster. The next time I make it, I'm not going to salt it and just encourage people to salt their individual servings to see if that will help postpone the soupiness.

I haven't tried this yet but here is another idea. Add fresh lemon juice & cayenne pepper to watermelon. Its delicious!!

I was given a different version of this type of dish and told it was delicious! It was watermelon chunks, feta cheese and fresh basil.

I served this as one of many dishes on a crowded buffet table that included everything in the "beach party" spread in the same issue of the magazine (BA July 2003), and it was one of the stars. Everybody loved it, and there were no leftovers.

This dish was very refreshing. A nice change from just ordinary watermelon. It reminded me of a watermelon salsa. Good for BBQs. I would make it again.
