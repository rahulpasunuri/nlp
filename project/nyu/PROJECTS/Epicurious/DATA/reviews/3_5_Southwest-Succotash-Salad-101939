I substituted black and garbanzo beans for kidney beans. I added green peppers,yellow peppers, chopped green onions and cubed roasted chicken breast tossed with BBQ sauce. Yum.

I have made this several times with a couple variations. I used black beans instead of kidney. Made as side dish exactly as directed. Other time I omitted oil & vinegar, and served with grilled chicken over sald greens with a salsa ranch dressing-Fabulous, my family loves this one dish meal.

Very nice, light salad. I topped it with broiled chicken breast to make a good dinner salad. Try it with a simple buttermilk dressing: 3/4C buttermilk, 1/4C sour cream, 2 cloves garlic crushed, 2 Tbs lime juice, 1/4 tsp cayenne, S/P to taste. Delicious!!

I made the following alterations and was very satisfied with the outcome. I used 2 cups anasasi beans I had cooked (smalll white beans would do), plain Jack cheese and added a tsp. of red pepper flakes & added a cup of sliced hearts of palm. I thought one ear of cooked corn was sufficient. Next time I will eliminate the cumin and store-bought dressing and make a cumin vinaigrette from "The New Basics Cookbook". This was great served with a freshly grilled and sliced chicken breast.

To serve a crowd, I used garbanzo beans, black beans, as well as the kidney beans, used green bell pepper diced, and cherry tomatoes halved, and of course increased the vinagrette accordingly with excellent results, garnished with sliced green onions.

We like this recipe and served it as a side to grilled chicken, along with flour tortillas. I added black beans to this recipe and it really improved it.
