Excellent and easy. I made it with a food processor. I know I will use this recipe again and again. I had purchased a store bought refrigerator dough that didn't work well and I was able to literally throw this dough together. Love it!

Absolutely fantastic pie crust recipe! I am a baker by trade and have tried many different crust recipes over the years. this one, hands down, is the best. The rave reviews from those eating it, coupled with my rave reviews of how consistantly it turns out, makes this a four fork recipe for sure.

This recipe is easy. It's the first pie crust I've ever made and it came out perfectly. I used a food processor to pulse the dough and it couldn't have been easier.

So simple and comes out beautiful. This was the first time I ever made a crust from scratch, and it was so easy I'll never look back. I made this crust without a food processor (I used my hands) and without a rolling pin (used a wine bottle), and it was delicious. No need to be intimidated by homemade pie crust anymore!
