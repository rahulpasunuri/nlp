Decent recipe, but I had to make a few modifications in order to make it turn out. First, I followed the advice of others and ground up the matzo meal before adding it to the milk, which helped -- but didn't totally eliminate -- the lumpiness). Second, the crepe batter was much too thick to produce crepes thin enough to roll into blintzes with ease, so I ended up adding about 1/2 c of milk (if you're an experienced crepe maker, you'll know when it's the right thinness, but if you're not, the crepe batter should easily be made to cover the bottom of the pan when you tip it back and forth. Think thinner pancake batter). Third, when I make this again, I'll add a bit more salt to the crepe batter; it was just slightly too bland for my taste. Overall a tasty and not too difficult recipe.

I confess I am waiting for this to come out of the oven, so my review is really for the crepes - YUM. This is a definite keeper for both sweet and savory Pesach dishes. I might add a little sugar if using for dessert or sweet brunch. They are a little more difficult to handle than regular crepes, but taste pretty close

I just made these blintzes (both crepes and filling) for dinner and I thought they were great. They were really tasty and easy enough to be my first crepe experience. I've never made crepes before and I don't have a crepe pan, so I think the fact that the batter was a little thick was better for me. Yes, I could see pieces of matzah meal that weren't completely pulverized during blending, but I didn't think that impacted the final crepe. I would definitely make these again for a Passover meal.

I made these for the second time this Passiover week using 1% milk and egg beaters for the blintz batter. I also increased the milk by about 2 Tbsp, which produced a thinner, more delicate blintz. I used nonfat cottage cheese, which I sweetened with a little sugar, cinnamon, vanilla and grated lemon zest. The substitution of the lower fat ingredients did not diminish the taste of this dish at all. Both the savory and sweet version of these blintzes are delicious.

The matzo meal worked just fine for me in the crepe batter. I whirled the batter for quite some time in the blender, so perhaps that pulverized the meal well enough so the batter wasn't at alll lumpy. I also used egg beaters in place of the eggs, and 2 % milk. For the filling, I used 2% cottage cheese and pureed it in the food processor until it was the texture of ricotta cheese. The texture was perfect. These blintzes were a huge success at a brunch I had during Passover. I will definitely make these again.

These crepes were fantastic. Followed suggestion and added a little more milk. Had 2 cups ricotta, made the right amount of filling, using a slightly smaller pan. Used 6 pieces of matzah and crushed into a cake meal consistency in Cuisinart. Yummy!

I just made the crepes, and thought they were not liquid enough, so I just added more milk. Overall, I thought these were good and could go with either sweet or savory fillings.

Per the suggestion of another reviewer, I put the matzah meal in the blender and spun it for a few minutes to mill it down finer before blending it with the other ingredients. This worked quite well and the crepes were delicious and did not have any chunks in them. Also, I made the crepes for breakfast and did not make the filling. Instead, I added 2.5 tablespoons of sugar and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and they were delicious with breakfast fillings like jam, sugar, and nutella. Great recipe! I highly recommend it.

In a pre-passover test run, these turned out OK, but not stellar. The matzah meal makes the crepe batter slightly lumpty (should the recipe really call for passover cake meal, not matzo meal?); another time, I'd spin the meal in the blender a bit before adding the wet ingredients, to make sure it's finer (or, better yet, use a pesakh crepe recipe w/cake meal) I also found texture of the small curd whole fat cottage cheese to be too "loose", and I'd either give it a whirl in the blender (maybe with a little softened cream cheese) or use farmer cheese another time. Pretty presentation, but a little bland--the onion topping saved it. (As a time-saver, Persian packaged crispy fried onions would work well on top) Needed more asparagus, or some mushrooms, or a spice in the mix or something to zip it up.
