I made the stuffed veal patty & put a beef/cream gravy over it. Hubs liked it a lot. (He can't chew well right now).

One word - OUTSTANDING!!! The recipe says serves - 4. I was glad to make two "large" burgers and keep the stuffing inside. I used 1/2 mozzarella and 1/2 cheddar. After reading other reviews, I will try other cheeses - maybe even blue cheese! I liked the mayo mixture but would caution guests to try it before spreading it over their whole burger. Skipped the bun to save calories. I will make this recipe often in the future.

Great idea to use ground veal! I love to stuff these with Boursin. Delicious! Mushrooms are quick and easy, too.

This recipe is 4 forks with one substitution. Use goat cheese instead of mozzarella. The flavor and texture of the goat cheese is wonderful in this burger. If you must use mozzarella use 1/4 in. slices of fresh mozzaella. Then you will get the same creamy texture. The portabellas are an absolute must. They add another layer of flavor and texture. YUM!

This redefines the definition of cheese burger. The best burger I have ever had, end of story. Followed recipe for burgers exactly but did not make mushrooms. Served with ripe farmers market tomatoes. Yum!

This makes a hefty burger, so be careful what sides you serve with it. Don't skip the mayo dressing, it's the best part! I'm going to make and use the dressing on other types of sandwiches. For ease I used dijon mustard instead of mustard powder, and lemon juice instead of lemon peel. Next time I will add Worcestershire sauce to the mayo dressing as well. Also, I sauteed the mushrooms in garlic and oil instead of baking them. Unless you have a great selection of portobellos at your supermarket (which I did not) I found that my mushrooms were too large and made this sandwich HUGE. Next time I will use sliced portobellos to better customize how much mushroom each diner ends up with.

Outstanding! The recipe was so quick and easy, and yielded incredibly juicy and tasty burgers. Followed the recipe, except that we used equal parts ground veal and sirloin, fresh mozzarella, and fresh sage. We also didn't add the mushrooms, but the burgers were great without them.

Had some ground veal in the freezer. We didn't feel like burgers on buns so I just did the burgers; no mayo, no mushrooms, no buns. Just the burgers on a plate with Broiled Tomatoes with Olives and Garlic and some herbed Italian green beans. It was a pleasant meal. Next time, I'll probably do the whole recipe.

We absolutely loved this, although there were a few changes. Used beef, fresh mozzarella, then sauteed sliced mushrooms with the garlic and toasted the buns with a bit of butter in a frying pan. Can't wait to try it with veal. This is a keeper.

Wow! What a gourmet take on the standard burger, and easy, too! The mayo-mustard mix and roasted portabello really set it off nicely. I used a whole wheat kaiser roll as the bun, and that was also a nice complement to the flavor mix.

I didn't have any ground veal at home, so I tried another writer's suggestion and used ground beef. I also used A-1 instead of Worcestshire. It was awesome! I will definitely do this again.

the best burgers in the entire universe---YUM

This was delicious, both delicate and filling. I didn't use the portobello mushrooms (I thought it seemed too much); instead, I served the burgers with sliced ripe tomato, thinly sliced red onion, and baby arugula. I recommend preparing the burgers in advance and letting them set in the fridge. And I cannot recommend the mayonnaise enough - it brought everything together perfectly.

Very tasty...but hard to get into your mouth! Have made them several times for guests...just don't tell your pickier friends what they are eating right off the bat...they'll love them!

We generally liked this, but don't see the need to use (more expensive and harder-to-find) veal. Lean beef (or even turkey?) would have worked as well.
