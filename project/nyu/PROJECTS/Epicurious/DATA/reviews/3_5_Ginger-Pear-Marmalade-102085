I had way too many pears within two days. so I tried this recipe. it turned out to be really good. However, I will try to put less lemon next time, cause it tastes like lemon-ginger marmalade and no hint of pear.

We had a bumper crop of pears, and this was so delicious that we will have a cupboard full of this outrageously delicious "marmalade". One should have a license to serve it!
