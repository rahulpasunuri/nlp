Great recipe. I served the mussels as a first course on a bed of sea salt - it looked so nice in the oven, so I kept it on the plate as well. I served it with some fresh Mango Salsa. The tastes blend perfectly together and it looks great on the plate as well.

I have gone over this recipe again and again to see if I made a mistake but I am positive I didn't. These were horrible!!! I made them for our New Year's Eve party and my husband and I tested them in the kitchen before putting them out. Thank goodness! We threw them away before anyone else tasted them. I was really disappointed since we love mussels and it was quite a bit of work for something so disgusting!

Outstanding!!! Only problem was that 1-1/4 lbs of mussels netted only 35. It was so good, we could have easily eaten many more. Will put in on the menu for the next party. They looked as good as they tasted.

Prepare the crumbs a day or two before hand; they will benefit by the mixing of flavors. I made these as an appetizer for an Easter dinner and they were a huge hit! Easy, too!!

I made these last night as a starter for a dinner party, and they went over very well. The mussels can be cooked early in the day, shucked and chilled until just before assembling.
