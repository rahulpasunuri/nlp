I was surprised at how flavorful this salad turned out with so few ingredients. I'm not a huge fan of salad dressing, but the lime juice and the fresh cilantro really mix well together. I feared the ginger might have been overpowering, but it was just the right amount. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I also added a few ingredients to the salad including avocado and tomatoes. I found that it needed a bit of salt to punch up the flavors. Easy, fast and a nice twist on run of the mill salad!

I turned this into a chicken salad with some leftover grilled chicken breasts cut into 1 inch dice. I also added a couple sliced hard- boiled eggs, some black beans, croutons, yellow tomato, and chopped red onion. The dressing is wonderful and the cilantro is too. We are great lovers of Ceasar salads andd this comes mighty close to taking it's place.

Fantastic! I made a complete mess washing and drying all those greens, but the taste was out of this world. I didn't need to add any salt or pepper.
