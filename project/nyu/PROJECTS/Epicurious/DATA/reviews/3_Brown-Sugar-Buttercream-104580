I used this as an topping for cupcakes, it went over 24 cupcakes perfectly with nothing left over! I couldn't believe the flavor, not too sweet and perfectly light. Everyone was impressed.

About the best thing I can say about this frosting is that it was fun to make. I always kind of enjoy the magical process of making meringues and caramel and such. However, the end result is a frosting that is so full of butter that, to me, it just tastes like I spread a slab of butter on my cake. If that sounds appealing to you, go for it. If you prefer a lighter frosting, a traditional seafoam might be a better brown sugar experience.

Love this as a cupcake recipe. To make the buttercream, I combine brown sugar and egg whites and whisk for 3 minutes over a double boiler. Then beat on medium for 5 minutes to cool the meringue down. Add the 3 sticks butter and give it one good beating and voila! you've got brown sugar buttercream without all the hassle described above.

This is a great buttercream recipe. As stated in other reviews, for those who had trouble with the frosting setting up after adding butter, you need to be meticulous about the temperatures being accurate--the butter needs to be very soft; the meringue needs to be whipped until totally cool. If you ended up with runny meringue "soup," you might want to stick the whole bowl in the refrigerator for about 10-15 minutes (or longer) and re-whip. It'll come together! Really! A side note: I was able to get this (and other meringue buttercream recipes) to set up with only 2/3 of the butter (that's 2 sticks instead of 3, here). Definitely very good and would make again.

Just to repeat what many others have said, this recipe requires the correct equipment (and stand mixer, a candy thermometer), the correct ingredients (room temperature butter and egg whites) and patience. Follow the directions, take your time and you should be rewarded with a buttercream that can carry other flavours (like chocolate or orange). I used this recipe to transform my mom's traditional banana cake (served as a square) into a surprisingly good layer cake (topped with toasted coconut). I'll use this recipe again.

I just got done making this buttercream frosting and I love it! It tastes like cookie dough. I didn't have any of the problems people are talking about - overly salty, syrup hardening and not incorporating, or too mild of a taste. I did notice that the syrup did harden on some areas of the bowl but not bad enough for it to not incorpoarte. I didn't run the syrup down the bowl like the recipe suggests, instead in a very thin stream I drizzled it directly on the meringue closest to the side of the bowl. As with any buttercream recipe I've ever made it does have a semi- greesy feel but not as bad as others.

I found Martha Stewart's recipe for brown sugar buttercream when i was trying to find this again and it worked quite well for me! the difference: one more egg white and light brown sugar....but what probably would make things easier and avoid using hair dryers etc. is the process of adding the sugar to the whites at the beginning over a double boiler until the sugar is dissolved. THEN make the merengue, then add butter

I literally just finished this recipe. I have not frosted anything yet. From what I can tell it will be creamy and sweet and light. I think it tastes like cookie dough in frosting form, maybe because all of the ingredients are the same?? ;) Planning on frosting some devils food cupcakes with it tomorrow.

After the 1st cube of butter I tasted it and was amazed at the wonderful flavor. I wish I had stopped there and lived with the marshmellow fluff texture. After the 2nd cube it was a nasty greasy substance. I made this twice because I loved the initial flavor and I wanted to see where I went wrong. Alas, the 2nd was just as bad. Don't make this...unless you're into being sick.

What a gastly recipe! I was looking for a new take on an icing for a chocolate cake so tried this one. I was thrilled because the recipe seemed to turn out out perfectly - the texture was lovely, the consistency beautiful and soft. But the taste - oh, the horrible, horrible taste! Tasted like sweetened whipped butter with somekind of odd aftertaste. More like something you spread on rolls (in tiny quantities) than spread on an entire cake. I managed to salvage it by adding a bunch of icing sugar, but definitely not a recipe I would recommend!

I agree with callebaut--I left this in the fridge for only four hours and it started to separate. I'm not sure if you can whip it back together again or not...I had no problem getting it to come together in the first place, just had to beat it for a long time. Next time I'll halve the recipe and not refrigerate it.

Maybe I did something wrong but you can't put this in the fridge and use later. When I went to frost the cake, I took it out of the fridge and let it soften for awhile. When I tried to stir but it broke into chunks. So I put it back into my mixer and it turned into a curdled mess with the sugar syrup separating from the frosting. I'll make it again just so I can do it right but it's not the most user-friendly recipe.

As with Italian bittercream, I use a thermometer to check the syrup temperature. However, the syrup doesn't blend with the egg whites as described - instead, it typically hardens on the beaters and some on the side of the mixer bowl. I've made it twice, and both times this happened, although I peresevered and it did come together, but I was left believing the suger syrup was only about half in the resulting frosting. I added sifted cocoa powder to the first batch, and it was delicious - the consistency of the buttercream was really good in the end - it's just the hard-as-a-rock sugar on the beaters that I don't see other folks conetnding with. All advice welcome!

This was delicious and buttery. I added some cream of tartar, and boiled the mixture for a bit longer to 248 degrees, but otherwise followed the recipe. It was delish!

I had no problem making this , read all reviews , there is a point when it gets a little scary but it did come together. But I thought it tasted like whipped sweetened butter. I added white chocolate to give it more flavor and cover the greasy aftertaste.

I had no problems making this recipe, as Italian Meringue Buttercream is my favoirite icing recipe to make. HOWEVER, the amount of salt is incorrect!!! I made it first time around with the suggested amount (3/4 of a teaspoon) and the salt was OVERPOWERING! I made it again with 1/4 teaspoon salt and it was wonderful. I'm using it as a filling in my friend's wedding cake in September!

I thought this was supposed to be used for decorating, not frosting a cake. That could be the reason some of you had a problem.

I paired this with the cake in Double Chocolate Layer Cake. I wanted something that would compliment the chocolate but differently. I would say that the frosting was awesome, but with my cake it was completely overpowered. I've made similar frostings, but this started to almost curdle (my butter was too cold and I had the egg whites to a stiff peak when I added the syrup) but with the hairdryer and the mixer going I brought it back (thanks for the previous tip!) This is sweet and amazing, truly amazing. I think that a milder chocolate cake or spice cake or even a soft pumpkin cake would pair nicely with this. Plus, I might add a hint of cocoa sometime.

I've made this frosting a few times and never had any problems, and love the taste. This time, I was afraid the frosting was "soupy" after the first few pats of butter, especially as my kitchen was hot from other cooking. I did the chilling method prescribed, and it turned into a gross curdled vomit looking mess. I blasted it on the kitchen aid to no avail. BUT, I tried the hair dryer trick suggested below and it worked like a charm! The frosting was more delicious than ever before in fact. However, I did blow a fuse in my house.

This wasn't easy, but well worth the effort. I tried this a few weeks ago and failed- the frosting never firmed up enough to spread on a cake. I decided to give it one more try, and was so pleased when it came together. One thing I did differently was to use the wire whisk attachement all the way through the beating cycle- the frosting did appear curdled at the end, so I briefly set the mixing bowl into a pan of wam water and beat by hand and within a minute the frosting was silky and smooth and firm.

This recipe is a little difficult, and when I added the butter it did look curdled and I was a little scared when it didn't come together when all the butter was added. Luckily, when I added the vanilla and did a little agressive mixing it did come together to make the most luciously rich frosting that pairs beautifully with the devils food cake!!

The first time I made this frosting it turned out wonderfully. I was a little worried when I was adding the butter, but like the recipe said, it came back together by the time I had added all the butter. It was quite a nice frosting and complimented the chocolate cake I had made it for quite nicely. The second, third, and fourth times I tried making it (I tried twice in one night) the whole thing turned into a disgusting curdled mess. It was horrible, the sugar syrup had all separated from the frosting and would not come back together with any amount of beating. I had to throw all three batches out and I almost cried, twice. Just two days ago however, I came across a cooking advice web site with an idea I never would have thought of trying for this problem. The problem, they said, was that the butter in the frosting was cooling too much and that is why it was separating and so you need to warm it up gently. The recommended method for warming the frosting was to take a hairdryer and go around the outside of the bowl and on the surface of the frosting staying only for a few seconds in each spot all the while beating the frosting. I was making cupcakes so I decided to attempt the recipe again and if it separated this time I was going to try the hairdryer. To my disappointment, first it was almost pourable after I had added all the butter so I tried cooling it a bit in some ice water and it began to separate but before I got too upset I found a hairdryer and the results were amazing! It came together in less than a minute and was nice and thick, a perfect consistency!

Used this to top chocolate cupcakes last night. It did look curdled at first but that went away after enough mixing. They were delicious and so buttery yummy.

I've made this recipe a few times, and I think it is delicious, although time consuming. Every person I have served it to loved it. I think the key is to frost quite thinly because it is so rich. I generally use about 2/3 this amount to frost and fill a 3 layer cake.

I love this frosting. The brown sugar takes longer to reach the soft ball stage than white sugar, but if you are patient, it's not a problem to work with otherwise. Realisticaly, you need a stand mixture, but that's true for practically all sugar syrup buttercreams. It's great plain (vanilla)or flavored with with chocolate, prailine, or both.

No, this recipe is not for the faint of heart or the ill-equipped. You MUST have the candy thermometer, a stand mixer (Kitchenaid), and some frozen peas (pineapple works well, too). The frozen peas come in particularly handy in cooling the meringue in under a week. This recipe is a little unrealistic in thinking that it'll be ready after 6 minutes of beating, so wedge a bag of frozen peas between the stand and the base of the bowl. The whole point of cooling the meringue, if you didn't realize, is to prevent the butter from separating and thus turning to soup. And don't panic when it looks like it's curdled. I've never NOT had that happen... just set the mixer to high and wait about two minutes. The result is the best TRUE buttercream I've ever had. I personally use less sugar because I find buttercreams to often be cloying and muting on the flavors of a cake.

This is a wonderful frosting recipe. I have used it for Yule logs, b-day and other occasion cakes. For a different flavor, add 2 oz. lukewarm melted bittersweet chocolate after adding half the butter. Delish!

NEVER AGAIN!! It took longer to make the frosting than it took to make the cake. It didn't mix well, it didn't taste that good, and it wasn't attractive. I ended up scraping it off my otherwise delicious cake and eating the cake plain. It's just not worth all the trouble!! Other reviewers that say it takes patience, but it's worth must be saints.

this recipe does take patience but you are rewarded with a rich, decadent frosting. it is best if you use a stand up mixer.i put the gel type ice bag under a towel and put my bowl on top. this helped cut down the beating time a little.

After making this recipe, I thought that it was more fuss than it was worth. I really didn't care for the texture or taste. After this experience, I decided that I will stick a good old fashioned confectioner's sugar chocolate icing on the devil's food cake and be done with it.

This recipe is fantastic, but you must follow the directions exactly. I must admit the reassurance from the other reviewers did help. I used a Kitchenaid hand mixer and found I had to beat the butter and merangue mixture a very long time (at least 15 minutes) to get the right consistency. But as a previous reviewer noted, it will come together -- you just have to be patient!

I just finished making this buttercream! First of all make sure that you are patient! This recipe takes time. You don't get your results right away! I followed the directions to the "T", and it came out perfect. I haven't tasted with the cake yet, so that's why I rated it 2. But after I put it on the devil's food cake, I'll submit again. Try this recepie! Remember, don't rush it. TIP: 1T of butter @ a time!

WHEN MAKING THIS KIND OF BUTTERCREAM TEMPERATURE IS VERY IMPORTANT.THE SUGAR SYRUP/EGG MIX NEEDS TO BE THOROUGHLY COOLED AND THE BUTTER NEEDS TO BE ROOM TEMPERATURE.SOMETIMES IT IS HELPFUL TO PREPARE THE SUGAR SYRUP/EGG MIX 2-3 DAYS IN ADVANCE AND PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE UNTIL NEEDED.THEN BRING TO ROOM TEMP AND ADD SOFTENED BUTTER AND MIX UNTIL IT COMES TOGETHER. SOUNDS DIFFICULT BUT WORTH THE EFFORT-TASTES AMAZING!

This is an Italian Meringue Buttercream Frosting. If you haven't made it before a few quick tips: (I use a Kitchenaid mixer) You have to beat the egg white/sugar syrup mixture a while...say about 8 minutes. The bottom of the bowl should be cool to the touch (or at least NOT warm). Add the butter 1 T at a time allowing it to cream into the syrup mixture. If the frosting starts to look curdled or like it isn't coming together, just beat it a while. It WILL come together:-) It whips up very nicely in the end. First time I made this type of frosting I dumped the whole batch in disgust...what a waste of butter! But if I had beaten it a while longer it would have been okay. It's a WONDERFUL frosting/ filling for cakes. Hope this helps:-)

I had a terrible time making this frosting. I may have added the butter while the egg white-sugar mixture was still too warm. The butter never totally pulled together. If anyone has suggestions on what may have gone wrong, I'd appreciate the advice!
