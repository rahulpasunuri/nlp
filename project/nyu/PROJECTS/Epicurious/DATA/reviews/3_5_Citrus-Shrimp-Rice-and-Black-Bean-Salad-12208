I loved this salad..it's easy and quick to make and really tasty. The citrus dressing is light and healthy--no oil! I loved crunchy texture provided by the romaine and thought the red pepper flakes added just the right level of spiciness. I used the full can of black beans--hate it when recipes leave you with a dab of something--it's only about 1/3 cup additional. I added some blanched sweet corn and chopped red onion to the leftovers and enjoyed it even more. This is a very refreshing salad for this hot summer weather. It can serve 3 lighter appetites. I'll definitely make this again.

I really loved this recipe. After reading previous reviews I did add some chopped mango and some scallions - the mango really took it to another level. I also used brown rice. Delicious.

This was delicious. It was a combination of rather delicate flavors. I used lemon zest and juice instead of that of lime since I had half of a lemon. I add cucumbers and mango as other reviewers had recommended. And I also added a green onion for another texture and taste. It was great! Will do it again.

Coriander is the seed of the cilantro plant. Cilantro leaves are green, are found next to fresh parsley, and are a typical addition to Mexican dishes. Coriander seeds are sold ground in the spice section, and are used in sweet baked goods.

Tasty and easy, makes a nice easy summer dinner . I tore up some lettuce and mixed in and then served in on the plate on top of large lettuce leaves for presentation. I added the mango--great suggestion, cant imagine the salad without it! Also, I used 1.5 tablespoons rice wine vinegar and 1/2 a tablespoon mirin which I think really helped balance the acidity from all the citrus.

Delicious! I was afriad it would be a bit bland without any onions or garlic, but the combination of cilantro and citrus really brought out the flavor.

Cilantro and fresh coriander are the same thing.

This recipe was a little odd to me. The flavors didn't seem to blend well despite cooking in the same liquid the whole time. The time factor was a problem too, by the time the rice was done cooking, the shrimp was adequatley chilled but the whole salad ended up too warm. Would give plenty of time to chill. My husband thought it was too tangy overall also.

What a hearty salad! I was out of black beans so I used canned chickpeas instead. The dressing I found was not enough so I drizzled a tablespoon of Balsamic Vinaigrette in each plate and that made a world of difference. We loved it. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

I thought this was great: Delicious, Fast, and Healthy. However, my boyfriend couldn't stand to eat it - he thought the dressing was untolerably bitter.

I guess I am in the minority here, but I thought this dish was absolutely awful, despite the fact that I like everything in it. I made it according to instructions except that I did not have orange zest, so I used only the lime zest. The flavors did not at all go well together, especially the citrus and pepper flakes. What a waste of shrimp.

delicious, refreshing and eye-pleasing! cilantro, for me (even garden frozen,thawed) was the flavour that tied it all together

I added a tiny bit of sugar, mango and diced, seedless cucumber. It is a lovely dish...fresh and summery and would make a great addition to any buffet.

Wonderful! I searched high and low for fresh coriander, but had to settle for a pinch of the powdered (which didn't seem to matter) and also followed others' suggestions and added some diced mango - this dish is amazing. My husband said it should be our 'signature summer salad,' and I certainly agree.

This salad was delicious even without the shrimp or rice. I even improvised on the dressing and used lime aid and orange juice concentrate and Asian chili sauce instead of the crushed red pepper and rice vinegar. WOW! We have been having it all week. This is definitely going into our favorite summer salads collection.

Delicious! And it went together fairly quickly. The guests loved it. I served it just with some crispy bread. Even better was that it made plenty for leftovers. Be sure to cut the zest very thinly, otherwise it gets oddly chewy. But definitely a nice warm weather dish.

I made it the first time subbing sweet rice wine vinegar and using fresh crunchy greens and was pleased, then tried adding a diced mango and WOWEE! Summer classic. Thanks for that terrific idea!

I thought this was great, although the vinegar took away from the sweetness, so I added some diced mango at the end, which complemented the dish perfectly! Make sure not to skimp on the cilantro.

Very light and refreshing. The flavors mingle well. We will make this one again and again.

A real crowd-pleaser: I'd hoped/expected to have leftovers but nooooo..... I had endive on hand instead of romaine---almost forgot to put it in at the end but glad I didn't; the crunch of the lettuce definitely adds to the overall experience. I also think it's worth it to cook the dried beans yourself if you have the time; the canned beans are kind of soft & break apart whereas cooked black beans hold their shape & add to the attractive appearance of the dish.

Great recipe! Couldn't find fresh coriander but that didn't seem to matter. Quite filling and plenty of leftovers.

Outstanding! I omitted the romaine and served the rice/bean/shrimp mix over fresh leaf lettace. FRESH! It'll make your mouth dance. Wonderful with a dry beer with lime. Can't wait to make it again.

Delicious! I skipped the romaine part, since I made the salad a night ahead of when I served it at work and didn't want to tote the romaine in separately. Plus, this recipe makes a LOT, and I didn't really see the need for the romaine, although I'm sure it would be tasty with it. This salad is just so tasty and lovely and fresh-tasting. I used red and yellow bell peppers, for lots of color.

An excellent meal; don't be deceived, it is not the easiest in the world to make, but it is worth it, particularly if you have some shrimp and you don't want the same old tired recipes. This one has some spice to it, and you can always crank up the heat.
