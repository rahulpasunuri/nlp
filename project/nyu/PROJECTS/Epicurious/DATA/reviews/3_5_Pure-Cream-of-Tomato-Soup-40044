Where I thought I had failed like 'A Cook', I took the suggestion from 'nowdsm' and used a blender. I also included a 14oz can of roasted tomatoes, pepper, granulated garlic (1/2 Tbs), and chipotle sauce (1 tbs). I let it simmer for about 30 mins before straining; that was a painful process - but my wife said she absolutely loved it!! I then took the strained aftermath, added chopped bacon, and used that as the base for a spagetti sauce (with saute'd carrots and celery). YUM YUM!!

I think I failed as well "A Cook" ... pink creamy stuff; I did try an additional can of roasted tomatoes (14 oz) for flavor and color, on top of the freshly cut 3 cups - it didn't work. Maybe nowdsm's suggestion would have worked. I left out the soda, but added a touch of garlic and chipotle sauce, then let simmer for 30 mins before straining.

I used 1 T butter and 1 T flour, cooked it until light brown. Meantime I cut up a 28 oz can of whole tomatoes, added a scant 1/4 t of baking soda and 1 T of sugar. When roux was light brown I added 1/2 cup whole milk and 1/2 cup skim to roux. Stirred with a whisk and cooked until slightly thickened. Added 1 chicken bouillon cube and then the tomatoes. Warmed the soup, added a little more sugar to taste, then blended it. Tastes like Campbell's only better and healthier. That was exactly what I was going for.

I must say, every time I use a tomato soup recipe that calls for baking soda, I am extremely disappointed. Soda might prevent curdling, but it always makes the soup taste really really bad. The rest of the recipe might be fine, but just watch the soup, don't let it boil & forget the nasty soda. Blech! It completely ruined the flavor.

I hate to be a wet blanket but I totally failed with this recipe; my fault I am certain. I ended up with pink milk soup. I even added a whole can of tomatoes, chopped, and it didn't help. I shall try adding tomato soup to see it this will help. :(

I love Campbells tomato soup and it is my sons favorite food. I have noticed over the years Campbells keeps changing the soup, so I set out on a quest to find a good homemade cream of tomato soup. I found this recipe and read the reviews and did add an additional 28 oz can of whole peel tomatoes that I chopped in a bowl with my pampered chef chopper. I had to adjust the salt, sugar by an additional 1/4 tsp and an additional 2 tbsp of flour. I made a huge error and added another 1/2 tsp of baking soda to the tomatoes because I thought I needed to because I added the extra can. My soup was so strong with baking soda I made sure I made notations of my changes on my copy of the recipe. Honestly, even though the baking soda was strong, I could still taste the flavor of the soup and it was good. Better than the Campbells tomato of my youth. Thank you to all who post comments, I find it such a helpful tool!

We can't get canned tomato soup here so I made this to go with our grilled cheese (rainy day lunch). Halved recipe and it made a little more than a can of condensed would have made. Substituted chopped celery (with leaves) for half of the onion. Was pretty good, but the consistency was a touch grainy.

Rating: 4
This soup is exactly what I was craving: I wanted the comforting taste of the red can Campbells tomato soup made with milk that I grew up with, but I didnt' want all the sodium and other garbage that is in canned food. I goofed on the amounts of milk and canned tomatoes (less milk and more tomatoes and their liquid) but other than that followed the recipe to the letter. My result were delicious if a bit watery; some more simmering on low heat took care of that. No extra salt needed. I would like to try a version with a bit less butter in it for my cholesterol's sake, but I think this is a perfect homemade, tastier version of the classic canned soup. Bring me a grilled cheese, no burned!

Good recipe, worth reading the reviews before making as there are some great suggestions. Instead of 4 cups milk, used 1 cup vegetable stock, 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup milk, and include the liquid from the canned tomatoes. Used immersion blender instead of straining.

PLEASE -- SOMEONE AT EPICURIOUS -- Please edit the reviews. Slogging through 28 reviews by the same person is not only very annoying, it completely skews the ratings. This happens often; one recipe had over 50 reviews by the same person. I think some reviewers don't realize that there is a pause between the time a review is submitted to Epicurious and when it appears online. In any event, I think this is a good Cream of Tomato Soup receipt. The soup is only as good as the quality of the tomatoes; consequently I believe that using canned tomatoes instead of the tasteless, watery fresh ones will produce a consistently good soup.

YUM ... this is the first time I've made tomato soup, and this was an easy, quick and delicious recipe. After reading other reviews, I adjusted the recipe a little. I used one 28 oz. can crushed tomatoes w/puree and one 28 oz. can fire roasted tomatoes. I added a little minced celery when I softened the onion. Because I used extra tomatoes ... I had to adjust the sugar to a tablespoon and I adjusted the salt to 2 tsp. And instead of 4 cups of milk ... to make it a little healthier ... I used 2 cups 1% milk and 1 cup chicken broth. After it simmered I puree the soup in a food processor (I don't own an immersion blender) instead of straining. Delicious, healthy and oh so easy!!

Very good tomato soup. Add fresh crab meat or seasoned, cooked and chopped shrimp for a variation.

Rating: 3
I have made this with both fresh tomatoes and canned tomatoes, and was surprised that it was more tomato-y with the canned ones. And my fresh tomatoes were very high acid, intense tomatoes fresh from my garden. I do love that you don't have to peel or seed the tomatoes. Straining it afterwards is a great option. I suppose an immersion blender would work with canned tomatoes, but with fresh, you really do want to get the skins out of there to improve the texture, and I prefer it without seeds as well. More 'authentic', as in, more like the cream of tomato soup from a can that I grew up with. It may be silly to aim to recreate something from a can, but some days you just want the cream of tomato soup from your childhood, and I'm glad I can make this recipe, know all the ingredients that went into it, and still enjoy a little nostalgic comfort food. And my kids liked it, too.

I added two 26 oz cans of tomatoes - one just left it looking too milky without enough tomato flavor for me. It turned out great!

I have made this recipe several times. However, I do not like the bay leaf, so I eliminate it. To compensate for the bay leaf I add equal amounts of celery and saute the celery with the onion. After cooking I use a hend held blender, the celery is not totally blended but it gives a nice texture element and that sweetness of the celery.

I think if you are going to come on here and give a recipe a bad review, it would be prudent to actually follow the recipe first. I love it when people say how AWFUL the recipe was, then proceed to list off all the ways they didn't follow instructions.

I loved this recipe! it was easy to make and taste great. I am glad I read the reviews before making but except for leaving out the bayleaves I stuck pretty close to the recipe. I was going to blend it by my husband thought it was great just the way it was. It worked great with grilled cheese for a lenten meal.

This was awful!! I pureed the tomato and onion instead of straining to intensify the tomato flavor, AND i did 3c milk + 1c chicken broth as someone suggested, and it still tasted just like floury milk!!! I added another 28 ounce can of pureed tomato, and a bunch of basil and some black pepper, and now it's good. The way it's made here though? Ick!

This is the soup that kids want when they ask for tomato soup. Only it tastes better than canned soup. I used an entire 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, and found it delicious. If I weren't making it for kids I would skip the straining step at the end.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. After adding the tomatoes, the soup was so milky that it overpowered the tomato flavor. I added three more large cans of diced fire-roasted tomatoes. I also added several minced garlic cloves, black pepper and more salt. It was much better after these additions.

wow! really great and easy recipe... i followed other reviews.. i put less flour and baking soda. for the milk portion, i put 2 cup milk, and 1 cup half and half which made it super creamy. instead of bay leaf, i put a few leaves of basil and add grated parmasean cheese.. DELicious!!! perfect fall soup....

I thought this soup was good, and very quick and easy. Like some of the other reviewers, I found it had too much foaminess (even before using the immersion blender). I think using a bit less baking soda next time might help. I also reduced the milk to 3 cups (and reduced the butter/flour a little as well) which gave a good milk/tomato ratio.

Rating: 4
I though this was fantastic. As per other reviewers' suggestions, I used 3 cups of milk and 1 cup of chicken stock. I used canned whole, peeled tomatoes. I ended up using almost an entire 28oz can (a little over 3 cups). Being that I included the juices from the can in my measurements I think that enhanced the tomato flavor that some seem to think is not intense enough, letting me forgo the suggested tomato paste. I also immersion-blended it heavily rather than straining. I think my laziness paid off because the intense tomato flavor was delicious. Forget canned tomato soup--this recipe is quick and easy and it's delicious!

Have made this several times and it is one of my favorites. I have used a mixture of Milk, cream and half and half for the liquid. I have added some tomato paste to boost tomato flavor and added some basil and garlic. Sometimes I have added some petite diced tomato which gives it a different texture component. I Will make again.

Easy, simple, and delicious. Be sure to cook the flour in the butter for at least two foamy minutes otherwise your resulting soup may taste a bit floury. Don't forget the baking soda, it's one of the secrets to making the soup turn out right.

My mother told me the way to make cream of tomato soup was to make the white sauce (roux) and tomatoes sauce separate and mix when hot to prevent curdling. The addition of baking soda to the hot tomatoes mixture results in the smoothest soup. If you are using fresh tomatoes, cooking first is important to soften the skin and seeds. I have always adjusted the tomatoes to white sauce mixture depending on what I have. I have used fresh tomatoes, canned tomatoes or a jar of spaghetti sauce. The best was when I used hot pepper infused olive oil to sauté some onions, celery and peppers first and then added the tomatoes. Always use a stick blender on the tomatoes prior to combining with white sauce. I have blended broccoli into this soup with wonderful results. Carrots work too. My kids like this soup over noodles. For company, I like to serve it over lump crab.

I'm glad that I read the reviews BEFORE I made this recipe - very helpful. I followed some of the feedback - used 3C milk & a little over a cup of chick broth  I also added ½ a can of tomato paste. I used 3 cans of tomatoes (even though 2 cans = 3 Cups); agree with another reviewer that it didn't have enough tomato flavor - next time I'll add 4 cans. To spice this up, I added white pepper - really adds a nice smokey flavor, a little cayenne for a kick, and lots of dried basil (I didn't have any fresh) - extra yummy! Was going to have this as a starter for tonight's steak dinner, but have decided to have it as a main course instead - with grilled cheese sandwiches, of course! I might also add some crumbled goat cheese on top too for an extra flavor pop!

Cream of Tomato Soup is my lifelong comfort food and I figured if there's one thing I should know how to make from scratch, this is it. Soup came out delicious. I used 3 cups of milk and 1 cup vegetable stock, 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp garlic salt, and I made it with fresh plum tomatoes, which are in perfect season right now. I also blended instead of strained - why would you strain out all the goods? Anyway, I threw a little bit of orzo in it and served it to my sister and boyfriend with a green salad and grilled cheese w/ham sandwiches. They both enjoyed it, and so did I!

Rating: 3
Really easy and the taste was great, but my kids said the texture was too foamy. Perhaps it's because I blended everything with a staff blender. Followed the recipe precisely except that I replaced one cup of milk with beef broth. I also added mini meatballs, which is typically done here, and the kids really loved that. I definitely will make this again but will have to figure out how to improve the texture.

yummy! I made this to use up 4 cups leftover canned tomatoes & puree. Cut the butter to 2 Tbsp and used leeks instead of onions. Used 3 Tbsp. flour and cooked thoroughly. Also used 1 c. chicken stock and 2 1/2 c. milk. Instead of straining or blending, I just left it chunky. It turned out perfectly - I didn't even have to adjust the seasoning! My picky 3-year-old and 10-month-old baby inhaled it!

Rating: 3
very delicious soup (with modifications of course). I used fresh tomatoes, about 6 cups, broiled, and skinned. This made nearly 3 cups of puree, and I used only 1 1/2 cups of milk. The trick is to let it simmer on medium for 1/2 hour after straining, so that the tomato flavour is more concentrated. the baking soda is a really good trick, too. I used a full teaspoon to make sure nothing untoward happened

I thought this soup was really good. Like some of the others a added some garlic to the onions. I also used 1 c. chicken broth and 2 1/2 cups 2% milk. I used all 4 tsp of flour.

I made it for my boyfriend who loves cream of tomato soup and he couldn't wait to eat the leftovers.

After reading some of the things others had tried, I decided to use one cup of cream and two cups of chicken broth for a total of 3 cups of liquid. I only used two tablespoons of flour (I think I could have used at least 3). I blended it, following the advice of others. I found the end result was good, but although I had pretty good tomatoes, it still had that slightly unripe taste. So I added about 4 ounces of tomato paste for a fuller flavor. It was great! It was sweet and not to thick. Very simple, but good.

I really played with this recipe. I loved the idea of using the roux as a base for the creaminess. I used one can of organic tomato puree, and one can organic crushed tomatoes, 2 cups of V8 juice (the soup was too thick for me because I only used 2 cups of milk), 1 teaspoon of organic dried basil, half teaspoon of emerils essence (BAM!), and left out the onions. Delicious! The baking soda is a good trick for keeping the tomatoes from curdling the milk base!

Okay, can we just be clear about the strainer thing? You are to put the soup THROUGH a strainer, NOT strain OUT the tomatoes. Geesh. Or you could just blend it. The soup is a nice basic recipe that could stand a little doctoring up but there's not a thing wrong with it.

A very mild yet very pleasant tomato soup. I added a can of Muir Glen fire roasted tomatoes (in addition to the tomatoes called for in the recipe), which punched the flavor up a bit.

Don't use fresh tomatoes unless you can get *good* tomatoes, like from a farmers market. In the dead of winter, when most of us are making soups, use canned, or this will have no flavor. I use a 28 oz can of Organic Diced Tomatoes, a 14.5 oz can of Fire Roasted Tomatoes (pureed), and half a dozen sun dried tomatoes (rehydrated and pureed) and heavy cream. That makes a heavenly tomato soup.

This is a very good *base* for a cream of tomato soup. I think you definitely have to add your own desired "zing" to it, otherwise it can be a bit bland. I added an extra small can of tomatoes--I used Muir Glen's Fire Roasted Tomatoes to give it depth--the juice and zest of 1/2 a lemon to give it tang, and some freshly cracked black pepper. For me, these additions (especially the lemon) made it a superior recipe. With these changes, I will be making this soup again.

I give this 4 forks with the following provisions: In order to make this soup come out right, and I have made this numerous times now, is to do the following.... Use three 14.5 oz cans of tomatoes (or fresh equivalent) and up to 8 oz of tomato paste. Cook the onion, add the flour, add the milk, etc as specified. Then add the tomatoes, simmer for a minute. Then use a stick blender or blend it in a blender. Then, add tomato paste to taste and blend it in to the soup. Blending is a must. Do not strain or it will be very bland. If you follow this, you should find it very good....certainly much better than Cambell's.
