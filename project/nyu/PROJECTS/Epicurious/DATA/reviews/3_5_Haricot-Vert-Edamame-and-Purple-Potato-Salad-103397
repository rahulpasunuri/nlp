I bought green beans & purple potatoes at the farmer's market today and was looking for creative ways to use them. Of course I was excited when I came across this recipe. I thought this dish was okay, but I must say I thought it looked much better than it tasted. I might make it again, but next time add some kind of vinegar to the dressing - not such a fan of the straight up oil. I also think I'd cut the potato into smaller pieces - I found the big chunks of potato kind of overwhelming. It was nice and fresh, just a little bland for my tastes. It sure is pretty, though!

Totally delicious, impossible to stop eating. I made it with frozen edamame and some fingerlings left over from the previous day's BBQ. Also added a squeeze of lemon, a splash of sherry vinaigrette, and some kosher salt to finish.

Made this with yellow, wax, beans and it was really good, looked great and tasted better.

Loved this fresh colorful salad! made two versions.... one with and one without dressing (we had some kids in the crowd.) All agreed its was delicious due to its freshness (the ice bath is key for this)

Didn't have any mint so I substituted thyme, still worked great. I also halved the recipe without any problem. Very dramatic side dish!

August 2000: I made the entire menu of which this recipe was a part. Everything turned out great! The only thing I would change on this vegetable recipe is to change the proportion of potato to green beans. I would use more green beans and fewer potato. Be sure to use the purple potato and get purple flowers for the centerpiece. I was lucky enough to get sprays of gorgeous lilac for my table. Hydrangeas would be pretty, too. This entire dinner was a show stopper. Perfect for warm weather. I made everything ahead of time like they recommended and did not sacrifice any taste. PS: June 2003: In response to the question about the other items. This recipe was part of a "Gourmet Entertains" feature. I would have to dig out my old May 2000 magazine to get all the recipe names. I did a search for " Gourmet May 2000" to see the list of recipes for that month. Here are the recipes I remember making: (1) Miso Marinated Salmon with Citrus and Shiitakes, (2) Mixed Berry Pavlovas, (3) Shrimp Sates with Spiced Pistachio Chutney, and (4) Artichoke Bruschetta. I also served a simple sliced cucumber salad with rice vinegar and a little sugar in the cutest blue and white Japanese bowls. Check out the Asian markets in your town for amazing finds.

Anyone know what the rest of the menu (mentioned by LA below) included?

I searched here for purple potato recipes and found this recipe for last night's dinner. It was for the two of us and we weren't THIS hungry, so we sort of quartered the recipe, LOL. It was a great accompaniment to grilled lamb chops, our main course.
