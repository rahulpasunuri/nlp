I found this pretty boring. The cake is okay; actually quite strong by itself (used decaf rather than espresso). The semifreddo was pretty bland. It was a lot of work for a mediocre product. My kids liked it though. The cake fell apart and I do NOT recommend sifting the cocoa over the cake, as it will be inhaled and choke people, as happened to all of us.

This is a great cake. Very easy to make, with wonderful flavor. Many people love it but can't but their finger on the malt, great presentation as well.

Had to make the semifreddo 3 times and it still didn't turn out right. Also, the cake ended up more like a brownie. It all tasted ok, but the dessert was a complete flop. Too much money to try again.

YUCK! Cannot imagine what everyone raved about, maybe I did it wrong! Way way too sweet, I increased malt powder as suggested and it was sickeninly overpowering. Oh well, luckily it is usually fun to try these things. Merry Christmas

wow!! this is amazing! i followed the recipe as is, with no substitutions. it tastes great, the cake has a wonderful finish and the semifreddo is an amazing accompaniment. refreshing, chocolate bliss. this is a keeper. the only problem is the low yield, the 8 inch loaf doesn't serve too many guests. this is worth the time and effort to double.

This cake was fabulous! It isn't as hard or involved as it looks. I also used a 1/2 sheet pan and it worked out fine. I should have used more malt powder and will the next time. My guests insisted it is the best chocolate cake I have made and I've tried many on this site (I put it in my top 10).

We were treated to this dessert last week and loved it. It makes a great presentation with good flavor. The malt was a nice, subtle surprise. I expect I'll also be making this cake in the near future.

Great recipe - just a few changes. Use a 1/2 sheet pan (I couldn't find any pan that measured 15 x 10). Also, for the cake, melting the chocolate in a metal bowl over boiling water will make it easier to cool the chocolate since a bowl will hold less heat than a saucepan and there is less risk of scorching. Use at least 1/2 cup malt powder for the semifreddo. For the egg mixture, if you have a kitchen-aid- whisk the egg mixture in the kitchen aid bowl over boiling water until it reaches 160 degrees. Put the bowl in the mixer and beat the egg mixture on high speed with the whisk attachment until it's cool (less risk of curdling the mixture). It tasted great and is worth the effort.
