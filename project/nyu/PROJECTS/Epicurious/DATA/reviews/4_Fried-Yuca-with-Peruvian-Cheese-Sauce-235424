Great recipe! Decided to just use Trader Joe's Cassava Chips but I've been looking for a great dip for them. Peruvian food is always so delicious and flavorful so this was great.

I made the huancaina after having some at a local restaurant. We served it over oven roasted potatoes, and it was tasty. I am going to use to it to top potato enchiladas next.

I have always loved the huancaina. I like it a little thinner than the recipe called for, so I followed the Cook´s suggestion and added more half and half. I used the leftover sauce (I had some leftover sauce because I put some aside in the fridge before I served it :) ) on baked potatoes. Very good.
