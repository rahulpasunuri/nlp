Lindy227's review is called splitting hairs...

A banana naturally splits into three long triangular strips. These I would call "banana splits" and the sundae made with these split strips a "banana split sundae." This recipe calls for splitting the banana into halves. This is not possible. Tory probably means to slice the banana in half, longways. This common preparation for a banana sundae to "cut" the banana length ways into two long "slices" should not be called a "banana split."

I served these as the finale to a cajun dinner - with jambalaya as the main course. They were fantastic! We enjoyed them the next day as well. To "toast" the pound cake, I buttered each slice and browned it in a frying pan - sort of like french toast. Yum

P.S. Should have given this 4 forks!

I hid one loaf of Coconut and Macadamia Nut Bread (also on this site- made with 1 xtra banana, no nuts) in the freezer for this recipe and made a bunch of these exquisitely divine desserts for one of my daughter's monster sleepovers. Just doing this review makes my mouth water!
