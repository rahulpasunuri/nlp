Really terrific...simple and easy, delicate but with a nice elegance, especially with the silkiness of the black cod. I used fresh shiitakes instead of chanterelles and they were great; a bit more of an Asian touch. Also used the specific amount of lemon juice per an earlier review and it seemed just right. And I seasoned the fish with flakes of sea salt. Need a nice savory side to make the plate 'pop'.

Definitely not the best preparation for cod that I've tried. It was a decent dish but I would have preferred using a Chinese recipe for black cod instead.

One BIG change, my black cod fillets were skinless so I reduced cooking time to 15 minutes from the recommended 20 and this is a real winner. Served on a bed of fresh watercress and penne. The fish was perfectly cooked and the whole dish was fantastic.

This was a super easy preparation and tasted great. Substituted baby bella mushrooms in lieu of chantarelles (next time I will try chantarelles). Skipped the lemon rind all together.Will make again!

Used red snapper fillet instead of black cod, and it turned out pretty well. Because the red snapper did not have its skin, we lined the baking dish with parchment paper which worked out beautifully (thanks to my husband's idea) so that the fish wouldn't stick to the bottom of the baking dish. Chanterelles are expensive but worth using it if it's available.

Excellent and easy! I added thyme to the parsley, used a mix of mushrooms from the farmer's market and omitted the parmesan. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and served it with snap peas (that I sauteed and tossed with butter, lemon and sea salt). The deliciousness belied the simplicity! I'll make it again.

black cod is very expensive so I used regular cod I also used oyster muchrooms because I had them and they were good, but they are also expensive

So good and so easy! I've made this many times and it always turns out great. If you can't find chanterelles, oyster mushrooms work just as well. However, my boyfriend hates mushrooms, so I make his without, and he still thinks it's delicious.

I was able to get most of the ingredients at the farmer's market where chanterelles were about $15 or $16/pound, and black cod was just caught. I put in more than 1 teaspoon lemon juice and that was a mistake, I'll measure next time, its not hard to overwhelm the delicate flavors. The textures were dreamy though.

We thought this was good but not outstanding. I served with roasted tomatoes so maybe they overwhelmed the delicate flavour. I would make again and it certainly was easy. I think another time I would serve with sauteed snow peas and I might add some thyme to add to the flavors.

Living in the Pacific Northwest makes Chantrelles very accessible so I followed the recipe except I used mushrooms we'd gathered and frozen last fall. My husband and I both loved this recipe. I wouldn't change a thing! It's quick and easy and healthy, too!

I subbed portabello's for thrift's sake and wasn't thrilled with the result. If I had to do it again, I'd add a reduction sauce to drizzle after the baking b/c the fish was missing something.

This was simple and delicious! I couldn't find black cod so I used regular cod. I also substituted shiitakes for the chanterelles. Made it exactly as is with those ingredients and it came out perfect. The mushroom mixture on top of the fish was fantastic.

had to come up with something to do with cod with what I had in the house this worked fine with cremini mushrooms, chives along with parsley ( I was short of parsley)Romano instead of parmesan. used sliced tomatoes under fish, as it was skinless. I found 15-17 minute worked fine Everyone asked me to make it again.

Wonder of wonders, I found FRESH chanterelles. What a fantastic recipe to show case these golden funghi. My only change was to use grouper, no black cod in sight. God willing I will be able to find chanterelles again and make this dish for a NYE dinner party. If not, I'll do what the first reviewer did and use shitakes. Yum.

This was terrific. I'm not sure it would serve 6 but more like 4 to 5. The chanterelles were ridiculously expensive (39.99/lb) and not looking too great, so i went with shitakies with were wonderfully earthy. Served it with couscous and sauteed swiss chard, a quick & healthy dinner.
