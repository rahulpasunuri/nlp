Delicious lava cakes, but I think I prefer a recipe that calls for a small amount of flour. The baked outer part of this cake had a slightly odd texture, I think because there was no flour to add structure.

Yum and yum! I couldn't get this recipe to work at first, but then I changed the oven temperature to 450 and it worked like a charm! I used cocoa powder instead of flour--beautiful! And as recommended by someone else, I included a Lindt Hazelnut truffle in the middle and what a pleasant surprise!

was really looking for the liquid coffee amount for the whipped cream addition. It doesn't mention that little ditty...;-( I can obviously figure it out, but it should tell you.

This was an excellent dessert. I am far from an expert baker or cook and was able to pull this off. You just need to follow the directions exactly. I do wish I had checked the cakes at about 9 minutes as I wish it had baked a bit less. The center was not liquid, but more like a thick pudding. Tasty, though! A little tip-- put a bit of powdered baking cocoa in with the flour. That way you do not have a white residue on the outside of your cakes.

I am still searching for the perfect chocolate lava cake, that really pours the "lava". This was my second effort, better than the first, but the melted chocolate in the center was only warm, not hot, after 13 minutes in the oven. I am wondering if there is a way to make the outside cooked and the inside hot, ?microwave for a bit? Has anyone tried this?

This was more of an undercooked chocolate soufflé than a lava cake.

This was soooo good, and really easy. The coffee custard is excellent - don't leave it out! I would actually eat the coffee custard all by itself...

I made this for Valentine's day, using Earth Balance margarine, because one of my guests was gluten and dairy intolerant. I also substituted a raspberry coulis for the coffee custard sauce. It was outstanding, and got rave reviews from all guests.

One of the best dessert recipe's out there. I make this Lava cake all the time, topped off with some vanilla bean ice cream and it's heaven. FYI you might have to play the baking time a little to get it just right.

This is a really great recipe for just the cake it's self. Chocolate lava cake is such a versatile cake, you an do anything with it!

Very delicious!!! Will definately make again. I didn't make the sauce. Reminds me of the lava cake from Roy's Restaurant, which I love! Next time I will have to make some vanilla ice cream to go with it.

I liked these, but felt they would pair better with plain or slightly sweetened whipped cream and raspberries rather than the coffee sauce, which I did make. The coffee sauce is delicious, but does not provide any contrast b/c it's the same texture, consistency and sweetness as the cake, so the result is just Rich and Richer. I got the lava effect but the cakes did not invert cleanly. Tasted great tho. Husband and kids loved it.

After reading the rave reviews I expected these to be real show- stoppers. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but just about anything chocloate is good, and I was hoping these would be better than good. The recipe was easy, but they took longer to cook than I expected (almost 13 minutes) and the cake's texture was still a little soft for me. I guess I was looking for something a little more like other molten cakes I've had: a firm dense cake surrounding a molten center. I'll keep looking for that perfect recipe.

The cakes were great but the coffee custard was unbelievable. I'll make that for brownies and other chocolate cakes since it complemented the lava cakes so well.

this is delicious and almost as easy as boxed brownies. i used the microwave instead of a dbl boiler and calbault chocolate chips instead of chopping.

Made this for my family as a test before offering it to clients. Went over with rave reviews... Very easy and very classy. Easy to double as well, versatile, and already requested for Christmas dessert~

I have tried every one of the molten chocolate lava cakes and this one whips the others by miles! The chocolate taste is more pronounced, more velvety, more luscious... Mmmm! The only improvement I'd suggest is to decrease the cooking time to about 8 mins.

Pure chocolate indulgence. Leave room for desert because one serving is quite rich. Skipped the coffee aspect of the custard and added vanilla bean instead. There was leftover sauce which tasted divine the next morning on waffles with fresh raspberries.

I used bernard callebaut chocolate - it melted nicely. I didnt have custard cups, used small disposable tin cups. Cooked about 10 mins - it was too long -the 'lava' was non existent. Regardless, I didn't think much of the flavour - didn' have that super rich texture or quality. I wouldnt do again.

Wonderful! But beware: is best if made from start to finish all at once. A good shortcut to take is melting chocolate and butter in the microwave, but once you start, you must finish. We made the yolk/chocolate bit before dinner, and completed with whites after, but it did not fold easily and required extra softening before combining with a not quite right texture to the batter. While it came out ok, it wasn't a time savings in the end -- just grab your ingredients before dinner and assemble in toto after -- scrumptious!

This was an outstanding recipe. As long as you pay attention to the details you can't go wrong, and it's very quick. I actually just made the cakes, not the coffee cream. It was great on it's own. Many lava cake recipes have way too much butter in them (1 1/2 sticks for 6 people, ugh!). This one has a smaller amount, but the quality isn't affected at all. A must make if you are looking for a quick and fancy dessert.

I've been looking for a recipe like this ever since we went to Roy's on our honeymoon. (they have this awesome chocolate souffle dish) I wanted to make something similar. This was perfect, my husband said, "This is just like that dessert from Roys." The cake is rich and perfect for chocolate lovers

An amazing dish- simple enough to turn out perfectly for a rookie like myself, and a brilliantly tasty and impressive end result. I served it with home-made raspberry gelato, and the combination was wonderful. My only complaint is that it was so rich as to make me feel slightly ill!

Wow. These are fabulous, and so easy. I used just good-quality chocolate chips. Made them the evening before and refrigerated them, and cooked for a couple of minutes extra. I did not use the sauce, I served with whipped cream and berries. I will absolutely make this dessert anytime I need a show-stopper!

Intense chocolate cake that is super easy to make. I've never make the coffee custard sauce and found the cakes were great with just whipped cream or ice cream. Definitely repeat.

This hits the serious Chocolate Nerve 100%! Next time will make the Coffee Sauce. I added a Hazelnut, Lindt "lindor truffle" in the center of the batter! Sheer ecstasy. :-) Lindor Truffles come in other flavors, like Mint & Milk Chocolate. Small round truffle ball wrapped in foil, perfect for this dessert.

A perfect dessert - warmy, gooey, decadent and easy to make! Even heated up the next day the center was still "lava-y".

I like easy recipes that have great culinary impact. This is both very easy to bake and is unique enough for that amazing wow factor. Even if you over bake it it's still very good. Serve with ice cream or by itself both are just as tastey.

This was a real stunner. I didn't make the coffee custard, but used vanilla ice cream with a shot of brandy on top. Also, I dusted the cups with cocoa. It was a great holiday dish and the portions were perfect. My husband loved it and has requested I make it again for his birthday in January.

I made this as part of a celebration meal for a family member who returned from a long trip overseas. Huge, huge success! The cakes turned out perfectly: firm (but tender) outside around a gooey chocolate center. The baking time was perfect for my oven, although if your oven is different, watch the cakes carefully. Too long in the oven would make for delicious cakes that were cooked through...no lava. As a previous reviewer pointed out, these cakes can be made a few hours ahead and kept in the fridge until time to bake. And, choose your chocolate carefully, this is the time to make sure you use only the best.

Decadent, easy, quick. Gooey center and lightly crusty top: does it get any better? You could pair this with any accompaniment; I used coconut sorbet to finish off a tropically-themed dinner, but you could top this with any sauce, ice cream, or other topping and have an instant success. The "mmm"s at my dessert table were neverending...Do watch these carefully to avoid overbaking, though: mine went from totally underdone to very slightly overdone in three minutes.

I accidentally slightly undercooked this (chocolate lava pancakes?) but everyone (from age 3 to 38) was too busy licking their plates clean to notice. I used Ghiradelli semisweet chocolate and served with both plain and coffee custard and whipped cream. Will be fun to try with different brands of chocolate in the future. Yum!

This is so easy to make early in the day and pull them out of the fridge 10 to 15 minutes before you want to bake them. And 10 minutes later you have an amazing dessert that your guests think you slaved over!

I am totally addicted to these things. I make a whole batch of batter, fill the custard cups, but I only bake what I want to eat. Put the others in the fridge and back them as needed. You can have this dessert every night! I don't bother with the custard -- just spray on the whipped cream.

I made these for a Christmas dinner party, using regular ole' chocolate chips. I baked the cakes 25 minutes and let them rest only 1 minute before removing from the cups--perfect! Divine lava spilled right out. I served them with ice cream to rave reviews, although I would have liked the custard myself.

I made this with Bakers semi sweet chocolate and it was excellent! After only letting them sit 1 minute they came out and fell apart. When I waited 5 minutes, they held their shape and had a better presentation. I served with mixed berries and whipped cream. Next time I'll try the custard.

Yum! (and easy too!) A great gluten-free recipe for celiacs (assuming you dust the cups with something other than wheat flour - like rice flour) and can you easily substitute margarine for butter for those with dairy allergies too. That's what we did and it turned our great! Highly recommended.

Like most other reviewers, I have to agree that this is an excellent show-stopping recipe for chocoholics. My favorite chocoholic is coming over for her birthday dinner tonight and she said she wouldn't show if this wasn't on the menu.

Very easy to make. Made it about 4 hours ahead of time and then baked them when last guest arrived. Delicious but very rich - esp. with a raspberry sauce and ice cream. Was able to get the "lava" but wasn't sure if it was supposed to be more a sauce or pudding consistency. I think I might try freezing the cakes beforehand to see if that makes the lava more saucier. It was definitely a dessert for chocolate lovers.

I thought this recipe was very easy and they make a nice presentation. The sauce is absolutely delicious! Highly recommended.

Great. Don't think the amount of sauce is excessive, we were spooning it right out of the saucepan before the lava cakes were even in the oven. Don't overcook the lava cakes (or no lava!).

Lots of work, but without a doubt, restaurant-quality and the most highly-complimented dessert I've ever made. People also loved the Coffee Custard Sauce and said it was a must-have. (FYI, the Coffee Custard Sauce recipe makes about 2x to 3x as much sauce as you need for these cakes.) The cakes didn't come out of the cups very easily at first, but waiting longer definitely helped. When you flour the cups, make sure you butter evenly and shake out every last bit of flour so that the coating is thin and even! Watch the oven; if you overbake, no lava... if you underbake, then the cakes will fall apart and the lava will not be completely contained within the cake.

This was a huge hit for guests. It really wasn't as much work as I thought. I made it a little easier by using semi-sweet chocolate chips and melting them in the microwave with the butter and salt. I also prepared it hours before I baked it. I just covered it and kept it in the refrigerator. I served it with an easy raspberry sauce. I simmered 10oz frozen raspberries with 2 tablespoons sugar and then added 2 tablespoons Frangelico. I then pureed the mixture in a food processor. Delicious!

Very delicious and easy to make. Instead of the coffe custard sauce, I used a pureed rasberry sauce so it looked more like "lava". Will make again and again.

This dessert was so rich, I couldn't finish it but that doesn't mean it wasn't worth it! These cakes were a big hit and everyone wanted seconds. I ended up making another batch right away. The custard sauce was a hit as well. It's a bit time consuming; that I will agree. I did have some trouble getting the cakes out of the custard cups but after waiting 5 minutes instead of 1 minute, they fell right out in one piece.

Simply the best!! I have made these four times per my husbands request in the past 2 weeks. I've made them at least four hours ahead and they bake up delicious. My husband in fact reheated one the following day, and the consistancy was still good. This ranks as a favorite if you like chocolate. Have not tried the sauce yet. We serve it with coffee ice cream.

Although time consuming, this dessert is fabulous. I'm not a big chocolate fan, but the chocolate is not overpowering in this dish. The coffee custard is divine. A perfect company dessert.

I love this recipe and am making it again this evening. It received rave reivews at a dinner party and was the perfect ending as it was easy to make and a suprisingly light finish to a summer dinner. I made rasberry sauce instead of the caramel and it was an excellent complement.

I've made this several times, and it's fabulous. I've never tried making the entire batter ahead of time, but I have made it in advance to the point just before the egg whites are whipped and added, which works fine. I also make the custard sauce a day or two ahead. Take care not to overbake these or... no lava!

Quite delicious and decadent. The coffe custard sauce is a lovely addition. Time consuming but when made ahead the lava cakes bake up quite nicely. I have served this numerous times to rave reviews.
