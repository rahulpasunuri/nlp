Using what I had available, I used toasted sesame oil instead of walnut (not a full half cup-I mixed in some olive oil for the dressing and used olive oil to cook the nuts and cheese). I used pecans instead of walnuts, and mixed 50/50 greens for the salad. I only had one pear instead of two and it was plenty. I made this recipe for my husband and I for dinner as the main course, so it was 2 plates not 4. It was OUTSTANDING!

Company Worthy! This is a great salad with a lovely presentation and complex flavors. I used panko and fresh thyme for the goat cheese crumb. I also used an herbed goat cheese because that is what I had on hand. If you can find walnut oil, it is worth the trouble. It adds to the complexity. I also used English walnuts. Will definitely repeat.

The fried goat cheese slices, which I refer to as nuggets of delicious, were wonderful. I also like that the dressing was not overpowering so you get the full flavor of the walnuts, pears, and greens. I will definitely be making this regularly.

This was a big hit. We had just perfect Harry and David pears. I used a bit less dressing, and used panko crumbs. Did the walnut oil, but i think a good vegetable oil would work.

This was excellent tossed with arugala. I added some warm goat cheese and toasted pine nuts and my husband and I were in heaven. I did decrease the amount of olive oil and increased the lemon juice as that is the way a restaurant near us prepares their lemon vinaigrette.

Cool! I am so stoked that I found this recipe! My magazine copy is long gone, but through the magic of the net here we are. I made this nine years ago-- newly married, and just back from France with a fair ammount of wine stowed in our bags. I made this for friends and served it with a white Cote du Rhone that I hand-carried back from France to Montana. My wife is still talking about that dinner...AND this salad.

Fantastic! I love the walnut oil. And the fresh breadcrumbs were a fun addition. Way better than the purchased kind. I used candied walnuts and a combination of red pears and apple pears, and it was a huge hit for a dinner party. This will be my 'go to' recipe.

Very good but not great salad.

I thought the walnut oil was too earthy tasting and made for a drab dressing. I think I choose a poor goat cheese or again cooking in the walnut oil may have made it taste funny. Could just have been me...

This is a GREAT salad recipe, and very easy too! It was such a hit at my dinner party, that guests insisted it make a repeat performance the following Friday night. Everyone loved it!! Two thoughts I have: I would add a little more tyme to the bread crumbs. Also, I found that by using the pre-seasoned goat cheese, it gave it a bit more flavoring throughout, rather than seasoning it myself.)

I really liked this salad, but thought the dressing lacked a little something. I used asian pear and dried bread crumbs and it was great. I think I'll try it again with cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. The goat cheese was wonderful, thyme seems to be such a good match for it. Also, I toasted the walnuts in advance and used fresh oil for the cheese, as it looked like there were some particles that would burn if cooked again.

I took this recipe to my monthly Supper Club. It was a smashing success. When making it, I thought the dressing looked a bit thick, but it was so light and the perfect accompaniment for the goat cheese and pears! You've got to try this recipe.

DELICIOUS! Of course you need to be a fan of goat cheese to enjoy, but if you are---what a treat. My husband liked it so much, he asked if we can have it on a regular basis. There's just the two of us, so I did half the recipe for the dressing and worked out perfect.

Wonderful for everyday or entertaining. Have used with numerous kinds of goat cheese and all have been great.

This recipe is beyond words - never have I had a better goat cheese salad! Don't overcook the cheese as it will melt and lose it's shape. Any soft goat cheese will do - I used one packaged in narrow cylinders, when sliced the size was perfect.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. The only change I made was that I used candied walnuts, and grilled the goat cheese in olive oil instead of walnut oil. Its delicious!!!

I made this as part of our Valentine's dinner this year, and it was wonderful. My husband said "this takes salad to a whole new level" and I agree. It would make a nice light meal, with bread and soup (or the stuffed mushrooms w/ 2 cheeses we had as an appetizer ~ from Bon Appetit, I think Jan 2002).

Made this for guests - everyone raved. Because I'm too lazy to make fresh breadcrumbs, I used panko, and it turned out perfectly. Also, because the dressing smelled odd (we suspect our walnut oil had gone rancid) I substituted a balsamic vinagrette at the last minute. We'll make this one again and again.

You know that you've got a winner when you hear about how good a dish was from the friends of folks who were at your dinner party!!! I candied the walnuts using the Bon Appetit (Dec 2000)"Candied Walnut" recipe, roasted the pears, substituted balsamic vinegar for the white wine vinegar, and reduced the amount of goat cheese. I used 8 ounces of goat cheese (2 rounds each) for 6 people and it was just the right amount. I recommend tasting the dressing; I added a touch of sugar and a bit more balsamic and mustard. This was the absolute hit of my Christmas dinner!!!

My husband and I have made this recipe twice. We substituted granny smith apples, because we don't like pears. We also tried baking the goat cheese and it works just as well. We absolutely love this and cannot wait to serve it to friends!

What a winner! Followed the recipe except used candied walnuts. This is as good as any salad you can make.

Borrowing this dressing, improvised using romaine lettuce, pear tomatoes and baked Montrachet cheese rounds coated with pistachios: INCREDIBLE!

This is a really great salad! I use field mix greens and bosc pears. Between the fruit, smooth cheese, and crunchy nuts contrasted with the walnutty mustard, you'd be hard pressed to taste something better in a restaurant. In fact, we haven't yet. I've made this one a ton, and even my husband, who's not fond of salads, loves it.

I first made this for a friend's mother who was in from Dallas. I used Asian pears (because I couldn't find any nice regular ones) and mixed greens. She raved about it to anyone who would listen for months and had to have the recipe. Use any kind of greens (baby spinach is good too). Today made it with mandarin oranges along with Asian pear. Its very good in any combination

This recipe is wonderful. It reminded my guests and I of the salads we get in Burgundy, France. It's a matter of personal preference, but I don't like my dressing that oily so I doubled the mustard and vinegar and added a pinch of sugar. Everyone loved it and asked me to make it again.

This is my all time favorite salad. I use the recipe for the croutons. Don't be alarmed when you flip them and the shell cracks and you see the cheese. It will turn out fine. I also use carmelized pecans and oil with basalimic vinegar. It is the best.

The salad is great and we will definitely make it again. Though next time, I'll try using balsamic vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar. I think it would make it a bit less acidic and much smoother tasting.

I have enjoyed this type of salad at several restaurants and never imagined it would be this easy to prepare at home. I candied the walnuts by sauteeing them in sugar. I also added a small amount of sugar to the vinegarette to make it a bit sweeter. We loved it so much we made a meal of it!

This dish was an absolutly elegant accompaniment to our Christmas dinner. We served it with the herb coated Lamb with Port red wine sauce. We cut down on the goat cheese croutons since not all guests like goat chesse. But those who do loved it! This salad will be a tradition to our Christmas meal!

This was a terrific tangy salad. My boyfriend ate his own and then someone else's at a dinner party.
