We have made the shrimp several times and always get rave reviews from our friends. For individual servings we used medium shrimp and put them in four ounce canning jars after pickling for easy passed hors d'oeuvres.

We made the entire menu from which this came for Christmas Eve. Phenomenal! Cooked the shrimp for 1 1/2 minutes as to not overcook and cooled in an ice bath. Also, we took the tails off and served over greens with rustic bread. Big hit!

I was brave enough to make this for a brunch. Displayed in a glass bowl, it made a beautiful presentation and was the one dish my guests still talk about. It's a bit of work, but really, really outstanding. I had no problems with toughness of the shrimp or bad texture.

I made these for an appetizer before Christmas dinner. While it was nice that I could make it all completely ahead of time, the flavor wasn't really there for us. I let them soak in the pickling sauce for 4 hours. The leftovers the next day were more flavorful, but the texture was bad. I wouldn't bother with these again.

I make cold cooked shrimp a lot so I had high hopes for this. The pickling mixture smelled wonderful but the finished product was not worth the effort. The shrimp were tough and rubbery and the taste was just okay. I was very careful with the amount of time needed to cook the shrimp as I always am knowing they continue to cook even after they are out of the cooking liquid. So if you decide to make these or any other shrimp dish, be VERY careful not to overcook; it happens before you realize it. Don't know what happened to these but I won't be making them again.

This dish was absolutely outstanding. Best shrimp I have ever eaten! The flavors came together beautifully to highlight the shrimp. I can't stop thinking about it! Great with a sparkling wine.

This dish was brought to my holiday party by a neighbor who is known for delicious new dishes. My first thought was that the flavor of the shrimp would be lost in the pickling spices and vinegar. It was light, tangy and the pickled flavors were surprisingly not too overbearing. It was the first dish to go!!
