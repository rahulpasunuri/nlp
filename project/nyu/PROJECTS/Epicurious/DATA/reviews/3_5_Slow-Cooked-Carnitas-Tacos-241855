This is slow-cooked pork, but it's not carnitas! Carnitas has to be finished in a hot oven or pan in order to get browned and crispy in its own fat! The pork in this recipe is more like gray dishrags.

Great recipe. The only thing is that all of the flavors didn't get absorbed into the meat so I used the leftover broth (I had added a can of beer and chicken broth to the pot) and reduced it to make a sauce to mix back in the meat after it was shredded. It was incredible.

This is a go-to recipe in our house with these modifications: no salt (it doesn't seem to need it) and when in a hurry we often rub the entire shoulder with oregano and cook (do not cut into pieces). Then shred and mix with bbq sauce for pulled pork sandwiches. We lived with 4 "kids" age 17 to 26 this summer and it was on the weekly menu. The students took the recipe, a crock pot, and a frozen pork shoulder back to school with them.

I really liked this recipe, but only AFTER following everyone else's suggestions(decreasing salt, adding broth to slow cooker, upping the quantity of all the other spices and letting the meat marinate overnight with the "dry rub"). This is our go to recipe for taco night, and every time I can get boneless country pork ribs on sale! Also, the linked tomatillo salsa is the perfect addition.

This recipe is superbly easy and I just upped it to 6 pounds of meat for a party. I did make a few changes. I cut the salt and pepper in half (one teaspoon each for two pounds of meat). I added a teaspoon of cumin for each two pounds of meat. I kept the oregano at 2 teaspoons for two pounds of meat. I used pork shoulder country style boneless ribs. I trimmed some of the excess fat off, but left a lot too. After about 4 hours I took most of the liquid out with a baster (though I don't know if this was necessary.) I cooked it a few more hours. Here is what I recommend to finish. Remove all the liquid at the end of the cooking time with a baster. Remove onions and shred the meat and continue to cook with the lid off until the meat has reached your preferred dryness. (This will only work if you have a lot more time...one to two hours...which I understand is not always realistic.) Or, fry up batches in a cast iron skillet before serving. Otherwise, they are too moist for what I am used to (I live in the southwest). Now, I am going to try to make some rice using the broth. Should be interesting.

Yum! I used regular oregano and it was great. I don't care for cilantro, so I deleted that. I added just a touch of red pepper flakes for heat. Really great.

This is a great starting point for the recipe. Building on the hard work and insight of others on this review board, I also added some chicken stock, cumin, fresh garlic, and increased the amount of onion. And what I think elevates this from a merely good dish to a great one is taking the cooked pork and cooking it in a cast iron pan to give it a little bit of crispiness. I love this dish, as so many slow cooker dishes don't really save me that much time between browning meat, deglazing the pan, etc. This one literally takes me 10 minutes or less to put into the slow cooker (trimming the ribs, slicing the onion, putting in the spices). Please note that I don't even cut the pork into pieces--you can skip that entirely as the pork falls apart with a spatula later on. last I make this into a burrito, using a whole grain tortilla, fresh avocado, adding some canned black beans, and some higher-end store bought salsa (e.g., Casa Sanchez). This is definitely going to be a weekly or bi-weekly staple for our family. Even my 2.5 year old daughter likes the meat...

I changed it up a bit to try to fit in a low fat diet. I used pork tenderloin instead and added in 4 bell peppers. I also added some cumin and coriander. I used corn tortillas, store bought salsa verde, fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lime on each taco. It was very good for a slow cooker weeknight meal.

I made this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it. Said it might just be the best carnitas he's had yet. I did use the exact measurements with salt and pepper, just added to lightly season the meat. I used just a touch of regular dried oregano and added some fresh garlic a little cayenne pepper and some paprika and cilantro. Turned out great. Definitely making this one again.

This was excellent and very easy. I reduced the salt to 1 tsp. I think I would reduce the black pepper next time. I added 1 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and 1/2 c low sodium chicken broth. Could not find Mexican oregano. Will definitely make this again.

This is my new favorite slow cooker recipe--it's unbelievably good and so easy. I cut the salt in half as others suggested, added 1 1/2 tsp of cumin for 3 lbs of meat, and tossed in some chopped garlic. I added thinly sliced onions in the last hour and that was just the right amount of time so they didn't get too mushy. Cooking time was 7 hours and by then the pork practically fell apart on its own. It probably would have been done sooner but my son kept opening the lid to take in the aroma. I used Frontera Grill Roasted Tomatillo Salsa just to make life easier. I also offered queso fresco since I happened to have some left over from another meal, and it was a nice addition. This is a definite keeper and I can think of all kinds of events where it would be very well received. I can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow!

Easy and delicious! I doubled the recipe using a 4 lb. pork shoulder roast (blade in, no less!) and didn't even bother to cut it up... after 6 to 8 hours on high, the meat had fallen off the bone and shredded easily with two forks. I did cut the salt slightly, though, and used about 1 tbl. for the 4 lb. roast.

This might be the most simple dish I have ever made, and it was delicious. DH ate 6 tacos and put it in the top five list of the best things I've ever made... and I make a lot of things! It is definitely in the permanent rotation. I used country style pork ribs and added just a bit (1/4 cup, maybe) of chicken broth and 2 smashed cloves of garlic. To the dry rub, I added cumin, which I can't imagine it without, and cayenne pepper for some spice. Served with lime, cilantro, sour cream, and raw onions as garnish. I didn't make the tomatillo salsa and certainly didn't miss it, but I will add it in the future!

This was absolutely marvelous! I sliced a whole onion into thicker slices, added it to start and did not remove them after cooking as they added flavor and "melted" nicely. I used a 4 lb pork shoulder roast, trimmed off as much fat as possible, and added only about a 1/4 cup of beef broth. Next time, I will double the amount of meat for a full pot!

Excellent flavor and very easy to make. After only two hours in the crock pot the pork just fell apart and was scrumptious. I didn't notice the saltiness until the next day. I only used 1t of salt and it still was too much for me. No one complained thou of it tasting too salty. Husband loved it. Makes great leftovers on warm corn tortillas w/ the green chile salsa.

Extremely easy and very yummy recipe. We made tacos, burritos, eggs & carnitas, salads - it was that good...I wanted to put it on everything! Added cumin powder on the second batch and they turned out great. I highly recommend pan frying the meat (no oil needed) to get a nice crispy crust on the meat!

you will be amazed that something this easy turns out so mouth-watering good. I used some pork loin chops that I had gotten on sale (and had come out tough on a grill) and cooked them overnite in the slow cooker for a tailgate feast the next morning. So so good! I've made it twice since, and plan to make it again for our next 49er outing.

Excellent and so easy! I used about 3 pounds boneless country style ribs and cut off the fat as I cut it into cubes -- ended up with 2 pound of lean meat. 2 tsp of salt was a little too much -- next time I'll try 1 tsp. Hard to believe it could be so very flavorful with just salt, pepper, oregano and onion as seasonings, but it was perfect! Using the crockpot makes it the perfect warm weather meal.

I just made this the other night and it was great. Carnitas are my boyfriend's favorite and he loved these. I did follow the other reviews about adding garlic and cumin. I will say that both of these are a must. The recipe is easy, simple to follow and comes out tasting great.

This was very good and easy to make!! I added 1 T cumin plus some chipotle powder. My 13 year old loved it. I would have rated it higher, but it had too much salt, and I did make adjustments to the recipe based on info I read here. I would use 1/2 tsp of salt (or less). I cooked it in the tomatillo sauce before I served it.

I've made this several times for large groups and it is easy and impressive. I use pork loin because it is less marbled and I prefer the lower fat version. I typically make a salsa fresca as well for a little heat, as the tomatillo salsa is more tangy than spicy.

I should start this review by saying that I'm generally NOT a fan of slow- cooker recipes. But this was great. Here's the thing though: You HAVE to dress these tacos like a proper carnitas taco, the way the recipe says to. Use a SOFT corn tortilla, fill it with carnitas, top with avocado slices, minced red onion, fresh cilantro leaves, and a squeeze of lime wedge. This recipe was delicious and I will definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
This is a simple, but very tasty recipe and we make it at least once a month. My wife grew up in LA and always orders carnitas when we eat at Mexican restaurants, but she swears these are the best she has ever eaten. Personal tastes may cause others to disagree. I use 3-5 lbs. of pork butt (called Boston Butt in Savannah) and increase the spices to 3 tsp. each of Kosher salt, ground pepper and whole oregano. One tsp. of cumin is a must! After tossing the meat with the spices, I cook on high in the slow cooker for about two hours and then add 1/2-1 cup of water. Stir occasionally. Continue to cook on High until nearly done and then reduce to Low. Total cooking time is 5-6 hours. Strain and freeze or refrigerate the broth to use as a soup base such as Albondigas.

Simply succulent, tantalizingly tender, perfect pork. This is one of the best tasting pork dishes I've ever made. I was concerned because I had never used the crockpot without adding liquid at the beginning of the cook time, but my fears were unfounded. The only change I made to the recipe was the addition of cumin as suggested by other reviewers. I started with a 4.5 lb Boston butt roast and cut it into fairly large chunks, tossed them with the spices and placed in the crock. I did this the night before and refrigerated the crock overnight which I think really helped develop the flavors. The next morning I put it on low and about 7 1/2 hours later I had the most tender, succulent, flavorful meat that almost shredded itself at the sight of the forks. Leftovers the next night were even better than the first night. I'm going to make this for company. So easy, so versatile and so so good.

Rating: 4
I just made the meat exactly as specified. Very easy and fast. You need no liquid, as it cooks in the fat of the pork. Next time I would trim the fat but include it in the pot, so you cook with it, but it is easy to discard when serving.

We like highly seasoned food, so this seemed a bit tame to us, but our parents, who don't like "hot" food really enjoyed this. It definitely helps to have some flavorful salsas and toppings to add to the meat. The leftovers were tasty, too.

All I can say is holy cow! Or pork, as the case may be. We hurt ourselves we ate so much, this is going in the regular rotation. Definitely use a fatty cut of pork, and I don't think any stock is necessary. I used ribs, because they were on sale, and cut them down just so they fit into the bowl. Kept the onion in, just cut in half (I'm not home during the day, so can't add it 3 hours before we eat), and added 1 tsp cumin, 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1 tsp red pepper flakes, and a whole dried ancho chili. Served this with the Southwestern Black Bean and Hominy Salad from this site (you need to look up this recipe right now) for a healthy side. Really really good, and a great way to eat economically.

I used about 3 pounds of the boneless country-style ribs which had very little fat -- maybe too little -- and didn't cut them into chunks, as I planned on cooking them longer than the recipe called for. I added about 3/4 C. of stock to the Crock pot, then used 1 tsp each of salt, cumin and Greek oregano. I used about a 1/2 tsp of pepper (kids). As suggested, I added relatively thick onion ring halves with about 2 hours cooking time still to go and served them with the meat (they were great, too). I think i got overly complacent about how Crock Pots never ruin anything and so let them cook longer, on low, by about 2 hours; it was too long. They were dry, but still very tasty. I wouldn't make this again without the addition of cumin and the decreased kosher salt/pepper/oregano. Next time I'll get the pork shoulder, leave the fat on, and cook it for the appropriate amount of time. I may also add a can of stewed tomatoes instead of stock.

Rating: 2
I found this to be a good starting point for this recipe. Like others, to give it an authentic Mexican flavor, I added cumin, finely diced garlic and two broken, dried chili peppers along with the limited oregano for seasoning flavor. I also cut the salt in half. If you soak a cup of any kind of dried beans over night, you can throw them in there as well with about 3/4 cup stock of your choice to make it even more substantial and even a little healthy! I would not waste your onion. Do as a previous reviewer suggested and add them a little later and make them part of your taco.

Let me first say that I am not a fan of pork-usually. HOWEVER, this recipe is truly transcendental. The flavors of the meat are simple yet rich.

We add crumbled queso fresco on each taco as well. Delicious!!

This is FANTASTIC! I made two small changes - 1. I added a bit of OJ in the beginning 2. I forgot the onions and added them in the last 45 minutes. The 2 change actually turned out great because we used the softened onions in our tacos! This whole thing is easy and delicious! So glad we bought a 5 lb-er and have 2.5 leftover in the freezer!

Fantastic! I used a 4.5 lb pork roast, so I upped the cooking time to 7 hours to compensate and added 1/2 cup beef broth. I also added cumin and garlic powder as some reviewers recommended and subbed dried basil for the oregano because it's what I had. The meat was fragrant and basically shredded itself - I barely had to use a fork. A note though: I only used about 2 tsb of salt (even with that much pork), and it was on the salty side, but by no means too much so.

This is an exceptionally easy and tasty recipe. The salsa is wonderful, although very mild. I sub jalapenos and leave a few seeds in to add some spice. To serve we put a corn tortilla in a dry pan, top with shredded mexican cheese, cover and heat until the cheese is melted and the tortilla is starting to crisp. Top with pork, salsa and avacado slices. This is a meal the kids and the adults crave and ask for and it is so easy. Makes great leftovers.

Like another reviewer, I tried the Carnitas recipe from the Bon Appetit website from Table Fifty-two but cooked it like this recipe (6 hours on low). One modification was to sub a 7oz can of Herdez ranchera salsa for the achiote paste. Absolutely delicious, served on flour tortillas with brown rice and standard taco fixings.

Not to sound like a total glutton, but I don't think 2 pounds of boneless pork shoulder is enough to feed four people. I cooked this for my boyfriend and me, expecting there to be leftovers, because I used 3 lbs instead of 2. However, we ate everything. There are no leftovers to be had today. The texture of the pork is incredible. I also added some cumin and garlic powder for additional flavor. I love cooking with a slow cooker and this is a fantastic and easy recipe. Next time, I'm doubling the recipe. Maybe tripling it. I wonder if that will work.

My household is addicted to carnitas tacos from the restaurant Chipotle. While this may not be the "authentic" recipe for Carnitas (I doubt many women used crockpots in rural mexico while perfecting this recipe long before I was born), it certainly delivers great flavor for busy families. We love it rolled in whole wheat tortillas with green salsa, sharp white cheddar, cilantro/lime rice, and avocado slices. my mouth is watering!

I really like this dish. SOOO easy. Last night I had gone to bed and then realized I had planned to start the carnitas so that I could prep enchiladas early in the day (so that I wouldn't have to deal with the mess when my guests were here...). So at midnight I got up, cubed up the pork, tossed it with the spices, and turned in on. i was back in bed in 10 minutes including cleanup. And voila! we woke up to wonderful meat. I don't know if these are authentic but I don't care. I always use pork shoulder and it turns out wonderfully moist and flavorful. Cooks Illustrated just did a story on carnitas and they mention orange juice as a secret ingredient - i may try a bit of that next time.

I don't have a slow cooker, so after looking over the other reviews, I added some roasted garlic and white zin wine to the pan, wrapped it twice in foil and put into 300 degree oven for 6 or 7 hours ... when I opened it up, the meat just fell apart. We had frozen margaritas and soft rolled tacos (carnitas, some queso blanco and guacamole, very elemental) - VIVA CINCO de MAYO! There's plenty of meat left over, I'm going to make enchiladas tonight and try my hand at some tamales later this week, will also try this method with chicken and beef later - even without the slow cooker a slow oven and tight seal created a great meal!

I thought this recipe was very good. The second time I made it with bone-in country-style ribs, since I would be breaking it apart by hand and could pull any bones out at that time. I also added a lemon and a lime, each cut in half, and placed them on top with the onion.

I did the recipe as written with 2lbs of shoulder. And it was so easy & good. I didn't add liquid but the meat was very moist since I didn't trim the fat off. I chilled the meat & pot juices separately before shredding. Thus I was able to remove most of the fat before serving. The only thing Id do differently next time is to place the onion pieces cut side down.

Taking into account previous reviews, I used boneless pork shoulder but didn't cut it up. Instead, I seasoned it liberally with salt, pepper, garlic powder and mild chili powder. I then placed it in a roasting pan, tightly coverd with foil, and roasted it at 300F for 4 hours. After removing the meat from the roasting pan, I shredded the gorgeously tender and moist pork with a fork. Finally, before serving, I tossed it into my wok with a tiny bit of olive oil to crisp it up a bit. Served with all the trimmings as per the recipe, my family absolutely loved it.

Instead of this recipe I also use the pork butt or country style ribs but I will coat the meat in a little olive oil and use a rub made of garlic (fresh or powdered) salt & pepper, and chili powder. I then place the meat in foil sprayed with a non-stick spray, seal it up and place it in the slow cooker. This separates the meat from the fat while its cooking and keeps the meat moist and tender. Later, after removing the meat from the slow cooker, I will open the foil and put it in a 325 degree oven for about 20 mins - 1/2 hr to brown the meat and remove some of the excess moisture giving it that authentic crispy texture. Enjoy,

This was very good - I didn't bother to cube the pork but quick braised the roast with seasonings before I tossed into crockpot. The roast fell apart into delicious shreds as I carved it. I doubled the tomatillo sauce - we had enough to have atop our scrambled eggs the next morning! Also took the left over meat and make a salsa verde enchilada casserole for later in the week. Dee-lish!

Carnitas needs to be roasted in a slow oven and does not work in a crock pot. It did not taste good and no one ate it. The flavor is nothing like a traditional carnitas. Also, too much pepper.

I wonder if the cut of meat doesn't affect the end result? I used a 2 lb pork shoulder. It had a fair amount of fat incorporated into it and at the end of 6 hours in the slow cooker, there was plenty of liquid -- next time I'm going to use the (I think) slightly leaner pork ribs to see if I can't reduce the amount of liquid at the end. Delicious!

Add some garlic salt to the shoulder.This is a great recipe! Easy and elegant. If you are saving leftovers keep some of the juices from the slow cooker for tasty reheating without drying out.Try the beans featured in the original article they were out of this world!

Very flavorful considering how few ingredients. I used boneless ribs and cooked for 8 hours on low. As one reviewer noted, the meat sort of "glued together" on top, but it shredded easily and had some nice browned pieces. Served with guacamole and cilantro on soft corn tortillas. Yum. Great for weeknight dinner since most of the work is done by dinner time. I love the new family meal recipes in Bon Appetit.

Loved this recipe. It was a bit too peppery for my family, so I will adjust next time. Carnitas are suppose to be dry... Carnitas means "little meats", made of small bits of well browned pork.

I was not impressed by this dish, too dry

This was delicious. I used Boston butt, cut into 1.5-inch dice. I added a bay leaf and a little garlic salt (1.5 tsp), plus a little white wine since one reviewer thought it was a little dry. The result? Succulent, aromatic pork that just fell apart into delicious threads. I turned my slow cooker to high for the first hour, then let it cook on low for the next four and it came out perfect. Will definitely make this again!

Question??? I see someone added liquid to the slow cooker for this recipe. Is that necessary? With the meat trimmed, will it dry out without liquid?

This turned rather well. I used a 5.5 pound pork shoulder roast, cut it into smaller pieces, eliminated most of the fat, seasoned it and let it sit overnight. I allowed 10 hours in the crock pot. The meat was tender and juicy. The meat was served with guacamole. Even my picky daughter enjoyed this.

The meat was a bit dry and not falling apart after 6 hours in my cooker. Did it cook too long or not long enough?

This was a very easy week night meal. I used the pork shoulder but I didn't cut it into pieces as the recipe called for, rather I put it in the slow cooker whole after rubbing in spices. Also, I added about a 1/2 cup beef broth and a bay leaf. The meat literally fell apart when I placed it on the cutting board. We are using the leftovers (what little there was) for Cuban sandwiches.

I'd recommend adding some juniper berries (quantity to your own particular taste). Adds a wonderful flavour to pork!

Great dish for company! Meat was tender and literally fell apart, great flavor.

I used country pork ribs. Reduced the salt and pepper by half. I wish I would have stirred half way through cooking. My meat was a bit glued together when I went to shred. The pork was a little dry at 6 hours, but worth the lower fat of the cut of meat. I stir-fryed red peppers and red onions, purchased fresh pica de gallo and gaucamole (sp?). Easy meal.

The flavors in the meat were wonderful with so few ingredients. Loved the tomatillo salsa - worth the roasting time. Pureed the left-over beans (wonderful flavor) to use in quesadillas with the left-over pork- just add cheese.

Very good! Followed directions exactly and just pulled the pork out of the cooker and shredded it. I left all the juice behind to eliminate some of the fat and don't like soggy tacos. The tomatillo salsa with it is a must to perk up the flavers!

This was a pretty good recipe especially for weeknights. I followed the recipe, but finished the carnitas on the stove top, after shredding the meat, I cooked over medium-high heat till some of the liquid was gone. A good standby though.
