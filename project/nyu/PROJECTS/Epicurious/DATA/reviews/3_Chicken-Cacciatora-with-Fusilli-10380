It's possible I screwed this up, but it came out flavorless and very watery. Yuck. A friend told me you can't cook tomato-based dishes in a cast-iron pot, so perhaps that was the problem.

Excellent! I added strips of green and red peppers (because I had them on hand)and a pinch of crushed red pepper for a little zing. We loved it.

It is great, I use whatever pieces of chicken are on sale. I use much more mushrooms, garlic, onions, anchovys, and oregano then the recipe calls for. It ages very well, and I would suggest a night or two in the frige to let the flavors mellow. I have found that when it is reheated more then just once it also gets a more intense flavor as the sauce further reduces. Truly delicious!

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. It was very yummy and made great leftovers.

I have my own way of making this. I take the chicken and remove skin (to reduce fat). Brown chix in a few tbls. olive oil or canola. Remove, add 1 or 2 diced onions w/ 1 green & 1 red pepper diced, & a few cloves garlic smashed, cook lightly till sweated. Add some red wine, a lg. can or 2 of whole tomatoes- sliced w/ sauce, mushrooms (I LEAVE OUT ANCHOVIES). Add spices- to taste (dried basil, oregano, thyme, a bit of crushed dried rosemary,salt,pepper etc.) Add chicken. At this point, I add extra cans of tomatoes (crushed, diced, sauce etc...), enough to thoroughly cover chicken. Add a little sugar to balance the acidity-to taste- a few tsp.. Simmer on med/low heat (tasting & adding spices as needed- GARLIC POWDER!). Stir occasionally. I simmer for about 2 hours until chicken FALLS OFF THE BONE! Start to pick ALL bones out of the sauce (so you don't kill your guests!), add a bit of water throughout the cooking if needed! About 15-20 min. before serving, add a generous amount of GREEN, STUFFED SPANISH OLIVES (simmer in sauce)!!!! Serve over mashed potatoes w/ canned corn, green beans & garlic bread! I always just add spices as I go along -to taste! This has never gone wrong!

This dish was so spicy that I added lots of paprika, garlic, and jalapenos. It is at the same time too spicy to eat.

I took the advice of "A cook from Michigan" and added more herbs and cinammon. The latter spice makes the dish sing like the Three Tenors. The left-overs were even better, once the cinammon "cured" the sauce. Delicioso!

GREAT RECIPE. MY FAMILY LOVED IT. I USED ANGEL HAIR PASTA INSTEAD OF FUSILLI. MADE IT A LITTLE LIGHTER. I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN.

Vegetable oil? Use olive oil! Not enough garlic and herbs. This is one of those "sort of like" recipes. Just fine for those unfortunate individuals never having tasted authentic caggiatore...which my grandfather only made with RABBIT...and a touch of cinnamon...still, it's a start...

Since I have a large family, I always made this same dish in the oven, as my mother had learned in Sicily. It is just as delicious either way. However, much as I enjoy anchovies on pizza, I would leave them out.

I don't know what went wrong, I thought this was very mediocre and I'll certainly try other cacciatora recipes before I'll try this one again. My husband liked this just fine but I just wasn't as impressed with this dish as I have been with so many other Epicurious recipes.

This dish is easy to make yet tastes great. I will make it again soon.

We have made this many, many times with many different varieties of pasta. This is a keeper, and one that you would be hard pressed to find someone who dislikes it. For a time, our family had this dish at least once a month. Now, as our menu grows, this dish probably drops down to a couple of times per year. But, it is still a very, very good way to prepare chicken.

This is a great recipe. It's not too difficult and good enough to to be a dinner party dish. I made it with what I had on hand and was thrilled with the results. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of the chicken pieces and some dried porcini mushrooms, including the soaking liquid, along with the few fresh mushrooms I happened to have. I really enjoyed this dish!
