didn't love it - was light and flavorful but my husband hated it - won't be made again anytime soon.

I had this dish (chawanmushi) for the first time at the restaurant. That version had mushrooms on top. I loved the savory creaminess. I was very excited to see the recipe in print. It took a bit to find all the ingredients- I had to go to several different asian markets, but it was so good I made it two nights in a row. A great starter for a dinner of Andrea Reusing's other recipes.
