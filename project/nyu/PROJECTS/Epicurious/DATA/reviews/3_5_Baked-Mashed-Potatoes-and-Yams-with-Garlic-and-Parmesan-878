I've made this dish every Thanksgiving since it was first published. It's perfect for people who dislike overly-sweet, goopy sweet potato dishes. Really pretty color!

I made this last night for dinner and had rave reviews from my family! Instead of just Yukkon and Yams, I added Parsnips and Carrots. It was delicious!

I make this every Thanksgiving. But I like to use Yukon Gold potatoes in place of the russett.

This is a good alternative to serving two potatoes. TIP: puree your roasted garlic in a mini food processor... otherwise that lovely subtle garlic flavor doesn't make it throughout the dish. I first tried mashing w/ the potatoes and they didn't mash well. I went through and retrieved the cloves and processed them. Much better! Also, use fresh rosemary... it makes a huge difference.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was absolutely delicious. I added all of the garlic, roasted garlic is so mild. I might make this for Thanksgiving dinner too.

This recipe was enjoyed by everyone. Goes well with just about everything from pork to chicken. Easy to make but tastes like it is difficult! I make this often when entertaining.

Made these for Thanksgiving today. They were a huge success. I was a little leery at first of garlic and sweet potatoes, but the combination worked beautifully. After reading the comments on here, and seeing several people consider the dish bland, I decided to increase the garlic to 10 large cloves, but the consensus was I could have easily increased it even further, as the garlic taste was rather mild. I also used shaved parmesan instead of grated, which gave a more stringy/gooey result than grated would. For those suffering from bland potatoes, my two suggestions would be: weigh your potatoes -- 2 3/4 pounds of potatoes is not a lot, definitely less than I thought it would be; and salt the dish and taste it before putting it into the baking dish. I had to liberally salt it several times before I was pleased with the result. Putting the dish into the oven and heating it up again isn't going to miraculously make it taste good if it doesn't taste good to begin with. I will definitely be making this dish again, as it was very easy, I could make it hours before dinner and stick it in the oven for the last 45 minutes with the bird.

This recipe is really delicious. I have made it lots of times and have been asked for the recipe over and over again. I like to add more rosemary and more parmesan cheese to mine, otherwise I keep the recipe the same. It has become a standard side dish for my family and we all love it. I get to craving this dish if I haven't made it in a while. It's well worth a try!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and had to hand out the recipe to my guests. They all loved it. My sister called me for the recipe after hearing how much our mother liked it at Thanksgiving. Will most likely make it again this year because I think the crowd will demand it.

I served this with Christmas dinner and ended up throwing most of it away. It's not awful, just bland. If only yams were used, and the potatoes omitted, this recipe might be worth the cost of the ingredients but not much else. Don't bother with this one!

too much garlic, no one had seconds.

This was a wonderful side dish. I made it with grilled maple rubbed porkchops and simple green beans and it was a perfect match! I have not done much roasting of garlic and it left a mouthwatering smell in the house and left everyone anticipating the dish. I would add a bit more russet than suggested just to even out the flavors and if using dried rosemary knock that up a notch too. Awesome dish, even the 2 year old was asking for seconds and thirds.

I made this for my gourmet group along with a beef tenderloin roast and the Asparagus Amandine. The garlic, cheese, and rosemary were just enough to make it interesting yet not overwhelm the other dishes. I substituted purchased chopped garlic in oil for the baked garlic but otherwise followed the recipe. I thought it was quite good and would definitely make it again. I love rosemary so may add a little more next time.

Quite delicious. No need to make two separate potato dishes for the holidays anymore. This is definitely a keeper.

Fantastic! This dish got rave reviews from my husband who was quite skeptical of the yams. I used whipping cream instead of the reserved cooking liquid. Will definitely make again!

My new favourite potato dish!

I have made my fair share of potatoe recipes and this one rocks. The flavor is excellent. I did use more milk and not the boiled water mixture for making the potatoes more creamy. I also now have to make these for Thanksgiving at the demands of my mother and husband.

My husband and I absolutely loved this! I will definately make again.

This recipe has been a Thanksgiving staple for me since I first tried it several years ago. It's a wonderful, savory alternative to sickly-sweet yam casseroles and always gets rave reviews from my guests and at potluck dinners. I usually follow the recipe pretty closely (though I always double it!), although in the past I've varied the proportions of white to sweet potatoes as well as decreased the amount of garlic-infused olive oil and butter I add. Fresh rosemary and Parmigiano-Reggiano do make a difference. To ensure that the roasted garlic is evenly distributed throughout the dish, use an electric hand mixer to mash the potatoes.

This is a really tasty, really easy side dish and saves you having to make both a regular and a sweet potato dish seperately. I used more sweet and less regular pots than the recipe called for because I was making it for Thanksgiving and wanted sweet pot to be the main flavor. Everyone loved it - I should have made a larger quantity!

one of the few recipes I made for my mom that she has adopted as her own. It's now a Thanksgiving standard at our house. I disagree with the bland comments (normally I like really spicey food) - but to each his/her own :) Good luck Kim ...

Everyone loved this recipe. No leftovers and I made more than was required for the number of guests I had over for our Christmas meal. Can't go wrong with this recipe and it is easy to prepare.

This was gross! Terrible. No flavor. Mush. What a waste. I needed potatoes with the rest of my excellent New Year's Eve meal and it left a gaping hole where that should have been.

This is pretty good, although I'd like the garlic flavor to be a little stronger. I used a mild paremsan cheese. I might try Asiago the next time, but it was a nice break from candied sweet potatoes, and a pretty color, too.

Delicious! I left out the garlic and added a bit of creme fraiche. Everyone said how good they were. Good holiday side dish!

This was very nice. I used 1 T fresh rosemary from my garden. I did not use any of the boiling water - the milk was plenty of liquid.

This dish is a fantastic alternative to the usual mashed potatoes and goes great with chicken. I didn't use the water from the pot though - it really didn't need any more liquid.

I am always looking for new ideas for our winter dinner group of 4 couples, we have been doing this for 22 years. They all raved about this dish, even people who said they don't like yams. Next time I would not add any of the vegetable broth to the mixture, it got a little too thin.

I thought this recipe was a great alternative to the regular thanksgiving dishes. I will use this in future thanksgiving dinners and maybe a few non holiday meals. The garlic was a bit strong but i suggest adding some ranch dressing as an ingredient or as a topping instead of parmesan cheese.

A nice change for Thanksgiving.

I loved this dish - a nice break from all the overly sweet recipes one usually serves. I always roast garlic this way; I don't understand the reviewer who said some exploded (?) in the oven! I keep roasted garlic on hand, making the dish much quicker/easier to prepare.

This turned out beautifully! I increased the amount of roasted garlic and seasonings, served it with marinated grilled pork and green beans with toasted pine nut oil. You can serve the potato in squares cut from the pan which makes a nice presentation.

For all the good-sounding ingredients in this recipe, it was really quite bland. And, while it sat (covered) waiting to be eaten, it developed an odd film on top. Final note: I wouldn't suggest roasting garlic as they describe...two cloves actually exploded in the oven!

this was prepared and served by my husband who made (per him) minor changes to the flavour. it was delightful when served with a seared filet mignon with the cognac sauce from the 2/99 b.a. recipe. green beans with fresh lemon were the perfect companions to the meal. i can't comment on the preparation difficulty since i didn't make it however, eating it was VERY easy. i'm looking forward to eating the leftovers!

I was very disappointed. I made this as a side dish for a company dinner. I absolutely would not make it again. We love all the ingredients that went into it - but it they did not suit our palate in this dish.

I loved this one! The flavors mixed well. Tried to get my husband to eat it but still doesn't like the sweet potato taste. Maybe I shouldn't have told him it was sweet potato.

A delicious potato recipe. I served it with a chipotle and honey glazed pork tenderloin and it was fabulous. My husband and guests enjoyed them immensely.

Pretty good - maybe just a bit too much garlic. My husband liked it more than I did.

Excellent! This dish is perfect for people who don't think they like yams--and especially good for those who know they don't like the sicky-sweet version at Thanksgiving. I've made this recipe every year for the holidays since it came out and it has become a tradition. Beats the marshmallow glop hands-down.

I love this recipe. I have made it several times over the past couple of years. My only suggestion would be to use dried rosemary instead of fresh. These potatoes actually taste better the reheated.

best yam receipe I've come across. Great with turkey, chicken, pork. Even my husband who doesn't care for yams, loves it.
