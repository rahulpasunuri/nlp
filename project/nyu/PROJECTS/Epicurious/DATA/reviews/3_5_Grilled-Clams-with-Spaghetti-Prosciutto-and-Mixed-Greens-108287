Loved it - it definitely goes in the "keeper file." I used Trader Joe's Chard of Many Colors, and (I know you're gonna scream but I'm in the Midwest), two cans of clams. Really loved the flavors. Also sprinkled with Trader Joe's Mediterranean Blend grated cheeses.

I'm sorry. I have to disagree with the other reviewers on this recipe.I consider myself a decent cook.I thought this was disgusting.The clams cooked so quickly the became tough, the shells broke into pieces due to the heat (which are still stuck in my grill) and I didn't think the flavors blended well together.It is always possible I did something wrong.Maybe the grill was too hot (even though it was on low).I don't know.I have never given a rating of 1 fork before.I won't be making this again.Sorry :(

A definite keeper. No, the prosciutto does not stick to the grill, even when thinly sliced. I have substituted 1/2 c chopped fresh basil for the greens, added in at the end, with excellent results as well.

I made this for my family and even the children loved this! I used about 4 pounds of clams to feed my hungry family of 7 (instead of the 8+ pounds the recipe calls for), and it was plenty. I omitted the red pepper for this crowd and didn't miss the heat. Trader Joe's carries a bag of Swiss chard, collards and mustard greens all chopped and mixed together -- it was a perfect time saver for this recipe. This was a treat and easy to make -- we will make it again often!
