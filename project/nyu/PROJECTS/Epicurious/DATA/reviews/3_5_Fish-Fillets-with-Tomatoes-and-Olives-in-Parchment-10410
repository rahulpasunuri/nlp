We thought this was delicious. I used grape tomatoes, which I loved and we really liked the orange zest. Our fillets were a little larger so I increased the ingredients by just a bit and increased the baking time by a couple of minutes - but would bring that back down next time.

Great and easy. Like others, I didnt bother with the oiling of the paper or complicated folding, just made a packet. Also used lemon zest instead of orange as we are not big fans of orange in our food. Used fresh basil and parsley.

I made this last night for the firt time for a dinner party (with a doubled recipe). There wasn't a bite left over! I made the two tiny changes (and was happy I did): 1) I used Haddock instead of Orange Roughy (Haddock is MUCH more ocean friendly and tastes the same) 2) I put about 4 olives (cut in half) in each packet. Do not be scared off by the complicated parchment directions here. I didn't put any oil on the paper. I put the fish right in the middle of the paper, pulled the edges up directly over the fish and folded the excess over a couple of times. Then folded the sides under a couple of times. (Sort of like wrapping a present). The paper stayed closed through baking and the fish was cooked perfectly so I wouldn't bother with the "half heart" shape instructions! Also, if you prepare the packets ahead and keep the in the fridge you'll need to cook longer (about 20 minutes). Delicious!

This recipe had a very interesting taste and even my husband who doesn't always enjoy fish liked it! I used tilipia instead of orange roughy and the fish came out very tender and juicy! I served it along side some brown rice.

I found this recipe quick and easy and quite good. I prefer less broth so I would choose paste or plum tomatoes next time or pat bigger ones thoroughly dry. Also, I minced the olives into a sort of paste operating on the theory that greater surface area would add more flavor to the fish.

I used olive oil instead of butter. Also, I did not oil the parchment paper as this is a messy and unnecessary step. It was very tasty, quick and easy. Everyone enjoyed opening their own little packet of dinner.

This was a hit. I used tilapia fillets. Salt and pepper on the filets. I also mixed grape tomatoes (quartered lengthwise), chopped some olives, chopped a bit of shallot, minced orange zest, chopped parsley, thyme and the red pepper flakes which I spooned over the fillets. Added butter as well.

So fast and healthy! I used gape tomatoes which are nice because they are the same size as the olives. The orange is a nice surprise-a welcome change from lemon.

I substituted the orange for lemon and diced the tomatoes. We loved every delicious bite!

This recipe was fabulous! I also used chilean sea bass. I added several cloves of minced garlic and used fresh rosemary, thyme, sage, and basil for herbs. Also lemon instead of orange zest. A definite keeper!

Delicious, easy and quick to make. I followed the recipe exactly except added 1 tablespoon of thinly sliced shallot under each filet. (I say you can never go wrong adding some shallots.) The best part of this recipe is you can do all the prep work in advance and assemble quickly to bake. Watch out for how much pepper you use to season the fish, because of those added red pepper flakes.

I thought it was pretty good, and my husband enjoyed eating it. Overall, though, he thought we could find another orange roughy recipe that he'd like better. I felt it turned out nice and fresh...like fish with a tomato-olive citrus salsa. I served it over greens (with the sauce spooned over the top) with orzo with Kalamata olive-Dijon mustard butter (also from this site). I think this would be a great dish for a light summer evening meal al fresco.

This is one of my favorite recipes, but with some changes that make it very simple to prepare. I use 1 can of chopped tomatoes, put half on the bottom of a small baking dish, place the fish ( I like Tilapia) on top, then 8 fresh sweet basil leaves, the orange zest, then double the amount of kalamata olives, the hot pepper, then the remaining tomatoes. I cover with a glass lid, bake and serve over a bed of parmesan couscous. I could eat this dish several times a week. Very easy and this way and wonderful for guests.

I seem to be the lone dissenter. I found the topping ingredients incompatible with he sweetness of the flounder. I noticed that in all the good reviews, the ingredients were changed. Also, found the instructions for using the parchment unneccesarily complicated.

I made this with Chilean seabass and it was absolutely fabulous! I did not oil or butter the parchment and used Take Control for the butter as suggested by another reviewer. I wanted to make it the next night it was so delicious...simple and great to prepare ahead of time and just pop in the oven for guests. An absolute keeper!

Really nice and fresh tasting. I'm always looking for dishes which can be assembled ahead of time to avoid last minute chaos when I have company for dinner. However next time around I think I'll lightly butter the parchment instead of brushing with vegetable oil (or use no oil at all).

With so few ingredients, this dish was amazingly flavorful. The orange zest added a wonderful aroma. I coarsely chopped the tomatoes and added about 1/3 cup finely chopped fresh herbs, including basil, parsley, and thyme. I let the entire mixture stand for a couple of hours before mounding over red snapper fillets. It was terrific served over spaghetti.

Excellent quick meal. I did in foil on grill substituting Take Control for butter and lemon zest instead of orange. Prepared this way very heart healthy.

Easy to make, delicious and low fat. Use fresh fish!
