9/20/07 I'm always looking for new twists to my Koulorakias & bring them to my church for my fellow Greeks to try,(they will always tell me if they like them or not!) they loved them.

I've been making this recipe for years (ever since it came out in 1996). I don't care about its ethnic origin. As far as I'm concerned they are Greek because they contain honey and anise and that's good enough for me. If you're using fresh aniseed (I just bought mine from Penzey's) and really good quality honey (pine or heather honey is good, look for darker but not too dark honeys) be assured they are going to taste wonderful! So, don't be turned off by the other reviews! If you are looking for the less common flavors - you're in the right place. Print it and make it. They're worth the effort.

I AGREE WITH THE COOK FROM CALIFORNIA, THESE ARE NOT TRADITIONAL GREEK KOULOURAKIA,MADE MOSTLY FOR EASTER, WHICH ARE USUALLY FLAVOURED WITH VANILLA, AND BRUSHED WITH EGG YOLK ONLY. OF COURSE THERE ARE VARIATIONS NOWADAYS,(LIKE CHOCOLATE ONES) BUT TRADITIONAL KOULOURAKIA ARE KEPT SIMPLE.

From an Ethnic standpoint, this is not very traditional. My grandmother and mother from Crete, brushed beaten eggwhites on the cookie twists and sprinklend sesame seeds on them. No anis of any sort was ever used, nor honey. Greek Cook

These were certainly easy to make, but they were nothing special. I recommend experiementing with other shapes than just the "twists."
