I loved it. I made it for Thanksgiving dinner, and was happy to have also made a traditional cranberry sauce, because it didn't have the *feel* of Thanksgiving. It's awesome with the leftovers to give turkey a different twist. It will also be a great summertime relish.

Most excellent as an addition to hominy, garbanzo beans for a sandwich spread, or vinegar for salad dressing. I've loved having a container of leftover relish to experiment with. It add freshness to everything and I'll make it again soon.

This is an awesome way to use fresh cranberries. I like it with corn chips as a sort of salsa, or on a salad instead of dressing. It's always a hit with people who like spice or something a little different... leave the bland guests to canned salsa or cranberry sauce!

Easy & wonderful! This is the first thing requested on the thanksgiving menu since I first made it 3 years ago. My family & friends wouldn't let me skip it if I wanted to (which I don't).

This was delicious and simple to make. We usually have salsa with Thanksgiving turkey. This is like a cranberry salsa. My Girl Scouts finished it off later with Fritos. Yum!

This was a wonderful recipe, but I agree, you should also serve a traditional cranberry sauce for those you don't enjoy the "kick" from the peppers. I did use a slightly milder chili than the serrano, and liked the fact that I could use more of it, thus adding more color to the relish.

I made this a year ago and it was absolutely delicious -- I came back online to find the recipe so I can make it again this year -- it is definitely different -- but was a hugh hit with our family.

In the absence of serrano, we used jalapeno. May try it with orange juice in place of lime for our next try. It complimented pork well.

My suggestion is only make this if you are also serving a traditional cranberry sauce. People either loved it or hated it.

I will never make this again. It was awful as a relish with dinner, however someone suggested that it might be good as a spread on a sandwich.
