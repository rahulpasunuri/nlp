This recipe is a good starting point, I wouldn't follow it word for word. I didn't use eggplant or peppers, just zucchini and a tomato. I didn't grill the tomato though. I also substituted the balsamic vinaigrette for the vinegar, added more flavor to the veggies. I thought it was pretty good.

This is ok. But I could wing something tastier without a simple recipe like this one.

This recipe needs work - I found the EVOO + Balsamic vinegar mix didn't give the veggies enough flavor. I used EVOO, salt/pepper and rosemary which was far more tasteful! Also added sun-dried tomato pesto on the bread.

Eh. Meh. Could have used more spices and "jazzing up", which you can certainly do, but shouldn't the recipe stand on it's own? Healthy yes, but no culinary revelation or taste revolution.

I would say that this recipe is good, not great. I was kinda blah to be honest. It's really healthy which is nice and makes a good lunch to take to work but really nothing to rave about.

Really tasty and filling. Added portebellas and sun dried tomatoes. Wrapped up and kept great for lunch the next day.
