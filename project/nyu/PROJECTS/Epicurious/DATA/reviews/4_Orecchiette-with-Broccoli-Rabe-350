Couldn't find rapini, made with broccoli. It's probably a keeper, but not 4 forks material (I can imagine it with rapini).

Very easy! Used broccolini and was excellent. Will definitely make again.

Made this last night. I used broccoli (couldn't find rabe) and a different shaped pasta. The recipe is certainly easy, and it tastes good. It has a good balance of flavors -- not too cheesy, not too greasy, not too garlicky. And it's a great way to get the kids to eat some veggies. Next time I'll add some sausage just to make it a little heartier.

I prepared this exactly as specified. This is easy and tastes great! I recommend the Pecorino Romano--it costs a little more but makes a big difference in flavor.

Simple and delicious. My market didn't have any Rabe at this time, so I used broccolini. I think a little grated lemon zest would be a nice addition. I will try it next time.

Try it with white truffle oil and sausage. Delicious!

Thank you 'alyciadaniels' I followed your advice and only used the little leaves and flowers and I absolutely loved this dish. While heating up the oil prior to adding the garlic I added an anchovy for a little extra flavor and I highly recommend doing this. This is a simple yet delicious dish that I will certainly be making again.

I have been searching for a recipe similar to the one served at our favorite restaurant and this is it (except that they include kalamata olives and cherry tomatoes in their version). This is delicious in its original form or with the added ingredients; just be sure to use good quality cheeses, it makes all the difference.

Loved everything about this but the broccoli rabe. We found it to be bitter. Next time I will use broccoli or Broccolini.

This dish is a staple in the winter, use all the rapini, but ensure it is fresh, ie discard any yellow parts and the stem ends. Delicious and feels healthy too.

East and fast. I made it with brocolli and whole wheat pasta for my picky seven year old, and he ate it without complaint.

I made the dish according to the specifications of alyciadaniels and the outcome was great. She is right about the flowers and small leaves being the only sweet part of the plant. (Guilt will force me to try the dish again with the big leaves tomorrow, rather than toss them out.) I mashed a couple cloves of garlic on medium heat and cooked them for a minute in olive oil. I tossed them out and, over low heat, melted four oil-packed anchovy fillets in the oil, then turned off the heat. Boiled my pasta, added in my rappini--flowers and small leaves only--and scooped it all into my pan. I turned on the heat under my pan, grated in some hard cheese, seasoned it with salt and chili flakes. Once platted, I poured generous amounts of good olive oil over each serving. More Parmesan at the table.

I added red pepper flakes (about 1/2 tsp)when I sauteed the garlic and thought this dish was delicious. My broccoli rabe was tender and rather mild. You have to be careful when you buy this vegetable as it is sometimes quite bitter.

My husband is Pugliese. There's a secret to cleaning the rape, or rappini. You're only supposed to use the the little leaves and the flowers. The big leaves and stems are bitter and nasty. 20 lbs of rape doesn't yield very much food either. If the plant is not in. season, there aren't very many flowers and it's a waste of time. I guess it's also possible that it's a completely different beast in Italy. The little artichokes and arugola and completely different beasts there as well. When my father-in-law makes this dish, he sautees peeled and halved garlic cloves, rather than minced, and adds a little anchovy to the oil as well. After tossing the oil mixture with the pasta and rape, it is served with raw olive oil and red pepper flakes to taste. Olive oil in Italy is like wine, and it loses it's perfume when it's cooked, so they are constantly seasoning their food with raw olive oil. They even drizzle it over pizza. It really makes a difference in this dish. The oil is basically the sauce, and if you skimp on the oil for health reasons, then skimp on the cooked oil, and just add raw olive oil and the red pepper flakes, because it's really good for you, much better than cooked olive oil. If you don't want to bother with the rape, regular broccoli or cauliflower does just great. I make it with whole wheat penne for my 2 year old and he licks the plate. Just add pasta and vegetables to salted boiling water, and cook together until the pasta is done. Drain, and immediately mix it all up with raw olive oil, red pepper flakes and a little peccorino, and voila! Healthy dinner in 15 minutes. Buon Appetito!

Wow, I'm not sure why there are bad reviews for this. It was outstanding and easy to make. I too cooked the pasta / rabe in broth (I used vegetable broth because my boyfriend is a vegetarian) and only sauteed the garlic for about 30 seconds, but only used about 1/8 of a cup of the oil to keep it light. I absolutely LOVED the flavor - I didn't find it bland at all - and it's also a beautiful pasta to serve, in my opinion. I will make it often!

This is one of my favorite dishes--I add chickpeas and some red pepper flakes for an easy and delicious vegetarian dinner.

Too garlicky - and I like garlic. I think you need to simmer the garlic absolutely perfectly to get the flavor right. I'll only make the dish again if I mix it up somehow - use roasted garlic, add some toasted pine nuts, or something.

Wow, what a dissapointment- After all these reviews I thought this would be a no brainer for our dinner party tonight- It was SO bland... I doubled the garlic, added 1/4 t. of red pepper flakes to the oil and did the broth in the water as others had recommended and then after tasting it just before serving I panicked- it tasted like oily pasta with just a garlicky taste with some greens. I then added a ton of cheese and just had to serve it. My 8 year old told me it was DELICIOUS- this is from a child who eats plain pasta with a tad of butter usually! Definitely not a 'can i have the recipe' type recipe from any guests... I just made sure everyone had enough Italian wine so maybe they wouldn't notice. Won't make again. I think the key to this is that almost every review is saying what they added to this recipe... I would think with spicy sausage it would be much better but I have vegetarians in the family- if you have to add that many things to a recipe to make it good, it's not a good recipe.

Perfect dish. Used lots and lots of garlic as well as some florets to fill out my small amount of rabe. The shock came as my toddlers munched broccoli saying 'yum yum mom' while grabbing for more. I'll make this again as I actually prefer it over our standard 'rabe with sausage'.

We were having new friends over for dinner and had a request for a vegetarian meal. This was fantastic! Everyone took seconds -- please note that recipe says it serves 6, but it's more like 4 as a main course. Easy and divine dish.

This was delicious. Even my husband, who is not fond of broccoli rabe, asked for a repeat performance.

This was fab! I made it a bit too garlicky after reading the reviews, but none of us could get enough. I did the chicken broth in the pasta water and the red pepper in the oil and then topped it all with a squeeze or so of lemon juice. Family deemed it a "keeper".

This was so easy and delicious! I took the suggestion of adding some chicken stock to the broth to cook the pasta and broccoli rabe and it did indeed take out any bitterness. I probably added more cheese than was necessary, but by trimming this down this is a tasty, nutritious meal.

Love this recipe! Some suggestions- put chicken broth in the water to take out the rabe bitterness, add broth to the pasta when tossing everything together to give it a little more sauce, and saute up some mild Italian sausage, sliced into discs, to toss in there as well. We also add chile pepper flakes to the oil to add some heat, and sprinkle more cheese on top to serve. It was a huge hit with everyone from my 87-year-old grandmom to my 2-year-old niece!

This was delicious! The pecorino really goes nicely with the slight bitterness of the rabe. I didn't have quite enough rabe, so I added some young broccoli, which I thought was a very nice addition.

For a new twist, add some toasted walnuts. Yummy.

This is better than 4 forks!! We loved it. The only thing I would change is to add more garlic and saute it less time...say 30-45 seconds as it continues to brown after you take it off the heat (the oil is still hot). We were able to get very fresh rabe-picked the day before-from Manic Organic in Providence, RI...it was a real treat. I felt like I was living in a villa in Tuscany except I didn't have the work of planting, weeding, and picking; very fresh ingredients and dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes.

This is absolutely delicious and has become one of my new staples. I add lots more garlic and some fresh lemon juice, and it's really fabulous. All my guests ask for the recipe when I serve it.

This was pretty good. Would definitely add more garlic to the oil next time. But this is definitely a quick and easy dinner with good flavors. I also added red pepper flakes, a little cream and salt & pepper, as one of the other readers suggested. I am thinking that a small amount of Italian turkey sausage would be good in this too. But if you like pasta, cheese, broccoli & garlic, you'll like this quick and easy dish. Note: Fellow epicureans, don't forget to save your recipe info and return to the website to post your reviews. We need to keep this rating info going to help us in our recipe searches! Bon Appetit!

GREAT recipe. Definitely add LOTS more garlic.

Since this recipe was first published in Bon Appetit about six years ago, I have been making this dish regularly. My favorite part is the contrast of al dente little ears, earthy sheep's- milk Romano, and the best of all, the slightly bitter broccoli rabe, which I love. I double the garlic always. A word of advice, only use very high quality Romano, and make sure its Pecorino, otherwise you don't have a clear contrast with the Parmesan.

My husband and I make this about once a week, but we also saute some italian sausage, blot the fat off it, and add that, too. Incredibly delicious. And let's just say that it doesn't serve 6, we eat so much of it.

I've had a similar dish at a local Italian restaurant here in San Francisco. So, I was eager to doctor this recipe a bit to try to achieve the same result. My husband loved it! (So did I!) ...Just add a couple more cloves of garlic, 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes and some anchovy to the oil when you heat it. Enjoy!

Try some fresh cream and pepper and you will have a luxurious first course.

Such a light dish, such simple preparation. From the sparse list of ingredients, I wouldn't have guessed it could be so flavorful. Garlic can easily be tripled (or more). This recipe will be kept with my favorites.

This is one of my standards! I do lighten it up by cutting down on the cheese, using only a couple teaspoons of olive oil, and mixing broth & a little cornstarch to substitute the body and mouth feel of the olive oil.I also quadruple the garlic, but I love garlic! Onions are good in it too.
