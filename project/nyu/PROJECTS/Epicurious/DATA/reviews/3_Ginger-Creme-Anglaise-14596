Terrific - Here is a trick to prevent problems with ginger and dairy. Blanch ginger in a pot of boiling water for 1-2 minutes. If you fail to do this step, the acid in the ginger will curdle the dairy mixture.

Truly fantastic, though I cooked mine a little long and it came out a little thick. I added a little extra ginger to give it a stronger flavour, it tasted perfect. I don't think ginger curdled the cream, I've used ginger in cream plenty of times. Make sure to not overcook the cream, to temper the eggs well before adding them back to the cream, and to never stop whisking once the custard is on the heat. I had absolutely no scrambled egg bits in my creme anglaise.

Yum! Made recipe exactly as given except I used whole cream not half and half. No problems with curdling. It was good enough to eat on its own.

I used half the ginger called for, and I had now problem with the sauce breaking.

The ginger curdled the half-and-half as surely as adding lemon juice would have. Now I know a new trick for making sour milk for buttermilk recipes... The sauce turned out o.k., but it did have that slightly granular look of curdled milk if one looked closely. Glad I wasn't trying to impress anyone.
