YUM! I marinated this for 5 hours. The flavor was robust and the meat very tender. Even better, I'm sure, if marinated for 12 hours. I served these with Grilled Pineapple with Brown Sugar, Coconut & Rum from this site & it made a great pairing.(The pineapple is intended as dessert, but it made a great side with the pork.) We thought this marinade would be terrific on salmon or chicken. (Will let you know!)

This recipe was easy to make and the longer you marinade the meat (I did the overnight) the tastier they are. The glaze is YUMMY! My daughter LOVED them. Definetely would do again in a tripple batch for a party..appetizer. I slowly baked mine in the convection oven on the "meat" setting and turned them often.

Loved it. I've made this several times with good results. I've also substituted honey for the maple, also with good results. I'm not a big fan of allspice, so I reduced that some and added more thyme.

This was a waste of a good pork roast. The orange overwhelmed the pork and became bitter when BBQd. The recipe looked good on paper.

Perhaps since I used frozen orange juice concentrate that might've had a high sugar content, or maybe I reduced the sauce too much, but my ribs caught on fire a few minutes after I first basted them. By the time I went to check on them and turn them, they were completely burnt through, lots of flames. There had been no flames on the coals at all when I put the ribs on the barbeque. All I can think is that somehow there was way too much sugar in the sauce and that's what caused it to catch fire.

This was a waste of good baby back ribs. I marinated them overnight - used good pure maple syrup and fresh thyme. Maybe it was the allspice we didn't like but the end result was not good. Have found many spectacular recipes on this website and this wasn't one of them.

I used this recipe for thin sliced pork chops and it turned out well. I don't like Pork and it was very good! Definately worth trying.

Tremendous flavors from so few ingredients! Used freshly squeezed OJ pulp and all, and fresh thyme from my garden. OJ worked well for tenderizing the ribs. Meat was fork tender. Would like to try on pork tenderloin. Additional BBQ sauce not required. Served with a side of vegetable fried rice with carrots, celery, red pepper, green onions, and bean sprouts.

Excellent, light oriental flavor. Wish I could afford baby back ribs, but it was still great on spareribs. Such an easy meal to make!

Excellent and easy. I used pork tenderloin instead of ribs. Make sure you use real maple syrup, not Log Cabin or Aunt Jemima.

Wow!! This is good! I started late in the day and only marinated for 3 hours, but it did not matter. (Maybe it is even better when marinated for the reccomended time?) I used fresh thyme, hate the dry stuff, and fresh squeezed orange juice and a high quality maple syrup, which is probably critical to the final taste. Easy and excellent! The best recipe I have tried so far from this web site.
