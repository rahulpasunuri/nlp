As another reviewer noted, the caramel sets up when you add the apples...also, the batter is quite thin. But don't worry - it all comes together in the end, and it's a LOVELY cake. I look forward to trying it with pears and even peaches.

I absolutely loved this cake. I wouldn't change anything about it except to add some nutmeg to the batter which really tied it all together.

I loved this cake. I made this yesterday and took it to a friends party and I was so disappointed that I only got one piece. Next time I will make a two. I made the recipe as directed with one small addition of a pinch of crushed lavender added to the flour mixture. The cake is dense and moist, and the topping was perfectly sweet, not too sugary. I had considered making extra caramel to pour over the top, mostly for looks, but am glad that I did not because that would have been too sweet for my palette.

I love this cake! The cornmeal adds a delicious crunch. I've made it with pears as well, and peaches in the summer. I simplify it greatly by just melting butter and brown sugar in the bottom of the cake pan in the oven until they get dark and bubbly, then arranging the fruit slices and proceeding with the recipe.

I was so glad to have the other reviews to help me out. I followed the directions and the sugar and butter hardened into a big lump of rock candy. Fortunately, after cooking the apples in it, the stuff dissolved into a nice caramel sauce. I also reduced the sugar in the cake batter to 1/2 cup and it was plenty sweet. I loved the combination of textures and will definitely make this again.

grainy but flavorful

I thought this cake was very easy to make and very delicious. I made a few minor changes and was pleased with the results. I used only Granny Smith apples; used instant Polenta flour (seemed to be a little less grainy) and I baked it in a 10" pan, therefore, I used a little more apple, butter, sugar than called for. I baked it about 5 minutes less than called for. It was perfect, the apples had a nice bite to them and the batter was smooth but the cornmeal was noticeable. Also sprinkled some cinnamon on the apples, very little. I also added just a little freshly grated nutmeg in the cake batter. We all loved it and will definitely make again.

like it - not love it. I was able to whip this up as a breakfast cake before a Turkey Trot run (and left the timer to wake my 17 year old.) I too baked it right in the skillet the apples cooked in, which made it all a breeze. But now that I finally have a chance to nibble a piece, I wish I had spiced the apples as if I was making an apple pie.

mmmmm.... I just made this, it's still warm, and it's fantastic. All I added was a little cinnamon, which I love with apples. The cornmeal gives the texture an added dimension which elevates it to another level.

I found this recipe originally in the Bon Appetit magazine (the old-fashioned way!) and tried it right away. I think I must have made it about 50- 60 times since then. It's my ALL TIME FAVORITE RECIPE. I do stir the sugar into the butter and have never had a problem with the caramel sauce. The only problem I've ever had is keeping it for more than 24 hours because it gets eaten so fast. I love this cake!!

Unexciting apples on a corn muffin. Why bother?

This was wonderful, I will make it again and again. I listened to other reviews and didn't stir the caramel - it got horribly clumpy and hard and I thought the worst but when I added the apples everything turned out fine.

I am always looking for dessert recipes that can be motified to fit my need to eat a wheat-free diet, yet also will be tasty enough for my family. Not only does this recipe taste great, but it actually resembles a cake even with the substitution of gluten free flour. It's moist and springy with a delicious corn and apple flavor. I agree that the directions for caramelizing the sugar didn't work, but the flavor was still wonderful.

I have made this twice now, with excellent success. As advised by previous reviewers I fought against temptation and didn't stir the sugar in the caramelization process. I was afraid it was going to burn but it came out beautifully. I used red delicious apples as it was what I had on hand and though these ended up getting softer faster, the end result was very good. I used only a 1/2 cup of sugar in the cornmeal mixture as I prefer a less-sweet cake with all that apple caramel sweetness on top. Also, split the batter in two 6-inch cake pans, which works great for portion control. A nice cake for casual company--easy and not fancy.

I'll agree that the caramel instructions didn't work so hot, but the cake turned out lovely regardless. I was really surprised at how soft and subtile the cornmeal is. Everyone I served it to loved it and went back for more. I think you could play with the topping a bit and it would be spectacular. Will make again.

The instructions for the caramel are indeed awful, atrocious. But this is a great cake! Stirring the sugar before it melts is a no-no, I don't know why they said that. And you don't need to wait for the sugar to melt fully before adding the apples. As someone else wrote, the apples actually create the caramel. I made this in a cast-iron skillet, without parchment (cooked the apples on top of the stove, then put batter over them) The result was a delicious cake with a sweet crunchy crust. Because of the skillet, it cooked really quick, less than half hour. Most yummy, will make it again, either with or without parchment. I wonder what it will taste like if some cinnamon is added to the batter or the caramel. This is great.

I faced the challenge of baking a birthday cake for a child with severe food allergies and intolerances. The cake had to be wheat-free, dairy-free, AND eggless. I thought this looked like a forgiving recipe, so I chose it and made the following substitutions: Crisco for the butter used to caramelize the apples and corn oil for the butter in the batter; tapioca flour for the wheat flour; 1/2 cup soft silken tofu for the eggs; and vanilla soy milk for the whole milk, plus a little extra vanilla to mask the soybean taste. The result was surprisingly good: the cake part came out as a very thin, spongy sort of torte. The caramelized fruit top looked beautiful. Two of the grownups at the party loved it (the rest were busy scarfing the chocolate cake the mom had made for the grownups). The only thing I would do differently is to ditch the Crisco (ugh) and use soy butter instead. I bet this is even better with the ingredients as called for.

Wasn't expecting much based on previous reviews, but this was really enjoyable. Made it for a crowd with the apple topping; my kids prefer it plain for breakfast. Has a light, eggy flavor -- and it toasts well, too!

Three and a half forks here! I really liked this cake, as did the people who shared it with me. Especially with the ice cream on top while the cake is warm. I had never done an upside-down anything, and found this recipe to be surprisingly simple to prepare. I'll definitely make it again, in fact, I already did! :)

I love this cake! No need for so much sugar... it is the best cake on a cold night. SO GOOD!!!!

I liked this and thought the best part was the cake since I love cornmeal. I agree with the majority of the reviews that this is a nice breakfast type of cake, but I'd rather have plain cornbread. It wasn't very "pretty" as far as presentation...just average. I would not make as a dessert for a party. I make so few desserts that when I do, I'd like something more attractive. My husband liked the fruit top and the accompanying ice cream, but not the cake. Oh well, can't please everybody.....:)

I loved this cake. Not too sweet. Great for breakfast. Yes, it does have a cornmeal taste...that's the best part. It is an apple- cornmeal cake after all!

I thought this cake was delicious! The caramel is not difficult if you use a non-stick pan. I thought the "cornmeal-ly" taste people are referring to was actually a plus. The cornmeal gave the cake the texture of a very light corn muffin. My family loved it! It is particularly good served with caramel ice cream. Mmmmmm!

About caramel: if you're making it in a regular pan, you need to stir it and occasionally brush sides of a pan with wet pastry brush. If you are using teflon coated pan, don't stir and don't worry.

Excellent! I loved that it wasn't too sweet. I agree that the recipe was not very detailed in making the caramel. In fact, it took me three times to get it right. The trick according to Larousse Gastronomique is not to stir the sugar. It seems that with agitation the sugar crystallizes. So fight the urge to stir the sugar! Best of luck with recipe. Its truly a keeper!

This was a delish, moist, not-too-sweet cake. It tasted even better at room-temp the day after. Yes, there was a "cornmeal-y" texture, but I thought it only enhanced the flavor.

Simple and delicious. I think that the cake will taste only mildly "cornmeal-y" if the cornmeal has some time to soak and soften in the hot water/butter for awhile. I did this, and also took several minutes to beat it til fluffy with a mixer, and the texture of the cake was soft and delicate. Be generous with vanilla. Cutting the apples wedges into chunks will make it easier to slice the finished cake. My family is finishing it off for breakfast! This would be a good cake choice as part of a dessert buffet.

I agree with the reviewer that it tasted pretty corn-mealy. It seems to need less cornmeal and more regular flour. Overall, it was a pleasant cake, but not a great cake. The process of making the caramel was not explained well. The sugar actually turns very hard until the apples are added and their juices are released. I might make it again with some adjustments.

Rating: 3
Wonderful dessert. I will definitely make this again. My husband tends to prefer fruit pies and crisps over cakes, but he really liked this. It's quick to make, and I found it flavorful and satisfying. I liked the firm moist texture the cornmeal gave the cake. The caramel got a bit too dark as I cooked the apples in it however. Next time I will add the apples to the skillet (carefully! ouch!) before the caramel has finished cooking.

Overall this was very satifying. Try using Jiffy brand cornmeal from the box. I can not get regular cornmeal. It did not make the cake cornmealy at all. The cake was very fluffy. The apples I felt were a little soft and next time I will try granny smiths. I will make it again

I suppose you would really have to like cornmeal for this one. I was expecting more of a sweet desert.

Delicious, and very easy to make. The cornmeal made the dessert! Next time I make this, I'm thinking of preparing it the old fashioned way: in my grandmother's cast-iron skillet. It seems to fit the rustic theme.

A very easy and tasty cake. It also kept well for a couple days after I prepared it (I made 3 for a dinner party). Everyone enjoyed it and especially loved the texture of the cornmeal. This is definately a keeper. Next time I will try with Freestone peaches or pears.

Not bad comfort food. Basically caramel apples on a pretty good cornbread cake.
