I love me some buttercream but this recipe had way too much butter. We made the entire Raspberry Lemon Curd Fluffy white wedding cake. The frosting IS much better with that particular cake recipe, but overall it feels like you are eating a stick of butter. Yuck. Someone else said that it was "hard to believe that something that tasted so light could have so much butter." I did NOT have that experience. It tasted as heavy as one would imagine that many sticks of butter would taste! I ended up making an alternate batch subbing cream cheese for about half of the amount of butter, and the results was much more delicious. I would probably also add a hint more sugar, but that depends on your individual taste.

Excellent buttercream!! Easy to make although after I added the boiled sugar and started adding butter it went very soupy. I crossed my fingers, said a little prayer and added the last cup of butter. Ta da!! It all came together!! I had enough icing to ice a 12 x 16 and an 8" round and border both. It was easy to pipe and held up nicely. I will definitely use this recipe again!!

I'm sure the difficulties I had with this recipe were mine, but at the same time, it is challenging enough that I believe the recipe could benefit from a few tweaks. I had the most glorious glossy peaks on the egg whites, but once the butter went in, the egg whites practically reduced to half the amount they were. The more butter I added, the soupier it got. What I'm wondering is~where did I go wrong?

Have made this wonderful recipe many times. Last time I had a problem. Hope someone can help. After refridgeration overnight I"reconstituted" it and it took longer than in the past and when I was finished the frosting turned very yellow. What did I do wrong?

As a frequent baker, I have tried many different frosting recipes and this has become my go-to recipe. It's easy to decorate with if you will be piping, you can easily add ingredients to flavor it different ways (ie almond extract, chocolate, etc), and it tastes wonderful! It is not like a traditional American Buttercream (think shortening and powdered sugar)-meaning it is not too sweet, but perfectly decadent. Thank you Melissa Murphy--I love this recipe!

The cook from Baltimore must have done something wrong bc this recipe NEVER fails and is so superior to regular buttercream. to each his or her own.

This is the greatest recipe. I have made several wedding cakes for family and friends as well as birthday cakes for the grandchildren and it works well. Tastes great. Pair it with the wedding cake with lemon curd and raspberries and it is a sure hit.

Great frosting. Not too sweet and tasted like frosting that would be on a professionally made wedding cake. However, my 6 year old son does not like it. Too much butter texture and not sweet enough for him. I added powdered sugar to sweeten it up for him - big mistake! Ruined the flavor.

This is an excellent recipe! Not too time consuming, takes just as long as a regular buttercream, and is far superior in my eyes. Very fluffy, light and not too sweet. I think I'll be using this over the other stuff from now on. :)

Awesome recipe. I have tried several meringue buttercreams and this recipe is by far better than all others.

Really nice. Tasted a bit like marshmallow cream. I made it and refrigerated for four days. I was afraid it would be ruined by the time I needed it but I brought it back to room temperature and beat again before using and it was perfect.

Best frosting I've ever made. Looks and tastes like a professional pastry chef made it. It does look really gloppy until all of the butter is added, but it comes out beautiful and delicious.

Easy nice icing. Took adivce and used 1 cup less butter for a nice smooth texture. Also subsituted almond extract for vanilla, 2 Tbsp. Flavour was delicious, but slightly strong, would probably start with 1 Tbsp next time. Also note it actually took about 20 minutes to completely cool after adding the syrup.

I thought that this recipe was not worth the time and effort. I have a much more simple recipe that involves just mixing together some butter and powdered sugar, and it produces similar, if not superior results. The icing came out too hard to be spreadable, and I had to add a lot of milk. I was also not much enamored of the flavor. As for the amount--I iced a double-layer 18x26 inch cake with no icing left over for decoration. I think that next time I'll stick with my old recipe.

I really messed this recipe up... midstream, I realized I only wanted 1/2 recipe. As a result of bad math, it was more of a glaze than an "icing"... but it tasted delicious. I mixed in some fresh seedless black grapes to the left over 'glaze' and put it on petite white cake and it was a sweet smash hit at my gathering!

This was an incredibly easy frosting to make. The directions were thoughtful enough to include warnings (how to mix the hot syrup into the egg white and warning the "chef" that the mixture may appear to break when adding the butter). Both warnings were helpful. Some additional advice: Make less frosting, use less butter, add more sugar and vanilla. The recipe makes A LOT. For a simple two layer cake (two 9 inch cakes with filling in the middle), make 1/3 of the recipe (even if you are a liberal froster). The frosting was a little too heavy on the butter and not as sweet as it could be. Use less butter (about a stick and a half less, if making the entire recipe). Add a lot more vanilla and about a half cup more sugar. Other than that, this frosting is easy to make, has a nice creamy texture, and is very tasty. Although you wouldn't know it from the amount of butter, this frosting actually tastes very "light."

Just started trying this project, making one 9-in cake to test for a wedding this summer. This is the first time I made buttercream, and it was surprisingly straightforward. The directions tell exactly what to do and what to look for, and I had no problems, not even pouring the syrup into the egg whites. The result is wonderful, not too sweet, light in texture, and easy to work with. I would recommend using a clear vanilla extract, though, if you want a bright white cake.
