Substituted toasted walnuts and soaked radicchio in water for 1 hour plus. Clean, crisp and great combination of tastes. Highly recommended, definite repeat.

I had trouble finding hazelnuts so I used roasted sliced almonds instead. I also couldn't find enough arugula; my grocery store sold it with the herbs in very small quantities so I used some arugula and used romaine lettuce for more filler. My parents said the salad was the most "unusual" thing at dinner and we all loved it!

LOVED this recipe! Delivers every aspect of flavor & texture you would want in a great salad! Usually we have leftover salad no one eats, but this time the salad was the first thing to be devoured. Easy to prepare, try this recipe!

Love the spicy mix! Would cut dates a bit smaller or maybe use a different dried fruit; used just one head of radicchio.

My favorite salad recipe as of now. I have made it with and without the goat cheese. The dressing proportions are spot on. Toasted hazlenuts take this salad to another level. I love it!

Great salad. I had goat cheese on hand so used that. It was great and all of my guests loved it.

It really only needs about half the dressing.
