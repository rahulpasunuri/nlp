wow...perfect quick light meal We especially loved the basil in the salad - the kids were the ones that noticed a "fresh taste". As for the grilling method - we will always use this method going forward. I used boneless chicken breasts, pounded them down so they were level 1/2 inch and it was all perfect.

We enjoyed this recipe a lot, but I would recommend a bit more of the red pepper flakes or something else to give it more of a kick. I'm also wondering why the basil enters the recipe so late--it might be nice to cut some up and put it in the marinade/dressing and not just add it to the salad at the very end.

Didnt make exactly as is. I used the dressing for a simple salad and served it alongside barbequed chicken. My family loved the salad best. I did romaine lettuce, avocado, basil, cucumber and feta cheese. really good.

This was noticeably better than grilled chicken. The grilling technique is key. We will make this again and again.

I made this for Mother's Day barbeque and everyone enjoyed it. It was delicious. I used boneless chicken breasts which worked out fine. I was glad that I followed the charcoal grill instructions. I found that the chicken was much juicier than when I normally grill without using this method. This is a keeper.

Once you read the recipe all the way through you will have no problem making this dish. It is delicious no other words are needed.

Nicely sophisticated spring/summer dish for company as well as every night. I put the grilled chicken on top of the salad and lay grilled asparagus--marinated with the same perfectly balanced marinade-- to the side. Great presentation and taste!

I served this for a family dinner and everyone loved it. Several steps, but worth it.

I used boneless skinless chicken instead for this recipe and it was delicious. Just grill it for 2-3 min a side on high, then let sit for a minute or two to allow juices to reabsorb. Slice on the diag, and arrange on the mesclun bed. YUM!

This was very good, and wondering why amount of liquid was the main concern. It seemed pretty obvious that there would be some left over for the wraps. Cheers!!

Have not made it yet, but it looks good. To the previous reviewer: There is 1/2 c. lime juice, and 1 c. oil, plus a few other items, so the total amount of vinaigrette is at least 1 1/2 cups. If you use 1/3 CUP three times, you would probably have some left over as directed. Try the math, then the recipe!

There should be about 1/2 cup left - the measurements are for 1/3 CUP, not 1/3 of the mixture. I think the recipe makes 1 1/2 cups roughly.

Comment: How much is left over after 3 1/3's? Is there an error in the measurements?
