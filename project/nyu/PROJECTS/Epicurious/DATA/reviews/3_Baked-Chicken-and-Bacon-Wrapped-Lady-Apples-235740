The apples were delicious. I found it tough to wrap the bacon around them however. I used drumsticks and they req'd a lot more cooking time than suggested here. Didn't love the chicken. But loved the apples. I made it with some mashed potatoes with apple cider vinegar and bacon from epicurious. That was a good match.

I thought it was really good. I also followed the reviews not to pre-bake the apples, and i just baked it all together with the chicken. I browned the chicken for some extra time. Also my baking time was about 30-35 minutes on 400F. I used 1/4 cup of cider vinegar, and put more apple cider. Turned out great. everyone loved it!

I love the idea but didn't feel like the cooking time was enough for really tender chicken thighs.

This is really lovely. We usually use whole leg quarters and make extra apples! Yum.

Made this for my parents and boyfriend. Everyone loved it. This time of year I could not find Lady apples, so I used other regular-sized apples and quartered them. I also used turkey bacon. Didn't follow the recipe exactly as written but the flavor of the sauce was outstanding, and I don't think the changes I made affected the flavor negatively at all. Easy to make also.

I really enjoyed this recipe and so did my husband! I made a few modifications based on the other user reviews (didn't precook apples; stuffed with cheese/bacon) and it came out great! Also, given the size of the apples, I knew they would bake quickly so I browned the chicken much longer than the time recommended so the actual baking took less time. It came out beautifully!

I saw this recipe in the magazine and loved the idea of the bacon and apple. I used it as a quide line. Wanted to use my new slow cooker. Browned a whole fryer in bacon grease, stuffed it with a quartered apple, placed it on top of quartered onion, added s&p, dried marjoram and a little chicken stock. Added two whole apples (had the right apples but didn't core). Cooked for about 4 hours. It was falling apart, apples mush. Took everything out but drippings/broth. Added apple cider and a little of the vinegar and cooked it down for about an hour (still in slow cooker/should have removed fat first before adding apple cider,etc.) Put gravy in frig to cool in order to remove excess fat. Since the apples looked like apple sauce, plan B. Cored and sliced three apples (Galas this time) and browned in bacon/chicken fat left from browing chicken, cooked till tender but still firm. Drained. Set aside. Added handful of whole walnuts, browned those. Set aside. Added a precooked sweet potatoe that had been cooled and sliced into 1/2 slices. Set aside.Browned a half link of pecan smoked beef sausage that I had cut into bite size slices. Arranged apples, walnuts, sweet potatoe slices, sausage slices and breast from the chicken in a red baking dish. Skimmed the fat off the broth, stirred in a T butter,checked seasoning and then poured over all and put in oven on 350 for about 5- 10 min. Made a beautiful fall dish with many textures and colors. I will make again. I have left over dark meat from the chicken (which was very tender) and my very picky family loved it.

I had lots of fun playing with it. Thick cut very smokey bacon tightly rolled around sharp cheese & stuffed IN the cored cavity. Dredged chicken with flour + dried marjoram, Thyme,FENNEL, Cayenne, pink pepper, salt. Cut cider vinegar in half, but added Calvados (apple based liqueur). Skip the precooking of apples, Put chunks of precooked bacon in the gravy. Baked 15 minutes with cover on, rest of time with cover off. Results spectacularly good and pretty too.

Wow, that's amazing that others felt it was boring. I made it for my husband and his sister when she was visinting. My husband who noramlly doesn't like chicken, ate two helpings. We all thought it was delicious, and I plan to make it again. I didn't precook the apples because of what the previous reviewer said, and I used herbs d'provence in place of the spice called for. My husband even saved the left-overs, which he rarely does.

I agree with the previous review- boring & a waste of time.

My apples turned to mush and didn't seem to add to the taste. The chicken didn't really take on the taste of the apples or even the cider.
