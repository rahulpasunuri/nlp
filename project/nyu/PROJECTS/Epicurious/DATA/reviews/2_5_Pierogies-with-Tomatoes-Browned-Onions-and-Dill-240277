So you're not making your own pierogies. On a weeknight who has the time. The sauce with the copious amount of onions and the caraway seeds is really complimentary and the combination is delicious. The family loves it and so do I.

I love pierogies but I didn't think they were very good with tomatoe sauce. I'll stick to butter with mine!

This recipe is a tasty one for a busy work-night. All of my family members asked for a repeat.

Very comfort-foody! The sauce really makes it, with fresh or dried dill.

The recipe says "Pierogies WITH tomatoes, browned onions and dill"- it claims nothing otherwise. I found this a really quick, flavorful way to use a readily-available comfort food. Delicious- I have found myself craving this several times since the first time I made it.

I am not sure I understand this as a recipe for perogie since the perogies are purchased pre-made and frozen. The tomato sauce is fine.

How can you call this a Pierogie recipe when the pierogies are purchased frozen? This is a tomato sauce recipe at best

This flavor combination is perfect together -- bright tomatoes and dill, rich pierogies and caramelized onions, and a dollop of sour cream. I would definitely make this again!
