Very nice, but don't know if my springform pan was faulty, but it leaked everywhere (even with tinfoil around it) and I had to put it in another pan that was watertight to finish cooking. But yummy, nonetheless.

Made this today and both my husband and I agree it's a keeper. Delicious and easy to make.

This is always a hit when I make it. I substitute whole wheat fettuccine for the egg fettuccine and serve the torte drizzled with a basic lemon vinagrette. I get rave reviews.

I used spaghetti squash (baked it first), and this may be the healthiest dish I've ever made. I added cayenne, nutmeg, and lemon zest for flavor.

Wow, was this delicious! I actually used extra wide home made flavored fettucine (garlic adn chive) adn put in almost double the amount and it was a HUGE hit! I looks really pretty too with the colors. will definitely make it again.

This dish came out beautiful. My brother remarked that he liked the way some of the noodles that were on the outside were crispy. Serve this with a salad or a non- creamed soup and a light desert since this dish is rich.

I made some basic adjustments to the recipe: I couldn't find an Italian Fontina so I substituted a Fontina/Asiago blend. I had chard, kale, and beet greens from my CSA box that I used and which added great flavor. All together it worked out just fine, tasty and not too cheesy. I'll make it again.

I am going to make this again, however, I think that I will add crab meat to it to give it more substance. Also, I used Danish fontina cheese. I will visit an Italian market to get the Italian fontina, it might be less creamy if I tremember correctly,

Make as directed and while it was good tasting, it was too rich and left me unsatisfied, not full even though I had a big salad first. The good news is that I made it the day before and put it in a chantel 9" quiche pan which it filled completely. No worry about drips etc., brought to room temperature and baked as directed. It looked beautiful.

I really liked this...somewhat like a quiche but not as eggy. Perfect as a side dish or a great lunch with a salad. I used spinach instead of chard.

Very tasty! The two cheeses worked so nicely together. Maybe I'd use more noodles next time (they seemed to rise to the top and weren't all that noticeable), but other than that wouldn't change a thing. Served it w/potato leek soup for a yummy meatless meal.
