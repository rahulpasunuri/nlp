I substituted Chinese 5 Spice powder for the star anise, and lemon zest for the lemongrass, neither of which I had on hand. Worked fine. Really tasty, will definitely make again.

I love this dish even though I had to substitute soy for the fish sauce and added two tsp of dried turmeric. Also used fennel instead of star anise, but it was still good. I used only 2 c of water at the end, next time I'll use only 1.

This is one of my go-to curry recipes because its tastes distintively Cambodian - making the lemongrass paste, while time consuming, is the key here. Works well with almost any vegetables, but I definitely wouldn't add as much water as recommended; you have to think about the water content of the vegetables you're using. I make it often with zucchini and this cuts the need for water about in half as the zucchini sheds so much during the cooking process. You can add just enough water to cook the vegetables at first, and then thin it later as necessary.

This recipe is pretty good, but if you like your curry spicy, I would add an extra red chile to the lemongrass paste. I used minimal lemongrass, but squeezed some fresh lime juice in instead of half the water. I thought it might make the coconut milk curdle as I don't have a lot of experience cooking with it, but it didn't and it was pretty tasty. Only complaint would be lack of spice. I used one red chile and found myself dicing up a couple of jalapenos to throw in and stirring in dried red chili powder every five minutes. Also, it's a little thin. Add a little cornstarch if you're planning on having a lot of sauce, or leave it thick and don't bother with the water. I used eggplant instead of squash also. Very good that way. I recommend it.

Okay. I think I finally have this down. I also love this recipe. Have made it several times, but it can be very time consuming. This time, I did everything up to adding the vegetables. The next evening, after work, was able to add and cook the vegetables. Much easier, and the flavor was outstanding. Substituted chicken thighs and omited the squash and white potatoes. We love this!

I served this dish for a birthday dinner and it was very well received. Everyone had seconds, luckily it makes a lot makes a lot. I followed the recipe as it is written but substituted boneless chicken thighs for the breast meat as it was less likley to dry out in the cooking.

One of the best Cambodian curries I've ever had. The peanut butter was a delicious touch. I think for people who feel that the lemongrass is overwhelming must not know that Cambodians use a lot of lemongrass in their dishes, so it should be used sparingly if they're not used to it. But I definately recommend this dish. DELICIOUS!

This is the worst Gourmet recipe I've ever made. The lemongrass flavor is overwhelming. I had fun peeling and slicing all the vegetables and then was sad to have them ruined by the extremely disappointing sauce. It's nothing like the red curry you can get in any Thai restaurant. That would be forgivable if it were tasty, but it's not. The only substitution I made was to use powdered turmeric.

This is a massive recipe-a Dutch oven is a must. I cook Thai and other Asian foods often, so I had all of the ingredients on hand, save for the fresh turmeric ( I used 2 tsp. dried). Here is what I would change: omit the squash (it just gets too soft); don't add the extra water all at once so that it doesn't get too watery; and increase the sauce ingredients by 1.5, or maybe 2.

Excellent taste with all those subtle flavours. I omitted the peanuts and used crunchy peanut butter instead and doubled the amount. In future, I would add the potatoes and squash towards the end of cooking. I did not add the remaining water.

loved the flavor and all the vegetables. After adding the remaining water and cooking according to the recipe, I felt that the sauce was a bit thin. I thickened it with about a TBSP of cornstarch. My husband said it could use a bit more salt.

As good as anything I've had in a restaurant. An excellent fall or winter dish with loads of veggies and warm, spicy curry flavor. Like others, I doubled the peanut butter and it was great. If I had any criticism at all, it was that I didn't care much for the texture of the roasted peanuts once they'd cooked in the curry, so will probably leave them out next time. I think I might also delay adding the squash until the same time as you add the extra water at the end (rather than along with the potatoes etc.); it got a bit softer than I wanted. Delicious nonetheless.

Should be 3 1/2 forks. I was going to make this for just me and my husband, but based on other reviews it seemed like too much food. I served it for friends and although everyone devoured it, there was still about six servings left over! I made it exactly as called for, except couldn't find star anise and used regular anise. I chopped the vegetables, chicken, etc, while cooking, so it felt like I cut down on time. Great to serve for a crowd. My neighbor also doesn't like vegetables, and he served up a huge plate. Be sure to make plenty of rice to sop up the sauce. Yum!

I thought this was outstanding; worth all the time it took tracking down the ingredients. As mentioned before, it has a wonderful fresh flavor. Never was able to find fresh tumeric, but powdered seemed to work. And I left out the white potatoes, squash and beans. Plan to make it again for friends very soon.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. Light but very flavorful. Very authentic, based on my experiences. I must say though that the recipe calls for much more curry sauce than is actually needed if you want to just highlight the flavor of the chicken and vegetables (proportions given in recipe achieve more of a "stew" consistency). I also recommend to add twice as much peanut butter and be careful with the extra hot pepper since red curry already has some. One other thing I would suggest is to partially precook the root vegetables separately as to not overcook the rest of the ingredients. Yum!! Highly recommended!! Thank you for posting this recipe.

Delicious - should read 3 1/2 forks. I added Japenese eggplant and water chestnut for a nice crunch.

What we need is a choice of 3 1/2 forks. This was great! As good as any good Thai restaurant but not beyond compare. I added Japenese eggplant and water chestnut for a nice added little crunch.

It takes two days to assemble the ingredients and about an hour and a half to make this delicious dish. My teenage daughter, who is a vegetarian who hates vegetables, loved it, and my husband definitely wants to have it again. I followed the receipe exactly as it was written, except that I could not find fresh tumeric and so added about one and one half teaspoons of dried; it certainly serves at least 8 people and is really three forks, not four, but I will make it again just to watch my daughter scarf down the vegs.

This recipe is delicious. I followed the recipe as directed, but modified the ingredients a little to make a pumpkin curry: I skipped the lemongrass (none available) and added fresh ginger to the garlic. I added pumpkin and eggplant instead of squash and potatoes. I only used 1 cup of water (lots of water in the eggplant) and I added 1/2 cup of chicken stock. I also added fresh basil and a little bit of lime juice. Well worth the effort! I will make this for company next time.

My husband and his co-teachers love it I was so glad and I will give some for my in-laws to taste it next time I 'll make it. For that they will love me more (ha!ha!ha!).

Definitely a keeper. great curry.

Very good. A bit time consuming but I think that it will be easier when I make it again. Now that I'm familiar with the recipe it seems pretty simple. A lot of veggies to cut up but you could leave out some if you wanted. I also used dried turmeric because I have never seen fresh.

The recipe was just okay. I found it to be labor intensive, from start to finish the time frame was over three hours.

This is an excellent curry with great colors. Next time, I will add double the peanuts as I thought they added something special. I couldn't find star anise so I used 3 tablespoons of anise seeds and strained them and the peanuts out of the coconut milk before adding the curry. Next time I'll add peanuts after straining anise seeds out. I also couldn't find fresh turmeric so I used dried which seemed fine.

Thanks to the other reviews I tried this yummy and unusual curry. I made it with several other dishes and ran out of time so I didn't add the potatoes, carrots, or green beans and it was still incredible. I sustituted boneless chicken thighs because I like them better. If you start preparing the lemongrass paste while the anise heats you can prep the vegetables as you go and it shortens the time a lot. I found the star anise at a health food store.

Although it is a bit time-consuming to make, this is a delicious curry. Next time I may leave out either the squash or sweet potato to reduce the richness of the curry a bit.

Terrific recipe! Best curry I've ever made. At first I was a bit put off by the number of ingredients required but it was definitely worth the trouble. I only omitted the squash and the red bell pepper. The peanut butter gave it a nice full-bodied flavour. I used about 5 Thai bird chilies and it was terribly hot. Just the way I like it!
