This was ok. I, too, added extra lemon. In addition, I chose fresh spinach over frozen, because I prefer the texture. I think I will try other creamed spinach recipes before returning to this one. It did marry well with the Smoked Gouda Mashed Potatoes (Emeril Live, Foodnetwork.com) we chose for our Thanksgiving dinner.

This dish was very easy and delicious. I used skim milk and turkey bacon and it worked great.

I could eaten the thing myself. Yummy! I mixed leftovers with pasta and a little cream to thin the mixture.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! I used 8 slices of bacon and chopped the bacon before cooking. The lemon flavor and the creaminess were devine.

Absolutely delicious! I will make this again and again. I do think a bit more lemon would be great. I don't think this is time-consuming because I made this dish while my main dish was cooking.

I love this recipe. We love this so much that we make twice as much. I tend to use a little less lemon juice and add a bit more salt and pepper, but that's just individual preference.

This is a disk I make for a crowd. When doubling I use less milk.

I usually avoid eating anything green, but this dish is truly delicious! I have made it several times for company, and it makes an elegant and tasty dish. I would not make it for a workday dinner though because it is too time consuming.

We eliminated the bacon from this recipe and sauteed the onions in olive oil. It's quick, easy, healthy, and very rich-tasting, even with skim milk. It's become a regular dish at all our holiday dinners.

I found this dish too lemony and the consistency a bit disappointing. My husband didn't care for it either, so I won't be making it again. I left out the bacon for health reasons; maybe that would have saved it.

This was o.k. Nothing spectacular. My husband enjoyed it more then I did, and it was simple to prepare. Not sure if I'll do it again though. There are better recipes out there.

I made this to serve as a green vegetable with Turkey on New Year's Eve 2000 and was very very pleased with the results. The lemon adds a nice tang to the dish, making it light and refreshing, the bacon provides nice texture and the cream sauce is just the right consistancy. Overall a very nice addition to the meal and I'll defintely make it again.

This dish was very easy to prepare and quite tasty. I would recommend adding more pepper and salt for taste, though.
