This is decadently rich and delicious. I cut the recipe in half but added the full amount of syrup and bourbon. It might have been a little mushy, but it certainly had a lot of flavor. Be prepared for oodles of compliments. Preparing it the day before just gave me one less thing to worry about the next day. I paired this with a simple make ahead fingerling recipe. Just perfect.

This is so good-we added the streusel topping from the apricot puree sweet potatoes recipe and baked it in the oven-even better!

Almost dessert-like, this is really good! I think I prefer less maple syrup, but I'm not a big maple fan. Next time, I may use pecans instead of walnuts.

I served it with diced mango on top, good addition.

I thought this was a good recipe, but I didn't get the quite rave reaction from my family that I was hoping for.

I made this dish for the first time for Thanksgiving dinner. It was a definite hit--very popular. I skipped the allspice (I don't like it) and browned the walnuts in the butter. I'm sure I'll make this again.

Unbelievable. Just keep tipping in the bourbon........

I have made this dish a couple of times. I use pecans instead of walnuts. I also use less syrup and add a little bourbon instead. They are really good!

Annual request from 'the guys' who haven't been sweet potato fans'. Only used 2 tblsp of dark maple syrup, put walnuts on at last minute to keep them crisp. Used 'wild turkey' that sort of set the theme for Thanksgiving & the young crowd could relate to as 'novel'.

I didnt see the need to prepare a day in advance, although it is a very easy make ahead dish. I went easy on the maple syrup, so that they didnt taste too much like sweet potato pie. Very tasty!

Found this recipe to be OK--I didn't make it ahead of time, as others suggested, so flavors were bland. May try again.

Easy to make and absolutely delicious. Made this at Thanksgiving and received rave reviews!

Awesome sweet potatoe recipe. And brilliant that it could be made a couple of days ahead - it was delightful when paired with our Christmas ham. Don't change a thing with the recipe! Yum!

I took this as my contribution to Thanksgiving dinner & it was a hit! One plus for making it ahead of time is that the flavors meld & it travels well.

Also delicious (and not quite as sweet) with pale sweet potatoes (with the pales yellow skins and bright yellow flesh).

This was very good and very rich. I agree with previous post about letting it sit to allow flavors (especially the bourbon)to meld. Next time I will make less; a little goes a long way with this recipe because it is so rich.

I did not add the walnuts and it was wonderful. I will make this again this winter!

I prepared the Bourbon- Walnut Sweet Potato Mash as a side dish for Thanksgiving. My husband and I loved it. My 1-yr. old nephew found this dish appealing as well. I will definitely be preparing this dish again and again.

A few changes - I skipped the fat and no one noticed. I added a bit more maple syrup (to taste, given that every potato has a different amount of sugar in it) and a bit of cardamom to give it a more exotic taste. I strongly encourage people to make this at least a day in advance, preferably 2, to allow the bourbon to mellow out. Right after making it, I was nervous that it was too strong, but by Thanksgiving 2 days later it was wonderfully mellow and all the flavors blended beautifully together. Last, 6lbs just barely fed 8 adults, 2 on very strict diets. I wish I had made more so I could have had some leftovers!

We adored this recipe and I found it very easy to prepare given the outstanding result. Even though I only used the cinnamon, the taste was quite mellow and complex with the maple and bourbon. The only caveat is that this is quite rich. Also, don't whip or puree these, they get too pasty.

These were fluffy, sweet and delicious. Also, easy to prepare and easy to do a day in advance! I took the leftovers and, after pulling remaining walnuts off, made a sweet potato pie filling. Double duty!

Awful. My two year old, who eats everything, including dog food and garbage, wouldn't touch this. My husband said it reminded him of the food they served in jail.

My daughter made this recipe for our Thanksgiving dinner. It was definitely the best recipe for sweet potatoes that we have ever tried.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous! I had it with my Thanksgiving meal, and it was perfect... sweet, and crunchy from the walnuts. A definite must!

Tried out this recipe as a possibility for Thanksgiving this year and while my husband and I really enjoyed it and would it make again, we thought it tasted too much like pumpkin pie to make sense including it as a side dish.

To those who have prepared this recipe...did you add 6 Tbsp of butter (my guess), or 3/4 cup?

I loved this recipe. I didn't have time to cook the potatoes whole so I chopped them up first and cooked them for half the time. Everyone loved this. I made it with a mushroom pot pie and the braised cipoline onion recipe from epicurious. A great fall meal.

Thanks, kaboomboom! The mash confused me initially when I spotted it on epicurious, because I do like all the ingredients but perhaps mistakenly thought it would be sweeter than it probably is. In fact, the idea of eating mash for dessert made me shudder as well... I bought the issue of Bon Appétit this recipe was in and it was featured in the potato category as a side dish to a Thanksgiving meal. Will have to try this, now that I've paid so much attention to it...

To the Finland cook - I think this recipe is meant to be a side dish, accompany chicken, turkey, pork, etc.. Recipe is good, though next time, I will reduce the amount of spices a bit. I conducted a taste test, this recipe versus the 'Whipped Sweet Potatoes with Cardamom'. I prefered the Cardamom recipe, my fiance prefered the bourbon recipe, but he admitted his real preference is the toasted nuts on top...

To the cook from Finland -- sweet potatoes are most-often served as a side dish, accompanying chicken, turkey, pork, etc. There are some sweet potato desserts, like sweet popato pie. My guess? I served this as a side-dish.

silly question: what would you eat this with? would you eat this for dessert as in sweet potato pie filling? or...slight shudder...would you eat this as a side dish as in sweet potato casserole topped with marshmallows?

Loved it. Made without walnuts, reduced the allspice to 1/2 tsp, and reduced the butter to 1/4 cup. A nice change.

Rich and absolutely delicious. Nice spice balance, and the bourbon is a terrific touch. Recipe keeps well for two days, and I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it reheats like a charm in the microwave. A keeper.
