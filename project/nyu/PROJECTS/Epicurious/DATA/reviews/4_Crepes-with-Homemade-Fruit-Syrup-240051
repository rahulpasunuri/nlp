This was easy to make and kid friendly. I use a co-op that had a great amount of blackberries this month so was pleased to find a good recipe to use up some of the berries. I did add a little vanilla to the crepe recipe and topped it with a sprinkle of powdered sugar for presentation. Nice for company brunch too!

My rating is just for the crepes. I couldn't find my old, reliable crepe recipe, so I tried this one out and liked it even better than my usual. I used 1/4 cup of batter per crepe and got 10 nice, thick, about 8" crepes. The flavor was quite pleasant--not too eggy, and I didn't have any problems with lumps (and I didn't sieve!). I served these with 2% fat greek yogurt and fresh homemade strawberry jam. It was a delightful combination. I'm confident I'll use this batter again.

I just made the crepes. I used strawberries for the syrup instead of berries. And I added about 1/3 cup water to the syrup. They were really good!

Recipe makes about 6 crepes on a large crepe pan. Fruit syrup can also be made with frozen fruit. Use one small bag with sugar to taste. Thicken with 1 tsp of corn starch mixed into slurry.

I love crepes! The fruit syrup sounds amazing. I will have to try this soon!
