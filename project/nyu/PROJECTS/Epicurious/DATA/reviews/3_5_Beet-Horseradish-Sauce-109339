If your eyes don't start to water when you open the jar,then it isn't really that good...you should be able to "sense" it from a block away while it is being grated... And it is said, "no gefilte shall be eaten without this"

This has been a must have sauce for years to accompany ham at Easter and Christmas. The horseradish can be adjusted to be mild or "head clearing." Making it at least two or three days ahead of time is a must to allow the flavors to fully blend.

This is a wonderful sauce. Made it to go with the Halibut Gifilte fish on this site. Perfect.

My family loves this recipe. I have made it 3 years in a row now for passover and it is a huge hit every time. I probably use more horseradish than called for but my family loves it to be hot!

This is a perfectly acceptable version of a holiday staple - although i would strongly recommend letting it sit at least overnight for flavours to blend properly. Also consider roasting the beets (wrap in foil and bake 1 to 1.5 hours, peel when cool) its MUCH easier way to prep beets, and you won't loose the colour or flavour.

My family has been making this without a recipe since I can remember. Before the time of food processors, the grating was done outdoors. It does clear the head very well though.

Grating the horseradish root on a box grater, I think, would be prolonged torture. I cut my root into pieces and threw it in the food processor. Not sure if the consistancy is different/better when it's grated. Tasty recipe!
