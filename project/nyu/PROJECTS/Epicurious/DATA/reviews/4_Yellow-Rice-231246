This is a very good, very easy rice dish. I have only made it once (as a side for bobotie), but it seems that it has lots of possibilities as a delicious base or side for many kinds of meals. I'll definitely experiment with this one soon. The flavor is nice, but mellow. If you like spicy rice, you will need to doctor this one heavily. The true greatness of the dish seems to be the play between the spices and the raisins (I used golden raisins). In my opinion, leaving them out would yield something completely different, and probably not nearly as good.

This is a great recipe, and just goes to show how versatile rice can be, if you only try.

Served with Bobotie. I tripled the recipe to serve with a doubled Bobotie for 15 people

I also served this with bobotie and had blatjang on the side. I used a mix of basmati and jasmine rice because that's what I had available and it was a good combination. Used both dark and light raisins.

I made this for my family of 3. We have an extremely picky almost 2 year old, who hardly eats at all. She ate 1 1/2 cups of rice by herself, she was upset there was no more left! I will try the recipe today and maybe add some curried lamb chops to cook with it as well. However, I will definitely double the recipe this time.

I made the rice to accompany the bobotie. Instead of mixing the rice together, i sauted it with a tablespoon of butter until it produced fragrant nutty aroma and then incorporated the rest of the ingredients. The recipe yields 3 cups of cooked rice. My family of 4 finished it with big smiles. I definitely will make it again.

Instead of mixing the rice with the rest of the ingredients, i sauted the rice with 1 tablespoon of butter until it produced a nutty aroma and then added the rest of the ingredients. the recipe makes 3 cups of cooked rice. In our family, that means 4 servings. I definitely will make this rice again.
