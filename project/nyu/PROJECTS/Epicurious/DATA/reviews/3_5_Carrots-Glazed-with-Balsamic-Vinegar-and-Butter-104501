I know glazed carrots are supposed to be a little sweet, but I was hoping the balasamic would cut the sweetness in a nice way. This was still way too sweet for me, though. I also had to add water periodically during the cooking process to keep the glaze from overreducing and burning before the carrots finished cooking.

Very simple and tasty. Made it with a marinated pork tenderloin (soy, honey, ginger, garlic) and both were a big hit.

Quartered the thicker parts of the carrots, cooked in a pan until mostly done, then added the sugar and vinegar, didn't bother with the chives, still was pretty good. I do this with green beans quite a bit, and toss with crushed croutons before serving-Mmmm

Super easy (esp if you use baby carrots; no prep at all! but I used regular carrots peeled and cut as recommended). Very flavorful and they would go with just about everything (for us it was chicken breasts in anchovy-basil pan sauce). I agree that browning the carrots during a slightly hotter saute before sprinkling with sugar and dousing with very good balsamic (forget measuring here) is the way to go. No need to cover after as they'll get too soft. Cook/brown first, sugar, vinegar, reduce to coat and be done. If you don't have chives, parsley, dill, tarragon or something else green would fine. Dried or fresh. Will definitely make again.

These were surprising exceptional. I was looking for a way to cook baby carrots while keeping them as whole as possible without roasting. This was the answer! I halved and peeled the carrots, but did not cut them into 2 inch pieces. Also I found that cooking them longer in the butter until browned before adding the sugar and balsamic was a better choice than cooking for 12 minutes afterwards. A mere sprinkling of sugar was all it took along with enough balsamic to coat. Truly a delicious recipe. I highly recommend!

This was a great, easy glazed carrot recipe. I liked the algorithm 3 T butter, 2 T sugar and 1 T balsamic vinegar. It was just right, not too sweet.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely delicious. A bit sweeter than I expected, but a wonderful blend of flavors (use very good quality balsamic vinegar). It worked well with mature carrots prepared as directed. I also have made it with mixed carrots and parsnips (cored and cut the same way)--it was even more attractive and interesting!

This recipe is YUM. I'm not a big fan of carrots when they're cooked, but this is an exception. I cut up whole carrots--a little over a pound. Then used 3 T butter, 2 T sugar and 1 T balsamic. These three ingredients made a nice glaze for the carrots. I didn't have chives, so I sprinkled dill on for some color. I will definitely make this recipe again. Easy!

I am going to amend my review from below. I have made this several times now and it gets better each time. Last Christmas we had a lot of guests so I made a double batch. Two of guests commented these were the best carrots they'd ever eaten. As you can see below, this didn't overwhelm me at first, but now it's become one of my go-to side dishes.

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving and the carrots were a nice tangy accompaniment to the usual flavors of the turkey menu without competing too much. I might have put too much vinegar in because I couldn't get it to "glaze." The sauce seemed too runny, so I used a little cornstarch to thicken it and it turned out perfectly. I would add more chives next time, and cook it a bit longer. Less butter would be fine also.

Yes make these carrots. You won't be disappointed. Only suggestion is perhaps use a little less butter. Recipe hits the right combination of flavors (sweet, salty, onion-y).

These were a great accompaniment to tarragon chicken and wild rice. The perfect amount of sweetness, but not at all overly sweet. My dutch oven handled them perfectly. I reduced the recipe by half and it was tasty. I also used fresh Italian parsley in place of chives, which I didn't have. Although they were good, it seemed more about what they were served with that made them stand out. Definitely not the star of the show, but still tasty. I used baby carrots (pre-packaged) and cut them in half lengthwise. They didn't take a whole lot longer than the recipe called for to cook to a perfect tenderness. Very easy to make, which is a bonus for me for quick weeknight meals.

I used honey instead of sugar and was very pleased with the results. This dish was quite simple and big hit at the table.

Wonderful contrasting flavors; the sweetness of the onions, carrots and sugar with the tart/sweet balsamic. Will definitely include this for special meals.

Great veggie recipe. Just the right amount of gourmet taste and everyone loved it. I did use half the recommended sugar and used regular carrots sliced on the diagonal for a pretty presentation and faster cooking. Also, didn't use the chives...The idea of an onion flavor with the sweet and tangy combination just doesn't appeal to me at all. Perhaps could have topped with some toasted sesame seeds.

Next time I will use less sugar, and if I had to guess how much sugar to use for the whole 10 servings, I think I would settle on 4-1/2 to 5 Tbs.

We have made these carrots twice now, and both times we enjoyed them. Our balsamic is sweet enough that we were able to cut the sugar considerably, and the carrots were plenty sweet and glazed. Although the first time we followed the recipe exactly, tonight I sliced up large carrots, and substituted green onions for the chives. I added a little bit of italian parsley as well. The recipe works for us because it is easy, uses stuff we already have on hand, and goes well with many main courses. On top of that it can stand the flexibility of a few substitutions or additions.

I made this dish as a side with fillet mignon, and my husband and I both loved it. I couldn't say for sure how long I ended up cooking the carrots, as I'm not good at timing meals so everything is done at the same time, so I just turned down the heat to keep them warm while I prepared the rest of the meal, and they were plenty tender (maybe 35 min total?). (I used packaged baby carrots). I also used a quality balsamic, I can imagine the dish might not turn out so good if one used a grocery store brand of balsamic. Couldn't find any fresh chives at this time of year, so just made do without. This was an easy side we'll make again.

3 lbs. of baby carrots served about 10 people. I have made this twice and it was more memorable the first time. Still, a nice (and easy) way to dress up carrots. I think the suggestion to use brown sugar instead of white sugar is a good one (though I didn't do that either time.) Also, I used really expensive balsamic vinegar and I thought it was a bit overpowering and not sweet(the first time I used cheap BV!)

This is a great recipe for those who really don't like cooked carrots. My husband & I fall into that category. We like raw but cooked...yuck. I found myself with too many bags of baby carrots in the fridge so came looking for a recipe. The carrots I used were not really sweet. I am looking forward to making this again with some sweet carrots. It will be even better. I also had to figure out how to make this recipe for two. If I coverted correctly it should be 8 tablespoons butter, 5 tablespoons plus one teaspoon of vinegar and then the sugar was already given in tablespoons. I used about half a bag of baby carrots (8 oz.). For the glaze I used 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 1 tablespoon balsamic and slightly more than 1 tablespoon butter. This seemed to work out just perfect.

I made this dish as a side to my Christmas Eve dinner for extended family--and it was a huge hit. I tripled the recipe and wasn't left with one carrot as a leftover!! I recommend using white balsamic vinegar instead of the regular brown balsamic vinegar--it has a much milder flavor. (I've since made it both ways and my family prefers the white vinegar!!) At any rate, it is a stupendous side dish that will impress almost everyone!!

Very tasty and easy too. I made it as a side dish to chicken piccata. Work well with the tart flavor of the chicken. Had to thin out the sauce a bit too (used a bit of water towards the end). Watch the carrots - they can become a bit mushy if you cook them too long.

My family raved about this dish. Even my husband, who passionately hates carrots, asked for thirds, so you know this must be good. I substituted extra-virgin olive oil for half the butter, honey for the sugar, and added sprigs of fresh thyme just before covering the pan to let the carrots cook. Exquisite!

Excellent!

My family loved these carrots. I cooked it longer than the recipe called for, so the sauce was reduced with wonderful results. I made it for Christmas Eve Dinner along with Christmas Chautaubriand, roasted potatoes and sauteed spinach. A wonderful combination!

Pretty good flavor, but nothing to write home about. Very quick and easy to make.

Depending on carrot quality, may need to cook the carrots covered for a longer time than recipe says. The sauce is lovely, but rather thin. Wondering if you could reduce sauce at the end and pour back over the carrots before serving.

Made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving and it was an unqualified hit! It is a real keeper. The sweet of the carrots w/ the sweet/tart of the balsamic and the butter - well what's not to love.
