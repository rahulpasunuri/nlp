Very good and easy. I sealed the edges of the pastry when I folded it over, to prevent oozing of jam. The few that I could fully twist (3 half twists....) looked the best in the end. I baked for 14 min.

These were quite yummy, but not worth all the trouble. It was hard to get the pastry to twist, and the preserves started running out before I even got the twists to the oven. And the filling burned a bit (even though I kept checking after 10 minutes, having read previous reviews). So I think I'll either cut the dough into 16 squares and put them in a jam-tart pan, or a small muffin tin, then spoon on the jam/preserves; or I might use the whole sheet of puff pastry, rolling the edges up a bit to make a dam, and then cut the whole thing into pieces after it's cooled down. Glaze -- yes!

too much trouble for the glaze??!!

Made just a few of these using leftover puff pastry from another recipe. The glaze seemed like too much trouble for such a small amount so I skipped it. We enjoyed them so I may continue to skip the glaze... fewer calories can't hurt.

Nice - I don't know how you get 3 full twists in this pastry - perhaps I misunderstood the directions. Also found the jam leaked out. But over all - really good - warm or at room temp (I preferred them at room temp). I prepared them the night before, and popped them in the oven in the morning.

Super easy and delicious. I did have to cut the cooking time in half because my first batch burned. These were a favorite on my cookie tray at Christmas.

I followed the directions to the letter and they set off the fire alarm before they were even done baking. I guess it was the fault of an oven that is too hot by nature but the burnt mess these made discourages me from trying this recipe again. (I ended up making a more more cooperative blueberry coffeecake recipe.)

This was an AWESOME super cinchy recipe to make....they look fancy, taste heavenly and come across like you worked for hours on them...We tried them with and without the glaze and we preferred them with...Making them for church tomorrow!!!

I thought these were excellent! I agree, they could be made with any fruit preserves, but I think apricot suits them well. Also, I didn't add the lemon juice to the glaze (only because I discovered I was out of lemons) and I think I prefer them just they way they are. Sweet? YES. Delicious? Absolutely!

This recipe can be used with any type of preserves. Since I like berry preserves I look forward to making this often!
