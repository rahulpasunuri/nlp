Fairly easy recipe that is really outstanding. The caramelized fennel & figs with the port reduction sauce is out of the world with the veal chop. Definitely restaurant quality. Served with roasted sweet potatoes and simple bib lettuce salad with thinly sliced radishes, apples marinated in olive oil & lemon juice toped with goat cheese. And of course quality bottle of wine to accompany the meal. Definitely will make again for family and company.

This is one of my favorite special dishes. I have made this several times, including last year for St. Valentine's Day - it is a wonderful recipe for two. I love the complex flavors of the carmelized fennel and figs coupled with the sauce and veal. A keeper and repeater.

I have made this recipe many times, each very successfully. To simplify the preparation, brown the chops in the same pan as the fennel was caramalized. Place the chops in the pan with the fennel and figs and cook as the recipe suggests.

My husband made this for my birthday and it was amazing! It's definitely going into my 'recipe box' for a repeat performance.

Thank goodness it's for only 2 people. It was our Christmas dinner for 2, and well worth the time and effort. Definitely read it through several times before attempting, so that all the steps will go smoothly.

This is really delicious. The sauce is superb and the fennel/fig combo excellent. Served with sauteed wild mushrooms and rapini, it is a keeper.

This was extraordinary! I made this for dinner on Christmas Eve, and it was quite decadent and delicious. I'll make it again when the occasion warrants--this is not everyday food.

The veal and sauce were okay but not terrific. The time and effort that went into the sauce was unappreciated in the taste. However, the fig and fennel was delicious.

I was suprised to read some of the other reviews. My husband and I thought that this dish was OUT OF THIS WORLD! I actually made it for our Christmas Eve dinner and I can truthfully say that the flavors were something that we'll never forget. My young child was not as enthused as we were, but he still ate it. Definately a special occasion dish.

A few too many steps to make often but it was very much worth the effort. Best to make this when you have some extra time. Great taste.

The chops(which I grilled) and the sauce were absolutely great. The fennel and the figs I would skip the next time. They didn't add anything special to the dish.

The fennel/fig mixture was wonderful and even though it required three different cooking mediums -- it was pretty easy. The wine sauce was good. The veal chops were ok. If you like chops of any sort, then make this. I am not a big chop eater, so I would not make this recipe again unless I used a different cut of meat.
