I made about 2x more dressing than recipe calls for and roasted my own fresh red peppers. Great vegan potato salad.

This is really good! Made yesterday and it got rave reviews. Only change was adding in a bunch of fresh oregano since I was lo on parsley. Yummy.

So glad I tried this salad. The flavor is well balanced and a nice change from mayo-based salads. Doubled the dressing but cut back on the oil by 2T. Next time I would use even less oil. Added sun dried tomatoes and ground black pepper. Will make again and again.

Terrific and very easy. Okay, I made a few modifications based on what I had and didn't have in my frig. No olives, for starters, so that changes the character in a major way, I'm sure. But, I did have a roasted red pepper marinating in some balsamic vinegar, so I cut that up and threw it in, along with some crispy celery and a bit of Vidalia onion, and some dried rosemary. I think the message is that you can do a host of great things with potatoes, roasted red pepper, a slightly sweet vinegar and garlic.

Really enjoyed this salad. Easy to make, too. Used white balsamic vinegar instead of the sherry vinegar and doubled the amount of dressing.

This is so easy and yummy. My family loved it as has every family we have shared it with. The kids love it too. It works for vegetarians, vegans, and those who turn up their noses at potato salad because they assume they all have mayonaise. Our notes: we do not peel the potatoes, and have tried different vinegars - sherry and white balsamic have both been really good. It keeps great in the fridge for a few days, and I love the leftovers for lunch - I can put in a few chunks of grilled chicken and it's a meal.

Surprisingly flavorful. I made a double batch and tripled the dressing. I left the skin on red skinned potatoes and cut pretty small (1 inch, maybe slightly larger). Boiled in salty water until just cooked cooked. Pull before the skin starts to peel or you'll have a mess. I used a combo of red wine vinegar and cider vinegar. Thanks to reviewers, I broiled 3 red peppers, peeled and chopped. Used kalamata olives. Lasted for days until we finished it.

This was great! Here are the changes I made: I used about a tablespoon salt in the cooking water for the potatoes. I used a garlic press to get the garlic paste. And then just added it to the salt etc., without bothering to make a paste. And I added the dressing to the hot potatoes in the pot in which I had cooked them - that gave them a good chance to absorb the dressing. I also used 2 freshly home roasted and chopped red peppers, and sun dried olives. Next time I'd decrease the oil at bit. Terrific!

Wow, this was yummy. I made it to recipe except that I used 3 freshly grilled red peppers and I made a bit more dressing than they did (this was good but don't go overboard on the vinegar). Oh--I also found the garlic didn't really become a good "paste" even though I minced it and was mashing it with my knife--so I blended the dressing. I was happy with the results, but I don't know if it's necessary. I guess one issue with potato salads like these are that the insides of the potatoes aren't spicy when you're biting into them. Would salt in the cooking water help? Maybe that's the second-day improvement everyone talks about... I'll have to wait until tomorrow... I took the salad to a 4th of July BBQ but I saved a bowl in my fridge. Anyway... try it!

I made the recipe pretty much as written, except that I doubled it and made a few minor substitutions. I didn't peel the red-skin potatoes. I had to use a Tarragon vinegar because one guest won't consume anything with alcohol in it. I used Kalamata olives, which worked great. Rather than use jarred peppers, I bought some red peppers and broiled them. Still, it was a delicious recipe! Perfect for the person who doesn't like a mayo-based recipe. Next time, I will make a bit more vinagrette. I didn't use some of the boiled potatoes because I was worried I didn't have enough dressing. Mine looked nothing like the photo -- it is a much messier-looking dish, but that was fine.

This is a nice change from conventional potato salad. My husband doesn't like eggs so he always avoids the potato salad. He loved this one, though. I used freshly roasted peppers and a combination of cilantro and basil as the herbs. And, I reduced the olive oil a bid. I'll definitely make it again.

I love this recipe because it doesn't have any mayonaise or eggs! I used half the oil and added black pepper. This recipe is better on the second day.

I never would've tried this without the rave reviews...even as I was making it I was skeptical. I used freshly roasted peppers and Spanish sherry vinegar and reduced the olive oil. WOW this is yummy and I've made a bunch of no mayo potato salads. I had to hide some from my husband so I could see how it keeps. The next day it's even more incredible!

This was really great - I will definitely make again. Added extra peppers and olives (kalmata).

Awesome! Added a bit extra red pepper and olives (kalmata) as love them both. Adding to my standby list.

Excellent! A very healthy take on potato salad. The simplicity of the dish argues for the best ingredients. Especially your vinegar, peppers and olives.

Sooo tasty. I didn't have the roasted red peppers, so I substituted some crumbled feta cheese (not too much, the olives add a lot of salt).

I roasted 2 red peppersand could have used 3. Added about 1/3 cup more of olive --used pitted Kalamata olives. Best served with sausages and Zinfandel. The best of the recipes in Last Touch Article.
