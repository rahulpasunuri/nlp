I used Amaretto instead of the brandy and it was great. I would use a few more cherries next time. I served it at a dinner party and it was a hit. Nice because you can make it days ahead.

Good but not great. A dish of Cherry Garcia with some good chocolate sauce would be as good and less work.

We made this for guests last Saturday night. I made the crust. Easy and fast. My husband made the sauce. Easy and fast. Ben and Jerry's made the Cherry Garcia ice cream. Fastest of all. Everyone loved it. One guest asked for 2nds. All thought it quite spectacular.

Followed recipe exactly and it was almost overwhelmingly rich, but not quite. We enjoyed it immensely, but it is seasonal. I made it in June when the bing cherries were in the stores.

I think that the the fault here was with the user and not the recipe, but it still didn't meet my expectations. The ice-cream mixture melted on me so when I refroze the pie it had a weird texture. It was good, just not great.

I made this for the 4th of July and everyone liked it. The chocolate fudge sauce was delicious. I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate....yummy!

I made two of these (and I did use purchased crusts) for a teen party, and they were a great success!! I used a high quality chocolate chip, but if I were to make it for a dinner party, I think I would use broken Swiss chocolate and a homemade crust instead. Easy, delicious, and very pretty.

My family ate every last drop! This one is a winner. Rather than make a pie, I made an ice cream bomb. I folded the ice cream mixture into a bowl and then added the cookie crust on the top. Be sure to press the cookie crumbs into the ice cream. When you unmold it, the bomb makes a great presentation. Serve with hot fudge sauce.

Take the time to make the crust (it really doesn't take much time). Do not buy a prepared shell to save time. The ice cream is so delicious that I feel I cheapened mine by using a store-bought crust. I loved the ice cream so much that I made extra for ice cream bars (popsicle molds). Next time, I will omit the chocolate chips. The sauce was simple to make, but I would only use a small amount, if any. I absolutely LOVE the cherry-almond ice cream!!!

This was an okay recipe. I found the chocolate chips were totally unnecessary and the fudge sauce overwhelmed the delicate cherry flavor. It was certainly easy to make but I don't think I'll make it again.
