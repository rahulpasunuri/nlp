This sounded good, but had a very weird taste- even for someone who loves all of the ingredients. It was bad.

Great easy dish with lots of flavor. Be careful to keep the heat low so as not to burn the spices. I add some chopped onion before the tomatoes for a crunch and serve it over rice. I made a video of the dish for my blog: http://makeityourdamnself.wordpress.com (Spiced Chickpeas and Tomatoes)

Good standby for a quick vegetarian meal. I substitute a 1/4 of a head of cabbage for one of the cans of chickpeas. I also make it spicier.

Great recipe. Could be served hot or cold. Perfect combination of flavors and is good as a base to improvise with by adding other ingredients. I cut the amount of oil, because 1/3 cup is really not necessary.

Extremely yummy and quick to make - plus this is stuff I tend to have around in the pantry at any given time. I've made it only once but plan to do so again.

Tasty weeknight meal and criminally easy to make. I used dried parsley and mint, and it came out just fine. Lovely with a little spoonful of plain yogurt on top, or the yogurt and cucumber salad on the side (as other reviewers mentioned). Definitely season with salt and a little pepper at the end.

Perfect staple meal for a busy weeknight. Delicious vegetarian fair. I made this exactly as is (a rare thing for me) and served it over basmati rice with a cucumber salad on the side. It made ample servings (much more than listed) for our family, and I'm looking forward to serving it alongside a roast chicken later this week, as well.

Very simple tasty recipe, if you like spicy. My family loved it and it is very healthy. Quite unusual side dish!

Awful. Sounded great, but it does not deliver. The flavors are just "off". We threw it out.

Delicious and quick. Double the spices (except red pepper), use fresh ginger instead. I will try with fresh tomatoes instead of canned next time. Also, included a shallot before adding the spices. Topped with cucumbers and Cacik.

Great quick recipe and the leftovers taste even better the next day. It would not be the same with out the sauce. I make a greek cucumber sauce with plenty of fresh mint to compliment the warm spices.

very bland - lacked spice flavors that the recipe described. Will not make again.

This is delicious and SO easy, great for a weeknight. I used fresh ginger (about a teaspoon) instead of dried. I didn't have any mint so used fresh cilantro instead. Great over basmati rice.

I made this for Lenten and took it to our Parish last night, and it got GREAT reviews amongst a sea of other vegan recipes. I'll agree with the other reviewers that you can definitely cut down on the oil (1-2 Tablespoons instead of 1/3 cup) and the fresh herbs make ALL the difference. I'll probably used diced tomatoes next time as well. We're having the leftovers tonight and I anticipate that it will be even better now that the flavors have had time to meld.

This is a dish I love to make Sunday night, with wild rice. It's a great lunch for the following days. Easy, flavorful, interesting and cheap. I only use 1 tbsp of oil though. A dollop of yogurt also makes a lovely contrast.

Quickly turning into one of my favorite recipes. I have made it twice in the past two weeks. This dish is easy, simple, but full of flavor. I omit the ginger because I don't care for it, and I use diced tomatoes instead of whole. The fresh herbs are a must! I have served this with the Indian-Spiced Cucumber Salad recipe on this site and warmed pita bread. Delish!

I liked this dish though I think it could have used less oil and to simmer for a little longer so the chickpeas would get softer. Next time I'll try that.

I made this following the recipe and while it was simple to make it was very bitter. The next day I salvaged the dish by adding sauteed onions, carrots and celery.

This was really good. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding a little kosher salt towards the end. I really can't imagine it being the same without the fresh herbs, so if you can, I definitely recommend using them. I served it for lunch with the addition of some pita crackers. Yum!

Well, it took a little work but I really liked this in the end. I didn't have whole canned tomatoes but I had a can of crushed and used those. I added more spices plus a cube of Telma vegetable bullion. I skipped the fresh herbs because I didn't have any. I served it over brown rice and topped with reduced-fat feta and was pretty pleased with the results. I am a chickpea fanatic, but I don't think this dish is for everybody.

I skipped the fresh herbs to save cash and found this was still delicious. Great use for ingredients you probably have in the pantry. Just toss on a little salt and pepper at the end to bring out all the flavors.

This, folks, is the surprise hit of the March 2009 Gourmet. I suggested we make it as a Friday dinner for Lent. Husband was cautious. Turned out to be *fantastic* and the leftovers reheated very well the next day for lunch. My only changes to the recipe were to use a teaspoon of fresh minced ginger instead of dried (because I had a nub of ginger to use up before it went bad) and I added a small minced garlic clove. When I was sauteeing the spices I thought it just sort of called for a tiny bit of garlic, and it turned out nicely. I meant to serve with rice but I forgot to make it so I just served it in bowls with a dollop of plain yogurt and some diced cucumber, and wheat flatbreads on the side. Was very good. Also very cheap. Would definitely make again.
