A lassi must have Herbs thats the whole point of a Lassi, to kick start the digestive system. I usually use plain greek yogurt, with fresh mangoes and add ginger and mint. Absolutely fabulous!

What everyone has said about the buttermilk is correct. I did half buttermilk and half whole milk. My boys said it tasted and had the consistency of pancake batter which figures since buttermilk can be used for pancakes. I don't think I'll try this at home again. I also used what are called Champagne mangos.

I tried this and thought this was pretty sour and gross. Find a recipe that uses yogurt instead of buttermilk.

I know that this isn't an authentic recipe for mango lassi, which is made with yogurt, but I still thought this drink was really delicious. I love the tang that the buttermilk gives it. It reminds me of a buttermilk-and-fruit smoothie my mom used to make for my family. Also love that it's a relatively healthy sweet treat.

Absolutely vile! No Indian restaurant in the UK would serve this, and even though US Indians are nowhere near as good I think they would be ashamed of it too. A lassi, whether sweet or salty, is always made with yoghurt.

A mango lassi is definitely made with yogurt, not buttermilk... I just tried this variation, as I found a great deal on some very nice ataulfo mangos. Tastes like mangos with buttermilk, tastes nothing like a mango lassi. For people trying to make an actual lassi, I suggest yogurt with a splash of cream, milk, or a handful of ice blended in. Maybe a tablespoon or two of sugar if its not quite sweet enough. Flavor with just a hint of cardamom power.

My family owns a indian restaurant and this is not how u make a good Mango lassi. Use a good creamy yogurt, alfanso pulp which has incredible flavor, lots of ice and either a little water or milk to acheive the right consistency...blend well. Trust me on this one.

It was delicious, and my whole family enjoyed it. I used frozen mangoes instead of fresh ones, and added the juice of one fresh lime, and it turned out beautifully.

I love this! I used slightly less buttermilk.

Pretty yummy. I took reviews into consideration and tried half buttermilk, half 2% organic yogurt. Cut the sugar by half. I also added a few strawberries to see what would happen. Dude....you got a summer party on...

I haven't made this, but would like to add a comment. I'm Indian and know a little about yogurt drinks. Lassis are always made with yogurt, and are traditionally sweet. Indians also make 'spiced' yogurt drinks with ginger and chillies, but that's a different beast altogether. A note on the mangoes - some of the best mango lassi is made with Alphonso mangoes, which have incomparable flavor, and smooth, string-free flesh. If you can't get your hands on these, try using canned Alphonso pulp, which is quite readily available, over here at least. The pulp IS sweetened, so skip the sugar in the recipe.

I think this was very good, but it tasted too much of the buttermilk. 3/4 of a quart would be much better.

Although I prefer yogurt instead of buttermilk, I can't believe anyone would call this disgusting... remember, this is an indian drink, not your typical smoothie. Be prepared for something a bit more exotic.

This was the worst smoothie i have ever tasted. I usually love mango but this was desgusting. It is a little bit better with yogurt instead of butter milk. I advise you not to try this unless you want to be sick for a week.

I prefer making my lassis with yogurt and water, as described by several other reviewers. Another way to make a mango drink: scrape out all the flesh from a very ripe mango (they will be soft, but not mushy, and smell strongly of mango), adding milk (as much as you desire - depending if you like your drink thick or thin), sugar (to taste), and ice. Blend the whole thing together and you get a delicious summer drink.

I LOVE THIS DISH! I got over 6 complements on how good it was. Everybody needs to make this!

I agree with others who used yogurt instead of buttermilk. My son who's 25 and will try anything hated the buttermilk but loved the yogurt. It is so much better with the yogurt. I used the frozen mangoes I got at Trader Joe's and the lassi's were delicious.

The description suggests using Champagne mangos. I can't get them at my local grocer but they sell them at the Asian market. (p.s. Every lassi I've had has been made with yogurt...)

The recipe uses buttermilk probably because the Indian version of buttermilk is made from lightly whipping yogurt and blending with water. You can use yogurt and water in the recipe instead of buttermilk

I have not made this recipe yet, but my husband and I frequent a popular Indian restaurant where we live, and we cannot have dinner there without a mango lassi. But as one of the reviewers said, it is a yogurt drink, so why buttermilk in this one, and can you use the frozen mango pulp instead of fresh?

Although this is a very good SMOOTHIE and not a LASSI,(Lassi is a YOGURT drink) the butter milk makes a nice tangy balance to the very sweet mango. I will try this again with other sweet fruit. I was very puzzled by the lime wedge garnish, but I guess it is cute for company. A mango lassi makes a nice foil to most spicy dishes the trick is to sip just enough to kill the spiciness before your next bite.

What would this delicious-sounding drink be served with? Curry?

I make this drink with 1 1/2 cups plain yogurt and 1 cup water. Sugar to taste. Blend everything together. You need to strain only if the fruit has fiber that is not blended.

I have had a drink like this before but used Mango, Maple/Vanilla Yogurt from the Health Food Store, crushed ice, and omit the sugar, which is also excellent. You can experiment a lot with this one.

I was unsure about the buttermilk, but this turned out to be a terrific smoothie. My husband has already been experimenting with a blueberry version, and I think the basic recipe's going to become a household staple.
