This was a big hit at a party - yummy without being too heavy. Like a bite of a great salad. I roasted the beets, skipped the cookie cutter and just sliced and cut them into pieces that would fit the goat cheese. Loved the sorrel, always looking for good ways to use it from my herb garden.

Made this for our Shabbat group last night and received rave reviews. Used a local fresh cheese from Zingerman's Creamery called Sharon Hollow, flavored with black pepper, fresh sorrel from my garden, and substituted parsnips, sliced and roasted with pepper and olive oil, for the beets. I was sorry about the lack of color, but the taste of the carmelized parsnips with the peppery cheese and lemony sorrel was divine.

I used sorrel and beets from my garden and a mildly herbed goat cheese. Both my husband and I thought the flavors didn't go together.

Wow. Got some sorrel in my box from the CSA and had never heard of it before. This recipe came up and I tried it . I am a huge fan now. The sorrel is so lemony and perfect with the sweet beets. Yum

Great appetizer if you are trying to keep it light and not fill everyone up before a special meal. Nice summer garden flavors; we served it alongside the Miniature Crab Cakes w/ Tomato Ginger Jam & poured Groth 2004 Sauvignon Blanc (a grapefruit-y wine). It was a good match.

Yum! These are a great appetizer. I used regular old red beets and basil in place of the sorrel. Following the instructions using the plastic wrap and oil makes it simple. Will definately be making this again.
