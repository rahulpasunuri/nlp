Mouth-puckering tart. Needs more sugar. Some desserts just cannot be made "light" - don't even try with this one. Stick to the original recipe and eat a small slice instead. Crust was uninteresting too.

Rather than being tart and refreshing, this seemed pretty sour. It's a good idea - it just doesn't quite live up to it in the reality.
