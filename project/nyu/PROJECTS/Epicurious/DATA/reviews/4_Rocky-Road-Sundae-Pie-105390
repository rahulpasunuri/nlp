Amazing!! Followed a lot of the suggestions below which were all great tips (oreo cookie crust is to die for!, 1x marshmallow sauce in middle+ x1/2 drizzled on top, long time in freezer between layers). Be careful to soften it up before serving. Even after 30mins in the fridge before serving, it was hard to cut, so I had to cut slices in kitchen with a serrated knife. I found it even better when we ate the left-overs in a softer/gooey-er state the next day. A dark chocolate rich ice cream and toasted pecans are key ingredients to not being too sweet (btw, makes prob over 16 portions, not 12!)

This is a wonderful dessert. It's not complicated to do, the only thing is that it would be best to refrigerate it a day before serving, mostly because of the ice cream. Also, if you don't have chocolate wafers, you can use vanilla wafers and just mix with some cocoa powder. it works, it's what i did. your guest will be marveled.

Made this for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit. This is an easy recipe to put together and makes a great impression. We're definitely making it next year and have already begun thinking of variations.

I ending up making this for a family gathering on Mother's Day. Everyone loved it. I had a hard time finding chocolate wafers for the crust so I ended up using chocolate graham crackers. The only thing I may suggest is that you should pre-stir the softened ice cream so it's easier to spread. Also, after the first layer of ice cream, marshmallow sauce and chocolate sauce is applied the layer should be re-frozen longer than 10 minutes so the 2nd layer doesn't mix with the first. If you have time, 1-2 hours may be better. Overall a great desert.

I made the mistake of using frozen yogurt. Ice Cream would have been much better

Made this for a dinner party last evening - both adults and kids loved it. I took the advice of another reviewer and used store-bought marshmallow fluff and the results were great. To make the fluff more spreadable, I microwaved it with a little butter for 15 seconds. What I really like is the versatility of this recipe. I used one layer of chocolate and 1 layer of vanilla, but you could use any combination. I will make this again. My dinner guests wanted the recipe.

W-O-W...What an exceptionally easy and delicious dessert. I did as several other reviewers did and used Oreo cookies in place of the chocolate wafers. I used toasted pecans for the nuts and I cheated and used store-bought marshmallow fluff instead of the do-it-yourself kind listed in the recipe. It was super easy (and made the whole thing kosher dairy for my Jewish guests). Everyone LOVED this recipe.

Off the hook delicious! I also used half chocolate, half vanilla ice cream. Also used Oreo cookies WITH the cream filling, for the crust. I made extra Marshmallow sauce and left it a little chunky. Lots of different things you can do with this..and the leftover fudge sauce can be used over a bowl of ice cream as well!

A big hit at an adults-only party. Used chocolate ice cream for one layer, vanilla for the second--better contrast of flavors, I think, & a prettier presentation. Served it with extra fudge sauce made with semi-sweet chocolate, cream, a little coffee, butter & rum. A very good dessert made even more decadent!

I made this for my boyfriend for our anniversary and he LOVED it! However, the key to a man's heart is OREO Cookie Wafers NOT Chocolate Wafer Cookies, and don't melt the marshmallows into a soup so it's more traditional 'rocky road' style ... :)

I was sure I must have left something out of this recipe because I wasn't too impressed. It was basically just ice cream in a cookie crust. The marshmallow sauce was nice, but not overwhelmingly terrific, & the chocolate sauce pretty much blended into the ice cream. I omitted the nuts, (couldn't bear to hear the whining from the children on Xmas Eve), maybe that was the problem. After the other glowing reviews I was surprised.

very easy. substituted caramel sauce (store bought) for marshmallow as I needed a kosher recipe and couldn't find kosher marshmallows (Gelatin is from animal and therefore can't be used with dairy). delicious and super easy. My husband requested spanish peanuts next time I make it. MANY MONTHS LATER... I have made many versions of this. My favorite now is even easier than the original. I use 1/2 pkg of oreos (9 ozs) including cream centers with 4 TBS of butter. grind in processor and follow crust directions. I use the other 1/2 pkg (9 ozs) in the middle layer with fudge topping. I use Breyers mint chip and chocolate. This, to me, was truly decliciou. Kids and adults gobbled it up.

Really easy to make and it does look like you slaved all day :) I used pecans rather then walnuts,also used breyers chocolate ice-cream. I might try dark chocolate next time. This was really good but quite sweet. MANY MONTHS LATER....this has become a favourite dessert within my whole family I now almost always use Breyers all naturel vanilla bean ice cream mu sister has requested the chocolate version again so I guess you cann't please everyone......This IS SOOOO GOOODDD :)

Made this recipe several times and it never lasts long, even when other deserts are served. Even those on diets can't resist. Substituted Bryers Rocky Road Ice Cream...incredibly good!!!

It's a very sweet desert and very satisfying. My guests really loved it. I would make this again and again. I also would make a little more marshmello sauce.

A cinch to make, but looks as though you've slaved for hours... you'll fool everyone! Tasted wonderful. I may make a little more of both the marshmallow sauce and the chocolate sauce for the middle layer next time.
