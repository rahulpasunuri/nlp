This is wonderful. I added minced garlic, shredded parmesan cheese and paprika. Instead of mixing it all together, I layered it in the casserole, brushing it with the butter/oil mixture (2 T extra virgin olive oil & 1T. roasted garlic olive oil) and then the seasonings and cheese on each layer. It got rave reviews on New Year's Eve.

This was so easy and SO good. I served this to guests for New Years dinner and the crispy potatoes were a big hit. I added minced garlic and lots of salt and pepper. I used convection to get them nicely browned and a crispy top.

Last minute menu addition for unexpected guests (filler dish) worked great! I did add some fresh garlic and a titch of rosemary and used red potatoes that I had on hand. Good basic recipe for those who like to add things!

This was easier to make than I thought and delicious. The potatoes melt in your mouth. I made this for Christmas day brunch and it was a hit. I would not change a thing on the recipe.

This came out crunchy, soggy and greasy simultaneously, which seems an achievement of some sort.

Disappointing. There wasn't much flavor to speak of, though I was forced to use russet potatoes instead of yukon gold. This recipe needs some serious doctoring to get made again...
