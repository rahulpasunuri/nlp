Very delicious for something so simple! I cut the onion into 12 wedges, used 10 sprigs of marjoram, and extra lemon juice and zest (thanks to the other reviewers for the suggestions!). I put parchment on the baking sheets to avoid using cooking spray, which I think is gross. The beans are actually better the next day, after soaking up the lemony flavor in the fridge. I really didn't taste the marjoram -- next time I will try fresh thyme, perhaps lemon thyme to complement the citrus.

Even the non-veggie eaters in my family loved this dish. We made it without the onions and subbed fresh thyme for the marjoram. Definitely a hit.

Loved this recipe. Used dried marjoram instead of fresh (didn't have any) and just regular almonds. Delicious!

I used shallots instead of onions, a little extra lemon juice, dried thyme instead of marjoram, and regular slivered almonds toasted, and it was delicious! Very easy and tasty, and a hit at Thanksgiving.

Trader Joe's sells marcona almonds:)

I made this for the second time tonight. I used a thinner french style green bean both times. The first time, I followed the directions exactly and I thought the beans were a little too brown and they did not have as much lemon flavor as I desired. This time, I only used one pan for the beans, but kept the cooking time the same. I also doubled the zest and 1.5 the juice. I also used oregano (could not get marjoram.) I liked it much better this way and will definitely make it again.

Quoth my husband: always make green beans this way! I used baby French beans and they only needed 15 minutes to cook. Would use less almonds next time.

This was a winner! I decided to make this last minute and used sliced roasted almonds. I will look for Marcona almonds next time. I used shallots, as was suggested, and fresh rosemary - didn't have marjoram. Will definitely make again.

Using regular almonds rather than marconas is NOT the same recipe at all. the marconas are what make this dish fabulous! They are the reason I will be making this dish for the third year in a row at Thanksgiving, in addition to several other times during the year!

Very good but not wonderful. Used regular almonds. Unique and different tasting green beans.

I made this for Thanksgiving. It was super easy & very delicious. I didn't have the marcona almonds, but can't wait to try it again with them. I did cut the onions smaller as suggested by another cook.

I really liked this. I couldn't find the Marcona almonds which was disappointing, but the regular roasted almonds were fine. I used a couple of shallots cut into wedges rather than the onion.

Light and delicious. My clumsiness tried to ruin this dish several times; firstly, by letting it roast 3 minutes too long, secondly, by spilling salt into the bowl while I was mixing in the lemon juice and zest. It still turned out good, salty, but good. I couldn't find marcona almonds, I just used diamond smoked/salted that I had on hand. I don't think it mattered. I like the way the onion roasts as well!

Wow!! Awesome! I would add more onion next time. Used rosemary instead of marjoram and chopped it. Delicious!

Made this last Thanksgiving and it was a big hit-even with people who don't usually like green beans. Definitely will be a Thanksgiving staple!

Verry tasty, I used rosemary instead of marjoram and pine nuts instead of almonds since that's what I had available. But definitely will try Marcona almonds next time since those are delicious.

Rating: 3
So yummy, and no need to wait for the holidays with this one. I halved the recipe, and it was the perfect side dish for a simple Sunday supper. Marcona almonds are essential. I used thyme instead of marjoram, because that's what I had in the garden, and it paired wonderfully with the lemon flavors.

I made EXACTLY as written using Vidalia onion and baked as directed...soooo good

Great recipe! Like others, I decreased the amount of the time in the oven, going with 20 minutes. Even then, I thought it might have been too long.

I used a bit more lemon than called for, added some julienned carrots, and just used slivered blanched almonds I had sitting around. It turned out wonderfully, I really loved the tangy flavor of the lemon mixed with the green beans.

The cooking time was way too long. Next time I'll dice the onions and roast everything for 15 minutes.

This is THE best green bean dish ever! Very flavorful and easy. The marcona almonds are a must and can be found at Trader Joes or Whole Foods. Didn't have marjoram on hand so used thyme. I will make it again for Easter as it is always a hit. Even non-veggie eaters go back for seconds!

Made this last night and was amazed at how simple and elegant it was. Omitted the marjoram, didn't have any. Only need a few marcona almonds to make it really special. A definate keeper.

Sounded too simple to be this good. Made at last minute and had no almonds, but still great. Cook a couple of minutes less than recipe says. Kids loved it!

Delicious - enjoyed by all at a dinner party. I did need to cook them a few minutes less than the recipe said or they would have been overdone. Easy and elegant.

Wow, was this delicious! The lemon peel really gave it a good punch. I didn't have marjoram,so I just used oregano. I also used French Beans, which were excellent, and plus added some roasted garlic. I would make this over and over again, it was such a hit with everyone. So refreshing.

Simple and delicious....a crowd pleaser. Have made this 3 times throughout the holidays. Didn't have fresh marjoram and substituted dried thyme...also delicious.

This was a hit! The lemon was a delight to the meal and offered a freshness to the green beans that was nicely countered by the almonds. I could not find the Marcona almonds, but was pressed for time and was only shopping my local food co-op. Don't worry about the salt and that it will be too much, I have always found that green beans are a bit insipid and a generous salting really brings out the flavor. I did use course sea salt which I find more to my tastes, or as a friend said to me when I turned her on to sea salt: "It's not as salty, if that makes sense."

This was exceptional, very easy to make and a huge hit at Thanksgiving. I couldn't find the Marcona Almonds but all the same it was great with California almonds.

This was a great green bean dish. I used baby blue lake green beans because I could not find the french hariot verts that I prefer, but they stayed green and crisp to the table. One caution is that the oil and the high heat combined to make a very smokey oven and kitchen right before dinner was served.

very good green bean dish, however, high temps in oven w/ oil made my kitchen pretty smokey

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were truly fantastic. Best if served right out of the oven. I will be making these again and again.

Wonderful! Made as directed, and they had a great flavor. Served as a side to salmon.

I've made this dish twice, and I agree with the idea of steaming or blanching the beans. They end up gray otherwise. I also use pearl onions, which are a pain to prepare, but make for a more visually appealing preparation.

I had this as part of the overall Country Thanksgiving menu from the Nov issue. It was great. Easy to make, and very delicious. This will become a regular dish at our home. We made it with almonds we roasted in our toaster oven and it was great.

Made this for dinner along with a baked salmon. It was delicious. I omitted the majoram (didn't have any, don't care for), and my store didn't carry the Marcona Almonds, although I have used those almonds for other dishes. For this one, I used slivered almonds. Delicious! Even my husband who isn't a big green bean fan, liked this dish. Will make it again soon. I would suggest you watch the roasting time and temp. I put these in to roast along with the salmon at about 375 degrees F. The salmon was half way cooked before I put in the beans. I removed the salmon then cooked the beans the rest of the way, tasting now and then for doneness. This would make a great luncheon dish. Or served by itself for lunch alone (or in my case, with retired hubby.)

I too had trouble with the beans losing their color and coming out a little wilted. I think those that executed this recip on the grill have the right idea.

This is excellent. Made it on Thanksgiving to rave reviews. We didn't have room in the oven, so ended up tossing them on the BBQ and it turned out fabulous.

Excellent Thanksgiving side dish. Followed the recipe exactly, but would slice the onions more thinly next time. The marcona almonds were key to the dish!

Great side dish for Thanksgiving. Since my turkey was cooking in the oven, I ended up roasting the beans outside on the grill. It worked out very well. I could't find Marcona almonds so used slivered with no problem.

Great,simple recipe. I ran out of time so I steamed the beans instead. This made them a bright, beautiful green.Don't skip on the Marcona almonds,they are "different" and a better type of nut for this dish. I served this to a crowd of 15 and all truly enjoyed it!

Green beans lost their vivid color; next time, I would just blanch the beans. Liked the rest of the recipe, though.

Made this for Thanksgiving using regular almonds. It was a hit with the crowd, although it was visually unimpressive. As suggested, next time I would blanch the green beans first and shorten the roasting time.

very good and simple. I've made it with mini zucchini, instead of green beans and some left over cherry tomatoes and it came out beautifully. Also, had to use Meyer lemon. Will make this often.

I can't get enough of these beans! I used thyme instead of the marjoram and regular almonds.

We've made these twice in the past twice weeks for various functions and had requests for the recipe each time. The only change my husband made was to increase the marjoram to 10 sprigs and strip and chop the leaves- it enhances the herb flavor. Cooking time was perfect.

Great side dish to pair with heavier courses. The lemon is very refreshing but not overwhelming. Will try with almonds next time.
