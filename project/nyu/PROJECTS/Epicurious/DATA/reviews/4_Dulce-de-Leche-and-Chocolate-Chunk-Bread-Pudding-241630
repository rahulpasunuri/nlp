I made it the first time with the chocolate and everyone liked it. I thought it was a bit much. I have made it without the chocolate and my guests raved about it. I have never made it with the chocolate again.

i made this as a dessert for christmas dinner and EVERYONE loved it, my uncle who hates sweets ate two helpings! i added almost double the chocolate and a bit of extra rum and it was amazing! a true keeper.

Any recipe that calls for store bought caramel is total junk. Not worth it. Make your own caramel sauce and you will realize the store bought stuff with high fructose corn syrup and artificial flavoring can't even come close.

This is good, but not outstanding. It tastes a lot like a gooey chocolate chip cookie. It took closer to 50 minutes to cook and it really puffed up - but then sank. Don't add a full tablespoon of butter to the baking dish. I had to pour butter off the edges when it was done cooking.

I love bread pudding and this is a fast, easy and tasty one! You can use brioche or old bread and it will taste as great!

"...comfort dessert for sunday night"....were your tastebuds still numb from the novocaine when you ate this (previous reviewer)? this was quite possibly one of the best desserts i've ever eaten in my 30-some, dessert-laden years of life. it was so good my brain released a flood of endorphins as if it were a drug. i was helpless to stop myself from having a second piece. the bittersweet chocolate is just perfect...keeps it from being too sweet. the symphony of flavors, the perfect textures. it all works together so beautifully. if i could have some sort of iv drip that would deliver this flavor to my taste buds on a regular basis, i would be hooked up 24/7. it's not a dessert, it's a work of art. oh, and it's probably significant that i've always hated bread pudding until i tried this one. 4 forks is an insult.

I thought it was just ok too. I also added banana to mine and that helped. I don't think it was an impressive dessert to serve to company - more like a nice comfort dessert for sunday nights. Like rice pudding or apple betty.

Maybe I used too much bread but I thought this was too bland. I even added some bananas for a little extra flavor but I won't make it again. my guests liked it. I

I loved the idea of this. Nothing makes me happier than caramel and chocolate. I just thought it was okay, nothing worth making again. I am not even sure what it needed, possibly some sort of sauce to pour over?

I have made this several times. After the first, folks have begged me to make it again. I have not used egg bread but rather Canadian White with the crust cut off. I imagine an egg bread would be even better. I have also tried it with high quality semisweet chips instead of the bittersweet and had it work well too. You should love it. Enjoy.

Very nice stuff. Everyone liked it a lot. Can make it with regular bread as well - used old Pepperidge Farm white bread.

I don't think I did anything wrong... But I really did not like the texture or taste very much- Have tried other bread puddings on this site which were much much better. Some of my guests liked it though

Awesome. Make your own carmel sauce (on Epicurious as well)-it's worth the little bit of extra time.

Delicious. Brought it to a party and got raves. Not a morsel left. Used croissants and semi-sweet chocolate chips. Definitely did not need any sauce or whipped cream - stood on its own perfectly well! A great apres-ski dessert.

super easy to prepare and smells just divine while its baking. used crossiants, made my own dulce de leche topping, opted not to add the rum and topped the whole thing off with vanilla bean ice cream. it was a great way to end the night.

This is now one of my favorite recipes - delicious! Couldn't find egg bread, so used an italian loaf bread and I couldn't tell we were missing out. Also, I didn't end up having bittersweet chocolate chips on hand like I thought, so I used semi-sweet instead and they weren't overpowering and were delicious. I'll definitely be making this again!

A little more rum and a sprinkle of walnuts on top. Good with either ice cream or whip cream. Very easy to put together.

I used good quality everything, made my own dulce de leche (from David Leibovitz's recipe), but after reading all of the rave reviews, this didn't blow my mind. It's a solid dessert, but I've had better. Next time I'll try something different.

Very good. My husband thought it was a little too chocolaty; I thought it was quite good.

Rating: 4
OMG!! This was so heavenly! I took this to a gourmet cooking club and not only did they rave about but they talked about it all evening long! I used butterscotch caramel topping and plain Nestle semi-sweet chocolate chunks. We loved the hint of rum. Also, the measurement of the chunks was spot on, perfect balance, got a pop of chocolate every other bite!

Rating: 4
This was one of the best desserts ever! We left the rum out (didn't want to make a special trip to the liquor store) and we didn't miss it at all. We also used french-toast bread and let it soak for 45 minutes- unbelievable! Topped with a little vanilla ice-cream, this can and should replace birthday cake and a variety of other ho-hum desserts. We will keep this recipe for special occasions for years to come!

This is good but not great and not worth the calories in my opinion. With that said, I used half-n-half instead of full cream. I have made other bread pudding recipes that I like more, but the caramel background was nice.

Rating: 4
I substituted dark chocolate truffles that I chopped and froze so they would not disappear in the bread pudding, and that turned out great! Everyone raved about this, and I will absolutely make it again.

Excellent recipe but I'd omit the chocolate next time. It overwhelmed the dulce de leche flavor.

Rating: 4
The only change I made was using a black current liquor instead of the rum. It was great; just a hint of fruit. I would cook if for slightly less time than called for or use a smaller pan next time. I served it with a little vanilla ice cream, but I thought the ice cream flavor took away from the bread pudding flavor, which was very rich and satisfying. Excellent and particularly nice on a cold evening!

Tasty, with many options for substitution! My bread was croissants, I made a dulce de leche sauce using a simple recipe on this site, and even used milk in place of some of the cream. Still delicious and easy.

I made this the first time several months ago and my friends are still talking about this fabulous dessert! I made it in the morning, but undercooked it so that I could warm it up (and finish cooking) at a dinner party that evening. I used good quality ingredients, which I think it made all the difference. I used Guittard chocolate and sauce (a Bay Area company) that can be found at most good grocery stores. This dessert is very rich and very impressive. I'm making it again this weekend.

This recipe went over very well for Thanksgiving. It was easy to make and delicious. I used brioche bread, Smucker's Hot Caramel sauce and Ghardelli's 60% cacao bittersweet chips for the recipe. The Ghardelli's chips and brioche really made the recipe, but in the future, I might try to find a nicer caramel sauce.

Ohmygod, if I could give this recipe 5 forks, I would. It was so rich and lovely with the carmel and chocolate together, my guests were happy with a small portion. It was fabulous warmed up in the microwave the next day, too. I've already made this recipe twice and it was so easy, I'm planning on this being my signature dessert for a while.

first time i followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. the second time, for guests with some health issues, i eliminated the egg yolks and the butter and used fat free half and half instead of whipping cream. still terrific.

Have made it for a few people and now it has become a signature dessert! Used half whipping cream and half milk.Also made my own dulche de leche sauce by boiling can of sweetened condensed milk. Making it to take tomorrow for a dinner party. Simply wonderful!

This was wonderful. I didn't change the recipe a bit, I just started watching it at about 25 minutes so that I didn't overcook it. It was perfect at 30 minutes. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe the next day.

Just the Best!!

very good but it needs some tweaking. i think it could use a bit more heavy cream and dulce de leche to make it more custardy and pudding like. i made it exactly as stated except that i decreased cooking time to just 25 minutes and it came out delicious but more like cake than pudding.

Rating: 3
It came out very good, I just wish that the caramel taste was more abundant. The chocolate chips tended to overwhelm. But for my first crack at bread pudding it turned out delightful! I'm doing it again for a friend's birthday.

This is a great, but very rich dessert, I suggest serving with ice cream. You could cut the recipe in half as it is a very large batch. It is definitely a dessert almost anyone would love.

Rating: 4
This is a marvelous recipe, especially if you are a fan of sweet deserts. Using semi-sweet or dark chocolate chips helps balance the caramel, and it goes particularly well with vanilla ice cream. Toasting the bread isn't necessary, as it's meant to mimic stale bread; I tore up the slices and left them uncovered for a day, and got the same results. I will definitely be making this again. Next time, I will experiment with differet liquors for the custard!

Outstanding!! Used butterscotch Schapps instead of Rum, which added to the carmel flavor. A favorite!

I couldn't find egg bread so I substituted croissants. They worked surprisingly well. It went over great!

I took another reviewer's suggestion and used cinnamon swirl bread instead of egg bread. I also used cognac instead of the rum, which gave the dessert a great flavor. For presentation, I made a little chocolate sauce, and drizzled the pudding and ice cream with it and the dulce de leche sauce. Made it for the family, and they still haven't stopped talking about it!

This was fantastic. I was afraid it might be to sweet and was surprised by the balance of flavor. My local store was out of challah so I substituted cinnamon swirl egg bread. It was so good I would never make it with any other bread. I doubled the recipe for a group of 8 men and two women and served with vanilla ice cream, no sauce. There wasn't a crumb left.

My daughter requested this dessert for her 18th birthday. I epi'ed a recipe for the Dulce de Leche sauce instead of using store bought. All I can say is WOW! Better the second day, warmed and drizzled with the sauce. A repeat performance today on Mother's Day.

Is it rich? Yes. Is it fattening? Yes. But boy is it worth it! Unrestrained gratification. We just made it this evening for a tough- to-please crowd and everyone loved it.

I made this for Easter dessert and got rave reviews. I doubled the recipe and used an 11x15x2" pan, which worked beautifully. I also made my own dulce de leche, from an Epicurious recipe using dark brown sugar, whipping cream and sweetened condensed milk. I couldn't find enough egg bread, so I used a loaf of day-old french bread and I thought it was as good as using two challahs (remember I doubled the recipe). Made one day in advance, left it slightly undercooked, then put it in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes right before serving and it was perfect!

After 10 years in my cooking group, this dessert was voted #1! It was easy, I shaved scharfenberg chocolate instead of the chocolate chips and used 1/4 cup more of the heavy whipping cream and probably just as much more of the dulce de leche. It was amazing!

There are not enough superlatives for how ridiculously good this was. I made it for my husband for Valentine's Day and we both had two helpings -- oink oink! But it was just that good. I used the dulce de leche recipe from Epicurious.

Made this for a dinner party last night. Did not toast the bread with butter in an attempt to make this a teeny bit less fattening. Vanilla ice cream and additional sauce are a must. Even bread pudding skeptics licked their bowls. I used more bread, about 16 slices of Challah (I think they were slightly less than a half inch thick) I could have used another slice or to. Baked it for about 10 min longer to cook it through.

The magazine picture had me hooked and the recipe is wonderful. I used the dulce de leche sauce recipe from this website with coconut milk and brown sugar. Next time I'll try it low fat without buttering the bread and omitting the whipping cream.

I was very excited about this recipe, yet was disappointed in the results. I let the bread soak for ~45min. but found when I served it that it was drier and less pudding/custard-like than I would have hoped. Microwaved leftovers today with ice cream are better.

I make my own dulce de leche sauce according to the recipe from a Peruvian roomie in college. Gently boil an unopened can of sweetened condensed milk for at least two hours in a pot with water. It's that simple. Open and pour--delicious. Great with this bread pudding recipe.
