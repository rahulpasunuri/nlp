Easy and basic. I was very happy with the light flavor of the lemon, although my husband didn't love it. I did use balsamic and olive oil, which was wonderful. I think I'll just cut out the basting next time and it will be perfect.

This is one of my all time favorite zuke recipes! Try experimenting with different vinegars and fresh herbs--balsalmic vinger and fresh basil are great. So are cilantro and white wine vinegar!

I'm a tough customer when it comes to zucchini - this was the best zucchini I've ever tasted, hands down. I followed the recipe exactly and grilled it using hickory chips which imparted a subtle and sublime smokey taste to the already wonderful marinade. I'm stuffed and I still want more of this dish! You won't be disappointed.

From previous reviewer's suggestion, used balsamic&olive oil, YUM! And because winter is happening in PA, did a lively saute with good result.

For such a simple recipe, this is just delicious. I have already prepared this several times, and my husband and I just love it! Try mixing zuchinni and yellow squash for variation.

Substitute Basalmic vinager and olive oil for the white wine vinager and plain oil - MUCH better result!!

while grilled zucchini can be extremely tasty, this particular recipie is not very imaginative.
