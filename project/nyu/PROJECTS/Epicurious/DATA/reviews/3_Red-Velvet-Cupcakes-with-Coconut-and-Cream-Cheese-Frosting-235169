This recipe gave me an excellent framework. Here are my recipe modifications: I used 1/3 cup buttermilk, 2/3 cup whole milk, and 1 rounded teaspoon baking powder. Also, I used all-purpose flour instead of self-rising flour. I modified the frosting recipe by using half as much coconut. PLEASE NOTE: the butter measurement is incorrect in the ingredient list, but is spot-on for the food prep portion of the recipe. My cupcakes were light, airy, fluffy, and generally delicious.

This definitely wasn't my favorite red velvet recipe. The coconut is a nice touch but it had too much cream cheese and too strong of a chocolate flavor. I reviewed it in detail on my blog http://misschefy.wordpress.com

So I am partially reviewing this to make sure I remember the modifications I made. In place of self-rising flour I put in 1 t. baking soda, 1 t. corn starch and 1/2 t. salt before filling the rest of the measuring cup with flour. In place of buttermilk I used 1/2 c. sour cream and 1/2 c. 1% milk. The rest of the recipe I followed. The cupcakes ended up moist and not too dense. I love how chocolately this comes out. So many recipes call for a paltry 1 or 2 T of cocoa. I haven't tried the frosting yet as that is a job for tomorrow. Finally, in regards to where to find buttermilk. I live in New England and it's not the most common thing but it is not at all rare. I often have success finding it in grocery stores, especially the smaller ones.

There's a great bakery here in town and their red velvet cupcakes don't hold a candle to the ones I made with this recipe. The cake itself is so moist and unusual in its flavor--owing, I'm sure, to the buttermilk and vinegar. I might find a way to thin the icing a bit for better spreading, but these are great.

Is it me or does this recipe really use only 1 cup of butter? 3/4 C in the cupcake, 1/4 cup in the frosting, yet the ingredient list calls for 2 c?

Really good, but I'd recommend using less red dye than the recipe calls for. I used less than half and my cupcakes were *very* red.

These do come out quite heavy, but I liked them that way--they had enough flavor that it wasn't overwhelming, just very satisfying. The frosting is really delicious and goes well with the cake. These are a huge hit every time I make them.

I had a request for red velvet cupcakes from a friend for her birthday. Not having made this kind of cake before I followed the recipe to a "T". I was SO disappointed with the results. The cupcakes were extremely dense and did not have a very good flavor. The frosting is great, however. I have gone with the recipe for the red velvet cake with berries for my cupcakes. Much Better!!

I baked these for my daughter's birthday. They were as dark as dark chocolate, unlike my mother's waldorf astoria red cake. I will make my mother's recipe in cupcake pans - and do my favorite chocolate when I want dark chocolate. My daughter was ot impressed with this recipe!

Cooled cakes in pan for 10 minutes, as instructed. Cupcake liners stuck to the non-stick pan, cakes just disentegrated. I was left with a terrible mess. Mess tasted ok, but not worth the effort. Only 6 cakes were worthy of the party they were intended for.

Okay, smartasses... if you had ever been to a farmer's market, then you would know that there are usually several local dairies on hand. Eggs, butter, cream cheese... any of these could have been procured from the market. But my money is on the inspiration coming from the buttermilk, which is (A) hard to find at farmer's markets outside the south, and (B) considerably better there than at supermarkets.

Produce market? Inspiration? No, not the red dye #2; it must be the coconuts that are grown in North Carolina!

I made the recipe as directed. The cupcakes were a little heavy, and not as smooth as other red velvet recipes I've tried, but still tasty. I was left with a ton of unused frosting though. I could have gotten away with about a third of the frosting recipe.

These were wonderful. It was nice to be able to have red velvet without making the whole cake. I love the addition of coconut to the icing.
