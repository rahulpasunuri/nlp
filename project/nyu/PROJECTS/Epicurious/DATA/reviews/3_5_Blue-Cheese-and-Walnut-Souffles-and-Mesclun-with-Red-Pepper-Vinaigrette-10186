My first souffle, so perhaps that's why it wasn't great. It had an almost omlette-like texture and despite using a strong blue stilton I could barely taste the blue, so it ended up being quite bland. (Any suggestions on the cheese or giving it some more flavour). However, together with the vinaigrette it was quite nice, but not delicious or exceptional.

Awesomely yum! I'm a tentative blue cheese fan - took me a long time to feel the love - but the taste was subtly delicious. The souffle and salad would be great for a dinner party. I've given this four forks even though Husband refused to touch it. He is only intermittently tolerant of blue cheese - but still - I figured his tolerance must embrace souffle if it was THAT good. Evidently not. If anyone's interested, there's a photo of it on deadlyjellydotcom - search under blue cheese if you can't see the post x

Most excellent! Been making this for years to the delight of my family. The souffles can be made a day ahead and refrigerated then popped in the oven for a quick warm up right before serving. I use pecans instead of walnuts and use stilton for a little extra punch.

This was not that great. Walnuts did not stick properly, and souffles didn't rise very high. Texture and flavor were good, but color was greyish and dead looking. I wouldn't make again.

Huh. This just didn't turn out nearly as good as I had hoped based on previous reviews. We found it to be quite bland. I'm sorry to say I wasn't able to find blue saga in Sweden!!! Had to substitute blue castello. Maybe that was the problem? I also found the walnut flavor disappeared. You REALLY have to butter the ramekins and have the walnuts VERY finely chopped to get them to adhere. Unfortunately it just didn't seem worth the effort. But I am inspired to try another single serving souffle with salad presentation. The upside is I made the buttermilk ice cream recipe (the one with creme fraiche) with the leftover egg yolks...it's fantastic.

Absolutely excellent! If you have not made souffles before, this is the perfect recipe to try. It's also the perfect recipe for a large dinner party and overnight guests as the souffles can be made a day ahead. It all comes together very easily with no changes to make. You'll love your guests response as every morsel is savored.

I made these for a formal dinner party with rave reviews. They really make for a beautiful presentation. I made them the day before and reheated with no problems. Really coat the ramekins well with the walnuts for the best look afterwards. Almost forgot... they tasted GREAT! I will make this again for sure.

I made this for a dinner party, presentation was beautiful. I only gave this two forks because I used goat cheese instead of blue cheese (some of my guest don't like blue cheese) and I think it would have tasted delightful with the blue cheese. However, everyone loved the salad. I would still make this again, next time with the blue cheese.

Great recipe and the souffle is just heavenly. I love making this for formal dinners. It can be made ahead of time and reheated.

I really like this recipe b/c you can mess some things up and it still turns out great. One difficulty that I had was with the walnut crumbs. I would recommend making sure they are toasted really well, otherwise they are kind of clumpy and don't stick to the buttered ramekins very well. For the viniagrette, I roasted red and yellow peppers and pureed them with the oil and vinegar, it was wonderful! The salad makes a great presentation with red and yellow peppers as garnish.

Have been making this recipe since I first saw it in May of 93, and always to raves. It is easy, can be prepared ahead of time and so delicious. I have always been asked for the recipe every time I served it, once served this dish to a dinner party of 30 people, they were amazed.

I AM A BIG LOVER OF BLUE CHEESE AND SOUFFLES SO THIS WAS PERFECT FOR US. I WOULD SUGGEST MAKING THE VINAIGRETTE USING A NICE WALNUT OIL AND BALSALMIC VINAGER. I WILL SURE HAVE THIS AGAIN!!!

Scared of souffles?? This is the one for you since it is allowed to fall, then reheated in its deflated state and served on a salad....delicious and very very pretty. Sprinkle with a few toasted walnuts.
