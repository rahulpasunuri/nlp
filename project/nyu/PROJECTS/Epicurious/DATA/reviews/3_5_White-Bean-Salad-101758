I've made this recipe with canned white beans or cannelini beans, and it comes out wonderful every time! Tasty and healthy!!

Friends all enjoyed this fresh, tasty, easy-to-make salad. Best with great northern beans but pink beans did ok in a pinch. As a twist, I have added smoked trout or smoked peppered salmon, flaked, with excellent results. Makes a big impact for a low-budget dish. Entering the summer cooking rotation as an easy weeknight supper that also makes great leftovers to pack for lunch.

I made this last night and my husband and I couldn't get enough of it. We loved it. I didn't have tarragon on hand so I skipped it and I still really enjoyed it. I put some lemon zest in there to brighten it up. It's a great, light summer salad. This will become a staple for me.

It's hard to make a really delicate white bean salad but this recipe makes it possible through the use of fresh tarragon and crunchy celery. Very good with chicken or lamb.

I thought this turned out OK; my dinner guests loved it and asked for the recipe. Just shows how different palates can be. I was surprised how brightly the tarragon came through. But I was a bit underwhelmed by the recipe.

This is a wonderful and easy salad to make. I have made it several times and served with everything from the recommended chicken to sliced steak and pork. I sometimes substitute basil for the tarragon and parsley and add finely chopped red bell pepper for color. The dressing is delicious.

First had this dish at the home of the President of RI's Johnson and Wales Culinary School and loved it. Have made it several times. Often use the bagged, frozen already cooked cannellini beans to save soaking and cooking. Have used dried tarragon and skipped the chives in a pinch, and still like it a lot. Usually add a smidgen of lemon oil to the vinaigrette (don't overdo -- a little goes a long way) to intensify lemon flavor or some grated lemon peel. I find you can make the vinaigrette earlier than 3 hours before (day before works fine).

"Too much stuff and not enough bean," my purist husband said. I think he was right.

Easy to prepare and very tasty. This salad travelled well to a picnic and was well received by the entire family.
