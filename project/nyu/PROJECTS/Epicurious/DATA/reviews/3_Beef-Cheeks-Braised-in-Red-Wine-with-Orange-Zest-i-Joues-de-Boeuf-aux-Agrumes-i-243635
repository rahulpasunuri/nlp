I added a couple cloves of garlic and about a tbsp of fresh sage to this. I browned the meat and deglazed the pan with some of the wine, then put everything in the crock pot for 8+ hours. The orange is subtle enough and it all comes together very well. Great meal to come home to after work!

loved this. Great comfort food. I would cut back just a bit on the orange but would not eliminate it. Next to drinking it, this is a great way to use a bottle of wine!

This is not a joke recipe. It is a straight forward beef braise. If the sauce is "greasy" it is because the cook left too much fat or didn't skim it. The orange flavors should always compliment the carrots. Delicious, simple, relaxed.

I used beef chuck. (My daughter-in-law laughing referred to this dish as "butt cheeks.") It came out OK. I personally didn't care for the orange rind notes. So, now I know. I won't go that route again. Otherwise, it was a pretty straightforward beef braise in red wine. Nice enough, but nothing special.

Delicious, and easy. I used brisket, rather than beef cheek, as along with the previous reviewer, I didn't know where to source cheek. Served with the Celeriac and potato putee as suggested - a lovely relaxed meal.

I used chuck roast, because I wouldn't know where to get beef cheeks. The sauce was very greasy and not very spectacular in taste or appearance. The carrots were sweet, as stated. Maybe some cloves or some herbs would give more body?
