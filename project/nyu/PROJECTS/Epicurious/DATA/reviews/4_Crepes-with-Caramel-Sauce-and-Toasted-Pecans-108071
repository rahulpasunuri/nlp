Damn - These were exceptional! Not only were the crepes themselves much richer and more delicious than usual, the Cajeta-based filling was am-az-ing! I used brandy and doubled the amount, other than that followed the recipe as written. The sauce also makes an incredible sunday when paired with vanilla ice cream, sliced bananas and freshly roasted pecans, my father in law asked for seconds :-)

Very, very good. My first time making crepes. Some were in more than one piece. Who could tell. Rather than putting the nuts inside the crepes, I would probably just sprinkle over.

YUM!! I cheated and started with dulce de leche, and used Calvados as the liquor, and it was still amazing. Next time I'll add some bananas! Crepes freeze extremely well too.

Excellent, healthy crepes! I make these EVERY weekend and it makes 4 servings for us gobble monsters (it makes enough for the 2 of us for both saturday and sunday). We use 2 tbsp butter to reduce the fat. Yummy!

excellent, everyone always raves, I make extra crepes and freeze them, I keep the rest of the ingredients on hand and it is a wonderful, easy to assemble last minute dessert. There are never any leftovers.

This was wonderful, especially when made with true cajeta. I made this for a group of 25 people and needed a shortcut... pour half of the sauce on the bottom of the pan, top with folded triangles, and then cover with the second half of the sauce. Filling each individual crepe would have taken too long. I served it with cinnamon ice cream and it was so tasty.

This is an awesome recipe! I tried it with the pecans and various additions-sliced bananas or apples. Great with vanilla ice cream. Important to put it in the oven. I served it both after baking not baking. Baking it is clearly is better.

WOW, this is fantastic. Pure heaven on a plate. I used dulce de leche and next time I will make the trek to get the cajeta...just out of curiosity. Can it really be any better? I will find out because I will be making this again. Make sure you save some of the warm sauce and serve over a scoop of vanilla ice cream....very, very nice complement to the warm crepes.

Use the cajeta if you can find it. Dulce de leche is okay, but it pales in comparison to real cajeta.

Although this recipe took a bit of time, it was well worth it!! It was just like what is made in Mexico. I paired it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, which was a delicious combination.

so shoot me because I didn't actually make this recipe... a tasty shortcut/change is to fill crepe with slice fresh bananas, drizzle with purchased caramel sauce if no time to make your own(there are good ones out there), and top with toasted pecans or walnuts. Delicious.
