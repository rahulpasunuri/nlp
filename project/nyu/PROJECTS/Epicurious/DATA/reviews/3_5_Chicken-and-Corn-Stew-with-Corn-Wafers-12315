Great, fresh-tasting stew, even better on day 2. I added the juice of half a lime to brighten it up. I think that resolved the blandness that other reviewers mentioned. Also substituted cilantro for the basil. I'll skip the wafers next time. They weren't worth the effort and all the extra fat they added to the meal.

I made this without the chicken or scallions (I'm a vegetarian who happened to be out of scallions). Even my carnivore husband loved it. I didn't have enough veg stock on hand, so I used liquid from grilled tomatoes I had in the freezer. Amazing. I'm making it again tonight, but definitely doubling the recipe. It went too fast last time. I love that the ingredients are so simple.

This was a simple, tasty and pretty healthy meal. I added some kale and swiss chard (since I had some to use up) and it added to the heartiness of the stew. I think some beans would be a nice addition as well.

I REALLY wanted to like the wafers. I mean, I doubled the recipe as suggested and everything. But, ended up thinking they weren't worth the trouble. I made the stew as written, with the exception of the green pepper, and it was excellent, and even better the next day.

The corn wafers are not to be missed. I cut the chilling time to two hours for my first batch (doubled the recipe), and they were savory, crisp, and delectable. A perfect garnish and almost necessary addition. The stew: excellent. I added a bit of cream, and matched the basil with cilantro. The preparation was easy; the results perfect.

Skipped the corn wafers as they sounded weird, and I don't even like cornbread. In their place, I put tiny cubes of new potatoes into the soup to boil. I made this exactly as-is, except I used cilantro instead of basil at the end and also garnished with some shredded cheddar. I think the quality of your chilli powder makes a difference here--I used real ancho chilli powder, not a blend, and found the stew's flavor full and delicious. Easy to make ahead of time for a fast dinner.

I was disappointed in this recipe. It was pretty bland, and adding spices din't help. The wafers were good, but took much longer to bake than the 5 minutes, plus the yield was so small-- only 12. There are much better chicken stew recipes out there.

I did not find tgis dish all that impressive. It had good flavors but I still found it to be pretty bland and was continuously adding spices to it to liven it up. You may want to consider shredding the chicken breast rather than leaving it in bit size pieces. The wafers were just OK-corn bread would have been better.

This was so good and so easy, though I think I could have browned the roux a bit more. Also, my wafers weren't crisp at all -- were they supposed to be? Anyway, I highly recommend this stew, especially for winter.

Wow. I don't know that I've ever cooked anything more deliciously comforting. Definitely double the wafers, and be ready to cozy up to a second bowl after you've inhaled the first. It's wonderful.

Wow, this was good. I didn't make the wafers -- didn't have time -- but the stew stood on its own. If you like things spicy, add a little hot sauce.

Only one word is necessary -- fabulous.

I have made this a number of times and it is very, very good. Also, the stew can be frozen (without the scallions and basil) and gently re-heated.

Great recipe - easy with delicious results. Some changes that I liked - a litte more chili powder helps, also some cumin and then I added juice of one lime, also put in parsley as well as basil. Next time I'll try cilantro and basil. The wafers are great, double the recipe.

I'm giving this 4 forks (unusual for me) because of the corn wafers, which are unforgettable. I made this for a family reunion four years ago, and people still call and ask for the recipe. The corn wafers disappear as soon as you put them out. Try to save some to eat with the soup. I dare you.
