... also, the granola browns too much for my liking with these cooking times... I bake it for 10 minutes on each side. It's much nicer.

Incredible granola~ rave reviews every time. I think that it's best with maple syrup, and even better with 2/3 T vanilla extract, 1/3 T almond extract, and substantial dashes of cinnamon and allspice. Have fun!

I think the oven temp is too high and/or the cooking time is too long in this recipe as written. I plan to make this again, but will probably turn the temp down to 325 and stir every 5-10 minutes. If you like a sweet granola you'll want to double the honey!

375 is too hot in my oven. 325 works perfectly. I stir every 5 minutes or so for a total of 30 minutes. It ends up nicely toasted. Most recent batch: I doubled the vanilla, used coarsely chopped macadamia nuts and a 3:1 mixture of dried pineapple and flaked coconut. Because the nuts are salted and the fruits sweetened, I skipped the salt & reduced the honey by 50%. OMG delicious- tropical paradise!

I make this ALL the time. No nuts are added (allergies), and I up the granola to 4 cups. I use slightly less oil and honey as well. Fresh or dried fruit - I add those in when I eat it. LOVE THIS.

I make this granola with blueberry or other fruit flavored syrup to change it up occassionally. It has become a staple in our house.

We love this recipe! I use 2 tablespoons of flax seed, which gives it a nice nutty flavor, instead of the wheat germ.

It's not the absolute best granola I've ever had, but it's good, easy and cheap. Next time, I will add cinnamon and maybe some candied ginger. This time 'round, I used slivered almonds, chopped pecans, and dried dates and blueberries.

I love this recipe! I took one reviewers advice and added 1 Tablesoon of cinnamon. I toasted the nuts (slivered almonds and pecan pieces - half and half - ) and added them after the granola baked, along with the cranberries. I used salted butter and pure maple syrup. I combined all the dry ingredients together in bowl, then all the wet ingredients in a large measuring cup. Added wet to dry and placed on baking sheet. Baked at 300 degrees, tossing every 10 mins for about 25- 30 mins. YUM! Thanks for sharing this one.

I love this recipe. It is a house staple. I bake it on a cookie sheet and after the first 12 min. it is done. We like soft chewy granola, I add pumpkin seeds, sunflower seed, the almonds suggested, cranberries and raisins. I just use the oil because I think it must be healthier than using butter, although I'm sure the butter takes this delicious granola over the top. I even make a batch to take on vacation because my husband can't live without it!

This is the easiest, most delicious granola. I make it every 2 weeks. I suggest adding dried blueberries, pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds!

I don't know what happened, but this didn't turn out very well for me. It makes a not too sweet granola, which is fine. If I make it again, I would certainly turn the oven down to 350 and I would watch it very closely. She burnt.

Yum, yum and more yum. I was making up things to put this on. I was dreaming about what to put this on. Yum. Now for the bar version...

Fantastic recipe. We double it because we have it nearly everyday; with milk, yogurt, ice cream or by itself. We use maple syrup and combiation of any nuts that we have on hand. We an the dried fruit as we eat it so that the granola will stay fresh longer.

This is so easy and very yummy! My kids love it, too. I don't usually keep wheat germ on hand so I used flax instead and it worked perfectly... I also use either straight maple or a combination of maple and agave. We opted to leave out the nuts and fruit, but it makes a healthy snack none the less.

The health food store stopped carrying my favorite granola, so I decided to try making some, and this recipe looked healthy and easy. I used olive oil and left out the salt. Because my old favorite had whole almonds, dried blueberries and raisins thats what I used. I also added one tablespoon of cinnamon because I have big canister, and it makes the house smell so good when the granola is baking. First time I overcooked it during the second bake, so after 15 minutes, now I turn the oven down to 325 degrees, so the wheat germ doesnt get too dark and toasty.

Criminy-- I'm in LOVE. My second batch is baking at this minute and I had, had, HAD to leave the kitchen because I keep eating from the first. Oh, yes, I switched the oil to butter and made it my own with coconut (sweetened) and some nuts that already had salt so decreased that. Now my husband is eating from the first pan which is supposed to go to my kid's teachers. Must go protect.

Easy to make, and tastes every bit as good as store bought. The recipe does not really say it, but I cooked it a big bowl, it would be much easier on a cookie sheet.

This is my new favorite granola recipe. I have made it with oil and butter and I found the butter version to be tastier. Salt helps round out the flavor and I add my fruit just before I eat it to keep the granola crispy. I think it is the vanilla that makes this recipe so delicious.

Perfect granola. I used golden and regular raisins and cranberries for fruit; pecans, almond slices, cashews and coconut flakes for nuts. I baked it on a cookie sheet/jelly roll pan and let it get very brown. Great over greek yogurt. Easy, simple and delicious.

At first bite this recipe seemed just ok, but after the second day it was addicting!! I left out the nuts (allergies), and like raisins for the dried fruit. The first time I baked it in a 9x13 glass pan and it came out chewy. The second time I put in on a baking sheet and it was crunchy (obviously it had more space to spread out on). Will be making again

This was so easy! I always wanted to make granola but never got to it until this recipe. I used maple syrup, mixed hazelnuts, walnuts, and pecans for nuts and raisins, cranberries, goji berries, and mixed dried cherries and berries for the dried fruits. My kids kept wanting to "taste" when I took it out of the oven. I made a mistake and added the fruits after the first 15 min of baking but it still turned out good. Don't know about shelf life though...

Okay so i know your supposed to follow the recipe to rate but like others i can't leave well enough alone. I changed the proportions a little and only add the fruit before eating since it will keep two weeks with out the fruit but starts to get soft earlier with. I used half butter half oil for flavor. I also added salt, and used brown sugar sprinkled on the top right before baking.

I would give this 3.5. I thought the sweetness of this was perfect-- I'm used to sweeter granola recipes that are incredibly hard on the teeth. This also cooks a lot faster than other granola recipes I've tried. I would definitely add sunflower or pumpkin seeds the next time I try this. I used honey, the nuts I used were almonds, pecans and peanuts and the fruit I used were cranberries (1c), cherries, and dried pineapple. Overall, very good.

I have toyed with making granola several times. Each time, I would look at the recipe, hem & haw about it & then put it off. I even once bought the raw wheat germ needed by so many recipes. Did you know that it expires about 2 years after you buy it? That means I carted the last wheat germ around for at least 4 years. Its probably been to three different states! Anyway, I was flipping though the latest Gourmet issues & the you asked for it section grabbed my eye. There it was! A recipe for granola that didnt seem like a complete chore! I found the ingredient list to be minimal & very easy to dig up in my pantry. Of course, I did need to purchase some fresh wheat germ. I used the maple syrup instead of the honey, threw in some hazelnuts instead of pecans and for the dried fruit, used apples, bananas & cranberries as my mix. This actually turned out quite well  loved the nutty flavor & the sweetness the maple syrup brought. I highly recommend this granola recipe for all cooking levels - I now have a new breakfast food!

This is a super easy, perfectly balanced granola recipe. I will definitely make it again.
