For an aioli, it was VERY runny so I suggest following the directions to blend the yolk and oil first, then add the other ingredients. The flavor is nice, very subtle. I served it with mini crab cakes for New Year' Eve - was a great match.

I've done it both with mayonnaise as well as from scratch. The advise with the mayo is to use a good and thick brand and let it rest overnight. The one I did with the egg-yolk was a little thin, so I took the adivse of the heavy cream and it worked. In any case saffron does need time to release its flavor, so I would reccommend to let rest overnight either way you make it. It is great to serve with white fish (or salmon) in "papillote" (in a aluminum-foil-sealed-envelope with veggies and white wine) over the grill.

Great flavour. Made this with cedar plank salmon for a very rich dinner. A white fish would be lighter. Great colour and flavour.

My husband and I adore the flavour of this! The first time I made it it split, so I added some heavy cream (my boss is a head chef - his advice) and we used it as a sauce for pasta. Another tip from my boss - almost anything made with saffron is better the next day as it gives the flavour time to develop. Certainly true in this case. This is the first dish I've given 4 forks and I use this site regularly.

I loved this sauce - subtle but delicious. Mine was a little runny,I would recommend beating the egg yolk with the oil first, then once it's thick add the orange and lemon juice. Great on poached fish!

Ack! Don't try making this with store-bought mayo. It didn't do justice to the subtleties of saffron and orange.

This is quite good and is certainly easy to make. I have served it with salmon, asparagus, and boiled potatoes. It makes a fairly large amount.
