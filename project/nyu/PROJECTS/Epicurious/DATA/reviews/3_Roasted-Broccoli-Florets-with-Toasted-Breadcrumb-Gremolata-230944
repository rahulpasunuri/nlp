Wonderfully easy and delicious. The roasted flavor with the simplicity of the shallot and the lemon juice was wonderful. I did not have any lemon peel, but the lemon juice sprinkling was still great. Also, I used baby broccoli and cut down the roasting time to 15 min. It was a nice side to poached salmon.

This dish was really tasty and easy to prepare. I love roasted cauliflower and it was nice to be able to roast a different kind of vegetable and have it turn out equally delicious.

A refreshing new way to enjoy broccoli. Loved the fresh lemon taste with the bitter broccoli. Breadcrumbs were a nice contrast.

I left on the stems of the broccoli, threw in some 1" chunks of carrots and zucchini, some cherry tomatoes cut in half. I sliced a butternut squash across in 1" pieces and quartered them. Everything was lightly coated with the oil and salt, popped into the oven for 22 minutes. Delicious!! It all barely made it to the table. And so colorful!!

I really missed having garlic in the gremolata - just didn't seem right without it. I also didn't care for the roasted broccoli.

I am soooo tired of steamed broccoli! I loved roasting it; the texture is different and wonderful, and it has a more nutty flavor, This dish is so easy for company; I can make the gremolata ahead; roast during other menu prep, and voila...an impressive, delicious dish! This is a new "staple" dish for me!

Of all the roasted veggies I've had, broccoli has never been one of them! This was so easy to prepare and so delicious, I forgot to sprinkle on the gremolata when I put it in the serving dish. Excellent anyway!

I liked the idea of roasting the broccoli, but was disappointed in the outcome - both visual and taste. Pretty lacklustre.

I changed this recipe a bit. I have a son with an allergy to wheat and dairy. So, I used cornflake crumbs instead of bread crumbs which made for great gremolata! I made sure there was plenty of lemon juice to drizzle on the steamed broccoli.The kids prefer steamed broccoli to roasted. The result was fantastic and loved by all.

I never thought to roast broccoli, it was delicious. My husband & I are adding it to our vegetable repetoire.

Roasting the broccoli dried it out. If I made this again I'd just use the breadcrumb topping on steamed brocc.

YUM! Lemon flavors really added an awakening zing the broccoli needed. Quick way to add a side veggie.
