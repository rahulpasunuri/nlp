I didn't listen to the bad reviews and I should have. It was inedible. It broke (separated) which ruined it. I will throw it out and try the Martha Stewart recipe.

UGH!what a waste of ingredients this was. sure, the flavor is okay...if you close your eyes and disregard the texture all together. i made no substitutions (in the filling), and all i ended up with was a curdled, greasy (!) mess. i don't know what happened, but the filling is like scrambled eggs and water. gross. what a disappointment!

Wonderful! I was worried when some reviews said the pie was to eggy so I made some minor changes to avoid that result. I reduced the whole milk to 11/2 cups and replaced the 1/2 cup with coconut milk, I also added 1/4 tsp more of vanilla. The result was superb. This is the best coconut custard pie I have had in years. If you have never been a fan give this recipe a try it is worth it!

Really, really overly 'eggy.' My husband took two bites, said he had already had scrambled eggs for breakfast, and we threw the entire pie in the garbage.

Made this for coconut custard pie lovers. Got rave reviews. I also made the best-ever pie crust recipe & found it easy & tasty.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was hit. I used the best-ever pie crust recipe instead of the one given. I used a 10" pie dish and had way too much filling. Next time will plan to make an additional small pie with the remaining filling.

I'm not sure what happened with this recipe. I followed it exactly, and first of all, it yields way too much for one pie crust. Second, the taste was ok but the consistency was so dense, not like a custard at all. I would not make it again.

I don't bake much, but this is a testament to epicurious.com and it's impact on my cooking. My wife refuses to buy CC pies at the supermarket, I am now the prefered source of desert. I personally liked the denser consistancy, and I upped the coconut a bit. We thought the topping was overkill, and used Pilsbury pie crust, sacrilege, I know, but it makes for a easy, yummy experience.

This is a fantastic pie. It disappeared within minutes! I used the "Best-Ever Pie Crust" instead - it's much simpler and it was great. One caution, though. Don't prick the crust with a fork after baking it with the weights as the recipe says - this will leave holes in the crust and cause the filling to leak out, causing a soggy crust. Just bake with weights, then without for about 9 minutes more before filling the shell.

I have made this pie many times and everyone requests it! The only negative comment I would have is that the crust is too involved and not as good as it should be for how time consuming its. By the 3rd time i made it, I substituted with a much easier pie crust recipe and it is just as good. Like the others say - the custard is a very 'eggy' consistency, but that is what makes it so delicious. It's an excellent contrast with the whipped cream/toasted coconut topping. Couple of suggestions: It is too much for one 10" pie so sometimes I make two 9" instead - it works. Also, I find that the vanilla extract is completely unneccessary in the whipped topping - just a little sugar will do.

Every time I have made this pie I get raves and requests for the recipe.

I liked this recipe but I agree about it being too eggy. I also think the texture of the filling is not creamy enough. I suppose I prefer the traditional coconut 'cream' pie which uses only yolks and more cream (and yet I do typically like custard).

My parents are coconut custard connoiseurs and they went nuts for this recipe. They both agreed, pie crust is not needed. All you need is the filling in a pretty dish with a dollop of fresh whipped cream and some toasted coconut on top. Superb.

I really didn't have a favorite pie recipe until I tried this. It's good, fast and easy. Coconut has been my favorite food since I was a little kid, but meringue is too sticky. This pie is very sweet, so be prepared! It's a perfect accompaniament to a strong cup of coffee. I will make this many more times in the future!

Easy, with good texture. The taste was a little too heavy on the eggs for my family, and we all enjoy custards. If I could figure out a way to make the egg flavor less over-powering, I would make this again.

The recipe actually made two pies for a dinner party - one barely made it to the party.
