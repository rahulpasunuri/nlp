Wish I had some insight as to why this recipe turns out great for some and a soggy mush for others. Mine fell into the latter category, with the apricots approaching a liquefied state, even with slightly less caramel as some reviewers suggested. I'm thinking there might be a better Epicurious recipe for fresh apricots...

Pretty and tasty dessert. Super easy to make and impressive. The only problem is that one tart didn't make nearly enough. Next time I'll make two!

The tart is beautiful to look at (and the effect is not hard to achieve), though as other cooks have mentioned the volume of sauce completely overwhelms the tart. Also, though the flavor was nice, I found it far too sweet, and the caramel masked the lovely fruit essence of the apricots. I might try this with half as much of a plain burnt-sugar caramel (no butter or cream) in the base of the skillet next time.

I make the deserts at our house, but my wife found and made this one first. She nailed it the first time and it was beautiful as well as delicious. I made it for a dinner club exhibition. It was the first time I had made it and it was in front of about 15 people. I made two of them and you should have heard the ooh's and aah's when I fliped that pan over. This one is very simple, forgiving, and delicious.

The flavour was great but as others had commented was way too runny and a soggy mess once flipped. Maybe we need to talk to the original chef to find out what we are all doing wrong.

This is a real tarte Tatin. Not runny at all if you let the caramel set for a while. The pastry is crunchy yet softened by the juices. No need to be perfect with trimming the pastry sheet as it is put over the upside down fruit, this makes a bit of extra crust at the edges. A delicious tarte I will always make when apricots or plums are in season.

There is something wrong with this recipe. It is one big soggy mess. I used firm fresh apricots and I got apricot puree swimming in apricot nectar.

An excellent recipe and a great cap to an all-French menu! Alas, at this time of year, there were no fresh apricots in sight, but the canned ones held up just great and the guests raved. One thought - the French version of this dish is a little "literal," don't you think? I went with a more recognizable name (though admittedly a cheat): "Tarte Tatin aux Abricots."

Wow! I absolutely loved this recipe. The fresh apricot flavor just bursts in your mouth! I have made this dessert a few times now and never tire of it. I could eat the whole thing myself, which I have done, since my husband doesn't care for it. The puff pastry is perfect, as is. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

I have made this dish several times, once with apricots and 4-5 times with canned or fresh peaches (I prefer peaches). Like others, the topping is runny so flip it over the sink and be careful becaue it is hot. I will try someones's suggestion that I pop it back into the oven for a few minutes. It makes a geat presentation and is delicious, especially with vanilla ice cream. It does not keep well because the puff pastry crust does get soggy but, man, it is a killer dessert! my e-mail is mikeck9262@aol.com

Scrumptious!!! What a success it was tonight. I didn't use a puff pastry because most of you complained about the dough being a bit soggy. Instead I made a "pate sucree" (1 and 1/4 cup of flour, 7 tbsp of butter, salt, zest of lemon, 2 tbsp of sugar, 1 egg yolk). I prepared the tart in the morning and baked it in the evening (400 degrees for 40 mn). Perfect as a do-ahead dessert.

Delicious and the only recipe I have ever made that looked exactly like the picture in the magazine

Used half the caramel thanks to other reviewers. I had fresh apricots and was leary but used 3/4 cup sugar and was glad. The tart is very French and not too sweet at all. It looked beautiful but runny when I flipped it over, but I popped it back in the oven for 5 minutes (already flipped) and when it cooled it thickened up a little bit. When I tasted it - yummy and my husband wished there was more runny part to lick off the plate.

Absolutely fabulous and so easy to make! I added peaches and cherries which worked wonderfully.

This tart is delicious, beautiful, and very French! I used fresh apricots and half the suggested amount of caramel sauce. The apricots are naturally sweet and juicy, so not a lot of caramel is needed. Because of this, I avoided some of the problems mentioned in the other reviews. My French boyfriend enjoyed this tart so much that I made it twice in a week!

I followed directions to the letter, and the result was so so. The caramel was extremely runny, and the pastry was very soggy. I would not recommend making this dish, but if you are going to try, be very careful turning it over. I was doing it over the sink, and still got burnt with some of the liquid from the pan.

My friend and I made this dessert together, and I don't think the sugar was dissolved and carmalized correctly. This may have caused it to be very runny, and the pastry puff gooey. It still looked good, and it tasted allright, but it was a little too sweet.

I thought this was great; I agree that the puff pastry was a bit chewy. Not the way I usually enjoy it, but for some reason I did in this one. Delicious taste! To the cook from Lewes, DE: Why in the world did you rate this 4 forks if you thought it was so bad???? Do you know what the forks mean?

I used fresh apricots. The flavor of the carmelized apricots was heavenly but there was so much juice at the finish - the puff pastry ended up "chewy" and soaked w/ juice. Might be worth trying w/ a classic "tarte tatin" crust.

This is an excellent recipe because the end result looks so impressive. It is important to have a dish with a good sized side to flip the tart into. Getting the crust on and tucking it over the apricots was the trickiest part for me. I used canned apricots which were delicious.
