Good. The aioli recipe doesn't list salt & pepper, though, and the batter was a little thick, so I added more beer. Also, to make it easier to eat (& slice initially), it might be better to cut the celery root in half lengthwise before slicing into 1/4"-thick half moons.

I personally prefer my celeriac roasted, which gives it a milder flavour; but if you like celeriac, you should try this recipe. The aioli compliments the celery root beautifully and is also excellent for fish (I brushed some on top of some salmon fillets the next day and they got rave reviews).
