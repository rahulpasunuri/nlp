I make this every year and it is fantastic. light and airy. Seasonal. it is a great way to use up left over mincemeat. I get requests for it every Christmas. off to make it again tonight!

Keep it as is and filled a spare ready made pie crust I had left over. Really easy and so good. also combined some super easy refrigerated rum butter sauce from a recipe I found on Epicurious.com. Is there no end to the bounty we love to share? What a fine database it is.
