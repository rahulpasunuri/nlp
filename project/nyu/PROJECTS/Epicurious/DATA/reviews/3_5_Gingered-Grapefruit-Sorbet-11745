This was very easy to make, and a great dessert for adults! Just a small serving is satisfying because of the strong flavor. I cut back on the sugar by 1/4 cup and it was still nice and sweet. The bitterness definitely still comes through, probably helped along by adding bitters. The heat of the ginger lingers, which makes eating the cold sorbet even more interesting.

Palate cleanser: ..."First, though, it should be noted that when a wine taster talks about his palate, he doesn't mean exactly the same thing as a doctor does: In winespeak, the "palate" isn't just the physical roof of your mouth but your entire tasting apparatus...your sense of taste, as distinguished from your sense of smell. But why should it need to be "cleansed"? This comes up most often in the context of wine judging at formal competitions, or people in the wine business tasting samples to decide what to buy. In such cases - or even when you're tasting wine analytically for your own pleasure or hobby interest - you want to be able to judge each wine separately, without having the flavor of the previous wine lingering in your mouth - er, "palate" - when you go on to the next sample." http://www.guamdiner.com/library/wine/winearticles/ART187.html

Delicious as a plate cleanser between courses. I stir the mixture several times while it is freezing therefore it never hardens solid. I put it in the sorbet dishes early in the day, return to freezer then serve directly from freezer. Saves time.

I served this as a between course palate cleanser to "non-foodies". It was not too sweet and had a very interesting complext taste. The response was that it was "weird" but very good and that the unusual taste grows on you. I found that making it in my cuisinart ice cream maker wasn't enough to make for a smooth sorbet after refreezing. When I pulled it out of the freezer it was hard as a rock. I ran it through my cuisinart food processor with the metal blade and that gave a perfect consistency. I suspect it would work perfectly by making the sorbet, freezing it and running it through a food processor just before serving. Just skip the whole ice cream maker step.

Very nice recipe. The heat of the ginger is a nice "surprise" vs. the coolness and sweetness of the sorbet. Great as is for dessert with sugar or other plain cookies. Would be a great palate cleanser with less sugar. JK New York

This is very refreshing, especially if you are a big ginger fan, as I am. Clears the palette wonderfully after a heavy meal.
