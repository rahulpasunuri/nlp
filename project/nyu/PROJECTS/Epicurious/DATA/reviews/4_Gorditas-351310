Awesome kid food. I did make mine in a regular muffin tin. I did not use the butter and cheese called for...simply omitted. They turned out perfect. Chopped some leftover pork up in the food process. and mixed with some refried black beans a little smoked paprika, salt and pepper.Great. Served with some leftover mexican crema.Great.Tomatoes, finely chopped gr. pepper, grated cheese on top. Let everyone assemble at the table. Great!

Gorditas, Sopes, whatever you want to call them - these were great. I didn't use the muffin tin, but followed other reviewers advice and shaped them on a greased cookie sheet and it worked well. Topped them with beans, chili, guacamole and cheese. Very easy, very yummy.

My family enjoyed this and it has made it to my make it again list. The only reason I gave it 3 forks is that the corn cups were still "raw" after 25 minutes in my oven. I ended up putting them on a baking sheet and cooking them some more. I doubled the recipe and my family of 5 ate them all.

Great Meal, have made it numerous times, the shells can also be made with maseca (the mix you use to make tortillas, found in the ethnic food aisle) and it's just as wonderful!

These were quite tasty, but I'm not entirely sure they worked out as described. Getting the corn mixture to form pockets/indentations just didn't happen very well. The flavour and texture were great, and much to my surprise, mine really did look like the picture! That said, I'm not sure that it was worth the work, when I already had corn tortillas on hand. I would suggest patting it into disc shapes on a cookie sheet and baking, it might be easier. The serving size also seemed skewed--I had enough for 12 muffin cups, not 6 (which is fine if a serving is 2 cups). All in all, I'm not likely to make them again.

This are not gorditas, they are sopes. Gorditas are filled with one ingredient like pork, or smashed potatoes or beans when raw and then cooked, then you open them and put only salsa on them. I know i am mexican. This would be Sopes.

These were good, but not what we were expecting. They are not like gorditas you get in a Mexican restaurant. They are more like corn muffin cups.

I loved the taste of these homemade gorditas - one of my favs at Mexican restaurants. My husband knew we were having gorditas, but I guess he assumed we were using something pre-bought. He got really excited when he realized it was from scratch. Please note, this amount in NO WAY feeds 6 people ... unless they are all 2-year-olds. I would say it feeds between 3-4 depending on appetites. Next time, I would forget the muffin cups (I've always seen gorditas as flat with pocket slit in them for the filling). I think you would have a better ratio of ingredients to filling if you flattened these like pancakes and cooked them. I'm definitely making these again eventually and will try them that way!

Yummy and cute, kids loved them. I used cheddar as that's what I had. Filled with black beans, homemade salsa and guacamole, with roasted sweet potato cubes on the side. The same recipe would be good as a top to a tamale pie.
