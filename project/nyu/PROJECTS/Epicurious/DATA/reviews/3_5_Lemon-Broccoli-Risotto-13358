I made the S recipe as indicated except that I only had beef stock and so used half stock half water. It took a LONG time for the rice to cook and the flavor once done was nothing spectacular. I can't imagine it was a stock issue. I would not make this recipe again.

Very good recipe and doesn't take too long as it usually does with risotto. I did double the lemon juice quantity to bring broccoli to life a bit more and used Pecorino Romano instead of Parmesan. It was a hit among guest who do not eat rice, nor broccoli, so it must have been really good!

I ended up just using florets and not the stems. I got a bit confused and added the garlic to the broth, instead of sauteing them with the onions. Turned out fine and there wasn't that bitterness you get with the garlic. I added the toasted slivered almonds at the end. It was a hit! There were NO leftovers.

This recipe I found to be very easy to follow, and the taste was just smokin! Use all fresh ingredients, no shortcuts and you will love this.

furthermore for a cheats easy risotto I use a cast iron pot with lid, add the stock in bulk lots, cover and cook over a very low heat, stirring occassionly.

This was a perfect use for the broccoli that needed urgent harvesting in the garden and home-made chicken stock cluttering the freezer. I also used extra lemon juice, preserved lemon and lemon infused avocado oil to add to the flavour. In addition I added wine at the start and toasted slivered almonds at the end. The almonds were a great addition.

I used leftover, plain old boiled broccoli for this. Never would have thought to add lemon juice and zest to risotto, and I really liked it. Good recipe; will make again.

Yum! For my broth, I made my own vegetable stock with onions, garlic, salt, and the peelings of the broccoli stalk, then I added some dry white wine and lemon juice. I used only the broccoli stalks in the risotto and did something else entirely with the florets. I served this with swordfish, and it was just delightful.

The amount of stirring required was not worth the relatively bland meal produced. Next time I'd add more of everything tasty- garlic, cheese, lemon, broccoli and maybe also some capers & other veggie tid bits - so in other words, make a totally differently risotto to this recipe!

Good recipe. Added some white wine at the beginning and a pinch of saffron halfway to add flavour and colour. Served it with chicken with capers and parsley.

Quite delicious and simple. I added chopped parsley when stirring in the reserved broccoli florets at the end. It was a good complement to the dish.

Three forks for taste to difficulty to originalty ratio :-) Exactly my type - unusual setting of flavours and not so many ingredients. I have listened to the "more lemon" idea. Add the juice at the very end of preparation until You feel the dish tangy enough. My own idea is to season risotto with white pepper. Works well! I will definitely do it again. maybe with white wine as somebody suggested.

Next time I will use more lemon but this was a great way to use the broccoli I had in the house in a different way.

I loved this recipe although I didn't follow it exactly- for those of you who don't have time or the correct skill, you might try my shortcut (i know this isn't a 'real' review- more of a suggestion) i used steamed jasmine rice (added broccoli at end while warming for seven minutes) and mixed with the sauce indgredients (minus broth and water) in large pan. it was wonderful and very easy when you're time crunched.

This was very simple and very tasty. Might add a little more lemon juice next time. I recommend grating the parmesan prior to starting the cooking. A little mise en place is helpful here. Will definately make again.

My partner and I inherited Mom's old clipped recipes from Gourmet magazine, and this one is FANTASTIC! If you have the time for a Risotto, this is definately one that is worth the time. We have this paired with grilled chicken, A+!!

I enjoyed this. It nicely livened up roasted chicken for a side dish. I doubled the amount of lemon juice to give it even more lemon flavor. Risotto takes patience and isn't that quick, but this one was worth the effort.

This was quite tasty. Just needs a little more lemon juice than called for, otherwise works pretty well "out-of-the-box."

This was good- the lemon was subtle, the proportions of rice to liquid turned out nicely. I made half a recipe for 2 of us, and we had some left over.

Pretty bland and mushy with too much onion flavor. Maybe I cooked it too long or didn't add enough lemon, I don't know .... but I probably won't make it again.

This was the first time I have made risotto, and even though I have heard it is somewhat labor intensive, I had no idea it would take quite SO long to prepare. It was a tasty dish, very creamy with a light lemon bite. I too served it with the Chicken Picatta recipe on this site and it was a great pairing. Delicious, but for the work and attention involved, I won't make it again.

I'm a novice cook and this was much easier than I thought it would be. I served it with the Chicken Picatta from this site and it was an awesome meal! My boyfriend loved it too and had plenty leftover for his roommates to eat after.

I love lemon so I just use whatever juice and zest one lemon yields (which is more than indicated). Based on other reviews, I upped the chicken broth to 5 cups and replaced the water with 1 cup of white wine. Although the recipe is easy, it does require your full attention for the 20 minutes where you continuously adding broth and stirring. It definitely serves more than 2!

I just made this for dinner, and my 7 y.o. even liked it! I only used the broccoli floretts (I don't like the stems), but otherwise made no changes. Very simple and quick!

One of the best things about this dish is how pretty it looks once all the broccoli florets are mixed in. It also tastes great!

Outstanding result-- the lemon flavor was subtle but important to the overall taste. I thought the proportion of broccoli to rice was right on. I'll definitely make this again. A rather time consuming process, but well worth it if looking for a "jazzed up" side dish.

I enjoyed this dish, but I think it would be far better with asparagus than broccoli. I used arborio rice. I added about 1/2 cup white wine to the rice before adding the broth (veggie broth instead of chicken broth). I also increased the amount of lemon (as suggested by other reviewers) and used the zest and juice of 1 whole lemon.

I made this last night and really enjoyed it. I've actually eaten some for lunch today as well. It might be better the second day. I added a lot more lemon than the recipe called for, probably 5 tablespoons. It had a nice tang. I also added 2 tablespoons of minced fresh parsley. I used arborio rice without a problem. I did use one extra cup of chicken broth. My husband thinks this is a great way to eat brocoli. I will make this again when I see some in the fridge getting a little old.

I'm not going to rate this recipe, just wanted to share a change I made. Although the recipe sounded nice as written, I combined it with the shrimp risotto recipe, also from this site. The resulting lemon risotto with broccoli and shrimp was wonderful. And although combining parmesan and shellfish is taboo in Italian cooking, do it anyway. It really adds to the dish. Enjoy!

I was shocked to see how low the ratings were for this dish. We loved it! I zested up the flavor by adding lots more lemon, and kept adding lemon, liberally, until the dish had some tang to it. Incredible flavor. A new favorite in our house. Never again will a head of broccoli go bad in our fridge.

Like it alot, but not enough for 3 forks. A solid recipe, but nothing "special". I agree with Dallas reviewer, this easily serves 4, not 2. Used aborio with success here, but I view risotto as a labor of love dish which should result in a truly special taste.

Rating: 3
This is very good (3/4 fork rating). I made this with small cubes of eggplant instead of brocolli (that was what I had on hand) and it was wonderful. The little bit of lemon really added a nice zest!

It made a lot of food and was quite tasty; however, it wasn't the most impressive risotto recipe I have ever made. That said, I would still make it again simply because I often have all the ingredients on hand and it was fairly easy.

Not exactly dinner party material, but an interesting mid-week choice. One issue with the ingredients list - if you're gonna make risotto, use arborio rice, for heaven's sake!! I don't agree at all with using just any old rice! If you have to choose between this and tuna casserole on Wed. night, choose this.

My husband and I are risotto addicts always on the lookout for new recipes. We felt that, while the lemon complemented the broccoli in this recipe, the flavors in this dish simply did not meld together well.

This is a fantastic, one-dish vegetarian meal if you substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth. My husband immediately consumed three heaping bowls.

I thought this was a tasty risotto, and I happened to have all the ingredients on hand! My husband and I both enjoyed it very much, although, I agree it made a ton and it needed salt and pepper. We had it as a side dish. I thought the lemon taste was just right, not too much and not too little. I also added some vermouth before adding the broth, and 2 tbsn. of butter, before adding the parmesan to finish it. I'll make this again, probably this winter.

I really liked this risotto; I loved the surpising lemon taste. I did not need to add any salt or pepper but made sure I had a good Parmesan cheese. I also made it with vegetable broth instead of chicken broth as I think chicken broth might overwhelm the lemon taste.

The taste of this dish is surprising (from the lemon).

It turned out well. Broccoli broke up a bit when stirred in, releasing much broccoli flavor into the succulent rice. I have no idea how this recipe could only serve 2!!! My friend and I ate 'til we were stuffed, and still had copious amounts for lunch the next day.

I agree with a previous comment: this is a little bland. But it's a nice way to serve your broccoli. Use all chicken broth instead of adding water and add a good shot of white wine before you add broth to the rice. Don't forget to add a little (real) butter in the end.

I often add bite size pieces of chicken breast that i quickly grill or saute first. There is another similar recipe Lemon Risotto in the October 1996 issue of Gourmet from CIA Greystone. I was unable to find it on this site.

I've made this recipe numerous times and it always is delicious. It's a great way to use available ingredients and I always seem to have most of them on hand. I've substituted other items (mushrooms for the broccoli, brown short grained rice for the arborio) and it comes out great.
