You can multiply this for more servings. I used 2/3 of a square pan of leftover cornbread, and quadrupled the other ingredients. It took about 30 minutes at 350, in a glass pie plate. With ice cream, it was plenty for 6 people. We served it after Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone loved it.

Indian pudding doesn't thrill me like a spectacular chocolate dessert would, but sometimes, hot and with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top it's wonderfully comforting. Yet who wants to spend all day supervising a steamed pudding. This bread pudding, which takes about five minutes to assemble, was a wonderful substitute, virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. So speedy and convenient! I doubled the recipe for myself and my husband, and used half and half and some leftover supermarket corn muffins that I had on hand. We both thought it could have used a bit more ginger, and I'd use the extra molasses next time to punch it up a bit (but you want to consider the boundaries between tasting like Indian pudding or tasting like gingerbread). I will definitely make this again when I have an urge for Indian pudding. Oh-- be aware that molasses sinks in milk and sticks to the bottom of the mixing bowl, so be sure to scrape with a rubber spatula from time to time to be sure you incorporate all of the molasses with your whisking.
