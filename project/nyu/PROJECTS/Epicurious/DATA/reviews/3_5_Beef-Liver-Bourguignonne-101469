Rich, delicious beef liver preparation. I cut the liver into thin strips, because I just like it that way. I also skip the croutons, instead adding the garlic to the onions and bacon, and serve with rice.

A wonderful preparation for those of us who aren't quite sure how much we like calves' liver. Very festive for such basic ingredients.

Don't know what I was expecting...perhaps a thicker sauce. Just didn't do much for us.
