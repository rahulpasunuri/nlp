I have made this several times. The pistachio salsa is fantastic-but do cut the oil in half. I make double because we eat it on everything..it's good on fish, etc. My guests always want the recipe. I will make it with the corn manchego salad this weekend as suggested.

Everything turned out great except for the corn and peppers which was my own fault. I used too much chiles, so it was a bit too hot for me. I'll definitely make this recipe again and next time I'll be a bit more careful about how much chiles I add.

This was an exquisite roast chicken--the marinade yielded a lovely and savory end result, the chicken crisp and moist and very flavorful--one of the better roast chickens, I think. The pistachio salsa is not for the faint of heart--a very interesting accompaniment for a rather adventurous palate. I highly recommend it--I did follow the advice of previous reviewers and cut the olive oil in 1/2 on the salsa, cannot imagine it having more oil than that. I did not make the corn and pepper salad, not being a bell pepper fan--if I were doing this for guests or a special dinner, I think I would accompany it with the corn, manchego and lime salad elsewhere on this website--a lovely dish and more to our tastes. Do try this one, at least once!

I made this using chicken breasts and thighs. The marinade was wonderful, grilling left the chicken moist and tasty. Where this recipe starts to go awry is in the sides. The pistachio salsa was good, though the recipe stated one cup of olive oil, that's surely wrong. We used 2 - 3 TBSP, more would have found pistachios floating in oil. It was interesting but didn't really enhance the chicken. The peppers and corn also were good but not great. The capers seemed like an off note and I love capers. We kept thinking something was missing but weren't sure quite what. None of the sides, while each was okay on it's own, really complimented the chicken or each other. I'd make the chicken again but not the sides.

Loved this! I made a few adaptations for the pepper/corn dish, eliminating the chilies and used "mini" yellow/orange/red peppers. Also used 1/2 the oil in the salsa. Large recipe for the 2 of us, but looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow!

The pistachio salsa was knock your socks off delicious! It would be great on a variety of things. The peppers and corn tasted very fresh but might not be a crowd pleaser in that it was vinegary and had a little heat. The chicken was chicken and needed the salsa to make it great.

Soooooo disappointed. Nothing really seemed to go together. The corn and peppers were not good at all. This meal put my husband in an awful mood. He was starving and excited to try the dish. All he did was complain how tasteless it was. I'm sorry I worked so hard :o(

Made 1/2 recipe (one chicken), full recipe of corn and peppers and 1/4 recipe of salsa using salted-in-the-shell pistachios. Suggest using slightly less oil in the salsa. The marinade is excellent and the left-overs are good from the refrigerator because I cook for one (me!). I will make this for guests.
