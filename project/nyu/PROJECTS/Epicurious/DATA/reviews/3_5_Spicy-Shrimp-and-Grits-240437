I used polenta sauted with cheddar cheese because that 's what I had on hand. Also substituted red pepper flakes for pepper sauce and left out the mushrooms. Garnished with bacon. THis was a fabulous dish that can become a weekly favorite or a company dish.

Very good recipe. I didn't have green pepper on hand so I used asparagus and it was excellent.

The amount of grits called for in this recipe is way too much for 4 servings! I also thought the finished dish was bland.

Really good!! This one's a keeper. I made it with the bacon left in the sauce. It was very good.

Absolutly Delicious! They don't say so, but chop the bacon and sprinkle it over the entre before eating. The creamy grits were so good, that I decided against the cheese. I bet some cumin would be good with this also. Even if you make no changes, this ones a winner!

This recipe is really great considering the ease and speediness of its preparation. There are better shrimp and grits recipes but they take more time. This is a good weeknight dinner, especially when you can get the shrimp pre-deveined and shelled

Fantastic! Made it for a dinner party & it was a huge hit. Based on other reviews, I subbed in Asiago for half the cheddar, and vegetable broth for 2 cups of the water. Next time, I'll probably add more. We skipped the bacon, but added a chopped chipotle pepper for extra kick with great results. I also sauteed the shrimp separately before adding to the tomato/onion mix to crisp them up a bit. I'll make this again!

The evaporated milk trick is genius. After spending my college years in Chapel Hill, I've been making shrimp and grits for years, but this grits recipe is great. I'll definitely use the evaporated milk whenever I make grits in the future. I would always add green onions on top of the final product, though. Overall, a good recipe.

for the vegetarians, we substituted olive oil and liquid smoke to taste for the bacon. also substituted blue cheese for the the cheese suggested: fabulous!

Good recipe although no mention of the bacon when assembling the dish. I used too much hotsauce and kicked it up a notch!

The grits were really creamy and tasty but the shrimp were just not good. I'm not sure why - a even sauteed the onion with some garlic before adding the other vegetables. Maybe the crimini didn't belong there, don't know...

Terrific. Not difficult and feels like good comfort food.

We really enjoyed. Not sure what bacon was for. I crumbled and put on top.

The grits were great, but I thought the shrimp were pretty boring.

This was a nice alternative to grit recipes that call for a lot of cream and butter. Very nice taste and texture.

This dish was great! No changes to the recipe this time. The grits were rich and creamy and were ready in about 30min. I will definitely put this recipe in the 'guest' folder!

Yum!!! I don't usually cook southern style, but that might change after this recipe. I added more cheese after tasting the grits during cooking and added some more hot sauce at the table to the shrimp. My husband loved it! A nice change of pace meal.
