The instructions are easy and the fries are crispy and wonderful - worth the calories as a treat. Love a previous reviewers idea of making paper cones and serving them upright in a glas - fun! When it comes to Truffle oil, a word of caution: if you've never had Truffle oil, try the scent and taste first to see if it's for you. It's a strong scent and taste and definitely not for everyone!

Excellent. It is paired with beef tenderloin, so it is meant for a more of a caloric blowout of a meal! I agree with the previous post about presenting in a fun way. I like to make cones out of parchment paper and fill them with fries, place in a glass to keep them vertical, and watch my guests act like little kids! If you are like me, you are lookinbg for ways to add truffle oil without overdoing it. This accomplishes it! (Side note: I have made oven fries by roasting potatoes in olive oil, salt, pepper, and herbs de provence in a 400 degree oven for about 45 minutes, then toss them with truffle oil at the end...it is fast, easy, and not as delicious but close!)

Yes they are good. Because of the truffle oil. But deep frying as well as all those calories make this a once a year treat! Last time I made mashed potatoes I added a tablespoon of truffle oil and the results were magic.

This is a very popular dish right now! My husband and I love it, even though it is caloric...moderation!

A bit of a process. Be sure to check the temperature, and have the potatoes cut evenly. Beyond that, they are dynamite for a special dinner. Do try to present them in some fun way, such as out of a little bag, or some clever little individul glass.
