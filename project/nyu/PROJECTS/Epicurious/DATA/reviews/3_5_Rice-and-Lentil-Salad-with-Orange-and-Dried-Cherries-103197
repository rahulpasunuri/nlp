Note added to my review below, use 2/3 cup chopped pitted tart cherries, (more). As well, make your rice according to package directions.

I like this recipe better with the changes I made below. FOr the cherries use Trader Joe's dried pitted montmorency cherries. Instead of the parsely use a large handful of fresh spinach, chopped roughly. Also a delicious rice to use also from Trader Joe's is the "Brown Rice Medley"- so healthy and good! I have also made it with simple white rice and it was delicious as well, but less healthy :-) Also my lentils were just plain brown-what I had on hand. I will try the french green in the future. This is a staple salad in our house now--YUM!

Delicious! A bit more time consuming than the recipe suggests but well worth the effort.

This was just delicious. Followed the recipe, except I used 3 oranges (thought my kids would like more oranges), sliced and quartered.

Great, easy dish. As mentioned in previous reviews, balsamic vinegar works wonderfully with this recipe. I didn't have any shallots, so I added some sauteed green onions. I used dried cranberries and a wild/brown rice blend. I'll definitely repeat this recipe - I kept dipping into the bowl as I was making it. Tasty and healthy - good texture and flavor all the way around.

I thought this was great, and I'd definitely make again. The rice cooking method is unusual, but it yielded a slightly chewy texture that complemented the soft lentils nicely. The flavors were really nice together, too.

Made this for a potluck and it was very well received. I'd made it the night before, and it was very good the next evening -- the flavors came together well. I did have a few substitutions: I used dried cranberries instead of cherries and balsamic vinegar rather than red wine, as per previous suggestions. I also used brown rice in place of white, and I squeezed a little extra lemon juice over the salad because I felt it was a bit lacking in zing. It's not haute cuisine, but it is very tasty and easy -- a great potluck dish that I'll probably make again soon.

Tasty. I make variations of this dish frequently. I usually substitute dried cranberries for cherries (I can rarely find dried cherries) and add 2-3 extra oranges. I also sometimes substitute balsamic for red wine vinegar, and serve the salad with balsamic-marinated grilled chicken. I usually make rice according to the normal package directions - I found the method here doesn't change the taste or texture of the rice, but does leave a saucepan that is impossible to clean. Also, I often find lentils take a bit longer to cook than that, so I start those first.

I didn't this that this was all that wonderful. To me it seemed to need something more.

I really liked this recipe. I've never made a rice salad before and was a little weary of eating cold rice, however, it didn't bother me at all. I did end up using about 1/2 the olive oil and squeezing the extra juice from the orange into the salad. Overall, a great and healthy lunch salad for me.

I am certain this basic recipe shows good results. However, I always see a recipe as a journey, never a destination. I did not add orange, maybe that would have helped, certainly not hindered. I did add garlic into the shallots. Golden raisins and dried cranberries (coated with garam masala) and sun-dried tomatoes all found their way in. I used a good balsamic vinegar and complemented it with a splash of tamari. Excellent product, will bear up under repetition.

I made this recipe 9 months ago and was unimpressed by it. Because of the other favorable reviews I made it again today. Again I found it to be mediocre. To each her own (taste).

This is really wonderful! A great alternative to pasta salad, this makes a fine vegetarian main dish or an exotic side dish. The mix of fruit works really well with the lentils. Best of all, these are ingredients I always have in my pantry, so I can make this salad whenever I want.

This was a great find to accompany chicken and mushroom crepes. I used dried cranberries and currants and skipped the lentils. It was easy, very colorful and full of flavor.

I added more citrus and doubled this recipe. The juice of one lime "punched" it up a bit. Yummy!

This recipe is proof that reviews by other readers are very helpful. If not for positive reviews, I would never have tried this because I didn't think it sounded good. It's wonderful. I love the tender and also chewy texture of this salad. It also leds itself to substituting other dried fruits such as raisins, prune bits, etc.

This is a delicious, hearty and healthy salad. I brought it to a potluck lunch and everyone commented on how great it was. I, like other reviewers, substituted brown lentils and a combo of dried cherries and golden raisins-- it turned out great!

I substitued the cherries for raisins and didn'nt have quite enough fresh parseley, but we loved it. Easy to prepare and very tasty.

A great salad that has gotten rave reviews every time I've made it. A definite keeper!

Very light and tasty. Even the confirmed lentil haters in my family enjoyed this one. I was making do with what I had on hand, and substituted dried apricots for the dried cherries, and mandarin oranges for the orange. (I did manage to get my hands on an orange peel at the last minute, and the zest definitely gave the recipe a needed zing.)

This was an excellent dish. I didn't have green lentils, so I substituted the regular brown ones instead. I added a few bits of pineapple which I had left over, and it tasted delicious.

Nicely different lentil salad. I really like the dried cherries, which add an interesting tanginess to the salad. I'll certainly do it again, especially for a pot-luck meal.

This was easy to make, and tasted very special. The citrus gives it a very fresh feel which balances nicely with the earthy lentils. I used currants and in place of an orange, I used a tangello. I'm sure that any similar citrus would give the same results. Excellent recipe!
