I think this should probably be illegal... it's just TOO easy and TOO good to be true. Made the recipe exactly as given and served it with a light Italian vegetable soup. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect.

I have made this several times as a first course and it always wins for taste and presentation. One time one of my guests surprised me and brought a food critic as her guest. It was rewarding to hear him ooh and mmmmm over this dish. Served with braised lamb shanks with rosemary from this site as a main course -- so didn't need to make another vegetable. Just added mashed potatoes and a salad for an easy make-ahead dinner.

Perfect combination of flavors. If you have difficulty obtaining Italian Fontina, I have had success substituting a combination of Edam and Parmesean. We have this on New Year's Eve with champagne. Ahhhh!

Excellent - very easy to make and the fonduta holds well for reheating. I also roasted the asparagus and proscuitto. I served this as a side dish to a beef roast. Will definitely make it again.

Outstanding! I too wrapped the prosciutto around the asparagus and roasted (great tip). They were devoured!

I made this for our supper club and it is PHENOMINAL!! Like a prior reviewer, I roasted the asparagus wrapped in the prociutto. Luckily we had extra bread and fonduta sauce for dipping. The biggest issue was the fight to get to the cheese bowl.

Really completely delicious. So many nice layers of flavors. We were tempted to eat seconds of this dish and ditch the main course! I made it exactly as written and would not change a thing. My fonduta got a bit thick by the end, but I whisked in more milk and it was perfect.

this is one of the better appetizers to start off a nice dinner party and its not all that time consuming. i cooked the asparagus underneath the cheese to save time

This is pure heaven! Made it for our main dish for dinner accompanied by a Caesar salad. We savored every bite. The combination of flavors is a perfect harmony. Will be marking this one as a favorite!

This is, as others have reported, excpetional. I made the fonduta exactly as indicated, but doubled it without a problem. Mine, too was a bit thin, but I let it cool, then brought it back up to temperature at serving time on the double boiler, and it was perfect. I prefer my asparagus roasted, so I wrapped the proscuitto around the middle of 4 spears in flat bundles, drizzled with olive oil, and roasted in a 450 oven for about 10 minutes. Served on the crostini with the fonduta, and it received RAVE reviews. Could have served as the main course with a salad easily, and everyone would've been happy.

Utterly fantastic! Beautiful presentation, outstanding flavours, and the sauce is to die for as others have reported. I rarely rate any recipe with 4 forks, but this one certainly deserves it as this dish is truly beyond compare! Enjoy!

Almost this exact recipe is served at an upsacal Scottsdale, AZ restauarant called North. A picture of this appetizer appeared on the cover of Phoenix Magazine after North won best new restaurant...it is a to die for appetizer or light entree! You must try it... If time crunched, can skip the sauce and just put a room temp slice of fontina cheese under the asparagu.

My God. I didn't make the crostini, but the key part is the sauce, not the bread. Usually, after making a sauce, I stand over it adding things for more flavour. This was perfect. After the asparagus drizzled with this sauce, it was hard not to go back and eat the rest of the cheese sauce out of the pan. Hmmmm.. maybe I will.

I had this at my Gourmet Club this weekend. Visually stunning and absolutely delicious. I am going to make this recipe for my family very soon!

this recipe is not only to-die-for, but also a beautiful presentation for dinner parties...I decided to roast the asparagus in the oven after marinating it with balsamic vinegar/olive oil + herbs de provence...gave the asparagus a mellow nutty flavor...I also was able to assemble the toasted bread and proscuitto beforehand (warm before adding asparagus and fonduta) making the recipe even more of a breeze

The cheese sauce never thickened, but that didn't detract from the dish at all. Just wonderful.
