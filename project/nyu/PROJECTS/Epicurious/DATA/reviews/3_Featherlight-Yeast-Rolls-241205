The best bread I have ever eaten!

Like any fresh bread, these were good, and light and fluffy, but generally lacking flavor. I used salted butter hoping that would counteract the blandness other reviewers mentioned, but it wasn't enough. They needed probably another 1/4 of salt.

Made these as directed. I set them outside overnight well-covered since it was chilly and there was no room in the fridge - plus, it's fun to torture the raccoons! I let the rolls rise for a few hours the next day, and they baked up fine. The texture was good - moist, relatively light. But they were desperately lacking flavor. Needs salt!! If I made them again, I'd definitely add more salt to the dough and possibly sprinkle a little kosher on top after they're buttered. Try Blue Ribbon Overnight Rolls from another site for a recipe that's easier and tastier.

I have made this receipe many, many times and each time the results are wonderful! My husband loves them--he's into them even before I can get them from the oven to the countertop to cool. They have become a fixture with our monthly "dining in" gang.

While perusing the reviews for this recipe, I noticed that the majority of the individuals who had difficulties with the rolls are located in northern states. The problem may lie with the choice of flour brand they used. Southern flour brands are made from soft varieties of wheat and are blended to have a lower gluten content. These flours will produce a lighter, fluffier roll. Water hardness and chlorine content will also adversely affect the dough. Thanks for providing this delicious recipe! Miss Lewis is stilled sorely missed!

I must have done something wrong... everything was fine until the final rise and when I put the melted butter on, the rolls completely deflated and they came out as flat disks rather than fluffy rolls. The flavor was ok, but I will definitely have to try again.

Not worth the effort.

Made these for Thanksgiving yesterday and followed the recipe exactly except that I added a bit more salt than called for. DELICIOUS! They were extremely light and soft (I think I may have slightly underbaked them) with a delicate potato flavor. Will definitely make again.

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. The rolls are - fine. I like the recipe overall, but they weren't feathery light or even some of the best dinner rolls I've had. The rolls were just rolls and they were fine, but took a lot of effort for what they are.

Given that these take a full day to prepare, I was expecting absolute nirvana rolls and I got...rolls. When I tried them I thought: "Pillsbury!" For the amount of time these take I don't think it's worth the time or effort. I'll shop at my bakery or buy the blasphemous instant-bake instead.

I can't wait to try these, I love potato based bread! the reason for letting the dough rise in the refrigerator over night is to allow the flavour to develop as the yeast slowly digests the flour. you could skip that step and just let them proof on the counter for an hour, but they wont taste the same. just don't let the dough rise at room temperature before putting it in the fridge, or the yeast will lose it's strength

Good grief! Don't throw failed rolls or bread in the garbage--throw it in the Cuisinart and freeze it for much better than store bought stuffing or bread crumbs.

These are very light and have a great texture, they just lack in flavor for me. If you are looking for white bread rolls these are a great choice.

Perfect! I just wolfed down 4 of these, slathered with butter, right out of the oven. These are light, fluffy, delicious and worth every second that it takes to make them. I will never use another recipe again.

I made this recipe exactly and they came out wonderful!! I read the other reviews and I think people are having too moist of a dough because they misread. It says to reserve 1 cup of potato water, but only use 1/2 cup. The other half is if the yeast doesn't bubble and you have to start again.

I am not sure the technical reason for the chilling of the dough, but a lot of recipes I have use this method. I think it has to do with the dough not becoming overextended, which might be why your dough rose and then fell. Next time just refrigerate the whole time.

I was confused by chilling the dough while it raised. I let it raise a few hours on the counter before putting it in refridgerator for the night. In the morning it was not as raised as it was before. I followed the rest of the recipe as directed, but the rolls did not raise as they should have. The result was a not so fluffy rolls that ended up in the garbage. Any suggestions?

My first attempt at making these rolls was an absolute failure, but I think that was the fault of the yeast I used. The second batch (the edible batch) was delicious; light and airy, with great flavor. I would make them again.

I can see that I will have to try this one again. The dough batter is presently rising for the second time, if that gives you an idea of my experience with this recipe. It was so moist, I didn't even attempt to make it into rolls. I will try cooking it, but I'm not optimistic. So- o-o, next time, I'll be using MORE FLOUR. Sigh.

These were delicious - light, airy, wonderful flavor. I did have just a couple of lumps of potato in my finished rolls, so I made a note to mash them better next time. :) Definitely a keeper! (Also, note that I ended up keeping mine in the fridge for over 19 hours before proceeding with the recipe - worked fine!)

The name is perfect for these for these tasty rolls. They have a lovely texture & are even good cold. Such an easy recipe! I was delighted to be able to put the dough together the night before & finish them the next evening for hot, fresh bread. I got rave reviews from all the dinner guests! On a technical note, I used rapid rise yeast mixed in with the flour & it worked great. Also put the potato through a ricer, it was a snap & produced a light, fluffy mashed potato that mixed easily with the rest of the ingredients. Definitely a keeper!

Oops. I copied this recipe down from my mom's magazine and I mistakenly added a full cup of potato water. I tried to pull my review but can't figure out how. Apologies for the error. I'm putting 4 forks here to cancel my 2 forks out. :-)

I had the same trouble as the reviewer from Pittsburgh. I think there is much too much liquid in the recipe. I added nearly a cup of flour and it was still way too wet. But I went against my instincts and made them anyway, and they collapsed when I put melted butter on before baking, didn't rise much during, and were pretty awful. I don't know if there's a mistake or what, but I make bread in my bread machine with 3 cups of flour and less than a cup of water. This is 2 2/3 cups of flour and a cup and a half of liquid? Plus whatever water is in the potatoes. If I made them again I'd skip adding the potato water, or just add it bit by bit.

Not worth the time or the effort to make. Poor texture, poor taste.

Wonderful recipe. The only change I would make is to add a little more salt, otherwise, they turned out perfectly. To the reviewer who commented about the potato being lumpy, make sure that you boil your potato until really tender, almost falling apart when you fork it. I then added the butter and milk to the drained potato, and almost pureed it to a smooth consistency. Worked great. I also added additional flour during the kneading process, between 1/3 and 2/3 of a cup. These were really light, and tasted great! Enjoy

I made these and added 1/2 c. whole wheat flour. This made them not as "fluffy", but they were still light. Good flavor. I let them rise about 1/2 hr. after I shaped them, then froze half the batch for later use. Last night I pulled 5 of them out,put in oven and they were great. Not as good as 'fresh', but wonderful to have some fresh bread so quick.

These rolls did not look like anything in the magazine and they did not melt in your mouth.They did not brown well. They completely collapsed when I tried to put melted butter on them after rising the second time and were not worth the time or effort. I would not make them again.

These rolls were very light. However, I will be more careful when mashing the potato and make sure there are no large bits of potato. Take time to thoroughly mash them and you won't find hard lumps of potato in your rolls. The flavor was excellent!
