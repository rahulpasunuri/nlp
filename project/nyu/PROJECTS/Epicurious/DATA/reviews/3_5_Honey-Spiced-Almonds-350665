We cut the salt (sea salt) down by a quarter and it was still too salty!! Next time I might leave it out all together. Otherwise I think this would be good.

I thought this would have a good balance of flavours, with a sweet/salt/spice dynamic that would be interesting. No such luck. It was extremely salty and the spice over-powered the honey. Please try something else. In my opinion, this recipe is dreadful.

Made this for the first time last night to take to a party. It was easy. Having read the reviews I made a few adjustments. First, I mistakenly bought almonds with husks and used them. They were fine. I made a single batch so I cut all ingredients in half BUT the honey. I used slightly less than one t. of cumin and smoked paprika and slightly more than 1 t. of cinnamon. I ground sea salt and added a t. of brown sugar once added to the baking sheet and spread the mixture in the pan to dry. Omitted the sesame seeds. After drying, I put them on a parchment lined baking sheet to cool and tossed them occasionaly to separate. I paired them on a platter with blue cheese stuffed medool dates and dried apricots. They were a hit! Will make again. Perfect for cocktails.

Made these for a party and everyone raved about them...me too. Used only 1 tsp salt, as one reviewer had mentioned how salty 2 T was. Maybe it was supposed to have read 2 tsp.

I would recommend using less paprika, cumin, and cayenne. I think it overpowered the honey and sesame flavor.

Don't think I'll make this again. The honey dries the almonds into a solid sheet. Also this is waaaaay too much salt. Try leaving it out entirely.

I made these for a new year's eve party and let everyone taste them the night before. They were voted to go into the trash. the spice was over powering and might have been good over chicken, but a complete mismatch for almonds.

Very easy -- and sweet with a strong spicy kick after. These would make a good party gift to bring when attending a get together.
