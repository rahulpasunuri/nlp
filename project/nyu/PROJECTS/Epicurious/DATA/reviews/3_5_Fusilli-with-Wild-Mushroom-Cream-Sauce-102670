I live in Dallas and have ordered this many times. I'm delighted to have the recipe! I've made it and of course it is a perfect ringer for the real thing. Love this site.

Just what I was looking for! I had 4 big portobellos and some egg papardelle, so that's what I used. I added fresh thyme from my balcony and completely omitted the parmesean cheese to save on some calories and fat. I did add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Came out GREAT!! I will definitely be making this again and experimenting with different mushrooms and herbs.

My tweaks: brought beef stock to a boil with bay leaf and thyme, then let it steep. After a few minutes, strained through a coffee filter then soaked the dried mushrooms in the seasoned stock. Restrained and used the seasoned stock with half and half later in the recipe. This recipe does not make enough sauce! I used a cup of stock and a cup of half and half and still had to add more! And that was for a 12oz box of bowtie pasta, not a pound. Also added a few diced shallots with the garlic. Very nice flavor, hubby loved it!

Was very disappointed. Taste was okay, but the cheese clumped up and the mushrooms were very very chewy. Won't make again.

!uite delicious, made as written except for extra garlic. If boil down the sauce it gets thicker, I didn't need cornstarch.

We made this per the recipe. I have tried other pasta with mushroom recipes and this was by far the best. great deep flavor. It's easy to make if you do the mushroom mixture the day ahead and would make a great side dish with beef/Chicken or pork. We had it as a main dish. It reheats ok (but only as left overs for yourself and not anyone else.) :-)

Good lower fat sauce. Added fried panchetta to sauce to enhance flaor. Also substituted beef stock with mushroom soaking liquid. Best with fresh pasta.

Well I cannot give it more than two forks since I used it as a base recipe and took the advice of previous reviewers and did also my own thing: soaked the shiitake in beef broth, more garlic minced, fried some diced serrano ham first, then added the mushrooms and garlic, bay leaves, thyme, parsley and some isle de crête spice mix, then, flambé with fine brandy (no marsala at hand), let it simmer... fleur de sel, pepper ... liquefy whipping cream with castille walnuts, add with only a third of the beef stock left from the soaking... mix and simmer ... parmesan left for after serving on a bead of pasta and seared fine steak and some truffle oil to garnish... End result: looooved it just loved it! My husband asked for second helpings and took leftovers for lunch next day... Will def do again... with modifications of course ... hope it helps!!

Wow, this was very bad. There was no body to the sauce at all. I expected a creamy sauce due to the title and the addition of cream and cheese but instead had a runny mess that didn't even coat the pasta. We ended up not finishing our plates and tossing the rest of the pot. A definite disappointment.

delicious, doubled the garlic, used half beef stock and half soaking liquid as others suggested. Also had a NY strip steak about to go bad so i seared that and sliced it over top. Delicious if you like overkill meals like i do...

This is amazing! I used some strange mushroom from the local "fungus fair" instead of the criminis, and it was out-of-this-world.

A bit too rich, without being very compelling. Just a creamy mushroom sauce.

Rating: 2
Seemed somewhat one dimensional. I enjoyed more the things I added at the suggestion of others. Parsley, walnuts, pancetta. Should have added more of these. Used the soaking liquid rather than beef broth. That might have been a mistake. Note suggestions by others re making more sauce. Not much sauce as is.

This dish is absolutely delicious! There's a local restaraunt that makes a creamy mushroom pasta that is out of this world, and we've been trying very hard to recreate it with little success, until I found this recipe! Like others, I doubled the amount of garlic suggested, I also added chopped walnuts (like our favorite restaruant does) which were excellent and added nice texture to the dish. My boyfriend gobbled it up and then bragged to all his coworkers about how his girlfriend cooks him gourmet dinners! When I make this again, I will probably add a touch more cream.

Just wonderful!! You can vary different ingredients with this recipe. I had chopped shallots so I added them with extra garlic while cooking the mushrooms, along with coarse salt and fresh pepper. I used fresh shitake mushrooms instead of portobello-yummy. I made extra sauce using 1/2 C cream, 1 C stock and 1/2 C of mushroom soaking liquid (had used much less water to soak) which added a dark smokey taste. Try using a little less parmesan and taste....add more if needed. Forgot the bay leaf- didn't miss it! This dish is company worthy.

My husband, who loves mushroom pasta sauces, loved this dish (I didn't). He recommends increasing the amount of garlic, adding 2 tablespoons finely chopped pancetta to the initial mushroom saute, and adding 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme and 1 teaspoon tomato paste with the stock and cream.

This is one gooooooood sauce. Made just one small change. Used some of the porcine water with a bit of brovil instead of the broth, result excellent.Ah yes.... added 1 teaspoon truffle oil at the end

Excellent dish. Using broth made from porcini powder seemed to add nice depth of flavor. For non-vegetarians, we added sliced poached chicken breasts, plus some extra cream. All enjoyed.

This was very good and very elegant for a vegetarian dinner entree. I added a slurry of 1T cornstarch with 3 T water at the end as the noodles were not coating well. I also used premium imported fusilli which may have made a difference. Leftovers were very tasty, too. I might drizzle a bit of truffle oil on top next time, but it was great without it. I did not give four forks because it was not very striking visually- a sprig of parsley made it look at little better. Who cares, though, because it was yummy.

Wonderful dish for mushroom lovers. Broth easily exchanged for vegetable. Additional steamed vegetables complement well...especially asparagus. Sprinkle with basil...and enjoy!

I have made this dish on many occasions and substitute vegetable broth when making it for vegetarians. I use a variety of mushrooms, whatever is at the store, a long with the reconstituted mushrooms. It's fairly simple and quite delicious.

I used frozen porcinis instead of dried, what a difference! Also used some dried cepes, fresh clamshell mushrooms and a bit of shitake. Added fresh thyme. Wonderful.

I made this dish for a dinner party of eight and it was the hit of the party. Substituted vegetable broth for a vegetarian friend and still absolutely delicious!

This dish was very bland. The finished product has a very unappealing look as well, I'm glad I didn't make it to serve to guests. Definitely lacking something. Don't waste your time and ingredients on this one.

Wonderful, however I made enough changes (using what we had on hand) that it was not the same recipe. Used rich veggie stock, white wine, fresh button and mushrooms instead of beef stock, marsala, and recommended 'rooms. Still, muy fab dish, we will make again. Good recipe to adapt to your tastes (and cupboard).

We loved this dish! I improvised somewhat - didn't have Marsala so I added the Vouvray that we were drinking, used 100% mushroom stock (strained through a coffee filter), added an extra clove of garlic, used 1/2 cup parmesan and 1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese. It melted very well and added a wonderful flavor. Very good - will def. make again with those modifications.

Made 2X. First VG -I too, used more spices and a lot less cheese @3TBL.Also used imported marsala and 1/2 lb.Parpadelle instead of fusilli.Not much sauce.2nd time: Not as good as firsttime.Needed more zip, so added some mushroom stock, and herb d'provence.More sauce this time but darker, not as tasty as first time. Maybe bad crop of mushrooms. I'll do again.

I followed the advice of many of the reviewers and it tasted delicious. I agree that more garlic is necessary. Also, I did half cup of beef stock and half of the mushroom stock (water soaked with porcini mushroom). Anxious to make it again.

This recipe is a winner. I did add a little more salt, pepper and lots more fresh garlic to the mushrooms. I garnished with lots of fresh parsley. It was a winner.

Found this dish very easy to make and quite tasty. I agree the extra garlic is needed and also liked the addition of some fresh parsley. Replaced the cream with "mock cream" made out of equal parts of low-fat cottage cheese and milk combined in the blender - worked perfectly. Looking forward to making this again & trying out some variations.

I absolutely adore mushrooms, so instead of using the beef stock, I saved one cup of the mushroom soaking liquid and added that instead of the beef stock. It had an even deeper, smokier taste. It's also more vegetarian-friendly (if that concerns you). Agree with other tips and I would suggest using fresh bay leaves instead of those flavorless dried ones.

I liked the mushroom flavor and the cream sauce, but I don't think I added enough salt and pepper, as the other reviewer suggested. My dish came out a little watery, too. Perhaps I didn't let enough of the water from the mushrooms evaporate. This dish was a bit on the bland side for my taste, so I would definitely use a little more garlic, and maybe some other herbs and spices, too.

Rating: 4
Excellent!!! This dish was not only easy to prepare but also wonderful in taste and texture. The key I believe is to season the mushroom mixture well with salt and pepper, I also added 2 extra cloves of garlic. Give it a try It is a light and satisfiying

made this dish and loved it--very simple to prepare and delicious! couldn't find the dried porcini and creminis, but came out just as well with basic white mushrooms. we're garlic lovers, so we kicked it up a notch with 2 extra cloves garlic. also delicious with 3 T. chopped parsley added to mushroom mixture. will definitely make this again!

How much portobello mushroom?
