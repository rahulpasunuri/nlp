I'm a horrible baker, but this recipe never fails me. It's not the greatest chocolate cake recipe ever, but it's a good easy recipe to make!

I'm a middle school teacher and I baked this recipe as cupcakes with 35 kids. The recipe was easy enough for 6th and 7th graders to follow, and tasted great! They turned out moist and my kids loved them. I will definitely be making these with other groups of kids again.

I made this recipe as cupcakes and they fell when they baked! Very disappointed.

This cake is a standby but not a standout. I used the batter for cupcakes and found that it yields about 25% more than promised. The recipe produces an airy cake with a fine crumb-- pretty classic. But just like those omnipresent chocolate cakes, it just doesn't taste that special, even with high quality ingredients. I guess this isn't all that unexpected given that it comes from a kids' cookbook with an emphasis on decorating. I'm also willing to admit that this is largely a matter of taste-- I generally prefer richer, more dense chocolate cakes and this just isn't one.

Great chocolate cake!!!! easy, quick, no fills, all American CHOCOLATE CAKE!!!! I live in Europe at the moment and was sooooo craving chocolate cake, nothing they have over here mesures up to real chocolate cake, this recipe saved me from months and months of cravings! Got so many compliments on it that now I'm not accepted at parties without this cake!!! The key is using good quality ingredients especially the cocoa powder, I add a bit more vanilla and don't worry if the butter-sugar mixture doesn't seem as creamy as you would expect (DO follow the repie instructions), when adding vanilla and eggs it does get to the expected consistancy. ENJOY!!!!
