PS: As others noted, sautéd onions add depth to this soup. Sauté the onions while chopping the other vegetables: a lot of extra flavor for little extra effort.

Try adding 32 oz EACH of chicken and beef broths for the liquid--instead of water. Season with freshly ground black pepper, Worcestershire and Sriracha sauces to taste. This variation adds only 100 calories per batch, and elevates the soup from sorry to spectacular!

I used a soup recipe that was very similar to this as a base for many great low cal soup versions after finding the recipe online. I believe it was called something like the" Amazing Soup Diet". Adding meats, pasta and other ingredients make this soup very versatile and delicious. My favorite version was to add some cooked turkey Italian sausage, a couple of tablespoons canned beans and or cooked pasta and basil to a large bowl's worth of the base soup in a saucepan and simmer it for a few minutes. ( This was for one serving.) I would top the soup with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and perhaps a drizzle of olive oil and black pepper. It made an easy start for a simple and really very good meal. My version also called for the addition of spinach and zucchini to the base. On this basis I highly recommend this recipe as it is very nice to come home to most of a lunch or dinner just ready to tweak into a great meal. On its own the soup is healthy and somewhat plain.

It would be easier to beat yourself with a stick than to go through the hassle of making this flavorless dump of a soup. Eating it is punishment and proof that "diet" food is disgusting. Why is this recipe even on epicurious? And if it's on here, why aren't their recipes about eating styrofoam covered with mayonnaise and cumin seeds? It would be just as apropos.

Instead of cooking veggies in water use chicken stock. I also substituted half of the tomato products with a jar of salsa for added flavour.

Following the other reviews I decided to cook 2 breasts of chicken in water with herbs making my own chicken broth and adding protein. I then added all the ingredients minus the green beans. I also added 2 tbs. of chili powder, 4 cloves of garlic and 1 serrano pepper chopped. Spicy and delicious.

I give cabbage soup 4 forks the way I made it, but after reading the other reviews that this soup was bland, I used the recipe more as inspiration than anything else :) I basically tossed in any extra veggies I had in the fridge... a head & a half of green cabbage, a few carrots, green & red peppers, celery stalks, 3 cans of diced tomatoes, some onion & garlic carmelized in olive oil. The trick to making it not bland seems to be that instead of using a water base, I used a white wine/miso base. Miso stock is really healthy and a splash of wine goes a long way :) I also squirted in some ketchup, which gave it the barest hint of salty/sweet without me adding any other salt or sugar. Then I dumped in loads of spices - paprika, basil, oregano, black pepper, garlic powder... :) This soup turned out amazing! But I'd recommend anyone looking to avoid the possibility of blandness to go with a white wine/miso base... YUM!

I enjoyed this soup - I mixed this recipe with the recipe on the cabbage soup diet website, and as suggested, added a dash of my own spices - a good quality chili powder give it a nice kick. I also sautéed up 2 leeks (chopped) with some garlic, 2 cups of water, a bay leaf and a few sprigs of rosemary and thyme. Once they were softened (removing the herb remains and bay leaf), I blended it all together and added it to the onions, green pepper, carrots, and celery I was sweating with some more garlic and herbs. I did not add the green beans as that seemed a bit too starchy for the intent of the soup. Regardless, it was pretty good - and worked well too!

The soup is a bit bland and I recommend spicing it up to your taste. I sauteed onion and garlic in a bit of a light cooking spray. That helped. As for any diet you go on, do some research first. A Cook From Canada seemed pretty outraged that the editors did not put a more expansive precursor for this recipe. But I think an idiot clause applies here. I don't see precursors on fatty, high calorie recipies. Go to the cabbage soup diet website and check it out for yourself....

I would suggest cutting the recipe in half the first time. The recipe as is makes a *huge* vat of not very good tasting soup. Perhaps I just didn't get the spices quite right, but I can hardly stomach the stuff.

Well, I went looking for recipes similar to what my "fat Dr." ordered and lo and behold, here it is (except for the beans part). Everybody loves the stuff around here, (but they won't have to eat it as long as I will). At any rate, when I'm slowly chewing my protein every other day, I will continue to enjoy this stuff 'till I get more recipes.... I think most of us on this website are safe from starvation and malnourishment! Come to think of it some of the recipes I found here are what helped send me to "Dr Imfat". Not because they are fattening, just because there are so many good ones!

This recipe is wonderful, especially in winter. I've done this diet twice now, and IT WORKS FOR ME. True, you can eat as much as you like as often as you like, but I treat myself to some quality protein every other day. Protein keeps you feeling more satisfied. So 4 oz of lean chicken or fish every other day doesn't add many calories, and I get some satisfaction for the carnivore in me!

I've made this recipe 3 times and even my family enjoys it on the first night. I spice it up with oregano leaves, cumin and coriander seeds, and cinnamon, which I cook in a little olive oil before adding the vegetables. I add chicken broth (extra) as it cooks. I also add some cinnamon which adds a nice sweetness. This may be a diet recipe, but it has lots of fiber and vitamin C (cabbage) and vitamin A (carrots). We think it tastes pretty good.

I found this soup to be hearty and delicious, thanks to a few modifications. Along with the ingredients as listed, I also added some chicken stock and about 1/4 cup of pre-made salsa.
