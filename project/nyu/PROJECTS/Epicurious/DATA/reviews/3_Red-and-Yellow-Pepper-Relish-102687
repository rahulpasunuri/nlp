Loved this recipe! I chopped the onion, skipped the olives, and simmered at very very low heat for about 1/2 hour, as I didn't have time to refrigerate overnight. It was excellent, and went very well with the tenderloin. I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe did not go at all with the "Herb and Garlic-Crusted Beef itTenderloin" recipe. They were recommended to go together. This might be nice as a type of salsa for fish tacos. I just wouldn't bother with it again!

My entire family (including kids) love this relish. I usually serve it over steamed asparagus - makes a nice accompaniment to "plain veggies."

Everyone loved the relish and it was a pretty dish. Last Christmas, I made Roast Prime Rib with Madeira Sauce and Horseradish Sauce (an Epicurious recipe). Since everyone raved about the Madeira sauce, I made it again this year to accompany the Tenderloin (just in case). The Tenderloin is an elegant piece of beef and the Madeira sauce does seem to be more fitting than this relish.

We must be odd also because we all loved it too. It's not at all ugly. I make it a few days ahead and take it from the refrigerator. The bright colors are a great contrast to the meat. Recomomend dicing the onion.

I made this for a dinner party and the men especially went nuts for it. Very tasty and easy.

We didn't find this relish to be entirely awful (hence, the "2" rating), but I wouldn't make it again. I agree with others that it looks terrible, and the taste was fair at best. Definitely NOT a worthy accompaniment to the beef tenderloin it's written to go with.

Definately better warm than room temp!Only takes 5 min to make, so I recommend it fresh

The relish is fabulous. I have made it a dozen times. It goes well with many things especially the tenderloin.

Tasted OK just out of the pan. Was not the best accompaniment for the beef tenderloin that I cooked. Had a lot left over that got thrown away. If I made it again I would leave out the mustard.

I have to agree with the last cook--there was something about the way it looked that was almost nauseating.

I made this relish to go with the beef tenderloin. The meat was wonderful, but I threw out the relish. I found it most unappetizing.

I made this as a relish for beef tenderloin and it was wonderful. It made quite a bit though so I used it for a topping for crostini and then used the leftovers the next day as an omlette filling. It is salty from the olives, though so don't add any more salt.
