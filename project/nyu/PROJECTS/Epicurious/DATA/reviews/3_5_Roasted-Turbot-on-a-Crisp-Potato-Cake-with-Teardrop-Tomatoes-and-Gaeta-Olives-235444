This was good. I sliced the potatoes by knife and maybe for that reason had to bake them for 30 minutes. But they came out crispy. I used whiting fillet for the fish.

This is now our favorite fish dinner. The balance of flavors, especially with the fresh thyme, is just about perfect. I used turbot fillets and shortened the fish cooking time to about 9 minutes. And a few less olives. Can't wait to have it again.

Just made this tonight. I added some onion, garlic and anchovives to the sauce which was then was good. We enjoyed the potatoes, however. I needed to cook them longer to crisp up, but we kept nibling at them long after the meal. An easy meal to make. Try it.

I made this last night and it was very good. My husband loved it. It didn't take too long and, other than the fish, the ingredients were all things I tend to have around. I used turbot fillets so that made the fish part easier. Next time I think I will brush them with olive oil before roasting. The potato cake tasted great. I used parchment paper on top of a single baking sheet. The potatoes stuck to the parchment when I tried to pick them up so it all ended up pretty freeform. Next time, I will follow directions and put the potatoes in two cake pans.
