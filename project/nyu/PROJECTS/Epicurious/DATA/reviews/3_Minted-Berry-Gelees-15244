This recipe is delicious, if made with local berries, and beautiful, and easy, and can be made in advance, so that after making it once exactly as written, I have made it several more times this summer, varying the fruits, and substituting lemon verbena for mint. Everyone has asked for the recipe. Outstanding! Lucille
