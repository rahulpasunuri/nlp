yes, it's 1/2 C of Mexican Crema...someone does need to edit this recipe. But result is yummy and we dipped our tamales into the sauce.

Who proof reads these recipes anyway??? Another error...1/2 cup or store-bought what? Further down under Techniques it mentions crema. Are we mind readers or what?
