I am a terrible crust maker - but this crust was delicious! And so easy to make. I didn't have any almond extract, but the crust tasted like almonds without it - and delicious texture. I pressed it into the bottom of a 9 inch cake tin and used it as a base for a ricotta cheesecake. I ran the ricotta through our Blendtec blender to make it ultrasmooth. Used lemon zest and grand marnier in the cheesecake. Delicious!

It is a very versatile crust. After I made the crust, I put it in the freezer for 30 min and it was ready to cook. I used it with a bachamel/ricotta spread topped with fruit and preserves, and even with all those flavors, you could still taste the almond!

I used this crust (doubled) for my cherry apricot pie...it was pie heaven! Yhe almond flavor was a perfect marriage with the cherries and apricot.
