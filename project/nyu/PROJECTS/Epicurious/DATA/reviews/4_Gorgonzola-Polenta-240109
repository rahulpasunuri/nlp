This is a great side. This recipe makes so much, I will halve the recipe next time. Also, the polenta cooks a lot faster than the time given so I did use extra broth. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee. The gorgonzola adds a nice distinctive flavor. Very good!

This is really nice. Just like everyone says, perfect for a cold fall night.

Made this just now, with a few alterations--I halved the recipe, since this is a trial run & being a girl of the south-I used grits----I'm serving it tonite with roasted chicken sausages & braised baby bokchoy. It tastes super yummy & creamy---I made it in a Le Creuset casserole, but I'm going to pour it into a baking dish & slide it into the oven for abit---love the sound of crispy leftovers on a griddle! This will be made again as a base for Shrimp & Grits!

DELICIOUS!!! I used english stilton instead of gorgonzola, also added grated parmasean cheese (however, i don't think the parmasean added anything) Made this with turkey meatloaf. Excellent alternative to mashed potatoes and it takes only five minutes!

My friends were scraping the pan to get every last bite of it!!!!

This polenta tasted fantastic. However, you don't need to cook polenta for anywhere near 10 minutes. The cheese makes the polenta a little thicker, so if you don't want it to congeal, add more chicken stock.

Delicious! Works every time. I use water instead of broth and it tastes great too. It is a perfect accompaniment to the Cabernet-braised short ribs.

Okay, this was good polenta. It just was a little too gorgonzola-y for my taste. I would lessen the cheese next time, but other than that a pretty good 'go to' recipe for polenta.

Absolutely awful

Awful. Gritty. Salty. Bad flavor.

I have made this dish several times and it always turns out perfect. I've both halved and doubled the recipe with perfect results. However, today I have a guest who is allergic to milk products and would like to substitute a good goat cheese or (non-dairy) feta. Has anyone tried this?

Haven't tried this, but wondered if anyone has tried it with grits instead of polenta.

Would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could. It's very good and pairs really well with the braised short ribs, just nothing particularly innovative about the recipe. FYI, polenta cooks up in about 1 minute - I have never found any that does otherwise so wait until the last minute to start this.

I really hate gorgonzola and all blue cheeses, does anyone know if a strong feta works? I hate to be like the Omaha person, but well, you know.

We really enjoyed this. I also let some of the leftover polenta set. I cooked it in my waffle iron until golden and crisp; topped with spinach and smoked salmon.

This is excellent! Served with the braised ribs sauce even better! Stored left overs as a log and sliced and fried in butter next day!

Yum! We doubled this recipe for a dinner party with no problem. A huge hit with the Beef short ribs.

I made this the weekend I rec'd my magazine....it looked so good on the cover. I served it with beef stew and it was delicious! Perfect comfort food for a cool fall Sunday night dinner.

I totally agree with you, cook from north east. These non- reviews drive me crazy. What idea does this give people who have not tried a particular recipe how it really is; four forks??? Insanity. This anonymous poem seems to pertain: I didn't have potatoes, so I substituted rice. Didn't have paprika, so I used another spice. I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used tomato paste. A whole can not a half can - I don't believe in waste. My friend gave me the recipe - she said you couldn't beat it. There must be something wrong with her, I couldn't even eat it.

Omaha, how could you "rate" and "review" this recipe? You didn't make this recipe--at all! Waste of space!

Excellent dish, though a mite strong for some. I love the reviews that say I substituted white rice and Velveeta and Bubba loved it.

I loved this recipe. Instead of cornmeal, I made the dish with white rice (not a big fan of polenta). I also substituted gorgonzola cheese with a mix of parmesean, swiss, and feta cheeses. This dish made an excellent side dish to marinated chicken.

Very good. A bit strong for me... A little goes a long way. Everyone at my dinner party loved it!
