The taste is great. The texture of the frosting is... interesting. You can see it in the photo. It's not entirely smooth, I assume because the butter and the mascarpone won't completely blend. Still, I would make it again.

This is a great new, brighter spin on carrot cake.

Just rating the frosting now..haven't served the cake yet. But really....only 3/4 c. confectioner's sugar in the frosting??? I had to add at least 3 cups...so I'm thinking maybe the recipe should read: 3 and 1/4 cups of conf. sugar... Once I got the right consistency...the frosting was good.

I made this cake following the recipe, except I did not use fresh spices or sunflower oil. Instead I used cabinet spices and vegetable oil. I grated about 2 1/2 cups of carrots. In making this cake again, I will only use about 1 to 1 1/2 cups of carrots. I felt the taste of carrot was too strong. I also used grated carrot in the frosting, so maybe I would omit some carrot in the cake. I felt the cake,aside from the strong carrot taste, had the right amount of spice. Next time I will try with fresh spices instead of McCormick's. The frosting was very tasty. I followed the recipe, but I refrigerated the frosting until it was a little more firm before frosting the cake. I added grated carrots and some lime zest for garnish. Thank you, my family and i enjoyed this recipe and plan on using it in the future.
