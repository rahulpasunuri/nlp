Just a bit dry so I macerated about half of the relish and mixed it with the remaining half. Just right. Served it on grilled ciabatta with goat cheese. Excellent.

I used this relish on Boboli pizza crusts and it was wonderful. First I drizzled olive oil on the crust, topped it with some tomato-basil relish, sprinkled with a small amount of mozzarella and parmesan. It was so easy and so yummy.

I can't believe that hardly anyone has rated this recipe. It is absolutely delicious! Honestly it is so easy I probably should have thought of it myself but I'm not that creative so I'm sure thankful it is provided here. I served it while still warm with toasted baguette slices. My husband and I ate the whole thing!

THIS IS A GREAT TOPPING FOR BRUSCHETTA, GRILLED SALMON OR CHICKEN. THE FLAVORS ARE LIVELY WITH THE COOKING OF THE INGREDIENTS IN THE OVEN. I WOULD DEFINATELY TRY THIS RECIPE AGAIN. DELICIOUS!
