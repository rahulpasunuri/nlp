Frozen and unthawed in this context do not mean the same. The reader is being instructed to you frozen berries,as oppposed to fresh, and use them in their unthawed state.Literacy anyone?

I'm just really glad that everyone is so OPEN about their flatulence. I too, had flatulence. I would rate it on a scale of 1-5 about a 5. But the flavor of the sundae was about a 4. I would make this again only outside.

Very good. While I thought the review where the writer stated that her husband had gas was a joke, my family had the same flatulatory problems. Thank god it was warm enough to open the windows in the house.

It was tasty, but my son threw up after he ate his. My husband had gas all night and I was sick as a dog too. I think the walnuts may have been bad. My sister was visiting from Cleveland and she was fine. Go figure. Next time I am serving Krispy Kreme Doughnuts for dessert - I am a bad cook!

Sundaes should be fattening. But they should also be generously topped with real, fresh, luscious whipped cream!

The sauces are great. I will make it again but not too often because I cannot leave my hands off of it.

My credo is never to eat anything that's not good for me unless it's very, very good. This dish is on that list, and I'll accept no substitutes.

I was astonished to see that only 50% would make this again, only to read that the 50% are two people who complain about calories! If you're watching calories, don't make this (and therefore, don't rate), or at least try a bite and really tell us about the recipe.

I agree that it is fattening, but sometimes you have to forget the calories and go for it. YUMMMM.

Good grief. How many calories must be in this recipe. Hardly worth the trouble!
