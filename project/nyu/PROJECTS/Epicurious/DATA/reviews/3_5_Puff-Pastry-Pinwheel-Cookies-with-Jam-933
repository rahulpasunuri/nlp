So easy! I came home from vacation and had a party to go to that day - but no ingredients in the house whatsoever. Found some puff pastry in my freezer and made these using lemon curd instead of jam. Rave reviews at our block party.

Made these over the holidays and after the initial batch, found they were very easy to prepare and impressive to look at; used preserves instead of jam so the fruit wouldn't run everywhere. Had to serve them within 2 days or they lost their crispiness though.

I bake and cook quite a bit and I did not find these "easy" at all. Tedious, yes, but not easy. For all the work the flavor was not worth it. If you do try this, keep a small dish of water nearby when forming the pinwheels. I found that the corners wouldn't stick to the center sometimes but by dabbing a finger in water and then pressing the corner to the center it forms the pinwheel just fine. I also would not recommend halving the size to yield more cookies. Depending how fast you work, it might also be a good idea to keep a damp towel covering the part of the pasty you are not working on so it doens't dry out.

These were just so-so and I had trouble peeling off my dough from the floured surface after forming all the pinwheels. Served these along with homemade truffles at Christmas Eve and they got left on the plate.

Well these couldn't be easier! I made the salmon and rice wrapped in pastry from this site and had pastry left over. I remembered seeing this recipe and decided to make these little gems to use up the remaining pastry. They were very easy, quick, and tasty.

These flew right off the plate. I used high-quality, all-butter puff pastry from a local source, and it made all the difference. In a recipe where the main taste is the pastry, it absolutely pays to use the very best you can get.

This recipe is a keeper. I made them a bit smaller (2 1/4 in. squares) for a Christmas cookie assortment, and they were the first to disappear from the tray.

An amazing little cookie and so easy to make! I used homemade blackberry jam and served them with Grahams 6 Grapes Port at a wine tasting. Try a sprinkling of cinnamon for something different. You can also use red or green colored sugar to sprinkle on cranberry jelly for Christmas, then top off with a bit of powdered sugar.

This is to cook from Warrenton, Va. or anyone who would have the information. Where does one find the coarse sugar? I haven't been able to find it in any grocery store or cook's catalogs. I have tried crushing sugar cubes but it's not quite the same. A source for the coarse sugar would be appreciated.

We used honey glaze rather than egg glaze and liked the added sweetness and texture. Would serve it at a party.

oh so very quick and impressive. I mixed ground almonds with coarse sugar and sprinkled on the egg wash. After baking I immediately drizzled a glaze of almond/orange extract and powdered sugar and milk. Then quickly added lemon zest to decorate. Very beautiful and very yummy

Oh my! So simple and yet so pretty. These cookies present themselves beautifully. I had many people thinking I had put a lot more effort into them than I had. A very impressive and tasty cookie. Great with coffee and teas.
