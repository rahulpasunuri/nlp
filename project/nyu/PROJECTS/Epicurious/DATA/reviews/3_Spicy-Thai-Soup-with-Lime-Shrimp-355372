I haven't tried this yet (but it sounds divine) I wanted to volunteer that frying the curry paste in a little oil first REALLY brings out the flavor of the paste.

Not bad, but it needs a little more something - and I did try a little extra curry and cilantro, but that wasn't it. I have another sweet potato soup recipe that calls for the addition of a small amount of tomato sauce, and I may try that next time. I didn't have shrimp, so I marinated sea scallops in the lime juice and cilantro instead. Then I pan seared them, put them in the bottom of each bowl, and poured the soup over. That worked, but I wish I had been more excited by the soup itself.

This is darn good soup. It took very little time to make. I did not make all the recipes in the article, just the soup and it took less than a hour from start to finish.I had the article from Self. I would not have been able to make it without the entire article.

Here's a link to the original article in Self. This will help shed light on the confusion: http://www.self.com/fooddiet/2009/10/cook-once-eat-healthy-all-week-slideshow

The recipe as it's written is very confusing. I'm still not sure I made it correctly. My boyfriend liked it and I liked the soup without the lime shrimp. I didn't think it all worked together.

Actually, review by by s_m_bates is your best option if you are interested in seeing how all the recipes tie together. The article is "Cook Once, Eat Healthy All Week". It has all 5 recipes and the building blocks. It also has a shopping list that includes the items for all 5 recipes.

Actually, all you need to do is click on these items in the recipe and they will take you to a page titled "Building Blocks for Self Recipes" It has the ingredients & prep for 4 different items called for in the group of recipes that build upon one another, starting with Adobo-Glazed Mini Turkey Loaves. The items listed are: Mashed sweet potatoes, Onion and garlic mix, Broccoli & red bell pepper mix, and Lime Shrimp. Hope this helps!

Guess I have to be the idiot that asks...what on earth is Garlic and Onion Mix? Is it one of those powdered packet mixes (like onion soup mix) or are we talking about a 50/50 mix of the two ingredients?

This is confusing. The onion and garlic mix does NOT go in the soup. It needs an explaination of what "Iime shrimp" is too. I nould also cut the peas in half. I do love the flavor of the base soup.
