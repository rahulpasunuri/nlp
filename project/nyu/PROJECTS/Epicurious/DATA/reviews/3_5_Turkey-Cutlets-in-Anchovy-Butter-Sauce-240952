My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I added capers as some of the other reviewers suggested and I am glad that I did because I think the dish might have been a little flat without them. I also added some red pepper flakes to the breading. Next time I will skip the chives because they don't really seem to bring any flavor to the dish (okay, granted, they were probably overpowered by the capers). Oh, and I also used breadcrumbs instead of flour because I thought the flour would be kind of blah.

Holy Anchovies! Maybe it was because I forgot to pick up fresh shallots and used dried ones from Penzey's, but the sauce was unpalatable. Even after trying to cut it with some chicken broth. I ended up tossing it completely and making a piccata last minute to salvage the cutlets. I was really hoping I would like this recipe. I guess I can try anchovy paste for caesar salad dressing...

Made this the second time last night. It was "lick the plate" good. The first time I made it I only had cooking wine in the house--I strongly suggest NOT using it, as the salt in the wine and the anchovy paste leads to a very salty dish.

I would give this 3 1/2 if that were possible. I made it just as written and would add a bit more anchovy paste the next time around. I made this for a weeknight dinner with a rice pilaf and some roasted Brussels sprouts. Yum. No leftovers that night. I will make it again. The whole dinner didn't take more than 40 minutes from start to table.

Very easy, very tasty. I agree with the reviewer who said you can easily skip the chives.

I followed the recipe as written but I added some capers and didn't have enough wine - which didn't give me enough sauce. Next time I will definitely make sure I have enough wine on hand. By the way, I didn't see the need for the chives. I don't think it added anything special to the dish - may consider leaving it out next time.

I made this for Mother's Day dinner, I tripled the recipe and it worked beautifully. The only changes were minced red onion in place of the shallots I forgot, and the addition of capers to the finished sauce. 8 dinner guests raved!

I accidentally put in 2 TBSP anchovy paste instead of 2 tsp...but we were still sopping up the sauce with bread. Granted we drank water for the rest of the night, and acknowledged that it was too salty/anchovy, but we can't wait to make it again, properly. Which will undoubtedly be soon! Next time, we'll also cut the wine to a 1/2 or 3/4 cup; all that liquid just wasn't needed. Simple, fast and delish!

this was ok, easy to make but i think the anchovy paste was a little over powering i probably wont make it again or if i do i'll cut the paste

This dish was quite delicious. I added a little bit of cream to the sauce and served with grilled asparagus drizzled with lemon juice. My guest was pleased and the dog was unhappy there wasn't anything left in the plates!

This was yummy and super simple to make. I would have given it 3 forks, but bumped it up to 4 because I think it's a very good weeknight company recipe.

Sensational and super duper easy! I also used the chicken. My husband was still talking about it the next day. Wonderful flavors! I served with a lemon wedge for squeezing on top. It really heightend the flavor. Try it!

What a great alternative to piccata or marsala!! I made the recipe just as specified except for using flattened chicken breasts instead of turkey cutlets. I was a little worried about my kids eating anchovies (I didn't tell them what was in it), but my picky eaters ate their meat without making faces or complaining.

Very easy and tasty. I made it for weeknight company with chicken and it was very well received. I served it over brown rice.

FABULOUS!!!! WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO DO WITH TURKEY AND MY HUSBAND COULD NOT STOP RAVING ABOUT THIS DISH!!! I USED TURKEY TENDERLOIN THAT I CUT INTO PIECES AND POUNDED INTO THIN CUTLETS. A KEEPER FOR SURE...

Easy weeknight dinner. I doubled to sauce and both my boys (13 & 16) loved it. Didn't serve a starch, just mixed salad and haricot verts. No leftovers!

Easy and delicious - you can't tell that the anchovy is in there. I couldn't find turkey cutlets, so I used thin chicken cutlets and it was great - a keeper. I served it with spaetzle with parmesan cheese and haricot verts with butter.
