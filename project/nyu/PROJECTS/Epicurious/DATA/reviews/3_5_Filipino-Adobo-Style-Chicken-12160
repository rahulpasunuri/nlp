This is great! I just finished making it and my fussy 2 yr old is wolfing it down. I grilled the chicken on the BBQ then added it back to reduce and it was falling apart. I think i might make this tomorrow again! I used half cider vinegar and half red wine vinegar and normal full sodium soy sauce and i dont think it was too salty. I served it with steamed broccoli and white rice. This is also a low carb recipe which is great!

Simple, easy, relatively fast. Definitely grill the chicken instead of frying!

Try using 1/2 cup of soy sauce and 1/4 cup of black vinegar to cut down on the saltiness. I love the depth the black vinegar adds. Also added a tspn of brown sugar per a previous reviewer and loved the results.

I cut this recipe in half as it was just for me. I also added about a teaspoon of brown sugar to help reduce the salty taste from the soy sauce. It seemed to have worked as there was a really nice blend of tang/sweetness and saltiness in this dish. It is a great recipe and very easy as well with very few ingredients...I will make this again!

I cook alot and I would rate this one of the best and definately the easiest recipe I have tried for dinner. This was SOOOO Delicious. My fist time making adobo, had it 15 years ago made by a filippino lady and have wanted to make it ever since. I had some drumsticks and was dreading cooking them and I thought about adobo and googled this recipe. I used apple cider vinegar and added a few tbls of brown sugar. I added everything together and reduced the sauce and kind of "fried the chicken" more like warmed it back in the reduced sauce. I also added some rice to the reuced sauce and fried it in the pan after I coated the chicken and removed it from the pan, it was absolutely amazing. I will make this time and time again. THe funniest thing is I didnt even measure the ingredients I just eyeballed. Definately a keepeer.

There was a fairly strong vinegar taste, which I attribute to my use of the wrong type of vinegar. I thought the flavor was great, but I have other easier recipes with even better flavor.

Rating: 2
The chicken turned out to be too sour, so maybe less vinegar would make it better, or let more of the vinegar evaporate. I saved some of the sauce, made the chicken again with the reduction + water, and it tasted better.

Rating: 3
very good. I didn't think it would taste like Mom's, but it did! Not as greasy if you use chicken without skin (I used boneless, skinless thighs, that's the only part I like anyway). Strange that you brown the chicken after cooking it, I don't remember that as part of the recipe. Still, it was easy, fast and delicious, and makes great leftovers.

I was very disappointed with this dish. I used a nice rice vinegar and even used only 1 cup, but found it way too vinegary. My husband like it more than I did. Tonight are the leftovers, so maybe it will be better. I doubt I would make it again. I was longing for my Mom's good old PA Dutch recipe with onions and gravy.

in a word - YUM. i'd never had chicken adobo before but my sweetie requested it and i wanted to oblige. i followed the recipe to the letter save substituting chicken thighs for whole legs and broiling instead of sauteeing. the meat was falling- off-the-bone tender and the "lightly crushed" peppercorns added the perfect amount of spice. i didn't do the greatest job in skimming the fat from the sauce but as far as the boy is concerned, the greasier the better. i served it with plain steamed rice, black beans with onions and cilantro, and sauteed spinach with garlic. without a doubt, i'll be making this again.

My husband is Filipino and vegetarian, so I make adobong eggplant for him using a similar recipe. I brown the eggplant first and then simmer it with the sauce. In my opinion, whether it's done with eggplant or meat, the sauce is better with brown sugar, onions, and bay leaves added. Hard-boiled eggs are good in there as well!

I had to fudge a bit with what I had on hand, but it was really, really good. broiled after braising just to cut done on the fat. This will be a staple of mine.

Really awesome. I'm not sure how "authentic" it was, but this really hit the spot. The tangy sweetness in the vinegar and sourness in the soy sauce really brought out all the flavors of the chicken. I highly suggest using locally, sustainably farmed chicken for added flavor. Also, I used an entire chicken in parts rather than just the legs which worked out just as well.

I made this recipe with unfiltered apple cidar vinegar, and used a whole chicken instead of just the legs. It came out very tender, flavorful and falling off the bone.

I made this for my boyfriend who is half Filipino and he loved it! I used cider vinegar and seasoned rice vinegar instead of the distilled white, added a tsp of brown sugar (maybe a little more next time) and used more than twice the amount of garlic. I also didn't do the transfering in and out and just used one pot which worked very well. I let it simmer for about 2 1/2 hours which reduced the sauce just the right amount. Any less and there would be too much liquid, in my opinion. It was very tasty--my new favorite chicken recipe! It's quite salty so I might use low sodium soy sauce next time. And maybe try it with pork next time as well.

The secret to GREAT adobo is in the choice of vinegar. Adobo is as varied in recipe as there are types of Philippine vinegar (depending on which region of the country it originates). Best to use would be vinegar made from Coconut or Nipa Palm. However, availability may be an issue. Good substitute would be for you to run to an Asian grocery in your area and look for Datu Puti white vinegar made from sugar cane. Balsamic vinegar will not do. No need to thicken sauce by adding flour just reduce. Suggestion would be to add mashed chicken liver to the sauce while simmering. This'll thicken the sauce and add a rich flavor. Pork belly cut into 1-2" cubes goes very well with the chicken. If you're worried about all the oil, allow it to cool and scoop out all the chunks of lard. Don't forget to brown the chicken/pork before serving. It makes a world of difference. The secret to HEAVENLY adobo is to serve it after a few days and allow all the flavor to really set. With the sauce mixed in steamed rice, lightly dip meat in fish sauce. Yummm!

I just made this recipe with a few minor differences, and I have to say I wasn't terribly impressed. I had much higher expectations. The differences were that I used center-cut pork chops instead of chicken and I had to use 1 cup of white vinegar and 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar. The pork chops didn't absorb the flavor much at all, despite the 40 minutes of simmering, and weren't as moist and tender as i had hoped. Aside from the distinct flavor of vinegar, I couldn't really taste much of the other ingredients. I would suggest thickening the sauce with some flour or corn starch at the end. I haven't given up yet though, I'll try it again with chicken.

I read the reviews and made just these changes. Added the cider vinegar and more garlic. Didnt do anything else different at all. Instead of frying, just put it in the broiler & basted w/ sauce. Also fried the rice w/ sauce. Really good.

I thought it was pretty tasty, but my boyfriend didn't seem all that impressed. I added red chili pepper flakes, extra garlic and reduced the vinegar as suggested by some. Also, i used Apple Cider Vinegar as also recommended by many. It was very oily, but I think that is because I didn't remove the skin from the chicken.

Based on some of the reviews, I made a few changes to this recipe. I used a lot of garlic, about 8 cloves, added fresh grated ginger (1 tablespoon), and used cider vinegar. I also browned chicken first and then added the liquids. After the chicken was cooked. I reduced the liquid until thickened and then poured it over the chicken. Delicious.

Being a 1st generation filipino, I never got this recipe right until now. This was great! I used 1 cup of seasoned rice vinegar and 3/4 cup of soy sauce-and bay leaves and cracked pepper. I followed the directions exactly even sauteing the chicken at the end. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and breasts. My husband really like it!

My husband is half Filipino so he grew up with Filipino adobo. I was VERY nervous to try this recipe as I am NOT Filipino and I had not made adobo before on my own. However, I have had adobo with his family many times so I kind of knew what to expect taste-wise. I read the other reviews for this recipe and I decided to use 1/2 cup less vinegar. I used 1/4 cup cider vinegar and 1/4 cup regular vinegar. I added a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes. I browned the chicken, drained the oil and then added the vinegar mixture and the soy sauce and reduced the sauce with the chicken in the mixture. The chicken was flavorful and falling off of the bone when it was done. We served the chicken and the reduced sauce over rice. My husband thought that this recipe was delicious!! I have had adobo in many different Filipino households...no two people make it completely the same...so, feel free to vary this recipe to suit your individual taste. God bless.

This is a great recipe. Easy to make and very tasty. I do not fry the chicken,though I have grilled it once or twice. Many times I made this recipe at a homeless shelter where I was the cook. I multiplied it by six and used a 26-quart rondeau. The aroma of the sauce simmering always brought staff into the kitchen to see what was cooking. A good addition to the simmering liquid is crushed red pepper.

Great recipe. I am Filipino whose mom was a fantastic cook. I used more garlic, browned the chicken in the garlic and oil then added the rest of the ingredients. I did not transfer the chicken out of the pan when reducing the liquid and it was still delicious.

This dish rocks, not only because it is extremely simple and easy to prepare, but because the flavor is simply dope. I sauteed 4 cloves of garlic in olive oil in the bottom of a 6 qt. pot and then after a minute, I added 8 drumsticks and browned them for 3 minutes per side. Then I dumped in 3/4 cup white vinegar, 3/4 soy sauce, 1 cup water, a chopped vedalia onion, 3 bay leaves, pepper and salt and let it simmer for 40 minutes. It was great! My husband and roommate LOVED it and it was so low maintenance cooking!

This is an excellent recipe for even a novice cook. I am filipino and have been making Chicken Adobo for about 15 years now. Everyone I serve this to rants and raves about it. Really, all you have to do is throw all the ingredients in the pan and let it boil until the chicken is cooked to your liking. Try sauteing the garlic in Olive oil first, then add the other ingredients. You won't regret making this dish.

Love this! 4 stars because it's the perfect mid-week dinner: delicious, easy, quick. Chicken is incredibly moist and tender, tastes like you've marinated it overnight. Soy-garlic sauce is lick-the-plate good. Will double the sauce next time for leftovers.

There are only three words for this recipe: DEE LISH US! Thank goddess I resisted my urge to deviate too much from this recipe. Its simplicity is its genius. I used much more garlic than called for and substituted broth for water. The addition of pork was a most welcome modification as well. This dish renders satisfaction at its most basic level and constitutes soul food in its purest incarnation. Plain, steamed white rice and a rustic salad are a must as accompaniments.

Recipe handed down from my Mother: Use whole cut-up chicken, saute tons of crushed garlic in 1T. oil, add chicken pieces and cook until slightly browned (prevents chicken from falling apart), add equal parts of soy and CIDER vinegar and 1/2 part of water. Add 3 bay leaves, and peppercorns. Cook until chicken is tender but cooked. Add additional salt and pepper to taste. I've also added pineapple chunks using the juice in place of the water for a savory/sweet adobo. Try combining boneless pork cubes and chicken together.

I lived in the Philippines for two years. Try browning the Chicken and garlic 1st, then simmer in the vinegar and soy until sauce caramelizes onto chicken. Referred to by the natives as "Dry" adobo.

My mother makes it all in one pot no transfer and keep everything in the pot and more garlic and add an onion too. My sisters and I loved it with a little more juice so we didn't let the water get too low and I love the pork and my sisters love chicken so we always had both.

I followed the previous reviewer's suggestion of 1/2 c vinegar, 1/2 c soy, LOTS more garlic (I added 9 cloves), no oil, peppercorns, bay leaves, simmer for 2 hours. This form of the recipe is very easy, it takes nearly zero prep time and if you buy thighs and drumsticks separately, you don't even need to separate them yourself. I don't know what this recipe would have tasted like with the original recipe, I guess it's worth a try, but the form above is much much easier since there are no stages involved. I was tempted to add more liquids since it seemed very little for the amount of chicken, but it's not really necessary. The chicken itself will release a lot of juices as well as oil while it cooks. In particular, there is really no need to add vegetable oil; in the end, you'll have a huge excess of oil that you will probably want to skim off if you're concerned at all about eating healthy.

I make this quite often. We ate this when I was a child, and my dad (the Filipino) would also add pork. This is a nice and easy recipe.

I followed the previous reviewer's suggestions about using less vinegar, more garlic and bay leaves and keeping the chicken on the bone cooking it for several hours in a slow cooker. It was so amazingly easy and quick, my husband loved it, a man of few words. I could easily put this in a slow cooker before I go to work, and will be perfect in the evening. No mess. Do fry the rice in some of the sauce, it adds wonderful flavours to the rice.

Not bad. I'm Filipino, born in Manila. My mom taught me this way. 1/2 cup vinegar, 1/2 cup soy sauce, no water, no added oil, pepper corns and bay leaves are sufficient but more garlic, at least double and crushed. No need to transfer anything just put it in a pot and let it cook at a low boil for about 2 hours or until the liquid has been reduced,(almost all the liquid should be gone). The chicken will be almost falling off of the bone. This is Ilocano style. Also try this. After the adobo is done, drain the excess oil out of the pot leaving the reduced sauce, pepper corns, and garlic behind, take out the bay leves. Mix in some of your cooked rice and fry it up. VERY TASTY. You can also substitue pork(my personal favorite)in place of the chicken. Use a cut that has some fat, like pork shoulder. Cut the pork into 2 inch cubes and follow the same cooking instructions.

Rating: 2
Close to how my mom makes it, though she never did the transfering in and out... uneccessary in my opinion. I would also add about 1 cup water for more sauce, though some argue it takes away too much flavor. I would add A LOT more garlic (but I'm a garlic freak) and more bay leaves. Using drums or thigh WITH bones is a must. I like drums the best. Some filipinos add potatoes cut in 1-2 inch cubes during the last 15-20 mins of simmering... I love adding potatoes! and the last reviewer is right about your house smelling like vinegar... close your bedroom doors!

I made this recipe last night for my fiancee and it was very good. I think the procedures and ingredients outlined in the recipe all worked out fine, except for the reduction of the sauce, which required a lot more than the 10 minutes stated in the recipe. Otherwise, a definite keeper...

Rating: 3
First off, there are two things I did differently... 1) I used 3 boneless chicken breasts and 7 drumsticks. This turned out to be a good amount for 3 to 4 people. 2) I combined the soy sauce, vinegar, and all ingredients at the start, and just simmered for 30 min, instead of doing the vinegar for 20min. and then adding soy sauce and simmering for another 20 min. While my mixing the vinegar and soy sauce together might have reduced the potency of the vinegar flavor, I was happy with the result. Also, the 30 min of simmering and 5+ minutes of browning in a pan was more than enough cooking time. The chicken came out great and the final sauce was not as vinegary as I thought it might be. This is a good, basic chicken dish with a strong but simple flavor good for any night of the week. (Beware though, the vinegar aroma will fill your house for 24 hours.) ---

JUST A COMMENT ABOUT WHAT THIS TYPE OF COOKING IS REALLY ALL ABOUT--MY FIANCEE IS FROM CEBU, TALISAY, PHILIPPINES--AND I HAVE BEEN OVER THERE MORE THAN ONCE--FILIPINOS WILL ADD CRUSHED GARLIC, MINCED GINGER AND HOT PEPPERS TO A BOTTLE OF VINEGAR, AND ALLOW IT TO REST AT LEAST OVER NIGHT (THIS IS CALLED "SUTI"). THEY WILL MIX THIS HALF AND HALF WITH SOY SAUCE AND IT IS USED AS A MARINADE FOR CHICKEN OR PORK. THEY ALSO KEEP A SMALL BOWL OF IT AT THE TABLE FOR DIPPING-VERY DELICIOUS!!

I thought this version of Chicken Adobo was a bit dark. A friend of mine made his Adobo and it looked and tasted nothing like this one. I think I will have to make this again, only to lessen the white vinegar and the soy sauce. This dish defintely needs more than 20 + 20 simmer time.

I would make this recipe again but with less vinegar and water. Also would add soysauce with other ingredients, and not after 20 minutes. Also boil down liquid until very thick for best flavor. Current version imparts too vinegary flavor for our palate.

With a few modifications to the recipe, this definitely tastes better than my mom's or grandma's adobo! I had never heard of browning the chicken, but it really deepens the flavor! - I use 1/2 regular vinegar and 1/2 rice vinegar, use 3/4 tsp ground pepper instead of the peppercorns, lite soy, and I broil the chicken on high for about 3 minutes instead of frying. Make sure you reduce the liquid until thick for a really full flavor. To cook ahead and skim the fat more easily, you can put the dish in the fridge until cool, skim fat on top, and the reheat in oven.

This recipe sounds just like how my parents (both filipino) taught me to make adobo. We use frozen chicken wings though, lots more garlic (maybe 6-8 medium cloves for half a bag of wings) and don't bother frying. Just put everything in one pot, boil at a high temp for about 5-10 minutes and then simmer for another 20 min or so until the chicken is tender. Great food!

I make chicken adobo all the time and I wanted to give you all a suggestion. If you find it too greasy or oily, buy a special plastic ladle with a serrated edge and a valve at the bottom. Dip that in while it's cooking and the fat on top will pour through the serrated edge into the ladle. You'll get a bit of "real juice" too that you'll want to keep. It will settle to the bottom of the ladle. Just open the valve and let it back into the pot without the fat. If you can't find this ladle you can get creative with a basting syringe.
