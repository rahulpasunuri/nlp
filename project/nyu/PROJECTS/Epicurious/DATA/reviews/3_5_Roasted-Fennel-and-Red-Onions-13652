Great, simple recipe. Didn't feel like messing with butter so used all olive oil. It could cook a little longer if you want fennel and onion to caramelize more but even at 25 minutes, was delicious. I piled in a piece of whole wheat naan I had on hand for a vegetarian dinner. Perfect!

This recipe is good as is--- but for something fabulous subititue leeks for the red onions (quartering them lengthwise)-- and then crumble a gorganzola or other mild blue cheee on top at the last minute ( put back in oven for 1-2 minutes just to melt cheese). I used a flavorfull olive oil and left out butter. Great with Turkey for Thanksgiving!!!!!

Here's how I used this recipe: I sliced open a croissant and spread a small amount of mayonnaise across each side. Then I put one thin slice of pepper turkey on each side. Next I filled the croissant with the roasted fennel and red onion, added a little salt and pepper, and folded the croissant together. Totally outrageous with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc.

I didn't have any red onions so I made this just with the fennel. The vinegar really added another dimension to the flavor and the recipe was easy overall.

mmmm scrumptious!! I think I'll add as little oil as possible next time, adding more water instead. You can add whatever spices you like to this, and it takes on a new color. I myself put in curry, cumin, and red pepper flakes along with some vegetable bouillon and discovered that curry and fennel are like best friends. This dish does not disappoint, and leaves room for creativity!

This was simple and very good. I'll make again, but next time I'll omit the butter and just use twice as much olive oil. Also, I cooked it about 10 minutes longer so the vegetables would caramelize.

Quick and easy. Added some fresh thyme. Have made it often. Always a hit.

I liked the recipe, but my husband isn't a fennel fan, so not sure I'd make it again. Although I've had sauteed fennel with dill weed, and might try the recipe again with dill weed. I sliced the vegetables instead of quartering them. Also found that the recipe serves about 10-12 people, not 2.

Yummy! So easy! I added additional veggies (sweet potato, turnip, red pepper), but alone would also be very good. It needed extra cooking time, but made it a couple of hours in advance and reheated it, but think it could also be served at room temperature. Will make over and over again.

Awesome! I loved this. I never really ate fennel before until recently when I made the Proscuito, Fennel & Apple Salald and this dish. Both were great. I will make this again.

We roasted the ingredients to this recipe in a pocket of aluminum foil on our Weber grill (indirect) for 25 minutes. Delicious!

This was our vegetable at our gourmet dinner group this past weekend. It went very well with a braised pork loin main course. The fennel flavor is unique. We added celery to stretch the recipe and it complimented the dish nicely. I found that it takes almost twice the time noted to cook until tender.

This dish is great. I omitted the butter and balsamic vinegar, and the flavor was tremendous. I highly recommend preparing fennel this way.

I loved this recipe for several reasons: delicious, an interesting and different taste, and SO easy to make! I used Vidalia onions because I didn't have red onions, and the Vidalias gave a sweet taste - can't imagine red onions would be better! Also, I sliced the fennel and the onions, rather than cutting them into wedges. I served it with salmon, rice, and salad.
