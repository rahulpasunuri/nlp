Way too complicated for a watery and bland broth. The chef from Mexico below tells you how to do it.

I use the ingredients in this recipe and I like the flavor, but I would never use a whole chicken for stock. The meat will taste horrible. I guarantee that you will throw it out. When I cook a whole chicken, I put the bones, neck, wings, etc... in a freezer bag and freeze it. Then I take 2-3 of them and make stock. Same great flavor and you aren't wasting all that breast and leg meat.

This does seem a little complicated for chicken stock but I wanted to offer a tip. I suggest removing the breast and thigh meat from the whole chicken leaving the bones. Then after your stock is finished I cook the breast meat and thigh meat briefly in the stock when you are ready to make soup. That way it stays nice a moist and does not get over cooked. After all the bones are all that are really needed for the stock.

Too many unnecessary steps. I've been making excellent stock for 20 years and have never boiled the chicken first, then added water. I just bring all the ingredients to the boiling POINT..not to a full boil, over medium heat, then skim. The secret to great stock is to heat it slowly, then maintain it at a simmer, not to boil at all. I also add 3 TB of vinegar at the outset and a chopped leek to my broth.

I followed the recipe and found that the stock was too watery. I often make my own chicken stock and use about half of the water called for in this recipe.
