This is very easy to make, and tasty too. I used an extra garlic clove to give it a little more kick. Next time I might try olive oil instead of butter; I found it a little too buttery tasting. But still rated it 3 stars; excellent -- and my guests enjoyed it too.

Easy and good.

Easy, tasty, and as the previous reviwer said, simpler IS best when it comes to broccoli rabe. Served it with the skillet polenta with cherry tomatoes (see Bon Appetit recipe this site) and some grilled sausage - my husband said "it looked like a restaurant meal" - and it all took less than 45 minutes start to finish.

This tasted good and was very easy to prepare.

Took advantage of a 1/2 price sale of broccoli rabe at the local supermarket. Sauteed ginger along w/the garlic, simply because I needed to use it before it went bad. Great accompaniment to any number of main dishes. Simple as can be.

I had never had broccoli rabe before, and I thought it tasted very much like collard greens. It was not really what I expected, but it was pretty good with hot pepper vinegar, southern-style.

Broccoli rabe is best made simply. This is perfect!
