Canned beef gravy??? Why is this recipe on epicurious???

I've made this a number of times and it always goes over well. I leave out the prunes and add cremini mushrooms (quartered) when I add the pearl onions.

I've made this several times. I love the boneless/skinless chicken in it, but always use the classic mushrooms instead of prunes.

Great recipe I made it the day before all the flavors mellowed It was great I'd definately make it again

Felt the recipe was reasonably flavorful, but not as knock-out as others that cook longer. But for a quick coq-au-vin, it's OK.

Another great find from epicurious.com! My husband loves the rich sauce. The prunes make it very interesting.
