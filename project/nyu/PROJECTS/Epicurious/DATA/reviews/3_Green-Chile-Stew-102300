This should work just fine. For all those reading it, though, just because something is a chile pepper and green doesn't mean you should use it in this! This recipe requires Hatch green chiles, a distinct New Mexico variety that is warm and acidic, not hot. They're seasonal and actually appearing in stores in Missouri right now.

3 forks for inspiration alone. I had 3 really thick pork chops, 2 cans of green chilies and most of the remaining ingredients. I browned cubes of the pork chops added the onions etc. plus some garlic and the spices and then the celery and carrots. When these were all nicely cooked I added the tomatoes, green chilies, enough chicken broth to cover and brought it to a simmer and added the potatoes and simmered until the potatoes were tender. Yum for a fall evening dinner and the leftovers were great.

This was a great stew. Beats restaurant food. Good for a cold night. I added 4 extra seranno's to the recipe, and a tablespoon of garlic, like the others. It still wasn't hot enough for me. Next time I'll add a jalepeno. But loved it still. Served it with fresh rolls and butter. Definitely a keeper. I don't know why some people didn't like it,and others did go figure. It's just a hearty, earthy stew.

Boring, and I thought there was WAY too much celery seed in the recipe, which caused my stew to be bitter. Was able to salvage it by adding more potatoes and cooking it down as much as possible. I'm going back to my old recipe from New Mexico magazine.

I make this dish often. I always use grassfed Burgundy Pasture beef. Maybe that is why it is so good! I leave the celery and only use a little potato. Fresh roasted chiles are a must. I add extra each time.

I'm sorry, maybe I missed something here. Followed the recipe exactly, using pork shoulder, and had to throw the whole thing away and cook something else for dinner. My husband agreed it was a disaster. Not only did it not taste good, but it was WAY to hot to eat. Spicy hot. Maybe I messed something up, but this was the worst.

Very good winter soup. I used canned poblano peppers and added a dollop of sour cream to thicken. Delicious!

My husband and I got an intro to green chile stew while vacationing in Santa Fe/Taos this May. This is similar to the stew we had at the Old Blinking Light Tavern outside Taos. I used pork (as does the OBL), followed the recipe to the letter. I may make some modifications next time, but if I do they will be minor. Regarding the green chiles -- you really should roast your own. I picked up anchos, jalapenos, anaheims & habaneros at the local farmers market; used used the called-for amount in the stew, and froze the rest. They'll be on hand for the next time I cook this up. The chiles are such an important component of the flavor (and heat) of this recipe, you shouldn't compromise the result by using canned.

Yummo. This is cooking right now on my stove. I made a few, minor alterations with substantial results: I cooked the pork butt whole so I could shred it (we like this better than cubes). Also, I did everything except add potatoes and let it sit overnight in fridge so I could skim off the fat, then continued cooking this afternoon. One other suggestion I have (tho I didn't do it) is to use canned chiles instead of roasting them myself. Any thoughts on that? I hope my family likes it--my kids are protesting the idea of eating "a pig's butt" but I think they'll change their minds.

Nice change of pace. I followed the recipe closely (pork), though 5 potatoes seemed too many so I cut back. Browning the meat would be nice, but as-is it was great and extrememly low fat. A little fresh cilantro garnish is a welcomed addition.

Like old fashioned beef stew, with green chile added. That's not a bad thing.

This is GREAT! I had some stew meat and was looking for a recipe that was a twist from the everyday. Man oh man, does this stew have ZING! Yummy yummy! I'll try it with pork next time...I bet it'd be even better.

A native New Mexican now living in Hawaii, I had my brother FedEx me a cooler of frozen roasted green chile from Mr. Padilla's farm in Belen NM, just to make this dish. The hotter the better! :D He even peeled it for me...Thanks Bro. I also put one dried red chile pod in the pot after browning the pork butt. Just let it disintigrate. It adds a nice color to the stew.

I changed this recipe so much as I was makinh it, I can't imagine how bland the original must be. I was looking for a more authentic Mexican verde like we have around here, and this was not it. Definately use the whole recipe of green chiles.

Some of the previous reviewers obviously haven't spent much time in New Mexico. I made this for a dinner party of native New Mexicans and everyone loved it. The pot was empty by the end of the evening! I browned the pork pieces first to create a nice base for a brown broth. I also added more green chili (just roasted and chopped) and minced garlic to the recipe. Fabulous! This will be a winner all winter!

I think that this is a splendid dish that more of the world should become accustomed to. Green chile is incredibly healthy for you(as well as the rest of the vegetables in the dish) and is tasty at the same time. I have to admit that I am biased because I grew up on green chile, but I have been to other parts of the world time and again and when I get back home I have to have my green chile fix. Careful, the stuff is highly addictive!

Great! The only problem I had was that the beef I used was too lean. I plan to use pork next time.

Having grown up in Wisconsin, winter soups and stews are king. Fortunately I married a girl from Albuquerque who introduced me to the finer cuisines of the southwest. This recipe is almost exactly what her grandmother tought her and we love it.

I used a pre-cooked pork roast portion, so I could remove additional fats. I did scale it down for about two people, but didn't substitute anything. The flavor was wonderful. This could be used for company.

I just wanted to say that green chile stew does have potatoes and celery. I'm from Colorado and we know that here too. I think the key here is the word "stew". The person from Georgia must have had plain green chile and doesn't really know what she is talking about.

This is the way that true New Mexican green chile stew is made...contrary to the person from Athens Georgia who wouldn't know the difference between a green chili and a bell pepper!!! We in Albuquerque, New Mexico loved this recipe!!!

The true green chili stew would not have celery and carrots or potatoes. I have made and eaten green chili many times after learning how to make it from my husbands family from Colorado where it is a favorite. This recipe is awful and should never been printed on the internet.

This recipe did not work out well at all. Nothing like any of the wonderful Green Chile Stews I have had in the Southwest previously. Very watery. A disappointment.

I was glancing through channels and came upon your show and was very interested and loved you recipes. I made the Tortillas and Chili Stew and now my husband loves it to. I know that I will be a very good customer. Thank You
