Much oilier than need be. Unless you really cut everything out but the heart (or maybe use younger artichokes?) you are still picking through the fibrous portions of the leaves....even after cooking 1/2 longer than recommended.

WE loved it...Its' great looking as a first course with a small-medium articoke! A perfect dish for guestd because it looks like it took hrs to make!

Very tasty and quite simple (once you've cleaned the artichokes). I had the pancetta cut about 1/4 inch thick. It was a little difficult to chop the fatty part "finely" as called for, but the braising made that pancetta very tender. I made this once before with the stem rounds but ommitted them this time. They don't add much. This is a good dish for company because the time consuming parts (cleaning the chokes and chopping the other ingredients) can be done in advance. Garnish with fresh parsley and lemon wedges.

A surprisingly easy dish to make. I used deli bacon instead of Pancetta and it worked fine (and saved me $11!).

A biton the boring side for the work needed. The stem pieces were unusual to say the least. Had to boil longer than the stated cooking time.

We all liked this recipe but I added a little chopped shallots,butter and parmesan cheese because I thought it a little bland with just the few ingredients it called for. It was different than the same old stuffed ones I make.The stems were OK.I thought there flavor a little unusual.
