Very good. Maybe add more bacon.

Great twist on a standard recipe, BUT they forgot one key ingredient--no Roman would ever make carbonara without loads of cracked pepper.

After trying a couple of recipes for carbonara sauce using leeks is the winner for me. I used egg yolks only with a touch of light cream and added about 1/4 c light cream to the leeks off heat before tossing in the pasta. My search for the perfect carbonara is over.

I halved everything, threw in some garlic with the leeks, sauteed some sliced mushrooms in some extra bacon fat I had (amazing), and threw them in at the end. I would have added frozen peas, but I was out :( Next time! It was soooo perfect!

This dish was extremely satisfying and full of flavor. I used farfalle and onions and it was very yummy. Definitely will make it again.http://homesandbabies.blogspot.com/2011/04/authentic-carbonara.html

This recipe is delicious! The flavor depends largely on using very high quality bacon, fresh eggs and real parmesan reggiano. I doubled the bacon,used sweet onion (didn't have any leeks), and added a couple cloves of crushed garlic. I also used whole wheat spaghetti instead of orichette (my husband prefers long noodles). Will definitely make again.

I made this on the fly one night at my brother's house. We had regular bacon, just plain white onion and linguine... and Kraft Parmesan cheese! I added a little whipping cream because it was in the fridge and it was a complete hit! I will make it again for sure.

This is a regular recipe in my repertoire especially for weeknight dinners. I generally have almost every ingredient on hand at all times except for leeks which makes it so handy in a pinch. It's easy to make and everyone loves it. I double up the leeks and bacon and I've tried medium shells and farfalle. Both work great.

This was quite nice. The leeks were a very welcome addition to carbonara. My bf grew up with americanized carbonara (a lot of cream), and was surprised by the mild taste, but liked it more as he kept eating. I do think next time I make it I will add a couple of cloves of garlic to the leeks, I definitely missed them (we're big garlic people). Next time I make it, I will also be sure to grate my own parmesan. With so few ingredients, each is very important to the taste, and I think a freshly grates cheese will be a big improvement.

Excellent meal that is quick to make. This meal enforces the culinary credo-use the freshest ingredients possible. I made this as prescribed except that I used a quality pancetta. I also used Regianno parm, fresh picked parsley and a pepper blend from Willians Sonoma. As for the carbonara, I whisked the sauce in a sauce pan on med heat with the boiling pasta water for a couple of minutes. Be careful though because you do not want to "cook" the sauce. This will be made again!!

This was spectacular! So easy and quick too. I did use 6 pieces of bacon, as much as 8 could work. I sauteed two very large minced garlic cloves with the leeks but other than that followed exactly. Had to stop myself from eating it all. :)

This was a great, easy recipe to make (I used small shells as a replacement). A couple of quick recommendations: 1) I only used about two and a half strips of bacon, and I think that was the perfect amount. 2) Don't cook the leeks until they are too tender. Leaving a bit of crunch to them really brings out their flavor. 3) Be careful putting the pasta water in the egg mixture. I added it too quickly and I think it cooked the mixture too fast.

This was so so so good. What a carbonara should turn out to be. I loved the red pepper and extra bacon. I tried peas but wouldn't add them again, they compete for taste with the leeks. I served over arugula tossed in olive oil, minced garlic and freshly ground salt and pepper. Delicious.

Like others have said, it was just ok. Not much flavor except for the bacon.

this was good, I couldn't find the orrechiette so I used medium shells. I added extra bacon and some peas. yum.

I like making this when I don't have tons of time but want something fresh and with lots of flavor! However, I think the amount of pasta can overwhelm the other flavors, so I double the bacon (two leeks are more than enough) and add some red pepper. Mmmm!

I'm not going to rate this until I make it but I'm wondering how on earth it can be low cal or even remotely healthy. Heck, might as well add some sausage and half a cup of cheese.

This recipe was disgustingly good. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and added red pepper for the kick. I also heard about a local restaurant that serves carbonara over buckwheat noodles, so I used an 8 oz. package of soba instead of 10 oz. spaghetti. The proportions of sauce to noodle were perfect - DELICIOUS. Only douwnside, no leftovers.

I used 1 leek instead of 2 and was glad I did. Simple, delicious, and fast. The left-overs made a great lunch the next day. All my co-workeers were begging for a taste. I will keep this one on the monthly dinner menu.

Quick, easy and delicious recipe. A crowd pleaser for children and adults alike. I substitute pancetta for the bacon and am very generous with the black pepper. I've also substituted shallots for the leeks at times which tastes just as good although not as colorful in the bowl.

this recipe is easy and delicious! i added mushrooms and sauteed along with the leeks.

This recipe is fantastic and quite easy to make. we've made it a few times now - sometimes as a main course, and sometimes as a side dish without the bacon. we've also added other vegetables to it for some variety.

I doubled this recipe but after adding the egg mix to the pasta it wasn't hot and a bit runny so I had to heat it over med-low heat which meant I needed more liquid. So I added an extra 1/2 cup of pasta water and a bit of cream that I had to keep it creamy :) I am also a bit paranoid about the eggs being raw so I did let it heat for a few minutes, but it was still never HOT. I also added red pepper flakes for some spice and extra parmesan (about 3/4 cup extra for double recipe) it was yummy! There was nothing left for leftovers :) I would make again but definately with the red pepper to give it enough flavor.

I added peas and more leek and bacon. Awesome.

Great taste. The bacon adds a wonderful flavor. But if you wanted a vegetarian dish you could omit it. I added some quartered grape tomatoes at the very end, it gave it a little burst of flavor.

Delicious! A quick weeknight meal that can pack in a bunch of veggies - I hid a whole bunch of Swiss chard in this recipe, and it was awesome. (Obviously, as the chard was sauteed in rendered bacon fat.)

Excellent recipe and quick to make on a weeknight. I've never cooked with leeks before and they were so flavorful in the bacon greast.

hmm.. tasty. I made a few modifications, but tried to be faithful to the recipe. The main departure was that instead of leeks I used half of a med. sized onion and two small, inner ribs of celery

I'm surprised so see the reviews for this recipe. Its one of my boyfriends and my favorites, and it really isn't that heavy. Its nothing compared to a cream sauce. Though I usually cut a little back on the bacon (only three slices), use only about a tablespoon of bacon fat (which incidentally has about the same calories and fat as olive oil). The key to the flavor, in my opinion, is using enough leeks, not the bacon. The recipe is pretty unique but delicious. Also, I haven't actually tried it with Orecchiette as it is hard to find. Usually I just use Farfalle.

this is easy, tasty and yes, high fat. It's a treat. We added an extra egg, more bacon and for color, thawed frozen peas. I've made it twice already for guests with fantastic reviews.

This recipe wound up tasting pretty good...I added garlic with the leeks because I can't imagine an Italian-style dish without garlic, used pancetta instead of bacon, and added lots of black pepper! Overall it was good and I would make it again.

It was just ok. This didn't have a lot of flavor - I kept adding salt but couldn't get it to taste right. Bacon was flavorful, but withoug it - it was bland

If you like very creamy, high fat foods, this is delicious. Unfortunately, we prefer veggies. However it was very tasty and we may make it again in the future.

I love the flavor and convenience of this recipe! I usually have all the ingredients in the pantry, and it would be easy to modify by adding in other vegetables.

incredibly delicious and easy to make, literally takes about 20 minutes. would use 3 eggs so it's saucy enough, also added sauteed wild mushrooms.
