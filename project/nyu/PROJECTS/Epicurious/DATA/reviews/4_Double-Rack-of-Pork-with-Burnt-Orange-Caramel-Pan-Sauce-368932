Superb pork roast! Made this for Christmas dinner and it was amazingly moist and delicious. I made the sauce ahead. I actually didn't think it was that much work, but I suppose it is if compared to a tenderloin. Some guests didn't show and my son took one of the roasts back to his loft where he and his friends ate it very happily! Great recipe.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I made the sauce a few hours ahead (up to the point where the recipe says "set the caramel sauce aside") and refrigerated until the pork was done. Worked well. One mistake I made was not having enough fat on the pork to get the rub in properly. Make sure you ask the butcher to leave the 1/4 inch. Note: The recipe calls for pork to be 135 degrees which seemed low (after checking many websites the lowest read for pork we found was 145). Anyway, we followed the cooking directions, which took the pork to 155 and it was done perfectly. . I was afraid the sauce was going to be too sweet but it was lovely,

Served this at our Holiday Dinner for 19 people and it got rave reviews -- the best pork they ever ate!

You have to be really committed to make this, but if you do it's worth it. One of the best meals I've ever had. Took a walk during the two hour curing window, and thank goodness. Might not be able to move otherwise. Cheddar scalloped potatoes made the perfect accompaniment.

I agree with all the other reviewers. Absolutely the best pork recipe ever. The sauce is key. Wonderful combination of flavors.

I followed directions as given except I used one 6 pound rack of pork. The first comment from my family after the first bite: "This is the best pork I ever had." I will definitely serve this at a dinner party.

Kind of a "Pork à l'orange" - very yummy!

Pork roast is always delicious. The orange sauce is a treat. Lots of effort but worth it.

I made this for friends and family for New Year's Eve. It was spectacular. The pork was very moist and the sauce was delicious. I followed the recipe just as written. I served it with herb roasted fingerling potatoes and haricot verts. While the entire recipe was a bit time consuming I will definitely make again.

Made this for friends pre-Thanksgiving, using just one rack, but following the rest of the recipe. Everyone licked their plates, including our son's mostly vegetarian girlfriend. Can't wait to fix it again.

Made this for Christmas dinner for ten adults. It was unanimously voted the best pork anyone had ever eaten. The meat came out so tender and juicy, and the sauce was incredible. My oven is crazy and burns everything, so I had to skip deglazing the pan and just made the sauce, adding the juices from the meat after it rested. Served it with celery root and apple puree, green beans with dried cherry vinaigrette, yams with brown butter vinaigrette, and 3-cheese scalloped potatoes (all from this site). Everything went very nicely together. Will definitely be making this again.

This pork was spectacular - full of flavor, moist and beautifully presented. My guests raved. My husband said that it's the best pork he's ever eaten. The sauce was good but a bit time consuming. The pork was great both with and without it. I served this with the two potato gratin - a nice pairing.

I followed this recipe as written, with exception of substituting apple cider for bourbon, and excluded Grand Marnier altogether. End result was exceptional - best pork I have ever eaten - each bite was as moist as the previous. Company agreed. Will definitely make again. What beautiful presentation.
