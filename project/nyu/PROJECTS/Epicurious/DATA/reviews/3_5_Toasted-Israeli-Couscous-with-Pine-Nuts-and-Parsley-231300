Love this recipe. I cut back on the butter and have tried it substituting olive oil instead--with fine results. I also add mushrooms. I sautee 2-3 cups of mushrooms--a couple different kinds--and add them with the pine nuts. Delicious!

This is a lovely recipe; I've made it several times. I cut the liquid to 3 cups total, and instead of all chicken broth, I used 2 cups broth and 1 cup water to avoid an overpowering taste of chicken stock. One time when I made it, it seemed too wet but it was quickly fixed by putting it in the oven on low heat for about 15 minutes, which made it a bit crunchy. My grown sons love this!

This is a very tasty side dish to serve with chicken or lamb. The pine nuts can be toasted without butter on the stovetop or in the oven. Our proportions for a generous serving for two are: 3/4 cup couscous, 1 tablespoon butter, 1/4 cup chopped onions or shallots, 1/4 cup pine nuts, 1 cup stock plus 1/2 cup water (plus more water added during cooking, if necessary), 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 bay leaf, zest from one lemon, 1/4 cup parsley and salt and pepper to taste.

Fabulous recipe! I made this last night for a dinner party and everyone raved. The blending of the pine nuts, parsley and cinnamon gave this a distinctive flavor. I too cut the butter way down -- no need for all of it.

This was a bit hit for the entire family. My husband doesn't like the texture of regular couscous, but he gave this a strong vote as a keeper. A good alternative grain dish!

This is quite excellent. I've made it by-the-book several times. You can substitute onions for shallots, leave out the pine nuts, and use 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon in place of the stick and it still is great.

I loved this. its a delicate dish yes, but its so good. I love the texture of Israeli Couscous. and adding the cinnamon and bay, i love it. My husband asked for this this evening as a side dish I've made it a few times now and we always enjoy it.

I really loved this recipe. It is simple but the flavors go so well together. I loved the subtle flavor and aroma of the cinnamon and the crunch of the pine nuts. I also cut down on the butter, using 3 tablespoons total. I will make this again and again. This time I made it with the Grilled Chicken, Red Onion, and Mint Kebabs with Greek Salad recipe from this website. Delicious!

It has really good, but subtle, flavor and we liked the bigger couscous. I too, cut down on the amount of butter and let it sit for 10-15 minutes before serving. I could see this going with a really great lamb kabob!

This is just the recipe on the back of the box of couscous from Trader Joe's - OK, but nothing special

Meh. Was nice to use a different grain, but wouldn't bother making it again. Even the next day when I added some mint to liven it up, it just is a bland ingredient. I think I'm just not enthralled by Israeli couscous. I'll stick with regular couscous or quinoa.

I loved this recipe - it was fresh and tasty. I eyeballed the butter as well, so I didn't find it too greasy. I sauteed some mushrooms and added them in when I served it. I will absolutely be making this recipe again.

This was OK. It came out fine. I did not have the problems others had with it being too sticky or oily, etc. I made it as written, and the couscous came out light and fluffy (though I let it sit covered off the heat for about 15 minutes to absorb any excess liquid). The cinnamon and bay were subtle. It was well-received by the family, who thought it was interesting. But it just wasn't interesting or tasty enough for me to make this again. For me, the couscous itself was bland and did not absorb any flavor from the seasonings and the beads, being so large, it was hard to overlook.

Love this! I toastd the pine nuts in a dry skillet,-came out fine. I made it with 1 cup couscous. I eyeballed the amout of butter, and like others haave said it was too much. So next time I would cut butter down by at least 1/2.I served this with the Moroccan Chicken and Lemons from this site, which was very good.I you make it with something that has a lot of sauce, then I don't think that you need much butter.

This was perfect! I made several substitutions: -vegetable broth instead of chicken broth -garlic instead of shallots -ground cinnamon instead of a stick -added golden raisins

I was disappointed, especially after seeing everyone else's forks. Seemed bland and mushy. Perhaps I used too much broth? Missed the suggestion of lemon juice or zest which would have been a nice addition. I'm wondering if a bigger pot with wider bottom would have helped? Seemed my shallots were swimming in butter, not really sauteeing, more like soaking. That might have added another layer of flavor? As it is my kids ate it because it was so bland! I'm going to try it again assuming it was chef's error! Hopefully I will be upgrading my review.

My family and I LOVED this recipe! The texture of the couscous was so smooth and light. This was my first time making Israeli couscous instead of the smaller size couscous and I'm glad it was such a hit. I decreased the amount of fat by toasting the couscous and pine nuts in the oven. I only used about 1/2 - 1 tablespoon butter in sauteing the shallots. I used 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon instead of a cinnamon stick.

Great for pot-lucks. Be sure to toast the couscous for pretty brown color. Amazing what flavor the humble cinnamon sticks adds. Who knew?

Wonderful recipe. Easy and Fast! It is very impressive too. I usually serve it with chicken, lamb and beef kabobs and Naan bread grilled on the BBQ. Every time I serve this, my guests ask me for the recipe. The bonus is that all my young nieces and nephews love it. Finally, I have found something that they devour. The cinnamon stick adds such a fun flavor.

This was excellent. I only used 1/2 Tbs butter to toast the pine nuts and 1/2 Tbs to saute the shallots. I did not feel that it was missing a thing.

Israeli couscous is already toasted; you purchase it that way.

Very easy and very tasty. I toasted the pine nuts in the oven at 400 for 8 minutes and the couscous for 12 minutes. I added raisins at the same time as the broth and the juice of half a lemon along with the parsley. Couldn't tell if the lemon added anything to the flavors but it was delicious! Hubby loved it and said it tasted "toasty". Plan to make it for friends later this month -- I'm sure it'll be a hit.

I just made this for the first time for a party of 40 people. It was delicious and easy. Other reviewers' suggestions for adding lemon at the end was right on. It will not be soggy, as 1 reviewer's was, if you don't let the toasted couscous sit in the broth before you're ready to boil. Everyone loved it, and I'll make it again

This was good, and fairly easy. Since it called for the couscous already toasted, I did exactly that, but in the oven with the oven with the pine nuts (as another reviewer suggested,) for @ 8 minutes at 400. Interesting that you pan-toast them again, before adding the broth, but it came out fine. The cinnamon and bay leaf were not at all strong, just added a nice, interesting background flavor.

Delicious. I added raisins 1/2 way through the cooking and juice of 1/2 lemon right before serving.

As another reviewer mentioned, this is a perfect side dish for the Silver Palate Chicken Marbella recipe. You may need to cook a little longer to make sure all the chicken stock is fully absorbed. When I make this next time, I plan to add a little lemon zest at then end to brighten up the flavor a little.

Great recipe. I dry toast the pine nuts and use about half as much butter for the couscous and it still turns out great.

I followed the directions using 3 cups, not 16 ozs. couscous. I prepared everything ahead of time and added the broth 10 minutes before I was ready to serve it. I added some fresh lemon juice at the end which really brought out the flavors. I served it with Silver Palate Chicken Marbella. It was agreat do ahead meal and everyone loved it.

I Made this recipe for a picnic at the Hollywood Bowl. I was a little short on the shallots so when I chopped the parsley I added 3 green oinions & the the zest from 1 lemon. I was serving it at room temperature so I waited until it cooled to add the parsley mixture. This was a huge hit!

Good. Maybe because this is part of a menu the number of servings is missing-but the full recipe should serve 8-10 easily. I made half of it for 5 adults and with the Muscovy Duck and Brussel Sprouts/Cauliflower it was just the right amount. Flavor combination was a nice change-not very South Beachy though so it will have to go in the file for holiday use unless there is a whole wheat version of Israeli toasted couscous available!! - Christmas 2006

This is an amendment to the review below. I forgot I used only 10 oz. of couscous. If you use the 16 oz. called for in the recipe, you could get 8-10 servings.

This was very good. I saved some calories by toasting the pine nuts in the toaster oven. The recipe doesn't state a serving size, but it would be easy to get 6 side servings out of this recipe.

This was nice, but the couscous was a little gummy. I'd never made it before but had enjoyed it when others did, and I remember the grains (yes, it was Israeli -- the big ones) as being very distinct, not mushy. Did I do something wrong? I followed the proportions as written.

I can't understand why people like this recipe. I followed it to the letter, and felt the bayleaf-cinnamon combination was quite unpleasant, it almost tasted spoiled.

Made it once and loved it. Making it again tonight for company. Sauce can definitely be increased. To toast pine nuts, use 1 Tbsp butter in a skillet over med heat. I chopped mine rather than whole.

This is a simple, fabulous dish. It is very fragrant, especially if you use a fresh bay leaf and fresh cinnamon stick. The toasting process - including toasting the pine nuts and then the couscous - really makes this very simple dish more complex, w/ layered flavors. You can cut back on the butter. I've made it several times and everyone loves it.

My guests and I thought this was fabulous. It cooked in the specified amount of time and didn't need draining. Perhaps the cook below used the regular couscous instead of *israeli* couscous, which is barley-sized and absorbs more water.

Rating: 2
The couscous was done in 8 minutes, and I needed to drain it as it had too much liquid in it. Next time I will cook it with 2 1/2 cups of broth and see what happens. I also felt that the pinenuts did not have to be toasted in butter i just toasted them in the oven without any fats, for a few minutes until golden brown. I used olive oil to toast the shallots and couscous, it was just fine. I did add some diced red pepper to add color to the dish. Otherwise it was o.k.
