Maybe it's me (based on all the 4 fork reviews) but the nanosecond between cooling the marshmallow/coffee/milk mixture and before it sets is not enough time to add the whipped cream. The end result: tasty, lumpy mousse-like concoction and lots of dirty bowls, double boiler, whisk (use a spoon) and other cooking implements. Will just make real chocolate mousse next time.

A terrific Passover dessert when prepared with pesadich marshmallows. I made a trifle with the Decadent Fudge Brownies from this site and layered them in a glass bowl, alternating brownies, mousse and fresh whipped cream two times each. I topped the second whipped cream layer with grated chocolate for a nice presentation. Dessert was a huge hit at our seder.

This was very good. I made the recipe with all the measurements called for and I ended up with 10 ample sized servings and some people said that it was good, but too rich to finish. It was not too rich for my six year old daughter. I liked the dollop of chocolate on top. Also, I have not had very good luck with my whipped cream staying whipped, so I added a packet of unflavored gelatin and it worked perfectly. Nice and fluffy and creamy.

This was excellent. My 9-year old and I had a feast and even my coffee-hating husband enjoyed it. Next time, I may use a little less coffee powder. I also used it with a coffee cake for which I had found the recipe on Epicurious.

Great recipe. Simple and delish. I served this with fresh raspberries on top. I think the chocolate on top is a nice touch but certainly not necessary. Cheers

I love this recipe. I don't typically like mousse and my husband hates marshmallows but this is awesome! I have served it at dinner parties and it has been a huge hit (no one knows that there are marshmallows in it). I top it with a couple fresh berries and it is very very elegant.

I used this recipe as a general guide, and made a few changes. Instead of using instant coffee, I used hot chocolate mix (chocolate hazelnut) and then about half-way through when I realized that whisking the cream wasn't going to get it to stiffen (didn't have a beater), I had to find a way to salvage this dessert. I only added about 1/2 cup of cream/vanilla mixture to the melted chocolate and then folded the marshmallow stuff into that. It made about 4 servings, which were more like pudding than mousse, but very yummy nonetheless. Very rich and chocolatey, but I think next time I'll get a beater and see how it turns out. Oh, and I decided to freeze the extra cream/vanilla mixture that wasn't added to the chocolate, and now I've got vanilla ice cream.
