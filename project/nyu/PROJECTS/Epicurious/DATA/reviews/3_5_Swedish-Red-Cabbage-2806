This is the second year I have made this for Christmas Eve dinner and everyone always loves it. Even had a recipe request!

This was good! I prepared it according to the recipe, but when I tasted it I thought it was too sweet, so I ended up adding extra vinegar to balance it. Next time I would use half the sugar. This was my contribution to a Swedish smorgasbord, and it got rave reviews.

This is exactly what I wanted from a red cabbage recipe. I didn't have apples and used strawberry instead of currant jelly since that's what I had. Even without those, it was wonderful.

I did this with raspberry vinegar. It was wonderful with cassoulet to cut the fat of that dish. Everyone loved it.

This dish is great with any special occasion "big meal". Followed recipe, with one less apple. Other jelly can be substituted.

Made this for a BBQ to be used cold on top of turkey burgers and hot dogs/brats. I found it needed extra sour notes, and added at least a 1/4 of red wine vinegar. Brought great color to the event. Enjoyed be all of the cabbage fans, maybe persuaded a few people too.

Fantastic dish and very easy to prepare if you have a good mandoline that makes shredding the cabbage easier. I make this all the time as a side for pork and lamb dishes. I don't like my cabbage too sweet, so I omit the brown sugar and substitute the currant jelly with dried cranberries. I also use fresh lemon juice and cider vinegar interchangeably - whatever is handy. Lemon juice also preserves the great color of the cabbage better.

My husband & I loved it! Didn't have red currant jelly, substituted a different flavor, came out great.

This was delicious but definitely on the sweet side. It's the perfect accompaniment to roasted or grilled pork tenderloin or pork chops. Yum.

Wow! What wonderful flavors. Best red cabbage I've ever had. Reduced cloves to 1/8 teaspoon. And, one apple, which was grated. My husband flipped over this recipe. Served it along side corn beef that was simmered in a Guiness stout for 2 hours. Definitely will make this again!

This was outstanding. My Danish mother who makes her version every year, actually all year round, even liked it. She wouldn't say it was better that hers. . .but it was!! (Dad said so !!) Try it you'll love it!

The best red cabbage recipe I have used. I have made it with different kinds of preserves if I didn't have currant - all were superb. Is wonderful reheated if there are any leftovers.

I have been preparing this dish every holiday season since its introduction - it's easy and is the perfect balance between sweet and savory - my family LOVES it. Beautiful addition of color to the table as well!

Surprisingly good...made with Sauerbraten, excellent match. Reduce cloves a bit.

Made this for Xmas Eve dinner and it was such a hit that the hostess kept the leftovers for herself. Normally you try to get rid of the leftovers! Very easy from start to finish and flavorful (tart and sweet) without being overpowering...I would happily make it again, even for everyday. Goes great with ham, sausages or even goose, as we had it. I could see it with pork chops or loin, too.

I miss my German Grandmothers cooking and tried this recipe. It was good, and easy I'm a little undecided on how well I like it perhaps because I had to use rice wine vinigar instead of cider (didn't have it on hand) and the current jam I had had 2 other fruits combined. I liked the sweet and sour taste it had, I may make it again, not sure. Perhaps it will be better tomorrow and surrounded by other German dishes...who knows

Great dish. I also used apricot preserves instead of currant. This was crunchy and wonderful, and went well with a butternut squash lasagne (from this site also.) Yumm!

I served this with brisket and it was delicious! I didn't have blackberry preserves but apricot worked just as well. Also, I cooked it longer than directed because I prefer a softer texture and I think it only improved it. Next time I might add a little less clove.

I have tried numerous recipes for red cabbage but found this one outstanding! I am of Danish ancestry and am used to the caraway seed in many cabbage recipes. However, not many like the pungent flavour. The red current jelly/jam puts a perfect finishing touch on this crwod pleaser. Several of my friends want it now .Thanks a lot,Epicurious!

Cooked cabbage has never been a favorite, but after having prepared this recipe, my mind has changed. This dish was a perfect addition to a speciality sausage dinner. Agree with the reviewer about the finely shredded cabbage and decreased cooking time. Quite tasty!

Very yummy. I used red apple, subsituted rice vinegar for cider vinegar (and used a bit extra), and ommitted the jelly -- and it all turned out great. The leftovers froze well.

This is an excellent red cabbage recipe.We used 1/2 of a red cabbage. Our cabbage was finely shredded rather than coarsely shredded . This may account for the reduced cooking time and temperature needed to wilt and later steam the cabbage. 5 minutes of wilting time at medium heat was adequate.I steamed it for 8 minutes but could proibably have reduced it to 6 minutes.Nonetheless, the results were fantastic!

Excellent version of red cabbage. Even pleased my husband, who is not usually a cabbage fan. Great with pork loin, and nice for comnpany as it can be entirely made ahead of time. It reheated just fine.

A hit with the members of the family who liked red cabbage (myself included). Did not change the minds of those who did not.
