I made these the Friday night I don't want to be in the kitchen way - I used canned black beans that I mashed with a fork, cooked the pepper, onion, jalapeno, and garlic per recipe, mixed it all together and fried according to the recipe. I served them with a chipolte salsa - they were great!!!!!!!

I'm an open-minded and non-finicky bachelor-cook. When I ran out of sugar and put grape jelly in my coffee, I thought it was ok. This dish was gross.

I've made this a couple of times and love it. It's surprisingly easy to make and delicious. Plan on making about 4-5 cakes per person or less. They are very filling.

Sooo good. Very sweet and the perfect accompaniment to spicy Mexican food.

excellent and low-fat! eplace jalapeno with a habanero if you like it REALLY HOT!

This was a great and easy recipe. It needs no extra spice and took only short period of time to make. They were also good the next day when I reheated them.
