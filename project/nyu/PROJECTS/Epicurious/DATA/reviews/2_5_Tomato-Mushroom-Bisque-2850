I roasted tomatoes, a red bell pepper and a pasilla pepper on the grill until black, then peeled off the black skins. I roasted garlic and onions in the oven first. Then, I put all of that in the pot with the leek mixture. Great for a smoky taste. I think next time I will strain it, then return it to the pot and add cream and lemon at the end.

I have made this a number of times and I love this recipe. I think the trick is to ensure you stick to the proportions of the aromatics. I made it once with some green parts of the leeks (thinking I would not be wasteful) -- and although it tasted okay, it looked horrible color-wise! So go easy on the aromatics. When it is not tomato-season, try canned whole tomatoes. They have more flavor than off-season tomatoes. Also, dried and re-hydrated Chinese shiitakes are excellent in the flavor department!

I eliminated the tomatoes and added fresh lump crab meat. In reality it became a mushroom -crab bisque. Incidently, this was the bisque that I was orginally looking for and the swap made the dish outstandintg.

Cook from New York gave a great suggestion (using a mushroom stock) and it saves the recipe from being an average tomato soup (I love tomato soup but this IS supposed to be both!) Another idea also is to use dried powdered mushrooms in addition.

I added 1/4 tsp of dried dill to the receipe which was a nice complement to the tomato flavor. It goes well with a dark crusty bread. My next try will be to balance the ingredients to make it thicker.

To me, a bisque is *rich* and imparts the principal flavors of the recipe. This recipe is not as rich as other bisques I've enjoyed and the mushroom flavor is deficient. This is a tomato soup, and the recipe lacks a balance between the tomato and mushroom flavors. I made one substitution to the recipe since we are a vegetarian household. I substituted Annie Somerville's "Mushroom Stock" recipe which can be found in the Epicurious database.

This is a great cold day soup. It is rich and creamy. I added some fresh spinich just before serving for and added zing! I would use this one over and over again! (Yummy with warm bread)
