My supermarket was out of Thai jasmine so I had to use brown jasmine. Worked fine with the variation in rice. Nice and fluffy.

This is the first time, and every time since, that rice has come out absolutely perfect. Perfect. Worth saying twice.

This jasmine rice is fantastic! It's so much more softer and better than regular rice! I make this rice everyday. Now, when I eat regular long grain rice, it tastes awful and grainy! This is the best rice in the world!
