Yum! Grilling the mushrooms imparts a wonderful smoky flavor, and removes excess liquid. Because I'm lazy (and cheap) I used a mix of portobello mushrooms and standard button mushrooms, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter the first time. I've made it twice since--it's great warm but actually improves over a day or two in the fridge. You can make a ton of the mushrooms as a side dish, then save the leftover mushrooms and make the salsa for another dinner. Be sure to grill the mushrooms thoroughly to concentrate their flavor--the bigger they are, the slower the heat you want. I thought the oil mixture was a little skimpy; I make half again or twice as much to have enough to dress the finished salsa. Crushing the garlic in a garlic is much faster than soaking garlic slices, and the crushed garlic doesn't burn on the grill. don't be shy with the black pepper--it's the bite of the arugula and black pepper that compliment the nice meaty mushroom pieces.
