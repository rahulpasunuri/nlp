My family liked the fresh taste, but, it was not what I anticipated.

These are very good and attractive sundaes. A nice desert for a July 4th party as they are red, white, and blue. Simple to make.

This is such a simple easy dessert for our hot summers! Pretty in parfait glasses with a sprig of mint. Refreshing and nice after barbeque.
