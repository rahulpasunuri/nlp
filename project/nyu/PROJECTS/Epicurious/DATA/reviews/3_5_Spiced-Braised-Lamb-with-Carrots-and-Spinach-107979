Delicious!

Delicious, especially if you add a cinnamon stick to the braise. Make extra or there won't be any leftovers!

Enjoyed it very much.

Not bad but a very mediocre recipe. I could have easily made it up myself. There are much more interesting lamb stew recipes on this site.

BLAND! I am eating the buttered egg noodles I served with it because they have more flavor! I usually agree with the general comments but I have to disagree this time. Waste of time!

This was a big hit for a second night seder. Everyone enjoyed it and I will make again after Passover. Just a note, the butcher gave me bones to the lamb shoulder. I browned two of them and added them to the stew while it was braising.

Good could be great. Made two patches, in one I added 1 cinnamon stick and little more cumin and garlic. Much better. New e-mail geraldbarron@gerald barron.com

I made this for our seder nite. A big hit. And a nice change from the usual ho-hum turkey/brisket fare. I also made the scallion pancakes --- a really fun addition. I think I would add additional carrots next time because we really love them and after the Passover holiday, I would serve it with rice. For us, it was spiced just right -- not too hot, not too powerful, just flavorful. Thanks Gourmet!

It sounded so good that I couldn't even wait until Passover to try it. It improved in flavor each day. If I did it again, I would either toast the spices, or add some additional spices to make the flavor more assertive. I also added more carrots since my family loves them.

I made this recipe for my seder this year. It was easy and delicious, guests raved. Definitely make ahead and reheat, adding spinach. (I used only about 3/4 of spinach) Also, I toasted cumin and coriander seeds, then ground them with a mortar and pestle. Makes a big difference. Served it with the matzoh scallion pancakes. Next time I would up the spices a little, maybe add some crushed red pepper for "heat".
