This is a delicious tasting tartar sauce. The recipe is perfect as is, although I decided to add 2-teaspoons of honey to cut the tartness just a bit. But, either way the sauce is a keeper!

Truly, truly excellent. One member of our household does not eat onions so I thought I'd never find a tartar sauce recipe for all of us. Omitted the green onions...and it's still excellent. THANK YOU.

5 Star Excellent. Best I ever had.

This is my "go to" recipe for Tartar Sauce. Better than anything I can buy. As for refrigerator life, I find it keeps for at least three weeks when I use my wife's homemade mayo.

Anyone know the refrigerator shelf life of this? I love to have tartar sausce on hand in the fridge, but don't know how long it would keep with fresh green onion and parsley.

I use Epicurious.com weekly but have never left a review until now. This tartar sauce is perfect! I was skeptical due to the amount of ingredients and because there were no onions but after reading the reviews and the fact that no one had alterations I gave it a try. I am so glad I did, I will never buy tartar sauce again! I did, however, omit the capers because I did not have any on hand and I added dill weed, simply because I like it.

Have made this too many times to mention...it is my go to recipe. Store bought tartar sauce doesn't have a place in our fridge any longer. It is requested by my husband and 4 year old twins whenever we eat fish!

This recipe is perfect as written. Super good on crab cake sliders (with toasted buns). Yum!

This recipe is absolutely perfect; there is no need to change anything. Those who tried it raved about it. As the recipe states, it should be made at least an hour before serving it so that the flavors can blend together. This is now my standard recipe for tartar sauce.

This is now my "go to" tartar sauce recipe. Delicious flavor - love the fresh herbs. Used Sriracha for the hot sauce, and it was fantastic!

Absolutely delicious! I lightly chopped the capers so that they'd be similar in size to the rest of the ingredients in the tartar sauce. We dipped fried fish, cold shrimp, and french fries in it. So good!

I was skeptical when I first read this. It look like too much. The only thing I changed was 1 more tablespoon of pickles. It's a great recipe!

This is the best!

Forget the fish...give me a spoon! I use it on artichokes and asparagus or as a dip with cold cooked jumbo shrimp. I don't use the green onion because it over powers the delicate flavor of the capers. Nor do I add the parsley, for me, it is a texture matter. If I could get away with it, I would take it to my favorite fish & chips spot, and forget the bottled lame sauce they use...

Simple and delicious! I made fried fish and didn't think about having tartar sauce on the side. When my husband asked for it we simply looked up this recipe and made it in no time. Delicious!

So much better than anything you can buy in a jar. I made this with homemade mayonnaise and it was really delicious. My go-to recipe from now on.

This tartar sauce is the best I've ever had. I didn't change a thing, which I can't say for many of the recipes I try in here; a little tweak here and there usually makes a nice enhancement. This is exactly how I expect a great tartar sauce to taste without changing anything!

Rating: 4
This is the best tartar sauce EVER! Better than I've had in pubs and upscale bistros. Now I won't be able to order fish and chips in a restaurant, for fear of inferior tartar sauce. Unless, of course, I bring my own! Oh, and the tarragon is a must.

This recipe is excellent: it's quick and delicious and you probably have all of the ingredients on hand. There's no reason to use purchased tartar sauce again! My only change was that I used low fat mayo. Excellent with crab cakes!

Rating: 4
Outstanding - but I skip the tarragon (not a fan) and do a 1/2 teaspoon of hot pepper sauce and only 1/4 worcestershire.

my husband is a tartar sauce junkie! he must have with everything! i make this recipe with 1/2 c light mayo and 1/2 cup plain nonfat yogurt. he has no idea that he is eating the half fat version... it is delicious! i add extra lemon juice and cayenne instead of pepper sauce; and leave out the tarragon. finally a yummy, and somewhat healthy tartar sauce.

I hate sweet pickle relish so I don't like most tartar sauces. I LOVE this one. We've had a few fish & chip parties, and people end up scooping this sauce up with their fries as well as their fish. I've also had thank you notes begging me for the recipe, it is that tasty.

I used this with a tweaked version of fish skewers with tarragon vinaigrette (BA July 2004). Scallops and sea bass were wonderful, and so was the tartar sauce!

This recipe for Tartar Sauce is so good I am considering NOT making it again. I have made it three times and everytime the sauce has gotten higher compliments than the fish it was served with. It is by far the best recipe for Tartar Sauce you can find. Everyone who has tasted it agrees. My only recommendations are to make it a day ahead, store it in the fridge and let it come close to room temp before serving and to follow the recipe to the letter.

Great Recipe for a Tartar sauce! It tastes very similar to the restaurant Houstons "Chef's sauce" - another name for their tartar sauce which is EXACTLY what I was looking to replicate! Extremely happy with this recipe :)

Seriously the best tartar sauce I've tasted and I'm picky about recipes! I didn't use parsley or hot sauce and found it still excellent. I found the longer it sits the better, and the flavour infuses as it warms up to room temperature...PERFECT!!

100% perfect, hands-down best tartar sauce ever.

Nice homemade sauce. Before you comment, you should know that the brand of mayonnaise you use makes a difference to the outcome.

Make sure to use a blender to better incorporate the ingredients. Also needed to add a little dill juice to make a bit thinner.

Ok, so I didn't exactly follow the recipe. I had the mayo,parsley,lemon juice,dijon,worcestershire,hot pepper and used dried dill and just threw together without measuring. My family loved it, even the child who didn't even like tartar sauce to start with.

Neither myself nor my family liked this recipe, and they asked if I would not make it again. My old standby of mayo, mustard, and dill pickle relish is much better!

After all the reviews I expected more. Followed the recipe to a 'T'. None of us were thrilled. Fairly bland and unspectacular. Where is a good recipe for classic tartar sauce? The jarred stuff is all yuck....!

Hands down, the best tartar sauce ever! If you want to add a little spice, try 1/2 teaspoon minced jalapeno, or 1/4 teaspoon chipotle pepper - yummy!

Luscious stuff! There is a restaurant about two hours from here where I order the fish and chips just to get the tartar sauce, which they make themselves. Repeated attempts to secure the recipe have been good-naturedly declined. Now I have my own recipe, and it's even better! I serve this tartar sauce on halibut that a local guy flies in from the Gulf of Alaska and we grill, and on small-mouth bass that we catch from the Snake River and pan fry. My husband eats it on French fries when I make them for him. I changed nothing about the recipe, nor will I (especially the dill pickles vs. sweet: The sour is the point!). It's a new standard in our house. Thank you!

Love this recipe, we make it with the Chili-seasoned fish sticks. I've used sweet pickle relish instead of dill pickle and it's still good. It does make a nice base for tuna salad the next day (but too sweet then if you used the sweet pickle relish.)

Rating: 4
Excellent! Tastes great with fried fish. I'm thinking of trying this sauce as a base for tuna salad or offering it along with cocktail sauce next time we have shrimp. Some of the leftover sauce from last night will be on my roast beef sandwich for lunch today.

This recipe saved my haliBUTT! The party had begun and I had no sauce for the main dish. It was quick, easy and most of all TASTY! I am sure it will benefit from overnight blending though. I won't be going back to the bottle again.

Outstanding with fish and even can be used with chips as a dip. Indeed, I cut the stalks from broccoli, peeled the hard outer sides and got raves as a vegetable dip. Once you've tried it you'll never buy the prepared type again.

Nice blend of flavors; served with grilled salmon and it was delicious. Used a good tablespoon of fresh tarragon from the herb garden in place of dry and it was really nice!

Where as I am used to the old drab recipes for tarter sauce, I thought that I would try this one. I tried it with fried clams and fried haddock and it is the best tasting tarter sauce that I have ever had..
