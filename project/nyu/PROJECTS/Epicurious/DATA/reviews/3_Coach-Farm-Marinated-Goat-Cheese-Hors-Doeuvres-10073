Great tip from other reviewer on using the prepared goat cheese logs. This was a great recipe, and well received by my guests. I should have made more (recipe only makes 6). I cut up the sun-dried tomatoes into smaller pieces before putting them on the bread, which made it much easier to eat.

You can use the seasoned goat cheese logs readily available in the store instead of buttons. It was interesting and spicy and works well for stand up functions with a light red wine.
