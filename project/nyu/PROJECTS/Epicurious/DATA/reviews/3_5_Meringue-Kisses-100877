I've made this recipe twice. It's easy to make, and turns out excellent. The only thing I had to change was the baking time. It takes at least twice as long to completely dry out as stated in the recipe. Don't be afraid to leave them in the oven until they are crunchy. Leaving them in the oven overnight did not work for me.

DOWN HERE IN TEXAS WE CALL THESE "FORGOTTEN COOKIES" YOU'LL SEE WHY. PREHEAT OVEN TO 350 DEGREES. PUT THE COOKIES IN THE OVEN AND TURN OFF. LEAVE OVERNIGHT. WE ALSO ADD CHOCOLATE CHIPS AND PECANS...LOTS OF THEM. MY TEN YEAR OLD GRAND DAUGHTER IS LEARNING TO COOK. WE GAVE SEVERAL BATCHES FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS, INCLUDING TO MY SISTER IN TOKYO AND MY SON AT LUKE AFB IN PHEONIX. THE COOKIES STAYED CRISP EVEN ON THEIR LONG JOURNEY.

It's like the adult version of Lucky Charms. Might as well just eat sugar from the bag.

This is a great recipe. I made them on new years eve and they turneed out great. i tried to make them before with natural cane sugar but they did not work out. even though they take a while, the end result is pleasing because they turn from soft mushy meringues to nice crispy ones in a matter of an hour. They work the best if you follow the recipe pretty exact and next time I thyink that I will add some mint extract or cocoa powder. I will definetly make them again.

Don't make these on a humid day or you will have chewy kisses! Let them dry until the oven is cold. I made them on parchment paper which was floured. Make sure to store them in an air tight container or they will be chewy! Here's a tip - make them huge. Just before serving hollow out from the bottom and squirt whipped cream into them. Set them on a plate with the lemon curd and a few raspberries and dust with powdered sugar.

THIS WAS A GREAT RECIPE!!!!!!!!!! I WOULD LOVE TO MAKE THIS AGAIN. I brought them to school for at lunch and I could only eat a few 'cause everyone was asking me for them. Just one thing to remember that this recipe does not say; LEAVE THE EGGS AT ROOM TEMPATURE!!!

I always cook these for at least two hours and ten minutues. My husband loves these cookies. I've added almond or maple flavoring, almond flavoring with toasted almonds, just about anything will go. Today I added vanilla extract, chopped dark chocolate and a little cinnamon for mexican chocolate meringues. They are a little more substantial than a traditional meringue, but they are so delicious!

I made some changes. I had 4 whites and used 2/3 cup of sugar. You have to make sure you beat the whites until very stiff and glossy! If they don't set up, it's probably too humid outside or you have gotten some fat from the yolk into the whites. I baked at 300 for 15 min. then 250 for 15 and left in the oven to cool. Unbelievably delicious with 1/2 cup of white cocolate chips added. Also added a little mint flavoring.

I have my doubts wether I would make this recipe again or not. I have followed the tip of a reviewer for this recipe and they still came out far too chewy. They could not be easier to make, but when it comes to eating them, feels like you have 10 pieces of bubble gum in your mouth. I would cook them for an hour at 200 and leave them with the oven turned off for 45 minutes. Unless you like them really!! chewy.. follow evertthing as it is.

Easy and good. As per suggestion, I added a few drops of rose flavoring to the last few cookies - what a nice addition for a change of pace. Also baked for a little more than an hour and let sit overnight in the oven - they were perfect in the morning. I have store bought lemon curd in the cupboard which I'll try on the plain ones.

This recipe is, by far, one of the greatest things to make ESPECIALLY for kids. I have made them over 10 times now & each time have turned out perfectly. I have even added various extracts and food colorings for fun -- they're awesome!

I've always been afraid to make this because all other recipies called for stove top cooking. Baking in oven was so easy! I read other reviews and added 1/8 tsp of cream of tartar and cooked for 60 minues (vs. 45). I baked two batches in a row, and the first turned out better -- it was stiffer (beaten longer). I also added 3/4 tsp. of strawberry flavor (which gave it a hint of strawberry and a nice pinkish tint) and about 1/2 cup of mini semi-sweet morsels! YUM!

I make these at least once a month and after reading other recipes, I now bake them at 200 degrees for two (2) hours, then turn off the oven and let them sit for another hour (in the oven). My other suggestion, is to never make them on a rainy day, when the humidity level is higher then normal, they just can't dry out properly!

I made the Kisses as per the directions but they didn't taste as sweet as I've had them in bakeries. Also, the baking time and drying time are inaccurate...needs to be longer because they were still chewy. I won't make this recipie again, but will be trying other variations of it.

I love this recipe, so crunchy and sweet. What make it is enjoyable to make is that everybody loves it. I, definitely, am going to make these kisses again.

My kids loved the meringue kisses. I added 1/8 tsp. cream of tartar to stabilize the meringue. The cooking time/drying time was insufficient, they were still too chewy (that did not deter my son from eating one) so I repeated the cooking/drying time all over again. Delicious and light. My daughter says they taste like cotton candy.

I added about a teaspoon of rose syrup to make rose-flavored kisses. Wonderful! You've got to cook them thoroughly or they don't dry out enough (which just makes them a little sticky -- not bad).

My kids wouldn't even eat them. Very disappointed after reading all these great reviews!

Okay, so i haven't tried this exact recipe above, but if you want a "knock your socks off cookie" try adding a little green food coloring, mint extract, and milk chocolate chips. (or semi sweet depending on your preference)...it's always been my favorite. it helps if you like mint chocolate chip ice cream too!

I made one batch for a party. They turned out so lovely and were so easy to make, that I turned around and made another. I also made some lemon curd (from a different recipe). It was a delicious combination, and people had fun dipping their dessert.

Not only was it easy, it tasted wonderful! I used a little less sugar than was stated and added chopped pecans and hazelnuts. What a great dessert to make for dinner parties and holiday fare. My boyfriend was very worried about the sweetness of it, but even he was surprised at how light and tasty they were. Great recipe!

Simple. . . straight forward . . . easy. Be sure to leave enough time to let them stay in the oven for that hour. Do this a day ahead of time, actually. And the Lemon Curd was divine.

Melt in the mouth! Try adding mini chocolate chips or mini M&M's for extra decadence!
