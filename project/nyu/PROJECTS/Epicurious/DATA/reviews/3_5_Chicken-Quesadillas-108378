I used chicken tenders that I grilled in our George Foreman grill & Mexican blend cheese & it was AWESOME! Great recipe, quick, easy & tasty. It has already become a favorite...I'm making it for game day today!!! Thank you

I'm generally not a fan of recipes that ask you to buy more than 1 premade ingredients, cause I feel like, I could have figuered that out myself. I Loved this recipe, eventhough it includes premade chicken. It was only 1 premade item, and made it rather quick fix, and the taste was really good. Will definitely make it again. :)

Very tasty! Instead of a rotisserie chicken, I cooked a couple of boneless skinless chicken breasts in a skillet and sliced them up prior to cooking the onion. Additionally, instead of grilling the quesadillas, I baked them for about 10-15 minutes in the oven at 350. The garlic and onion give these quesadillas an amazing taste. Super easy as well!

I added red bell pepper slices to the onion mix. Also added sliced mushrooms with the chicken. I used mexican 'quesadilla' cheese with jalapeno (available since I live in TX). It melts much better, and tastes better, too. Cooked them on my comal (flat cast iron skillet), and used a pot to keep them flat, like earlier review suggested. These were really very good. Not gourmet, but certainly worthy comfort food.

I love easy recipes and this one was one of them. I also used whole wheat tortillas and grilled the quesadillas in my panini maker. Add significant amount of chicken(or other ingredients) to the tortilla; otherwise it'll be too bready.

Tasted great! Used mushrooms and onions - skipped the garlic. Served with red beans & rice as a nice side. Great way to use leftover chicken that usually goes to the dog!

Made this for Super Bowl watching. I caramelized the onion and garlic deglazing the pan with white balsamic vinegar as I went along until it was a rich brown color and liberally seasoned with black pepper. Mixed it into the chicken mixture. I smeared some refried black beans on the tortilla as well. Awesome flavor.

Even the best cooks need a simple dish now and then. These quesadillas are delicious. I added 2 1/2 tsp. chili powder, 1 tsp. oregano and mushrooms. They were nice paired with Gazpacho.

LOL, okay it's simple but that's the beauty of it. I won't criticize. For the snobs, try the quail with pomegranate sauce. Equally easy, but isn't PB&J either!

To the cook from California, I for one am happy when a simple recipe is included -- saves me from writing it out for my kids and husband. You know, you gotta start someplace! Not everyone is born an experienced chef!

How is this a recipe of the day? This is the easiest thing to make, nobody needs a recipe. Is epicurious going to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich next?

This was bland. I plan to try again, however, adding Mexican seasoning, chopped marinated jalapenos, and pepper jack cheese. I think that will help.

I thought this was good. We used grilled chicken which gave it a bit of extra flavor. Definitely needs the salt called for. This is one of those dishes that you can make with a variety of ingredients, whatever sounds good or is on hand. A good use for leftover chicken.

Pretty good, but sure needed some extra punch-like chopped chilis and some sauteed yellow or red peppers. I used whole wheat tortillas and sprayed pan with cooking spray instead of oil. If using whole wheat use a little extra care and time to get them to crisp up.

Loved it! Cooked my own chicken breasts with seasoning. Otherwise followed exactly. Used Mexican melting queso. Easy and tasty. Served with sour cream and bottled salsa.

These were excellent! I used pan-fried boneless chicken breast (seasoned w/salt & pepper) in lieu of rotisserie chicken; in same pan I sauteed mushrooms, minced serrano chile and the onions/garlic. Used Colby-Jack cheese. Fantastic!

I got the usual eye rolls when the kids heard I wasn't making something new for dinner, but once they tried them they loved them. I then served the quesadillas at a party and the adults loved them too. I buy the pre-cooked, pre-sliced chicken which makes this recipe even easier.

I had never made quesadilla's before because I never was crazy about restaurant versions. My son asked me to make some. They were delicious and easy. The addition of canned sliced black olives, sliced fresh jalapeno and fresh cilantro was good -- would be nice with a bit of cumin mixed in with filling. They made a nice dinner with home-made guacemole, nachos and salsa.

great easy dish, appitiezer, main course, or late night snack. I use bonesless skinless chicken breastcut into thin strips. red pepper is very popular, this reciepe is great with 1 whole red pepper sauteed with the onion. ripe tomatoes, canned or salsa isalso great to throw in.

I made these for a party I was throwing, and they were delicious. My guests thought so too. A word of caution: they enjoyed the quesadillas so much that when I ran out of rotisserie chicken, things got a little out of hand. Hot oil was splashed at me; griddle pans were brought down hard on my skull. Eventually I was able to fight my way through the angry throng of guests and run out into the street, where a neighbor rescued me. All in all, a great recipe.

This is quick and easy to make and my picky family liked it! I will certainly make this again.

I've been making a version of this rotisserie chicken dish for a couple of years. I add a jar of Ortega Salsa to the chicken mix as it cooks (blue cap in a canning jar). It adds a nice bit of spice to the chicken (2 chickens). When you remove the quesadillas from the skillet spread them out on a cake/cookie cooling rack to keep them from getting soggy. These make a great dinner or a quick breakfast-in-hand. Much better than anything you can buy commercially.

This was great, some easy substitutions, for seasoning, beyond garlic/onion, I also used shipotle taco seasoning,also bought corn and black bean salsa, served chips with mexicali, had classic Margarita's and for dessert watched Desperado and had Margarita cake.. perfect evening

This recipe was certainly delicious and very easy to make. However, I did make chicken quesadillas last summer using a different recipe, and I liked that one better. If you like avocado I highly recommend adding it. It's a great complement to the chicken and cheese.

I've never made quesadillas before, but compared to all the quesadillas I've ever had elsewhere, theses were, well, beyond compare. They go great served with the top rated 'CHARRED TOMATILLO GUACAMOLE' found here on epicurious.com. I do not own a grill pan but our infrared Wolf grill on the range did the job in record time (30 seconds or less total per quesadilla). They were crispy and delicious! 10 out of 10!!

WOW! That dish was awesome and simple enough for anyone to get right. I'm a 21yo male who's basically scared of the kitchen. I've only made about 2 dinners in my life but I thought I'd give this a go because it sounded so tasty. I made a few changes though. Firstly I used two large chicken breast fillets and seasoned them with salt, pepper and cummin while on the pan. Then I sliced them up roughly into diagonal strips. I also used 1 large green bell pepper, adding it to the onions with the garlic so they stayed nice and crispy. Lastly I substituted in mozzarella cheese and sprinkled some extra on top of the mixture before cooking. The textures of the crispy tortilla, melted cheese, tender chicken and fresh capsicum merged together so well. It was like gourmet food...I can't believe I cooked it! My family is shocked.

At my house we make this all the time, and it is my favorite quesadilla recipe. It is simple, quick and tasty. Adding peppers gives it a nice kick if you like spicy. I have made this with oven-baked chicken and rotisserie chicken and rotisserie is much better. A keeper!

GREAT recipe. So easy. My kids say it's their favorite quesadilla recipe ever! I too added cumin for a nice kick. Also finely chopped the onion and minced the garlic so that the kids could not detect it! For easier/healthier preparation, I cooked on my grilling machine for three minutes. This browned and crisped both sides nicely and there was no need to use oil.

A simple, delicious, quick supper. The store-bought roast chicken makes it even easier. Have also used leftover cooked chicken or even turkey with equally good results.

Love quesas! I always add Herdez roasted green chile peppers to the onions (last 2 min), and stir in cumin and chile powder (red or green) with the garlic. I make in flat pan, sprayed with cooking oil, and don't fold over til tortilla is brown on both sides. Have also made big batches in oven on sprayed cookie sheet 350. Crab, spinach, red onion, pepper jack is a great combo. Just about anything works. Guacamole, salsa, and sour cream on side.

I appreciate the tip about using pre-roasted chicken. These make for great party food - hand-held, quick to make up in just a few minutes after the guests start clamoring for more.

This recipe was quite tasty and easy to make. My guests loved it.

Tasty! I used a regular pan and it was fine. Add cumin to the onions as they cook. Instead of rotisserie chicken. I made two chicken breasts sprinkled with Cajun spice and then ripped it up and added it to the mixture. Just as others said, it's important to press down on the surface of the quesadilla as you cook it. A good simple meal.

This is a great basic quesadilla recipe. I could not find rottiserie chicken so I marinated 2 chicken breasts in Italian dressing for a couple of hours, grilled them, and shredded. I also used a combo of Cheddar and Montrey Jack cheese and added one chopped jalapeno pepper. This is a pretty easy recipe that is sure to please.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Picked up a plain rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, already had burrito wrappers leftover from another dish. Cooked sliced sweet onion on the stove in some margerine until it caramelized for my quesadillas and used hot peppers in my boyfriend's. I also used non-stick spray instead of oil and didn't add any salt to anything. Served with light sour cream and salsa. It was pretty simple and boyfriend loved it.

A new favorite. Made as specified except for salt added to chicken. Rarely use specified oil but seemed impt for moist filling. Did use pepper jack cheese which has a kick though was mellowed by the chicken and tortilla. Cooked in regular saute pan, was impt to press firmly while cheese melting to hold together. Made and ahead and then reheated/sliced for serving as an appetizer. Next time, esp if for main dish, will use higher proportion filling:tortilla, will also try sauteeing other vegetables to bulk up on fiber, nutrition.

My guests and I all loved this. If you use the cooked rotisserie chicken like called for and cook up the onions real well, add a decent amount of Black pepper and salt, they are delicious. Get the rotisserie chicken, the pre-cooked ones you can usually buy at some grocery store, they are great. Take it off the bones and shred it up. I cooked them on the grill after I put the tortillas together. Brushed each with a little melted butter so they would not stick to grill.

Make it easier by putting the ingrediants on one tortilla and placing another tortilla on top. Once it's browned, cut it pizza style. Less filling falls out when you flip it and the tortilla is less likely to split. You can make them in a regular skillet, just use enough oil to brown the tortillas without getting too much oil inside. I make quesadillas as often as most folks make grilled cheese sandwiches. The kids like just cheese, we love cheese and raw onion, and it's a great way to use leftover steak seasoned fajita-style or chicken as in this recipe. Home-made tomatilla sauce, guacamole, sour cream.... yummmmm

Added sauted Birdseye Frozen Stirfry Peppers to chicken and used Tostito Salsa Con Queso. Grilled quesidilla on George Foreman. Worked great

I have made this recipe many times, except I marinate chicken breast on italian dressing for a couple of days and then grill it. Then, to make the quesadillas, I add what ever veggies I have to the chicken and cheese or make them plain for my children and they love it.

Simple recipe, but definately needed some spicing up. I tossed the chicken with some fresh lime juice, some cumin and chili powder (like the previous reviewer). Use this recipe as the basis and add your own flare, you can't go wrong.

Bland. Added cumin and chilipowder, and that way it was d-licious!
