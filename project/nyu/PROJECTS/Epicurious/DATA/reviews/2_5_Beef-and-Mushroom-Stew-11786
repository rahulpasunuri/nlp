made this with sirloin and portabellas. as per other reviewers, i added some garlic. however, this was bland bland bland. though it's pretty easy, skip this one for a better beef stew.

Key here is you have to use Sirloin. I used regular "Stew beef," and it took 2.5 hors to soften it up. As an ex-vegetarian I don't know from cuts of beef.

Seriously. If you don't like the ingrediants, chances are you won't like the result.

I also added a tablespoon of tomato paste, a ton of garlic and carrots and a couple of potatoes. Really delicious over whole wheat pasta.

all you need to add is garlic, fresh thyme and let it simmer for a bit longer and this is simple and delicious.

I'm from Brooklyn Heights, NY, also and I liked this recipe very much. For those who dislike beef: rather than be so negative about other people's palates, try a recipe with ingredients you do enjoy. Signed, Francesca

I liked this recipe, the person I made it for loved it. I wished I had done a little more to the egg noodles. they were the only bland thing in the whole recipe, but that was my fault. I will definitely fix this again!

This stew was a disappointment. To me a stew should have a thick & hearty gravy-this was watery until I added a flour/water mixture to it. Also, it lacked in flavor. I probably would not make it again.

This stew recipe was great because it could be made quickly. I doubled it and added additional red wine. Also I used orzo instead of egg noodles.

I made this stew and it was great. I added some potatos, baby carrots and celery though, but it turned out really good. It was easy and fast too. I will definitely make this again.

not rating- Do yourselves a favor, buy the BEEF STEW IN A BAG!! Spice up the sauce that you add- as needed (to taste), add button mushrooms (halved),baby carrots, a few sliced onions, some thick chopped celery and some diced potatoes! Salt ,pepper etc.. . GARLIC (fresh chopped, or powder). Yum & easy!

This is a great weeknight recipe, it's quick and doesn't take a lot of clean-up. I followed some of the previous suggestions and added garlic and seasonings, as well as thickened the sauce at the end, but overall a great dish.

I thought that this was a very good stew, although a clove of garlic would add some flavor. I found it to be easy and fast.

OK, sounded interesting - but too bland - added some minced garlic to give it more flavor - but, really, not a noteworthy recipe.

Two recommendations: 1)use a better cut of meat, 2) season the beef after adding the lemon juice, but before adding flour. You may also need to thicken at the end using a corn starch slurry.

This is delish! The lemon marinade in the beef adds a real zest to this dish... Dont try to substitute beef broth for the consomme' ! Stick to the recipe and you will not be disappointed! This is one of my wife's favorites that I have brought home from this site..
