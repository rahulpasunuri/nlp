This was pretty uninspiring, I thought. Never used purslane before but not motivated to purchase it again (and, yes, I did have to buy it; none of my neighbors here in central NJ seem to have a surplus in their garden!). I thought that the dressing lacked zing and was uninteresting. I grill zucchini all the time, but have never used it in a salad before and did enjoy that aspect of the dish.

It's curious that this recipie has such a good rating when only a few reviewers used purslane. This is a good pretext to eat a vegie that's actually pretty bland. I used lime juice, 1/2 portion, and 1/4 portion of lime rind, red onion instead of shallot and !/2 grated garlic clove. It was quite good, but of course the basil would be an added plus. I never had eaten raw purslane before, and find the lime & garlic perk it up nicely.

This was a very good and easy summer salad. I didn't have any purslane so I used basil instead and it turned out great.

This recipe was super easy to make and had very refreshing and summery flavours. I substituted arugula for the purslane, as I couldn't find any on short notice. The entire dinner party of 6 polished off a big bowl of this salad, so I'll definitely be making it again - especially in the summer when zucchini are best

Very quick and easy. Because of the tomato scare, I used strawberries instead of tomatoes. I served it alongside fish but I think it would also make a good steakhouse salad. This was my first time using purslane, and if you haven't had it before, it tastes like a cross between arugula and spinach. I've read recommendations that purslane can be prepared like spinach, which is how I got the idea to use strawberries in the salad.

Purslane is rare but when you find it at the farmer's market, buy it and use it. It's a nice diversion from the regular leaf salads plus the added benefit of omega 3 fatty acids. This was easy, delicious and healthy.

I don't know where you can *buy* purslane, but in the summer any gardener will *give* you as much as you're willing to pull up! It grows as a weed in most of North and Central America and some parts of Europe. It's also known as pussley. In Spanish it's called "verdolagas" and you might be able to find it in Mexican markets. It tastes pretty good (this from a confirmed veggie-hater)and is high in Omega-3 oils, so it's worth asking gardening neighbors if they have some they want to get rid of.

Made this without "Purslane". Was simple but very good. Here is a link that describes what perslane is. I would like to know where the heck you buy it! http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/631/8971

Yeah, what is purslane? It is not even in the Epicurious dictionary.
