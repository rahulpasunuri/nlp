I made this pie a few months ago for a family Easter dinner, and I think it was the best pie recipe that I had ever tried. The combination of fruits used may sound a bit unusual, but it tasted wonderful. The tartness of the cranberries was great against the sweetness of the pineapple. The pie dough was perfect. I can't say enough good things about this recipe!!!

I've been makeing this pie since it was published. Everytime, it has come out wonderful! I do not alter a thing. It is now a standard at Thankgiving and Christmas and is expected by family and friends. Also, try serving it hot with vanilla ice cream as a summer time treat. I have to admit, I too have trouble with the crust so I now use a store bought one. But the flavor of the filling is so tasty, who cares if the crust is homemade or not.

C'mon, cook from Golden CO. What's wrong widju? This is a magnificent pie - attractive to look at and full of interesting flavors. I had trouble getting the bottom crust to cook right but I can't blame that on the pie. What is the trick? To give the bottom crust a little headstart before the filling and top crust are added? I added a few coconut flakes on the top and that was a nice touch that seemed to go with the theme.

I made this for THanksgiving a few years ago and one of our guests (a 15 year old boy) would have eaten the whole thing himself if given half the chance. He nicknamed it 'heavenly pie'. I'm not sure I would go that far, but it looked just like the picture (most of the time what I make doesn't look like I could put it in the magazine) and everyone, including the adults enjoyed it.

Well, I admit this sounded a little weird, but I wasn't prepared for how it came out. I made this in french tart pans and the filling turned out not moist at all. I added some butter at the end so the filling wouldn't be dry, but it was pronounced (even though the cranberries should have added tartness) way too sweet. It does sound interesting and I think with some tweaking...more cranberries? Less apricot? Butter to top during cooking? it would turn out very interesting and a nice pie.
