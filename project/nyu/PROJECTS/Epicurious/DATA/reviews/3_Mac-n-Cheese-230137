Thanks, but no thanks. Go ahead and eat this if there are medical reasons that prohibit you from eating proper mac and cheese, or if you are hungry and nothing else is available. One star was the lowest rating I could give this recipe. It was truly vile-- bland, and rather soulless. I cook with skim milk anyway, and would much rather eat mac and cheese made with real cheddar cheese (preferably from Ireland). I'll eat salad when I want a light meal. This isn't worth it.

I used the velveeta (i like the texture it adds to mac) and added ortega chiles to the cheese sauce. I used italian seasoned panko and dusted the top w/ cayenne. Being a low cal recipe it needed the extra zing, but it turned out really well!

this was awesome but being that im in israel and also cannot get velveeta cheese i improvised a bit. this also doesnt mention salt, which it definitely needs! maya-i used regular emek cheese cut into pieces, than also added some shamenet (27% baby!), and cream cheese. it came out wonderful!

For all of you Valveeta haters out there, I substituted 4 oz of Colby/Monterey Jack shredded cheese and it was delicious.

MayaLintu, do you have Laughing Cow cheese where you are? It makes an excellent substitute for Velveeta. Any processed cheese product would also do.

Good, flavorful low fat comfort food. I skipped the velveeta altogether. In addition, i added sliced up prociutto to the cheese/milk mixture, and instead of breadcrumbs used crushed up tortilla chips. Delish!

haven't made it. I'm from Israel, and there is no Velveeta here. What would be the best replacement, considering I don't want to use cheddar only? thanks!

It tasted good, but mine curdled. Not sure where I went wrong.

I put three forks because I cut out the velveeta and used reduced fat white cheddar as a slight difference to the extra sharp 2% yellow cheddar. But velveeta isnt true cheese and even though it has a "light" version no nutritionist worth anything would tell a person to use it. Maybe in a dip? But even then doubtful. If youre looking to save money and really need that dollar(which some of us do, then go ahead and stick to the recipe)

I gave this one a try, for my never ending search for lower fat, lower calorie comfort foods. It was ok, but not worth repeating. I will continue with my Alton Brown recipe using low fat cheese and non-fat evap milk. I find it helpful to grate my cheese using the very grater, and always using extra sharp cheddar.

This was easy and fun to make, and a novelty for me since I've never cooked with Velveeta before. I understand the criticism about Velveeta and was a bit apprehensive at first, but I forgave all once I saw it melted so delightfully! I would reduce the baking time next time, as it turned out a tad drier than I would have liked. Overall very tasty!

I converted this recipe to a gluten free one and cut out the velveeta by adding another 3 oz or so of cheddar. (It's nothing against velveeta, I just don't like it.) Also, I switched the pasta to a corn based and the all-purpose to sorghum flour. A couple modifications with the seasonings (sorghum has a distinct taste) but all told, I would definitely make this again.

Mac and cheese is one of my favorites, this recipe however was awful!. It was very dry and un-appetizing...will not be making this again.

I think it is wrong to rate a recipe you haven't tried. It skews the results for those who are interested in what people who ate the dish actually think. With that said the dude from Bellingham needs to pull the board out of his a$$. In fact all you velveeta haters do. This recipe was a good alternative for those of us looking to lighten up traditionally "heavy" receipes.

I actually MADE this recipe. It wasn't great, but given that it's a lighter version - it wasn't bad. I did use whole wheat pasta - covered in cheese it doesn't really taste any different. And I ommitted the bread crumbs since sometimes it dries things out. It was just fine and I would probably make it again.

Comfort food, y'all! C'mon - Velveeta in your mac and cheese is the perfect thing when you're feeling a little blue on a cold day. What are you gonna do next? Outlaw Poptarts??? Chill.

No forks because I haven't tried it. I just wanted to say that being horrified at Velveeta isn't food snobbery, at least not entirely. I realize some people can't get anything else and what have you, but if you have the ability, avoid things like Velveeta. Ultimately it is not food and is terrible for you.

I don't believe it's right to rate a recipe I haven't tried, hence the lack of forks....but I agree with the other reviewer, VELVEETA at epicurious???? Yikes and yuck. It's more like shortening than cheese, plus who would trust a "cheese" that can be kept at room temp? Perhaps this site should drop Self Magazine if that's the kind of recipes it features.
