This is an excellent recipe! The onion, worcestershire sauce, and bouillion make this unique and extremely flavorful. Perfect blend of cheeses. May need to add a bit more white wine if you want a thinner consistency.

Would the person from Switzerland please give the details of your fondue recipe...like how much cheese to add with the bottle of wine? It sounds wonderfull dahling!

Why gild the lily? A perfect Swiss (yes, Gruyere is in Switzerland) fondue is grated cheese, into which a bottle of dry white wine, a sprinkling of nutmeg and a shot glass of schnapps is stirred (always stirring in a figure-eight pattern with a wooden spoon). Serve with cubed bread and pepper (to dip cheesy cubes into). Magnifique!

Great! I tried it and my children loves it. I put a bit of sugar while sauteing the onion instead of buillon. Definitely, now a part of family tradition.

FABULOUS! I doctored the recipe up a bit--omited bullion and onion but added pepper, raw pistchios and halved green grapes--sounds different, but had it similar at a French bistro and this recipe gets me as close to it as possible.

I make cheese fondue every year on Christmas Eve. My husband and I enjoy traditional Swiss Fondue, but I have always thought that it would be a little strong for the kids. This recipe was great. It was quick and easy to prepare. I would not change anything about it. The kids loved it. It will now be a part of our Christmas Eve tradition!

Please don't call this "Fondue" it has nothing to do with fondue, it's just a very rich cheese sauce with all that cream and butter and flour!

This is the second fondue recipe I've made and it was wonderful.

We love the cheese, but this recipe called for a lot of flour. We followed the recipe but was very unsatisfied because it tastes chalky--like flour. If you decide to use this recipe make sure you use at least half of the amount of flour.

I thought it was great as well, to the reviewer who had leftovers - I used it as a sauce for penne pasta and it was one of the best pasta sauces my husband or I have had.

Excellent! The best I've had, and not too rich or strong like many. Less butter is probably a good idea. My friends loved this with steamed broccoli, asparagus, and walnut bread.

After reading the ratings of the Gruyere Fondue recipes, I used half Gruyere and half Emmenthal cheese instead of all Gruyere. As a result, I thought the fondue turned out too mildly flavored. I made the recipe as an appetizer for a ten person Super Bowl Party using steamed broccoli, breadsticks, sweet red pepper and turkey sausage for dipping. I have a ton of fondue left over and think I could have cut the recipe in half.

This was incredible. It was my first attempt at making a fondue, but I'm hooked now. I found it to be simple to do...just follow the directions. The only variation I made was I used only two boullion cubes...the ones I used were larger than Wyler's. Very simple to make. If you like cheese, you'll love this fondue.

Best fondue I've ever had. I actually left out ALL the butter, because the cheese alone seemed like enough fat. It was very, very good without it! The texture was very creamy. Delicious!

Fantastic! We had a fondue party for 30 and this was a hit, especially for the 'traditionalists'. Best with french bread, blanched broccoli and cauliflower. Stir, stir, stir and gradually add the wine - I found I did not need the entire 3/4 cup.

This Fondue was delicious. Follow the recipe and you will have the perfect Fondue. Creamy, rich, and full of flavor. I have tried with processed Gruyere and it has a bit less flavor.
