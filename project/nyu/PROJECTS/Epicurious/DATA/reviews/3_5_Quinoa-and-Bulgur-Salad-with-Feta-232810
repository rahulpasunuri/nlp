Go good and easy. Definitely worth making. Add whatever veggies you want...I made this to use up a ton of winter radishes, so I used about 10 of them. Great base to add other flavors and dressings.

Loved this salad. I used only quinoa, (2/3 cup,) and simmered it in 1 1/3 cups of water for 20 minutes. The four cups of water are too much. It was not mushy and it did not need to be drained. I also used fresh mint, more olives than called for, (8), and farmer's market radishes. I also put the salad on top of lettuce and it was a perfect summer lunch. Yum!

Excellent summer salad- I found the flavors pop with the use of fresh squeezed lemon juice, fresh mint. I also used couscous instead of bulgur and increased the radishes (since I don't like olives). This is a perfect salad for an outdoor picnic since won't spoil.

Have made this many times because it's delicious and it's perfect for serving two as a meal (though I leave out the dried mint, because I can't seem to remember to buy it).

This was a decidedly odd dish. It's not unpleasant, but the ingredients don't seem to work together.

This is one of my favorite salad recipes. I always make it without the Bulgur - just the quinoa. I think this probably helps reduce the "mush" factor, and makes it more like a green salad, with many textures and flavors. It's also very filling and serves as a meal.

This recipe made me inscure at first (quinoa AND bulghur? feta AND radishes?) but it was absolutely delicious and very different. The idea of the shredded lettuce in the salad was somewhat off-putting so I tore the lettuce into pieces and served the salad atop it -- made for pretty presentation, too.

I was disappointed. I like all the ingredients, and I like a grainy salad, but this came off bland and mushy. I won't make again.

This is a real winner. The right ingredients in the right proportions. I never would have suspected quinoa and bulgur together, but it's a great combo.

Tasty! I omitted the bulgur because I didn't have any, and don't tend to like it. The radishes are just right.

I really liked this salad. It's very tart from the lemon, and the radishes give it a nice heat. I'm not a fan of Bulgur, so we substituted more Quinoa instead, which I think worked out better. I'm actually about to make this for the second time, but this time I'm going to try Couscous b/c I couldn't find Quinoa at the grocery store I went to. I'll definitely make it again and again.

I have other bulgur recipes far superior to this. I thought the quinoa would add interest, but it really gets lost in the combination of flavors. This will go in the circular file.

Excellent salad!! I made it last night as a side to watercress roasted chicken for a group of friends and everyone wanted the recipe...delicious! I used a bit more feta as I like cheese....other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

I even modified a bit, due to ingredients on hand. No bulgar, substituted romaine for bibb and jicama for radishes. Excellent!

I loved this recipe! I have had a hard time finding recipies for Quinoa but this one was light, flavorful and so good for you! Will definitely make again.

This salad is a meal in itself! I don't think I'd use it as a side dish, but with a glass of wine it's a great lunch if the girls are coming over. Also, brilliant to have in the fridge for ready-to-go office lunches. The salad also has a beautiful presentation, plus offers whole grains, protein, calcium and vitamins!
