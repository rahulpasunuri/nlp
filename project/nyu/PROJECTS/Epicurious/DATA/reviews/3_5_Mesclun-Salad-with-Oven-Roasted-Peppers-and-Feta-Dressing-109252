I am surprised by the other rave reviews. The salad was good, but not out of this world. The dressing was too rich. I think I may have put too much olive oil on the peppers before I roasted them - that made it rich/heavy too.

This salad is amazingly good. Use a nice, creamy imported feta and follow a previous reviewer's suggestion for adding a little lemon. A large platter makes for the perfect, elegant presentation.

Yummy! And fairly easy. I used baby mixed greens and also toasted some pine nuts to top it off. Nearly four forks!

I loved the dressing with my modifications. I added the juices that came out of the peppers to it, and a few pieces of my roasted peppers. I pureed it all until smooth and kinda thick. I added other veggies to my salad and it was great with toasted pine nuts.

The dressing was so gloppy - but I just added lemon juice and a little more water (since I didn't want to add any more fat) and it was perfect. I'm serving it drizzled over green beans tonight.

This is a great salad, especially for cold weather dining. I served it with braised lamb shanks and everybody loved it even - even my son, who is not a huge salad fan. My husband took seconds and he doesn't even like feta, usually. The dressing is kind of thick and "gloppy" as a previous reviewer noted, but no more so than your average blue cheese dressing. I had leftover dressing, which I saved for a week in the fridge; then, I made the salad again with jarred roasted peppers - home-roasted were better, but it was still pretty awesome. This will definitely be one of our "staple" salads from now on.

There was a lot of work involved in roasting the peppers, but it is well worth it! This was the best part of the meal! I would definitely make it again. I added some chopped walnuts, it was delicious!

This was a great salad, that also looks impressive. Even my teenage children liked it. I substituted balsamic vinegar for white wine vinegar, and added a few tablespoons of balsamic to the dressing, which made it smoother and a little more flavorful.

I served this salad with wine braised lamb shanks at a dinner party for six. Everyone loved it. I also added a little more olive oil and garlic to the dressing. What combination of roasted peppers and feta is fantastic, and so easy to make.

I was asked to make this salad at least 4 times since I got raves at Easter. I used balsamic vinegar though. My children (11 yr. old Boys) ask me to make the dressing all the time.

I took this to my inlaws' for Easter dinner and everybody asked for the recipe. My father-in-law, who grew up in the Basque country in Spain, couldn't stop raving about the roasted peppers, which are a very traditional dish there. They are a little work, but well worth the effort!

It's a lot of work to prepare peppers.

I brought this salad to a dinner party and everyone loved it! I did change the dressing a bit by adding a little extra olive oil and garlic plus quite a bit more water until I liked the consistency (smooth and creamy). I also sliced Kalama olives on top of the salad. The combo of the sweet roasted peppers with the creamy feta dressing and briny olives was outstanding. A perfect summer evening salad. especially served before something from the grill.

The feta dressing didn't turn out "gloppy" when we made it...in fact it was a little on the runny side. Still, I thought the combination of the peppers and the feta was out of this world.

I, too, was a little disappointed in the Feta dressing. I know it wasn't the primary dressing, but it was too bland for me. Just the crumbled Feta after dressing with the olive oil and sherry vinegar was probably enough.

Very pretty. I will try this recipe again, "tweeking" the dressing (it was too thick and gloppy). The flavors were great and the presentation nice (except for the gloppy dressing). Worth a try with a bit of "tweeking".

I've already made this salad three or four times including serving it to guests who gave rave reviews! If you like feta cheese, this salad is delicious. The combined flavors of the sweet roasted peppers, olives and the cheese dressing are a perfect match. The first time I made it, I didn't have any olives, so I improvised and threw on some toasted pine nuts...and I think I liked it as much as with the olives. This is a recipe that will impress your guests.
