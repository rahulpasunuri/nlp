this is PERFECT sauce! altho I reduced the worcestershire by half based on other reviews. I had leftover tenderloin and used bite size pieces. the flavors were clean and delicious - my husband ate the sauce with a spoon, LOL.....

Fast and tasty. Not out of the park, but good.

Very good and pretty simple. I'd add more mushrooms, but that's just me.

This is a filet stroganov. It is comfort food. It is not something new or super tasty or spicy. It is easy to prepare, tasty and oh so comforting. If you are looking for something to impress your foodie friends, this is not it.

This was okay, I don't think I will make it again. Waaay too much worchestershire sauce.

Super recipe, even with rather inexpensive brandy, and not enough of it to make the measurement required. I had to laugh at the guy who said stroganov is made with hamburger and noted that he/she's from Texas. You'd think the Texans, who take such pride in their state production of beef, would know what beef is used in what dish?!

Fast and fabulous. My boyfriend says this is the best thing I make! I would go all out and get nice filet mignon (Whole Foods is just fine).

I made this to combat my boyfriend's belief that all Stroganov is gross, cafeteria food. We both thought this was a really yummy dish. However, I was forced to substitute red wine for the brandy. I can't help but think the flavors would have been more balanced with the brandy. I'll try that next time.

Huge hit. I grilled the filet rather than pan sear it as well as doubled the sauce.

This is a very good way to update an old, boring recipe. I increased the garlic by one clove and added a little dijon and dill to the sauce to give it the zing it needs.

I decided to make this recipe tonight on a whim, and it was really delicious. I don't know what the bad reviews are about. The sauce was very good - made steaks for two and we ate all the sauce. It is quite simple to make, and we would certainly eat it again. Filet mignon is not the most flavourful cut of beef, and the sauce really enhances it.

Would use less Worstershire sauce.

We would make this recipe again, but wouldn't ever crave it.

Our family of 4 (including 2 teen age boys who really like good food) thought this recipe was very good, filet and all. Easy to make, flavorful, and great left over.

Hamburger Helper Stroganoff is made with, yes, hamburger. Real stroganoff is NOT made with hamburger.

Contrary to other reviews, the dish had a lot of flavor to us. The only reason that I didn't give it 3 forks or more is that I thought it was a waste of a great piece of tenderloin. I might use a different cut of beef next time. Egg noodles were served at our dinner and they were great with the sauce on top. Leftovers were even better the next day.

first time i ever made or ate strogonov-(i'm italian-we don't do this kind of thing).. but it just sounded really creamy and yummy -perfect for fall... didn't want to use a filet mignon..so i sliced up a sirloin steak.. made it exactly as is and agree that the recipe is bland... so added a tbsp dijon mustard and a tbsp dill as suggested in another strogonoff recipe on this site and that did the trick.. added just the right amount of zest to make this a really delicious treat--- *used lowfat sour cream and it didn't make any difference in my opinion... also used the really broad noodles which i def think was the right decision... agree with the other poster who said that the portions are rather modest and so do not inspire huge amounts of guilt... a salad of bitter greens with a nice vinaigrette would add a nice balance to the heaviness of the strogonov... all in all- definitely a keeper..!!... -i've spelled storogonov/storogonoff both ways in my review on purpose...i like both spellings....:)

I do not know what I could have done wrong. I followed this recipe and found it to have such little flavor. I may make the sauce on it's own and grill the filets before combining next time.

I found this very easy and fast (using whole filet makes it less fussy than "proper" stroganov). It is a bit rich, but the portion size is appropriately modest. I served it with beets to cut the creaminess a bit. I think that broad egg-noodles are a must though.

I found the recipe easy to follow & fairly quick to prepare. Followed instructions to a T (though I didn't have any brandy, I used Tuaca. I don't believe it really added or took away from the recipe). Basic stroganov with a filet though more beef than noodles :-) It's a good one to make for guests.

This recipe caught my eye in my first read through and I made it that night and am so glad I followed my instincts. Using butcher-bought tenderloins, I followed the recipe exactly except that I sliced the steak for service, instead of serving it whole, and used whole-wheat eggless noodles. This was a standout, and restaurant quality in my opinion. This cut of meat is not at all compromised using this cooking method and came out excellent. I will make this again and again.

This appears to me to not be either "Mignon" nor "Stroganov". Pehaps you could give it a new name but I really do not think it the effort even for me,a batchelor, living alone. Sorry.
