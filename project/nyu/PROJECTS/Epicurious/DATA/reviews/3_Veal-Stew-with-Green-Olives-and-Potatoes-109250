I used pork instead of veal and the orange was a perfect compliment. Also caramelized sliced brussel sprouts separately & added those at the end. Rich and delicious.

The flavors came together perfectly. The orange peel + gr. olives very subtle. Veal was tender and melt-in-the mouth. Only alteration -I used about 5 large strips of orange peel.

I am making this dish again tonight for a houseguest and loved it the first time. I used about a tablespoon of dried orange peel instead of real peel, and set this on the high setting for a four hour cook time, turned out superb. Lovely flavor with the olives, wine and orange peel.

I thought the recipe was a bit boring--not tasty enough. I also found it frustrating as well that the recipe didn't say whether the slow cooker should be on it's low or high setting.

I didn't follow the recipe precisely, but close enough to know it rates at least 3 forks. My potatoes were mashed and served on the side. The other half of the stew (I cook for two people) I froze and will serve it over wide egg noodles. I didn't flour the veal, it didn't need it. Oh, I didn't make the stew in a slow cooker, even though I have a brand new (unused) one. I'm still afraid of it!

Never having cooked with veal before, I was pleased to find it's delicious. This recipe was simple enough for me to follow. The contrast or variety of tastes were so pleasing. I used a little more orange and a little less olives, but it was a wonderful dish.

I'm strictly novice, so I was afraid of assigning a "4", because I'm probably so easily impressed. I liked the slight orange taste, this taste combined with the green olives (aceitunas) made for a unique and delicious flavour. By the way, I couldn't find pitted green olives anywhere. The only green olive products were stuffed with pimiento or anchoas. The recipe made it sound like they're as common a sliced bread. I bought a bottle of stuffed w/pimientos and simply performed surgery, ¿eh? I loved it, and my wife, whom I suspect is resenting my encroachment into her territory, and is a fantastic cook, said "it's not bad" - that's a great rating in my book.
