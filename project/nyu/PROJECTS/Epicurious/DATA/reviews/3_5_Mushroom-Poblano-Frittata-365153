The assorted mushroom package I bought cost $9 but it was worth it -- a beautiful variety (no shitake, which is such a strong taste). I used two pasilla chilies, which I first roasted to remove the skin, and I used parmesan as someone else suggested. I also had to substitute dry cilantro for fresh, and I bloomed that and the cumin in the oil before adding the mushrooms. This was simple, easy, and really delicious.

Excellent. Sauteed red onion with the poblano peppers. Served with a simple salad.

I made this to bring to work for breakfast for a few days. It could not have been easier, but I did make it with some minor changes. I added sauteed onions, used parmesean instead of feta, and added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes to the egg mixture. It was absolutely delicious. The poblanos add a nice heat that isnt overpowering.

Had to laugh at the "reviewer" that used only the eggs and mushrooms from this recipe! At least they didn't rate it!!! We love frittatas and this one has a great flavor combo. Like another reviewer I wasn't so sure about the cumin with the mushrooms, but the quantity was just right to bring out the warm earthiness without taking over. Also had concern about the poblano skins (usually roast and remove them), but by thinly slicing them they were great with out adding that extra step. Used a combo of crimini and shiitake. Will most definitely be making this one again. The first one disappeared in a flash.

We (three adults) thought this was really delicious. In this house we omit the cilantro...no taste for it. Nonetheless we enjoyed the frittata thoroughly, so that's a 3 forks and maybe I should have given a four for the ease of a weeknight dinner. I'll add this to my "looking forward to it for dinner tonite" list.

This recipe was surprisingly good! I thought the cumin sounded a little weird, but the flavor combination really worked. The feta also worked out well, keeping its distinct character but still blending into the dish. Quick and easy.

I went Italian; traded the cilantro for Italian parsley, added prosciutto, mushrooms, dried oregano, fresh basil, chopped baby Italian roma tomatoes and bell pepper, and minced red onion, and Vegesal and fresh ground multi-colored pepercorns, then topped with mozzarella. I also added 1 tbsp sour cream and 1/8 cup milk to the eggs and mixed with Braun Handmixer. It rose 2" in the oven and was beautiful and delicious for our Easter Brunch!

Great midweek dinner. I love the cumin and mushroom combination. I was concerned about the tough poblano skins. I made sure I followed the cooking times for each step and it turned out perfect.
