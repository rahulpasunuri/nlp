This went over very well at Thanksgiving. A nice bridge between green bean casserole and creamed spinach. The kale held up well and wasn't as clumpy or slimy as spinach. The shallots were also really good. I will certainly be making this again.

I like both kale and creamed spinach, so I decided to give this a test drive before Thanksgiving. The flavor of the kale was completely lost. The other two "testers" in the family agreed that the kale I had made the night before was much better - sliced in thick ribbons, sauteed with garlic and anchovies, cooked with some chicken stock, s&p, and then finished with a splash of balsamic vinegar.

This looked pretty good so I thought I would give it a test drive last night for a potential Thanksgiving dish. It was good, but not anything great or all that exciting so not sure I would bother making it again. It probably tasted a little better with the kale than if it had spinach, but it was not worth the extra work to use it just to end up with something that really tasted a whole lot like spinach. I actually like the flavor of kale and think it was kind of lost in this dish....
