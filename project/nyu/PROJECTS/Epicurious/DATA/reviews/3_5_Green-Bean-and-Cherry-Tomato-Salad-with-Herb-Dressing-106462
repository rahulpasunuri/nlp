I love this recipe. Great to have on hand for lunch with poached salmon on the side. I get asked for this recipe all the time. Only thing I do is add a little sugar to the dressing.

One of my favorite all-time recipes. The first time I was mixing the dressing and smelled it, I yelled, "I could make love to this salad!" I make this aaaallllll the time.

Eh, it was just so so. I didn't think it was as great as everyone else and probably won't be making it again. It just wasn't very flavorful.

Note to the people who find the garlic too strong. Try boiling the separated garlic cloves for just a minute as a way of muting some of the harsh taste when your recipe calls for raw garlic. This recipe is also good with asparagus.

This recipe is quick, easy and absolutely delicious.

Very good recipe--I followed others' advice and replaced the parsley and oregano with fresh basil. I also used a little less garlic, cooked the green beans for 5 minutes instead of 3, and mixed in 8 ounces of fresh mozzarella cut into half-inch dice. Delicious!

Really tasty and refreshing . I made these beans to go with the pork gyros with yogurt -tomato sauce etc. and Greek rice pilaf from recipezaar. Outstanding meal.

A delicious salad and good use of cherry tomatoes and green beans from the garden. As others have recommended, I suggest omitting the parsley and adding crumbled feta cheese and thinly sliced red onion. A wonderful summertime salad.

To the cook from New Jersey I say "ditto" except I did use cherry tomatoes. We will have this again.

I made this recipe without the chopped tomatoes, and just used halved grape tomatoes. I let it sit for a couple of hours to let the flavors meld. It was great and next time I will try a small sprinkle of feta cheese.

This was good, but I guess I hate to waste any summer meals on parsley -- an herb I can get easily year-round. I'd have enjoyed it more with fresh basil or a smaller amount of fresh tarragon instead. It IS colorful and appetizing.

I must be crazy, but I did'nt love this recipe like the others. The garlic was to much. I will make it again but make some changes, add more herbs, salt & pepper and give it a little zing. Plus the red onion, feta cheese. And less garlic.

I'd like to comment on the salad dressing. It'll be a staple in my kitchen from now on. I served it over a spinach salad with grape tomatoes, cucumber, feta cheese, and Kalamata olives. It was so speedy to make, and the result was fantastic. The fresh garlic and oregano elevate this salad dresssing above ordinary wine and vinegar dresssings. Definitely a keeper!

GREAT! This has become a staple side dish when we entertain people for dinner. It's flavorful, colorful, easy to make, and always gets rave reviews. You can eat it hot or room temp - a nice side.

I really enjoyed this dish. Fresh and tasty. Next time I'll try some of the suggested additions from the other reviewers.

My family has this at least a couple of times a week in the summer when the beans in the garden are ready. It's delicious as is, but I do vary the recipe sometimes: I use yellow, purple, & green beans, whatever's ready; I also usually omit the diced tomatoes & add more halved tomatoes; vary the herbs used; add parmesan or feta, & toasted nuts (pecan, pine, walnuts). One of the only ways my kids will eat tomatoes!

Easy & delicious. I took the suggestions of the other cooks and added feta cheese, toasted pine nuts & red onions. It made for a beautiful presentation, too.

Awesome! Be sure to use "aged" balsamic vinegar. I also added red onion, feta cheese, almond slices, extra cherry tomatoes, and S&P. I eat this all summer long - healthy and low fat!

I added toasted pine nuts and crumbled feta. The result was delicious and colorful.

Ran across this while editing my recipe box. I made it several tmes last summer near the end of tomato season because it had such nice fresh flavors. Once I used yellow, orange and red tomatoes for a backyard "fiesta". Big hit! One other variation I've done is to marinate some boccocini in the dressing, then add to the salad before serving with some basil chiffonade.

Excellent with crumbled blue cheese and toasted pine nuts. I usually make this throughout the summer - but decided to make it this week for a Christmas party -- good Christmas colors!

I felt this was a good starter recipe and would like to try it with some of the suggestions that have been given. I would definitely marinate the beans longer as well.

Loved this salad, served at dinner party and it was eaten up. Had a little left over for lunch the next day and it was just as good. Did add the feta and pine nuts, also a little fresh basil and used fresh oregano because it was here. Will make this again without a doubt.

I found this to be okay but not outstanding. I used some of the suggestions of others and put in diced mozzarella and fresh basil but I still feel it needs something. I'll make it again but try some other variations to tailor it to our tastes. Someone mentioned feta cheese and onion which sounds good.

I recently discovered my tomato hating husband will eat sun dried tomatoes. To the dressingI added 1/2 cup of sundried tomatoes and whizzed in the food processer. Puored the dressing over the green beans and topped with feta cheese and toasted pine nuts!! Outstanding. I will make this variation again and again. Thanks for the "Inspiration"!Reading reviews here have made it possible for me to be a little more gutsy in the kitchen.Still learning how to make good recipes better!!

Good staple... will make again.

Nice basic dressing, but I suspect I am not a green bean salad fan and would probably prefer it to be primarily a tomato salad. I agree with others that it would make a nice starting point for other additions to jazz it up; could even be used for assorted grilled vegetables. Also, it is colorful and attractive.

I concur that this is a great dish. I used the former recommendation to mix the dressing early in the day to marinate. I can't wait to try the left overs tonight.

Rating: 3
This was easy to make and tasted good. I waited until the last minute to toss with dressing so that it wouldn't get soggy. I must admit, however, that it tasted better the next day after the beans had a chance to 'marinate' in the dressing. Since it was kept cold, the beans were still crisp the next day.

Excellent. Loved the dressing. I used grape tomatoes. Cook the beans and make the dressing ahead and mix at the last minute. Very easy and colorful.

This was great. Next time I'll roast the garlic first.

I think this is a keeper. I've made it a couple of times, each time making additions according to what I had on hand. Once it was cubed havarti with dill and toasted pine nuts and another time it was gorgonzola. Both were delicious. I'll be using this all summer with good fresh tomatoes and green beans--probably making new additions each time so it won't get boring.

This is a pretty good, very simple recipe. But it doesn't really blow your socks off. I've made something similar with diced red onion and feta that does blow your socks off. I recommend those additions.

Good dressing that I will probably use on other salads. There may have been too many tomatoes in this.

This recipe is perfect to bring along for summer barbeques and picnics. It tastes "gourmet" enough to impress, but basic enough that even the guys will gobble it down. And, it's easy enough to throw together in little time. Definitely add fresh basil and mozzerella cubes as advised by other reviewers. This was polished off pretty quickly at my last barbeque, I will definitely be adding it to my recipe folder.

I made the recipe exactly as written and it was just wonderful. I had enough leftovers for 2 days and it was just as good, if not better, days later. So simple...the Italians certainly know the art of food (or was this from the Crete section of the Mediterranean issue?) Whatever, the Italians and Greeks both seem to know that simple, fresh, high quality ingredients yield wonderful food! Bon Appetite!

Very colorful. I had fresh green beans just out of someone's garden and used the little cocktail tomatoes on the vine that come in a mesh bag - expensive but they have some flavor. I served it with pork tenderloin done on the grill and brushed with a raspberry-jalapeno marinade the last few minutes and tiny new potatoes boiled until tender earlier and then tossed in olive oil, reheated in the oven and topped with a bit of parmesan/butter/minced fresh garlic. A pretty plate and delicious meal.

What a great and simple dish. Also a great starting point, as noted with all the yummy suggestions. Couldn't find good beans, and probably won't out here in podunk, so I subbed broccoli. It was good. Used red wine vinegar because balsamic just didn't sound good to me yesterday. Toasted pine nuts and mozzerella sound great, can't wait to try!

This dish was absolutely delicious. I omitted the diced onions and used just cherry tomatoes halved. I added cubed fresh mozzarella (try it- it was wonderful). The combination of crisp green beans, tangy tomatoes, fresh basil and fresh mozzarella was nothing short of perfection. I ate it for 3 days and want to make it again. It was great with a grilled sirloin and grilled zuchinni marinated in olive oil, basil and garlic. I was left wanting toasted pine nuts which I will add next time. The fresh basil is a MUST. Enjoy!!!! This is a winner!

This was delicious and so easy! I made it in 2 batches for a summer cookout. A great addition to steak and potatoes on the grill.

Just curious Patt -- why would you slam this recipe, yet give it a four fork rating?

Rating: 4
I'm with those who cheer simplicity - have been "boiling water" with great success since early teens - still enjoy opportunities to put a colorful, refreshing dish in just a few minutes - appreciate the quick but tasty suggested additions from Paris - a great way to use the beans and cherry tomatoes that pour from our summer garden - ultimately fresh ingredients really enhance any recipe.

Right on Cook from Toronto...I'm so tired of people who think you have to slave for hours to have a good meal!

Haven't tried it yet, but must comment on Patt's negativity. It really is too bad that people feel they must show off their culinary expertise by putting down a basic recipe, and labeling it simplistic. A good chef knows that what is most simple is often what tastes the best. I personally am always looking for new vegetable ideas; I don't think I'm the only one.

Rating: 4
Talk about basic, how is this a recipe? Haven't we all tried italian dressing on beans and tomatoes before? Sorry, guess I'm not being aware of those who haven't boiled water yet.

Rating: 4
simple and impressive. everyone loves this. here in Paris, we have the long and slender "French" green beans that we can use whole in this dish without cutting them up in pieces. Better served at room temperature and warming up the salad dressing. Add some diced prosciutto crudo or some crisp bacon cut in pieces and some lightly chopped toasted nuts (eg. pignoli or walnuts)at the end before tossing. a great buffet salad.

This is a great summer salad! It is easy to make and the flavors all work well together. I Let it sit for a few hours and the taste of the garlic was delicious. we served this with grilled tenderloin and mashed potatoes. I will definetly make this again.

I just made this last night. It was very delicious, especially when the green beans and tomatoes are fresh and in season, like now. I added some fresh basil from my garden and sprinkled on some Feta cheese just before serving. It was delightful and a big hit with my family. I served this with barbequed chicken kebabs and basmati rice with toasted pine nuts. Will make again, to be sure!
