A really wonderful potato recipe for wowing your dinner guests! I made mine as balls and did them in a deep fat fryer.

Delicious! The frying does take a little bit of work, but using the spoon method is quick and easy, and definitely worth the results. I have made this several times adding different flavors, such as scallions, cheese, or bacon to the potato base, all with great results.

Love this recipe. It is really like the ones that I grew up with. I used 2 spoons instead of the pastry bag.

I made these for a party I was catering. Served them with Sour Cream on the side. They were gone in ten minutes. People loved them. I will make them again. Never used the pastry bag. Just dropped spoonfuls into oil.

The piping bag they used in this recipe is an industrial one, a 2 or a 3. They should come out crispy on the outside and soft and delicious in the middle. If they are crispy all the way through, you are using too small of a tip.

Forget the pastry bag. I used a small scoop to create balls that I dropped into the hot oil. The result was outstanding--tender, light centers surrounded by a crisp golden crust. This is simple, but superb, and a remarkable way to use up leftover baked potatoes. (Reheat the potato pulp in the microwave for a minute or so to get it to go through the ricer without turning into cement.)

Made this as part of Christmas dinner. Interesting, but a lot of work for just a potato side dish. The star pastry tip created french fry type strings that were too crispy for my taste. Next time I'll use the plain tip, which will hopefully create more of a mashed potato ball with just a crispy outside. Beware - the potato mixture is thick! You may need help while frying (one person to squeeze pastry bag & one to cut).
