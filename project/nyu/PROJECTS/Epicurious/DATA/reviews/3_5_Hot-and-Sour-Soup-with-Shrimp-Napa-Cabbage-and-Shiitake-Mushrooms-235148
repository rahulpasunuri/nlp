I made this and it was good. I agree it needs to be jazzed up a bit. Here's my adaptation of a more traditional Thai Tom Yum Goong (hot and sour shrimp soup) that I thought was fantastic and is SO easy: http://www.neurotickitchen.com/2012/03/takeout-no-more-easy-tom-yum-goong.html

Great Recipe, but does need to be "amp'd up" a bit. 3X the red curry paste, served with rice noodles, and finished with a little siracha.

Just the thing to make use of the wonderful cabbages now in our local farm market. However, the broth would have been too bland without the advice of other reviewers (thank you). In addition to doubling (or more) the amount of red curry paste, 1 T of fish sauce is a must. I also added a bit more ginger, a handful of finely minced cilantro stalks, and 1/4 of a med onion, thinly sliced, to the broth as it was simmering. Only had regular white mushrooms but next time will use shiitake. Note that Thai Kitchen brand now sells dried kaffir lime leaves and lemongrass, if you have trouble finding fresh. Next time I will add lemongrass to the broth.I also cooked thai rice noodles separately and threw in a handful after the soup was done - a nice but not crucial addition.

Excellent! Very light, so serve with rice to make it a little heartier.

Wow! Very good. The only slight modifications I made were based on reading the other reviews. I upped the curry paste to 2 teaspoons and it was plenty zippy. To those who said it wasn't hot enough, it probably IS your brand of curry paste. "Taste of Thai" brand is excellent, very authentic, and light years better than "Thai Kitchen." If your grocery store doesn't carry "Taste of Thai," google them - they have an extensive website with all kinds of Thai goodies. The only other modifications I made were to add a splash (probably no more than a teaspoon) of fish sauce, and to chop rather than slice the Napa cabbage to make for neater eating. Great stuff, will definitely make this one again!

Very good soup, and both quick and easy to make. I did make some modifications, however. Per many reviewers, I doubled the red curry paste. I also added some red chili flakes for extra heat. In order to mimic a more authentic tom yung goong, I added extra lime juice. Next time, I'd also add some lemongrass stalks as well. The addition of 1 Tbsp of fish sauce was brilliant. And lastly, I'd replace the cabbage with mushrooms.

An excellent soup all around - a good balance of flavors and textures as well as being easy and quick to make. As a quick note: Leftovers are still delicious, although the cabbage suffers a bit in the reheating.

3 1/2 forks. We loved this spicy soup, but next time I make it, I will chop the cabbage, rather than just slicing it. It was messy to eat in slices.

I've made this recipe several times using packages of frozen mixed seafood including octopus, squid, mussels, and shrimp. I love it.

This is great! I didn't have any cabbage, so I replaced it with julienned carrots. I also turned off the heat when everything was done and added grape tomatoes for even more colour. They just burst in your mouth into sweet heavenly goodness! Next time I would add red chili flakes, as I like it spicy too.

Incredible! I also added a bit more curry paste (2 tsp total).

This soup is so delicious. I find myself craving it quite often. It is so comfortingly satisfying but very fresh and healthy at the same time. I always use a fresh lime and put in extra cilantro. Beware: it is not good leftover.

This recipe is a great idea, but the proportions are all wrong. I ended up using 2 tablespoons of curry paste, and it was still just barely noticeable. (It certainly wasn't very hot.) Maybe my brand was different than the one used to develop the recipe. (The label on my curry paste - the Thai Kitchen brand that is readily available in grocery stores - says one serving is a tablespoon.) I also thought there wasn't enough lime juice, and I don't think a half pound of cabbage is sufficient vegetable for six servings of a main course soup, even a light one. I used a whole pound. Finally, I used homemade chicken broth, so I agree with the person who suggested using Thai fish sauce - if you use homemade broth, you may need an extra salt kick. I would make this again, and would recommend it to others, but be aware that you might have to tinker with the seasonings.

I added a Tablespoon of fish sauce (made a big difference to the final product). I also threw in some thin onion slices to cook with the broth and boiled the shrimp shells with the stock (wrapped in cheesecloth for easy removal). Very easy and tasty.

This was very good. Defiinitely go easy on the lime juice. It overpowers the rest of the flavors.

Excellent and healthy and filling soup. I substituted lime rind for kaffir - I would say make the effort to get the kaffir as there is a slight bitter after taste with lime rind. Other than that it's wonderful. I also added tofu - firm. Do add the amount of lime juice recommended - it makes the soup what it is. Also, I used boullion cubes instead of canned chicken broth which might be greasy. I don't like anything in a can, so using fresh filtered water and cubes sounded better to me. I halved the amount of added oil and used safflower instead of vegetable. It was great - will make again when I can find kaffir!

I absolutely cannot believe this is so low fat. It's EXCELLENT! The only change I made was that I added the cilantro and green onions to the soup at the end, instead of when serving it. I also skimped on the lime juice at the end, adding the juice of half a lime instead of the whole amount - I thought that much lime just would overpower the soup.

Made this for friends and all liked it. Better than what I have had at restaurants. I bought the Thai Curry Paste and used a bit extra, then skimmed off the oil after adding the chicken broth to make the soup less greasy. Keeps well for leftovers on the second day too.

Great! Fast and easy, but tastes "gourmet"!

This is so easy that even though it isn't killer I'd make it again. I didn't have the lime leaves/peel, but I thought the amount of lime juice ended up making it a little overpoweringly lime-y, so I don't think that was an issue. I used regular sliced 'shrooms (I have a 4 month old and need to take every shortcut I can!). I'd probably use a bit more of the red curry paste. Good, not great.

I will make this again. My husband and I both loved it. Very quick and easy. extremely flavorful.

I often cook for just myself; this is the perfect soup to make in one serving portions. No need to measure out everything: 1 can of chk broth, 4 shitake caps, 4 Napa leaves, juice and zest from half a lime, and 6 shrimp. So satisfying!!

This is a very good soup- a nice balance of flavours. my husband and i had two big bowls of it for supper, and surprisingly, you don't get tired of it after a little bit... it was thoroughly satisfying and delicious! healthy, too, and soooo quick and easy.
