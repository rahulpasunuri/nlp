if the milk chocolate drizzle and a parchment cone threaten to put you over the edge, skip it. just as good without. make this a 3 night project, a little at a time. full proof and very impressive. i used Lindt, perfect products for this recipe.

The custard part of this dessert is great but the rest is not.Don't know if I did something wrong but I found the chocolate glaze very hard and the milk chocolate trim at the end too much. The whole thing cracked when I tried to slice and I had to creatively cut and serve.Not sure if I did something wrong or an missing something.Would appreciate comments.

lovely dessert that can be enjoyed any season, and is well suited to a nice dinner party since it can be made over night. I topped mine with some raspberries for color, and a personal fondness for the fruit.

I am a professional chef and made this recipe for a catered party. Although I did add praline paste and left out the alcohol for this party, the base recipe is flawless. It was a huge hit. It is an excellent recipe.

This is a very tasty recipe that is unusual and not too complicated to make. The only difficult part is the cream sauce and you must be sure to cook it on a low temperature so that the egg does not cook separately from the cream - patience :)

I have made this recipe twice. Both times it received rave reviews. Both times it came out beautifully. I have received numerous requests to make it again and again for parties and functions. It is a bit of work, but well worth the effort. The flavor is wondefully, sinfully rich. Enjoy.

After first making this in 1991, friends and family have requested it as part of our holiday tradition. A bit of work, but well worth it for those with a sweet tooth.
