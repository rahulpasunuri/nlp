Excellent. The vinegar really adds a lot to this recipe. I would make again, no changes to the recipe...

easy and delicious. the vinegar is must as it gives the peppers a bit of zest. I added a sprinkle of sugar. put it on sour dough rolls and it was a great quick dinner with a salad.

I agree with Gay Clark - omit the vinegar. I added a can of chopped, stewed tomatoes and cooked up, diced potatoes (a trick my mother taught me). Then I would give this dish three forks!

I didn't actually get to taste this recipe. I prepared it for my husband one night when I was going out with friends for dinner. He loved it! He had the leftovers in his lunch the next day. I will prepare it for the two of us soon.

I omitted the vinegar. Instead added white wine and 1 sm. can of tomato sauce. Mixed together and placed in oven for 15 minutes to blend flavors. Very tasty.

This recipe made a nice simple monday evening meal. Served with mashed potatoes - a good companion. Good quality sausage is key.

I'll make it again until I find something better. It just isn't the same as the "county fair"... Also, I didn't need a "large" pan; I needed a HUGE one. I kept dousing it with the vinegar but it just didn't ever get there.

Very close to the dish served at Petrucello's restaurant in Riverside CA in the 50's and 60's. One of my favorites.

This recipe was OK; not great. The vingar was a nice touch. Needed more garlic; perhaps 4-5 cloves? I also substituted turkey sausage. Definitely not like the sausage and peppers that you get at the San Gennaro Feast in NYC!
