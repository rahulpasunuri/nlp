I served this Christmas eve for the feast of 7 fishes. The only change I made was a shortcut using good quality frozen Maine lobster claws. We all enjoyed it and although I will make it again I feel that it is only a strong 3 forks - delicious but not a 4.

This is an excellent first course. I have a tendency to intensify flavors, but didn't feel that it was necessary for this. I am surprised that some found it bland. I have also prepared this with shrimp (for a crowd, hey, the economy), but the lobster is much better. The first time I made this recipe was for a first dinner to impress a very handsome and interesting man. Three years later he still speaks of the very tasty and impressive first encounter.

I have to agree with the reviewer who was disappointed. The recipe is good and fine but it is a little bland and probably not worth expensive lobster. I tried the recipe with crab (shrimp would work too) and it was fine. One might try a tad more cognac to up "different" flavor potential.

Elegant and easy!! Wonderful combination of flavors and textures! I have made this twice. Ran out of "real" mayo and substituted Miracle Whip, and we liked it as much, if not more.

I hate to rain on a parade, but since I made this recipe based on its stellar reviews I'm compelled to weigh in. I made this recipe verbatim and was really disappointed. I found it to be bland, and not at all a good use of pricey lobster.

Loved this dish. Very elegant served in a martini glass. All the components work really well together. Delish!

I serve this Christmas Eve as the appetizer and it's a constant hit. Rather than cooking the lobsters myself, I buy the cooked tails meat only at the fish market, making this as easy as it is delicious!

This "cocktail" makes a very elegant starter. I too served it in large martini glasses with endive and chive garnish. The yogurt in the sauce is key keeping it from being too cloying. The endive gives it an excellent crunch! The sauce can be made ahead but combine all other ingredients just prior to serving. The salad seems to break down a little when stored in the fridge too long.

We hosted the Appetizer course for a Progressive New Year's Eve party and served this. It was an absolute hit - nice presentation in martini glasses and portable, too. My husband doesn't usually like lobster and wants to know when we'll have it again.

This was an elegant and delicious recipe. I served it in martini glasses to play up the cocktail theme. Great for a dinner party.

Very nice appetizer. Added jazz to this dish by adding 1-2 Tbsp. minced onion, 1-2 Tabsp. horseradish. And also added 1 avocado. Rave results. Try it!

My boyfriend prepared this dish for me for Valentine's Day '99. (He was in charge of the appetizer, salad, and bread.) It was an excellent choice. I've made it twice since then substituting shrimp for the lobster. Either way, it is a winner!
