Today I ate my first hickory nut and it was delicious. The flavor reminds me more of black walnuts, but a bit like pecans also. I live in the DC Metro area and shop The Garrett Park Farmers Market on Saturday mornings. Today the market had freshly gathered and shelled hickory nuts. The market is located in the MARC train station parking lot, Saturdays at 9:00 AM.

There are no butternuts or hickory nuts in the entire DC metro region. Where do you find them? I used pecans and it was delicious ice cream.
