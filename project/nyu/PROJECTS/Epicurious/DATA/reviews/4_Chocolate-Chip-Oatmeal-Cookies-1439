This is seriously one of the best cookie recipes I have ever made. It is a huge hit at parties and is my most frequently requested recipe. The loads of ingredients make it very complex and flavorful. Don't leave out the vanilla pudding - it is a really great addition. No disappointments at all.

Absolutely melt-in-your mouth delicious. Oatmeal cookies are not a favorite of mine (in fact, I just recently started to make them to use up some oatmeal in the pantry - this being my second attempt ever), and this recipe is a new staple. The recipe is easy to follow. I took the other reviewers suggestions and used all butter as well as skip out on the instant vanilla pudding mix. I did not add any walnuts.

Made these cookies yesterday for a post-Christmas barbeque & they were indeed a hit. I won't say they are my favorite chocolate chip cookie ever but they were really good. I followed recipe exactly as written except put in just 3/4 cup of walnuts & was great. Made some big as suggested and some smaller--the bigger ones turned out better, chewier/moister in center. Liked the mix of flavors but do think the spices make this a recipe one to be used on occasion and not the "go to" recipe. That being said, kids and parents alike devoured them!

I can't honestly rate these cookies as I made some alterations. I left out the nutmeg and cinnamon and added 1 cup mini chocolate chips (Cacoa Barry Semi-Sweet) and shredded coconut. They are a beautiful pale golden color which I attribute to the shortening, but have a funny after taste (which I also attribute to the shortening). I will make these again but will use all butter, which is how I ordinarily bake cookies.

I used to work at Bon Appetit years ago and in fact Nancy Van Ness was my boss. She made these cookies as a special treat for our department and we looked forward to them each and every time. I have been making these for years and my son loves them!

A great chocolate chip cookie! I go back to this recipe again and again.

This makes an excellent cookie. I personally didn't care for the cinnamon and nutmeg in my chocolate chip cookie, but can understand the allure of it as an addition. I will probably omit it next time, but overall it's a great treat and definitely worthy of serving to others.

Hmm, these just aren't that interesting. Granted, I followed some reviewers' suggestions, so I didn't make the exact recipe- I used all butter, no shortening, and subbed a bit more oats for flour. I agree with some previous reviewers that the nutmeg's a little overpowering, too.

I didn't have the instant pudding mix, so I made a batch without it - tasted great, lots of compliments. Yumm.

As if this recipe needs another 4 fork review! These are the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made. All I had on hand was a sugar-free pudding mix, and it worked perfectly. I had a stick of crisco in the pantry-and secretly love shortening in cookies-but will also try these with all butter. I love nutmeg and always use fresh grated, and I also added a pinch of clove. These were really wonderful. Approved by ages 3-52.

Great recipe! I didn't have nutmeg, so I substituted Chinese 5 spice, which gave it a fun, although not overwhelming, twist and used all butter instead of shortening. Turned out amazing: slightly crunchy on the outside but moist and chewy on the inside. They were devoured at game night.

These cookies were really fantastic. I followed the recipe as closely as I could, subbing another stick of butter for the shortening, and using about 1/3 cup of whole wheat AP flour (ran out of white flour). It felt a little odd to use pudding mix in cookies, but these held up so wonderfully. For cookies made with only butter they held their shape very well.

Rating: 4
These are awesome! They were nice and chewy! I could definitely taste the oatmeal and the cinnamon and it was a nice touch. I followed the recipe exactly except I used toasted pecans (that's what I had) and I omitted the nutmeg (not a fan). I am looking forward to experimenting with different pudding and chip flavors!

Great recipe and I've even added a Tbs+ of strong coffee for a mocha flavor and substituted pecans in place of walnuts. Great recipe as is or modified!

Don't let the fact that "vanilla instant pudding mix" is in the recipe throw you- these cookies are classic. In fact, I think my husband fell a little more in love with me when he first tried these... My suggestions: Just use an extra stick of butter instead of vegetable shortening (I don't know anyone in my generation who has a tub of vegetable shortening handy...) Ditto for nutmeg- nothing against nutmeg, but I have a New York City apartment so I need to be discriminating when it comes to my spice rack... I just throw in an additional 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and there's none the wiser.

I've been using this as my cookie recipe for several holidays now, and I can say that they are ALWAYS a hit! I do cut down on the amount of nutmeg when I make it to half the recipe, because I just think it's too strong of taste otherwise-but other than that they are delicious. I'm on weight watchers, and I just recently used light butter instead, and with making them into just tiny cookies (a teaspoon), I stretched the cookies to about 50 cookies at about 3 WW points each. I also usually give most of them away, and they are a great gift to give away!

Rating: 4
These were amazing. I made them gluten free too--with gf oats and a variety of flours and the recipe still turned out fabulous! I think the low amount of oats in this recipe is actually something that everyone enjoyed. One suggestion: use butterscotch chips to make 'oatmeal scotchies'. My family has always loved that variation! Also, I left out the walnuts as we prefer our cookies that way. I will be making these often.

Excellent! I didn't have cinnamon, so I substituted pumpkin pie spice, and that was great. I also miss read the recipe and put in 2 1/4 cups oats and two cups flour, and was so pleased when they turned out so well.

Just got these out of the oven, they are WONDERFUL! Made it excactly as it states minus the nuts, (for a preschool) These are THE BEST Oatmeal cookies I've had, chewy, yet crisp, perfect texture and taste. Great recipe, will add this to my Holiday Cookie menu! Would recommend a try at these.. you will need to keep the recipe... this is one people will ask for.

I made these cookies for my husband to take on a long weekend fishing trip. I'm sure there won't be any left over when he returns, so I better make some more for me. I followed the recipe exactly--they are simply fabulous. I loved that they didn't flatten out like Toll House Cookies. Wasn't sure I'd like the cinnamon & nutmeg, but they're very subtle and don't overwhelm the cookie. Like other reviewers, I can't resist tweaking the recipe a bit. Next time I make these, I'll try more oats and less flour.

Rating: 0
The cookies were delicious; however, I would make a few changes. The oatmeal was overpowered by the chocolate chips and I only used an 8 oz. package. Next time I would add more oats and cut the chocolate chips by 1/3.

Delicious cookies...simply marvelous! I was dubious about the cinnamon and nutmeg, but the other reviewers are right, they simply add a richness to the whole package and don't overwhelm this tasty cookies at all! I used all butter

These are amazing! I accidentally bought the larger size of pudding mix, so I decreased the flour by 1/8 cup, and used a half white chocolate, half regular. I think the white chocolate was a wonderful addition. I am usually cooking above "high altitude" directions at 8150, so baked goods sometimes turn out funny until I get the hang of it. These were wonderful just as they were, I also decreased the baking time as well to 10 min. Definitely a keeper!

I am not a baker. I repeat, I am not a baker. Nor did I have "heavy large cookie sheets," I just had regular cookie sheets. Regardless, these cookies turned out wonderfully. Sort of a cross between a regular chocolate chip cookie and an oatmeal cookie. A little crunchy, a little chewy, a little salty, and a little sweet. A lovely little cookie that even I couldn't manage to screw up.

Wanted to write just once again to say that these are - hands down - the best cookies I have made in a long time. I have now made them, varying the add-ins slightly each time, about five times and each time I am more and more impressed. I cannot recommend them enough, especially at altitude. PERFECT!

I've been meaning to make these cookies for some time, and after finding a packet of vanilla instant pudding mix in the pantry, I decided to make a go of it. The review mentioning success with these cookies, even at altitude, was originally was piqued my interest, and I'm glad it did. I followed the recipe exactly, aside for baking the cookies 9 minutes instead of longer, and they turned out absolutely perfectly. Puffed up, crispy and golden on the outside, chewy on the inside with just the right amount of cinnamon-y-goodness. My only criticism is that these are not as oatmeal-y as I would have hoped. Maybe more oatmeal and less flour next time. I may even try substituting some of the oats with homemade granola.

I live at 6800' and have the hardest time making cookies that don't spread out or look normal. I tried this recipe because I thought the pudding mix might hold the cookies together better and it worked great!! I used 1/2 cup extra oatmeal to make the dough stiffer and all butter and they are tasty. I am going to put pudding mix in other cookie doughs from now on.

I have gotten a lot of positive remarks over these cooks... most in the form of big smiles as they slowly endulge in each bite. However, I changed my ingredients up a bit. Like others, I used all butter instead of the shortening. I also went with 1 1/4 c. dark brown sugar and only 1/4 c. regular sugar. And, I didn't use the instant pudding, but added an extra 1/2 tbsp of vanilla extract. I wish I would have gone with more oats than flour (I did 1 1.4 c. oats and 2 c. flour), because it wasn't as oatmeal-cookie that I wanted it to be. But, I did add 1/2 c. coursely chopped dried cranberries, which really added to them. But, nonetheless, they definitely have been a hit.

Rating: 0
These are super easy to make!! I used all butter and omitted the nutmeg, though I'll try that next time. They're really easy to overbake, so keep an eye on it...I over did the first batch, though they are still delicious. I fully agree with other posters that these taste much better the second day.

Wow, what tasty cookies! I used all butter instead of part shortening. Great consistency, but could have used half of the amount of chocolate chips.

Delicious! A quick excerpt from my blog to describe my experience (http://afreshstarteachday.blogspot.com/) Vanilla pudding mix kicks cake-like textures into this cookie. As usual, ...[The pudding's] flavor disappears behind the cinnamon and nutmeg but ties itself into the butter, making a chewier cookie. The top and bottom crunch in your mouth, and your teeth sink into the oozing chocolate center. I added 1/2 cup of raisins instead of 3/4 cup of walnuts, but I didn't add enough! In all truth, this was a test run, and because walnuts put quite a hole in my wallet, I held off until the final run. The all-expensive and worthy walnuts will be added next time along with more raisins--ooh! maybe gooooolden raisins. Yes. Golden raisins and a little more of the oats into these chocolate chip oatmeal cookies.

These cookies are amazing! The recipe says to put drops of dough on pan and bake, but i found that the dough doesnt really flatten out that much. So i made balls of dough and pressed them down a little to make them more flat. The consistency was great and they taste even better! Also i didnt have any vanilla pudding so i substituted chocolate pudding and it came out great.

This might be my all-time favorite cookie! I've been making it for years now. I use all butter and freshly-grated nutmeg (it makes a big difference in these cookies!). I frequently freeze them in balls so I can bake one or two at a time. YUM!

These had what I would consider the perfect consistency for a chocolate chip cookie! I am going to try them again with butter instead of shortening, chocolate pudding, and a little less nutmeg. I know I can work this recipe around to be THE chocolate chip cookie recipe!

Yum! These cookies are delicious and they have the perfect dense consistency and chewy texture. I made a couple revisions based on other reviews. I used all butter, no shortening, light brown sugar because I didn't have dark, no nutmeg. I nearly doubled the amount of oats and used just less than 2 cups of flour, which I sifted. I love cinnamon and I don't think it's at all overwhelming or at odds with the chocolate, but I used only 1/2 bag of mini chips because I was craving an oatmeal cookie more than a chocolate chip cookie. I was planning on giving some of these away, and if I do, I'm sure I'll be making another batch soon!

My daughter and I made these for a school party; they were a big hit. Liked the spice flavor that the cinnamon imparted. We omitted the nutmeg, used all butter instead of shortening. I only added about two cups of flour and 9 ounces of chocolate chips. I also thought the baking time was too long - we baked for 10 minutes.

Wow - where is the negative fork rating when I need it? Re the previous cook's remarks, the only magical element was the cookies' turning into hockey pucks by the next day. Family response ranged from "Hm......", to "Uh, so what's IN these things anyway?" Taste was fine, texture and consistency, awful.

This is definitely more of a chocolate chip recipe, so I increased the amount of oatmeal to almost 1 3/4 cups, added an extra egg yolk, and used 1 3/4 cups chocolate chips, and it was so chewy still. I also substituted the shortening for butter and used light brown sugar in order to work with what I had, and it didn't make a difference. These cookies spread easily, so you should probably make small cookies and bake them for 8-9 minutes. (My first batch was 9 large cookies stuck together.) I don't think I need to try looking for another oatmeal recipe. I will even use raisins for half the batch next time instead of chocolate chips.

Nobody but me ate any of these cookies, and I didn't even really like them. I think its the combination of chocolate and cinnamon that grossed my family out. Use a scant amount of cinnamon, because everyone thought it was too spicy to go with chocolate. They have good shape but the shortening never tastes as good as butter and the vanilla pudding mix was questionable. Honestly, I am surprised that the reviews for these are so good.

This is definitely a recipe I plan to make again! I used all butter instead of the shortening and baked the cookies at 325 degrees. I didn't use the nuts and added some raisins instead. The next time I make this, I think I'll try chocolate pudding--you can never have too much chocolate!

I made this recipe because one of the reviews said you cant taste the oatmeal. I like chocolate chip cookies better than oatmeal. This was an awesome combination of both. Although if you like a soft and chewy cookie, I melted the butter and added 1 extra egg yolk. You can do this to any recipe that you want a chewy cookie. I will add this to my yearly Christmas cookie list. Enjoy!

Excellent Cookies! Mine didnt' "crackle" on top, cut they were thick and crunchy outside and very cakey and chewy inside. The batter isn't as sweet as some dough recipes, so I opted for milk-chocolate chips. I don't like a very cinnamony oatmeal cookie, but I left the spices in and they add a very subtle flavor, so give the spices a try even if you don't love cinnamon.The pudding seems to give a slightly meringue like quality to the texture and adds a bit of creaminess to the flavor. BTW, I tripled the vanilla and omitted the teaspoon of water. You don't taste the oatmeal; You don't taste the spices; You don't taste the pudding...You just notice that these chocolate chip cookies are unusual, and fantastic.

Really liked this recipe, the cinnamon and nutmeg added a delicious, unique flavor! However, a word of caution: do not butter a new non-stick cookie pan. I have 2 pans, (1 old and 1 new) and the new cookie pan ended up "frying" the cookies because the butter did not absorb. But the cookies from the old pan turned out perfectly!

Honest, it's a lot easier than it looks on paper. I was a little surprised at how much chocolate there was; it's as if the little bit of batter used is just a medium for holding tons & tons of chocolate chips!! The cookies were met with rave reviews, and put my boss in a very good mood (which is all that matters, right?). Does anyone know what the pudding mix is supposed to do?

As I'm not an oatmeal cookie afficianado, I made these for a friend who loves oatmeal cookies, and substituted 1 c. choc chips, 1 c. raisins, 1 c. nuts, and they went very quickly when I took them to work! The pudding is a unique, flavorful touch!
