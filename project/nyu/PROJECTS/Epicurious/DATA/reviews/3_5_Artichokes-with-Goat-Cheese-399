There was nothing wrong with this recipe, it just wasn't any better than traditional boiled artichokes for me.

Loved this.

I have made this recipe at least 50 times and everyone wants the recipe and loves it! I use roasted garlic instead of fresh but it is all good. Easy to prepare ahead which is a big plus! I cook and stuff the chokes ahead (even a day) and wrap them in aluminum foil - just reheat before serving.

I love this recipe! I've made it several times. It is easy because everything can be made ahead, then baked prior to serving. The flavors blend perfectlt!

so disappointed. love artichokes, love goat cheese, hated it. the artichokes were bland, and the goat cheese just didn't seem to help. also mine were no where near hot enough after 20 minutes in the oven. Loved artichokes braised with garlic & thyme instead

Yum...love artichokes, love goat cheese. Although i typically do artichokes with lemon butter for dipping, i thought the lemon/thyme butter/oil was unncessary in this dish. i preferred dipping the outer leaves into the goat cheese, and the extra fat seemed superfluous. regardless, this was delicious, and i'm glad i finally conquered the whole using a small spoon to "carefully remove tiny center leaves and chokes" - it had always been unknown and daunting to me before.

Great recipe. I make it once a month as a side dish. My husband loves it and my Mother-in-Law was very impressed when I made it for her. Very gourmet.

The combination of cheese and artichokes is fabulous! I served this as hors d'oeuvres for Mother's Day on a platter with assorted crackers, which we also topped with the cheese. Made it again for Thanksgiving. It's so pretty and so easy to make ahead. It even reheats well!

I followed the directions to a T and I was expecting to LOVE this dish as I am a HUGE fan of goat cheese and artichokes. But, I was a little disappointed. The goat cheese stuffing was very rich and a little overpowering. It was good, but not great.

How can you beat goat cheese, butter and olive oil? This is a great recipe but it requires very good, fresh artichokes so it should probably be made when they are in season for the best results.

I made this dish as a light lunch - even my kids liked it. I left off the dribbling with oil part, and it still tasted good. There was one extra, which I had not put in the oven; I heated it up the next day in the microwave, and it was even better - the cheese softened more evenly.

This one's a regular favourite, particularly when I really pile in the goat's cheese. Superb as a light meal in its own right; this is the main dish my partner begs me to cook. What's more, it's so very easy.

My family love artichokes and I always look for new recipes. This is delicious, and the mild goat cheese does not overpower the artichokes. I do add salt because of the salt in the cheese. I don't make this recipe often because of the fat content, but I do make the (low fat) artichokes with lemon and dill (also on this web site) all the time.

This recipe has become one of our very favorites! I wouldn't change anything, except I occasionally use different fresh herbs, depepnding on the rest of the menu.

It was easy and can be prepared long before. I made it even easier with only goat cheese and a black olive on top for the filling. My guests apreciated how tasty and different it was.

I had no idea what to expect with this recipe, but my guests and I were pleasantly surprised with our Easter appetizer. Quite easy to make. The goat cheese stuffing is delicious!

It was ok, but not as good as I expected.

The artichokes are incredibly rich and tasty! I didn't drizzle them with the lemon butter, but served it on the side so that people had a choice of dipping the leaves in the goat cheese or the butter.

This was a big hit with my Easter guests. It is simple to make and may be prepared one day in advance which I found especially helpful.

Went looking for this recipe again...it was a huge hit when I served it for Easter dinner several years ago. Time for a repeat performance! You can substitute herbed goat cheese, or add a bit of brie, yummy!!
