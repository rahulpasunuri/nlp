I followed the other reviewers' advice and tossed the strips in olive oil. They were great, kept longer than two days. They were a bit too peppery for me, so next time I'll cut down on the pepper.

I tossed the strips with melted butter (about 2 T) and lots of salt. Defeated the low-fat purpose but tasted great!

I made this recipe twice. First time I followed the recipe and ended throwing the batch out. They were terribly dry, the seasoning wouldn't stick and visably were very unappealing. The second time I tossed the won tons lightly in oil before cooking. They turned out 100x better!
