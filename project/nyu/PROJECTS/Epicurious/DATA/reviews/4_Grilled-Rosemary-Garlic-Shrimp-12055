Had a request to make pasta, shrimp and sauteed mushrooms for a weekend trip with friends, and this is the shrimp recipe I chose - great choice! I used less salt, opting for a little grey sea salt and, also like others, just added butter and baked them off in the oven. Perfectly delicious, the marinade does not overwhelm the shrimp at all. Served with fettuccine alfredo and Sauteed Portabella and Cremini Mushrooms (Gourmet, June 1998) - yummy!

These are just fantastic. Both exceptionally tasty and easy. We've made these probably a dozen times over the last two years, from beach bbq, to at home in the oven and we will continue to make these for years. Definitely my 'go-to' recipe for easy, delicious barbeque prawns. I've even made this using dried rosemary when I didn't have fresh and it still tasted great.

I've made this twice now, varying the amount of time that the shrimp were in the marinade...I find that the flavors are overwhelming for the shrimp and that it just becomes about the garlic and rosemary, not the naturally sweet flavor of grilled shrimp. I won't make them again.

Fantastic! Served these at a BBQ and they were a huge hit. I did it the Pacific Islander way and left the shells and heads on the huge prawns while they marinated overnight. It adds such a nice flavor and protects the meat while grilling. It was a bit messy when we were peeling but was well worth it!

I made this for 20 people last weekend and it was a big hit! Just FYI - Since I had so many shrimp, I used a grilling basket and grilled the shrimp in three batches. It really worked well and saved me from threading all of those slippery guys onto skewers.

surprisingly great flavor - I thought the rosemary would overwhelm the shrimp but not at all. I shelled and deveined lg shrimp (12 - 15 count) chopped then used a blender to puree the marinade. 2 hours then grilled about 5 - 6 min - was really delicious and very easy.

This is fabulous. i discovered here in June and have served it 3 times as an entree. Each time, I started the marination the night before. The only downside is that preparing that much garlic is pretty tedious, yet worth it.

Just made these for a holiday party and they vanished, many many compliments. I used a lot of garlic and rosemary, marinated them for about 5 hours and then just pan seared them until the tails curled. Use all the marinade if using the pan, it makes the shrimp

Elegant and easy, something you can throw together if you have a bag of frozen shrimp on hand. Tried it once with fresh basil, but the rosemary is tastier. Marinated the shrimp for about an hour, then baked them with the marinade in a pretty dish at 400 degrees just until the shrimp turned pink. My dinner guest was wowed.

This was great and really easy. My husband loved it. I only marinated the shrimp about 2 hours instead of 4 and they were still very tasty. I'd love to try this on scallops too.

To make this even better, add two tablespoons of Dijon mustard and 1/2 teaspoon of cumin. If rosemary is not available, use fresh thyme or parsley.

One of the best recipes ever! So quick and easy! Fresh rosemary is amust! If you don't feel like grilling, also good if you saute or put in oven. I always peel the shrimp leaving the tail intact. This is a keeper.

Rating: 4
Very very good. Easy to make. Two tips. First, whatever you do, do not substitute dried rosemary for fresh. It's like chomping down on a toothpick. Second, use huge shrimp. I used colossal shrimp ($12.50 a pound on sale), and the dish was great, taking 10 minutes to grill on medium heat. Smaller ones wouldn't have been meaty enough, and shelling them on the plate would have been a bummer.

Served these at an elegant party for 70 people, 5 lbs. I marinated frozen shrimp overnight, peeled and threw back in marinade for 2 hours.

I served the shrimp as an appetizer at a New Years Eve Dinner. It got raves and it's a keeper. I used fresh rosemary from my plant, marinated the shrimp over night and broiled them close to the heat in my oven, two minutes on each side.

I made this dish for an appetizer for a neighborhood party, and everyone went crazy for it. The best part for me was how fast and easy it was...it took five minutes to make the marinade, and another five minutes to grill the shrimp. I only marinated it for four hours the first time I made this, and it was great, but I'll try marinating it overnight next time. So easy and so good, I'll be making it for another party this weekend!

Absolutely delicious - as good as the best fine dining seafood in Toronto - or sitting down to scampi in old Montreal. We loved it and it was so easy! In 2000 I wrote the above - I have been enjoying this wonderful dish with my husband and friends and family for 4 years now - sometimes I peel the shrimp, other times I don't. It's great either way and a real treat at our house. p.s. Serve the Peach Cobbler for dessert - wow, your family will rave!

I mistakenly used smaller shrimp, and they dried out on the grill. The flavor was good and I'm sure it's terrific with jumbo shrimp. If I make it again with small shrimp, I'll probably just saute them instead. Good fresh flavor.

It was a huge hit for Father's Day. I would add a little more rosemary though.

Great recipe... easy. I marinated overnight and it was perfect. I actually cheated and used a mini-cuisine art and made a paste of prepared, minced garlic with kosher salt and garden fresh rosemary. I did use jumbo shrimp so it wouldn't get too dry on the grill. My husband only grilled it 5 mins. total.

Extremely yummy. I love finding good recipes to features the rosemary I grow in the garden. I used super-nice coarse sea salt, which I think really helped the flavor. Large shrimp (jumbo too pricey), extra garlic, and marinated overnight.

I marinated the shrimp overnight and found that though the flavor was nicely strong the rosemary overpowered the garlin. I'd suggest using less rosemary, or perhaps marinating for a shorter amount of time would make this better. Very good overall.

Excellent! My first really positive result grilling shrimp. Used peeled/deveined shrimp from TJ's & followed SoCal's suggestions closely: 2 lg garlic cloves, 1/2 t salt, 1 1/2 T chopped rosemary, 1/4 c. olive oil, 2 T lemon juice. I skewered 1st, then layed them out in a 9x13 glass pyrex to marinate for about 3 hrs. Hubby & young kids loved 'em.

This is one of my all time favorite grilling recipes . . . it's so easy and the flavor is so delicious. Can be part of a main course or an appetizer . . . this recipe got my kids to like shrimp! Perfect for any occasion.

Rating: 3
Very good, altho I agree with the cook from SoCal before me who used a bit less salt and rosemary and added lemon to the marinade. In a hot grill pan, it cooks up rather quickly with a lid on it, so 2 min. or so on each side is recommended.This was so easy to prepare yet, had tons of flavor.

Rating: 4
I made a few changes and used this recipe as a marinade. It was amazing. Peeled a whole head of garlic and threw it in a mini food-processor with a bit of olive oil and salt. Then I added about two tbs of fresh rosemary leaves and chopped it all till it was creamy. Finally, I added the juice of one lemon and enough olive oil to make the marinade a good consistency. I marinaded several peeled jumbo shrimps, tuna kabobs, and chicken tenders for about an hour. Grilled this and served it with roasted corn on the cob and grilled zucchini -- delicious. Next time I would add more rosemary and a bit less salt. Try this as a marinade! If I can force myself to follow a recipe, I might try to use this as a rub/paste -- I assume that's why a previous reviewer said it's messy?

Rating: 3
Simple to fix, delicious but messy to eat. For speed, I minced the garlic and used a grill basket rather than individually skewering each shrimp.

This is a FANTASTIC dish, and so easy to prepare! I purchased peeled/deveined shrimp--made the following adjustments: For 1 LB shrimp used; 4 garlic cloves, 1/2 t Kosher salt, 1 1/2 T chopped rosemary, 1/3 c. olive oil, 2 T lemon juice--placed in a Ziploc bag (turning occasionally in fridge for 2 hours--would marinate no more than 4 hours). Skewered shrimp onto rosemary stems--grilled on high heat for 2 mins per side--Really tasty--HIGHLY recommended!!!

Great spring dish. Followed the recipe - added little extra garlic and some salt and pepper. Easy, flavorful - I would definitely make this again!

i didn't follow this recipe exactly, but with some adjustments this turned out to be a great recipe anyway. i peeled the shrimp as was suggested by another reviewee and marinated it overnight. i was away on vacation the first time i attempted this recipe, with no access to a grocery store due to a blizzard, so i used what i had on hand. i did not have rosemary and instead substituted cilantro and this worked out fine, although rosemary is a main ingredient to this recipe. nevertheless, the outcome was very positive and i absolutely loved the meal.

Very flavorful and very attractive. I used little salt and didn't miss it. The rosemary is great, but too much of a good thing when you grill on stripped rosemary sprigs, like I did. Don't make that mistake unless you love rosemary!

As the reviews recommended, I peeled the shrimp before marinating. The flavor was great, but I thought it was a little time consuming. I will do it again, but with a little help from my friends!

Rating: 3
After reading other reviews I did cut down on salt, but not enough. I would cut salt amount in half. Also I peeled the shrimp before marinating since it's easier to eat and so the garlic flavor could get closer to it. I love garlic but even the garlic could be cut down a bit and still be effective. Also because rosemary is a such a strong-tasting herb, amount could be cut in half as well and still give a nice flavor

Rating: 3
I thought this recipe was very good. I think next time I will peel the shrimp before I marinate to get extra flavor and make it easier to eat. We also marinated snook in the same marinade and loved it. Any thick filet of fish would be a fine choice, not many have access to snook as we do in Florida

Rating: 4
I made a low-fat, low-sodium version of this dish that has gotten RAVE reviews each of the 4 times I've prepared it for guests. For the marinade, I substituted fresh lemon and lime juice for the oil (3 whole lemons, 2 whole limes), left out the salt, and kept everything else the same -- well, maybe a bit more rosemary (yum!). I marinated frozen, peeled, jumbo shrimp overnight in this concoction (just put it in a Ziploc bag in the refrigerator and they'll thaw by morning). Skewer and broil... but watch carefully because they cook quickly! The shrimp turn out tangy and tender, and definitely not too salty!

Rating: 3
Ok, this rocks. I think that the people who thought there was too much salt may have made this dish with PEELED shrimp. Leaving the shell on and picking it apart with your fingers is the whole point and the extra salt makes it finger licking good. If you want a clean, peeled dish that requires only a fork; use less salt. Either way you won't be disappointed.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe at all. I modified the salt, like others suggested, and it still wasn't great. There was no real big flavor. I wouldn't make this again.

SALTY!! This would have been perfect if less salt was used. I will definitely make it again, but I'd probably reduce the salt to 1/4 t. I made it in advance and let the shrimp sit in the marinade overnight. Maybe that contributed to the saltiness?

Rating: 4
This recipe was GREAT! I could have easily doubled my recipe for the 6 people I was serving. A huge hit. I also made scallops along with the shrimp. Be careful with the scallops, they seemed to soak up the salt a bit more than the shrimp and were too salty for me.

These shrimp are wonderful! I've also made them using extra large shrimp instead of jumbo, grilled them without skewers earlier in the day and served them chilled and piled high (we did 80 shrimp the last time!) on a platter with fresh rosemary sprigs and lemon slices. (The flavor intesifies after being chilled.) There's never been a single one left.

The best grilled shrimp recipe!!! The only thing I did different was to leave out the olive oil-I am on a no-fat diet. I used lemon juice instead. The smell from the grill had my neighbors coming over to see what I was cooking. I am going to try the recipe on scallops next. MAKE THIS!!!

WOW! This was great and so easy! The garlic flavor was intense...being raw garlic, I might go a little lighter next time, but it really was good. The shrimp were succulent when grilled over medium/high on a Weber with the cover open for 3 minutes the first side and about 4-5 on the second...but watch them closely.

I have just tasted heaven on earth! This is the best grilled shrimp recipe EVER! My husband was quite skeptical, he said that every grilled shrimp he has ever eaten has been dry and leathery, but I had him swooning tonight! So flavorful and tender! No need for any sauce to dip, just ate it straight from the grill and couldn't get enough. Used jumbo shrimp and threaded them on a skewer. You must be VERY careful not to overcook them or they will become dry and leathery. I want to make this recipe every night. Unfortunately, the price of jumbo shrimp precludes me from doing that. Maybe if I sold my car...

This was so easy and delicious. I used jumbo shrimp and followed the recipe exactly. It may have taken longer to grill and I might have used more garlic too, I'm not sure.

I will be making this again and again this summer!

I've made this recipe several times as a "glory meal" and it's soooo easy and delicious. Medium sized rosemary sprigs are a nice substitute for shrimp skewers. Try roasting the garlic first for a more rounded flavor. Jalepeno corn muffins and grilled green beans (less the garlic) recipes make good sides.

Wow! Anyone who lives in the MD/VA/WV border area should be aware that there is a small seafood stand at the Amoco station where the three states conjoin. They sell heads-on, never-been-frozen Carolina shrimp; the size of the shrimp approaches vulgar and the prices are outrageously low.
