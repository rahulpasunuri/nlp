I enjoyed this light and healthy meal. Perfect for January when you are trying to undo your holiday eating sins.

I had some problems with this recipe. It never told you when to put in the orange chunks, and I put them in too early so they disintigrated into orange mush. Put them in about 30 seconds before the fennel is done and you should be fine. Also, use a really good non-stick pan and add some orange juice from a carton because there's not enough juice in the pith! Overall, taste was mild but pleasing. Nothing exciting, but it adds variety to a healthy diet.

there was nothing wrong with this dish, just nothing nice about it either, except the clear, sweet fennel flavor. i added a bit of fresh mint chiffonade, more for color than anything, and it was helpful. i was expecting to like it more... but the snapper was nice. glad i tried it, but will do something different with it next time.

Wish there was a 3 1/2 star rating - this was very good and very easy. I didn't have fennel seed and it was just fine. The perfect weeknight meal!

I really should look for recipes before I go grocery shopping! But I did have fennel, oranges and sea bass. So forget the fennel seeds and substitute sea bass for the red snapper. Its still a great dish. A really great dish! Easy and flavorful.

We really enjoyed this. It is an elegant, yet simple-to-prepare weekday dinner that is delicious and pretty enough for entertaining. I, too, made it with rice and asparagus. A real treat in the middle of the week.

This is one of my favorite recipes. The carmelized fennel is mild and sweet, and the flavors of fennel and orange are light and wonderful with the snapper. This is simple, elegant, and delicious.

All too often I fall into the trap of not trying simple recipes. It seems that simple recipes just can't be great. Fortunately I tried this one. Fennel and orange is an established combination but the concentration of flavors from the sauteeing of the fennel, the additional fennel seed and the orange juice makes this an unforgettable meal. The snapper works so well with this. This is a clear winner.

This dish was interesting, light, tasty, and simple. It's possible that a step was left out; at any rate, after I steamed the fennel for a few minutes, I added the orange chunks, and heated them with the fennel for a salsa-style sauce. After the fish was cooked, I removed it from the pan, added a few TBS of orance juice to scrape up the bits, and added that to the sauce. I served it with simple rice and asparagus. My husband enjoyed it, which is the true test!
