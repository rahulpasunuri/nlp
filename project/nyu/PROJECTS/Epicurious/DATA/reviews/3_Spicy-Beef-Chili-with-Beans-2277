I agree with other reviews, I don't go to epicurious.com for recipes like this. Using packaged mixes of any kind never taste as good as fresh, homemade blends. My only exception to my self imposed rule against pre-packaged mixes is Ghiradelli chocolate brownie mixes.

A package of chili mix, really? That's not why I come to EPI.

Add another Chili Cook-off Winner!! I took the advice of adding onion and garlic, and added a jalepeno, bell pepper, and a pound of beef stew meat. I doubled the beans, and tomatoes also to make a larger batch. I could not find beans with Chipotle peppers, so I bought a small can and only used half of it. Very tasty, and like I said, it won a chili cook-off!

If I wanted a recipe with a mix in it I would just buy the mix.

Good basic chili, easy to make and good for many other applications like a Chili Stuffed Tater, or Chili Enchiladas etc.

This is an easy and reliable chili recipe. It is definitely not gourmet food, but it's just what you imagine when you think of a nice big bowl of traditional-type chili.

VERY good--with some modifications. Used 1/2 pound bacon, didn't get much flavor next time will try 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground pork instead. Added garlic and 2 onions which I sauted in the bacon grease. Added a small can of tomato paste. Added ranch season based on prior reviews however it didn't "make" the dish. What DID "make" the dish was adding about 3/4 bottle of beer (only had Miller Light, still good), really gave it a good broth, too but still a chunky chili. Added a handful of sliced jalapenos which gave it a nice kick, although too spicy for my 6 year old. Used 3 cans of beans, kidney and pinto. Could probably even use a 4th can as this dish is plenty meaty. I forgot to add some corn but that would have really been tasty. Only 3 forks because I added so much to it thanks to previous reviews. Agree that recipe as is doesn't really count as "cooking" (cans, season packets and whatnot) but it was perfect for a weeknight family dinner.

Instead of a chili seasoning packet, I use chili powder, cumin, pepper salt and mole sauce. The mole give spice with a rich hint of chocolate. It makes everyone who eats it comment on the distinct flavor.

I made this Chili for a church function and people couldn't stop coming up to me for the recipe. I used the recipe on the site as my "base" and then added the following: 1/2 lb. bacon (rather than just 1/4 lb.) 1 pkg. ranch seasoning (omit the chili seasoning in the recipe) 1 T. chopped garlic chili powder to taste ground red pepper to taste cayenne to taste I cooked the ground beef and then drained all but a very small amount in which I sauteed the onions and garlic. Then I threw everything in a crock pot, let sit overnight and slow cooked it the next day for 5-6 hours. Delicious!!

this was a great start for chili...i added the ranch packet (as discussed by another reviewer-awesome idea), a little beer, corn, onions, and used boca vegetarian crumbles instead of beef....it turned out to be really fun and we served it over baked potatoes with sour cream and green onions. that's just my version; which is definitely not for the traditional chili fan but quick to make and a great weeknight meal.

I make this chili often. It's fast, easy, and kids love it. So do picky adults and people who won't usually eat chili. I have modified the recipe and run the risk of being accused of not using this recipe at all, but it's the same--just different. We don't do pork so I use a bit of olive oil instead and start the recipe from the place where you brown the beef. I drain the fat off then use plain, not Italian tomatoes and regular canned pinto bean. Instead of the seasoning mix I use 1 tablespoon chili powder and 1/4-1/2 teaspoon cayenne.

Good recipe for a base..but I changed it up a bit. Browned meat with lots of garlic and onion. Added the tomatos plus jalpenos, bottle of dark beer, lots and lots of cumin. Finished it off with a pack of ranch seasoning (this did the trick). Top with cornbread, chives and cheese. sooo good.

Authentic? Maybe not. But add the sour cream, freshly chopped white onion, and Tillamook extra sharp cheddar, and you've got yourself something! It may not be hot or fancy enought for the chili snobs, but if taste is all that matters, cook away. I will say that I would like to have done the spices myself, rather than adding a spice packet. For an extra bang, put a cornbread muffin in the bottom of the bowl and ladle the chili on top.

Easy to make. Great taste with the added sour cream. And of course it includes bacon. What can go wrong with bacon?

I've got a much better quick cook recipe, but I like to try new ideas, this one's ok, if you want to make a quick chili. Brooks hot chili beans, has a pretty good quick chili recipe.

This recipe is definitely for the hopeless cook. It's one step above opening up a can of store-bought chili. Where's the heat? The real trick to chili, as I've learned through trial & error, is to layer the hot stuff. That way you get a good burn, without overpowering from just one spice. So add a couple of different hot spices. If you make it too hot, just throw a dollop of sour cream or some grated cheese on top. And chili, like soup, always tastes better the next day.

Tastes better than you would expect (given the cans & mixes involved). Perfect for last minute dinners, or as a cook-confidence builder (new grads, teenagers, etc).

A chili recipe with a store-bought spice mix?? FOR SHAME! Why not just follow what is on the spice mix package.....this is NOT cooking.

What an easy Chili recipe! For extra 'zing' you should add veges like onions & chili powder. I used cans of tomato sauce that was pureed and it brought out more of the meat & bacon texture. I'm waiting for my husband but had to sneak in a cup of chili. It's delicious.

Easy to make but tastes more complicated than the quick process would indicate. Definately a keeper for those who like good chili. We added tobasco, chili powder and a little paprika to spice it up.

This dish is excellent for a quick tastey meal. It is very easy to make and the bacon adds a great smoked flavor. I added one more can of tomatoes and cayane pepper to mine to add a little more heat. Great dish!!!!!

This chili was so/so. What I did like about it, is that after working all day, it's a quick and easy chili to prepare. I'd make it again but I will need to work with it a bit. Needs more pizazz.

I thought this was just wonderful, but my husband and kids wouldn't eat anymore after the first bite. They don't like anything spicy, but I do. I think rather than throw out this wonderful recipe, I'll just find a new family! Before I pack their bags, I think I'll fix them some Thai food so they will know what spicy is all about. Great tasting chili!

Last night I won the chili cook-off contest using this recipe. I altered it by using beef chuck roast, cut into chunks after preperation and cooking for 2 hours, I let it rest for 2 days and then slow cooked for 5 hours. I altered by adding beef stock and raisins and called it Chili for Lovers...Hot and Sweet. Everyone asked me for the recipe. This is the first time I ever cooked chili...It was great!

I can't believe you'd print a recipe with "chili seasoning mix" as an ingredient. Give your readers some credit. We know that making meals from scrath is the way to do things.

For the quick and kid pleasing meal that it is, this is just right. The 1/4 pould of bacon should be 1/2, add chopped purple onions and 4 cloves of fresh garli, a small can of tomato paste and 2 cups of tomato juice ba da bing. and this is a crowd pleaser; even if it is a crowd of mid western wanna be Texans thinking this is chili type crowd (you know, kid taste buds) Gots to have a sixer of your fav brewskis ice cold too. I made corn bread muffins with honey butter as a side. Life is good. Yum. Ciao

I like my chile with lots of Thai pepper ( very very hot ! ) With this recipe, I would venture to add chorizo bilbao and potatoes ( ..hope the owner of this fantastic recipe won't mind ! )

This was excellent, perfect for a football-game meal. (I served it during the Rose Bowl; we're from Miami so maybe anything would have tasted good.) Couldn't find spicy chili beans with chipotle peppers, so used regular chili beans and added Rotel tomatoes-and-chili. Yes, it's another can, but it tasted great, and isn't that what matters? The point is not that the recipe included a chili-mix, but rather what you do to make this, or any other dish, taste good with minimal work.

This was "excellent" for a quick meal. Very tasty ... I served the chili with Italian bread on the side for dipping!! With corn chips, this would also be a good appetizer for a super bowl party!

This really is a tough crowd. I like the recipe fine for a busy day when I do not have a lot of time to prep a meal. But, for when I want a real savory bowl of chili, I would have to pass on this one. I am still in search of the perfect HOT chili.

Geeze! The other reviewers were pretty harsh! This isn't *such* a bad recipe. I would add some onions and fresh garlic for an easy meal.

Seriously, this IS what it IS. Sometimes quick is just what you need, and obvoiusly there is a trade off. And really, would you WANT to eat chili before going to your mother's funeral anyway???

Can't review because I wouldn't even bother to make. No-brainer or not. Agree with other cooks- how tough is it to make a homemade/fresh spice mix for chili? Sadly- this is the perfect example of why I always pick a Gourmet recipe. Yes- perception can be everything. This recipe supports my perception.

Rating: 2
WOW, tough crowd out there. This recipe isn't THAT bad. It's not gourmet cooking for sure, it's kid friendly and on a cold Monday night when my family is running in a million different directions, it's just fine. Good over rice with the cheese, onions, and sour cream, and a chunk of cornbread on the side. Every busy cook needs a good no-brainer recipe now and then!!

I have an even faster recipe. Cook bacon, dump in one can of Hormel chili. This is not a chili recipe. This is more like a list of ingredients on the back of a can. Very disapointing to say the least.

Surely the very reverse of everything that this website stands for. It doesn't matter if it's easy: I wouldn't make this recipe if I were late for my mother's funeral. How difficult can it be to select some ground cumin from the cupboard and perhaps some fresh cilantro from the fridge? Seriously, it upset me even to find this recipe here.

I agree with the person from Lakeville, OH. I have not made this recipe, nor would I. If you're going to use a package of store-bought mix, why not just follow the recipe on the back of it. This is definitely NOT a real recipe. (A tip, I made the "Halftime Chili instead and it wasn't bad at all.)

I took the advice of MJ from Florida and made all those changes. This chili turned out really good. If you want a good, EASY chili recipe, this is the one for you. I only put one can of beans in mine, and it turned out just as good. My husband said I should enter it in our local chili cook-off contest!

How much thought does it take to brown meat and add a chili mix to it. Is that really a chili recipe? The same thing is sold on shelves in grocery stores across America.

This was so easy, and delicious! I used a half-pound of bacon, but trimmed the fatty end off so that there wasn't any excess fat to drain after cooking. I also added some chopped onion while I was cooking the bacon, and added a little extra chili powder, salt, pepper, and garlic powder while it was simmering. I served this with some cheddar jalapeño cornbread, and it was a big hit!

This recipe was very easy and quite tasty. I would definitely make this again. I cooked onion along with the beef and bacon. I like a spicy kick to my chili so I added crushed red pepper (about a tablespoon). Also, I used two tablespoons of chili powder instead of the chili seasoning. This recipe allows for a lot of flexibilty. The bacon, though, is a keeper.

I am giving this recipe a 3 fork rating because it is very tasty. But the biggest reason is because it is such a no-brainer!!! I think it's the easiest thing I've ever made, what a great thing to make after a hard day. I added about a cup of frozen corn and served it over vermicelli noodles.
