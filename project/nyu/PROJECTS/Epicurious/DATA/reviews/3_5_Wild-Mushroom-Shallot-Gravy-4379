We have a vegetarian Thanksgiving. I use this gravy substituting the chicken broth with a product called no chick- chicken broth. Since the gravy is thick and "meaty' with all the mushrooms it is very satisfying.

While this was a good gravy I felt like this turkey could have benefited from a regular turkey gravy. The cream was a bit much as I usually rely on a gravy to cut the heaviness of the rest of the dish instead of adding to it. I might make it again for something else but sticking with a traditional gravy for this turkey, which was amazing by the way. Make it!

Good taste, but was more of a soup, not a gravy. Had to add some Kitchen Bouquet for color as it was anemic.

I've been making this gravy for 8 yrs. and everyone raves about it. Because it is so thick, I try to make more than I think I need because it really goes fast.

What can I say? I'm crazy about this gravy. It is definitely thicker than normal gravy but still utter heaven. It's intensely flavorful, heavy, creamy and rich - perfect for special holiday meals. Don't know about the rest of you but I only indulge in gravy twice a year and this gravy is worth every single calorie. Please don't cheap out with substitutions or low quality items as it does make a huge difference. I used fresh shittake, fresh oyster and fresh morels (nothing dried like I have before; or even worse, regular button mushrooms). I used high quality dry sherry and marsala - stuff that would be a treat for me to drink. In short, I finally followed this recipe exactly for the first time this year and got rave reviews from every one of my guests - they didn't know it was the same dish I'd been "trying" to make before. I wonder if those who say they didn't like it actually used fresh wild mushrooms and high quality booze since the only reason I can think that someone wouldn't like this recipe is they hate mushrooms to begin with, don't like rich creamy anything, or they messed with or altered the recipe in other ways. I will be making this every Thanksgiving and Christmas in the future (no more experimenting from now on) and I will be tripling the recipe and serving it with a big spoon and no apologies. I would never water this down or change the consistency. It is perfection as is. Wish I could give it 5 forks!

I call this the $100 gravy. The wild mushrooms can be super expensive up here- but so worth it!!! This year I am going to try to make it a little thinner by adding stock I guess - or maybe a few less mushroons and I will use the food processor to chop the veggies- thanks for the great idea. We LOVE this gravy! I'm thinking if I make it thin enough, I could call it soup!!

This recipe has been used in my house for the last 6 years. I get request for the whole thing on a regular basis from friends. DO THE TURKEY and THE GRAVY together. This is an incredible about of flavor. But you must use morel mushrooms in the gravy they are the key!

This is the most amazing gravy ever! People, please - don't waste your time chopping all this stuff, just put it in the food processor for a sec and be done with it. The consistency will be less lumpy and more like gravy. Seriously the best gravy I've ever tasted. One caveat, though. Just skip the recipe for the sugar cured turkey. Everything on my table tasted sweet since I served wine, sweet potatoes and dessert. I'm going back to the olive oil rub I've used before, it's less time consuming and adds back a savory taste much needed with all the other sweets.

I followed others suggestions and finely chopped the ingredients...still chunky. We found that if we heavily seasoned it, the dish was repairable. Served as "dressing" not gravy. Worth a try if looking for something different.

This was AWESOME. I cooked it for Thanksgiving this year. Hands down it was the favorite. Next I am going to try and make this into a mushroom bisque.

This is the fourth year I have made this gravy. It has a wonderful taste and flavor but is not typical gravy consistency. I agree with the cooks who have said it's more like a side dish. In the past it's been too liquidy. Tried to reduce it longer this time and cut the mushrooms smaller. Cutting the mushrooms smaller was a good idea but I reduced it too much and didn't have enough liquid. Next time, I might try adding cornstarch to thicken the liquid. But still a great topping if you're willing to forego the typical gravy.

YUCK!!! made this for Christmas dinner and no one liked it. followed the recipe exactly. it was just too sweet and almost bland. the cream overpowered the mushrooms.... really the worst gravy i've ever eaten.

I don't follow the recipe exactly, I use a lot more stock but I also add roux to thicken, than afterwards used a stick blender to blend the gravy smooth. The flavor of all the herbs and the sherry is sooooo yummy. This is one gravy that always graces our holiday table.

So thrilled to find this recipe again after missing it for two years. I was reminded by this years Thanksgiving guests just how special it is.

this is a favorite for us anytime, don't need a holiday to make this. We like morel mushrooms in ours finely chopped so that we can get to the gravy. Also make a wildrice and sausage stuffing gives the flavors a nice balance.

Flavor was good and my guests enjoyed it but don't make it if you're expecting a gravy. It's REALLY thick with mushrooms so it comes out more of a side dish/relish.

My husband made this gravy during a snowstorm so had to make a few substitutions, but enjoyed it very much anyway. Very rich.

This went over very well at my christmas party. The gravy was gone before the potato dishes it went on. I agree it is chunky, but if you're a mushroom fan, you can't go wrong. I used Oyster, Shitaki, Chanterelles, and Black Truffles. The gravy was rich and savory, it's coming back next year.

This gravy, along with the sugar-cured turkey, is an annual tradition for Thanksgiving at my house. I use chanterelles and lovingly refer to it as 25 dollar gravy. They give it a rich meaty flavor which matches perfectly with the bird.

DELICIOUS!...but WAY too many mushrooms for a gravy. I used part of a bag of Trader Joe's frozen mushrooms to RAVE reviews. Next time I'll use the whole bag and make it a GREAT side dish.

This is an excellent mushroom dish!! I've made it probably a dozen times by now and every time it is the first thing to disappear off the table and I am constantly asked for a recipe. However, I do not think this dish serves well as a gravy.

I got raves for this gravy at Thanksgiving, although i was not as impressed, although it was very tasty. Agreed, use 6 - 8 oz of mushrooms instead of 12 cuz it was way too chunky.

Made this with the recommended turkey recipie and it was teriffic! So easy too. The roasted garlic and shallots gave this a nice flavor and the consistency was just right. I agree with some of the other reviewers that there was a bit too many mushrooms for the amount of gravy. I'll reduce them next time but will definitely make again!

My family really loved this recipe. However, next time I would double the sauce since it seemed like too little sauce for 12 oz of mushrooms. It had a very strong mushroom flavor. Although, its very creamy for a gravy.

I did not like it at all. Too many mushrooms and too much cream.

Rating: 2
Hate to be one of the few that didn't care for this that much but it seemed more like cream of mushroom soup than gravy. Also felt the flavors were just a bit too strong and overpowering. I generally enjoy all of the flavors that went into this but have to say it was not a hit at our table this year.

I have made it for the last 3 years - and everyone loves it. I make one regular gravy for the folks who don't like mushrooms and then this one. You can never have enough gravy. This has so much flavor and character! You could make it year round for chicken ... whatever. If you want something different but not too bizarre - this recipe is perfect - makes the cook seem very gourmet. And like the cook from Toronto - it is perfect if there are any vegetarians - a replacement for their "meat" on Thanksgiving. Try it!

Everyone loves this gravy. My wife says she could drink it out of wine glasses.

This is great. I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth and had a great vegetarian gravy to go with my favourite side dish of roast garlic mashed potatoes.

This gravy is just amazing! I used it on the brown sugar cured Turkey recipe and it was just fantastic. The flavour is so good that I would recommend making it with any other dish that needs gravy. Definitely the best gravy I have ever tasted. The flavour is heavenly!

I made this for my first Thanksgiving away from home at our dorm party, and it was amazing... most everyone enjoyed it.

I made this gravy with my first Thanksgiving turkey in 1997. It goes great with the Brown Sugar-cured Turkey, which was the cover recipe for Bon Appetit that year. It is delicious!! I got lots of compliments and my mother, who is a great cook, said it was the best gravy she had ever tasted. Try it!
