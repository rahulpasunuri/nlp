I agree completely with Bobbie...what a waste of ingredients! At least I didn't have to sacrifice a vanilla bean! The texture wasn't smooth at all and did seem to separate, and the flavor just wasn't there......I will look forward to an improvement over this one because I do love peanut butter!

I wasn't too happy with this recipe. I am a personal chef and I cook every day for people and I am sure I followed the recipe correctly. First, the top had too many bubbles in it and I guessed it was due to trying to mix the peanut butter in. Also, it seemed to separate after cooking. It was too thick and heavy and it really tasted like baked peanut butter. I have an idea on how to make a better peanut butter creme brulee, and if it works, I'll write back and let everyone in on the secret. Bobbie Personal Chef for Set the Table
