This will become a standard recipe for me. Easy to make and delicious. It's also good with ice cream.

A brilliant finish to a great christmas dinner. I left out the ginger as there were children with fussy tastes I trippled the recipe and made one big cake in a torte pan. Beware this cake sinks considerably. I topped slices with scoops of vanilla icecream and then mango cubes.

Wow. I made this for a dinner party, and everyone loved it. The crystallized ginger was really expensive, but it was worth it -- it added a nice spicy kick to the chocolate, and the mango was just heavenly. The flavors blended together so well! If anyone is thinking about making this as one cake (instead of the way it is in the recipe, as individual cakes), I did it and it worked just fine, but I'd suggest tripling the recipe.

This was really easy to whip up. I was apprehensive about using the mango and ginger but I'm actually really pleased with the result. I also served these with fresh whipped cream lightly sweetened with vanilla sugar. The end result was a subtle combination of all the flavors, none of which overwhelmed the other. I used the Valrona chocolate and Sharfenbeger cocoa, which I think added a more complex chocolate flavor. One slight disappointment was that I wanted the center to be more gooey than the result. It was still good nevertheless. Perhaps it turned out less than gooey because I doubled the recipe. Anyway, I would make this again. The cakes were soft and yummy.

I might make this recipe again because it is so easy & quick to put together. However, I wasn't blown away by the result. While my cakes were still soft & moist in the centre & turned out of the pans neatly, there was something flat & dull about the flavour. They seemed to cry out for a sauce of some kind. I added a scoop of Haagen Daaz vanilla which helped a little but I think a creme anglaise or a white chocolate sauce would have been better. Something missing here.

This was great! I think I undercooked it a bit - making it a little pudding like. (It was in the oven for the full amount of time suggested.) Next time I'll do that on purpose.

I would try this dish again minus the ginger, (too strong) and with a creamy white or milk chocolate sauce.
