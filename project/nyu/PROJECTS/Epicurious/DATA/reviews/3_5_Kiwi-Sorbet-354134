I was a bit skeptical that the amount of sugar would be too much, but it ended up perfect. I did add approx 2 tablespoons of lime juice to the recipe since I had limes on hand, otherwise, make sure to taste the fruit before you decide how much sugar to add. The next time I would strain out the seeds, but that is a preference thing. I like the seeds, my son did not.

Yummy!! I added the zest of 1 orange and used regular sugar. I used about 12 kiwis that were good and ripe. I also strained the pulp and removed most of the seeds. I did leave some so that it wont get confused with my homemade green tea icecream. I highly recommend

Do not take the 'ripe' part of the recipe lightly. I didn't have the time to wait and I used some firm kiwis and, even with the full helping of sugar, the sorbet was incredibly tart. It reminded me of eating chile-dipped mangos: it makes you pucker and you wish you hadn't put it in your mouth, but five minutes later you want more.

I'm wondering if I did something wrong here, even though the recipe is exceptionally simple! I peeled and chopped the kiwis, added the sugar, etc. I think that it was too sweet, and I found that the seediness was too much. Not sure if I'll try this again.

We all loved this. It was SO simple to make and it was nice as a meal ending. I read the reviews beforehand, so I added 1 cup of sugar (I didn't use superfine) and it turned out perfectly fine. Definitely worth the effort!

Really quick and easy to make. Love the tartness and not too sweet flavor.

Very disappointed with this recipe. While the texture was great, the flavor was quite sour even though we used very ripe kiwis.

Great fresh fruit flavor. Very easy. Essentially the same recipe as the kiwi -lime sorbet - but without the lime concentrate. I used 8 big kiwi and let them ripen for a week. I added juice of one lime. That's it. Would be great paired with other tropical and/or summer sorbets: mango, pineapple, melon. What ever is fresh and flavorful.
