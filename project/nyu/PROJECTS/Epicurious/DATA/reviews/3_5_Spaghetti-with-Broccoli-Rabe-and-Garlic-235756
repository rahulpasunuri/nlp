Easy and delicious. I used broccoli instead of rabe and skipped the parmesan. A great weeknight meal!

Always a quick and delicious dinner. Reminds me of my Nona.

I make this about least once a month. A really easy lunch or quick dinner. Broccoli rabe is one of my favorite vegetables, and this is my favorite way to prepare it.

A simple, but delicious dish. I've made it again and again.

Really good and I'm feeling healthy just eating it. Added pecorino romano. Had something very similar at a restaurant and they sausage on their's. Will be adding hot turkey sausage, but will omit pepper flakes at that time. Adding 2-3 anchovy into the oil sounds like a good idea as well.

Too much broccoli taste.

very good, tasty, quick and simple to prepare. Just one suggestion: when heating the oil with the garlic, add 2-3 anchovies, it'll be even better!
