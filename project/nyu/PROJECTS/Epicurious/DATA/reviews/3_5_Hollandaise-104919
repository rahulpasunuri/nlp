This recipe just does not work! Followed the directions EXACTLY and just get a curdled buttery mess.

scrambled the eggs the first 2 times, but now get it right every time. Very tasty recipe. Makes enough for ~6 servings

Turned our perfectly - I loved the extra complexity from the vinegar. Great recipe.

If it curdles your heat was too high or you did not whisk enough. The lemon juice amount is spot on, I hate bland overly greasy hollandaise with no flavor! Just make sure to salt and white pepper enough.

This was a really quick and yummy sauce.I used white balsamic and like others chose to use half of the butter. This made for a thicker sauce but also allowed more control over the quantity when serving it. I skipped the cayenne as I didn't want to overwhelm the other flavours in both the sauce and the eggs benny.

I can't believe the number of people who cook with salted butter- one person claimed it was accidental- sure it was. Everybody changes the recipe thinking they'll make it better- paprika in this sauce? are you nuts? You're not cooks- you're just copying a recipe because you don't know how to do it yourself- just follow the recipe.

Great recipe and felt pretty simple. Successfully made Eggs Benedict at home! I used only 1 tbsp vinegar (tarragon vinegar made it extra tasty) and also halved to 1 tbsp lemon juice. Added 2 drops of black truffle oil at the end to round the taste--not essential but yummy. Only complaint was that it's a tad thin--probably need to whisk eggs longer next time before adding butter. All in all, a winner!

I think that this hollandaise technique is the way to go--no double boiler or blender, just one simple pan. I have made this twice so far, and even though I scaled the vinegar back the second time, I will use even less next time. Also, as many others have said, just a squeeze of lemon is enough. This sauce was so stable that I was even able to let it sit for a few minutes and reheat a bit without any curdling or breaking.

My son begged me to make eggs benedict and I had to admit I had never made hollandaise before. I found this recipe and it was just perfect. The only change I made based on previous reviewers' comments was reducing the lemon juice to 1 tbsp.

When making hollandaise in the past, it has always been with trepidation as it seems to come out curdled no matter how hard I try. This recipe was a snap to fix and came out perfect!!! - though I did add a bit more of cayenne for the taste. I'll use it again in the future.

I used half of the butter that this recipe calls for, and also about two tablespoons of cream. The vinegar reduction at the beginning also makes a difference. This sauce was very flavorful!

Definitely my go-to recipe for Hollandaise from now on. I used to use the Knorr mix (heresy, I know!) but I now cook gluten-free so I turned to homemade. Wish I had years ago - this is so much better and not too difficult. I used a lot less lemon (one squeeze, that's it), based on the other reviews - 2 Tbsp would have been way too much. My husband raved about it!

Very tasty, although a bit tart if the proper amount of lemon juice is used. Embarrassingly, I used rice vinegar since I didn't have white wine vinegar on hand and substituted paprika for the cayenne, and it was still delicious!

Made this hollandaise with my reindeer sausage eggs benedict for a breakfast meeting of my design firm-WONDERFUL. As previous people have said, scaling back the lemon juice, cayenne and vinegar is a good idea-I also added a bit of saffron (for color and taste) and about 1/2 tsp white truffle oil to balance all the tartness from the vinegar and lemon juice. The second time I made it, I also added finely grated parmegiano reggiano, which complemented the already rich sauce even further.

Wonderful! As others have said I cut them lemon juice (1.5 tablesppons). I substituted chipotle paste/puree for the cayenne pepper as I wanted a Chipotle Hollandaise. I served it over steak, eggs and green chile grits to rave reviews.

By far the most perfect, sublime Holladaise I have ever tasted. I did use only one tablespoon of vinegar and substituted Sriracha chili sauce for the cayenne. Delicious!

I am glad that I took the advice of the others who tested this recipe, do not add as much cayenne and lemon, turned out great!

It was a bit "lemony" for our taste, but might be nice with some asparagus.

Go look at the blender hollandaise recipe on this site. That recipe is much easier, practically foolproof, and has great consistency and taste.

I thought this was very good. I to used salted butter before I read the other reviews. Yikes! I had to add more lemon to disguise the salt. I like a lot of lemon. I added just a touch of cayenne more for color in the sauce even though I like spicey, I didn't think more spice was needed for this sauce because I used enough white pepper.

3/4 teaspoon of cayenne? It was way too much. In retrospect, the text apparently meant to add *each* of the lemon juice, cayenne and salt "to taste" rather than as-phrased, which is literally add the lemon juice, cayenne, and then add the salt to taste. (at least as I read it).

I also used salted butter, and simply eliminated the added salt. I've also found that scaling back the vinegar and lemon juice about 25% (or adding an additional yolk) helps the balance. Otherwise, a simple recipe for an elegant sauce.

I accidentally used salted instead of unsalted butter and I believe it made an already salty recipe even saltier. I dilluted the sauce with cream and another egg yolk and this neutralized the extreme salty flavor. With this modification, I thought the recipe produced a good sauce with relative ease. However, even with unsalted butter, I would be cautious with the salt next time.
