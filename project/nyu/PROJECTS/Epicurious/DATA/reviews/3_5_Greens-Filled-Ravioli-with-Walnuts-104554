This is a master recipe, to do with what you will...depending on what you have on hand. I do recommend fresh wrappers, from an oriential grocer - not the overpriced and overthick stuff they sell in the grocery shops. Fresh makes the difference. I look forward to rainy days when I settle down and wrap and roll. Freezing the little pockets is easy (on waxed paper) til firm, then tumbling into a ziploc. It's great to have delicious homemade food from your freezer to wow unexpected guests! p.s. Escarole needs to be more finely chopped than spinach, given it's texture. You can take these dumplings any way around the world you want just by tweaking the seasonings and the sauce.

I made this with 3/4 lb escarole and 1/4 lb spinach due to random leftovers, etc., and omitted the cheese and instead added fresh toasted bread crumbs (which quickly became untoasted) so i could serve to a vegan roommate and vegetarian coworker. i also added a bunch of toasted pine nuts in the filling, rather than walnuts at the end. i thought it was great, except without the cheese it was very lemony. my question is: why do my ravioli come out rubbery with the won ton wrappers (i used the thick ones but have used thin ones before)? i wonder if pasta dough would be the way to go here.

I found the swiss chard to be too bitter and it poked holes in the wrappers. Spinach would be better. Loved the sweet potato ravioli recipe on this site though. By the way, using wonton wrappers is a great easy shortcut, and this is coming from a girl who has a pasta machine.

Gyoza skins are not the same as won ton skins. Used for dumplings, they are much thinner.

This dish was super yummy. I had no problems with the thickness of the wonton wrappers. I didn't use the full amount of the cheese, but that left it too lemony, so if you use less cheese, you should probably also use less lemon. We finished it with a little walnut oil for good luck.

I have made this several times and each time it turns out wonderfully. I would not try it with won ton wrappers (too thick). I add butter to the sauce and use pine nuts instead of walnuts. Made it most recently for a Christmas luncheon and couldn't find swiss chard so improvised with mustard greens and spinach. It was wonderful. If you flute the goyzo wrappers and sprinkle a little roated pepper over the plate you have a beautiful presentation. Always a big hit!

Poor Joan @ brightnet has no imagination - I wonder if she asks restaurants for pictures instead of looking at the menu!

This recipe was VERY yummy. We used red chard instead of swiss chard. It added a burgandy hue. We used wonton wrappers and a bit of eggwhite to seal them. No causalties. My husband and I had fun stuff the raviolis together.

This was wonderful! We served it with a salad of baby greens with a raspberry/avocado oil vinaigrette. We also had a Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand. It was a very enjoyable meal.

Didn't try it. I need to see pictures of recipes before I try them. Thank You. Joan

I made a recipe very similar to this one, using fresh spinach, and adding some crumbled feta cheese to the filling. There is really no substitute for sheets of fresh pasta. The wonton wrappers come in at a very distant second place. My advice is to make or buy sheets of fresh pasta if you are going to go to the trouble of making this recipe.
