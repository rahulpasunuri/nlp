Not sure why Janice thought this dish was fried--there is only a teaspoon of oil per tortilla to keep it from sticking. You can easily sub cooking spray if you're worried about the oil, but a teaspoon of oil in a dish won't hurt anyone.

This is so quick and easy and you do not need oil in a non-stick skillet. You can alter this many ways, I toss a tortilla into a hot pan, shred some Reggiano parmesan, sprinkle some garlic and spices, a few tsp of salsa, corn, any toppings you like and cook for about 2 minutes, the cheese gets hot and bubble and you're done. So quick when you are in a time crunch or for a quick healthy snack or appetizer. Like a Mexican pizza.

the flavour is good,the fact that it is fried is not so good.
