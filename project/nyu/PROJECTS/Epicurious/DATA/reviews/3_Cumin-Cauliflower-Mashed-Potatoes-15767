Cauliflower lends a great bit of texture and some green, light notes to the otherwise earthy potatoes. Key is to use the best, freshest potatoes and especially cauliflower you can find. This is equally good with cumin or wasabi, depending on your palate.

I was just looking for a substitute for mashed potatoes when I came across this. Didn't use the spices but used everything else - turned out just great. Tasted like true mashed potatoes - would never have guessed it was 1/2 cauliflower.

My husband, neighbors, and I all loved this when I made it as a "base" for lamb stew. I roasted the cauliflower as suggested and then pureed in the cuisinart. Yummy! I made it a seond time but didn't have any buttermilk, so I used 2% milk and lemon juice. My husband loved it. Love the cauliflower flavor in the potatoes!

This sounded really tasty and I was not disappointed. However, I added 2 t. butter instead of using oil. Delicious!

This is definitely at risk of being bland but the cilantro is much more than a garnish... Plus, I roasted the cauliflower in cumin and garlic first which added a nutty finish to the mash. Next time I'm thinking of a bit of chipotle or something but I'd definitely make it again.

I thought this was a very different twist on plain old mashed potatoes. Next time I would prepare in advance and then re-heat in oven - I think the consistency would be closer to mashed potatoes.

The only reason to make this recipe is because you can eat mashed potatoes guilt free. My husband loves this recipe and he can't stand cooked cauliflower. I make these in the mixer, just be careful, because you might not need more than 1/4 cup of the buttermilk. These are fast, easy and a good way to painlessly eat cauliflower. I forgot to drizzle them with oil, might be good.

Generally, my family likes anything flavoured with cumin. This recipe, however, was a huge disappointment. Bland, flavourless & dull & as one reviewer pointed out, the cooking times were way off. How on earth could this recipe make it into the 'Best of 1999' list ? Perhaps I did something wrong, but I won't try this again.

The simmering time was not nearly enough time...and neither the potatoes nor the cauliflower mashed properly. I didn't much like the addition of cumin either but that may have been because it didn't distribute properly. I have leftovers and I think I'll make it into potato cakes.

An excellent and easy recipe. I couldn't find nonfat buttermilk so I used low fat. I served this with some vermouth saute'd boneless pork chops and fresh peas and a nice Chardonney. I also left the skins on the potatoes but would probably peel them for company, just for looks.
