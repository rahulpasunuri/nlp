This recipe offers a tantalizing array of flavors and textures: crunchy, chewy, crackly, sweet, astringint, spicy, bright, umami, and probably a bunch of others I'm not thinking of at the moment. The key to this recipe is that it really is best eaten right when it's made; the leftovers didn't really shine. The only thing different I did is that I used duck fat for the frying since I had some on hand. Also, my peach went bad, so I had it without it. I decided on the sweet chile dipping sauce, but completely spaced when I was making it, so I just mixed all the ingredients together and poured some "dressing" over the salad. Over, this was one of the most unique recipes I've ever tasted. I'm still amazed that one recipe can touch so masny areas of your mouth and brain at once. I can't wait to make it for guests!!!

Good recipe, but I would make a few substitutions. I would recommend ground pork instead of the duck, and I used Hoisin sauce which added some needed flavor. A bong hit or two doesn't hurt.
