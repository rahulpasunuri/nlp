this was a very moist and light cake. And yes very crumbly. I also boiled the crannberries in a little Grand Marnier and water with a little orange zest and a dash of nutmeg. I layered some of the topping in the cake with the rest on top. My whole family liked the cake and since my teenage son had 2 big pieces I would definetely make it again. Maybe next time for guests.

An easy, quick and tasty cake, and best of all, my friends thought it was delicious! If using dried cranberries (Cranraisins worked well) always hydrate in boiling water for less than a minute. Also, I added the zest of a half a lemon which perked things up. Lastly, I sprinkled half the sugar,cinnamon, walnut mixture in the bottom of the pan, then the other half sprinkle on top of batter, pressing down to adhere. It's a keeper.

This is a good recipe and I would absolutely make it again. A few notes I had, I used a tablespoon of cinnamon and poured all the sugar into the cake itself. Also don't use prepackaged dried cranberries! They are so dry and only hurt this recipe. Use bulk cranberries that aren't dried to a crisp, the taste is SO much better that way. Happy eating!!

This recipe makes a moist and sweet cake. I used Splenda in place of the sugar and since I did not have buttermilk, I used 1 T. of lemon juice added to 8 oz. of skim milk. I agree the cake crumbles easily but it tastes good and the cranberries make a pretty presentation.

I make this every year for Christmas morning - the perfect snack while opening stockings!

This cake was nice but nothing special. Easy to make. It was very moist and delicate (but crumbled easily as others noted).

Very disappointing. On the dry side. Very bland but sweet. Would not make again.

Yummy! My whole family loved it. I also added more cranberries, mixing dried with some leftover fresh that I had. It had a good combination of tart and sweet.

I will make this cake again, but next time I will double or triple the amount of cranberries and swirl or layer in the cinnamin sugar through out the cake

This is a very tasty breakfast cake but I found it very fragile and easy to fall apart. This can cause problems in the mornings with sleepy heads. Instead of baking it in a bundt pan, I poured it into a large loaf pan to facilitate removal and cutting but still had trouble with its delicacy.

Wonderful!! My guests raved about this very moist and tender breakfast cake. I served it for brunch. A glaze of orange juice, butter, a dash of salt, and powdered sugar over the warm cake added a lot of extra flavor. This cake is in my recipe box and on my favorite list.

I have been making this cake ever since I read the recipe in 1996. It is great with coffee at breakfast or in the afternoon. I use Craisins and put the topping in between two layers of the batter for a nice swirl effect. I found it didn't want to stick to the top. The buttermilk really makes this a special cake.

I thought this was very good. Made it during the holiday season. It was very easy and delicious. My guest asked for the recipe.

Quick and easy to prepare. Moist, slightly sweet. People at work enjoyed it during morning break. It was fine for this, but I would not serve it for a holiday brunch. Good, but not outstanding.
