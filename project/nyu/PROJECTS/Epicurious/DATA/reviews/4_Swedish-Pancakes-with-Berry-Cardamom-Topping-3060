I also left the cardamon out. I tried a little with a little batter & didn't like it. I only mix well with a wire wisk and used salted butter as I didn't have unsalted. Easy and delicious. I also strain some lingonberry and make Lingonberry butter to go with it. That stores well in the frig for a long time.

easy to make and excellent. it's the sauce that distinguishes this dish, and the cardamom is crucial. I've made this recipe several times with different berries, sometimes using rhubarb.

Also delicious rolled up and filled like crepes. I nixed the berry topping and whipped up some cream cheese, honey and peach puree.

The family likes this recipe. The topping is where you can have fun. We have tried candied apples and nutella... both are good (but I would not recommend together). This recipe is not like Old Pancake House's swedish pancakes (which is what I was looking for), but more like a crepe.

Great recipe. I didn't have any 1/2 & 1/2 or cardamom so I skipped them. I mixed it all in a big liquid measuring cup with an imersion blender. Super easy cleanup & very nice versatile crepe.

Just like my Swedish uncle makes them. Yum! (I just used the base recipe and left out the cardamom)

So delicious, and so easy to make! The flipping takes a little practice, but the results are heavenly even when not picture perfect. Made it once with the cardamom and once without. Good both ways, but I think the cardamom really complements the flavor of the lingonberry jam we used (instead of this topping).

Made only the pancakes; skipped the cardamom because I didn't have any and used all milk because I didn't have half and half. They were thin and delicious with a lovely creaminess in the center. We topped with fruit preserves and hot fudge. Easy and quick.

I currently live in Sweden and am on a milk free/dairy free diet. I made this recipe with the exception of leaving out the cardammom (I have never had pancakes in Sweden with it!), but substituted the milk and half and half for OATLY (a milk substitute) and the butter with milk free margarine. No one in my family could tell the difference between this pancakes and the real milk style pancakes... I will definitely do them again!

I absolutely love the large plate-sized Swedish pancakes at the Original Pancake House and this was a very adequate homemade substitute. I made larger pancakes (like crepes), omitted the scandalous cardamom, and topped with different kinds of jam. Yummy!

These are great! I have to admit, I improvised a little. I made the pancakes exactly as is (but slightly bigger). However, I wanted a warm topping because I really hate cold pancakes and fresh fruit always seems to cool them too much. So I used the rasperry topping (substituted 1/2 tsp. cardamom for the brandy) and sauteed apples from the "Thick Apple Pancakes With Raspberry Sauce" which can also be found on this website. I put a small mound of the fried apples on a plate, surrounded them with a few spoonfuls of sauce, and then placed five pakcakes (folded into quarters) on top of the sauce around the apples. I made these because my boyfriend wanted Swedish pancakes for his birthday, but I definitely enjoyed them as well. I'm sure the recipe would be great as written; pancakes that are not piping hot are just one of my pet peeves!

I made the pancakes (but skipped the topping) as directed except I just beat with a fork in a bowl (didn't want to take the Cuisinart out) and they were fantastic, every bit as good as the ones at the little authentic Swedish pancake restaurants in my neighborhood. The cardamom was nice, not overpowering at all.

I am Swedish, born and bred, and the recipe is fine but nontradtitional as the cardamom is not typically added to pancakes. And, we NEVER add leavening to cause the pancakes to rise as Swedish pancakes are more like French crepes. They are NOT to be fluffy like American pancakes; if you want those get a mix. I did try it with the cardamom and it was OK but I prefer my pancakes without cardamom. Also, the most typical toppings are: lingonberries, cloudberries, or fresh strawberries with whipped cream. As kids we sometimes ate them with just a sprinkling of granulated sugar. And, by the way, it's OK to use maple syrup if you like! You can also use the same recipe (sans cardamom) to make savory crepes filled with things like creamed chicken, creamed mushrooms, or a creamed seafood medley. If you do that roll them up and lay them side by side, seamed side down in a buttered oven-proof dish; sprinkle with grated Swiss cheese and put into 450 oven for 20 minutes, yum!!

I made the pancakes without the sauce accompaniment. Although the pancakes were nice I would add a little more cardamom for extra flavor (if you are not using the sauce which already has extra cardamom) and would recommend adding some baking soda to get them to rise. I do not recommend serving this with maple syrup as the syrup's sugary flavor all but wipes out the delicate notes of the cardamom. Good recipe just needs a little tweak.

I really liked the texture and taste of the pancake. It is excellent with the berry sauce. I would make it agian.

To the cook who thought it was worse than putting pine needles in the mouht because of the cardemum; you ARE supposed to read a recipe before actually making it; if you don't like cardemum, why did you bother to make it. I thought it was delishhhhh - and the cardemum gives that authentic flavour. We had them with cherry preserves though; didn't have any other berries at home..

similar to my crepe recipe-just as delicious without the 45 minute refrigeration waiting time. I would make again. We had lemon,blackcurrant preserves and powdered sugar with these and of course strong coffee.

With this recipe I finally outdid my Swedish mother-in-law. Makes great pancakes (use a crepe pan) and the cardamom gives it an authentic Swedish flavor (which you can delete if you not too fond of it as it can be strong.) Even more authentic would be to use lingonberry topping if you can get it.

Just like my grandmothers recipe! The portions can be changed so it is easier to remember: 3,2,1... 3 eggs, 2 cups milk, 1 cup flour. Then a dash of salt and cardamom. The melted butter and half and half are not needed. It tastes the same without! Just use melted butter or PAM in the pan

The cardamom was interesting.
