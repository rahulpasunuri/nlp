Pretty close to the pepparkakor in the red tin! These are delicious but the cookies stick in your teeth a bit. Could be because I used Lyle's Golden Syrup instead of corn syrup. Other subs: quatre epices (pepper, mace, ginger, cardamom) with a dash of cloves, and waxed paper instead of a pin cloth. A bit of dusting flour minimizes the sticking to the waxed paper, and freezing the sheet of dough allows you to peel the paper off. It also makes it easier to get the cut-out cookies onto the baking sheet. Bakes up just as described... fun to watch!

These are the real deal - like my Swedish inlaws make. The secret is to make them as thin as possible. I roll the dough between two pieces of wax paper, remove the top layer and put the dough in the freezer for a few minutes. This makes it easy to use the cookie cutters and peal the cut cookies right off the wax paper.

Rather than rolling this dough, each quarter of the dough can be rolled into a log before chilling. Later, slice about 1/4 inch thick, and flatten each cookie with the bottom of a large glass or jar that has been dipped into sugar. You can always place a blanched almond or pecan half in the center of each cookie.

I used dark molasses instead of dark corn syrup, as that is what I had on hand. I tried rolling some of the dough out after 3 hours chilling, and it was an enormous mess. Left the rest of the dough in the fridge another 2 days, returned to it, and rolled it out without any trouble. Just dusted flour on the counter and they rolled out beautifully, no sticking. These are delicious cookies! Watch them closely though, and don't let them burn. They don't taste very good when burned! I did not bother with the almond slivers, and would add cardamom and white pepper to the spices next time. excellent recipe, but make sure you chill the dough long enough. These remind me of speculaas, which I am always craving.

Thank you, thank you, thank you! I have been looking all over for this recipe ever since the precious tin of pepper cookies I bought in Sweden in May has run out. They are a teatime favorite.

These cookies are just right -- easy and delicious. Dress them up or down. Use them to dress up other desserts.

Delicious! I baked mine on Silpats and used the pastry cloth and rolling pin cover and didn't have any problems with sticking. I was able to get them paper thin and they are delicate and tasty. Well worth the extra bit of effort!

Pepparkakors are a perennial Christmas time favorite in our family. If you follow the recipe closely, use a pastry cloth, a rolling-pin cover, and keep unused dough in the refrigerator, you should have no problem rolling them out. We all try to see who can make the thinnest cookies.

These were great cookies. My kids loved them!

My grandmother is Swedish but is aging and beyond her baking days. I make a batch every two months, freeze half the dough, and mail her half a batch each month using seasonal cookie cutters. She loves sharing them with her friends at tea time. Its a joy for both of us as long as my husband doesn't eat them first. They are great with vanilla ice cream.

The cookies were pretty tasty, but unless I did something wrong, this dough was TOO hard to work with. The dough got soft so fast that it was almost impossible to work with (not a good recipe to make with my 3 year old!). Because I had doubled the recipe (and was so weary from the "fussiness" of the dough), I finally rolled the remaining dough into logs and put it into the freezer to be sliced and baked later. Frankly, I did not see the advantage of these cookies over basic gingerbread cookies, sorry to say.

My family had been looking for a recipe for these since Mom bought a box a couple years ago. Somehow we all missed the recipe in 1998 -- thank heavens Gourmet reprinted it in 1999 as part of its collection of classic holiday cookies! I was out of dark corn syrup, so I substituted 3 Tb molasses topped off with light corn syrup; a little New World for a traditional European recipe, but the color and flavor of the cookies came out fine. I also recommend buying fresh jars of spices for the best flavor. Store-bought pepparkakor are good, but homemade ones are GREAT -- thank you for sharing, Ms Boothe and Ms Shinn!
