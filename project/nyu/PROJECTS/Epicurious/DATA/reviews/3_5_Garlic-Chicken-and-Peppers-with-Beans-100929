Made this on a lark. It was delicious! I wish I had more broth simply because it is so good. I did use larger/thicker pieces of chicken so I baked it until it was the correct temperature - about 40 minutes. But I can see with smaller pieces the suggested cooking time would have been fine. It was excellent and I will make it again.

I used half as much oil, half as much rubbed sage and boneless, skinless chicken breasts with excellent results. (I shredded the chicken before serving.) In the future, I'll use less chicken (still boneless, skinless) and more beans.

I don't know whether it was the recipe or myself since I am not known for my culinary skills, but I made this last night according to the recipe and it was very bland and flavorless. I should have added a little more seasoning perhaps? I used fresh sage from my garden and chicken legs and thighs. It took about an extra 40 minutes to get the chicken fully cooked. If you do make this recipe, follow what the other posts say and add a little personal touch to it. That might help. I will not be making this again.

My husband and I loved this recipe. The only thing different in my version was using somewhere between 1/4 & 1/2 tsp of cayennne pepper. The flavor was amazing. I also did not use anywhere near the amount of olive oil suggested... just enough to cover the bottom of the pan. This is definitely a keeper!

I had some white beans left over and looked up recipes to use them with. I made this with what I had on hand..5 drumsticks and 2 chicken breasts. I did dnot have any dry white wine so I used Marsalla cooking wine. This was the most delicious meal. I was pleasanltly surprised. Next time I will use thighs and drumsticks because the breasta were a little dry. But this is definitely a keeper. A great hearty meal I will cook again.

We really enjoyed this dish. I made it pretty much according to the recipe, but, instead of a whole jointed chicken, I used 4 drumsticks and 4 thighs. At just over 2 lbs this fed 4 people perfectly. The only other change was that I more than doubled the garlic. Like previous cooks, I tried the technique of setting aside the chicken and beans and reducing the sauce and it worked very well. I served it with potatoes roasted in goose fat (actually quite healthy and very yummy). Certainly a keeper for a family dinner.

This worked out well for me because I had chicken thighs, dried beans I wanted to use up, and red and orange bell peppers that were starting to get wrinkly in the crisper. I made it in the crock pot and soaked the mixed dried beans overnight first. Sauteed the garlic with the peppers - and no, you DON'T need 1/4 c of oil - and left out the white wine. Added more chicken broth instead, and threw in some leftover Mexican rice. It turned out great and my house smelled wonderful when I came inside from three degree weather.

This was very easy to make and delicious for a mid week dinner. My boyfriend loved it and raves about the sauce. I did as the recipe suggested and removed the chicken and beans and reduced the liquid till it was more sauce-like, then poured it over top. This was very hearty...no need for anything else except maybe a green salad.

I thought that this dish was great comfort food. But, not that impressive for company. It remained too soupy after leaving it in the oven for the recommended time. I rated it high, but I don't think I will make it again. I think that it would be a prefect family dish though especially on a cold winter night.

This was a wonderful dish. My husband loved it as well. I made it with split chicken breasts and wings (what I had on hand), and served it with garlic mashed potatos and peas. I added some extra spices as others suggested and I thickened the broth at the end with cornstarch. Also, I used chick peas and dried thyme. Yummy and very filling!

Tasty, colourful and easy. I didn't serve over rice as in the review - crusty French bread worked fine for me. It's quite senseless to substitute "boneless skinless chicken breasts" -- the byword for dry-as-dust cardboard tastelessness -- for a whole cut-up chicken, then complain about tastelessness. Try preparing the recipe as written - after all, that's why we read the reviews.

it is really really really really good

Excellent flavor and texture. Adding rice would add a little more bulk that my husband would like, but I felt it is great the way it is. I will definitely add this to my list of favorite recipes, and make it often.

I made this with skinless boneless chicken breasts (and a little less oil - a quarter cup is far too much!). I also left out the red kidney beans; I think they're a bit too dry for this recipe, they go better with beef dishes. But on the whole it was quite good. I'll make it again.

This is a great chicken recipe. I used a whole chicken cut-up and baked the dish for an hour. Season the chicken when browning to add flavor to the chicken and the broth. The juices are delicious - I served with a good bread.

Blah ... I used boneless breasts like many others and it felt like I was eating boiled chicken it had no taste. The sauce tasted ok when I dipped my bread in it but the chicken was absolutely uneventful ... I won't bother to make it again.

Excellent dish. I used skinless/boneless chicken breast and served it over brown rice. Next time, I might try thyme instead of sage and I will use an extra red pepper as they really complemented the dish.

I didn't think this would have much flavor since there aren't very many ingredients, but my family loved it - my 10 year old son asked for seconds! I cut up the chicken after it was cooked and thickened the broth with arrowroot. I served it over wide egg noodles like a stew. This is certainly a keeper.

What a great recipe! My family loved it and told me to be sure to make it again soon. The only changes I made were to use boneless chicken breasts and thighs. I also added a little of Emeril's Essence for a little more zest. I served it with rice, a green salad and pita bread wedges.

I made this dish last night and received rave reviews!! I modified a bit by adding a sliced chili pepper, using boneless breasts, and skipping the first round of baking. I'll definitely make this again (and can't wait to eat the leftovers ...right now!)

We had this last night and thought it was excellent. My husband and I tend to like hot peppers and don't particularly care for sage, so I added jalapenos and crushed red pepper and a sliced onion and omitted the sage. I also minced the garlic and sauteed with the other veggies. We will definitely have this one again.

I MADE THIS LAST NIGHT...IT WAS A VERY GOOD COMBINATION, HOWEVER, I WOULD DOUBLE THE SPICES IN IT BECAUSE IT WAS ALMOST A LITTLE BLAND. I WOULD TRY IT AGAIN.

This was a great family meal! Just enough spice. I served it with rice, tortilas and a small ceasar salad.

This recipe looked great in black & white, but I thought it turned out to be pretty mundane (although innocuous) when prepared.

The combination was delicious, think I would go without the beans the next time, I used chicken breast instead of a whole chicken.
