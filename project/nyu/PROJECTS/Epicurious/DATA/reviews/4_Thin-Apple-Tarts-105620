good, super easy, very quick recipe...it's fine on its own but when reducing the lemon-sugar-apple water, throw in some peeled chopped ginger and boil down while baking the tarts to get a glaze with a really good kick.

This was a delicious end to a meal, however, it reminded me of toaster strudels, so may be better off as a breakfast item.

These are so delicious and easy! When I discovered the recipe a few weeks ago, I must confess that I made them three out of four nights!! They seem to vanish instantly. They are fabulous.

Delicious. I rolled the pastry to about 11" then cut into quarters. The apples went nicely into 2 rows (I used 2 large apples) and there was no wasted pastry. Easy, impressive.

It turned out quite well, but the next time, I wouldn't roll the pastry out quite so thin. I would have liked a little more puff in my pastry.

My guests and husband were enthusiatic. My husband ,later, said he would have liked more apple on the tarts.
