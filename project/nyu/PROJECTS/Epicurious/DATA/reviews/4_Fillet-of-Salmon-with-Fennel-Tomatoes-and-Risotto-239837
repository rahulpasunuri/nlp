i substituted some chicken stock for the clam juice as well. I also did not have spinach and steamed some zucchini instead. Also substitute fresh basil for tarragon. Even with all that, it was excellent. And I used a cooker for the risotto.

Proportion of ingredients and flavors seemed off to me. Not quite as good as I was hoping although ok.

even diluted 50/50 the clam juice was over powering

This was an excellent meal that came together fairly quickly. Perfect way to use salmon on a crisp fall night. The whole family ate it up and wanted more.

excellent! reduced clam juice (prob did 1.5 cups, used chicken broth for rest). the fennel/tomato, the risotto, the salmon...such a great combo of flavors.

This was a fantastic way to prepare salmon! I used half clam juice and half vegetable broth for the risotto - v. good!!

Made this with steelhead trout, and it was excellent.

This was one of the best dinners I've ever made. I followed others' leads and also used less clam juice and replaced with water and then with wine and water in the final vegetable saute, and it was fine. My boyfriend, who is by far the best cook I know and who is also not a very "hearty" eater, asked for seconds - he's never done that before so I know it was good!

This is delicious! The quantity of clam juice scared me so I replaced 30% of it with water. The risotto was still intense, but it was an excellent complement to the salmon and fennel side dish, and the recipe calls for a small amount of risotto per serving, so it works. The fennel side was delicious, and overall, the combination of flavors was fantastic.

Nice flavors, but I substituted one cup of water for clam juice in the risotto to keep it from being too overpowering.

A good recipe. The salmon is unadorned and must be of the highest quality. The fennel needed more than 3 minutes, and next time I will start with the fennel and add the tomatoes later.

Fantastic. I loved the combination of flavors. The simple risotto with the vegetables and broth was lovely.
