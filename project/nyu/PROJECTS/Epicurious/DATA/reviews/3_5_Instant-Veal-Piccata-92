Oops, forgot to mention I added a little lemon juice too!

I made this with veal steaks, doubled the recipe and added the au jous, a bit of vinegar from the capers, and a little more butter and MmmMmm! Delicious!

I was not at all impressed with this recipe. I found it a little too runny and not flavorful enough.

definitely quick, but i think it was missing something.

Great, simple recipe. I was looking for something to go with a risotto dish and this was perfect. I added about 1/4 cup of cream to finish it and I tossed in about 1/4 cup of toasted pine nuts--both welcome additions.

This is a great recipe. I didn't have veal this time, so I made it with fresh sole. Excellent! The sauce complemented the delicate flavor of the sole. I plan to try it with chicken also. I also wonder how it would taste made with fresh salmon? Maybe I'll experiment with that since my husband just returned from a salmon fishing trip to Alaska with 60 lbs. of silver salmon.

This is very good. As Christine said, you probably have most of the ingredients on hand. Made it with Turkey and got rave reviews. Sprinkled the Turkey with Wondra to start with. Mixed butter with oil to start and used more garlic than they called for (discarded the garlic later). Use the full tablespoon of butter at the end. It makes the flavor. Would work well with anything!

Very quick to make, and flavors are rich. Served with spaghetti with pesto sauce, and the combination was an intense experience.

Good and very quick. A nice meal with just a few ingredients that are probably in the fridge already.

The best piccata recipe in your file. I make it with chicken breasts for a quick weeknight supper or I use veal when entertaining. My wife said its better than most restaurant offerings she's tasted.
