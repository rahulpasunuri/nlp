This recipe was pretty easy. The gnocchi are quite good. I found the pesto to be a bit bitter, but good anyway. It was quick to make and tasty. Might try with basil pesto next time.

This dish deserves 3.5 stars. The recipe took less than an hour to put together and the gnocchi was pretty forgiving. I had a minor deviation: I didn't use all the herbs. Though I'm experienced making pasta, it was my first time attempting gnocchi and I didn't want to spend $10 on herbs for something I was unsure of. I used just sage and spinach instead. Great fresh and garlicy pesto, and the gnocchi was substantial, but not heavy. Will make again.
