I dislike when people change recipes, but happenstance lead me to a great Christmas version of this dish. For a cocktail party, I used red bliss potatoes and roasted them per the recipe (put the olive oil and freshly ground sea salt on your baking sheet to keep the potatoes from sticking). Then I loaded a cake decorating tool with sour cream and a star tip and kept it in the fridge till serving time. Arrange the cooked potatoes on a serving platter, plop a star of sour cream on top and drizzle with prepared pesto. Festive & delicious!

What a great, easy recipe! The cooking time for the potatoes is perfect. We doubled the amount and used this as part of a holiday cocktail buffet for 50. Very festive! Have now used several of the recipes in this menu (smoked trout spread, pork loin, mashed turnips) and all of them have been good enough to become stand-bys. A definite keeper!

I made this with baby reds for a party because I couldn't find fingerlings. Guests raved and gobbled them up! For such a small effort, these made a big impact. I used inexpensive caviar and low-fat sour cream and they still tasted decadent. This one's a keeper.

Perfectly simple and decadent. The potatoes would be great on there own. Don't skip the fresh rosemary. It adds a wonderful aromatic note. We served them on a platter pre-assembled as shown in the photo. I did not want guests to have to do the work!

Wonderful! I used petit red potatoes and my guests (and I) just loved these. YUM!

We made this for New Year's, prebaked the potatoes ahead of time and reheated them for a few minutes in a 400 degree oven. It was a hit and the potatoes disappeared!

Yum, yum, yum. Easy and fabulous. The caviar adds just the right touch of salt. My potatoes didn't take the full 35 minutes to bake - I just kept an eye on them. Actual baking time was more like 25 minutes.

I used red potatoes, sour cream and good quality caviar ($30 per ounce). I cooked the potatoes at 425 for 45 minutes and they were nice and crunchy on the outside and smooth and creamy on the inside. The sour cream and caviar gave it a nice salty/crunchy texture. My friend ate every one. I would definately make it again and it would be good for breakfast or as an appetizer too!

This is like potato pancakes with caviar and sour creme ....but BETTER!!>>they were perfect. I wanted to present the caviar in bowl on ice with the creme fresh... I was too big and awkward. I took a small white porcelin tart dish and I put a layer if the creme on the bottom and then spooned the caviar on the top! ONE DISH on ice chips... It also made it look like I had more caviar than I bought... everyone thought it was so elagant and they ate it all of course . A++

have made this the last two Christmases to great acclaim. The potatoes are fantastic, and you needn't serve top-shelf caviar -- cheap caviar is better than no caviar --simple and delicious

Works just as advertised. Very good, very easy. Works best with the potatoes still warm, so heat the serving platter, and double-bowl the creme fraiche to keep it chilled. Don't worry about expensive caviar; I used the stuff from Trader Joe's, and it was just fine. This is a really good app.
