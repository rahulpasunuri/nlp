I roasted the potatoes separately for 10 minutes then added the asparagus in another pan and roasted them all for an additional 10 minutes. Yummy! Served it with a huge green salad.

This is a great dish. I made it for a friend and she liked it so much that she made it twice the next week.

I cooked the dish for 15 min and found that the potatoes weren't cooked enough but the asparagus were begining to burn. I took the asparagus out and put the potatoes back in the oven for 10 min until cooked. then remixed it all. The dish was basic and bland but my family liked it. I will cut the potatoes smaller next time so it cooks thoroughly.

I added whole garlic cloves too - and they were better than the potatoes! Next time I'd use 2 whole bulbs. Needs lots of seasoning.

I thought this was an excellent "base" recipe. I added whole cloves of garlic and roasted them as well with the vegetables. Sometimes I vary this recipe and roast red peppers with it. A good seasoning for the base recipe alone is Lemon Pepper.

If you are looking for a healthy way to roast vegtables this is fine, but there really wasn't much flavor. I cooked the potatoes and the asparagus separately also.

15 minutes is about right for the potatoes but too much for the asparagus. Place in separate pans and roast the asparagus for 8 to 10 minutes tops.
