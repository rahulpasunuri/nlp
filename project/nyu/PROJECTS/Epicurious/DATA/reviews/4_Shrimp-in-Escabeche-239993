This was a big hit at our last party. Due to time constraints, I made this Thursday night for a Saturday evening party. The extra time marinating in the refrigerator allowed the flavors to seep in deeply and made the dish much, much better.

It is important to mix the marinade very well and let the shrimp sit in the marinade. The recipe says 12 hours but we had to let it sit (in a covered dish in the frig') for 24 hours due to our busy lives. The extra time allows the marinade to really seep into the shrimp. Both my spicy-food-loving fiance' and my mild-food-loving in laws liked this recipe.

Very easy and very tasty. Definitely was a crowd pleaser and I agree with other reviewers--this is a mild dish.

Very bland. I added lemon juice, oregano and basil and served with salsa to liven it up.

Excellent, very tasty does not overwhelm the shrimp. Good for setting out as the vinegar preserves the shrimp

I was all excited to get a 4 fork recipe but when I tried it, I wasn't wowed. The marinade was a little too subtle. I was hoping for a bit more flavor. It would be good on top of a tossed salad.

Really easy, healthy and deliscious. Just have to remember to start the day before.

This was very tasty. I had trouble waiting th full 12 hours - I kept sneaking shrimp when I stirred it! The only thing I thought was missing was a bit of heat. Will probably add either hot chili oil or some crushed red pepper to it nexttime.. which will be soon!

Awesome recipe. the only thing i had to change was that i only had apple cider vinegar, otherwise everything else was according to the recipe. oh, and i used cooked shrimp but marinated it for over 12 hrs...absolutely fantastic!..a nice change from the usual shrimp cocktail with ketchup/h'radish sauce...will make again and again...this one is a keeper...We LOVED this!!

this was a great fresh way to do shrimp. I would make it again and serve on fresh herb salade with avacado.

The texture oand taste of these shrimp were excellent - it reminded me of ceviche.
