this is amazing IF you reduce the oilive oil by A LOT... i pack everything into the blender and add about 1/3 of a cup of olive oil and start it up - i add only enough olive oil to get this to a loose paste then stop - delicious - don't forget the salt and pepper - also makes a big difference - i serve this with the grilled spicy skirt steak - http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Grilled-Spicy-Skirt-Steak-12225

After reading the reviews I cut the oil in half ( sure glad I did!).Was using this for a dressing on a seafood salad tower, with mango, crab, shrimp, avocado and tomato. While it was good by itself, I added about a teaspoon of salsa verde and 2 teaspoons of honey. Totally yummy! The hint of sweetness complimented all the ingredients perfectly.

Delicious. I didn't have white wine vinegar so I substituted red wine vinegar and it still tasted great.

A great accompaniment. I made this to use on the Mexican Rice recipe and it added so much flavor to it. This is quite versatile. We also made the Grilled Giant Pork Chops with Adobo Paste and this dressing was great drizzled over that, as well. It does taste better after it sits for at least 30 min or more. It was slightly oily. I will try it with a touch less oil next time.

AMAZING I just found a base for my Tomatillo salsa. After reading comments about something lacking and cutting oil in 1/2, etc. I decided to buy a can of tomatillo salsa, using it instead of EVOO--Can I say Wow? I would eat this with plain chips and compliments well with many dishes!?!?!

All I did differently was to add chopped red onion after processing (mainly to mellow the onion). I served this over a simple chicken taco salad and it made a huge difference! Can't wait to try it again!

A Cook From Montreal must have left something out, because this is very flavorful. I don't do a lot of reviews, but this one is definitely a keeper!

really not tasty. I followed others' suggestions by adding lime juice instead and lowering the amount of oil. Nobody ate it at the table and I threw it all out. A waste of fresh cilantro which would have been much better just chopped and added to the food on its own.

The rice recipe listed here is fantastic

This is delicious on the Mexican rice. Don't worry if you make too much. It's great on plenty of other things, too. And it's a nice way to use up cilantro, which wilts so fast.

Absolutely amazing with the Mexican Rice recipe. Leave recipe as is, but be sure to let the rice sit for at least 30 minutes before eating. It's best at room temperature! When following the recipe, you will likely miss that the notes at the top say "THIS RECIPE YIELDS ENOUGH DRESSING FOR BOTH SEAFOOD SALAD AND RICE." So be sure to cut the recipe when only making one. Add a little at a time to be sure not to soak the rice too much. Leftover dressing is great on everything I have put it on so far - salads, potatoes, pasta, etc...

Like other people have said, the recipe is missing something. I added lemon to the mix. The dressing came out really well, though I wish it was less dense.

hollyepic from Kimberton, PA, I am not certain, but your problem with tasting seasoning ingredients may be due to the fact that you prepare your food and eat it fairly soon. During the cooking process, senses are overwhelmed by the aromas of all your products and you may become desensatized to the point that you can't "taste clearly." Your house can be filled with aromas that linger after cooking, further extending the time you need to recover. The problem isn't there in a professional kitchen because the ventilation is usually better. Try stepping outdoors for a few minutes before you sit down to your meal. You just might notice a difference. Good luck.

Very tasty and not as hot as expected. Goes great on many things -- salad, rice, meat.

4 forks if used with the mexican rice recipe and salted correctly. Make as directed- in a food processor- and then add your salt (quite a bit of salt to taste just right) and pepper.

Great dressing for the Mexican Rice but don't use a whole cup of oil. It's too much. Start w half that.

I was using it with scallops that I slit and stuffed with a butter, cilantro, lime peel mixture. I prepared the dressing as instructed but added some of the lime peel, minced; Sustituted two units of the vinegar with lime juice and used white pepper and salt to taste. It was a fresh and wonderful accompaniment to the meal.

So beautifully green when finished  looks creamy even without creamy ingredients. Problem is I agree with another reviewer who said it seemed like something was missing. Could be salt (it says to season with salt & pepper but that's so vague). I added some, and also a touch of honey. That helped, but my husband and I both still felt we couldn't necessarily taste the fresh cilantro, and we dressed our salads moderately. I have this problem all the time  I'll use a ton of a finely chopped herb, and either use it in an uncooked recipe like this one or add it at the very end of a cooked dish  and for some reason, I can't really taste the herb very much, whether or not flavors have mingled overnight. Same issue with garlic  can't really taste it, even when I use a TON, whether it's cooked or raw, and use salt. I know people have different levels of taste strength, but I not only taste my food just fine but get immense pleasure out of it. Does anyone else have this issue with herbs and garlic?! When I eat out, rather than eating my own stuff, THEN I can usually taste garlic much better. Cannot figure out why.

This recipe was a HUGE hit at our outdoor BBQ. Perfect for a BBQ, so refreshing and delicious. Everyone was happy to take leftovers home!!

Definilty need to use a food processor to make this just right. I love cilantro, but there seemed to be something lacking. For the time being, I'm giving it two forks as I can't decide if I'll make it again or not. I probably will just to get me off the fence and see if it is worth the trouble for the mexican rice.

This was delicious. I made it for the Mexican Rice recipe, and used leftovers on turkey sandwiches. I also mixed some with cream cheese and made a vegetable dip. All three were huge hits! This is going to be a regular at my house.

Very delicious and a quick way to use up a big bunch of cilantro. I subbed walnut oil and omitted the chile.

Man, this was great with rice but I will use it for everything.

I only made the rice and used the rest of the sauce as a condiment for chicken and carne asada tacos. With any left over, I used as salad dressing. This is a great multi-purpose sauce to used on practically anything.

I I made this as part of a beautiful seafood dinner at the beach.Delicious, but most memorably the next day drizzled it over soft flatbread wrapped around fresh tomatoes and slivered red onions. Wow!

I made this for a big gathering and tripled the recipe.. I made it three times, not truly tripled. It was a smash hit! Last night, I grilled some wild salmon and even though the salmon is rich tasting, made this to drizzle over the fish. It was FANTASTICO! The cilantro and the cedar planking really blended well.. very well.

I doubled the recipe so I would have enough for the rice and enough for a spinach salad - absolutely delicious! I followed the recipes as written with the exception of using brown rice instead of white and equal amounts of rice vinegar & white vinegar for the dressing. I would not change a thing.

Paired with a salad of baby spinach, jicama, oranges (w/o membrane) and pepitas. I used red wine vinegar rather than white and substituted a tablespoon of chipotle adobo puree to add smoky heat. I may add grilled shrimp next time.

This is probably my favorite salad dressing! It tastes best served with baby spinach, cucumbers, red peppers, avocado and a sprinkle of sunflower seeds. This has become a staple recipe in my book. I've made it for large groups several times and someone always asks for the recipe.

Delicious!!! The best part of the meal. Its a must on the mexican rice recipe. Fresh tasting , would also be nice as an appetizer drizzled over bits of pitta or french bread.

Really, really tasty recipe. I made the rice with it, which was also fantastic. Definitely up the vinegar:oil ratio. I also used more of the garlic and spices (twice as much garlic as called for), which I think helped. Tried the dressing on a garden salad, which didn't taste so great. I think it would be perfect drizzled on a tomato & cucumber salad.

I also make this with only about 1/2 cup olive oil. I always get requests for this recipe.

Absolutely loved this dressing - it was great with the rice and then I used it on salads too! My company asked for the recipe - then you know it's a keeper.

I made this for a mexican supper along with the rice--which was wonderful. I halved the recipe since I wasn't making the Seafood Salad; I'm glad I did. I ended up doubling (or at least 1 1/2-ing) all of the ingredients except for the olive oil--at first taste, it was waaay too greasy. Next time, I'll just make it according to the recipe with only 1/2 c. olive oil. Other than that, delicious! I will definately make this again.

The dressing was awesome on the rice. I would not use as much oil next time. I did get to be too greasy. I would add it to the rice a little at a time and keep tasting it as you go. That way, you wont over do it.

I substituted two parts of the vinegar for two parts lime juice and found it gave it a nice summery flavor, when served over mixed greens..

Great in the rice. Can't wait to try it on baby greens with grilled shrimp or scallops. Might even be a good marinade for seafood, fish. Definitely a keeper.

I made this with the rice and thought it was very tastey...but too oily. I will make it again but next time I will make it with way less oil...then it will probably earn three forks instead of two.

I made this dressing for the Mexican rice and the complement is wonderful. It is not too spicy and has a friendly flavor thanks to the chiles. I also served the dressing with a simple sliced grilled chicken salad with tomato chunks. It was very well received and I would definately make it again.

I've made this several times already. GREAT on seafood, fabu on the rice. Definitely nice!
