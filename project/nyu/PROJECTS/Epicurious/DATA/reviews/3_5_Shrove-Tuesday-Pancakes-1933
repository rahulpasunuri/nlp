These are the best pancakes I have ever had. I was looking for a good Irish dish and this was really it. They are like crepes and the lemon and sugar icing is great, although you don't really need it, they're great just plain. I'll be making them over and over again!

These delicious little treats have become a weekend staple in our home... I love the fact that they can be whipped up in a blender! I added a 1/2 teaspoon of orange essence to the batter and sprinkled the pancakes with a little orange zest and powdered sugar. They are not your regular pancakes, but a more dense , eggy flavoured cake. YUM.

Just like my grandma made when I was a child in Preston, Lancs., England...brought back strong memories and a tear to my eye. Thanks for the recipe/memories.

What a wonderful remembrance. My Derbyshire mother used to make these every Shrove Tuesday for this little girl living in Cleveland, Ohio in the 50's. Apparently the housewives used to have pancake races in England on Shrove Tuesday.. The crepe quality is vital as is the lemon juice and icing sugar. Told my family this were having these tonight.

Loved these pancakes - just like my Merseyside Mother used to make. She never knew she was actually making crepes!

I've never been able to remember this recipe, so you can imagine how pleased I was to find it. Now this Welsh cook can treat the Autralians to the rael thing

being English, it's always been a favorite of mine. The trick is to make thin pancakes!
