Made my hamantaschen way too late for Purim. I made mine with apricot jam, walnuts + mini chocolate chips, and the orange/date filling. They were good, but not great, and pretty labor intensive. I added extra water to the dough, squeezed the corners very tight and painted the seams with more water, but about a third of them still opened in the oven--very frustrating!

I have a trusted Mimi Sheraton recipe that notes you should let the hammies rest for 30 minutes before baking to ensure they dont pop. It works for me.

I have made this recipe many times and it is delicious! I have had the problem of them coming undone and last year finally solved it, I think. I smashed the corners together folded over with no visible seams, then I put them back in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. A total hassle but the results are worth it. Everyone raves about my Hamantaschen, if you are only going to make them once a year- make great ones.

Good with date jam, but the reviews contain necessary tips to make the cookies come out sealed. Added 1-2 T. ice water to the dough to form a ball - impossible without it. Used a pastry brush and water to seal the cookies too - had none of them pop open during baking.

I thought the taste with the cream cheese was excellent. I did notice that some of my cookies came unglued at the seams - you do really need to seal them tightly. I found, with my oven, that 375 was too hot, and my first batch got too brown, but 350 was just right.

I forgot the cream cheese so substituted plain Greek yoghurt. Worked well, flavor good. First batch stuck together well but 2nd batch I think I was a little over confident, some opened up. Really need to press together firmly

Flavor and texture were amazing but I have to agree...they were nearly impossible to seal. I found that the first rolling ones stuck better than the rerolled dough. I only let it rest an hour...maybe if it had rested longer I could have gotten a better seal.

The dough was crumbly, but once I worked it a bit and started rolling it out, it held together fine. And it had a great flavor after baked. My cookies held their shape well too. You should not only pinch the corners, but pinch and fold a ways up each side so only a small amount of the filling is visible. This way, the sides won't flop out. I used the date filling and since my dates were not as soft as I'd have liked, I ended up adding some water and cooking the mixture until it was more paste-like.

Delicious! The dough holds together just fine if you don't use too much flour when you roll it out, and pinch the seams together hard. It does NOT need any more liquid -- it seems crumbly when first put together, but a day in the fridge makes it very pliable and it rolls out beautifully. Mine turned out perfectly, first time. (I used poppy seed filling.)

I would give this cookie 4 forks if they had held together. But as others have reported, the three corners came unglued in about 1/3 of my cookies.

I have been making this recipe since I found it the magazine. I make it every year and I love it. I don't waste the calories on anyone else's (unless they use the same recipe). You have to be really diligent about closing the corners (I usually squeeze tight and fold over, maybe even repeating that process). usually use jam or kisses in the center. I am such a convert to these that I can't understand why others don't love them! : ) all well!

I thought these were good, not great. I was anticipating having a lot of trouble, but the dough was just the right consistency. I also pinched the corners carefully, and they held together just fine. My only problem was the filling--I used the apple and date recommended with the recipe. When I used an apricot jam, the cookies came all undone. I'm guessing it was too runny and kept the corners from adhering completely.

I've been making hamantaschen for years and thought a new recipe would be nice. That was not such a good idea in the end. Problems: 1. I had to add additional liquid since dough with only one yolk and vanilla was too dry. 2. The dough needed to rolled out thinner. 3. Even with very thorough pinching almost all the hamantaschen opened up too much and were unattractive. 4. To top it off, the cookie itself wasn't very tasty. Sorry. Usually Gourmet is a good resource.

I was looking forward to baking these...what a disappointment! The cookie was crumbly, did not hold its shape well at all. I am going back to my old standby- any sugar cookie recipe, add an extra 1/4 cup of flour. Works every time

For some reason, I didn't get the great results that others did. Perhaps it was because I used low-fat cream cheese from a tub rather than regular cream cheese sticks. I also used jam, and maybe that was a bad idea too. The cookies tasted okay, but not as rich and buttery as I hoped. Although, I would like to try using this recipe for a low-fat pie crust.

"Better than my Grandmother's" was the best compliment I received on this one (and I used jam...) I agree with the others: less than one teaspoon of filling, , pinch the sides up more than necessary (all mine opened a bit during baking), and use parchment paper! Yummy!

Very good recipe! Easy to make! I mixed butter with dry ingredients by hand. I think it was faster than with the help of mixer... I will definetly do it next Purim!

Pretty easy. Rolling out was much easier than your average piecrust, and I'd be interested in trying this dough that way. I found the step "Knead half of dough 2 or 3 times to make it less crumbly" to be unneccessary. Skip it! Less work, less time spent, same fine results. A very good recipe for a tricky cookie.

These were easy to prepare. The only problem I had were that some of the corners came undone. After the first batch, I checked the oven at five minutes and pinched them back up. No problems after that. I like the dough a bit thinner than 1/4", too, but it was easy to roll the dough out without sticking. Canned apricot pie filling worked great (one 12 oz. can filled the 56 hamantachen I had when I doubled the recipe). This is definitely the recipe I will use next year.

Exceptionally easy to make and tasty. I would add a bit more sugar and use pie filling instead of jam or jelly. We used low fat cream cheese and it worked great. Also, to get 24 cookies, go thinner than 1/4 inch.
