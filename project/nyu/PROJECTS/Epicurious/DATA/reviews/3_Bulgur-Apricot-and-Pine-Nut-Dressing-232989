This is a good basic bulgur pilaf recipe. Next time I would toast the pine nuts (or sliced almonds) in a dry skillet and saute the onion in just 1 - 2 T oil.

This dish is yummy both ways, but the individual flavors come out more at room temperature, and so that's my preference. I think it'd be great with the addition of a little bit of fresh mint.

MMMM I agree with the other reviewers. This is a delicious recipe. I didn't have any bulghur on hand so I used quinoa, it was great.

This is sooo yummy I acutally like it better cold than heated. It is addictive!

Tasty, even as a light dinner on its own or even as a cold lunch. Kind of tastes like it's missing something that I can't quite put my finger on.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year (2005). Everyone seemed to like it; they mentioned especially the toasted pine nuts as being a feature. The apricots I used were the California variety, as recommended. I thought they were too dry and tart. Next time I think I will try the plumper, moister dried apricots. The ones that looked that way in the market were the Mediterranean variety.
