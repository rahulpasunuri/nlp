Actually as someone who has never eaten meat I could end up hospitalized if I tried the pork version. Please do not rate vegetarian recipes as one star because they do not have meat, that is very rude when I'm looking for a new recipe and the ratings are skewed. I found the dish very good.

It really is rude for non-vegetarians to criticize a dish from a "vegetarian" article because it does not contain pork. How about if I go through all of the meat recipes and give them one star each because they don't sound good to me? I'll put "has meat in it - sounds gross to me!" for all of them. Think before you review next time.

Questions of spelling and tradition aside (kind of silly, since both the dish and the word have many variations), this is an excellent dish in its own right. I've served it with cornbread and catfish for an informal dinner with friends, and as part of an elaborate southwestern style Thanksgiving. Unusual and tasty. Lends itself easily to variation too -- drop the cherries and pecans for raisins and curry to lend this a middle eastern flavor, or lemon grass, chiles and cilantro for Thai . . . .

Gabriela is right...it is spelled Pozole. I lived in Acapulco Mexico for almost 20 years and to try to turn this into a vegetarian dish is ludicrous..It doesn't compare at all. Plus its not just about the soup, its also about the side dishes that goes with it. They never get mentioned in the cookbooks. There should be chalupas, tacitos, avocado, pork rind, sliced radishes, diced onions, dried oregano, curd cheese, red chili powder and plenty of limes alongside the bowl of Pozole. I love putting them all (except the chalupa) right into the soup. Its heavenly!!!

Okay Girls, lighten up just a bit. It's veggie alright. I understand, but Stephen rocks when it comes to good cookin'

I agree with Gabriela. This is one of those dishes that cannot be made vegetarian, since the soul and source of its character and flavor is the meat it contains.

I had Swiss Chard sitting around with no place to go and find pork-treated greens disgusting, so I tried this. I thought it was great -- a very unexpected, lovely flavor enhanced with the cherries. It is not a dish I would make for a party, but it is perfect during the week.

Thanks for being so creative and to make your best effort to "vegetarianize" every delicious dish, but you must admit that sometimes it can not be done. There are wonderful veggie dishes, so why spoil a good recipe? I think you will not fall dead if you try once in your life the pork version! I promise to try yours if you stop calling it posole (which by the way is pozole), because here in Mexico we would call this recipe "homicide" (this is a joke re the way you refer to dry posole)!
