Very easy and delicious! Added crushed pineapple, ginger, orange zest and orange juice as others have suggested and it turned out great. Also used powdered spices with no problem. So much better than canned cranberry sauce.

This was a strong cranberry recipe, but you need to cook the cranberry sauce quite a bit longer than the recipe calls for. I added the zest of 1 large orange for 1.5 batches and I liked it alot, but would probably skip the nutmeg next time.

Easy and quick! Vary sugar and honey according to how sweet or tart you'd like it. I double and let simmer considerably longer than called for - about 15 minutes. Chilling in the fridge also helps to thicken it as does serving it at room temp.

This recipe was fantastic and so simple to make. Made it for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it. I used ground spices and it worked out so well. This one is a keeper!

Super tasty - but be sure to cook until the cranberries burst. The first time I tried it, the sauce didn't set (maybe because I doubled it?). Second time it took over 20 min. but firmed up immediately. Enjoy!

This was sublime. Since I didn't have cinnamon sticks, I used 1 tsp. ground cinnamon. I also added about 1-1/2 tsp. freshly grated ginger which gave it a "kick". Absolutely delicious!

Simple. Uncontroversial. Delicious. All ages at my table liked it. Only used 2T. brown sugar, as I like it tart. Substituted oj for water. Should have doubled the recipe. This will be a regular side dish for me.

Have been experimenting with different cranberry sauces for Thanksgiving for years -- this is the best by far! Finally an easy recipe with ingredients already in the pantry that has some sophistication and kick.

Made this today for Thansgiving this Thursday...used ground spices as previously recommended by reviewers AND pureed it with my hand blender. A big WOW! Hope my guests like it as much as the chef does!

I love this cranberry sauce- this is the 3rd year in a row that I have made it for Thanksgiving. It is spicy, tart, and sweet-the perfect balance. I double the recipe so I have leftovers...and enjoyed the last of it with yogurt for breakfast. Yum.

This is a keeper! Served it with Thanksgiving dinner and it was all gone by dinners end. Like others below, I replaced the water with fresh orange juice and recommend it to others. Thanks to all the prior reviewers comments... its what makes this online recipe box so useful to me.

Always a hit and always good!! A staple at Thanksgiving time. Use orange juice instead of the water; gives it great flavor!

Great recipe. Everyone loved it. I made it two days ahead to give the spices time to mull and I am glad I did. Great flavor. Will do again

Loved this, but changed 3/4C water to mostly fresh squeezed OJ, cointreau and orange zest. Marvelous

Rating: 4
I found other cranberry recipes to be far too sweet but this was perfect using about 3 tbs of brown sugar. I also subsituted the water with the juice of 2 oranges (about 3/4 cup of juice) and then added water to make it a full cup of liquid as I like it more saucey and it was perfect! I didn't use whole cloves because I figured guests would be surprised to end up crunching on them so instead used ground cloves. I thought the spices were just right! I will definitely use this in the future as I can't imagine finding anything better.

The 10 people at our Thanksgiving liked this one though I wouldn't go so far as to say it's an instant family favourite. I added a few TBSP of white sugar after the mixture had boiled as I felt it was a little too sour.

One of the very best cranberry sauce recipes I have ever made. Now, my family won't let me make anything else. Use a very good grade honey when making this. Everyone will rave about it.

Added a couple teaspoons of Grand Marnier and substituted about 1/3 of the water with orange juice. Received great reviews, even from the non-cranberry sauce devotees of the bunch.

I completely agree that this is a simple, straightforward recipe, and that's the beauty in it. It's a perfect accompaniment to roast turkey -- save the hard work and bells and whistles for the other sides. All I did was up the brown sugar considerably, use half fresh orange juice and half water, and add a splash of Grand Marnier at the very end. EASY.

This is a great sauce. Very easy to make and delicious. Next time, I will strain it or put it thru a food mill before serving since the cranberry skins are tough to chew.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I squeezed an orange and had a little more than 3/4 cup of juice. Next time I will put the cloves in cheesecloth.

I made this with the orange juice as recommended and tied the cloves in cheesecloth so you didn't need to pick them out. Also made ahead and froze it....it was delicious. Will definitely make it again. Everyone who ate it at Thanksgiving gave it a thumbs up!!

Made this for the first time this year. Added 1/2 cup water and substituted orange juice for the final 1/4 cup. I think I would also add, next time, some orange zest. At first taste, I was a bit leary. It was, to my pallette, way too tart. But the recipe says "Brown sugar to taste" so I added in a few more tablespoons which dissolved instantly in the still hot sauce, and got it up to a sweet-tart flavor more to my liking. Personally, I think the recipe is a bit conservative with the sugar, and next time I'll be upping the amount to at least 5-6 tablespoons. The end result was *AMAZING*. Very addictive, especially after "resting" in the frige. This is a sauce that is at it's best if made a day or two in advance so the spice and honey have a chance to meld. It has a layering of flavors that melt over the tongue. Better than any cranberry sauce I've tasted and that includes complex ones made with expensive port or high grade maple syrup or additives like nuts and dried fruit. This is the one. Simple and delicious.

I just made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit. I used OJ instead of water like other reviews suggested and it was perfect. I doubled the recipe since it didn't seem like it would be enough for 6, plus leftovers and I think it was the right amount.

Incredible!! Was running low on honey so used a bit more brown sugar. Used ground cinnamon and cloves. My house smelled incredible and it is the most delicious cranberry sauce I've ever had.

So easy to make and a nice change from ordinary cranberry sauce. I used a bit less honey and substituted orange juice for 1/3 of the water, as others had suggested. I made a triple batch and used part of it in a cranberry swirl coffee cake.

Easy and delicious (and a great change from standard cranberry/orange sauce). Used half OJ-half water and ground cloves instead of whole cloves (didn't feel like fishing them out). Great!

I thought this was excellent absolutely the best I have tried and I have tried a lot. This one is a keeper. It is simple and so does not take anything away from the cranberries. The spices are perfect, subtle but good. Also its not too sweet

I've made many fancy cranberry sauces over the years, mostly using very expensive additives, but I'm throwing all those recipes away now. This very simple recipe is the best. I almost downed the whole batch by myself. Warmed over leftover turkey - mmmmmmmmm! No more looking for a cranberry sauce recipe to beat last years. Only thing I changed was to use orange juice instead of water. This it it!

This was my first thanksgiving meal and I had it in Germany! The flavor in this dish was great but it never thickened up for me. It didn't matter though, the taste was still there!

I made the recipe as is on Thanksgiving and it is tasty. I'm still eating it days later and it tastes just as good (or better) refrigerated. I will try the crushed pineapple next time!

I would definitely make this again. I didn't have whole cloves so I used 1/2 tsp. ground cloves which was a little strong. Next time I would use 1/4 tsp. I also added 1/3 cup crushed pineapple at the end which added to the flavor. I thought the amount of honey and sugar (3tbsp) was just right to balance the tartness of the cranberries.

Just fine - substituted OJ for some of the water - not as sweet as many other fresh cranberry sauces.

This is delicious! I made it with orange juice instead of water, and solved the "loose whole clove" dilemma by putting the cloves in a tea ball and removing the tea ball after cooking. I'll definitely use this at Thanksgiving again!

When I made this for Thanksgiving, my picky nieces rolled their eyes because we were having "cranberries with twigs in them." But after they tried it, they were eating it by the spoonfull, and there was not a drop left at the end of dinner! The only substitution I made was using orange liquor instead of water. It made a really nice tangy difference.

Another great springboard recipe! Instead of whole cloves and cinnamon sticks, added 1/4 tsp. of ground spices each. Also added zest of 2 medium oranges and about 1 1/2 tsp of fresh ginger zest. Also had to add more sweetener than what is called for, but let your tongue decide. I'll never buy my cranberry sauce again, this was so easy and delicous.

This was the second year I've made this recipe for Thanksgiving. This year's cranberries were pretty tart and I had to add more honey; also, I solved last year's clove-and-berry-skin-picking problem by straining it through a sieve, which made it a really wonderful consistency and quite delicious!

This was delicious. My mother always made the cranberries with just water and sugar----never again, though! She just loved this! I will make it again for the holidays. One problem, though--did I miss something, or how do you get the cloves out of the sauce after it's done??? I just picked them out so my guests wouldn't chomp down on one! I also added orange zest.
