I couldn't find tri-tip, so I used sirloin tips instead. I improvised with the salmoriglio a bit and added a bit of parsley in with the thyme and oregano. It was absolutely fabulous! I definitely will make it again.

Great simple recipe. My one comment is that if you wait until the center of the tritip is at 128-135 degrees you will have a well-done roast after it rests. Remove it from the grill at 100-110 internal, it will continue to warm to 125+.

Salmoriglio became our "go-to" sauce years ago. Great on lamb. Can be made just with a mortar & pestle and a whisk.

This is truly amazing. The recipe is extremely simple but the result is one of the best steaks I've ever had. The smokiness really adds a lot to the meat and a little bit of the herb sauce goes a long way. If you can't finish it, it would be amazing on a steak sandwich the next day.

Fantastic! We used to the sauce on shrimp as well. Yummy!

Also, if your meat is tough, you probably didn't cut it against the grain. Melts in your mouth!

I made this recipe for the first time a couple of years ago, and I will never make tri-tip any other way! The meat tastes fantastic and the sauce is out of this world!!

This is an amazing recipe. Easy enough to do it for your family for a weeknight or weekend meal and nice enough to use it for entertaining. We have made it about 10 times in the past two years and it always comes out amazing. Grilling on the wood chips really enhances the flavor. We also try and marinate the meat for at least 24 hours prior to cooking. Enjoy!

Excellent-- the sauce is basically a thyme twist on Chimichurri, and a little heavier with the added olive oil. The wood chips really do enhance to the flavor of the meat.

flavor was great - the tri-tip cut, however, is a little tough

Perfect! This sauce is SO good, I think you could put it on just about any meat. I used buffalo tri tip and served it over oven roasted red potatos with olive oil and salt. The mesquite smoked method taste incredible.

I used a moose hip roast. Totally unsure of what I was doing but cooked it like this recipe says on a charcoal grill. Could hardly believe it was done after 15-20min of indirect heat. I seared it initially over direct heat about 4 min per side (4 sides). It was so tender and delicious. All I ever read to do with any cut of moose is cook "long and slow" - how wrong that is! I hope this comment can be of use to anyone who has a stockpile of moose (hip roasts) in their freezer.

I followed the recipe as written with one exception that will be detailed. When cooking the meat I put the fat side of the tri-tip down first and let it flame a bit. Then after taking it off the charcoal grill I put about 3 tablespoons of the oil herb mixture on the meat while it rested. This did a couple things: the garlic cooked a little bit from the heat of the meat and when cutting the meat the herb and oil got spread on the meat by the knife. The results where outstanding and was one of the best beef dishes I have ever cooked.

Absolutely LOVE the sauce. It went perfectly with the smoked tri tip. I'd like to try it next with some grilled chicken breasts. TRY IT, it has a wonderful flavor.

Very tasty and quick, we added some fresh basil to the sauce and it was excellent.

Really nice and easy. I doubled the sauce and used half for a marinade which I let sit for 3 hours or so. I also made sure the tri-tip came to room temp before grilling. Came out beautifully.

I agree with everyone else - absolutely fabulous....one cook used the sauce as a marinade by mistake so did what she suggested: made double, used 1/2 for marinade and 1/2 for a sauce - seriously the best tri tip I have ever had and my guests loved it too!

This was amazing. The salmoriglio sauce was a definite hit and really made the cut of meat stand out. Make sure if you use a gas grill that the heat is not so hot as to start your wood chips on fire :) haha. I will definitely make this again.

Fabulous- just the right amount of smoke flavor (I used a gas grill). My first time making a tri-tip- the meat was tender and had great flavor. Loved the sauce. Brushed some over the meat during the last few minutes of grilling. Took more than 13 minutes to get to medium rare- more like 20-25. I'll be making this again for guests!

I made this recipe with a tri-tip and it was delicious. The simple sauce is so good, and I've used it many times as a condiment for other grilled meats. Tri-tip isn't always easy to find so I've used large porterhouse or New York Strip steaks and then sliced them after they came off the grill.

This was a random choice when we found we had a tri tip in the freezer. I love grilled meats like this. We often do something similar with flank steak. This was a super easy prep and fabulously successful dinner. I made it with our grandson Zach, an aspiring chef. I think he must have eaten two pounds himself. Simply a fabulously simple and elegant dish. We're serving it for an end-of-summer dinner party later this week

Outstanding! Because I didn't read the recipe thoroughly, I used the sauce as a marinade. I don't know if that's why it ended up so delicious, but I know I'll do it exactly the same the next time I make this. I had to boil the marinade to use it on the meat after grilling. It tasted great - but next time I'll double the amount and use 1/2 for a marinade and the rest for the sauce. It took quite a bit longer than 13 minutes to get the meat to rare/med. rare -more like 20. I recommend a meat thermometer.

Substituted marjoram for thyme as it was the only fresh herb on hand. Sublime results.

this recipe is killer. be sure not to over cook the meat and let it rest before slicing. This is my go-to BBQ meat dish for a party. easy, quick and sooooo tasty.

Made this last night and had multiple rave reviews. I doubled the garlic and added some red pepper to add some more spice and it was amazing.

Forgot to mention that I pumped up the garlic (x 2). The thyme can take it if you can.

Easy and savory. I wound up marinating almost 48 hours and also the cook forgot to add the wood chips. The dish was delicious but still probably would have been enhanced with chips. This will become a family favorite.

This was very good. I doubled the sauce and marinated the tri tip in half the sauce overnight. The meat was moist, tender and flavorful, a hit at a recent barbecue.

I've now made this twice and it was perfect and delicious both times. The first time I made it as a practice run for a party I was having. The taste was wonderful and the meat tender. Everyone loved it. The Sicilian Herb Sauce has wonderful, uncomplicated flavor, without being overpowering.

Marinade was excellent as was herb sauce. Tri-tip is hard to find on the East Coast but I found it at Costco.

Hi! A tri-tip is just a different cut - it has three corners, hence the name!
