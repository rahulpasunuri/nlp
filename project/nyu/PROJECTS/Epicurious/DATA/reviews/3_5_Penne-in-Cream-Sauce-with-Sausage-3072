Pretty good, other than the fact that six tablespoons of parsley is WAY too many. We found that just one tablespoon still took away from the rest of the ingredients in the sauce. Thanks for the great idea!

I have made this many times over the years. This time I made the sauce with half sweet and half hot italian sausage, a bit more garlic, and a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes. Sauteed the onions about 5 min. before adding garlic to prevent burning, then completed the sauce in the suggested order and set it aside. This is where I departed from the recipe. Following the suggestions in the wonderful article from the Bon Appetit May 2011 issue on Pan Sauces (which I've been using ever since it appeared), I placed enough sauce for two servings in a pan, reheated it along with pasta water, then added the el dente pasta after the sauce had thickened. When the pasta was coated with sauce, and had finished cooking, I stirred in grated Grana Padano Parmesan off heat and served it. WOW!!! What a Treat. This method beats the heck out of placing pasta in a bowl and just dumping the sauce on top. Ya gotta try it.

I had this dish several times about 13 years ago when it was published in Bon Appetit and lost the recipe. It was so good that it's been on my mind since. I just found it online and I can't wait to make it again!! I remember it as finally being a recipe that tasted like something out of a restaurant.

Holy cow, this is good. I too doubled the tomatoes and used half and half and added a little fresh basil. I cannot wait to make it again. MUST ADDS: roasted red pepper and crushed red pepper. Both really made this an elegant, complex dish.

This was really, really good! Even my picky toddler loved it. I used a little more garlic, 2 cans tomatoes, and half and half and fresh basil as per another review. Also added some mushrooms. Oh and I thickened it just a touch with cornstarch so it would adhere to the noodles better. Sooooo good, will definitely be making again!

Excellent and easy. I used sweet turkey sausage, red pepper flakes, a little fennel seed, 5 cloves of garlic, 2 cans of diced tomatoes, half and half and fresh basil rather then parsley. Cooked the tomatoes much longer and it wasn't watery at all. Highly recommended.

This excellent and versatile recipe lends itself to experimentation and fridge cleaning. I tend to add lots of veggies (mushrooms, red bell pepper, kale, etc) and double the garlic. The trick is to cook the garlic really slow in the beginning to get a nice mellow garlic flavor. The extra dry vermouth that I keep on hand works great.

Solid dish. It's quite mellow as written (obviously: it doesnt call for any fire. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a dish highlighting its constituent components: here, garlic/oniom, sausage and tomatoes. If you need more, light it up with crushed red pepper flakes or cayenne, but the recipe as written is solid.

I have made this recipe countless times and it's fantastic. Everyone loves it and it's very easy. I use campanelle or cavatappi pasta instead of penne, and add some red pepper flake while the sausage cooks. Alternately, you could use hot sausage if you like the spice.

I had this dish at a friends house and loved it. I decided to make it at home for my family. I did make some changes. I substituted chicken broth for the wine and reduced it just as it said. Also, I didn't have any penne pasta, so I used angel hair instead. It was delicious! I actually liked the angel hair pasta better. Even my picky 8 year old, who hates tomatoes, loved it.

It was good.... I used Hot Sausage instead of Italian, which spiced up the dish. And it took away from tasting the flavours of the sauce. Any ideas on putting more flavour to the sauce? Will make it again!

I've made this several times, and it's a great mid week, in a hurry dinner. I make the sauce ahead earlier in the day, so it's thick when I use it. For those who are weight conscious, I also use fat free evaporated milk, instead of cream. Great flavor, less calories, and a lot less fat. Enjoy!

I've been making this recipe for years, and it never fails to impress. I do make some substitutions, based on trial and error, and feel the recipe has been perfected over the years. I substitute red wine for white, double the tomatoes, use spicy sausage and add an extra clove of garlic. Without the extra tomatoes, it is a trifle dry.

one more comment about thin sauce for those who found it too watery: sausages vary tremendously in water content; I always drain the sausage after cooking and add the garlic only after draining as much liquid as possible out of the pan; this makes a big difference in the final consistency of the sauce.

Rating: 4
I have been making this for 2 years; it is still a huge favorite of my husband and son. With regard to comments from some about thin sauce: I usually simmer the tomatoes for about 10-15 minutes and then add the cream and simmer for at least 10-15 minutes; this thickens the sauce up a bit. I made it just last night and was just as pleased with it as two years ago. I use sweet Italian turkey sausage and chop the onions (to hide them from children). It has never not worked out well, and I have made this dozens of times.

I love this pasta dish! I have made it over and over again and it always wins raves from friends. I change it slightly by adding a pre-cooked roux to the sauce to thicken it a little. I just cook a little flour and butter prior to starting the recipe, and put it in the refrigerator or freezer and add it later to the hot sauce. I also like to make the sauce and pasta ahead of time and combine them, and pop them in the oven just prior to guests arriving. Just cook the pasta, and toss with olive oil. Cool, and place in a zip lock bag in the refrigerator. An hour or two before guests arrive combine the sauce with the pasta and let come to room temperature. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 30 to 40 minutes.

I made this dish several years ago when it first was printed. It has been a family favorite since then! I follow the recipe pretty closely, just using more garlic and onions and draining as much oil as I can. I appreciate the Landini Brothers Restaurant allowing Bon Appetit to publish it. It definitely deserves 4 forks!!!

I made it for dinner the other night and I found that the sauce was too thin, it never became creamy, only liquidy. My sister and husband said it was okay, and I thought the same, just okay. I followed the recipe closely, and even let it simmer longer to see if it'd gain consistency.

Easy, delicious, crowd-pleaser and kid-pleaser, you can't ask for better. Even can prep ahead. I love it, my kids love it, my nephew loves it, now my dad even makes it! I like it better with half & half, also works great with medium or spicy sausage. I've frozen the leftover cooked and sauced pasta and it's much better than any frozen prepped food you can buy at the market. Better yet, make a double batch and freeze half of the sauce before adding the cream, then just thaw and finish the sauce for any easy weeknight family meal.

I've been making this recipe since it first appeared in Bon Appetit, and it's always a hit--even with really finicky kids. I usually use a large can of tomatoes (twice what the recipe calls for), drain off about half the liquid, and cook until the volume is reduced by about a half (20 minutes or so). Then I add half-and-half or light cream instead of heavy cream. The result is still intensely flavorful but a little lighter than the original recipe. Love this dish!

Rating: 4
The best bang for your buck as far as flavor vs labor. I also follow the advice of every cooking show on cable and invest in 180 day aged imported parmesan (never substitute). Also, as everyone knows, right before serving any dish it should be "shocked" with an acid such as citric or acetic. With this dish I use a spritz of red wine vinegar.

We have made this dish three times now, the last time I added a puree of roasted red pepper to the sauce and it was delicious. My oldest daughter hated italian sausage until we tried this dish, now I have to make double so she can have leftovers as afterschool snacks. The only regular addition I've made is a little red pepper flake. It's been a good addition to our "pasta night" menu.

I followed the recipe except that I omitted the onions completely (boyfriend won't even touch an onion) and subbed dried parsley for fresh (I know, eww but I couldn't find fresh); used sweet Italian sausage and drained it (on paper towels while wiping out the pan a little) before adding the wine to remove some fat. It was good and I would make it again but with some changes. There was not enough sauce per the amount of sausage - will probably double the tomatoes and maybe the cream & wine too. I used diced tomatoes as called for but I think pureeing the sauce or using crushed tomatoes instead might work better - the tomato chunks partly disintergrated anyway so that the texture wasn't really chunky and wasn't really creamy either. Maybe doubling diced tomatoes would make it chunkier. Next time I will probably chop/break up the sausage before I put it in the pan; mine wasn't breaking so easily with just the back of the spoon! I can also see trying basil instead of parsley and/or trying mushrooms in this too. It was like comfort food - filling, substanial, flavorful and relatively easy. Not a spectacular-wow dish in my opinion but a great, relaxing meal for "just us" with a bottle of cabernet.

Added another can of tomatoes and more garlic, an let it all cook up to a gooey mixture. Also used turkey stock instead of wine, we didn't have any. Very easy and the kids ate it all up, neighbor kid asked for more. LOL. Next time I will add roasted red peppers, and any veggies I have in the frig.

I love this recipe for the ease of preparation. I've used both hot and sweet italian suasage, sometimes both, and it comes out great every time. I follow the recipe, as it is perfect as written.

I tried this receipe last year and everyone just loved it. The only change I made was to just use 1/2 lb pasta. I double the receipe for 1 pound. We like our pasta a little saucey.

This pasta dish is excellent and one of our regular favorites. I just have a few modifications - I add the garlic when I add the sausage to make sure that it doesn't burn. I change the amounts just a bit for 2-3 servings - 2/3 lb of sausage, 1/2 pound of pasta, and use 1/2-3/4 cup of cream. We like more sauce for our pasta...

Great hearty dinner - my husband and his best friend loved it! I did as others suggested and doubled the amount of tomatoes, used spicy sausage, and added a lot of fresh basil! To cut the fat I used light cream, and cooked the sausauge first and drained it on a paper bag to get rid of the extra fat, and wiped the pan out before cooking the onions in olive oil. There would be way too much fat floating otherwise.

This is a great basic sausage and pasta recipe - and very customizable. I like to add a small amount of nutmeg to the sauce for added flavor. My husband HATES nutmeg, and he LOVED the sauce (a little goes a long way!!). Also, try with mushrooms (don't suggest nutmeg, then). And server with SHAVED cheese for presentation and flavor.

Excellent! I've made this exactly by the book in the past and its great, but this time I used hot italian sausage and doubled the amount of garlic.

Its a flexible recipe that allows for you to tailor it to whats on hand.

This is our favorite pasta dish, and I make it often. There are easy ways to lower the fat content. I substitute olive oil for the butter and instead of Italian sausage use the lower fat turkey sausage. To give the sauce some real substance, I don't use diced tomatoes but put in a 28 oz. can of whole tomatoes, which I quarter. I use about half the amount of cream called for and don't add the grated parmesan (instead, put the parmesan out on the table for people to add themselves). To boost the nutritional value and provide more color, I also add a bunch of broccoli rabe at the end (stems and all, chopped in 1 1/2 inch lengths and parboiled ahead of time). I'm not a broccoli rabe fan, but in this sauce it's great and so good for you!

Unlike previous reviewers, I did not add an extra can of tomatoes, but also did not add a full cup of parmesan (thought I had plenty in the fridge, but was wrong at the last minute). The sauce was light, flavorful, and definitely not too dry, nor was it so thick that it sat in the stomach like lead afterwards. We sprinkled what parmesan I had on top, and it worked wonderfully. I served it with the ciabatta recipe on this site, which was a perfect compliment, and great at sopping up the extra sauce. :)

I used 1/4# spicy Italian sausage and 3/4# sweet Italian turkey sausage, and my only complaint about the dish was that the turkey sausage was hard to crumble as it was being cooked and ended up chewy. I'd try it again using all pork sausage. My husband wasn't happy when he saw that I was putting tomatoes into the dish, but he ended up having 2 large helpings! We both think that the amount of tomatoes called for gives the perfect tang to the sauce and that any more would be too much. This dish is very rich (I accidentally used heavy whipping cream!), and it would prob. feed 8-10 people. After my husband and I each had 2 servings, we still had a huge serving bowl of leftovers.

Make sure to follow everybody's advice and double the tomatoes. Also consider using red wine instead of white. This was probably the most delicious pasta sauce I've ever eaten. Bravo!

Everyone, including my incredibly finnicky 7-year old son, loved this recipe. My one addition was a small can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce.

Just Yummy. Husband, 3 year old kid, and brother in law gobbled it up, and I was short on sausage, (threw in a half pound of ground round to make up the shortage.) Good dish for a pot luck dinner as it is relatively quick and easy to make... I'm not usually the cook in the house, so this got rave reviews. A real diet killer though!

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorite recipes on this site. It's delicious made with cream, but it's also delicious made with evaporated milk at times you want to cut calories. Both ways are good, just different from each other. I definitely recommend doubling the tomatoes. And I don't think the recipe needs any extra herbs as long as you have a really flavorful sausage.

This is delicious. Everyone I have made this for has loved it. I have also substituted a red wine and angel hair pasta with wonderful results

Everytime I make this, I get the same reaction. Not much table conversation. Until someone says "This is to die for!" Or words to that effect. I like to add red pepper flakes & a 2nd can of tomatoes. Whipping cream is a must, in my book. Since I save this for company, I figure it's okay. I do warn them ahead of time so they can eat accordingly for a day or so. They always say it was worth it.

Tried this two months ago and have made it three times since. We have incorporated some suggestions, double the amount of tomatoes, basil/ oregano for parsley, cayenne pepper. I must disagree with many of the fat reducing comments in other reviews. Use only authentic Italian sausage. Drain well. Enjoy.

This is one of my FAVORITE recipes. I make it all the time - using hot sausage.

Rating: 3
I make this dish often as it is quick and easy. I always follow the recipe to a "T". For the cook who was having problems with the cream curdling, this was because of the lower fat content in the lighter cream, it is less stable than full fat cream particularly when cooked with alcohol and this is why it curdled. Light cream does not hold up well when cooked.

Rating: 3
I thought this recipe was quite good-- my husband really loved it. I made it with 1/2 pound chicken italian sausage and light cream instead of heavy, and it was still very satisfying (I can't imagine it with a full pound of sausage!). We had it with grilled zuchini, and it easily served 6. My sauce curdled a bit-- my best guess is that I did not fully cook off all the alcohol. The sauce tasted fine, just wasn't as pretty as it might have been. We'll definately be making this again.

I also used poultry sausage - hot poultry sausage. My husband is still taking about the dish 3 weeks later. The flavors are wonderful and it does work great as leftovers. Great meal to make during the week - quick, easy, and great tasting.

I can't wait to make this again -- it was delicious as well as easy to prepare. I used 1/4 lb hot sausage + 3/4 lb sweet sausage and it had just the right kick to cut some of the creaminess. It was even better as leftovers the next day!

Rating: 3
This recipe is a winner for our family. I make my own tomato sauce ahead of time (& freeze to use at later times) and bypass the sauteeing of the onion & garlic as my sauce already has those ingredients. This makes prep time even easier. I also use Half & Half instead of the cream.

I listened to the other reviewers, used hot instead of sweet sausage, red instead of white wine and carmelized two onions. I accidently bought crushed tomatoes (28oz) and had to use them. With the extra tomatoes I increased the amount of pasta to 1 1/2 lbs. My guests raved and actually took the amended recipe home with them. Quick, easy and delicious -- will definitely keep in my regulars.

YUM! I used chicken sausage with herbs and it was fantastic. I did add a litle crushed red pepper for some kick. Next time I will continue with the low-fat theme and use fat-free half-n-half or fat-free evaporated milk. The cheese at the end did solidify at the bottom of the bowl. Next time I will use grated opposed to shredded. This was an easy, delicious meal:)

Used sweet Italian turkey sausage to reduce fat. Also used fat free half and half for same reason. changes consistency of sauce, but that was okay. Good flavor. Husband liked this a lot and I'll make it again.

Yum! I followed everyone's suggestions for modifications: double the tomatoes, hot sausage, red wine. I also used less cream (probably about 1/3 cup). And after I added the tomatoes I simmered the sauce for quite a bit longer than the recipe suggested, so that it cooked down. I had some spinach in the fridge I wanted to use, so I threw that in at the end along with the parsley, so that it just wilted in the heat of the sauce. I thought the green of the spinach gave it a nice color addition. I luckily made enough for leftovers today... but it was so good my husband and I hardly wanted to stop eating last night! Thanks for everyone's suggestions.

This is one of my favorite Epicurious dishes. I've made it so many times, always to rave reviews. Tastes as though you've slaved in the kitchen when in reality, it couldn't be easier to make.

This is one I serve for dinner parties, and everybody always loves it. I sometimes use a mixture of spicy and mild sausage. I often make the sauce a day ahead and it works fine. The house smells so yummy while I cook, too. It's great with the gorganzola-stuffed portobellos.

I agree, this is a winner! I made this for guests and it received rave reviews from everyone. I followed other reviewers suggestion to double the tomatoes and it made a delicious sauce. I think one can would have not made enough to coat the pasta well. This has been saved to my recipe folder to make again!!SUPER EASY TOO.

A true keeper. Easy to make and doesn't require any special ingredients. I usually substitute hot italian sausage for sweet, for a more pungent taste. I don't think it should be too saucy and tomato-ey anyway, so I stick to the recommended one can of tomatoes, and I use diced ones rather than whole. All in all, a wonderful recipe that has won raves every time I've made it.

Well, the only thing I did different was add two 14 1/2 oz cans of diced tomatoes instead of one and use spicy Italian sausages instead of sweet (I have yet to find sweet Italian sausages in the stores near me!). My guests greatly enjoyed the flavor of the dish and have requested it be put on my permanent cooking list. I think the sauce was a bit thin, personally, and there might not have been enough for the pasta without the extra can of diced tomatoes, but things turned out well enough in the end. Next time, I am making the sauce earlier so I can thicken it up some, and I am going to cook a bit less pasta for it!!

This is virtually the same recipe as Fettuccine with Creamy Tomato-Sausage Sauce. Apart from the pasta shape, the exceptions are that this one has a little wine in it and uses only one can of tomatoes. Having made both, I personally like this one for the choice of penne and the addition of wine, but I do think it needs another can of tomatoes. I also recommend a parmesean/pecorino cheese mixture if available.

Wonderful! My 3 year old practically licked his bowl clean. The leftovers are great the next day. I used half sweet and half spicy sausage, and a 28 oz can of tomatoes. From the looks of things, a 14 oz can would not be enough. Very easy to make, smells great cooking, fantastic flavor.

This is a great dish for either a family or a casual company dinner. A full pound of penne comsumes all the sauce; it works better with 1/2 lb. I also cut the sausage to 3/4 lb. and added 1/2 lb. of sauted chicken tenders. Next time I'll try 1/2-and-1/2 instead of whipping cream to try to shave off a little more of the fat.

This dish was fabulous, so much so that I made it only two night ago and intend to make it again two days from now for the weekly Sunday dinner with my friends. The only alterations I made on the first run were to add about 1/2 cup more cream and about 1/3 cup more wine. I truly think the wine is the essence of the body for this sauce. The only other changes I may make are to use either spicy sausage or to try red pepper flakes. Other than that--unbeatable!!!! Wish you had five forks to give it!

High quality sausage and tomatoes are essential to this sauce's good taste. I like Muir Glen tomatoes, and I try to get my sausage from a butcher whenever I can. I also omitted the parsley. Good fare for company. An Even Greater Caesar Salad compliments the pasta very well-- thanks for the suggestion.

Excellent. I made two batches of this today-- one without garlic for my garlic-phobic parents. Unless you have a severe allergy to garlic, put it in. The sauce tastes more complex with it. I also made some without parsley, and actually prefer it without. I seems to not belong in there. FYI, the recipe also halves nicely. I served this with "an even greater caesar salad" (delicious, by the way--you can find the recipe here on Epicurious) (Feb, 1996) and the whole meal was a home-run.

The first bite I took, I thought it was pretty good, but nothing spectacular, and then with each subsequent bite it got better and better. My husband thought the same thing and ended up raving about it. Our 5- and 7- year olds cleaned their plates. I'm not a big Italian sausage lover, so I only used 1/2 the sausage and it was delicious, but next time, I'm going to use the full pound of sausage but double the other ingredients. We did end up with too much pasta, and if I double it we won't. I don't want to increase the proportion of tomatoes or change anything else. I did use Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, but since all the other flavors were so strong, I'm going to try it next time with cheaper cheese and see how it is. I'll use the good stuff on fettucine alfredo.

I have a three year old so I was afraid to use spicy sausage and too much garlic. He didn't eat the sausage anyways and the dish would have definitely benefitted from those two additions. I can't wait to make it again. Easy, simple, a keeper.

When I first tasted the sauce before I mixed it in with the penne I thought it was the best thing I had ever tasted(Make sure to have baguette on hand for dipping)! Then instead of pouring the sauce onto the penne when serving, I mixed it in which was a mistake because then there was not enough sauce. There was also too much sausage. It's the kind of thing that tastes delicous until you've had too much and then you feel so sick you never want to lay eyes on it again. It's going to be a while before I make it again, that's for sure.

Rating: 3
Very, very good. Tastes like something I'd order at my favorite Italian restaurant. I modified the recipe slightly by increasing the garlic by one small clove, cutting down the sausage (spicy, not sweet) to about 3/4 of a pound, and adding a 28 ounce can of Italian-seasoned tomatoes, versus only the 14 ounce can. I had no parsley on hand, so I simply omitted it. I did NOT skimp on the whipping cream or parmesan cheese (freshly grated Parmesano Reggiano), however-- it's not everyday you eat food this rich, is it? Being that this has been on Constant Comment for nearly a year, (or more?) I knew this dish had to be something special. My husband called it, and I quote, "grubbin'". 'Nuff said.

For all of us non-sausage experts, here is what I realized on the "sweet" vs. "hot" sausage issue... "hot" does not mean spicy, it just means extra spices thrown in (like whole anise seeds- yuck!). If you want spicy like a penne a la vodka, go with the pepper flakes as recommended in earlier reviews. Very easy to cut the fat back in this recipe- used part cream & part evap. skim milk & much less parmesan & it was yummy.

A spectacular pasta dish, well worthy of a four-fork+ rating. Used a number of reviewers' tips (Many thanks for your guidance): lessened the amount of cream, substituted basil for parsley, used a high-quality sausage (Fresh Fields/Whole Foods)and Parmigiano Reggiano. Wary of over-browning the garlic, I waited and added it with the sausage. Overall results were wonderful. Will be making this again and including the recipe in my permanent file.

I did some healthy subsitution with this recipe and it turned out great! Instead of real butter I used "I Can't Beleive it's not Butter." Instead of heavy whipping cream I used Fat Free Half and Half. And instead of sausage I used Sweet Turkey sausage. I let the sauce simmer with the cream for awhile and then pured over the pasta. It was wonderful, my husband loved it and we saved a BUNDLE of calories on a very high fat dish!

My husband loved it - very easy and tasty.

This was a big hit. As suggested by others, I would use more tomatoes and a spicy sausage adds lots of zest and cuts the heaviness of the recipe. Also, unless you REALLY love parmesan, you can probably get away with using less than a cup. One further note: I wouldn't substitute the whipped cream - I find that with heavy dishes, I tend to eat less and feel very satisfied. Plus, you only live once, right?

Have made this recipe every other week for three months and it is still being requested...double for dinner parties (casual) serve with a romaine salad and freshly baked baquettes, a Shiraz or Merlot with fresh fruit for dessert and what a winner...easy to make ahead of time and when about ready to eat cook the penne and heat the bread...

To the previous reviewers comment, thank you so much for the correction! I did in in fact mean evaporated milk. I hope I didn't turn too many recipes into a disaster with my mistake!

Rating: 4
RE: the dieticians recommendation for 'condensed milk'.... I'm pretty sure she meant Evaporated Skim Milk, which is quite a different thing from the very sweet stuff used for baking/candy making. Condensed milk is sugar/milk which is cooked together and makes a thick, sweet caramel-tasting 'milk'. Evaporated Skim/Nonfat Milk is just that... milk with some of the water added. I have used it successfully in many recipes calling for cream, but it does reduce the lovely round 'mouthfeel' that cream adds. What it does do is mimic the consistency and the appearance really well, and if fat is that much of an issue...try it again :) You might like it if you eat lowfat all the time, as 'cream' often tastes greasy to those on a lowfat regime. Good luck!

Made this last night for 4 people (leftovers for 2) to rave reviews. Used 28 oz whole tomatoes with juice. Also threw in a 14.5 oz can of chopped tomatoes. Cut cream by 1/4 C and used basil instead of parsley. Also took reviewers' suggestions and made it with hot sausage. Absolutely delicious.....so fast and easy. Make sure you serve with bread as people will want to sop up the extra sauce.

Made this last night for me and my husband. Excellent!!! Should have listened to the other reviewers and either used less pasta or made more sauce, though. Also, next time, I will use less sausage. I love it, but there seemed to be a bit too much of it. Half a pound would have been sufficient. The smell while cooking is UNBELIEVABLE!!!

I first made this dish camping and we loved it! Last night I was in a pinch: had the cream but no white wine or Ital. sausage. I did have precooked mildly spicy (Aidell's) sausage with harbanero's and red wine. Did everything the same except sliced the sausage in quarter inch rounds --- Yummy! And..... it took half the time as the sausage only had to brown a bit.

My husband and I both loved this dish. Adding the red pepper flakes really spiced it up. My husband added some italian seasonings the next night which added even more flavor. I will use less sausage next time; maybe only a half pound. I hate parsley so I took another reviewers advice and added fresh basil instead, which worked out great. Next time I will try to lessen the fat and use turkey italian sausage and a lighter cream. Definately a keeper!

My husband and I loved this recipe!! We cooked the sausage seperate from the onions and garlic also, drained sausage and then combined. I also added some assorted chili flakes for extra spice. Instead of penne pasta I used sprial. I was fantastic!!! Serve with a chilled salad and some crusty french bread. I will make this again!!!

I made this last night for dinner and my fianc and I LOVED it there was not a scrap left over! I did however make a few changes which I would suggest you Please follow. First don't cook the sausage with the onions and garlic. I cooked the sweet turkey sausage separately to avoid all the added grease. I sauted the onions and garlic with some red pepper flakes then added the white wine and then added the cooked sausage. Also you definitely need more tomatoes to form a sauce. I used the one can of diced tomatoes and then added half of a can of whole tomatoes which I broke up with a spoon.....cook for about 10 minutes then I added only half a cup of cream this is really all you need. Cook a little while longer and then added a few pinches of flour to make it a little thicker. It was simply delicious. A rich creamy tomato sauce with a kick was the result and also there was not too much fat what more could you ask for!

I've made this recipe three times now. It's fun to make and always enjoyed by our guests. Plus, it tastes so delicious and looks so appetizing, it can make a cook think he's a chef, if not just for one night. (Buy the good sausage, it's worth it)

This was deliciously naughty; something I'd order in an Italian restaurant and be quite pleased with. I used the spicy Italian chicken sausage from Whole Foods as recommended. I also substituted 1 cup of fresh basil and 1 T. dried oregeno for the parsley, and added 1/4 t. cayenne pepper per a second recommendation. I'll taste the sauce before adding the cayanne next time as it was spicier than I needed. I'll also use a second can of tomatoes next time. The leftovers are excellent.

I have made this dish several time and have begun to add my own twists that make it more enjoyable. Use only a good quality sausage, life is too short to eat fatty super store sausage. I also add other items like roasted red bell pepper, sundried tomatoes and have even tried steamed asparagus. (I never tried them all together, but why not give it a shot)

Tasty, tasty, tasty! I accidentally bought hot italian sausage and it worked out really well. This is a very flavorful meal. I usually don't like cream sauce or sausage (heavy/fatty), but I liked this dish very much. My boyfriend vehemently demanded I make it again (maybe I'll demand a new pair of shoes next time he wants it) and my brother asked for the recipe. And my cat really like the aroma.

After having seen this for so long in the constant comment section, I had to try it. Its very easy, and had a great kabang! flavor (yeah, its not subtle, as someone commented earlier, but neither is chocolate cake). I used turkey sausage- half hot, half sweet - probably next time would use all hot. So easy, I'd make it again any time for a family dinner, although probably not for company.

I've made this recipe twice and both times it's turned out superb. I use spicy italian sausage and omit the parsley. This time, I doubled the sauce and served it and the parmesan alongside the pasta instead of tossing with it. I also used fresh tomatoes from the garden and when I added the white wine, I reduced it more than the 2 minutes the recipe calls for - more like 10 minutes until there wasn't a drop of liquid left, just intense flavor. I'm not fond of thin sauces, so this time I thickened it with a little cornstarch and water mixture. Unbelievable...with the fresh tomatoes and longer reducing time, the dish seemed to explode with flavor. My husband kept saying "wow" after each bite and asked if I could please make it more often. Worth every calorie and fat gram.

This recipe is always in the "Constant Comment" section and well it should be because it is superb. I have made this on numerous occasions before my husband was diagnosed with high cholesterol which necessitated on cutting back on dishes like this; however, we still enjoy it every now and again as a treat. It cannot be stressed enough that you need to use really excellent sausage for this recipe. I use the housemade Spicy Italian Chicken sausage from Whole Foods Market (a sort of nationwide health-food store) and also be sure to use real imported Parmiagiano Reggiano cheese. This is the best!

I just wasn't wild about it. Guess I like a thicker, creamier sauce with more flavor. Maybe it's because I didn't use a GOOD sweet Italian sausage but a supermarket brand. If I did it again, I'd add zucchini or something else - was kind of monotonous.

This recipe has been a favorite for us since it first appeared in the magazine. I go very light on the parsley. I also don't add the parmesan cheese to the serving dish, preferring to pass freshly grated parmesan (reggiano, of course!) at the table so that people can add it to taste. It may be a heart attack on a plate, but you can lighten it up by using less sausage as well as using and half and half rather than heavy cream. I make it 2 or 3 times a year. Maybe Snackwells will come out with a version for those who are extremely health conscious.

This is the most delicious pasta recipe I've ever tasted. I cut down the amount of pasta to half a pound and cut down the parmesan cheese to 1/2 a cup. Otherwise, there wouldn't have been enough sauce. I couldn't stop eating it. It is reminiscent of pasta with vodka sauce. I'm sure that it is a recipe that I will make often.

What a change of pace for your typical red sauce! My family loved this recipe--both when I made it with italian sausage and when I made it omitting the sausage. Both times it was delicious. A couple of changes that I made--I did not use the parsley. Instead, I added 1/4 cup fresh basil, 1 T. dried oregano, and 1/4 t. cayenne pepper with the tomato additon. I took other readers' advice and doubled the tomatoes. I also added the parmesean cheese to the sauce instead of tossing it in with the pasta. This made it easier for leftovers. What a great dish!

Boy, this dish was excellent! I changed the recipe around as well, it was pretty easy. I used about 2 tbsns. each of parsley, fresh basil and oregano instead. I also used two cans of the tomatoes, and about 1.5 cups of half and half instead of the heavy cream. I agree as others have said, if I had followed the recipe as written, there never would have been enough sauce for 1 lb. of pasta! I also used about 3/4 cup total of the cheese. I also used 1/2 lb. of sweet turkey sausage and another 1/2 lb. of low-fat hot Italian sausage, it was really good, my husband loved it, and we have tons of leftovers for tonight. Served with semolina bread and salad. This is a keeper!

Very nice flavor. I had the advantage of purchasing the sausage at the Italian Market in Philly. Used cellentani (kind of like a a thick, ridged fusilli) instead of penne, which held the sauce well.

When I make this dish again, I will definitely omit the parsley. It took the dish from yum to ho-hum. Otherwise, it was fairly good. I was expecting a lot more from the other reviews.

After reading all the great reviews I had to try this recipe! I followed some of the suggestions such as using half sweet and half hot Italian sausage, adding an extra can of tomatoes (minus the liquid) and used half and half instead of whipping cream. It was very tasty! I will make it again but most probably for a special occasion...it is very rich for everyday fare. Try it!

Very easy to prepare and still tasted great. I didn't add the Parmesan cheese at the end, as I thought it would have made the sauce too salty. Also, I agree with another reviewer who said to cook the onions and garlic at a lower temperature, then increase the heat when adding the sausage. This recipe is great if you want to impress your friends with a minimal amount of work!

This dish was very good and a nice change of pace from the traditional penne with sauce. One note of correction - I felt there was not enough "sauce" so next time I would double the amount of canned tomatoes and perhaps use a lighter cream. Although it tasted great, I would be concerned with the added fat of the whipping cream. I would definitely serve this again with those 2 changes in mind.

This dish has become a staple in our home. The only change I have made since I began making it, is that I now use spicy Italian sausage. It is absolutely wonderful - my daughter who does not like sauces in general loves it and it is one of my husbands favorite pasta dishes-and he used to be a vegeterian! The longer you let it simmer after adding the cream, the richer the color and flavor. This means you can make it and have it done a couple of hours ahead of time and then just warm it up!

Following some of the advise of previous reviewers, I used a large onion and 6 cloves of garlic, which I sauteed with the sausage--sliced into rounds. Lots of fresh basil was a welcome addition. Next time I will try using at least some hot sausage, or perhaps an andouille (spicy Cajun sausage). There will certainly be a next time! Oh, I made this for two, using 3/4 lb. of the sausage and all of the sauce--we got two nice meals from it--its even better the next day!

It took an hour to read all the reviews!! but worth it. I followed many suggestions (& experience) and used a large onion, half hot Italian sausage and half sweet Italian Turkey Sausage. I would have used turkey for both but couldn't find it in hot. I added 6 cloves of garlic, a can + 2 large fresh tomatoes chopped, 1/4 cup each of chopped basil and parsley and substituted evaporated skim milk for the cream - which I added at the end to avoid curdling. I also cut back the pasta to half (for 2)and served the pasta and sauce separately. There was enough sauce leftover for another meal. With all the changes the recipe had great flavor but I agree that the original recipe would have been lacking. The basil really made a difference.

I thought it was okay, but wouldn't order it at a restaurant or bother to make it again. Sorry, but we'll try another recipe the next time!

My husband liked this dish that I added to my monthly dinner calander as one of my "new recipe" items and he loved it!!! He said I could make it a couple of times this next month. The arouma of it while cooking had my mouth watering. And my tastebuds were not disappointed! This is a keeper.

I used all fresh ingredients and this was a very delicious dish. When I make it the next time I will use half mild italian and half hot italian sausage in order to add a little more spice. However this is a very good recipe and was enjoyed by six guests.

Quick and easy. We loved this dish so much that we made it for dinner two nights in a row!... We couldn't get sweet sausage or smoked sausage, so we used ordinary (raw - but boiled them first) sausages and the results were stunning!

I'm not a fan of sausage so I made this dish using chicken breasts cut up into 1 inch chuncks, salted, peppered and skrinkled with cayenne pepper for zip. Followed a suggestion and used 2 cans of the tomatoes but only juice from one can. Otherwise, left everything the same and it was very tasty.

I couldn't find italian sausage anywhere and so replaced it with polish sausage - and it was delicious. We eat a lot of pasta and usually use store-bought sauces. This recipe was so easy to follow, it turned out beautifully. When I was halfway through making it, I thought "Boy, there's a lot here" (I was only cooking for two) and when I finished cooking it, I turned the page and it said 'Serves 6' - still, my husband was more than happy to eat it heated up for two more days!

This is a simple, yummy and satisfying dish. As a twist, I use half hot/half sweet sausage in the sauce. Also, I cook the pasta, place in a large casserole, cover with the sauce, then sprinkle the cheese on top and bake at 325 for about 20-25 minutes. Makes a hearty casserole that lasts for several meals (for 2)

Rating: 3
My husband loved it and the kids ate it too!! I recommend that you saute the onions and garlic at a lower temperature and then up the temperature when you add the sausage. At medium high the onions and garlic cook too fast and they are hard to manage with that little amount of oil and butter. I agree that increasing the amount of onions would be beneficial, but unless you really like garlic I would leave that at 3 cloves. This dish is delicious, very filling and "something different"!!

I made this recipe with a couple of changes since I did not have the exact ingredients. I used fresh oregeno instead of parsley and I also added a couple of teaspoons of chili/garlic paste to add some zip. My boyfriend commented on how yummy it was and usually detests when I serve him pasta.

This was an easy pasta dish great on a cold winter's day. The dish was tasty, however, it could use a bit more zip. I might try adding more onions, garlic, and crushed red pepper to taste. I served a nice salad and a crusty bread with this dish. A nice addition to my recipe box.

I now make this dish quite often, and we love it. A couple suggestions/pointers, though: It's safe to substitute the butter with some extra olive oil, but not the cream. Low-fat dairy ruins the sauce. As always, use a wine you'd be happy to drink, the drier the better. We like a good sauvignon blanc over the several other varietals we've tried. Use the sweet sausage -- hot destroys the balance.

Rating: 4
I probably make this dish once a week. I live alone, so I cut it down a bit, reducing everything to 3/4 of what's in the recipe except the tomato. I buy an interesting sausage (such as one that already has cheese or garlic or tomatoes in it) to kick up the taste quotient. Family members love it!

Rating: 3
This recipe is very tasty. The sauce didn't seem to thicken as much as I would have expected, but this is easily remidied. I used sweet italian sausage the first time and added sliced button mushrooms. Hot italian sausage sounds even better...

Made this recipe for friends and everyone really liked it. I thought is was more than a little bland, but with some doctoring it could be really good..maybe some spicey sausage and/or some crushed red chili. Definitely, I enjoyed the creamy tomato sauce so will probably make it again.

This recipe is "Haute Hamburger Helper!" I offer an alternative version (from cheap college days) Brown 1/2 pound of hamburger or sausage. Mix with 1 prepare package of Kraft macaroni & cheese and 1 drained can of tomatoes. Voila! 80% of the taste - 20% of the effort.

Can't any body READ a recipe to know how much cream or fat is in it before they make it? This is a typical whats-in-the-reefer supper. Half and half just does not go with tomato.

Great pasta recipe without the usual tomato sauce. The creamy tomato sauce along with the sausage was great. Next time I will try hot sausage instead. Both my husband and I agreed, this would be a great "company" dish.

I have to say this recipe is definitely going into the waste basket. What a waste of time and effort this was, not to mention all the wasted fat and calories I ate. I wish I knew, I would have eaten a half a cheesecake instead, at least I would have loved it. Worth it? Definitely NOT!!

I omitted all of the whipping cream and parmesan cheese, substituted hot italian chicken sausage for the pork sausage, and added some crushed red pepper flakes. Much healthier than the above version, but still incredibly tasty!

I must agree with the last two cooks - this dish was extremely fair - I don't understand what all the raving is over! My husband also thought it was just okay and with all that cream in it - it's just not worth the calories! Sorry but this recipe won't be going to my recipe box!

Rating: 2
I'm not quite sure why there is so much fuss over this recipe ... it was good, but nothing to write home about. I really didn't like the sausage in this, and there wasn't enough tomato. I know I won't be making it again, as there are plenty of other pasta sauces out there I like much better. If I'm going to splurge and have a cream sauce, I'd rather have Spaghetti Carbonara.

I made this dish as part of a buffet for 50 people! (I made 10 batches of the sauce!) I also put in 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes when I browned the sausage. Everyone loved it!

I agree with the other reviewer that said maybe she eats in too many restaurants. For me this was above average for home fare but not up to a good Italian restaurant. I followed the recipe except I used hot Italian sausage (a mistake) and half and half (also a mistake). The sauce can't stand up to the strong flavor of the sausage. I think that this recipe would be much better with seafood such as scallops rather than sausage. It is a good start for experimenting.

Tried this recipe thanks to everybody's comments. My family loved it and I have added it to our 'permanent collection'. It is fast, easy and very flavorful.

I tried this just to see what all the talk was about! It's quick and easy and the flavours mix nicely - I think the parsley paired with the sweet sausage gives quite a unique taste so I wouldn't substitute that. Basically, I think this is really just a twist on spaghetti and meatballs!

After reading several reviews, I incorporated a few of the suggestions, namely doubling the tomatoe (I cut back on the cream), and adding basil and oregano. I used a spicy italian sausage.

This is great and definitely better the second day. I made several alterations. I added about 1-1/2 lbs assorted sauteed mushrooms - portobello, oyster, cremini and shiitake, significantly increased the liquid ingredients per previous reviewers, added some fresh basil and used about 2-1/2 cups of cheeses: Parmesan, Gorgonzola, Fontina & sharp Asiago. I baked it topped with bread crumbs & toasted pine nuts, sprinkled with extra cheese. Serve with a simple salad and crusty bread. You won't be disappointed!

We've made this dish 4 times now and it never gets old. There are 2 changes I would make to the regular recipie though. One.. double the onions.. and two.. use another can of tomatoes. Drain the juice out of the second can though. The sauce is a little sparse in the original recipie and the second can of drained tomatoes makes it about perfect. It also gives the sauce more flavor. I'd highly recomend this. Quick, easy and delicious!

If you're going to substitute evaporated milk for the cream, make sure you don't let it simmer, or it'll curdle. Just swirl it in at the very end. I found the taste just fine. I also used basil from the garden instead of parsley. This recipe is a perfect weeknight no-brainer, and very comforting.
