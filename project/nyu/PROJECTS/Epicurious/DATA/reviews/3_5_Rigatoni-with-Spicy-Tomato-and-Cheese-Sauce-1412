I served over gnocchi (which it worked great with) but other than that I followed the recipe. My friends and I enjoyed it but I have a couple of criticisms. First of all, I think there's way too much red pepper. I love spicy food, but I think that the pepper flakes overpower the rest of the sauce. Also, The amount of cheese in the recipe is completely unnecessary. I tasted after putting 3/4 of the cheese in, then again when I put the rest in. There was really no difference. Save yourself the calories and put less cheese in.

We liked this dish - my husband especially. Now I look at it, I changed almost every ingredient: canola oil for butter, skim milk for whole milk and chicken broth, crushed tomatoes instead of diced, less hot pepper, and a combo of cheddar, smoked fontina and parmesan for the cheeses, about 2 cups total. And I added an onion and some garlic. If I had it all to do again, (which I will) I would make the same changes: a little lighter and no sacrifice in flavor.

This was yummy and easy. I added garlic to the butter (and a splash of wine)which I think was a wise choice. I like spicy but this was superspicy, I will use half the amount of pepper and flakes next time. Where I live cheddar is hard to come by and very pricey so I used it very sparingly but it was still very good with the romano. I also through in a bit of the tomato juice for a little rose taste and colour. I will definitely make this again with the spice adjustment.

As per other reviewers suggestions, I added veggies galore: asparagus, criminis, onions, and garlic. I used all the cheese it called for, though, 'cuz we're cheesy, and that's about as much as I use in my Alfredo. BUT instead of two cups of cheddar, I substituted one of the cups with parm. This will now be my new fattening pasta night specialty-- rich and spicy, just like I like my men.

This was a tasty dish. I should say that I made some minor changes (not as drastic as some others). I used tortellini, evaporated milk, and parmesan reggiano, since these were things I had on hand. I also used slightly less pepper flakes, since I'm not such a fan of spice with cream sauce. I did have a problem with the flour clumping in the butter at the start, but I think that was my fault since I used low-fat margarine (all I have in my kitchen). I had to put it in the blender to get the lumps out. I didn't measure the cheese and probably used slightly less cheddar than was called for. I'm glad though because it was plenty cheesy enough for me, even though I love cheese. All in all it turned out well, and I will make it again. Not spetacular, but as others have said before, good comfort food.

I used skim milk instead of the greater fat amount for the milk. I added mushrooms and onions to give it more of a veggie quality. I used the juice of the tomatoes and the liquid in the mushroom can instead of the broth. I thought that it was very tastey and would gladly make it again. It wasn't too heavy with the skim milk.

I noticed the reviews first (saying "heavy")and then looked at the ingredients....THREE CUPS OF CHEESE?!?! No wonder we're a growing nation! I omitted all the cheese from the sauce, toppping each serving with only about 1Tbs of grated parmesan at the end. But I followed the recipe in every other respect and found that it was still satisfying and rich - and cheesy!

Wonderful dish! I wanted to give this a southwestern kick, so I used the canned diced tomatoes with green chiles with the juices instead of the chicken broth, 8 oz. of chorizo, removed from the casing, browned and crumbled. I used pecorino romano in place of the romano, as that is what I had on hand. I then thinned with a little more milk and some white wine. Everyone RAVED! Will make again with the changes I made. Great comfort food!

Added some garlic. It definitely improved the dish. I agree that it was almost unbearably heavy. I added more broth but I think that veggies are a good idea.

I added some garlic and Italian spices to the sauce and used parmesan instead of romano (its what I had around) -- it was really tasty but also really HEAVY! Next time I'll half the amount of cheese and add some veggies (mushrooms, onions, zucchini etc...)

I would rate this two forks but my husband loved it. For something so high in fat, I don't think the flavor is worth it. I think next time I will try adding some garlic and see if that makes it any better. If you want fattening pasta, I would make the prosciutto and peas in garlic sauce.

A pleasant dish. Easy to make and reheats well. Not something for a fancy dinner, but when it is just the family on a busy night, can't go wrong with pasta. We didn't add too much of the pepper. Instead we stuck to more traditional Italian seasonings (oregano, basil, parsley, etc.) and weren't disappointed. I shall definitely keep this around as a quick/easy meal.

I have made this dish a number of times and always find it to be delicious "comfort" food. I will probably try adding chicken and maybe mushrooms to the recipe the next time I make it.

This recipe is excellent. The first time we made it, we weren't sure what to expect, but as soon as we started eating it, everyone agreed that it was one of the best pasta dishes we'd had in ages. We used linguine instead of rigatoni, though. I just made it again last night ... highly recommended!

This recipe hardly needs any more rave reviews, but I will add mine too, just for the record. I also added chicken which I cooked 3/4 of the way first and then sliced into small strips and put back into the sauce with the tomatoes et al to finish cooking. Yum!!!

I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this recipe. I make it often - although not too, because of the cheesiness. I add more red pepper, like another reviewer recommended. It's fantastic and easy -- no chopping, if you are in a hurry.

A delicious and simple recipe to prepare! Simple is important in this home with a toddler underfoot. Instead of sharp cheddar and Romano I used Colby Longhorn and Parmesan, what I had on hand, and cut back on the amount of crushed red pepper. Next time I'll try it with Harvarti. Yum! Definitely a keeper!

I thought this recipe was just awful. The combination of the tomato with the milk, and two kinds of cheeses was so bizarre. Needless to say, the entire mess ended up in the disposal!

I also made this recipe in about 20 minutes. We loved it and will definitely add it to the list of dishes to make after a busy day at the office, especially since there are plety of left-overs for 2 of us. I used about 3/4 t. of the red pepper and that seemed to be just the right amount of spice.

Changed the broth to a combo of the juices from the tomato & some white wine; sauteed chicken thighs in italian salad dressing then shredded them in at the end, using the dressing, meanwhile, instead of the butter, to saute garlic, diced onion, & the flour; added basil; subbed vietnamese chilli paste for the red pepper; turned it into a casserole w/crushed up ritz crackers, more of both cheese, & chopped green onion on top. Really nice blend of flavors--very hearty and very tasty.

This recipie was very simple to make, I recommend it for pasta lovers and people who like spicy dishes. Next time I will cut back on the red pepper, a little too spicy for me. All of the ingredients were very easy to find at the market.

I made this dish this weekend for some friends, and I was hoping for more. It was very easy, and my guests liked it. I thought it would be a little more tasty. When I make it again, I think I'll add some more veggies (mushrooms, onions).

I made this recipe in about 15 minutes but it tasted like I had worked all evening. I made it more like a casserole, throwing some breadcrumbs and grated cheese on top and placing in the oven for about 10 minutes.
