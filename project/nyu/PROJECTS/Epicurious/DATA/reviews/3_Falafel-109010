I made some changes, but it worked. I used far more herbs, way more parsley and cilantro. I also added the juice of a lemon because it was too dry in the food processor after pulsing. Canned chickpeas worked well; no time for the dried ones. Instead of the drying time, the mix cooled for an hour, and then I patted them out with floured hands. It was important that the oil be 350 and not one degree less, ergo the gloppy mess one reader found. Also, all ingredients went in food processor, coarsely chopped, no other prep. One other thing; I served it with cucumber yogurt tzatsiki sauce - OMG - so good.

I omitted the cilantro and added extra garlic and it was very Yummy! Side note - I forgot the yogurt for the tahini sauce and replaced it with Ranch and it worked out to be a tasty match.

what a gloppy mess! Never made falafel before, followed recipe exactly, and it made some gross falafel.hot oil soup!!!!! I am totally not a novice cook, the patties looked wet, but I figured "oh well, that's what the recipe says to do...."

Wonderful recipe! I actually BAKED my falafel in the oven for about ten minutes at 350 or so, then turned them over and baked the other side for about ten minutes. There was no taste difference, just less greasy! I also didn't have a blender and just finely chopped everything. I'm sure it could have been better, but it's hard to believe, because it really is that good!

This is really good. I didn't have a food processor so I used a blender. I had to add a little water to make it blend, but that was ok.

I didn't have any trouble using canned garbanzos. I did add about 1 tbsp flour to the mix, and sifted a light dusting over the fan as the mixture dried. They made good patties though. I substituted mint for the cilantro and didn't deep fry them - just seared them in a pan greased with olive oil. Then served on pita with yogurt that I mixed with a little Greek Seasoning mix and a couple drops of sesame oil. Yum!

I've made this a lot with canned chickpeas, and just adjusted with flour etc, but tonight I finally had the dissolving felafel problem (home cooked chickpeas, I wasn't thinking). Anyway, a quick save: roll the balls in egg and then in bread crumbs, then fry. Worked like a charm, not exactly a felafel but better than oily goo.

This is actually the same recipe I have been using. I serve it with a mint yogurt dipping sauce and chop fresh mint into the falafal as well. Also, feta is not traditionally served with it, but it makes it that much better!

The most successful falafel I have ever made. Tasted better, probably due to freshness, than any I have eaten before. Crispy, flavourful patties that fried up beautifully. Do try.

I'm sorry, am I missing something? Finely slice garlic and onion, chop the herbs. And then blitz it in the food processor!. Why not just quarter onion, roughly peel garlic and then chuck it all in the bowl? The machine is going to puree it anyway...

You don't have to soak your chickpeas overnight. Bring dried chickpeas to the boil and let boil 2 minutes. Remove from heat and leave covered at least 1 hour. Proceed as directed. This quick-soak method works for any dried bean. Otherwise, great falafel recipe. I use extra spice and make about 2 inch ovals. My husband likes to smash them in his pita after he's added all his garnish. . .and skip the olive oil in the sauce. It's not necessary.

Really delicious, authentic-tasting recipe. Made it twice, and followed the recipe exactly. Some effort to prep all the fresh ingredients, but worth it. Start with dried chickpeas. Recipe has just the right amount of spice.

I followed the recipe very closely and the falafels came out great! I didn't have sea salt so I used regular salt and didn't add enough for the first batch. I was craving the falafel sandwiches that we had in Paris (the old Jewish district) and made a sandwich with garlicky tahini sauce, tomatoes, baba ganouj (recipe from this site), fried eggplant, pickles, parsley, and chili sauce. It was delicious.

I love this recipe! I've made it for my family and for a dinner party recently. You can't go wrong with the dried chickpeas; I usually roll the puree into a 2in diameter ball instead of making a patty. Everything stays compact during frying that way.

to the cook who used canned chickpeas and had a disaster... dried chickpeas are necessary for this recipe (note they are not cooked- only soaked). your batter would have been far too wet. my first time making them, they turned into a puddle in the pan, too. i had some chickpea flour on hand, mixed in quite a bit to my remaining batter, and the rest turned out very well. do try again!

Easy and good - much more fresh tasting than boxed mixes.

Although this was one of my biggest cooking disappointments, ever, I'm not sure that it was because of the recipe. The spices worked out very well, and resulted in very authentic tasting falafel. Unfortunately I used canned chickpeas, and it was a disaster. The patties dissolved in the oil. At least the guests were entertained by that...

We just finished making these and followed the recipe precisely. Not one ingredient overpowers the others. They have a clean flavor and the red pepper leaves a spicy finish. In lieu of the tahini sauce,we spread the pita bread with hummus. Note, we used a ta'amia (falafel shaping tool), it worked great no need to get hands messy. Also used a deep fryer and oil temperature of 340 degrees is critical.

After raving to my husband about how terrific felafel is, this was a bit disappointment. The patties held together fine but the flavor was bland and the sauce uninspired.

Iused canned beans which I thought would not make a difference. Ugh, what a mess! Too runny they broke up in the frying. I added matzo meal to bind and they tasted great.

I didn't know how to make falafel from scratch, so I double-checked before making this recipe, and yes, you grind up the soaked-but-not-cooked chickpeas. It wasn't too much trouble to make at all. Next time I will know to chop the onions very finely before putting the ingredients in the food processor. I also made smaller, one-inch balls -- otherwise they will be likely to fall apart for novice falafel makers! I wound up putting about half of the ground mixture in the freezer. Thawed it out and fried it up another day, and that seemed to work out just fine.

This recipe has some good techniques. Falafel is a very touchy dish. This chef has done well!
