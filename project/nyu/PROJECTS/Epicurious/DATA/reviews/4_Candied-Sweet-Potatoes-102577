Made this exactly as described in the recipe with Jack Daniels and it was delicious! A total crowd pleaser. Even the kids loved it.

This recipe is almost like the one our family has used since the 1920s; the only difference is ours is easier, and the candy-effect is almost like gooey candy. We only prepared the sweet potatoes by cooking until just firm, cool and then peel when ready to 'candy.' Then slice lengthwise, place in a buttered baking pan, sprinkle with brown sugar, dot with butter, and some salt, or not. Bake at same temperature; however, it requires frequent basting. Simple and rave-worthy.

I looked for years for a candied sweet potato recipe because my mother used to make them. This year will be the 3rd time in a row I will make them for Thanksgiving, and it will be a part of my meal every year going forward. I agree about not steaming the potatoes first - no need. These disappear quickly, so make lots!

This was really good and quite tasty. I made it for Christmas dinner and it flashed me back to my aunt's cooking, which was always amazing. I think she even probably served something just like this on several occasions. The bourbon gives it a nice taste.

This recipe went over very well. Like others on here however, my yams fell apart by the end of cooking, I almost feel that if you cut the yams in to thin enough strips, you could skip the steaming step and just cook them in the sugar mixture for a little longer.

This sweet potato recipe is amazing. I didn't think I'd be a fan of candied sweet potatoes, but these turned out delicious. I didn't have any trouble steaming and then cooking. You just have to make sure you baste often. I used very, very large organic yams that were hard as rocks, so maybe that's why I didn't have the same problem with them getting too soft as other reviewers did. (BTW, the recipe works great with Jack Daniels.) I've already had two people ask me for the recipe.

I love this recipe. It's not overly sweet and has nice depth of flavor. I ran into a little trouble with the steaming, so I boiled and mashed them, poured the liquid in and baked them for an hour. Delicious! As with other reviewers, I cooked down the liquids for longer than called for. I added a little more butter after cooking to really round out the flavors. If you don't have bourbon at home, make the trip to the liquor store. It's worth it!

This recipe is surprisingly simple and simply amazing. I did not have bourbon on hand (and probably never will) so I added 1/8 teaspoon of ground ginger and a dash or two of cinnamon. Resulted in great but subtle flavor. Note that the key is to use unsalted butter. Anything else does not work as well.

This was def. the highlight of our Thanksgiving meal. BUT...it had cooked way longer than it said and at times at a much higher heat. Otherwise it wouldn't have carmelized or browned very well. I did use the bourbon and overall the flavor was great!

Delicious! I love cinnamon, marshmallows, and nuts. I was, however, looking for a good candied sweet potato recipe without these ingredients. This is it! Not too sweet, no overpowering cinnamon flavor, and no worries about guests who may be allergic to nuts. It's easy to put together, but pay particular attention to not over steaming the potatoes. Family and friends also love this recipe.

Fantastic and crazy kid friendly. I didn't mind the excess liquid, it all turned out well.

OMG this was OUTSTANDING. I didn't have any bourbon, so I turned to the Captain instead. This turned out to be an excellent call. Next time I'll let the syrup thicken longer before pouring it over the potatoes, and add marshmallows, but everyone I served this for swore they were the best sweet potatoes they'd ever had.

Thanks for posting this recipe! It brought back family memories from 3 generations! I confess I did not try the bourbon. My mom had always par boiled the cut sweet potatoes so I prepped mine that way making sure they were far from tender so they would not fall apart. My mom had always cooked hers in the sugar and butter over a low simmer for what seemed like hours, so I started mine that way and finished them in the oven which seemed like a great idea to thicken the sauce. This recipe was loved by all! We might even have it as a real treat in the middle of the year, too!

I host a Thanksgiving dinner for my family every year. I have an extensive fool proof menu that I've been using over the years, but this year I thought I'd try something new. I picked the Candied Sweet Potatoes to supplement my menu. The recipe calls for a packed cup of brown sugar, which, although I used a lightly packed cup, turned out to be way too sweet for me. I added the juice of a whole lemon, which made it a bit better. About a half of my guests said that they've never tasted anything better, but, as for me and my kids, I will not be making the candied sweet potatoes next year.

I prepared the yams the way the "cook from Pennsylvania" did. Used rum and added some spices. I too had too much liquid in the baking dish. In that case: USE THE BASTER AND REMOVE SOME OF THE LIQUID AND RETURN THE DISH TO THE OVEN. I roasted them 20 minutes more until most of the liquid had evaporated and left a nice caramelization. The pieces were soft but firm and did not turn out mushy. The taste was great.

Rating: 4
This recipe was a hit! I left the peels on so they wouldn't get TOO soft, and it worked out well -- kept the sweet potatoes intact and slipped right off with the flick of a fork. The glaze was really good. If you want a little more holiday flavor, add a dash of allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon!

Rating: 4
Followed the recipe and they were absolutely delicious. IMO, the potatoes were a bit too soft/mushy, but everyone else thought they were fine. A big hit at Thanksgiving. By request, they will be part of our Christmas dinner. :-) I'll skip the steaming step this time, though.

Like so many other reviewers, I skipped the steaming step and just roasted the sweet potatoes. Just before Thanksgiving dinner I heated the potatoes in the oven at 450 degrees for 10-15 minutes. The syrup really carmelized; EVERYONE raved about the potatoes.

It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without candied sweet potatoes. I've been using this same recipe, without the bourbon, for more than 40 years. Don't hesitate to use this recipe if you don't have bourbon. It surprisingly doesn't add that much flavor.

Excellent recipe. I made these last Thanksgiving with no modifications, then this year made some changes. Better this year. First, I added 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1/8 tsp. ground cloves, and 1/8 tsp. ground nutmeg to the sauce, per other reviewers' recommendations. This definitely enhanced the flavor profile. Then, the day before Thanksgiving, instead of steaming, I assembled the sliced sweet potatoes and the simmered sauce in a covered casserole and baked covered for 45 minutes. Keeping the lid on had basically the same effect as steaming. I then cooled and refrigerated overnight, and on Thanksgiving day, I baked them uncovered for 45 minutes. Letting them sit overnight in the sauce allowed the potatoes to soak up all the flavors, and the uncovered baking caused the sauce to thicken, creating a very tasty dish overall. Even my husband, who claims he doesn't like sweet potatoes, had seconds with dinner, then kept picking at them as we sat around the table after dinner. Just a warning - these are so good that 3 lbs. was enough for 6 people with just a little left over. Next time I'll make extra!

I've tried a number of recipes, but this by far is the easiest and most delicious. I kept the ingredients as written, and everyone loved it! I did steam the potatoes the night before and covered with the sauce. Put in the fridge overnight; brought to room temp before baking in oven for just over an hour. Perfect!

I offered to make sweet potatoes last Thanksgiving (my first time) but my family told me not to make them because nobody liked them. So I figured I'd try a new recipe since nobody was going to eat them anyway. So I made them, ran out, and my family asked me to make them again for Christmas. It's very good...looks kinda funny when you make it...but good.

This is a perfect recipe and a new staple to TG holidays. Make it a day ahead. Do not add marshmellows, it's completely unnecessary. I subbed the bourbon with dark rum and it perfect. Double it (and don't put the second serving out) if you want leftovers.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. There were a few slices of potato left over after the meal and as the menfolk were cleaning up - after a huge meal - they stood in the kitchen and polished it off. Everything else went into the fridge. It's going to be a Thanksgiving standard in our house.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year, and everyone loved it. The sweet potatoes were sweet, but not cloyingly so, and the bourbon added a warm note without actually tasting like bourbon, odd as that may sound. Like some of the other reviewers, I skipped the steaming part, and the recipe did not seem to suffer for it, though I also baked them for just about 5 minutes longer. I used dark brown sugar instead of light brown, and added the juice of one orange and 1/2 lemon, and used about 1/3 c. bourbon. This is a fantastic recipe that I'll use over and over again.

This recipe really was *amazing!* I served it with a ham for this year's Easter dinner and everyone LOVED it! I increased the cooking until it started to get a little crispy and chewy and it was fantastic. I didn't have any bourbon so I used spiced rum - will make again and again. I steamed the potatoes at first for just 5 minutes, and they were perfect. Not too mushy at all.

I've made these potatoes every year for Thanksgiving since the recipe was first published in Gourmet. Everyone loves them! Take heed of the advice not to steam your potatoes too long, or they will get too soft and fall apart a bit in the oven. You want them JUST knife tender when you steam them.

I've made this for Thanksgiving two years in a row -- a bit less butter the second time after the recipe was corrected (but a bit more than recommended anyway...). It was delicious both times -- the most requested recipe at dinner. Don't skimp on the bourbon -- the flavour becomes much more subtle after cooking. Make a double or triple recipe so you'll have leftovers...

I've made this recipe many times and this last time I never put it in the oven. I softened the potatoes in the microwave and then finished them on the stovetop in a nonstick deep fry pan where I had been reducing/thickening the sauce while the potatoes cooked. It worked just fine and it was much easier to glaze the potatoes on the stovetop than when in the oven.

Based on the many positive reviews, I chose this dish for Thanksgiving. It was a splendid, fragrant and popular addition. I didn't steam them in a pot but rather in a steamer appliance which is usually slower than a pot, so I steamed them a little longer than recommended. They turned out a bit too soft so I would keep the steaming on the short side next time.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving dinner like so many of the previous viewers and it was a hit. I actually peeled and par-boiled the potatoes since I didn't have a steamer.

I made this for Thanksgiving yesterday. I, like a previous reviewer was wondering if I could skip the step of steaming them prior to baking. So this is what I did: I prepped them and arranged them in the dish I was planning to bake them in. I then added a little water the bottom of the dish and covered them with plastic wrap. I microwaved them for about ten minutes to get them started. I then uncovered them, drained the liquid and proceeded with the recipe. Worked fine. I liked the end result, but would note that I put 1/4c. of Bourbon in the syrup and tasted it. I thought it was on the strong side at that point. However, at the end of the baking time none of us could detect it at all. Next time I will use a third of a cup. I may also add other flavorings, such as orange peel, cloves or ginger. As an aside, another way to candy sweet potatoes is to prebake them, cool, peel, and slice them. Then coat them in sugar and pan fry them in butter. Yum, but more work at the last minute.

Fantastic recipe! I was looking for a classier alternative to the typical American yam/marshmallow/brown sugar dish, and this is perfect. It looks elegant thanks to the browned and caramelized edges, and the aroma when baking is enough to bring the dogs in from all over the neighborhood! I used Asian yams instead of the American variety, as they're naturally sweeter, so I cut the amount of brown sugar by 1/2. I was confused reading the reviews as to how much butter we were supposed to use - apparently it used to say 2 sticks, while the printed version said 1/2 cup, and now it only says 1/2 stick - I used 1.5 sticks simply because I'm a glutton for butter, and it was delicious. Everyone raved about this.

This was a big hit at our Thanksgiving dinner last night. I used rum and it was great. I left them warming in the oven probably long after they were done.

I haven't made this yet. I've been researching recipes for candied sweet potatoes. There's another recipe on this site, where you slice potatoes and then bake for 1 1/4 hours--but you don't precook them. Do you think it's really necessary to precook?

I cut the butter back to 1 1/2 sticks after reading the reviews, and it turned out beautifully. The sauce was terrific. The suggestion of quartering the potatoes lenthwise was a good one, and I was very pleased with the presentation; I arranged the spears in a starburst pattern, with some cranberry sauce in the middle. I'll never open a can of yams again!

I've made this recipe for the past two Thanksgivings, and it's been a consistent hit. The bourbon keeps the candied sweet potatoes from being *too* candied. Bonus - you can make this dish a day or two before Turkey day and simply warm it up before the meal.

There seems to be much too much butter in this recipe...2 sticks??? The liquid was very loose and extremely fatty from all the butter. The slicing of the potatoes was a good way to do them, though, and the flavor, if you pretended all that butter wasn't there, was good. Will make again but cut the amount of butter way back.

Rating: 2
This was a fairly typical recipe for candied sweet potatoes. The bourbon added a nice and somewhat distinctive accent to the dish. I did find that the glaze didn't really "candy"; it stayed somewhat liquidy. Perhaps simmering the syrup longer would solve that problem. All in all, a tasty dish and a snap to make.
