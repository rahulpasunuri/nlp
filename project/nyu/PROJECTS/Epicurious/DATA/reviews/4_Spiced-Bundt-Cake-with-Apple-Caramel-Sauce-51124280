I read the reviews before making this cake, so I began checking it at 50 minutes...and it was already done! So glad I did, because it turned out absolutely wonderful. It's very rich, so you only need to eat a little bit, but that makes the cake go a long way -- perfect for fall/winter parties. The browned butter, almond, and caramel flavors really come through and are enhanced, not obliterated, by the spices. In summary: do make this cake, but check it early! It was perfect at 50 minutes for me, would have been ruined had I gone the full 65-70.

I'm the outlier with reviews so far. Given the about of butter, sugar and eggs I expected this cake to be decadent. It was dry and I only cooked it for 60 minutes. Also with all the spices it was still bland. The caramel sauce was too sweet for me and I think of myself as a sweet tooth eater. Threw away 1/2 the cake as it wasn't worth the calories to keep eating.

The batter for this was delicious and the apple caramel sauce (easy to make)was beyond belief good. I couldn't wait for the cake to be done! I bake a lot and followed the recipe to the letter, taking it out at 65 minutes. It had pulled dramatically away from the edges of the bundt pan and was hard. The inside of the cake was over cooked and not moist. I will definitely make again based on the delicious taste of the batter, but I will start checking the cake at 45 minutes.

While not an easy cake to make this was a huge sensation at my Thanksgiving dinner. I was pretty surprised at how much spice actually goes into it, but it was perfect. Only gripe- I wanted more caramel sauce to dip it in, next time I'd make 1 + 1/2 the recipe!

Absolutely delicious, and now perhaps one of my favorite desserts. The texture is so moist, and the ground almonds do add bite, flavor, and a comforting "hominess" (sorry, I don't know how else to describe it). You *could* have it without the sauce, but that's what really sends it over the top. I had to substitute some of the dark brown sugar with light brown, since I ran out, but I don't think it hurt the cake a bit--I can't imagine it any better! Also, the caramel sauce is so easy and so delicious that I'm trying to find other things to make it for - ice cream is the obvious choice. Tart and apple-y, but so smooth like a bought sauce. It must be the cream of tartar that keeps it so smooth. Don't let the long ingredient list make you think this is complicated! As another reviewer said, tapping the pan is really important. A big poof of air popped out while I was doing it, so who knows how it would have turned out otherwise. Also, I took the cake out after 60 minutes exactly, and it was perfect. I tried to turn it out after 25 minutes of cooling, as it says, but it wouldn't come out. I was starting to get nervous, since I had gotten excited about what I knew would be a beautiful cake. I took a pliable silicone spatula and gently separated the sides as best I could (those Bundt pans have a lot of crimps!), and it slid right out. By then, it had been maybe 35 minutes out of the oven, so that may also be why. Just keep it in mind. A real crowd-pleaser. You will not be disappointed!

This is exceptional. Like a gingersnap cookie in cake form. Unlike the previous reviewer,my cake cooked fine at the given temp. It came out with a nice moist center and a crisper outer crust that was just superb. The sauce is amazing!! I want to try adding apple chunks to it next time. Be sure to tap the bundt pan of raw batter on the counter to displace air bubbles as the recipe tells you. I forgot this step and ended up with 3 giant air pockets in my cake.

What brings this cake from delicious to exceptional is the apple caramel sauce -- raves from everyone who tasted it! The cake is lovely, moist with a complex flavor. Don't think of eliminating the almonds (I almost did, had none on hand). They add texture and depth. One caution -- I found the cake top was browning/scorching 30 minutes into baking time, and covered loosely with foil. Perhaps adjust the oven to 325, or watch closely and cover.
