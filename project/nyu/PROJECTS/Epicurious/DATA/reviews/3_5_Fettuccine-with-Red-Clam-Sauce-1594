This was tasty but so insubstantial.

I make spaghetti and clam sauce for the family often. My kids, ages 7 and 9 love it. I always make the white variety. Today I went poking around epicurious to find a red clam sauce recipe because I don't have white wine for my old standby. I found this recipe and used it as a guide. I liked the result better than I do the white clam sauce I make. Here's what I did. I used about 1/3 - 1/2 cup olive oil. Crushed about 5 garlic cloves and sauteed them till fragrant. THen I took 1 28 oz can of plum tomatoes, zapped them a second in the blender, and threw them in the pot (I didn't have any tomato paste). I let this cook about 5 minutes and opened my humongous can of clams I get at Costco (Seawatch). I drained the water from the can of clams into the tomatoes and let that cook at a rapid simmer on med heat till it was reduced about half. Halfway through the simmer I threw in about 1/2 cup of red wine. Then I got about a 1/2 cup of freshly chopped parsley from my garden and threw that in the pot. Stirred it up, added a few pinched of hot red pepper flakes and let it cook just a few more minutes (Maybe I added the pepper flakes when I added the wine...I can't remember now). Anyway, then I added the clams and turned the heat to low. I let the clams sit in the pot on low heat no more than 5 minutes. I turned off the heat and waited for my pasta (about 1 1/3 lbs of spaghetti) to be done. I drained the pasta, put it back in the pot and poured the clam sauce over it. I stirred it around a bit and let it sit and soak up some of the sauce. Delish! The kids loved it too.

I doubled the garlic, added an extra can of clams (though not all of the juice), and some left over jumbo shrimp. I also added a little more tomato paste, as well as canned diced tomatoes. Also added a ton of red pepper flakes (I like things spicy) and a dash of red wine. Also used linguine instead of fettuccine, and it was as good as any spicy seafood pasta with red clam sauce as I have had in any restaurant! Top it off with a little grated Romano! I will definitely make this again.

This was quick, easy, and delicious! I used all reserve clam juice (about 1 cup) and added chopped onion with the garlic. When I added the parsley, I also added basil and 2 bay leaves. VERY easy to make - quick, simple and impressive. Will definitely make this one again!

Easy, quick, and delicious. I doubled the amount of garlic and I added basil as others suggested.

Incredibly similar to a recipe that recently appeared on Martha Stewart only you substitute 1 cup of milled or crushed tomatoes for the tomato paste. It make a lovely, quick, sauce. We've made it twice in the past three nights!

Easy and delicious. I have made this recipe several times with variations, including using whole wheat pasta, but I always sautee shrimp with the garlic, remove, and add later with the clams. This meal receives raves from my husband without exception.

I thought this was a very easy recipe and tasty after I added a couple Basil leaves and a couple shakes of Italian seasoning. I will make it again adding those spices.

A good base idea for canned clams. I browned a couple of links of Italian sausage, drained the fat and then sautéd 1/2 lb of shrimp with the garlic, removed them and continued adding some additional tomato (any from diced in juice to puree would do nicely) as suggested by previous reviewers.

Very easy recipe but not a favorite. Not enough flavor and an uninteresting sauce (extremely thin). Will not be making this one again...

Very easy to make and tasted great! I made sure to add a little more garlic, cut in half the amount of clam juice and added a can of tomato puree w/ some tomato paste to thicken it up.Perfect!

To make this dish a 4, saute/melt in 2 or 3 anchovies while doing the garlic and add some butter to the sauce just before plating.

I thought this was okay, but not spectacular. I thought it lacked flavor. I will make this again, but add a can of diced tomatoes and maybe some basil to punch up the flavor. To its credit, it was quick & easy with adequate results.

Very easy to make and the results are just fantastic

Finally, a good, quick recipe for red calm sauce! I tossed some poached salmon, crabmeat, and shrimp in with the sauce and had a nice, simple main dish. Paired with a salad and some homemade garlic bread and you have a meal.

Quick and tasty. Especially good as a last-minute, no-time-to-go-shopping dinner. Flexible recipe - I used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato paste, only one can of clams, no clam juice, and served it over fusilli (better for chunky sauces). Definitely planning to make it again.

I'm not much of a cook, but I found this dish quick and easy. I added Porchini mushrooms to it to give it a little extra texture. When I make it again, I think I will make a little more clam sauce to cover the fettucini better.

quick, easy and very good!
