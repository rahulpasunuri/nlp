Surprisingly tasty for something so simple. Don't be hesitant with the onions or mint. Great to serve when veg friends coming for lunch, and to use up all the cucumbers from the garden

This was amazing amounts of delicious for something so easy. I used pita bread instead and it was awesome.

I used my home-made mayo, oaten bread and red onion. I don't like mint in food so I omitted it. It's a nice, simple, tasty sandwich!

I also made these with cream cheese as I dont like Mayo ..and made them as roll ups and cut them for appetizer ... everyone really liked them. I did not have HOT curry and I would have preferred that. I bought some hot curry and am making them again today for a party.

I added a little cream cheese to this and rolled it up in a tortilla, then sliced into bite-sized rounds. What a great combination of flavors! The second time I made this, I used Thai green curry paste - WOW - lots of flavor and heat. My guests preferred these over the milder, sweet curry rollups. I might just stick with the green curry paste.

This is an exotic and tasty treat. I added shredded carrot for that extra crunch to balance off on the creamy curry. The left over sauce is excellent for dippings!

It's one of my favorite quick lunches to make. It's pretty delicious considering how little time it takes to put together. I added an extra half teaspoon of curry powder and used pita bread instead of peasant bread. I also tried it with cilantro, but still like it better with mint.

This recipe sounded so strange, I had to try it. It was really tasty. I made it on mini pitas as an hors d'oeuvre and everyone loved it.
