I've made this pie twice since Thanksgiving and both times, it was a big hit. I brought it to a family dinner along with a pan of brownies for the kids but the kids wanted nothing to do with the brownies and instead were all over the pie! I'll admit I didn't make the topping. I simply sugared/macerated some frozen summer berries and served that as the topping. I have added this as a family favorite to my recipe collection!

do not attempt if you do not regularly cook! I brought this to thanksgiving and what a mistake. The topping and crust is great but the middle takes practice. Make sure to read through all the directions carefully before you attempt.

Great chiffon pie. I made this one day ahead and it worked just fine. Sauce is excellent.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit! So light and airy it was the perfect end to a huge feast. I made a simple graham crust and omitted the jam from the topping so it was more of a sauce. I found this recipie extemely simple to prepare! It was fantastic!

I made this for Thanksgiving the past 2 years and plan to make it again this year. I have had only positive feedback on this recipe. Everyone who tasted it loved it. I think it was well worth the effort. It is also a beautiful presentation. To repeat what others have mentioned you must include the cranberry topping. It makes the pie.

This is a very light and refreshing pie. I don't know if I would serve it for a special occation but the tart lemon flavor and foamy texture make it a very good week night dessert.

I made it for Thanksgiving and it was not a big hit at all - the crust and the topping were good, the filling was not - I don't know if it was something I did wrong, but it had a metallic taste?? Because of this, I'm giving it a 3.

It was so good, but didn't turn out perfectly jelled. I am going to try it again and if it turns out, I will give it four forks.

While reading the reviews of this recipe, I was disappointed that one of the reviewers had not made the topping. It absolutely made the pie! I have made it twice and it is just wonderful!

It was okay, but not worth the steps. It wasn't a big hit at Thanksgiving. I would not make it again.

Light, but great flavor. Perfect after a heavy meal.

i made it and will make it again for thanksgiving. i, too, added extra lemon zest as i like a really tart taste. i didn't add extra juice, but did use my reamer to juice the lemons so i captured some pulp as well. the topping is perfect and a nice complement to the lemon and great for color. i wouldn't omit.

I made the pie but omitted the topping...just didn't feel like fiddling with a sauce. The pie alone is delicious. Very fluffy and lemony. I added more lemon juice and rind than called for, which upped the flavor. And the crust was to die for! Very buttery and satisfying, and a nice ofset to the tart filling. A keeper!

When I bought the magazine and looked at this recepie, I immediately tought about including it for my thanksgiving menu. I tried it last week and it didn't come out as I expected. The filling is not enough and it doesn't have any taste. THe topping is great tought. Various members of my family tasted the recepie and they didn't like it either. It looks better that it tastes
