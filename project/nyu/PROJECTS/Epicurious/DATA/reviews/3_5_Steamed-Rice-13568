This is a classic method for steaming grains. The advantages are perfect results each time, and that no measuring is necessary: just add the grain to boiling salted water, then steam to finish. The timing for brown rice is 20 minutes of boiling, and 30 minutes of steaming; for wild rice, 25 and 40 (although I prefer wild rice cooked in broth). This can be adapted to cook any grain. Basic recipes like this - and the steamed broccoli - certainly belong on a cooking site. There's always a call for a review of Food 101.
