I have made this several times with sour cherries and even with blueberries (got desperate for more after cherries were out of season!). The flavor is outstanding--the aromas of the spices are rather warm and wintry (think mulled wine), which makes the results a pleasure to enjoy at any time of year. It is important to watch the texture of one's own particular batch of fruit--test one for texture before deciding whether they have simmered long enough.

Yum. Had it over ice cream and it was great. I agree that adding a little corn starch to thicken is a good addition.

I can only imagine how good this would be with a nice Kirsch........I had to use a cherry flavored brandy but the aroma and flavors are wonderful. Love using the bay leaf which does not overpower at all. Plan to serve this with the almond cake with kirsch from this site,

Although this recipe smelled so good cooking and tasted wonderful, my cherries were a bit tough. Maybe I didn't cook them long enough.

I was a bit worried about the spices and flavors in this, but i made it anyway and figured if i didn't like it it was an expensive dish to throw out. It was awesome the flavors were very mild, i put it on a NY cheesecake and there was not a slice left. Be brave ... TRY IT!I thickened it with cornstarch by the way it worked great.

Wow. You wouldn't think cherries could be rich, but these are, and I could only eat about 6. I've been known to polish off an entire bag of bings... oops! :-)

This is absolutely delicious. I made it as an accompaniment to brioche tart -- and it nearly perfect. Next time, I will reduce the syrup even further, as it was still quite liquid when reduced to the amount indicated in the recipe. That's a minor quibble, though -- the flavor is excellent and the people I shared this with raved about it.

This is an elegant, adult dessert. I hope people try it, because it is a nice way to use sour cherries that doesn't involve a crust! One problem, which was my fault--I walked away from the syrup as it was reducing and came back to a burnt caramel. So, I just made the syrup again and kept an eye on it. Delicious.
