Made these last night, and will not make them again. No matter how long I fried them, they still felt raw inside. They were cooked through, they just felt raw, because of how moist the dough is. They actually were better cold. I think the recipe is missing at least 1 important point - you need to cook the flour with the butter/juice mixture to dry it out as much as possible. This is how it is normally done with this kind of dough (for cream puffs, etc).

Wow, when I put the dough in the oil they just puffed up by themselves. The temp of the oil is very important though. Too hot and they burn. They were a hit.

The best beignets I've had. The almond sugar takes it over the top.
