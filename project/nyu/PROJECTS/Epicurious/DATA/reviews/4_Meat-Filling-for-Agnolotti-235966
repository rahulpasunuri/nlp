I made this recipe after reading Alan Tardi's book, Romancing the Vine. It makes for a long day in the kitchen, but is exquisite in results. Roasting the meats lends a beautiful caramelization that really creates an "old-world" flavor. This will easily make 4 separate batches for the freezer. For a real treat, serve with Alan's Sugo di Carne Festa Della Bussia (recipe in the same book). Unquestionably one of the best meat sauces I have made!
