I made this for Thanksgiving. It is good but I didn't pick up on the chives and I think I over baked it as it was pretty firm. The vanilla bean seeds should be scraped into a little of the milk to separate them. I couldn't get them to 'unclump'. Not too sweet, not too much butter.

The previous reviewer must have been looking at a different recipe. I have the original magazine and there is no cheese listed. Might be good though.

this recipe is excellent but they left out one ingrediant, 1/2 cup grated sharp cheddar. You add this in with the eggs. I have the origanal recipe and the just left it out.

I thought this was very bland. To be fair, I didn't use vanilla bean (just extract), so maybe that's why. The group liked it, but no one raved. Well, except for my 2 year old who gobbled it up! I did like the custard/quiche-like texture though and will try it again with some flavor modifications.

Excellent recipe! Very tasty, and not too sweet for a side dish, so long as it's served alongside something savory. Like everyone else says, it needs a full hour in the oven, rather than 45 minutes. Also, I think a 2-qt dish works just as well as a 1 1/2-qt dish, so don't worry about having to run out to buy one (I'm assuming 2-qt is the standard).

I couldn't find my mother's corn and squash casserole recipe so I tried this recipe instead. It is delicious and delicate (well, as delicate as something with whole corn kernels can be), very nearly a custard. No one missed the corn and squash casserole and we all had seconds. I baked the pudding for a good hour before it set up.

I have made this many times and always come back to it because it is not as sweet as other corn pudding recipes. The chives are a terrific addition.

Excellent. Sweet, tasty, filling, and very easy to make. Definitely don't skip on adding the fresh chives in the end.

I loved this dish. I plan on making it for Thanksgiving. Cooking time took a bit longer than indicated. For last 15 min, turned stove up to 425 degrees.

Great recipe. It has been a Thanksgiving favorite for several years now.

This recipe is just what it says...a pudding. It is very sweet, almost like dessert, which was not for me. Others at the party liked it and half the kids liked it as well, but I would rather make a corn spoon bread - something a bit more savory, but with a touch of sweetness and a heavier consistency.

I used fresh corn cut off the cob, as we have lots left over in the summer. Outstanding! 4cups fresh corn is equal to 19 oz. frozen. I wouldn't bother with vanilla bean. I agree 60 minutes for cooking. My guests all left with the recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner 2003, and everyone kept going back for seconds. Even my picky brother-in-law liked it. A holiday keeper. Simple to make and will make again.

This recipe is amazing. I use an 8 inch cake pan to make this and it takes 1 hour to set. I personally did not think it was too eggy as other reviewers did, but if you don't like eggs, don't make it!

I thought this was wonderful. It is very eggy though; really a more quiche-like texture than I expected. I used an 8x8x2 pan and it took about an hour and 10 minutes to firm up.

Fantastic recipe but 45 minutes cooking time is not enough. I doubled the recipe and made the mistake of putting it in a deep dish for cooking. As a result, it took well over an hour to cook and even then it was a bit moist and eggy in the center. In the future I'll use a larger and more shallow dish to ensure it solidifies properly. I used an actual vanilla bean but had to look into a cookbook to find out what to do with it (open the pod with a knife and just scrape out the black material inside -- don't use any of the pod itself). I suspect using a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract would work just as well. Family loved the recipe and we will definitely make it again.

Substituting soy milk for regular milk works fine in this recipe. But don't do as I did and try to leave out the eggs!

Yum! I halved the recipe, but used a 16-0z pkg of corn by mistake and it still worked well. Didn't use the chives or nutmeg, & they weren't missed. Vanilla seeds are the secret ingredient!

I've made this corn pudding twice in two weeks for two big dinners and everyone really loved it. I substituted about 4 green onions for the chives and topped off with nutmeg. I also poured it into a 2 quart casserole dish and baked it for about 60 minutes. It has a really nice custard-with-sweet-corn taste and texture. It really disappears fast at my house and everyone wanted the recipe. Thanks so much.

This was good with Thansgiving dinner and everyone enjoyed it. I did find it a bit moist/eggy, but it was still a nice addition. It is better if you bake it a bit longer.

A great side dish. I agree with the reviewer who recommended 60 and not 45 minutes. I also had corn that was very sweet and I omitted the sugar completely. I suspect the sugar should be adjusted depending on the sweetness of the corn.

Great corn pudding recipe! Didn't change anything, except for cooking 60 minutes instead of 45.

Rating: 4
This was a wonderful side dish. The flavors were distinct, yet subtle. The pudding was cooked in advance and reheated just before serving, and it stood up well to that "abuse". I will be making this for Thanksgiving!

I loved this and so did my company. I didn't have chives so I subbed green onions instead and also cut the butter. Wow! I did have to bake longer (and I halfed the recipe!) so make time for that as well as time to cool and set up after baking. I served this at room temp and it was fantastic.

This is always a hit evertime I make it. It takes closer to an hour and a half to bake if you have a gas stove and I usually use less butter and a dash more salt when I make it. It's also extremely important to let it cool before serving, the more it is set the better the taste.

Easy to do; got great raves at our neighborhood Thanksgiving Dinner. But it takes a little longer than 45-minutes to bake.

This has become a staple at every holdiay gathering in our family. The vanilla bean is what makes is so special, I think. I make this the night before and partially bake it ( about 25-30 minutes). It should be set up about 3/4 of the way through, but not brown, dry or tough around the edges. Then I refrigerate and finish baking the next day. (another 20 minutes at 350) This way I can take it to a gathering without any fuss. I also reduce the amount of butter- the full amount in the recipe leaves a lot of butter at the top after cooking.

I really like this dish...and I typically don't like corn pudding. I don't know how they fit it into a pie or quiche pan; I had to use a lasagna pan. I used 2% milk. The second time I made it I cut the butter to 3 tablespoons and liked it much better.
