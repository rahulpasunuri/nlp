Soooo good and fairly simple to make. I used beef stock instead of wine simply because I didn't have the wine on hand. Really delicious! thank you

Made this as written, except that I substituted some home canned tomato sauce for the whole tomatoes in juice. With the "made fresh daily" sausage from our local market, the sauce was out of this world good (thanks to the tip to use half sweet and half spicy sausage). Quality ingredients make all the difference in such a simple preparation.

I made this last night using hot italian turkey sausage, and fortified pasta(Barilla Plus). I doubled the garlic, we love garlic, but didn't make any other changes. It was delicious, and healthy. I'll be making this regularly.

Love this! It's one of our favorite Friday night meals. We use the hot spicy Italian sausage though. And the bell pepper must be green to distinguish it from the tomatoes because the man of the house doesn't like bell peppers and insists on picking them out.

I totally agree with the reviewer from the San Francisco Bay Area who says a similar recipe, "Penne in Cream Sauce with Sausage,"(February 1997 issue of Bon Appetit) is better and just as easy.

A quick and easy dinner that's yummy. I use 4-5 cloves of garlic, a large red pepper or 1 1/2 small ones, and I pack the cheese. I had read reviews that this was dry so the first time I made this, I only added 1/2 the pasta and then added more until I had a good mix. I ended up using about 2/3 of the pound of pasta. I grate lots of extra cheese on top and serve with crusty bread and a good red wine.

Great simple, mid-week supper. I used sheels instead of penne. They catch bits of meat and tomato, making for a more exciting mouth sensation. I also used half hot sausage, which adds a nice kick. This is what Italian food should be: simple, careful preparation with high quality ingredients. Magnifico!

I've made this recipe several times, following the recipe as written. It's a good recipe that turns out well, and is relatively quick and easy. Nothing spectacular, but a good weeknight standby.

This was just okay. A nice change from regular red sauce, but nothing too special.

Used 1/2 hot Italian sausage, 1/2 sweet. All sausage from local sausage maker. Do retain extra liquid from pasta if making a little ahead and keeping warm. Excellent, enhanced by modest bottle of chianti!

This is a great recipe for a quick weeknight dinner. It doesn't make a lot of sauce but it is still delicious. I tried it once with Pecorino-Romano cheese instead and that was great too!

Not bad, not great. I used turkey sausage and added two cans of tomatoes instead of the one one. I also added some heavy cream to it. I would imagine it would be incredibly dry without the extra can of tomatoes.

I also added some sauteed cremini mushrooms (halved/quartered, depending on size) to the sauce and simmered it for at least 30 min on low heat. The leftovers were fantastic as well.

I added half cup of heavy cream that someone had suggested in the recipe review and that added alot to the recipe.

Add one small onion saute with peppers and garlic. Use 1/4 lb Penne rather than 1Lb.

Simple, easy weeknight meal. I simmered the sauce for much longer than called for - about 40 mins or so to allow sauce to better soak up sausage flavor. Also added 1/4 cup whip cream during last 5 minutes to thicken and add some richness. Hearty fall family fare. Will make again.

This is simple and tastes great and I will definitely make it again. I actually feel guilty that it was so easy but I'll never tell!

This is so easy and delicious. Not the most complex sauce ever, but simple and fresh and FAST! However, I had WAY more pasta than necessary and halved the amount of pasta called for so we had lots of the sauce.

This recipe is very similar to one that was published in 1997 "PENNE IN CREAM SAUCE WITH SAUSAGE" - the addition of cream makes it superior to this newer recipe. It's just as easy, too.

I was worried that this might need some additions, but I'm pleased to report that it was great as-is! Definitely super easy and a perfect week-night meal.

This dish is quick, easy and delicious! I did not have the red bell peppers, so i substituted onion and it was great! Serve with hot bread to soak up the delicious sauce!
