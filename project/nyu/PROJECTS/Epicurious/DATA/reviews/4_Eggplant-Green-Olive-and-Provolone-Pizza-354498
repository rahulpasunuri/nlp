Excellent. I used a gluten-free pizza mix, which has to be made in the oven but ends up nice and crispy anyway. Also grilled the eggplant in the oven, and that took about 30 minutes with the oven at 400F. For the olives I used spicy green ones from the farmers market and added a few sauteed oyster mushrooms too. Instead of provolone I used sliced yogurt cheese (from Trader Joe), perhaps a bit saltier than provolone? Served with sauteed greens this made a really good dinner.

This has become our new favourite pizza to grill. So quick, easy and delicious. I used Sicilian green olives from the deli. Great flavour combination! Have made it many times, even my teens love it.

This was even easier than I expected, and the crust was SO delicious made on the grill! Next time, however, we'll be sure to follow the directions for the amounts of salt & pepper to use on the eggplant -- we just sprinkled with S&P to simplify but it definitely needed more salt. Also, we bought large seasoned green olives from a fancy olive bar and they weren't salty enough, either. So next time we'll use the ones from a jar and just take out the pimento stuffing. Even despite the blandness of our toppings, the crust was incredible so we'll be making this on a regular basis.

such an AMAZING flavor!!! you can do this without the crust for just a veggie side and it is equally incredible. i have used curly as well as flat parsley and either is great. even cheap olives with the pimentos work fine, and i'm usually very picky so this tells you that this recipe allows flexibility! I only grill the eggplant slices and not the whole pizza - just find it easier to put the pizza in the oven once it is assembled. But the grilled eggplant is a much richer flavor than doing eggplant any other way so I wouldn't skip that. GREAT!

Very tasty and easy to make. I recommend cooking the eggplant for a bit longer than the recipe says. Also, we used kalamata olives instead of green olives, which worked really well. Last, we added some feta cheese the next day when we reheated it in the oven and will definitely sprinkle with feta in the future.

It's been four days since they announced the closure of Gourmet Magazine. I wanted to celebrate the Magazine last night, and I have an abundance of eggplant in my garden, so I searched some recent issues and found this wonderful recipe. Fast, delicious and a great surprise for my wife when she got home. Thank you, Maggie, and all the editors at Gourmet for providing wonderful recipes like this for so many years.

Delicious. I made my own crust so it ended up being more like a Sicilian-- just as yummy though! I used a stove top grill and just covered with foil when the recipe called for covering. Next time I will add palm hearts and corn.

deeelicious! What a great recipe. My eggplant took longer to cook than this recipe states, however. http://apricosa.blogspot.com

This was delicious. I added tomatoes and used a whole wheat dough from Trader Joe's. It was very easy for a weeknight dinner. I think articokes would also be a nice addition. My husband commented that he thought it might be bland, but was pleasantly surprised that it was not. I think the garlic oil on the eggplant and crust, saltiness of the green olives, as well as the flavor of the provolone made for a flavorful pizza.
