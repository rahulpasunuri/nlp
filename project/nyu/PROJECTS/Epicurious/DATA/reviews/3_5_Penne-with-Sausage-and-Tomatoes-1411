I just realized I forgot the marjoram. Nevertheless, this was awesome! Next time I will make a vat and freeze it.

This is exactly what I was in the mood for! I had regular italian sausage so I added about 3/4T of red pepper flakes, then subbed about 1-2T fresh marjoram for the dried. Nice and spicy!

I've been making this sauce for years! I always make at least a double recipe and freeze the extra sauce in 2-cup containers. That seems to make the perfect amount for 8 oz. of dried pasta. I do use 1/2 hot & 1/2 sweet Italian sausage most of the time. We like the blend of flavors.

My father always had a subscription to Bon Appetit and he has been making this recipe since it was published in 1990. This has always been a family favorite and the recipe I requested for my birthday dinner all thru high school. It is still my favorite pasta dish and easy enough that I can make it myself. Enjoy!

I thought this was an OK casual dinner, but not as special as the other reviews suggested. By the way, if you use half sweet Italian sausages (I did), it comes out pretty mild. I wouldn't shy away from the hot sausages unless you're very sensitive.

One of my favorite pasta recipes. I have made with hot Italian sausage and have added a cup of frozen peas along with the tomatoes. I love it.

This was fabulous and so easy. After reading the reviews, I made the following additions...minced garlic, 1/2 hot and 1/2 sweet sausage, fresh mushrooms as well as wild mushrooms, Added fresh basil from my garden at the end. My boyfriend tasted the sauce and said, Wow, this is AW! New term for me...translation, award winning. We served it to true blooded Italians and they also pronounced it a winner. This will be a regular for us. Try it, you won't be disappointed. BTW, this recipe served 4 people. No sauce left over.

Pretty good. We like the recipe on this site for sausage cream sauce with pasta, this is a more healthy alternative with just as much flavor. This only thing we may try next time is to roast the peppers before hand, peel & seed, then add in towards the very end.

Excellent recipe. I have made this several times to wonderful results. I do add garlic, about 1/2 cup wine and oregano. Last time I even added some eggplant chopped up with the onion. It always turns out fabulous. I highly recommend this recipe

Big hit, everyone wanted the recipe. Did not have mozzarella cheese and sub'd it with shredded monterey jack. Also did half the call for diced tomatoes! Will certainly make again.

3 1/2 forks. I've been making this since it was first published. The only change I make is to add the marjoram before simmering instead of after. It's terrifically good and freezes well.

Outstanding, easy tomato sauce recipe..This will be a keeper. I advise doubling it and freezing extra. I did add a few TBLS cream at the end to make it a bit richer...otherwise perfect for a cold winter's night!

Very good. I had to use breakfast sausage, but I spiced it up a little. I also only had a can of chopped tomatoes and a can of tomato sause, but it worked just fine. It was great!

I've been making this recipe since it was first published, and it's great! One of the best foundation recipes I've ever found. I never make it exactly the same way twice.

Good basic recipe that you can take in alot of different directions. I add mushrooms, a little bit of tomato paste and balsamic for sweetness and finished it with parmigiana and italian parsley.

This is a wonderfull recipe as is, or slightly modified. This time I added two small cloves of minced garlic, and 2-3 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream. I also only removed 2/3 of the sausage from it's casing and cut the rest into 2" pieces for a little more hardiness. Perfect for a freezing cold night with a snow storm approaching! Everyone loved it!

I have made this several times, and it is always a hit. While I was looking over the ingredients to prepare this for tonight's dinner, I noticed that in the list of ingredients, it lists 2 Teaspoons of Marjoram, but the directions say stir in 2 Tablespoons of Marjoram. I have always used 2 Teaspoons of Marjoram, and it has been great. I also add a garlic clove with the sausage and drained the sausage as well. This is a great cold weather dish paired with a salad and a nice bottle of red wine.

This has been a favorite since it was first published. We find the marjoram flavor to be better if added at the beginning of the simmer. Be sure to drain the fat from the sausage. Wonderful!

This is a great receipe, and got rave reviews from people used to authentic Italian cooking. After reading the reviews I added some thyme and a few Tbs of half-and-half. My others adds were to use half hot Italian sausage and half chorizo; and to add a small amount of dried porcini mushrooms (after soaking in water). If you're serving to people who don't like spicy food I'd be careful using both the hot sausage and the red pepper.

Hearty and easy to make, very delicious!!!

everyone loved it! I took other reviewers advice and used sherry instead of red wine, added 1 can of tomato paste, and sauted 3 garlic cloves (minced) with the onions

my family enjoyed this dish,although I would suggest that you drain the grease after you brown the sausage.

You can really play around with this recipe and get great results! Here's my favorite variation. I buy hot italian turkey sausage, squeeze it out of its casing, sautee and remove from pan once cooked through. Set aside. I then take about 3 or so peppers - I usually use red and orange or yellow and do a thin julienne. I do the same with an onion. I saute all of this in a little olive oil (in the sausage pan) along with a few chopped cloves of garlic. I then add a can of tomatoes (whatever form - chopped, stewed, etc.) and I like to add a can of tomatoe paste for a thicker sauce. I then add about a 1/2 cup of good red wine and some basil and oregano. I stir and simmer a bit and then add the cooked sausage back in. I simmer the whole concoction for about 15 min. or so, tasting and adding more wine, spices, etc. I serve it on bed of penne with a whole lot of freshly grated parmesan. So delicious and really easy!

This dish is awesome! I substituted the penne for mostaccioli regati and the dry red wine with sherry! The only thing I would do different is double the recipe!

Used tomato, garlic and basil sausage from Grand Central Market, skipped the onion (I didn't have one) and substituted home-made-not-quite-perfect tomato sauce for the tomatoes. Also used dry sherry instead of the wine. The result: ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS. I highly recommend this recipe... if only for how forgiving it is!

I have just finished making his dish, I was searching for a quick recipe with ingredients I had on hand. This is a fabulous and EASY dish, a nice spin on the usual spaghetti bolognese. I took the advice of adding feta...good one! Definitely will make again.

This recipe was fantasic! Very easy to make and a real hit in my house! The red pepper flakes really make the dish. And it was great having extra sauce to use the second time around. I'll definitely make this again.

I added a few spices. More red pepper flakes, Cayenne and a little Thyme. Also some whipping cream. My family loved it! My step-son, who had just ate before coming over, decided it smelled so good he had to try it and ended up having 2 servings! It was definitely a favorite!

Pretty good for a very easy dish! Beware the marjoram typo in the instructions (2 teaspoons NOT 2 tablespoons), but it was good even with the extra flavor.

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe that can be adapted to suit different tastes and different ingrediants that you have on hand. For example, I used several smaller cans of diced tomatoes with jalapenos instead of the large can of crushed tomatoes. I then added a bit of feta to add a little creaminess and extra flavor to the sauce (and also to cut the added heat from the jalapenos!) I also agree that this makes many more servings than two. I will definitely make this again!

I've seen another version of this dish with heavy cream added to the sauce. I did this and it was delicious. It is very spicy, next time I may use half regular sausage. I plan to make this again soon.

Very tasty and quick. I also make it with spicy turkey sausage, and it is just as good.

I added parsley and sweet basil to this delicious sauce and definitely would make it again!

This dish was easy and delicious! A nice change from a basic meat sauce, there is plenty of kick to it. If your tastes run towards a milder fare, try using half sweet/half hot sausage.
