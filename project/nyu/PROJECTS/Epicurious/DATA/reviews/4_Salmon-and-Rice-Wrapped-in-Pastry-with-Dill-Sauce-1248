Yum! I have made this several times, along with the beets in orange sauce from the same menu. Very filling; great presentation if for company.

Delicious! I oven poached a 2 lb salmon side with lemon and dill in foil. When done, I separated the salmon from the skin and mixed the fish with 1/2 wild rice and 1/2 brown basmati, the leeks, salt/pepper and more fresh dill until well combined. I then mounded the entire mixture over one of the rolled puff pastry squares, then covered it with the other (as specified in the recipe). I brushed on the egg wash then popped it in a 300 degree oven for 25 minutes (or until the puff pastry was lightly browned). Served with the sauce. It was a HUGE hit, even with the kids.

I love this recipe! It has all the elements for a delicious and elegant presentation which can be prepped ahead and baked once your company comes. I've gotten rave reviews with this one. The dill sauce is a must. I do agree with a previous review that the rice/leek mixture could use a little "spicing" up. Otherwise, terrific as written.

I made this for Vigil dinner (Christmas Eve, meatless in my Polish family) and it was a hit. I ended up having to omit the leeks (onion allergy in my family) and the rice (Vigil dinner is awash in carbs as it is) so I just tripled the mushrooms. I was worried it would be boring but, together with the sauce, it was divine. People couldn't stop talking about it. It's probably even better with the leeks. I did decrease the fish size to 4oz because Vigil dinner is already 12 courses, but think the 6oz size would be fine for a normal main course. I thought the dill sauce sounded bizarre (boiled whipping cream??) but it was wonderful and complemented the salmon perfectly. I also used only 2/3 of the puff pastry I expected (two sheets for ten 4oz packets). I must have rolled thinner than directed, but it turned out great. It also took me much less time than anticipated - I set aside an entire evening and it only took me about 2 hours to prep. I prepped about 18 hours in advance and had no problems. I think this would be a great Valentine's dinner - so romantic (and so easy).

I have made this several times for company and TOTALLY enjoyeds. Only minor change is I used 4 oz of salmon and perhaps a little less rice. Served with roasted beets. Any suggestions on a good green to serve with? I served a mixed salad. One could also do a beet salad with Feta I would guess...

I really enjoyed this dish. Don't be afraid to make it - it is a lot of work but not so difficult or time consuming. One complaint, I found the rice mixture a little bland. I think next time I'll cook the rice in chicken broth and add some garlic.

Took the advice of other reviewers and mixed sour cream with whipping cream, thickened with flour, and added some lemon to the sauce (zest and juice). Delish! I rolled the pastry pretty thinly and it was just right, not too doughy. Will make again.

This looks so impressive when it is served up and yet it's so easy (if time-consuming) to prepare. Following other reviews I cut the amounts by about a third but I think as part of a three-course dinner with veg side dishes, etc. you could easily halve it. Ran out of time to make the sauce so just whisked the dill and some lemon juice into the creme fraiche, which people really liked, but I'd like to try the sauce next time as it sounds very rich and moreish.

This is such an easy and impressive dish. I did make one major change: I left out the rice. Aside from the fact that I don't like rice, I honestly can't imagine putting it inside puff pastry. I don't think this dish needs it at all. It was absolutely delicious with just the salmon, mushrooms and leeks. I served it with roasted parmesan rosemary potatoes and those more than made up for the missing starch. I'll definitely make this one again.

I had made inidividual packets the first time I made the recipe. Since many people left part of it,this time I decided to make a side of salmon and let people cut what they wanted (many people came back for seconds). It worked much better. I cooked the salmon for only 20 minutes and it was perfect. I think the next time I make it, I would cook the rice less than the time stated in the rice recipe so that it is more moist, as it dries out more when it is baked. Everyne was very impressed with the recipe. The nice part for me was that I could do everything in advance and just pop the salmon in the oven when my guests came.

I made this recipe for my dad's bday. He was very impressed. It was a lot easier than I expected. Probably took me an hour to get it all together. I used 1/4 cup sour cream + 1 cup whipping cream as suggested.. Added some flour to thicken quickly. Definitely a keeper, very rich, but impressive. Can't wait to experiment. Added the capers too.. really delish! I have to agree portion was big, but I did not add any sides.. don't think it was necessary.

I made this over the weekend and everyone raved about it! Changes I made: only 4oz of salmon per person (and this was more than enough), 1/4 cup sour cream + 1 cup whipping cream according to one of the reviewers because I couldn't find creme fraiche, dried shiitake mushrooms that I reconstitued in hot water for about 15 minutes, rice cooked in chicken broth for added flavor. The sauce was fantastic! The clam juice sounded odd in the recipe but it's a key ingredient. I had doubled the sauce after reading the reviews and served the leftovers with crab cakes the next day. The sauce definitely took a lot longer to reduce. I reduced the clam juice + wine for 10 minutes and then reduced it for about 20 minutes after adding the sour cream + whipping cream. I did roll out the dough a little flatter as suggested by reviewers but I'll use a bit less dough next time because there were still some parts of the pastry that weren't as light & crispy as I would have liked. Definitely reduce the baking time if you are reducing the size of the fish. I forgot and cooked it the full 30 minutes, resulting in a slightly overcooked salmon. Thank God for that sauce! I'm a slow cook so it took me about 1.5 hours to make this dish. This is definitely going into regular rotation.

I have made this several times (once for a chef) and had rave reviews. I have also frozen them. They cook best if thawed prior to cooking. When rushed, I have wrapped entire salmon filet in one big sheet of puff pastry and sliced individual portions after cooking. I find the sauce needs some lemon, but that is personal choice. (I use milk, not cream and thicken with corn starch) If you can't find clam juice, clam nectar works as well.

glad I read the reviews first and remembered to get heavy cream AND buttermilk! that combination worked perfectly. actually, the whole dish worked perfectly. we have a lot of leftovers (each little package is awfully darn big!) but it wasn't hard at all to prepare since so much of it can be done in little steps throughout the day, and you get SUCH an impressive result. this will definitely be my next dinner party dish.

This was magnificent. I prepared this menu for my boyfriend's birthday this year to a party of eight, and it was a huge success. I followed the recipe as indicated, other than 'jazzing up' the rice/leek/mushroom mixture with some toasted pine nuts, chevre, and roasted garlic. I used the menu suggestion, and started the meal with caviar and homemade blini with homemade citrus vodka, and continued the Russo- European theme with a Hungarian cucumber salad and shooters of golden tomato bisque. Followed this up with a birthday cake of Buttermilk cream cake with sherried berries and whipped marscapone filling.... Wonderful. Just wonderful. It's been nearly a year later, and he's STILL talking about it. Just FYI - you're going to need a 'sous chef' for this one. My cousin helped me out, and she and I STILL spent five hours in the kitchen.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did not have mushrooms or creme fraiche and it still came out very nice. I followed the advice of another reviewer who did not have the creme for the dill sauce- boiled heavy cream for 15 min. and then added a bit of cornstarch and water. This seemed to work fine, but I had to mix it for awhile to get it smooth. I also made smaller servings of this recipe since everyone said the portions were huge and was glad- we had plenty of leftovers for the next day! I would make this again as an appetizer for a party- I would make bite size versions.

This recipe is fabulous- I have made it following the original recipe and added a few personal touches. A few teaspoonfuls of rinsed capers in the rice mixture adds a great lttle kick and I have made this with a whole salmon filet for parties and it has been just as successful. Great party food!

This is an excellent version of kulebiaka. The best I have ever had. I served it at a dinner party and everybody absolutely loved it!

I also reduced it much longer to get it thick.

BUTTERMILK?! Wish I would have read the recipe before I went to the store the first time. Bought whipping cream instead of creme fraiche. When I got home and read the instructions for the sauce, I about had a cow. Decided against the buttermilk, was scared to try adding flour or corn starch, didn't have yogurt, so I headed back to the store for some sour cream. Despite this, the sauce was a wonderful compliment to the salmon/rice pastry. Will make it again!

I made this recipe three times in the last month to rave reviews. I made a few changes: crimini mushrooms instead of Shiitake, 4 ounces of salmon instead of 6, added a cup of frozen peas, brown rice instead of white, and used a different dill sauce, this was too runny. I also cooked the pastries for 25 minutes instead of 30 because I reduced the weight of the salmon.

I made this dish for 11 people last evening and everyone loved it. The sauce was gone and was essential to the dish, although I thought it was a bit runny.

Served asparagus with snap peas on the side. Perfect serving is 4 ounces. Serve a light dessert afterwards.

Absolutely delicious and showy! I made pastry cutouts and decorated the tops. I used organic brown rice/wild rice mixture and followed the recipe almost exactly, served sauteed asparagus/red pepper strips, a green salad w/roasted almonds and orange sections, and fresh blueberry dessert. I made double the sauce and not a drop left - used half light cream and half yogurt-the clam juice is a "must". 4 oz wild Pacific salmon fillets made a perfect serving. Will make again without a doubt.

This was a great recipe and very easy! I even re-heated it for my parents the next day and Mom asked for the recipe!

If you like being the center of attention, and being pestered for recipes- then make this dish! It is so unbelievably easy to throw together a day BEFORE a dinner party, and just makes you look like a student of Le Cordon Bleu! For the sauce, I didn't use the clam juice- instead I added a dash of fish sauce which I have on hand because I do alot of Thai cooking. This recipe was so impressive and delicious, guests were joking that they wish they were bulimic so they could finish their portion! And I got a rather dirty look from one of the wives when her husband ranted and raved that it was one of the best fish dishes he's ever eaten, LOL. Outstanding! 5 forks!!!

I made a few changes to this recipe and found it deelish. I sauteed courgette in butter, garlic and thyme until almost overdone (tip from a friend of mine who is a head chef) along with shiitake mushrooms. Topped the salmon and rice with them. I don't think I've ever seen bottled clam juice in England, so instead I used the sauce from the "salmon in saffron muscle sauce" recipe also on this site, but omitted the muscles. I added about 1/8 tsp saffron threads to it. Wonderful. A fun dish to get creative with.

My brotherinlaw said that they weren't good enough to be served such a fabulous meal! I keep getting asked to make it again.

I made this with the whipping cream creme frache substitute, and dried shitake musrooms instead of fresh. It is a lot of food, half of one pastry basket is enough for one person. I also cut the amount of mushrooms to a third. It is nessisary to cut the proportions per each pastry. But it is easy to make, and nice that you can prepare most of it in advanced.

I skipped the sauce and served it with chimmichurri which has garlic and cilantro. Or you could serve a fresh mango salsa. I think acid in the sauce perks up the dish. I also spread a little chimmi over the salmon before enclosing them in the pastry.

I made this for a baby shower and it was awesome. Instead of mushrooms, I mixed roasted orange pepper, sauteed leek and celery with jasmine rice. Placed 1/3 cup on the puff pastry and wrapped. I would use a smaller portion of salmon for this kind of party but for a main course definately use the larger. Instead of creme fraiche, I used sour cream and it was delicious. It was a great make ahead, even the sauce. Made the day before and cooked and heated during the party. HUGE success.

I've tried other salmon-in-pastry recipes and this one is the keeper! Delicious, impressive and easy - a great do-ahead dish for a dinner party. And 4 oz. of salmon per portion is plenty! In the rice mixture, I used fresh shitake and oyster mushrooms, plus a few dried shitakes (soaked and squeezed dry) and some capers to give it more kick. For the sauce, I used a little cornstarch to speed the thickening process and it did the trick nicely. With steamed asparagus, a very elegant entree!

Impressive and easy! I couldn't find clam juice for the sauce so I substituted with a vegetable stock and followed directions. It was divine.

This was an amazing dish- Ive never cooked gourmet before, and my guests thought I was a chef! They didnt believe me when I told them this was the first time I made it. I didnt find any creme fraiche, so I used whipping creme instead, however, it took a REALLY long time to thicken.

What an impressive dish! I agree with the other reviewers that the sauce, although extremely heavy and rich, could be doubled. Each salmon packet could easily feed two and should be served with a light salad or vegetables. No additional carbs are needed for this one! I seasoned the salmon with garlic salt and lemon pepper before wrapping in the pastry to add a little more flavor. Capers would also work well.

Outstanding alternative to grilled salmon for a summer dinner. I added horseradish to the salmon before spreading the filling over the salmon to add more flavor. I recommend doubling the receipe for the dill sauce as we were liking the bowl to get enough out for what the recipe called for. We ended up a with a bit of leftovers and can't wait to reheat it. Guests were impressed and seconds were essential. I would highly recommend this receipe

Wow. This is an extremely impressive dish. I made it for guests without test-driving it first, so I was a little nervous. Luckily it was very easy to put together, and it came out perfect and delicious. I agree that 6 oz salmon per person is too much -- 4 oz would be plenty. Also, I couldn't find creme fraiche so used 50/50 sour cream/plain yogurt instead. This dish is really unforgettable. It's a little on the heavy side, so I wanted to serve with something light -- sauteed spinach with raisins and pine nuts. Delicious.

Made this recipe for Valentine's Day and we really loved it - I omitted the mushrooms and accordingly, just added the rice to the leeks/butter to add some moisture. I also had to cook the creme fraiche longer than the recipe indicated to thicken it enough. Like other reviewers, I thought 4-5 oz pieces were large enough for most eaters. Served with steamed asparagus. Would definitely make this again. We even ate the leftovers cold for lunch the next day.

To the reviewer who thought this was bland: PLEASE add salt and pepper to everything! I notice that hundreds of epicurious recipes don't list salt in the ingredients. So you cannot follow exactly. All good cooks add salt at EVERY step! regardless of what salty ingredients are included.

Enjoyed this dish very much. The flavours were very pleasant, and I would never have guessed the only three seasonings were salt, pepper, and dill. Was rich, but not too heavy. Made each package with a 4 oz filet instead of 6 oz. Sealed it any way I could, so it ended up looking perhaps a little less elegant than had been originally intended. Served with plain steamed broccoli to help cut the richness a bit. Will definitely make again.

I was so excited to make the recipe after reading all the reviews. I diligently prepared the recipe following every step, however, I was very disappointed with the outcome. It is my opinion that the dish is very bland. Many reviewers thought the portion size was large, I agree am I am a big eater. I will use concepts from this recipe and possibly try a modification with chicken with variations with curried rice and curry sauce or a spicy cajin rice and sauce.

I have made this receipe over 10 times and still looking it up for those special occassions like Easter this year. This is a wonderful receipe can be changed to create your own version and can be made in a loaf instead of individual size helps to reduce the portion size which have been alot of complaints in the reviews I have read. You can even make it without the rice and make a ligher version of the Dill Sauce. This will make you look like a true chef to those who just can't cook. Feel free to e-mail me for any info.

I'm a newcomer to this one, but and agree it's delicious, but can't figure out the complaints about portions being huge. Six ounces fish is a bit more than the diet portion of 4 ounces; 1/2 cup raw rice cooked for 4 diners is less than I might make with a pilaf on the side. I suppose if you followed the menu and made the pancakes (but who would?) you might get doughed out, but we thought these were just right, with the beets on the side, since fish, rice and pastry were all that was required. Too much of a good thing? OK!

Wonderful! I came off looking like a gourmet chef with this recipe. I've always been intimidated by puff pastry but gave it a whirl - I don't no what I was afraid of it was easy to handle. I dropped the fish serving down to 4 oz and that was still a bit large. I used PLAIN white rice and it wasn't plain at all with the leeks and mushrooms. Creme Fraiche wasn't available so I used 50/05 sour cream and yogurt and it was fine. This is a terrific recipe and was well received.

WOW! This turned out GREAT! I changed only a couple of things here. I changed the plain rice into a seasoned rice with sauteed onions, leeks & mushrooms, garlic, a bit of chili powder & Aromat (Knorr), and sprinkled a bit of fresh lime juice right on the fish before wrapping it. Then for the sauce, I used sour cream & whipping cream or half-n-half instead of the creme fraiche, and I added a bit of garlic powder, white pepper & more Aromat. I served it with a Bavarian bread dumpling on the side and carrots amaretto. SOOOO GOOD!!!

The presentation of the individual "wellingtons" is fabulous. This dish was very tasty, but not outstanding. The big mistake I made was using wild rice--the strong taste obliterated the delicate flavors of everything else. Next time I will make a rice pilaf of sorts, with the addition of lemon. The dish needs a little citrus flavor to play off the rich flavors of the salmon and puff pastry.

Served this last night to special guests -- it was wonderful and I received many compliments. Very impressive and tasty. I prepared my whole dinner that morning. Once my guests arrived, I popped the salmon into the oven and warmed the vegetables-- easy. I served a mixed green salad, Gingered glazed carrots and buttered asparagus as an accompaniment. This recipe is very large so warn your guests to come hungry. The dill sauce is also very tasty -- I used sour cream/ heavy cream mixture and it turned out well. I am planning a large gathering in the next month or so and plan to wrap a whole salmon and serve in slices. The rice was very tasty also but next time I will try using chicken broth for the liquid for additional flavor. Thumbs up on this one!!

This recipe was easy and so delicious!! I cooked the rice in low salt chicken broth and liked the outcome. This would also be delicious with wild rice. The portions don't look huge when you are assembling it, but they are huge. My guests wouldn't leave my house without the recipe.

I just made this dish AGAIN last night as a friend requested it for her birthday gift. Easiest gift I've ever made. This is a great party entree as you can make the fish packets and the sauce ahead. Just pop the fish in the oven and reheat the sauce and you are on your way. I have substituted wild rice for regular rice and I also have substituted scallions for the leeks, both work fine. I will make this again and again for years.

Although an accomplished cook, my lack of digital dexterity and patience has always kept me from baking, including puff pastry. Not anymore! This is the perfect entertaining recipe. I used white rice, lots of leeks, and cremini mushrooms. Rolled the salmon up like a burrito. Made the sauce ahead, using sour cream and yoghurt. It separated when it cooled, so I simply poured off some of the watery liquid, and it thickened beautifully upon reheating. Guests loved it! I've never seen cleaner plates so fast. I tossed a few asparagus spears and quartered carrots with oil then onto the baking tray to roast with the salmon and be served alongside. Followed with and endive salad with roquefort, walnuts and red grapes. Easy and delicious.

I have made this dish a few times now and it is awesome! The portions are huge so the last time I made it I doubled the recipe but made each packet half the size for 12 people (everyone wanted to take the leftovers home!). Wild rice is very good, and the sauce can be made with sour cream. Some of the people keep kosher so i made a mustard dill sauce as well because I don't know of a substitute for clam juice, any ideas?

I made this dish for an elegant, sit-down dinner for 12. It was perfect. I had other obligations all day and only had 1 hour advance preparation time. Since this recipe can be made in advance (I prepped it 1 day ahead), all I had to do was pull it out of the fridge and into the oven. The presentation was impressive and it was delicious. This will be a standard for me. I served w/ pureed gingered carrots (except I used sweet potatoes) and steamed zucchini and squash.

I made this for my mom who was visting. She could not stop talking about it. Very easy recipe and elegant. I will definitely make this again for a dinner party. Although, my husband and I are not big fans of dill, this works well with the saffrom cream sauce I made. Beautiful presentation too.

We made this recipe for a school competition and won, but we had to roll out the pastry thinner than the recipe recommended.

This is a keeper!! Just returning from Alaska with my very fresh catch this was a huge winner. My wife is demanding I make it again & sooner rather than later. This is a sure fire dinner winner.

I have made this dish several times for formal dinner parties and haven't been disappointed yet. It's an elegant main course. Portions are very large so I have opted to make smaller pastry wraps; guests love taking them home. They are good cold or slowly reheated. Have served gingered carrots from this website with the salmon wraps; adds color to the plate. I've made the packages early in the day for a late evening party - more time to enjoy your guests. Great with champagne. Will soon have to find a new gourmet entree as I have made this for just about all of our friends; WILL BE HARD TO BEAT.

The salmon "packages" were much easier to put together than I thought and baked up perfect. I was worried the pastry seams wouldn't hold but they did and it looked great and tasted delicious. I rolled the puff pastry a bit thinner than the recipe suggested and it wasn't heavy at all, but crisp and delicate. The only thing we didn't care for was the dill sauce ... it was thin and milky rather than creamy and had a strange, rather unpleasant taste. I'll definitely be making the salmon & rice in pastry again, but will make a hollandaise sauce for it next time instead.

Any substitute for clam juice, since it's not Kosher?

Definitely a keeper! The rice mixture was a good texture complement to the salmon and the dill sauce was the perfect topper. I can see using the base recipe for lots of other flavor combinations. Served with the aparagus and wild mushroom fricasse also from this website for a special brunch; all of my guests were happily full(filled)!

Absolutely fabulous!The dill sauce makes this dish. I think it wouyld be great over anything!Next time I think I will use the phyllo pastry it lends a more buttery and delicate flavor to the dish. Instead of using salmon, I used a chunk crab meat and scallions for a bit of a variation.

This is a great recipe! Elegant presentation. I also thought the serving size was a bit large. I'm making it for my mom's mother's day dinner for eight and will probably halve the portion size. I used whipping cream and cooked it down, and also added some dijon mustard, which I thought was better than the original recipe.

This was sooo good! It took a little more time, but was WELL worth it! I then delivered the leftovers to my parents who also gave it a rave review.

An unbelievably stunning dish! I served it at a big dinner party, and the guests were awed. The pastry turns a lovely golden color, and when you cut into it, the steam and aroma hit you with delightful force. My one problem was that it was an awfully large serving size. I might give each person half of what the recipe recommends next time I make it.

I made this and used wild rice instead of the boring white, it was really good. In the future I will trim the pastry so that it JUST covers the salmon, the dill sauce really made the dish. I served this with roasted asparagus salad, and it was a very nice combination.

This recipe is easy, elegant and forgiving! When both stores I stopped at on my way home from work to make Valentine's Day dinner were out of puff pastry sheets, I improvised with Phyllo dough (5 sheets, each brushed with melted butter) - I folded the packets "burrito style" and they came out cripsy and lightly buttery. I even left them in too long and the salmon stayed moist and delicous - the flavors blend marveously. When I make it again, I think I'll stick with the lighter Phyllo dough!

SOOOOOO Good! Used as per Valentine menu with much success. However, when I prepare it again, I will decrease the portion sizes as they are HUGE...much more than we could eat...sauce great and would make more.

I made this dish yesterday for a romantic date, and he thought I was a genius! Although it's a little labor intensive, this entree is well worth the trouble. Plus, it can be made early in the day and chilled. The rice part of the dish would be good on its own as a side dish. Absolutely yummy.

WOW!!!! Now I know why the reviews were so favorable. This dish was not only easy to prepare and tasted wonderful, but the presentation was so pretty. I followed another reviewer and made this with a whole salmon filet and used wild rice. Served caviar first with vodka, and champagne with the entree, My new favorite elegant meal.

Rating: 4
This was a real hit at our Christmas buffet dinner! I took the suggestion from a previous review and wrapped a whole salmon filet in the whole puff pastry and allowed the guests to cut it crosswise, and it made for a beautiful presentation. I also used cookie cutters to stencil designs (without cutting the dough out) in the top of the pastry, and it added to the presentation. This dish is fairly easy to prepare and assemble, and therefore is a real "keeper".

Delicious recipe for a short-cut Koulibiaca. Next time I'll make it without the puff pastry and make aluminum foil pouches. I made the sauce with 50:50 sour cream and drained plain yogurt in place of the creme fraiche. It was a big hit.

Rating: 4
Awesome! By far, one of the best dinner recipes I've gotten off this website! Looked so elegant, but was fairly easy to make. My mother accidentally threw away my homemade creme fraiche because she thought it was spoiled milk, so I had to improvise the sauce using just whipping cream. I boiled for about 15-20 minutes to thicken, then added a tablespoon of cornstarch/water mixture, and I think the end result was much better than if I had used the creme fraiche. It didn't have the slightly tangy flavor the creme fraiche would have given it. The dill sauce was just delicious, and the flavors paired so well with the salmon pastries. I served with the asparagus with parmesan butter and chocolate-cognac profiteroles with raspberry sauce for dessert, both recipes found on this website. My dinner guests raved at how elegant the meal was. Will definitely do this again!!!

I doubled the recipe to accomodate a party of 8 and it was a huge sussess. I would not change a thing. A simple dish of asparagus was the perfect compliment. I finished off the meal with a simple lemon curd tart. I had 1/2 of a salmon pastry left over which was very good the following day cold. A keeper...

Very good and suprisingly easy - can be a little dry without the sauce - a nice change from the usual salmon preparations.

I cheated a little and made the salmon in aluminum foil, filling pastry shells afterward. Warning - if you don't have creme fraiche, you need to make it with whipped cream. This takes a while. You can also substitute sour cream, like I did after discovering the whipped cream snafu, and it's lovely.

I made this recipe for Mothers Day with the following changes. I wrapped the entire salmon fillet in the pastry, cut out some hearts and "Mom" to place on the top. Not only was it beautiful, but everyone raved about it all day. I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is not difficult to make and results in an elegant dish. As a previous reviewer had suggested, I substituted wild rice for white and found the rice/leek/mushroom mixture to be a superb combination. However, I found the pastry a bit heavy. Next time, I will serve the salmon drizzled in the exquisite dill sauce along side the rice. I don't think anything will be lost except a few extra calories.

My wife loved this so much the first time I made it 4 years ago she has been after me to make it again which I'm going to do for my in-laws for Mother's Day. Elegant, fairly easy, and absolutely delicious.

Delicious! The dish looked very elegant. For those that do not cook well, this recipe is fool proof. If you're considering having salad, a side vegetable, and appetizers...I would buy slightly smaller portions (about 5oz.). This reheats very well in the oven. It would be perfect to make for Mother's Day.

This is a great recipe for entertaining because it is all preassembled and then baked while you are mixing with your guests. I made it with two huge fillets of salmon (I started with a whole fish)then wrapped the sheets of puff pastry around the fish and the rice, baked it, sliced it and served it to my fourteen guests. It presented beautifully.

Salmon is not my favourite but this recipe was divine. Removing the skin from the salmon makes such a difference. I followed everything to a tee except for the dill sauce. I created a lower fat version that was excellent by using low fat chicken stock in place of clam juice and 5% cream in place of creme fraiche. This is on my list of favourite recipes for company.

Made this last night for our family. Absolutely wonderful. The servings were HUGE!!! I'm contemplating next time making it as one whole pastry wrap and perhaps shaping it like a fish! Sauce was perfect. I made roasted Asparagus and a salad along with it. Not difficult to assemble.

Super tasty, friends nicknamed it salmon wellington. Used wild instead of white rice with great results. Portions seemed large but were gobbled wholeheartedly by guests. Total success, and I'm no pro...

Absolutely Fabulous!!! I did add a Tbsp of cornstarch to a little water and mixed, then i added it to the dill sauce; it thickened it up beautifully and did not compromise the flavour. I also put little slashes in the top of the pastry to release the steam. Removing the salmon skin is a must!

It was very good. Everyone who tried it wants me to make it again. Was slightly worried with the assembly, but it was quite easy and turned out great.

Wonderful!! Although the recipe doesn't state it, REMOVE THE SKIN before assembling. Also, cook longer to thicken the sauce. Champagne and a green salad (I served a Caesar) with this entree will fill-up your guests! End w/cheese and fruit.

Very yummy. I followed the recipe exactly except for the wrapping instructions. I wrapped the portions like a burrito and baked it seam side up - it looked nice and used less pastry. The sauce was excellent. This is a great dish to make ahead so you can enjoy your guests. I roasted some asparagus alongside the salmon which saved even more time and complimented the dish perfectly.

I prepared this dish for my Book Club. We all agreed that we should share our enthusiasm for these delicious bundles with all of your readers. I served the dish with a spinach souffle and a salad and would make the same meal again without hesitation. One problem that I encountered was that the creme fraiche did not thicken, so I made another batch with another recipe. Even with that, the finished sauce was thinner than I expected, but very tasty. Thank you for a wonderful replacement for the traditional coulibiac that I have made in the past.
