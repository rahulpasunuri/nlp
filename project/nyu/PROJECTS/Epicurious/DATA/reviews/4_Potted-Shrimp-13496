This tasted very good as I was making it, but after it was chilled it lost a lot of the shrimp taste, and to me just tasted greasy. My husband liked it, but at the gathering I took it to, I noticed that it pretty well went untouched after the first pass. I did take the previous suggestions about cutting down on the butter, but was not pleased with the greasiness of it.

I've made this three times now, and it's always a hit. I cut back on the butter a bit, but otherwise follow the recipe. You need to serve it on a bland cracker to enjoy the subtle flavors. Flavors are best when served at room temp. Great for a do-ahead appetizer, and I never have any left.

this is easy, delicious and always a hit. I use cognac instead of sherry which gives it a wonderful flavor. I also have used cooked shrimp and chopped it up and added to shallot mixture just to warm through and it still comes out great and saves a lot of time peeling shrimp

This a great cocktail snack. I used dry reisling instaed of sherry (since I didn't have any) and cut butter to 1/2 stick. Raves all around.

I forgot to mention that I doubled the recipe (hence the full stick of butter) + that I pulsed the cooked shrimp and shallots in the food processor which yielded the perfect texture.

I changed the recipe a bit this time and it was even better than past efforts - we couldn't stop eating it! I used sherry vinegar vs. sherry and cut butter down to one stick vs. 1 1/2 sticks.

Every Christmas Eve, I make a traditional Italian seafood meal, which changes every year, depending upon what new recipes I've found over the year. I never miss this one, though, it isa family favorite and I usually get requests for the recipe from several in our extended family

This is a delicious spread. The combination of flavours is excellent. I was unable to find fresh uncooked shrimp that were small enough, so I used fresh cooked shrimp and added them at the end of the sherry reduction. I will definitely make this again and again and again!

I, too, have been making this recipe for years to rave reviews. In fact, if I arrive at a party without it my husband's nephews won't talk to me!

I make this recipe all the time and everybody raves about it. I spread it on lavash bread, rolled up then cut into slices for Easter Brunch. It worked out GREAT-I let the rolls set up for an hour b/f I cut into them. I had to promise several people that I would get the recipe to them. I usually cut back on the butter and use a whole 8 oz package of cream cheese. This one is a pleaser - everyone demands I make this now!!

Very good - easier to use frozen uncooked shrimp. Would make again if I wanted fattening spread (butter). Everyone liked.

Ummmmm...... I have a question. If you don't cut the shallots firmly will it still be as good? Just kidding, this recipe was very good, it needed a little kick- try some tobasco or chipotle...

Excellent! Very easy to make. I received a lot of compliments on this dish - everyone wanted the recipe.

This is a popular appetizer that we end up making a lot. Prepackaged frozen salad shrimp work just as well as standard shrimp and are much cheaper/easier. Be sure to add later in the process as they are pre-cooked.

I reduced the sherry with the shallot mixture and then added roughly chopped precooked bay shrimp. I really like sherry and added a bit more. I also cut back the butter and increased the cream cheese because all the butter just seemed too rich. I stuffed some celery with it and garnished with chopped chives and served the rest with crackers. It was a big hit and very fast to make, and I'd definitely make it again.

I've made this twice now, though I must confess I've yet to use shrimps! First time I used prawns because the fishmonger had no shrimps, and the second time I used smoked salmon. I like to press the mixture into little individual ramekins. These look very attractive on a plate with a garnish of watercress and four or five oatcakes.

Super! I thought that the liquid would never boil down, but it did and I just stuck the whole hot shrimp mess into the food processor (my shrimp were small and I didn't want to mess with separating them). One could taste the sherry, so I would advise anyone who doesn't care for that taste to avoid it. The chives are un-noticeable, but make the dish look pretty (pink base and green specks). Overall very good and easy. I will make it again.

I made this dip for a backyard party - delicious -everyone loved it, and I was asked may times over for the recipe. It went so fast that many guests could only guess how good it was! Very easy to put together - I will be making this again!

Very rich and my guests enjoyed! Let sit out of fridge at least 15 to 20 minutes before serving as consistency is too hard. Served with homemade pita triangles.

This is very good, just not particularly unique.

I made this for an office potluck and it was a huge hit. Very easy to make.

Guests fought over this at a dinner party, and then begged for the recipe. I'd say it was a hit. As for me, if it weren't so fattening, I'd eat the whole thing for dinner.

The guests loved the appetizer and began saying I needed to go into the catering business!
