This really is a good recipe, and very easy. I omitted the water as many suggested and I coated the scallops with ground hazel nuts, which I thought added interesting texture. I will make this again for sure!

Dish is amazing! One of my favorites and so easy. We've also found numerous uses for the mustard sauce as well. Try it next time you make chicken cordon bleu.

Great! Made a few changes. Lightly floured scallops before cooking. Two large shallots . 1 lb. scallops. 1/2 cup wine. 1-1/2 TBL mustard. 1/4 cup snipped chives added before adding butter. Served over quinoa linguine. added pasta water to dish mixed together and served

Tasty and easy-left out the water as others suggested-cooked the scallops longer than suggested.

This a keeper and perfect for the two of us. Did not use the butter and it was perfect. Served green beans a mock risotto using orzo, which I used butter-flavor Pam and chicken broth. Added sauted mushrooms and a Tbl of parseam at the end.

The sauce was perfect for the scallops. Served them with an orzo pilaf. Very good.

We grilled the scallops and made the sauce in a sauce pan. It was very good! We grilled some asparagus along side.

Was going through my recipe box for Thanksgiving and came across this recipe. I have been making this since the recipe first came out and it is so EASY and delicious with ingredients you always have on hand.

Sauce was excellent. I did as others suggested and did not add water and also left out the butter since I don't eat dairy. Used a grain mustard, which added nice color and served over steamed spinach and quinoa. Easy too, so will definitely be making again.

easy, elegant and fast. my new favorite scallops recipe.

Delicious and easy--made this on a weeknight and loved it. Will definitely make again. One of the greatest challenges with recipes like this is keeping the scallops warm without overcooking them while the sauce is made. I preheated the oven to 175 and heated a tin plate while sauteeing the scallops. Placed scallops on this plate when they finished cooking and securely wrapped plate in foil--kept on the stove (NOT in the oven!) while I made the sauce. This worked like a charm! Made 1 1/2 sauce recipe for 1 pound of fresh wild Canadian scallops. Next time may double it. Didn't need added water (they were large scallops), and I used only about half of the butter which gave the sauce a creamy texture/nouthfeel without being overly heavy and rich. Served with wild rice, broccoli, and asparagus. Yum!

One of our favorites. Particularly with big Chilean Sea Scallops

I was cooking for five big eaters so used two pounds of scallops, doubled the sauce ( only three tablespoons of mustard instead of four), and served it with white rice for the sauce. Delicious!

Fantastic, made it for V-Day and hub said we couldn't of had a better meal out. The sauce is salty so watch any extra salt.

Rating: 3
Excellent recipe. Very easy and quick to make. I brought the scallops to a picnic and they're very nice when they're just warm or even a little cooled--they held up well with the sauce. I was skeptical about adding the butter but felt in the end it was worth it, despite the calories--it gave the sauce a velvety finish.

My husband brought home 3/4 lb.of scallops, and we had all of the other ingredients on hand. It was simple, delicious and beautiful on the white plate with sauteed baby squash and glazed carrots. An Alsatian pinot blanc was an excellent accompaniment.

Rating: 3
Delicious and simple -- a great hit with the guests (one of whom isn't even a big fan of scallops)! Have some good crusty bread on hand to mop up the yummy sauce. I used chicken broth instead of water as suggested, and did not need the butter to finish the sauce (which cuts down on the fat content nicely). Next time I will serve it on a bed of steamed spinach with a side of basmati or jasmine rice, and I also thought a hint of tarragon might be a nice touch as well (but then again, I love tarragon!).

I have made this for my family and guests countless times. It is always a hit and so easy. I often use less butter and add a little blackening when sauteing the scallops - adds just the right amount of extra punch to the flavor.

This was fast, easy and delicious...how can you go wrong?

I had to improvise: no shallots but had garlic; used salted instead of unsalted butter; and I cooked the scallops a bit longer then I should have......still tasted great inspite of my lack of attention and ingredients!

This is a quick, very easy, and delicious way to serve scallops. I use a grill pan to cook the scallops. Then, I wilt some baby spinach to toss with some linquine, top with the scallops, and drizzle on the sauce. Next time I make it I'm going to try the Caraway Rice Cakes.

This is an excellant recipe and we served it over greens that were excited to have the sauce poured through the scallops onto to them. We will make this again and again and again.

DELECTABLE!!! Right there at the top of my list of scallop receipes. I would actually give this at least 5 fork rating.

This recipe is excellent! It is one of my favorites on the site. I had "plump" scallops, too, so I followed the earlier suggestion of reducing the amount of water. I have done it without the green onions before and also added fresh dill once. It always turns out great! A definite keeper.

I use this recipe ALL the time for scallops when I'm cooking them indoors. It's fine even without the shallots and green onions - plus it's extremely easy.

One word...awesome!

I LOVE this recipe. It's perfect for either a "chick" meal with a girlfriend or that romantic dinner for two. A cool salad makes a great accompaniment -- I don't bother with the rice cakes. (To the cook from Stamford: Are we married to the same man?)

Rating: 3
AWESOME dish. I substituted the water with low-sodium/fat chicken broth which made the dijon mustard taste more subtle. And instead of garnishing with green onions, I used a pinch of crumbled Tarragon for color. On the rice cakes - white rice is so boring. I used a mix (2:1) aromatic brown rice:red rice (which I found at Trader joe's and happen to have in the pantry). Much more flavorful and nuttier. Added a beaten egg white to bind and sprinkled with Molly McButter. Turned once under the broiler. With fresh asparagus, this is a true keeper and low-cal at that.

This is an outstanding recipe. We served it with white rice and fresh asparagus, and will serve it again for company. I have no additions or deletions to suggest.

This has become one of our favorite recipes. I make it whenever I find scallops at a reasonable price.

Given the title of the recipe, I guess I shouldn't complain about it being too mustardy, but the sauce struck me as one-dimensional and a little too harsh for the delicate flavor of scallops. The raw scallions were just another harsh flavor on top. Hubby liked it, but he usually thinks any food can be improved with a dollop of mustard and a handful of scallions (i.e, a barbarian).

Rating: 3
The mustard sauce was delicious. I used large scallops and a mushroom rice pilaf. Awsome. I would definately use this for a dinner party. Especially good for guests who aren't in love with fish, but would eat it under the right circumstances.

Yummy! This is one of the best sauces I've used for seafood. I have used it twice with both scallops and shrimp. I think I will also try it on a piece of white fish at some point. I left out the shallots both times and added garlic instead, and it was excellent both times. The flavor is not at all overpowering like I expected it to be. I will make this a regular dish.

This was a truly outstanding dish! My husband and I loved every bite. I can see why some reviewers keep coming back to this scallops recipe- I know I will!

This has been one of my favorite dishes ever since it was on the cover in 1996. I've made it several times and never been disappointed. It's perfect for a light dinner, especially with an arugula salad and balsamic vinaigrette. I like the suggestion of using it as a first course.

For those who had difficulty cooking their scallops, it might be due to them being soaked with water (something supermarkets do to make them look nice and plump). I had "plump" bay scallops, and the recipe was still good. However, don't expect them to become golden when sauteed. And because of the excess water, I reduced the amount of water required in the recipe.

Rating: 2
I thought the cooking time for the scallops wasn't long enough, after 1-2 minutes on one side they weren't even browned and yet the oil was definitely hot enough, it was spattering all over. The sauce had a strangely bitter aftertaste...maybe the onion? Not sure I would make it again or if I did, I would cook the shallots a lot longer and the onion as well.

Excellent dish; my guests loved it. So important not to overcook scallops

This is a great easy recipe...we loved it!!! It also has ingredients that you always have on hand. We keep looking for a new recipe for scallops...but we always come back to this one.

I might suggest that you substitute cooking sherry for the dry white wine which will add back sweetness to the scallops. Never overcook scallops- they will get tough.

Rating: 3
The sauce was awesome, and this was a very pretty dish. I seem to have problems cooking scallops correctly so I think I will use bay scallops next time, especially since they are sweeter anyway. This would also be great with a mild white fish.

Rating: 3
Tasty and Well Presented. Sauce has a nice bite that cuts the richness of the scallops. I didn't have a shallot, so used the whites of the green onions. Red wine works as well or better than white. The quantity is fine for 2.

This is a delicious recipe. I added one clove of minced garlic to it for a little extra punch. Be sure not to overcook the scallops. They really do only need one to two minutes per side, depending on thickness.

Yummy! The mustard sauce complemented the scallops well. It was full-bodied, but didn't overpower the scallops. Very quick to make.

Delicious sauce; too many scallops! 3/4 lb is a bit much for two people. Scallops are a bit bland in taste, though intriguing in texture. I cut it back to 1/4 lb of bay scallops, and added half a roasted red onion, and half a roasted red pepper, both chopped. Much better, and definitely a keeper.

Have made this recipe twice and both times it was excellent. The caraway rice cakes are easy to make and a great side dish.

I liked this recipe OK, but my husband was very clear that he was not a big fan. We fixed both shrimp and scallops, since we are not huge scallop fans. It was a pretty good recipe, but we have had better. (Also, we were not impressed at all with the caraway rice cakes. Plain rice or orzo would be much better.)

The only change I have made to this recipe is to substitute Creole Mustard for the Dijon. This is one of our favorite dishes. The Caraway Rice Cakes are always a welcome side dish to many of our other seafood dishes.

Try this sometime, you won't be disappointed. The dijon mustard enhances the flavor, and using fresh scallops like I did (delivered to my front door), made all the difference.
