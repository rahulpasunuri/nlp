Made this for friends over the weekend to rave reviews. Cut the honey to 4 tbsp. and added some lime juice. Coated the fish earlier in the day and just popped them in the broiler when guests arrive. Suspect this would be good done on a cedar plank, too.

This has become my signature recipe for salmon - everyone loves it. I leave out the sugar and halve the honey, add lots more cilantro. Made it last night with fresh TUNA - because the tuna looked so good at the fish counter - but it wasn't as good as the salmon. Prefer the Tuna Rau recipe.

this is our favorite go to salmon recipe but it has evolved over time...we add a large minced clove of garlic, sometimes we eliminate the chipotle entirely or substitute chili garlic sauce with the red rooster and green cap instead. we always eliminate the brown sugar and use only 1 1/2 TBS of honey so it isn't too sweet. the salmon looks gorgeous with its shiny glaze and the honey/ hoisin/ ginger/ cilantro flavors are delicious.

Such a quick & easy weeknight meal! My BF simply LOVES it, I've made it multiple times, both with and without the adobo chili. I do the sauce as is (with all the honey) and steam broccoli as our side dish. The broccoli can't help but touch the salmon sauce/glaze and they are great together too!

Rating: 4
Really tasty. The chipotle chilies give it a nice kick that makes this more than just a standard sweet marinade. I was just making this for myself so I basically halved the sauce recipe, and used only a little honey. I ate it with stir-fried green beans, a nice combo...brown rice would have been good alongside too.

I made this last night and my boyfriend LOVED it! From previous comments, I only used 1.5 Tbsp of honey which provided plenty of flavour! I complemented the dish with the stir fried shanghai bok choy (recipe available on this site) and jasmine rice!

This is by far my favorite salmon recipe. I've discovered that you can use the herbs in the tubes (most stores carry them) and use the cilantro & ginger, instead of hassling with those. The recipe is that much easier!!!! A definite hit at every party!

I love this salmon dish! I usually add a bit more cilantro. Also, I use chipotle chilis a lot. I take a whole can with adobo sauce and process it together and store in fridge. When recipe calls for chilis I just use the paste by tablespoon (or teaspoon depending on how hot you want it!).

This dish was very easy - minimal preparation for the sauce and the overall dish. The sauce had great flavor. I made it for a crowd (used a large filet, not steaks) and it's the same amount of work whether you're cooking for 1 or for a crowd - it just depends on the size piece of salmon and the amount of sauce.

My husband really liked it, I liked it too but I may add more cilantro and ginger for more kick. Since I don't have hoisin, I made it with soy sauce. Really tasty - very easy.

I think this is an extraordinary recipe. This dish is beautifully glazed and so tasty. I also used less honey as recommended by reviewers and less chipotle in adobo. I make this dish often as it is fast and easy with great results. Highly recommended.

Rating: 4
Great dish, with just a bit of modification. I agree with others, it's a bit too sweet. Here's what I did: left all ingredients as written, with exception of honey. I started with just 1 tablespoon and added more honey, bit by bit, until the glaze tasted right. You'll know when it gets there (although I bet I only put 1.5 tablespoons of honey). Some reviewers have compared this to "Dave's Salmon" also on this site. I've made that one too and although these are comparable preparations, they are different. This dish has chipotle peppers and I think the heat is what sets this one apart.

Four forks because it is incredibly delicious and impossibly fast and easy. So much flavour! This looked like many recipes we'd made before but turned out much, much better! Absolutlely exquisite. My husband insisted on the "four fork" rating too!

OMGiH, this is soooo good! I was a bit concerned when I saw all the comments about it being too sweet, but decided to try it anyway. Am I ever glad I did! I'm not a huge salmon fan, but my husband loves it, so I'm always looking for ways to cook it that we both enjoy. This one definitely fit the bill. I omitted the cilantro since I thought it would burn and be odd under the broiler, and I'm not that big a fan, anyway. The only other alteration I made was to add two cloves of pressed garlic to the glaze. That put paid to any extra sweetness. Used skinless fillets rather than salmon steaks with no ill effect. This one is a keeper, and will go in the "easy for company, tastes like you slaved all day" box.

This is my favorite way to make salmon and its always a big hit. Sometimes I have had to substitute something for the Hoisin sauce and have used tomato sauce which isnt bad. I usually add more ginger and a little more chipotle.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe at least 15 times. I haven't made any changes to the glaze itself except that I usually just 'eyeball' the ingredients so I'm sure that I use a little more ginger and chipotle than is called for. I have never found this glaze to be too sweet. The last several times I have made the glaze to use on whole sides of salmon that are grilled over lump charcoal with a little mesquite added. I served it at a party in August and had to make a dozen copies of the recipes for our guests. I am making it again this weekend for a charity dinner and plan to have copies of the recipe ready to hand out.

You pay a good price for salmon and this recipe just coats it in sugary stuff. I left out the honey and brown sugar - just the sweetness in the hoisin was too much. I thought my good salmon would be ruined if I added all this sweetness. Good fish requires something more subtle, something where you can actually taste the fish! Take a look at "Dave's Marinated Salmon" on this site. 98% of reviewers would make that again and it has similiar ingredients, just with different ratios.

I was almost put off by the "too sweet" comments, but it looked so good and the ingredients were in the house, so I made it anyway. We thought it was wonderful.

We liked the spicy sweetness of the marinade with the salmon. Easy to make - would be a good way to use salmon that's been frozen. Also, I followed a previous reviewer's advice and added a little lime juice and fresh minced garlic.

Not good. I cut the honey down to 2 tbsp, and still found the flavor sickeningly sweet. The hoisin-honey overpowered and conflicted with the freshness of the fillet. If you like salmon, try the maple pepper salmon bites on this site. It imparts a subtle sweet taste that won't turn your appetite.

The sauce in this recipe over powers the delicate taste of salmon. It was also too sweet for fish even after I cut the amount of honey. This sauce itself would work well on something bland like tofu.

Rating: 4
Salmon is a great fish to make and hard to screw up unless you over cook it (unlike other types of fish that are more temperamental than people). This sauce is great too. I could not find chipotle peppers, so I experimented by adding some canned mild chili peppers and some chipotle hot sauce (makes sense, I think). It turned out great. It's easy and impressive too served with rice, orzo (try the orzo and pine nut salad on Epicurious), or just about anything. Add a bottle of your favorite cabernet and some crusty Italian bread and you are an instant gourmet. Write to me and tell me how it turned out.

My husband and I made this for the first time in 1999, shortly after the recipe was published. We loved it and made it for various guests over the next couple of months. Everyone loved it. So, when we got married in October of 1999 we served it to 90 people at our wedding (along with a few other things)! We still have people telling us that our the food at our wedding was the best they've ever had. I cannot recommend the recipe highly enough.

I am not sure if people will be annoyed by this review or appreciate it (because of my adjustments), but here it goes... I really enjoyed the dish with the following adjustments: I put only 3 tablespoons of honey and 1/2 tablespoon of brown sugar. I used a little lime juice and also added some fresh minced garlic. Left all the other ingredients and amounts the same. The combo of hoisin, ginger, honey, and fresh cilantro is amazing! I made this with sauteed "garlicky" pea sprouts and some rice. On the side, I had mango salsa and yummmmm - it was divine! I used a recipe similar to the one on epicurious for the mango salsa.

I've made this 4 times already and I just found it last week! The kids (already very picky) and I love it! My husband was so-so because he's not really into anything too sweet. Did not use cilantro, since I hate the stuff, only used 5 tbsp of honey, and 1 1/2 tsp of hot chili sauce instead of what was asked for, and 2 1/2 tsp of ground ginger instead of the fresh. I marinate for 1 hour or overnight. Absolutely delicious!

I didn't have chipotle chiles on hand, but for a little spice, I put in about a tsp of Chinese Chili Sauce. The honey/Hoisin/ginger combo is full of flavor. Very easy, quick and delicious. Just make sure you don't overcook your fish!

I've made this repeatedly for family and guests. Everyone loves it -- including my six-year-old daughter who will eat an adult portion and ask for seconds. I've subbed dried cilantro when pressed, and even used different chili powders in a pinch. Grilled it, broiled it. No problem; it's still always wonderful. The glaze is tasty with other things, too, like whatever bland vegetables or pasta might be served on the plate.

This was a very flavorful glaze. Next time, I will marinate the salmon in it for an hour or 2 to maximize the flavor. It also worked well for the chicken breast that I made for my fish-hating husband!

I made this for dinner tonight with the Spicy Sesame and Ginger Noodle Salad (also from the 1/99 issue - the Entertaining with Style section). A great combo of flavors (sweet, salty, spicy, smokey), and really good with the salad. (I omitted the cilantro - hate the stuff).

I made this for a potluck on Christmas day using a 2 lb fillet of sockeye salmon and everyone loved it. I would warn you to go easy on the honey (I would probably decrease by about 2 tablespoons) and as I am chinese, I would increase the ginger and cilantro. I let this marinade for a few hours and roasted it at about 375 F for 20 minutes, which was perfect.

I double the quantity of peppers because I like it spicier. I've made this recipe more times than I can remember. The sauce is wonderful; the chipotle peppers give a smoky/spicy flavor, the ginger makes the sauce very aromatic, and the cilantro gives the sauce a very fresh flavor. (Tip: If you are going to make a lot of this sauce, always add the cilantro within a few hours of cooking, because the cilantro loses its freshness if it is stored too long.) You may as well make copies of this recipe if you cook it for guests, because they will certainly be asking you for the recipe! Like others, I've used this sauce for pork, also. If you're looking for the perfect sauce for salmon, search no further - this is it.

Tried this recipe with only two pieces of fresh salmon so had to reduce quantities. Thought that it was delicious! The chilies and sugar give it a very nice sharp/sweet combo. It also gets a nice crust on top that is a good contrast to the soft texture of the fish. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was absolutely delicious and easy to prepare. I had the hardest time finding the chilies but it was worth the time. The fish came out nice and juicy and the sauce was caramelized over it. I would, however, make 2-3 times more sauce next time just to make sure there is enough.

This is an excellent recipe for salmon. The sauce is what makes the dish - fresh cilantro, hoisin, chipolte. I used 4 tbls of honey and added 1 tbls of the adobe sauce from the chipoltes to increase the heat. I made sure the grill was hot and well oiled before I put the fillets on.

I liked the sauce but just didn't feel it complemented salmon. I am a real fish lover and suppose I don't want the taste masked. However, I will use the leftover sauce for chicken which I think would go very well with. This is the first recipe from this site that I wouldn't bother with again. I hate to write negatively but the reason I like this site so much is because of everyone's opinions and advice--as much for the education, I enjoy the rapport with other cooks.

I've made this about five times now and I think I've perfected it. Use only 2 tsp. honey. Skip the brown sugar altogether. Use only the best hoisin, as this makes the dish together with the cilantro.

I also reserve some sauce for dipping. Yum yum!

This sauce is absolutely amazing. I've made it with salmon about three times and it was fabulous. It's also delicious as a barbecue sauce for chicken. I cut down the honey to a little less than 4 T, as other reviewers suggested, and this last time I added back the brown sugar. Don't leave it out! (Even if you cut back on the honey) It adds a bit of depth to the sauce. The other thing I've tried is making the sauce a day ahead to let the flavors marry a bit - it really does make a difference in the flavor. If you aren't wild about cilantro, I'd recommend making the sauce up without it and trying it with a small bit of cilatro at first. It isn't overwhelming and it adds to the flavor.

After trying this great salmon preparation in February, I've served it several times to appreciative family and guests. It is now the recipe I think of first when I want fish. I've used skinless fillets rather than steaks. The only thing that would make this fabulous recipe better would be to enjoy it with a Lantana's view.

My husband raved about it for days and said it was the best salmon dish he ever had. It was very quick and easy to make and I am already planning to make it again. Great flavor.

Easy to make and a real treat. I can't wait to try this again in the summer on the grill.

I thought that this dish was easy to prepare and excellent. When I make it again I will make 1/2 the amount of glaze though. You really don't need to use very much.

Excellent! To die for! Will make this one over and over and can already anticipate rave reviews
