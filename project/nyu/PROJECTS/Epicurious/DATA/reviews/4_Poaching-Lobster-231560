My husband and I rated this recipe as one of the best things we ever ate. I made this last year for our dinner-for-two we always have on Christmas Eve and it was delicious. It is indeed time intensive, as you have to make the stock to make the vinaigrette, but very much worth it. I am making this again this year!
