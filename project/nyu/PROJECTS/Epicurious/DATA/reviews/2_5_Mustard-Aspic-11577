About 10 years ago my step-mother made this and served it with ham for a xmas buffet. She had a pretty mold and served it on a platter with fresh blackberries around the edge and some greens for garnish. It was beautiful as well as a wonderful taste with the ham. I am going to make it this year with my ham.

I made this as one of three aspics that I cut into 1" cubes and put in a patterned herringbone-ish arrangement for a dinner party (the other two were a spicy tomato aspic and an avocado aspic). This one was a good companion, a little tart. Would be best served in small portions in contrast to a nice heavy meat stew.
