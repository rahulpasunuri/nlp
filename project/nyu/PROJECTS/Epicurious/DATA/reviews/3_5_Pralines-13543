This was an easy recipe and it yielded great results! I used toasted pecans and it made a big difference - delicious!

To the reviewer who said they were "too sweet"--that is entirely the point. You don't make pralines if you don't want sweet. That is like saying you made a pecan pie that was "too pecany." To the reviewer who asked if you can double the recipe--yes, BUT you better have a helper to dollop them quickly as if you are working solo, they will harden on you in the pan. These are by far the most requested holiday treat I make. Weather does play a role, so pick a dry day or they will be runny.Flavorings do give different tastes so experiment with cocoa, rum, bourbon, maple, etc...all are spectacular and guaranteed to make your teeth ache from the sweetness.

I have made this recipe many times and love it. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested mixing the praline mixture in a KitchenAid mixer or speed 2 for about 10 minutes. This helped. I am curious if anyone has doubled the recipe with success.

Wonderfully quick and simple, and the taste is DIVINE! I toasted the pecans, which I definitely recommend. I did have two minor problems: 1)I think I worked too slowly on dropping the mixture onto the wax paper -- the first few came out beautifully shiny & smooth, while the rest were dull & a bit grainy in texture (though still tasted fabulous). 2) I couldn't get the beautiful shiny, smooth ones off of the wax paper -- I think I'd go with the prepared pans next time (two probably would be sufficient, rather than four). Anyway, these candies still garnered Raves!

I made this last Christmas and will make them again this year. They came out perfectly. I made some plain and made several batches flavored with a tablespoon of dark rum (Myers) and two teaspoons of fresh grated orange peel. Use your imagination on flavorings. Tasted like the best of New Orleans!

This was WAY too sweet. I think I could've cut a 1/3 out and it might have been better.

Pralines come out best if made in DRY weather. On humid days they sometimes refuse to harden. Hope that helps.

I have made these several times; they are amazing. I drop spoonfuls into foil cupcake liners, then let them harden. Then I peel off the foil and wrap them in individual pieces of plastic wrap. Or, just serve them in the foil cups. Be sure to lightly toast the pecans first.

These pralines are delicious!!! I made two batches of them today - having a mexican fiesta tomorrow. Took some to my friend who is from New Orleans - she loved them. My only change - I didn't let the mixture cool to add the butter and vanilla. Enjoy!

This recipe produced authentic New Orleans pralines--creamy, sweet and delicious! It was extremely easy to make. However, I cut wax paper into individual squares, laid them across the counter, and dropped the indivudual candies on each to set; there is almost no mess and makes for quicker packing since you need wax paper anyway.

Please note, when a recipe calls for 2 1/2 cups of grains that it is not the same conversion as 8oz = 1cup. In grain measurements, 2oz=1/2 cup. So in this case a 10oz bag would be the 2 1/2 cups the recipe calls for. I did not know this before and used a 16oz bag of pecans...kinda nutty but still very tasty.

Try it, you'll like it!

I also couldn't get the pralines to solidify. It came out too soft and tasted too buttery to me. However, I'm new to candy making, so maybe that's the problem, not the recipe.

I loved it SO much! I have never made a dessert that I loved so much. Since I live in Louisiana it is hard to compete with all of the praline recipies that are out there, but with this one, I have no problem!Now that I have made it for my family, all they keep saying is, "When are you going to make those WONDERFUL pralines again?" These pralines melt in your mouth and the kids love them too! Thank you for taking your time to make this wonderful recipie. My family will be making these for many years to come! from, Praline lover!

It was way too sweet and way too soft! The pralines just fell apart when I tried to peel them off the wax paper. Half of them never even solidified. I was hoping to make a big batch to mail to relatives for Christmas but unfortunately this is not to be.

First time out it turned to sugar but was still delicious. Will try buttering the sides of the pan first to prevent this happening again. Also, to save on clean-up don't use pans for cooling the pralines (wax paper works just fine).

Loved this recipe, made the pralines very easily! I am a baker but not a candy maker and this was the first time I ever used a candy thermometer...was a breeze! It went over like gangbusters at our Mardi Gras block party. I love recipes that are simple and effective.
