This is an excellent and very easy to make meal that doesn't need a single thing changed except to adjust the cayenne to taste. The cayenne adds a great kick and the orange salad is a refreshing complement to the fried fish. I fried the fish in peanut oil, which was excellent. I love when something this easy and simple turns out so tasty.

When I read the reviews, I had to try to make this dish. What a surprise, it was delicious!!!!! I wanted to try dipping it in evaporated milk but opted to try it next time. The cornmeal crust made it moist inside. I did season the fish with Kosher salt and cayenne pepper aside from seasoning the cornmeal. The dressing was delicious but added additional 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Instead of using fresh oranges, I used chilled mandarin oranges.

What a great lunch dish!!! The one variation I made was a trick I learned from the Dookie Southern Cookbook. Dip in evaporated milk and then seasoned flour. The result is a wonderful crispy crust with a very moist inside. The evaporated milk makes the coating cling to the fish.

I had everything but the cornmeal, so I decided to just coat in wheat flour and cayenne. I also cooked in olive oil to continue with the flavour in the dressing. It took longer to cook, obviously, but the combination was exceptional. This was easy, interesting and fun to do. The presentation is lovely. Just go easy on the onion.

I have made the catfish without the arugula-orange salad. It is very easy--no breadcrumbs, no dipping in egg or milk. The cornmeal crust comes out crispy. I add garlic powder to the cornmeal mixture or garlic salt would work. My husband loves it and I do too. I do plan to try it with the salad.
