Good dish. I used the cream cheese instead of mayo. I would probably do it with shrimp next time. Also better with a sweeter bell pepper, red or yellow, instead of green.

The batter was very good, though very messy to work with. The heat of the jalapenos varied so widely that some members of my heat-loving family were bored while others looked like they were going to have heart attacks. Furthermore, the crab mixture is very bland. Stuff that into a hot jalapeno and you have a very disappointing dish overall.

Good recipe. I agree with the other reviewers that is you're in a hurry this recipe isn't for you. I would suggest wearing rubber gloves when seeding the jalapenos. I seeded them by hand, instead of using the knife, and my hands burned for about 8 hours.

I took it to a gourmet dinner. It was a hit. So was the sauce to go with it. The hardest part was getting the seeds and membrane out without breaking the chili. I made them hours before. Then fried them at the last minute. I'm making them again this weekend. My husband requested them.

Delicious starter. To make the recipe hotter add a few of the seeds to the stuffing. Instead of frying can be brushed with olive oil and cooked on the grill!

I made these as part of an appetizer buffet for my Christmas Eve guests. Obviously can be spicy and takes a bit of time to make so if you're in a hurry this is not the recipe for you. I doubled it so cleaning and stuffing 24 jalapenos took time. I had a few leftover so the next day I just heated them well in a nonstick skillet. Very good.

Not worth the effort

What a yummy appetizer! The crowd loved it and it wasn't hard to make. Definately serving this one again.

This was absolutely delicious and a crowd pleaser. I made this for a "stuffed appetizer" theme party. It was a big hit and received high marks for creativity. The accompanying sauce is delicious as well. A hint: if you have sensitive skin, wear plastic gloves when preparing the jalepenos; especially if you will be removing your contact lenses anytime soon after preparing this dish.
