Easy as pie to make. Next time I will decrease the sugar to 1/3 cup. Also, I always make a cream pie by chilling custard in the pan, baking crust as close to serving time as possible, allowing it to cool for a bit and them assemble pie just before serving. Crust is much better if it never hits the fridge. Also, bananas will not darken.

I haven't made the pie yet, but am going to try for Christmas. I am commenting in case it is helpful to other cooks...if you let the custard set and then disrupt it (cool completely and then put in pie crust), it will get soupy every time (this si the same with all custard pies). The starches bind the custard together as it cools. Once cooled you cannot stir it, etc., otherwise it will disrupt the binder and get soupy. The trick is letting the filling cool from hot to warm and then filling the crust. Hope this helps.

I had this pie at the restaurant, then made it yesterday. Remember to top it with whipped cream and then drizzle with chocolate and caramel syrup as they do at the restaurant. Also, use very ripe bananas. That makes a huge difference. Cool the custard with the vanilla bean in it for extra vanilla flavor.

Don't let the bad reviews fool you -- follow the recipe exactly and the read the directions ... the result is a PERFECT banana cream pie. AND it's easy!! The only addition I made was from previous reviewers recommending a mashed banana into the filling as it's cooling.

Make this pie.. and then be prepared to pass out the recipe! It really is superb. I made the pie as directed, except I used cinnamon grahams (which I recommend). That said, I agree with A Cook from Andover; cut the grahams from 2- 1/2C to 1-3/4C, it really is all crust as written. I would omit the sugar in the crust next time, too, it is plenty sweet without the addition. For those who experienced soupy and/or pasty custard, you simply did not cook it long enough. The mixture needs to be thick thick thick before you pull it off the heat, not just 'thickening." That will also elimate the problem of the pastey (starchy) taste. I plan to use this custard in my holiday trifle this year, it is sublime!

I've been making 2 of these every Thanksgiving for the past 5 years. There are probably 6 other pies at my sister's and both the banana cream pies go. This recipe is really above average. I cut the 2-1/2 cups of graham crackers down to 1-3/4 cups, otherwise it's all crust. It's a hit everytime!

Rating: 1
The custard came out soupy. I was worried about that problem from reading other people's reviews... so I payed close attention to it. The custard seemed to thicken up really well when I first made it. And then I put it in the fridge to cool and it set fine in the bowl! Then I put it in the pie and it got all soupy overnight...what the hell is up with that?

Loved it! Filling held its shape beautifully even when I didn't let it set for the full 8 hours. Two changes: I added another 1/4 cup of banana purée to the custard and I topped it with whipped cream. I do recommend using the vanilla bean because it really makes it look elegant and sets it apart from something you'd find at a diner. It was delicious and my entire family happily devoured it!

In the words of my toddler: "Moe nannie pie peas!" This was very good and I don't usually like banana cream pie. I made as directed except used a store-bought crust. I added Chocolate Rum Sauce (also from this site) to the slices of pie when served. Super yummy!

Gorgeous! Between the rich vanilla custard, fresh banana slices, and tender graham cracker crust, this is SO much nicer than your standard whipped-up, homogenous banana cream pie. First, a confession: I tweaked the recipe a tad based on other reviewers' recs and my preference for a bit less fat in the custard. What I changed: I used 2.5 cups of whole milk and .5 cups heavy whipping cream instead of the 1.5/1.5 ratio called for in the recipe. I also substituted 1/3 cup packed brown sugar for the regular sugar called for in the crust recipe. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written and had no trouble with the custard coming together. The vanilla bean really makes the custard quite special, but you could easily sub vanilla bean paste or high-quality vanilla extract (I rec Penzey's double-strength vanilla) for the bean. I sped up the cooling process by putting the bowl in an ice bath. No problem getting the crust to fill my 10' pie plate, either. We let the pie rest in the fridge for a full day before eating. Despite my hesitancy over the filling, this cut beautifully and slices held their shape. Would be over-the-top decadent with vanilla whipped cream on top.

This is my go to recipe for a dessert everyone loves. Sometimes, I am too lazy to strip out a vanilla bean, so I just use about 2 tsp of vanilla and it still tastes great. Also, this recipe is very resilient. If I happen to not have enough cream, I just substitue with milk. The custard is still thick and creamy. One more note, this recipe makes ALOT of pie so make sure that you have a deep bottom pie dish!

Rating: 4
Really great recipe, I followed the instructions strictly aside from substituting 2% milk for whole, using 4 yolks instead of 3, and adding one pureed banana as the very last ingredient to the custard (this really upped the flavor to banana/vanilla from just vanilla). I also used a store bought crust. I also topped the pie with heaps of homemade vanilla whipped cream. I found it very easy to make and very delicious!

Are you kidding ME? I've made this recipe for years and it's a family favorite! I've never had any trouble with it. When you cook the crust it will puff up with the banana in it. You have to leave it as is, you can't try to press down. Otherwise the curst will get tough.

Rating: 2
I really like this recipe. I made it according to the recipe, adding half a cup of mashed banana to the pudding and topping the pie with whipped cream and additional bananas that had been tossed with lime juice. I grated dark chocolate over the top of the whole pie. My husband who requested this pie was not much of a fan. He thought it was too creamy and the crust was oddly chewy. I liked this contrast, but I will admit that the crust is problematic. The recipe does not make enough to cover the pie dish and it is very difficult to cut. Overall, I give this recipe a B-B+

Please, for all that is good in the world, step away from this recipe. It is cursed, I believe. Everything that can go wrong will go wrong, or at least it did for me. Oh, a few things went right. Well, two things went right. I successfully whisked everything together that needed to be whisked together, and it took on the consistency it was supposed to, and I had a damn fine time dissecting a $13 vanilla bean. But I'll admit it, perhaps I got cocky because the pie seemed to be progressing well. When I was supposed to let the custard cool for an hour, I let it cool for several hours. By then it had turned into a hard, spongy mess of sorts that could not be spread into the crust (which turned out well enough, by the way, although I see other reviewers saved time and bought one from the store). As I was looking at that sad slop of a mess, the finished pie, I started thinking about the other banana cream pie I made last year, the one that my husband liked so much that he requested banana cream pie again this year for his birthday. And now it's his birthday and we're about to take an obligatory bite of this, this, this THING, and then we'll probably put it away and then I'll get out the $7 store-bought banana cream pie that looks far better than this disaster. Please, I don't know you but I want you to continue forward in life with a healthy amount of self-respect. So skip this and make the black bottom banana cream pie instead. I beg you. (I am giving this two forks because, as my husband points out, I did not follow the recipe as I should have. Mea culpa. But be careful, cooks. Be careful.)

Rating: 2
I tried this twice; the first time it was good enough to save to my Recipe Box so I must have liked it then (but I do remember not liking the banana in the crust, made it too hard.) This time I thought the filling was pasty, as another reviewer said. Set up fine, I stirred constantly until thick. Maybe the difference between the two pies is that I used ONLY 2 tblsp butter and not the 1/4 cup (the butter error). Will try again, maybe with slightly less corn starch OR with pulverized tapioca as I use in fruit pies (has anyone ever used that in a cream pie??)

Before making this recipe, I read some of the reviews too see what some of the probloems were, I tweeked this one as follows: I used a store bought crust which worked great and saved me a lot of time, I used 2% milk instead of whole milk, I took one of the banana's and pureed it with a lil bit of the milk and then added it to the custard so the custard was banana flavored while it was cooling. Made a huge difference, I then added a packet of gelatin after reading that the pie dosent set very well and the gelatin made it do so. Then on top I added fresh whipping cream then added a lil sweetened coconut to top it off. It was ammmmmmmmaaaaaaaaazzzzzzzzzing

WOW, YUM!!! soooooo RICH, you only need a small slice. I especially loved the crust - a bit chewy but could be eaten on its own. I couldn't find my darn vanilla bean (drat!) so just added a bit of extra vanilla at the end. I ended up using a whole liter of whipping cream (though there is lots of whipped cream left over) Watch out this is one fattening pie! Next time Id like to try lightening it up a bit.

This is THE best banana cream pie I have ever made or eaten. The custard is so creamy and delicious that you cannot stop eating the filling while preparing the rest of the pie. I have made this pie for family dinners for a few years now and this pie is always the only one where there are no leftovers for the next day.

I just made the custard and it is chilling as I write this, but it had a great flavor. I wonder if anyone else noticed the error in the receipe. For the filling it says to add 2tbls or 1/4stick of butter - but a 1/4 stick of butter is 4tbls. I only put in 2 to be safe.

Alright, I had a little help and and advice from a pastry chef, but I think it is the answer to previous posts********CONSTANTLY WHISK AS YOU SLOWLY POUR IN MILKS (it took me maybe 3-4min)..when you add the yolks turn on burner just until sauce pan is warm to touch...MIX UNTIL NAPPE&REMOVE, STRAIN, ADD BUTTER, VANILLA EXTRACT, AND CHOCOLATE TO CRUST (not necessary)...LET SET OVER NIGHT WITH PLASTIC WRAP ON TOP OF CUSTARD MIX ONLY.

I have tried this pie twice now. Both times the custard would not set up and it was impossible to slice. However, it is a very tasty pie and everyone loved it. I took a reader's advice and made it in a spring form pan and that worked well. Does anyone have any advice on how to get this to set- up? Both times, I made this the day before and it should have had plenty of time to set. If not, I won't bother making this again.

The custard for this recipe is amazing. I would use it with just plain fruit in a fancy glass it's that fabulous. I didn't care for the crust, however. The addition of the banana mash gave it a weird flavor. I'd use the same filling with a basic graham cracker crust next time I make this.

I really don't understand why so many people think this recipe is great. After reading the reviews, I was excited to make it for company last weekend. I followed instructions to the letter, and had no problems. However, I think the taste of the custard is pastey!! No one I served it to said much about the pie at all...not a good sign. I did like the addition of the banana to the crust, but that was about it. Really dissapointed with this one!

Wicked good. I added unsweetened coconut to the crust and the custard, and topped with toasted coconut (we like coconut around here) and it was great; looked fantastic and tasted even better. The crust is terrific, really makes the pie. We couldn't wait 8 hrs, we busted into it after only about 5-6 hrs and it was set up pretty well, but it was even better the next day.

Great tasting pie, people raved about it. Definitely needs to sit with the banana for several hours. I had a problem with it firming up so it didn't come out as slices. Next time I make it I'll take the advice of other reviewers for a thicker custard to see if it sets up better.

Great recipe. I didn't make the crust, but rather used a traditional crust. For the filling I increased the yolks by adding one additional yolk. It is a bit rich this way so next time I would slightly increase the starch and use the 3 yolks as suggested. This recipe does need additional vanilla though.

This recipe makes for a deliciously creamy banana cream pie. The custard is lightly sweet so it's not as cloying as some versions are. The crust is easy to make and offers a nice crunch to counterpoint the creaminess of the filling. The end result was delicious!

This was the best Banana Cream Pie I have ever made. I sprayed the pie plate with non stick cooking spray. The Pie did not stick at all. I processed the banana in the food processor along with the cracker crumbs and butter. I used two whole vanilla beans and increased the cornstarch to about 1/2 cup, pluss I added an extra egg yolk. The pie set up beautifully. Would have been ready long before the 8 hour stand time. Everyone loved this pie.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious even made with a little less sugar and fat. My husband loves banana pudding and this was a classy, decadent version. For the crust I cut the butter in half and used Trader Joe's cinnamon grahams which have some sugar on top instead of adding sugar to the crust. I also reduced the sugar in the filling to 1/3 c and cut the fat too, using 1 c heavy cream with 2 c reduced-fat milk. It was still uber-rich tasting with way fewer calories. Will make again and again!

Rating: 3
Hmmm. I would not discribe this as a traditional banana cream pie recipe. Its more of a banana pudding pie. In fact. the mixture turned out very similar to a creme brulee. It was very tasty, but not exactly the classic, light banana cream pie that I was imagining. I would make it again, and next time I will try the crust recipe. This time I used my standard pie crust recipe, which was good, but I bet this crust would be even better.

Rating: 0
Overall, wonderful. I used 3 cups of whole milk instead of using the 1 1/2 cups of cream. I actually forgot to add the butter at the end and no one missed it. If you're skipping out of the cream, I recommend adding an additional 2 tbsps of corn starch to help thicken the custard. The custard will seem too thick, but once you add the bananas, it loosens up to a perfect consistency. I added some whip cream on top instead of having it in the filling. Used my own graham cracker crust recipe, so can't make a comment on the crust. I agree with the others -- letting it sit for at least 8 hours is a MUST. The fragrant vanilla-scented cream permeates the bananas and vice versa. A winner!!!

I've reviewed this recipe before and gave it a terrific rating. I made it again last night, but I made a couple of changes that I wanted to share. I used a shortbread crust (no banana crushed in it) rather than the graham cracker. I was not wild about the graham cracker crust. It's a taste preference, surely, but I liked it much better. I'm going to experiment with a crust made from Pecan Sandies the next time I make it. Second, I added a thin chocolate layer to the bottom of the pie. I took 6 oz of semi-sweet chocolate (Valrhona) and 6 tbs of milk and microwaved. I then spread it on the cooled crust. It took an already heavenly pie and pushed it over the edge.

Rating: 4
Amazing! I was a little skeptical about this pie just cuz there is no "cream" but it was perfectly delicious without it. The chewy, dense, banana-graham cracker crust is definitely the highlight of this pie. I cut back on the sugar a little bit in the pie since i was using an almost black, VERY RIPE banana (and the flavor turned out super banana-y, which is what i was looking for!). I did not have a problem with the amount of custard as i was able to do 3 layers of it along with 2 layers of bananas (i only needed 4 bananas for the filling). I used HEAVY CREAM instead of whipping cream, and it turned out fine. I also did not have a problem with the crust sticking to the pie plate. Maybe it was because i used like a ceramic one instead of glass? Or maybe that i (by mistake) added an extra 1/8 cup of butter for the crust (it made the crust extra chewy!!! IT WAS SO GOOD!) But i also think chilling it for at least 8 hours is very important!!! This is seriously delicious!

This was delicious and fairly easy to make. The long wait time was problematic -- I wasn't sure when to make it to have it ready on time and we ended up digging in to early, but it was still great. My only complaint was that I also had problems with the crust sticking to the pan. Like glue!!! I thought it was odd that the recipe did not specify over-ripe bananas for the crust -- I wonder if that would have kept it from sticking. Any thoughts?? I will definitely make again, but I'll ... I don't know ... butter the pie dish?

This pie is AMAZING. Don't save time by using a store-bought crust--the crust is part of what makes this recipe amazing. I use 1 whole banana for the crust and cut down on the sugar by just a bit. Also, I always use organic cream, milk, etc--I think it makes a difference in the taste. SO good.

AMAZING. I have made this twice. I bump up the vanilla extract (no vanilla bean) and cut the sugar a tiny bit. I buy a large graham crust (yeah, my bad) and spread an over-ripe smooshed banana on the bottom underneath the first layer of sliced bananas. The filling is so marvelously decadent the way it is, but I have also made it with 1&1/2 c fat free half and half, 1/2c whipping cream and 1c whole milk- still delicious.

This pie was excellent. I followed the recipe (didn't have vanilla bean so added a little extra vanilla extract instead) and it was perfect. Cream amount was just right. Not sure why some had to increase it. The only thing I can think of is if you buy a store made crust - it will be a lot thinner than this one that you make-so you would need more filling. Make this crust-it is excellent!

Good pie, but in my opinion, the portions were off. I had to double the custard recipe to fill the pie pan. I also had to add whipped cream, as it didn't look right or taste right without it. And it seemed like a bit too much crust. With these additions, it was a nice recipe.

I made this recipe the other night for my husband, he recently was in Charleston, SC and raved about a banana cream pie he had a restaurant so I went on the hunt for a recipe that would dazzle him like in Charleston. This was absolutely a great pie, it was rather time consuming to put together but worth it. I loved the idea of the fresh vanilla bean, even though it cost $9.00 for one bean it was well worth the flavor of having it. I had never used fresh vanilla beans so thank you as I will now incorporate this in my baking more. I made my own graham cracker crumbs with cinnamon graham crackers and this was a nice addition to the banana cream pie. After it baked I also melted chocolate chips and coated the bottom of the crust with chocolate, it was a nice flavor enhancer!

This was a great dessert. I can only comment on the filling because I used a store-bought crust, but it was very good. The custard thickened up really nicely and had a nice subtle flavour to it. I was not able to fit 5 bananas in the pie. I got two layers of banana using 3 of them, but it was more than enough. I also only chilled it for about 4 hours (my hubby's willpower is non-existent when I bake). I ended up using light cream (6% MF) instead of whole milk (3.5%) because the cream came in smaller containers and I didn't want to waste any of the milk. It made it just a tad rich for us, so a small piece was more than enough. Next time I'll try the whole milk, but it was still delicious and I'll make it again.

Nice dessert recipe when time is short. I made this pie yesterday just 2 hours before dinner guests were expected to arrive, and everyone loved it. It is a comfort food dessert. I did make 2 substitutions --#1 I made a crust of Nilla Wafers rather than the crust in this recipe because I didn't want to have to refrigerate the pie for 8 hours for the crust to soften and because I think Nilla Wafers go with banana cream. #2 I used vanilla bean PASTE instead of the vanilla bean. Vanilla bean paste is the greatest thing since sliced bread! I'll never buy a vanilla bean pod again.

Great custard, very light, creamy with a wonderful vanilla note. I brought it to a boil and let boil just for a few seconds. Used all 5 bananas, I had a deep dish pie plate. Very easy to make, didn't try the crust because I wanted to use dough I had left over. Will try next time.

Okay, this isn't really a review of the entire recipe, but just for the crust. I liked the idea of the mashed banana to make it a little chewy, so I used this crust for my own banana cream pie recipe. I used vanilla wafers instead of graham crackers, and it was DELICIOUS. Perfect flavor and texture, nice and thick. My only complaint is that it's a tad too sweet, and I even have a huge sweet tooth. I'd cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup. Maybe next time I'll try the filling, too ;).

OK, before anyone jumps down my throat- I made a few adjustments to the recipe. I needed a one-crust pie with the ingredients I had on hand this Thanksgiving, so I made this. I subbed 2% milk for the whole milk and light cream (the kind you put in coffee) for the heavy cream, and had no vanilla bean on hand so I kicked up the extract a bit. Used all 5 bananas, but they were not as ripe as I would have liked. Did not use the crust, as I had dough for one standard crust I needed to use. Despite these things, the pie was *delicious*! People loved it! The custard was a little lumpy (my fault, didn't stir the whole time), but inside the pie you really didn't notice, and the banana flavor came through well even without extra-ripe bananas. Try it! I can't wait to see how it is with the crust next time!

This pie was VERY quick and easy to assemble. I would definitely make it again, however I would use more vanilla or vanilla bean in the process. I gave it two forks because it was a little bland. I also used 3 bananas instead of the 5 that were recommended. The crust is very tasty though!

This was so good that my roommate who doesn't like banana even loved it. I used store bought graham cracker pie shell instead. The banana flavor blends really nicely with the custard.

I made this pie for my boyfriend's birthday. Banana Cream is his favorite, and I was a little nervous that what I made wouldn't live up to his standards. I actually made a slight mistake while adding the ingredients for the custard, but I was able to redeem it. Although not the most asthetically pleasing pie, it was met with rave reviews at the party, and he went back for seconds. Great flavor, an abundance of bananas, and the crust was exceptional! I can't wait to make the pie again to experience what it really tastes like without my ingredient mix-up.

Needing something quicker than make-it-from-scratch custard, I opted for packaged pudding mix. Now don't turn up your nose,this was good: a large pkg of banana plus a small pkg of vanilla, follow the directions for pie and cool a bit before pouring into the crust. The crust for this recipe is killer. I made it a day ahead and brushed on melted semi-sweet chocolate as suggested by another reviewer. Added sliced bananas to the edges and topped with--don't squirm--Rediwhip. It was awesome. Got the best compliment ever: "This is something Grandma would've made."

Probably the most disgusting dessert I have ever had. Made it twice, once following the recipe to the letter and the second time lightening the pastry cream with whipped cream, as done in classical French cuisine. Neither version passed muster. Yuck.

I checked your other Banana Cream Pie recipes, and this seemed the easiest and most straight forward...and it was delicious! A very big hit at the dinner party I brought it to. I added vanilla whipped cream to the top, and would make it exactly like that again.

I am a pastry-phobe and was terrified to try this recipe, but it was much easier than I thought and the results were phenominal. I now get requests from the family for it. You really do need to let it set tho'... that crust is mighty hard.

I have made this twice now and the second time i didn't have enough bananas for the crust and it still turned out great. I added a drop of almond extract along with the vanilla and not only did it taste great but smelled wonderful.

This is a great pie! I brushed melted milk chocolate on the bottom of the crust, and it was a great addition. There wasn't enough custard to cover more than one layer of bananas, so I made whipped cream and layered that on top of a second layer of sliced bananas. Yum.

Have made this several times and it's a favorite! I use a lot less sugar than the recipe calls for and don't miss it one bit. Quick to make and impressive for guests

I was hesitant to try this recipe because of the earlier reviews and my husbands claim that his mom makes the best ever banana cream pie. I made this exactly per the instructions, and my husband is now eating humble pie!! My guests are still raving about how different and yummy it was!

Fantastic!!...and I don't even like banana cream pies! Big hit with the family. Only 1 change....used maybe 3 bananas instead of the 5 listed.

Everyone enjoyed it - and it wasn't difficult to make. I think I overdid the whipped cream topping. Less is more, I think, given that the pie is so good. In fact, I might not put it on the pie itself, but serve it on the side. The crust is excellent, by the way.

My family liked this a lot more than I did, although I liked the taste and texture. I added a whipped cream topping. The addition of the banana to the crust is a nice touch.

This recipe could use a stronger banana taste. I therefore added 1/4 cup creme de banana and an extra egg yolk. Everyone liked the results. Also I used one vanilla bean and left out the vanilla extract. If the creme becomes too thick thin it out with creme de banana.

I love this pie! I made it along with the Coconut Cream pie from Bon Appetit, Sept. 2002, and everyone loved them both. I used the crust from the Coconut Cream pie recipe for the Banana Cream pie so I could make two crusts at the same time. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

This is one of the best desserts I have ever made. I don't even particularly like bananas but I made this for my husband and we both love it! It is so creamy and "light" tasting at the same time. My family raves about this pie. Definitely make the whipped cream topping.

outstanding!!!I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. The crust and the custard were very tasty. I put whipped cream on the top for the finishing touch. I plan on making it again this week for a Holiday party.

Not a bad pie though not as yummy as other reviewers stated. Too much cornstarch made the vanilla filling too rubbery - reduce it by half. There has got to be a better banana cream pie recipe out there. On the up side, the crust was great with the added mashed banana.

This is a wonderful recipe, if you are in the mood for banana pudding. However, if it's Banana Cream Pie you are looking for--Keep Looking!

I thought overall this was a very good and very easy to prepare banana cream pie. It was even easier because I used boxed graham crumbs. The exceptional part of this pie to me was the custard. After tasting it with my daughters I wasn't sure it was going to make it to the pie crust! I might make that again by itself and it was so easy! Everyone in my family liked it very much but for me I prefer a less sweet traditional pastry crust.

I didn't have a lot of time, so I made it with a ready graham crackers crust. It was delicious. The custart is smooth and velvety. Even though it's very, very rich, and even though I gave a saturated fat warning, my guests all had it twice.

Wow - this was great. My friends and co-workers devoured it. I did not think the crust was too chewy. Everyone raved about it.

Great recipe. The graham cracker crust really compliments the filling. I didn't have vanilla bean but it turned out wonderfully anyhow. Next time I might chill the crust longer in order for it to set (when I sliced my pie, the crust was extremely crumbly).

Totally excellent. I used 1 cup cream and 2 cups whole milk for the pudding. Definitely use the vanilla bean. Yum.

Awesome pie and pretty easy to make. I didnt cook the crust as long as the recipe stated, and it made is more gooey. Also, I topped the pie with sweetened whipped cream amd added a small jar of baby food bananas to the whipped cream during the whipping process. It added a great touch!

well, my love life has been a bit dull lately by comparison. guess i'll have to see if this pie can liven things up for me! one question remains: the four fork rating. is that strictly for the pie or the entire evening??

This recipe was excellent. While the chewiness of the crust was a little unexpected, it had a great banana flavor to it. Definitely one of my favorites!

My husband's favorite pie is banana cream; he loved it except the chewiness of the crust bothered him. The custard part was very good though, and authentic, with the real flecks of vanilla.

Beyond words. It was so delicious. My son-in-law hardly ever eats dessert, but with this banana cream pie, he scraped his plate clean. It is the best banana cream pie I have ever had
