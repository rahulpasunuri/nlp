Very nice flavor. We just loved the sauce! My kids are already asking when we will make this again. I served it with rice which was just ok. I need to find something more interesting to serve with this meal. We did enjoy a nice salad with it, which kept the meal light. I would make 2 skewers per person next time.

Great grilled shrimp recipe! Loved the sauce...it does have a 'kick' to it so decrease the tobasco sauce if you don't have an asbestos tongue!

This is easy and delicious. My guests raved. I had large shrimp which ups the specialness, but any would do.

I just finished making the sauce for this recipe and it is HOT!!!!! I actually went back and checked to make sure that the recipe called for 1 1/2 T of Hot Sauce and not 1 1/2 t of Hot Sauce, but I did get it right!!!! I think that it will mellow out a bit once it is on the shrimp and grilled. Anyone who has made this before, any suggestions on that? I don't want to add more Ketchup just yet b/c I do think that the sauce will not be so hot once grilled. Thanks to everyone and I am excited to get these on the grill and in my belly!

Please get the shrimp facts, globally the size is usually for the whole shrimp in pieces per kg. everything else is to confuse you! Now what are shrimp? There are as many different shrimp as there are cars with different, tastes, qualities etc. There are the wild caught and the farmed (some farmed taste like mud!) if you are interested in a consistent quality and species get a Black Tiger produced in in Thailand or Malaysia...I don't recommend Vannamei from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan or Indonesia,,,choose wisely but do find out what you are eating..

For crying out loud, people! The first item under 'Ingredients" is: "Honey-Ginger Barbecue Sauce." Click on the words "Honey-Ginger Barbecue Sauce."

When I opened this recipe it contained no information about the sauce!! I know how to grill shrimp but would like to have the ingredients for the sauce. Cannot review or make the recipe without this information.

Unless it's just been added, the sauce recipe is just above the shrimp recipe. It's a link, so just click on the name for the full recipe.

I have just read the ingredients for the shrimp with honey ginger barbecue sauce, but cannot find the recipe for the sauce. Is it just me or maybe the sauce is out of a bottle. The recipe does sound nice tho but would like a recipe for the sauce. PLEASE

What recipe? There is no recipe for the sauce yet ""Sauce can be made 3 days ahead and refrigerated once cooled. Reheat before proceeding." There must be something that I am missing. Looked at the "SHOPPING LIST" for possible clues to the sauce and all it refers to is a commercially produced bottle!!!! So basically this "recipe" only shows you how to cook shrimp if you want to put "sauce" on it. SERIOUSLY??

Seems like summertime brings out the neophytes when it comes to grilling. Shrimp on the Q should never be peeled! The shell keeps in the moisture and flavor! Use kitchen shears and zipperback the boys, devein and then marinate for 24 hours. I won't even get into how banal the dipping sauce is. Tabasco? What's for retro-desert kids, lime Jello infused with Kraft miniature marshmallows?

Did not care for the bbq sauce at first. However, once it was basted on the shrimp, it was pretty darned good! Very similar to a Thai sweet/sour sauce.

Uber delicious! My cocker spaniel likes things spicy, so I amped it up with an extra tbs of Dave's Insanity sauce and it was marvelous! I served it over pearled couscous, which is SO much better than yucky old brown rice!

Delicious!! My husband doesn't like much heat so I only used about 1 1/2 tsp of hot sauce and it was still terrific. I served it over brown rice which went great with the sauce.
