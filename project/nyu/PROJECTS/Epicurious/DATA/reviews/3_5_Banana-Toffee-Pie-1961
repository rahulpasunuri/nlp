I used a previously made pie crust, so I can't rate that, but the filling was very tasty, even without the banana liqueur.

Made this as a St. Paddy's Day dessert, it was excellent - four forks for the taste. My dough was soft when processed, and after 2 hours in the refrigerator was still not rollable, so I just patted it in the bottom and up the sides of a regular pie plate. It shrank a little when baked, but still worked out okay. Loved this crust and will use it as a base for other recipes. I preferred this toffee to the more traditional sweetened condensed milk in other recipes.

I make this regularly. It's fabulous. Yes, you may have to add a little more flour to make the dough more workable (all flours vary depending on origin, background humidity, etc. so just like when making bread, you have to watch what's going on for this one). It's not much work in any case, as it's mainly done in a food processor. It beats the heck out of ready made pie-crusts! (And let's be honest, using ready made crusts is not really cooking is it? That would be more like pie assembly....). Once mastered, this crust is great for all sorts of other fillings too (e.g. pears).

The usual banoffee pie is different...Use a shortcrust pastry, cover with caramel made from two cans of condensed milk boiled in the cans for three hours in a pot of water (be sure the water doesn't boil dry!) slice bananas over the caramel and top with whipped creme flavored with a teaspoon of instant coffee and a dessertspoon of icing sugar...(add bananas etc. just before serving) Delicious!! There are whole websites devoted to this one dessert.

I doubled the topping so it would cover better, but had a terrible time with the crust. I added probably another cup of flour to make it stiff enough to work with. Otherwise, it was way too soft to go up the sides of the tart pan.

Whilst this pie tasted good it was too time consuming for the end result. You could achieve something similar by sprinkling cinnamon over a purchased frozen pie case before baking and then covering the banana with caramelized condensed milk.

I had looked for a recipe like this since having a decadent slice at a restaurant in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. My version was more shallow than the one in England, but the taste was great. I think I'll either make more filling or use a smaller diameter or tart style pan next time. Beware, though, that your liquor store will probably only have the one liter banana liquor available. You'll need other recipes to use it!
