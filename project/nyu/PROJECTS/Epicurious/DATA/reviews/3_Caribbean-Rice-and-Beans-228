Everyone loved this rice, authentic Caribbean or not! Served with Jamaican Jerk Burgers with Orange Chipotle Mayo. Used 1.25 C rice, after bringing everything to a boil, I transferred everything to a covered casserole dish and cooked in a 350 degree oven for 40min. Didn't have to watch. Marinated the beans and onions for a couple of hours so didn't have to mess with while my guests were here. Tasted excellent. Will def. make again.

I live right in the heart of the caribbean, Dominican Republic, this ingredients are not local, it looks more like a risotto.

This is not caribbean tasting in the least. Raw onions are not great and the use of balsamic and arborio rice make it seem more Italian than anything else. Though edible, wouldn't make it again.

Made this to go with Jamaican Jerk Chicken. Added 1 chopped and seeded tomato and 1 can drained black beans when rice was done. Served with lime wedges and my 3 sons loved it! Definitely a keeper with these additions. Some green pepper sauted with the onion would have added some extra color.

Man, this rice was friggn' fantastic! I did make some changes. I don't love onion, so I only use 1 red one(half for the bean onion mixture and half to cook with the rice). I also used regular brown rice. I had no problem finding the Arborio rice at the grocery store, but brown rice is a bit healthier so I subbed it for that reason. I don't think the different rice affected the flavor much because it was still really good. I also added double the amount of cayenne pepper because I like stuff a little extra spicy. And I didn't chop the garlic, I just cooked the garlic cloves with the rice and took them out at the end because I was pressed for time. It probably would have been better chopped up in there. I made this for my parents. They both loved it too.

I don't often review recipes because I don't often make them as written, but this one was getting so many mixed reviews I wanted to speak up for it. The flavors are wonderful together - I marinated the beans & onions in balsamic for about an hour. The acid in the vinegar will take some bite off the onions if you give it time - and I only used 1/4 of the red onion & felt it is still a little onion heavy. I also used 1/2 a bullion cube that was left over from a previous recipe - it gave more flavor (salt) to the rice. The end result was savory rice, sweet & tangy beans, with the bite of the onion. Fun mouth party.

Very good. Read all reviews and followed recipe. Only problem is that kids most likely won't like it. Would definately make again and I am sending recipe to friend who loved the dish.

I combined the onions and black beans without the balsamic and used a medium grain spanish rice to avoid the mushiness others complained about. It came out great that way. I found it to be a tad expensive because there were so many ingredients, but it reheated well for days after and everyone enjoyed it. Although I will say, once it's done, don't leave it on the stove to keep warm. I found it dried up a bit, so I had to place some of it I was serving into a smaller sauce pan and add some liquid to heat it up.

I've made this several times now since finding the recipe. It's so easy and quite delicious.

Hopefully most folks picked up on this, but I would caution those who didn't against using the recipe verbatim as a vegetarian entree - you would need to use vegetable broth instead of chicken. I'm sure most people know this, but for those who don't and would serve it to vegetarian guests as written, your guests will go home with an upset stomach.

didnt love it - have much better recipes for rice & beans

I used this as side dishes to a Cuban chicken dish which had a cilantro flavor. I added cilantro flavored olive oil to the beans, and it pulled the whole dish together (but added fat).

This is one of our family favorites. The balsamic vinegar is a little bit much for the kids, but adults just love it! I have made a few variations (replacing onion types and more or less seasonings) and every time is it awesome!

This was good, but not great enough to repeat. If we did make it again, we would use sweet onion instead of red. Also, 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar is too much when using high quality balsamic vinegar. The rice part wasn't as tasty as expected from a Caribbean dish.

I was very disappointed with this. I was hoping for more flavor in the rice, but it just isn't there. I will have to keep looking.

This dish tastes better without the balsamic vinegar. I did not use the red onions, instead I mixed the black beans into the rice after the rice was cooked.

I was disappointed by this dish. I have to agree with the readers who stated that the rice was too sloppy abd bland. I liked the beans/vinegar mixture, but the rice part could be improved.

I make this dish regularly, though I only add half the onion (too much for me!). If you like this recipe, try Curried Rice, Beans and Vegetable Pilaf.

This dish was really disappointing. The rice tasted like one of those packaged rice mixes, and there are just too many onions in this. I'll keep looking for a good black beans and rice recipe.

This is that dish that all of my friends beg me to make again and again. It isn't a covered-dish get-together without it.

Very tasty! Will definitely make it again. Next time, however, I am going to reduce the amount of chicken stock to 2 1/2 cups. The rice turned out a bit mushy, and I like my arborio rice on the al dente side. But other than that, a very different and delicious rice dish.

Excellent. Very quick and easy. Wonderful taste. Everyone raved!!!

Wonderfully spicy. I too do not like raw onions so while the rice was cooking, I warmed/cooked on low the beans and onions. I served it with a side of melon. It got great reviews at the table!

I add 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon saffron threads to the rice and double the black beans. This was a wonderful accompaniment to jerk chicken.

Good. Tasty. The onion had too much crunch for my wife. I'd make it again, for me at any rate (she's not big on black beans, either, for some reason).

I made this dish to go along with marinated steak and it was perfect. I did cook the bean mixture which worked wonderfully and was so flavorful. We had guests that evening and they all went back for seconds... and then it was gone.

I don't like raw onion that much for I sauteed the onion and some red bell pepper in the vinegar. I also accidentally used orzo instead of the rice and the recipe turned out very well.

This dish wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best beans and rice dish I've ever had. I'd probably experiment with other dishes before I came back to this one.

This recipe was extremely simple to make. Really excellent on its own or as a side dish. I subsituted balsamic vineger with redwine vinegar and served it with honey garlic sausage. SO GOOD!

I've made this recipe a few times and I like it very much. When I serve it to guests, they are impressed, especially if I garnish it with fresh herbs. As well, I like it because all I have to remember to buy fresh is a red onion. I usually have all the other ingredients on hand. To the person who said that it didn't have much flavour: I've had that problem too, but I think it depends on how flavourful your chicken (or vegetable) broth is. I taste the broth before I put it in. Another thing that I've noticed is that the bean mixture is more than enough to go with the risotto. Sometimes I make the risotto twice in order to use up the bean mixture.

We did not care for this recipe at all - I didn't find that it was very flavorful.

Hate to disagree with everyone, but I thought this came out like slop. I couldn't really enjoy the taste, which was ok, cause the texture was so unappealing.

This dish really is delicious - and on my 30-minutes-or-less list. We like the crunch provided by the raw purple onion, but we let the onion-vinegar mixture sit in a warm oven while the rice is cooking so it doesn't cool off the final dish.

This was wonderful as a side dish with jerk chicken. I will make this again - and soon - as a fast, easy, and healthful main dish.

Of all the easy-to-make vegetarian recipes I have found on this site, this is my favorite (although I myself am not a vegetarian, I cook for one).

I thought this recipe was OK, not the raves others gave it. I should have used more cayenne pepper,and maybe some tabasco, because this was more bland than I'd expect from Caribbean food. But the texture was creamy, and the rice and beans were tasty, just no kick like I wanted.

This si a perennial favorite in our home. An addition authentic to Bajan (Barbados) tastes would be to add minced scotch bonnet peppers at the end of the cooking time, which we always do! Adding pidgeon peas or substituting them for the black beans also provides delicious variety. (Pidgeon Peas can be found in any ethnic section of most national supermarket chains.)

This is a good recipe. I made a couple of changes that might be worth trying. I used kidney beans instead of black and cooked the beans with the rice -- it blended the flavors nicely

Rating: 4
The beans are easy to prepare and taste good. A great contrast in taste with most other dishes (chicken, beef, etc.) What more could you ask for? However, I do prefer diced red onion vs. the suggested thinly sliced variety. The dish is just easier to eat that way. The arborio rice is awesome prepared as suggested - and preparation doesn't get any easier.

This dish is delicious. I changed only the method of cooking. I used a method for risotto which involves cooking in a 12 inch skillet or saute pan and adding the liquid 1 cup at a time starting with the wine. This method allows you to choose the amount of liquid left in the final dish for a creamier texture.
