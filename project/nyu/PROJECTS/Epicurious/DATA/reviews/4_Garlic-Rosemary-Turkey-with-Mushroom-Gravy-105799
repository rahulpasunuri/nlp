Needed a recipe for roast turkey without dairy or gluten. Adapted this one with only olive oil, and cornstarch for the gravy. It was fabulous. Gravy was best ever. Did cover breast tightly until last 45 minutes and it was brown all over.

This recipe is fantastic! I make this recipe every year, like most of the other reviewers. I do add one more step to this; I brine it using Alton Brown's brine recipe and then proceed as directed. Super moist, super delicious!

Like many other reviewers, I used this recipe every T-Giving since it was first published. Then, last year, I tried a different recipe. It was fine. In fact, it was pretty good, but it still didn't come close to this recipe. I've learned my lesson: This year for Thanksgiving, I'm going back to this recipe. I follow the steps to a tee, but I occasionally use more garlic and less mushrooms. However, I do believe that it is important to follow the steps carefully. The recipe perfects the basting and browning timing. I cannot say enough about the perfection of this recipe. Cheers and kudos and thanks to the people that developed it!

My best friend introduced this recipe to me a few years ago and I will never stop using it!! This is the BEST recipe, it is so full of flavor and the turkey is so tender. Yummmm!!

I too, have made this turkey and gravy every year since publication. People will say, no man - let's deep fry a turkey this year, or let's make it the way my *fill in relative* makes it... And every year, this turkey recipe comes out on top. It's moist, it's awesome, it's soooo flavorful, and you're bound to be the star of Thanksgiving with this recipe.

I've made this every year since publication and it's been a hit every year. I have occasionally replaced the chicken broth with either home made or store-bought turkey stock for deeper turkey flavor. A fat separator (such as my Oxxo) makes the task of gravy easier. I've used 160 degrees at the thickest part of the breast rather than 175 at the thigh to avoid drying it out. My carcass and leftover gravy usually gets stolen by my mother-in-law who uses them as the basis for a day-after soup. Because it is a lenghty recipe, I've made myself a check list onto which I can write start times for each phase of roasting/basting- just to keep it straight. I've also made this with a 15 lb bird and cut down each roasting phase accordingly with good success. I NEVER stuff a bird, but rather use turkey stock in making a cornbread or matzo farfel stuffing which I serve with the gravy here. The shmearing phase (garlic/butter/rosemary under and on top of the skin and in the cavity) can be done the night before. I've used pre-brined (i.e. Butterball and Empire kosher) and home brined with equal success and can't tell the difference in the end with this potent recipe. What else... Oh yes: hide some meat before serving for sandwiches the next day, lest your guests steal the leftovers like mine do every year!

I used this recipe the year it came out in Bon Appetit and have used it every year since. I have made some slight revisions to it every year and LOVE it.

This is the best turkey recipe I've ever made! It has become a X'mas favorite.

I use a Kosher fresh kill turkey which I baste the night before spreading the garlic rosemary paste between the meat and the skin.I also stuff the turkey with a very moist dressing filled with dried apricots and cranberries. The gravy loaded with muchrooms is superb. The only trick for me is to foil-tent during part of the cooking so the skin does not get too dark nor the meat dried out. All of the various flavors somehow compliment when combined on one plate!

This is the only recipe I will use for the Thanksgiving turkey. I've tried many others, but this recipe delivers a moist, perfectly browned, wonderfully flavored bird every time. Don't be afraid to play - I use double the garlic (yum) and half the mushrooms.

Very good flavor. Cook to 160 degrees, otherwise may be a little dry.

I lost my copy of Gourmet /november 2002 and have been searching for this recipe ever since. My whole family loves this gravy and the turkey is very moist. I even passed it on to my mom!! She tried it and loves it too.

I have made this dish many, many times and have enjoyed it every time. Family and friends request "my" gravy at gatherings. I have used bottled roasted garlic as a time saver and have even made the gravy without the bird. All variations are fabulous.

turkey came out very dry and could have benefitted from some salt and pepper before being put in the oven. The gravy was delicious however

Excellent!! The only ingredient I left out was the mushrooms. The turkey came out very moist, and the gravy was delicious enough to cover over everything.

This was the best, most moist turkey that I have ever made! Everyone absolutely loved it. I don't know whether it was because of the garlic paste being rubbed directly on the meat, or because I used a new leave-in thermometer and took the bird out when the legs hit 170 (which was almost 45 minutes sooner than the recipe said for an 18 pound turkey). Either way, everyone at Thanksgiving loved it - even the kids! The gravy is wonderful - let it thicken awhile to gel the flavors.

I made my first turkey for Thanksgiving last year. Needless to say, I was nervous at the prospect of preparing a full meal for more than 30 people. I used this recipe (with a few changes) and my turkey came out perfect! Everyone raved about it for days afterwards. I'm planning on using this recipe again for Thanksgiving this year.

I've made the garlic rosemary turkey each time it's been my turn to have Thanksgiving at my home. One year another family member roasted their own turkey and brought it to my house- Theirs virtually went untouched while mine was devoured! I double the recipie because we require a 22-25lb turkey. IT'S DELISH! I've also used the garlic rosemary paste when I roast chicken as well. Unfortunately, we haven't added the mushrooms to the gravy because the kids turn their noses up at the mention of mushrooms.

When i applied the garlic paste to the bird, i lifted the skin from the carcass and rubbed the paste under there in this manner.This really added the flavor that i was looking for as well as made the skin brown and crispy. Was a huge hit!

While this turkey turned out well at Thanksgiving, it was not the star that I was expecting. The flavor that I had anticipated from the garlic paste just did not permeate the turkey and there just seemed to be something lacking in its overall flavor. While our holiday dinner was well received by all, I won't be making this again.

While my 28 pound turkey turned out to be wonderfully moist, I was a little disappointed in the overall flavor. I thought for sure the garlic rosemary paste would have permeated the entire bird and infused that combo of flavors throughout it (And yes, I did increase all ingredients proportionately in the garlic paste recipe). It was still very good, but I'll probably try a different recipe next time--either that or add 10-12 more cloves of garlic!

This was a delicious, flavorful turkey. It was easier to make than anticipated. I almost didn't make the gravy, but I'm glad I did because it was WONDERFUL!! It really makes the dish complete. The family loved it. I would definately make it again.

This turkey was really good overall, it smelled fantastic while it was cooking. The only thing I would change is that we basted it more often than the recipe recommended-more like every half an hour. The turkey still ended up a bit dry, so if we had only basted it once an hour, it would have been really dry I think. For the gravy we used corn flour instead or normal flour as a lot of the guests were allergic to wheat and it was fine.We also added additional white wine to the gravy while we were cooking it which made a delicious difference.

I hate to be the one dissenting reviewer, but I didn't care too much for this recipe. The garlic and rosemary combination did flavor the bird, but I think this flavor could have been obtained simply putting rosemary sprigs and whole garlic cloves in the bottom of the pan. The garlic smeared on the bird left residue on the skin, so the browning wasn't as even, and the turkey did not have the beautiful smooth mahogany skin color. Also, making the garlic rosemary paste was a bit more time consuming than I had expected. Next year I think I will try one of the recipes where the turkey is brined for flavor and cook it in the traditional way

This turkey was so moist! The garlic really permeated the meat, which I didn't really expect it to do.I had a 23 lb. stuffed turkey and it cooked very quickly - it was done in a little more than 4 hours. Delicious recipe.

Excellent!! This was my 1st turkey, and it came out moist and very tasty. My only complaint: the gravy was a challenge, but maybe that's because it was my first time. I managed to pull it off, but was left with enough gravy for an army when done. Next time, I'll scale back the quantities.

Very moist and flavorful "Italian" twist to turkey. Loved the addition of mushrooms to gravy. Didn't stuff this bird, but never missed it. Placing the paste under the skin was key to the overall flavor and juicey meat.

The basting process and garlic rosemary butter rub down made this turkey so tender and tasty,the traditional holiday turkey roasters all wanted to know the recipe and how to prepare it themselves. Excellent and of course, I was the chef of the holiday.

The turkey and gravy was the best we had ever made. The turkey was extrememly moist but we had also covered it throughout the cooking process. The ingredients were a perfect compliment to both the turkey and the gravy. The dijon mustard and wine gave it a special flavor. We will be making this again next Thanksgiving. We plan on trying this recipe on a whole chicken next.

We had friends over for Thanksgiving and I beat their mother's turkey hands-down! I didn't do the mushroom gravy but used the wine & broth as a base for my gravy. The turkey had so much flavor my husband said it tasted like stuffing! This one is going in my Thanksgiving menu every year.

Yes! What a fantastic bird this made. We grilled ours on the Webber over indirect heat. Brined it overnight and therefore left the salt out of the paste mixture. No basting was required and the turkey had wonderful flavor and the meat was extremely moist. Simmered the neck and other parts with veggies in 1 c wine and broth each, then used more wine and broth to make the gravy (more since I didn't have drippings and broth from the bird). The gravy was very good, but not nearly as stellar as the bird. Perhaps this was the result of our cooking method and the lost drippings. A+ to turkey, B+ to gravy.

Wow, what a stunner. I think this bird set my relatives on a new level of expectations for future Thanksgivings. My first turkey and this was the magic recipe. Tips, I covered the breast with foil during the first 3/4 of the cooking time. I stuffed the cavity with about 15 large fresh sage leaves. I basted every 40 min and reduced the heat to 325 as my oven runs a little hot. 10lb fresh turkey took 4 hours. It was really moist and very tasty. Nothing like Mom used to dry to a crisp:-) I needed lots of extra broth for the dressing and the gravy was very good and I did not use 6 cups more like 4.

My diners agreed that this was the best turkey I've cooked and voted that it become the standard for Thanksgivings to come. It was moist and flavorful. I did have to make some minor adjustments--6 garlic bulbs were not enough (it took 9 to make 1 cup); the turkey was done about 40 minutes sooner than expected. The results were great, though, and the gravy delicious. We will have this one again.
