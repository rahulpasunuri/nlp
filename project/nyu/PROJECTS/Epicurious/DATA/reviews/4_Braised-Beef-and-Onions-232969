Really, really good! The first time I made this I salted and seared then rubbed. It was very good, but we noticed when we re-heated as leftovers it was too salty. So I omitted the pre-salt and still seared then rubbed. The second time was less salty, but watch how much you use in the rub (next time I plan on cutting the salt by 25%). Also, make sure you keep the foil tight. Don't worry: plenty of moisture w/o adding any.

I actually did this in the slow cooker -- delicious flavors and no loss of liquids. I then kept the flavorings and made it with pinto beans for my vegetarian: superb! http://omnivorevegetarian.blogspot.com/2012/11/braised-pinto-beans-and-onions.html

I Love this recipes, though prefer to drop the temp to 350 and increase the time. I now add half a cup of red wine at the mid-cooking time...and then make the gravy using another big slosh of red wine, pepper and beef stock. I purée half the cooked onions and add to the gravy, saving the other half to dress meat as I serve. I serve with roasted new potatoes and carrot soup...this is a perfect winter meal!! I crave it!

The recipe as it is written is 4 forks. I completed it and tasted it. It was delicious. Very simple. I used foil and the cover of my dutch oven. I served it with noodles. Next time I will experiment with Vidalia or some other sweet onion. I may attempt it with the slow cooker.

This was extremely easy and extremely flavorful ... but ... when I checked the roast in the oven it looked like there was plenty of liquid left. When I removed it from the oven I realized that most of the liquid was fat, and very little broth. Even trying to take out most of the fat it ended up tasting greasy. The flavors were excellent, but the greasy feeling wasn't pleasant.

I love this recipe. So easy and delicious. People who get a dry result are probably not sealing properly and/or skimping on onions? I also use a le creuset pot and for extra measure I put parchment paper down on the surface of the meat.

Rating: 3
wow, this was really easy to make. I was going to cook this in my Le Creuset but the 2 pot roasts wouldn't have fit side by side/flat. So I used a relatively shallow roasting pan for the job. My oven's temperamental so the heat didn't reach as high as the recipe recommended but I cooked it at approximately 350F for 2 1/2 hours. The next day, it was tender and juicy, even when reheated over the stove. For lunch, I nuked it and it's pretty darn good. The only change I made to the ingredients is I doubled the # of garlic cloves and because I have lots of fresh tender ginger, I grated 3 small knobs which added to the aroma and flavor of the juices.

After much consideration (seemed bland), I decided to give this easy beef a try. To my surprise, it was delicious and easy! Followed it to a T and it was very tasty. I served it over buttered egg noodles and it was warm and filling for a freezing Sunday night. I totally suggest giving this beef a chance.

We were snowed in and the cupboard was getting bare... found this recipe and thought it would work for the frozen chuck I got on sale a month ago. With only 4 main ingredients, I wasn't expecting delicious, just palatable. Was I ever surprised! I made it exactly according to the recipe using ground allspice and served it with good old mashed potatoes. It was absolutely delicious, tender, juicy...good enough for a meal with good friends. The foil covering kept the moisture in and the meat nearly fell apart. I gave it an extra fork for ease of preparation.

You can't dry braise any meat at 400. Low and slow is the way to go. Youll also get a lot more flavor if you sear the beef on all sides to a nice color before "roasting it"

Rating: 4
This really IS exceptional, and I've made it many times. I use flatiron roast when I can get it, and if not, some flatiron steaks, stacked. I've always used just allspice (plus salt and pepper). I set the oven at 325-350; at 400, the onions and even the meat can burn, as others have mentioned. I use a pot just large enough to contain the meat. I usually serve it over a bed of noodles. EVeryone, including three-year-old grandchildren, loves this. For teenagers? Double the recipe!

extremely easy to make and very tasty. was skeptical about keeping the meat moist without adding any liquid before, but as other reviews stated, the onions release a lot of liquid and keep the meat amazingly tender. will definitely make again!

I love you, Braised Beef and Onions. I love how easy you are to make. I love how you make my house smell. I love how you've turned out perfectly all 4 times I've made you in the past 6 months. I love how you, Beef, are able to maintain your shape for presentation purposes and yet fall apart so tenderly and melt in the mouth. And Onion, I love how easy it is to make you caramel-y if you haven't already kind of done so in the pan I've used in the oven. Sure, it requires a skillet and an additional 5 minutes of time, but you were so easy to begin with, whatever. Onions, you then become this awesome jammy stuff to smear on Beef instead of needing any sort of gravy. I've always made an amazing pot roast on top of the stove, but now...because of you, Braised Beef and Onions, I have conquored my fear of cooking meat inside the stove. I know now it won't always be dry and tasteless (see,Mother?). Love, Me.

Rating: 4
This may be the single greatest recipe in human history. It really does take less than 15 minutes, and in my dutch oven produces nearly disintegrating heaps of beefy deliciousness. I will absolutely make this again. The only changes I made were to halve the recipe, to use the 4-spice rub advised below, and to toss in maybe a 1/4 lb of quartered mushrooms along with the onions.

Rating: 4
I was dubious that this was a "braised" dish since it calls for no added liquid. However, the onions give up tons of moisture so indeed, the finished dish had about a 1/2 inch of liquid in my 7 quart brasier. I used the le crueset with tinfoil as well and it made a tight seal keeping all the moisture in. The results were absolutely scrumptious and incredibly simple. Perfect for a chilly fall night and goes well with the leftover Syrah to drink.

Just OK. Meat was a little "wierd" tasting. Not going in my "keep" box.

Rating: 4
Fantastic recipe! I had no problem with juices drying up but my pan was sealed very well. I added baby bella (aka cremini) mushrooms to ensure extra juice (and because I like them). I chose to use 5 mushrooms per person and there were none leftover. I was worried the mushrooms might change the taste. I don't think they did, but if they did, it was for the better. This type of roast shrinks a lot so you may want to get a little more than 4# for 8 people. And a 1 1/2" thick chuck roast probably weighs less than two pounds so you may need to buy more than 2 to get the weight you want. I used proportionately more onions when I increased the amount of meat, just to ensure enough juice and to maintain the flavor balance. I used quatre epices recipe (instead of allspice) that included cloves, ginger, nutmeg, white peppercorns and added the optional cinnamon (which actually became a total of 5 spices). I was stunned that my guests absolutely gobbled this up--most had 2 helpings, which is very unusual for this group! I would NOT recommend cooking it early and reheating. The leftovers (very small amount!) the next day were good but nowhere near as tasty as the first day. I did, however, put it into the pan a couple hours early on the day of the dinner party figuring it wouldn't hurt for the cold meat to come closer to room temperature before cooking. Also, for mine, 2 1/2 hours cooking time wasn't enough. I cooked it almost 3 1/2 hours and it was absolutely perfect, but I had increased the amount of meat so I had three pieces and one was in the middle, insulated a little by the other two pieces. If you do decide to increase the amount of meat, make sure they will fit in a single layer in your dutch oven. I was fortunate enough to have a large rectangular cast aluminum pan that held three roasts in a single row. DEFINITELY make this. It was WONDERFUL!!

Used a le creuset, so I didn't wrap in foil. It was very good. The onions were amazing and the fluid level was perfect. We will make this again as the flavor was so very good!

Used the epicurious recipe for the quatre-epices. The meat came out beautifully - the method is fantastic and easy. I think they key is to be certain that it's absolutely perfectly sealed tight. I'll definitely try this method of cooking with other spice combos. Also want to try browning the meat first sometime, too -- adds a step and a pan, but worth a try.

Rating: 4
Used onions and bella mushrooms. Plenty of juices at one hour cooking time but too dried out after second hour. Like others, I found this does not need the full time to cook. The quatre epices recipe from About.com had too much white pepper. All the above said, the beef was still delicious. I will try this recipe several times until I get it right!

Wonderful. The allspice is brilliant. I prepared it exactly as the recipe instructed (except for the actual cooking vessel part) and served it to guests, who raved. I just got an Emile Henry brazier, and it worked. No foil necessary. No extra liquid necessary. Just great.

I made some changes, but it was delicious. I used 2 lbs of beef instead of 4, browned the meat first, and added 2 bottles of beer (newcastle) I had on hand. I also used an enameled dutch oven instead of a roasting pan. The beer was just the right amount of liquid for my taste.

Checked liquid at 1 and 2 hour marks, added 1 cup hot beef stock at two hours, which reduced down perfectly in the next 20-30 minutes. Served with glazed carrots, plain steamed potatoes. A new fave!

This recipe is a keeper. I used the quatre epices recipe from about.com. I used more than two teaspoons each of the spice and salt--probably ended up using about three and a half teaspoons of each to completely cover the roast. I rubbed it in to every nook and cranny. The aroma while this cooked was so seductive we could hardly wait to the two-and-a-quarter hours it took to cook. The beef turned a beautiful mahagony color and was fork-shreddable, the onions were soft and sweet, and the spice flavor was ASTOUNDING. Allspice alone wouldn't have done it that well. It was addictive--I woke up this morning craving more.

I made this for someone who hates garlic and can just tolerate onions, so I had to leave out the garlic and cut the onions in half. I used the quatre epices recipe provided in another comment (thank you!!) and carrots to supplement the onions and it all came out wonderfully. I did use a 2 1/2 quart casserole (with lid) instead of a 13x9 inch pan, and between the lid and the heavy duty foil was able to retain enough liquid in the pan to spoon over the top when serving.

This recipe was easy but I had the drying-out problem as well. It was still good with homemade dumplings, but we poured 1/2 cup of beef stock over the whole thing to rehydrate it & give us some yummy juice to be soaked up. I'll find a pot raost recipe next time with some liquid added.

Well I found this recipe several years ago (not sure where) and it is my sorta defacto roast beef recipe. The Quatre Épices I have also used often and not really sure if I figured out because of this recipe or for some other reason and I love the way my kitchen smells. One of the things that I have learned about meat recipies on Epicurious is that they tend to use Prime beef. My suggestion is that if you are not using prime beef then always add some additional fat 1/4 cup to 2 lbs of beef, then I would suspect that the drying out issue would be solved.

My husband LOVED this!! I'm making for the second time tonight. The first attempt was perfect, though my roast was a little small at only 1.5lbs and the ends got a little dry. My rub was 2t cinnamon, 2t ginger, 2t white pepper, 2t nutmeg, 1t clove. Tonight I will cut down the clove to only 1/2 of a teaspoon, it was a bit strong last time. I used the leftover beef to make an AMAZING bolognese sauce for pasta the next day - what a flavor!!!

I meant to add an comment to my review (immediately below), do take the time to make the quatre epices, it has an incredible depth that I don't think you'll get from just using allspice, the combination adds alot of warmth to the meat and I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful your house is going to smell! Thanks to cameronz from Upstate South Carolina for the recipe. Here's his or her version: Quatre Épices: A French spice/seasoning mixture. INGREDIENTS: 2 tsp. cinnamon, 4 tsp. ground all spice, 1 tsp. ground cloves, 2 tsp. grated nutmeg, 4 tsp. ground coriander, PREPARATION: Mix all spices and store in a well sealed jar.

One of the best and most luxurioius pot roasts I've ever made or had. I always read reviews before I make a recipe and this time it really payed off. I made the recipe for the quatre épices another reviewer provided (thank you) and made the recipe exactly as directed, except that I cut it in half as I am single and couldn't possibly finish off 2 lbs of meat in a week. 1 1b meat 3 cups onions and 3 cloves garlic and half the spice required. Alot of people had a problem with moisture or the lack of. This must be sealed very well, I used a small Le Creuset dutch oven and sealed the top with foil and the lid and I had plenty of sauce at the end. I also cooked it @ 400 for 2 hours as suggested. This was excellent and truly worth making for guests.

I guess I'm not really reviewing THIS recipe, because I found made quatre epices from a combination of recipes I found on the internet. Just google "quatre epices recipes" and you will easily get one. Having said that, I followed all the rest of the directions, and it was fabulous. There is plenty of salt for my taste, so I recommend some plain steamed potatoes to mash with the juices. I used a double-covering of foil, b/c I don't have heavy duty foil, and I had PLENTY of liquid. I sealed it down very carefully, and resealed it when I turned the meat over. In a word, delicious.

I panicked when I unveiled the roast at hour 2 and saw nearly no juices and some burnt onion/garlic. But I sliced the roast thinly and set aside, then deglazed the pan with beef broth plus a little flour for gravy. Poured the gravy over the roast and was amazed that it saved the day! I think the roast has a very nice flavor, although I don't understand how it dried out--I used several layers of regular foil and thought the dish was well-sealed.

This recipe had amazing flavor. Initially the meat came out a little too tough, but I think it may have been because I used a ceramic dish for the braising instead of a traditional metal roasting pan. I also rushed the cooking process since it smelled so good. I also put the drippings in a blender with some beef stock and it made a creamy, onion gravy that was PERFECT! Will definately make this dish again.

Delicious, and so simple! The key is to make sure your pan is well-sealed with aluminum foil, otherwise everything would definitely dry out and burn, as it did for the cook in State College, PA. I didn't have heavy-duty foil, so I used several layers of regular foil and it worked perfectly. Since I had the ingredients handy, I made quatre epices powder using the about. com recipe. Was a little worried the kids would think the flavors were weird, but they loved it! This could become my new standard pot roast.

This made a real hit with my family of six(including two kids). Followed the recipe with these exceptions. I doubled it and cooked it in an AllClad Slow Cooker on high for 5 hours. Also threw in a stick of butter...was sure that 4 lb of dry beef and 3 lb of dry onions would need something to keep it from burning. However, when it was finished I had nearly a quart of juces so next time I will use just enough to coat the bottom of the cooker. Served it with seperately steamed Yukon Gold potatoes and carrots. I was a great comfort meal.

A roasting pan with a lip solves the problem of evaporation. If the foil isn't wide enough, use two pieces of foil and fold them together in the middle and be careful not to tear the foil when you turn the meat over. This recipe tastes great with any combination of spices. Every time I've added carrots it's produced fewer juices. When it's done I reserve half the onions and blend (hand wand) the rest in the juices to make a thicker, easier and somewhat healthier gravy.

Rating: 4
Picky child even ate it. I made it without the allspice and cooked it in a la crueset dutch oven on the stove top. It took all of an hour and a half to reach fork tender. I used the chuck and braised the meat with the broth and a cup of nice porter (beer). It was fabulous and the best I have had.

I've made this twice and it's great for a dinner party. Like others, I found that this cooked much faster than the recipe suggested - mine was done in about 2 hours. Following the suggestions here, I sliced the onions paper thin; when the beef was done, I put it in another pan and drained the onions; the drippings made a fantastic sauce. One big bonus: this recipe makes the house smell great and sets the mood for a great dinner.

Braising is searing the outside surfaces of the meat to seal in the flavors, partially submerging it in liquid in a sealed pot and then cooking it until fork-tender (partial quote from Cook's Illustrated). Best done in a dutch oven. The secret to pot roast is to make sure the internal temp. of the meat remains at 210 degrees for a min. of 1 hour so that the connective tissue dissolves - reducing the temp or time because your roast is tough will not fix the problem but actually make it worse.

Rating: 4
This ws delicious and utterly simple. Next time I wouldn't use as much salt. I couldn't believe how much juice this roast made on its own and it didn't burn in the pan like I was worried it might since there were no added cooking liquids. Its true, you could cut it with a fork when it was done.

No knife neccessary - this meat was absolutely delicious, paired with "Upscale Macaroni & Cheese" recipe on this site. Stuck faithfully to the recipe as I do not cook meet often.

This is wonderful...true comfort food. Made it several times; as an alternative I've added about 2-3 cups of red wine at the very end and cooked it down (I removed the beef before doing so) and it maked a wonderful sauce. Serve with gnocchi, dumplings or mashed potatoes. Also, thought the allspice was a bit too much for my taste.

Rating: 3
Let me preface this with, I am a hack in the kitchen. I had no idea what it was to braise, and when it said to cook in liquid, I couldn't figure out how it played into this recipe. So I looked at several other recipes. I finally used 2 onions,(all I had) and then I used 1 cup of Black Butte beer and 1 cup water. I cooked it in a cast iron skillet covered with foil, and my wife said it was the best thing I ever cooked on my charcoal grill.

Rating: 4
This was delicious! It was fork-tender and had a great flavor. I used one roast and halved the recipe, and it was perfectly done after 1 1/2 hours at 400. Covered with both foil and a lid. I added about 1 cup of beef broth, which turned out to be too much because the onions released so much liquid. Next time I may saute the onions first as they were a little soggy (but this may have been because I added the liquid).

Rating: 4
This couldn't have been any easier, and compares well to traditional braised pot roast. I had at least three cups of liquid at the end of the cooking time which made great gravy. I had an ideal pan for sealing: it had a lip that the foil crimped around tightly. I would encourage a relatively thin slice for the onions. This encourages them to readily give up their juices to promote good braising.

Rating: 4
I believe Braising means to cook the meat in liquid. Like one would make Osso Bucco. I really loved this. Made it in advance and chilled it...sliced it while it was cold...wrapped it and brought it to a luncheon. After it was heated it was a pleasure to serve. No fuss/no mess. Served it over a bed of egg noodles, a lovely bottle of Merlot and feasted. Wonderful!

I sliced the onions paper-thin with a mandoline & used jarred minced garlic (all I had on hand). I was out of heavy duty foil, so I used two layers of regular foil. The meat was finished cooking after two hours, so I re-covered it & returned to the oven at 300 until it was time to eat (about another hour). It was fall-off-the-bone tender. Delicious flavor!

I just made the recipe, and it was absolutely delicious. I used half the quantity of meat, but I kept the full amount of onions, to keep it moist. It was cooked in two hours and the meat was perfectly tender. I cooked it in a very heavy Creuset pot, which probably is ideal to keep the meat moist. There was not much juice left in the pan, so I deglazed the pan with a little white wine, some beef broth, and a spoonfull of butter at the end, and it was just perfect. I served it with the roasted rosemary potatoes in the same issue, which were also delicious. I will certainly make this recipe again.

This smelled wonderful, and tasted good; I don't want to rate it until I've figured out how not to overcook the onions and juices. The meat was tender following the recommended temperature (400º) and time (2 1/2 hours), but there were only scant juices left in the pan. I used only one chuck roast (it looked like the photo and weighed less than 2 lbs.), and cut all other ingrediants in half. Could this reduction in quantity cause the over-reduction of juices? Or is the oven temperature too high? I used a 9" square Pyrex pan and sealed it very tightly with heavy-duty aluminum foil.

I think the key to this recipe is the foil. I made it twice and only when I tightly sealed the pan the second time did I have any substantial juices left. And its definitely better after two days. It was a big hit.

I think it would be a great dish at a lower temperature. After two hours at 400, the pan juices evaporated and the onions were burned.

The cooking temp. for this recipe is too high. I cooked it for half the time and the meat was still tough.

Easy, quick, delicious. My husband raved, "This is the best pot roast I've ever tasted!" The key ingredient is the meat. I showed the picture in Gourmet to the butcher so I was sure to buy the right cut.
