I used this recipe with the cannelloni and we thought it was fabulous. The consistency was nice and thick and the flavor wonderful. Quite easy to make if you have a food processor.

You should use this recipe as a place to start. I added some dried crushed red pepper flakes, fresh thyme, and fresh chopped, peeled, & seeded tomatoes and simmered it for an hour. It turned out great!

You know, sometimes it's just as good to nuke a bottle of Ragu. bada bing adda some vino , sour dough bread the music, lights. Use this sauce as you would tomatos. Great in soups. As for the origin of the name: Edgar Winter had a mother. She cooked. aight? Enjoy. ps Rice hint: Use day old rice for screaming house fried rice, no lie.

Did not find anything special about this sauce. It did not taste very good. Why is it called winter?
