I'd give this recipe 3 1/2 forks, it was really great. I added fresh basil and a splash of balsamic and used double the corn. It's SOOOO easy and like someone else said, a fabulous way to use up leftovers!! Wonderful topped with some aged asiago too.

We made this as a "clean-out-the-fridge" recipe, using 3 ears of leftover sweet corn, 2 tomatoes from the garden, and sauteed 1/2 of a leftover onion and 1/2 bell pepper. Tossed the veggies with the dressing, added the pasta, and leftover sliced fresh mozzarella. What a way to make leftovers taste great!

Great, even better with the addition of arugula to the pasta/vegetable mixture, and topped with fresh parmesan.

I really enjoyed this dish. I roasted fresh corn and added tomatos from the farmer's market. I also roasted some yellow peppers and added cayenne pepper and fig balsamic vinegar for more flavor. very refreshing!

A nice, fresh summer recipe. I added some crumbled bacon at the end. It was a nice touch.

Really liked this recipe. The flavors right now in June are DELICIOUS. Very easy, and you don't end up with extras of any ingredients. I used balsamic instead of red wine, and let the tomatoes marinate in it for awhile. Will throw in a clove or two of garlic next time.

I liked the fresh taste in this dish, but I would definately add more flavor. I added roasted yellow bell peppers, and next time I would add fresh basil or cilantro. Some fresh cheese like feta or mozzarella would also be good.

Completely refreshing. Splurge on some nice red round organic hothouse tomatoes... it's worth it.
