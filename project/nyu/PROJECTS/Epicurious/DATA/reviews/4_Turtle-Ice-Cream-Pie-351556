I used Dulce de Leche ice cream and an 8" springform pan-perfect! I drizzled the remaining caramel over each piece when I served it, and topped each with a sprinkle of sea salt flakes--put it WAY over the top!

This pie is A LOT of work but it is a show stopper. The crust, the caramel, the whole thing. For some reason, I always seem to need to make more crust than recipes call for - and this one is no exception. I suggest increasing the graham crackers and butter by a third. This resulted in a thick, cookie-like crust

This was such a hit! We had friends over to watch football and they raved about this dessert. I used a springform pan as someone suggested and it came out perfectly. I also used Breyer's light butter pecan ice cream and it was just right.

Really great pie, though it seemed like the ice cream overwhelmed the caramel a bit (the caramel was the best part!). Do take care to make it in advance, with 24 hours to freeze - I didn't, and it was sloppy. I used my springform pan, as someone recommended (mostly because my favorite pie tin was still at our friends' house). The steep sides meant the crust fell in on itself - I pushed it back up while still hot & soft and it seemed to work fine. It also made it more difficult to serve. I also used fewer layers as I was in a rush (lack of planning!). Seemed fine. Overall, great pie. I'd definitely make again, but I'll stick to a pie dish.

This really is delicious. Every part of it, and the recipe got great reviews from my guests. Why only three forks? Mainly, it's just a tremendous pain. The layering is time consuming and is more complex than it seems. Also, to those who argue for more ice cream, that may be fine, but then the ganache overflows. But at the end of the day, it's a good tasting ice cream pie.

Although somewhat time consuming, this is an easy and tasty recipe.

The first bite of this dessert was absolutely delicious, but I thought it was way too sweet and I was full after two bites. I even forgot to put sugar in the crust (which I thought was the best part!)and it was still super sweet. Other than adjusting the sweetness, the flavors were incredible, and the desert was very easy to make, just time consuming as the other reviews said.

Made this for Christmas dinner dessert & received absolutely rave reviews from everybody. There really aren't any time constraints on this dessert, you can stop at any point if necessary.I used Breyer's Butter Pecan instead of vanilla ice cream. The ganache is yummy and could actually be added between the ice cream layers as well. I used a spring form pan and serving it was extremely easy. First and last pieces were perfect. This is an extremely easy and delicious dessert.

If 5 forks were possible, I would give this recipe 5! Forget normal pecan pie for Thanksgiving, we had this and it was a HUGE HIT. Suggestion: make it in a round Springform pan. It makes it super easy to cut and serve and possible to make the layers thicker than if it were in a normal pie plate.

This is one of the BEST things I've ever made !! There was not a bite left..friends absolutely loved it ! I followed the recipe - except for I did forget to toast the pecans ...it was sinfully good !

It takes a long time but its worth it. Its mostly inactive prep time. I add a little more salt in the caramel to offset the sweetness. I've made it twice and everyone loves it. The second time I made it I didn't let the layers set and they all melted together, but it still tasted good!

Didn't come out as pretty as the photo (does anything?) but everyone loved this dish. Would definitely make it again!

Unbelievably decadent and delicious! I made this for a birthday barbeque and it disappeared in a flash. The warmed caramel sauce at the end tipped it over the edge to amazing.

This is wonderful. Every time I make this I get rave reviews. A little time consuming, but worth it.

As soon as I saw the title of this pie, I HAD to make it. And Im so so so glad that I did!!! What a treat. Everyone who tasted it raved about it. It looked so decadent and professional, I was beyond pleased with the result. It takes a while to make, but it is SO worth it.

I made this one for my own birthday, and it exceeded my expectations! I made a few changes, though; I made my own ice cream with the raw milk we get from our dairy, used Rapadura sugar when it called for sugar, and used maple syrup when it called for corn syrup. It tasted amazing! I will make this again soon. Make sure you plan on starting it at least two days ahead.

I've made this several times, it is always awesome!! After the first time, however, I decided against the layering process... I put the 3/4 cup caramel on the crust (after it had frozen for an hour), let that freeze for a couple hours, then put all the ice cream... let that freeze over night then continue with ganache as directed. Tastes the same, but I prefer the streamlined process!

Excellent and easy to make. I doubled the caramel so that I would have extra for later. I did not thoroughly read the directions before starting thus, did not realize I should freeze overnight. After I froze the crust, I added ice cream and a thick layer of caramel and froze for a few hours. Then I added another layer of ice cream. Once it was frozen, I put on the chopped pecans and did a heavy drizzle of ganache. Turned out great.

Fabulous! I think next time I will make it with coffee ice cream.

This pie was SO good and SO easy! I used Haagen-Dazs Vanilla Bean ice cream. The carmel was heavenly. --I couldn't stay out of the pan!!!! I put 1/2 C of carmel between layers though. It was so good, I couldn't see limiting it to just 1/4 C. I will be making this over and over again!

Very good and very easy to make! Everyone really liked it. While there is some time involved due to the freezing of layers, the actual preparation of the crust, caramel, and chocolate is pretty quick. The caramel is very tasty! I also used a total of 1.5 quarts (6 c.) of ice cream, as I otherwise had a hard time making the ice cream layers that thin (and figured that a little extra ice cream is never bad. . .). I also used Breyer's Natural Vanilla Ice Cream.

I made pretty much as soon as I saw it in my Bon Apetit and it was a major HIT. My neighbors, who are dessert crazy, couldn't get enough. The other reviewers are correct...the caramel is unreal. The only change I made, or addition I should say, is I sprinkled a bit of sea salt on top of the ganache before serving because I am IN LOVE with Fran's Sea Salt Caramels (dark of course!) so I thought that would be perfect. It WAS! Make this. It's a little time consuming with all the freezing between layers...so make sure you allow plenty of time for this. Great recipe.

We liked this very much. I used a 1.5 gallon container of ice cream, as it seemed to need more ice cream, and I used light corn syrup, as that is what I had. The carmel was so divine that I made a second batch (but that was mostly because we kept eating the first batch while waiting for the layers to freeze). The crust is particularly tasty as well. I will definitely make this again.

This tasted like I expected it to taste. All of the components came together in a rich, sweet, gooey good way. It takes a while to put together but is straightforward and tastes good.

This is a good frozen pie. The crust is one of the best graham cracker crusts I've seen. Don't skimp on the caramel, it easily gets lost in the ice cream.

I think I'm in love. The components in this are absolutely perfect. We almost ate all of the caramel right out of the pan and the ganache. I swear I could live on this. I used Breyer's all natural ice cream

This was fabulous! It takes a little time to assemble. I used more ice cream and caramel, making thicker layers and refroze between each layer-i.e. Ice Cream freeze 30 minute Caramel freeze 30 minutes and so forth. Plus I put nuts in with the caramel. Yummy!

super easy and very yommy. My guests raved!
