The taste was really lovely and lemony but they didn't rise as much as I would have liked and they could have had a smoother texture.

I've made lots of souffles and they've always come out perfect. Unfortunately, this was not one of them. Not sure what went wrong but they barely rose and then fell before the cooking time was over. Loved the flavor but missed the souffle texture.

I did something seriously wrong (maybe because I don't have a thermometer to make sure I was cooking at the right temperature) and the souffles never rose. Instead, after baking they came out similar to the base of a lemon meringue pie! Nevertheless, my husband thought they were good and said I should make the recipe again exactly the same way.

I followed this recipe exactly. It was too sweet, too lemony, too buttery. Very disappointed.

A nice change of pace from chocolate. Very lemony and tart. An elegant finish for a special dinner.

Simple and tasty. The first time I made this recipe I used orange juice instead of lemons. Makes for a gentler flavour taht is also very pleasant.

This was an elegant and easy dessert. Next time I'll grate the lemon peel instead of mincing it, and use a little less than the 2-1/2 teaspoons called for in the recipe.

A delicious and elegant dessert! I made this for guests and everyone loved it. I prepared the egg yolk portion ahead of time, had the ramekins all ready, and preheated the oven during dinner. After dinner I only had to whip the egg whites and fold them in, then bake the souffles. This is a very tart-sweet dish with lively flavors. It was too tart for my two-year-old, but that's okay -- for once I was able to have my dessert all to myself!
