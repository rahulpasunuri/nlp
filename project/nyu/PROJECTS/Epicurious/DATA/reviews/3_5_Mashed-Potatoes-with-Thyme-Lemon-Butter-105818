Great blend of flavors. Used less butter than the recipe called for; still rich and tasty.

A nice twist on mashed potatoes. Used lemon-thyme growing in my garden for an extra punch.

I made this for Christmas Dinner. I made the Thyme-Butter the day before. I was not expecting too much, but to my surprise, these mashed potatoes were very delicious. It was a pleasant change from the usual.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner. Everybody loved it! The lemon and thyme take some of the heaviness out of the potatoes. This recipe would go well with fish too.

Great change from regular potatoes. Served at an outdoor BBQ and they were refreshing on a summer night.

I served with rubbed ribs at an outdoor BBQ and they were a hit. A great change from regular potatoes.

Fantastic recipe. The flavor is subtle but complex and delicious. I served them with Beef Wellington and they complimented it perfectly. Several guests asked for the recipe. Does need a considerable amount of salt added.

I too was surprised with the lemon in this recipe and just had to try it. It was wonderful! I don't know about the rest of you but I whipped these potatoes in my mixer and had I used the whole 1-1/2 cups of half and half, I would have had soup. Making the butter thyme mixture ahead really helped putting the meal together in a timely manner.

My gang love mashed potatoes and I am always looking for variations. This one was terrific. I would never have guessed that the lemon would work so well. Served it with "Spice-rubbed chicken breasts with lemon-shallot sauce" and it went perfectly. Should have made double the recipe.

These potatoes are delicious! I made them for thanksgiving and they were a hit. The lemon is a nice surprise. I had to add an extra 1/4 cup of half and half, and while the lemon flavor is sufficient, I would add more thyme.

I made this for T-giving dinner this year. It wasn't bad, but I could barely notice the thyme and lemon, and I used plenty. Also, I needed to use a lot more than just 1 1/2 cups of half and half. I made the butter the day before, to make it easier on the big day, but next time I'll go back to my old standard mashed potatoes, made with milk and butter and salt and pepper, which everyone loves in our house and was a lot less work.
