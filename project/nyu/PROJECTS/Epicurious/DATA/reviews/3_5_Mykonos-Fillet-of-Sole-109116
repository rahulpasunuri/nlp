I have just started to cook more fish, and this recipe is one that has been added to our regular rotation. Very light and flavorful. I vary it depending on what's on hand, and have used Panko bread crumbs and varied the herbs. To save time, I also oven fry instead of pan fry, by drizzling olive oil over breaded fillets and baking in 500 degree oven for about 7 or 8 minutes.

A very tasty recipe. My Greek husband hasn't had this in Mykonos, but it was tasty. For some reason the breadcrumb mixture didnt stick so well but it still savoured all the fresh tastes of the ingredients. Thank you.

This was delicious! We licked the plate afterward and I wished I had made more. I added extra garlic and salt and a bit of minced rosemary to the bread crumbs mixture like people suggested and I used 1% milk because that was all I had on hand as well as panko bread crumbs. I highly recommend this!

This was easy, light and fresh-tasting. My kids gobbled it up as well. Definitely will make this again.

This fish looked beautifully golden with green flecks and was very moist. Next time I'm going to try substituting minced fresh rosemary and finely grated lemon peel for the parsley to boost the flavor to 4 forks. It was a little too delicately flavored for us but maybe it's because we eat fish 3 or 4 times a week.

This dish was incredible! I cannot believe some people thought this was flavorless. I love all fish and I thought this dish was perfect for lovers of fish and those starting out. The only thing I changed was tripling the garlic and parsley (I love using herbs and garlic). It was fantastic! I highly recommend it. It definitely has the Greek island flavor. So delicious!

I was very disappointed in this recipe (especially after buying really nice fish)... it was very bland and the coating did not stick well. I can see why people liked giving it to young kids, they like bland food.

I don't know what that other bloke did wrong, but I thought this was an amazing recipe. I had no problems with it at all. My boyfriend is not a fan of fish, and he loved it. I did find that the bread crumbs got clumpy as I coated the fish, so the last fillet was much more difficult to coat, but that's easily remedied by reserving half the crumbs and coating them in two batches. Such an easy recipe, and wonderful results.

What a disaster! The coating stuck to the pan, then the fish fell apart. It looked terrible and didn't taste that great either. It was very bland. I won't be making this again.

Fantastic! The whole family (incl. 2-year-old) gobbled it up. Definitely a keeper.

I made this with the smaller sole filets that are generally available and the coating was a little overwhelming for the small filets. If I could find meatier ones it might be better. the outside was nice and crisp and good flavor but the fish just got lost.

This dish was wonderful, especially since neither of us get too excited about fish. My husband made a reduction/gravy of the drippings, left-over marinade and some bread crumbs that went well with the sole and rice we served with it. This recipe is definately a keeper!

This was very good. Simple to prepare and had a nice taste. I didn't have parsley so I used cilantro, and that was a nice touch. I followed another suggestion and used dry vermouth instead of wine. I didn't read the recipe carefully enough and marinated the fish in the wine, lemons, and milk, but it was still yummy. This will become a regular feature.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic! I've used it for both sole and flounder with absolutely amazing, flavorful results. Even my bosses (I'm a nanny) liked it (the boy loved it, too, but he's not very picky). Marinating it longer (about an hour) seems to make it even better. I recommend fresh, curly parsley instead of the lighter tasting flat parsley. A definite regular addition. Serve it with mesclun salad and baguette slices.

This was an outstanding dish especially because it was so easy to prepare. I followed the recipe exactly but like a previous reviewer used talapia instead of sole. I think this would be excellent with any white fish. I served it with steamed asparagus and a lovely pomegranate and feta salad. My guests all went home with copies of the recipe!

This recipe is pretty good, fast and easy. The next time I make it I will increase the garlic, salt, pepper and parsley in the breadcrumb mixture.

I made a couple of changes...instead of Sole I used Talapia which I had in the freezer...instead of wine I used Tequila. It's a very basic yet delicious recipe.

Just so-so.

This is a delicious recipe by any standard but I would especially recommend it to parents trying to cultivate a taste for fish in their children. My 9 year old son raved about this one. I did skip the wine marinade as I was not convinced that it would improve the flavor. My fishmonger didn't have sole so I used Orange Roughy but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This recipe will be used over and over in our house.

This was so easy, and so GOOD. Used cognac instead of wine--I highly recommend doing this--I could lightly taste the cognac with each bite--it was wonderful. Used dried parsley and garlic, since that's all I had. It was so light and tasty for such a simple mix of ingredients. I will be trying out this recipe on various types of fish.

This was beautifully simple for something so delicious. I already had all the other ingredients, so all I needed to get was the fish. This could easily become our standard for busy days when we want fish.

This is just plain old GOOD. The only change I made (because I had it) was to add fresh oregano to the bread crumb mix and used Kosher salt instead of table salt. This dish would make a delightful light dinner in the middle of summer even though I made it "on a dark and stormy night" becasue we were tired of rich holiday fare.

This was incredible! My only changes were using 2% rather than whole milk (what I had on hand) and dry vermouth instead of white wine, because I didn't have an open bottle. Rather than keeping the fish warm in the oven, I just used two skillets and fried the fish simultaneously. My husband and I both loved the contrast of the crispy buttery breading and the moist, flaky fish inside. I served this with roasted baby potatoes with garlic, and blanched green beans with sour cream and thyme dressing. Fabulous and easy weeknight meal, but it was so good I'm definintely serving it to guests as well.

Pretty much followed the recipe, but did add about a 1/4 cup of crushed corn flakes to the bread crumb mixture for a bit of extra crunch. Also, served the fish right out of the skillet rather than keeping warm in the oven. Probably would have given this recipe a "3". After all, pretty hard to dress up flounder to "dish beyond compare" status. But, someone had to counter-balance the "1" assigned by a previous reviewer.

This was just the recipe I was looking for; so full of flavor. I will try next time making it with calamari instead.

I used Panko (Japanese) breadcrumbs and it turned out absolutely delicious. A perfect light dinner accompanied by steamed mixed green vegetables. Will do again.
