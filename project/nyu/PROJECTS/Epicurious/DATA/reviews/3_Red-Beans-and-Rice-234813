Made my own pinto beans from dried and used short grain brown rice. Also, I added a small can of diced tomatoes instead of paste. Cooked it all for about 40 minutes due to using short grain brown rice. Delicious...topped it with avocado, plain yogurt, and diced scallions.

This is a regular in our house. Really easy and delicious!

I reduced the amount of rice to 2 cups and it was the perfect consistency for rice and beans. I also added sausage and green chilies, but I thought it still lacked in flavor (although I only used regular paprika). Next time I'll add tomatoes, more beans and actual Spanish smoked paprika, if I can find it.

Have made this several times now. Made some modifications each time based on what I had around, but think the key is the Spanish Paprika! This is a keeper.

Hi - I made this for dinner last night and it was excellent; DH is still raving about it. I had two thoughts on the previous reviews (which were very helpful!). First, many reviewers said that spice, beans, and/or water was lacking, so I reduced the rice to 2 cups (instead of increasing everything else) and the proportions were perfect. Second, I think this may be a recipe where the quality/potency of the spices you use makes a huge difference. I was lucky enough to have hot smoked paprika and cumin from a specialty spice store on hand, and the dished turned out pretty spicy. I will definitely make this one again. :)

just made it - waste of time. I doubled the spices and added chili powder, cayenne pepper - still bland. I had to keep adding water to the rice as the recipe states not enough. 2 to 1 is the normal rule which I will now always follow. Also, I added a second can of kidney beans as one can just disappeared in the amount of rice. It wasn't after I added a bit of ketchup and liquid smoke,homemade creole seasoning and parsley, that this dish was edible. will not make it again.

Recipe worked fine after I almost douboled some of the spices as well as the amount of beans.

This is a delicious and simple recipe! Our guests loved it, and it held up great as a leftover for a few days.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I am a big fan of rice and beans alone or with meals such as fajitas! I made it with jasmine rice b/c I really like that type of rice and still turned out great! Will make again!

Really easy and tastes so much better than any mix we have ever tried.

I made this dish three times already. I also used the 1 to 2 ratio and it came out just right (not too soggy, not too dry). My boyfriend raved about it. Also, instead of the salt I used 1 chicken boullion cube and 1 envelope Goya "Sazon" with Coriander & Annato.

I agree that this dish was a bit dry,I added one whole link of smoked sauage, cut up, extra cumin and paprika. Came out pretty good.As mentioned I will stick to the old standby of 2 to 1 rice and water. Over all every one liked it. I'll make it again!

Very disappointing recipe. There was not enough liquid for the amount of rice called for. Dish also lacked spice and flavor. I threw the dish in the trash rather than serve to my guests.

Although none of the three are very cuban at all. Particularly red (Sure you didn't mean black?) beans.

It's a base recipe. Only used 2 cups of rice as 3 cups would not work with only 4 cups of liquid. I've always used the 2:1 liquids to rice ratio. I expected it to be much spicier than it was, especially since I used an additional 1/2 tablespoon of the Spanish paprika. Next time I would add some chilis to it and a 2nd can of beans. End result was more like lots of rice with a little bit of beans.

I made this dish and it turned out ok. There wasn't enough spice. I added twice the amount of beans, and I used black beans instead of red beans, which may have caused the spices to be less pronounced. I would add more cumin, paprika, and maybe chili powder next time.
