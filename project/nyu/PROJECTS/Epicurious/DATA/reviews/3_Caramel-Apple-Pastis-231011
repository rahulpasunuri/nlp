I love this dessert. It's been a hit two thanksgivings in a row. It's not too sweet, which I like, and is great with the sauce and vanilla ice cream. I don't think it's actually that hard to make - just takes a bit of concentration. I'm bummed other people haven't liked it as much.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year, and it was the most popular dish of the entire feast. I adjusted the recipe slightly by using less sugar, but it was sweet enough. The phyllo is tricky to manage, but if you work quickly, it's not too difficult to manage. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to make this dish, but it is time intensive.

I probably won't make this again. It looked impressive but it didn't taste very impressive. The flavor was flat and it was too labor intensive. The best part was the vanilla ice cream.

Maybe I did something wrong, but the phyllo was quite soggy even after just taking it out of the oven. The apples were delicious, but the crust disappointed.

I made this dish three times leading up to a Thanksgiving dinner offering. In the first go round, prepared it by the book, and while it had some delightful elements, i) it was way too sweet even without the caramel drizzle, and ii) while I liked the phyllo's crispy flakiness I missed having a bottom crust with some tooth. I decided to layer in a refrigerator pie crust into the phyllo to get a more substantial bottom crust. In the second go round, I cut all the sweet stuff in half. Since my aim was to work on crust, I just used a couple cans of store-bought apple pie filling with some cinnamon thrown in. Half-way through layering the phyllo, I layered in the refrigerator pie crust, and continued on layering the rest of the phyllo. The result was terrific. My wife and I could not begrudge the prefab apple pie filling, and could not stop eating this pie. The third round was my production pie, destined for a Thanksgiving feast. This time I combined my hybrid crust technique with the from-scratch apple filling, still keep the sweet stuff cut by half. The resutl was lackluster. Though I baked right up to the moment of heading over to our Thanksgiving feast, byt he time dessert time rolled around hours later, the pie seemed to "fall flat" losing much of its charm. Bottom line: half the sweets, layer in a real pie crust, and plan to eat it right out of the oven, because its essential beauty is fleeting. (Be aware that cooking the honey like that makes a pretty strong bouquet, so this might not be a recipe you want to fix before company comes.)

I made this on Wednesday morning to bring to my family's Thanksgiving dinner. It looked wonderful right out of the oven, though as someone else noted it did take less time than the recipe called for (30 mins @ 400 & 13 @ 425). As the day went on, I noticed that it seemed to be collapsing on itself a bit, to the point where the phyllo was edging off the bottom of the cake pan. Since we were going to a small gathering and I was dying of curiosity, my husband and I had a piece on Wednesday night. It was delicious, but as I feared it was a little soggy. And the caramel sauce did push it over the top as far as sweetness was concerned--I didn't think it needed it (and I didn't use all the cinnamon sugar when putting it together, either). By Thursday evening, it was really, really soggy. It didn't look terribly pretty anymore--even the top layer of phyllo was limp. The taste was still quite nice, but the texture of it definitely disappointed. Perhaps I didn't drain the apples well enough, but they didn't seem particularly wet when assembling the dish. I'd only make this again to be served within just a few hours, and given the amount of prep required, that seems unlikely. Too bad, because it really was impressive when it came out of the oven, and it tasted great the first day!

you need to watch the baking time a especially at the end when you want that "golden" look. mine burnt just a bit but it still tasted very good. mine wasn't overly sweet but maybe it is because i used splenda instead of sugar and used slightly less than 1/2 cup honey. i didn't use all of the cinnamon sugar, either.

This is a wonderful and sophisticated dessert. I put all of the toasted almonds on top of the last layer of phyllo. It looked beautiful and tasted even better.

Quite a lot of work in preparation, but a wonderful dessert nonetheless. Just a little bit sweeter than I would prefer. Next time I will use less confectioners sugar.
