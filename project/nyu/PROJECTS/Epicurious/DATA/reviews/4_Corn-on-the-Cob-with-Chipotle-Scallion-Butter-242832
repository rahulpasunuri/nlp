Yummm. I made this recipe the first time for Cinco de Mayo and it was a big hit, and has been every time I've made it since. After the corn is gone, guests have been dipping anything else they can find into the butter mixture. For the future, I'd probably either reduce the amount of butter or try to save it in the fridge because too much of it goes to waste.

I can never get enough of this recipe (for the butter, that is). Tonight I made it extra extra fiery & used it to make twice-baked potatoes, topped with a small scatter of cheddar & a generous handful of scallions.

delicious flavors but reduce the butter by half.

I love this butter recipe! I make 2 batches for parties- 1 with fewer chipotle chilies for those who can't stand the heat, and another with extra chilies for me! It will keep in the fridge for almost a week, freezes well (rolled in parchment) and goes with bread, potatoes, vegetables, etc. I especially enjoy it with cornbread.

Made this for my husband and best friend- they put it on everything, corn, steak, rice and the bread. This is a must in our house form now on.

This is good, but for my taste, not great. I'm not sure it is worth the trouble of mixing the special butter (not that it was much work...) I prefer the grilled corn with maple-chipotle glaze that can be found on this site.

Quick, easy, and delicious! I've made this several times with corn from the local farmer's market, and it's wonderful!

Great flavor combo and very easy to prepare. Don't skimp on the salt. I served this with bay scallop po'boys--perfect.

We grilled the corn but otherwise followed the recipe. My husband scoffed that I was going through the trouble of making a special butter, but after one bite he is a believer. This was super easy and it will definitely be a summer staple in our house. Absolutely a keeper!

I have been doing something like this for a long time but this was a very good combination of flavors. I'll use this again.

It is and extremely easy recipe. The chipotles in adobo sauce gives the corn a very nice smokey flavor. However, the recipe has to many scallions. I realize scallion is in the name but there are just too many it is all you taste. Over all though it is and excellent recipe for corn.

This recipe takes an "old favorite" and ramps it up to spectacular. SO easy, too! -- this is definitely a keeper.
