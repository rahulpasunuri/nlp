I subbed the sour cream with Greek yogurt, and added arugula and capers as a tasty garnish. Very pretty, simple, and elegant, not to mention tasty.

Nice combination of flavors, and certainly easy enough. In my kitchen 2T sour cream + 3/4 t lemon juice does not make a sauce you can "drizzle." Ended up using about twice as much lemon juice and skipped peel.

Very easy to make and quite delicious. I didn't have any fresh thyme so used fresh dill and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'll definitely make this again.

This is absolutely one of my favorite dishes to have for breakfast. When made exactly according to the recipe, it's quick and easy, but entirely worthy of being served on a white tablecloth with expensive mimosas.

OMG. This is just so good. The sauce is fantastic.

to a cook from southfield, MI: tomatoes generally do not go well with fish. that combination leaves a metallic wierd taste. smolked salmon is not an exception.

Awesome special breakfast fare, seems elegant but easy to prepare. If you like lox, this is for you. Don't omit the lemony herby cream mixture. Its almost like a fresh tartar sauce and sets it all off. My mouth is watering thinking of it....I love starting out my day with this kind of stuff!

This is a great way to elevate the NY diner classic LEO omelette idea (lox, eggs, onion). Its spectacular. Follow the recipe, people! Those who did not like this one - as with many of the poor reviews I have seen on this site - generally did not follow the recipe as written. I thought the smoked salmon was good (this should be freshly cured/smoked salmon, none of this cooked and vacuum packed variety - sorry). Staying within the vein of the recipe....you could maybe play with it by trying different types of cured salmon. Actually, Andreas Viestad ("Kitchen of Light") has a great recipe for curing your own salmon if you have trouble with local availability for good smoked/cured salmon. The lemon brings out the flavors of the salmon nicely. The herbal mix is great. A++ This is a delicious recipe.

A pleasant dish, but nothing to rave about. Sliced the salmon in slivers which made for a nicer presentation over the eggs. Served with grilled tomato slices and a toasted English muffin. Not sure whether or not I will make it again.

Made this for my girlfriend for valentines day and she LOVED it. I'm not much of salmon for breakfast type of guy, but I'll admit this was REALLY good!!! I baked fresh salmon instead of smoked. Really quick and easy:)

I guess I'm not a big fan of lemon-egg combinations, or I'd give this another fork. I've also been spoiled by having recently eaten real Swedish gravadlax, making the grocery store smoked salmon taste like corrugated cardboard next to gravadlax's clean, silky essence.

So easy and so good. I've never liked the texture of smoked salmon when it's actually cooked in with scrambled eggs, but served this way the texture remains silky and plays off beautifully against the scrambled eggs and lemony sour cream.

This was quick, easy and delicious. I served it with a toasted english muffin for a full meal. Definitely will do again.

My husband who loves smoked salmon for breakfast LOVES this and was very excited about having this again.
