Bland. No one in my family liked this, although we enjoy all of the ingredients. It just had very little flavor. I tried doctoring it up, to no avail. Disappointing.

Ok guys don't hate me...my tofu had gone bad so I substituted chicken...my apologies... I did accidentally cook the stir fry veggies before the "tofu" so I removed the veggies from the pan and then cooked the chicken through with the lemongrass mixture before adding them again to mix everything together. I think this may have actually helped the flavors. As the ginger and lemongrass did not mellow as much using a shorter cooking time. The dish has a delightful and interesting subtle heat. I also already had the rice cooked plainly so I added the bay leaf to the cooking veggies so I would not miss out on the flavor. A nice change to my usual dinner flavors!

This was pretty yummy. Time consuming, but yummy. I subbed sherry for the rice wine and used bok choy, snow peas and green onions for the veggies. Also used Whole Food's super firm tofu (365 brand, I think?) and the consistency was remarkably good! I'll make it again. Might dial back on the coconut milk just a tad next time.

I used 3 Thai chilies and 1 tbsp fish sauce. My bf and I really liked it, very flavorful and spicy. A great way to cook tofu.

I substituted gin for rice wine and used chinese broccoli instead of conventional broccoli. It was delicious! I'm definitely making it again.

I appreciated the subtlety of the flavors in this stir-fry. I used tabasco, and that brought it to the verge of "spicy." I found myself wanting more of the sauce than what is called for in the recipe, but increasing the coconut milk dampens the very delicate flavor of this dish.

Note to cooks: never eat the lemongrass or kaffir lime leaves or star anise you find in viet or thai food. They aren't supposed to be tender. They are meant to be left on the side of your plate just like bay leaves and juniper berries... Parsley garnishes I eat though.. Yum. I've tinkered a little with this to make it as spicy as it claims to be: substitute the thai chili sauce for cayenne powder... that should do it. Also, use tamarind water instead of lime juice or add some vinegar equal to the lime juice called for to the recipe. No bay leaf required, I agree - maybe a kaffir leaf instead... which no-one should try eating! If you don't like strong lemony oily flavours, you could try an americanized version with lemon zest instead of the lemongrass.

This is a delicious stir fry! The first time, my father and i ate all of this and left a tiny bit left for my mother! We are making it again tonight. Just a tip: Add more sesame oil and chile paste

Bland. Tried adding the fish sauce first, the lime juice last, and a dash of soy for salt; also threw in a tablespoon of sugar, which seemed to help. But the flavor profile felt thin, definitely something missing. And not spicy at all. That said, it was nice and healthy.

I enjoyed this recipe and using tofu is a nice change from meat dishes. I also added some fish cause to the marinade. I added the lime from the beginning since I love lime and I didn't think it made the tofu bitter at all, the rice wine balances the flavour nicely. I added sliced water chestnuts, snowpeas and baby corn as well. I also added a little bit of red curry paste to the coconut milk mixture which intensified the flavours. The rice in recipe doesn't really seem to match the dish - I used Jasmine rice instead. Overall, it's a great recipe that can be adjusted to suit individual tastes.

I'm embarrassed to say that I started the marinade before I realized I didn't actually have tofu. BUT, it still made a nice sauce for the stir fried veggies w/ rice. I agree on the addition of fish sauce--I added that to the marinade instead of lime, and then added the lime at the end. Using a kaffir leaf in lieu of a bay leaf didn't hurt either. Good weekday dinner.

The lime juice should have been added with the coconut milk mixture. Tofu absorbs any flavors it comes in contact with; by marinating it with lime juice made the end result sour/tart. Also, think there should have been a splash of fish sauce (Nuoc mam) for added flavor. Used thin strips of yellow pepper instead of carrots. Also, served it over whole grain spaghetti noodles, for a nice healthful lunch.

I agree with the previous comments. More salt is needed and it really isn't that spicy. However, with adjustments it was reasonably tasty, filling and definately healthy. I was trying to cut some calories!

This recipe was good - worthy of a weekday dinner, not company. It was bland if you didn't add salt. The lemongrass didn't cook down; I later found out that it's the bottom of the lemongrass stalk that is wanted, not the top. I liked the flavors and will probably make it again.

Marinate Tofu first. Unmarinated you get what you ask for. Tweak the spices and it's great. Mom always said there were no bad cooks only lazy or uneductated ones.

Edible, cheap, and not too time-consuming -- but very bland.

This recipe is a cinch to make and very healthy, but it's way too bland for my tastes. I made it precisely as it's written, so maybe some of you fiddlers will have better luck. Me, I'll just find a different recipe.
