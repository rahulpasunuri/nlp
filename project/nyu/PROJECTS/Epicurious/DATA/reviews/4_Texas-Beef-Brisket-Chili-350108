Excellent bean-less chili. Uses very lean beef round roast - about the price of hamburger - cut into about 1-inch pieces; same with squash. Otherwise unwieldy with torti(llas, and too big to eat in a bite. Might add a bit of chocolate (for mole flavor) and maybe a few black beans. Did not have salty flavor so often associated with chili, but many layers of flavor.

Took 1st place in a chili cook off with this recipe. I used chuck instead of brisket, cut into 1 inch pieces. Cut the squash about the same size and roasted it in the oven, added it at the end.

Yum! A couple of notes... I followed the advice of another reviewer and used stewing beef instead of brisket. I also decreased the beer to only half a can. It was tender and not greasy at all. After removing the cover, I cut the time by 30 minutes (mainly because I was anxious) and I don't think that hurt the overall result. Last, but not least, the ancho chili's that I purchased were large and I only used 3, which was PLENTY of heat. Will make again for sure.

I have made this chili each year when I finally feel fall is here. It is a bit time consuming, considering it is chili. For me, it takes division into two pots, which is perfect if you want to make one more spicy than the other. We LOVE this chili! The squash brings in eye appeal and texture, not to mention a health benefit (but, who cares, its chili, right?)!

What about using COOKED BBQ Brisket??? ???? I am imagining the issue of greasy won't be there. Looks like a fab recipe

This is the first recipe in 10 years that I have made from Epicurious that I was so very disappointed in. One huge GREASY mess. I followed the recipe to a T. Spent $38 on my brisket. Like I said, one HUGE GREASY mess. Through it out. So sad.

Best chili EVER!! The first time I made it, I followed the directions to a T. I found that the beef took forever to become tender and was difficult to eat. Since then, I just cut the chunks up much smaller (approximately 1" cubes). I also soak 9 Ancho, 3 Chipotle, 3 Habanero, and 3 Guajillo chiles in plenty of hot water. I don't seed them before grinding. This gives the chili a much spicier, deeper flavor. SLURP!!

Key points if you like your Chili thick (ie to put in tortillas etc): - Dont add the beer - Dont use brisket (lean stewing beef instead) - Roast the butternut squash ahead of time, before adding to dish - Cook ahead one day and then reheat for when you want to eat it. Result: Thick, very tasty and mild.

I have made this sooo many times!!! Loverlee loverlee loverlee! I don't put in the beer though. I tend to make extra ancho chile spice paste/sauce & keep it in the fridge to use on other stuff :)

My husband found this recipe and mentioned that we should change the cut of meat in it. I made it directly from the recipe and wish I had taken his advice. The flavors were a very nice blend and the squash added a different textural element and some smoothness (and a bit of sweetness) to the flavor. However, the huge chunks of brisket are fatty and difficult to manage.

Rating: 4
Tastes were delicious. I think I will use a different cut of meat. The brisket remained a bit tough. I didn't have dried ancho chiles so I used chipotle.

I guess a lot of you don't realize that except for the squash and tomatoes, this recipe is pretty close to the Original San Antonio chili which many feel is the first and original chili in Texas, If you want it spicier add a dried serrano or a couple jalapeno (or chipolte) chilies.

I love this as an alternative to the typical chile recipes. I used stewing beef and a different dried pepper (aji panca), which was a bit hot for some, but I loved it. A keeper.

Rating: 4
I've made this again and again. I pretty much follow the recipe except I use the cilantro leaves rather than the stems. My favorite new idea from this recipe is the addition of butternut squash which I coat with a little olive oil and roast and just stir into the chili during the last few minutes of cooking. This helps the squash retain its texture and flavor. Really delicious chili!

Ymmm... we come back to this recipe time and time again. A great chili... perfect after a day in the SNOW! And very forgiving if you don't have all the right ingredients.

I loved this chili! As with all recipes, I tweaked it to how I thought it should go. First, I prepared it in my slow cooker. Rather than beef brisket, I used a very high-grade pork with very little fat and I did not add bacon. I also added some extra "hot" spices to make sure the chili had real kick too. I served this for a gourmet dinner party and served a green salad and a vegetable succotash along with it. My guests raved. I think the key with this recipe is to adjust the spices to your liking and to realize that using a beef brisket and bacon together might make the final product greasy and fatty so choose your cuts of meat and how you cook them accordingly.

I was expecting fireworks from this recipe, but was a bit disappointed. It was definitely a stew vs a chili - thinner broth with chunky meet. I found that the flavor was a bit weak (I used 4 large Ancho chilis) and very greasy. The one take away that I will keep in my recipe box - guacamole on chili is AWSOME!

This is the best chili I've ever made or had. I've never made it with ancho chilis - have always used chipotle (and I don't know the difference). I love the smokey flavor, especially combined with the squash. I've made tons of variations of this recipe with different types of beef (depending on how much time I have) and I've even added beans once when I needed more volume (teenage boy in the house), and skipped the beer when we didn't have it. I also haven't cooked it in the oven since the first time. I just cook it on the stove top and it is great. This is an absolute favorite!

Fantastic flavor. Love this and have made it every winter a few times. Outstanding as is.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe but a bit of a note: the recipe says to add enough boiling water to cover the chilies but then you are supposed to have enough soaking liquid to add later, so make sure you use about 2 - 2 1/2 cups boiling water to ensure you have enough soaking liquid. I didn't have as much and ended up using broth which was fine but not the same. Otherwise, this is a great recipe.

Rating: 4
Perfect Fall flavors! Served it with cheddar dill cornbread. Made a couple alterations/changes. I couldn't get whole anchos, so I bought ground, and used approx, 2 oz. and it was perfectly mild. I roasted the squash till almost tender for sweeter flavor. I shredded the beef. Also added 2 shots of fresh made espresso to deepen the chili flavor. Couldn't help it, but I added Kidney beans, and I would honestly use this recipe as a base for a more beans to meat ratio chili next time! Although, we used some leftover to make soft tacos, yum!!!

This chili is superb, I have been making this for about a year now and as I prepare to make it for the first time this season I realized I hadn't left a review. This is a great foundation for a chili and you can add or subtract to your tastes. I have found that adding a rich stout and some espresso grounds help add a nice dimension to this chili.

This has become a favorite with my friends now begging me to make it again. I usually add some black beans & have tried a variety of beers. Summit EPA has become my beer of choice, although I may try the Summit Oktoberfest this fall, serving cold ones with the chili. Make sure to have LOTS of condiments. Chips, sour cream, avocado, tomatoes, cilantro, chives, etc.

This has become a family favorite and is now an easy recipe for me because I have made it so often. However, I make it with out the squash. The sauce is so delicious that I often use it just for dunking tortillas or bread.

I've made this chili for several large group gatherings and it is always a huge hit. The first time was right before Christmas for my son's birthday- we had 15 kids and 10 adults and everyone kept going back for seconds and even thirds. I used ancho chiles in adobe sauce, about 1-2 chiles and maybe a tablespoon of the sauce and that added just the right amount of heat. Modela Negro is the beer I use and it works great with the other flavors. This is seriously the best chili I've ever had.

Wow, what a disappointment. It took a long time to make, and turned out almost inedible. I doctored it, by putting the extra liquid and some fat back in the pot, waited until next day...still not that good. Just ok at best.

This needed a LOT more liquid to qualify as a chili. The flavors were good but overall, it was strange. The fattiness of the brisket was creepy, and having to cut up the giant chunks of brisket in a soup bowl made it annoying.

Rating: 1
I followed the recipe exactly and I let the chili sit overnight then trimmed the fat off the brisket and defatted the chili. It barely had any chili flavor to it. The consistency and flavoring was that of a beef stew not a chili. Everyone at the Super Bowl party only took a little bit and did not go back for seconds.

Love this recipe. I took 2nd place at the office chili cookoff with it last year. Didn't change the recipe at all with the exception that I didn't have any Mexican beer, and just used a Sam Adams lager. This dish has a lot of flavor and after four hours in the oven, the brisket is super tender.

Just made this and we absolutely loved it. I made it in my crockpot after cooking the bacon and onions in a frying pan. Although it would probably be good with substitutions I think the Ancho chillies really make a great contribution to the flavour. Love the squash substitution for the beans and would definitely make it again, in fact I think I will make another batch soon and freeze it!

I changed this recipe quite a lot-- but the combination of beef brisket and butternut squash is something I would not have come up with on my own. After frying the bacon, I removed it and later used it as a garnish, while I used the bacon fat to cook with. I also added chipotles, black eyed-peas, black beans, and italian sausage. For the garnishes, I shallow fried strips of flour tortillas to go on top, along with the bacon, cilantro, avocado, red onion, and cheese. Needless to say it was ridiculously delicious and I won the chili cook-off!

We're eating it as I write this. I normally dont' like chili but my husband would eat it every day... He told me to rate it a 3 but couldn't tell me why it wasn't a 4. I thought it was a 4. No its not a spicy chili but that's something you can adjust. For me it was just right. We used sirloin tips instead of brisket and the meat is literally melting in my mouth. We did cut the pieces smaller so that probably helps. We used Mild Mexican Chiles as we couldn't find the ancho but everything else as it called for. Sooooo good!

Rating: 4
First of all, I usually read some reviews before I make something, but didn't do that before I made this. I probably should have. I only had 3 ancho chiles, but I also had some pasila/negro chiles...so I did 3 and 3. I also went light on the Jalapeno and only used a 7 oz can. I needed to add an entire can extra of beef broth to make sure the squash were under liquid while cooking. So the good...this ended up being a wonderful and complex chili. I was really impressed...the flavors were multi-layered and way beyond what I normally get when I make chili. I gave it 4 forks for the flavor alone. To me though, the beef to squash ratio was way too high. When I do this again, I'm going to try to up the volume of squash and reduce the amount of meat. Anyway, you really need to make this recipe. It is great...it might just take some experimenting to get it the way you want.

This is less a review, since it is cooking now, and more a question--I used the chipotle's in adobo but understand it has considerably more heat. Can I tone it down with some tomato paste/sauce/etc?

Would have gladly given it 4 forks, but everyone thought it was way too saltly. Still, I would make it again only halving the salt. I removed the seeds and membrane of the chilis before soaking them and used medium hot chili powder. It left a nice heat but not too hot. Meat was very tender.

Rating: 4
This chili was great. However, I chickened out and scraped all the seeds from the chiles. The chili came out great but there was no heat at all. Next time I'll leave the seeds. However, the kids ate it. I cut the squash into big chuncks and they didn't fall apart with all the cooking.

I have made this twice. First time in slow cooker and second time on stove. I cut down on prep by leaving skin on squash. I also added both cans of tomatoes last time and found that it was a bit too soupy, but fixed that with a little cornstarch. I would also say this is not traditional chili, but a nice change. I don't like beans in my chili anyway. It does take a long time to cook, but not a long time to prepare. I found the ancho very quickly in the local latin food market. Great chili. My kid came home from school and wanted dinner immediately. Very good.

WARNING: IF YOU MAKE THIS ONCE, THEY WILL MAKE YOU MAKE IT AGAIN! If you can't find Ancho Chiles, Poblano, New Mexican, or Texas Chiles all work fine! I have made this probably at least half a dozen times now. It is worth all of the effort and I have yet to find someone that doesn't like this recipe. I am now known for this recipe among friends and family and it is constantly requested everytime I come home or visit relatives. It does create a mess and be sure you read ALL of the instructions before you begin and have everything all chopped up and ready before any of it.. It is sooo delicious though! Be sure to get those extra toppings.. and I got sour dough buns and cut off the tops to serve them in and they were even more spectacular!

Rating: 4
Awesome - first time I made this I could find no dried peppers, so I looked up anch chilis and found they were basically the same as poblano -so I used about 1/4 of a single fresh poblano instead of 6 dried anchos. Have made it since and must say it's spicier with the small amount of fresh poblano than the 6 dried anchos. I also added carrots and peeled potatoes (both items cut in bold chunks) - they work great with the squash and meat and add a bit of colonial meat-and-potato warmth to this otherwise TexMex dish.

Rating: 0
Great recipe. Have made it twice since fall '08. Not having dried ancho chiles, I've had success with dried chili de arbol peppers. And feel free to cook far longer than the 45 minutes recommended once the squash goes in. All it does is get better. And like most chilis, it is always better the next day...and the next...and the next.

Made this almost as is, but using regular diced tomatoes as I couldn't get fire-roasted. Left it on low in the slow-cooker for about 9 hours. It was tender & delicious, especially the next day. To change up the leftovers, I added a can of chickpeas. Would definitely make this again.

wonderful deep flavor, and the gentle sweetness of the squash provided a satisfying contrast with the heartier beefy flavor. I did roast the squash first, and was careful not to overcook it as I think that that squishy squash would not be a pleasant addition! I make many versions of chili, and this will be entering my repertoire.

Rating: 4
This is really delicious. The only changes I would make is to parboil or steam the butternut squash first. I found it took much longer than 45 minutes to soften. And, if you like it spicy, add more chili powder and use hot green chiles. We live in Texas and most of the people at my dinner party could have taken it hotter!

What an unusual and really YUMMY stew! My brother has made it 3 times and I followed his reccommendation of substituting 1/2 of a can of Chipotles in Adobo for the dries chilies. Rather than Brisket, I used Buffalo stew meat (really tender!) Made up the soaking liquid with another Mexican dark beer. As with most reviewers, I cut the meat and squash smaller. I did add the black beans to the stew and my guests loved it!!!!

This was REALLY good! My family loved it and has already asked for it again. It was too spicy for the very young kids, however. Served with flour tortillas, avocado, tomatoes, cheese and sour cream and fresh cilantro. For those of you who have one in your area, Costco usually sells chopped butternut squash in the frozen section. This can also be made in the crockpot to save time, I just threw in a can of diced tomatoes to make sure there was enough liquid for the cooking time. Think I will make this again next week!

Made this for supper club, as will be moving to TX soon and wanted to get in the spirit. A thumbs up from all! Absolutley agree with other reviews to cut meat chunks and squash smaller to 1/2-3/4 inch chunks at most!. The butternut squash, which manages to blend really well with other flavors, also added nutritional element and great autumn feel and look - not too spicy, but nice little kick to it! I made wraps as leftovers with Whole Wheat tortillas and the avocado etc suggested in the recipe - absolutley deelish!

Fantastic recipe. I did substitute a large can of rinsed black beans and one of red beans for the squash mainly for texture ( I was afraid the squash would get too soft with prolonged cooking) although I really didn't feel like messing with a butternut squash anyway. Be aware 8-10 servings is conservative at least if you do the bean substitution. Could be hotter too. This recipe goes into rotation with my faves. Cheers.

I made this for a post-Navy football party where people had been tailgating all afternoon and everyone still snarfed it down (many requests for the recipe)! I followed the recipe except that I cut the brisket into tiny chunks (about 1/2" square), which made it easier to ladle into small bowls and eat while standing /talking at the party. Served with garlic bread and lots of red wine. It's a keeper!

I've made this twice now for two different groups and got great reviews both times. I didn't make any changes to the recipe. As far as prep, the most time consuming part for me was getting the 1/2 cup cilantro stems. If you have little helpers, ask them to pick off the leaves. A tip for cutting the squash, is to stick it in the microwave for 3 minutes. It makes it easier to peel and slice. You can also buy it precut at Trader Joes.

This is a delicious but quite hot chili that is good to make ahead for company. I used a 3-3/4 lb. brisket and it was more than enough for 4 adults and 3 kids. I omitted the ancho chiles as I could not find them, used a 4 oz can of mild diced chiles, and 2 whole 10 oz cans of the fire-roasted tomatoes. Even though I reduced the chili powder from 2 TBSP to 2 TSP, it was way too spicy for the kids. The adults felt the spice level was just right - 2 TBSP would have been way too hot. The squash works great - the squash cubes absorbed the sauce. I cut the beef and squash cubes smaller as suggested in some of the reviews. I made this 3 days ahead and warmed up the covered pot in a 350 oven for an hour. I would make this again for adults but it is not kid friendly.

This recipe was great. I had a really hard time finding the dried ancho chiles, but finally found them at Whole Foods. I cooked the meat about 30 minutes more than suggested, the meat was a little tough at the suggested time, and it was perfect with the extra cooking time. I couldn't wait a day or two to eat it, we ate it the same day I made the dish. Delicious.

I thought this was good, but I agree, more like a stew. I used the precut squash available in the markets, and cut it into smaller pieces and put them in the microwave just to soften them a little so it wouldn't take so long in the often for them to cook. I couldn't get the dried ancho chiles, so I used some chipotle chili powder I had and added a cup of water to it and blended it with the rest of the ingredients for the paste. It made the chili very hot, but good. Will have leftovers today and see how it is the day after. The meat came out very tender, but I think I prefer other chilis with beans more.

This was a really good 'chili.' We thought it was more like a stew, but yummy nonetheless. I did cut the beef and the butternut squash into smaller pieces (more like 1") to cut down on the cooking time. I didn't think there was too much chopping or work involved--peeling the squash with a peeler was a breeze and pureeing the chiles only took a minute. Soak the chiles while you chop! Great the next day, too.

Extraordinary!! I cook from recipes on this site all the time, but seldom bother to review them. This stew is truly sensational, and I encourage you to try it. My only changes were to reduce brisket to 3 lbs and to use Chipotle Chili powder instead of regular chili powder, plus I followed other reviewers' counsel to cut beef and squash into smaller cubes. We planned on eating this tomorrow night, but the aroma was so tantalizing that we ate it all tonight. It is rich, hearty, complex, and satisfying. Bon appetit!

Made this last night and it turned out wonderfully. The only thing negative thing I would say is that there wasn't very much liquid in it. I actually added another bottle of beer when I took it out.

Couldn't find dried ancho chiles, so used dried anaheim with no complaints. This recipe makes a TON of food so the labor is somewhat worthwhile. Honestly, most of the 'labor' was me running around trying to find dried anchos! Once the ingredients are all together it's pretty straightforward.

This was good and hearty but not really worth the time it took to make. I actually prepped most of it the day before so I could cook it the next day. After all of that, it's still just chili.

My neighbor and I take turns making the cover recipe each month and this was my month. Although the chili was good it was not the best I've ever had.

This was delicious! It wasn't very much work either, just took a long time to cook. I couldn't find any dried chilis so instead I bought some cubanelle peppers and then roasted them in the oven while it was preheating.

I will definitely be making it again.

Also, I didn't have anchos, so I used dried chipotles. It did turn out a little thin, so the second time I served it over rice, which was delicious. I will also try adding some cornmeal as a thickener. This is even better the next day. The flavors are rich and deep, it's just really satisfying. I'm going to enter this one in my next chili cookoff--I already have one chili title, but I'm betting I'll get another with this recipe.

I made this to watch the Sox play fall ball last weekend and it was delicious. The squash was a perfect addition to the mix. We had all the sides plus chipotle mac and cheese, pumpkin biscuits and a big green salad. YUM!

Really delicious chili. I made it exactly as written, just cut the beef in smaller pieces. Served with cilantro and sour cream.

This recipe is to labor intensive for the results. Two days later, 4 1/2 hours cooking time, 30 minute soaking time for the Chilies, 1 1/2 hours prep time plus a huge blister on my index finger from cutting up a raw butternut squash this was definitely not worth it. I will stick to my tried and true recipe for chili from a much older issue of Bon Appetit that has much better flavor and add squash to it on a whim. Time is high commodity for me and to waste it on such a mediocre recipe get real!

Followed the recipe exactly. Read reviews before making. WAY too spicy-hot to enjoy. Threw out leftovers. Waste of time and $$.

I agree with all those who didn't like it. The picture on the cover was beautiful and the recipe sounded different. All in all, not good and not worth the time and effort.

Followed the recipe exactly and served it the next day. It was delicious, spicy but not hot.

This is wickedly good and is a definite keeper. I followed the directions as written and served it the next day with cilantro, chopped red onion and picked jalepenos. Yum. Was perfect accompaniment for beer and football.

The flavors in this chili are wonderful. The guys in my family are chili connoisseurs, and they raved about it. I was a bit concerned about how the squash would stand up to the other ingredients, but it was a really nice counterpoint to the chilis. The next time I make this, I'm going to cut the brisket into smaller pieces. I probably wouldn't change anything else though.

This recipe sounded like it would be to die for... but the flavors were bland, the texture was mushy, and the butternut squash was just plain weird. I certainly would never call this a chili -- a southwestern stew, maybe -- and only so-so at best. Husband hated it and begged me to go back to my own chili recipe.

I just made this chili for a casual dinner party, and it was fabulous! I started it the night before -- just put it all together and got everything simmering, then cooled it off and put it in the fridge. I baked it a little longer than the recipe called for to be sure of the tenderness of the beef -- about 2.5 hours, then another hour with the squash -- about 3.5 hours total the next day. It was the perfect dish for entertaining because it can just keep baking until you're ready. Everyone raved -- even the kids!

This was fantastic. I don't remember seeing my husband eat something this quickly and go for a third helping!

Very good. The ancho chilies give it a very flavourful distinctive taste. Not quite spicy enough for me though; in fact it was almost a stew...but stll very very good. Next time would bring the temperature up just a notch.

This is delicious and I did not think it was particularly labor intensive. I made it in an afternoon and we've eaten it all week. Both my daughter and my husband picked the photo off the cover of my Bon Appetit as a dinner request. We've just finished it and my husband has already requested it again. YUM!!!!!

Ridiculously good. Very surprising for how few ingredients it has. The butternut squash is an inspired pairing as someone else said. I forgot the can of green chiles, and added a habanero from my garden but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I definitely recommend making it one day ahead so flavors blend - also makes skimming the fat much easier. Don't skimp on the toppings either, especially the avocado. Will be my go-to chili recipe in the future.

MMMMMMM! This was so good. And it makes great leftovers. Just add some guacomole and homemade salsa. It just gets better and better. Don't forget the squash. Its a perfect match for this recipe.

We read the reviews of this recipe and were very excited to make it. Unfortunately, we were disappointed. This is good chili, but for the cost of the ingredients and the time to make it, it should have been outstanding. I have made other chili recipes (including ones from this site) that were much better. The flavor lacked a punch. We will not be making this again.

A mild chili with excellent earthy flavors. The recipe is wonderful when followed exactly, but reasonable substitutions can be made without changing the dish. For example, Pasilla chiles, which are not Anchos, can be easily substituted and are in most supermarkets (foodsub.com).

This is delicious!! Butternut squash wasn't available so I used a different type. It turned out great. It is labor- intensive with all the chopping, but I will definitely make it again (on a Saturday/Sunday). I highly recommend this dish.

4 forks-unanimous, Did not change anything; very rare for me: "you know how this would really be good?" is my favorite comment/insult! The Anchos make it; check your Durkee Spices for Ethnic Creations-Ancho Chile seasoning. I used 6 TBSPNs in 2 cup water for liquid. (Anchos are dried pablanos; like chipotle is smoked jalapenos in Mojo--did you know that?)

Good! We used chuck instead of brisket, as suggested by some other reviewers. I don't like squash (it's a texture thing), so we swapped sweet potato for the squash. It was really tasty. I'd cut the chunks of meat and sweet potato smaller next time, and I think I'd throw in a can of black beans toward the end just for kicks. I might try different combinations of chiles, too, just to change things.

This was delicious and the aroma while cooking was wonderful. The only change I made was to use New Mexican Chilis since I could not find Ancho. I used only 3 and I'm glad I didn't use anymore. Very flavorful and spicey and the sweetness of the squash was a great compliment.

Excellent chili! I used all of the chili-water to soak the meat. I didn't want it to get dry. I did not change a thing in the recipe, which is very rare for me. This is a keeper! I also blogged about it on my website! http://www.anticiplate.com

I made it Thursday, we ate it that night...it was really good, very tasty. Had it Friday night, the taste was rich and delicious. Will be an Autumn favorite from here on in!

OMG! This is definitely the best chili I ever had. The only thing I changed was cubing the meat and squash into smaller, 1/2 inch cubes, otherwise I followed the recipe, cutting cooking time to about 2.5 hours. A keeper!

What a wonderful chili. We served in corn tortillas and topped with cheese and avocado. YUM! I noticed that others omitted the ancho chilies...don't, they make the recipe. I will definately make again and again.

Outstanding chili. I made it for a dinner party and 8 people ate it all ! I loved the smokey flavor and the butternut squash was so good with it. Will definately make again and again.

Best chili ever - wow! I used a combo of dry chilis because store didnt have enough anchos - 3 large anchos, 1 guajillo, 2 small habanero and half a 7 oz. can of chipotle in adobo. Also used McCormicks Hot Mexican Chili Powder. This combo (especially the habanero) made a spicy, smokey chili! I soaked the chilis overnight. Also, I changed the first roasting to 3 hrs at 300 (instead of 2 hrs at 350) because I had errands to run. Otherwise, followed the recipe. Waiting a day really developed flavors and made easy to skim fat. Loved all the condiments - especially avocado. The squash is wonderful and you dont miss the beans. Next time Ill make smaller chunks of beef and squash (just 1 inch cubes) and ask my butcher to cut the beef. Soak chilis Friday night, make chili Saturday, and Sunday you will have a football feast.

This chili smelled good the moment I put it in the oven....probably the cilantro. It was very thick at first, but quickly became watery...but the time it was done, it had thickened up on its own. I used New Mexico chilis and 6 lb of meat...otherwise as written and everyone loved it on Monday night football night! It was perfectly spicy, a pleasant little burn in the belly! Too spicy for the 2 year old. Definately a keeper.

First, the ancho chiles are the predominant flavor of this recipe. If you omit them all together you're not really making chili... That being said, I followed the recipe almost exactly (used slightly less meat) and it was wonderful, slightly labor intensive but worth the effort. It's not spicy hot, but it is very flavorful. You would have to make some additions if you wanted it hot. Also, ancho chiles are dried pasilla (a.k.a. poblano) peppers. So the reviewer who used dried pasillas did in fact use ancho chiles. You'll see them labeled as both at the market. http://en.wikipedia.org/w iki/Pasilla I thought the butternut squash was an inspired pairing. Yum!

I made it as written, just added a little masa/water mix at the end to thicken it a bit. Absolutely delicious--deep, complex flavor without being overpoweringly spicy.

I made this recipe last night , and it got a rave review from my Texas Chili "purist", but I did leave out the squash. It was actually the first time that I've tried making chili with actual dried chiles (I used pasilla instead of ancho), which was so much better than just chili powder called for in ordinary recipes. The combination of spices in the recipe is excellent, and I would say this is on the very mild side, but it would be easy to turn up the heat with additional chiles or even just some cayenne or jalepenos if you like it spicier. We loved this with shredded cheese, a little sour cream and chopped fresh red onions. I also added a little bit of unsweetened ground chocolate, only about a tablespoon for the whole pot of chili, but I always think that adds a nice flavor to chili. I will certainly make this again this fall and winter.

Fantastic chili that will be made again and again! I could not locate a brisket so I substituted chuck. Worked beautifully.

This was an absolutely excellent beef and squash stew. However, even with all of the chili peppers, it just didn't have quite the spice that one would expect from a chili. It's definitely worth making, but this is not the spicy chili the "Texas" in the name would have you believe.

Outstanding!! Best chili I've made or had in many years. I was anxious about the butternut squash but it definitely added flavor, color and texture.

Rating: 4
Good stuff. I made as written except used less brisket (3 lbs. was plenty) and added a delicata squash (because I had one). The chiles make this taste much richer than if using only chili powder. Plus, no "powdery" texture -- always a bonus!

Made exactly to the recipe, and it's wonderful. The only thing I might change next time is to roast some or all of the squash; it doesn't seem to have as much of its own flavor as I'd like.

I forgot to say that I did not use the ancho chilies either.

I added 1 bunch of carrots (cut into thirds) and 5 lb of russet potatoes (cubed into 1 inch peices)instead of squash and cooked it all at the same time for 2 1/2 hours (last 1/2 hr without lid) and my family loved it. Better 2nd day! This will be a wintertime staple for us!

Great recipe! I made it in a LeCrueset Pot, and cooked alot faster than estimated here. I also did not use the ancho chilies, but it still tasted great. I will totally make this throughout the fall and winter...

Wonderful Recipe!! I did not use the ancho chilies, but it was definitely still a huge hit! I cooked it in a LeCreuset pot, and it cooked faster than the time estimated here... The butternut squash adds a great "fall-ish" taste. Totally making again
