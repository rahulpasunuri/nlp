Made this last night with a few minor amendments. Used less fetta, stirred through some english spinach at the end, and used canned cannelli beans (didn't plan ahead for soaking lima beans overnight). It was outstanding, and very happily packed a lunchbox of leftovers for today's lunch! Will definitely make again, this one's a keeper.

The dish was hearty and made with alot of ingredients that I love. My only problem with it was that the tomato flavors were very overpowering and tart. I think that this may be corrected with the addition of sauteed chopped carrots with the onions or with the addition of sugar. Also, I kept the cover on for part of the time so as not to lose any of the juice and I also added more wine. I would make the recipe again with these corrections.
