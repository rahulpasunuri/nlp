I've had papadzules in Yucateca cantinas, and it's a delicious dish. This was good ... but not quite what I was hoping for. The sauce in this recipe was a bit flat. So I'm not sure how to rate this. Compared to what I want, it's only so-so. Yet it is so unique that it's worth trying and experimenting with. I'll try it again using chicken stock instead of water, and maybe adding a bit of Mexican cream.
