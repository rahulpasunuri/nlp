Absolutely delicious! My husband and I served this with grilled sirloin steaks and asparagus to lighten up a typically heavy meal. I reduced the salt and upped the lemon. I didn't have sliced almonds but rough chopped some whole raw ones that I had on hand. I was a little excited when I woke up this morning and realized I had some leftover for my lunch today. If you are a fan of tabouli this is a must try.

Let me get this straight, Jen C: You made a bulgur recipe but forgot the bulgur?

Surprisingly delicous! I would not have thought to combine mint and cilantro, but it was amazing. The bf and I ate it all. I fogot to add the bulgar, but didn't miss it (I'll have to try it next time). The almonds gave it that special finishing touch and really brought out the flavor. I'm definitely adding this to my regular roatation!

This was certainly healthful and easy, with nice texture (and certainly a welcome relief from traditional tabbouleh) but not much flavor. I ended up doubling the almonds and adding a Moroccan spice pepper blend. Sprinkled flax seeds atop for crunch and health.

It's easy, it's tasty, it's healthy, it can be made ahead and I have more mint and cilantro growing in my garden than I know what to do with. What could be better?!

The bulgur was not completely cooked after 10 minutes. I did not have cilantro and decided to use fresh oregano - I'm sure that was my biggest mistake. If I were to make a gain I'd be sure to use cilantro, but I didn't feel excited about this enough to try again.

Just plain good! I made this a few months ago with salmon and I've thought about it several times since. I'm going to make it again tonight to go with kebabs on the grill. I try a lot of different recipes and I know something's good if I keep thinking about it! Easy, delicious, and healthy.

So delicious! Light but satisfying. I cut back on the salt just a tad, as per the other reviewers.

First time eat Bulgur - served it with the Prosciutto Chicken dish also from this issue of Gourmet. I felt it complimented the chicken dish very well. I didn't as as nearly as much salt as it requested (as advised by everyone). Delicious... and I love the texture - reminded me of quinoa. Defiantly going to experiment with this grain in the future.

This is wonderful. I was dubious about the amount of herbs but they were perfect. I agree that the salt was a bit much. Go with half at first and the add as needed.

My grocery store was out of bulgur, so I used baked organic brown rice instead. It was delicious, a nice combination of flavors. I'm sure it's wonderful made with bulgur, too.

I've never had Bulgur or Tabbouleh before and I was a little skeptical as to whether or not I would enjoy this but I was pleasantly surprised. This is a delightful little dish that I think I'll be making regularly.

Cut the recipe in half for 2 and it turned out great, a great healthy alternative to rice.

A nice twist on tabbouleh. Quick and delicious! Only comment: too much salt! -- I would halve the amount called for.
