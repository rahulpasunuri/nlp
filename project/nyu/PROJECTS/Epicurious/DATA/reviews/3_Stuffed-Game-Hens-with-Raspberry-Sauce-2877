This recipe is very good but the hens blackened because of the honey. You have to keep turning them. Maybe they should be covered for the first 15 minutes. I did mine at 425 on convection. I added chopped fresh mushrooms to the hot cooked rice. I had 6 ounces of raspberries and used half of the water, sugar, and lemon peel and it was plenty for 2. With the raspberry sauce this is a nice presentation.

I have made this dish over and over again. It is one of my husband's favorites. I strain the seeds from the sauce just before it is finished and then put it back on the stove to thicken up. It always turns out well! I sometimes put mushrooms in the rice. It is delicious! There are so many ways to "doctor" the recipe without ruining the original recipe. GREAT for a romantic dinner for 2!

If you want a divine sauce for these birds, you don't have to make the rasperry sauce in the recipe--just use the pan juices, the honey & butter mixture, to which I added a couple teaspoons of tarragon vinegar and a healthy pinch of dry tarragon. When the birds are done, in a small saucepan I boiled down two tablespoons of cherry (or apricot, etc.) preserves with a splash of madeira wine; add the pan juices to this mixture. It is divine, I finished the leftover with a spoon. To avoid too blackened skin, oil the birds with olive oil, & don't baste with the honey mix until the birds have been in the oven for at least 15 minutes.

I'm not actually rating this recipe, I was looking for a different recipe than the one I normally use but decided to make the usual. The recipe is on this site-Roast Quail with Cranberry Maderia Sauce. I figured I would post this incase anyone is looking for a fantastic cornish hen recipe-I use cornish hens instead of quail. Awsome.

a very simple recipe if you've already mastered the art of roasting chicken and turkey. the sugar in the sauce did burn onto the skin of the birds. however, the ones i cooked in a high-sided roaster only got a little bit browned -- the ones i cooked in a shallower baking pan (lasagna-pan sized) got much more toasted. the birds came out fabulously though; everyone at my dinner party went nuts over them. also, if the birds are getting burnt on the outside but are still undercooked, your oven is probably running too hot. i thickened the rasberry sauce by adding a slurry of 1 tbs cornstarch and 1 tbs water. use a looser seive if you're not getting enough fruit.

Tasty, but not enough to cook again. Some advice in cooking it though is that you have to follow the recipe so as to keep it tender and not burnt, i.e. turn and baste it frequently. We did every 10 minutes and it did turn out very tender. Something needs to be added to the sauce to make it tastier and a larger quantity would be good as well.

As a chef, I found this recipe to very easy, but very elegant. My husband loves this recipe. He tells me it gets better and better each time I make it. A helpful hint with the raspberry sauce, allow the sauce to simmer a few minutes longer than the recipe calls for or omit the water. This will cause the sauce to thicken much easier and faster.

I've made this recipe several times and it's been wonderful and simple to make. I also added mushrooms to the rice. I find that there is only enough for two people as well. I'm going to try cooking the hens using my rotissere next.

I agree with the reviewer who called this the worst recipe (s)he'd tried from this site! Parts of the skin were too done (almost burnt) and others underdone, which made for a very unattractive presentation. Two thumbs down from me.

I can't believe the other reviewers thought this was such an easy and elegant recipe! This was the worst thing I've made from this site. I followed the instructions to the letter. One of the hens burned half way through the cooking time. I wound up with about a tablespoon of rasberry sauce after putting the sauce through a sieve. And, my kitchen looks like a disaster area. The final product tasted okay (even without the rasberry sauce), but, it just wasn't worth it. My fiance and I didn't feel there was enough meat on the bones for even the two of us, much less four people.

This is a very elegant, easy and great tasting way to prepare cornish hens. The raspberry sauce really adds to this dish. We made extra and used it as a "dipping" sauce for the hens in a small side bowl. In my opinion, this works out better than just pouring it over the finished hen. People adore the raspberry sauce!

This really was fantastically simple to make although the time it takes the rice to cook is significant. I added chunks of portabella mushroom stems (used the caps for another dish)to the rice and it was very tasty. Also, I used a boxed mix of regular and wild rice which seemed simplest. I'd double the raspberry sauce and maybe cut down on some of the butter. Otherwise, c'est magnifique!
