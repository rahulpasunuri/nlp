I didn't have sour cream, so I substituted 7 ounces of 2 percent Greek yogurt plus 1 tablespoon melted butter. The cake was delicious, and I felt better for its being lower in fat. It rose nice and high in the baking dish.

Very easy, very tasty! I may have overcooked it by a minute or two, but the flavor is amazing! The only change I made is that I ran out of veggie oil so I used half veggie & half olive oil. I don't think that it made a difference at all.

Absolutely loved this! I found it very simple to make and it took very nicely to the substitutions I made. Only had fat-free vanilla yogurt on hand, so used it instead of sour cream. (I know that lemon yogurt is also available and will try it next time.) I also used ginger instead of cinnamon, but I had a bit - maybe 1/4 cup - of cinnamon honey left in the bottom of a jar to get rid of so heated it in the micro and threw it in with the yogurt mixture. Very moist and tender, this one's a keeper!

Wow, after reading some of the reviews, I wasn't expecting much from this recipe, but man, it was good! The only thing I had to substitute was yogurt for the sour cream (because that's what I had on hand), but we thought it was great! Not as lemony as say, a lemon pound cake might be, but it's a crumb cake, and as one, it was spot on in taste & form.

This recipe was disappointing. I made it exactly as written, except I did add 1/4 t. of salt, as suggested by another reviewer. It was just bland. I love lemon and cinnamon, but they don't play well together in this recipe, and the topping - while easy - is a pretty poor streusel substitute. I won't make it again.

it's much better with 1/2 tsp. of salt!

Very moist. Unlike other reviewers, I liked the subtle lemon flavor.

I doubled the recipe and it worked great in a 9x11 pan. Baked 50 minutes @ 300 degrees in a convection oven. I also added a teaspoon of lemon extract after reading reviews posted by others (thanks!).

This cake has a very nice moist crumb, but made according to the recipe, it was bland. I agree with previous reviews, it needs a flavour boost like a few drops of lemon extract.

The recipe was so easy to make! I liked that the lemon flavor didn't overpower the taste of the cake. Instead of sifting the powdered sugar over the top I made a glaze of powdered sugar and water to drizzled that over the top.

The cake was good but nothing to rave about. I cut down the cinnamon (only used about 4 dashes) and added a few drops of lemon oil to batter.

I really loved how easy this cake was. The flavor was very simple, allowed you to really taste the cake. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.

This cake was indeed simple to prepare. My husband enjoyed it. I agree with some of the previous reviewers in that the crumb topping was nice, but the lemon-cinnamon combination wasn't especially appealing. If I make this again, I'll omit the cinnamon. Not a bad recipe, but certainly not a "dish beyond compare".

I agree that this cake was very easy to prepare. It was just very... blah. It was too ordinary. The cinnamon & brown sugar give it a caramel color -- kind of like a spice cake.

This was more a coffee cake than a dessert cake, and, although tasty, was not exceptional. I tried to enhance it with more lemon juice and a lemon/powdered sugar glaze. That helped. Crumb topping texture nice.

Great cake, light tasting and just the right amount of lemon flavour. Better than Martha Stewart's recipe!

I think my husband said it best, it tastes more like a coffee cake than a lemon cake. We stilled enjoyed it.

This is a very tasty, lemony, easy to make coffee cake. Personaly, I found the cinnamon/lemon combination a little odd, so I might delete that ingredient next time. On the other hand, my family liked the cake very much just the way it was.
