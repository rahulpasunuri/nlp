This is really excellent. I usually let the chicken marinate for a few hours in the spice mixture before cooking, so that most of the work and mess can be done beforehand. By substituting chickpeas for the chicken, you can make a nice Chana Masala as well.

Dee-lish with some modifications. I added cubed potatoes (which I would recommend boiling about 10 minutes before adding to the mix for the 30-minute simmer). And I added 1/4 teaspoon red savina for a real kick. I also had some vindaloo spice, which I put in instead of the curry. And I used lamb instead of the chicken.

Don't forget the salt and pepper to taste at the end. Something is missing from the recipie, but my family loved it. I may try adding 1 tsp of methi seeds to the mixture in the blender next time I make it.

A solid recipe with a great overall taste that I feel is customizable in many ways. I suggest starting with kicking up the heat as a vindaloo is supposed to be hot and this is not. 1/2 to 1-whole habanero is good but 1 serano pepper is a bit more balanced. A tad more vinegar can spruce things up, too. Now a regular meal for us.

I stayed as true to this recipe and I could while pleasing my vegetarian wife. I used a 12oz package of Quorn chik'n tenders as a chicken substitute and added 4 yukon gold potatoes (cubed) to make up for the missing mass of two pounds of requested chicken. This didn't taste anything like the Vindaloo that I've had in local restaurants. I believe it needs to be consiberably more "saucy". I added nearly 2 cups of water during the 30 minute simmer and it was still pretty pasty. Additionally, I think this flavor is begging for some more complexity. Next time I'll consider using red curry paste instead of curry powder and I'll likely add between 10 and 15 ounces of tomatoe sauce.

This turned out so much better than expected! I'm so happy to find a recipe for one of my favorite dishes. We may not have to go out for Indian food any more. I'm definitely sharing this one with friends!

My family enjoyed this version of chicken vindaloo -- I modified by adding four potatoes (large dice) and when making the paste/sauce base, some chipolte in adobe and used hot curry powder from Penzey's -- it was deliciously hot.

Modified quite a bit this is good dish. I roughly followed the recipe, substituted authentic Vindaloo Masala from the ethnic store for all dried spices, added 1" potatoes with the onion "paste" also used tube tomato paste instead of canned tomatoes so I could control the thickness by adding more of less broth. Lastly, how can curry not have coconmut milk? added 1 cup at the 10 minutes. Also added in spinach at the end and a handful of slivered almonds (didn't have cashews). Over basmati with whole wheat flatbread (no naan at the store) its quite a good dish.

This was a good easy basic recipe as others have said. I made it w/4 skinless boneless chicken breasts. The amount of spices was just right, & I would use a hotter curry or more crushed peppers if I wanted more heat. It was delicious w/brown rice & plain Tandoori Roti flat bread. I would add peas, chick peas, or potatoes next time.

We loved this recipe and will make it again. I didn't have mustard seeds, so I added some ground mustard to the mixture. Mine was a little watery, but I added some chicken broth because it looked to dry at first. Next time, I'll omit the broth. Really good as leftovers!

Rating: 4
I really enjoy this recipe, and have no idea how some describe the sauce as watery - mine always turns out quite thick! I do add 2 T of tomato paste, so that adds some heft - but I finish it with a little cream so go figure. I add peas, sometimes red or yellow bell peppers, one serrano or habanero pepper and toasted pistachios with the cilantro at the end. Serve with raita and coconut batsmati (from Joy of Cooking) - not at all authentic but truly delicious and memorable.

I made this with lamb stew meat as suggested in the intro. The lamb was a little chewy to next time I would marinade in the spice mixture over night (the vinegar should tenderize the meat a bit) or cook longer. The flavors were great but could be a little hotter for us. I would like to try with chicken too.Very easy to prepare. We served with a hopped up IPA and carmelized onion naan. Great meal.

THIS IS A GOOD RECIPE BUT I'VE FOUND THAT YOU CAN USE BALSAMIC VINEGAR INSTEAD OF REGULAR. ALSO, TRY USING CHICK PEAS (GARBONZO BEANS) INSTEAD OF POTATOES.

I thought this was a great base recipe. I browned bone-in lamb stew meat (salt, pepper, dusted with flour) and then proceeded with recipe. Also used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and treated it like a braise. Yum!

Made with boneless pork loin. Used Hot Curry powder from Penzey's. Nicely Hot! The only problem I experienced was blending the sauce in the blender. I kept having to scrape down the sides in order to get enough near the blade to be blended. Next time will try the small food processor.

Rating: 2
Good flavors but bland by my standards. I expect vindaloo to be scorching hot and this recipe was far from it. I found the sauce watery (instead of a nice, thick rich red) so I added some heavy cream at the end and let it simmer a while longer. Definitely better the next day. Will make this again, adding much more heat.

Rating: 3
It is a little watery and perhaps a little bland, but it's not beyond repair. Use bone-in chicken thighs, add a tablespoon of tomato paste, increase the amount of spices (to taste) and add some blanched potato/root vegetable of your choice. Maybe not authentic, but tastes good, especially the next day.

I once had an excellent vindaloo that was a little sweet with apples in it and spinach. None of the Vindaloo recipes here seem to be anything like that. Can anyone point me in the right direction on a recipe like this? It was amazing. thanks

Another note: cooking is not an exact science, and if you use more or less of some of the spices, it still tastes okay. Also remember that the *quality* of your spices matters as much as the quantity, and there is a HUGE difference between using "mild" curry powder and authentic Indian curry powder. Try serving over rice or couscous.

Rating: 3
Good recipe. If you don't have cloves or cardamom, it still tastes fine. Try experimenting with different meats or combinations of spices until you find something you like.

Rating: 3
Tastes very close to my favorite Indian Restaurant version, with a few exceptions. I added a little cayenne to fire it up a bit and it helped greatly. I also upped the tomato content by about 40%. This recipe is more chunky than I am used to at restaurants so I may try crushed tomatos next time. Came out great and I will use again.

Rating: 3
Whoa! Unless you really like it hot, don't make the mistake I made and mix up the cumin and the curry measurements...! I made this recipe tonight for my parents, adding a bit more hot pepper and some chili pepper while they weren't looking and had them crying. Served with couscous and milk to soak up the burn, I think they liked it despite the heat. This seemed like a really good staple recipe, and I think everyone could toy with it to match their tastebuds. For some greens and a (practically) one pot meal, I added fresh green beans.

Rating: 3
I just made this dish the other night and it was delicious! I took the other reveiwer's advice and added less tomatoes (about 3/4 of a 12oz can) and loved the results. I didn't have mustard seeds so I substituted mustard powder and because I'm a heat freak I added 2tsp of pepper flakes. It tasted even better on the second day once the flavors were more melded.

Rating: 3
not as good as my fave indian restuarant, but for me to cook, it was AWESOME! i did not have any problems with the recipe or the "hotness" factor. AS a note to those who felt it was "mushy"- i used a 1lb and 12 oz can of the tomato with juices b/c when i put in the 16 oz (1lb) it looked a little weak and i didn't feel like saving the rest. It did cause the dish to be a little loose, but seconds were perfect! fresh ginger is KEY as well as fresh garlic.

GROSS. Not authentic. If I could figure out how to post a recipe, I'd post an authentic Vinadloo paste (which you mix with crushed/diced tomatoes and simmer with beef or chicken or whatever)..

Rating: 1
Like many of the others, I, too, found this recipe to be surprisingly bland and the sauce watery. I believe the onions should probably not cook as long so they can retain their texture, and I would consider adding tomato paste to thicken the sauce. Also, the seasonings need to be kicked up a notch, as Emeril says. Perhaps adding Tabasco's new Chipotle Sauce would help -- along with a good quality curry seasoning.

Rating: 1
This was the 1st recipe off Epi where my wife and I chose not to eat the meal. It was that bad. The sauce was a mushy mixture of onions and was a weird mix of way too much ginger, curry spices, but no flavor. It almost seemed like we randomly retrieved items from the frig and threw some spice and ginger it. If someone likes this dish, I honestly don't get it, and I'm pretty flexible.

I have made this recipe several times - with both chicken and lamb. It lacks spice but has great flavor. Last night I added celery with the onions, then added cauliflower at the same time as the chicken. Lastly I finshed it of with haricot vert - thin French green beans. It was great. Made a cucumber raita for the garnish. Just finished my left overs for lunch - yummy and very healthy!

OK OK I haven't made this recipe - I was surprised that there were not more vindaloo recipes on Epicurious, as it is my new culinary bible. I have remained faithful to Sudha Koul's recipe for vindaloo from "Curries without Worries". I just thought I'd recommend using turkey as an alternative to chicken because you can save a ton of fat calories and greater protein! My husband is now a vindaloo junkie...

Wonderful. I have to agree with some of the previous reviewers when they say - "forget about its authenticity! Just enjoy it! It's good grub!" (Both my parents are from India and I guess I can say that this might not be "authentic vindaloo" - but WHO CARES? Just enjoy!)

Rating: 1
I was very disappointed with this dish. Not only did it not taste like the vindaloo I have had in the past, it just didn't taste good at all. :( Maybe it was the generic "curry" powder; I don't know. The spiciness factor wasn't a problem because I know I can always increase that. I'm a novice and I was excited about making this dish. We didn't even eat the leftovers. And my husband will eat just about anything! Maybe once I am more proficient with Indian cooking I can tweak the recipe. Until then, the search is on...

I've been making this recipe since it was first published, and it's become a staple. For me it's great comfort food. I've made more authentic vindaloo -- marinated pork in palm vinegar and spices for two days -- and while its fragrance was incredible, its flavor didn't knock me out. This recipe is many times easier, and at least as satisfying. My Indian friends (albeit not Goans) also seem to like it just fine and don't seem too fussed by the issue of its authenticity.

Rating: 3
We like this recipe quite a lot, even if it isn't the most authentic. However, we do have a few suggestions. Add more crushed red pepper for a spicier flavor (it still won't be as hot as restaurant vindaloo). Add a bay leaf to deepen the flavor (not particularly authrentic, but neither is the recipe). Add one potato,cut into 1 inch chunks and steamed, to the stew about half way through the cooking. Let the stew cook for more than a half hour, even better, make it the day before serving and let the flavors develop overnight. Serve with a dollop of strained plain yogurt on top and some more cilantro.

My husband and I both loved this. I liked that it wasn't too spicy. Maybe it doesn't taste like restaurant Chicken Vindaloo, but it was still very good. Also, it was easy to make. We doubled the recipe and it worked very well. I used twice the tomatoes the recipe called for, because I wanted lots of sauce. And the leftovers tasted even better the next day.

I've got to agree with the last cook. Maybe I am a purist, but vindaloos are supposed to be spicy, and I've NEVER seen a good Indian recipe which utilizes curry powder! I used this one for chicken and found it lacking. I think I'll just use Madhur Jaffrey's pork vindaloo recipe (which says it can be used for lamb and beef but doesn't mention chicken) and see how that works!

Rating: 2
The review a few comments ago (from the gentleman/gentlewoman from England) is spot-on, I believe. For those who love vindaloo and are looking to recreate it in their kitchen, this isn't the place for it. The color alone should indicate something's not quite right. I've made this twice now, once as prescribed, and once with some authenticating twists, and the second time it was much better. For those looking for a good, spicy American-Indian (not to be confused with American Indian) dish, go for it. Just be sure that when you order vindaloo at your local Indian restaurant you know to expect something *very* different.

I agree with "A Cook." I make this dish as often as I can, and enjoy it each and every time. Sometime I use pork instead of chicken and the results are just as good. Who cares if it's authentic or not. Everyone I've made it for has loved it, and that's all that matters to me!

I have to agree with the reviewer from England, this is not a vindaloo by any stretch of the imagination. Which is not to say it isn't a decent way to prepare chicken thighs but if you're looking for an authentic vindaloo, (usually made with pork in Goa from where it originates) look up the recipe in Madhur Jaffrey's Indian Cooking.

This is a quick recipe but not desperately authentic. Olive oil is no substitute for ghee (purifeid butter) in Indian cooking, though it is healthier. There's no specific chilli type specified here either, though the heat which that provides is the key to vindaloo, the chilli was what the Portugese added to Indian cooking. And 'curry powder' covers a multitude of sins, serious curry cooks make their own. I've never before read a curry recipe that didn't mention corriander for example. Quick and cheerful then, but over-simplified, not real curry like we're priveledged to get in the UK these days.

Very yummy. I wish it were a bit more spicy like a traditional vindaloo but that doesn't distract from the fact that it has marvolous flavour. One thing though, olive oil for a curry? I used veg. oil.

I made this as part of an Indian supper for stressed out law students. It was a hit! I substituted black mustard for the yellow (in the name of authenticity; you can probably buy some from your local indian restaurant for a dollar) and did the long simmering in the oven, as I ran out of stove space. I also served the green curried vegetables on this site, and a chickpea dish that I made up. Naan from the Indian restaurant (hey, I am a stressed out law student too!), rice, and raita, and everyone enjoyed.

My husband thought this was a good one time meal and nicely told me not to make it again. He said it was too tangy and it smelled like gym socks. I didn't like it either... after standing over the "fumes" for 30 minutes or so, I was light headed. We both like curry, so I don't know why we didn't like it. Probably the smell or the ugly yellow color of the chicken.
