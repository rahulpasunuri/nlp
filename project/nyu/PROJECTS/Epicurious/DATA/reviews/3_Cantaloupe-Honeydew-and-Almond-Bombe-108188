This was quite a show-stopping recipe. It turned out very well and all my guests were both impressed and liked the flavor. I think that it was a pretty easy recipe for the kind of wow-factor it elicited. I was excited when mixing the ice cream, extract and nuts to have achieved a flavor that was very close to the elusive toasted almond bar that I used to get from the ice cream man.
