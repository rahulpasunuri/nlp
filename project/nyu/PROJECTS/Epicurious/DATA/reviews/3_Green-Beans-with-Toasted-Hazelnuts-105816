definitely a fast cook. I recommend preparing them absolutely last because they get cold as fast as they cook. I would also double the recipe because, although what it made was cold, it was gone in minutes, and there was only 4 of us.

Simple, FAST, and excellent. This is a great, versatile side dish.

Excellent "company" fare. Minimal work but big result. I'm making them again for Christmas!

It was okay. I would make again, but I'm sure there are better green bean combos.

I'm in the minority here, but my Thanksgiving guests (foodies all) agreed with me. There really wasn't that much flavor in this dish. I think I'll stick with my tried-and-true greem beans almondine in the future.

I thought I remembered reading this in Gourmet, but didn't have my magazine handy. I ended up forgetting the rice vinegar, but it still came out great. The nuts make a pretty autumn presentation sprinkled over the beans at the end.

BIG HIT in my house this year for Thanksgiving! Wonderful deviation from the standard green bean casserole. So easy, I fancy that I'll make these beans on a regular basis.

This was a huge hit with my dinner guests. I ended up sauteeing some shallots in the butter before adding the rest and it gave it a v.nice flavor.

A nice change from green beans with almonds.

Made this for Thanksgiving -- it was okay, no real flavor.
