This is a wonderful recipe. It is easy to prepare the night before and ready to bake in the morning. I freeze any leftovers in single serving size and microwave it when I want a serving. I use light cream instead of milk to add to the creaminess. I guess it also adds a few more calories but it is worth it!

Awesome concept, but my family didn't love the texture or taste of the actual recipe. Not enough bread for the amount of custard & too sugary, even for my 7-yr-old. Perhaps if the whole loaf of challah was used, that would be a better ratio of bread:custard, and we could certainly cut the sugar in half. However, since we love our go-to French toast recipe so much (from Alton Brown on the Food Network site -- also using challah, but sweetened with honey instead of sugar), we're going to try this method again but use Alton Brown's ingredients & quantities. Love that it can be put together the night before, and love that you don't have to wait in the morning for your oven to preheat -- saves time & I can do it while still waking up :) The baking time was perfect.

Nice, easy and basic - begs for variation! A little cinnamon, fresh ground nutmeg and some apple chunks tucked in here and there. YUM!

I would make this again only with modifications, as it's bland and eggy as is. Next time, I will: - put both rum and cinnamon in the custard - use 5 or 6 eggs instead of 7 - Add rum-soaked raisins to the bread pieces

My brunch guests loved this! I used 2 cups skim milk & 1/2 cup Half and Half. It was cooked in an Edge pan, and after taking it out of the oven, I poured maple syrup over the whole thing. Skipped the nuts. Everyone asked for the recipe.

Subbed in skim milk and egg whites. Added some maple syrup to the batter for more maple taste...light on the nutmeg. Cooking time was just right.

Great breakfast for Christmas Morning or NY morning! I put the maplesyrup and pecans in the bottom of the baking dish with some melted butter and layers thick slices of Challah bread dipped in the egg mixture then poured the remaining over the whole thing. When you cut servings out just flip them on the plate so the nuts and syrup are now on top!

Delicious and almost laughably easy. This might be my new go-to recipe for brunch. I served it with toasted pecans and a drizzle of can syrup instead of maple syrup. Would be outstanding with blueberries and I think I would even consider making mini versions for dessert and serving with chocolate sauce and raspberry puree.

Perfect Christmas morning breakfast. I skipped the pecans (by mistake) and added a little cinnamom and a dash of Framboise. Next time I will also add some raspberries.

This is a great breakfast dish. I've also made it 'stuffed' and added either bacon or frozen blueberries in the middle of two layers of bread. I also uncover it toward the end, sprinkle with some course sugar and then broil it for extra crunch on top.

This recipe was so easy and amazing. I made it for Father's Day brunch and my husband and two teenagers loved it. The best part is that you can put it together the night before and just pop it in the oven the next morning.

This recipe is incredibly eay and delicious. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly. It was great. I now substitute the 7 large eggs for one carton of egg substitute, use 1% milk and use 1/2 the sugar. The recipe is still terrific. I have served it to company for brunch, and my young children love it.

I made this for my office this morning and people really like it. I did three versions. 1) Orginal recipe, but added cinnamon. 2) Removed the Nutmeg and added OJ, Grand Marnier, and Orange Oil. 3) A health prep where I replacefed half the eggs with egg whites, non-fat milk, a high fiber, whole grain bread and half of the sugar as well as the orange prepartion. The favorite was the orange prepartion (non-healthy), but if you are craving something like this the healthy prep wa a great substitue.

I accidentally didn't read the recipe until the morning, and didn't have a chance to soak the challah at all. It was still delicious. I found it a little too sweet, and will try it with half the sugar next time.

I made this for a brunch item to take over to our friends. It was a hugh hit. So easy to make .. and DELICIOUS I did take the suggestions from the other reviews and really buttered the dish well. I also used cinnamon bread from our Publix bakery and omitted the sugar, added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla and of course raisans. I have made it several times and given out the receipe .. its that easy and that delicious! It puffs up and wow does it taste like a light bread pudding.. enjoy it .. : )

This was excellent. I made this for Christmas breakfast ( I did prep work the night before). Puffed up beautifully in the oven- I didn't butter the pan sufficiently so I had a little issue with sticking, but I will know better next time! You can also skip the toasted nuts, I don't think they are necessary.

Rating: 2
Perhaps this was not the kind of french toast I was in the mood for. It was too soft and blah. I added some more cinnamon, but it still needed more pep. Stuck the pan in the fridge and figured maybe it would be better the next day. I sliced it up, put a pat of butter in the frying pan and treated it like traditional slices of egg battered french toast - NOW THAT IS WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT! It was custardy on the inside and had a crisp crust on the outside - PERFECT. I may make this recipe again and do the same thing over again.

I was somewhat disappointed by this recipe, it was merely ok, but far from great, as suggested by other reviewers. The good thing is that it can be made in advance; still, you need an hour in the morning before breakfast to get it ready. I *would* make it again just because it's easy, but I am not expecting to wow anyone with it.

Yum! This is the one! We will make this again and again for Christmas morning. It takes all of 5 minutes to make the night before and is so delicious. The fact that it can go into a cold oven makes it even less work. You can pop it in and get going on gifts and then break when it is ready! PS I made mine with only 3 eggs and 1 Cup of egg beaters to save a bit on calories/cholesterol.

This was a perfect Christmas morning breakfast! It was easy to make the night before and pop in the oven (no waiting for it to preheat!) when I woke up in the morning. By the time everyone was up, the food was ready. It was great. A perfect, warm way to wake up on a cold Minnesota Christmas. The next day, I cut the leftovers into strips and pan-fried them in a little butter...delicious! This will definetely be an annual tradition.

We made this recipe twice over the holidays. It's easy since you make it ahead of time. It comes out of the oven golden brown and makes a great presentation. I added cinnamon to the egg mixture. Great for brunch or entertaining when you can't "watch" the oven.

I made this dish for Christmas day brunch also. I was a little worried that it would be bland but gave it a try as written. We all found it delightful, the flavours were subtle and didn't overpower the maple syrup and pecans. It was also so convenient to make it ahead and just pop it in the oven while I opened presents with the family. I will definitely make this one again, even my three year old twins ate two helpings!

I made this for Christmas morning family brunch. All loved it. I was unable to get egg bread (store was sold out), so I substituted a very moist raisin bread. everyone loved it. I skipped the pecans, since the pudding had raisins. the left-overs heated up great the next day in the microwave. will definately make this again.

I made this over the weekend and was very disappointed. It was bland and adding the maple syrup didn't make any improvements. It was a waste of very good challah bread. Maybe it would have helped if I added cinnamon and more sugar. I will not be making this again.

I thought that this receipe was AWESOME!!! My family thought the same. I love to bake, especially when its easy and this was definitely easy. I used potato bread and it came out VERY GOOD! I must've searched around the world and back for challah but I think because of the Jewish holiday, couldn't find it. So just to let you guys know, potato bread is just as good as challah. Recipe is easy and fun!

I served this dish on New Year's Day for brunch. It was very well received. However, my husband and I found it very bland. I would make it again with the following changes: add raisins, add cinnamon, consider adding orange zest and substitue brown sugar for the regular sugar. I guess I would bsically make it more into a bread puddimg. I'll let you know how it turns out with the changes.

I made this for Christmas breakfast. It was delicious and so easy because all the prep work was done the night before.

I'm making it again for New Year's brunch tomorrow.

To answer the Scottish cook, you can use any type of flaky, sweet bread that is made with egg. I've seen a lot of people use brioche or croissants in place of challah/egg bread. Something tells me you could find a plethora of brioche in France... Good luck!

An easy way to start Christmas morning. Throw a dish into a cold oven and my the time presents are open, breakfst is served! We all enjoyed this dish - with a caveat. After reading the article in B.A. I went with freshly grated nutmeg - not something I had done before. The "bite" of the nutmeg was a bit strong and detracted from what is usually a sweet dish. Even the addition of the maple syrup didn't soften the flavor. The texture was excellent (even better two days later!) I will definitely make this again but will either cut down the amount of fresh nutmeg or fall back to already ground.

I made this for Christmas Brunch and got rave reviews. One person said that he didn't like French Toast but tried it anyway and said it was FABULOUS. His wife said she's going to make it for "Breaking The Fast" during the Jewish holidays....what a great dish for the Jewish faith during their special holiday, too! My sister has a Christmas Brunch in Delaware asked that I e-mail the recipe to her too.....what a nice, easy dish to make for all holiday brunches.

This was a wonderful recipe. I did add a few dried currants and some cinnamon, since I enjoy both of those ingredients. It was a nice addition. As for the confrontational tone, there is a phrase that's appropriate here -- "Before speaking (or typing) consider: Is it true, is it kind, is it necessary." Merry Christmas and happy holidays to all.

Here's a twist for a really decadent use for the leftovers (if any!) In New Orleans, where French Toast is called "Lost Bread" and bread pudding is a staple we sometimes serve up a little "Prodigal Pudding" for breakfast by cutting a thin slice of a really dense pudding such as this one and sauteeing it one more time in a non-stick skillet (maybe with a little butter) just until the outer layers are crispy. Serve as you would French Toast, or try a little warmed-over whiskey sauce instead of the standard maple syrup and the bread which was lost has been found again! (Don't tell your cardiologist.)

12 oz. of bread is 3/4 of a pound of bread. It's more precise to measure bread by weight than by anything else. Slices vary in weight, and cubic inches vary in weight depending on bread density.

Do NOT cut the eggs or substitute whites. Rather, don't make the dish. This is a wonderful custard bread pudding, and the sweet bread is a perfect choice. Also, instead of cutting the sugar, cut out the syrup - not really needed. Instead of syrup, try a Creme Anglais and flavor it with brandy or Myers rum instead of vanilla.

Sounds like what I served this morning, but made with slightly stale (homemade) cranberry/walnut bread! But I think seven eggs are overkill. A hint: Substitute two egg whites for one egg yolk and keep the yolks to about half the number recommended (i.e., try three whole eggs, six egg whites) and lose the sugar. The syrup is enough. My husband said it was a real hit!

Wonderful! Made this for a holiday brunch and it was a huge hit. This recipe makes the firm type of pudding that you can cut into squares (vs. the custardy kind). Flavor was lovely -- I mixed maple syrup with soft butter to create a spread so that syrup wouldn't leak onto other buffet dishes. Will make again for sure.
