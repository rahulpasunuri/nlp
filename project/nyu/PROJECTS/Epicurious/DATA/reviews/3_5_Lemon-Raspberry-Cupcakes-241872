I made these cupcakes without the jam center and they were delicious. They have a very light crumb and a subtle lemon flavor. My cupcakes puffed up on top (I would skip self-raising flour next time and add my own raising agents) so I was not able to do the glaze as I had planned. I made a lemon buttercream instead and the combination was lovely.

This recipe turned out awesome!! I would say the best part about it was the cupcakey part itself. It was light and fluffy and lemoney and perfect! The texture made them look like cupcakes you would see in an ad. Also, I figured out that with the icing, less is more. Putting too much just makes it look messy and makes the already tart cupcake just TOO tart. I would recommend shooting for the amount in the picture or even a little less, especially considering that the cupcake has plenty of flavor already.

My jam also sunk to the bottom (Smucker's seedless red raspberry, placed on top of about 2/3 of the cake batter) but they taste good! Made exactly 12. We sprinkled a couple white candy pearls on top, and they look pretty. I just wish I had been more careful about the quantity and placement of the glaze on each one. I'm a little bit lopsided.

Easy recipe and it made exactly 12. Followed advice of other reviewers regarding more batter at the bottom, and less jam, and they turned out perfect. Did not make the icing though. Will definitely make this again.

Tastes Quite Good. I would Like To Have Them Again, But They Make More Than Promised. I Would Cut The Recipe By Half Next Time.

These are delightful. However, I added more lemon and lemon zest to the batter to get a more tart batter. Also, there is plenty of batter for 14+ cupcakes! I took everyone's advice and added a healthy dollop to the bottom, and just covered the jam on top. With just a dozen, I didn't have to scrape the bowl. The cakes overflowed while baking. Still tasty, even though they're not as pretty.

I thought these were wonderful cupcakes. I did NOT put the jam in prior to baking. I just piped some into the middles with a pastry bag when they cooled down. Frosted with a lemon buttercream frosting, finished off with lemon zest and a fresh raspberry on top. Have piped lemon curd into the middle, frosted and garnished with crushed lemon drop candies too for a different take on it.

These cupcakes are always an office and gathering favorite! I usually bake them with a pan of water below to increase the moistness and I add the jam as soon as I take them out of the oven. Definitely worth trying!

Rating: 3
These cupcakes turned about great! I followed the recipe almost exactly, except adding a little bit more batter to the bottom, after reading some of the reviews. The jam i used still sunk through to the bottom, but they still tasted great. I even had extra better to make a few mini cupcakes. I thought the icing was delicious, but had to add a little bit more lemon juice, and a splash of butter milk because it was very thick. Bottom line, i would make these again!

Rating: 4
I loved these cupcakes! I made half the batch as mini cupcakes, and used a pastry bag to put the batter in the liners. I put most of the batter in the bottom. I used local highbush cranberry jelly in some of them and Oregon grape jelly in the others, wonderful. Great, moist cake. I made a very lemony buttercream for the icing. I think these are great as minis -- very rich, especially with buttercream.

Rating: 0
I really liked these cupcakes. They are very pretty with the raspberry on top. I made them twice and the second time I put in a really heaping tablespoon of batter before adding the jam and only cooked them for about 20 minutes, which both worked better for me. Also, I made buttercream frosting to put on them instead of the glaze, which is quite good if you want something a little more rich.

Rating: 4
These are so delicious. It almost tastes like a lemon pound cake? And the jam in the middle is so yummy. Very sweet and you can definitely taste the lemon and raspberry in them. I had no problems with the jam sinking or anything like that! I'll be making this again! So good.

Rating: 4
Delicious and very pretty. I added extra lemon zest and lemon juice and didn't cook them quite as long as directed. Other reviews are right - put 2/3 batter in the cups before you add the jam to avoid sinkage, and don't be too generous with the jam.

I'm looking into making these, but I don't really want a "filling" in mine. Do you think I could just add the jam in with the batter and pour it in that way?

YUM YUM YUM. These were delectable! I couldn't find seedless raspberry jam so I used one with seeds and that was fine. The frosting is wonderful with the jam, I didn't make any plain lemon frosting. Nothing beats a fresh raspberry on top for garnish.

I have made these cupcakes many times, always in a double batch, and always receive compliments. They are moist, lemony and really festive looking for a spring or summer party. I add extra lemon zest because I'm a lemon fiend. I read the other reviews about the jam sinking -- if you use a good quality seedless jam, add the ingredients according to the directions (so the batter ends up with a fluffy consistency), and cover the bottom with a good layer of batter, it should avoid this problem.

Loved, loved these cupcakes. I used my own homemade plum cherry jam in the cupcakes and in the glaze. You really only need to make 1/2 or less of the glaze recipe, 1/2 teaspoon spread on the top of each cupcake is enough.

I made these once and they were OK, then made again and they were kind of gross, too much butter (though I cut it down per other reviewers) and they were really crumbly.

I just made these to bring to my last class ever in law school and I wish I had read the reviews first to adjust the recipe for dryness. I also didn't realize all purpose flour & self rising were different. My cupcakes didn't rise but they still taste good- minus the dryness issue. I didn't have an issue with the jam sinking and I stuck with about 1 tsp give or take. I also drastically reduced the sugar used in the frosting to more like half of what is called for and generally found my cupcakes too pale in color for hte yellow frosting to look as pretty on them as they do in the photo. I would make these again, but with some changes.

Rating: 3
I just made these for a book club and they were a hit. I took other reviewers' suggestions and added 1/2-2/3 batter to the muffin cups before adding 1/2 tsp. raspberry jam. I almost didn't have enough batter to cover the jam, but the batter beneath rose nicely during the baking to cover the jam no problem. Also, I could not find self-rising flour anywhere and so made my own: per 1C all-purpose flour add 1.5 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt.

Rating: 2
I liked the lemon flavor but found that grating 4 1/2 teaspoons lemon peel was too labor intensive for the end result. The cake batter didn't seem dense enough to hold the jam in the middle. Glaze frosting wasn't wet enough to mix as the recipe reads. I added about 1T. milk to the frosting in order just to stir it.

Rating: 0
I agree that the frostin was much too sweet. Next time I would like to try putting in half the sugar, jam, and adding real raspberries. I only had strawberry jam on hand and used that, but added rapsberries in the frosting. I glazed each cupcake with the frosting and then baked them for ten more minutes. I also took people's advice on just putting in half the jam in the middle and it turned out well. I am getting great reactions from everyone at the office. This recipe is a four fork one... but not as is.

Rating: 2
These were good (two forks is for 'Good' by the way) and I'd make again with changes. I followed the recipe precisely and my jam sank to the bottom.... But I found that I actually preferred it without the jam at all. So, next time I'd make these without the jam in the cake or in the icing. The cupcakes with the plain lemon icing were sweet enough. I'd love to try this in the future with a better quality/not as sweet fruit filling but I really would need to play with the sweetness. The jam made this too sweet for my tastes.

My 12 year old daughter has made these twice so they are easy to make, even though they taste fancy. They are quite possibly the best cupcakes I have ever had. They are more like a poundcake or some other wonderful dessert than a common fluffy "American" style cupcake. Perfection!

My cupcakes separated into 3 sections: oil at the bottom that obliterated the paper liner, jam, and then all the batter at the top. As beautiful as they looked on the magazine cover, unfortunately mine came out more like a cup of mush rather than a cupcake.

These are delicious! I ran out of lemon zest so I had to change the recipe a little. For the cake I used 2 tablespoons of lemon zest and 1 tablespoon of clementine zest. Then I made vanilla butter cream icing instead of the lemon raspberry icing. I would highly recommend this recipe and this variation.

These were ok -- the jam sank to the bottom even though I filled the liners with most of the batter before adding the jam. The glaze is delicious, but the jam made it a strange brown/red color, so I ended up using a little red food color to make it pinker.

needed more batter below the jam in the middle. otherwise delicious

i was looking for a shortcut so i made these with storebought lemon supreme cake mix. but, after putting the jam 2/3 of the way up in the batter, it still sunk. i considered injecting the next batch with the jam after baking but have since decided that these are delicious even without the jam filling. use the cake mix for 24 cupcakes and make icing with 3 cups powdered sugar, 4 tbsp lemon juice, 3 tsp lemon zest, and 3 tbsp raspberry jam and they will still impress!

This was a good recipe, but not sure if I'd make it for company. They were very tasty, but mine were pale even though they were completely done. I followed the advice of others and put 2/3rds or more of the batter in, then added the jam, and topped with a little more batter. The jam was in the middle.

Horrible. The jam was all on the bottom when they came out of the oven. Self rising flour may be the problem. I'd suggest using baking powder. Even if the jam hadn't sunk, I'd never make these again. The cake and the jam were way too sweet. Unless you like your desserts really really sweet, don't make these. There are better cupcakes out there.

I amde a few batches of these and gave them away as gifts in adorable wilton cupcake boxes that were pink and matched the frosting. Luckily I read the reviews after the first batch and I reduced the butter. I also put the jam at the top of the cupcake and when it baked it sunk just enough and the batter rising around it concealed it. Worked perfectly. I have had many requests for these cupcakes so I will definitely make them again.

The texture of this cupcake is perfect! Really velvety and moist. We didn't have seedless raspberry jam so I substituted plum jam (which is very jelly-like) and it was delicious. I also added more lemon zest than the recipe called for.

These were some of the easiest most tasty cupcakes I have made in a long time. I used regular raspberry preserves made fresh from a farm, with seeds and all. And they came out wonderful! The preserve worked great in the frosting too! I wouldn't be too concerned about using seedless. I did add a little extra fresh lemon juice to the frosting for consistency. But the teaspoon of preserve worked perfect and I didn't get it seeping through. I guess just use you judgment on how you place the preserve on the batter. But I highly recommend this recipe!

These were pretty fabulous. The lemon flavor of the cake was perfect, though i found it got a little dry after about 12 hours. I sort of screwed up though, I put in a tablespoon of jam in each instead of a teaspoon, which turned out to be a perfect fix for the slightly dry cakes, but also prevented any hope of eating it like a normal cupcake. The icing is quite as colorful as it is in the pictures. I ended up adding a few drops of yellow food coloring and a bit extra jam to liven them up.

Yummy! I didn't have any problems with the jam sinking. I did put in most of the batter first, followed by the jam, then the last little bit of batter. The jam wound up pretty much in the middle. I used jam with seeds because that's what I had, and nobody seemed to mind--the icing just wasn't quite as pretty. Otherwise I made them exactly as written and they were easy and very well received. Resist the urge to ice them if they're even a little warm still, or the icing will spread too much and not look as nice.

I loved these cupcakes! Inspired by the pretty picture on the cover,I made the cupcakes on whim and brought them in to work. Everyone who got to have one, loved them. Unlike some of the reviewers, I did not have a problem with the jam sinking to the bottom. I put the jam high in the cupcake and made sure that the batter was pressed all the way to the sides of the wrapper before putting in the dollop of jam. I am not much of a baker and was pleasantly surprised how well they turned out.

Overall, the cupcakes are quite good. I followed previous suggestions and cut down the butter to 1/2 cup. The cakes were light with great texture and very tasty. I didn't give them 4 stars because the jam fell to the bottom. I placed the jam very close to the top as well and it still fell to the bottom. This seems to be an oversight of the test kitchen. I can't imagine none of the jam fell to the bottom in their test kitchen--especially since nearly all of the previous bakers on here had the same problem. Perhaps the recipe wasn't tested well enough or the flour is too light to support the jam. I used King Arthur cake flour. Perhaps with all-purpose flour the jam won't sink but you will lose some of the light crumbly texture. Overall, they are a great cupcakes and everyone enjoyed them.

These were fabulous. But my only complaint was not spraying the muffin pan. Some of the cupcakes rose above the tin, and then stuck to the top of the pan. They were goners - as they are so delicate they just pulled apart. Fortunately I had made a double batch, so still had plenty. I added more lemon juice to the frosting to get the right consistency. I also added jam to it all, as the pink frosting was prettier than just the lemon. These looked beautiful!! Just like the picture!

I read all the reviews prior to baking these cupcakes and finally got it right on my second attempt! I live in Denver, so I constantly face baking challenges in this high altitude. To keep my cupcakes from sinking, I reduced the sugar by 3 tablespoons, added 1/2 cup all-purpose flour with 3/4 cup self-rising, and cooked the cupcakes at 370 degrees for 22 minutes. I found stirring the jam prior to dropping it helped keep it from sinking (maybe because it's not as dense?) to the bottom, however it did sink a bit. Very tasty cupcakes - plan to take to my book club next weekend

I started this with a little bit of trepidation about butter and jam sinkage, having read the reviews, but decided to go ahead with it as written. The only changes I made were using organic all-purpose flour and 100% fruit raspberry jam with seeds. I put half the batter in each cup before a big dollop of jam and the rest of the batter. My jam didn't sink, which was nice. The cupcakes taste wonderful - I don't like lemon much, and these were only lightly lemony and very sweet and raspberry-y. I liked the crunch that the seeds added, and the glaze was just the right amount of topping - regular icing would have been too much I think. I took these to an impromptu picnic with my friends at the park, and they were a big hit, just the right occasion for them. : ) ...My one complaint is that I did find the cupcakes greasy, so next time I will put less butter in, as some other reviewers suggest. But there will be a next time!

I doubled the recipe on these, and I had no problems with sinkage. I did, however, feel that the cupcakes weren't lemony enough. I added some extra lemon juice as well as some lemon extract, and all of a sudden, POW! Perfectly lemony! Not delicate in flavor; however, the jam in the middle helped to temper it a little bit. The contrast turned out perfect, as did the glaze. With the changes, a 4-fork recipe.

I don't know why this recipe has 4 forks. Then again, I did double the recipe, so that may have added to the issues I experienced. Like other reviewers, I omitted a third of the butter, and filled the cups 3/4 of the way before adding the jam and covering with batter. And, like others, the jam sunk to the bottom on many of the cupcakes. Flavors were good, but it just was not outstanding. Maybe I'll give it another try if I see other suggestions about improving the recipe.

I made these cupcakes on Easter and they were delectable little morsels. However, I will use a creamier icing next time instead of the sugar glaze to add some texture. I added the raspberry jam on top and covered it with a small dollop of batter before baking. The jam does sink a bit, but it's still very good! Cut out 1/4 c of butter and use a fluffier icing. Voila!

I made these for Easter dinner using blackberry jam instead of raspberry. I had read the prior reviews and used 1/2 cup butter, which still resulted in a moist cupcake. I filled the cupcake liners 3/4 way before putting in the jam and it seemed to work well. I loved the icing too - not too rich like so many other cupcake recipes (but still decadent enough!)

I made these for Easter. After reading the reviews, I put the jam on top, thinking it would sink some to prevent sinking all the way to the bottom. But it didn't sink at all and came out a mess on top! So the second batch, I put the jam in the middle and the jam stayed in place and didn't sink at all, making them perfect. I also used 1/2 cup of butter instead of 3/4 cup.

Unfortunately I made these before I read the reviews or I would have cut back on the butter. I also think that it might be better to inject the jam after the cupcakes are baked and cooled. I tried to push the jelly into the batter but it did not help. They do taste light and airy though.

Taking into account the previous reviews, I cut the butter down from 3/4 cup to 1/2 cup. The result was a deliciously light and fluffy cupcake. I also divided the batter so that 3/4 went in first, then the jam, then the final 1/4. While the jam did reach the bottom of the cupcake, it was also spread throughout, not solely on the bottom. I also made a variation using blackberry jam, and blackberries on top. Both were superb, and I will definitely make these again.

I'm making these for a baby shower this weekend, so I haven't made them , yet. After reading the review, I search for other filled cupcakes as to when you should fill them. What I found is to place the jam on top of the batter once you've filled the paper as it will fall and the cake will rise. This would place the jam in the middle. I'll report as soon as I've made them.
