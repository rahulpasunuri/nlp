These were difficult to make (hard to get enough cheese into the olives) and too salty. So salty that I ate one, offered one to my roommate and then tossed the rest into the trash. I used pitted green olives purchased fresh from the olive bar at Whole Foods and rinsed them well. I also used Maytag blue cheese. Maybe this would work with a less salty cheese, but these were inedible. The recipe here for olives stuffed with chili almonds is much, much better.

Made these for a party last weekend and they were a hit! The only change I made was to use panko bread crumbs, which provided a wonderfully crispy outside. Ohhhhh soooo good! I could have sworn I saw a review advising not to use the pre-stuffed blue cheese olives, but I'm not finding it now. I would really advise against taking the easy way out. Part of what makes these so delicious is the crispness of the olive and of course, the crispy coating. If you use the pre-stuffed olives, they're not going to have that texture. Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!!

I made this for a party one night and forgot my olives at the store. Luckily I had two jars of Penna blue cheese stuffed olives, and they saved the day. I don't know how this recipe tastes with the other olives but this made it simple and the taste was amazing. I buy right at their farm but you can get them online at GreatOlives.com Thank you for the great recipe!

Made this for a cocktail party and they were the first thing gone. I found that it is very important to keep the blue cheese chilled while stuffing the olives as it began to soften. I'd suggest working in small batches: cut the cheese into strips to fit into the olives and then place most of it back in the fridge while you work. A great salty compliment to cocktails!

These lovely little olives are a HIT each time I make them. In fact, I just had a friend ask me to make these olives as a birthday present to him. The process is a bit time consuming, but worth every last nibble of time. Yum!

Unusual but really great. Next time I will stuff with more cheese.

Maybe it was the olives I used, but this was really unappetizing. It was so so salty that I had to choke down the second one. My husband had two, too, and then we threw the rest out. What a waste! Too bad. I really wanted to like these.

This dish is similar to one that my favorite restaurant makes, except they use anchovies instead of blue cheese (which is surprisingly good!). I would definitely add something spicy, like cayenne, to the breadcrumbs.

My husband has made this recipe twice. Both times our guests have asked for the recipe. Big hit. Next time we may try chili powder (ancho?) or smoked paprika in mixed the bread crumbs.
