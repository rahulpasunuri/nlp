This tasted weird. I should have known better than to go off the family standard: pitted cherries, sugar, cornstarch (mixed with water), ALMOND EXTRACT, and kirsch.

I've been making Cherries Jubilee for 20 years based on a recipe I saw in a restaurant in Spokane, WA. I use 1 Tsp butter, heat the juice separate from the cherries so that they do not water down the sauce and use cornstarch to thicken it. I also add a couple dashes of cinnamon as my spice. I serve it warm and let it melt the ice cream.

Very simple and straightforward is correct as stated in the prior interview; in fact too much so. The brown sugar does not dissolve into the butter. There is an inbalance there. Later to thicken the sauce (we used fresh cherries), we resorted to a little cornstarch mixed w water. Cooling it so as not to melt the ice cream is important. Guests liked it, and the leftovers were excellent.

Very simple and straightforward recipe. Some notes: While the instructions indicated that the brown sugar dissolves into the butter, it doesn't actually dissolve, per se. Added 1 tsp of vanilla. They did miss the whole schtick of lighting the brandy. Also, this seemed to call for far too little brandy, so we doubled it.
