I used homemade fish stock in place of clam juice. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I served it over a salmon souffle. My husband raved about it and said I should open a restaurant. I replied that is too much work, but I will make this dill sauce again.

Made exactly as written. Exceptionally easy to make. Has great flavors. Served with a panko & herb crusted fresh halibut that was sauted in extra virgin olive oil. The accompanyment was fresh potato & steamed vegetables. this was an elegant & yet easy to make main entree.

mmmmmm......I made this as written (with creme fraiche) and served over goat cheese beet risotto and a single pan seared scallop. It was rich, savory, and perfect for our elegant New Year's eve dinner party.

Great sauce for both vegetarian and meat dishes :)A similiar recipe, but with yogurt instead of crème fraîche or whipping cream is very popular in Bulgaria. For best results, use regular plain yogurt. The low-fat and non-fat variety will make the sauce too thin.
