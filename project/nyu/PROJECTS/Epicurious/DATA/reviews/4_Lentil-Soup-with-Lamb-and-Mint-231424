This was a good recipe but I thought it was pretty bland. In place of the parsnips I used carrots. To give it more flavor I increased the cumin by another teaspoon, added red pepper flakes, salt & black pepper. I did use all the mint. Served with dollop of sour cream. The following day I added about 1 tsp of Garam Masala and that added the depth of flavor that was missing. It's a good solid recipe and I wouldn't hestitate to make it again.

Yummy stuff. And easy. Made almost exactly as called for. Used a whole pound of lentils (bought a one pound bag - why not?), used probably half of the cumin (and it was still pretty strong), and hit the soup pot a couple times with an immersion blender.

this soup is AMAZING. i used carrots and chunks of sweet potatoes instead of parsnips. the mint makes this a really exceptional dish. the blending at the end is important too!

This is going to sound a little odd but I made this soup for my daughter on the recommendation of her caregiver. I was looking for a soup that contained carrot, lamb and tomato to counterbalance her "cold" body type (part of traditional Chinese medicine) - with a little tweak, this soup was just what I needed. I used a very low-sodium beef broth and found it a little bland (also omitted the cumin from some soup that I set aside for her) but over all, it was tasty and easy to prepare and hopefully, it will deliver other benefits to my little girl as well!

I made this using four carrots instead of the 2 parsnips suggested. And.... I had 2 cups of lamb stock I added along with 5 cups of beef broth to get the right amount of broth. Absolutely delicious!!!

One other thing I did was use a single-blade hand mixer and just put it in the main pot for about 30 seconds. I think takikng two cups out and putting them into a blender to puree is just a lot more mess than it is worth and I'm guessing a few bursts of the hand mixer in the pot has the same effect.

I think this is a wonderful winter-to-spring transition stew. It has a lovely flavor really enhanced by the subtle mint and tangy parsnips. Really wonderful taste combinations that complemented the unique flavor of the lamb. The next time I make it I might add some cilantro.

A little bland, but solid recipe. Used 16oz lentils, would add some salt. Great lamb taste.

Very flexible recipe as you will see from all my changes. Mint and cumin provide a subtle, excellent flavor. I made the following changes: 1) used leftover diced lamb so did not add til soup was cooked; 2) deleted olive oil, sprayed pan and vegetables and garlic w/oil to saute 3) used 1# lentils and a combination of lamb and beef broth (approx. 5 14oz cans); 4) added salt and pepper to taste.

This soup is really extraordinary and adaptable. I've added every sort of vegetable I have in the refrigerator (sliced broccoli stems!!) as well as spicy kielbasa. It freezes really well. The mint is a critical addition!

I made the recipe exactly as stated and found it to be delicious. The mint makes it! The only question I had was the type of lentils intended; I used French lentils du Puy. They have more bite, even when fully cooked. Red lentils might reduce to mush after 40 minutes.

This is a quick, easy, hearty, tasty soup for lunch and dinner. I cooked and drained the lamb before adding the other ingredients. The mint is perfect--just enough to taste but not overwhelming.

I just made this soup vegan! Omitted the lamb and added a squeeze of lemon at the end....awesome!

Pros: a good basic and flexible recipe that can easily be modified - change the spices to make it a different ethnic taste (Italian, Indian, Greek, etc...). Can also be done in 1 pot -- easy prep, easy cleanup. Cons: Very, very greasy because the recipe does not drain the oil from the ground lamb. Also the veggies turn mushy. Like other reviewers, I modified it to give it more flavor and to remove the grease. My mods included adding carrots, sweet potatoes because I had it on hand, and lots of spices: Garam Masala, crushed hot pepper, curry powder, Vindaloo (a spicy Indian blend). After cooking completely, I spent 10 minutes skimming the thick layer of grease that was on the top. Next time, though I would cook the lamb separately. And DRAIN all of the oil out before adding to the Lentil soup. I would also add the veggies (carrots, celery, parsnips, sweet potato) AFTER the lentils -- about 5-10 minutes before the lentils are done. And either reduce the amount of lamb, or increase the amount of veggies and lentils to make it a bit healthier.

I am giving this four forks because it does a perfect job at being what it is: a fast, tasty, filling, inexpensive, no-fuss weeknight meal that makes tons of freezable leftovers. My tweaks: I used all the veggies called for but added 2 carrots as well. The store only had .85 lb ground lamb left, but that was plenty. I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes with the cumin, used a box of Pomi diced tomatoes and a 32 oz box of beef broth plus 24 ounces of water. We like thicker soup, so I didn't add any more water. I skipped the pureeing part. The mint is great and not overpoweringly "minty" at all. Don't leave it out! Yummy.

Amazing. The whole family, including my 3 year old loved it. I used chunks of lamb shoulder, only one parsnip, added some carrots. I only had cumin seed, so added that rather than ground. I added the fresh mint which in my opinion makes the recipe! Also topped with a dollop of plain yogurt. It makes a lot, and we have been eating it for two days. Tonight I will serve it on rice to finish it off. This will become a regular recipe since it is tasty, healthy, econonical, and easy to make.

Excellent! Used yellow lentils and ground turkey instead of lamb. It requires more than 40 mins to cook.

This is one of the best soups I've ever made. It's always a big hit with guests. I usually use lamb stew meat and red lentils rather than the ground lamb and the regular lentils. The red lentils give the soup a beautiful color.

Good hearty stew. Great for leftover lamb roast. Made broth from lamb bones instead of beef broth. Left out mint and parsnips and added black pepper. The black pepper adds complexity to the soup.

This stew is now a staple in the wintertime for my family. Make with some buttermilk buscuits for a side and your going to get all the ohhhs and ahhhs your looking for. I make the recipe exactly as written exept for adding Yam and ommitting the blender...I like it as chunky as possible.

This is a very solid recipe. I have made it with lamb and with ground beef and it was good with both. We did not add mint.

This is a solid recipe. Not incredible, but very good and pretty nutritious. I didn't use the mint.

I don't particularly care for mint so I eliminated the mint and stirred in about 5 chopped plum tomatoes at the end. Also, during cooking I added a teaspoon of Garam Marsala and a quarter teaspoon of red chile pepper flakes. Put a dollop of plain non-fat yogurt in the soup when serving. Delicious!

This was a great dish for a snowy Connecticut afternoon. I used the meat left from my Christmas leg of lamb and the soup turned out perfect.

I hate to be a dissenter but while this soup was fine and very eatable it didn't send me. It had very little depth of flavor and I'm not sure how to remedy that.

I love this soup! Sometimes I make it as is, and sometimes I make a more Italian version where I omit the mint and double the tomatos. Yum!

Will definitely make this recipe again. I kind of took all the ingredients (except for the mint) and threw them into a pot without really paying attention to the measurements. I used lamb chops, and a big can of tomatos. Turned out great though and my hubby, that loves lentils and lamb, whole heartedly agrees.

This will definitely become a staple dish at my household. It is quick, easy and unusual flavors. Great combination. I did substitute japanese eggplant for the parsnips.
