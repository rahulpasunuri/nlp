Made these for valentine's day, exactly as written, and they came out perfect! What a treat. Basically, this is pate-a-Chou piped into hot oil. I would not try to make these without a stand mixer. Not for unskilled cooks, as you can tell by the reviews.

Outstanding! However, after reading the comments about the batter being to wet/soft for some I adjusted the eggs to 3, because I only had jumbo eggs on hand and thought that might have been the issue for the others. They were perfect, beautiful and very tasty. I will be making them again soon.

Yummy! I made this recipe as written - had no problem with the batter being too soft. And I agree, a little cinnamon in the batter would help the flavor.

I added some (1/2 tsp about) cinnamon to the batter per other reviews. The batter was so runny I couldn't work with it, even after it sat for an hour. I ended up adding an extra 1/2 cup flour before the churros would even hold their shape. They had a good flavor, but I think the extra flour made them a little duller than I'd like. I will try this again, but was expecting a little better.

Batter was softer then it should be but they were good and my family liked them:)

Very tasty, the dough is just like the dough used in pop-overs. So if you dont want all the oil, bake them in a muffin pan, the taste will be the same without all the oil.

I just served the churros at a Christmas party - the guests piped their own churros into the hot oil. Rave reviews were heard from everyone. It's a keeper.

This recipe totally exceeded my expectations. Next time, I may try the trick of putting some cinnamon in the batter and a little less salt in the coating. I really couldn't believe how un-fake these were...

These came out great after the following few modifications: 1) Add a bit of cinnamon to the batter (otherwise it's too much like a pancake flavor), and be sure to thoroughly beat out any lumps with the electric mixer. 2) The closed-tip star piping is really the key to this coming out properly! Without that added surface area, they come out as mushy tubes. 3) Make sure to cinnamon-and-sugar them immediately after coming out of the oil so it sticks properly.

These tasted almost as good as traditional churros from a spanish churro stand. Without a proper churreira to pipe them with, you'll need to make sure you have a very closed star tip on your pastry bag to make the ridges deep enough to have enough surface area to seal these quickly. You may need your oil slightly hotter (360-370) as well. Otherwise, this recipe was great. Anyone expecting a fake, american theme park treat will be disappointed. Purists who are trying to recreate the taste they savoured on vacation in Madrid will be deeply satisfied.

We were snowed in today, and we tried these. They were wonderful...the kids loved them! Incredibly easy! We did add a little cinnamon to the batter, since one reviewer said they were bland.

These won't taste like a churro that you'd find in a theme park. While my husband liked them, I found them to be quite bland overall. The dough itself tasted like nothing, and you could forget about trying to eat them once they had cooled down. I was just hoping it would taste like a churro from Disneyland.

This recipe is wonderful. I have never made it that people didn't beg me for the recipe. Perfect for the end of a mexican meal!

Something went very wrong for me while attempting this recipe. The batter was reminiscent of making pate chou, of which I've made countless times before. The first batch browned too quickly. The second batch was looking good until I noticed that the sides of the churros had begun to split. However I continued to fry them for the recommended time, pulled them from the oil, and into the cinnamon sugar. They immediately deflated and in the taste test they were mealy-texured and undercooked. Also did not like the saltiness of the cinnamon sugar mixture. Very disappointing.

I tried this recipe when it first came out and it is VERY good. My family loved them and I will definitely make them again.
