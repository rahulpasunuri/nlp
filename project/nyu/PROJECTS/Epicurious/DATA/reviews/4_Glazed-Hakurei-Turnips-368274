We had the hakurei turnips from Chino Farms here near San Diego. This recipe is perfect for them; usually I just eat them raw as they are so sweet and crips.

I used medium-sized red turnips, quartered. More water was needed as the beets took about 10 minutes longer to cook, but the sweet glaze was a great complement to the spicy turnip taste, and the presentation was striking.

This recipe was amazing. We used organic easter egg radishes and purple-topped turnips...the radishes and turnips taste like pure candy with the glaze and is complimented by the savory radish and turnip greens. Can't wait to make it again.
