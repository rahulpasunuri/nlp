This is flavorful and healthy. I hadn't made it for a few years, but had made batches of pesto and remembered this soup. This time I had a 28 oz. can diced tomatoes on hand, so used those and reduced the water. My in-laws loved it and requested the recipe.

perfect comfort food- skipped the pistou and just loved all the taste from the veggies- added one carton of chicken broth after i over boiled.

I used 4 cups of chicken stock in place of the water. i would use it or vegetable stock again and cut back on the amount of additional water. i also added a dash of vinegar towards the end.

I would definitely make this soup again. It was easy and extremely flavorful.

After preparing and testing Paula Wolfert's recipe (with a Ratatouille base) nothing comes close. It took me about six hours but it was completely worthwhile.
