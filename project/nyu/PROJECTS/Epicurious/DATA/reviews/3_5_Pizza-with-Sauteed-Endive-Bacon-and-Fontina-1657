We were amazed by the depth of flavor imparted by three key ingredients. Loved how the smoky bacon, nutty cheese and sharp endive worked together! We will absolutely make this pizza again and, as previously suggested, try these toppings tossed with penne pasta.

Great balance of flavors. The endive with the parmesan and lemon and bacon is wonderful.

This was sooo good- I could have eaten the topping over pasta or by itself. I used extra thick cut bacon.

Amazing! Use quality bacon and real Italian Fontina Val d'Aosta, and this pizza is sublime. Caution though: the endive topping remains very hot for a while out of the oven.

This is a very good combination of flavors. I did substitute the endive for radicchio like some of the other reviewers. I also added a small amount of caramalized onions. Do try this recipe!!

I must admit that it drives me nuts when people say, "I changed this, this and that, and here's my opinion of the recipe...". However, I'm going to be one of those people. On this particular recipe, I did substitute prosciutto for the bacon, because I was in the unusual position of having a surplus of the Italian ham in my fridge. That said, it was wonderful. And my husband said, "I think it would be even better with bacon, but it was great this way, too." I used more meat than the recipe called for (about 3/4 cup chopped before I rendered it in the pan), and the recommended 6 heads of endive. (Though I must admit I ate probably 20% of the topping out of the pan because it was so good!) Yum!

I also substituted the endive for radicchio and really liked the results. For the pizza crust, I bought small pita rounds. I brushed one side with olive oil and placed them on a hot skillet for 30 to 45 seconds. Then, I topped my pitas and put them under the broiler.

Great pizza recipe. Loved the combination of fontina cheese with bacon and a bitter greens (I actually used radicchio instead of endive, which worked very well.) I think you can up the amount of bacon a bit, and reduce the amount of endive/radicchio a bit. I also added some thinly sliced baby portabello mushrooms which I think added a nice earthiness to the dish. But it's the fontina that makes it. This dish would be nearly as good with mozzarella, etc.

This pizza is a winner. The slight bitterness of the endive combines with the salty textures of fontina and bacon to produce a pizza topping that must be tasted to believe. You may have to explain belgian endive to your friends, but it's worth it!
