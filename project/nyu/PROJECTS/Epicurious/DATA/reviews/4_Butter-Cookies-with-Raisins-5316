Made them with chopped dried cherries and some chopped walnuts I had lying around. They are very nice...not too sweet, a melt-in-your-mouth type of cookie. Be careful not to overcook them! This is a very thin cookie. Remove from oven at the *SLIGHTEST* sign of golden brown color around the edges.

This is one of the easiest cookie recipes i've ever seen and it comes free with great results! I added dried cranberries and chopped walnuts in lieu of raisins. I am so impressed!

They were light, delicious, not at all greasy and versitle! Raisins is wonderful! But dried cherries, blueberries, or some toffee chips makes this recipe well worth keeping as you can play with it and add whatever mood strikes you regarding the raisins, or dried cherries, etc. DELICIOUS!

My son needed to bring some cookies to school for a british tea party and did not want the raisins so we used toffee bits instead. Sweet, buttery, really delicious treats. These were a snap to make. I would definately make them again with the raisins or currents or maybe even mini chocolate chips.

A very simple and delicious cookie receipe.My 8 yr old granddaughter "helps" me. Somtimes we sub dried cranberries for 1/2 the raisins which adds just a touch of tartness. They have never been greasy as one of the cooks has experienced.

This is the recipe for me. It is so easy to make. Have a cup of tea to go with the cookies!

I had everything in the mixing bowl except the raisins---and found out that I didn't have any!! I substituted dried cherries--and the cookies were wonderful. I think I'll make them the same way each time. My husband definitely approved.

I substituted dried currants for raisins and this recipe turned out really well. My family ate the whole batch almost as soon as it was cool!

This recipe is absolutely terrible! The taste was not only awful but they were so greasy!YUCK!!!The only thing good about these cookies was that they held their shape while being cooked and did not spread out!
