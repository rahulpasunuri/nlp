I make this all summer long! I have added atrichoke hearts to the topping list!

I had everything ready for the grill when a t-storm changed my plans. I ended up cooking the sausage & veggies in a grill pan and finished everything up in the oven. My kitchen was about 85 degrees by dinnertime, but it was so worth it--this pizza is absolutely delicious, the combination of flavors between the dough, toppings, cheeses and viniagrette is amazing. My sweaty guests raved. I will DEFINITELY make it again...hopefully outside on the grill!!!

I remembered making these a few times when magazine first came out. We really liked them but i remembered that they were a lot of work. Well, that was before i had twins! These are very tasty but just take too much time to make for the payoff. THere are so many ingredients to chop and so many steps, i don't think its worth the time. I'm a pretty skilled cook but ended up burning the bottom of one beyond saving - so that was a bummer as well. Next time, I'll do the margherita pizza - i think it has about 5 ingredients!

This was my first time grilling pizza & it was fantastic!! The dough was really easy to work with and in the end result it was chewy & crispy (I used dried rosemary & could hardly taste it, next time I'll try fresh. Also, I used bread flour & I think that contributed to the texture). The toppings were awesome too-- I just used pizza sauce, the grilled sausaegs/onion/peppers & mozzerella & parm chz. Really tasty!

I have been making this recipe since 1997. There are constant request for it long after I have made it for friends. I add grilled eggplant and omit the sausage for a veggie version. Also try adding some crushed garlic with the rosemary to the dough, very tasty!

I made the dough into two larger pizzas so we could use our new pizza stone in the oven. We also left out the green onion, sub'd sweet for red onion, and skipped the tomatoes. Truly, it was all great. I would make the dough ahead of time, or make sure you have help (like another reviewer said, that's part of the fun) so it doesn't take so long. Next time I'll try the grill for the crust too - that crust is yummy, and the marinade for veggies will be used for other occasions. Mmm.

This has been our house pizza ever since the recipe appeared in Bon Appetit in 1997. We love it!

Excellent pizza. I used a tortilla crust and did not do it on the grill. Everything else as written. Raves from the family.

We love this recipe (and my husband requests it regularly)! Because there are only two of us, I freeze half the dough for use at a later date. Also, we prepare it inside on a table-top grill up to the last step when I slide the pizzas (half the recipe makes 3 large individual pizzas) into a 425 degree oven about 10 minutes until the cheeses melt. The one leftover pizza is just as tasty and enjoyable when reheated for lunch a day or 2 later.

This is a fabulous "white" pizza! The crust has a unique, delicious flavor (omitted sugar). Watch the clock when grilling the rounds - they can char easily. Will make again and again, perhaps another time with broccoli and black olives.

A pizza worth fighting for! Every time we have it we end up fighting over the few that are left. We've been making it for years and it's a must-have at least a few times every summer. Absolutely delicious.

I have been making this ever since I saw the recipe. After making it the first time exactly as the recipe is stated, I have changed a couple of things: I cook the toppings on the stove, or it turns into an all-day affair and I use herbed goat cheese. The crust is a must, it's great with the rosemary. It has become our favorite pizza crust.

Wonderful.

My husband is very happy I've found a way to continue making pizza through our long, hot summers. Technically I'm only rating the crust b/c we used the more mundane tomato sauce/mozarella/pepperoni toppings, but I agree with everyone who really likes the rosemary in the dough. Definitely do as the cook from Minneapolis suggests, and make it in the bread machine if you have or can borrow one, to cut down that aspect of the work.

This is such a great summer recipe for a family weekday dinner or for those special summer get-togethers. The rosemary dough really adds a spark to the pizza...don't substitute this dough for a ready-made crust. We've been making this since it was first published in BA and it gets rave reviews by anyone we've made it for.

I have been making this dish since 1997 when it was featured in the magazine. The flavors are incredible and I love the rosemary dough - as a matter of fact I use that dough for other pizzas as well. It takes a lot of prep time but you can do it in advance so it isn't too bad. I have added artichoke hearts as well - wonderful!

I have been making this receipe for years - it continues to get rave reviews from friends. I like it because I can do all the preparation before people come over - it takes time but it is well worth it!!!!

I was disappointed with this recipe, maybe because I had very high expectations after reading all of the reviews. It was a LOT of work for what seemed mediocre results. I have never made my own dough before, and it turned out kind of tough. Possible that had everything to do w/ me, but I would probably just use a frozen crust or boboli if I ever made this again. It's not that it wasn't good, but seemed a bit average for all the time it took. I would try and figure out some shortcuts next time, to make it easier. I do have to say the marinade is terrific, and they smelled great grilling.

This was wonderful. Used French goat cheese and Buffalo mozzerella cheese. I can't wait to make it again. Next time I will top with some nice big fat juicy black olives.

I tried the dough recipe for the first time at a party. It was the easiest dough that I've ever made; all that I had to do was throw the ingredients into my stand mixer. We cooked it on both sides, then assembled the pizzas and let them cook on the grill's top shelf. That method was easier than cooking the second side with the ingredients on top. It received rave reviews from everyone, so I would definitely make this again.

the dough is what makes this so very good. I always make double and freeze. Topping is great really nice with the bal. vin. touch. I have changed the cheeses around to accomadate guests and this always is a hit and turns out well.

I took a major risk and tried this for the first time when I was cooking for my in-laws, and scored big points. It was fantastic. I used pre-packaged dry crust mixes instead of the one the recipe called for and had great success. Every time my in-laws visit, they want me to make this.

We love this. My 5yr old daughter keeps asking for it. You can substitute any toppings you like. I can't imagine why the dough would be crumbly...

I couldn't get the pizza dough to roll out into a thin crust...it tasted good, but it was thick and crumbly. Any suggestions for what I did wrong?

This is THE BEST pizza. I like to add pizza sauce to give a more traditional flavor instead of adding the marinade on top. Sometimes I cheat and just use frozen bread dough and it still turns out good. The marinade recipe is good for many other grilled vegetable dishes.

This is the best pizza dough we have ever had. We have made it many times and use whatever toppings we want. Its great with the kids, we give each kid their own crust to make their very own pizza. Everyone who has had this pizza always wants the recipe, its a hit.

I make this recipe all the time and use the pizza dough to make other types of pizzas. It is fun to have a "Pizza Party" using this dough and a variety of toppings and let your guests "customize" their pizzas.

This was the first time I grilled pizza and it was wonderful. I had a couple of picky friends over and they loved it! They couldn't stop raving about it! I used the dough recipe then put out different toppings for people to make their own pizzas.

we loved this recipe...however, I did not have goat cheese and substituted feta. Boy Howdy that was good!

I left out a few small Items like the Tomato and green onions not missed. I would marinate the veggies in the vinaigrette next time for sure. thought the would be hard to make but are pretty easy and fun.

Although quite a bit of work, this pizza was absolutely delicious. It made a great leftover-lunch the next day, too.

This has become a staple in our family. If you have a bread machine, it is even easier. Follow the first step adding the water, sugar and yeast. Then add the rest of the ingredients and use the dough setting. It is absolutely fool proof. The dough comes out perfect every time.

We made this twice now and will have to make it again. This is not "fast food"...I did not change anything, and I would NOT recommend skipping any steps (the crust is a must!) It does make a very filling meal, in fact we had enough food for six of us. For two servings, just make half the quantity of toppings and freeze two of the grilled crusts for another time. Sooo good!

This is hands down the best pizza recipe in my cooking arsenal. Forget the boboli's, there is nothing like fresh dough with fresh rosemary kneaded into it. And the dough is a snap to make. Don't get scared. Several combinations of toppings work, the key is to grill them. Blue cheese works great with yellow peppers and onions. Everyone loves these charred babies!!

This recipe was a LOT of work, but half the fun is getting there! It was tasty, but too heavy for my husband and me -- we barely ate half of each of our pizzas before we felt really full (i.e., couldn't move). Our guests loved it. We really enjoyed the leftovers more then next day, just slicing it up cold. There are so many ingredients on this pizza that it is a lot of food. The presentation is beautiful. If you are big eaters, this is for you. I had never made homemade pizza dough nor grilled it before, and both steps were very easy. But it took me about 3 hours, start to finish. If I did this again, I think I'd use the dough and top it with easier toppings.

I first tried pizza's on the grill 7/98. My kids thought I was nuts. Do you always have to do things wierd? Well, I've created a monster. From birthdays, tailgating, friends, co-workers- everyone wants to come over for pizza on the grill. It is a lot of work, but worth it. Try feta cheese, sauteed mushrooms, basil leaves, roasted peppers, asparagus, they all work great on these pizzas.

I've made these pizzas at least four times and they're always great. Like others have stated, the combibation of rosemary, goat cheese and grilled onions is absolutely sublime. The dough was easy to make and cooks perfectly on the grill.

As with many, we have been making these fabulous pizzas since publication. One of our all time favorites, today, my wife asked to have "My" pizzas. :) We have prepared these on New Year's Eve with friends. It is such a great participation meal. Changes? Anything you want to do will always work out well. This dough has never let me down!

These pizzas are fantastic as they are. Do not substitute pre-made crusts for these gems unless you're really pressed for time. They were so good, I made extra dough the second time and grilled the extra rounds with no toppings at all. Mighty tasty loaded or bare. 4 forks may be hyperbole but these really are good!

Oh my God! I cannot begin to tell you how delicious this pizza is. The only change I made was to eliminate the sausage and I used Boboli for the crust. It was so good that my guests scarfed it up and ignored the rest of the food at my BBQ! The sublime combination of creamy goat cheese, sweet balsamic vinegar, rosemary and garlic, grilled onions and peppers.......I could go on and on..............

I just made this dish for a casual dinner for myself and a friend. Just perfect. We only ate half a pizza between the two of us! I have a gas grill which seems to be a bit more uneven, but it worked all the same. I was in a rush so bought premade dough from Bertucci's and was glad I got an extra, because I burned the first one. The vinaigrette is delicious on the pizza and smells wonderful!

I have to agree with the last reviewer except that my kids like the recipe as is. We have been making this since it arrived. We served to very impressed friends followed by a delicious, but time consuming dessert, Black Pearl Cake, Bon Appetit, Sept. 1998. It's a fabulous pizza!

I have made this recipe since it was published in Bon Appetit in 1997, and it is my family's favorite dish that I make. The fresh rosemary in the dough (I keep some in my garden) gives it a great flavor, and the marinade is out of this world! It's a very different type of pizza, and it is fabulous!!! My kids prefer "traditional" pizza with tomato sauce on the bottom and mozzarella, so I prepare several bowls with sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, and pepperoni in addition to the toppings in the recipe, and everyone enjoys topping their own pizza. You can also make the individual pizzas somewhat smaller, thus creating 5 pizzas. You must try this!! It's a great summer meal!
