Perfect. Easy. Simply delicious. It's a great alternative to the green bean casserole. It's great for beginner cooks as well as those who want a simple, elegant side dish for any meal. Will have this for special occassions as well as everyday meals.

I have made and served this many times to rave reviews. Once, a guest ate seconds and thirds saying he couldn't get enough of them! I always follow the recipe to the letter except to use more green beans - there are plenty of onions to cover 2 - 2.5 lbs of beans if you are making it for a larger crowd. It is also tasty (and safe) at room temperature, so I have used it as a picnic side dish / salad as well. All in all, this is a great recipe.

Colorful side-dish

As is, this was good though we only used 1 1/2 onions since that was all we had around the house. My partner and I both agree that next time we'll add the green beans to the pan for the last couple minutes or cooking to give them a bit more of the wonderful onion flavor.

Served this Christmas Eve - very good. The onions are a little time consuming but sooo good. I used haricot verts for the green beans.

Wow, was this the same recipe everyone else raved about? As someone who loves green beans, I reall disliked this recipe. The carmelized onions, while delicious, completely overwhelmed the string beans. Also, their consistency was a little on the mushy/slimy side.

I thought it was delicious but not one comment from guests at dinner! Especially good leftover, would cut down on the oil a bit.

Great flavor!!! Beware of oiling the pan and adding tossing the onions in more oil..mine were a bit oily but otherwise delicious.

Very good, but not great recipe. Relatively easy and quick. Next time I will carmelize the onions on top of the stove. Much simplier and quicker that way.

A great way to serve beans! I have a similar recipe that calls for toasted walnuts and garlic (add the garlic to the onions near the end of roasting - If the garlic roasts too long it will burn) - adds that extra something if you feel this dish is lacking. I also agree with a previous review - lining your pan with foil is a must!

This recipe is incredibly easy and tasty. I usually carmelize the onions a day or so ahead. Then, I reheat them before adding them to the beans when it's time to eat. These are always a hit. I tend to chop the onions into small, bite-sized pieces.

This was good, but I think it can be even better. Some of the reviewers are right--the colors are just so pretty. We served it with chicken breasts wrapped in bacon and glazed with a balsamic vinegar/raspberry mixture, so the colors, texture and flavors went very well with that. I think next time I would add chopped bacon, which one reviewer mentioned, as well as some sliced mushrooms. Other than that, I can't think of what it is that this dish seems to be missing--mabye something crunchy? But pine nuts don't seem right, neither do almonds. Nevertheless, it was very good, and I'll try it again with some added ingredients.

I love onions...

So unbelievably easy, and so delicious. My onions were on the bigger side, so I didn't use as many as the recipe called for. I had no problems serving these as leftovers - the flavor, color and texture were just as good the next time around.

I have made this twice with excellent results. My guests all rave and have asked for the recipe. Try it!

Pretty good, but I made it in the morning and transported it for Thanksgiving dinner. The beans took on an odd color from the onions. Also, I cut the onions into eights so they would be smaller but still needed more time to carmelize. I'll try it again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it got raves. I roasted the onions earlier in the day, and reheated them in a small pot with a smidge of water while I boiled the green beans, crisp tender, right before serving. This recipe tasted delicious and presented beautifully.

I made this for this last Thanksgiving and it was delicious! It got rave reviews! My only problem was that I didn't serve it right away, so the onions started to look a little brown. I would definitely recommend serving it right away, but it's yummy!!

I thought this green beans were a wonderful healthy alternative to the traditional green bean casserole. I also cut the onions into small pieces (approx six pieces per onion). I also used more green beans that the recipe recomended.

This recipe is wonderful. I tried to find some new recipes for Thanksgiving that were different, and lower in calories, than our traditional recipes. This was a winner. I will be serving these green beans throughout the year, no more green bean casserole for this family. I couldn't find medium onions so I used large ones cut in eighths. They fell apart when I turned them but it made no difference. It also took a little longer for the onions to brown before I added the water, probably an additional 10 minutes. This recipe is a winner, easy enough for everyday but special enough for company.

i made this dish more or less as specified in the recipe, and i thought it was wonderful. i will make it again, often. the onions add an easy and flavorfull complement to ordinary green beans. my only modification to the recipe was to saute in butter before adding a small amount of water to steam/cook until tender. more calories,more flavor....

Simply delicious! The sweetness of the caramelized onions are a perfect backdrop for the green beans. Will definitely serve again and again.

I was dubious about this as I made it, since it didn't seem like it would pull together. But it was great! And so easy. I would have given it 4 forks except I think the onions should be sliced smaller than they recommend, both so that they carmelize faster and are easier to eat.

Straightforward and delicious; just the way I like my recipes to be. My boyfriend now prefers me to prepare his two favorite vegetables this way.

Surprisingly Delicious! I was a little skeptical about the large amount of onions this recipe called for but can see why- the onions took on a wonderful sweet flavor - i wish i had stuck to the recipe. Definitely will make this thanksgiving.

The hit of the party! I doubled the recipe and added half a pound of Neuske's bacon (cut into one-inch pieces) and about three cloves of sauteed garlic. Got rave reviews!

This was surprisingly delicious. The vinegar soaked deeply into the onions during the roasting, and they were delicious. I used haricots verts, and they were perfect. I just added them raw to the roasted onions and popped them back in the oven for a few minutes, and the dish was perfect.

The best thing I've ever done with green beans! Actually, I used half green and half yellow (wax) beans, both fresh and locally grown. The three colors were beautiful, and the taste and texture excellent.

This was pretty easy and tasty - my only complaint was the clean-up. I suggest lining the baking dish with foil before cooking the onions.

This dish is quick and easy to make and is very delicious. The red and green mixed together make it visually appealing and it looks more impressive than it actually is to make! I am planning on making it as a side for Thanksgiving.
