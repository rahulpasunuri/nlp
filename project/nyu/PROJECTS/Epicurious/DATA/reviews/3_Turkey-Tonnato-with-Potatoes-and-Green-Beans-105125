Excellent and easy. To save time, I just blanched the beans in salted water and refreshed. Boiled fingerling potatoes skin on, then peeled and quartered them and sprinkled a little mild white wine vinegar on them. The sauce was delicious but too much fat for us. I used 1/2 cup of Vegannaise and a quarter cup light fruity olive oil. Increased the lemon juice to 5+ tablespoons to improve flavor. Lots of sauce left over from two people to toss into pasta with clams.

Excellent, do-ahead dish for entertaining large crowds. I poached one boneless, rolled leg of veal for about 30 minutes, and added two tied turkey breast halves (that I cut off the whole breast)for another hour (probably would reduce cooking-time by 25% next time). Cooled completely in broth and refrigerated overnite. Served the following day with previously steamed beans and sauce. Sauce is excellent, but I believe it's important to use good, italian tuna packed in olive oil. I also added a few tablespoons of capers and a tablespoon of dijon mustard. Perfect summer lunch with pasta salad (Penne with Arugula, Radicchio and Smoked Mozzarella)and Rosemary Focaccia and cool, white wine.
