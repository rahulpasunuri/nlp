Absolutey delicious recipe! Using quality Reggiano Parmegiano cheese is a key ingredient and not at all overwhelming. Brought all pork chops, both bone in and boneless to 160 degrees internal temperature and all were moist and delicious. Even the boneless were moist and tasty. Will make this for guests next time, but the family loved it as well.

My family, including 6 and 4 year old boys, loves this recipe. We make it at least once a month. It's been a crowd-pleaser when entertaining and I've shared the recipe many times.

Fantastic! and so easy. I had my grill at moderate heat (about 250 degrees or so?)and the chops browned just right without blackening. Very moist! Will definately make again.

These were outstanding! I did make a few mods though. I used panko crumbs and added fresh herbs (rosemary and thyme because that's what I've got growing). I added the herbs to both the bread crumbs as well as to the chops after the oil so they'd stick directly to the meat. SO good!

Delicious! I brined the pork chops in a salt and brown sugar solution before I breaded them. Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. They were super juicy and the flavor was great!

I did mine under the broiler and the bread crumbs burt up instantly. All I'm left with is burnt breaded pork chops, this may work on the grill but how do you stop them from burning?

This was SOOOO good! My husband who is NOT a fan of pork said that this was the best way I have prepared it ever. (we have been married for 12 years) I LOVED the taste of the grill (we have gas) With the bread crumbs. I used Panko bread crumbs as I had those on hand. I added a little extra salt and 1 half tsp granulated garlic. I also used a mixture of "Italian Cheese" (Parmesan & Mozzarella) Four cups was a lot of crumbs and I had quite a bit left over. I put some more cheese in with them drizzled more olive oil over it stirred and baked them in the oven for about 15 min @ 325 till it was nice and golden. Was YUMMY! I used it to top our salad and as extra crunch for the pork. Will definitely make again!!!

This was as easy as it was delicious. My only variation was a quick salt water brine for an hour before breading the chops. Next time I will try adding some Italian herbs.

Nice summer luncheon dish.. not spectacular. The breading stayed perfectly on the meat while grilling. I added some fresh herbs to the breading mixture using panko instead of traditional bread crumbs. Next time, I'll try more adaptations to create a more interesting taste. Served over tomatoes & spicy greens with oil and vinegar to add some moistness.

Excellent, easy recipe. Made even more mid-week friendly using (gasp) organic whole wheat bread crumbs from Whole Foods. Delicious still.

This was very good; the crust could be expanded upon to be more dynamic. I typically use a milk and salt brine with Pork Chops so I will try this next time.

I though this was absolutely DELICIOUS! And simple to prepare and cook. I used English Muffin bread crumbs and some garlic-infused olive oil and grilled the chops on a gas grill. I was worried that the coating would burn on the grill, but did not have a problem with it at all. I did make sure that I dried the chops off well before dipping them and once I had the coating on, I stuck them in the fridge for about 30-40 minutes (probably would have left them longer but it was time to eat!). This will definitely be something I'll make again and again!

Excellent. Ignore the timid or pompous early reviews and go ahead and prepare per recipe (plus any personal input, of course). The bread holds up just fine to the heat of a grill and adds a nice crust to the chop. I didn't read the reviews until after preparing this dish twice and had to laugh at the jowly, "italian" instructor from NC intoning about how he does it. Great. Just follow the recipe and enjoy a great dish. Really simple.

Delicious! I basically followed the recipe (added a bit more cheese to the breadcrumbs) and cooked them indoors on a cast iron grill pan. As long as the chops are very dry (pat them dry, prepared the breadcrumbs, then pat them dry again), you'll have no problems with the breading falling off. I assumed I'd have to finish these in the oven, but I kept the heat at medium, and they finished perfectly in the grill pan; slightly crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. Definitely add a squeeze of lemon just before serving. A great recipe for bringing Sunday morning's French bread back to life for a Friday night dinner!

Really yummy! The grill worked great, and they didn't lose the breading. Would definitely make them again.

We love this recipe-it instantly became a staple for us. The fresh breadcrumbs, olive oil, and grill make for a perfect combination-there is nothing like the flavor of fresh grilled bread! It reminds me of a fabulous grilled-bread salad from one of my favorite Italian spots. The meat itself remains tender, moist, and juicy.

I made this tonight and it was really good. Forget broiling. I brined the center cut chops first, (make sure they're really dry before you dip them in the oil), then dipped them in olive oil, then breaded them in a mixture of dried bread crumbs, parmesan, finely chopped garlic and pepper. Baked them at 400 degrees for 45 min. My hubby and four year old loved them. Served them with fresh string beans and a tomato/onion/avacado salad. Yum-o!

Italian by osmosis (hee..hee)I have been breading pork chops for years with bread crumbs, parmesan, seasonings and either sauteed or baked. Would not recommend a broil or grill to do the job. Can't imagine the results being satisfactory.

As an Italian who views breadcrumbs of all kinds as a side dish, I have grown to develop an appreciation for various methods of preparation. Fresh breadcrumbs invariably are more delicate than the container variety available at supermarkets. They will burn easily if exposed to the high heat of the grill. Better to mix those breadcrumbs with some olive oil, pat into place on the chops, place on grill at low heat, turn when brown, brown other side and then remove from grill and finish in the oven. This is especially important for thicker cuts with the bone in as the meat nearer to the bone requires a longer cooking time & may not be cooked before the crumbs are a burnt mess. Also, too high a heat on the grill will ignite the olive oil in the crumbs and make a lovely fire display for your neighbors. If I oven cook them I have a trick: Heat a skillet not non-stick) until hot. Drizzle with olive oil & heat until very hot. When oil is hot place pork chops in the pan (hear the sizzle? the crumbs should stay on now). Remove from pan, allow pan to come back to a higher heat, then flip over and do the same with the other side & then finish cooking in the oven according to thickness. The crumbs fall off in an oven otherwise because when the pork chops are not seared first they begin to exude their juices, wetting the breadcrumbs and losing any adherence they had. Another trick is to coat the chops in flour first (that helps absorb the escaping juices) before patting with breadcrumbs & olive oil. Too bland? Try using seasoned olive oil or whole garlic cloves stuffed beneath the meat of the chops. Don't skimp on the salt & pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice before serving is wonderful.

It was ok, but nothing special. I prepared the porkchops in an oven because I don't have an outdoor grill; the breading fell off the chops when I turned them.

We grill pork chops about every other week, and I thought this might be a nice change. My husband read the recipe and labeled it "a potential disaster". Actually, it turned out just fine, with the bread crumbs browning nicely. However, there was not enough of an improvement in presentation, or taste, to warrant all the extra preparation.

Great chops for the grill!! I used breadcrumbs made from wholegrain bread and only had thinly sliced boneless chops which I also brined. I had never grilled anything breaded on the grill and was excited about how well the coating adhered only using olive oil. Will definitely make these again before the summer is over. They went beautifully with skewered cherry tomatoes that were also in this issue.
