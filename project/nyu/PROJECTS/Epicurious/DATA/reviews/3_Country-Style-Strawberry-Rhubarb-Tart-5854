Over the top good, but it is very juicy. I used pie crust, so I think it would be best in a pie plate to hold in the juices.

This is a nice and simple tart. I found specially useful the previous reviews, both the positive and the negative. The latter helped a lot to be extra careful with the sealing and the baking. You are right, Vanila Ice cream is a MUST!

This torte was a hit at the 4th of July celbration overlooking the Long Island sound. The rhubarb and strawberries were both fresh from the garden. Although I did not have hazelnuts, toasted walnuts made for a flavorful crust. I did use a torte pan with a removable bottom which made presentation easy.

I had some trouble with this recipe. I don't know whether it was my fault or just a hard-to-turn-out recipe. I think there's too much juice in all this rhubarb and all these strawberries for a "shapeless" tart. All the juice oozed out while it was baking, almost right away. It stuck to the baking sheet, too. The tart was tasty, but I've had better. I think I prefer a regular pastry crust over this cookie dough-type crust, at least for rhubarb and strawberries. I "saved" the tart after FINALLY turning it out onto a platter, by garnishing it heavily with a fanned strawberry and some mint sprigs. It was rather lovely after all this, but was a bit of a disappointment. Not awful, just not wonderful.

The flavors of the tart are delicious. We served it with homemade vanilla ice-cream during the Memorial Day weekend. It is a bit messy while baking. I placed the tart on parchment paper in the center of a rimmed baking sheet and was able to catch any juices which I spooned back over the tart when it was finished baking.

a total disaster... crust leaked - filling went all over the oven and burned - smoke everywhere - I transfered the pie to a jelly roll pan (not very successfully) only to have the crust burn before the filling bubbled... what is the point of the tart pan bottom under the tart?

This is the best strawberry pie I have ever tasted . It doesn't get soggy and the tidbits of hazelnut make it sublime.
