We have been making this for several years; I cannot tell you how good this is! We serve it as an appetizer with fresh crusty bread slices, using a spoon to get all the delicious ingredients onto the bread!

Sooo good. I add chicken everytime I make this, and cut up everything nice nice. This is a main course for our family!

Like a famous chanteuse once said: If you don't enjoy it, you're doing it wrong. Delicious! ( I did, however , follow everyone's advice and chop it up)

I have made this recipe many times over the past several years and it is always a big hit! Yes, its very rich, but a wonderful treat at the holidays. Once adjustment I've made is instead of pine nuts, I use toasted pecans - absolutely elegant! I always serve with crusty bread.

I, too, chopped the artichokes and prosciutto to bake and serve as a dip. So delicious! Did anyone else notice, though, that the recipe gives no oven temperature? I cooked mine at 375 degrees for 30-35 minutes.

Have made this 3 times and always get complements. I usually have to cut my prosciutto in half crosswise and lengthwise. Always have served crusty bread. A very rich receipe.

Four forks WITH QUALIFICATION! I made it a second time for vegetarian friends without prosciutto and I thought it was better. The prosciutto together with the gorgonzola made it too salty. I agree with those who recommeded using a bit less gorgonzola, too. But the artichokes, cheese, cream, pine nites and herb made a delicious dish.

We followed the many recommendations to cut back on the cheese and though it was still salty, it was not overwhelming. The one thing I did not like about this dish is that I found it did not look particularly appealing - the cheese makes a greyish-looking sauce. I like the idea someone mentioned of chopping everything and serving it as a bruschetta (much easier to eat) and will definitely try that next time.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe, though we cut back on the gorgonzolla as it is very strong. Have made it several times and it is always a crown pleaser.

Thought it was fabulous. A bit of work to wrap all those artichoke hearts but worth it. Very very rich dish so it goes a long way.

This was a huge hit at our New Years gathering. I followed some of the suggestions and modified it using 2 oz. of a very mild blue cheese and about 7 oz. of goat cheese. I chopped everything , added perhaps 1/3 Cup of cream, and then topped it with toasted pecans and a sprinkling of Parmesan Reggiano. Because I forgot to put it in the oven on time, I jumped started it in the microwave and finished it off in the oven. Served with toasted French bread that was lightly rubbed with garlic, it was the first of my hors'd oeuvres to go.

I didn't rate this recipe because I did change a few of the ingredients. I chopped everything together and I used fontina instead of Gorgonzola. I also used 1/3 teaspoon of dried sage leaves. I have made this twice now and it is a real keeper.

I decided to go the easy route and just chop everything up and make it into more of a dip, and used toasted walnuts instead of pine nuts because that's what I had. It was incredible. This is one of those recipes that will forever be in my repertoire.

This is a wonderful recipe. It's relatively simple to prepare and got great reviews from my guests. I am in the process of copying the recipes for them. I will try combining everything and using it as a dip as one other reviewer suggested next time (to make it even easier.) This is definitely a keeper!

I've made this several times. I put the quartered and wrapped artichokes on tooth picks to make them easy to pick up, and also had the crusty bread for the leftover sauce. My sauce was a great consistency, hung on the artichokes great. Perhaps the other person didn't use whipping cream? It does make a difference

Don't know what happened to the last cook, but this is great. Did she bake it as suggested? We love it and will make it for any reason during any season!

Based on rave reviews, I was excited to make this recipe... unfortunately, I was very disappointed in it. Consistency was too thin and the ingredients did not combine well. Because the ingredients didn't combine well, the flavors did not marry. Basically, the dish was inedible. Not sure if the cook was the problem as I followed the recipe instuctions provided. Has anyone else had this problem?

After reading all the reviews, I knew already this was going to be great. I used it a little differently, though. I added a few of my own ideas to the mix, and chopped everything together as others had suggested. I took it to a 'baked potato' party, (everyone brings thier own toppings). I passed out 27 copies of the recipe and I didn't have a scrap left to take home! (I'm glad I was smart enough to make an extra batch to leave home!) This weekend I'm making it for my hubby and his buddies in phyllo dough.

This recipe has good potential. I didn't care for the way the recipe calls to serve it-- messy and hard to eat. I will make it again, but follow the suggestion of chopping everything up and just serving it as a dip. The flavors are great together!

I also chopped up the ingredients. I put the mixture on tiny toasts and broiled for a minute or so and served them as a type of bruschetta appetizer. Everyone loved them and they were easy to serve.

Added this to my Christmas Eve buffet and it was fantastic. Used Parma-Prosciutto and did not find the dish too salty.

Rating: 3
I didn't find this to be overly salty. I cheated and didn't bother to wrap the artichoke hearts. I just cut the prosciutto up fine and mixed it with the quartered artichoke hearts. It was a great mix of ingredients. I served it for a dinner party and one guest who categorically refuses to eat anything with vegetables had three helpings. I used the leftovers to stuff tomatoes the next night. That mellowed the flavors a little for those who felt this was too salty.

Made this last might to take to a superbowl party and the hostess raved as did her husband. My husband also liked it. Myself, well it wasn't my favorite but was good. Not too salty but very rich. Even though it wasn't my favorite I will make it again because everyone else loved it. What do I know?!!!

This was the hit of a New Year's Eve party! Strangers were telling me I had to try it, not knowing I made it! Since I don't like gorgonzola, I substituted fontina. I also reduced cream in half and used whole milk. I didn't find the dish too salty at all. By the way, any recommended temperature at which to cook this dish? I went with 375 degrees which seemed OK.

Rating: 4
Thanks to other reviewers, I worked on reducing the excess salt. Butcher was kind to give me a taste of the proscuitto (it was fine), tasted the Gorganzola first (fine) and carefully rinsed the artichokes outside and between the leaves (and then turned them top-side down to drain onto paper towels; gently squeezing them between towels to remove excess moisture. Trimmed excess fat from prosciutto and chopped three main ingredients. Mixed toasted pinons inti mixture and sprinkled top w/ Parm & extra pinons. Baked. Served with thinly sliced baguette, lightly oven toasted. It was the best dish at both New Year's Eve & New Year's Day parties. Thanks all you reviewers!!

This was a Christmas Eve hit at my house!! For those who felt it was too salty, try using less of the proscuitto and rinse the artichokes before using. I am making this again tonight for New Year's Eve and I am sure it will be devoured!

This recipe is full of very strong flavors, and quite salty, so it may not be for everyone, but I have only gotten praise for this dish. I substituted walnuts for the pine nuts, which was a perfect combination. You could probably get away with using a milder blue cheese than gorgonzola.

I made this for a friend's party this past weekend and it was the hit of the night. Decadent and delicious, and so easy to make. Next time I'll make *twice* as much. One hint: If you can get it, get prosciutto from the "end." It's much sweeter and really combines nicely with the saltiness of the dish.

To those who are serving this over pasta . . . why not just make a pasta sauce that has artichokes, prosciutto, and gorgonzola, etc.? Why go to the bother of setting this up as a gratin?

I made this appetizer for an intimate birthday dinner for my husband, it turned out wonderfully and I would'nt change a thing!!!

This is a great dish. I have made it twice in the two weeks since I found it. To make it easier to prepare and especially to eat, I cut the artichokes into smaller pieces and diced the proscuitto and layered it on top. Tastes the same but easier to scoop with a small piece of bread or cracker.

Rating: 4
To use this as a main dish, I lightly browned some boneless chicken breasts and placed them in the baking dish before adding the other ingredients (chopped up as others have suggested), then served over pasta. YUM. Not too salty at all. Also, I disagree with the person who said that the flavor of the artichokes was too delicate to go with the other ingredients. It was a nice balance of flavors.

Rating: 4
I served this at a recent dinner party and everyone wanted the recipe. No one felt that it was too salty or disliked the gorgonzola. The next time that I make it I am going to try chopping everything up as a former reviewer suggested. We, too, served the "leftovers" over homemade linguine for dinner the next evening.

Brought this as an appetizer for a Thanksgiving buffet. Well received except for those who don't like Gorgonzola. Might try without it next time. Also substituted some hearts of palm for a few of the artichoke hearts - big hit!

I took this as my offering to a Thanksgiving Dinner Party. I never made it before, which is usually a no-no with me. I thought the ingredients would go together. Everyone raved over this one dish and wanted the recipe, I definitely will make this again. It is wonderful, and I love Gorgonzola.

It's not the cheese that imparts the majority of the salt-- it's the prociutto. Try this-- quick-rinse the prociutto and pat dry-- that will remove some of the salt. Also, I dumped the parmesan and used asiago instead, because it is smoother flavored and textured.

Rating: 0
My boyfriend asked for some kind of artichoke dish for his birthday meal, and I am considering this one, but am concerned about the number of people that found it too salty. Has anyone tried using a different kind of cheese - maybe asiago or romano? Something still with a strong flavor, but distinctly different from gorgonzola. Any tips would be much appreciated. Thanks!

Rating: 3
I do not understand the saltiness issues everyone had with this dish. We thought it was wonderful. However, I did only use about 1 c Gorgonzola and 3/4 the proscuitto it called for. We made omlettes out of it the next day--awesome!

This recipe has potential, but as written we found it prohibitively salty. Perhaps a different type of cheese, or maybe mixing the gorgonzola with a milder, less salty cheese? Will try it again with some modifications.

Rating: 4
This dish is amazing! The only problem was that the artichoke heart was almost completely overpowered by the dish's strongest taste, the Gorgonzola. Makes you wonder if you could substitute something less expensive and with a firmer texture . . .

Rating: 2
Serve these immediately--the saltiness was acceptable when they'd just been baked, but the few we kept warm for a guest who was an hour late became salty enough to make your head swim. Maybe there's a chemist out there who can explain? Also: they're quite rich, as others noted. If I make them again, I will serve no more than two or three to each person. I thought they were okay; my guests liked them rather more.

I had high hopes for this recipe. Individually, I like all of the ingredients. But, found the results way too salty and the blue cheese overwhelmed the other ingredients. Won't bother with this one again.

I made this for a brunch along with some other dishes and it was thoroughly enjoyed. I used half-and-half instead of cream. It was very quick and easy to prepare. Buy crumbled gorgonzola to speed the prep time.

I found this recipe to be overpoweringly salty. The saltiness (left even after draining) from the canned artichoke hearts and of the prosciutto was all I could taste. Perhaps if you used frozen artichoke hearts and regular ham or bacon the result would improve. It was a pricey dish to make and not worth the money.

Rating: 2
This was good - just a little overwhelming. Really blue cheesy, creamy, salty and rich - all the good stuff. Just keep this in mind when you balance out your appetizers. I served this as a side dish and it was just too rich. This would be better as an hors d'oeuvres. On the plus side, it was so simple to prep and make.

Haven't made this yet, but plan to for the holidays. Silly question I know, but how would I serve to guests....I like the ceramic tart suggestion, but would I serve with crusty bread pieces and a knife to spread the gratin? I really don't want to slice and serve on plates.

Rating: 4
This is absolutely DELICIOUS, and it goes together in just a few minutes. Don't shy away from the gorganzola cheese - the flavor really mellows once the cream and parmesan have been added and cooked together. And don't forget the crusty bread - it's a perfect pairing, and very handy when scooping up the leftover sauce.

This was a huge hit! High fat, high calorie and totally delicious. I had to cut each prosciutto slice into 4 or 5 pieces, otherwise I would've gotten only 12 appetizers. Don't add additional salt; it's fairly salty already. Baked this at 350 (the recipe doesn't specify).

A guest brought this to dinner one night and everyone loved it, so I made it again. Very delicious. Easy to prepare. I used toasted almonds instead of pine nuts. Tastes best when hot or warm. It gets a little salty when it's cold.
