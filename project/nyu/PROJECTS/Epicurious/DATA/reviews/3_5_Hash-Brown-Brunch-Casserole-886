Campbell's soup is not an ingredient. I expect to see ingredient lists including things like Campbell's Soup in Taste of Home magazine, or the Rachael Ray show, as they are targeted at folks who can't cook at all. But for Epicurious to allow these faux recipes to make it to print is just sad. Really, how hard is it to thicken up and season some stock?

Very good for brunch. I used cream of chicken because I was out of cream of celery. Added 2 tsp of mustard powder about 1/2 tsp of black pepper and used diced yellow onion. Topped it with panko crumbs mixed with olive oil for the last 15-20 minutues. Very tasty.

This is an awesome recipe! I remember eating this when I was a kid. It would show up at different potlucks, etc., but I never new it was so easy to make. I looked up the recipe for my boyfriend and HE makes it anytime he's going to have a big dinner. IF there is any left, it's great sauteed for breakfast with eggs, etc. Although this isn't exactly the healthiest dish, it is definitely a side dish that will be sure to show up at our big dinners from now on.

I only had a 1-pound package of frozen hash browns, so I halved this recipe. I cooked a few pieces of bacon until they were super crispy, then sauteed my sliced red onion in the bacon fat. I added some chopped garlic when the onion was about done. Like other users suggested, I salted and peppered my potatoes before adding everything else. I didn't want it to come out dry, so I used the full cup of sour cream, and almost all of the can of soup too. I threw in a tsp of mustard powder, and used up some cheddar and filled in the rest with gruyere. This reminds me of the hash brown casserole you can get at Cracker Barrel. I think there was too much sour cream; next time I'll try milk, and maybe a few eggs.

I taste-tested this with my family in advance of a bridal shower brunch. It has good flavors and I might serve it at a family brunch but I would never serve it to guests.

This is not gourmet food, I'll grant you, but man, you cannot beat it for ease of assembly (even ahead of time), versatility, and mass-appeal. It's a go-to brunch potato recipe for me. I've cut the cheese in half and substituted yogurt for the sour cream and no one even noticed. I've added canned diced tomatoes, or a diced jalepeno for a little variety. So easy. A nice recipe to have in your tool box.

Violamom - I think you should give it another shot. This recipe is always a tremendous hit. I have made it for ladies brunch, christmas and family breakfast and it is always the first thing to go.

This is good for a brunch potluck or breakfast meeting. I gave it two forks because though it is "good," it uses way too many canned and pre-prepared ingredients for my taste. I added green chilis to mine and they added a nice kick and texture.

I made one to try out on the family and to see if it would be a good choice for a work potluck. It was a big hit at home! I halved the recipe, used shredded frozen hash browns and added green onions instead of white onions, added chopped ham and just a little bit of milk was added to the cream of celery soup and sour cream. I will defineatly be making this for the potluck and at home as well! Yummy!!

Sorry Viola Mom that you didn't like the recipe. It is my go to fix when I'm having a crowd. I fixed it this weekend bc I knew my 3 college kids would be leaving every morning at different times and they would have a bite for bfast. I have even shopped today for more ingredients so they can bring it back to school...it is inexpensive, easy and goes a long way. I have always followed the recipe exactly and even added some peppers etc. and it was great. When I have overflow, I just get another small baking dish!

This recipe is horrible. I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to have 2lbs of potatoes but 1. I mixed everything and it didn't fit in the casserole dish. Hopefully I salvaged it by adding some milk and throwing half of it down the drain. Kind of an important detail that's incorrect.

Delicious. I made it for breakfast w/friends. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. The fried onions are key!

Rating: 4
Delicious. I halved the recipe with the following changes--I used green onions and I used the whole can of cream of celery soup--to make sure it was creamy and not dry. The recipe didn't specify the type of hash browns so I used the Southern variety (chunks not shredded). I prepared it the day before in a 8x8x2 pyrex casserole and baked it the suggested time the next day. It was extremely tasty and the leftovers were just as good. Oh, the fried onion rings are a must. This will be a regular in this house.

This recipe was delicious. I made it exactly as instructed. my only issue was that I feel it could have been creamier. It was a bit dry and I did not cook it any longer than the recipe instructed. Overall, it was awesome. Next time, perhaps I'll add a little milk to the soup and cream cheese before I mix in the potatoes and cheddar.

Great Simple Recipe. Was well received at a group party. Added some green peppers and mushrooms. Next time I think I might saute the mushrooms and add some jalepenos for a little kick. Very good as is though.

From all the reviews I thought this was going to be (potentially) an overly soupy, gooey, heavy mess but to me it was really just hashbrowns on steroids. The additions just added flavor, not too much heaviness. I assembled the night before and was worried that leaving the onions in the mix all night might make it too onion-y but it tasted great without an overly onion-y flavor. I used cream of mushroom soup. Everyone enjoyed it.

Very very yummy. Substituted cream of mushroom soup, but otherwise basically stuck with the recipe. I didn't want to wait for my hashbrowns to thaw (I used the diced ones, not shredded) so I just added 15 mins to the cooking time and stirred before resetting the timer. worked beautifully. Didn't even stick since I sprayed my dish!

Rating: 4
To answer another's question, I think you use the frozen hash browns because they mix well with the other ingredients without losing their shape or becoming mushy. Keep the sharp cheddar and sour cream, I think that's what makes it taste so unique and good. I like to use French's cheddar flavored friend onions on top because it fits perfectly.

I had a housefull over the holidays and was looking for a starch that was do ahead and would feed a crowd.

I finally made this after enjoying it at a family potluck. It reminds me of the hash brown casserole from Cracker Barrel--MMMMM! It seemed a little dry toward the end of cooking time so I drizzled the slightest bit of chicken broth over the dish and finished it off in the oven. Seems like the kind of recipe that lends itself well to tweaks and substitutions as your pantry & preferences permit. So easy and tasty, I will definitely turn to this one again. Maybe not the most healthy, but a treat. Yum!

Same idea, but slightly modified... Ok, so I am not so good with directions, and I didn't have a can of "cream of anything" soup, so I made a quick bechamel (2 tbs. flour, 2 tbs. butter, 1 clove grated garlic, 1/4 grated small onion, about 1 cup of skim milk, a dash of nutmeg, salt and pepper). Then I added about an inch of shredded parmesan to it,to make it cheesy. Worried about the soup, I decided to add about 1/2 cup of vegetable stock. Then I threw in a bunch of leftover cheese (1/2 cup of yellow cheddar, 1/2 cup of white cheddar, and about 3 inches of velveeta, to make it creamy, without the overly velveeta taste). I forgot the sour cream, but I was worried after I baked it for about 20 minutes, so I pulled it out and mixed in about a half cup of low-fat sour cream... I baked for about 1 hour (until the top got a little crusty and brown). It was AMAZING.... as good as Neva's potatoes in Rehoboth.... (read: REALLY amazing). Baked it in a pie shell, but at the Big Fish, they give each person their own tiny casserole dish. Does anyone know why you are supposed to use frozen potatoes? ??

Very tasty and kinda addictive! I halved the recipe, used fresh purple potatoes that I grated in the cuisinart and then sauteed with the onions before baking. I also used fat free sour cream, organic cream of celery soup that wasn't condensed, and added turkey bacon. I think the bacon helped a lot. It's not fancy fancy gourmet food, but it's homey, tasty and everyone liked it. I served it with red pepper and cheddar frittata (from this site), fruit salad, and cinnamon raisin bread/rolls. I could go for some right now-

I made this for Easter Brunch solely by all the great reviews....and it was a total hit ! I used 1 bag ( 1lb 14 oz) Ore-Ida Country Style Shredded Potatoes. I wasn't sure whether or not to use thawed or frozen --- so I just put them in the fridge from the freezer yesterday to make them less frozen. I buttered the dish, baked them at 375 for 1 hour and 10 min. I had to transfer them to my aunt's home where I just stuck it in the oven with the french fried onions for about 10 min or so. This was a real "keeper". It goes a long way too...great for a brunch for a crowd !

I have been making this casserole for years. It's become one of our brunch staples because it goes with everything. I use fresh potatoes that I shred in the cuisinart instead of frozen hash browns and use grated sharp white cheddar. I also bake it in a smaller cast iron dish which I think cooks it more evenly. It comes out perfect everytime. I read a lot of reviewers have left out the french fried onions, I think that's a big mistake. We do use the smaller can of the french fried onions than called for though. My friends have tried to re-create this and for some reason, it turns out differently than my version...I believe it's the cast iron pan that I use. My friends LOVE it. It's going with us to Easter Brunch this Sunday.

I made this recipe for a brunch prior to the NE Pats victory over the NY Jets. It was a total hit. I followed it to the T, but all I could find in the grocery store was hash brown patties.

As you can see by the number of reviews, this is one popular dish! But--can it be improved I asked? Today I halved the recipe, using cream of mushroom soup, a mixture of cheddar and jack cheeses, chopped red onion, and green pepper, plus nonfat sour cream. To this mixture I added the hash brown potatoes which I had browned before stirring them into the cheese mixture. In my greased pan, I spread half of the potato mixture, then a layer of par-cooked chopped KALE, then the rest of the potatoes and baked. What a treat. The kale added color and nutrition. Yes, true comfort food. Next time I am going to try another vegetable...broccoli anyone?

Yum! Doubled the recipe and used 1 can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken. Also used green onions instead of regular onions. Took it to a 4th of July party and it was cleaned out in 10 minutes. Hey, it's not gourmet food by any means. It's not anything fancy, so that's what I'm judging it by. It's good comfort food that you can throw together in 2 minutes, pop it in the oven and forget. My philosophy is that not everything has to be made from scratch. If you can get a good result with something from a can, go for it. Will definitely make again and again and will continue to experiment!

Delicious and easy! I followed the recipe to the letter, and my suggestion for anyone making this is mix everything except the potatoes first, then add the potatoes in handfuls.

I omit the french fried onions, and use about 1 1/4 cups of sour crean intsead of 1 cup. This makes it more creamy. I also add 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup water. The water and butter keep the hashbrown from being hard. It is soooooooo much better with these changes. I found this out by looking at other casseroles which were similar. Try these and you will be pleased.

I thought it was ok, everyone who ate it loved it though and since I'm cooking for them, I guess that's all that matters. To make it easy, I bought Simply Potatoes,shredded potatoes in the dairy section, they're not frozen or they also make hashbrowned potatoes w/ or w/o onions.

This is really tasty, and a huge hit at the brunch I attended. I followed the receipe to the letter, except that I substituted cream of chicken for cream of celery. I also prepared the casserole the night before, cooked all the way through, and then reheated it the next day at the party. Note that I didn't add the french fried onions until it was reheated. One more note...when I tasted it the night I made it the hashbrowns were still sort of hard. When I reheated it the next day, they were perfect. So either let this sit overnight or THAW the hashbrowns before cooking. I am not sure why they need to be frozen!

One of the earlier reviewers called this white trash food, which I can't argue with. I think of it as man food. I don't hate this, but I wouldn't miss it if I never made it again. My husband and the guys love this, and beg for double batches. When I'm feeling particularly generous (or lazy) and add ham and call it dinner, I am definitely queen for a day. No surprise from my husband, who loves Spam and Taco Bell, but the rest of my household likes good food. I originally learned to make this at my Aunt's house, and she used cream of chicken soup, an entire stick of butter, and crushed corn flakes on top. I skip the corn flakes and butter, but everyone prefers the cream of chicken. YOu might give it a try.

This was a crowd-pleaser. However, it is EXTREMELY RICH AND HEAVY and a little goes a long way. Next time I might cut back on the sour cream, since that was the dominant taste. Anyway, very easy to make, and a good "pot luck" candidate.

White trash food at its finest!! And so easy! Big hit at a work potluck. I used one can of low fat cream of chicken soup and also low fat sour cream and no one complained. Added pepper, diced red, yellow, and green peppers for flavor and color. I too cooked it longer and at a higher temp of 375. Browned nicely and didn't need a topping, but I added buttered crushed Ritz crackers instead of the onions and it was very tasty. Used cheddarella cuz its what I had on hand. Any cheese would do. Next time I'll try pepper jack and add diced green chiles.

I made this as part of my Easter brunch menu (again!) and it was a big hit as usual. I have made this many times and prefer using shredded potatoes. Be generous with the cheese and sour cream!

I found that this dish comes out tasting very salty. I've been adjusting the ingredients list and have found that reduced sodium/fat cream-of-whatever soup helps reduce the overly salty taste. I use frozen tater-tots instead of the plain frozen hashbrowns. I also ditched the salty french fried onions as other cooks have suggested. I've added ham and a can of diced green chilies to the list of ingredients as well. I'm still experimenting with number of cans of soup. All in all this is a great brunch/potluck dish. It's very easy to prepare as well. Enjoy!

I'm replacing a previous review with this one. Still give it 4 forks, but I've started using the refrigerated shredded potatoes vs. frozen ones, and I think it's much better.

I made this for a family bruch yesterday and everyone came back not only for seconds, but for thirds. I've made it several times before and I find that two cans of soup works best (I use a can of campbells cheddar cheese and a can of cream of mushroom). I also omit the french fried onions, and add a bit extra sour cream. Also, 10 minutes before I take it out of the oven I put a layer of shreeded cheddar cheese on top. It's so awesome.

I took some of the suggestions made by others several times in the reviews. I used cream of chicken (2 cans)instead of cream of celery, added ham chunks and green peppers, omitted the overpowering french fried onion rings and used buttered corn flakes instead. All I have to say is that by now I ought to know better than to use my guests as ginney pigs especially during the holidays. Blegh!

I made this for a potluck brunch and within 10 minutes of serving it the baking dish was literally licked clean. I also used 2 cans of soup - 1 can of cream of celery and 1 can of cream of mushroom. This is definitely NOT a recipe for those watching their weight, but that's probably why it tastes so good!

Made this last week with ham and was great! One question to those of you who have made - I needed 2 cans of soup because it looked so dry, and it was fine with 2 - I think it would have been dry with one. I followed the directions otherwise. Any ideas on why this would be?

Every time I make this I feel like such a cheater because it is always soooooo much easier to make than anything else I serve. Today I served them at a buffet with smoked salmon rolls, homemade bread, poached eggs, and gingerbread pancakes. Once again, this dish was still the favorite of all. Just about every condensed cream-of-whatever soup works great. I even used mushroom this time and you'd never have known it wasn't called for. I don't use the french fried onions, though; I think they overpower a very tasty dish and are a waste.

I brought this casserole to a retirement brunch this morning, and everyone loved it! I prepared and cooked it last night, and then reheated it in the microwave this morning on medium-high power for about ten minutes to get it hot. Then I baked it in the oven with a 1/4 C of grated cheddar on top for about ten minutes at 350 to make the top look more appealing after the re-heating. It was terrific, filling, easy, and I got several requests for the recipe!

I made this casserole for a brunch I threw for my boyfriend's parents. Everyone loved it, even my step-father, who bristled at the idea of serving hashbrowns as a casserole. While some reviewers have claimed that cream of chicken soup is better, I used the celery and it was perfectly fine. The only thing I altered was slightly increasing the amount of cheese (I like everything cheesier) and reducing the amount of onions. All in all, a wonderful dish that I will certainly make again.

I actually had had a version of this recipe when I was growing up in the midwest and always loved it. I made this for a bunch of calfornia folks and one guy called it 'midwest regional cuisine'.. needless to say we were cracking up hysterically as we shoveled the casserole in our faces. I had never heard it called 'regional cuisine' before.. I am still laughing. This is a rib sticker and everyone licked it up.

Easter Brunch and I was asked to bring Hash Browns. I found this reciepe and decided it sounded good and would be easy to transport. It was a very typical casserole, which I hate, and a whole lot of "to do" about nothing. If I had just fried the hash browns and warmed then upon arrival they would have been much better.I find the work and ingredients that go into casseroles are a waste and I can buy a good steak, for much less than the cost of a casserole, with a whole lot better taste and a fraction of the prep work.

A friend gave me her variation on this recipe years ago. It only takes an extra 5 minutes or so, and the results are well worth it. My college-age kids adore it, and all their friends tell me my hashbrown casserole tastes even better than their mamas'. (Now that's a compliment!) In place of the sour cream, I combine a 12-oz. carton of cottage cheese, 1 (generous) tsp. fresh lemon juice, and 2 Tblsp. milk, blending in the food processor just a few seconds until smooth. We prefer cream of chicken soup and about half an onion instead of a whole one. After topping the dish with crushed cornflakes and melted butter, I finish it off with freshly-grated Parmesan and a good sprinkling of paprika. As another reviewer suggested, it's best to zap the hash browns in the microwave until totally thawed before mixing. And I cook it lots longer than suggested -- at least an hour, and sometimes 5 or 10 more min. The resulting brown and crusty 'edges' are the best part!

I think you should partially cook the hash browns.I microwave them to thaw them. I think the person who said to use the ones in the fridge section is on to something. I have used fat free sour cream and the lower fat soups and you CAN taste the difference..not for the better. But for family, I think lower fat is a good thing.Just don't tell the kids. I think people sneer at recipes like this, but when it is the first potluck dish emptied, what does that say? Enjoy!

As embarrassed as I am to admit it, this recipe is always a huge hit. I typically make the Corn Flake version that many others have mentioned. It is total comfort food & I adore it. A true guilty pleasure. I use hash browns found in the refrigerator section as opposed to the frozen ones. I think that the refrigerated one have a better flavor & texture. Enjoy!

Made this recipe per the recipe and found it a bit pedestrian. Recipe was very simple to make and the kids seemed to like it.

I loved this recipe, it was a big hit but I made the following changes; half reduced fat cheddar, half regular and light sour cream rather than whole fat. I will also try topping this with crushed corn flakes instead of those fatty onions that I'd omitted all together.

This was so easy to make surprisingly good, although on the heavy side. I used green onions and buttered corn flakes because that's what I had on hand. My husband had three huge helpings! I will make this casserole again, substituting a low-fat soup and maybe yogurt for some of the sour cream.

Wow, is this good. Have made it several times and it's always a favorite. We prefer it with 2/3 Monterey Jack and 1/3 cheddar, which really spices it up. Also, the last time I had to use Tater Tots instead of hash browns because I couldn't find them, and it's even better this way.

When combined with bacon and eggs, it made a fabulouso breakfast.

I saw that a co-worker was bringing this to a brunch, and I admit, I sneered. Not very sophisticated, I said to my husband, as I was toiling away on my ridiculous mushroom chive crepes with bechamel sauce. Well, was I ever wrong. These were delicious - everyone devoured them. The crepes were fine too, but not worth the four hours they took to prepare.

Yep, in Utah we lovingly call this dish funeral potatoes--it's easy to make, reheats well, and is comforting in times you're not thinking about calories. My own family doesn't like it--we're too health conscious and prefer an actual potato, or roasted winter vegetables drizzled with olive oil, to the heavily sauced recipe here. But, hey, don't knock it--it serves its purpose well and is a middle American comforting community favorite.

I am looking forward to trying this! With so many comments - there has to be something here!! I have some leftover cream of mush. soup that I made and froze. Will probably add sausage and use jalapeno jack with some mex. spices. I'll let you know how it turns out. For the 7/26 cooks, grated is generally finer than shredded (like the grated parmesan you can get in a can in the supermarket). Shredded cheese is fine for this recipe.

I've been reading, with interest, this debate about the trash bags and I noticed something interesting: the reviewer who said people are being rude and "snarky" is actually the reviewer frm Pasadena who made the mistake of mixing food in a trash bag. As I have tried to make comments more than once, I know that once you type in a new comment, your last comment is erased. Pasadena, you've been caught!

Please please please, if you use a trash bag, use one that says "approved" for food. If you use just an ordinary trash bag, you might be getting chemicals into your food. It's for people like Pasadena that they have to actually put on the trash bag box "do not use with food".

He ate it - that's as good as it gets with him! We also enjoyed the leftovers for a good lunch or breakfast to take to work - they reheated in the microwave pretty well.

This recipe needs some tweaking if I am going to make it again. I like the idea of changing the cheese. I also thought the flavour of the onions was a bit intense..I would only add 1/2 cup, as well, I think I would use a larger pan, as the best part was the crunchy topping.

This is a good recipe for what it is - a brunch casserole. Why do you suppose it conjures up such vitriole?

This dish was too bland for my taste. It tasted fine but it lacked any intense flavor. I would recommend baking it for the full time suggested in the recipe. I thought mine looked done after about an hour, so I stopped baking it, but the potatoes were still slightly hard. I'll make this again but next time I'll substitute some of the chedder for a cheese like gruyere. I'm also thinking a little mustard might help and a cornflake/butter topping instead of the french fried onions.

I made a similar recipe before called Kansas City Hash Browns which was very similar to this one (I guess this type of casserole originated there). I preferred this recipe to the other one and it was easier too. I left out the onions and used cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of celery. I loved the crunch of the french fried onions (my other recipe calls for cornflakes on top). Even though I do like making intricate recipes with lots of hard-to-find ingredients I can sure appreciate this recipe and rate it a high three forks. Delicious!

It seems that like many others, I've been making a variation of this dish for years. The recipe I have calls for cream of mushroom soup and it is topped with extra grated cheddar rather than the onions. This is a great potluck recipe. I have also made a large batch of it, and then frozen it in smaller containers so it is handy when there isn't much time for cooking. On one occasion, I realized at the last minute that I was out of cream of mushroom soup, and I used cream of asparagus instead. It was great. I think it would work well with any cream soup.

We've made this recipe for years. It's in every church cookbook in the south. Cream of chicken is substituted for the cream of celery and the casserole is topped with cornflakes.

I served this to a house full of type A women who love to out do each other in the entertaining department and they loved it. I loved it.

I found this recipe 5 minutes before the end of my working day. It sounded yummy & I dashed to the supermarket to find they didn't have hash brown taters! I was so looking forward to this recipe (I'm pregnant!), and with no other ideas for dinner, that I decided to use fresh potatoes. I used about 10, and my 2 yr old & I shredded them in my handy dandy cuisinart, then stuck them in a pan with some olive oil, salt, lotsa pepper, garlic powder & herbs de'provence. I left them on high for about 10 minutes & shredded about 6 large zucchini. Out went the potataoes into a large bowl, in went the zucchini, onion & more seasonings for about 3 minutes per side. Mixed in the cheddar, a small bag of shredded emmenthal, & the rest of the ingredients. They didn't have cream of celery so I used cream of chicken. At the end, I used half the amount of the french fried onions, which were miraculously available. Served with a salad...it was a yummy dinner!

Davis needs to get a grip. I consider myself an excellent cook, and like to try intricate recipes as well when I have the time, but sometimes there is something to be said for simplicity and ease. And simplicity and ease doesn NOT mean it doesn't taste good. Like the other reviewer said, the recipe is NOT particulary gourmet, but it's still good. Obviously you slave away over the stove for hours at a time every day, but some of us work full time and have other obligations, and appreciate easy and tasty recipes like this one, as well as other, more gourmet ones. And, I'm sure a bunch of 1st graders would appreciate a recipe like this more than they would salmon quiche! Lastly, while the food in France is wonderful there is lots of great food here in the US as well, and who really cares what the French think of us?

My family loves this stuff. I Like the cream of celery, but my guys prefer cream of chicken. I do a variation using chopped green onions,minced garlic, chopped canned green chiles, a good tsp of cumin, and use a white cheddar and asadero cheese. I also add a little extra sour cream. I just top with more green onions and cheese. I like to serve with fresh tomatoes, a good sausage,scrambled eggs and fresh hot tortillas. pico de gallo compliments this too.

We have been making these in my family for years. Not particularly gourmet, but just simple and very good.

I made these today for our Mother's Day Brunch and everyone, EVERYONE raved about them. Of course I make changes, that's the beauty of cooking. I can not wait to make these again!!! Yummy, splendiferous, yowza! I cut up some extra celery, I guess it was about 3/4 cup. Thinly sliced up a red bell pepper (green pepper is to "sharp" for my tastes) then cut cross-wise about 1 inch. I added in unspecified amount of salt, pepper, thyme and garlic powder. I guess it would amount to 1/2 - 1 of a teaspoon each. I just did it to taste. I added in a little more sour cream about 12 ounces total. I didn't use a whole 1 pound 14 ounce bag of hash browns. It calls for 2 pounds of them but there was no way I would be able to fit a full 2 pounds in the dish, that's why I used even less than the full bag. Next time I will try the whole bag and see what happens. As it cooks, it does shrink in hieght though. Also, eliminated the french fried onions. Instead I put the remainder of the cheese (about 1 cup) on the top in the last 20 minutes to create a nice cheesey top. I personally think the french fried onions would have made it too, something as it's a pretty rich dish. Oh and I used sharp Cheddar. You need a really big bowl to stir the ingredients together. My big serving bowl was too small and I couldn't find the huge stainless steel one I have.

I took this to a memorial service/potluck this weekend. The family asked that we bring dishes that John would have liked, and reminded us that he liked casseroles with cream of mushroom soup. So I did a search on casseroles, and came up with this. It was gone before the last notes of Amazing Grace faded out to sea. I didn't even get to try it, but did pick off a few of the crusty bits in the car on the way home. Delish! We have another pot luck to attend this week, and will definitely bring this dish.

So Good! I made mine as a slightly healthier version and NO ONE could tell the difference....everyone raved. I substituted hashbrowns O'brien for more flavor and color, I used fat free sour cream (turned out perfect...I was a little worried on how it would bake but it was perfect), I used 1/2 the amount of reduced fat cheddar cheese and the other half was a habenaro cheddar cheese for some added spice, 98% fat free campbells cream of celery soup (only used 3/4 of the can) and I even found BAKED fat free french fried onions in a can right next to the ones I normally buy that are LOADED with fat. It was incrdible and really no guilt. Served with a fabulous egg casserole where I used real eggs, real cheese ect so it was a great no guilt balance. Will make it again for years to come.

This has been a staple in our family for at least 10 years. We top it with plain crushed corn flakes and butter. Also try using cream of chicken soup instead.

Tried the recipe as written on a test drive before a brunch. Didn't go over THAT well, hence the review. Then tried a modified version -- it was a big hit.

Obviously I'm out of sync with everyone. I never trash a recipe because I always think it could work with some modification - until now.

Actually, I have to agree with him....this is not a dish you would make if you are going for impressive or elegant, but it is quite tasty (if fattening, though I used reduced fat sour cream and cheddar cheese with perfect results) and a great solution if you are feeding a fair number of people for breakfast/brunch and don't want to spend the whole morning in the kitchen preparing individual omlettes. If you really have a crowd, try making it along with the cheese and sausage casserole, and serve fresh fruits and a coffee cake, scones or muffins. Your guests might go into cholesterol shock, but no one will go away hungry, and you will be able to enjoy your party instead of standing in front of the stove. If anyone knows of other nice brunch recipes to feed a crowd (fancy or not!) I would love to hear from you. Thanks!

Made this for Mother's Day brunch and it went over great! Several folks asked for the recipe. It was brown, crispy, flavorful and very, very easy. Nice alternative to regular brunch fare.

Cant believe some dont like this dish. I have made it several times to rave reviews and recipe requests. As a matter of fact I'm going to make it again tonight. If you expect crunchy hashbrowns dont - this is a casserole

Have been making this for years-- I use 1/3 less fat sour cream and 2% fat cheddar cheese. Also, I prefer smashed corn flakes on top (moisten them with melted butter first). I make it night before. Everyone loves this easy dish!! Make sure to use LARGE bowl to mix ingredients.

I was at a Mother's Day Brunch when I tasted a delicious hash brown casserole. The cook would not give up the recipe. After searching through your website, I was thrilled to find one, and I couldn't wait to try it. I followed this recipe exactly, and I was very unhappy with the results... I would not make this again.

A big hit at a brunch and low fat sour cream worked just fine.

My family has been making this recipe for years, and it's always a big hit. We either use cream of chicken or cream of mushroom. It's a matter of individual preference, but most people seem to go for the cream of chicken version. (I personally like the new combo chicken/mushroom soup that Campbells sells.) Anyway, we also usually cook it at a higher temperature, but again, that will depend on your oven/geography/etc. And as the other reviewers mentioned, the reduced fat/fat free versions make little difference to the taste- there's so much good stuff in there, a little less fat doesn't hurt. But I would suggest maybe fat free sour cream, regular cheese, and reduced fat soup. This is good for brunch, but also wonderful paired with fried chicken, fried okra, and homemade lemonade for a good old-fashioned Southern picnic!

I work at a college in North Carolina and we have used this recipe for catering functions for up to 400ppl. Every time we use it, we are asked for the recipe. I have lost count of how many times we have made it. It is a wonderful dish

Yum. This went perfect with our Easter Ham dinner. I made half of this for our small family. I had a recipe similiar to this that I've misplaced. I think this is better then the original.

I have made this dish on two occasions and it was a big hit each time. I would suggest using shredded hash browns (my husband used the chopped style when he made it and the texture was not quite right). I also have adapted it to use the lower fat cream of celery soup, reduced fat sour cream and reduced fat cheddar cheese. You can't even detect the difference. I will definitely make it again and again for family and friends.

Excellent...quick and easy....have had many requests for copies of this recipe!

Terrific! I read all the reviews and decided to use fat free sour cream since it's a little thicker and I cooked the dish at 375 instead of 350. It was very crispy and my husband adored it. A keeper.

Rating: 2
I halved the recipe and baked for an hour and a half and I think it still could have been crispier. For the amount of time it needs to bake, I'm not sure I'd make again. I liked it, but both my husband and daughter found the sour cream flavor a bit much. (My husband pronouced it "weird".) If I use this recipe again, I would only use a small amount of sour cream.

Rating: 3
Very good however, next time I think I will bake 10 to 15 minutes longer and not put quite as much onions on the top. Too many fried onions on top seemed to take away from the great flavor in the dish it-self.

Rating: 2
Good flavor especially using the cream of celery soup, but the hash browns got soggy and clumped together while cooking. I would have prefered them to be crispier.

Delicious!! I was skeptical when I tried this recipe, but am so glad I made it. Like a previous reviewer commented, you need a huge bowl to mix this up in. This recipe was very easy to make, and came out so tasty! I like hashbrowns crispier than most people, so next time I might cook it an extra ten minutes prior to topping it with the fried onions (which, by the way, are the perfect topping!). Very, very, very good!!

Sadly I will be making this dish again. I say this because this is soooo good. SO GOOD. I tried it over the holidays for a brunch we had and my husband begged me for days after that to make it for breakfast for him. I am sure this is the culpret for the 10 pounds I gained over that 1 month stretch! GRRR!!! I wish it were not so easy to make... Oh why couldn't this be more complicated?

What does "unthawed" mean as in frozen hash brown potatoes, unthawed? Thawed means defrosted, so doesn't unthawed mean frozen?

At Christmas brunch this was a big hit. All but one tablespoon was eaten, and everyone asked for the recipe. Amazing stuff. I added ham as someone suggested, but will leave it out next time as I didn't think it added anything.

I made this for our Friday morning breakfast club at work. It was a hit! The "perfect comfort food" was one comment. It is easy to adapt but great just the way it is. And of course it couldn't be easier, make it the night before and just cook in the morn.

This is my new signature dish. My husband absolutely loves it and he is a very picky eater. As the other cook suggested I also used cornflakes and a little more cheese. I plan to take it to upcoming holiday gatherings but the simplicity in it's preparation will be out little secret.

Yummy - just like Mom used to make. I used Ore-Ida hashbrowns (little cubed potatoes). I let them thaw about 20 minutes before mixing the ingredients. I made the recipe just as written and it turned out perfectly. These potatoes would be just as good at dinner too. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
I liked this dish but made the following modifications: I used Ore-Ida hash browns and almost thawed them, used cream of mushroom not celery, everything else was the same except that I added 1 pound thawed cut leaf spinach (not in the block, but frozen as separate leaves). The spinach added visual and taste appeal and I would definately try it again. Next time I want to try fresh sauteed sliced brown mushrooms instead of the spinach.

Learned of this recipe from a co-worker. I use cream of mushroom soup, add a little chopped yellow (vidalia in season,) top w/extra sharp cheddar cheese and omit the fried onions. My all-time favorite breakfast dish! Try it, you'll love it.

It's great for covered dish events.

Tons of fat, but tons of taste! I made this for a brunch my cooking group had and it received rave reviews. The simplicity is an added bonus! I think the hashbrowns only need to be thawed enough to spread them around - 5 or 10 minutes on the counter should be enough.

Just a question please: Do you use still frozen hash browns or thawed. I'm confused. Thanks.

My husband loved this dish. I thought it was okay. Very cheesy and the fried onion on top tasted yummy.

A worthwhile recipe to try. I tested using cream of chicken vs. celery. To my surprise, the celery had much more flavor. Next time I will up the cheese to 4 cups (wasn't cheesy enough for my taste), and reduce the sour cream to 2/3 cup (and use light). I also added about 1 1/2 cups chopped ham to turn it into a main dish, rather than just a side dish--a very nice addition. Also, I added 3/4 tsp. salt and fresh ground pepper. Next time I'll also add a dash of Worcestershire sauce to perk it up.

Yes, this is rich. It seems like it should come from a 1950's cookbook. But don't get me wrong. We all thought it was very tasty, and I will make it again experimenting with differnt kinds of cream soups - ooh how about crab meat? I used cream of chicken as another writer suggested. Thanks.

I have made a variation of this recipe many times. I use shredded potatoes and use cream of celery or mushroom soup. I layer the potatoes, then soup & sour cream combined. For the top, I use crushed corn flakes mixed with melted butter. It is always a crowd pleaser.

This is an easy crowd pleaser. I used cream of chicken soup and on top, crushed ritz crackers with 1/2 cup melted butter. No big mixing bowls necessary if you just dump the frozen potatoes in the casserole dish and pour remaining ingred. on top.

My husband (who is not a cook) made this recipe -- thought it was very simple! He omitted the real onions and used 1/2 cheddar cheese (not sharp) and 1/2 mozzarella, and it was great.
