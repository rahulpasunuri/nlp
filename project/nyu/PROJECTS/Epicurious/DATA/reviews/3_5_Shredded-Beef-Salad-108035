Can't say it knocked our socks off. However, I had some salad left with the dressing & meat. Threw the salad the next day, but the meat was very good. Like one reviewer suggested--next time I will marinate the meat in the dressing. Then I'd give it 3 forks. I will save the steak for the grill & boil a chuck roast & shred for tacos, enchiladas, etc. Great idea to have packages in the freezer for a quick meal/snack.

i made the recipe as written only i had to use chuck as no flank steak was available. very very good, perfect for a warm evening.

The first time I made this, it turned out perfectly, and I loved it, but I have not been able to replicate that success in three subsequent attempts, even though I followed the recipe exactly. The meat (bought from Whole Foods) came out tough, stringy, flavorless and dry, and I had to toss the whole batch. I give up on this recipe.

I have made this recipe several times as salad--wonderful--or used only for the shredded beef portion. The beef is wonderful in burritos and freezes very well in small batches for a quick, easy meal.

Wonderful! I've made this several times for company, and they've always loved it and asked for the recipe. I just toss the lettuce, shredded beef and dressing and then offer all of the other toppings separately, that way everyone can have it like they like it. I serve it wrapped in homemade tortillas, and it's wonderful. In fact I'm craving it right now!

I have been searching for this recipe for years! Used to get it at a little mexican joint "Taco Auctioneer" in San Diego. They were always secretive about the recipe, but I made it yesterday and it is THE ONE! Even my guests loved it and they were skeptical! Made it just as listed, needs nothng else in my opinion! YUM

Unlike the previous reviewer, I found this to be a very tasty recipe on a hot summer evening. I added a little more lime to the dressing, did not use radishes and tossed everything except the avocado and chips (used as a garnishes)and we loved it.

Imagine you are sitting on the Yucatan Peninsula looking out at the clear blue Carribean. At this point, you can also imagine really enjoying this salad. For me though, in my kitchen in central Georgia, it just didn't impress. Nothing unpleasant of bad tasting, but not that good either. And yes, I did follow the recipe without modification.

Wow! Very good. Only change I made to the recipe was used a red onion in place of the white to flavor the beef. The entire salad was very good, but especially the dressing. I have made the dressing several times since making this. I prefer to make the dressing in the blender and add the oil slowly. This helps it to emulsify and grinds up the oregano. I've also made the dressing with lemon juice and it tasted just as good. This last time I only shook up the ingredients and the taste of the oregano didn't seem to come out as well.

This recipe was interesting. The flavor of the dressing was quite nice, but I think I will toss the meat with it a bit before serving. The meat could have stood just a tad more flavor. I assembled it a bit differently--more pleasing to the eye. My guests certainly seemed to like it.

To New Orlean's Cook: Look for Mexican oregano in the ethnic isle of your market(not in regular spice isle). They normally sell herbs and spices in small plastic bags. They tend to be less expensive than McCormick's, Spice Island, or Schilling's because of the packaging.

We enjoyed this--light, cool and diferent for summer fare. I was unable to locate Mexican oregano which I understand is more pungent; however the dish was successful. To those of you who did find the Mexican variety--is it that significant in the flavor of this dish? Also, after "composing" the ingredients as written, we decided halfway through the meal that it really was better tossed as a main dish salad and will probably present it that way in the future.

This was a very good party food, it needed a little more lime than what it called for but very good. Try after boiling drain liquid and move meet to another pan, add 1 med. onion, green pepper, tomato, and 1 clove of garlic and 2 peeled potato's cut up,one small can of tomato sauce,1tsp of Goya Adobo seasoning and 2 cups of water let cook on low to med flame for 40 min. or until thick, put over white rice. Serve with avacado slices. Absolutley delicious. Eat Up and Enjoy

It never occurred to me to boil flank steak, but it turned out surprisingly good. I served the salad with the Mexican White Rice recipe, also from the May 2003 issue of Bon Appetit. I thought the dressing needed more lime juice than what was indicated in the recipe, but otherwise, this was delicious!
