I used French green beans- much leaner bean- and they came out crispy! This was a tast novelty but they don't keep well so serve right away if you opt for them.

I used less oil and the next time I'll use half the salt, I also added garlic and this was really, really tasty. Love it.

So easy and yet sooo good; I've made these for dinners large and small. Its a great side dish that is quick, easy and delicious. Everyone always asks what I did to the beans. I do blanch the beans to quicken the roasting time...be careful not to burn the shallots.

The flavor was good, however the texture was a bit softer than I anticipated. This is not a recipe for anyone with a preference for crunchy vegetables.

Lovely and delicious. Made it with the times indicated. (Did add lemon juice since it seemed to be the consensus). Will definitely make it again.

This was great. I cooled the beans 20 minutes before adding the shallots and I added a clove of garlic. Then roasted 10 more minutes and added some fresh lemon juice. It was a hit with my company.

Was the best string beans I ever made (I guess I don't make very many different string bean recipes); I added 3 cloves of garlic because we love garlic; I added a capful of lemon juice; cooked for the amount of time indicated on original recipe and it was so very yummy. Will definitely make it again.

I have made this many times. An easy crowd pleaser.

Great recipe. I made it to go with Thanksgiving dinner. I followed Jean's review below: cooked beans with oil and salt for 20 minutes, then added sliced shallots and 1 chopped clove garlic, cooked for 20 mins more. Before serving, drizzled balsamic over it. Big hit even with the people who don't eat string beans. The 3 year old hostess was "Thankful for the string beans".

Easy, heathy and very good. Make sure the beans are in a single layer on the baking sheet. Added juice of half a lemon.

Very easy and sophisticated way to prepare green beans. I added a squeeze of lemon juice as someone else suggested - everyone loved them!

Excellent, simple dish. I agree with a previous reviewer that 25 minutes is not enough. I'd recommend 45 minutes, and mroe if you double the recipe. I'd also recommend slightly more salt, and a drizzle of good quality basalmic vinegar at the end.

Nothing special, needs another ingredient..maybe garlic? Maybe some spices? Too bland altnhough the family liked it.

Jean, will you share your recipe? Sounds like a good Thanksgiving dish!

I give this one 3 forks, reserving 4 for my own rendition known on 3 continents as "Jeane's Mean Green Beans". It has been on my Thanksgiving table for the last 10 years. People who don't like vegetables like these. Be advised, the beans take longer to cook than 25 minutes. They'll need about 40. If you start the shallots at the same time as the beans, they'll burn rather than caramelize. Give the beans a 15-20 minute head start before adding the sliced shallots (or onions). I make these a couple of days ahead, and serve them at room temperature, antipasto style, not hot. They're wonderful as is, or you can drizzle on a little balsamic vinegar and top with some toasted pine nuts.
