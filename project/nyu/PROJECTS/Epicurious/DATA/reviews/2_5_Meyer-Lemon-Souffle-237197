I'd seen this on the cover of Gourmet years ago and always dreamed of making it. The recipe uses cornstarch instead of flour, yielding a very light meringue-like dish - lighter than your average souffle. It still fell once pulled out of the oven, and the flavor was good, but not great. It's a good light dessert for summer, but if you're looking for a life changing experience, pick another recipe because this one just wasn't all that memorable.

I followed MJ Tisor's advice in San Fran and couldn't have been happier. This was just what I expected and served with a dollop of whip cream on the side was exceptional!

I followed the tips left by by msojka from Mount Shasta on 12/26/07. But I used 2 tablespoons of meyer lemon zest and cooked 30 minutes (non convection at the original recommended temp. so I just changed the lemon additions to 1/2 cup juice and 2 Tablespoons of zest. DELICIOUS. My guests went insane. VERY lemoney. Just perfect.

Light, elegant, exceedingly pleasant dessert. A lovely counter to a heavy meal (for example, cheese fondue). Unlike the other disappointed reviewers, I used meyer lemons and, afraid of blandness, doubled the zest (vs. the juice). This was quite a simple souffle to make. If you're looking for a grand impressive and richer souffle dessert (with a lot more prep time), try the Grand Marnier Souffle with Creme Anglaise on Epicurious (made by the Four Seasons Boston). It is an resounding 4-star!

Easy and a light finish to dinner.

Based on the other reviews I added extra lemon juice, which may have been why the souffle didn't rise as high as it should have. A friend suggested adding lemon oil, which I didn't have on hand. There are so many better lemon deserts out there, I wouldn't bother with this one.

Very disappointing. The Meyer lemons smelled wonderful, but the souffle had very little flavor. It would have been better with regular lemons.

Update to my previous review. This is the modification that recreated on 12/25/07 the first excellent result: 1/2 cup lemon juice, tablespoon of lemon zest, baked in a convection oven at 350 for 20 minutes at which time the top had already started browning and was cracked open from rising. Turned heat off for last 10 minutes. It came out with a lemon pudding at the bottom and a more meringue like consistency on top with the pudding having a wonderful tartness to it.

I love Meyer lemons, and have my own tree. Unfortunately, this recipe came out very eggy and bland. I might try it again, but use only half the egg yolks.

Fortunately a friend has a Meyer lemon tree and begs me to take them. If you have not seen or tasted them before you will notice they have a slightly orange color and a sweeter taste than most lemons. Regarding the recipe, I have made it twice. The first time was in a convection oven and I had to turn the oven down and reduce the cooking time. The souffle came out wonderful though with the top cooked and browned like in the picture with the delicious lemon pudding-sauce on the bottom. The second time I cooked it in a friends standard oven and had to raise the temp to get the top to brown and then because it cooked longer the lemon sauce had combined with the eggs more and the souffle did not have the definition of flavors and texture that the first one did. So, for those who were disappointed, I suggest trying to get Meyers lemons and/or vary your oven temps. Good Luck!

Could not find Meyer lemons and needed to serve 12. Used regular lemons, doubled the recipe and used 3/4 cup ramekins. Make sure you use the parchment paper collars. These rise about 3 inches above the rim. Nice presentation. Also made a simple blueberry sauce to accompany it as I thought the souffle was a bit bland.

The secret to this recipe must reside in the use of Meyer lemons, as I am unable to obtain them I used ordinary lemons.I found the recipe easy to follow and as long as you did not cook your eggs when making the custard the recipe was easy to realize. The souffle has a nice texture and is as a souffle should be - light as air. I added twice the amount of zest as recommended and found the souffle to have a nice lemon flavor. I imagine one could substitute lemon for orange adding maybe a little Grand Marnier and also obtain a good result.

Not bad. Made it for a special occasion and it was disappointing as a "special" dessert. Agree with the comments -- not enough zing, recipe does seem more suited to 4-6 servings than 8. I also didn't find the sugar coating added anything.

This is my first review here, and it says 1 fork = just so-so, so I want to emphasise that this was by no means *bad* but merely so-so. I did think it was a bit too sweet, but overall I agree with the other reviewers. This was just really "eh." It was just as much work as a lemon meringue pie without the crust (make lemon custard, make meringue), but folding the two parts together just sort of diluted the pleasure. I was expecting to realy enjoy this, as it was my first encounter with Meyer lemons, but it just wasn't very interesting. Also, the idea that this could serve 8 people is laughable. I would say 4, 6 max. (Think about it: there are 4 eggs and 1 cup of milk here. The rest is basically air.) I wouldn't make this again; for this work, I'd sooner have crustless meringue pie. (There are simpler lemon souffles out there that I would try.)

This was light and airy with a nice lemony taste, but if I'm going to the trouble of making a souffle I'll stick to chocolate. The lemons make a better tart or pie than a souffle.

This was my first attempt at a souffle and it turned out great! It was easy to make and it did not fall. Unlike the other reviewer, I thought it had nice zing. I didn't use Meyer lemons, just an organic one from the grocery store. I used one lemon and subbed store bought lemon juice for the remainder (just a little bit). My husband enjoyed it too. I will definitely be making more souffles, and probably this one again.

My meyer lemon tree lives in a greenhouse during the winter & I hoard the wonderful lemons. I was very disappointed in this recipe. It rose beautifully & looked wonderful but the taste just didn't deliver. I served it to 6 of us & the servings were pretty small, but considering the lack luster taste, that was ok. Don't waste your time or lemons!

I grow my lemons & since I don't get very many I hoard them to use in special recipes & this definitely doesn't qualify. The lemon flavor was the best part of the souffle, the texture was ok & it it rose beautifully, but there just wasn't any zing. It only fed 6 of us barely. Don't waste your lemons!
