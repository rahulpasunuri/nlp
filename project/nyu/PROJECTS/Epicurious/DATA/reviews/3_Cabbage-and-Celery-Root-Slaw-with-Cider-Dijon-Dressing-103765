Loved it! Added a bit more vinegar, and used only green cabbage, and yellow pepper instead of red. It was so much better than all the other slaws I've tried recently (especially the Asian slaw that a coworker said smelled like, "hot garbage")!

Actually closer to 2-1/2 forks. Third coleslaw recipe I've tried lately and definitely my favourite. A bit more zip in some manner would be fantastic but overall I enjoyed this recipe. Holds up well too.

After receiving a CSA veggies shipment with celery root and cabbage I found this recipe. I agree with what most of the people say. It is important to pay attention to your knife skills on this one. I cheated a bit and used my mandolin to slice everything to the desired thickness then used the knife to matchstick where necessary. I substituted Splenda for sugar for dietary reasons but it was still just as tasty! Will definitely make this again and like it much more than just plain old coleslaw.

Actually, this salad deserves 2 1/2 forks. It was crisp, light and tasty. I felt that 2/3 of the dressing was adequate to coat the vegatables.

Quite good. I wilted the red cabbage by sauteeing in olive oil a bit. Also added steamed sweet corn kernels for an extra sweetness.

I too cut down on the red bell pepper. Also, I didn't have any red cabbage, so I used all green cabbage and it turned out fine. I like to make with grilled cheese sandwiches or a casual fish dinner. Gives what could have been a bland meal a little zest on the side.

This was really good. I cut the dressing recipe in half (don't like soupy slaws) and used low-fat Hellmanns and was nicely surprised; a good change from the Asian slaws w/peanut dressings of late. Added a little -maybe 2 tbsp- thin red onion too.

I would make this again... but definately for a group! Just me and my husband, he loved it. I got so sick of it. I thought it was o.k. But, I goofed on a couple of the ingredients, so I'm giving this recipe the benefit of the doubt.

This is a good recipe but takes work. It is really important that you slice thinly, I was lazy and chopped too big and the slaw was difficult to eat. The dressing is great.

Very good but I did cut down on the red pepper, maybe 1/2 of one red pepper. This is time intensive but I think it is worth it. Only add 1/2 tsp salt and pepper when you make it, then adjust it the next day once the flavors blended.

This Coleslaw recipe has now replaced by usual recipe, which by the way I have been making for over 20 years. Just loved the colour combination of both cabbages, the mustard gave this salad the extra tang which is so often lacking in Colesalw recipes. Great for a BBQ
