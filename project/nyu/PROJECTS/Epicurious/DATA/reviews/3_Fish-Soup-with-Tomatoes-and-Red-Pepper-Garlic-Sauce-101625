I have made this soup 4 times now and it's always a hit! The rouille is a must, I leave out the added potato though. I use halibut and combination of clam juice and vegetable or fish bouillon for the stock. Absolutely delicious! ENJOY

Very nice. I used fish stock, and it needed a bit of salt, which the respie doesn't call for. Mix some of the rouille into the broth when eating.

The soup is bland. The rouille is bland. When you mix the two together the taste is slightly improved. If you are considering making this recipe you should experiment with other bases besides fish stock. However, don't be fooled by the positive reviews for this recipe. This soup is not worth the time or the money. Very disappointed. Would not feed this to my dog.

I have now made this soup twice with very good results. It has a bright, fresh flavor. I think the saffron, orange peel, fennel and tomatoes work really well together. I made a few modifications in my last batch. I seeded the tomatoes. I used snapper as there was no lingcod at my market. I substitued 1 lb. of mussels for 1/2 lb. of fish. For stock, I used a combo of shrimp stock and clam broth from my freezer as well as some purchased frozen fish stock. I think any combo of these would give good results. I also added some additional olive oil to my rouille as it was too thick. I think this is a good recipe as is or modified.

I modified the broth as the other reviews suggested with 2 8 oz. bottles clam juice, two 14 1/2 oz cans chicken broth and one 14 1/2 oz can vegetable broth. No need to peel the red potatoes. Added celery because none of my groceries stores had fennel bulb. The Italian parsley really is a must for adding a nice flavor. Also added ground white pepper, some Bay seasoning. Was not intrepid enough to add the orange peel, so instead added lots of lemon zest which was definitely a great addition.

The rouille was gummy and bizarre. I would have used much less potato. The soup was pretty good, but nothing special.

Es una sopa reconstituyente, especialmente cuando uno se siente decaído. Magnífica !!!

Made it for Ash Wednesday and it was a hit! The rouille was so good we could not stop dipping bread in it. I took the above advice and did half water and half clam juice. I would have like a bit more flavor in the broth. Next time maybe I will cut with chicken stock instead of water. I will serve this again as first course on Easter.

Excelent it has a mild seafood aroma,just rigth on the pallete. Clam juice with fish, and fennel gives a unique taste in the soup. My family loves it.

A comforting summer dish. I had to make several adjustments: I used some cherry tomatoes since I've got tons in my garden, used 20oz of gourmet clam juice plus 30oz of water due to cost considerations, and used orange roughy because it was the most workable fresh fish available at the time. Thawed halibut would likely be a good choice as well. The broth has a subtle, harmonious taste - the ingredients aren't duking it out for dominance. Frankly, I think if I used 50oz of clam juice, the taste would be too fishy. The broth is nicely contrasted by the garlickly rouille. Raw garlic is powerful!

Tried this recipe for a group of 12 and it was a hit! Great results with not a great deal of effort. Save fennel ferns for garnish and add a bit more garlic. Will Bring back memories of trips to the coast.

I enjoyed this soup. I could not find fennel bulb had to use fennel seeds.
