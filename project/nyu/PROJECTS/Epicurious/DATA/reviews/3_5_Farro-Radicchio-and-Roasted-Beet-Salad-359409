I have made this numerous times and LOVE it. It's great as written but equally good substituting baby arugula for the radicchio- I serve the farro/beet combo on a bed of baby arugula. Works well and though not quite as crunchy, it somehow becomes comfort food...for me at least. Great recipe...I'll definitely try adding nuts sometime soon. Chopped toasted pecans would probably be fantastic.

Really nice balance of flavors, and filling! I make it as written, with farro & good quality sheep's milk feta. Have made this multiple times now & get cravings for it. It lasts a few days in the fridge and is great to have on hand for snacking or lunch.

The radicchio was too bitter for me. Perhaps I'd like the salad with half as much.

I took this salad to a Break the Fast dinner last night and everyone loved it. I made the following changes to the recipe: I put the cut radicchio in an ice bath for approx. 10 minutes prior to using, to remove some of the bitterness. I always do this when radicchio is the main ingredient. It also help crisp it up a bit. Also, I substituted golden beets for the red, to add color, and peeled them with a vegetable peeler & cut them up prior to roasting which eliminated a lot of mess (thank you, Ina Garten!). I substituted goat cheese for the feta and added toasted pine nuts before serving. I made a mustard vinaigrette with champagne vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. It still had a nice punch from the dijon but just a bit mellower than with r.w. vinegar. The crunch of the radicchio, combined with the chewy "tooth" of the farro, is fantastic. Everyone wanted the recipe and I will definitely be making this again!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used mixed greens instead of radicchio as I don't really care for radicchio, especially in these quantities. I used extra garlic in the farro as well. Overall a very pleasing salad, both to the eye and palate.

Great side dish!! I used less feta cheese, and added toasted chopped walnuts for some crunch.I also grilled the raddichio before chopping and adding to the rest. Yum.

This truly was a delicious recipe and so simple to make. I used the wheat berries because it's what I had on hand, and subbed blue cheese for the feta. It was also as pretty as it was tasty, as I used both golden and red beets. I used the recipe out of the magazine so I didn't see the suggestions for nuts, but I don't think it needs them, at least when made with the wheat berries. They have enough of an almost nuttiness and crunch themselves that I think adding more would be superfluous.

I couldn't find farro and the wheat berries were going to take too long, so I substituted orzo and it was delicious! I also added walnuts for some added crunch. It's not something I would serve for a party, but it was a great light dinner option and I will definitely make this again.

I'm having the leftovers right now with the addition of toasted pine nuts and sesame seeds. the other reviewers are right, nuts do truly make this better. It holds well enough for a buffet, and lunch the next day

I made this over the weekend to bring for lunch during the week - it was truly delicious in its simplicity (and it was fun to have a pink lunch every day). Per other reviewers' suggestions, I did add some chopped walnuts which might have made it even better...

At first I thought the recipe just seemed too simple to be any good, but I was really tasty. I think having fresh, good-quality ingredients makes a big difference here. I skipped the feta (dairy-free for me) but I'll second the notion that walnuts would be a great addition here. I will probably bring this to my next picnic/potluck-type affair since it's colorful and stands up well to being made in advance.

I made this last night and enjoyed it. I rated it 2 forks because while it is light, healthy and flavorful, it is not super memorable in the grand scheme of epicurious recipes. My husband and I did enjoy it though, and I am looking forward to leftovers this evening. I didn't have feta so used a mild goat cheese. With that, I thought chopped walnuts might be a nice addition.
