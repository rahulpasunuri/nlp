Please, all of you with the negative, immature comments, please keep them to yourselves. This is a recipe review site, not a bash-fest. Remember we're all adults here, so be kind.

I am finding the reviews of this particular cake most amusing. The box-mix bashing that has taken place is just hilarious! Now, like most of you I am not a fan of box mixes - why else would I be reading Bon Appetit? and bristle if someone asks if the cake I brought is Betty Crocker (most people know better, by now). However, sometimes a mix, used as an ingredient, has its place (I make a wonderful chocolate milk cake that starts with a butter recipe golden cake mix and no one would ever be able to tell this subtle, moist and delicately chocolate cake started its life in a plastic pouch). This "box mixes, in any form, are beneath me" mentally is a little ridiculous. Having said that, this is a nice moist cake. I left out the pecans because we were out, but it's a wonderful little tea cake, good with butter or cream cheese, nice for breakfast or a snack. It got me to try cinnamon-chips, which are surprisingly pleasant (I found them at the first store I went to, wish I could say the same for Dutch process cocoa), but could easily be left out and just up the ground cinnamon. I won't knock myself out making it again, but it does not deserve the bad rap it gets simply because of its Duncan Hines origins.

i work at a very upscale bakery in nyc and we use duncan hines cake mix for some of our cupcakes- guess what? nobody can tell. it's pretty funny to hear "gourmets" raving about how rich and wonderful they are. maybe that "box taste" you detect is nothing but your own pretensions.

I would think in the world of cooking that there is space for all people who enjoy creating food. As my mother got increasingly more ill, she relied more on mixes and shortcuts because making something from scratch was exhausting - her stamina was waning - did my father and their friends enjoy her desserts less because of it? No. Cooking should always be about taking pleasure from the process and giving pleasure to others in the end product - not arrogant judgments.

I too object to "box mix" recipes. I suppose I can just skip over them, but I come to Epicurious because I expect more. I don't want to waste my time, if I did, I wouldn't need a recipe, just a box. NO MORE mix recipes please!

Add me to the chorus of voices that agree, box mixes are dreadful. I am appalled that epicurious has stooped to this level. If I wanted that type of recipe I'd go to allrecipes or to Sandra Lee. What a let-down.

To DUH Connecticut - my point is why comment on a "box mix" recipe if they are so horribly disgusting to you? Just move on.

Rating: 2
Because they don't know that there IS a box-mix involved until they visit the site and read the recipe. Duh! I tried this anyway and thought it was unexciting and not worth making again. I'm a "from scratch" cook generally but I do make one cake at Easter using a Duncan Hines lemon cake mix which is excellent. I can tell that it's made from a mix and would prefer that it didn't taste that way but it's quick to make, pretty good and always gets compliments.

Oh good grief!! If you have a problem using a mix... then skip this recipe and MOVE ON WITH YOUR LIFE!

I'm disappointed, not with the recipe because I would never use a mix with all of the junk in it, but with the magazine for featuring a recipe that comes from a mix. We can buy stupid "fix a mix" cookbooks for that. Manhattan, you can come to my house for dinner any time.

You "box-mix" cooks really puzzle me. MOST EVERYONE IS AWARE THAT BOX MIXES HAVE A DISGUSTINING ODOR AND TASTE. Have you EVER tasted "from scratch"? Try it ONCE, and you will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER use a BOX again! Believe me! Good grief, it takes minutes to make!

Woohoo! New York, you got the ball rolling on kitchen smack-talk. Brightened up my quiet Friday night (yes, even in the Big City we get bored)!

What happened Manhattan? All your galette eating friends go off to French Polynesia for the winter? Are you so bored by yourself that you are now reading "Loaf Cake" recipes. Out here in this god-forsaken mid-west there is nothin' else to be, but bored and cold. For more interesting conversation, I suggest the "mousse" and "terrine" recipes. If you want tacky, check out the mac and cheese folks... you know this, try not to invade this type of recipe again. It only serves to remind some of us of how desperate we are for something good to eat!

I understood Manhattan perfectly--he/she was commenting that it's been a while since we had a good food fight between the mix-lovers and the mix-haters. When I saw the controversy, I just had to try the cake. The taste was not bad; I think the fresh ingredients--butter, sour cream, eggs, spices--offset the artifical taste of the mix. The texture wasn't great, though. It was burned on the outside and soft and underdone in the middle. In fairness I should say I used a glass loaf pan rather than a metal one, so maybe that was the problem. It occurred to me that the cinnamon chips might work better as part of the streusel rather than being mixed into the cake. Anyhow, there are better coffee cake recipes to try, so I won't be making this again.

BRAVO Manhattan!! This is the kind of person I want at my dinner parties! Someone who can actually make the conversation interesting and has something to say about food!

Rating: 2
I do believe the cook from Manhattan was being facetious, or to put it simply, sarcastic. By stating the opposing viewpoint in an obviously over-the-top way(obvious to me, anyhow)the intent was to actually support the validity of opinions coming in from "the square states". I cannot say for certain that this was the case, not knowing the cook from Manhattan, but it seemed fairly obvious. Apparently translation was necessary for our friends outside the Metropolitan area...

Oh brother...Manhattan just likes to 'hear himself talk'--must be a real riot at parties.

Finally! Back to some good old fashioned controversy! The "Constant Comment" postings get so darn food-centric around the holidays. I mean c'mon, who really cares if Betty Sue from some Square State in the middle says "even my 8 year-old liked it"; or that Justin from Atlanta thinks something "would be delicious over pasta, too!" I want more snobbery, ignorance, politics, immaturity, tackiness, tastelessness and ass-faced behavior! There's no reason this "kitchen conversation" should be any different than what's really going on in kitchens across America.

I made this Christmas day for my family. If you already have a lot of the ingredients already measured, you just basically throw everything together and pop it in the oven. I got a lot of compliments. It was not the most incredible coffee cake I ever had in my life, but it tasted good and even better with coffee. As for people concerned with health, live a little and this is after all a cooking site, not a health site. If you are on Jenny Craig stay the heck away from here. Quit complaining!

Very good. Would be a great gift, especially with cream cheese and dates. Gail

I didn't make this cake, but read the reviews, as it sounded tasty. To those who complained about a couple of reviewer's comments, "lighten up"! Everyone is entitled to give a review, so don't get your feelings hurt if one reviewer says the cake tastes like it came from a box, and then stomp all over her. Gee. It's just cake.

Rating: 3
I agree that it has that out-of-a-box taste, but it is easy. A good recipe to take to get-togethers. Sue, take your own advice and don't say anything if you don't have something nice to say. What does being liberal have to do with preferring healthy foods? Maybe next time you can write a review that is actually helpful to other cooks.

I loved it. I would like to make a comment to that liberal know it all,(she thinks) get off your everything has to be fresh and non packaged. People like you are so nuts. So if you have nothing nice to say don't say it!!!!

Anxious to try this! I agree w/ the cooks who support letting an individual make his/her own decisions! Being a diabetic, I have watch what I eat.That doesn't mean I don't enjoy making a yummy something for my family or company once in a awhile and if time doesn't allow for a more involved "healthy" recipe, a pre-packaged mix is a great place to start. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I really enjoyed this recipe.I do not do alot of baking so the pre-packaged recipes work great for me.For those of you that do not like recipes using pre-packaged ingredients the solution is simple.Do not make them.

I wish you would stop printing recipes that calls for artificial ingredients, like: packaged mixes, etc., they can only contribute to your weight gain and are not good for your health. In addition, they taste bad, they taste artificial. What's wrong with using good, natural, fresh ingredients? Why do we have to be so lazy?

This recipe is great! And although as a health-conscious individual I, too, agree that when opportune, individuals should make an effort to cook/eat/live healthily, I definitely subscribe to the idea that there are exceptions to rules, and this was one exception I'm glad I made. To the Berkley subscriber-let individuals be individuals once in awhile, OK?

A nice recipe...enjoyed. To the reviewers from Berkely and San Jose, this is not a health food site, it is a recipe site, perhaps you should look else where for your recipe ideas. However, if you want to limit your choices, fine but allow me to decide for myself.

If you don't want to make recipes that include pre-packaged mixes don't make them. It does not mean that recipe "shouldn't" be on the site. This site is for a variety of chefs of different levels and tastes, review should be based on the merits of the recipe not your personal tastes. Some of the best tasting recipes include ingredients that are not healthy. Should we avoid all the buerre blanc sauces that contain 1/2 pound of butter?

I agree with the reviewer from Berkeley, CA. 1/17. NO package mixes, NO TRANS-FATS, PLEASE!! Eat healthy.

I don't normally use box mixes, but I thought I'd give this a try...since I had a surplus of cinnamon chips. My store didn't have the date bread mix, so I subbed cranberry. My family loved it.

First, cinnamon chips are NOT available everywhere, I just happened to spot them in a poshy grocery store in Philadelphia, PA., was intrigued by them and so had them on-hand. Secondly, this cake is NOT worth the hunt. It is just another nice little breakfast bun-ish cake. No big deal...and certainly not worth being patronizing over.

I would just like to let the person from Wisconsin know that you can't always find cinnamon chips in the grocery store so confusion and mistaken substitutions might be made. It's not that people are idiots it's just that when ingrediants are not found mistakes are sometimes made

Awesome! Found the cinnamon chips - altered recipe by using Banana Quick Bread, adding mini chocolate chips and same receipe for streusel - great with coffee and friends!

Rating: 0
Cinnamon sticks are the bark of the cassia tree; ground cinnamon sticks=ground cinnamon, so they're not "wood flavored with cinnamon." The cinnamon chips the recipe calls for are shaped like chocolate chips. You can order them from the Baker's Catalog at www.kingarthurflour.com.

Was confused by "Cinnamon chips." Looked in 3 different stores. Only thing I could find was "Cinnamon Sticks" which is wood flavored with cinnamon to be used in teas, coffee, etc. Do you mean chips like Chocolate Chips? Made recipe without this ingredient. It was good but I think would be great with correct ingredient--Would someone help me find this ingredient to make this great.
