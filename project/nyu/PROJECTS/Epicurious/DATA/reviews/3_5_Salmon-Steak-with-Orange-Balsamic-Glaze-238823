The marinade was delicious but did not really affect the salmon. It was much better on pork chops!

I had an excess of balsamic vinegar, and salmon was on sale at the store, so I tried this. Like others have said, it lacks much oomph. I don't think I'll make this again.

Wow...this was a simple recipe with high impact results! I used lots of fresh rosemary, and fresh squeezed orange juice and like the last reviewer I basted the salmon with the marinade while cooking. Definitely a keeper of a recipe and a go-to recipe when I want to make an impressive "wow" meal.

This salmon dish is fantastic. I also reduced the same marinade ingredients by a little more than half and basted the salmon as it grilled. The salmon and orange balsamic fuse together seemlessly. Best salmon my wife and I have ever had.

This dish is pleasant but a little bland and not memorable to me. It seemed it would be better if there was a thickness to the marinade (like a glaze). If I ever make again, I may add some brown sugar or honey. It meeds more "oomph!"

Orange marinade was delicious. I added 1/4 cup of Chardonnay, along with freshly squeezed orange, red onion and thyme. I served this with grilled vegetables, brown rice, and a rainbow fig, pear and walnut salad. I garnished the salmon with orange slices. A delicious meal.

I followed the recipe to the T, after substituting fresh orange juice for the concentrate, but was disappointed with the result. The fish cooked well but lacked a kick. Won't be making it again.

It was easy and tasty. It made it with fresh orange juice and dried rosemary --no problem.

Very bland. This did not taste like the marinade at all. I only marinated for 1hr per recipe, but perhaps if one left out the citrus for an additional hour or so, it would be better?

I used salmon filets as well. The citrus complements the salmon well, but this didn't blow me away.

Decided it was just too unpleasant outside to want to deal with the grill so cooked it in the oven. Probably a big mistake. Would try this again on the grill and expect it would be better. I thought it was fine, but just not more than that. That said, my 3.5 year old couldn't get enough of it so that in and of itself makes it a winner.

Did not use steaks, I used fillets instead and roasted the fish in the marinade instead of grilling. Was very good with Coho since it is a lighter fish than some King. I would like to try this with lime juice instead of orange next time and that one I think I will grill.

This is exceptional. Not in a fancy complicated way, simply wonderful. Next time I'll make it with the rosemary, I left the recipe at work and thought I had memorized it. I used fresh orange juice and zest. This is a true blue go to recipe.

Very good and simple every day recipe!

An impromptu dinner for five resulted in a desperate dash to the computer to see what Epicurious suggested for a salmon steak. Luckily we had all of the ingredients for the Orange-Balsamic Glaze recipe but what we didnt have was the hour plus suggested for marinating, so we whipped the ingredients together and cooked them a bit on the stove (3-5 min) and poured the sauce directly on the salmon and broiled in the oven. We used the extra rosemary as garnish and it was a hit! We will definitely cook this again however with the intention of taking the time to marinate.

Amazing! I made it with baked chicken and turned out just as well.

I left my salmon in this marinade for two hours and found the salmon lacking in flavour. Perhaps it should have been in there longer.

This marinade is tasty. I used it with chicken instead and salmon and it turned out great. FYI, don't let the meat marinade longer than 6 hours, otherwise it will taste TOO TANGY!! I also added just a little bit of olive oil in the marinade and made the chicken really juicy.

This marinade is very good. We had it with chicken and it was very tasty. FYI, don't ever let any meat marinade longer than 6 hours -- get to be TOO TANGY
