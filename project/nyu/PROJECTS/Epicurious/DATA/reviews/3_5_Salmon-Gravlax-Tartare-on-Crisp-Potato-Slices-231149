made for boyfriends bday cocktail party. had some picky eaters and everyone loved it! did a test run with potatoes and were a huge pain in the a** to make so did cucumber sliced instead. also good on thinkly sliced baguette. did cut down on the salt due to other reviews - you can always add more if you want so better to start with less :)

I've made this a few times now and it's always gone over very well. I didn't find it too salty at all, and the crispy potatoes were great with the taste of the juniper.

warning before you start this recipe...way, way too much salt. we had to add half again as much salmon, more sugar and still too much salt. the potato slices were a pain and nothing less. Even if you cut the slices perfectly evenly, too much work watching when each one crisps...much better on cucumber with a dollop of sour cream on top.

I can't comment on the salmon since I didn't make it, but everyone LOVED the potato slices. I used a mix of German Butterball and some type of French rose-colored potatoes from the farmers' market, and topped the slices with Scottish smoked salmon, crème fraîche, and chives. Much to my surprise, everyone commented on how good the potatoes were. Make sure you season them well and evenly, with fresh-ground pepper (a bit on the coarse side) and kosher salt, because you'll really taste the seasoning, more than you think. They're a bit of a pain because you'll have to remove the slices from the pan a few at a time as they finish cooking, but they're definitely worth this minor inconvenience. Next time I'll use Silpats and maybe that will help.

This is a great recipe for Gravlax in the winter months by serving it on the potato when the normally used cucumbers may not be at their best or too expensive. The salmon Gravlax was much better than the tuna as well.
