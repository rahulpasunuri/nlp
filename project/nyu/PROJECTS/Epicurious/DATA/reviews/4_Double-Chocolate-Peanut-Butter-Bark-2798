We loved this recipe - very smooth and rich. Will definitely go on the Christmas cookie plate. I used the microwave to melt the last bit of white chocolate, and it worked great.

This was okay, but it really wasn't great. I'm a peanut butter lover, however I didn't like the taste in this recipe. Much better recipes out there.

I have been searching for a recipe similar to this for years. This tastes and looks better than I remembered. The ingredients are pricey, so its reserved for special occasions.

This was so good no one would ever guess it's so easy. I skipped the white chocolate on top and didn't miss it. I used lindt chocolate bars.

DELICIOUS!! This looked so pretty before we cut it, after both of the chocolates were swireled in to the peanut butter base. It really tasted just like a peanut butter cup too. They were the hit of our holiday, destined to become a tradition in our house for sure. Super rich though, I'll only be making this recipe once a year!

This was very good but very sweet. Make sure it is served chilled. Very easy to make also and looks pretty for gifts.

Great Holiday treat. Never have enough.

Very easy to make and so scrumptious and sinful. I melted white chocolate chips which worked fine mixed with the peanut butter, but I couldn't get them to melt by themselves to decorate, so I just swirled the bitterseet chocolate with the white/pb mixture. We'll see how fast it goes at a bake sale ... if I don't eat it all beforehand!

Taste's like chocolate peanut butter cups. This is easy to make and pack up for x-mas gifts. I used Ghiradelli's "white chocolate chips for baking" to cut down on chopping all of that chocolate.

This is a favorite among our family and friends at Christmas. It is easy to make, beautiful to look at, and heavenly to eat. A great addition to the standard cookie plate!

I just found this recipe after looking for years for it because I lost the magazine.. I'm hoping this is it. If it is, this Double Chocolate Bark is to die for. I'm anxious to try it out!
