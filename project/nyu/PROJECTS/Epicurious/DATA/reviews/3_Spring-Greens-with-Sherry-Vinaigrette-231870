This went well with the bacon-wrapped eggs with polenta.

I made this along with the Bacon-wrapped eggs with Polenta recipe from the brunch menu. I used only mache, and felt that bacon grease would not flatter this delicate green, so I put in maybe half a teaspoon just for flavor, the rest olive oil. I did not have time to make the separate strawberry dish from the menu, so I added sliced strawberries to the greens, and it was pretty and delicious!
