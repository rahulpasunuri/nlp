A great hearty casserole - easy to make! I made it ahead of time, then baked it for a buffet lunch for weekend guests. Everyone loved it - I just wish I had made two pans of it, because everyone wanted seconds. It took an hour and 15 minutes to cook, but it was cold from the fridge when it went into the oven.

I have made many epicurious recipes throughout the years but this was the most ill conceived of all those I tried. The smell as it was cooking was so bad we were sure that one of the ingredients had gone bad. Inedible!

i have made this at least a dozen times - the trick is to play around with the amount of cheese and back off 1 egg - i have used with pumpernickel and rye bread and a marbled rye - my favorite cheese, like another reviewer's is the havarti with dill - i really like this receipe because you and fool around with it and not screw it up - but really, try 3 eggs not 4 -

I used pastrami instead of corned beef, 3 times as much mustard, and a combo of havarti and muenster cheese. It was a big hit cut into small squares and served as an appetizer at an Octoberfest party.

This was very good - and a great way to use up leftover St. Patick's Day corned beef! I used a loaf of Pepperidge Farm swirl bread (pumpernickel and rye). A few modifications that worked well: I whisked 1 TBSP horseradish and 3 TBSP mayo to the egg and milk mixture, which added flavor and a little bit of a creamy-ness. For some reason, it took more like an hour to bake to the point that it puffed up and wasn't swimming in liquid at the bottom. I will definitely make this again - raves all around in my family.

Way too eggy..You really couldn't discern the sauerkraut flavor at all. The previous reviewer was correct...if you are a Rueben fan you will be VERY disappointed!

I made this receipe for an off ice christmas party one year. It was a big hit. I have made it at times where I experiment with different cheeses. i am a big fan of reuben and this is a great compliment to the sandwich in a convient take along form

Disappointing, especially if you're a huge Reuben fan. I would have used more sauerkraut, and more cheese. There was just too much bread, and even so it got quite watery. I added caraway seeds, which helped on flavor, but it didn't thrill me. It really needs some sort of accompaniment to stand-in for the expected 1000-Isle dressing.

Really good.I made 1/2 this recipe and baked it in a cast iron skillet, topping it with coarse pumpernickel crumbs which had been drizzled with olive oil. A good side dressing is mayonnaise mixed with yoghurt, hot salsa, and papkrika.

Made this dish for a Christmas Morning Brunch. I used Havarti with Caraway & served slightly heated 1000 Island Dressing on the side. Even non-Reuben fans loved it! Great to do since it can sit over- night.

I added a topping of crushed shredded wheat that had some garlic powder and parmesan cheese. Took it to work, and got RAVES.
