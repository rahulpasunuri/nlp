Take it from me, this is totally NOT what you would get in a Chinese restaurant. Very bland. You have to triple the sauce and add broccoli--and still it is mediocre.

This was a nice and easy recipe. It was not a big hit with my 3 yr old, but I liked it.

Doubled the sauce and added a little corn starch. Also added a tsp of Thai chile paste to sauce. We loved this. (Put a little basmati rice under the veggies on the plates.)

Added broccoli and sprouts and a chopped habanero pepper. I cut the chicken in to smaller pieces and sautéed it in sesame oil. Also tripled the "sauce" ingredients. Spiced it right up.

I always thin out chicken breast halves with a sharp knife so they cook more evenly, and that worked well here. Coating thus required more sesame seeds than called for. Also used 150% of the "sauce" ingredients, just because it tasted better, and no gingeroot because it's unnecessary hassle. Finally, mixed chicken slices with veg's and served over rice. With all these modifications, it's a make-again winner!

I expected more of an Oriental flair to this. It actually was good, but too bland for my taste.

A serviceable recipe. It sounded better than it tasted, but the recipe was very easy to make. Good enough for a quick weeknight dinner. Overall, however, the flavors were a little bland.
