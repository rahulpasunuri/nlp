Like this recipe very much. Beef+peppers = love :) Sauce is only moderately flavorful, so that's the only critique. I kicked it up with cayenne and extra balsamic, but it needed even more. Still, we gobbled this merrily and would make it again. FLAVOR - C+ TEXTURE - B EASY TO MAKE - B INEXPENSIVE - B- OVERALL - B-

For taste I would give this a 3.5 but when combined with the ease and speed of preparation it is 4 forks! What a wonderful combination of flavors. Did not change a thing. Iron skillet is the perfect non-stick pan for this recipe.

Quick, easy, and pretty tasty, especially for the effort involved. I use more stock & paste to make more sauce.

I've made this recipe twice and have gotten positive reviews from my notoriusly picky husband. Quick and easy! Pairs well with mashed potatoes. Only downside to using ribeye is the excess fat, which next time I will be trimming off.

This is a great recipe. Fast, easy and very tasty. I made it when it came out in the november 2005 issue and will make it again tonight.

I love this recipe. It's fast and tastes fantastic. The peppers complement the paprika-coated beef surprisingly well, and the tomato paste provides a nice tang. I've tried it with both rib eye and sirloin--the sirloin was fine, but it is better with rib eye.

This was fine - nothing to write home about though. I thought it was rather bland and tasteless overall, which was surprising given the ingredients. Had it the next day for leftovers, and really didn't care for it. However, it's extremely quick to prepare.

This was easy and tasted great. The kids even liked it and asked me to make it again. I served with mashed potates, great comfort food.

This was fabulous! It looked and tasted great. Only minor modifications due to what I had on hand: used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic and added a little bit of left-over onion.
