Have made this often, but without the orange or the ginger. Originally, the stuffing was made exactly as stated in the recipe. This dish complements a palate familiar with Asian fare or one that appreciates a touch of the exotic. This dressing, (prepared recipe exact) was presented beside a turkey dressed and prepared with lemongrass. Very interesting and acceptable combination for some folks. Anyway, now when I make it, I simply use the recipe without the orange or the ginger. Fabulous either way. Would recommend this to those who enjoy crunchy and full flavored dressings. More alluring in presentation than Southern Styled cornbread dressing, but still holds on to the traditional bread component. If you are a traditional New Englander who favors rice based stuffings, give this one a try if cornbread is too offensive. :-)

Made this at Thanksgiving this year and my Mom went back for seconds. (which she rarely does) The orange zest gives it a very clean flavor.

I have made this every year for thanksgiving since it has been published - my family won't let me make anything else! It is a superb recipe that strays from the ordinary, but turns out extraordinary results.

I was very pleased with this recipe -- easy to make, a great mix of flavors, but not unapproachably complex. I made it for my office Thanksgiving potluck and will be making it again for Christmas dinner.

I stuffed the Christmas turkey with this - it got rave reviews!

I've been experimenting with different stuffings for thanksgiving over the last few years...this has been my favorite by far. Next time I may cut down on the amount of sausage, as the stuffing is heavy enough to be a meal in itself with the full amount

Sweet Italian Sausage was not avaible to me on Maui, so I substituted Mild Italian Low Fat Turkey Sausage. It was wonderful. Can definitely recommend this substitution.

My mother was so impressed with the flavors that she insisted on taking the leftovers once Thanksgiving was over. I let the whole bread sit separately from the sausage mix over night and cooked the mixes together on Thanksgiving morning, warming before we served dinner.

We have been making this stuffing since it appeared in the November '97 issue and we knew we would be in Kauai. This is our third year and we've gone from entertaining 8 the first year to 24 this year. We think word is out on Kauai that our Thanksgiving a'la Hawaiian style is superb. The mango/cranberry relish is wonderful also!
