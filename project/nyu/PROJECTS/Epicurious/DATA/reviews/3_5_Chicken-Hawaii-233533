Macadamia nuts (chopped) is an obvious and wonderful garnish. I also used pineapple, limes, and cilantro. I used cutup boneless skinless chicken breasts, 1 t. cinnamon instead of stick, and garam masala. I knew we'd like the sauce, so I doubled the sauce, including using 2 chopped onions and yes, 2 cans of coconut milk. This one was easy and quick to make for me as I even had the butcher cut up the chicken breast.

Awesome! My whole family loved it! I used only chicken breasts and doubled the sauce. The pineapple and toasted coconut are perfect finishing touches. YUM!

Very good, but it needed to the little extras to be great. It was fun to have the chicken and gravy, then let everyone choose their own toppings. Definitely need the pineapple to sweeten the dish a bit.

This recipe is awesome! I don't know that I'd call it "Hawaiian" though. I used boneless, skinless breasts in place of the chicken peices. I think the amount of sauce is enough for 3 or 4 chicken breasts. Served it over rice with extra sauce for the rice. I didn't top with any of the suggested items either... maybe that would have made it more "Hawiian"?

I am an ex-pat Living in Malaysia and we like our food just a bit more spicy, therefore, I have added a teaspoon of chili powder for that extra ziiing.

This was a nice dinner. Easy to prepare and lots of layers of flavor. Served over rice with lime wedges and toasted coconut for garnish. Sauce was a bit thick will thin next time with some wine I think. Got two enthusiastic thumbs up from my non-curry loving husband.

I made this dish the day before a dinner party and let it marinate in its sauce overnight. My guests loved it, would definitely make again with addition of tumeric.

I made this dinner as a thank you dinner for some very good friends. I was very thankful that everyone loved the dish. I took 4 bowls to match my table settings and put the accompaniments in each of the bowls. Fresh Cilantro, Toasted Coconut, Toasted Cashews, and Cubed Pineapple. This is so the guests could pick out what they wanted. This is a very beautiful dish. Also went very nice with Riesling.

Quick & easy to prepare. I served it over brown rice and topped with toasted coconut and chopped peanuts. The fresh ginger really gives the sauce some complexity.
