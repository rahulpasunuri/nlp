A nice variation of plain ol' Vichyssoise, especially when your zucchini plants are excessively productive. As a previous reviewer commented, substituting buttermilk for the half and have adds an extra zing.

We are up to our eyebrows in zucchini and I'm always looking for simple, easy to make and delicious recipes to use them up. This is one of those recipes! Wonderful for a hot summer evening supper.

How many zucchini?

This was better than the sum of its parts, I thought, a lovely marriage of flavors. I used low-fat buttermilk, then finished with 1 T. of cream, chives and pepper in each bowl...and that really worked. It improved the next day, too.

I looked it up in my hard copy and it says to use one pound zucchini, cut into one inch rounds. Everything else in the online version of the recipe is the same as in the magazine. I haven't had a chance to make it yet, though. I'm going to try the zucchini pancakes first.

I think I would like to try this recipe, but it seems to have misplaced the zucchini in the ingredients. I see they are mentioned in the method, so if you could correct that I would be pleased to make it. Vichyssoise is wonderful in the hot summer weather.
