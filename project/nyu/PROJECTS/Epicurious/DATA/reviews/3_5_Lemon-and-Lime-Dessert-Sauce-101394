I made this with Splenda and Smart Balance margerine to try to make it "healthier". It was OK, but I am 100% sure it would have been more fabulous using the real thing. It just had that Splenda taste...I topped it on some angel food cake and some raspberry puree, it looked very pretty, but again make it with real sugar and butter...

I used mostly limes and served this with the lime almond cheesecake. Fantastic.

Wonderful over pound cake & fresh blueberries. Added a dolop of whip cream. Yum! 3 forks for taste--and added fork for being so easy.

I used this sauce on top of some fresh sliced apples and bananas. Very simple and might seem like a weird combination, but presentation is everything.

I made this sauce to go with the Coconut Cake from Gourmet July 2000. My Grandmother has been begging me to make her a coconut and lemon cake for five years. This was my first time baking anything from scratch, but this combo was easy and tasted fabulous! I had to promise to make it for her again next year!

FABULOUS!! This over angel food cake is an awesome summer dessert. Had it after a BBQ, perfect compliment to a hot meal on a hot day!!! Family fav.

I made this on a hot spring day to accompany an angel food cake. It was tangy with a hint of sweetness, and made a lovely light dessert. It was also quick and easy to make. Although the recipe calls for 3 tbsp each of fresh lemon and lime juice, I used 4 tbsp because that's how much I squeezed out of each!
