This frosting was amazing. I was doubtful at first, but as it was whipping up it became lighter and fluffier. The raspberry flavour was nice and strong in the end. I might try this with a lighter tasting chocolate next time (all I had was bittersweet). The consistency and flavour was completely amazing. This will be my go-to chocolate frosting recipe now, hands down.

Really delicious... to avoid a trip to the store I used a few substitutions that I had on hand: I used greek-style yogurt instead of sour cream, grand marnier instead of framboise (I still wanted the boozy taste and didn't mind some orange action going on), and omitted the corn syrup. Despite all of these changes it turned out wonderfully and I used it on chocolate cupcakes yum! so even if you don't have all of the perfect ingredients this recipe is pretty no-fail.

I also made this frosting for a child's birthday cake and so left out the alcohol. That being said, I think that I would like to try it with the alcohol since I think it would make all the difference. I am a fan of dark chocolate, so the semi-sweet chocolate base was wonderful. Preparation was easy and quick. Good for that quick after work prep. Also, I might consider adding red chile powder.

Wow. This frosting is a keeper. It was easy to whip up, spread easily and had a beautiful texture. The taste was fabulous and it was hard not to eat it on its own! I left out the brandy because it was for my daughter's 1st birthday cake, but I'm sure it would add a nice little touch to it. I highly recommend this recipe!

I had to use light sour cream - all I had on hand. The frosting came out a little bit runnier than i wanted, but i loved the taste. Thought maybe the light sour cream might be the issue. I thought this was so good because it is not as sticky sweet as other frostings.

A solid frosting. I used preserves with seeds and it tasted fine. I did not add any brandy since I was making a birthday cake for a kid's party.

Great! I used raspberry jam with seeds, because that's what I had, and couldn't tell the difference. I was using a hand mixer, so it took more like 7 minutes to beat it to the right consistency. I'm definitely making this recipe again.

I also used triple sec, per others' recommendations, and this turned out great. Very soft and easy to work with, although I did get some small chunks of re-hardened melted chocolate from the bottom of the bowl in the finished frosting. There are worse things than small bits of chocolate in your frosting though, no?

The frosting was delicious and I had no problem with the consistency. It was very mousse like and I used it to frost the Double Chocolate Layer cake. There were umm's and aah's when everyone took the first bite. Will be my Raspberry Frosting from now on. Thxs again Epicurious!

This frosting was fabulous! I followed the recipie as written but substituted triple sec for brandy with no noticeable difference. I would beat it for 3 min. as directed because it really changes consistency within those three minutes. I think this will become a family favorite - it sure is mine!

Great taste and, with some modifications, good consistency. I used only half of the liqueur (I used Triple Sec) called for and half the vanilla. Also, I didn't beat the frosting for 3 minutes (I just beat it until well blended). The frosting held up very well (most of the day and still going at room temperature). Oh, and I used raspberry jam with seeds -- it was fine (the seeds were not at all noticeable). Easy and very tasty.

This is absolutely delicious, maybe the best frosting I've tasted. But the consistency is thin and squishy, like the sour cream that it is made of. It makes a nice top layer but not such a great filling, because the top layer of the cake slides around (this is even after refrigerating the frosting for several hours). I didn't have the brandy, so substituted Triple Sec, and the raspberry/citrus combination was great.

I didn't use the brandy, but otherwise stuck exactly to the recipe (everything at room temperature). The consistency was perfect, it spread beautifully, the perfect balance between sweet and tangy. I frosted a double recipe of Flourless Chocolate Cake and the combination tasted like a raspberry truffle.

I love the flavor of this frosting! I had trouble getting it stiff enough to spread, however. I had to add a few spoonfuls of confectioner's sugar to get it closer to the right consistency (still wasn't perfect but I'll keep trying!). A word to the wise--if your sour cream is cold when you add it to the chocolate, the chocolate will harden and form lumps in the frosting. Not being a fan of brandy, I used DeKuyper raspberry liqueur and it was great. I will definitely make this recipe again and try to iron out the kinks.

I've made this several times with the buttermilk cake from "Chocolate Mint Layer Cake" April 99 and it's always a hit. A very nice change from buttercreams, (which I don't care for) it's easy to make, and easy to work with. For the cook who couldn't get it to stiffen enough, did you allow the chocolate to cool sufficiently? That's the only thing I can think of to explain the problem.

I made so many changes, I'm not sure my review belongs here, but I wanted to share my version with everyone because I am so happy with how it turned out. I made this frosting to accompany the chocolate-Merlot cake (see my review there). The person for whom I made the cake does not like raspberry, but does like orange with chocolate. So I did the following: I substituted 2 T. of Merlot for the brandy and I used orange marmalade (heat it and then strain it to remove the bits of peel). I left out the corn syrup. This frosting was excellent and I usually don't like frosting. Chill it for a while to make it more spreadable. Also, I will leave the butter out next time. I added less than the recipe called for but I think it will spread fine without the butter if it is chilled.

Easy. I actually had to use Strawberry preserves instead of raspberry 'cuz, as it turned out, I didn't have raspberry. Anyway, it was delicious. I'm sure it would have been even better with raspberries. I thought of using fresh raspberries, which I had, but decided against it. I didn't have any confectioner's sugar which is why I used this recipe in the first place...and then it was a real winner. Ciao!

While the cake was a disaster, the frosting at least had good flavor. I found it stiff and hard to spread and cannot imagine having enough if I had done the four layers the recipe called for. The cake probably would have been much tastier and not so dry....

Excellent flavor and consistency! While not as thick and creamy as most frostings, I found this recipe wonderful to work with, very easy to spread and get smooth results. I will make this recipe again and again.

I would like to review this recipe, but when I tried to make the frosting it turned to liquid. I followed the recipe and would like to know what I did wrong. I have been using Bon Appetit for many years and this is the first time a recipe did not work. I will say the the cake was delicious.
