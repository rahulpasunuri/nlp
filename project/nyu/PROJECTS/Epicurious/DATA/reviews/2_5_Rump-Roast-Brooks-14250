Rump roasts should be roasted, not braised. I did not - nor would I - make this roast. This would be better served with a chuck roast or something. As for the reviewer who said that a rump roast was a bad cut of meat, not so - it's got perhaps the best balance of flavor, leanness and tenderness when roasted.

I am not sure why I made this. Probably because we had a rump roast in the freezer. After tasting the result, I'm sure I would have been better off if I threw the roast in the crock pot adding wine and a couple of bay leaves to the recipe. It would have been less work, less involvement and would have probably tasted better.

The only saving grace of this cut of meat is if you are willing to eat 1 part roast and 3 parts gravy - which I am not. Don't bother. Feed it to the cat and go buy yourself a better cut of meat. The recipe tries to fix what cannot be...

maybe im just not a rump roast kinda gal... there was nothing particularly wrong with this dish, but there wasnt anything worth writing home about either. everyone liked it, but i wouldnt waste time on it again. glad i roasted a rump at least once tho.

Instead of 6 cups to water I used homemade beef stock. It was well received for a nice Sunday dinner. "homemade" is the key word here.

I definitely did not find this one worth the effort. This was my first disappointment from this web-site.

Followed the recipe, but did not find this to be an exciting dish to taste and serve.

This is a little time consuming, but overall it is worth it. I used 1/2 cup of vodka in it and it was really tender. Made heavenly cold sandwiches as well as hot with the parmesan mashed potatoes.

I made this recipe and it turned out beautifully. Thank you for the correction on the recipe...i.e roast instead of toast! I thought I had omitted an ingredient!

Duh, Dan. I think we can figure that out, fool.

Made the Rump Roast on 1/1/2000. Need to correct one small typo: "Unwrap roast and discard garlic. Dredge toast (roast)". In any case, roast was indeed delicious! I used cornstarch instead of flour to slightly thicked gravy. Served along with rice and corn on the cob.

Really Good!! I marinated the roast over night. The roast came out really tender and delicious!
