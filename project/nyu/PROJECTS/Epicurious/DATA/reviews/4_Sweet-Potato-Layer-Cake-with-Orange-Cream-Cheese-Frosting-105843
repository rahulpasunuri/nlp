I made this for a friend's birthday, and it was a hit! I reconstituted the cranberries in Grand Marnier, and I used pecans as the nuts. I also substituted 1/4 of the powdered sugar with ground pecans, substituted honey for the OJ concentrate, and substituted orange extract for the vanilla. I topped with glazed pecan halves, and it was outstanding!

No real sweet potato flavor here. This recipe isn't for sweet potato- it is basically for pumpkin using sweet potato instead. The cinnamon, ginger and cloves belong elsewhere. Try freshly ground nutmeg and a couple of tablespoons of molasses. For the icing leave out the OJ and use Bourbon.

Amazing! Perfect balance of textures and flavors. Would not change a thing.

I loved this cake. The frosting tastes like a creamsicle! The cake was just like a spice cake or pumpkin cake, but a prettier orange color and more subtle flavor.

I've made this cake three times. The last time it was part of an auction....I can't tell you how many compliments I received on it. It is very pretty on the table and tastes great too. I didn't change anything in the recipe.

Good, not spectacular.Basicall y a carrot cake with sweet potatoes. People enjoyed it, no one raved or asked for recipe.

This is an excellent cake recipe that's pretty much foolproof. I made this in a 9 x 13 pan and increased the baking time to closer to 45 minutes. And I put all of the icing on top. The candied orange peel isn't essential. I used grated orange zest that I tossed in the sugar with the nuts and cranberries. Definitely a refreshing alternative to the more common carrot cake.

This recipe was a HIT! I cooked this for both sides of the family last year for thanksgiving and for the girls at work. Everyone loved it. Well worth the work!

I made this for Christmas with family and it was by far the best dessert on the table. I used orange extract instead of the concentrate. The flavor is wonderfully different from classic carrot cake, and the texture is divine. One note: remember to level the cake you intend on using for the bottom layer so the cake sits sturdily on the platter. Delicious.

It wasn't awful, but I feel there are much better cakes out there. Neither I nor my boyfriend liked the texture of the cranberries in the cake, the cake itself was boring, and the frosting was bland without lots of extra orange, but even then, nothing to write home about. I will not bother with this again.

This cake was delicious. I made it for Thanksgiving and am still getting compliments on it. I omitted the cranberries, but the cake was moist and not too sweet and the icing was the perfect accompaniment. Will definitely make again! Think I might try a little coconut next time.

This cake is wonderful by itself and has a great not too sweet taste. It is lighter than I expected yet it is moist. The flavor is similar to carrot cake. Simply delicious. I received many compliments.

Only used 2C powdered sugar and so reduced the butter to 1/2 stick in the frosting - perfect.

Rating: 2
I added extra cinammon and a little crystallized ginger along with the powdered ginger; no cloves because I don't like them - cake needed a LOT more spice. With the frosting it was good, but can't stand on it's own as I made it. I'll definately make them again, just add more spices and chopped craisins!

i recieved so many compliments on this cake. it is delicious. however, i would recomend baking the sweet potatoes the night before to save time.

I have made this cake every Thanksgiving since the recipe first appeared in Bon Appetit. My family and in-laws love the cake, and request it year after year. I follow the recipe exactly each time (unsure why so many people recommend skipping the icing other than being overly wary of sugar and fat -- it's sooo yummy and a wonderful complement to the cake!) This cake has unique, festive fall flavors and is very pretty when garnished with cranberries and orange peel. I highly recommend it.

This was a beautiful and delicious cake. The contrast of the white frosting was stunning against the red of the cranberries.

Rating: 3
I made this yesterday for dinner with my in-laws and everyone liked it a lot. The cake by itself has a great not too sweet taste. Next time I'll increase the amount of cinnamon and ginger to give a little more flavor. It would make a great coffee cake with a little orange glaze or no icing at all.

I have made this cake three times and it was wonderful. I baked the potatoes in the oven, wrapped in foil, for about 1 1/2 hours at 375 degrees. I think they caramlize better with the foil and are moister than when microwaved. Also, I used 2 1/2 cups of sugar in the frosting and it was just perfect. I think its better if you make a day ahead, and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight. I decorated with potato vine leaves and jasmine flowers from the garden -really beautiful.

Rating: 4
This was very good. I made cupcakes out of these skipping the topping. Baking for about 20 minutes. To enhance the orange flavor in the icing I added 1 tsp of fresh orange zest. I subbed macadamia nuts for the pecans or walnuts. Had extra frosting due to making the cupcakes so plan on making 1/2 batch more as cupcakes. Perfect fall recipe.

Excellent recipe. A lot like carrot cake. My only suggestion is to reduce the amount of oil.

I've been wanting to make this cake for 2 years since just before my son was born, I finally had the time and the right opportunity this year (2003) and it was well worth the wait. This was an absolutely delicious cake--moist and flavorful and simple to make. Made it for Thanksgiving dinner at my sister-in-laws and didn't change a thing (except for less sugar in the icing). At first everybody was skeptical because of the "sweet potato thing" but then my neice tried it and started raving about it and soon everybody was asking for the recipe. However, I used less sugar in the icing and it was still WAY too sweet and sticky for my taste.I skipped the candied cranberries (thought the cake was sweet enough as it is) and just placed regular dried cranberries and crushed walnuts on top. Next time I think I will just skip the icing altogether. Maybe make 2 seperate cakes or one layer cake and just leave it as is or sprinkle a bit of powdered sugar ontop. Also next time I think I will cut the fat content by replacing all that oil with applesauce which works really well in other such cakes. Hopefully it will in this one too. The cake freezes wonderfully too so I can make the full batch and keep one cake in the freezer for "emergencies."

I made this cake last Thanksgiving and everybody loved it. I am going to make it again this Thanksgiving for a different audience. I made no revisions to this recipe except for not garnishing the cake with candied orange peel as I did not have any. Instead, I sprinkled finely grated orange zest using a Microplane over the cake and it was beautiful. I liked using frozen O.J. concentrate in the frosting; I think it definitely made the frosting taste orangey. I thought this recipe was perfect as it was written. I loved the addition of dried cranberries and my cake had no problem with dryness, in fact, it was very moist and wonderful!

Rating: 2
Based on some of the reviews, I used 1 tsp. vanilla in the frosting, and thought it was very good. 1 hour was not enough to set, but then I didn't check it again for a few hours, and it was great. The cake was a bit hard, though; I don't know if I perhaps cooked it too long or it was something else I did. I cooked 1 half for 5 minutes longer, because it didn't seem to be done in 30 minutes. This could have overdone it. I also microwaved diced potatoes, and then put them in the oven for a few minutes to make sure they were dry. Perhaps this caused the mixture to be too dense. Next time I'll try baking them as the recipe says. (Just trying to skimp on time.)

Rating: 4
A wonderful cake. I made it for a club meeting and used a 13x9x2 so serving would be easier. The dried cranberries add both taste and texture to an already great tasting cake. I candied some tangerine peel and with the sugared nuts and cranberries on top it really looked special. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 4
A delicious and beautiful layer cake perfect for Thanksgiving weekend. Definitely add orange extract to the icing for a more pronounced orange flavor and let assembled cake chill at least 3 hours.

As avid sweet potato lovers, my family absolutely went crazy for this cake. I never can follow a recipe exactly, so I substituted the ginger and cloves for nutmeg and added about 1/2 a stick of butter to give it more of a sweet potato pie flavor. Also left out nuts and cranberries. For extra flavor, I added orange extract to the frosting.

I've made this twice in a month for gatherings and have received great raves. I use fresh orange juice,orange zest and 1/4 tsp. orange extract in the frosting, omitting the frozen concentrate and candied peel.

Loved this cake. I am not fond of cranberries so I left them out(will try raisins next time). The frosting needed more orange flavor, though, next time I will use orange extract instead of vanilla and make it one tsp. instead of a half tsp.

This was a great recipe. Our family raved over it at Thanksgiving and people fought over the last pieces. We put about 1/3rd less of the flour mixture than recommended and ended up with a very moist, delicious cake.

Rating: 3
The flavor of the cake was delicious! The frosting was extraordinary, as another reviewer noted, just like a creamcicle. The only reason I didn't give it four forks is that it was a bit dry, I baked it for the recommended period of time. Next time I'll shorten the baking time.

This is a drop dead, table pounding, beyond delicious cake! I made it last year and everyone went nuts, I made it again this year and people had their faces in the cake plate, going back for seconds and thirds! Nothing but rave reviews and requests. It freezes beautifully, actually tastes better (if that is possible)Had something similar in New Zealand, they had slivers of dried apricots and toasted pumpkin seeds, which I added. Unbelievable!!!!

Rating: 4
WONDERFUL-after a few changes, I used 3lbs sw. potates & 5 eggs to make it moister. Which made the cooking time longer, I covered the cake towards the end of bakeing w/ foil to prevent over browning. I took it to a pre-Thanksgiving party & everyone loved it. ( 8 people ask for the recipe) I hope it this might work for you.

I agree with the reviewer below. The cake is too dense. I also agree with the reviewer who said her cake came out dry. So did mine. I thought the frosting was too sweet. I have never had candied cranberries and was not pleased with their taste. The nuts in the cake were overkill. I made this cake as a test run for thanksgiving dinner. I am happy I did because it would have been an utter disappointment to my family.

The first time I made this cake was for a party at a friends home. It was an instant hit and everyone wanted to know how to make this wonderfully moist, dense, and delicious cake! I have made this cake several times since and it will be one of those recipies you just have to pass on to your children...... even if they are boys! Try it. You will be glad you did. (I made it in a bunt pan and made the icing more fluid to run down the cake. It came out great!)

I made this for an office party and it received rave reviews. Several thought it might be carrot cake--the flavor is subtle. Since it had to serve at least 18, I made it in a 9x13 pan, which works just fine. so. The frosting is wonderful, and I had lots leftover. We've been enjoying the icing between 2 graham crackers--yummy! Next time I make this, I'll microwave the sweet potatoes to save some time.

Very good cake! I'm a sweet potato lover, so I knew I'd like it but wasn't sure if my husband would. I didn't tell him what kind of cake it was to avoid him to be spectacle about "sweet potato cake". He took the cake to his work and everyone loved it. A funny thing was they had no idea what kind of cake it was and thought it was carrot cake with some cherries.... how ignorant these guys are.... but the point is, they loved this cake!

skipped the frosting all together, and subsituted the dried cranberries with raisins. turned out to be tasty and full of flavor- perfect with a cup of tea. would definately make it again

Left out the cranberries and the clove (didn't have either) and used grand marnier (as suggested by an earlier reviewer) instead of the orange juice. Very surprised and pleased with the results. They definitely mean it when they say the sides of the 9 inch pans need to be at least 2 inches - this cake rises quite a bit.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and at first people were a little scared to try it (because it wasn't pumpkin pie) but then they all joined in. People couldn't believe that it was made with sweet potatos... and I am the biggest sweet potato advocate. Nutritious and DEEEELICIOUS

Although it was delicious and I couldn't stop eating it all Shavous, which is what I made it for, I think the frosting's so good that it takes away from the taste of the cake, which is very rich and delicious too. [also, the frosting reminds me of a creamsicle, doesn't it?]

Rating: 4
Just made it - gorgeous! But I cut the sugar big time in the frosting - does it really call for 3 1/4 cups?? Isn't that A LOT?! I only used 2 cups and it's sweet enough...Whatever. It came out great and I highly recommend it.

I made this cake for Christmas dinner. It was truly wonderful! Everyone loved it. I needed to substitute pecans for the walnuts because of an allergy issue, and I used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese, mainly because that's what I had on hand. I find the difference between the Neufchatel and regular cream cheese to be indistinguishable in all of my cheesecake recipes, but in this case, I felt that the frosting didn't set up as well as it would have with cream cheese. I'll find out when I make it again, which I will certainly be doing soon. This one's definitely a keeper!

Rating: 3
A delicious cake and a big hit! I used Tofutti cream cheese for the frosting, because my husband can't eat dairy and we keep kosher and I wanted to serve the cake after a meat meal. My husband usually will not eat the tofu-based dairy replacements, but you really can't tell with this recipe. He loved it!

i made this cake for christmas day dessert and it was a hit. everyone thought that it was very similar in taste to carrot cake but not nearly as sweet. the icing was worth four forks alone. cake was very moist. will definatly make it again. learned a lesson- do not attempt to ice cake while it is at all warm. it will melt and be a mess.

I used left over sweet potato and orange puree with almond streusel- recipe from the same 11/01 issue. Had to add water to the left overs to moisten them some. Substituted almonds for the walnuts, and added almond extract to the icing instead of vanilla. Yum!

I made this cake for Thanksgiving. It went over very well - I asked everyone to guess what the "mystery" ingredient was... most people thought it was either carrot or spice cake. Instead of candied orange peel, I used orange-flavored cranberries - this worked well. Also, I wonder about substituting (in a pinch) canned pumpkin for the sweet potatoes?

This is a fantastic recipe plus it's easy to make. It tastes just like a carrot cake. Nobody could beleive it was sweet-potato. Very moist. The orange in the frosting isn't overpowering, just a hint. I made extra frosting.

This cake is scrumptious! I made a substitution of pecans for walnuts -- being a native Georgian! And I omitted the candied orange rind. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a "T" and it came out beautifully. In fact, it won first place at my church's cake contest! A great alternative to carrot cake and perfect for Thanksgiving. Thanks for the recipe!
