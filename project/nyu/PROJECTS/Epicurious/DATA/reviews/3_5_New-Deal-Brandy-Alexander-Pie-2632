This was too sweet for my taste, but it was beautiful, elegant, and pretty easy. The white chocolate flavor really comes through, so if you don't like white chocolate, you might not like this.

Delicious! My guests loved it. Everyone has a disaster once in a while and i thought this was going to be mine when I discovered that what I thought was creme de cacao in my pantry was actually blue curacao! I ended up substituting 1/4 cup melted semi-sweet chocolate for the creme de cacao and it was still excellent!
