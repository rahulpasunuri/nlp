Fabulous! I would recommend adding 1 cup chicken broth before putting in the oven.

A simple and wonderful dish. It is better still if you cut back on the butter/oil by 1/2, keep in the oven for 1 1/2 hrs., add canned whole potatoes 30 minutes before oven time is over, add whole mushrooms 15 minutes before oven time is over, and add frozen string beans 10 minutes before oven time is over. We used chicken thighs (bone in) and it was a very hearty dish.

This recipe was excellent! I made it exactly as written using chicken thighs, cooked it in my La Cruset like pot, never basted it and it was perfect! Falling off the bone tender with lots of good juices. Even my husband liked it. Thanks Epicurious.

Warning! I made this last night, the flavor combination sounded great. I have to admit that I did not baste it during cooking, went for a walk instead. When I lifted the lid to serve, there was a mass of burnt onion and carrot on the bottom of the pan! The chicken was still edible, but barely. As I put it into the oven I said to myself,"this would be GREAT with some white wine or chicken broth in it!" Should have listened to myself!
