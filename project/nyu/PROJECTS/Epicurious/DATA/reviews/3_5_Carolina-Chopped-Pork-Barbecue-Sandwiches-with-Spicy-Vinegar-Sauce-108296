Wow...this is sooooo good. I realized at the last minute that I didn't have brown sugar so I substituted honey instead. Amazing barbeque sauce.

Many ppl have issue with the BBQ sauce being vinegar based...Being a TXN, I can tell you it takes some getting used to. We moved to NC when I was 16 and I could not stand the BBQ; the vinegar based sauce just did not meet my TX requirements for a sauce. PLUS, in NC they put slaw on EVERYTHING :( I ordered more than one hamburger before I remembered to ask for 'no slaw'...same w/the pulled pork sandwiches. Give the sauce a chance, it grows on you. I love it now and I even crave a good pig pickin'.....Smoke a half a small pig on the pit and keep basting it w/the sauce until it's falling off the bone. Filling the rib cage as it is sitting on the grate with that side up and let it evaporate before you turn it. When it's falling off the bone, everyone picks off what they want, fills their plate with slaw, baked beans and potato salad...yum! A great fun gathering for family and friends. This sauce is also terrific on chicken. Flatten a whole chicken and cook to perfection, basting as you go.

Smoking meat is labor intensive if you don't have a smoker and need to improvise, like I do, using a barbecue/grill. This is very typical smoked meat, which in my opinion is always good when you prepare it yourself. Add the not to sweet vineagar sauce and this is a great recipe. The only drawback is the time, as the smoking usually takes up an afternoon.

Sauce is the best I've ever tasted. Have since used it on everything I've pulled off the smoker...fish, fowl, beef, as well as pork. Soak some shredded cabbage in the sauce and place on the pork sandwiches. Delightful! Substituting turbinado sugar and honey for the brown sugar is quite good as well.

This certainly isn't an Eastern N. Carolina BBQ recipe. Eastern Carolina BBQ sauce (served w/ chicken or pulled pork) is a mixture of the following: (1) Apple Cider Vinegar, White Vinegar - either or both combined (2) Red Pepper Flakes (3) Brown Sugar (4) Hot Red Pepper Sauce, like Tabasco or Texas Pete (5) Salt & Pepper. Proportions to taste. Sugar dissolves better when you heat the vinegar first. Make sauce thicker for a glaze. Refrigeration suggested.

I did not do the pork as followed but did make the sauce. It was quite pungent on its own, but once mixed with the pork it was wonderful. It is very different than the bbq sauces that I am used to (thinner), but my boyfriend and I really enjoyed its uniqueness.

With a bit of modification this recipe was wonderful. I cooked it on a weber and the style in which a weber cooks allowed me to smoke this in about 2 hours with seperated method. I also only used a cup and half of vinegar. I cooked a large boston butt 8lbs then brought it inside and pulled the meat off triming off fat and skin. Then added remaining sauce and cooked on the stove top til it fell apart about 1 hour.

The barbecue sauce was so overwhelming because of the vinegar, way too much. I tried to tone it down with more ketchup and brown sugar but it didn't help much. The meat was good although I finished it in the oven at 250 wrapped in heavy duty foil after grilling for about and hour. Very tender and good.

I have not tried this recipe but have to mention that in the Carolinas and Virginia when making traditional "chopped barbeque" the "tough rind" is not discarded but trimmed of excess fat chopped up and added to the meat. Cider vinegar, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper are then added. That's pretty much it! I will however try this version.
