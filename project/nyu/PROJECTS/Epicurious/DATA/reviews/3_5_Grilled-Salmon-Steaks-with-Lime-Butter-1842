Seriously easy and delicious! I did what others suggested; I added about 1/8 cup more lime juice (fresh squeezed), plus about 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder. I left out the pepper because my hubby can't stand it. Hubby's comment, "This has got to be one of the best meals I have ever had." I have to agree.

Wonderful, quick, and easy with a light taste. Made it for lunch outside. Grilled the salmon over charcoal. Served it up with some toasted cous cous and a glass of sauvignon blanc. A key lime pie afterwards would have topped it off. I will try it with garlic next time as recommended by other reviewers.

Was easy and tasty, but I second the reviews that the lime/butter combo is very mild, but that's no problem if you have a good fish steak.

This recipe scores big points for simple ingredients, quick prep, and great taste that does not overpower the goodness of the steak. I took the advice of other reviewers and added a clove of garlic to the marinade. From start to finish dinner took less than 30 minutes, including cleaning the grill!

This is a definite keeper. I enjoyed this simple and delicious preparation for salmon. As others suggested, I added a bit more lime juice and a spoonful of sugar, modifications that I'll keep. If I were to add lime zest, I'd save it for the sauce and serve over sticky white rice.

This was so easy, it was a big hit will everyone and I will make it again and again. Just super

I would not make this recipe again. Didn't have much flavor to it. Really easy preparation but lacks any kind of distinct flavor.

YUM! We will make this dish again and again - very easy and very tasty. I threw in a little lemon juice and garlic powder at the recommendation of other viewers. I have recommended it to others.

This was simply delicious. I thought the amount of lime juice called for was just enough. we had grilled potatoes and grilled eggplant with it and it was the perfect summer meal.

This was fantastic. I added a little fresh grated ginger, fresh lemon thyme from my garden to the butter. FRESH salmon is a must. I might try a little grated or minced garlic next time also. So simple you must try it!

Perfect for salmon lovers. If you want rich, simple flavor to enhance but not overwhelm your salmon, this is the way to go. It isn't exciting, but it allows the salmon to be the star!

Can't believe I haven't reviewed this one before...have made it several times...each time thinking this is a simple summer evening meal. Increase the lime juice by 50% and add some lime zest. Add some good summer veggies and enjoy.

I WOULD MAKE THIS RECIPE AGAIN WITH MORE ADJUSTMENTS. I USED LEMON JUICE INSTEAD OF LIME. ADDED GARLIC POWDER, ONION POWDER, DRY DILL AND PEPPERCORN MEDLEY GRINDER TO THE BUTTER LET THEM REHYDRATE IN THE BUTTER THEN LET THE SALMON MARINATE FOR 1/2 HOUR. I THEN GRILLED THE 1 POUND SALMON STEAK FOR 5 MINUTES ON 1 SIDE AND 4 ON THE OTHER BASTING WITH THE BUTTER MARINATE AND LETTING THE SALMON STEAK BLACKEN SLIGHTLY. THE NEXT TIME I WILL TRY THE LIME JUICE AND A SLIGHTLY SMALLER SALMON STEAK.

I used lemon juice instead of lime and some lemon&herb seasoning as well as pepper. I had never cooked salmon before and it turned out really good!

Added some fresh ginger and extra lime. If you get a quality piece of fish, nothing too extravagant is needed to make it taste good. This perfectly complemented a very rich and flavorful salmon steak. Served with Quinoa with mango and curried yogurt (http://food.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=108112), definitely a keeper meal.

Boring! I even added cilantro and ginger and it still tasted blah. Skip it.

Easy and yummy -- my entire family loved it asked me to make it again. It could use less butter and more lime.

Great. My girlfriend and I made this and it was superb. We added a little less than a tablespoon of chopped ginger to the marinade and it went brilliantly with the salmon.

this was okay . . .i'd do it again, but with modification, it's just missing something. i even put in some cilantro but that didn't really do it . . . maybe something sweet, like sugar or honey would help??? but the recipe is a great start

Increase the lime juice by 25%

This recipe will be only as good as the salmon that you buy (so best to do with wild Alaskan salmon- not farm). Everyone else is right, this recipe is a simple, quick way to prepare salmon- it also tastes that way- which is fine- but not that exciting or complementary. A tastier complement to salmon is a brush of herbed butter.

Rating: 4
Very simple, surprisingly delicious, lets the salmon take on the grill flavor and compliments the fish w/butter and lime. Excellent!!

I have made this several times and we like the recipe just the way it is. We prefer to taste the fish and not a lot of covering-up ingredients, and this one is great for that.

I agree with the previous review. There are much better salmon recipes out there. I thought from the ingredients that the salmon would have a lot more flavor, but I was disappointed. (I used lime zest in addition to the juice, too). Probably won't make this one again.

Rating: 2
Gee, it looks like I'm the only one who can't give this recipe a rave review. I even added the lime zest as suggested by other reviewers, and I used top notch salmon. True, it would have been better charcoal grilled, but what wouldn't? (I used an indoor grill.) I gave the recipe two forks, and my dinner guest gave it two and a half. I think there are many, many better ways to prepare salmon, and ways that are just as easy. Finally, it was tasty, but not memorable, and I won't repeat the recipe.

Incredibly easy and absolutely delicious. Excellent lime flavor in the salmon. Our newest favorite grilled salmon recipe!

I started with great salmon bought at Pure Food Fish Market at Seattle's Pike place market. I stacked all the coals on one side and placed salmon filet on the opposite side of grill. Using wood chips enhanced the flavor. Grilled for about 22 minutes, opening once to spread more marinate with a brush. Lime zest was a great idea. Great main course. Enjoyed with a fresh green salad.

I've made this twice with fillets rather than steaks and it turned out great. I usually don't like grilled salmon (I prefer it smoked) but this was delicious. It's hard to believe that such a simple recipe can have such great results. Would be an impressive entree for a novice cook.

Delicious and simple! Would serve it with a simple rice pilaf and steamed asparagus.

I agree with everyone who said "not enough lime!" I used this on a char fillet (similar to salmon, but lighter), and it was wonderful--I added the lime zest someone else suggested, which definitely helped. A yummy, quick, light summer dish! (But watch out for grill flare-ups; the marinade acts like lighter fluid!)

This is so quick and easy- my family loved it and it is fine enough to serve dinner guests.

This recipe was great! After reading that the other reviewers found there was not enough lime taste I added not only extra lime juice, but about a tablespoon of fresh lime zest.......absolutely fantastic! The zest is what it needed! This will definitely be made again in our house. Made a simple meal of brown rice and zucchini on the side and it was perfect. (Put a bit of the maranade over the brown rice....mmmmm!)

This recipe is very fast and easy to make. The flavor of the lime with the salmon is just right,not to overpowering. I used I can't believe it's not butter instead of real butter and it worked beautifully with less calories. We had some left over fish, so the next night I flaked some of the salmon into a salad. The flavor of the grilled fish was great with the other ingredients in the salad.I used fillets instead of steaks. I will be making this dish again.

This was certainly a very easy recipe. The fish came out moist and tender and it was very flavorful. I expected a bit more lime to come through the butter flavor, though. Even so, I'd definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
Very easy, very quick and very elegant. The lime and butter sauce quickly solidifies, so I would advise brushing it on the steaks while it is still warm. Let the fish come to room temperature to do this. Also, feel free to add more lime juice as this flavour is not as pronounced as it could be.

Wonderful recipe!! Extra butter can be frozen, and then used on top of salmon fillets which have been broiled in the oven with just a little onion salt on them.

The best salmon I've ever had! I used fillets with the skin left on one side and didn't need to flip the fish on the grill. It worked perfectly.

This was wonderful, and easy to do. I served it with julienned zucchini, yellow squash and carrots and the lime butter was great on the veggies as well.

I prepared this for an "impromptu" party. Not only was it quick to prepare it was delicious! Everyone raved about the salmon. I used a fillet as I didn't have steaks on hand.

I thought that this recipe was very easy to use - only I'm not very skilled with the BBQ and cooking fish - our meals turned out great! I wasn't impressed with the Salmon Steak selection at our grocery store, so I used Salmon filets instead...my husband wanted more!
