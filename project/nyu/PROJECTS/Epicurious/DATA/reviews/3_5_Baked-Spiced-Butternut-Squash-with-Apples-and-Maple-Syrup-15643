I came here to send this recipe to yet another person who has requested it because they have eaten it at my house, and it occurred to me that I have made it for Thanksgiving every year since 1998. There is no need to revise this recipe, just make it. (Do yourself a favor and get the butternut squash already peeled and halved from the grocery store!) It is the best recipe I have ever gotten from Bon Appetite Mag.

I made this with pumpkin last year for a very discerning crowd. It was outstanding. I was asked to bring it again this year for Thanksgiving.

This is an outstanding recipe - truly scrumptious. I made it for this Thanksgiving and everyone agreed that it was a keeper! The butternut squash is reminiscent of sweet potatoes, but I think I prefer the squash's texture and in this preparation it is delightfully buttery. The recipe reheats very well if you somehow don't manage to finish it all in one sitting!

I'm generally not much of a squash fan, but this was fantastic. The squash doesn't come out too mushy and the flavor is delicious. The one thing I will do differently next time is cut the apple slices a lot thicker so they stay a bit more firm.

This was quite tasty, but will plan to do a few modifications next time around. I'm going to try a little lemon zest, 1/2 the butter, and a little less maple syrup, too. It was a bit sweet and mushy, so less time under the foil is recommended. I may try a bit more salt & pepper, and think a few mild shallots might be a nice addition as well. Ah, and no one is mentioned how AMAZING your house smells when this is in the oven! Crisp fall breezes and this dish - can't be beat. MMmm! Would be a wonderful Thanksgiving side dish to bring along.

Tradition in our family now. "Tastes like desert!" Add the apple butter for best flavor.

I made this last Thanksgiving, and was very pleased with the results. It was a lot of work (how do you peel a whole butternut squash, anyway???) but worth it in the end. The spices were spot-on, and I didn't think it was too sweet... This will become a tradition, especially since the BF doesn't like yams and I could pretend it was healthier (fewer carbs, right???)

I've made this every year since 1998 for Thanksgiving. Everyone calls to ask if I'm making it! Woth the work. I make it the day before.

This was a big hit with the family at Thanksgiving. I did forget to baste in the last 20 minutes and think it would have been even better if I had.

I am not a big fan of maple flavored dishes, so I made this with some brown sugar instead. It was a big hit with all ages in my family. Enjoy.

This was wonderful. I used mulled cider because I did not have apple juice and I did not have real maple syurp so I used brown sugar. The blend of butternut and apple is devine

This is a fabulous way to serve butternut squash! The people in my family that don't even like squash loved this! I chose to cut the squash and apples into 1/4in. cubes and then layered them. It didn't get as mushy this way. I also put it under the broiler for 10 minutes right before serving, it browned beautifully and made for an excellant presentation. The texture is very different from your regular mashed squash, and with the aromatic smells and flavor from the cinnamon and allspice, everyone just had to try it! I made this for Thanksgiving, and Christmas Eve and both times, several people asked me for the recipe. I will definitely make this dish again!

This was a pretty decent hit at two holiday parties I had. I do think, though, that it needs a little kick - I added more black pepper and salt the second time, and it was better that way.

This is the best squash recipe ever! I have been making it since I received the Nov98 issue. I sometimes add dried cranberries or golden raisens, vary the type of apples. Definately half the butter and don't baked it covered for so long, not so mushy. It could very well be the makings of a pie. As for being too sweet, my guess is people are not using pure maple syrup, but that high fructose cornsyrup stuff. What is no sugar maple syrup anyways??? In fact, just emailed the recipe to a friend for Thanksgiving this year. Great stuff!!!!!

This was great and so easy! I sprinkled currants on top before baking. Only one complaint that it was too sweet. (I disagree and think it's much better than any standard Thanksgiving sweet potato dish).

I have made this side dish to bring to my sister's for Thanksgiving every year now for about 5 years. You can do everything in advance and just warm up in the micro or oven.

Rating: 3
This dish is very sweet but I like it as part of a holiday menu. It contrasts nicely with the blandness of turkey and mashed potatoes. Be sure to use tart cooking apples that won't go mushy when cooked (Macs are perfect). The second time I made it I used half the butter and preferred that.

Tried first time for a family birthday dinner and everyone raved about it. I substituted no sugar maple syrup for the regular type without sacrificing taste. I will make this again and again. Simple and yummy.

Not bad, not great, tasty enough but nothing I'd make again. We all love butternut squash but it's not used to best advantage here. For our taste everything was a little too sweet and a little too mushy.

Great dish for the Hollidays. To other reviewers. I first tried this recipe at the in-laws without my tools or knowledge of peeling a butternut squash. The second time first pre-bake the squash in the microwave 15 min. on high after the length-wise cut, then cut and peel into slices. Very simple and worth the time for the product. Yummy

What is the big deal about peeling the squash? Just get out your potato peeler and have at it, it's not any harder then peeling a potato. A great dish for any meal and easy to do.

Very good. Used less butter, and added raisins. Very similar to the recipe in the Nov 95 issue.

I was so surprised by how delicious this was. I'm not a great exact follower of recipes and I did my usual "sloppy" cooking - just poured the juice and syrup over squash+, then the melted butter. I added a sprinkling of cinnamon sugar and a dash of nutmeg. I used Carnival squash, butternut squash, and apples and just sweet potatoes and whatever misc. squash was left in a second casserole. IT ALL STILL CAME OUT TASTING UNBELIEVABLE! My family ate it as a vegetable, but thought I'd made a mistake and served them dessert.

This recipe was a great alternative to sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving. The amount of butter seemed excessive, so I will reduce the amount by half next time I make this dish. I cut the squash into rounds and cut off the skin of each slice so that there was a large, flat surface for the "peeling" process. Yum!

This is one of my favorite holiday recipes. I can't stand recipes such as yams with marshmallows. So boring. This recipe has complex flavors and textures. I get raves when I make this recipe, and nobody misses the yams (I love yams. I just don't want them with every holiday dinner for 20 years). Peeling the squash is the only hard part. I will have to check the review of the person who didn't peel them.

I have made this dish several times and have always gotten rave reviews. Everyone this year asked for the recipe. I was looking at the other reviews and someone said too much sugar... There's no sugar added to the recipe. It's sweet but not too sweet.. The hardest part is peeling the squash but I noticed someone else said that's not necessary. I try it unpeeled next time.

I guess I am accustomed to the plain and simple sweet potato casserole, this was just not what I anticipated. It was good but it was not what my tastebuds were wanting! My guests did not complain but they did not rave over it either.

Turned out great!! I made this for guests that had never had sweet potatoes before, and they couldn't get enough of them. I made them the day before and follwed the microwave method for reheating. Perfect fall dish.

This dish was a great addition to our Thanksgiving feast. The rich sweetness was just the right compliment to cornbread dressing. My husband, who does not generally like vegetables, has actually requested this dish for Christmas too! We have a winner!

This dish is one of the favorites at our Thanksgiving table every year. I use squash or sweet potatoes and find it to be equally good with either. Even my mother-in-law, who prefers the standard candied yams with marshmallows, loves this!

Great recipe!! My son-in-law is a food-dud, makes no comments about anything, but has actually asked specifically for this. I made it with yams, (which he says he hates) and added a light topping of pecans during the uncovered baking time.

Great recipe! Even better if you add sweet potatoes as well. This recipe has been made so many times in my house that it has even earned its own name: "Squappleato".

Great news for those who hated the peeling. Don't peel the squash. I know it sounds odd but it works wonderfully. The skin is not tough at all!! This was a great recipe.

I love this recipe! I can't believe anyone would call it too racy. The peeling is the hard part (I have carpal tunnel) but I don't care. You can assemble and bake it the day before and reheat in oven or microwave. I lost my magazine with this recipe. Just found it on the net. Yea!

Very different taste, a blend of sweet apples and the not normally sweet squash. It was interesting but a little to racy for my tastes.

Excellent recipe that has also become a holiday tradition in our house. It's equally good when substituting yams for the squash. My wife almost demands that I make this dish every T-day.

I cooked this at Christmas for a crowd of 20. I doubled the recipe and it was a lot of peeling! However, the result was well worth it. I precooked the squash just a bit in the microwave (5 minutes upside down in a 1/4 of water) to speed up the bake time. Worked great. I'm making it again!
