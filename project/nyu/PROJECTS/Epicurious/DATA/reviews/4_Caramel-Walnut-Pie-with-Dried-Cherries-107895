I agree that the crust wasn't great - too crunchy and tough, not flaky. The filling, however, was delicious. This pie is rich and full of flavor and texture. I substituted something called "Brown Rice Syrup" for the corn syrup, which wasn't available at my local co-op, and it worked very well. I'll definitely make this pie again!

This was wonderful, my daughter wants me to call it the Far Side Pie. I used the cherries, I think it is a must. Used my own pie crust recipe after I read the reviews. Thanks for another fabulous dessert!

Would not say it is beyond compare. I have used dried cranberries with equally pleasant results.

Very easy to make, especially if you use a frozen pie crust. The cherries add a nice tartness to a very sweet dessert.

It was a big hit at my dinner party last night. I will be making it again!

This was a really good pie. We love "pecan" style pies so I knew this would be a hit. I didn't have cherries so I used quartered apricots boiled in Madiera. It was delicious, but next time I will use the cherries. I think they would add a nice tartness.

This is very good--and different from other pies I've made. The only reason I didn't give it 4 forks is because I didn't love the crust, which was thick and heavy and could've been store bought. I'll make this again, but with my usual, flaky crust.

definitely a unique pie - i like the idea of spreading a thin layer of chocolate chips over the crust prior to adding the filling - i'll have to try that. i didn't have dried cherries on hand so i used cherry flavored craisins, which turned out just as delish. the pie even tastes great the next few days after it's baked, if it even lingers around that long. if you like the flavor and consistency of pecan pie filling, definitely give this a whirl.

This pie was very good. Not quite what I was expecting though. It was sweet but not overly sweet. I loved tha thte dried cheeries plumped up and seemed like fresh cheeries. Everyone I served it to throughly enjoyed it.

This is a fabulous dessert. I also added a layer of chocolate chips before pouring the filling into the crust. Definitely a winner.
