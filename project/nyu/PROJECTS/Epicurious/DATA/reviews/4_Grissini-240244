This recipe calls for too much water but it is still a good recipe. I am forgiving, I suppose, because I have worked in restaurant kitchens that submitted recipes to magazines and somehow amounts changed. It happens. When I found this recipe I was on the quest for a grissini recipe (I had never made them before) with semolina. I have many years of bread making experience so I was undaunted by the review that indicated that the dough was too wet. I added an extra 1/4 cup of semolina flour, an extra 1/2 cup of OO flour (you can use all purpose) and 1/2 cup of rice flour. Alternately, just start with 1 cup of water and you should be fine. I would however use less salt because 2 tsp would retard the yeast in such a small recipe - that is a lot of salt for this amount of dough. Sprinkle a bit of salt on the outside before they go in the oven. I sprayed them with a water bottle and sprinkled various seeds and sea salt on top. So, all in all, I give the recipe a high rating for personal reasons. With more flour, it worked fine for me and the bread sticks were delicious. It was the recipe that got me making grissini and now I have a great recipe. So add less water and salt. Trust me - they will be delicious!

This dough is much too sticky -- it's impossible to roll out the grissini.
