Really good! Used Flying Pigs fresh ham steak and tangerine juice. My new cast iron pan provided a superior sear. The meat was not in the slightest bit dry. I like the idea of a little honey...will try next time. So easy, too!

This is one of my favorite recipes. Quick and very delicious. The only modification I make is to add a squirt of honey to the sauce while it is reducing. I find it helps balance the acidity.

I made this tonight, following the recipe exactly, and it's definitely going in the file. My "cutlets" were boneless pork chops and three minutes a side cooked them perfectly. I thought the sauce was a delicious meld of the three flavors, neither too garlicky nor too "Southwest Flavors" cumin-y, and not all that heavy on citrus either. My daughter, who literally gags at the smell of oranges,was even willing to try a little sauce (although she ate the rest of her chop plain) and the rest of us loved it.

This was delicious! My only complaint was that the pork got a little overdone, but the sauce was amazing! Simple to make yet with incredible flavor! I served it with Cuban-style black beans from Trader Joe's, quinoa, and sweet, pan-fried plantains for dessert. I would definitely recommend this dish to anyone who wants a quick, tasty meal with minimal work.

Quick to make but not sure if i will make it again. The cumin gives it a spanish twist but wouldn't call it an authentic meal even with the rice and beans.

Quite good. I substituted chicken instead of pork and it worked well.

Triple yum. And so (relatively) effortless.

This is a super fast recipe with an intriguing flavor. It's going into our regular rotation

Would NOT make again. Although this was not a terrible recipe, the cumin completely overpowered the pork. My wife and I love cumin, but save your cumin for fajitas, carnitas and such. And save your pork for pork with capers (on this site) I made the recipe precisely as written and would never make again.

This is so light, delicious, and best of all, EASY! If you're not a huge cumin fan you can use less, substitute another space, or leave it out completely, I suppose.

This is a quick and easy recipe, and forms a good base to start from. Find your own way to personalise it... I doubled the cumin content for more flavour to the pork coating. I also added the flour and cumin powder to the frying pan residues (along with minced garlic) to form a dry roux. Add the citrus juices, stir as it bubbles, and let it reduce to a thick gravy consistency. Add a couple of tablespoons of honey (or sugar) to balance out the acidity of the citrus juices. And just before you take if off the heat, add some freshly minced cilantro or mint leaves, and spoon on top of the pork cutlets at the table, with freshly ground pepper and salt to taste. Its a quick and easy modification to the original recipe

Good dish for a weeknight. I used cuminseeds in place of ground cumin because I love cumin, and it came out fine. I agree that lemon juice should be slightly reduce, otherwise the taste is a bit acid, even with freshly sueezed orange juice.

A really very boring pork dinner. I added tabasco as one reviewer said, but I didn't really "spice up" the dinner.

Rating: 3
Very good and easy. Two hints from other reviewers were useful. (1) Salt and pepper the cutlets first before dusting with flour-cumin, and (2) I decreased the lemon juice by one tablespoon. My "cutlets" were 1-inch slices of pork tenderloin flattened to about 1/2-inch. The two (rather large) cloves of garlic were not too much for us at all. If you don't have fresh orange juice, juice made from frozen concentrate works fine in this recipe. And if no fresh oranges are available for the garnish, a sprinkling of fresh chopped cilantro is pretty and tastes good.

I also found the sauce a touch off-tasting: bitter and lackluster. I couldn't taste the cumin very much either, and found the recipe overall pretty boring.

Thanks for all the helpful advice! Salt & peppered 1st, doubled the recipe for the sauce. My family was a bit dubious at first, they're used to tomato based sauce with pork. However, after a few bites, they were sold! I found it quite refreshing and light.

I thought this came out kind of bland. However, I think the orange juice I used was pretty flat. Next time I would use sweeter orange juice and probably a little more cumin. I would also add maybe 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper to give a little more zing.

I hate to be the fly in the ointment here, but I just didn't think this was anything to write home about. I could not taste the cumin and I thought the sauce had an off, slightly bitter flavor. Would not make again.

This is really good with a teaspoon of tabasco sauce added if you like things spicy! I served it with steamed broccoli and white cheddar mashed potatoes. Have made it several times.

Very easy and tasty. I would double the ingredients for the sauce so there is more to enjoy.

this was good--as everyone else said, the cumin was just right. I will leave out the garlic the next time, I thought the flavour didn't really compliment the citrus.

Very Good, I thought the Cumin would be too strong, but the blend with the citrus was perfect. I stuck to the recipe and it was good. I served it w/ red beans and rice, went together really well.

Surprisingly good. Out of lemons, but substituted more fresh o.j.,and didn't miss it. Was afraid the cumin might be overpowering to my one guest who wasn't familiar with that taste, but the cumin simply enhanced the pork, making the flavor more complex.

This was a great success at my house.I've made it twice and past my 12 year old daughter test.She even had seconds both times!

The citrus sauce was a little tart. Went very well with the pork though. Would put less lemom juice next time.

Very good! The pan sauce adds just the right zing. Definitely a keeper.

Simple and Delicious. I added 1 teaspoon of curry. Served with brown rice and peas. Will definately make again.

Nice and tasty. Salt and pepper the cutlets before flouring, add a bit more cumin. Served it with baked sweet potatoes and refried black beans. 3.2 Forks.

Very simple receipe to make - with good flavor to boot! I used pork chops instead of cutlets, but it turned out very good anyway....

This one's a winner. Easy weeknite supper or great for impromptu get togethers with friends. I serve this with a side dish of Goya black bean soup poured over white rice. People will think you spent all day cooking.

This is a nice summer dish. The cumin flavor is subtle but definitely there. The citrus sauce is a nice contrast to the cumin. I needed to add a small amount of oil before each batch of pork, but otherwise, the recipe worked well. As accompaniment, I served brussels sprouts and steamed new potatoes garnished with parsley. The meal was higlighted with a good white wine-simple but elegant.
