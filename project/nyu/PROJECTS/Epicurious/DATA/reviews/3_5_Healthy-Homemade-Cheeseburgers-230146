we really loved the taste of the burger. wish I had read the egg and bread crumbs suggestion... can you grill these? why all of the water in the pan when you cook them?

Fab flavour, quick and easy. Added a small egg and 1T breadcrumbs to hold them together better. You'll never eat a fast-food burger again!

Quick, easy, tasty and healthy. What more could you want? I didn't notice the extra flavors after adding lettuce, tomato and zesty pickles. Tasted like a good 'ol cheeseburger to me!

this is a great fast recipe that has a different flavor. Better than a plain burger!

OK, let's cut out all this nonsense. I'm serious. Back to your desks, NOW!
