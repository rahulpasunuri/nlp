Quite good, even made in an indoor grill pan. I added some red and orange peppers to the onions, which complemented the dish nicely. Adding a half teaspoon or so of coriander to the compound butter also helped brighten the flavor of the fish. A nice summer dish.

I thought this recipe was just okay..... kinda bland, and I didn't get the red onion thing. It didn't seem like the flavors complimented each other very well. If you want swordfish, there are far better recipes out there. There is a amazing chipotle red snapper recipe here that is definately worth look.

A quick, easy meal. I did not have corriander leaves so I substituted a blend of seasonings of cumin, corriander, curry, salt, pepper and an "foreign spice" given to me by a Georgian friend in Istanbul. You can alter this any way you like, but I think the freshly ground Cumin/Corriander seed base works well with the lime. As it was raining, I used a grill pan. This was one of the best versions of swordfish I have ever had. My wife is planning a swordfish dinner for friends. Cous cous and some Shanghai Bok Choy keep this simple and allow the flavor of the lime butter to really stand out. A wonderful meal in 40 minutes.

Swordfish is bad for women of childbearing age. Environmental Defense recommends to not consume it at all. I found this out after trying this recipe, which is excellent. We doubled the recipe for 4 people, & added yellow squash, zuccini and red peppers to the red onion. Roasted all veggies on skewers on the grill with the fish. Definitely would make it again, but substituting a different type of fish.

This recipe was quick, easy, and delicious. I sprinkle the fish with kosher salt for more flavor. The grilled onions were a perfect compliment. Excellent flavors, I would definitely make this dish again.

This swordfish recipe is excellent. My husband, who is not fond of swordfish, raved about it. I will definitely prepare this again.

We had this recipe for our Fathers Day dinner. We enjoyed it. It was perfect.

This was quite delicious. We used meyers lemon instead of the lime. The cooking time on the swordfish was almost a little long, with a hot fire, but then again, we like it pink in the middle.

Was yummy! Can't say "beyond compare" but enjoyed it, my boyfriend's 11 year old daughter who "hates lime" had 3 helpings! grilled onions were a nice touch & easy prep is good for other veggies too!

The coriander lime butter was absolutely delicious and easy, it added so much flavor to the fish. We loved the red onions and will use this preparation on other grilled vegetables.

I've used the ingredients for the coriander lime butter as the basis for a marinade instead of as a sauce as written. My only change is to use extra virgin olive oil in lieu of the butter, and to increase the amount of coriander (cilantro). The resulting marinade works magic with swordfish, rendering it succulent and flavorful throughout. Marinate for only 15 minutes, or up to an hour, but no longer, as the lime will start breaking down the texture of the fish. Since we grill fish 4-5 times a week, I've been preparing this at least once a week since June - it' s that good.

Nice easy weeknight recipe. We loved the butter w/ cilantro! We grilled asparagus @ same time as red onion, worked out well!

Excellent flavor combination. I loved the buttery lime with cilantro. The onions were spicy and just right with the sauce and fish. Very tasty.

This is a bit of a showstopper. Comes highly recommended, especially during the grilling season.

My wife liked it better than I did. The onions were a big hit, definitely recommend them, but the butter was good without being great. It's a solid recipe, and relatively easy, but I think there are better swordfish accompaniments in the Epicurious vault (try the Fresh Tomato-Herb Salsa).

This recipe is surely a keeper. The onions just added the perfect topping to a dish that is already over the top. I served w/ boiled baby new potatoes and fresh asaparagus. My husband wanted to know who was coming to dinner.Absolutely fabulous!

This recipe was a hit! It was very easy and took only a few minutes to prepare. I used cod instead of swordfish, and grilled the fish and onions using my George Foreman Grill. Next time, I think I will use a little less cumin on the onions. Following the advice of others, I put some of the cilantro lime butter on the fish before placing it on the grill. I also marinated the fish with a little lime juice and lemmon pepper. I served it with a salad with pineapple cilantro dressing and some lightly grilled french bread, topped with olive oil and herbs.

I have been making this once a week since I found the recipe-- so easy and so tasty, I think I am addicted...

Very good, very easy, and much can be prepared ahead. I do have to laugh when I see all the substitutions people put in their reviews that make them unidentifiable to the original recipe (basil? like that's close? and with lime???) but this was great just as is. I've also tried it with halibut (LOL--I know, it's not AS the recipe reads, but at least it's still a firm white fish!!!) and it's just great.

A great fish dish and the grilled onions compliment this fish dish. I used basil instead of coriander and it was delicious.

This is great recipe! Thank God for the Grill, huh? I used Mahi Mahi and because my spouse hates cilantro, I substituted fresh italian parsley and it was wonderful. 30 minutes start to finish! Will definitely make it again. (Go light on the cayenne...)

Wonderful....this was by far the best swordfish I have ever had. Will definitley make this one again!

This butter is terrific on sauteed scallops. The onions were good (but I may have overdone it on the cayenne).

Like another reviewer, my boyfriend likes swordfish and I usually don't. I really enjoyed this recipe and it's very simple but nice enough for guests. We made it again with Talapia, but it does not complement as good as swordfish. I would like to try it with scallops as someone else suggested.

Great simple recipe good for all white fish, shellfish too (love the butter mixture on grilled scallops). For those that don't know, fresh coriander IS cilantro.

This is a great recipe if, like me, you don't love swordfish but your spouse does. The coriander butter is a delicious accompaniment which takes away the strong taste of the fish. Please don't omit the onions as they are excellent. I laid them and the fish on my non-stick grill topper and cooked them together. Start to finish the recipe only took me 30 mins. to make.

Fast, easy, and tastes great. Definitely recommend and will be making again. I don't know if I'd bother with the red onions though... they took a lot more time than the recipe claims, and tasted average.

I made this with Halibut, also I couldnt get fresh coriander, and used cilantro instead. Still it was quite good with 2 substitutions. I'll make it again. The onions make this dish - they rate a 4+. I'll definitly make them next time I grill.

This recipie was excellent! I let the butter/lime sauce cool to a paste before rubbing onto the fish, then when cooking it melted into the steak nicely. The onions were amazing. My guests were awed by my mastery of the fish. Simple, fast and easy, I reccomend!!

Wonderful recipe. Used the cumin mixture for asparagus, shitake and crimini mushrooms, in addition to the onions. Grilled them all. Also followed about advice and put butter mixture on for grilling swordfish and some at serving. Great on veges also!

Tasty! I made a little extra sauce to drizzle on some vegetables too -- I used fresh cilantro and I think it's a must for it to really be great. Be sure to grill onions well; they didn't turn out great for me because I didn't cook them long enough.

This is really a great quick dinner. I would recommend grilling more than 4 onion slices if you have the grill space because,once you taste them, you'll wish you had. I also topped the fish at the table with fresh guacamole. I had dinner on the table in less than 1/2 an hour.

My fiance and I made this and loved it! It was fairly easy, but the preparation took a little more time than we anticipated. The onions are a wonderful accompaniment!

Quick yes...but I did not have time to do the onions...and while this really made the swordfish good, I think I would like it better with a milder fish like mahi-mahi. I followed David's instructions and used the butter on the fish while it was grilling...actually I did this in a grilling pan on top of the stove. My husband ate it but I could tell, he was not too fond of the swordfish...he likes a milder fish. Will definitely make the sauce again.

Yummy! This was a very savory, easy-to-make dish. I used 1 tsp. dried coriander instead of the fresh version, and I baked the fish instead of grilled. The fish was tender and aromatic. I would definitely make this again.

We really enjoyed this recipe! The quality of the swordfish steak really determines how good the entree will be. We found that by using the butter on the steaks while grilling, flavor is more subtle...a matter of taste I suppose.
