my daughter in law made this last week and it was wonderful. The sauce was thick perhaps because she did everything the day before and then heated the sauce at the last minute.

Having all of the ingredients on hand, including the chili de arbol, I set to work assembling this recipe. The semifreddo is tasty, nothing spectacular but good. The chile-chocolate sauce was steeped for more than the suggested 15 minutes due to an interruption. It did not suffer. The flavors of the sauce are lovely but the color was lighter in color than the photograph. Even with the over night refrigeration the sauce remained on the thin side and would be more like a soup when placed on a plate. Still, the flavor was so delicious that I can see it utilized in other ways. I did split the de arbol length wise though this was not indicated in the recipe.
