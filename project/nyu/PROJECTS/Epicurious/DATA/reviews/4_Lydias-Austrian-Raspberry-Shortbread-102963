I make this every Christmas for the past six years. My family and friends love it! I've made it with raspberry, apricot, chocolate with orange marmalade and this year I'm making chocolate raspberry. I bake the first layer for about 8 minutes and then warm up the jam in the microwave and spread it over, then add the second layer and bake. I cut these in to 2"x2" squares as they are very rich. Don't skip grating the dough and definitely do not press down the first layer. This recipe has become a Christmas tradition in my family.

I have been making this dessert for years and it's the one my sons ask me to make most often. I used to have them grate the dough on a box grater (a real knuckle buster) but now use my food processor with the same great results in much less time. Also, if you stir up the room temperature jam, it becomes liquid and spreads easily.These are fantastic and disappear fast - good thing because I found that they don't freeze well.

Ive been making this recipe for years and am always asked to bring it to any party or gathering. Everyone LOVES it! It is my go-to dessert. It does take some planning since the dough must be made ahead of time. Also, Ive switched out the raspberry jam for lemon curd with the same fantastic results. Note: spreading the jam is definitely easier when the jam is at room temperature.

Just put this in the oven. I've made it at least a half dozen times over the last few years and always receive great raves! I make the dough ahead and leave in freezer until needed. This time I found the simple answer to grating. I flattened the dough into 6 inch discs, placed each into a separate zip lock bag and sliced while in the bag into five slices, zipped them up and froze them. The slices, about 1 1/2 wide, fit into an old Presto Salad Shooter to grate. When you want to bake, just pull dough from freezer, grate, spread jam and bake. It took less than 5 minutes to assemble and throw in the oven. I used to struggle w/ a frozen ball of dough, risking the loss of fingers trying to break apart w/ a chef's knife....not anymore!

Okay, it's a lot of work, but two suggestions (noted in part by other reviewers) help: one, use a food processor to grate the dough. Two, let the very-hard-frozen dough sit out for a half hour before grating. This is the singlar hardest (no pun intended) part of this recipe. I also used frozen raspberries, brought to room temperature, sprinkling with a couple of tablespoons of raw sugar instead of the jam (cooked it to dissolve the sugar and create spreadable fruit). Make sure you fully cool before slicing. This is an absolutely wonderful recipe.

For me, this recipe requires too much time and effort in proportion to the quality of the results. Traditional shortbread is one of the great cookies, in my opinion, so spending half an hour grating dough in order to achieve a lighter- textured cookie is simply not worth the time (or work). Because the dough is shredded, it is difficult to spread the jam over it, resulting in the need to add more jam in order to completely cover the dough base. Yhe final result is much too sweet. It's an interesting idea, but not one I'm going to use in the future.

I have made this a few times now. It makes for a beautifully lighter texture. I do grate by hand since I think the powder I get from my processor is too fine. Don't be tempted to press the first layer! You'll lose the fluffiness. I thought the raspberry jam was too sweet and strong, so I tried it with Apple Pie Jam (a finer chopped apple pie filling) which was FANTASTIC!!! Just that touch of cinnamon really gives a lot to this recipe.

I love this recipe but tweaked a bit myself. I use a larger bar pan because it is so rich and you don't lose anything in making the pieces thinner. I used an insulated pan and so 30 minutes of bake time still worked. I cut smaller pieces. I drizzled a lemon icing over the top and the lacing effect made it prettier as well as not as sweet as the powdered sugar. I added fresh lemon juice to the jam to cut the sweetness a bit. I am going to try lemon curd for a filling the next time as I think it will really compliment the sweet shortbread.

I made this recently for a baby shower and received rave reviews. Instead of making bars, I baked it as a tart in a 9" springform pan and it came out beautifully. I highly recommend it - it's a wonderful treat!

I made these for the second year in a row for Christmas gifts, using the chocolate variation this time. I get rave reviews on these. Definitely worth the effort!

My office mates raved about these. They were fabulous. Really, really rich, though. I didn't read all the reviews before I made the recipe, so I used all the butter called for, and it was actually just fine. I also put the dough in the freezer for about 2 hours, and didn't really have any problems grating. I'll try others' suggestion next time, but rest assured, the recipe is quite fabulous just the way it is.

I have made this a number of times, using the regular recipe and the cocoa version as well. I have also mixed them up,using the cocoa dough for the base then adding the jam with some shredded sweetened coconut and topping that with the white dough. Any way you make this, it will be a huge hit.

Raves from my work Coffee Hour Crew!! Follwing other recommendations, I used 3.5 sticks of butter which was more than enough. I also used 12 oz. of black raspberry jam which was more than plently...maybe even a little too much. I used a food processor...good time and arm saver. I pressed in the first layer, topped with jam, and lightly pressed in the second layer. Let dough sit for about 20 min so the pieces could defrost. Baking for 40 minutes was perfect. Next time trying with homemade strawberry jam!!

Yummy!! Used 1 1/2 cups of sugar, grated with a food processor and used 16 oz. of jam. I microwave the jam and strain the seeds. That might help with defrosting the dough a little. I also press the bottom layer and not the top. Because it's such a rich and tender cookie I refridgerate the whole pan before cutting. It makes it a lot easier to cut. These are very similar to the cookies at Bittersweet in Chicago.

this is the best thing ever. everybody raved about it. reccomend adding a bit more than a cup of jam. definitely a keeper.

I wish I'd read ALL the reviews before making this recipe. Right now I agree with most tips: set the dish aside before baking for a little while if using frozen dough & use a food processor; cook longer than the recommended 30-40 minutes or the center will be too soft; reduce the butter - it literally swims in liquid fat on the way to the cool down phase. Otherwise delicious.

This is one of my favorite shortbread recipes. I was so curious about the technique of grating the shortbread dough after freezing and it really does create a very light texture. I used a 13oz. jar of raspberry preserves and thought it was just the right amount-any less might not be enough. I have to confess that as soon as they came out of the oven I had to try them - unbelievable when hot! The next time I'm going to try substituting cocoa and maybe use an apricot filling. It will definitely stay in my "cookie hit list"!

Per suggestions I refrigerated the dough, pressed down the top, used seedless jam and let sit before baking. I was VERY happy to have my food processor do the grating. It came out great. I found it to be too rich for myself but every other person who had some went nuts over it. I will definitely make again. Might throw in a thin layer of dark chocolate next time or add the cocoa to the dough for a twist.

Awesome!!! It does need to bake a bit longer to get it golden brown. Grating the dough gives it a great texture! My friends and family could not get enough. Use seedless raspberry jam. You can also substitute apricot or another favorite.

I made this shortbread several times as my family keeps requesting it for our gatherings. It is amazingly delicious and seems to remind my relatives of me grandmother's cakes (we come from Central Europe). I usually make the dough a day ahead and keep it in the fridge instead of the freezer. It is easier to grate. I have experimented with the filling and used apricot preserves. It was equally delicious. Thank you Lydia!

MMMMMMMM! I had been searching for a recipe like this...it's scrumptious! I agree with some of the suggestions noted - 3 1/2 sticks of butter, refrigerate not freeze, and press down the top crust. One other note - this doesn't transfer from pan to storage tin to plate very well - leave in the pan until you're ready to serve/display on platter. A great find!

Thanks to the other reviewers I let it sit out a bit after grating it in the food processor, and it did take longer to bake, so go by the color, not the time. I thought the amount of filling was good, would not use less. Has anybody tried these with Nutella in the middle? I'm thinking that would be delish! They also keep very well for a few days.

Wow! This is a stupendous dessert. I used seedless, sugarless black raspberry jam (12.5 oz rather than 8) and it was perfect. Very easy to make. I think I'll cut back on the butter next time, maybe 3.5 sticks as it is sort of greasy. It also took more like an hour for me to back, but I have an electric oven...Go for it. It's an excellent recipe for the nervous/beginning cook.

This was wonderful. Made them as a Valentine's treat for friends and they gobbled them up and asked for more. There's some arm work involved but the results are worth it. I was looking for a recipe that came close to the raspberry bars they sell at *that coffee shop* on every corner in the US of A and these ended up being better.

I loved this cookie and so did our company. It went with a frozen amaretto souffle and it was was a nice combination. I made it according to recipe and it turned out just fine though I didn't quite use all the dough. I was grating by hand and had a baseball sized chunk left that I couln't grate without scraping nuckles. I think that might be the key to the problems with a soft center.

Thanks to the other reviewers, I tweaked this somewhat: put my dough in the fridge, not the freezer; hand grated w/o a problem. Since I made my own jam, I just reheated it a little for easier spreading. I turned my oven down to 325 and baked them for an hour...they did get a little dark on the bottom, but certainly weren't underdone. They were a bit crumbly/messy--if I make them again, I'll try pressing the top crust a little bit. It's a fast, easy recipe.

Cooking time even in convection was too short. Needs about 10-20 minutes more. Very easy to make and quite delicious.

I made the chocolate version of this recipe and also cut it in half. I baked the bars in a 8x11 pan. They were a nice thickness, probably an inch or so. I also used a food processor to grate the dough and let it defrost for a few minutes before adding the second layer and baking. They are crumbly, but very good. Just enought raspberry flavoring.

Like one of the other reviewers I found this recipe not quite cooked in the center when it was well browned on the top. I also had difficulty spreading the jam on the frozen flakey dough (used food processor grating method). After assembled, I tried letting it set 15 minutes before putting it in the oven. Overall taste is great, but it just does not cook according to the recipe. Any suggestions would be welcome.

I have the book and I have made this recipe.It works out great but my advice is to cut a little bit on the sugar as it is too much,at least for me. For the rest it´s great (also the book)

My goodness was this recipe rich! Almost too rich. Overall not a bad recipe though. If I make them again, I will either use a larger pan or bake them longer, as all the cookies not touching the edge of the pan were a light golden brown on top but soft and underdone in the middle. This made the richness of the cookies even worse and I had to throw some of them away.

Made this shortbread last night and it was wonderful!!!!! I made the chocolate version and also used the food processor which made it much easier. I used a little more raspberry jam and cooked it a little longer than called for. Very definitely worth the effort. Also cut them smaller as they are very rich.

Wonderful shortbread. Use a food processor for quick assembly.

In my opinion, this recipe is flawed, but fixable (and worth fixing) The first time I made it, I used a food processor to grate the dough - and it did so very quickly, so that the dough was in the form of frozen flakes when I put it into the 9 x 13 pan. As a result, after 40 minutes, the dough in the middle of the pan was not as completely cooked as I would have liked, even tho the top browned well. I also felt that 1 cup of raspberry jam was too assertive, and overpowered the buttery flavor of the shortbread. The second time, I used a manual grater (which was tough on knuckles and arms, but worked well. The dough was more defrosted, and cooked up better. I also cut the raspberry jam down to 1/2 cup - and I prefer the result. In the future, I may go back to the food processor dough grating technique, but I will now know to leave the dough in the pan at room temp. for about 15 mins. after grating to allow it to defrost somewhat before I bake it.

These cookies are just delicious! My teenagers beg for me to make them. Everyone I have served them to wants the recipe. We have decided we like a bit more jam in the center, and other flavors besides raspberry are equally yummy. Also, I cut them smaller-they are so rich! These cookies freeze well, just sprinkle on the powdered sugar after thawing and just before serving.
