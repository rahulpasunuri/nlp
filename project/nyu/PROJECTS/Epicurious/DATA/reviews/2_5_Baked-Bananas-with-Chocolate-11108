Maybe I did something wrong, but this came out very bitter. Had to put sugar on top to make it edible.

How can chocolate, bananas and cream taste badly? They can't. It tastes quite good, but is a mess to look at. Certainly not a dish for company, but when you want something sweet, it hits the spot. Top with whipped cream to enjoy the hot/cold combination.

This was a quick and simple dessert. I wasn't sure about cooked bananas, but it was very good. I did stir everything for a second when it came out of the oven to combine the cream and chocolate into a sauce.

i was very excited about this dish, but after preparing and eating it i was a little disappointed. my chocolate and cream didn't mix so well, so after baking i stirred the entire mixture and made a rich chocolate sauce. i might try baking the bananas in condensed milk for a thicker texture and sweeter taste.

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe. I didn't care for the warm bananas in warm cream. My husband took one bite and pushed it away saying, "Yuck!" This made me very sorry because I had doubled the recipe and used a Scharfen-Berger chocolate bar for the chocolate. He concluded that I should have saved the bananas for banana pudding and I concluded I should have saved the "good" chocolate for molten chocolate cakes (w/ cherry sauce, found on this website).

The combination of bananas, cream and chocolate is unbeatable. Its hard to believe that so few ingredients could produce something so luscious, but they do. A fantastic dessert that takes literally 3-4 minutes to prepare--great for last mintue company. This one is a keeper.

This dish is to DIE for! It was just the right amount of sweetness. I made it for 4 people including myself, and we all enjoyed it.
