Loved this recipe - very easy. I removed the cumin only because of others comment and my husband is not a fan - but worked out great otherwise.

Have made this several times. Very easy and foolproof with wonderful results. I could only find Hungarian paprika, but the dish was still delicious and a different spin on roast beef!

Great for a dinner party - we loved this recipe. Not too spicey - just right! Would definitely make it again.

No leftovers on this recipe! Had company over on Sunday and they devoured it. The gravy is particulary tasty without any noticeable heat. I used a traditional butter/flour roux rather than the cornstarch route to gravy making. Otherwise perfect as-is. Paired well with roasted rosemary potatoes and a julienned veggie combo(carrot, zucchini, bell pepper) in a garlic/evoo sauce.

YUM. Made this and used it on a tri tip and it was delish. Will do again for sure. Used paprika I already had, which I don't think is the Spanish variety, and it was still yummy!

Excellent dish that is very easy to prepare. I have made this on 6 or 7 occasions to rave reviews.

I couldn't find spanish paprika anywhere, so I used sweet Hungarian paprika, and it turned out great. The gravy is a nice addition. I cooked it to 140 degrees, to get it to medium-rare. This recipe is great if you have more time-consuming sides/desserts to make for the same meal.
