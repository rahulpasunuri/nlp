Love, love this cookie. Delicious and rich in chocolate flavor I refrigerated batter for 10 minutes before baking helped cookies hold shape and easier to scoop.

Exceptional cookies - very sophisticated flavour. Don't be put off by the runny dough - they bake up fine. I used white chocolate chips for a little variety, and substituted ordinary instant coffee because I didn't have espresso powder, & they were amazing.

This was a huge hit when I made it for guests. As for the "non sitck" pan, I use aluminium foil and spray it generously with Pam......... Really chocolately..........

...So, I set out to make these at about 1:45 this morning (I work nights), and discovered I had neither a nonstick cookie sheet OR parchment paper. I was almost deterred from making these, based on the other reviews comments about their tendency to stick, but I couldn't resist and made them anyway. Instead of the nonstick pan or the parchment paper, I greased and floured the stainless steel cookie sheet much like one would do with a cake pan... A little gentle sawing with a metal offset spatula and some help in lifting from a traditional spatula, and they came off the sheet just fine. (the larger spatula was just to help them stay together during the transfer to the cooling rack). Also, I was lazy and cheap, and not wanting to make a special trip to a different store for the instant espresso powder, I opted to give 'ol Nescafe instant coffee singles a try...I used three little tube packets, and the coffee flavor comes through great!!! And for 99 cents versus $5 + for the espresso powder, I think its a hit. I also added about a teaspoon of cinnamon, which makes it reminiscent of Mexican cocoa.

I followed the recipe exactly using butter, Ghiradelli 60 % bittersweet chocolate, Medaglia D'Oro instant espresso powder , is very hard to find- my local supermarkets did not carry this and I found it in a spice shop(5.18 for a 2 oz. Jar). I have tried the parchment paper- not necessary they hold together quite nicely ( did eliminate the chips ). I timed them under and over the exact time- my oven is precise- also tried the last five minutes on convection- not necessary- they may seem underbaked, but they do firm up to be a nice brownie cookie. Important to remember that chocolate cookies will burn easily, so a slower cooler baking works better. As for taste- as good as a good brownie!

these cookies are AWESOME! i don't like nuts much so i didn't use them. after trying these once, i decided to add 2 tsp. peppermint extract and got rave reviews. "better than girl scout thin mint cookies." i refrigerate the dough as well to decrease spreading. no doubt, these are heavenly, chocolatey delights!

I have been making these for about 4 years now and I ALWAYS get requests for more or the recipe! I have altered a few things over the years...first I use 1/2cup of flour and 1/2teaspoon of baking powder. I also use white chocolate chips in the batter to provide a nice contrast to the chocolate cookie. I have never tried nuts in them. Also I freeze the batter for an hour or two before baking and then scoop with a small scoop and bake for about 10 min. I use a silpat to keep them from sticking, but they break if you take them off before they are cool. I wish I could get these to puff up and look prettier as they are very thin. OHHH but are they delicious!!!

These are really, really good. The dough is more like batter, after you get it all mixed together let it sit for 15 minutes or so. Either in the fridge or on the counter. Bake on parchment. Let sit out of the oven for a few minutes and remove with a metal spatula.

Perfect! Very easy to make, and delicious. Will def. make again.

I've had this type of cookie from several gourmet bakeries and loved them. I left out the extra chocolate chips and the walnuts and dusted the tops with confectioner's sugar to duplicate the ones I had from the bakeries. They were perfect for Valentine's Day office gifts.

These cookies are addictive, with its rich chocolate taste and chewy texture. I made these to give away for Christmas presents, and everyone who tasted these cookies fell in love with them.

I just made these and completely followed the recipe. Really delicious, with a soft gooey center. I baked them for 12 minutes. I used the mini ice cream/cookie dough scoop which worked well even with the first tray where the batter was runnier. The batter did firm up the longer it sat and the cookies from the different consistencies of batter look the same. I got 48 cookies which were just the right size and no problem getting them off the parchment paper.

these take a little practice, but i think they're promising. i ran out of vanilla, so i substituted a combination of kahlua and godiva liquers, which turned out well. in the future, would chop the walnuts finely - i thought the course chop made them too inconsistent with the texture of the rest of the cookie. i also found that they were done after about 8 minutes rather than 12, but i don't think my oven is well calibrated (it's an old apartment). at 12 minutes they were too dry and cakey, but after 8, they were great!

excellent cookies. could not find espresso powder so i pounded some espresso beans with a hammer inside a plastic ziploc. put two cookies on a dessert plate with a couple scoops of nice vanilla ice cream dust the plate up with some confectioners sugar and cocoa powder and you have yourself an elegant ending for your dinner party. definitely use parchment paper.

i love these cookies, but i can't seem to prevent them from falling apart when i take them off the cookie sheet. will parchment paper help? but will they still crumble when you take them off?

These cookies are delicious. My husband, who hates coffee, loved them. I chilled the dough, as others suggested and it worked out fine. This is a keeper.

Everyone about fell over themselves eating these cookies. I admit I was skeptical when I first mixed up the batter because it appeared so runny. Did not chill the batter as others suggested. The batter seemed to firm up on its own as it sat between batches. I used parchment paper and let the baking sheet cool between batches and the cookies baked up beautifully. Used instant coffee instead of expresso powder, consequently it didn't have that "punch" of coffee flavor. Will definitely make again!

These cookies are great - very popular at the office! I used my trusty 1 tblsp. ice cream scooper and set them on parchment paper. They were pretty gooey, but only spread slightly, and they did have that wonderful cracked brownie texture on top when they finished baking. YUM!

I have made these cookies every year for the past three year -- everyone loves them. But being a chocolate fanatic, I wish they were a little more gooey and had more of a brownie consistency.

Excellent cookies. For high-altitude, I added an additional 1/2 Tablespoon flour. I also took the advice of another reviewer and froze the batter slighty before dolloping on cookie sheet, this worked very well. A delicious treat!

I disagree with the cook from Chicago, IL. These cookies were delicious and easy to make. Just reading the recipe itself was less complicated then the other espresso/choclate cookies recipe.

This recipe is simply thee best! Great for chocoholics like myself! It's not complicated, and everyone just loves the results. I guarantee, the cookies will not last very long.

I put the "dough" (more like batter) into the freezer for a few minutes before I made small, teaspoon sized heaps to bake. This made the handling much easier and I liked the smaller size because they are so rich. They are wonderful!

Don't make this recipe! Make the Gourmet version of this cookie, it turns out much better. The flavor is great, but otherwise the recipe is a pain.

Oh my god- these have to be my new favorite cookie. I brought them to work and they got inhaled. They definitely need a tall glass of milk beside them. Things I changed- I added 2 1/2 teaspoons each of vanilla and the espresso powder. Also, if you chill the batter about 15 to 20 minutes, they do not spread and are easy to remove from the cookie sheets.

These are the best cookies ever! I have made them so many times I've stopped counting. I have made them w/pecans which is good too. The issue of the cookies spreading seems to occur after the 1st batch - I will try to chill the batter and see if that works. High quality chocolate makes a difference!

Just like little brownies. But I couldn't taste the espresso flavor. Very good none the less.

I wish I could give this recipe 4 forks!! They taste absolutely great but what a mess trying to get them off the cookie sheets. I will say that the aluminum trays I use aren't always the easiest to work with. Now I am keeping my fingers crossed that they will not stick to one another in the tin. I layered them between sheets of waxed paper. I did let the batter rest a little bit as others suggested. I used a cookie scoop (like the ice cream type but smaller) and it worked great to drop the batter onto the sheets. The cookies did spread out and become flat. Part of the problem is that there is not enough cookie to support the chips. Most of the chips have melted on the bottom of the cookie which made it hard to keep them intact. So I don't think its just the cookie sheet that is the issue. I am off to try a similar recipe. The "Chocolate Espresso Cookie" (no hyphen in title) from Gourmet March 1997. Hopefully this one will hold up a little better. They are worth trying to get right!!

These cookies are quite rich and are wonderful with a glass of cold milk. They are really easy to prepare. Even though the recipe instructs to bake the cookies right away, I chilled the dough. I think that helped keep them from spreading too much. I left out the nuts - just my preference. I did not think there was much of a coffee flavor (there is a mocha chip cookie recipe in the Epicurious file that has a better coffee flavor).

I made this recipe for the first time, followed the recipe exactely but when I spooned them on to the tray they were quite runny and spread out quickly. they came out flat and stuck to the sprayed tray. The second batch I made I added two tablespoon of extra flour, they came out better but still stuck to the tray. The flavour is too good to give up the family liked it but I cannot take them to friends because they stick and crumble when I take them out of the tray. Any suggestion from the successful ones?

This is a great recipe. I substitute the semi-sweet chocolate chips with white chocolate ones, and omit the walnuts -- they are very delicious this way.

This is by far, the best cookie recipe I have ever made! They are simply delicious!!! They are definitely an adult cookie though. Children don't seem to like them because of the coffee flavor.

I used Scharfenberger bittersweet chocolate which resulted in a melt in your mouth out of this world chocolate intensity. My co workers loved the cookies as well as my family.

These were very good and much like brownies. Got rave reviews when I took them to work. Presentation was not what I was expecting though. I guess they taste so much like brownies, it's a toss up between making these or brownies. If it's between these and "Chocolate-Walnut Brownies", I'd make the brownies in a heartbeat! Those are *amazing*...the cookies are simply okay, but both satisfy the brownie appeal.

These cookies were out of this world!! They're dense and chewie just like brownies and just as easy to make. I used almonds instead of walnuts and they were fabulous!
