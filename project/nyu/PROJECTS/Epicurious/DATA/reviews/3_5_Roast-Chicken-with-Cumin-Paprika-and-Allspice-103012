Whlie the aromas are far more heavenly than the flavors themselves, this is a very solid roast chicken recipe. HIGHLY recommend you rub the spices under the skin of the bird, otherwise you won't taste them as much. Served with butternut squash rice pilaf - perfect match.

really flavorful chicken. like others I put the spice blend under the skin of the chicken (I also added softened butter and mincer garlic to the blend). I had a 3.5 pound chicken but I used the full amount of spice blend. It took an hour to cook at 425 in the convection oven.

Great take on roasted chicken! I pushed the spices and minced garlic under the skin as suggested by other posters. I will be making this again.

easy and delicious. I used legs and thighs instead of the whole bird. Marinaded overnight. Served with chikpea soup from this site made with less liquid and rice. Middle Eastern feast!

I used this recipe for chicken breasts and marinated the ingredients over night, with the exception of the lemon, saving that until just barbecuing the chicken. Excellent, juicy chicken. Very tasty

changes: 3# bird - all spice rub - put under skin of chicken. Roasted 1+ hour at 500 degrees (feet first - a la "Roasting" cook book). Took giblets from chicken - minus liver that I made a quick "faux fois gras" appetizer - cooked with 1 c. water and 2 thyme sprigs. Rubbed inside of bird with salt, pepper and 1/2 lemon. Stuffed bird with remains of that 1/2 lemon and 2 sprigs thyme. At 1/2 hour, squeezed fresh lemon as directed and added to cavity plus added cooking liguid minus giblets to pan. Cooked until 160 degrees - rested before carving. VERY juicy, very flavorful and a definite keeper.

I made this as written except I added fresh minced garlic to the paste and put some paste under the skin. The chicken was moist, but I would have liked more flavor. Maybe next time I'll mess around with the spice mixture. I added sweet potatoes and squash to the pan @ 1 hr and added zucchini to the mix for the last 15 minutes. Made a nice one pot meal.

The skin was perfect and the chicken was super juicy. I skipped the rack and put the bird directly onto the roasting pan. I also tossed in some new potatoes and quartered onions (first coated with some paprika, garlic powder, salt & pepper, and olive oil).

My first roast chicken; it was not dry but the chin did not get a terrific crust either. The lemon overpowered the spices. I did not have a rack so I placed the chicken over thick cut onion slices. the onions were delicious and great addition to the pan drippings.

Excellent rub for a spiced(non-chili heat) roast chicken recipe. In fact, i am cooking a Turkey this Christmas with this recipe along with brining and a closed roasting pan. I would say that in addition, if you like a crispy skin texture, in the last 10 minute or roasting, turn oven to BROIL. Before broiling, take a bit of butter and rub over surface of chicken skin. Dont forget to take off roasting lid before this procedure

Very nice flavor. I altered it a bit by using only about 1/4 tspn of allspice and adding cayenne pepper for a bit of heat. Otherwise great. I served it over simple steamed artichoke hearts. Oh, and I used fresh garlic and onion.

Fabulous! Never has roast chicken permeated my house with such a wonderful aroma like this recipe did. I added a 1/2 tsp. of cayenne for a little heat (probably will add a whole tsp. next time). As other reviewers suggested, I subbed freshly minced garlic for the garlic powder. Served with roasted golden beets and fluffy garlic-infused couscous.

I agree with the previous reviewers who said it was delicious and moist! I made a few substitutions however. Since I didn't have a lemon, I used 3 T. of bottled lemon juice and placed a quartered apple inside the chicken rather than the lemon. I also used fresh minced garlic (about three medium cloves) instead of the garlic powder. I put quartered red potatoes around the chicken after the first hour and they were perfectly cooked when the chicken was done about 75 minutes later. Since there are only two of us, we have eaten leftovers of it for two nights already and it has been just as juicy and delicious as the first night!

Crazy good! Easy and so moist! Roasted beets and sweet potatoes alongside. Crispy skin with yummy spices. Deelish!

This recipe is a keeper! The chicken was amazing!!! My whole family, including my 2 young kids, who are picky eaters, loved it! I roasted the chicken with the potatoes (and leaks at the very end) in a small roasting pan, so the chicken cooked in all of the juices! Great!

Very disappointing. I love roast chicken and have successfully used all kinds of spice/herb rubs -- but this was awful. And yes, I rubbed it under the skin. I found the taste to be bitter and desperately in need of salt. I ended up stripping the chicken from the bone instead of serving it as is. Will use later in the week for stir fry.

I have been making this dish since it came out in Bon Appetit. My family loves it. I cut back on the Allspice a bit - just as a personal preference.

My favourite roast chicken recipe by far. My boyfriend raves about it each time and it smells heavenly while cooking. I use the drippings to create a gravy to go with mashed potatoes and the gravy is always absolutely delicious - spicy, fragrant, and a perfect compliment to the chicken. And I agree with many other cooks - it's a breeze to prepare!

This was one of the most moist, flavorful recipes I have made- I put some of the spices underneath the skin and also added a little cayenne pepper for some added spice.

This was a wonderful chicken recipe. Made it for guests and it was a hit. I also doubled the spice paste and put it under the skin as well as on top. Marinated the chicken for several hours with the paste. I eliminated the onion powder and used minced fresh garlic instead of powder. I also roasted the chicken for the first thirty minutes at 425 degrees to crisp the skin. This chicken was incredibly moist and very tasty throughout. Great leftovers too.

I've never particularly liked roast chicken, but this recipe changed my mind. The rub is delicious--keeps the chiken very moist and flavorful. It's also great on pork.

This was very good. I'm not a big fan of dishes with a sweet flavor, but this one was good. Next time I will probably adding something to spice it up a bit. Good overall taste.

Excellent chicken! My fiance loved this recipe. The olive oil and lemon juice made the chicken really juicy. I used hot Hungarian paprika to give the dish a little kick. I liked the Allspice....this is one spice I never seem to find a good use for but it was great in the chicken. I also added a little bit a cinnamon to enhance the brown-sweet spice notes.

What everybody else said - *very* easy to make and great eating. Next time, I may try putting some spice paste under the skin of the bird - did I mention how easy it was? A KEEPER.

Darned good skin! tasty and crunchy. Thats the main reason to make this recipe. easy too.

Great recipe! It livens up the traditional roast chicken which can get a little boring after a while. Here's a suggestion I got from other recipes on this site. I took half the spices and inserted under the skin and half over. Then I marinated for 3-4 hours. And please, don't use garlic and onion powder! Grind up the real stuff and get the real taste.

Absolutely delicious. I searched for a recipe for roast chicken with household staples, so that I didn't have to stop on the way home from work to get supplies at the grocery. It was wonderful and I loved the flavor. A couple of friends tried it and enjoyed it as well. A definite keeper! I'm making it again tonight as I type this!!

Delicious and so tender. My husband said he thinks this is the best chicken I have ever made. I had a smaller bird so cooking time was more like 1hr15 then resting time. I served mine with cous cous and salad, Mashed potatoes would be good too.

This is one of my favorite roast chicken recipes . It is so easy to make, and it smells wonderful while it's roasting. I've made it for company several times, and it always receives rave reviews. I made a couple of minor changes to the recipe; I add minced fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder and omit the onion powder. This has become a Sunday night staple!

No modifcations, simple and moist. Wondering if I can turn up the heat to cook faster, similar technique to the Two Hour Turkey recipe?

Very tasty, not as spicy as I'd assumed. Watch for burning during the last half hour of cooking. Skin was crisp & flavourful.

A real hit! Incredibly easy, yet totally moist and delicious. I doubled the recipe for the spice mixture and rubbed it under the skin as well as on top. I also used chermoula (middle eastern spice mix) instead of paprika, but I doubt it makes a huge difference.

At 11:00am Sunday morning I was looking for a new recipe for roast chicken. This used pantry staples and looked a little spicy, but I tried it. WOW! Not too spicy, my family loved it, and I can't wait to try the rub on a boneless roast pork.

I'm always looking for new recipes for roasted chicken and this is definitely a keeper! The combination of spices is excellent. I tried the potatoes and squash as suggested, but I thought it they were a little to bland to stand up to the chicken. The next time I'll try the garlic mashed potatoes.

I prepared this recipe with chicken thighs, rather than a whole chicken with good results. The seasonings provided a nice change from the usual.
