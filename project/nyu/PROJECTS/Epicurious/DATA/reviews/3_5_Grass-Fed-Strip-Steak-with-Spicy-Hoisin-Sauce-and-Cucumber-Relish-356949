This was one of those dinners where my husband and I gave each other high fives while we ate. So much better than the sum of its parts. I sauteed some mushrooms and piled them on the plate with the steak, onions and sauce. Absolute perfection.

Hadn't had red meat for three years and was finally craving it after reading this recipe. Delicious. Our grill quit on us so we did a combo boil/slow bake at 250. Turned out nice. Added some stock to the steak so it wouldn't burn in the oven and threw some of that into the sauce.

My fiance and I really enjoyed this recipe, however, if you are looking for spicy you will be disappointed. There is no kick to the sauce at all, but it does taste fantastic. I didn't have cilantro so I substituted fresh parsley and cooked it under the broiler and then finished it on a grill pan to get a good sear. I would recommend cutting the cucumber a bit smaller, as we found it somewhat unwieldy. Will definitely make again.

My husband and I LOVED this! He raved all the way through the meal!I halved the recipe for just the two of us and prepared exactly as the recipe directed except for the onion. I shopped at Sprouts Market and they did not have Maui or Vidalia but did have Nevada Sweet, which I had never heard of; it was perfect. I cooked the sauce a litle too long, so it didn't have as much moisture as it should have. Nevertheless, it was wonderful beyond description. Even though I halved the relish, there was quite a bit left over. It was an ideal accompaniment and I can use the remainder tonight. I used prime J.J. Carver New Yorks from the frozen food section of Costco. The broiler did not make them look luscious before they were sliced, but once plated, they were very appealing. I served with spaghetti squash that I microwaved, cut individual wedges, added salt and pepper and topped with freshly grated parmesan cheese. This was a delicious, healthful meal.

Did this on the grill twice, one time I tried it with a whole venison loin. Great both times. At least as good with the venison, by my taste.

Agree with the cook from LA. I had to do this under my broiler, and I think it would have been better grilled. Nevertheless, the sauce was tasty. Good, though not exceptional.

The sauce was fantastic, as was the combination of flavors. Only problem was my broiler - didn't char the steaks as much as I would have liked.
