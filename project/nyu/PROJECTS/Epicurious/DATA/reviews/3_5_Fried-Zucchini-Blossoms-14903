I like to make these stuffed with Robiola cheese (it's very similar to regular cream cheese) seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.

These were pretty delicious, I gave four because it was so easy. I was worried about frying in oil but the batter really clung to the blossoms and there was no splatter during the frying (I was careful to make sure there was no water on anything. I used the female flowers and it was fine.

To add a little bit more flavor, I add a little paprika and pepper. It was really good. I strongly suggest people do this.

Easy to make and fun! I was actually really surprised this came out so well, but the batter was just the right consistency. I miss Italy this summer and this recipe helps! p.s. We used the extra batter to make onion rings - also a success.

These are great and simple way to have the instant Italy memories. I added salt and pepper to the batter and finished with a little salt. Divine. Makes the early morning at the farmer's market a real must-do to find these blossoms. I used canola oil but really was patient and waited until it was really really hot.

Contrary to purists- I used female flowers and they were still attached to a baby zucchini (maybe 3-4 inches long). They were very tasty. I opted to use a dark beer in the batter for more flavor. I sprinkled the blossoms with salt and finished them with freshly grated parmesan cheese. I would make them again.

this was really tasty. I stuffed them with a mixture of pesto and ricotta. It was super delicious. I found that sprinkling a fair amount of salt right when they were done really helped.

a simple recipe and delicious! I added a bit of salt and white pepper to the batter. We were sorry we didn't have more blossoms....

Made this recipe last week with my 11-13 year old students in our Italian Trattoria class. We stuffed them with Ricotta,egg,Parmesan,scallion, salt and pepper. They were heavenly.

Wow. I just popped the last one into my mouth. Having read other cooks' comments and surveyed some friends, here's what I did: Trimmed the blossoms with about an inch of stem for easy handling. Stuffed with a mixture of: half fresh ricotta, half roasted ricotta (a fabulous offering at our local cheese shop; I would have also used ricotta salata), oregano, and a sliver of anchovy. Twisted the ends closed. Dipped in egg, then in a the beer batter (which we made with Boddington's). Fried in a mixture of olive and canola oil. As they drained on paper towels, I grated a little parmesan over. Fantastic. The only change I'll make next time is to cut back on the anchovy just a little.

I love this recipe, but it is very important to get the oil hot enough - the first few I tried were a bit limp and therefore not as good as the crispier bunch I made later. Also, they taste great dipped in a bit of marinara.

My new son-in-law and I made this for the first time at a holiday dinner for company! It is a no-brainer to make and drew oohs and ahhs from our guests both for the presentation and the taste.We used Rolling Rock beer and followed the recipe removing nothing. We used a slotted spoon to turn and remove them so the crust would not get damaged and the batter wouldn't fall off... and we used Peanut oil because of its high flash point. MMMM good! They had the blossoms in my local supermarket. Next time we are going to stuff them.

Tried this with blossoms fresh out of the garden, 3-6". (Wash the flowers carefully if snails are in your area.) Following the discussion used egg wash, but the batter did not adhere in frying. Maybe a better grade beer than MGD is a good idea, and I would definitely add salt & pepper to flour/beer mixture. Zucchinis have a marvelous nutty flavor far distinct from everyday zuke and my thought are this is definitely a process to experiment with. Of the 4 made, only the blossom on the largest was less than scrumptious (M/F? I don't know). I will use olive oil, not canola, next time.

The blossom were ok like this. My Italian Grandmother recommended her method - dip the blossoms in an egg wash, salt and pepper them, and coat them simply in a flour, baking powder, and light parmesan mixture and then fry them in olive oil. Add a little more S & P before serving --- I had some homemade marinara sauce on hand - dipped them in there after frying them and that was great too. I tried pancake batter too with parmesan for the batter and they were just as tasty!

I had something similar in Italy ... the batter was thicker, but this was much lighter. Great with raw veggies as an appetizer.

For my first ever time cooking and eating these delights, we took the original recipe and modified. We used an egg wash first, followed by the recommended batter/frying method. We used a German wheat beer, and needed 1 cup to make the batter thin enought to use. This really gave depth to the taste. Really easy...I look forward to stuffing them now with other delights.

I haven't made this particular recipe, but one just like it. I stuff the blossom with a piece of mozzerella cheese and a small piece of anchovy before dipping it in the batter and frying. Just make sure to twist the top as closed as it will stay while you are dipping it in the batter. It is absolutely delicious. Even supposedly non-anchovy eaters love this (the anchovy melts and just adds a little salty kick).

This is a fair recipe but my mother used to make these blossoms for us when we were kids. You can use pumpkin, squash or zucchini flowers. She always used an egg wash on the blossoms, covered them in cracker crumbs and fried them in oleo. MOM'S RECIPE IS MUCH BETTER!!! TRY IT!!!

Ok, I'm not exactly a vegetable person, but I live in CA and went all the way over to Italy for the summer, and I decided to start trying new things. So, I got fried filled zuchinni blossoms and they were SSSSOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!!!Yeah, I know, darn! these aren't filled but at least i know that the italian ones were filled with RICCOTTA CHEESE and SPINACH! so, I'll just try different ratios and mixtures with the filling, but at least now I know how to fry them! P.S. I haven't tried these yet, I'm just excited that I found out how to fry them.

This is one of my favorite recipes. If you can't find flowers, you can use zucchini cut into quarters lengthwise and the batter is still great. Salt them well.

To the cook in Canada..you don't need to look for blooms in the market. Just put two or three squash plants among your flowers in the garden and you will have a great supply. You can easily grow either zucchini or yellow summer squash without any special care.

A wonderful old Italian tradition that should carry on for years to come! Have even made them with "Bisquick" batter when I had no flour & they were great...just maintain the thinner cosistency. Also try stuffing a small piece of fontina cheese inside...mmm! Great @ cocktail parties...always a pleaser & conversation grabber!
