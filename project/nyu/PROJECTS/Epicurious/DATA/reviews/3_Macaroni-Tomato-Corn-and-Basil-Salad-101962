This was a delicious, light-tasting, fresh salad, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Diced the veggies instead of slicing, and used 1/4 box of campanelle (bell flower) pasta instead of elbows. Season generously with salt and pepper, and a sprinkle of freshly-grated grana padano cheese on top. We didn't even have a full cup of basil, and it was STILL delicious. Definitely going in the regular rotation!

I got rave reviews and requests for the recipe when I made this. I left out the cucumber because I thought it wasn't appropriate in this dish. Must use fresh basil.

I loved this salad. It is very hard to find fresh herbs in the community where I live so I have to substitute dried basil for the fresh one called in the recipe and let the dressing rest in the fridge for 4-5 hrs to let the flavours with the garlic and mayo blend nicer. I added some salt and pepper to the dressing and added some more when I mixed it whith the veggies and pasta. It turn out to be a hit, I loved it, it is easy and fast to make and very rich in flavor. I would defenetly cook it again.

I give this recipe a reluctant 3 forks. It lacks something. I loved the pasta and veggies mix -- I used Japanese cuks and seeded the tomatoes. But the dressing needs something besides salt and pepper. Next time I'll try the low-fat herbed ranch dressing (on this site) and add extra basil. It's important to let this salad sit for at least a few hours for the flavours to blend. It tasted much better the next day.

I'd give this a 3.5 fork. I'd recommend using half the garlic (1 clove). I'd use 1/2 garlic clove if you're not big on garlic. (I quadrupled the recipe for a large party and only used 1 clove and it was plenty garlicky.) For a richer tasting dressing, I'd also recommend like others to substitute sour cream for half or all of the yogurt. If you want a more creamier salad, add some more mayo. Most of all, the dressing needs salt. Remember the salad will taste a lot less salty than the dressing tastes alone, especially if mix the dressing and salad beforehand.

Although all the ingredients in this salad sound good - put then together and it was horrible. My family politely ate it but I will never make it again.

Very good. I have been making this for years. I follow the recipe to a tea and it's great. Great non mayo pasta salad.

Terrific summer recipe! I doubled the recipe for a dinner party of 9 adults and 5 children. The children weren't wild about it, but it was very popular with the adults. It's a light, refreshing summer salad. I did take a couple of reviewer's suggestions and cut the tomato and cucumbers into small chunks as opposed to slices as the recipe is written. I also used fresh sweet corn. I used three types of basil from my garden. I also used a larger curly pasta in place of the macaroni for a more festive look.

This recipe is just okay in my book, nothing to rave about.

I also did not use a food processor and it came out fine. You can probably get away without so much basil this way as well.

Love it! Made this in a cabin with no food processor or blender - just chopped the basil fine with a knife. I also replaced the yogurt with sour cream and used those wonderful Sweet 100s cherry tomatoes cut in half. I was also fairly generous with the salt and pepper. Everyone loved it! Yummmm!

I have one word for this....SUMMER! It was terrific. I cubed the cuke and tomato so they were more uniform with the macaroni.

YUM! This is a great tasting salad! I used sour cream, as others did and added orange and yellow peppers as well. It's pretty and sooo tasty! I'll be making this again.

This was a great summer salad. Yes, red or green cubed peppers would have added even more color and crunch. Will definitely remember this recipe for a cool, refreshing complement to almost any meat on a hot summer evening.

Loved it. Used diced vegies rather than sliced and sour cream instead of Yogurt. Great fresh taste! My family really loved it.

The basil/lime dressing is a refreshing change. However, instead of yogurt, I used a bit of whipping cream and went easy on the lime juice. Didn't want it to be overly tart tasting. I also replaced the corn with sweet peas. Seems a much better compliment to the salad. Went great with fusili as I didn't have macaroni. Next time, I will reduce the garlic as it was a tad strong.

I don't care for mayonnaise-y pasta and potato salads, but this was delicious and fresh-tasting. The yogurt/garlic/basil/lime sauce is unusual and very good. I added a chopped red bell pepper to the salad as well, which gave it a nice crunchiness. It also keeps well-- the flavors blend nicely.

I love this salad. It is so fresh and tasty. I added more lime, also, for a little extra zip. The flavors are different but blend so well together. It's a perfect cookout side dish.

Excellent choice for something different than your run of the mill macaroni salad! Bearing in mind some of the previous warnings, I cut the cucumbers and tomatoes in a chunky dice. I also used about twice as much garlic (we LOVE garlic in our house), and used diced Vidalia onions instead of green onion to give it a little more kick. Even my son (who NEVER eats pasta salads) ate it all!

This is a favorite summer salad - and how often do you find a great tasting low fat macaroni salad? Instead of basil, we use cilantro, since we think it works better with the lime flavor. Also, we chop the cukes. Better texture. We also use fresh corn, cut off the cob and sauteed in the garlic with a drop of oil. We found the garlic too strong when raw in the dressing. This salad works great with any summer cookout fare.

I found the combination of flavors to be very strange. This salad might appeal to some people, but I wouldn't bring it to the company picnic.

Odd taste

This is one of my family's favorite salads. The flavor is very unique and really refreshing in the dead of summer. We like to serve it with smoked turkey when we are out on our houseboat! I double the garlic, but beware, this is for garlic lovers only...it makes it really, really strong. I also double the canned corn, or use fresh from the garden! Yum!

My guests and I loved the different, somewhat snappy flavor of this salad, which presents nicely due to the varied colors and textures. I served it a number of times last summer, usually with grilled fish or shrimp. I used halved cherry tomatoes and sliced the cucumber into "normal" sized slices, and didn't have some of the earlier problems. Fresh lime juice is a must, and I used a bit more than called for. The salad tastes best if it has warmed slightly from the refrigerator - it loses something when stone cold.

This salad was OK. The texture was more interesting than many pasta salads. However, it wasn't spectacular. Despite the unusual ingredients, the overall result was not memorable. But Hey, give it a try - maybe you'll love it.

After reading such favorable reviews of this salad I was really excited to try it, but I was very disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly, but the dressing was way too strongly flavored for anyone in my family and we wound up throwing the whole salad away.

This recipe is not only delicious, but it's also beautiful and makes a terrific presentation. I'll make it again but use more basil and possibly make it the day before so that the flavors will have the opportunity to merge. Next time, raher than pull out the processor for the dressing, I'll use the hand-held blender. I served this with "Roast Chicken with Orange, Lemon and Ginger" . . .what a meal!

I hate to be the only one who didn't enjoy it but... nothing great. The basil dressing did smell wonderful but overall, we just thought it was ok. The thinly sliced cucumbers wilted quickly. Small dice would have been a better bet. Probably a better way to cut the tomatoes too.

Perfect summer salad. My eleven year old son and I loved it! I used fresh corn on the cob. Otherwise, I followed recipe exactly. We had it with ribs, but will team up with grilled salmon next time.

I'm not a huge cold pasta salad fan, but this was exquisite. Definitely use the fresh corn if available. It adds a surprising texture and that sweetness you can only get from fresh corn. I think the recipe serves more than 4. The 1st time I made it was for 60 people. I quadrupled it, and, although everyone ate and raved over it, I still had substantial leftovers. I used about 1/2 again as much pasta as called for. Plenty of dressing. Excellent summer salad.

This is a nice variation to the usual side salads. I doubled the lemon juice.

Surprising medley of flavors and textures--very good with garden tomatoes and basil. My husband especially liked it. We used half the dressing and may omit it altogether next time for variety.
