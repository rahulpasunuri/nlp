I've made this salad twice, with yams, and we just love it. Once I served it on top of mixed spring greens and the other time ove chopped spinach leaves. It's a colorful and light accompaniment to any fish or steak meal.

easy and tasty. nice to have a cold sweet potato salad. love the idea of grilling the taters and will do that next time. We served with the companion recipe--grilled spice-rubbed skirt steak-yum.

It was really good and easy to make. I made it the night before as suggested and I also the the potatoes cool down before I put them in the emulsion, so they would be a little firmer. Will make again. We had the Memphis ribs with. Yum!

A previous review mentioned that steamed sweet potatoes go from done to mush in a matter of seconds. I agree. To avoid that possibility and to add flavor to the salad, I grilled them instead. I also grilled some onion and fennel as well. I also added minced shallots to the vinaigrette. It was fantastic that night and even better the next day. Please forgive me for reviewing the recipe with all of these changes...it's grilling season in Wisconsin. I couldn't help myself! Regardless of the changes, I would gladly make this recipe "as is" and still give it 4 forks.

I made this ahead of time, then added the onions just before serving as the recipe directs, and it was pretty good. But the leftovers next day were wonderful with a sublime blend of flavors. Next time I'll add more onions and allow the flavors to blend 8-12 hours.

Very good and a very interesting mix of flavors. It was a little salty for my taste, so I would probably leave the salt out of the vinaigrette. Also, I used an orange/champagne vinegar, which gave a nice bit of citrus to the salad; next time, I will definitely try a splash of orange juice, just to make it more interesting.

I thought this was very tasty and I'd definitely make it again. I think it would pair really well with grilled meat.

I've made this many times to serve with grilled meats, especially pork with a spicy rub. Adding some minced garlic to the vinaigrette and stirring in chopped cilantro at the end gives it a little bit more zip.

I'm not really a sweet potato lover. They are usually too sweet for me. But this recipe does not add additional sugar to the sweet potatoes, but instead pairs them with a mustard/vinegar dressing. I really liked it.

This was ok. It was a little bland for my taste - but a new way (for me) to serve sweet potatoes.

We did like this salad, a nice change from the usual sweet potatoes with yet more sweetness added in various forms. My 2 forks review isn't based on the fact that I overcooked them slightly. Ten minutes was too much, and sweet potatoes seem, to me, to change from too firm to mush in a matter of seconds. It's just that I think there are probably better combinations out there, such as the sweet potato salad (on this site) calling for lime juice, cilantro, and other perky spices. And we should all probably keep on eating our sweet potatoes, they're so darned healthy!

Great salad! The flavors are unique and really blend well. Works well with this main dish in this article. I received many compliments on this dish.

This was delicious, sweet with a zing ! It is even good left over and heated. Served this with barbecued ribs and a giant salad. Easy to prepare and delicous any time of year.

Excellent combination of flavors. A nice twist on potato salad -- very good served with the Grilled Spice-Rubbed Skirt Steak (from same article). I did have to increase the steaming time to closer to 15-20 minutes to achieve the tenderness I was looking for.

This was a delicious change from the standard potato salad. I loved the contrast of the sweet potatoes and the tangy vinagrette. Extremely easy to make and it disappeared quickly.
