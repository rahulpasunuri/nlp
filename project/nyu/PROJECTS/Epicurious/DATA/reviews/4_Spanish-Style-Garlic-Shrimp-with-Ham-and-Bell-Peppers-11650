Used 1 lb of shrimp, and 1/2 red bell pepper but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and it was excellent. Served with saffron rice, and avocado, red onion and tomato salad. Will definitely make again.

Great tapas or appetizer with a crusty bread. Use a really good sherry and your favorite flavorful ham. Be careful not to overcook the garlic slices and use the proportions described in the recipe to get the right sauce consistency. I have served this many times as an appetizer and in a pinch, as a fast Friday night dinner with a good Spanish white wine and a side salad. It's a keeper.

truly fabulous when made properly perfect the first time I made it, not so good the second, when I overcooked the garlic (became bitter) and used a not great sherry. a good way to use the leftovers from the holiday ham

I did not salt the shrimp for 10 minutes as the recipe said, and thought the dish was excellent!

This recipe was a huge hit at my Christmas dinner. Kids and adults alike. The garlic is not overpowering, the ham is a nice contrast to the shrimp. The presentation is gorgeous ( I plated it) This is a must for those who love shrimp and a great introduction to those who have only had shrimp cocktail. Wonderful and Yummy!

Seldom do I give a four fork rating, but this was delicious. I served it over rice as a main dish for my husband and myself. I dressed the rice up with a couple of tablespoons of sherry vinegar boiled with sugar, then stirred into the finished rice. This gave a little more interest to the rice and went well with the shrimp/ham dish.

Superb recipe! I usually only rate items that are really good (or really bad...as a warning!), and this dish is awesome. Made it last night with the Pork Empanadas (also highly recommend!) from this site, and dinner was fantastic! Definately use a Spanish cream sherry for this, as it really enhances the flavor of the shrimp.

WOW! What a fantstic recipe. The mixture of the shellfish & ham was delightful. Don't think I've ever tasted more succulent shrimps. I used large, black tiger shrimp. It's a keeper which I'll definitely make again

This dish certainly scored me some brownie points with my better half. I made it with the roasted garlic salmon dish, served with a nice bottle of wine. Fun to make and tastes great.
