This was delicious and I will be adding it to our regular rotation of recipes. I made it as a main course for 1 and as a side (with a salmon burger) for 1 other person and there were no leftovers. The only substitutions I made were: turkey bacon, balsamic vinegar (as recommended by another reviewer) and very little oil. It came out great. The only changes I would make next time are to add less caraway (person I made it for though it was overpowering the other flavors) and to try it with the recommended vinegar (the balsamic was good, but I thought that was a little too overpowering).

i made this with the balsamic vinegar as suggested + omitted the bacon to make it vegetarian. it was wonderful. the flavour did not suffer at all for the lack of bacon, the caraway, balsamic + green flavours blended beautifully. i also cut back on the oil to 1T, just enough to quick sautee/sear the brussel sprouts. non-vegs loved it too!

If you like brussel sprouts, you'll enjoy this. I did not add the extra oil and used balsamic vinegar instead of white wine vingear. It was very tasty. Even the non-brussel sprout lovers loved it.
