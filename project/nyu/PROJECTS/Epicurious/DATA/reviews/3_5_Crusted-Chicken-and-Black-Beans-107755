Up-front confession: I didn't use tortillas--and would have opted for whole-wheat if I did--but instead mushed up the whole thing with short-grain brown rice. I was looking for a way to use up a bunch of chicken left over from making chicken soup. Hubby and I gobbled this up anyway. We thought of it affectionately as yummy hippy glop--the short of thing we ate a lot of in college and grad school--and realized we should eat this way more often again. I had enough chicken for two batches, and made one with salsa verde, omitting the tomato and using chopped pepper (the latter went into both, actually).

This is a really, really great way to use leftover Thanksgiving turkey!

I am surprised this recipe did not get 100%! My family, friends and I love it! Of course ... I use a wonderfully roasted free range chicken from Whole Foods and I add chopped red bell pepper, sweet corn, and fresh salsa from the deli section instead of jarred or canned. Try it that way and it will be a 5 fork meal!

Brilliantly simple, simply delicious. This recipe is very easy to play with. I used hominy style corn which added a really authentic Mexican flavor and then just threw in a couple more things: frozen green pees and kidney beans. Next time I make this I'll throw in some onions and definitely more beans.

Made this as per recipe except for omitting the tomato(Tomato based salsa) and adding some red onion.Excellent bang for the buck in terms of ease/cost/nutrition ratio. Definitely falls in the "keeper" category.

We're so glad we ran across this recipe. It's hearty, delicious, and now added to our family favorites.

Great for an easy casserole. We have changed it up though the last few times we made it. We double the black beans, put in more cheese and cilantro, and add either a small can of green chiles or chopped jalepeno. We got rid of the tortillas. Then we serve it with some gaucamole on the side. We also use a roasted chicken from the grocery store.

Overall, it was ok... i made this and then realized that i had pitas.. not tortillas... so the topping came out a little rough. Otherwise a good dish... I would probably make it again as a taco dip for a superbowl party without the tortilla topping bc it went great with nachos!

Great comfort food for a cold snowy evening when there's no time for slow-food. Many of the comments of others were helpful. This dish yields well to tweaking and substitutions. I used a broasted chicken from my local deli, salsa w/jalapeno and pepper-jack instead of monterey-jack.

I took everybody's suggestions and combined them. I added corn and red bell pepper and cut the amount of chicken down by half. I also used corn tortillas and placed them on the bottom of the casserole pan and then used corn chips for the cover. The tortillas on the bottom soaked up all the juice and kept the casserole together. I used half monterey jack cheese and half cotija which made an excellent combo. I also made a vegetarian version at the same time with extra firm tofu that I marinated and crumbled, and zucchini in place of the chicken. Kept the cheese in the recipe. We all thought it was just as good.

I agree...what a great use of left over chicken. I liked the simplicty and quickness (except the shredding of the chicken, Heh) of this dish. I too added corn and red peppers for some added color and a little sweetness. I took some cold leftovers to a pool party and it was actually a nice dish for the hot summer day. People thought that it was suppoesed to be a cold dish.

This was a great use of leftovers. I added a can of chopped chilies to the mix. As topping, I mixed a handfull of Dorito chips and grated cheddar cheese in a mini processor. This makes a great topping for this dish, a taco salad, or any other Mexician dish.

Extremely yummy family recipe! My 5 yr old loved it and wanted leftovers 2 days in a row! I added corn and chopped red bell pepper, also topped with low fat sour cream. Left cover off longer for crispier tortillas. Used fresh medium salsa, omitted chopped tomato. Also made this dish for a family that just had a new baby, and they loved it. All my mom friends are asking me for "my recipe".

I thought this was very good. I had everything but the chicken so I ran out for that -- otherwise, this was very quick and easy. I did think it was a little too "chickeny". I'm not used to the meat being the base of a casserole, but the flavors were very good. My husband loved it and brought leftovers to work the next day.

Atlanta, I always finish mine under the broiler, so it gets a beautiful, golden brown "crust". It makes it look a lot nicer.

This dish was easy and very tasty, however the name is a bit misleading as there was not much "crust". I would definately make again, but experiment with different toppings as I found the flour tortilla difficult to cut when serving and a bit boring to look at. Does anyone have any other suggestions?

I used rotisserie chicken and added a dollop of sour cream when served. Delicious.

My whole family loved this. I added black olives and red bell pepper and left the dish uncovered when baking. It had a wonderful flavor.

This casserole was a wonderful way to use up somethings that were taking up space in the fridge! I doubled the tomato (halved the recipe but still used a whole tomato), substituted dried cilantro for fresh, olive oil for corn and, like the previous reviewer, forgot to cover. Hubby said, "Make again--not every week though."

I thought this casserole was very good the first time I made it, but this time it was SUPERB. Maybe it was because I used a highly seasoned supermarket rotisserie chicken. I also increased the cilantro to two tablespoons and the cumin to 1 teaspoon. In addition I sprinkled olive oil over the tortillas rather than corn oil, and, most importantly, I forgot to cover the dish when it went into the oven. I think this made all the difference. The tortillas came out truly crusty and crunchy, making the casserole taste, and feel, a lot like really good home made nachos. Next time I will be cutting the tortillas a bit smaller to increase the nacho-like appeal of the dish. Well, I think this recipe is fabulous and I'll make it frequently. For the record, my 4 year old daughter and 15 month old son both ate lots, a winner in my book.

I'd actually only give this 2.5 stars. I did enjoy it, but wasn't too impressed. One thing I have made again is the chicken filling part of this recipe, modified a little bit to use as a taco filling. It came out quite well.

Like the reviewer from Nashville, I didn't expect this to be a great dish, but I needed a quick meal last night so I thought I'd give it a try. To my surprise, it was very tasty! More importantly, though, my husband had three servings, so I know he liked it! I just boiled the chicken last night, but next time I'll cook it with some onion and jalapenos to give it a little more flavor.

This a quick and tasty meal to make during the week. Everyone who tried it, loved it and asked for the recipe. I use uncooked tortillas which I buy at the grocery store and think they have a better texture then the precooked ones. This one is a keeper.

I didn't think this would be such a great recipe until I made it. It was a hit. I added corn next time I made this, and it was even better.

awesome. I loved the chicken, salsa, and black beans together. Also, I loved the idea of tortillas on top. YUM!

In Response to the reviewer from Cedarburg, WI. I recently moved to the East Coast from the perfect little town of Cedarburg, WI. It's embarrassing to me that the attitude and snobbery of the last reviewer could reflect on a community of great people. I personally found this to be a great do ahead weeknight meal. Added canned Chipotles to give it the zip we crave.

I followed the recipe as listed, using the left over chicken from making stock. Could only find jalapeno jack, not too spicy and added a very complimentary flavour to the dish. My 14 year old son asked for seconds, my indication of "a keeper"

Okay southern California, let's make it real simple....it means that the ENTIRE casserole is crusted,not just the chicken, hence, the tortillas on top.

I made this in the morning up to the point of filling the casserole, then added cheese & tortillas on top when I was ready to cook it. I put in corn & olives as recommended, plus added couscous and a can of diced tomatoes with juice (to compensate for the couscous) - was great.

This was a great recipe to travel with. I brought it to a party. I cooked it for the 30 minutes and then when I arrived at my destination added the cheese on top and cooked it for the remaining time. Everyone loved it I had to forward the recipe to them all. I too used a cooked deli chicken. The meat was cold going into the receipe which was quick to put together. Very delicious, thanks for sharing!

This was a great casserole. The cumin gave it a real Mexican taste. Really lovely. Instead of going to all the work with a roasted chicken I just cut up a few boneless, skinless chicken breasts and poached them. I would suggest using a bit less black beans, but overall I think it's a great recipe. I will be making this again for my family.

Where was the crusted chicken? The ingredients just didn't meld. I'm glad I didn't serve this to guests. My husband ate it because he was hungry.

At our house we call this kind of recipe cheep thrills. It was tasty made as stated but nothing wonderful. Great for a quick meal which we used it for and then had left overs on Saturday. Used a precooked deli chicken and the second heating it was a little mushy but still tasty. By the way this is my review. My husband loved it both times and for that reason I am sure we will make it again.
