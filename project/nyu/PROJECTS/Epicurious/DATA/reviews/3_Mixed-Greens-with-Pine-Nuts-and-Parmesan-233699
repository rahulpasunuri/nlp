This is such a simple salad and great when you want a light uncomplicated side. How can you not like it?

This salad is not heavy on ingredients, but has a wonderful flavor with all the additions melding together to produce a great salad. For color and a little extra sweetness (aside from the balsamic vinegar) I added some dried cranberries. And to those who poo poo this recipe for lack of ingredients, a Hemingway quote- "Poor Faulkner-does he really think big emotions come from big words? There are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones that I use." The same can be said of recipes. Get off your high horse and enjoy a simple salad!

I thought this was simple to make and the flavour was wonderful. I made this last week for dinner with my parents and I've been craving it ever since.

I liked it. I brought this simple dish to a party and people devoured every last bite.

This is a nice example of 'dressing up' a salad. Bits of apple, pear, berries, pastachio nuts etc are frequently overlooked for the standard tomato,cucumber, pepper combinations. Thank you for perking up a side dish.

My daughter makes a dish very similar to this with fresh greens - a delicious, healthy and quick veg.

Since when don't people like recipes with a minimum of ingredients and ease of preparation??? My husband and I thought the flavors were fresh and bright, and the sweetness of the vinaigrette balanced well with the sharp saltiness of the parmesan. The pine nuts added a nice texture and crunch. I'll be making this often.

Thanks for the yummy, yet simple idea. Despite Jimmy's sarcasm, there are plenty of people (that would be me) on this Recipe Flash that benefit from some guidance even with the most simple dishes. I gain inspiration from these simple suggestions to try things I may otherwise think are not worth the effort.

This was fine, but so what? A bag of greens from the grocery store dressed up with a pretty basic vinaigrette. For this we need a recipe?
