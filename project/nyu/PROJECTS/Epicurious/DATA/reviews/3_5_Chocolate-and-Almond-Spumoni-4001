I was just a little let down by this recipie. I was hoping for spumoni more like I had eaten in restaurants. I was pleased with the flavor--the almonds are a very nice touch. But I was less impressed with the texture. Not very creamy, more like Ice milk. I think in the future I will stick with gelate that you mix with an ice cream maker to the texture will be smoother.

I made this recipe perfectly the first time... which means it rates. I brought it to a work function and everyone raved. The recipe was shared with many and will be enjoyed by a lot more than that.

This chocolate almond spumoni was excellent. We have made it several times. We even used this recipe as base for a variation to make coconut spumoni, using coconut flakes, coconut milk and macadamia nuts, for a hawaiian flare.
