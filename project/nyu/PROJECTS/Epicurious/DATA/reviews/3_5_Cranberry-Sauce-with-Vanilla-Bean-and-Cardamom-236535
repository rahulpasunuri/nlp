I've been making this for several years now and it's amazing. It's always a big hit, and is requested each year. I leave the vanilla bean in overnight as well. If its too sweet, you can always cut back on the original sugar amount. I've contemplated spooning it over ice cream in the past. It's that good!

My BIL has made this twice now. I love it & everyone else seems to like it as well. If I ever get called on for cranberry sauce, I'll use this recipe.

this is a great recipe - but it's better if combined with the cardamom honey apricot cranberry sauce. (see my recipe box - it's an epicurious recipe). something about the added apricot that gives a subtle floral complexity to the flavor and a glorious smoothness to the texture.

The vanilla and cardamom just way overwhelmed the sauce. It might be good on its own or in particular contexts but as a Thanksgiving side, it just was too much. It didn't complement the meal.

I have made my own version of this recipe for several years now, but didn't add the cardamon. But adding the cardamon adds more depth to this recipe and a beautiful finish.

This was really lovely if you like a sweeter cranberry sauce. The fragrance was amazing. My family loved it so much they requested it for Thanksgiving agin this year.

Just okay - I was not blown away. A good sauce if you're looking for something different.

Loved this sauce. Used ground cardamom because it was all I had at hand, but it worked perfect. Leaving the vanilla bean inside the sauce overnight really adds a punch to it. Enjoy!

Three forks as is, four forks if you cut the amount of cardamom by 1/3 or 1/2. Made this for thanksgiving dinner and it was delicious, and BURSTING with cardamom flavor. 'Sultry and Sweet', as described. Next time, will half the cardamom

I've just finished making this cranberry sauce, my first ever from scratch, and it turned out really great. I would have really crushed the cardamom in retrospect, instead lightly crushing them as the recipe calls for, but overall I really dig it.
