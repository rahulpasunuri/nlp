What are the instructions for the salad doing there?

Have made this for years - it's the easiest no-brainer appetizer I know of. Make it with non-fat yogurt, drained for the day in the fridge (the whey is very useful for making bread, so don't throw it away!). Substituted dried oregano for the summer savory. Increased the cumin and cayenne just slightly. Every time I make this to take to some party, I get the comment "what is this? it's great!" It's amazing how it gets disguised under the savory topping. Will also use as a healthy topping for baked potatoes, as an alternative to sour cream.

Excellent dip or spread. I make my yogurt cheese with 2% milk and it is always nice and thick and delicious. I find the cheese cloth method to be messy and the finished yocheese is hard to get off of the cloth. One filter set in a Melita (or other brand of plastic coffee filter, over a jar in the the fridge overnight works fine. One filter is all that you need, not a handful. You will have to use two jars and two filters for a whole quart of yogurt or if you can find one, a large plastic filter. I use #4 paper coffee filters per plastic filter.

Awesome! I don't really see what using lowfat yogurt would hurt...I can't do very rich dairy in any case. Regardless, this was great. I served it alongside the ground lamb kebabs and the chopped arabic salad, both of which are on this website. We made little lamb kebab pita sandwiches using this as a spread, then drizzling hot pepper paste over them, and they were divine. This yogurt cheese would be fantastic as a dip at a party because it isn't so rich that people would feel bloated and too full to enjoy dinner. I will definitely be making it again.

So simple and delicious -- and it lends itself to all sorts of adaptations with different combinations of herbs --

I've made this several times -- it's excellent and it's easy. If you don't have cheesecloth (I have since bought some!) you can use a thick handful of coffee filters to drain the yogurt.

Great as lunch or appetizer. The first batch disappeared, we had to make more!//For breakfast, try raspberry flavored honey and walnuts instead of the spices.
