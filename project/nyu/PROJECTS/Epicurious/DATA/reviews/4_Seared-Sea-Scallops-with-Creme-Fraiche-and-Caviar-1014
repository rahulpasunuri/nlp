This was so easy and so,so delicious! We loved it!!!!! Make sure you use creme fraiche. It paired very well with champagne. I will make this often as it is a fast dish to put together and very impressive looking though somewhat fidgety.

I've made this a million times and it wows every single time. I find that if you use just a little bit of truffle butter to sear it tastes even better... JUST A LITTLE BIT, though. You don't want to overpower the other flavors. SUCH a winner...

I thought this was really good but not quite worthy of a four. It was quick & easy to make and looked great on the plate. I actually just used 2 scallops since I was making it as part of an appetizer trio and it was a hit with my husband who isn't that keen on scallops. I served it with a devilled egg half and a mini make ahead lobster souffle which was outstanding. (Recipe for the lobster souffle is in Food & Drink Holiday Edition 2011 p 258 (a publication from the Liquor Control Board of Ontario ) and their recipes are also online.

These are amazing. I served them on a toast circle as the scallops were small and I wanted them more as finger food. Everyone Raved! Served with some champagne of course!

I have served this several times and it is the best opener for a meal that I have found. Serve on a red bibb lettuce leaf with creme fraiche and a sprinkle of tabiko caviar. Love that it can be served at room temperature.

This recipe is a star and easy to prepare and serve at room temp which makes the prep so much easier. I often auction my dinners for charity and this appetizer (first course) gets everyone in the mood for a great evening of great food. Don't change a thing. Be careful when using a black caviar that you place it perfectly or you will end up with inky creme fraiche.

Great recipe. Expensive, but quick and impressive. However, i usually use butter as opposed to oil to cook the scallops in. Has a better taste in my opinion.

I really enjoyed the scallop as a base to this decadent hors d'oeuvres. The creme fraiche really kicked this up a notch (couldn't imagine making w/ sour cream....) Perfect with a nice bottle of bubbly.

we centered a meal around a large jar of Beluga. this was without-a-doubt the only way to ever eat caviar again (except for with a spoon). amazing.

Served this dish up today (Christmas Day) as our entree. Everybody was really pleased with it, looked fab and tasted great. I used creme fraiche with champagne and had to substitute the chives for diced spring onion, added a dash of lime to balance the sweet taste of the creme fraiche. Excellent, definitely a winner!

Yum! This was pretty (I served them on colorful plates), rich, decadent and delicious! I used black lumpfish caviar and sour cream. Be careful not to oversalt the scallops, as the caviar is salty. This is so easy, and goes in my permanent file. GREAT with champagne!

Fabulous! Quick! Elegant!The comments of others inspired this variation and helped me achive a greater contrast of flavors and color. I sauted the scallops in butter. For the sauce, I stirrd the red caviar into the creme fraiche. It created a beautiful rosy color. Finally, I garnished the scallops with smoked salmon. All my guests licked their plates.

I made this dish last valenitines day and am planning on making it again this year. As the previous review suggested I used lox torn into confetti size pieces instead of caviar. So simple yet so elegant.

This is so simple, beautiful and elegant. I went to the trouble to make creme fraiche for my first attempt, but found that sour cream works just as well. Do NOT use fat free sour cream! I wish someone would tell me about a beautiful presentation, as it actually is just a white scallop sitting in a puddle of sour cream or creme fraiche, with colorful caviar on top. How did you serve this?

I made this dish and LOVED it! I used salmon roe and sourcream and sauted the scallops in butter. It was fabulous for me but unfortunately I made it for the wrong crowd. I served it to my husband, and parents who either don't like fish, were turned off by the look of roe or were dissapointed that the result was warm and not hot. But for me the scallops were dreamy and rich. I would make this again for my chic martini friends and not my plain food parents.

I made this dish tonight and it is out of this world. No sour cream was used (because it is, well, sour) and no creme fraiche because I have no idea where to buy it. Instead, I made my own sauce: After searing in olive oil, remove scallops (I used whole ones). Drain excess oil and deglaze with white wine. Throw in a pat of butter. Add half a cup of heavy cream, some dill weed (you know how much to add; you're all cooks) and a freshly crushed garlic clove. Simmer and pour over the artfully arranged scallops. Then dab the caviar over each scallop. I used red lump fish caviar. Then sprinkle chopped chives and serve. The appearance is a jaw-dropper and the whole dish tastes like heaven. You won't be disappointed.

Made this as a last minute Super Bowl party appetizer-it was a huge hit. The store was out of caviar, so I substituted a small slice of Nova Scotia Lox on each scallop. The result was very pleasing to the pallate, but I am also looking foward to using caviar next time. I used sour cream and also found it was not necessary to slice the scallops. A delicious and easy recipe.

OUTSTANDING! Simple, elegant, delicious. Not only is it a classy presentation, but it is also a delightful change from the usual. I WAS a professional chef -- and wish this had been my idea. I served this at a dinner party (left them whole) with sauteed snap peas and sliced mushrooms.

Simple but perfect, this recipe showcases the pure, sweet flavors of the ingredients. Well worth the expense, we used osetra caviar for a splurge since it was New Years. Perfect for any special occasion.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and it was quite impressive and tasty. I topped the dish with beluga, and I sauteed the scallops in olive oil instead of veggie oil (I may try sesame or peanut oil in future rounds for a smokier effect). You can also use a good sour cream instead of creme fraiche, and it is not necessary to slice the scallops in half. All in all, it's worth the expense.

A great Appetizer with Chardonnay.
