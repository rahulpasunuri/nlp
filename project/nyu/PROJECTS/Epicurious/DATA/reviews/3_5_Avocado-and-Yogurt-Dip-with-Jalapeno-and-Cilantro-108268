Mmm.. Beware: this dip is additively good, especially when paired with pita chips. luckily its pretty healthy! Would also be good as a dip with apples

Green color is lovely. Tastes basically like guacamole, but is creamier.

Yummers, this was sooo good! I loved the creamy texture of the Greek yogurt. I also added a little lime zest for zip and served it with stacy's bagel chips and veggies.

I used fat-free sour cream in place of the yogurt, because that's what we had. Very tasty!

I used parsley instead of coriander. It was nice. Nothing exceptional though.

This is OK, I added more jalapeno, I'm not sure I liked the creaminess the strained yogurt gives this dip. I much prefer straight guacamole.

I have made this several times and its always a big success. Its not that labor intensive and its great for summer!

This dip was a real hit with my dinner guests. I accidentally used low fat yogurt and only had about an hour to drain it but it worked out great. A real keeper

This was excellent--smooth and creamy, with just the right balance of herbs and spices. One tip: use mediterranean yogurt, instead of straining your own. Mediterranean yogurt is already strained,is quite thick, and can be purchased full-fat or low-fat. I guessed that 2 cups of regular yogurt would strain down to about a cup, which is how much mediterranean yogurt I used.

Loved this dip!! Strained the yogurt per the recipe (didn't have a cheesecloth but used a cotton pillow case instead) and very impressed with results -- soooo creamy and enjoyed the nifty little "kick". Served with zuchinni and carrot sticks at super bowl party.

So tasty and low fat! I also substituted 1 cup yogurt and 1/3 c. low-fat sour cream. My diet-conscious girlfriends raved about it!

I cheated, a little, I did not drain the yogurt and instead used 1 cup yogurt and 1/3 cup sour cream to get the rich consistancy. I used the leftovers as a dip for veggies and chicken fingers and also a sandwich spread. Excellent and versatile.

Haven't made the recipe yet, but plan to this weekend. I did note however the comment regarding the runniness of the dip the next day, so I'd like to offer an observation... Some yogurts don't drain well because they are thickened with gelatin. The gelatin interfers with the draining process. Most yogurts that contain acidopholous are okay, but do check the ingredients on your yoghurt container! The resulting yogurt cheese (middle eastern labneh)should not be runny at all.

Excellent! Made it for a BBQ, and served it with vegetables and tortilla chips. Big hit! Make sure to soak the yogurt in the cheesecloth over night, definitely creates a better consistency.

I love this recipe! I did make a couple of changes, though. Try draining the yogurt for about an hour or so to minimize the liquid and add 2 tsp. lime juice to retain color (also adds a little kick).

I'm re-rating this recipe because of an observation after i reviewed it the first time. If you don't use it all at once, it turns to liquid. I wanted to save some for the next day, and it had discolored (which is not totally surprising) and had the consistency of a smoothie. it still tasted good, but it was a pretty significant change. maybe it was my yogurt? i made it again just to make sure it wasn't a fluke, and set aside half in the fridge. a few hours later it had already started to liquefy, although not as bad as overnight. anyone else notice this? it's still good, and i'd make it again, but it would be bad to try to make ahead.

Great dip! Made this with the "Peach and Cucumber Salsa" (on the previous page in the same issue of Bon Appetit) and served with heated taco chips -- a very nice combination for an evening snack. Would definitely make again!

A great-tasting, less fattening alternative to traditional guacamole. It was a big hit with the Low-Fat Chili Tortilla Chips and icy-cold margaritas! Will definitely make this one again. Next time, I'll add some chopped fresh tomato for a little color.

Made this for a family get-together. Everyone loved it. Leftover dip was even better the next day. Will definitely make this again.
