This is a fantastic recipe especially when you have a delicious english hot house cuc. I like the seeds.

Yummy! Leave out the sesame seeds, add 1 tsp. sugar, and this is exactly like the cucumber salad my grandmother used to make for me when I was little. She would also throw in Napa cabbage hearts and julienned carrots. I'm on my second batch and just went out to get more veggies to make more!

When I made this following the recipe, it basically came out tasting cucumbers in really sweet vinegar. If I make it again I will omit the sugar entirely and replace half the vinegar with soy sauce, to make the flavor a bit more mature and closer to the actual Japanese salad dressing.

For those that wanted this salad a little spicier, we make a similar one and add some of the asian chili sauce that comes in the squeeze bottle. Mmmm...I'd like some right now...

I searched a lot of recipes for this dish and this one looked the best. I used english cukes which do have small seeds and cut them out. A pinch of sugar is not enough. I kept adding to taste and probably used at least 1/4 cup. I added a little cayenne as prior readers suggested and it added to the recipe. I sliced the cukes instead of using ribbons. Let it sit for 2 hours. Overall, not bad. Still searching for that "perfect" blend of ingredients that would make this dish taste right.

I've made this salad dozens of times. My husband calls it "sushi salad" because of all the oriental flavours. We love it. For the cooks who had trouble slicing the cucumber, I found that a really top-quality vegetable peeler works best (try Mr. Goodgrips). I also find that if I curl the ribbons around my finger before letting them fall into the bowl, it makes a nicer presentation. So-called "seedless" cucumbers (which aren't) work best. I scrape out the seeds with a spoon.

The dressing on this salad is really tasty! I'll definitely keep this one around as an alternative to the vinegar/sugar/water and cuke salad. I used a carrot peeler for the cukes and it took forever and turned to mush pretty quickly. I think i'll just slice them next time.

This recipe was easy, different and very delicious. I used three regular cucumbers, seeded per instructions, instead of the seedless type. I also took previous reviewers' advice and sliced my cucumbers about one-quarter inch thick rather than cutting into ribbons. Even so, I wouldn't make this salad more than an hour before serving to maintain crispness. It was very refreshing, and the sesame oil, ginger, etc. give it a distinctly Asian taste that goes great with the cukes. I added a small pinch of cayenne -- about the same amount of sugar -- and thought it was perfect. I'll be making this one a lot.

I'd give this 2 and a half, if that was an option. I agree with previous posters that cayenne or some sort of hot pepper is necessary to really get the hot/sweet taste. I, too, just did this with cucumber slices instead of the ribbons and it was very easy and refreshing - a nice salad to go with an asian main course.

Totally agree with the Florida reviewer. This recipe REQUIRES the addition of red pepper flakes, or better yet, a pinch of ground cayanne. Also, the sugar is NOT optional. That way, you get a much better ying and yang. P.S. Slices actually work better if you'll be leaving to salad to sit for more than an hour, as they don't get as soggy.

We served this side dish for a dinner party with a pacific rim menu. It was pronounced a "hit," and the recipe was requested several times.

I think the oil/acid ratio in this recipe is wrong. I blended the dressing in my mini-food processor and drizzled in olive oil until I acheived a more balanced taste. I sweetened with a bit of honey and the recipe worked quite well. When revised, I'd rate the recipe at "3 forks up!"

I served this salad on an "Asian Fusion" buffet and it was a big hit. I also prepare it for family meals, too.

Thin slices are easier to prepare. Also added a pinch of red pepper flakes to lend a bite.
