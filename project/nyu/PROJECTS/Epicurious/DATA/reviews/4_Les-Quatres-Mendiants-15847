This is an excellent recipe. I have made it several times and swapped out the types of nuts and dried fruit and it is always a hit.

Favorite of all time..at least since 1998. So good and so easy. Have made them for gifts every Christmas!

I made these New Year's Eve 1998 and guests were fighting over the last one at a dinner party! I added dried cherries as well as raisins. Now, I make it every New Year's!
