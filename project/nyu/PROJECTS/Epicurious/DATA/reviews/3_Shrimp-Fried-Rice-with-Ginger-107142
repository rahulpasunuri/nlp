This was just nasty. Granted, I used brown rice instead of the rice pilaf, but still...nasty, nasty.

Yum! I used what I had... didn't do a special shopping! I used basmati rice and gulf shrimp. Didn't have hoisin so used Thai fish sauce, and did add the soy sauce per the other cooks' suggestions. Yum, yum, yum! And in case you'd like to know what veggies work in this... I used chopped baby bok choy, a chopped bulb of fennel, scallions, a sweet potato that I diced and boiled separately and added at the end with a half bag of baby spinach. Very tasty. The fennel had me worried but added a very nice dimension! Seems quite versatile... a mother's love!

It's a great start. Definitely needs the salt and pepper at the end. Soy sauce does wonders as well (and obviously negates the need for table salt). Delicious! Flavorful without being "spicy" although my 6 year old daughter though it was too much for her.

As an Asian cook, I'm impressed with this recipe. I subsituted brown rice and oyster sauce instead. Some toasted sesames sprinkled on top adds a nice garnish. I also like some cilantro in my fried rice dishes.

Easy to prepare, a great weeknight meal. I also tried with beef, was good but better with shrimp.

We like this recipe very much - it's quick and easy and has nice oriental flavor. I did cut the sesame oil in half and only used 3/4 lb of shrimp in order to cut down on some of the fat and calories.

I thought this was very tasty and easy to prepare. I added an extra tablespoon of hoisin sauce, a healthy spoon of chili paste (we like spicy foods)and a bit of soy sauce near the finish. I will also try this with chicken. Although I chopped all my veggies - I will cruise the salad bar the next time I'm in a hurry.
