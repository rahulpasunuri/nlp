I must have done something wrong because I was really dissatisfied with this bread. None of my guests liked it either. The only thing I did differently that would afect flavour was I used both ground anise pod (very little) and the seeds. I think it was just too overwhelming of a flavour. Otherwise I followed the directions of the recipe. I'd not rule the recipe out but probably will make other breads instead first.

Maybe my Franco-Celtic family just hasn't caught the limpa train but we found these twists far too dense and not that flavourful. To be fair, I didn't use a dough hook -- perhaps that is key? I sent some over to my fiancé's Thanksgiving and apparently some members of his (Romanian-Swede) family really liked them -- although not enough for me to go through the whole fraught process again.

Great taste and texture with the right amount of moisture. Similar to but softer than limpa.

Excellent Bread. I only put in 1 tsp. of orange rind and am glad. 2 Tblsp would've been overly orangey. The amount of flour was exact and the texture of the bread moist and delicious. My kids and friends loved. The twist froze beautifully,too.
