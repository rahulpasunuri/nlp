Great with burgers and steaks. I always use this one for a quick, spicy alternative to potato salad.

I have made this salad more than once and it is always well received. I did substitute fresh corn, red pepper and black beans for the hominy and Jicama. Somehow the latter combination just didn't seem appealing. I also diced the potatoes to half the recommended size. One warning: this is time consuming recipe, lots of dicing and chopping. But the outcome is a pleasant welcome from your traditional potato salad and very tasty.

Two thumbs down on this one. I almost always like different and unusual but I just found this strange and beyond repair. The hominy gives it an odd, strong corn flavor that just does not work.

Good, unusual potato salad, I've made it several times and I am about to make it again. It's not bland at all, just make sure you add enough salt! Believe me, no dish with a tablespoon of cumin and a whole jalepeno pepper is bland.

Really liked the texture with the jicama, but flavors were too bland, even with extra jalapeno.

I used a 2 lb bag of mixed blue, red and yukon gold potatoes, left the peels on but otherwise followed the recipe. I served it with chipotle lime grilled chicken (from this site) at a casual barbecue. Everyone thought it was a great non mayo salad (except my husband who thinks mayo is a whole food group on its own).

Sorry to rain on the parade here, but this recipe was a total disappointment. It sounded great and we took pains to actually follow the recipe quite closely, the only deviation being white hominy for the golden hominy we couldn't find. The sauce even looked and smelled quite appetizing but when it was all together, it just didn't make it. The taste was flat and kind of odd. We finally tried adding mayo and Italian dressing but it was beyond rescue. Unusual for us to be totally turned off by a "four fork" recipe.

What a refresing take on potato salad sans mayonnaise or sour cream! I used cucumber for the jicama to get the crunch, white hominy, and red potatoes since those were ingredients on hand. This is the best Southwestern style potato salad I've ever made. Do try it, but go easy on the hot pepper.

A unique take on potato salad! I made this for a party with more than a few picky queens present and it was a smash! Yukon gold were running big at my grocery, and it took a few tries before I could find jicama & hominy. I added a little more lime juice and olive oil to coat. Tasty!

Wow this is the best potato salad! The garlic gets stronger the next day so if you are used to doubling the garlic watch out. Yum this is a keeper.

Great! Yes, the red potaoes are fine, just don't overcook them. Truly wonderful

I used red potatoes and left the skin on. This was a good salad for the mayonaise haters in my family.

Absolutely fabulous dish - made this when it was first published back in 1998 for my husband's 40th birthday! Didn't change a thing. It is a staple in our summer BBQ menu. Enjoy!

Unusual mix of ingredients which made it very interesting. I took it to a picnic and people loved it - but couldn't quite figure out what exactly was in it - mystery can be good! I made one change, since I didn't have a Jalapeno I used 1 chipolte pepper in adobe sauce instead.

We have made this many times- While a little too spicy for some of our friends, this is definitely our favorite potato salad.

Definitely over-rated. Made it for a barbecue...threw most of it out. Tasted good, but no homerun.

Made this for our Memorial Day cookout, because my husband and two of our guests HATE mayo-based potato salads. I doubled the recipe, even though we had only eight people at the party. NO LEFTOVERS! Everyone was clamoring for the recipe. Definitely a "keeper."

The jicama and hominy threw me off at first but the combination with the jalapeno dressing was fantastic. My husband, Jeff, kept going back for seconds...thirds. I think this could make 8 servings, not 6, and 1 large jalapeno gives it just the right intensity of heat.
