Really decadent. I used Ghirardelli 60% cocoa chips rather than mini chocolate chips. The orange zest adds a luxurious layer of flavor. Moist and flavorful grown up cupcakes - kids won't appreciate.

They suck. Dry, bland, quantity is off - save yourself the time and just pick something else.

This recipe was the perfect yield for my six-mini-bundt pan. I added about an 1/8 cup of O.J. and a tablespoon of Canola oil to the batter before adding the flour and milk so the cakes would gain more moisture and flavor. Rather than make the frosting, I sifted some cocoa powder and sugar over the cakes. What a perfect treat to bake for my neighbor who graciously cleared the snow from our driveway yesterday.

I've made these a couple times.. the flavor is always consistenly perfect but I've had varying results with the dryness. This time they came out a little dry. As others have said, perhaps another quarter cup of milk would do the trick. I prefer them with regular sized chocolate chips as you get more of a contrast with the flavors. It's also important to only use the outermost layer of the orange while grating as the inner zest is bitter. Oh, and I got 12 perfectly sized cupcakes from this recipe.

These were easy and very tasty. Everyone loved them and several commented how much the cupcakes tasted like a Terry's Chocolate Orange.

These were delicious, but as other reviewers have noted, did not quite make 12 cupcakes (or at least not 12 regular sized cupcakes). Probably would have made 11 nice sized cupcakes. They did seem a little dense, would have liked them fluffier. Frosting was delicious - I let it cool to a nice thickness in the refrigerator while the cupcakes cooled.

I made this recipe with substituting the cream with half and half. I also think that I may have skimped a little on the milk because I just sort of sloshed it in instead of measuring it out so they are slightly dry, but that is my only complaint. They taste very good and make a very nice tea-time snack or dessert.

I made these for a party and they were a hit! Everyone loved them...I did cut the butter down a bit though. This recipe is definitely a keeper...very gourmet.

I loved it my kids thought it was great. But next time I will add a little more milk. The down side was that it took a while but it was worth it.

As other reviewers have noted, this turned out a little dry and there weren't many cakes. However, I found a recipe that's very similar, but with slight modifications that makes a lot more cupcakes and is moister. Use 1 stick butter, 2 eggs, zest from 2 oranges, 1/3 cup buttermilk, and 1/4 fresh squeezed orange juice.

This is just a review of the cake--I made a different frosting. It was good but nothing really special.

Cupcakes turned out dry and weakly flavored. Frosting very thin. Didn't even bring them to a party as I'd planned to.

I made these for my twin granddaughters' first birthday. They were a big hit. Since I keep grated orange rind in a jar in the freezer, I wasn't sure how much to use, so tried 5 tsp. The cupcakes were light and very flavorful. I used Nutella for the frosting--delicious! This recipe is a keeper for sure!

Not sure why, but these failed to rise so turned out no bigger than oversized quarters. I did one and a half times the recipe--possibly that was the problem?

We turned it into a little loaf cake and didn't do the frosting. Best thing I've eaten all week. Yum!

I used orange liqueur instead of vanilla extract, and this really improved the overall flavor. Also, I doubled the batter recipe to make 12 large, puffy cupcakes, and omitted the ganache frosting altogether, substituting 200 grams of *gourmet* baking chocolate, chopped into chunks, instead of regular chocolate chips for the batter.

Great mix or orange and chocolate. Recipe only made 9 cupcakes, but they were nice an peaked.

These are delicious! We also followed previous suggestions and used buttermilk and a mandarin orange. They are VERY tasty, but you should only fill 9 or 10 muffin cups or they don't puff up enough.

THESE CUPCAKES ARE WONDERFUL!!! I took the suggestions of another chef and only added 1.5 tsps of orange zest and substituted buttermilk. These are light and airy, and my friend compared them to a fluffy orange milano cookie. YOU HAVE TO TRY THESE. I only got 7 from the recipe so I cut the ganache proportions in half. I will be making these regularly.

Some observations and modifications will make these outstanding cupcakes. Makes 12 standard cupcakes. To have batter rise above cup only make 11. Substitute ½ cup buttermilk for whole milk. Beat well to fluff up batter. Orange zest 1 ½ to 2 tsp only. This is plenty of zest and compliments the chocolate without overwhelming the taste. Adjust cooking time to 15 to 18 minutes. A keeper.

The cupcakes were kind of measly. They weren't all that flavorful. I ended up eating the frosting (after refrigerating it overnight and throwing away the cupcakes. If a dessert isn't completely delicious, why bother?

Rating: 4
In a word, DELICIOUS! As suggested by another reviewer, I used mandarin orange zest which really pumped up the flavour. I also used regular sized chips. I made 12, they were small, not quite reaching the tops of the paper cups, so I made extra ganache and filled the cups to their rims. Very rich, very good, a treat for company. Heck, good anytime. And so easy.

TERRIFIC!! This recipe is a definite keeper. I used buttermilk instead of milk. I adore the orange chocolate flavor combination. If you're not fond of ganache (like Bethesda), maybe try another frosting more to your liking but DO try the cupcakes (personally, I liked the ganache). As far as you, NY, I recognize your response. Have you not given the same review to many recipes on this site? Fortunately, your review didn't sway me. These are nothing short of excellent.

I haven't baked in years, but these sounded so good I decided to try making them. They are delicious and I will definitely make them again. The orange and chocolate flavors go so well together.

We thought these were very good - nice texture and moistness. We thought the orange zest a little overpowering though. Next time I will omit the orange and just go for the vanilla flavor with the chocolate chips. I didn't use the ganache icing, but opted instead for a favorite chocolate glaze that has a little cinnamon in it. I was able to get exactly 12 cupcakes. They weren't huge, but filled the cups nicely, leaving just enough room for the glaze.

I wanted to like these, but after the first day, they seemed very dry. Maybe it was because I used skim milk instead of the whole milk?? The frosting was very good (although I had too much left over).

Rating: 3
The muffins were good, but couldn't really taste the orange zest. Maybe use more next time. Also, the frosting overpowered the taste of the muffins. I only put it on some of them. I think if I made them again, I would skip the frosting. Especially if you're trying to be semi-healthy

These cupcakes are the absolute best I've ever made. And I'm an avid baker! :) As suggested by previous reviews, I doubled the recipe and made about 13 or 14 big cupcakes. They were moist, delicate and the orange was refreshing.

We liked these so much, I made them again a few days later! I suspect that anyone who found the ganache to be "too thin" did not make it properly. I always wonder about people who will dismiss a recipe as terrible, rather than have the ingenuity to simply try using less cream (more chocolate) until the ganache seems right. Why so much negativity about a cupcake? I'll try the mandarin orange zest next!

Try using Mandarine Orange zest if you can find the oranges. It makes it just a little bit sweeter and pushes the flavor over the top.

These cupcakes were absolutely divine!! I purposely did not store them in an air-tight container and they still remained moist for a week. The flavours were perfectly combined. A must keep recipe!

Made these last week and ate the last one two days later--it was still very tasty. Moist cakes, delicious combination of flavors, and the ganache really makes the cake, so to speak! Will definitely make these again.

Already fans of the chocolate-orange combo, we loved these tender cupcakes. Based on previous reviewers, I divided the batter among 11 muffin cups rather than 12. They were a small but adequate size considering the richness. At first I thought the ganache frosting might overpower the delicate cakes, but it was perfect!

My sister-in-law made these the other day and they were outstanding. I immediately logged on and found the recipe so I could make them. Not sure what the dissenters problems are. If the cupcakes were any bigger you'd stuff yourself. And the taste? Perfect!

The marriage of chocolate and orange proves its strength once again: These cupcakes were very delicious and easy to make. A perfect dozen they were! I applaud the frosting recipe too because of its simplicity and taste: I didn't want to spend the time making the frosting and thankfully this recipe proved to be satisfying for both the cupcakes and my taste buds.

This is a great recipe. It's easy to make, and is a dessert in and of itself -- would be amazing served with an orange sorbet. My co-workers and husband gave these a "10". The cake is moist and very decadent, especially topped with the frosting. I divided the batter into 12 cupcakes, which were a perfect size, as they are really rich. The ganache cools to sort of a 'shell' (within a few hours) when it is spread on the cupcakes when it is warm -- very yummy. Goes in the recipe file for sure!

This recipe has obviously no been tested because the cup cakes were small and dinky. I suggest doubling the recipe. Frosting could be more interesting also. There are plenty of great cup cakes recipes out there. Try another one.

i LOVED these cupcakes!! they were delicious and a big hit with everyone who tasted them! a comment to the last reviewer: These caupcakes are amazing. Perhaps you are not the most amazing cook? sorry, but look at the last reviews! high praise right down the line. Maybe... it's ... o i don't know... YOUR PROBLEM?

this recipe has nothing going for it. the cupcakes are tasteless, too small , and the icing is too thin and tastes just like what is is: chocolate chips with a little cream to water it down. although the cupcakes can be baked in larger cups, the recipe is pedestrian. you're better off using a favorite cake recipe instead.

This recipe is easy and goes together quickly. I felt the cake was tender, but rather ordinary tasting. The chocolate ganache topping was excellent. This is a recipe which may be improved by substituting your favorite cake recipe adding the orange zest and chocolate chips.

This recipe was delicious! Very, very easy and quite a crowd pleaser for young and old alike. I didn't, however, make the chocolate frosting. It sounded too thin so instead I made the chocolate cream cheese frosting from Epicurious and loaded it on. Fabulous combination!

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was very fast to do and didn't require a vast array of ingredients. Really, just things probably most people already have in their kitchens. The cupcakes themselves are quite tasty, have a lovely texture and pleasing colour. Delicate orange flavor is nice compliment to the chocolate. As a matter of curiosity, the next time I make this recipe, I would like to try using orange extract rather than vanilla. The only "flaw" I can comment on is that the cupcakes were a bit too small for my taste and only made 9.
