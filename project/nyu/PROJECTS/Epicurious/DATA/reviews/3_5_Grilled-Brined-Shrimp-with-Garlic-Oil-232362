this is a great recipe! A few small "adjustments" - I shelled the shrimp and didn't bother with the ice water part, also did not use as much oil as this calls for so the dish was a little bit lighter. Just wonderful!! I will use the brine everytime I cook shrimp. They were so tender.

Great flavor. We soaked them in the brine for a full hour, and really enjoyed that flavor (used half the water called for). Peeled shrimp and dipped in olive oil/garlic before grilling. This worked well. The brine creates a good base recipe for future variations, which will include spices.

I brined the shrimp as directed, but then shelled and marinated them in olive oil, minced garlic, a splash of white wine and some hot pepper flakes while the grill was heating. Served over wild rice with roasted baby carrots. Wildly wonderful!

I was excited about this recipe after reading the reviews, but thought the result was unusually bland. I wouldn't make it again.

This is the best grilled shrimp EVER! Everyone kept going back for more. We did peel the shrimp before cooking and they turned out moist and delicious. We're making it again a week later because it's so flipping good!

Sometimes simple dishes are the best, as is this one. Grilled on an indoor George Foreman grill and was very good. I'm sure a "real" grill would impart a great smoky flavor, which would make it even better. I found that the shrimp were easy to peel when hot, easy to peel after they were chilled in the refrigerator overnight, a real pain in the neck when they had only cooled slightly. I think I actually liked them chilled best... I left them overnight with the garlic oil, the lemon, and the bay leaves. Even more flavorful. Think they would be very good served chilled on bibb lettuce with artichoke hearts or hearts of palm, some other veggies, and a lemon "vinagrette." Think I'll try that next time.

The flavor of this dish was wonderful. The brining was easy. The peeling shrimp after they were grilled and greasy was BAD. The shells stuck to the shrimp and then your hands were a mess. I recommend peeling prior to grilling. I would make again, without shells.

Made these as a starter for a cookout tonite. Didn't make the garlic oil but served with cilantro/lime tartar sauce (from here). A definite hit!

You don't need to heat ice water, just use tap water. We add a wee bit more salt to the boil mix and and a cup of ice cubes to the 7 cups of cold water. That way it chills down fast again when mixed, the shrimp stay firm and the brine stays essentially the same when the ice melts. A couple of good shakes of Cholula kicks up the brine too!

Very tasty and quick. However, I didn't follow the part about heating ice water to dissolve the salt. No point in wasting time.

To answer the cook in VT. Shrimp needs to stay very cold as it can spoil quickly. The recipe only calls for 1 cup of water to be heated, which when added to the ice water will not over heat it and spoil your shrimp.

This has become a summertime favorite for our family & neighbors! The bay leaves lend a subtle flavor which blends well with the lemon & wine...be sure to use a great white so that you can finish the bottle with friends while the grill heats up...

Would someone please explain why this brine starts with ice water which then needs to be heated over high heat--surely salt will dissolve in water at room temperature.

This recipe is so simple. We loved it. I used some of the garlic olive oil mixture on the bread before I grilled it and this gave the bread great flavor.

Unbelievably easy AND equally delicious... Didn't bother with the bbq, just used a non-stick grill pan on the cooktop. Served some oven-dried tomatoes and steamed artichokes on the side - Wow!
