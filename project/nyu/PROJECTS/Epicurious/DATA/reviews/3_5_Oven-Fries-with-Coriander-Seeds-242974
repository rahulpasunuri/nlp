No go on this recipe. Followed the recipe exactly but the cracked oriander seeds gave the potatoes a taste we didn't care for at all.

Very tasty, and easy too. I put all in a large baggie and in to the fridge in the morning, then baked for dinner that night per directions. Did not understand how to crack coriander seeds, but found a great tip which is: use your garlic press. Worked great, and yes, do be sure to use the coriander seeds - cracked - as it gives a nice, subtle flavor.

The cracked coriander seeds are excellent! They are essential to the recipe otherwise it's just plain 'ol baked oven fries. Unlike other recipes that state they are "quick & easy" this one really is.

This is a great recipe. It's tastier than plain baked potatoes but obviously not nearly as greasy as fried. The two teenage boys in the house gobbled them up, and they usually reject the plain baked potatoes I often serve.

I have to admit I'm not a huge fan of "healthy version" cooking - when I want to eat healthy, I'll eat something helthy - like a salad. But when I want French Fries, I eat French Fries! That being said, I'm kind of scared of deep frying. (And I don't have any giant pots.) So I figured I'd give the baked fries thing a shot, and... they're wicked good! Plus, I used a little extra olive oil, so they probably weren't exactly good for me anyway.
