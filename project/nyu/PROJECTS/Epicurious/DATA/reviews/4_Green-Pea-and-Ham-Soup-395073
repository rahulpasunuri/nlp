This is the worst recipe I have ever cooked from this site. And that is saying something, as I cook almost exclusively with epicurious recipes. I've made gallons of split pea soup in my life, but always with the leftover bone from a spiral cut ham. This was my first time cooking with smoked ham hocks. I was intrigued -- they've been a main ingredient in a lot of hip recipes lately. But in reality, they look foul, smell foul, and created a foul tasting soup. Also, it was not an inexpensive venture for pea soup -- by the time I bought the ham hocks, then the extra ham to dice into the soup because the meat off the ham hocks was not something I would have served my dog -- plus everything else that went into the soup, it would have been cheaper starting off with a meaty ham bone from Honey Ham. Maybe that would have made a better soup. Probably. I don't know. This was inedible. And I think I might be scarred from how disgusting the ham hocks are -- skin, fat and bone. And this is coming from a serious pork lover. I'm going back to my regular, old split pea soup recipe that never disappoints. I'm sorry I cheated on it in the first place.

I'm not sure how this recipe only has an 80%...It is AMAZING. Seriously, one of the best soups I have ever eaten. The hit of creme fraiche and olive oil when it's served is magic. We will definitely make this whenever we have a ham in the future.

Very good. The broth is heavenly. I waited until the end to see if the finished soup needed salt, and it didn't. Otherwise, I made the recipe as written, with the addition of a crouton from a baguette. It is delicious, but a little sweet for my taste. I think in the future I'd use the broth, but try split peas instead. Adding a large crouton was a nice addition.

crazy good. after you make the stock, it takes no time at all.

This was so delicious. My husband usually turns his nose up at anything pea-related but he raved about this soup. Rather than splitting up the broth to reserve later, I cooked it down to the desired amount which made it richer tasting. I sprinkled sauteed pancetta pieces over it also. Big hit. Big.

Delicious, used 16oz dried, split peas and simmered for 2 hours. So good. Topped with julienned prosciutto and thinned out with a bit of cream and whole milk.

This recipe is way too delicious for words. I messed up and accidentally put too much broth in the soup, but added more peas and mint and it was just fine. I used sour cream instead of creme fraiche, but it still tasted like heaven. This is nothing like that stale, old, split pea soup recipe. This is bright, full of delicate flavors, and amazing. Make it!
