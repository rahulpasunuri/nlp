Delicious - I tried the method of oven-baking the shrimp the last few minutes the toasts were in the oven, and also pan-frying as called for in the recipe. The pan fried looked better, browner; and it took longer in the oven than I expected, maybe 6 min. I think I would stick with the recipe but I was hoping the oven version would work because it would be easier. I was planning to serve these as hors d'oeuvres but I think they're a little awkward to eat as a finger food; better as a plated appetizer.

I used one shrimp per toast and garnished with chopped fennel fronds instead of capers. Took as a appetizer to a dinner party. Everyone loved them. The rouille was delicious. Can't wait to try it with crabcakes.

Great recipe, simple to make. Prefer it to be made with home made mayonnaise w hich we did and it came out more flavorful. Served up as an amuse bouche on Christmas day. enjoy!

Easy and delish! I also only used one shrimp per toast, which was plenty for an h-d. It kind of lacks in presentation, but the addition of capers helps it along.

This was such a hit with my guests They just gobbled them up. The left over sauce will be great with crab cakes too. I look forward to serving this many more times!

Made this twice to bring to parties. I prepped everthing in advance. Found that to simplify preparation in a crowded kitchen, cook toasts as described but for about 7-8 minutes, then distribute the shrimp on the toasts and bake a few minutes longer just until shrimp is done. Excellent reviews from the guests - Everyone was in line to be sure they didn't get left out!

grilled the shrimp and they were all eaten before they reached the toast!

I sliced the bread smaller and used only 1 shrimp per toast. Next time I may even slice the shrimp crosswise and se only 1/2 shrimp per toast. They were kind of bulky to eat and may work better with as a first course.

The rouille keeps well in the fridge and is delicious served with other fish if you have left-overs. We just used it to garnish saffron risotto with roasted cod. Delicious!

Great! The only thing I would change is to put 1 shrimp per toast, making it enough for 24 appetizer insteas of 12.

I made these Christmas Eve with fresh shrimp and was very disappointed in the flavor and presentation. My husband desribed the shrimp toasts as "gloppy."

My husband made these for Christmas Eve dinner appetizer and they were very good. One change - we would substitute a white French baguette next time for the sourdough, as we all agreed that the sourdough flavor overpowered the delicate saffron and pepper flavors a bit.

This was not very good. We made several apps for Christmas Eve and this was by far the worst. There was way too much mayo and made it very oily. The shrimp was good but would skip the mayo part and maybe use olive oil instead.

Skipped the capers and this was still easy and delicious!

Amazing! I wouldnt change a thing, the flavour of the saffron melding with the red peppars is fantastic.

Served this as one of the appetizers for Thanksgiving - it was the first thing to go! It is fairly spicy - not an issue for my family, but could be for yours.

Our dear friends were visiting us from Missouri and I wanted to have a special appetizer. This was it. Made the recipe just as is - we all agreed that this is definitely a keeper !!!

I made the sauce sans saffron and added smoked paprika. It was excellent, served the shrimp on rice and not toast. Crowd pleaser!
