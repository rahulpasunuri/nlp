The original recipe looked a bit bland but with tweaking it was great. I used vegetable broth instead of water. I also pared the broccoli stems and added to the potatoes while they cooked along with a bay leaf. I pureed that mixture, put it back in the pot and added broccoli, fresh parsley, parmesan and milk.

I agree this recipe needed tweaking. I sautéd leeks in a little butter, then added the cooked potatoes for a quick toss with the leeks. Did NOT add the garlic, but did use fresh chicken stock and half and half cream. Also, salted the water well for the potatoes before cooking. Puréed with a hand blender, then finished off with a pinch of nutmeg, freshly ground pepper, parmesan crisps - not croutons - and a sprinkle of flat leaf parsley. Delicious! I would make my version again, not the recipe given here.

Used chicken stock instead of water, as always w/ most soups to give it decent flavor. Otherwise, lackluster dish. Though, the croutons were good and easy, and would add them to salads in the future.

To Catelyn: I'm confused by your rating. You certainly hated the soup, but gave it 4 forks?

My boyfriend has never before flat-out refused anything I've made. I kept thinking I was forgetting something as I made this soup. There is absolutely something missing from the recipe. I would recommend subtracting water, adding chicken broth, milk, and a bit more cheese. Vegetables and water a soup do not make!

Not enough flavour. Definitely needs a chicken stock base instead of water. Way too watery as well. Use 4-5 cups of water. Quite easy though but not quite the comfort food I was looking for.

the concept is good. The recipe needs some help. As another review pointed out, use all stock. And I only used 5 cups. I used roasted garlic puree, because I keep it in stock. I threw in some leeks for extra flavor. I cooked all the veggies together in the stock, and then ran it through the food processor. I then added whipping cream, salt & pepper to taste, and served with the croutons. Incidentally, I probably used at least a cup of cheese - I just shredded and mixed all the bits and pieces I had accumulated. That worked!

I have never before had to order pizza after I finished making a meal. This soup was that bad.

Agree with other reviewers this one needs some adjustment unless you want a very watery flavorless soup. I used 1 can of chicken stock as part of the 7 cups of water - next time I'll use all stock. Pureed it in food processor as suggested and added 1 1/2 cups milk. Next time I'll use 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup cream. At the table we started adding salt, more parmesan and some finely shredded cheddar cheese to boost the flavor. The croutons were great. So with a little help this can be a great soup.

This is a very good, basic, comforting winter soup. I added a little milk ('cos I had some) and a little grated cheddar (ditto), and we enjoyed it very much -- even without the croutons.

Like the first reviewer, I too found this soup watery and mushy. However, I pureed it in the blender, returned it to the pot with 1-1/2 cups preheated milk, added a bit of lemon juice, and it made a pleasant cream of broccoli and potato soup.

This was a disappointment. It turned out watery and mushy. Maybe the kind of potatoes?

Quick, excellent first course or main luncheon soup.
