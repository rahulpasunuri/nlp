When made as is, all I tasted was Blue Cheese. I love Blue Cheese, but it would have been easier to just put a chunk out on a plate. After tasting the terrine I dumped it all in a bowl and mixed in 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom, cumin and black pepper. I also doubled the green onions and brandy. After mixing together I wrapped in plastic wrap to form a log and refrigerated overnight. When I unwrapped it I coated the log with more chopped spiced nuts and parsley and served with small toasts. It was a hit at our Thanksgiving party and I will make again with my substitutions.

One of the best I've tried. Everybody loved it. I will definitely make it again

I took this to two parties, one it was a flop and the other it was a hit. I suppose it depends on the blue cheese lovers in the crowd. I took a previous reviewers advice and reduced the amount of blue cheese. oh and I did freeze half and it was fine-in fact it was the one that was gobbled up!

Not having any blue cheese on hand, I made this recipe using Stilton (I followed the recipe for the rest) -- it was perfect. The next time around, I was pressed for time, so I shaped the cheese mixture into bite-sized balls and rolled them in the herbs and nuts combined. Again -- wow!

I had previously commented about this great appetizer, but I have one question did anyone try to freeze it for few weeks? Our Orthodox Christmas is on the 7th of Jan and I really want to do it ahead. Thank you

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and cut the amount of blue cheese, adding more cream cheese. The combinations of flavors was suberb! I have made it a couple of times, in different size pans and the presentation is always beautiful. A staple in my collection.

This was great! A couple of changes: it would have been better without the extra layer of plain blue cheese, and maybe even a little less in the cheese mixture. I will add about 1/4 cup more walnuts next time too. It is very big, so good for larger groups of people. We had a party of 6 and have 1/2 left over. Will definitely make again with those couple of changes.

I made this following the recipe, using Amish gorgonzola (it's not as sharp as domestic blue, but still reasonably priced) and it was a smash hit. I actually lent my recipe to someone who has not returned it, so I sought it out here to make again. The spiced walnuts provide a nice balance to the blue cheese and the presentation is great.

I followed other reviewers advice and cut back on the blue cheese and adjusted the others- and it was still very one-note, blue cheesy flavor. I think it could have used a fruity note. I divided the mixture into two smaller molds and plan on bringing one to a party this afternoon- I may add some dried cherries or apricots or something to the top to give the flavor more dimension. Sort of a disappointment

I used 8 oz blue cheese, 8 oz cream cheese, and 5 oz of feta cheese. It was delicious and beautiful. I served it with a whole wheat/walnut bread and it got rave reviews. Also used a small heart-shaped bowl for the mold instead of the 8X2 pan and that worked fine.

This was fantastic, I served it at a Christmas party last week and it went down so well. Everyone loved it, I made it exactly as the recipe said and will be definately making it again and again

Pretty good - a little overpowering on the blue cheese taste. This was one of many appetizers offered and was about half-eaten.

This has become a standard in my party repertoire! Everyone raves over it and asks for the recipe. I have adjusted the cheese quantity to 8 oz. cream cheese (lowfat works fine), 8 oz. blue cheese (I like Gorgonzola) and 5-1/2 oz. goat cheese, so the total amount of cheese is the same, but has a better balance for my tastes. I also add most of the chopped herbs to the processor after the cheeses are mixed, as it gives it a pretty, very pale green color and I like the flavor better. I make only two cheese layers with nuts in between. I have used both walnuts and pecans, either is great. I have a long, skinny loaf pan that makes a beautiful presentation, but I think any shape would work. The make-ahead factor puts this over the top in terms of a perfect combination of great taste and ease of serving on the day of the event.

I have made this a number of times over the last few years, and it is always spectacular in taste and in presentation. This past year, I used three mini-loaves and "spread the wealth".

Made exactly as recipe described, except substituted cream cheese for the goat cheese. Wonderful! Great combination of flavors. I would not reduce the amt of blue cheese as some suggest, guess I am a blue cheese lover.....

I made this for a party, and it was a big hit. Besides being great tasting, I love anything I can make ahead, so I can enjoy my guests! I made this exactly as the recipe read, and it turned out wonderfully.

Fabulous - reduced the amount of blue cheese by half and added more cream cheese. Large cocktail party - the group loved it. I made three smaller versions instead of one large one and replenished it. It looked pretty longer. Great looking and tasted fabulous. I was asked who catered the party.

I had trouble keeping the nuts out of my husbands' mouth before I could finish assembling this dish! We LOVED the complexity of flavors. I served it with a sliced french bread and a wonderful cheery walnut artisan loaf - this is really a wonder spread for any bread with a fruity base. I'll make this many more times. Oh, by the way - make sure the ingredients are at room temp AND you have a large food processor - I had no idea blue cheese and butter could burn out a food processor motor - and how stinky a burnt food processor motor is. (food processor is working fine, now, thankyou - no long term effects of too stiff cheese suffered)

Ive made this a few times ... with some adjustments. I dont care for the spiced nuts offered here, I make candied nuts and use them in stead and it seems to be a hit. I have also cut this recipe in half as it make a huge amount.

I LOVE blue cheese but found this to be way too pungent. So many flavors going on with the spiced nuts/brandy/blue cheese...I gave some to a fellow foodie and she agreed - it was too much. Great presentation though!

I made this for a wine & cheese party. I cannot say that my guests remarked much on it, but my husband and I liked it a lot. I didn't have th right size loaf pan so I ended up making it in 2 smaller batches. That worked very well because now I have one left over for Christmas. I know that it will be a hit at that dinner!

I read this recipe hastily and thought the pan size was 8x4 (standard size, right?) As I proceeded, I could not figure out how this would layer well in the big pan so I began improvising by increasing ingredients. It wasn't until after I served it on Thanksgiving when my sister asked for the recipe and I told her where to find it, that I learned politely from her, that the pan size was 8x2 ! Then it all made sense. The end result was yummy - definately a keeper

This was GREAT! My guests were actually "arguing" over the placement of the terrine platter! They all LOVED it!

My friend and I made this terrine for a potluck wedding. We are proud to say that our dish was the first one to have been completely devoured! It was gone even before the bride and groom had a chance to sample it! And so easy to make. It's going to be our standard party appetizer from now on.

Gee, although I haven't tried the recipe, it's interesting that only 1 person didn't like it. Maybe as one reads reviews they need to consider other factors (the ratings given by other raters). One can do anything with statistics! It really does look like a winner, and one I want to try!

What a beautiful appetizer! The flavor combination is fabulous, too. I didn't have a loaf pan of the size in the recipe, and used a small mixing bowl instead for the mold. It looked great, and people sliced themselves wedges. Leftover parsley sprigs dressed up the red lettuce leaves on the serving platter nicely.

I don't understand. This recipe got a number of 4-fork ratings but I found the taste of the blue cheese to be way too pungent. I really like blue, gorzonzola and goat cheeses but this was overpowering. The presentation was great. The texture contrast with the nuts was too. Not even a 1/4 of it was eaten and no one asked for the recipe. I won't this make again but if I did I would cut the blue cheese in half and up the cream cheese.

WOW! This was excellent! Everyone loved this terrine at this year's Thanksgiving. I made it exactly as the recipe stated, except I forgot to do the first layer of walnuts, and then remembered for the 2nd layer, but it didn't really matter. It was so pretty! I served it for cocktails with crackers. Everyone wanted to know what was in it! I am definitely making this again! This is great if you really want to make a great impression.

This recipe is excellent!!!We substituted pine nuts for the walnuts and is was wonderful. Everybody at the party loved it. What makes it appealing is the tartness of the cheese against the sweet spiciness of the nuts. A big winner!!
