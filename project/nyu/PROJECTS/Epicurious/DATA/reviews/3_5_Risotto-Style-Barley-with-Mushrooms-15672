Great recipe. I am allergic to rice, so this is a nice way to get my "risotto" fix.

This was really good! I substituted fresh shittake mushrooms for the portobellos and some of the buttons and did not add the tomato paste. Nice flavors.

Fantastic! Made it exactly as-is and wouldn't change a thing. It was great for dinner last night with a salad, and just as delightful for lunch again today. This is going into our regular rotation.

Loved this. I left out the tomato sauce as others mentioned.

Wow, this was good! I kept eating it out of the pan and was full by the time ut hit the table. One tip- use mushroom broth instead of chicken, adds more depth. Very filling yet not heavy like most risotto.

This was absolutely fabulous! Cooked the barley a little longer, as other reviewers recommended, and did not use the tomato sauce (overkill). Flavor was excellent! Will make this often. Nice dish for Fall, with beef or pork roast.

The flavor of this dish is very rich and satisfying. Probably would be better without the tomato paste unless you are looking for a pasta-dish taste. A keeper.

This was so wonderful. It was almost like a pasta dish with the tomato paste and parmesan. This will definetly be one of my regulars.

I thought this was excellent. I doubled the onion, used vegetable broth (replacing 3/4 cup with wine as suggested), and mistakenly purchased italian seasoned tomato paste instead of regular. Those were my only changes and we loved it. Very flavorful. I cooked it an extra ten minutes and the barley was a bit crunchy, but nothing that ruined the meal. We will definitely try it again.

Loved the flavor, but the barley was crunchy, and I cooked it at least 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for.

The barley was slightly under done, but the flavor was good. This is great as a side dish.

This easy recipe is so good and so tastey that my family didn't even know that it is GOOD FOR YOU! I even cheated and used button mushrooms from a jar. It was still the best thing on the dinner table.

Don't listen to the nay-sayers, this recipe is great, and easier than real risotto with arborio rice (healthier, too). Make sure you use flavorful stock and a little more onion than what is in the recipe. I also replaced 2/3 cup of the stock with white wine, that makes all the difference. For more color and texture, add some frozen peas at the end, just long enough for them to warm through.

there are better recipes out there.

This recipe is great. Barley has great texture, plus you don't have to watch it so carefully as you would arborrio rice risotto. If you can find it, try and use Porcini mushroom broth (many Italian importer stores sell it). Yum! I usually leave out the tomato paste, though.

Unfortunately I'd have to agree with the minority opinion this time. We love mushrooms and risotto, but this was bland it was monocromatic as far as color, texture and flavor. I would say it works OK as a side dish, but NOT as a vegetarian entree. IF I were to make this again, I'd try using the soaking liquid from some dried Porcini and keeping the onion & mushroom pieces sizable, to give a bit of variety in the texture. Overall, I think there must be better mushroom recipes on this site, so I'd refer you to them unless you want a simple mushroom side dish...

Tried this recipe (instead of potatoes/rice) for Canadian Thanksgiving along with the traditional dinner otherwise. It was a great hit and have been asked for the recipe. Enjoyed it more than other risottos as did the guests. Great one!

a very mediocre, bland dish. a waste of good portobello.

This is a fabulous recipe! The dish is hearty and satisfying and so delicious. Sometimes I add some shredded cooked chicken breast and it's a one-dish meal.

This just became a new staple at our house. I used a little white wine instead of water, no tomato paste, and guyeire (sp?) cheese instead of parmesan. Everyone loved it. And it was so easy.

Excellent dish, especially considering no butter or cream. I did add a little extra parmesian, but only a little.

This is excellent! Great flavor, creamy texture. I used only Portabello and Crimini mushrooms.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used all baby portobellos it was delicious and creamy. I shall certainly make it again.

This is a very rich, creamy and tasty side dish. I wish I had known it was such prior to preparing it with another rich and flavorful dish. But it is quite delicious - I made it without the gingerroot (because I did my shopping at the last minute. I also subsituted seasame oil, and added hot pepper flakes, salt and pepper.

Re-doing my review as I am unsure the former was sent. I liked this recipe. I tend to cook mushrooms in Olive oil or Canola with a dash of sesame or Mongolian Fire Oil, depending on the weather. (1/2 tsp. or crushed red pepper would add something I think. So would some black or white pepper... and a touch of salt.) No salt if you add (I DID!) of soy or Maggi (a German soylike soup addition but smokier) Adding some rice wine or balsamic vinegar would be another taste again. I usually add some to my mushroom creations. In cooking mushrooms (I use brown buttons or Portobellos) after having cooked the onion, with peppers, then the garlic, then the mushrooms ... then as the recipe suggests. Wonder how Chantrelles would be? This is a good and healthy soup for a cold and rainy day. What I most like about it is it's adaptabitly to other taste buds, be it chili's, sage, oregano or mustard -- My own pet perversion ... Herb (mustard) Senf, born in Frankfurt, Germany. Fore-doomed is all I can say!
