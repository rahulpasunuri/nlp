I found this to be bland. It needs some other seasons but it was quick and easy.

loved it. I made it for my 18 month old, but the entire family enjoyed it. Next time I would double the recipe!

This was ok-I like my own recipe better. And, I agree-the rice is better a day old. It does get points for being quick and easy, but we found it a bit bland.

Delicious! I used sesame oil.

Excellent recipe. I have to be careful with my blood sugar and make this with brown rice. It's excellent and very healthy. Also, you don't need anywhere near that much oil if you heat your pan properly. I use about 1 TBSP.

Easy and great tasting. Better than take-out. Cheaper too! My 16 year old ate it up too!

This has become a regular at our house. We usually skip the ham but LOVE the shrimp! Excellent dish.

Soo easy to make and tastes like it is from the neighborhood chinese take out. My kids don't like chinese food, but they gobble up this rice.

Excellent way to use up the cocktail shrimp and baked ham I had leftover from Easter dinner. I used frozen corn because I had no peas. Different texture than restaurant fried rice, but very tasty, quick and easy.

Try this trick: Use stale rice in this. That's right, day old rice, just like the big resturants do to get that consistency we all know and love. Try it and see. Also, use fresh peas. Stefano

I would have given this recipe 2 1/2 forks, but that wasn't an option and my husband loved it, so I went for 3. A little too salty for my taste, so be careful with the soy sauce. Also, the cornstarch stuck to my saucepan. Other than that, it really was quite good-personally, I almost liked it better cold.

Great recipe! Homemade fried rice is so much better than takeout! Next time would not use so much oil with the eggs, but did not affect the taste at all!
