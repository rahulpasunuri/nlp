I was a little disappointed...I thought it really lacked flavor. It might help to brine the chicken for a short time. The pesto was good, but I thought it needed more garlic. I might play with the recipe a bit to see how to improve on it.

Hmmm. I'll have to try the tarragon pesto. I've made sage pesto, and that also works out well on chicken. I simply took the Moosewood recipe for basil pesto, and substituted sage, which I had a lot of that year.

This was great for an easy, have the friends over for dinner weeknight meal. I doubled the pesto so there was plenty for the table and didn't worry about the lemons. I used ready-to-eat pistachios and didn't fuss about everything being perfect. It deserves four stars for an easy grill dish that is different and delicious enough for company.

This was SOOO easy and incredibly tasty. The pesto is excellent (I did add an extra garlic clove as we love our garlic!). The kids (4 and 2) cleaned their plates, too! Great recipe that will definitely be made again - although, the pesto was the star... we'll be making that even more frequently!

We didn't care for this....nothing exciting. I did like the pesto, but tahe chicken didn't absorb enough of the flavor and the lemons didn't add anything to the dish.

This is just O.k. The pesto was not as smooth as I would like and the taste was average.

I'm not overly interested in the correct naming semantics of pesto and so forth, but was this a terrific dish. The "pesto" was fantastic and pulls together what is a simple and effective recipe. Highly recommended for a night of light yet flavorful fare.

Pesto means paste, so i disagree and think you can be creative and easily substitute basil for another herb and pine nuts for another nut.

Not a lot of result for so much effort. It was ok; more blah and ordinary than one would have expected. Note of caution: do not add the lemon slices to the skewer; the lemon attacks the palate and totally overpowers everything. I will not make this recipe again

Made this delicious recipe the other night for my picky family. Both my daughter (13) and my husband loved it, and my husband isn't usually a pesto fan. I have a milk allergy and so I really enjoyed having a pesto without the cheese. I made the recipe as provided, but left out the lemons on the skewers this time. We loved the pesto and my only comment is to make more of it next time and use it for fish the next day or so.
