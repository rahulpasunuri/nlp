YUCK! The ingredients just did not work well together, and I'm a south'ner who loves jicama.

Very tasty salad. Great for spring bruncheons or summer bbq's. Thought that the ratio of watercress to orange,jicama,pimiento was to little. I ended up buying three bunches of watercress and still had orange, jicama, and pimiento mixture left over. The dressing compliments the sweet oranges very well with it's light spicey taste. It is quite a surprise.

This was a nice compliment to the Barbecued Chicken Pizza. Next time I may add crumbled Cotija cheese - it needed a little something salty I think.
