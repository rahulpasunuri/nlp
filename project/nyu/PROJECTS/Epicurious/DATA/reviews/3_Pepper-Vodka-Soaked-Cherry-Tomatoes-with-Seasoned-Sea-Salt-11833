This recipe was enticing on the page, but not so appetizing on the table. I felt like I was eating martini garnishes. The alcohol taste overwhelmed the sweetness of the tomatoes.

the tomatoes absorb lots more of the vodka if you blanch & peel them. AND a serving suggestion: put them on ice in a bowl!

I thought this was a little blah, but my friends absolutely LOVED it! I used grape tomatoes and pierced them all the way through about 3 times. Recommend marinating overnight if you can (I only did 2 hours)and using more (a cup)of the vodka, just to get them thoroughly soaked. Instead of lemon pepper, I mixed the sea salt with Trader Joe's 21-Seasoning Salute mix (non salt). The recipe is super-easy and kind of cool and I would definitely make it again.

I thought these were really delicious, and so did my husband. They were so much easier to make than similar recipes on this site that called for peeling the tomatoes. I didn't have lemon pepper so I grated some lemon zest and added it with black pepper for the seasoned salt. Also, didn't have pepper vodka, so I used regular and squeezed a bit of lemon juice over them just before serving. Changes didn't affect the outcome, they were quite tasty.

Pepper vodka was impossible to find - they didn't even have it at Bevmo - I made my own by halving 3 serano chilies lenghtwise (keep the seeds in!)and throwing them in the vodka with the tomaotos I'd pierced with a toothpick all the way through 3 times. I let it marinate in a glass bowl for a day and a half. These were the absolute hit of the party. Amazing flavor, interactive fun. A fabulous hors d'oeuvre!

used grape tomatoes, and they were good, but not something that people ate at my christmas party, I wouldn't make these again.

I love this recipe. I take a few extra minutes to take a toothpick and going in through the stem end, loosen up the seeds, then use a food syringe and "inject" the vodka into the tomatoes. Makes it just that much better...Yum.

This was a big hit at my party! Everybody wanted the recipe; and based on someone else's advice on the recipe, I marinated them overnight! Big Success!

I also used grape tomatoes, but I cut a very shallow diagonal slit in each. I marinated the tomatoes in the vodka overnight. I served with cajun seasoning as one dipper, and with kosher salt and balsamic vinegar as the other. These were the hit of the party.

Recently served these at a cocktail party--they were by far the easiest hors d'ouvres to make, and they were the biggest hit. Especially with guys. I couldn't get my hands on pepper vodka that day, so instead I used regular vodka and added red pepper flakes and chili oil. Worked like a charm.

My guests loved this!! They were like little Bloody Mary's on a stick. I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry, though (easier to get into your mouth) and table salt instead of sea salt. One word of caution...if you use table salt, change the mix to one part salt to THREE parts lemon pepper. Otherwise it's way too salty.

I made this dish awhile back, probabaly in 94, when this recipe first came out. My first impression was "Ooh! I can really taste the vodka!" But that was when I didn't drink alcohol at all. I would make this dish again, because it looked really pretty and I may find something new in it!
