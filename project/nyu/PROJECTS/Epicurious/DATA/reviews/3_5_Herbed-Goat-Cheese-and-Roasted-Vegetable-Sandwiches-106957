Super delicious and easy! the goat cheese with the herbs is amazing and any left over veggies can be used for another meal!

I was excited to check out this recipe and quickly read the reviews. It caught my eye when I saw this recipe under the "dinner made simple" heading. Being a vegetarian with a job and a baby, I don't have time to read non related and insulting banter between strangers.

Very easy for a weeknight dinner. We loved the flavor. It's a keeper!

yummy simple sandwich. used ciabatta rolls, but next time i'll try sliced bread because the ciabatta was too thick and crusty - it made it difficult to taste the other ingredients. i also grilled the assembled sandwiches, and it would probably be better with sliced bread. didn't have a lemon, so i used lemon seasoning stuff, therefore no overpowering by the peel. and used arugula instead of spinach. the veggies and goat cheese were very tasty.

i thought that this recipe would have had a lot more flavor to it. The whole sandwich was overpowered with the lemon from the herbed goat cheese. maybe if you cut down on the amount of lemon it would be better.

Great sandwich, very yumnmy! Good mix of veggies....what's with the canada bashing?? This site is about FOOD and NOT politics. Get real people.

Great as a "traveling " sandwich, and easy to make. Go for the gusto and do the goat cheese. Yogurt wouldn't work for me on this one. And how did this recipe review become a place to show our patriotism? Food knows no boundaries.

A great recipe! I have made it several times and it is just the thing when I am short on time after work. If you want to make it a little more healthy, cut the goat cheese and make a yogurt dressing with garlic and cilantro.

Looks good but haven't tried it. I don't know how 16 grams of fat, 7 of them saturated, qualifies this sandwich as 'cooking for health'.
