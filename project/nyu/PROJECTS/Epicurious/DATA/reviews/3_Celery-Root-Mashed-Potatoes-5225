Very good mashed potatoes. The celery root makes the potatoes taste very fresh without revealing themselves. Good to make ahead and reheat.

Not my favorite, but I have to wonder if there celery root I got wasn't the freshest. It took over 45 minutes for the root to be tender, and even then I had to puree it separately as it was too fibrous to mash with the potatoes. The flavor was also very strong and almost bitter. I might try this again, but only if I find some nicer celery root.

This recipe was so easy and delicious! Now I know how restaurants make that delicious mash/puree that sauteed greens and meat are placed on--it's that good!!

Decent but boring. Not worth the extra effort of peeling and dealing with the celeraic.

Well, I like this recipe! I made it with the Port Tenderloin that was stuffed with mushrooms and leeks (in epicurious). It was a lovely meal, and I'll try the celery root mashed potatoes with lamb next time.

Not worth the additional cost of celery root which is high by me (at least in December.) They were smashed not mashed and not worthy of the rest our wonderful meal. They belong in a mountain lodge - where food always tastes better anyway even if it isn't.

Fabulous! I did make a few changes. I first boiled my potatoes whole and peeled them hot. Less water in the mix. Less potato wasted. Then while I'm mashing them (lazy-I use my mixer), I melt the butter in the same pan as I used to boil my potatoes. I sauteed the celery root (chopped fine) until done, added roasted garlic puree, and my potatoes. I used evaporated milk for a creamier result. I have also added fennel with the celery root for a really outstanding dish. Note: I buy garlic in bulk, roast it very slowly, (I peel mine first, I think it's easier, and toss with a bare minimum of olive oil, roast on a half sheet pan @ 275 for about an hour or until done) and then puree. It keeps in my frig. forever and we put it in everything!

I made this recipe in September of '98 for my husband and I and we really liked the flavor. It was the first time I made mashed potatoes with with anything in them besides garlic or horseradish. I have since made the recipe with celery root and blue cheese which is excellent. For Christmas Day, for comparison, I will be making the recipe with celery root and mascarpone.

At best, this was disappointing. The taste of the celeric was pervasive. It ruined otherwise good mashed potatoes.

These are the best, lightest, fluffiest, mashed potatoes ever. The celery root is subtle and delicious!! Left out the nutmeg!

Excellent recipe, an amazing jolt to straight mashed potatoes. For years, my seventeen-year-old daughter has balked and squawked whenever i've served them--and tonight she raved. This was my first time cooking with celery root, but definitely not the last. Give it a try!

The celery root adds unique flavor. Best mashed potatoes yet!

Add a few tablespoons of low fat cream cheese for extra creaminess. Wonderful taste! Great with the lamb chops with parsley/mustard bread crumbs, also from Epicurious.
