I'll tell you that I made this recipe with a prepared basil pesto instead of the basil leaves and it was a huge hit. Roast the tomatoes in halves, drizzled with olive oil and then assemble them on individual plates with the fresh mozzarella. Drizzle with the pesto and a little fresh ground pepper and it's great.

This is not so much a winter caprese as it is a summer caprese with roasted tomatoes. I would stick with the 2007 version...much better! If you do make it, be sure to use the soft mozzarella.
