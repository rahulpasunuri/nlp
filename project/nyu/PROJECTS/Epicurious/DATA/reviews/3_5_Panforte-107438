Great! Many raves including some who had panforte in Sienna & preferred this one (fresher, not too sweet, more flavor). To double it I did 2 separate bowls of dry ingredients & was glad to have another pair of hands to mix the hot honey in the second bowl before it hade a chance to cool & harden.

Luscious and delicious! It's a bit softer than what I have eaten in Italy, but great nonetheless. I made a few modifications to the recipe; for some photos of the final product and my version of the recipe, see http://apricosa.blogspot.com/2009/10/panforte-italian-strong-bread.html

I 've been making this recipe for at least 4 years. My first experience was in Italy when we walked into a shop ( Sienna)and they were offering tastings. I was completely hooked. This recipe is extremely easy to make but you definetely need either lemon or orange zest to give it that extra flavor. I also omitted the raisin and added more figs.Also added som dates. Great for Christmas

I used 1/2 c. cake flour and all purpose to make 2/3. I added 1/2 c. homemade candied orange peel. By accident I used 2Tbs. cocoa powder. The results were wonderful. I was very pleased. The key is to press ingredient well into the pan. After baking, cooling and removing from the springmold I weighted the panforte overnight. I dusted well with confectioners sugar. It makes a beautiful presentation and tastes wonderful. Balducci's move over.

Tip: spray the bottom of a metal one-cup measuring cup with Pam and use that to press the mixture uniformly into the baking pan. You can then press uniformly all the way to the edge.

While the general proportions of this recipe are about right (dried fruit, nuts, flour, honey, cocoa...), there are some oddities that stray quite far from authenticity. An ingredient in any authentic panforte recipe is candied citron, yet it's absent here (in fact, it's the only dried fruit in the original old-world recipes). I've also never seen prunes or raisins in a panforte recipe before, so that seemed strange. That said, I tried this recipe as written. Not bad, but just sort of... off. Add a teaspoon of grated orange zest for the citrus taste that is sorely missed (pairs wonderfully with the spices). Skip the prunes altogether-- their unctious sweetness overpowers the rustic depth of the figs. I suggest using all figs (a mix of mission and calimyrna adds complexity), or a mix of figs and dried apricots. Don't be afraid if it still looks a little wet after baking. If you bake until dry in the oven, it's going to be WAY too hard. And letting it 'age' for at least a week to maximize flavor is no joke; it really makes a big difference.

Wonderful taste!!! Gave it as a gift last year on a cake plate with the recipe. My boss and her family loved it and they are all 1st generation Italian I would not serve as normal cake slices - tiny chunks are the best.

Fantastic. I made this for my italian boss last year as a gift on a cake plate with the recipe. She and her family loved it. It is very heavy but so well worth it. Cut small bite size chunks and not cake slices

Mine was terrible. Granted, I used a 10" pan rather than a 9" and wax paper rather than parchment, but still. I love Italian cakes/cookies and had much better success with the brutti-bone cookies. I like to think it is the altitude here. I ended up throwing it out when a friend told me it was too scary too eat and she's Italian.

I've made this several times during the last holiday season. Everywhere I took it people asked for the recipe.

Very good recipe. To Caroline from Toronto: try to add freshly grated orange zest from 2 oranges and ~1/2 or 2/3 cup of candied orange peels and juice from one or two oranges to the caramel mixture. It gives very good orange "hint".

We let this cake age a 2 weeks before serving. Although I love traditional fruit cake, my husband does not. However, he loves this panforte. He sut it into bit size square to serve and they looked beautiful.

I used wax paper because I didn't have parchment, which was not a good substitution because it stuck terribly. The cake tasted good but was not remotely "cake-y," rather just sticky. The flavor does get more interesting after a week or so. It was hard to cut, so I just tear it apart, which doesn't make it look appetizing.

I made another version found in the gourmet data base chocolate hazelnut panforte. It took 2 tries to get it right as the fruit continues cooking after it comes out of the oven. I was trying to reproduce a panforte someone brought me from Florence - chewy, cakey, lots of nuts and a full orange flavor... i am still in search of that recipe.

This looks and smells wonderful. Would it be possible to prepare in smaller pans (without removable bottom)? It would be ideal to give to neighbors as a gift! OR would you suggest giving wedges cut from the large pan?

this is a better panforte recipe fro americamz with its good spice range and not-so-despised fruits. however, it would benefit from some citrus notes. while most dont appreciate the citron and orange peel from the original recipe, some orange ZEST wudnt hurt. also, panforte wont set well unless you have a little butter in the caramel mixture.

I've been making Panforte for many years for the Christmas holidays, but my old recipe calls for candied fruits (citron,lemon,orange)along with almonds and hazelnuts. It lasts 'forever' in the fridge,in fact we just finished some from last Christmas and it still was excellent.Did you know that the Crusaders carried Panforte with them on their travels? I will try making your version too.

I used a heavy duty spatula to put the dough in the perpared pan, but first I sprayed it with no-stick spray. That made what would have been a difficult task much easier. The cake looks lovley, and smells great. We're looking forward to eating it and giving it away too.

I had never had panforte. My Italian Christmas traditions revolve around fried fish and octopus in garlic sauce, but I think I'll add this to the table. It is easy and fun to make and, if you like dried fruits and nuts it is heavenly. I'll make one or two more to cut up include in my holiday gift baskets.
