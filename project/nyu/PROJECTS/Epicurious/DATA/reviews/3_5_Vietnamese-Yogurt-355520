I like this. As suggested, I use only half a can of SCM to 3 cups of yogurt. I can now make my favorite yogurt flavors at home: Coffee, 1/4 teaspoon instant coffee granules stirred into a serving; maple, 1/2 teaspoon maple syrup and a few drops of maple flavoring; lemon, some grated lemon rind is divine, but a few drops of lemon oil are very good and very quick; vanilla, 1/4 teaspoon extract in a serving. I had never been able to make these flavors to my liking at home. As for the leftover half can of milk: I found that it's very good in yeast bread. Using a standard 1-loaf white bread recipe calling for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of water, sub 1/4 cup SCM and about 3/4 cup water. The opened milk keeps pretty well in a plastic container in the fridge, so I have no trouble using it up in my weekly loaf of bread.

First of all, this makes a TON of yogurt. I would halve the recipe if serving to fewer than 10 people. Also, I only used half as much sweetened condensed milk as called for and it was plenty sweet. I like the tanginess. Served as a condiment to sticky rice with mango. Delicious.
