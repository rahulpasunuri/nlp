Loved them! However I made them both with and without soy sauce, and I much prefer them without the soy sauce in the filling. When done this way, the fresh ginger and scallions have an incredibly aromatic flavor. If you then just dip them in soy sauce to eat, you get the salty tang without having crumpled the flavors during cooking.

Quite tasty! I made the filling with half the vegetable oil suggested and pan-fried the dumplings until partially browned on one side, then threw a quarter cup of water on the pan and covered it to steam them the rest of the way. Dipped them in sauce made from soy sauce, rice vinegar, chili paste and a little sesame oil. Yum!

Really good dumpling recipe. It makes a pretty large batch so I froze some for later use (they held up very well in the freezer). I thought they turned out better with steaming instead of boiling - the wrapper has a better texture. Pan frying the leftovers was also delicious.

Clearly I am in the minority here, but I found the filling to be horrible. It has the constistency of mush. Texture is a big thing for me, but I realize it isn't for everyone. That said, I think I would drastically reduce the amount of vegetable oil called for. Three tablespoons seemed like way too much when I was making it; wish I'd followed my instincts and reduced it to one (or left it out entirely). Blech.

mmm mmm good! these taste like restaurant quality dumplings, i could not believe how tasty they are!! the only thing bad i can say about them, is that they are a bit tedious and time consuming, but very well worth it!

Quite disappointed with this recipe, but first the good news. It was easy, I had no problem with the wonton wrappers and did them up like little bundles -- lovely. Still, too salty (low sodium soy a must) and simply nothing special.

Agree with a prior poster who noted this is a great dish to prepare with family members. We also made these on New Years Eve, along with some other seafood dumplings, salmon rillete, served with champagne. Light and lovely meal! I used round wonton rolls, which folded perfectly. Just be sure not to overfill them; they'll collapse in the water. Added a tamarind sauce (from Jean George V's asian cooking book with only his name on the cover)...and a hot garlic sauce.

Made this to take to a New Years eve party. No one could believe they were not from the Costco (the groups entertaining food supplier of choice). My husband is still raving about them even after almost a week! Only problem I had was attempting to simmer the little devils. As I watched the first batch turn into mush, tears almost came to my eyes. Fortunately, the frying pan was close by! These are absolutely sinful when pan seared in just a touch of oil. The do take longer then 40 mins to prep and cook though. This has been added to my rotation of entertaining items.

amazing. i pre-cooked the shrimp and then mixed it all together and just wrapped it in rice paper instead. i just dipped the rice paper in the hot water, lay it down on a plate, added the filling and wrapped it up ready to eat.

This is fabulous. We made them as potstickers, but as fantastic as they were, I'm sure they are delicious boiled/poached as described in the recipe. We also added cilantro which can never hurt.

Absolutely amazing! Super easy and super delicious. I added chopped shitake mushrooms to the filling- not needed but wonderful. Great flavors. I added some garlic-chili paste as a dipper and it added a lovely spice.

What an easy recipe. Even my twenty year old had a blast making them with me. We used rice wrappers instead of traditional wonton wrappers because of my gluten intolerance. I boiled them first in plain water, but they were too bland. I then boiled them in chicken stock and served it as a soup. Although the rice wrappers somewhat came apart, the soup was delicious. My daughter had them pan fried and loved them. A new staple in my house.

These dumplings are absolutely delicious! I used an egg wash instead of water to seal the dumplings and had no problems. I made a dipping sauce with soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds, garlic, and ginger, its was divine! I got the asian mustard, but everyone preferred the soy sauce. I will definitely make these again!

My husband said these were some of the best dumplings he's ever had. I boiled them and had no trouble with them sticking together, although I had to be sure they didn't stick to the bottom of the pan. Next time, I'll add a bit more ginger. I made a sauce with soy sauce, garlic, ginger, scallions and a touch of water. I will definitely make these again.

These were very easy and very tasty. Time consuming to fill though and i had trouble keeping the edges closed. I used a bamboo steamer and lined it with lettuce leaves to prevent sticking. Dipping sauce: i mixed low sodium soy sauce, asian chili paste, sugar, water, minced ginger and a little minced garlic. Very good!!!

oh. I forgot to add that I fried them in canola oil instead of steaming or boiling them. worked out beautifully.

AMAZING! I just made these last night, and they are to die for and SO easy. I will make them again and again. You don't really need to measure everything out exactly. I make things off this site all the time, and these were the first ones that were SO GOOD I just had to let someone else know.

Correction: I used rice vinegar not rice wine.

I made these tonight for a friend's birthday celebration. I have never worked with wonton wrappers before and was a bit apprehensive. I started at 5:30pm and had to leave for the party by 7:15. The preparation definitely took me longer than 30 minutes, but then it was all new to me. I used frozen uncooked shrimp from Trader Joes, which I cooked first. Then I reread the recipe and wasn't sure if I was supposed to cook them first. Oh well. I used egg whites instead of water for the moistening, and steamed the dumplings for 5 minutes instead of boiling. Now I know why they are called "Pot Stickers"! As the first reviewer suggested, I mixed soy with rice wine for the dipping sause, and added a few dashes of hot chili oil. I did not do the mustard and it was not missed. Bottom line, they were delicious! I was worried that they needed to be served piping hot, but they were still good (some said better) at room temperature. I will make them again soon, and I won't change a thing that I did!

Quick, easy, and delicious. Assembling the dumplings is fast once you get the hang of it. Quality of the shrimp is important. Made once with fresh FL gulf pink shrimp and once with farmed, prev. frozen white shrimp. The latter was good, but nothing like the former, which was exceptional. I found straight reduced-sodium soy sauce too strong for the delicate dumplings, so used 1/2 rice vinegar (unseasoned) and 1/2 r-s soy sauce. Perfect dipping sauce along with the Chinese mustard.
