I hate to be in the minority here but we did not like this dish that much. I found the dressing for the slaw was bland before I added the veggies so I mixed in some oriental chili paste and added chopped cilantro to the cabbage mixture-it only improved things. I grilled the marinated mushrooms on the BBQ but my family found them strange tasting-the whole recipe just didn't appeal. I much prefer the way I usually make portobello burgers: I brush them with a little homemade Balsamic and olive oil vinaigrette and BBQ them. When they are tender I turn them gill side up and slather with sundried tomato pesto and top with a slice of fresh mozerella and a basil leaf. At the same time I grill horizontally sliced Italian rolls till toasty.When the cheese melts I place the portobello on the roll and top with baby arugula. Bellissima!!(I find portobellos to be much more Italian flavour friendly).

I only made the slaw and it was delicious! One of my six year olds loved it too. Will use this reciped for slaw made with green cabbage also.

The slaw is a wonderful, flavorful variation without too much fat--finely diced red peppers seem like they would be a nice additiion. The Portobellos were tasty, but probably needed a little more time under the broiler--they still had lots of moisture in them.

Very tasty. All my friends like portobellos and this made a nice change to our usual version. I made the slaw too only used regular green cabbage because It's what I had to hand. Still it was yummy.

So good! The slaw has a nice delicate flavor - the dressing is lighter than I expected. The combination worked extremely well. We will be making this frequently. The only thing I would change is that I think the marinade was a bit too salty. I will add more sherry and vinegar next time. Overall, this was so flavorful and not your typical portobello sandwich. Everyone who comes across this recipe should try it.

We love this recipe at my house, but be careful to not marinade for too long! They really absorb the flavor. If you're in a rush, skip the slaw and use goat cheese.

The slaw was good, but the dish as a whole didn't sell at our house.

Great dinner for weeknights. Fast, easy and very tasty. The cabbage slaw is a great side dish on its own, too.

This is so good! I have made it with low fat mayo and it still takes incredible!! If you want to cut down on meat, this is it, no one will complain! Also, you can now get the mushrooms at Costco, so, it is even economical!!!!

I've made this several times for vegetarian friends. For one friend, who's *really* dieting, I make it with nonfat mayo. It only saves a few calories, but she appreciates it! ;-)
