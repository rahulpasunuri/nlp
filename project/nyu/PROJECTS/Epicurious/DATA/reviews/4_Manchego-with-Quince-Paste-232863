I toasted some crusty bread, spread the quince paste, shaved the cheese on top and threw it in the oven just to melt the cheese a bit. So simple and a wildly great combination of flavors.

Great combination. Pungent and sweet. Love it.

This is such a wonderful combination. No, it's not a recipe, just a great suggestion.
