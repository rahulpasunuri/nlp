I just harvested asparagus from my garden and made this. What nice treat. I think some minced shallots would be great in here for a little more depth of flavor. I think the white balsamic is a good idea, I'll have to try that next time.

I was disappointed with this recipe. I followed the advice of some previous reviewers and blanched the asparagus first. I found the recipe to be a bit bland.

I really liked this recipe, however, shaving asparagus was a new thing for me and I had a hard time getting nice long shaves all the way through the middle of the stem. Large asparagus would definitely help. Presentation-wise, the simple twist is phenomenal - definitely wowed me!! it was so unique that when I think of an asparagus side dish, these come to mind, and I'm not one to really repeat recipes.

I haven't created this recipe yet, and I get that the shaved asparagus makes for a great presentation. But, what if you used chopped asparagus instead in 1" pieces, as other reviews suggest that the shaved version disappears and is so difficult to prepare?

Was worried that this wouldn't go over well with my mid-western crowd, but this salad quickly disappeared. Used white balsamic in lieu of the lemon juice, and after making it a second time with the juice, I prefer the vinegar.

Really wanted another recipe for the fat asparagus spears in the garden and I followed it exactly. A lot of work for not much flavor - could hardly taste the asparagus.

OK, but the raw asparagus was a little to grassy for my taste. I would recommend blanching the asparagus briefly.

Execlent recipe. Shaving the Asparagus can be a challenge but I just did it pressed to a cutting board. I don't have a mandolin. There are various ways to add your touch to this but expect positive results if you use this as a base.

I broke each stalk in half and shaved them against the broad Parmesan blade of my cheese grater. It was really fast and made for thin, even ribbons. I served this over warm du puy lentils in a red wine vinaigrette with finely chopped onion, which in turn were on a bed of rainbow couscous. It was a fabulous early summer main.

This was pretty good. I added in some cold leftover cheese tortelloni that I had left over from dinner last night to make it more of a main dish for lunch today. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to shave the asparagus. It takes forever.

I think there's a flaw in this delicious recipe. I made it 2 nights ago and once the lemon "cooks" the asparagus, 12 large asparagus will feed perhaps one person. I wound up using 30 spears and this was barely adequate for four people. The shaved asparagus shrinks dramatically as it sits in the dressing. It was, however. a great success and everyone asked for more which I wished I had - I would have liked more too!

This salad made my pee smell funny. Other than that it was great!

Interesting, but not worth the trouble. The texture of the asparagus was nice, and the flavors worked well together. The taste of the asparagus was remarkably milder than a roasted or steamed asparagus. However, shaving the asparagus stalks was a challenge (even when cut in half). For me, the end result was not so good that it justified the effort.

Made the mistake of making it as a main. Overpowering. Just too much asparagus. Would've made a better side dish. It's smooth and refreshing. Next time I make it i'll also cut the asparagus stalks in half after they're shaved. A bit too long to eat easily.

This was an outstanding side dish. It received rave reviews as an accompaniment to steak onglet. Great as-is, I still experimented by adding a dash of white balsamic vinegar to mine and it was also quite good. I will most definitely serve it again.

This wa excellent. Made this for Easter dinner with friends and it was a real hit. The vinaigrette was delicious and complemented the asparagus perfectly, although we added a bit more salt and pepper once the salad was plated. To shave the asparagus, I set each stalk on a cutting board and held the tip while running the peeler along the length of each stalk. The texture and consistency of the asparagus was lovely and, as mentioned in the recipe intro, quite silky. Will be making this often...great recipe and one that I recommend.
