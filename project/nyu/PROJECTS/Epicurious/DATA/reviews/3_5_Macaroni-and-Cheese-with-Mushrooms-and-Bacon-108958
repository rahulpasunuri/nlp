Very good, Everyone loves it....could be a little cheesier

I really enjoyed this recipe but also made a few changes and additions. Just mushrooms and bacon sounded a bit boring. I added a diced red pepper, tomato and reduced the amount of mushrooms to add color. Also after cooking the bacon I saved the bacon grease and used it with the bread crumbs in place of butter. The result turned out great! I am also interested in trying different combinations. I think replacing the parsley with cilantro and using ground beef would be really interesting.

I loved this, although I do think the proportions are a little wacky -- too much pasta, too much bacon. I think I went with about 12 oz. pasta and a mere five slices of bacon. Otherwise I followed directions, except that I added a pinch of cayenne for a little kick. I found it a lot creamier than many mac and cheese recipes, almost like cream of mushroom soup with a lot of extra cheese.

After reading the reviews, I made the following changes: used 1 1/2 cups milk and 1/2 cup half & half; used cheddar, swiss, colby and parmesan; used all the bacon, but chopped and added an orange pepper I needed to use; used shallot instead of onions and I did not cut up my mushrooms. Taking a hint from Julia Childs, I browned/crisped the mushrooms making them a much more assertive flavor/texture in the dish. I also did not use bread crumbs. I ground up a Ritz crackers and added them to the top. LOVE the outcome!!! Palo Alto - I live deep in farm country in a house surrounded by wheat fields 1 1/2 hours from Yellowstone.

Exceedingly rich and flavorful, and easy to prepare. Total crowd-pleaser. Would be nice as part of a summer potluck meal. Probably too rich for a main course, though.

I think this is a very good recipe especially if you want to make some substitutions. This is a very easy sauce to make and the flavors work very well together. The only thing I would suggest is that the amount of the sauce be increased a little. I also used some gruyere in place of half of the cheddar. Definitely something I'm going to do again.

I thought this was a very good recipe. As for the person (not sure cook would be appropriate term) from Palo Alto--it's now 2009, maybe you have grown in your attitude toward other parts of the country.

This recipe is fantastic! I make this dish and the "sausage stuffed mushrooms" (also from this site) at every family gathering. I brought this dish to a picnic and everyone loved it, even when it's cold!

To the cook in Palo Alto: How's that foot taste? This is actually pretty good. Comfort food should be bland, but the bacon and mushrooms (I used leftover chanterelles) add depth.

Turned out really well. Used tomatoes (fresh) instead of mushrooms.

This was good with the following modifications: no bacon; instead of 3 c. cheddar, I used 1 1/2 c. cheddar and 1 1/2 c. bleu cheese; I reduced mushrooms to 1/2 lb. and added about 1 1/2 c. frozen artichoke hearts (sauteed with the other vegetables); instead of onion, I used three scallions (another time, a leek); also about 1 tbsp. salt. If only the evening had turned out better for the Pats...

I was surprised that others were surprised about its blandness. Only 1/4 a teaspoon of pepper? Of course it's going to be bland! S&P should always be added to taste, not according to the recipe.

I liked it- didn't love it. I'll give another try and with some modifications-it has potential. I think I'll tone down the bacon next time. A little too fatty and too smoky for my taste. Perhaps it was the bacon I used. I had not been informed that the US had been divided into sections. I did not realize that people in Palo Alto are more evolved and sophisticated. As a simple "Middle Amercian" (whatever that means) I'm just going to pluck the chickens, slop the hogs and try not to drool on myself. And have a nice plate of mac and cheese at the end of the day!

This dish was very easy to make. It was also bland and nearly tasteless. I tried to make it again with modifications, to no avail. Used applewood bacon and shiitakes in hopes of livening it up but no dice.

This was fairly good but not great - the flavor of the base was a little bland and overpowered by the bacon. Touche to the cook from Michigan - funny review. Anyone who thinks mac and cheese is "middle america" has most likely only had the "kraft" version!

This was excellent, especially when the prior reviewers' instructions were followed. At first, I thought that since the rater from Palo Alto liked it, it might be a bit too hip and trendy, like "Tillamook" mac and cheese. I'm surprised she didn't use free range sushi with wasabi glaze to her bread crumbs.

My friend made this for me. She used Oroweat Country White bread for her crumbs. I don't like macaroni and cheese. It is very "middle America" and I think it's gross. But this was AMAZING.

Yum! Great!

Weeellll, I was in a hurry & didn't read the previous reviews before I made this receipe, so I guess I deserve the results - which were very unsatisfactory. I followed the recipe as written and was very disappointed - Way too dry and tasteless. I like the idea of adding mushroom and bacon flavors to mac & cheese, and may very well add them in the future...to another mac & cheese recipe. This one has twice as much pasta as should be used, and probably about 4 times the needed bread crumbs. Buyer beware!

My guests and I ate this up! After reading the reviews by others I made a couple modifications. I used less macaroni so it was not as dry. I used progresso breadcrumbs lightly on top and did not use onions. I would make this again!

I made this recipe last night with mixed reviews.. Ok...this is NOT your mom's mac & cheese.But it is tasty. I, too like a creamier version..I'll try increasing the sauce next time. The bacon and french bread crumbs were a nice treat, however.

My family liked this. It didn't seem there was enough sauce for 1 lb. of pasta. Actually, my husband preferred it that way, but my daughters and I would have liked it creamier. I often make homemade M&C on the stovetop (roux with cheese, pasta, and sometimes goodies), but I'd like to find a good baked version. This could be it, with slight tinkering with proportions. Bacon is nice touch; bigger pieces is good idea. I had only 4 slices on hand; 8 would not be too many. My kids nixed mushrooms and approved adding peas, which were also good. The main comment: more sauce.

Delicous and easy to make! I made it with corn pasta, because I am gluten-intolerant.

I tried this yesterday -- followed the recipe exactly as writte. Yuck! Atfer one taste no one in my family would eat another bite! The addition of mushrooms, in our opinion, did NOTHING to enhance this dish. We will not be making this one again.

I made this for new year's day lunch and served it with a romaine-mango-walnut-bleu cheese salad. I used large macaroni, and next time I would put bigger pieces of bacon. Everyone enjoyed it but the kids didn't care for it much --they have been ruined by Kraft apparently. Easy to make and it reheated well 2 days later.

This dish was really easy to make and tasted wonderful. It wasn't what I was expecting since this was my first time making homemade m&c but it was really yummy. I did make a couple changes just for health reasons. I used whole wheat pasta and 1% milk. I thought it turned out really well and just did it so it wouldn't be so high in calories. My husband RAVED about it and he had it gobbled up in 2 1/2 days! I would make this for company accompanied by a yummy soup...

While looking for a recipe I came across this one, and since I had some leftover mushrooms that needed to be used soon, I gave this a try. Really good! I'm afraid I was feeling holiday laziness and didn't want to dirty another pan to fry the bacon, so I used some leftover diced ham cubes instead. I think this could be a very versatile recipe, maybe using a blue cheese with the bacon or with gruyere cheese! The onions and mushrooms make this a nice change from plain old mac and cheese!

This was really good! Very easy and simple to make too.
