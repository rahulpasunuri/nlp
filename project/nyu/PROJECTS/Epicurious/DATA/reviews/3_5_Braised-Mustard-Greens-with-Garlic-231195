This was fast and delicious. You can vary the amount of garlic to suit your taste. I crushed it instead of chopping and it came out wonderfully.

I too used more garlic and chicken broth. Very fast to make, and very tasty!

This was delicious, I put in 2 cloves of garlic and next time I will use 4 cloves at least. Very easy.

Made this with chicken stock instead of water the second time I made this; really added a bit more flavor.

Quick, easy and got rave reviews from my husband - what more can you ask for?
