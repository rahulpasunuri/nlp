Yummy sauce! On it's own I don't think it's all that, but paired with the Coffee-Rubbed Cheeseburger and it was the perfect complement. Had just the right amount of spice and zip.

Basic and good.I used a pinch of chilli powder and a few freshly grounded black peppercorns instead of the adobe and ground cayenne because I think that too spicy and hot sauces kill any interesting flavours under them.Never mind the vegetarian comment about a miligram of anchovies in the Worchestershire sauce. Hey! This is a barbecue recipe!!!

Made with the burgers and followed recipe exactly. Perfect combo of all of the elements for a good BBQ sauce. The chilies really add something.

I made some adjustments to this aleady wonderful sauce and have found a staple in my fridge! I swap lemon juice for white vinegar and I add about 1 tlbs dijon mustard and a good squeeze of honey. I put this on everything from the burgers to pulled pork for sliders...the best!!

We truly enjoyed this bbq sauce. We used it on our ribs over the holiday and enjoyed the spicy-sweet combination (just the right amount of both for our tastes). Will definitely use this on our ribs and chicken often.

This is an excellent blend of sweet and savoury. I made this without the chipotle chilis and I love it! I'm not a huge Bar B Q sauce fan because I don't like ketchup, it's too sweet for my taste. Using organic ketchup helped.

I would just like to inform any vegetarians out there that Worcestershire sauce contains anchovies.

I was serving this to children and didn't want it to be too spicy, so after reading the reviews, I cut the amount of canned chipotle chili in half and omitted the cayenne. It was still scorching hot, so I added about a cup of purchased prepared mild (i.e., sweet) barbecue sauce. It toned the heat down, but the overall flavor still didn't wow me. I poured the mix over chicken and baked it in the oven. Everyone loved it, but I still won't go through the effort again -- I have better barbecue sauce recipes in my repertoire.

Amazing sauce. Only modifications were I used a little bacon fat instead of butter, and sauteed about a 1/4 cup of minced red onion before adding the garlic. Hard to tell if it made a difference, but what's not made better with a little bacon fat, right? Heat may be a little much for the faint of heart, so you might need to ease up on the cayenne. My only rap on this recipe is the batch is too small. You'll need to double or triple it if you plan on doing any serious barbecuing.

I thought this was a great sauce, not to sweet, just right. I added a bit more Chuipotle, as I thought it could a bit more heat..

A great sauce recipe that goes with the Coffee-Rubbed Cheeseburgers in the July 2009 issue of Bon Appetit. Be aware that this is a spicy sauce, so you may want to cut back on the cayenne.
