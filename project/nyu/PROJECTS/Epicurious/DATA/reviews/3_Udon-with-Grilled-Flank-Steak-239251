I thought this recipe was good. For all who thought it was too salty, I think using 3 TBS of fish sauce is too much. That could easily overpower a dish! The fish sauce that I use is "Tiparos" from Thailand. I would only use about 1 Tbs for the whole recipe. Also, keep in mind this is more like a soup than a "beef bowl". It is not supposed to be thick. :)

Liked the broth. A dash of chile made it even better. Everyone liked it.

After making it again, I have to decrease the rating ... using a better cut of meat and cooking it less didn't improve this dish. Sauce seems salty, flat and uninteresting.

Delicious BUT the suggested cooking time for the flank steak (5 min per side) is way too long, especially if you close the grill as suggested. I would do only 3 min per side if you really like medium-rare meat. The sauce was great, though, and kids and adults alike gobbled it up.

My whole family really loved this dish. I was initally worried that the ginger would be too strong for my kids. They said that it was terrific. Their only complaint (mine as well) was that they wanted more. I will have to double the recipe next time.

After all the good reviews, I expected something special. I didn't think it was that interesting. The steak was good, but the sauce was salty and lacking depth. I'm not sure if I'll make it again, but if I do, I'll add some chili peppers for some heat and maybe a little sesame oil to add some additional flavor to the sauce.

Excellent - Served at a family dinner with children aging 3 to 12 plus 6 adults (doubled the Udon and tripled the flank steak and the sauce/broth for this many) and ALL thought it was excellent

Oh and I've used Soba noodles before as a last minute replacement.

I cook 80 servings, and it works out fantastic... I sear the steaks and then bake them to the desired doneness (I cook 80 servings, so I have to cook some well done) also I steam the sugar snaps separately.

This is a great recipe. I was bummed that I couldn't find udon noodles anywhere, but we used garlic italian noodles instead and it turned out just fine. The peas are a great touch because having some crunch and color in there is essential.

Loved the sauce on the udon noodles. The meat was great too, but needed more salt. Not as quick as I had hoped, but still worth the time.

This is really great! I made it twice this week and rate this as one of the best ever. If this is all you are having for dinner, though, the recipe serves only 2 or 3 people. I let the steaks marinate for 1 hour because I had the time. The steaks were very well-flavored. I don't know if I could have achived the same effect with the suggested marinating time. In order to better manage the cooking times of the noodles and the sugar snap peas, I cooked the noodles until they were done properly, put them in the colander and then cooked the peas separately. I used the cilantro and it really enhances the dish--but you don't need as much as the recipe calls for. Also, I added the steak drippings to the sauce and that gave an additional layer of flavor.
