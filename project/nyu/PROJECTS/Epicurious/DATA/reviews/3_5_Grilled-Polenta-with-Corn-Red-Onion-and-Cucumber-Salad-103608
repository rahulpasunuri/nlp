Have not made the polenta - but the salad is great with grilled meats. Wonderful mix of flavors and spice. A staple on pour BBQ menus.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and thought the polenta itself was very bland, could have used more flavoring than just the parmesan cheese. The salad was good, but made way more than needed.

This was a delicious summer meal. I substituted two grilled yellow zucchini for two of the ears of corn and used Vidalia onions. I also liked the fact that the polenta was a low fat recipe. Most prepared polentas and many of the homemade versions are loaded with fat. My husband loved it too! This is a keeper.

I agree completely with the other reviewers that this dish is excellent. Not only does it taste wonderful but it looks gorgeous. I didn't have time to cool the polenta for 6 hours so I stuck it in the freezer while I grilled the veggies and it turned out fine. I had to use my broiler, since I don't have a grill, and that also worked well. Delicious!!

I discovered the corn salad part of this dish early this summer and have been making it ever since. I use either mint or cilantro and if I happen to have any, I grill any color pepper and add them to the salad as well. If you like spicy things, you could add some jalapeno too. This method of grilling corn is just great - I think it's easier than boiling.

Terrific weeknight meal. The weather was awful so I did this on the stove and used frozen sweet white corn, added a yellow bell pepper and sautéed with the red onion. I did not have any cucumbers so I omitted them. Used lemon instead of lime. Like a previous reviewer, I also used the ready made polenta which I threw in a grill pan on top of the stove as well. 30 minutes to the table and got rave reviews.

I added cooked beans for protein and a a little cliantro to the dressing. Great Stuff!
