Everyone loves these cookies. I make them for Thanksgiving. I use them as name cards for the place setting. Then I make more for Christmas. They are always a hit. The cooking time is definitely less than the time noted. They cook fast.

I love these cookies and they are now a staple in my holiday rotation. I too find that once you start working the dough they cook fast. I also don't get nearly 6 dozen cookies - but still a good amount. Everyone loves them!

Just made these tonight as Hanukkah cookies. Used 1/4 c brown sugar + 1/4 c real maple syrup, no flavoring. Cut using dreidel and star of David shapes and used blue and white sugar. They are yummy right out of the oven. I hope the frosting hardens enough to gently stack them for a party tomorrow!

These are a favorite at our church's annual holiday bazaar. I make plain and decorated - pipe them with royal icing (plain white) and sprinkle with sparkling sugar, just enough to cling to the icing. Easy and festive.

These cookies are exceptional made as is. I even baked mine for 12 minutes without any issues. My boss said to me, don't know why you are working here, when you should be baking and selling these. They freeze well too, even with the frosting...be mindful when defrosting though..keep in a single layer.

I rolled these thin and definitely needed to shorten the baking time to about 8 minutes per batch. To save time I thinned the icing and drizzled it over the cookies and skipped sparkling sugar. I also added some maple extract to the icing for a little extra maple boost.

Everyone I know loves this cookie! I have made it three years in a row and people ask me for the recipe every single year. I also use flavoring, not extract, so the flavor is not too overpowering at all. You definitely need to cut down the baking time; I tend to roll them out quite thinly, and I just love working with this dough. Everyone also loves the frosting, and I can't even believe how easy it all is to make. This year, I made the dough several days before I rolled them out and baked the cookies. Just as tasty. Definitely a holiday staple in my house!

These cookies are lovely. They taste good and are a very nice change from the traditional cut out cookies for the holidays. I also had to reduce the baking time to about 8-9 minutes. I also think I rolled the dough a bit thinner than the photograph shows. Will make again and again.

Had high hopes for this. Makes a nice dough that rolls and cuts easily. Cookies are hard, texture of a ginger snap, and just not that good. The frosting is too bland to stand up to the flavor of the cookie.

Beautiful cookies to look at but way too sweet. There are many better recipes than this for buttery cookies.

These are very good but quite time consuming to make. I used maple flavoring as opposed to extract as I didn't have any, and it was fine. The maple flavor was delicate and not too strong. I put the dough in the fridge overnight and it needed some time to return to a temperature which I could then roll it out. Watch the cookies carefully while baking as they turn from underbaked to burned very fast. I used colored sugar as that's what I had, and the blue sugar looked very nice with the white icing. I think in the future I may try to bake them as drop cookies in order to save time.

These were fabulous - the perfect cookie; everyone wanted the recipe. Will make these often.

These cookies were wonderful! Perfect for Christmas! Similar to the other entries, I had to significantly cut the baking time down. I think I only cooked each batch 8 minutes...instead of 12.

This has become our family's very favorite Christmas cookie -- its the only one that didn't make it until Christmas!

These are absolutely delicious cookies. I sprinkled them with maple sugar. I have already made 5 batches.

This is a nice variation to the tired and true sugar cookie. I'm with the other cooks -- watch the cooking time carefully, the cookie edges tended to burn when it went the full cooking time. I was a little wary of the maple extract but it added just the right "umph" to the recipe. Since I was traveling with these cookies, I decorated with royal icing because I wasn't sure if the recipe's icing would dry or not. I used silver decorating sugar, which added a nice festive touch.

i made these for a dessert party. everyone absolutely LOVED them. the maple flavor is not overwhelming - just right. i'd consider using these as my new, standard "sugar" cookie recipe.

These cookies are nice and simple to make and are quite good. My only issue is that they don't have a very strong maple flavour. I will make then again but will likely add at least another tsp. of maple extract, if hot two. Also, best to bake them on the shorter end of the spectrum to prevent them from getting too crisp. Keep your icing thick to get a nice white colour.

These cookies are a delicious change from the traditional cookies for Christmas. I recommend using the maple extract. Enjoy!
