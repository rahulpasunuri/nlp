Very easy and quick to prepare. I cooked it all in one skillet to serve 16 and accompany grilled Moroccan chicken. I recommend cooking in one saucepan for 2-4 diners. Either way, this minimizes cleanup and frees up a burner. I subbed currants for raisins and omitted the mint (the latter would have overpowered the dish, and the mint was already in the chicken marinade).

Great Recipe! A friend directed me to this recipe-- I made some changes: I used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian, currants instead of raisins and added pistachios and cashews... oh and i used Israeli couscous because I love it!

Liked it! Very close to something I've had before and was looking to recreate. I used a mixture of dried cranberries, raisins, and blueberries, which was delicious. I also added slivered toasted almonds and pine nuts - pistachio pieces would also go quite well, if you have any around. I also stirred in a bit of olive oil when I added the couscous to the chicken broth. The next time I make it, I'll stir some curry powder into the broth before adding the couscous (not quite enough as-is), then stir in some peas along with the couscous for color and flavor.

I change this a bit. Used currants instead of raisins and added some toasted pine nuts and green peas. Really came out delicious.

Easy & delicious, especially if you love curry. I prepared a beautiful roast leg of lamb, carved and served on a bed of this couscous dish. I substituted currants for the raisins (dried cranberries would work well too) accompanied by the Green Beans & Persimmons as a side dish. Just great!

A very good savory side dish. If you are a couscous lover, you will really like this version. It would be good on its own or as an acccompaniment to chicken or meat or grilled vegetables.
