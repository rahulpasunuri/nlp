Great recipe with revisions: like others, I made a nice paste out of mild red chile flakes, cinnamon, cardamom, chipotle, cumin, and garlic with olive oil and water. Smells really strong but flavor is just perfect and subdued in the end with the 3 cans of pumpkin, etc in this large pot of soup. The lime crema is amazing with the pepitas topping - totally brings the whole thing together.

From reading the mostly glowing reviews I was really disappointed. In fact, I found this recipe to be appallingly bad. It was a spicy gooey mess, with no flavor. I had to serve it because I had nothing else, embarrassing! Tons left over, threw it out. yuck!

I love this recipe as is, and I also change it. I add cumin and chipotle, as well as make it a cream soup instead of adding the crema later. Once of my favorite soups ever, and easy!

I add a little chili powder for an extra kick, but this soup is absolutely delicious. Great for when you're feeling a little under the weather or cold winter days.

I've been making this every year for about 10 years. My family would kill me if I didn't make it for Thanksgiving! It's very good. DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING! Okay, maybe add a little extra crushed red pepper!

This was very good. Like other reviewers, I made some changes: added cumin to the onions, added one sweet potato to thicken the soup, and topped with toasted almonds (didn't have pepitas) and sour cream. Will definitely make again.

This is perhaps my most frequently made recipe from Epicurious. I make it every year for Thanksgiving now. I've tried a few different variations: With fresh pumpkin and with canned (fresh is tasty but not essential). With chicken broth or with veggie broth to make it vegetarian-friendly (both ways are tasty). My husband and I tend to prefer our food quite spiced, so I tend to add various spices--whatever is on hand--plus increase the amount of red pepper flakes. My only warning is that I think the liquid ratios are off in this recipe. I use less broth or else find myself adding greater and greater quantities of pumpkin to make it as thick as I like it. I made the Mexican cream the first time but don't view it as essential, either--you can just allow guests to add a dollop of sour cream at their choice.

Subbed a chipotle for the pepper and pureed it with the rest. The lime cream is a must--next time will make sure my chicken broth doesn't contain cane sugar. Made it a wee bit sweet for me.

This soup is how we start Thanksgiving dinner evey year. However, I do make a few substitutions and additions. First of all, I never use canned pumpkin. After I sautee the onions I add cubed butternut or buttercup squash, and season it well with the red pepper, cumin, and a bit of cinnamon. Then I follow the recipe as written. Finally, I sautee the pepitas in a little bit of olive oil and a pinch of chile powder. Yummy! The contrast between the hot soup, the cream, and the spicy pumpkin seeds is irresistible.

This was really good. I found the spiciness just right - I would have liked a bit more, but more would have been too much for the less adventurous eaters in the house. I left out the milk because we had lots of other milky stuff in the meal, and it was still good.

This was probably the blandest, most uninteresting recipe I have ever made. I threw in almost anything I could find to add flavor, and still, I am almost embarrassed to serve it. So much for a memorable dinner for my guy - this recipe is all too forgettable!

I like to make this for the first course of Thanksgiving dinner. The spice and the texture wake up your tastebuds so you can really enjoy the rest of the meal! It has become a custom at our meal. I've found that 1/3 of this recipe makes about 5 quarts. I use 1 32 oz carton of broth when making 1/3 of the recipe. Since we have it only as a first course, 5 quarts will feed about 8 people. The only modification I make is to add a chopped fresh jalepeno (to 1/3 the recipe, so that would be 2 large if making the full amount). This year I'm going to try adding some chipotle chile powder with the pumpkin. I also like to simmer it down longer than 10 minutes so the flavor is more intense. This, and the fact that I usually re-heat it for dinner, means that I tend to start with it on the thin side, and not too spicy. Oh, and I invested in an immersion blender for this recipe since I make it every year. It doesn't blend as fine, but it's a heck of a lot easier than transferring lava pumpkin to the blender and back again!

Rating: 4
I make this every year for Halloween or during Thanksgiving. Everyone always asks for the recipe. It is great as is, but if you use really strong onions they can be overpowering. I also substitute 2 tbsp of ground cayenne pepper for the red pepper flakes. Make a day ahead, it tastes much better the next day. I also serve it with sweet cornbreak and the Mexican Cream is a must!!

Made this for a pumpkin and apple party, and it was a big hit. I will say I made a few variations, and judging on how perfectly spiced it was, I will have to say that I would never make it as written, as it would be WAY to bland. Here's what I did instead of the dried pepper flakes. Make a paste in the blender of 2-3 dried New Mexico Chilis (or other dried mild chili), some garlic, and 1/2 teas fresh ground or whole cumin seed, 1/2 teas dried chipotle powder, and a touch of water and oil. After onions have sautéed, sauté this mixture briefly in the pan with the onions to toast it and bring it alive. Then, proceed as usual. Also, only add 1/2 the chicken broth (and full strength at that)! I can't imagine adding all that broth and getting the same rich flavor. Remember, taste as you go, you can always add more. Also, I added a bit of maple syrup for sweetness and depth. Oh yea, and instead of all milk, I used ½ whole milk and ½ cup cream. Lastly, grate some lime zest into the lime crema. Perfect!!! Also, salt the toasted pepitas. Also, used the swirl serving technique mentioned in another review.

simply wonderful. made it today for canadian thanksgiving, sw theme. yumm. don't know why anyone could object to this one it's a keeper. didn't have pumpkins seeds but better, pepitas a mexican pumpkin seed condiment. placed some crema and pepitas on top, and did a little swirl. very elegant, super easy.

Have made this for several years now and am always asked for the recipe. It's expected at the annual pumpkin carving party as well as my Thanksgiving table. The Mexican cream and the pepitas are what make this soup special so don't skip those. To puree or not to puree is the only question. I've made it both ways and both are fantastic.

This soup was great. I made it for Christmas Eve and everyone loved it. I used pumpkin I had baked with olive oil, drained well and frozen. Since one reviewer said the lime couldn't be tasted, I used the juice of a large lime in the Mexican cream. I used half and half instead of the milk. I will definitely make this again!

We liked this soup although not an all-time favorite - not sure that the crema on the top added much especially since could not really taste the lime (and I put in extra). But the pepitas were a nice touch and it did need extra chicken broth.

I think this is a good basic recipe, and I will make it again. But I think that with these kinds of soups, a cook should add the liquid bit by bit, until you reach the consistency that you like, rather than adding it all at once. To the previous reviewer from Seattle: one idea for making the flavor stronger is to buy fresh pumpkin and roast it in a hot oven tossed with olive oil and salt until soft. Then use it to make the soup. Also, I added a couple cloves of garlic and a shallot to the onions at the beginning. Pumpkin soup is a delicate flavor and needs spicing up, but that depends on your taste and what you have in your spice cabinet. I used ginger and some indian spices (garam masala) and it was excellent. Served it with croutons. I know I've veered way off the original recipe, but thought I'd share my ideas nonetheless. Enjoy!

Rating: 1
I tried this after seeing so many high ratings, but I found it very unsatisfying. The onion completely overpowered any taste of pumpkin, and the crushed red peppers gave it some heat but no twang, and nothing that complements the pumpkin. I had to really adjust, go back and add more pumpkin, try cinammon, try a bit more cream and LOTS more salt - all kinds of things to get it to the stage where it was even interesting. Very pretty in the dish, especially with the swirl of cream from a squeeze bottle, and the pepitas were nice & gave it some crunch, but flavorwise, the soup is a real zero. I'm used to lots of salsa and can eat hot foods, so that wasn't a problem. amazed so many people think it's good.

Rating: 3
I chose this particular recipe because I wanted a pumpkin soup that didn't involve any extra sweeteners. I made a great choice! This recipe was a real winner, even without the mexican cream (which I will make next time!). I added a little sage with the red pepper flakes and cut the recipe down by two-thirds (one can of pumpkin), and it turned out wonderfully. It was great on its own, and adding some diced grilled chicken and a few walnuts to the top made it into a one dish meal. Delicious and VERY filling. One third of the recipe makes 3-4 generous servings.

This dish is a hot request every Thanksgiving, and is usually consumed down to the last spoonful, with family and friends scraping the bottom!

we made this for Halloween night before trick or treating. I served it in a big clean pumpkin for fun presentation. My kids (3, 5, and 6) loved it! my 3 yr old had it for lunch today & cleaned her bowl again! I added a tiny bit of dried basil to the soup and used half and half instead of whole milk (I got confused at the store). I put the crema in a squeeze bottle and made a spiderweb in everyone's bowl by squeezing a spiral and dragging a toothpick from the center outwards. The adults added scallops to their bowls. Next time I will try shrimp as the scallops were just not right but my husband would like something else in there! I make pumpkin soup every year for halloween & have never been really super happy with it. This is a definate keeper!

This soup was awesome. I have made pumpkin soup in the past and enjoyed it but this soup was super easy and delish... I made some adjustments to the recipe itself... I melted a whole stick of butter and added chopped celery (3 stalks) and carrots (4 ) and added the broth and used a pressure cooker to cook the vegetables together, I used a hand held mixer instead of a blender and then added the additional broth and milk and pumpkin. I made this for a soup party so I doubled the recipe. I added the hot pepper flakes at the end and omitted the pumpkin seeds since I used canned pumkin. I think the core of this recipe is Awesome and if you've cooked for some years you can basically alter it and make it your own!

We only made a third of the quantitiy of soup (one can pumpkin and one and a half cans of stock) and a teaspoon of the chili flakes. We do like spicy, but this seemed fairly mild. Great flavour and consistancy.

Fantastic soup - I used roasted fresh pumpkin, fresh lime, regular broth instead of the low sodium and whipping cream instead of whole milk. Great taste, and the right amount of spicy for me. The Mexican cream adds the right note. Next time I would probably leave out 1-2 cups of the broth - I liked the flavour better midway than at the end as it was more of a pumpkin flavour. I used my hand blender to process it and save some time. I left out the pepitas because I ate them before the soup was done!

This soup is a little bland with basically only onion to flavor it. However, it is a great beginning and after adding a few touches it was delish. I added a bit of cayenne to the Mexican cream. Also, garlic in with the onion, lots of salt (not usually a big salter, it needs it), and a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar to taste. It was terrific then. Also, I only had 8 cups of broth and that is what I used, it worked great and I don't think I'd want it to be thinner. It is messy though, pumpkin everywhere! I also had a little difficulty getting it smooth in the food processor so I started adding the broth at that point which helped.

Followed it to a T, but also added a little more red pepper flakes. Didn't have the pumpkin seeds but it wasn't missed. I served the soup at a Halloween potluck. Much to everyone's surprise (those that couldn't phamtom Pumpkin Soup) they really liked it! Quite a few asked for the recipe too :-)

Fantastic!! I introduced this soup to many unsure "guinea pigs" and they all asked for the recipe. Incredibly easy to make.

I would make it again...and again, and again.

Great soup, extra spices work well to enhance flavors but I wanted to add a small warning. This soup is volatile, it splatters fiercely when you add the pumpkin and it sprays fiercely if you blend any more than a quarter-blender full. It has an amazing projectile, it went ceiling to floor. Anyway - use a deep pot and stand back.

This was just great. Easy to make and delicious. I added tequila and more chile, otherwise would be a little bland. The presentation was excellent and so yummy. BTW, don't waste your time 'substituting' light products for the super rich variety- live a little and use the heavy cream!

I took advantage of the advice from others and added more red pepper, worcester, and balsamic vinegar. I don't use a food processor and so the onions stayed intact. For the grownups, I finished the soup with 1/2 t of reposado tequila. Muy rico.

This soup was a big disappointment. After reading all the positive reviews, I was sure this would be a winner. It is thin and has almost no flavor. The cream didn't help at all. I like pumpkin and I've had some very delicious pumpkin soups but this sure wasn't one of them.

This recipe was kick-ass. Had it been difficult or time consuming I might not have given it 4 stars (well, forks...), but since I skipped the food processor step, it literally took me 15 minutes to make a 1/2 batch. The soup was tasty, filling, cozy, and surprisingly both rich and healthy (a tricky combination), to boot. It was so easy - perfect for a tired after work meal, with leftovers for lunch the next day.

This is a great first course dish for a Thanksgiving dinner. It is also great on a cold autumn night. The recipe as written is a little spicy and I like that. If you want a less spicy version add a little less crushed red pepper.

I have tried making other pumpkin soups but none were as good as this one. My family has enjoyed it.
