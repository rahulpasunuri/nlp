So delicious. Made our own butter pecan ice cream. Perfectly summer.

Have made this many times and it is SO delicious. And SO easy. It is perfect made exactly as written, but, of course, sometimes I change what fruit I use depending on what looks good - really great with cherries, peaches, and bluberries, too. Will definitely continue to make this.

Muldunez, I completely understand. This astute chef is referring to the CRUMB section when wanting to include flour to make the topping more substantial. Fine either way but I prefer to add flour to make nice big crisp crumbs.

Loved this crisp! I didn't pre-bake the fruit and it turned out fine. Added oats to the topping, also.

Rating: 0
To mulldunez, flour IS included in the recipe! It's listed at the beginning with the fruit - 2 tablespoons plus 3/4 cup all purpose flour...

Excellent way to use late summer fruit. And to the reviewer below this who complained there's no flour in the recipe - look a little more carefully!

Rating: 1
chefs! Isn't it obvious the flour was left out of this recipe? You can't make anything 'crisp' with butter and sugar unless you're carmelizing it! Try adding 1/3 c flour and some oats. All the other crisp recipes have some kind of flour.

Rating: 4
This is always delicious. A forgiving dish with many options for alteration. Any stone fruit and berries work well. Going to make with pears next. Vanilla ice cream is a must!! I've made this probably 4 times in 2 months. Several requests for the recipe,a true crowd-pleaser.

Everyone loved this crisp however I wish the topping would have turned out better. I just didn't feel like it was substantial enough. Next time I'll try adding oats.

Fantastic! I made it according to the recipe and it was dreamy.

This crisp/cobbler hit the spot & was easy to make. I took the suggestion & added Quaker Oats which gave a bit more substance & crunch. Along with vanilla ice cream, this will be made many more times in our kitchen this summer.

I made this for a dinner party (using FROZEN PEACHES even) and served it warm with good vanilla ice cream. It was outstanding and everyone wanted seconds. The perfect healthy summer dessert! I'm trying it again for another party using fresh peaches and am wondering if it can even be better.

Rating: 2
I took the advice of the reviewers who said to double the topping and add oatmeal. I used a mixture of fresh peaches and blueberries only, and I pre-baked the filling for only 25 minutes. The topping sank into the fruit and there is nothing crisp about it at all. I successfully made fruit soup with dumplings. I'd advise others to think twice about doubling the topping, and I'd add something more to thicken the fruit.

Rating: 3
Quick, easy, and delicious! Finally, a use for those wonderful Ga peaches I have been saving in the freezer, along with blueberries picked last summer. The beauty of these is that they had their own juices and were already soft so I didnt have to cook them ahead- just tossed them with the cinnamon and a little Splenda and then into the oven with the topping. Even quicker! Add good vanilla or cinnamon ice cream and you are good to go!

I used 4 peaches and a pint of blueberries. I also added a few small handfulls of oats to the topping. Good thing I tried some before I left the house, because it was so tasty that my roommates devoured the whole thing in just a few hours!

Rating: 1
Eww. I realize that I am an outlier here, but I thought this was gross. I spent a fortune on fruit from the farmer's market only to end up with berry soup. I added oats to the topping, as per others' suggestions, which was one of the only things I liked about this. I will not make this again.

Rating: 0
I substituted nectarines and sweet cherries for the other fruits and it was amazing. It's nearly impossible to goof this one up!

Rating: 3
I agree with other users that next time I'll make more of the topping, and the oats are a good addition. I also added a bit of crystallized ginger to the top, which was a nice touch. For the filling, I cut down on the sugar and, added a bit of ginger, cinnamon, and lemon juice. Delicious. Easy, yummy, and little mess... just about all you need from a dessert.

Rating: 4
Have made this twice - once with the crisp recipe here and once with a revised topping. The revised (doubled with 1/2 oats, less flour and a bit more butter) was excellent. I cut the sugar in the filling to 1/4 cup and added a touch of almond extract. The combination of peaches and berries was great. You have to work with the topping but the freshness of the filling is worth it.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delish! I used mostly peaches (in season) and some frozen blueberries. I followed other reviewers notes and made the topping with oatmeal, brown sugar and butter. An easy delicious dessert!

Rating: 4
I used blackberries, peaches, and strawberries and it was good but I might increase the peaches and delete the strawberries next time. The topping is outstanding -- love the ginger!

Rating: 1
I'm sorry to be one of the lone dissenters on this recipe, but it turned into a horrible soggy berry soup. I followed the recipe and added the topping when specified, and the topping melted into the fruit. I will never pre-cook the fruit again, and don't know why that's part of the recipe.

Rating: 4
DELICIOUS. I used a combination of peaches, raspberries and rhubarb. I also used instant tapicoa instead of the flour for thickening. Ageed with adding in the oatmeal for the topping and would definetly double it. Will definetly make again. Anytype of berry combination would be just as delicious.

My husband and dinner guests thought this was amazing-- I was happy but not overwhelmed. The peaches with berries is really nice, the amount of sugar is perfect and the topping is crunchy without being at all overwhelming. Good basic summer desert with very little prep time.

Rating: 4
I made this with 2 cups frozen mixed berries and 4.5 cups mixed apples (granny smith, red delicious) reduced the sugar like the other reviewers and baked before the guests arrived for 40 mins because the apples took longer. I then used the topping recipe from CRANBERRY-APPLE CRISP WITH OATMEAL STREUSEL TOPPING recipe found on this website plus 3/4 tsp cinnamon and placed in the fridge. When it was time for dessert, I preheated the oven to 400 F, sprinkled on the topping and baked for 20 mins. Easy and delicious. It was a hit!

Rating: 4
I used apples instead of peaches (seasonal), and fresh strawberries + rasberries along with frozen mixed berries. Also added a handful of oats to doubled topping recipe. It was sooooo goooooood, will definitely make again and will cut down the sugar a bit more as previous reviewers. Yummy!

So good and so easy! I have made it twice for quick get togethers and everyone loved it. My husband is a big fan.

I have made this recipe several times, and it is one of my favorites. I've brought it into work twice - once made with fresh fruit, the second time I used frozen mixed berries (made up of strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and blueberries). My work crew LOVED both times, but said they liked the one with the frozen fruit even better than when I made it with fresh. They liked the strawberries in the mix. Just a suggestion!

Rating: 4
This was awsome. I doubled the topping as suggested by other reviewers and threw in a handful of oatmeal. Instead of adding the topping halfway through the baking, I added at the beginning (this was my error). I baked it for a total of 40 minutes. The topping and fruit were perfect.

Rating: 4
great, easy recipe. used fresh blueberries and peaches. a tough one to screw up with any in season fruit.

Only used fresh blueberries and peaches and about half the sugar...very pleased!! Will definitely make again after my next visit to the farmers market.

I have made this 3 times this week! Very good. I did cook the crisp for 25min,in a 9x9 pan- that way you can use more topping(I doubled the topping recipe)I also added oats,pecans and coconut to the topping.

Delicious! Definitely put ice cream on top and double the topping. It's the best part!

I used just blueberries and peaches, it was very good. Next time I will use a bit less sugar and make more topping - I did add some oats, which worked well.

Being that I live in Anchorage and have eaten at the Marx Bro.s many times, it's wonderful to have the recipe for one of my favorite desserts! A great treat and easy to make. Thanks!

Rating: 3
Making this recipe for the second time this week! Blueberries and peaches are in season and so affordable (especially if you can pick your own berries). I took an earlier cook's advice and initially baked the fruit for only 20 minutes - and also did not bother stirring 'occasionally'. I am also adding a 1/4 cup of oats to the topping. So easy. So delicious. Definitely a keeper recipe.

Rating: 2
I folIowed the directions exactly and was disappointed with the result. I wish that I had read ALL of the reviews before I attempted this dessert. Next time I will bake the mixture for 25 minutes rather than 40 and double the topping as suggested. I will probably add some chopped walnuts or pecans to the crust as well.

This is a great crisp, it is simple to make and taste great.

This recipe was wonderful! I doubled the crust and served it over vanilla bean ice cream.

Incredibly delicious. Made last year w/addition of some granola to the topping, and that was even better. This time used no raspberries, just peach/blueberry/blackberry combo, and still great. I'm reluctant to try frozen/canned because the fresh fruit tastes so good.

Rating: 0
I didn't rate this recipe because I used different fruit combo. I've made it twice, once with frozen rhubarb and strawberries, and once with frozen peaches, blueberries, and cherries. My family loved both of them. This ones a keeper, you just can't ruin it!

Only had peaches from the backyard. I doubled the crust. It was delicious! Can't wait to try with more types of fruit. A good basic recipe to have & USE because crisp is SOOOO easy.

Rating: 3
Wonderful recipe!! I too, only used peaches and also cut the sugar in half as the peaches were very sweet to begin with. I cut the peaches in large chunks so they wouldn't become mushy as another cook stated. So with large chunks of fruit, about 30 minutes is enough until the fruit starts bubbling. Also doubled the topping!! Delicious! Will make again!!

Rating: 4
I only had peaches and blueberries, and it was absolutely wonderful. The recipe is totally foolproof. Don't bake the fruit for more than 25 minutes or the blueberries will be a sloppy mess by the time you put the crunch on. Next time, I will double the crisp(it was everybody's favorite part). I followed other reviewer comments and cut the sugar in half, since the fruit was so sweet, and added a touch of almond extract. I also added granola to the crisp. I served this for a "girls' nite" dinner and four of us ate the whole thing no problem. A very excellent dessert!

I loved the recipe and the mix of berries. My son and his friends were in heaven with this. They added butter pecan ice cream. I did add about 1/2 cup granola to the topping. My son suggested that more granola be added and that i add a little less sugar. We tried this adjustment the next night and it was also fabulous. The granola gave it a nice added crunch.

Incredibly easy and delicious!!! The mix of fruit gave it a nice texture and wonderful blend of flavors. Will definitely make it again!

I found this to be a great recipe! I did however add a few drops of almond extract to the fruit which I only baked for 40 minutes. And I increased the topping recipe another 1/2X. YUMMY!

I made this using 2 C.each, blueberries and raspberries and one large peach and one large nectarine because that is what I had on hand. It was outstanding and enjoyed by everyone, young and old. I would use this recipe again using 4 C of mixed berries and whatever other fruit I had available.

I had a bumper crop of fresh white peaches, and only blueberries. Didn't matter. It was a grand slam home run hit! Also added about 1T of fresh lemon juice to fruit mix. SO GOOD!!

Rating: 3
I made the recipe exactly as stated, except I think I baked it slightly too long, which I think was the reason all the fruit became a purplish sauce and oozed through over the crust. The entire dessert was overly sweet, as well. Next time, I will reduce sugar to maybe 2T, and I will be careful not to overbake, so that the fruit can stay in whole pieces.

Rating: 4
I substitued rhubarb for the peaches, and strawberries for the blueberries. Because the berries that I used were exceptionally sweet, I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup. For the topping, I only used 1/2 cup of flour, and added in 1/2 cup of uncooked oats. I also omitted the salt and replaced the unsalted butter with salted butter. It turned out perfect with a wonderful balance between the tart rhubarb and the sweet berries. I think the trick is adjusting the amount of sugar according to how sweet/tart your combination of fruit and berries is. My friend made this dish exactly as the recipe states, and it turned out sickeningly sweet.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe several times now, and have gotten rave reviews from my office the two times that I have brought it in! With it being winter, and the price of berries and peaches being high during this time of year, I used canned peaches & frozen berries, which included strawberries. The comments I got from coworkers was that they liked it BETTER this time! So, don't be afraid to use can and frozen fruit. I also double the topping recipe (since that tends to be the part that everyone loves best!)

Rating: 4
One of the better fruit crisps I have made. I used white peaches and would recommend it if you can find good ripe ones. Also used Golden Bakers sugar instead of light brown sugar. Gave topping a nice texture.

Rating: 4
I made this in a 10"x14" roasting pan and doubled the recipe to include 8 nectarines, a half pint each of blueberries and raspberries, and a mango. I only put a 1/2 cup of sugar in the fruit. The nectarines weren't quite ripe for eating, but worked better for the crisp as they were firm and tart. Also noticed the double baking procedure belatedly after tossing the pan in the oven at 350, complete with topping. Approximately an hour later, everything came out perfect. I'd say this recipe is fool proof.

Rating: 3
I've made this twice now, and it is excellent. I like oats in my crisps, so I added one half a cup of non-instant oatmeal. It is great. You can make it with only peaches, too, if that's all you have. Real vanilla ice cream or milk tastes good with it.

Rating: 4
I used six peaches and omitted blackberries. Added 1 tbs of lemon juice for tartness. Also added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to crisp recipe. I will try with some chopped walnuts in crips recipe next time I make it. Couldn't be better and is elegantly easy.

This crisp was fabulous and just what I was looking for. It can be made ahead and reheated. I would use it year round with apples and frozen fruit in the middle of winter.

Yum! I used a ton of peaches and a few blueberries and this was great. The topping part came out a little undercooked, but this was probably my fault.

Pretty good, although a bit runny. The 2nd time around, I used more peaches, which worked better.

Rating: 4
My family enjoyed this dessert very much. I modified it slightly: I did not have any raspberries, I tossed the fruit in fresh honey instead of sugar, and I used 1/4 cup flour and 1/2+ rolled oats in the topping. Next time I use this recipe, I might not use blackberries, because the seeds are so noticeable. This dessert is easy and quick to prepare, and is fantastic a la mode.

I made this recipe using only nectarines, since that was what I had on hand. I cooked the nectarines just until they bubbled (not 40 minutes)then proceeded with the recipe. Great taste!

EXCELLENT light dessert!!! Used 3 white peaches and mixture of blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries. Would not modify. The only problem is the expense of fresh berries. Served with vanilla ice cream and frozen yogurt. Delish!

Rating: 4
I made this for desert tonight and it was a HIT! Kids loved it. I used 5 peaches, the blueberries, just a handful of raspberries (that's all that I had in the fridge)and no blackberries. Worked just great. I didn't get a chance to serve it with ice cream since everyone was digging in as soon as it came out of the oven. Next time I'll make one to freeze as the other cook suggested. I would love to have this on hand when sweet peaches are not as easy to come by.

Rating: 4
I used no raspberries, increased the peaches to 4 (to make up for the missing raspberries) and used wild Maine blueberries and it was fabulous! I doubled the recipe and it made enough to freeze the rest and then reheat at a later time and both groups of my company raved on and on about this "keeper". I'll add even another peach or two the next time I make it which will be often!

Rating: 3
I used all raspberries instead of the mixture of berries. It was very good. I'd skip the peaches next time and use just raspberries since I'm actually not a huge fan of peach cobblers. My husband liked the peaches, so I think it was just me. All raspberries would be like a warm raspberry pie. Yum!!!
