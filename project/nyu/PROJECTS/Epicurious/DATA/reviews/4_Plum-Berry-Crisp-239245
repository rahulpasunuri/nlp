I have to agree with the reviewer who felt that the temperature for baking this dish is too high. After about 20 minutes I started smelling that this dish was done. I left it in the oven for another 5 minutes at a lower heat setting, but it was still overcooked. I do not feel that this dish is good enough to use again, so I deleted it from my recipes.

I make berry crisps all the time. This one is the best by far. The perfect crumble top all the time. I find the oven temp to be spot on, so too bad for the cook below, that is a bummer. I don;t change a thing, perfect how written!

Oven temp outlined in recipe is much too high, try 350-375. Even if I had cut the time by a third, it would have still been ruined. Wasted some gorgeous plums and blueberries on this one.

I make a lot of fruit crisps in the summer and this was the best yet! Use any combination of stone fruits and berries. I suggest adding nutmeg and/or cinnamon to the crisp and grated lemon rind to the fruit and berries. Excellent dessert (and breakfast the next morning!)

I couldn't find fresh blackberries the first time I made this recipe, so I just added more plums and blueberries. I love cardamom and blueberries together, so I also played around a bit by adding some cardamom to both the filling and the topping. It was delicious and a hit at a small dinner party. I definitely advise using good fruit, it can make or break the recipe. The first time I made it with wonderful soft, ripe plums, but the second time the plums were a out of season and not nearly as delicious which made the crisp suffer.

I followed the directions exactly and it came out perfectly. So simple and delicious. Definitely serve with ice cream to make the dessert complete.

This is delicious. If you want to make a gluten free topping, you can use very berry granola instead of rolled oats and flour cut down on the brown sugar.

Very Yummy and a huge hit with my entire family! There seemed to be too much butter in the topping so I increased the oats by 1/2 cup. I tried it with just peaches as well and was GREAT.

I added chopped hazelnuts to the topping and used plucots and blackberries for the fruit. Super easy and yummy!!

Simple, basic crisp recipe. Easy to make, tastes great. Only wish I have some vanilla ice cream to serve with it :)

As suggested I added Cinnamon & Nutmeg plus a little cornstarch to mixed berries. I scaled it up to feed 100 and it was a HUGE hit. Definately a keeper.

This recipe was yummy and VERY fast and easy. I agree with other people that the fruit is good with a pinch of cinnamon. I also added a pinch of salt, and lemon juice would be a nice touch. I think that the topping could use less butter and may be more tasty and healthier that way. I agree with the other reviewer who said to watch it after 20 minutes; I was surprised by how quickly this cooked.

This is an excellent, flavorful recipe that is extremely easy to boot. As earlier reviewers suggested I added cinnamon to the fruit and cinnamon and nutmeg to the pastry. Use plums or plucots and whatever berries are available -- blueberries, black berries or rasberries. Serve with vanilla icecream. Make extra for breakfast!

very tasty, even better hot out of oven with a little ice cream.

This was good, but not worth making again. Something about the different textures of plums vs berries---just didn't like the plums.

Very good and VERY easy! The only change I would make would be to set the timer to maybe 20 minutes and watch it. I did the suggested 30 minutes and the topping got QUITE dark. The idea someone had for adding cinammon sounded good too - I'll try that next time!

yummy yummy. this is a simple yummy desert. so incredibly easy. i 1.5x the recipe (by eye) and added blackberries and blueberries (frozen) to fill halfway a pyrex lasagna pan. then i doubled the topping recipe and added plain granola and chopped crystallized ginger. I also added about 1/2 cup of diced walnuts. A dash of cinnamon too. This was so good with vanilla ice cream!!! It took so long to cool that it was still warm when it was served. I put it in right before we served dinner and everyone loved it.

Very easy to put together. Made it to bring to my parents and was a big hit. Only change was to add some cinnamon to the fruit mixture and then cinnamon and nutmeg to the crumbs

Very delicious, the plums really balance out the tartness of the berries. I am not even sure the blueberries were necessary as my particular blackberries were so flavorful. I used some granola breakfast cereal in place of the rolled oats and it worked fine. I totally agree with liberal amounts of vanilla ice cream to go with this one.

I have already made this twice in one week! I serve it warm with vanilla ice cream and it is wonderful! The plums really add to the traditional berry crisp.

So easy to make and so yummy. Tasted like summer bounty of fruity goodness! My husband and I ate this every night for desert for the week. He liked his cold and I liked it and thought it was perfect served a little warm.
