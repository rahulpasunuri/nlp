I have made this recipe several times, the first time for a bookclub group. It is wonderfully light, like eating sweet air. I did have difficulty finding orange-flower water, so I substituted Cointreau. Once, I mixed in fresh blueberries with the strawberries~ again, delicious. I will definitely make this again and again.
