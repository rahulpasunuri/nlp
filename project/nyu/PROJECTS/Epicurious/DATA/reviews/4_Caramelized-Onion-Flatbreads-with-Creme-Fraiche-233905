This was really delicious, but what a mess. When they say the creme fraiche mixture can spill over, I should have known to cook the flatbreads on a baking sheet with a lip. I will put more of a crust around the outside next time I make it. I had trouble with making 6 5" rounds and ended up with 4 oblong/heart shaped crusts of different sizes. This was a great recipe because I had some leftover creme fraiche and I had everything else on hand, except nigella seeds. I Used a spice mix for flavor, some mustard seeds for texture, and some unknown indian spice called Juan (1/4 tsp each) instead. I Also threw some rosemary in the dough because I had it. Mine did not crisp up on the bottom really, but I wouldn't risk a pizza stone until I get the spillage under control. The onions were not as beautiful as the picture, but very delicious.

The recipe doesn't mention baking powder. Mine turned out absolutely flat because I didn't put any baking powder, I think, I'm not sure.

My flatbread looked nothing like in the picture. It just didnt rise and was flat, I still have no clue what I did wrong. And it was not close to ready in 12 mins. I had to keep it for longer, up the temperature and what not. I am certain the recipe is correct since so many of you people have got it right. Any ideas? I have to say the caramelized onions were absolutely awesome.

This appetizer was the hit of our dinner. The onions were sweet and the bread was a good texture. We had leftover creme fraiche and drizzled a little over the flatbreads again after they came out of the oven. So good! And I couldn't find the nigella seeds and substituted dried oregano which tasted great. A little research online said that nigella seeds have a flavor similar to oregano.

I found this recipe after looking for a way to get rid of leftover creme fraiche. These were really tasty, easy to make, and most of the other ingredients you already have. I used flax seeds instead of nigella. I also wasn't able to decipher the onion-cutting directions. This is so the onions don't fall apart? Who cares, cut them any damn way you want, it all goes down the same: delicious.

Made this for an Indian themed appetizer meal. Easy and wonderful. Everybody loved it. Even without the nigella seeds.

these are delicious! made them for appetizers on thanksgiving--they were gone in minutes. Full of taste and not too filling--I'm making them again for the holidays

Very similar to tarte flambe from Alsace which rests it's onions and cream topping on puff pastry. This is a less rich alternative.

Delicious appetizer that would also be terrific as a vegetarian main course! Was a bit of a challenge to find the nigella seeds. Finally located some at www.zamourispices.com. Was well worth the effort ~ the seeds provide such a nice contrast to the sweet caramelized onions. Although B.A. recommended a red with this dish, we served a white Alsace wine and it was a great match.
