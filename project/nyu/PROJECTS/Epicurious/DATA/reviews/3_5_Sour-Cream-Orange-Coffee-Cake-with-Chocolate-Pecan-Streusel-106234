Easy to make and family friendly. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by mandy Higgins.

Made the recipe to the T..just reduced the amount of sugar..cake was very moist and the orange zest just makes it so unique in taste. However the struesel on top didn't come out the way it should have, any tips?

I made this exactly as written, as I always do because that is really the only way to tell whether one likes THIS recipe. The flavor was nicely balanced; the texture light and moist. I do think that it was way too sweet, though. When I make this again I will reduce the amount of sugar in the streusel by quite a lot. It also took me 20 min. longer to bake than the recipe stated and I do have an oven thermometer so I know the temperature was fairly accurate.

I have been making this coffee cake since this February 2002 issue came out and I have never,ever had the streusel sink to the bottom. If you have, you need to follow the recipe exactly or re-read it to see what you did wrong. This recipe is outstanding and I think the chocolate really gives it an extra flavor. We make it every Holliday morning as my husband begs for us to make this recipe. I wouldn't change a thing.

Wonderful... lots of flavor and moist!!! I used 2 tbsp less butter for the streusel.... I will make it again!!

This was a waste of time and ingredients. The streusel sank to the bottom and the cake had no flavor. It deserves no forks.

Absolutely delicious recipe. For the streusel, I added an extra 2T butter to spread a little easier and make an initial thicker layer. Also, I used the same amount of pecans as some honey roasted peanuts just to spice up the recipe a little bit. And extra another few T of orange juice (extra pulp) to bring out some more flavors. Just some suggestions, but a great recipe. I would recommend it to anyone. My parents loved it enough to make it for themselves even though it was supposed to be for the Bible study class. Enjoy and keep the great recipes coming!! I look forward to enhancing my baking skills. Ciao

This was really great. My sister and I made this together with kids buzzing around and a toddler at our feet and it was still easy (though a bit time-consuming). We forgot the pecans & choc. chips in the middle then added half the amount called for to the top. Both of us agreed that the chocolate was not only not necessary, but was a distraction from the other great flavors (and we like chocolate). We were shy 1/2 c of sour cream and instead used vanilla yogurt with no noticeable texture or flavor issues. It's moist and delicious straight from the oven (or after 20 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes...we kept going back for more!)or after a day well-covered (if it lasts that long). Skip the chocolate chips, add the pecans, make a big pot of coffee and enjoy time with family.

I made this coffee cake once before and am pleased with the results yet again. My father, who loves orange and chocolate, really loved this sweet breakfast treat. I added more orange zest to the batter, and used small chunks of milk and dark chocolate instead of chips. If you make the recipe as stated, use mini chips. Without the additional zest, the orange flavor is not as pronounced, but still quite lovely.

Rating: 3
Very easy, delicious and surprisingly moist. I halved the recipe and made it in an 8" springform pan. Wasn't in the mood for chocolate so I omitted that but otherwise made as is. I would add more orange zest next time to punch up that flavor.

I made this cake for holiday gift. It came out very moist to my surprise. I had the same problem with cooking time adjustment due to the fact that I used loaf pans instead. The receipe is good for 2 loafs.

I just made this and it is simply wonderful, a nice change from regular coffee cakes. I made in a 10 in springform pan and when done it looks so professional. the only problem is i need to adjust the bake time a little better bottom and sides were done before the middle causing it to be a little to brown on the bottom. But that can be worked out. Definately try this one

This will become a staple in my recipe stash! I followed reviewer's suggestions and added more orange zest. Even an entire week later it was still moist, flavorful, and delicious! Next time I will try two 8" round cake pans instead of a 13" x 9".

I made this without the chips, otherwise following the recipe exactly. This produced a moist, classic cake, which everyone at work loved. A hit! I would add more orange rind and orange oil next time though.

Rating: 3
Used mini choc chips as well and used 3/4 cup - I didn't want to go overboard w/ the chocolate. The struesel on top made a 'dent' in my cake as well. The cake did rise nicely though. The orange flavor was very subtle, not overwhelming at all.

Rating: 3
I would have given this recipe four forks, but I reserve that for dishes that make me weep. This cake came close. I made it exactly by the book, except I tripled the orange peel because 1 1/2 teaspoons isn't enough to balance the pecan/chocolate flavors. The cake was wonderfully moist and the streusel was wonderfully crunchy. It's very easy to make and tastes just as good the second day. I cut the 9x13 cake into 24 pieces, which held together nicely at that size. You may not want to know this, but I calculated the calories and it's 370 per piece.

I've made other sour cream/streusel coffee cakes from this site but this one was the best. I made it in a bundt pan and baked it longer (45 minutes). Not a crumb was left.

The second time I made this cake (in a springform) I made the following changes: 1 c. brown sugar, 1/2 T cin., 4 T butter, 1 c. pecans, 1 1/4 c. mini choc. chips. This was the perfect amount of streusel, and I like a bit more chocolate. For the cake, I used 1 T orange peel and 1/3 c. fresh squeezed OJ. This gave it a little more kick without overwhelming the cake.

Rating: 3
Very good, and not too rich for me. I used a spring-form pan and only 2/3rds of the streusel topping. It took 55 min in the oven. I followed others advice and used mini chocolate chips. Next time, I will add more orange zest and chocolate.

Rating: 3
I made this cake exactly as directed (except I used a pyrex pan, instead of a metal one)for a Christmas Eve brunch, and it was a big hit, especially with those who like things on the sweet side. There was no problem with sinking topping, and indeed the batter was very thick, almost elastic. The cake was impressive looking, high and rich with goodies. I thought it was a bit sweet for my tastes, but I like to suck lemon slices! My guests enjoyed it, and although it was way too much for a small bunch of houseguests to eat at one sitting, it was devoured over the course of the next couple of days.

Fabulous! Doubled the recipe and baked in two pans for our church coffee hour - and was inundated with recipe requests! This rich coffee cake was a snap to put together. I baked it the previous afternoon and it was still incredibly moist the next day after only having been covered and kept at room temp. Those craving a true orange flavor may want to increase the orange rind.

Rating: 3
I completely messed up the instructions on this recipe (I didn't mix the butter and sugar separately--duh!). I thought it was going to be a disaster but when I took it out of the oven, it looked amazing. I still held my breath as I sliced the first piece but it was wonderful! Very moist, flavourful. It's a keeper!

I make this all the time...by error I took out cinnamon chips &its a wonderful change! I also add the zest of an orange to both the streusel & and the cake batter. We get rave reviews from friends & family & orders never to make any other type.

This recipe was absolutely perfect! I made it for brunch and it was a huge hit, then my boyfriend came over to watch the Broncos/Chiefs game and he had three huge pieces (he's a big guy). Said this is what he wants for his birthday. I made it as is - no changes except I didn't measure the orange peel, just grated the peel from a whole orange and used all of it. I used ALL of the streusel and it was perfect. I did use the mini-chips, as suggested by other reviewers. Perfect recipe, a definite keeper.

I halved the recipe and omitted the chocolate chips (had a choc. overload lately) and it turned out great. Very rich tasting/moise cake...will definitely make again, maybe next time with the chocolate!

After reading all the glowing reviews and helpful tips I decided to try this recipe and well, this cake did not look at all like the picture. I had the same problem as some other reviewers in that the topping did not stay on the top, but sank to the bottom of the cake pan. It was difficult to remove and serve. The taste was OK, but I have made better Sour Cream Coffee Cakes from this site. I even refrigerated the topping as was suggested by other reviewers, but I think there is just too much butter in the topping making it heavy and causing it to sink.

Rating: 4
This is a dense, moist, delicious coffee cake. I baked it in a springform bundt pan for 10 minutes less than recipe recommends. I will, however, use only 1/2 the amount of streusel if I bake it in a ring again. There seemed to be more streusel than cake (which is not necessarily a complaint!!!)

This coffee cake was absolutely fantastic. I bake frequently for my office, and this was the recipe that most impressed them. The cake was extremely moist and rich - and elicited rave reviews.

This cake is delicious - I did cut the streusel in half - and it was plenty --not quite so much on top but I sprinkled a few more choc. chips . I did add an extra 1/2 tsp orange rind - maybe a little more next time. I loved the texture, as did my husband, but it is filling and a small piece with a cup of coffee is more than enough. Mine got done in 45 minutes - and I know it isn't my oven, because everything else gets baked in time suggested. Will make again, anxious to see how it freezes.

I made this coffee cake this morning for my weekly Bible study group. My husband stole 2 pieces on his way out the door and proclaimed it delicious, as did all the women in the group! I made it exactly as the recipe stated, and although it definitely took longer to bake than the recipes says, it's well worth the wait. I will be making this coffee cake again!

Rating: 3
This coffee cake was excellent. I made the recipe in large quantity and found that in bigger and deeper cake pans the streusel topping gets sucked in like it is in quick sand. Also, the streusel in the middle should really be placed in the middle, not too close to the bottom of the pan as it is very buttery and makes the bottom of the cake greasy. Still, a great, delicious cake!

I thought this was wonderful and I am pretty picky about what I give 4 stars! I served for a ladies coffee and had to print a copy of the recipe for all.

Found this cake to be much too sweet. Would not make again. The Cinnamon Coffee Cake Kotnuik on this site is much, much better, especially with addition of pecans.

This recipe was excellent, but it is for a large group. I ammended per previous reviews. I halved the recipe streusel for the inside using mini chips. Then I used a different streusel of 1/2 Cup Flour, 1/2 C sugar 1 tsp. cinnamon and 6 TBLS butter for the top. I added 1/2 tsp salt to the cake. There was no problem with sinking and I didn't cover it. Just popped in the oven and baked for 55 minutes.

Another over the top recipe. I used a 10" springform pan and it took almost twice as long to bake and truthfully was much too dense for my taste. That being said, it was moist on top with a perfectly baked crust. My brother hates me for baking this as he couldn't stop picking at it throughout his weekend visit. This is quite sweet so I would not changed the pan size because I think it would have risen higher and have been lighter. I will try it again in a l3x9 pan.

I made this cake for a grduation brunch and it was a huge hit. I used light butter and light sour cream and it didn't seem to compromise the taste at all. I also used a 10' round springform pan so it presented beautifully. This requires a longer baking time - 10 to 15 minutes. Chocolate and orange - Yum!

This coffee cake is excellent. I used 1/2 cup butterscotch chips instead of the one cup of choc chips. Gives it a great flavor. I also eliminated the powder sugar. This did not last long and I had many request for the recipe.

I used low fat plain yogurt (since I was out of sour cream), and mini choc. chips (I think they work better in streusel). Also, I baked it in muffin tins (18 very full...22 would have been better) for 20 min. to take to a business mtg. They were fabulous. I'm keeping this one.

This coffee cake turned out great, with a few modifications. Per recommendations from prior reviewers, I used buttermilk instead of sour cream, and added an orange glaze when the cake was cooled. I omitted the chocolote chips due to reviews stating the coffee cake was too rich. Very tasty now!

Just made this and it was WONDERFUL! I appreciated others' comments and heeded some of the advice given. I put in fewer chocolate chips, a quarter cup less sugar in the batter, and actually used less streusel than the recipe called for (to keep the Overwhelming Factor at a minimum). I also used only 2 eggs, but this was completely by accident (hey, I have 2 small kids around!), but I can't believe the end product suffered at all. Delicious, moist, and tender, with great crunchy streusel. My family will see this one again and again.

Made this cake and it was delicious. Didnt have any pecans so I used walnuts instead. Followed the recipe and it turned out great. The only semi bad thing was that the streusel mix was a little too much so the cake didnt stay together in some sections. If I make it again, i would put a little less streusel on the inside.

I've made this twice; once exactly as written, then a second time with alterations. I substituted buttermilk for sour cream, only used 1/2 t of cinnamin (the first time the cake was a bit "busy". I used 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips;just enough to freckle it with flavor - this is such a light cake, it needs no more. And finally, rather than a sprinkle of powdered sugar, I prepared a glaze with powdered sugar and orange juice. This added citrus brightens all of the flavors, and moistens the overall cake. Try it!

Not a big fan of orange & chocolate, but the orange is so subtle it works. Cake texture is moist like a sour cream cake should be. I had problems w/streusel too -even after refrigerated it. I think next time I'll use less on the first layer, and add some flour to it and hopefully this will make it "crumby" so they keep their shape and don't melt.

Rating: 2
This is certainly a disappointment. The taste was ok, but the texture was terrible. Like some other reviewers, my streusel sank into the cake and caused the cake to be soggy. I already followed another reviewer's advice to put the streusel into the fridge before use, but that didn't work. Of course, my cake looked nothing like the picture, and yes, it was very heavy in the stomach. The worst thing is, it kinda sticks to the palate too. The streusel is far from being crunchy. I am hoping that this cake will taste better after I've put it into the fridge for a couple of days to harden.

Yum! This was a great coffee-cake, I served it a dinner party and then the next day when we had more company over and both groups loved it :). I wanted to serve it slightly warm and it's terrific a little warm- the streusel melts on top and makes it creamy. Although I've made better coffecakes this was pretty good and I'll make it again.

About average for this type of cake. Nice tasting but not exciting. Thought the combination of orange and chocolate would be more enticing, but there doesn't seem to be enough of either to make a difference. Makes a good dessert though. A lot of work though for the end product.

This cake came out very moist and light when I made it. The streusel:cake ratio was good and a nice combination. I used dried orange zest, but would the fresh zest next time as the cake could have used a little more flavor. Pretty easy to make, and very tasty.

Rating: 4
Loved it and so did everyone else! After reading the reviews I braced myself for a dense and heavy cake this was NOT the case. It was very light and moist. I don't know why everyone said it was heavy. I used light sourcream maybe that made the difference. I also beat the eggs very well. In fact the cake is so good I intend to make it without the streusel next time. Don't get me wrong the streusel is definately good too!

I did really like this cake and so did my brother-in-law. He told his children it wasn't any good so that there would be more left for him. There was lots left but I never mind leftovers, I just freeze the rest so it can be available for my husband's lunches, friends stopping over for coffee, my sweet tooth attacks, etc. About it being heavy - I automatically substitute buttermilk for sour cream in any cake recipe since every time I have used sour cream it comes out like a brick. I will definitely make it again!

I agree with some of the other reviewers 1. It did not look like the photo in the magazine 2. Very heavy for a coffee cake, more like a pound cake. 3. tasted more like a dessert then a breakfast cake.

I have made this twice already by request because everyone loved it. I made it just as the recipe stated the first time but found that for our tastes there was not enough orange flavor. The second time I added 1/2t more orange zest and 1/2t orange extract. This cake has a very nice complex flavor and texture with orange and a beautiful balance of chocolate and cinnamon with the moist cake and crunch of the pecans. It is much more moist and flavorful after it has set for a day than it is fresh from the oven. It is very good served cold but is great re-warmed and was still quite good on the 4th day. I will make this again.

This was a good recipe, but it was way too much cake for my family. I had to give it away to the neighbors. There is so much fat in this cake that I would reserve it for special occasions, but the taste was terrific.

I haven't made this recipe yet, so I didn't rate it; I wanted to respond to the reviewer from CA on 2/16/02; I have made lots of steusel type cakes, and if you want better results with the streusel I have a suggestion tha you might try. Make sure the streusel is clumpy; what I do to ensure a "clumpy" streusel is put the streusel in the fridge (before putting it on the cake!) and get it shilled. Then I take it out of the fridge and pinch big clumps of it in my hand before placing it on the cake. You almost have to overdo it! Hope this helps.

When I saw the picture of this cake in Bon Appetit I knew right away I wanted to bake it. It was even better than I'd hoped. The cake part was moist, and the orange peel added to both the flavor and texture of the cake, as well as made an excellent complement to the choc/pecan streusel. My husband and I ate almost the whole thing ourselves. I can't wait to make this for company!!!

This cake was good. I agree with the previous reviewer about the streusel being too much. I really enjoyed the flavor of the cake. I did not enjoy the texture. It was heavier than I expected it to be. After one small piece, you felt the cake in your stomach. Kind of like a pound cake. Too heavy for me.

A little too much struesel on top - next time I would put less on top since it is a bit too sweet for me. It did taste better the next day.
