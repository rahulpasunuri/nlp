I reduced the recipe to make only 1/2 a loaf & sprinkled some kosher salt on top. Really enjoyed this, we'll be making it again!

This recipie was awesome! A definate keeper. I made it for my brother's b-day dinner and my mom couldn't get over how good it smelled! I made 1/2 of the bread with the pepper and paprika and 1/2 without, so people could choose what they wanted. Also, I did not melt the butter, and the bread turned out wonderfully. JUST A TIP: you may want to mix the pepper, paprika, and parmesan cheese in a seperate bowl before you sprinkle it over the bread. I found that it helped keep everything evenly spread. I also added a little bit of dried parsley.

This is a keeper - delicious. I took another reviewers advice and creamed the ingredients for more control. Yummy!

Yum! Recommend using softened butter. Addition of 2T Mayo was a wonderful suggestion.

Very American-- the type of garlic bread you get in your typical Italian-American restaurant. Very tasty, however; I've made it several times already!

The first time I made this recipe I did not melt the butter, I creamed the garlic with the butter and spread it on the bread and followed the rest of the instructions. The next time I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't like it as well. It was too greasy for me. I will make this again and do as I did initialy. I had more control over the creamed mixture.

This bread was really good. I will definately be making it again, like say tonight!!!! It's pretty basic but sometimes that's all it takes.

Delicious!

Good, but not top of the charts. Also, I wound up with a fair amount of the butter mixture left over - despite a liberal amount of brushing. You could get away with less.

Outstanding! Everybody gobbled it up at our last barbecue. This will become my "standard" garlic bread recipe.

Very easy to make and still tasted great! Be careful to watch carefully while broiling; both times I nearly burned the bread.

This recipe was delicious. My husband loved it. I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and added 1T of mayo and 1T of sour cream an that just made the dish even beter. My entire family loved it.

So delicious. I always improvise and end up putting too much melted butter on the bread or too much garlic. This was perfect. The paprika is a nice twist!

I have been making a similar version for years that has been hard to beat. My version is 1/3 - 1/2 C butter, 4-6 garlic, 2T parmesan cheese, 2T mayonnaise (the real stuff)and a splash of hot sauce. Whip up in the food processor and what you don't use on a french baguette, save and use the rest on baking powder biscuts, buns, etc. Would put you straight to "garlic heaven"!!" My husband will have this over plain butter any given day!

Used minced garlic from a jar but still tasted good. I've never used parmesan & paprika on my garlic bread before. Tasty combination.

The best garlic bread recipe I have ever tried. Everyone who tries it asks for the recipe. It is delicious!
