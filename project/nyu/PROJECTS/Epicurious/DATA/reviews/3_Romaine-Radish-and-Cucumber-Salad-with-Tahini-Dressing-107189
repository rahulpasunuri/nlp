This is especially great with some homemade garlic croutons and sliced boiled egg! Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

I loved the dressing in particular. Works with other salads as well. You can leave out the 1/2 teaspoon of salt since the soy sauce will give it enough salt.

Loved the dressing, made my own salad with romaine,spinach, walnuts,tomatoes,celery,carrot,and a sprinkle of blue cheese.

I only made the dressing. We tasted it on tomatoes and sacrificed it to the disposer god. Too salty, too "one-note".

I enjoyed the salad, but I would offer as a very small side. I got bored with the salad quickly. Almost reminded me of a sate dipping sauce.

Yummy! Refreshing and crunchy and very easy to make. Makes a lot more dressing than you need--enjoyed it on later salads.
