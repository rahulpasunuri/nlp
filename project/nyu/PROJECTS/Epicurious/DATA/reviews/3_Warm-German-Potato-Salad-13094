I make this recipe often for picnics. It's a great version of a classic recipe. I do tend to add more bacon and vinegar than called for ... and I cut the potatoes before I cook them because I find that easier. But, even just as written, it's a great recipe!

I honestly can't believe I am offering my dinner guests this what is called Warm German Potato Salad. I am red faced. I have never had a German Potatoe salad that was dry. In other words a pile of potatoes and bacon with no taste and a God-awful looking mess. I followed the recipe exact and bought Yukon Gold potatoes at $1.00 per pound wanting the finest ingredients. Save yourself and SKIP this recipe!!!

I couldn't find my usual German potato salad recipe, but this came really close. I followed everything exactly, but omitted the beef broth. It would have been too soupy, I think. And of course, you need to add salt to taste. That makes all the difference in the world. My family loves this. I lived in Germany for a time also. I never had it warm either, but who cares-warm just mean you get to eat it faster! :)

I lived in Germany for 10 years and had food from all parts of the country and the first time I had hot or warm German potato salad was in the US. I don't know where this salad comes from but it's not German

Very good for what i was looking for...some changes: -used brown sugar instead of white -more salt -more vinegar.

Just returned from vacationing with German Friends. They do not eat their Potato Salad warm or room temp (at least in the wine country region of Germany). The potato salad there was more like the American Amish potato salad.

this recipe has a hint of what real german potato salad is...its good for starters but it doesn't beat the tradional variety.

Very easy and tasty. Add more vinegar and sugar otherwise all you will be tasting is potatoes.

Of course I had to add celery seed. I also increased the sugar and vinegar. I served it with grilled bratwurst, pickled beets and sauerkraut and my guest enjoyed the combination.

My husband and I really liked this recipe, though I added a bit more vinegar and sugar than the recipe called for. Quite simple to make.

This is pretty easy to make and everyone who likes German potato salad loves it. I first made it for an Oktoberfest party the year the recipe came out, and several times since. Just today searched for it again through all my (huge) collection of cookbooks and almost 20 years of Gourmet ... it is so much simpler than other recipes and, while some recipes allow for any kind of broth, the beef (I used canned) really does make it.

Not too shabby! Add some sour cream and it's downright tasty.

I have a favorite german potato salad recipe, but I tried this once since it received such rave reviews. I found it very bland - my boyfriend and I took one bite and that was enough for us.

Great recipe! It is delicious! The parsley makes it look very colorful and appetizing. I will definitely be making this one again.

Delicious! Leftovers taste even better the next day! Recipe doubles easily. I preferred it served warm rather than room temperature. Received many compliments and have made it several times already.
