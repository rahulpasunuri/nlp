This was a delicious recipe! My daughter made it using one percent milk, and omitted the nuts.

I was looking for a baked good with pumpkin and chocolate chips and came upon this. After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to cut the sugar by half and up the pumpkin by a half a cup. I also cut the butter in half, as well as the milk. AND, just to make myself feel better, I used whole wheat flour. The results were a moist, delicious, and not-too-horribly-unhealthy treat. My loaf was definitely sweet enough with a nice pumpkin flavor that sang of autumn afternoons. I'll be making this for season to come.

I made this for Thanksgiving because one of my family loves pumpkin, but hates pie, and is a chocolate fanatic. Followed the directions. Personally I was not crazy about the result. It seemed dry, and way to sweet for me. If I make this again, I would cook for slightly less time, and reduce the sugar. While I was not crazy about the recipe, all the guests thought it was great.

Very tasty! Made with fresh pumpkin and regular sized chips - reduced the sugar and left out the nuts. Perfect fall food.

I have been making this recipe every year since it was first published, it's a fall/winter staple at my house. I love that it has healthy pumpkin, yet the chocolate chips take care of my sweet tooth (I use full size choc chips, not the minis). Sometimes I sub whole wheat for half of the flour. These loaves freeze well too!

This is great. My sister makes a similar recipe and swears that it's much better the next day, so I didn't even cut into it until the following day. I used 1 C. white sugar, 1/4 c. brown sugar, regular- sized chocolate chips and no nuts (kids don't like them). It baked for 55 min and was still a bit doughy in the middle; next time I'll bake it for 60. This was terrific, and I'll absolutely make it again, maybe double and freeze it?

I am confused...... I don't see orange peel in the recipe. Was this recipe changed since it was published here?

I have made this several times, and everyone seems to want me to make it again and again. It is a really fun recipe to make with kids; they love adding the pumpkin and chocolate chips. I used a bag of finely chopped walnuts from the baking aisle and even those who don't care for nuts liked it just fine. I did omit the orange peel, just because I hate grating. The cake is delicious without it.

I was pleasantly surprised by the texture of this cake. Most pumpkin cakes are too dense for my liking, but this one is slightly fluffier. The flavors are great, too. Perfect with a big glass of cold milk.

Love this recipe! I do tweak to make a healthier version: I use a whole large can of pumpkin (29 oz) so I triple the recipe. Then I cut down the butter to total of 3/4 c. butter and make up the rest with the pumpkin and some applesauce. I also cut the sugar to total of 3 cups, and use skim milk. I make muffins ( a triple batch will make 2 pans of 12 reg muffins and 24 mini muffins.) Cooking time with such lowfat recipe is short--11 min for the mini muffins. They are so good that even the large amount disappear in my house quickly! ( I am sure the original version is probably even more delicious, but is nice that the tweaked version is good too.)

WOW.. Made if for a function last night and it was the hit of the party..However I did make some minor changes.. Added 1 1/2 cups of semi sweet chocolate chips and omitted the orange peel. For the frosting, I increased the carmel sauce by 50%.. IT was EXCELLENT..Everyone wanted the recipe and not one piece was left..

This recipe is so good, I have made this for years and years. I don't change a thing but I usually prefer making it into mini muffins instead of making the loaf cake. Don't change a thing in the ingredients, but bake for 15 minutes.

Very good - have made it for a few years now. Usually do make it in 5 mini-loafs (cook for 35 minutes) so we can give it away to friends as well. We also use skim milk, and omit the walnuts.

Wanted to use leftover pumpkin puree from Thanksgiving mousse (which came from this site and won rave reviews). Decreased sugar to 1 c. but with semi-sweet mini chips, cake was still too sweet. Wanted a bit of body so 1/4 c ground oatmeal was substituted. Will up that to 3/4 c next time. Overall, very moist and delicious.

So good. I usually don't like muffins with chocolate chips in them, but I used the mini morsels and they provide just a little bit of chocolate flavor and its just right. I used skim milk instead of whole (thats just what I had) and it tastes great. I also used a little less sugar than what is called for. I will definitely be making these again.

After searching for a pumpkin muffin recipe without finding one that I liked, I decided try making muffins with this recipe. It's absolutely amazing! I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I used a combo of 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg and allspice. It was wonderful! I've never had a muffin turn out so light and tender.

I made this for my grandparent's fall wedding anniversary and boy did they love it. I actually didn't have a bite so I can't attest to it, but they said it was wonderful (although theyn do have very simple taste). I made it in a bundt pan for presentation, and it retains a vibrant orange color, obviously from the pumpkin. I decorated it with orange-tinted sugar icing and fall cut-out cookies.

I was given a cake at the Christmas holidays in 1974 by an aunt of my husband. It was the best cake I'd ever tasted and I got the recipe. She called it Choco-dot Pumpkin Cake and the recipe called for the addition of All- Bran and to be baked in a bundt pan and finished off with powdered sugar on top. I've made that one many times over the years but it is a bit of a hassle as written so when I found this recipe I began to use it when I didn't feel like getting involved with the more complex recipe.The hook for me was the chocolate/pumpkin combination. It's really, really good. With the walnuts it just kind of covers a lot of great bases. I highly recommend that anyone wanting to make an easy, quick and addictive cake/bread; don't miss this one.

I've been making this loaf cake for two years now. I love it. I always get rave reviews, even from people who "don't like pumpkin." This is one of the things I look forward to baking most in the fall.

We made this instead of pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving this year and it was a HIT! We were fighting over how to divide the leftovers. It tastes divine- almost like gingerbread. A real treat. Will definitely save this recipe and continue making it for years to come!

This is a delicious tea bread. I made one regular loaf and a mini-loaf (35 min cooking time for mini-loaf) and both came out great. I omitted the walnuts and used regular choc chips. To prevent the chips from sinking, I tossed them with a couple teaspoons of flour before mixing in. Worked like a charm. Yum!

I have used this for a bread present this holiday season. I must say that I substituted dried cranberries for the chocolate chips (the chocolate chips were a good idea, but way too rich). The cranberries were a big hit, and the bread came out nice and fluffy and cake like. Thanks!

I've made this recipe several times as mini muffins -- use a silcone muffin pan, they fly right out! You must use mini chips, otherwise the chocolate flavor is overwhelming. Everyone loves them, they're moist and delicious although the pumpkin flavor is subtle.

I made this recipe (exactly) as a Thanksgiving dinner dessert and because my boyfriend loves pumpkin bread. He thought this was gross mainly because he doesn't think chocolate and pumpkin are flavors that mix well. Of the 12 people at dinner, no one seemed all that impressed with it. Although one person emailed me afterwards and asked for the recipe.

Really good recipe. I as well made the batter into 12 regular sized muffins and 12 mini muffins. You definitely don't need all of that sugar though. I put, maybe 3/4 cup of sugar in, plus the choc. chips, and that was really plenty sweet enough. I also used 1% milk b/c that's what I had. Very fluffy texture.

This was just ok. After 60 minutes of baking, the outside was quite brown but the center was still undercooked. My temperamental oven might have been the problem, but I would suggest lowering the oven temp to 325 degrees. Also consider increasing the amount of pumpkin pie spice.

I made this recipe as mini muffins (as suggested by previous reviewers) and they were gobbled up at a party. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I used 1 tsp cinnamon and .5 tsp nutmeg. I spaced out and put in an entire can of pumpkin filling, but the muffins had a very moist, soufflelike quality, perhaps because of the extra filling? I also used skim milk in place of whole, as that was all I had. The recipe made about 55 muffins, which I baked for 15 minutes at 350. Delish!

This was very fast and easy. I used the mini chocolate chips as suggested in the recipe and had no problem with them falling to the bottom as some bakers complained of. I did find that the exact center was a little moist so after cutting into slices I toasted the middle slice and ate it for breakfast.

I have just made this recipe with the following changes- left out the walnuts, made mini muffins instead of a loaf. They are delicious and a hit with everyone in my family. The are light and not greasy at all. The pumpkin taste is not oeverpowering and is nicely complemented by the chocolate. The recipe made 60 mini muffins, and each batch cooked in 22-25 minutes. I plan to make this again tomorrow, perhaps using a muffin top pan as well as the mini muffins.

Fantastically good, even if you're not a pumpkin lover. Very moist and keeps well for days! I love chocolate so I used regular semisweet chips and put in about 1 1/4 cups, but most of them sunk to the bottom. Maybe mini chocolate chips is the best way to go.

While this is a decent chocolate chip cake, I really couldn't taste the pumpkin very much which is what I was looking for.

Wow- this is a great recipe. I made mini muffins (I made 1 1/2 times this recipe for at least 60 mini muffins), baked for 15 minutes which was perfect, and my co workers polished them off in about 5 minutes. Very moist and such great flavor- the dark chocolate & pumpkin really compliment each other. Someone in my office actually asked to "order" 2 dozen! A great replacement for pumpkin pie if you want something new for Thanksgiving. I would make the loaf and serve it with some fresh whipped cream and a sprig of mint to dress it up a bit.

Topped with cream cheese icing - huge hit.

I liked this recipe but I think the cranberry pumpkin loaf recipe from this site is better. I also had to cook it for way longer than the suggested time, I had this problem with the cranberry pumpkin loaf as well. I see that many other cooks encountered the same problem.

The recipe was easy to follow and the mix of flavors wonderful, but after following the recipe, it was still batter in the middle when I cut into it. I used a standard 9 x 5 inch metal loaf pan, but am now confused as to whether or not I truly understood the dimensions. Where does the 1/2 inch come into play in a 9 x 5 x 2 inch metal loaf pan?

I served the cakes with a generous drizzle of Bourbon Butter Sauce (found in the recipe for Pumpkin Pecan Pie) and it was a HUGE hit! Definitely worth a repeat performance! (Hint: don't be afraid to double to recipe for the Bourbon Sauce!)Ymmmmmmmmmm!

I wanted to use up some canned pumpkin, but I didn't want to wait 70 minutes to cook the loaf, so I decided on muffins. I decreased the flour to 1.5 cups, increased the pumpkin to 1.5 cups, decreased the sugar (brown) to 3/4 cup, used skim milk, and substituted 1/2 cup safflower oil for the butter. I don't have pumpkin pie spice so I substituted 1/2 tsp cinammon + 1/2 tsp ginger + 1/2 tsp nutmeg + 1/8 tsp clove + 1/8 tsp allspice. I increased the temp to 375, and they took 22 minutes. It made 12 large muffins (they rose nice and high). They were OK, but even with my efforts to lighten them up, I found them a bit rich (almost greasy)for my taste. I think that with the extra pumpkin, 1/4 cup of oil would have been plenty. My husband thought there was too much nutmeg. Pumpkin was OK with the chocolate, but I think I would have preferred raisins or apple.

I made this as muffins, preparing the batter in the usual muffin way, with slightly less flour and butter and 2 extra-large eggs. Everything else I left the same, except for cutting the sugar down to 2/3 cup, and I think just 1/2 cup would have been fine. At 350 they cooked in just 22 minutes and were nice and moist with crisp outsides. Very good texture but I think I might prefer them with raisins or something more traditional, though I love chocolate chips.
