This was my first time making manicotti and this was fantastic. I found the directions to "add additional water if necessary" too vague though, as someone who has never made crepes. The batter needs to be really thin, otherwise it spreads too slowly and sets before you can cover the bottom of the pan. Another reviewer has already mentioned this, but there is a typo in the recipe regarding cooking the second side of the crepe (should be 5 seconds, not 5 minutes). For the filling, I inadvertently added all the mozzarella into the mixture rather than just half, but it was delicious anyway. Skipped the parsley because it's not available where I live. I used the sauce recipe from another manicotti recipe on this site (the Gourmet May 2004 one) and that turned out great. Will make again for a special meal!

I use this recipe to empty my refrigerator of leftovers. Today I made it with leftover breakfast sausage flavored with jalapenos, drained lite cottage cheese, lite mozzarella, toasted walnuts and plenty of fresh oregano. Topped with a simple plum tomato sauce with onions, garlic and fresh basil and a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese it was light and made an excellent lunch dish.

Super easy! I switched it up a bit. Added fresh basil and roasted pine nuts to filling and substituted alfredo sauce for marinara. Very rich. Does not serve 6, 4 maybe.

This was delicious! We give it 3.5, but only because we never give 4. I doubled the recipe to make 14 manicotti and added 2 cloves of garlic to the filling, which added flavor without overpowering. The crepes took a bit of time, but very easy. Excellent presentation, great taste!

This recipe was easy and worked great for a party I had. It was a 16th Birthday Party and we had about 15 people cooking in the kitchen doing different jobs. From making the crepes (which turned into a contest to see who coule flip it using only the pan) or the working as a team to make the filling, it was fun for everyone including the birthday girl.

My company loved this recipe. I added a Spicy Tomato Sauce that had crushed red peppers and it was great. Next time I would half again the recipe for the manicotti though.

first time I ever made manicotti, this was easy and a hit with my guests. I used the sauce from "Spaghetti with Tomato-Basil Sauce" and added chopped spinach and basil to the ricotta.

Tried this as a Shrove Tuesday(pancake day) dish for my 8 y.o. daughter. I changed it around a bit, having noted earlier suggestion of adding spinach. I also added a little garlic, diced bacon and a pinch of dried tarragon as well as tossing in some leftover feta. We all loved the result and I will happily cook this again.

It was good but I thought it neeed a little spicing up so I added some crushed peppers.

I have been making a dish almost like this for years(28 to be exact)and get raves from family & friends. The only thing I do that is different is to add a 10oz frozen package of thawed,chopped spinach to the cheese mixture. After thawing squeeze out all the moisture and mix in. Or you can use fresh spinach, cooked, chopped and squeezed dry.

This was the first time I ever made Manicotti and cheated on the Crepes and used store bought one...IT WAS FANTASTIC and I will make them again, that's for sure !! I didn't think the recipe needed any changing or adjusting what so ever ! Even with store bought pasta....it was PERFECT the way it is !! I CAN'T WAIT TO MAKE SOME MORE !

I made this dish according to recipe and everyone liked it. I made a variation of this by making the filling and adding hot ground sausage and stuffing it into large shells. Then I used a white cheese sauce instead of a tomato based sauce. It's no longer manicotti, but my roomates devoured this. It's there new favorite.

I make this dish often because everyone enjoys it. Easy and quick, can be made after work and my son loves to help "build" this dish. I top it with grated parmesean cheese and some parsley for a visualt touch. Melt in your mouth, Excellent!

I need DOUBLE the filling in my manicotti compared to what this recipe called for. I would suggest doubling the recipe to make the dish more decadent. It was a quick dish... easy enough to make afer work. I used a homemade sauce that I had frozen for just this type of occassion. I agree with everyone to add garlic to the filling as well. Turn the oven up to broil for the last couple minutes to give the cheese a nice bubbly browned top. Very Good and Very Easy.

These manicotti are melt-in-your-mouth delicious! I too agree side two of the crepe needs 5 seconds, NOT 5 minutes. Also, I put the entire cup of mozzarella into the filling and used parmigiano reggiano instead of romano cheese. I also topped the dish with freshly grated parm cheese instead of the mozzarella. I think this is more delicate in taste.

This was absolutely delicious. I used only Romano cheese as I had no mozzarella and part-skim ricotta, I skipped the parsley and mixed in a small amount of mashed roasted garlic and I used organic sun-dried tomato sauce. My fiance and I loved the outcome. Very easy to make. I'll definitely make this again.

Delish, with modifications. Taking an idea from "Marilyn's Manicotti", I added finely chopped procuitto. I also blended roasted garlic into both the filling and the store-bought sauce. To save on crepe-preparation time, I used egg-roll wrappers - they worked like a champ and were indistinguishable from using fresh pasta. This will become a freezer staple in my home.

Wow, what an easy recipe! Tastes great too. I made this for my wife and her parents and we all loved it. I agree with the writer who said more garlic. The only things i would change would be to add a few more minutes to the cooking time and put more mozzerella & parsley on top.

Love at first taste. This takes a while to make, but you WILL love it, and so will your guests! I put all of the mozarella in the cheese mixture, along with some extra parsley. Then, I added just a sprinkling of mozarella and parsley on top before putting it in the oven. Serve with a big salad and prepare yourself for lots of compliments! :-) I have made this twice already...

The recipe was delicious. Simple, but crepes can be a little time consuming. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil in making the crepes. I am sure there is an error in your recipe. You say to cook the second side of the crepe for 5 minutes. I certainly think you meant 5 seconds or at most 1/2 minutes. I hate to think of crepes being cooked 5 minutes. You would never get through.

This recipe was great. Served it with a nice Italian bread and a salad. Changes? One word...GARLIC! And lots of it!

I wanted to make a comment to the cook from Collinsville, IL...the next time you are feeling adventurous give the crepes a try. They really are easy to make - just a little more time consuming than using box pasta, but well worth it!

This recipe was easy and delicious! I made a few modifications. Instead of making the crepes, I used packaged Manicotti shells which I cooked according to package directions. I prepared cheese filling as instructed on the recipe, stuffed the pasta shells and baked according to recipe directions. Much easier than the crepes!

Very easy and simple to make for a novice cook. My family was definitely impressed.

Simple to make, but makes a very gourmet presentation.
