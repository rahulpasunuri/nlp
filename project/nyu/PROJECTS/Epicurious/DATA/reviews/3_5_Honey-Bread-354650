This is a great dense, slightly sweet bread. Fantastic with the corrections below.

I just had to say I made this bread again for Christmas gifts, and it turned out just as wonderful as it did the first time. I had positive reviews from the recipients.

Today I remade this recipe but added eggwhite mixed with a little water on top- then sprinkled it with rosemary- delicious.

Good. It's 2.5 cups warm water, since someone deleted it. And yes the new yeast amount is correct. 4 teaspoons, roughly. Very sticky first rise. Once floured and kneaded (just before separating the 2 balls), you'll get your usual bread dough texture. I used a bit less rosemary and honey than called for (just a titch less of each). Could put in nuts or even red pepper flakes (would that harm the yeast?). Took less long in oven than called for by 5-10 mins. And DON'T USE LOAF PANS (?!?!). Just shape it into a ball...as pictured...and bake on a greased tray. It'll be fine. It would OVERFLOW 2 loaf pans like made, each loaf is about 3 pans worth. Dunno who put this up w so many errors, but w corrections, it's delish!

Easy to make, nice balance between the honey and rosemary

Nowhere in this recipe does it tell you how much "warm water" to use! Can someone help me out, please? I'd like to try the recipe. It no longer mentions 15 T. of anything--maybe some other info was removed at the same time. Thanks!

to acbt68 from alabama: my dough was really sticky after I added the honey and after it rose, but once I started kneading and adding small increments of flour it became the perfect consistency. You just have to follow through until the dough becomes a suitable consistency. Good Luck!

I don't know but 15 tablespoons of yeast in anything sounds wrong. Please review and post the correct anount

I tried this recipe as directed today and my dough was VERY sticky. I'm not sure what I did wrong. I measured all the ingredients correctly, but obviously I messed up somewhere. BTW, I used the 2 packets of yeast as directed and totally disregarded the 15 tablespoons as a typo, so the yeast was not the issue.

I just had a chance to make this bread this afternoon, and it turned out wonderful. A beautiful aroma, crispy crust and a very tender center. Nothing was changed other than I did half whole wheat flour and half bread flour and added flax meal and wheat bran out of sheer boredom -- it didn't seem at all adversely effected. It's a wonderful, straightforward recipe that yields a delicious bread that is flexible enough to be used for either sweet or savory purposes.

I don't think it's correct to use 15 Tablespoons of dry yest for this bread recipe. One package of dry yest contains 1 Tblspoon wich means 15 dramms. So you should read either "2 pkg. for 15g each" or "2 Tblspoons" but never 15 Tablespoons!!! You would need minimum 10 kg of flour!

TO psa1121 from Charlesdton SC: To convert this for your bread machine, use the same ingredients and measurements. Just put them into the machine's bowl according to directions that came with the machine. For instance, I have the best luck with putting in wet ingredients first, including things like honey, then sugar (if it's in the recipe), then flour and last goes the yeast. This recipe looks wonderful! I'm going to try it this weekend! And Yes! 1 1/2 TBSP yeast makes sense!

I suspect the author meant 1.5 tbsp. yeast.

I agree with everyone's comments about the error in the yeast ingredient. A "packet" of yeast typically contains 2 1/4 teaspoons of yeast, although some references will say 2 1/2. Because of this discrepancy, I wish everyone would express yeast measurements in teaspoons or tablespoons, rather than packets. It would be so much clearer. For this recipe, I used 4 1/2 teaspoons. As for the bread, it is dense and heavy, but tasty. I used whole wheat flour, rather than all-purpose, which likely made the bread even heavier. My family loves to try food from around the world, so this bread was well received.

Can anyone tell me how to adapt this recipe to a bread machine? It sounds yummy. I agree with the others about the yeast ... clearly a typo. Thanks in advance. PSA1121@aol.com

I am planning on making this recipe tomorrow - but just a note - 2 packages of dry yeast is most definitely NOT 15 Tbsp... more like 5. watch that typo!

Yeast should ideally be at between 3% and 5% of the weight of the flour. 7 cups of flour weighs 28 oz (or 1-12). 2 pks of active dry yeast weighs 0.5 oz, and equals 1 Tbsp + 0.25 tsp (0r 1.0833 (1 1/12) Tbsp, not 1.5 Tbsp). 15 Tbsp yeast = 1 cup minus 1 Tbsp = 5 oz wt which is 17.9% of the weight of the flour. Also, is the rosemary fresh or dried? If it is dried, it will need to be doubled if substituting with fresh. If it is fresh, when substituting dry for fresh it needs to be cut in half. Dried herbs are more concentrated in flavor volume for volume, because of the water in the fresh herbs.
