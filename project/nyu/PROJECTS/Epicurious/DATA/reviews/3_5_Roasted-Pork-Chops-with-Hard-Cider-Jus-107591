New favorite preparation for pork chops! This is super tasty, stupidly easy, and moist. As long as you have some tasty Vermont hard cider around (we always do) and a few shallots, you've got a great main dish. We served with spiced carrots and red pepper soup - out of this world.

I used beer instead of cider and added apples slices. It was great! I had a side of asparagus and cous cous which the sause went really well with. My boyfriend gave me a standing ovation!

My boyfriend liked this, but I was unimpressed. In the future, I think I'll brave the cold and grill some brined pork chops. Or maybe I'll try cooking the pork chops in a little more cider at a much lower temperature for a longer period of time. Overall, it's oaky for a winter weeknight, but just okay.

I'm giving this three forks but felt the recipe needed some adjustments to take it from two forks to three forks. The sauce coming out of the oven was nothing special but after tossing it back into the skillet to reduce further and then finish with a bit of butter and finally some sherry vinegar it was very nice. Much better than as written - definitely needs the concentration of flavor and something to balance sweetness from the cider and shallots. My husband loved this. We had it with roasted spiced sweet potatoes but any mash would be tasty too.

This is a great and seeming flexible recipe. My whole family loved it. I substituted orange juice and champagne for the cider. Certainly not trying to be over the top but it was all we had in the house left over from a weekend celebration. I also tossed in some fresh peach slices when I put the dish in the oven. It turned out really really well. We're calling it Mimosa Pork Chops from now on. This will become a staple in our house. I will try it with some of the other variations suggested below too.

The best pork chop recipe for the middle of the winter ever. Be sure to at least double the jus because it is the best gravy for the mashed carrots and parsnips you should serve to accompany this. I originally saw the recipe in the mag and it was part of a provincial french menu including scallops with mushrooms and white wine and an apple galette - all fantastic. Browning is key and so is an oven safe thermometer to avoid the dreaded dry pork chop.

Still trying to perfect this dish. First time the chops turned out dry because my thermometer was off... second time I put too many apples in (I think the previous reviewers additon of sliced apples is great... just need to find the right balance). Have tried Guinness instead of the hard cider and I prefer the cider... I'll get it eventually..and so will you.. give this one a try, it IS good.

This was wonderful - I've made it repeatedly, and I'm making it again tonight for a friend. The flavor is wonderful. I recommend making it with the carrot and potato puree recipe that is also on this site.

didn't have any cider but I did have beer and apples.Followed the recipe but substituted the beer for the cider and threw in several slices of apples while finishing up in the oven.. UM UM GOOD!!!

This recipe is EASY and DELICIOUS! There is a lot of flavor in the sauce, and the subtleness of the shallots works really well with the cider (remember, folks, hard cider - NOT apple cider!). Definitely a keeper.

I've made this twice now and have been more than satisfied both times. While I agree this isn't a particularly flashy dish, it's good basic cooking in the French bistro style. Don't expect miracles when you make this... just expect a satisfying meal. If at all possible, avoid substituting for the shallots. The braised/roasted shallots are excellent with the pork. Also, as recommended by one of the other reviewers, the potato/carrot mash partners the pork particularly well. I don't tend to use much salt when I cook, but I found that this recipe really benefits from a health dose of it.

loved it loved it loved it. i've made this one several times for my family of nine and any one that has a large family knows how difficult it is to make something eveyone can enjoy. i've had difficulty finding sea salt so i just skipped that, and i use boneless pork chops and cut the time by about 5 mins so it doesn't dry out. i usually serve it with garlic mashed potatos instead of shallots, and brown sugar glazed carrots. yummy!

It was alright but I still prefer the cider brined chops from the September 2001 Bon Appetit issue. Although I used a thicher cut chop, I still found the brined version much more juicier.

Rating: 3
Very Very good. I think most of the issue users have with cooking times may be the difference between convection or professional ovens vs. "regular". I had convection fan on and I have a professional range and they were done in 10 mins. I can highly recommend this recipe, but I lament not being able to find good hard cider in the states. Having travelled quite a bit in the U.K. I can highly recommend Scrumpy cider if you can find it. The tastiest ciders are the cloudy unfiltered ones.

I remember my mother making hard, dry pork chops that only tasted good because of the applesauce (sorry, mom!). This permanent memory made me shy away from ever making pork chops. Then I received January's Gourmet. I actually made the entire French Connection Menu and everything was amazing, but these pork chops were divine. I mean like butter! Tender, sweet and salty and shallotty! It did take almost 20 minutes for the chops to reach temp, but well worth the effort. I also only made 4 chops but made enough sauce for 8. There would not have been enough sauce if I halved that too. Anyway the 1 fork cook on 3/11 must have done something really wrong because I found this dish to be not only easy but also absolutely scrumptuous. Definitely make the Carrots and Potato Puree to accompany. A monumental gastronomic experience!

This dish was wonderful. My very picky 12 year old daughter just devoured the chops. I have made it twice and I think it is easy enough for weekday dinner but also nice enough for company.

I appreciated the ease of this dish however, like others, found the time in the oven to be too short. I returned the chops to the pan with some jus and cooked it until the jus became caramelized and ultra yummy! Next time I may finish it with cream. My Brit husband complained that the hard cider I bought ("Ace" from CA) wasn't "real" cider but I thought it tasted great (funny how he managed to drink what was left in the bottle). I'd buy more in the future to serve with it!

The liquor store had Woodchuck, but only in raspberry, so I used regular apple cider. I thought the shallots were a pain to peel, and not worth the effort (onions would be fine). I also found that it took much longer than the 7-9 minutes indicated to reach temp. Overall it was very unexciting, and not worth the effort. For really good chops, try the cider brined ones with creamed leeks (also on this site), from chef Sanford D'Amato. Those are great!

This dish was delicious and very easy to prepare. Hard cider difficult to locate so used apple juice, and substituted boiling onions for the shallots. Also, seasoned only one side of the pork; more intense flavor with each bite.

These were OK. I like my own pork chops better. I followed the recipe to a T except doubled the sauce. It took longer to peel the shallots than anything else. If I make them again, I'll experiment a little.

Great and easy. Couldn't find bone in chops, so used very thick (1 1/2 inch) boneless. Shallots and sauce were excellent. I did use hard cider but it wasn't easy to find.. only one brand, Hornsbys, which was quite good.

They were moist so I gave them two forks. They seemed bland, ordinary, nothing special. I expected a more sweet, carmelized pork chop. These were just okay.

For all of the rave reviews, I was very disappointed with this recipe. I thought it was a bit plain. I did use the granny smith cider (I think the regular is too sweet to be enjoyable) and perhaps this was my mistake.

Cooking time for the pork chops was too long. Think next time I will skip the baking in the oven and just complete the cooking on the stove. The sauce was good though.

Wonderful - brined pork chops; subtituted cider with apple juice, calvados & red wine; doubled the shallots, chops to 145 degrees, then 10 minute tented rest resulting in 160 and very moist. Finished meat liquid with cream. A show stopper with the carrot, yukon gold & garlic potatoes.

If I do make this dish again, I will cut down on the cooking time for the chops...Pork chops were so-so, but, the shallot sauce was excellent! For that reason I would make it again.

quite tasty... i also opted to use regular apple cider out of convenience. served it fresh herbed w/new potatoes and steamed asparagus. and come on folks, lay off greg! who hasn't done a little replacement here and there based on convenience or cash on hand... if i were always a slave to the exact ingredients i'd be eating a lot less interesting meals a lot more often!

Just don't use too shallow of a pan. The deeper the pan, the more moist the chops. Very flavorable. A nice change for pork chops. And yes, use the real thing - hard cider.

Rating: 0
Hate to join the fray, but perhaps Greg was a little concerned about spending $6.50 for one cup of hard cider, when he might have no other use for the other 5.5 bottles. This might seem cheap to some, but this kind of frugality that our grandparents practiced out of necessity helped keep our planet clean. Unnecessary overconsumption is pathetic display of the nouveau middle-class.

These pork chops were wonderful...Like another reviewer, I couldn't find the hard cider, so I used apple juice. The resulting sauce with the shallots was lovely. Served with Potato Parmesan Pave and dilled carrots. Also roasted the chops a little longer than indicated.

This is a great basic recipe, but I made several adjustments. For instance, since I decided to prepare the dish for a dinner party, I used a double pork loin, coated in herbs and seared in a hot pan. For the sauce, I too had difficulty finding hard cider so I substituted with a 2 parts cider 1 part dry sherry mix. Delicious! A little bit of a slurry of chicken stock and flour helped to round the entire sauce out, so that the end result was savory and delicious. The cider really stood out. Served with tipsy sweet potatoes and sauteed spinach, a real standout!

Tasty, tender and easy. Hard cider was $6.50 a six pack. I think apple juice or regular cider would work fine. I agree with other reviewers about using more shallots and more cider to make more glace.the suggestion of using sliced apples seems interesting.

I made this recipe based on the menu given in Gourmet's January issue. Along with the "coquille st. jacques", the "carrot and potato puree",etc., from start to finish I made and entertained friends with this menu - from the amuse guele walnut and camemebert tarts to the calvados apple tart. In 3 words... TO DIE FOR, according to guests (I even placed menu cards on the table). I had guests with elaborate palates and guests that live off of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Everyone raved. The only thing I recommend is to throw a few extra shallots in - They all wanted more.

The flavor of this dish is wonderful and the meat is very tender. In hindsight I did not do the roasting in a large enough pan (the chops were touching) and as a result they got sort of steamed. I will definitely make it again and use a larger roasting pan so that the au jus will be more of a glaze, and the chops won't steam.
