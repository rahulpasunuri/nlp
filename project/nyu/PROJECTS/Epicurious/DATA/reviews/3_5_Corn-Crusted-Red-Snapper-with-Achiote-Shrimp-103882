I only made the corn-crusted red snapper part of this recipe and it was delicious. I served it with homemade mango salsa (mango, red bell pepper, red onion, green serrano pepper, cilantro, garlic, lime juice). Yummy. The snapper took longer than 2 minutes on each side to cook.

Just Wonderful! Could not find achiote paste so I heated up some achiote [annatto] seeds in oil until it took their color. Worked great. Also, used cod instead of snapper. Just WONDERFUL! One of the very best things I've ever eaten.

Cutting all the ears of corn was a pain, put the crunchy corn turned out to be one of the best parts of this dish. I subtituted Grouper and that was a mistake. You really need to use a thin piece of fish. Will trry again, this one needs practice.

I used frozen corn and it stuck to our teeth in droves- also salt and pepper the fish enough to really taste- thai is bland except for the topping-- it should be pressed and fried into the fish
