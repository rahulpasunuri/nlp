Like everyone else I found that this recipe makes way more batter than what you should use in two pans. I made the pans AND 12 cupcakes. It took longer to bake the pans than what is listed. I also added more lemon, but it still wasn't enough. If you want the lemon to pop in this cake I would add a significant amount. Other than all that, it's a good cake. Easy enough to make and very moist. A few tweaks and enjoy!

This cake was delicious and a big hit but I think it should be entitled "Ten Pound Cake". It was very heavy.

I made this cake today at an assisted living facility where I work. I doubled the recipe as I was cooking for 60 people. I added poppy seeds. I didn't have any lemon juice so I added 2 tablespoons of lemon extract. I didn't have any shortening so I substituted canola oil. I used 2 half sheet pans and it was a good thing because it really blew up in the oven. One over flowed. It wasn't bad. It turned out to be very moist. I would make this cake again and also make up my own variations. It would be good with other flavors of extract,like vanilla, almond, or orange. I think I will keep this recipe around for a long time and use it often.

I decided to make this cake as an appetizer for a birthday party. However the results were not what I expected. I am used to baking and having my baked items come out unburnt. However this was the first time I ever burnt anything. First off, I recommend that the baker use glass-ware instead of the metal. It got so bad at one point that my cakes were smoking... I've never seen anything like it before. Besides that the inside part of the cake was good after I sliced off the burnt part. At the end I say that I would make it again, however only on one condition which is using GLASS-WARE! If I couldn't use glass- ware I would discard this recipe immediatley. I would recommend this recipe to people who want to deal with a smokey kitchen, but you can save yourself from that dilema if you use glass-ware, I can't stress that enough.

Add 7T lemon juice and some additional zest for an extra lemon flavor. Use wax paper and two 9X12 pans.

I re-named this "Titanic Lemon Pound Cake" because it sank like a stone. Everyone at the office loved it anyway (though they might not be too picky about free food) but I might try a different recipe next time.

Baker beware: the overflowing cake caught fire in my oven. I haven't had a baking disaster of this magnitude since I was twelve. I did attempt to bake it in a 10 cup fluted pan, but in my defense the small half-full loaf pan I put the extra batter in spilled over as well. -ma

My cakes sunk in the middle! Does anyone have any ideas to prevent this? Thank you!

This was an absolutely excellent cake. It was devoured by my fiance and neighbors on Mother's Day. I added a bit more lemon juice and lemon peel than the recipe, just for a bit of added zing. Great! It's a perfect dessert for summer.

I thought this was wonderful! Like other readers, I added more lemon juice (7T and some additional rind) for an extra lemon flavor. This is a great spring/summer recipe to use with fresh berries. Highly recommend.

as far as pound cakes go, this was moist, dense and tasty, however, i could barely detect the lemon flavor -- the whole reason i was making this. i even added more lemonzest (as rec'd) but to no avail. i also made it in a well-buttered bundt pan. all the batter fit well, however, the cake DID NOT come out of the pan very nicely -- basically the top was ruined on 3/4 of the cake. not sure if i was supposed to flour it also? and wasnt able to put in parchment paper since the bundt was decorative (no flat surfaces). any ideas on how to get it to not stick? otherwise it was very nice tasting.

Everyone at work LOVED this recipe and it went fast. I did add more lemon rind per previous ratings and baked in 2 loaf pans. For the icing I made a thin topping with lemon juice, powder sugar and milk.

I baked this in a buttered bundt pan. It was fabulous! Because it was so tall and thick that it took about 15 mins longer at 300. Next time I will do a regular bundt pan and a loaf pan. I didn't serve it with whipped cream and berries. I don't think it was necessary. It's very good as is... very moist and perfect amount of lemony flavor. Will definitely bake again! Will bake with meyer lemon juice and zest next time! Bakers with erupted cakes - try this again. It's delicious!

Wish I had read the cooks comments before baking this recipe again. Wondering does any food scientist have a thought as to why it erupts and makes a horrible mess in my NON self cleaning oven? One reader questioned the 1T baking powder. Could that be it? Secondly, my cakes baked for 55 minutes and they were still uncooked in the sunken center :( I added 10 additional minutes to finish baking. Could the printed baking temperature be wrong, should it be more like 350 degrees for 55 minutes? Thirdly, while the lemon flavor is good, I agree with many reviewers to increase the lemon rind next time. No wonder I shy away from baking... All in all, a very good cake and I will make it again, following suggestions from others.

Wonderful Dessert! Made this cake twice, both times people loved it. The second time I added more lemon peel (don't add more lemon juice or you will be baking the cake for hours). I also add 4oz. mascarpone to the whipped topping for a little kick. As for those who had 'erupting' cakes, check to ensure you weren't using self-rising cake flour in place of all-purpose flour. The recipe calls for all-purpose and that's probably why the baking powder ratio is increased a bit.

I just came here, again, to make another copy of this recipe because I couldn't find my original copy - and I would like to share my comments. I made this for my husband's business associates visiting from Europe and they all raved - the lone woman in the group, from Holland, wanted the recipe...I think the recipe is great as is - even without the fruit and whipping cream. The cake has a "hint" of lemon and is very moist. That is the basis of a good lemon pound cake. I don't want to be overwhelmed with lemon...I want to savor the moist cake with a great cup of strong coffee...

I should have listened to the person who said it erupted like a volcano, mine is in the oven doing the same. I thought it was kind of weird when I mixed in the lemon juice and it looked like it started to rise, but hoped for the best. I only made this because I couldn't find my favorite recipe. I followed this recipe as written. Waste of the lemons I picked this afternoon!

Was very easy to make and everyone enjoyed it topped off with berries and cream. Lemon taste wasn't as strong as I would have liked, could barely taste it. Added lemon flavour to the cream to compensate. Served it with Limoncello and espresso. Next time I'll add more lemon rind.

This cake was easy and very moist. I would double the amount of lemon rind though because it was not strong enough. I added poppy seeds to the batter and it was a nice touch. I'll definitely make this one again.

My family and I really liked this cake. Don't attempt to make it if you're in a hurry. If you take your time and follow the instructions exactly, it will bake just as the recipe states. I personally would've liked a stronger lemon taste. It was very moist and tasted great. You won't be disappointed!

I made this cake this evening and was stunned at the results I got. I followed the recipe to the letter but the resulting batter filled the loaf pans and within 10 minutes in the oven, mimicked a volcano! Made a terrible mess in my oven and it just got worse from there. Did anyone else have trouble with the 1 TABLESPOON of baking powder? My other pound cake recipes call for 1/4 teaspoon baking powder to 2 cups flour. Typo? And if so why didn't someone else notice? Terrible waste of good ingredients!

I made this (among other things) for a party of 45 people and it received rave reviews. I used 1 bundt pan, 4 eggs, and substituted some sugar for brown sugar, and it still turned out perfectly moist and quite light. I will make this once again this week.

Moreover than passing my review, this recipe received 4 forks from my mother-in-law! She wants it served on her dessert buffet at their upcoming 60th anniversay party...and, THAT'S high praise!!

I thought this cake was great. The first time I made it I used a 9x13 pan and topped it with whipped cream and berries that I had soaked overnight in lemon juice and sugar. Everyone at the party loved it. The second time I made it as a layer cake, with white chocolate filling and a lemon frosting. It was also good, but I need a better lemon frosting. This is a dense, moist delicious cake!

This was very good and easy. Made a very light, spongey cake. I did increase the lemon zest a tiny bit. Although I made the berries and whipped cream as well, the cake is moist enough on its own that you really don't need it. Enjoy!

This is a nice basic reipe and easy to make. I would add more lemon in the future.
