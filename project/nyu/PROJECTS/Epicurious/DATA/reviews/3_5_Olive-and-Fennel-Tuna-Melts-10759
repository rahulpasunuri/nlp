I can't give this a star rating because I made a huge change, but wow, it was delicious! I thawed some frozen albacore, then poached it in olive oil and a few lemon slices, flaked, and continued with the recipe, subbing olive oil mayo for regular mayo. With this technique, it was absolutely delicious. If it had been regular quality canned tuna, I think I would have needed more parsley, as well as some pepper. I highly recommend this way of doing it if you want to make this fancy.

I have fennel-haters in the house, so I used celery. Great sandwich,although I might want to try Italian country bread next time.

I made this today for a late lunch. A great alternative to a plain tuna melt. I added a bit more of the parsley, olives, lemon juice and fennel because the flavor of the tuna is pretty strong. I also used black pepper and whole wheat bread. I added a toasted piece of bread on top. Really delicious. My boyfriend is a bit of a food snob and he loved this.

Well, as usual I can not follow instructions. I used smolked tuna, added seeded dijon mustard and capers. Used Ciabatta bread, topped with thinly sliced tomatoes and swiss cheese. Very tasty.

I've made this several times now. I have begun adding more olives, a few anchovies, and a tbl. or two of Pernod to taste. It is a quick and easy lunch meal that brings canned tuna to a new level. I also make the pan bagnat also on this site that is a level above this when fresh ingredients are available.

I followed the simple directions to the letter and wowed 10 people with these sandwiches. What a perfect recipe.

I am kosher and a nice sharp cheddar was not available so I added a bit of parmesean into the mix and topped with Edam. I used a few more olives as mine were rather small. It was awesome!

Tasty tuna spread. I used a LOT more kalamatas, (I'm an olive fiend) and a generous sprinkling of black pepper and lemon pepper. Might be nice with a different cheese - feta, perhaps...?
