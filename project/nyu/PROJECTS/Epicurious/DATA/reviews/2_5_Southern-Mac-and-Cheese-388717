There are many variations on the mac and cheese theme. I did not find the flavor of this one to be worth the effort or expense of trying to do something special. Although I have only done so once, I would prefer to shred the heels of whatever cheese i have in the fridge like jack, parmesan, gruyere and sharp cheddar and play around with those variations. I'm sure this recipe will make some people happy, just not me.

Try using an American cheese called Cooper Extra Sharp, you can find it at Big-Y and Wal-Mart Deli's. It's super creamy and smooth and will taste great!

You may want to check the America's Kitchen recipe for this - they suggest combining Monterey Jack with cheddar so that the cheese doesn't separate into oily puddles and whey. It works really well.

I just don't like american cheese, so could I sub cheddar? And I'd add some cayenne, I think...

Due to the advent of changes in cheese making some American cheese is now a processed cheese food product. I suggest you use a solid cheddar or your favorite cheese ! personally I like white cheddar Mac and cheese is a comfort food and use your favorite cheese and the added chicken base or broth I learned secret from a southern cook 40 years ago omit the salt or only add salt to taste adding chicken base or broth enhances the flavor adjust by switching to half and half and using about 1 1/2 cup and 1 and 1/2 cup broth no pepper use turmeric instead 1/2 tsp and 1/2 tsp mustard powder I prefer my original recipe

I actually made this for Super Bowl party and it was good. I wasn't sure what type of American cheese to use the white or yellow and used white American cheese. I baked it for 40 minutes which i think is a little too long as it was on the drier side and not creamy. I will try it again and check after 25 minutes of baking. It is your typical mac & cheese dish not too spicy, but next time would try using yellow american cheese to see if it a little more flavorful and cheesier.
