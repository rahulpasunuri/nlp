Both my husband and I LOVED it. I definitely put more vinegar in. Maybe more salt, can't remember. Many reviewers said it was great once they added sugar, but we didn't feel it needed any at all, and we are major sugar addicts. Could be because coming from a CSA, our cabbage was biodynamic  as local, high quality, and as recently-picked as can be, so it may have more natural sweetness than what you'd buy in a supermarket. Cook it exactly as much as the crunch or lack of crunch as you want. I'll make this again and again.

Although this is probably an autumn/winter dish, I got a small head of red cabbage in my CSA share this week, along with a few leaves of kale. I sliced them both and had barely 7 cups, so I halved the recipe. I used hard cider and cider vinegar, as well as a pinch of demerara sugar. This was a really nice, balanced side dish. For those who said it was bland, don't be afraid to add more salt. That brings out the other flavors. Too many Na-phobes in this country!

Love this. I served this to my parents and sister (who only eats pizza), and they loved it. It's my favorite way to eat red cabbage. Easy to remember on the fly, which is key when you're looking for something to eat on a weeknight.

I used 1/2 the butter recommended, subbed apple sauce for the hard cider, added 1 tsp of honey and it came out great. Easy recipe that I'll make again and again.

This came out perfect, not too crunchy, not too mushy. Followed advice of others and added some sugar, it rounds out the dish very well.

this has become one of my stand-bys! very good and simple. i cut way down on the butter though, about by half, otherwise it is just really greasy.

This recipe was very easy to make. I don't find it bland at all. I used port wine, balsamic vinegar, and added a little brown sugar. It's delicious.

This made a great side dish. I used 1/4 stick butter a half hed of cabbage. I liked the taste but next time may add more vinegar and try some sugar. Don't be shy with the salt and pepper.

REALLY RICH and good. However, as another reviewer said, you'd probably just want to serve it as a SMALL side dish. I did this a little differently--because I couldn't find the recipe when I was cooking it. I put the 1/4 stick butter in the iron pot, sliced the small head of cabbage as thin as I could with a knife and let it cook. Added some salt and pepper along the way and 2x added some super cheap wine (all I had). Cooked it on low for probably 1.5 hours stirring here and there. Never burned, came out great.

This was a very rich tasting dish...too much so. The first few bites were good, but then we couldn't eat anymore.

I made it first as directed in the recipe and found it lacking something, so I took the advice of several other reviewers and added more vinegar and some brown sugar. That really made it tastier. Because of the changes, I'm giving two forks, but it tastes closer to a three. I should also add that, while I wasn't very impressed, my family commented on how good it was.

I was inspired to make braised red cabbage after a visit to Hungary. This recipe needs way more vinegar. I added about 6 tablespoons of cider vinegar and 1 TBS of sugar. Also don't be afraid to add plenty of salt at the end. Came out fine with these additions but otherwise would have been very bland.

Absolute delicious comfort food! I used red wine and red wine vinegar, and added a couple T brown sugar and granny smith apple towards the end. I usually avoid red cabbage but I could eat this whole recipe by myself. The butter and brown sugar add a special taste & texture so it does not taste like you're eating vegetables. Some people commented that it was too cruncy or too mushy. I followed the cooking times exactly and found the texture to be perfect. Very yummy!!

I've already reviewed this, and by no means am I a chef. But after coming back and seeing the cooks talk about blandness... perhaps they're forgetting a very interesting ingredient called.... Salt! Seriously, if you want this recipe to taste good just add salt and red wine vinegar and it'll taste great.

I didn't care for this recipe. Seems like wilting the cabbage in butter gave it a greasy coating that I believe also inhibited the cabbage from assuming the wine and cider flavors. Even after adding caraway seeds, the dish was, well, greasy and bland.

This is good, easy recipe. I used Lambrusco Reggiano and red wine vinegar. I finished it with a little goat cheese on top. YUM!

This is boring red cabbage. I have a recipe which uses these ingredients plus: cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and brown sugar. Much better!

Very good and easy - I added nothing at all and followed the recipe. An easy recipe to make with ingredients that are likely on hand. I used half a head of cabbage and that fed two - so I'm not sure about the portion size.

Great cabbage. I cooked significantly longer than suggested as we were looking for a softer cabbage. Finished with another T. of butter. Will definitely be making again soon.

Very good and easy. I added more vinegar and 3 Tsps brown sugar and about 1/2 teaspoon carroway seeds. Delish!

thought this was delicious. added a touch of sugar and didn't cook it as long as the recipe called for because i like my cabbage to have a bite to it.

What do you do with a small crop of fresh red cabbage? My wife & I both enjoyed it, and I left it slightly crispy (soggy cabbage is no fun). Went great with chops, would probably be really good with saurbraten. I did the pinch of sugar as well.

I would make this dish again with the edits given by other reviewers. It's dull without more vinegar and several tsps. of sugar. Also needs additional salt. But it is a lovely dish when livened up! Easy and great to do ahead. We're having goose for Christmas, and braised red cabbage is an almost essential side dish.

Yummy! I would like it a little more sweet and sour...but as is was great. I followed the recipe exactly and my husband had seconds.

My wife and I love it! If you like cabbage, no reason not to love this dish. Eat it with some corned beef, mmmmm....

This has become one of my favourite recipes for red cabbage. It's important to slice the cabbage finely, as advised, and I like apple balsamic cider best for its sweetness. If I have a surplus of eating apples I will also add some of these, again, thinly sliced. Declicious with pork meatballs.

If I could give it zero forks I would. We did not eat it. BLAH!

This was surprisingly good. I did tweak it a little to suit my taste. I used 2 tbsp of red wine vinegar and added 4 tsp of sugar. I was also very generous with the salt and pepper. This recipe is good for those who like their cabbage a little toothsome. It's a great one to play around with, though, as you can braise it longer if you like your cabbage more wilted and there are other great add-ins you can use like chopped onion and sauteed apple chunks or whatever suits your fancy. This can be kept simple or jazzed up. It's a keeper.

Who would have thought that red cabbage could taste so good? I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added 2 teaspoons of sugar when the vinegar went in, to good effect. I'll definitely make this dish again.

An easy recipe without a lot of ingredients. I was able to make a few hours ahead and then re-heat just before serving. Everyone loved it! I served with a dollop of goat cheese on top - Yum!

I thought this was a good starting point, but next time I will use a tablespoon less vinegar and add a teaspoon of caraway seeds. I made the apple cider/apple cider vinegar combo.

Super good!!! I used I can't believe its not butter, and used Lambrusco instead of dry red wine. It was fantastic. Also, I topped it with goat cheese. Excellent dish.

This is a fantastic dish - really one of my favorites now. I used organic cabbage. Such a smooth taste. Delicate yet full of flavor and gorgeous color. I will make this dish again and again.

I was very pleasantly surprised. I scaled the dish down to four cups of shredded cabbage and was very pleased. The texture was just right, I think the cooking time was perfect. Will keep this one on file for sure. Actually, it's already in the mind file.
