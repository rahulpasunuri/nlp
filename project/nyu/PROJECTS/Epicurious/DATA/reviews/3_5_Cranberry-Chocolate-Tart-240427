Great with Thanksgiving dinner. I had a beater malfunction that splattered cream and mascarpone around the kitchen so I added some cream cheese and more cream to make up for the loss and it set up well. Added nutmeg for flavor. Cranberries were too tart so added more sugar. Probably cranberries need adjusting after cooked due to differing tartness. Crust baked up very well. a keeper.

I made this last year for Thanksiving and this year for New Years. Both times, it was a big hit with all our guests. You can tell it is a hit when guests sneak back to the kitchen for a sliver more. This year, I skipped the extra candied ginger on top, and it was just as good. I'll make this guest-pleaser again.

Overall tasted good. However, the recipe had a few crucial flaws. I made the filling according to the recipe, beating it to stiff peaks, then refrigerating overnight before adding it to the shell. The filling became runny overnight, and could not hold up the rather heavy, stiff cranberry topping, so the cranberries essentially sank to the bottom. If I could do it over again, I would omit the gelatin from the cranberries but add it to the mascarpone filling to add more structure.

So easy and a real crowd pleaser.

Unique and strong flavors make for happy people in my family! (Most of 'em, anyway...) This tart is lovely. As an experiment, I made one tart with cream cheese and the other with marscarpone. I am usually one for the "fancier" ingredients, but I preferred the extra tang of the cream cheese. Hubby was the opposite. When asked (at the last minute) to make this again for a family gathering, I purchased an Oreo cookie crust and omitted the ginger on top...and it was still a huge hit. Plus, as an added bonus, this dessert is absolutely beautiful plated!

I made this for thanksgiving one year, and christmas the next. This is so easy to make, pretty and delicious. Cranberry juice cocktail is the way to go. The second time, I bought an all natural organic juice from Trader Joes which was really tart, and the topping wasn't as good. Tip: Add the ginger just before serving, otherwise it'll absorb the cranberry color and you won't be able to see it.

Ugh, what a horrible greasy mess was the crust! 5-6 T butter is way too much - all my other recipes call for 4 T with 1 1/2 cups cookie crumbs, and I should have followed that.

I made this tart for Thanksgiving this year, and it was a huge hit with my family. Instead of the lemon, I used orange zest and juice, still awesome! I didn't have any problems, I made everything the night before and put it together that morning and by that afternoon it was perfect.

Incredibly easy to make and quite pretty to look at. I only had an 11 inch tart pan and was dismayed that I hadn't taken the time to find a 9...it needs the extra cookie crust to balance it out. It went over well at Christmas dinner but was not a WOW like the Cranberry Chocolate Torte. Still, so easy and yummy.

This is a keeper recipe, but I've made changes. Instead of cranberries I used carmelized pears and everyone raves about it!

I really liked this- so pretty and easy! Unlike other reviewers, I had no trouble whatsoever with the filling setting up, overcooking the cranberries or the cranberries covering the tart. The textures are great. I thought it was perfect, though my boyfriend thought the cranberries were a little sweet.

delicious!!!! made it atleast 5 times this holiday. the marscapone filling is soooooo good. for the cook from georgia make sure all of your ingrediants are cold and just whip it in the mixer.

This was super good and a nice change from the more traditional holiday desserts. Definitely let the cranberry topping gel up before putting it on the tart. Being slightly impatient, I didn't and I ended up with a bit of a soggy tart. But even with the sogginess, this tart was the first dessert to be devoured. A big hit! (For problems with the sweetness or tartness of the topping, I think it depends if the cranberry juice you are using is unsweetened or "cranberry juice cocktail". I used the unsweetened for that extra cranberry punch and then added a little extra sugar because the unsweetened juice is tangy.)

I've made this twice and each time had trouble getting the marscapone filling to set up enough in order to spread the Cranberry topping on it. Both times I've frozen it before topping and then refrigerated a few hours prior to serving. I love the combination of flavors and textures and want to do again. Can anyone clue me in on how to get the filling to set?? Less cream, gelatin in the marscapone??

The tart was a hit at my book club holiday party. The leftovers held up well, too. I cut back on the sugar as other reviewers suggested. Although I made extra cranberry topping, I'm not sure I needed it, as I had quite a bit left (which is yummy plain!).

I made this at Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit, so I decided to make it again for Christmas for another group. Due to family preferences (LOL), I used just fresh ginger, no crystalized ginger and added the zest of one orange. It tasted as wonderful as it did the first time. This tart is so pretty on the table. I am going to do this tart again during the summer and add simple berries to the top of the mascarpone filling...that filling is the single best part of this tart!

Delicious! Made this for Thanksgiving and used a gluten free crust. I can imagine the chocolate crust is divine, but no one complained (especially not my husband, who is allergic to gluten) about the substitution. Will definitely make again. Took other reviewers advice about the cranberry cooking time.

Made this for Thanksgiving. I didn't have any trouble with the crust or mascarpone filling as directed, but the topping was way too tart for me and most of my guests. No one asked for seconds. The ginger was the perfect amount--not too gingery. Don't overcook your cranberries!

Rating: 4
Loved this recipe. I won a dessert contest with this today. Lovely mix of sweet and tart and the chocolate crust. I did not whip the mascarpone and cream enough the second time so it was not as pretty as the first time I made it. Don't cut the ginger; it adds to the unique flavor of the cranberry topping. I thought the proportions were fine.

Very good mix of flavors. It was made 2 days before and the flavors did blend. As others have said-the cranberrys will pop if cooked too long. Five minues should do it. One last comment. I did not add all of the ginger to the cranberries. I stopped at 2 tbl spoons and it was still very good. I kept all of the indredients as is and I did notice that the amt of cheese filling could have been increased slightly. This is one that I would make again.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and while I did have some problems with the recipe, the tart was still delicious and I'm definitely making it again! I didn't have enough cranberry topping, so I plan on making 1.5 times the amount for next time. I also ended up with a thin cheese filling, but I figured I didn't beat it long enough. I was afraid of the cheese curdling, as mentioned in the recipe. The combination of the tart cranberries and the sweet filling is wonderful! I didn't find the cheese filling to be overly sweet though.

i hate ginger, so i used orange peel instead. on the top, i sprinkled zested orange peel in a circle around the edge; the tart looked lovely. had no problem with the crust, the filling, or the topping--it looked like a scrumptuous dessert. i have a similar recipe for a cheesecake with chocolate crust and cranberry topping, also from bon appetit archives; we think we prefer that dessert to this one, altho this one was festive and tasty.

Yum! This was a hit for the Thanksgiving crowd and I think I'll make it again at Christmas. People loved it. I had no problems, it was picture perfect - though I didn't put the candied ginger on top - I liked the flavor without it.

I had no problem with the crust (pretty standard), and the cranberry topping was a keeper for possibly a cheesecake, or for ice cream. But the filling would not set up at all! I don't know if I didn't mix it enough, but was afraid of the "curdling" that the recipe warned about. After chilling the filling in the crust for 4-5 hours, I finally portioned the crust/filling into parfait glasses in two layers, with the cranberry topping interspersed, then topped with a dab of sweetened whipped cream and a few candied ginger strips. Our company loved it, but it was a pretty stressful dessert. What did I do wrong?? Sandy

A keeper definitely - but,as noted, I adjusted the sugar in the mascarpone. My solution was to use 1 tbsp baking-type Splenda and 2 tbsp fruit sugar (fine granulated)to avoid the unpleasant starchy taste of powdered icing sugar. Also modified the crust with slighty less butter. Thanks to all those who offered hints, mine was a success.

Rating: 4
Not sure what went wrong for everyone else, but mine turned out perfectly - I did make more cranberry topping than the recipe called for so I got good coverage. The crust came out of the pan perfectly, and it was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving dinner - such a success that I made another the next day to give away.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely fabulous - BUT I modified the recipe. First, I bought a a store-bought crust. Second I made sure that I chilled my mixer bowl prior to blending th marscapone (thanks hoodwink80). Third, I left out half of the crystallized gingered. I made everything the night before - and a big warning - make sure you take the Cranberry Topping out of the fridge early enough so it can cool enough so you can spoon onto of the filling - about 2 hours and then put back into the fridge to chill.

I was kind of surprised by how this turned out. This is the first Epicurious recipe that just fell flat. I followed the instructions, but the crust fell apart and the filling was a bit too thin. The cranberry topping was perfect, but I could have used a little more.

I made this for Thanksgiving and was pleased with how well it turned out. It was so pretty! And the crust was perfect- I used about 5.5 TBLs of butter for it. However, my family did not like it at all. They thought the cheese filling was too sweet and the cranberries were too tart.

Made 2/3 of this recipe: the chocolate crust & the creme filling. Opted to top it with caramelized pears instead, so cannot comment on the cranberries. As for the crust, only about 80% came out of the form ok; the rest disintigrated into a mess. It did, however, taste quite nice. I used about 5 TBS butter, as I was afraid from other reviews that 6 TBS would make it too hard. So, perhaps 5.5 TBS would be about right. The marscapone creme filling was very nice - I hate the taste of eggs, so this was a great alternative to typical pastry creme.

Eh. The cheese filling was to sweet - too much of a confectioner's sugar taste (like frosting). The ginger too much, the cranberries too tart. Nothing subtle about this.

They should really name this "Cranberyy-chocolate-ginger Tart" as, the ginger, both fresh and candied have a significant impact on the flaor of this dessert. I listened to the wanings of other reviewers and made a little more of the cranberry toppoing, but in the end, I felt like it somewhat ovewhelmed the dish. Still delicious, however, and a big hit. I may make it again, but I will use slightly less cranberries ...

Fantastic. This is a fantastic alternative for pumpkin pie at T-giving, and would make a festive dessert at Christmas. It was hard for me to find a 9 inch tart pan, so I used an 11 inch and hoped for the best. There was plenty of cream filling and crust (used PF Chessman cookies), but the cranberries didn't cover the top as in the photo, so I artfully spread them about and I think it actually looks better with some white peeking through. You could make this with a variety of fruits, too. I am think of trying it with cherries when they come in fresh over the summer.

Very delicious. Everyone loved it. It looked exactly like the picture. I listened to the other reviews and did not cook the cranberries for more than 5 minutes so they remained plump. However, the crust was a bit too hard. Next time I make it I will use less butter. I used 6 tablespoons which was too much and may have caused the hardness. Otherwise, a fabulous, easy recipe.

I experienced similar issues as noted below - overcooked the cranberries, but didn't affect the taste only its appearance. Overall, the tart received rave reviews. Be ware when cooking the crust. I found 14 minutes to be too long (more like 10 min) and I nearly burnt it.

This was a simple dessert to make. I didn't have a 9" tart pan so I used a 9" springform pan instead and it came out beautifully. Brought it to my Mom's house for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. Everyone loved it and wants me to make it again. This receipe is a keeper!

This is a stunning dessert for the holidays. I found that by using the frozen cranberries I was able to have better control over not "bursting" the cranberries. Cooking on a low heat and watching carefully will ensure whole berries are retained. I did not have cranberry juice and used pomegranate juice instead and it was just delightful. This will become one of my favorites !

Rating: 3
Great tart, got rave reviews. I agree with the other reviewer - if you cook the cranberries even a little too long, it becomes more of a jelly and less pretty like it is in the picture. Also, I'd suggest making more than the recommended amount of cranberries - the 12oz did not cover all of the mascarpone filling along the top. Its very easy to overcook the crust because its so dark that you can't tell its burning. My cranberries were VERY tart, which was a nice contrast to the sweetness of the crust and mascarpone. I whipped the mascarpone and cream by hand, and it came out beautifully. I think an electric mixer here might be overkill.

Great recipe! Instead of the chocolate wafers, I used Oreos and eliminated the sugar from the crust. I overcooked the topping, the cranberries burst and it made the topping runny. Cook the topping no more than 5 minutes. Instead of the expensive mascarpone, I used cream cheese and it was delicious. Ive been asked to make it for Thanksgiving.

Rating: 3
Following the recipe exactly, I found the crust and mascarpone filling easy to do and delicious. Be careful not to overcook the cranberries, because if they split then the topping becomes more of a cranberry sauce than the beautiful top in the photo. I fund the cranberry mixture much too sweet; next time I would replace the juice with water and halve the sugar. The reason for 3 forks: crust and filling are so sweet that the top rally needs to be more tart.

Rating: 4
Beautiful and a snap to prepare. I couldn't find chocolate wafer cookies so I processed most of a package of Pepperidge Farm Chessmen cookies. It tasted great! I made the components 2 days before the party and assembled the tart the morning of the party. Great make ahead, fancy dessert!

Great combination of flavors. I cheated by using a store-bought crust (chocolate cookie crumb), but it still looked fancy and got rave reviews. I didn't have any runniness problem with the mascarpone filling. whipped it with other ingredients on high setting with chilled mixer and bowl.

This is a fantastic dessert but a tad sweet for my taste. I'd eliminate the sugar in the cookie crust, and use less in the cranberries. Also, you don't need cranberry juice in the topping--water would probably do just as well. The recipe only used half the container of mascarpone, so make 2 while you're at it!

Rating: 2
I think the cranberries could use more sugar. The mascarpone was delicious, but kind of runny. I didn't know how to interpret the admonition against over-beating the mascarpone. Was I supposed to beat it longer until it thickened? I think I should have cooked the cranberries longer, but was afraid they'd go mushy

The tart looked great and tasted just as good EXCEPT for the crust which had too much butter and baked up hard. I would make this tart again but with a different crust.
