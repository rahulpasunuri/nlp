Great, easy to make salad. I slice my cucumbers and onion paper thin on a Mandolin. I used .25 tsp cayenne, 1/3 c. Mirin and 1/3 c. Rice Wine Vinegar. Kept the sugar the same. Friggn' awesome.

Everyone liked this recipe... I think I will try a little less sugar and perhaps a tad more cayenne next time. It does get better the longer it sits, I'd say give it a full 24 hours before serving.

Right, there is only so much you can do with a cucumber :-) This is good though......everyone in my family liked it. I kept the vinegar and sugar as is but next time I might use less sugar. Cayenne added just the right zing for us.

I'm with Mr. Richmond. Look, there's only so much you can do with cukes: fry 'em (superb, with lemon); or salad 'em, which means salting to drain, then something acidic (vinegar; wine works; add some mustard, for texture and flavor, if you like); herbs, most importantly dill. Ok, I also like yogurt. But this is the perfect do-it-yourself dish. Just have fun.

I kept the sugar the same but only used 1/2 the onion. I think this is a great refreshing salad! Perfect with lamb burgers.

Nothing different about this except the cayenne, which did not do it for us. Would rather have the standard salad or something a little cooler with yogurt.

Try this with Cilantro! Very good dish. The best example I've had of an old standby. I increased the sugar to 1/3 C per the other reviews and this was about right. The addition of about 1t of finely chopped fresh cilantro was a great addition. Super fresh taste! I also used 2 cukes and no carrots (personnel pref). I added cucumbers to the left over marinade after we ate it all and I got an instant 2nd batch.

Wow, what a combination, I doubled the cayenne pepper. The spice of the peper mixed with the cool taste of the cucuber was out of this world. I will be making this again.

I thought this was tasty and easy. Loved the cayenne. I also added some fresh mint, which made it good. I definitely recommend using two cucumbers and two carrots. I ended up with a lot more onion than cucumber, and plenty of extra marinade.

This is excellent salad. I agree with previous reviewers - do add more sugar. Also, I used regular cucumbers and it was great. I used the amount of cayenne listed in the recipe and found it almost too hot. Next time I'll use a trifle less.

My mother made something similar to this, but without any sugar. It was simply cucumbers, slices onion and halved cherry tomatoes tossed together. Then half cidar vinegar and water (enough to cover the cucumbers). Let sit at least over night, 2 days is better. Simple and easy. It great on a hot summer day.

I used the red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne pepper and the listed amount of sugar--it turned out wonderfully! i think if you add more sugar, it will be too sweet. this dish is a nice complement to satay.

Wonderful! I have made it with the suggested amount of sugar, and doubled. Great both ways. For a quick, light soup, I add the vegetables and a bit of the sauce to low sodium chiken broth.

Everyone is correct! Double the sugar and add a pinch more ceyenne for better flavor.
