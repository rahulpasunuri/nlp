This looked delicious, but ended up too subtle because of the predominance of butter. To serve 4, I used 1# large shrimp, 1/3 c. grated ginger, 1/2 c. marsala, 1 stick butter, 1/2c chopped cilantro, and ~1/2 t. red pepper flakes, and small grinding of salt. Served it over cous-cous c peas and asparagus, and a salad of baby greens, avocado, and grape tomato. Next time, for that amount of butter, I'd up the ginger, marsala, and cilantro to 3/4 c. each, add more salt and black pepper, and (depending on the audience) consider doubling the red pepper flakes and adding a few cloves of garlic.

I thought for how easy this recipe was that it was fantastic. I will definitely make more sauce next time. I think it would make a great appetizer or party food,too! You could easily multiply the recipe for a large dinner party. This will be going in my rotation!

Another super tasty but super simple suggestion, the shrimp were bursting with flavour (despite us having no Sherry and having to bring in a bizarre sub in the name of Rose!). Mmm.

easy & good...not sure where in the recipe the previous reviewer obtained the 3 tsps of ginger from...it states 1 1/2 tsps.

Am surprised no one questioned the amount of ginger used. I made this for my wife and used just two teaspoons of ginger (Not three) but it was just too much for us. Next time - and there will be a next time - I will cut the ginger to one t. and see how that is.

I thought this recipe was very good and easy. I doubled the sauce like many other reviewers, but next time would add even more Sherry/vermouth because I still ended up with too little for dipping. I used 8oz shrimp, 1-1/2 T butter, 1 T ginger, 1/4 c dry vermouth, and 1/4 c cilantro. The vermouth I had on hand was a good substitute for the sherry.

Easy + quick. It was nice, but the flavors lacked the "WOW Factor" for what we attribute to a 4-fork dish. Sherry was fairly subtle, not adding a big flavor. Fresh cilantro and ginger gave the dish a light, fresh flavor. Added a hint of garlic in the last minute of sauteing the shrimp. I served over angel hair pasta, accompanied with a toasted baguette seasoned with Parmesan-garlic. When I make this dish again, I will experiment with the ingredients... maybe adding a dab of sour cream or heavy cream. Any ideas?

My husband and I always joke that we could drink the sauce. Always a big hit when it's made. This is a staple in our meal rotation.

Good, tasty recipe. I like it over rice, it's a nice scampi alternative. I do think doubling the sauce is a good idea!

Took the advice of many and doubled the sauce. I also added lots of crushed red pepper, one clove of garlic and a little white cooking wine. It was incredibly easy to make and my guests loved it!

I doubled the sauce as suggested, and next time I will add more hot red pepper flakes because we like these dishes spicy. It was a really nice to cook shrimp as an alternative to my few recipes -- so I will definitely keep, but tweak a bit.

This was a nice new way for me to use shrimp. I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce -- we had no leftovers for 2 of us. Not the OH YEA, but a nice shrimp alternative. I will make it again and maybe add a bit more hot red pepper.

Excellent and so easy. Double the sauce. Served over angel hair pasta.

An excellent combination of flavors. I did not add the cilantro and it was not missed. I added hot pepper flakes for extra kick. Delicious!

Wow, this was super fast, easy to make and really yummy! I added some arugula when I added the cilantro, tasty.

I have made this many times, it being one of my favorites. Everyone always wants the recipe! I use a mix of shrimp & scallops and serve it over fresh spinach topped with fresh grated parmesan cheese & cracked black pepper. It is absolutely delicious and is fast & easy to prepare. Serve with crusty 7 grain rolls-makes a great lunch or dinner!

this was pretty delicious, and simple, however i added a touch of cayenne to give it a little kick. and whaleback from portland.. if citric acid is so dangerous, i assume you abstain from consuming citric fruits.. i mean, i know you said it out of concern, but get your facts straight.

Absolutely delicious! And to whaleback from Portland...please get a grip. The spread product you accuse of having hydrogenated oils, in fact does not. Besides, if you're that freaky about cholesterol, you should probably worry more about eating the shrimp. And just because it comes from cows, butter is NOT healthy, but in moderation is fine. And de-lish! Foodies don't need paranoid advice about what they're eating.

Regarding all the butter-phobes: Doesn't it make more sense to go ahead and have the butter with this dish--because a substitute will ruin it--and eat a little lighter the next day? Healthy living is all about moderation, not depriving yourself. Besides, butter is a natural product, while Benecol was created in a lab somewhere. Enjoy your food. If you cook just for sustenance, then why are you on this website?

Outstanding! Fast, easy and delicious. I added a lime wedge to each serving plate, but otherwise did not change a thing and would recommend this dish highly as written.

This came out extremely well! I followed the recipe and served it over noodles and it was a hit with the boyfriend. I will definitely make this again.

Don't use Benecol!! Use what the recipe states; healthy natural butter from cows. Benecol is loaded with dangerous ingredients like citric acid, partially hydrogenated oils, etc. VERY unhealthy!!

This dish was so easy to prepare. I wondered about the absence of garlic, and some of the "bland taste" reviews that I read, but frankly, it turned out to be a very fresh and clean tasting delight. I did not miss the garlic (although I might try adding some next time).

This is a very easy, very tasty recipe. I served it over soba noodles.

I doubled the recipe for dinner with 4 friends & significantly decreased the butter. I probably only used 3 tablespoons for 2 pounds of shrimp. It was very easy & tasty - a nice last minute thing to whip up.

Rating: 3
Definitely a keeper -- and you DO NOT need to use so much butter. I used 1 lb of shrimp, 2 tablespoons of butter, 3 teaspoons grated ginger, 4 tablespoons sherry and 4 tablespoons cilantro. It was quite nice as a dinner wtih good whole grain bread, steamed green beans, and a tomato and basil salad from the garden. Also, a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc.

Do not skimp on the butter,your not just sauteing the Shrimp in it but making a SAUCE. A benecol sauce is not quite the same.

Rating: 3
Totally easy. The ginger makes it more 'unique' than plain sauteed shrimp. Cut back on the butter if you want --but hey, once in awhile you have to live it up! Don't forget the sherry. My youngish kids love this.

I am going to try it using Benecol. So the butter will not be all bad.

I prpared this for lunch today, and though i am not a ginger spice fan, it was an excellent lunch dish. The recipe is a good one that has a lot of options to use in it and with it.

for the person who complained about the amt of butter: you can use 1TBSP if you like, and you don't have to "sop up" the buttery sauce with the baguetter per the suggestions if you don't want to. I actually added some green peas when i added the ginger, used 1 TBSP of butter, added 1 TBSP of white wine vinegar at the end and poured the whole thing on top of some baby spinach...yummy, and not too unhealthy!

2 tablespoons of butter for 1 serving? That leaves me out for trying this one, which otherwise sounded liked a tasty simple dish. And, I'm sure it wouldn't be the same with just 1 tablespoon

I prefer this to shrimp scampi. The sauce compliments the shrimp where as the garlic over powers the shrimp in scampi most times. Tripled the recipe and didn't get the glaze that the picture showed so will make it again in a smaller batch.

Used a few scallops as i did not have enough shrimp. About all i can say about this dish is it kept me from starvation. Don W. Lawndale CA
