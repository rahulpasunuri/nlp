This was delicious- especially the syrup(added extra lime juice to suit my taste). For the tapioca, I used small, Thai, seed tapioca and cooked it for about 15 minutes. Also, I used canned mango, but next time will wait to prepare when fresh mango is available since the canned was too mushy. Excellent with some canned coconut milk drizzled on top.

We thought this was delicious. Reminded us of time spent in Hawaii...

I had self inflicted technical difficulties with this recipe. I added the tapioca to the water and boiled it all together, used too small of tapioca, and didn't have the right strainer ... and lost a bunch in the sink. I followed the rest of the recipe (it was really loose) and realized it wouldn't be a pudding at all. I ended up adding a half a can of coconut milk, and made more of a soup. I served it as a desert soup when it was extremely chilled, and everyone loved it. The taste was amazing ... and I can't wait to make it correctly next time.
