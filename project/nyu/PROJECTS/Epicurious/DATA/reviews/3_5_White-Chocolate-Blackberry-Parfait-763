I have been making this recipe for my annual holiday party and it always disappears (I quadruple the recipe and serve in a trifle bowl) My recipe, however, calls for the water to go in the bottom of the double boiler, not in the top with the chocolate. It is never grainy and always turns out perfect.

Easier than pie! I thought I had white chocolate on hand, but didn't; so I used about 70% dark chocolate. I used fresh blackberries, pureed the sauce using an immersion blender (though it does splatter a tiny bit), and didn't bother to strain the resulting sauce. I also used wine glasses rather than champagne flutes in order to skip the seemingly unnecessary step of using a pastry bag. In short, you can simplify or complicate this recipe as much as you like; as long as you've got the flavors and textures you desire, it'll be great!

I thought it was delicious! I used fresh blackberries. My husband loved it and my neighbor asked if she could return the wine glass for a refill. I am making it again today since we picked more berries.

Instead of mixing water into the white chocolate mixture I used cream. The texture of the mousse was not grainy, as mentioned with other reviewers. Also, for a red, white, and blue motif (I made this memorial day) I used blueberries instead of blackberries, and layered the parfait with mousse, blueberry sauce, sliced strawberries, and mousse. It was heavenly!

It was good, every single one of my eight guests polished off their wine glasses with the parfait, even after a heavy meal. I did not have any problems with the texture, it was very smooth and pleasantly tart (because of the sour cream and lemon). I used a star tip to pipe the mousse in the glassed and topped it with whipped cream and a fresh blackberry. I don't think I will make it again though; I want to try other, more interesting recipes on this site.

Recipe was easy and tasted good, however the texture was very grainy. I was very careful to make sure the white chocolate and water mixture was completely smooth before continuing, as another reviewer suggested). Maybe it depends on the quality of white chocolate. I used Perugina. The blackberry sauce was too sweet. Embarrassed to serve this to my guests!

Despite following directions exactly, this was a flop -- it was grainy, almost like tapioca. I suspect either the lemon juice curdled the cream upon refrigeration, or the sour cream was responsible for the curdling.

Addendum to my previous post: I've discovered this recipe works equally well with milk chocolate as a substitute for the white chocolate (horrible white chocolate scorching incident right before guests were to begin arriving - used the milk chocolate chips that I had as a quick save) Since then I've found that a very elegent way of serving this is by making two batches (one white chocolate & one milk chocolate) and layering them in wine glasses, top with shaved chocolate of your choice and a large fresh strawberry.

This is good but so rich. We wanted only a small serving and could have served 6 or even 8 with this amount of mousse however we would have needed more blackberry sauce.

Very few recipes are worth "4 forks" but this is a fabulous dessert not to be missed... plus it's quick and easy. Instead of bothering with the sauce, I will compliment the very sweet mousse with fresh berries. It's everything a mousse should be - decadently rich with a light, smooth and creamy texture. A few reviewers may have run into texture trouble by not ensuring that the melted chocolate and water mixture is completely smooth before combining with the other ingredients.

I found the recipe to be grainy...maybe I did it wrong but I don't think so.

A really great dish if you can get blackberries. Be sure to strain the seeds well. I ganish this with the sauce drizzled on the top. Really, really good.

Picked the blackberries straight from the back yard. Nice and light dessert

I followed the recipe exactly and received excellent comments from our dinner guests. "This is THE best dessert you've served us so far." It looked superb presented in martini glasses.

I must have done something wrong, because the texture of the mousse was not smooth. The taste was wonderful though. I'll try again.

This is truly decadent... I added some fresh raspberries (I think any berry would be an excellent substitution) for garnish and increased the whipped cream by about 1/2 cup, (simply to use the whole container) it was dreamy. Light, creamy texture, everyone was raving. I would also suggest an additional garnish of white chocolate curls if you have any on hand, if not the presentation itself is already incredible, sure to please every time. I'll be making this one again tomorrow for my mother's birthday.

Used the microwave to melt the chocolate - much easier than the double-boiler. This was very smooth and tasty - rave reviews from my dinner guests!
