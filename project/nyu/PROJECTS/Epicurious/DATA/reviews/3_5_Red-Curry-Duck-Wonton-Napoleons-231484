Loved this dish! Fresh and spicy.I baked the wontons for 10 min.@350 after spraying them with oil.I also crisped the duck up before adding the spices and scallions.Very good!

I made this dish and also added a mirin/coconut milk reduction and a few drops of a cilantro salsa for plating color. You can fry the wontons in just 1/8 inch of oil in a skillet instead of deep-frying as so many wonton recipes call for. Everyone loved this appetizer and the presentation is great.

Have made several times to rave reviews. I bake the wonton wrappers (brushed with a little butter on each side) instead of frying and also drizzle with a mixture of coconut milk and mirin reduction after assembled.

We had leftover roast duck and were looking for a good recipe to use up the meat. I made this for a new years party appetizer and it got rave reviews. It's a lot of chopping but worth the effort. I would make it again if I am every lucky enough to have leftover or pre-roasted duck on hand.
