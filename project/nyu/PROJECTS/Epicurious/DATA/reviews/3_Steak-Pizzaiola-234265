This is a great recipe i would diffinitely make it again. I disagree with the other review on the part on leaving water out i added it all and before i simmer it down i place a little over half a can of tomato paste to thicken it up some it came out great.

This is a good recipe for what it is. It is NOT steak pizziola. Where is the oregano to make it 'in the style of the pizza maker'? Steak is too thin, I would leave it as is without the pounding. Definitely NOT an authentic Italian recipe although a decent way of preparing steak and veggies.

Probably more like 2 1/2 forks, nothing life-changing here but I didn't expect that from this recipe. If you're looking for something easy, reasonably healthy (with all those vegetables) and fairly inexpensive this fits the bill--and I think kids would love it if you have them because it does taste sort of pizza-like. I used pre-tenderized bottom sirloin from the butcher which I knew would be tender from experience, so I didn't bother pounding, just sliced the meat when done. I only needed the first 2T of oil and no extra water since the vegetables released a lot of water, and added the juices from the beef back to the sauce. I finished it with some grated pecorino. The sauce does take a while to cook so you may want to undercook the beef, as I did, and keep it warm in the oven. I served it a green salad and olive bread with dipping oil. I would make it again, if I'm not trying to impress anyone.
