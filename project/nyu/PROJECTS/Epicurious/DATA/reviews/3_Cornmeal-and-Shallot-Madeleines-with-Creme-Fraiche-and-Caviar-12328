What a great, impressive make-ahead recipe! I followed the advice of other reviewers and added salt to the batter. One tip: make sure you underfill the madeleine tins. I didn't, and the madeleines lose a bit of their beauty when they puff up and over the madeleine tins. That stated, they were delicious. I spooned some creme fraiche into a pastry bag and tip and piped it on, then used just a small dollop of caviar and sprinkled with minced shallot and chives. Everyone went nuts for these, and it was super-easy since I'd made the madeleines the night before. Also a great way to serve caviar without having to serve a lot of it and spend a fortune.

One of my favorite caviar dishes. You need to make sure you cook the shallots awhile so they're not too strong. Adding some salt is a great suggestion from the previous reviewer

Mahvelous Caviar vehicle. Granted, for people caught up in the "Madeleines" name, it's unusual. I would add, perhaps, a teaspoon of salt to this equation. I forget this every time and curse myself for not remembering. The shallots aren't overpowering if you know what you're doing.

Not to get any East-West animosity going here, but I've made this following the instructions exactly and was very pleased, as was my husband. I plan to make it again this weekend to complement the results of my husband's recent online caviar buying spree.

I've made this a few times and think it's delicious! I substitute polenta for some of the cornmeal for a coarser madeline. The shallot flavor is somewhat strong but balances well with the creme fraiche and caviar- an elegant presentation.

This is a ridiculous recipe; a bad idea gone "creative". It shouldn't even be under the "madeleine" entry because it gives the other recipes a bad...odor.

These were horrible. The madelines were cakey and the shallots were overpowering. The only saving grace was the caviar. Better luck with something else.
