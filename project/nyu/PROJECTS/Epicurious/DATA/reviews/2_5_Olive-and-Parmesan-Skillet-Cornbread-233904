Dreadful! Although the flavor olive and rosemary is nice, the bread was a dry, crumbly texture with a sickly color from the tomato paste. One bite was all it got from my dinner guests. A waste of good reggiano and olive oil.

I make this regularly in winter to go with a hearty pumpkin soup or chili. I substitute adobo sauce for the tomato paste for a smokier flavor and extra kick. A few other reviewers have mentioned this bread's dryness; being somewhat liberal with the wet ingredients usually solves the problem. (I eyeball it, but it's probably close to 1 1/8 c milk and 3/8 c oil.)

This was delicious-used cast iron skillet and it was crispy outside and moist inside. My husband, who is not a fan of cornbread or olives, said he would be happy to eat this again.

I always read the reviews because they relate the experience of good cooks. In this case, I have to assume that I did something wrong. This turned out to be so salty (And I favor salt) that it was inedible. My wife and I each had one piece and the garbage disposal ate the rest. I would rinse the olives with water as I don't know where else so much salt would come from. I would be tempted to make this recipe again but without the olives. It would then somewhat resemble a caibatta.

I fully agree with the cooks from Toronto and Elliot City. Like another reviewer, I made this to accompany chili this evening. It was heavy and dry. It was also not like any other corn bread that I have tasted, or made. The heavy and dry really cancels out the lovely flavour of the Kalamata olives and the freshly grated parmesan. The flavouring is too insipid. A disappointment. I will not make this again.

I just made this for breakfast. I thought it was great. A slightly crunchy edge and the inside was moist yet not greasy. The only change I made was to use dried rosemary over fresh, and slightly less. I like the fact that there is no butter. Delicious!

I used the 10" cast iron skillet and found the bread dry. Liked the parmesan, olive, and rosemary combination. Next time I will use less cheese - maybe that's why it turned out dry - or smaller diameter pan. It went well with a pot of chili.

I didn't think this cornbread was anything special. I don't know if I was using stone-ground cornmeal or not, it didn't say on the package. I also used black sundried olives rather than the Kalamata so perhaps that's what affected the taste most. Was interesting to try but won't make again.

it came out a little bit dry, but the flavor was really good.

This cornbread was delicious with the bean soup. I did use a cast iron skillet, but the bread took significantly longer to bake than the recipe mentioned. It is very different cornbread, with the olives and the tomato paste in it, but it also was not as dry as other cornbreads I've tasted.

I'm going to try this recipe, but had to reply to the cook from Longmont -- Don't reduce the salt in the recipe, that's part of the chemistry that makes it rise. Do try rinsing the olives or cutting back on the cheese, or substitute a less salty hard cheese.

I really don't understand the negative reviews. This is not your traditional cornbread, it is so much better! I'll agree that the olives can make it a smidgen on the salty side, so next time I will cut back on the salt added to the batter. If you're looking for an updated and super tasty cornbread recipe, this is it.

This stuff came out dry as a bone. I compared the ingredients to a recipe for corn bread on the corn meal container and found that this recipe has about the same amount of liquid. The difference is the recipe on the box does not have a cup of parmesan cheese in it. If you want to make this, I suggest adding more liquid to make up for all that dry cheese. No wonder one reviewer thought it reminded her of foccacia! It didn't look like any cornmeal I've ever seen.

Made this withthe white bean and chorizo sausage soup. Will never make this again.

Does anyone know what the bean (soup?) recipe is that accompanied this?

Delicious, but I would leave the olives out next time. They made the bread a bit too salty and didn't add much.

They should tell you why NOT to use a non-stick skillet. Heating a non-stick skillet with nothing in it releases CARCINOGENIC fumes.

I thought this w s wonderful on a winter's night. and, being from the hill country, I know beans and cornbread!

This corn bread was very tasty with the bean soup. Fabulous for a cold day. I did have to use a preheated stainless steel skillet instead of cast iron because I don't have an iron one of that size. I'm sure the bottom would have been crispier in cast iron. Still it came out of the pan nicely and had very good flavor. It sort of reminded me of focaccia.

Liked this a lot--interesting technique with the preheated cast iron skillet. Nice combination of flavors.
