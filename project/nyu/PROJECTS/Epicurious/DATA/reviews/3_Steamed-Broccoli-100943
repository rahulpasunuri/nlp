steaming isnt really killing all the nutrients. after steaming my broccoli i run it under cold water to get it to stop cooking right away so its more crispy.

This is a recipe?? Maybe I'll just wait until they package broccoli in a can and skip the time spent cooking all of the nutrients out of my perfectly-fine-raw broc.

1.5 minutes of steaming is perfect..In the past I always put large florets in the steamer for at least 10 minutes then smothered them in butter..never again! If this simple healthy recipe is "inane" to some of you why don't you just move on to the other 150 or so recipes under the keyword "broccoli" on this site?

It's inane recipes like this that make me wonder why I subscribe to Gourmet.

This is probably as good a recipe as you can get for steamed broccoli, but not having a steamer basket I simply held them over the water with my hands. I wouldn't recommend that approach for reasons that are obvious to me now. FYI: steam is hotter than boiling water. If only I knew then what I know now...

Trying to maintain levels of fat in our diet, and not willing to give up butter and olive oil, I compromise and do one dish with the fats and the other sides without. I like vegetables crispy tender but sometimes forget (after all these years) the time it takes so I like sites like this that can quickly give me the cooking time.

bless you for publishing this recipe. like many of the other reviewers (but, apparantly, not ALL of the reviewers) i was not born knowing how to cook. for as many years as i've been cooking i didn't know that broccoli would steam to crisp-tender stage in as few as 90 seconds. without the basics, none of us would be able to excel. thank you again.

Of course there are "some novices who still need this detailed instruction..." Believe it or not, many people do not know how to properly prepare fresh vegetables. I don't think the "experienced cooks" who complained about how basic this is were born knowing how to cook - everyone has to start somewhere. Hats off to Epicurious for taking those who are inexperienced into consideration when deciding on which recipes to include here. To the complainers -- grow up and learn some tolerance. Too bad reviewers can't rate how helpful a review was to them. This might help others know which "reviews" to ignore.

This is the best method of preparation for broccoli. Remember that your possibilities are limitless! Feel free to add ANYTHING to them (cheese, oils, herbs, etc) and you will get great results. Be careful not to over-steam them!

I found this recipe to be dull. At first I followed the directions. When I tasted it ,it was like tasting nothing. So while it was still in the pan, I added more garlic and then more lemon and it still wasn't great. So, when all else fails, I added more salt. It still was disappointing. We ate it anyway because we love broccoli but I wouldn't make this again. Bland, bland, bland.

I am an example of an experienced cook who really didn't know broccoli could be steamed as quickly as 1.5 minutes. I am making broccoli tonite for company, and for once it will not be soggy - always a hit and miss thing in the past for me...I agree simple things should not be mocked. Having taught myself, I am sure there are many more basics I am still not getting. As long as I preserve myself from a debilitating sense of superiority, I am sure I can eventually get them all...

You can make fun of this recipe if you want, but there are a lot of folks out there who were never taught how to cook. They have no clue how long to steam broccoli. You ought to learn somewhere.

If you really get creative, one could buy the broccoli already in florets and cut down the time to about 15 minutes. Please do something more creative.

This is too funny! I kept searching for more than the obvious, but I suppose there are some novices who still need this detailed instruction. I think the time could at least read "can be made in 15 minutes depending how fast you pare!

I'm a little disappointed. There is no recipe. It reminds me of the recipe for boiled water.
