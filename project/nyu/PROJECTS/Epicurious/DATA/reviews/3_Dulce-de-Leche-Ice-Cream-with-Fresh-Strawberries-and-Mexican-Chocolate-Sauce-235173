Holy cow! I made this as part of my Valentine's Day dinner and it was a fantastic end to the meal! I tripled (quadrupled?) the spices -- we love spicy stuff, and this definitely worked! I will definitely make again. Oh, I couldn't find dulce de leche ice cream, so I used vanilla and it was perfectly lovely.

Wow. This is a divine dessert combination. Here in Germany Dulce de Leche is basically unheard of, so I had to make it from scratch, then made the ice cream. Found both recipes found on this website, search "dulce de leche" - and I don't get the nasty reviews from some people - it's not like anyone tells you not to make it if you want to. The recipe is easy to find. Anyway: The chocolate sauce is maybe the best I've ever had. Definitely a keeper!

To those of you who are complaining that the recipe calls for store bought ice cream. I found this recipe by clicking on the link for "Quick and Easy Mexican Feast" If I had to make my own ice cream it would have defeated the purpose of "Quick and Easy"

It wasn't as good as I was hoping for.

There is a wonderful recipe for Dulce de Leche ice cream on this website from Gourmet 5/2007. Try it. The sauce is delightful, a lovely combination. I find it interesting yet disappointing that 5 of 17 reviews slammed this recipe for using (gasp!) purchased ice cream. C'mon folks, have you never been in a hurry?

And for those of you folks who like to pair a no-brainer sauce with prepared ice cream ... Why do you even buy this magazine? Do you make anything at all? Bet you buy bottled salad dressing. Geeze. Take a cooking class, please.

This is a joke, right? A "recipe" that calls for store bought ice cream? What's the punch line? There was not an option for "no forks." Disgusting.

Yum! I served this at a big fiesta of about 30 guests because I wanted a simple, beautiful Mexican dessert that wasn't flan (yuck!). I spruced it up by serving it with caramel brownies & pecans, but decided that the recipe is better left as is (the brownies were too much). I bought little disposable champagne glasses at Smart & Final, and in the context, they looked like mini-margarita glasses-- very cute for serving & no clean up! I was hesitant about the cayenne pepper, but it turned out great-- it added a little depth of flavor without giving it a weird savory, spicy taste. Also, I made the chocolate sauce in advance & reheated it when I served it-- that was another mistake. The fat separated, and the consistency was a little gloppy. Nothing tragic, just not as pretty as when I made it in the morning. I would recommend prepping the ingredients ahead of time & making the sauce just as you're serving it. In all, very easy & delicious! I'll make it again!

Delicious! I added a bit more of the pepper and also served it with grilled pineapple as suggested by another reviewer. Perfect!

YUMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!! Perfection! Used Häagen-Dazs ice cream, Vahlrona Chocolate, and fresh strawberries. Such a terrific return on your investment/time. Tastes way better than some desserts I have toiled over (and I consider myself a very picky, masterful baker), and the guests gobbled it up. As per the previous reviews "tsk-tsk"-ing this, give me a break! I was able to make a wow company recipe with a nursing one week old and a 3 year old underfoot. Of course I make more complicated things when I have time, but when I don't, thank goodness for recipes like this! RE: A Cook from Independence, MO USA, "What did I do wrong?" 1. Did you use chocolate chips instead of chocolate baking bars? Some brands have wierd emulsifiers and other ingredients that prevent proper melting. 2. Did the chocolate get to hot some how and burn, did you overcook it? You can always heat it until mostly melted, then remove from heat, wait a few minutes, and make your final whisk just to make sure. 3. Did you accidentally get water in the chocolate or have some in the pan when you started? - this can cause it to sieze. 4. Were any of your ingredients old or bad? Chocolate doesn't last forever. Please give it another go, it is a great recipe! FYI - I just microwaved mine on 50% power for 30 seconds at a time and it came out great. I wouldn't worry about getting it 100% smooth, you probably can't tell anyways in the finished sunday.

I followed instructions exactly, but could never get a smooth chocolate sauce; it was thick and after sitting less than 10 minutes, separated into a clear oily layer and the thick melted chocolate. What did I do wrong?

To the reviewers complaining about the lack of a recipe for the ice cream, you're missing the point that this is a delicious chocolate sauce, and the combination of the three things together (caramel ice cream, fresh strawberries, and a spicy/sweet sauce) is a wonderful match. This was really delicious and perfect ending for the menu as written. I did freshly grated cinnamon and more cayenne than the recipe called for, which was still very subtle but gave it a nice interesting undertone.

Served with grilled pineapple and strawberries over ice cream. Rave reviews! I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate and added a little extra cinnamon. Fabulous!

I must agree with the person from Canton This is really not a recipe (?) I would expect in Gourmet or Bon Apetit magazines. I thought I was going to look at an ice cream recipe.....

"Dulce de Leche" is my favorite ice cream but I had never tried it in such a delicious combination. Everybody loved it and asked me to do it do it again soon.

Well, here I was, naively thinking that a recipe called "Dulce de Leche Ice Cream" would be a recipe for making dulce de leche ice cream, but no, it just calls for bought ice cream. Stupid me!

Epicurious does it again. Had they called the recipe "Mexican Chocolate Sauce" and then added a serving suggestion to serve with Dulce de Leche Ice Cream, I'd have rated it better. Crazy me, thinking I might actually get a recipe for Dulce de Leche ice cream. Next up on Epicurious, grilled chicken with pinot grigo. Direction: buy grilled chicken from the deli section of a good grocery store and buy pinot grigio from a liquor store. Eat. Tsk tsk, Epicurious. Shame on you.

This chocolate sauce was just fabulous! We made it a couple of hours before serving. Initially, we thought we might need to add more cayenne, but as the chocolate sauce sat, the flavor intensified. We will definitely make this again. Next time, we'll likely serve it with vanilla ice cream. We found that we didn't need the richness of the dulce de leche ice cream as we prefer a lighter tasting dessert in the summer.

My mom actually made this, but I did a lot of eating of the chocolate sauce over Haggen Dazs dulce de leche ice cream. It is divine! I first just ate it off the spoon, and it is delicious, but with the layering of flavors, the levels when the sensations hit your tongue with the ice cream, it's truly a remarkable dessert.

While this sauce was super simple and quite tasty (because of this I would make it again), we like the sauce from "Strawberries with Chocolate Caramel Sauce" (from this site) better. Do try this one though, just because of its simplicity.

Perfect ending to the chicken taco meal in this same issue. Did not notice the cayenne pepper as much as I wanted to. Will add more next time.

Made this with the chicken tacos in the same issue. Perfect ending to a fabulous meal. I give it 3 forks because I didn't really notice the cayenne pepper as much as I wanted to. I would probably add more next time.
