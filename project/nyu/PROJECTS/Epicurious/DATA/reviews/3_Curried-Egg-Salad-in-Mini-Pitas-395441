I've already made this a handful of times in the past couple of weeks. It is super easy to make and the flavors are amazing! If you like Indian food, it's almost a sure bet. Everyone that has tasted it loves it. I ever tried "cleaning" it up a bit and using nonfat greek yogurt instead of mayo and you couldn't tell the difference.

I love curried egg salads. This one is a bit different with cumin added in addition to curry powder, which i've never tried. I do admit I prefer no added cumin but this is a very tasty and satisfying lunch. Pita bread is the very best choice for egg salad if you ask me!
