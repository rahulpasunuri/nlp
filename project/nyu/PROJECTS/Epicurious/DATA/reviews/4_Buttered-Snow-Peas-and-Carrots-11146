This is my standby peas & carrots dish -- I generally use sugar snaps just because I love them. It's a great recipe, quick and simple, and really lets the flavours of the veggies come through. A nice colourful addition to a plate, too.

I have been making this recipe since it appeared in the magazine. I enjoy serving it to campany - it's a great twist on peas and carrots. I'm surprised more people haven't tried it.

The veggies stayed crunchy, and this is quick and easy. Easy to make in enormous quantities for parties, too!

Snow Peas should always have a snap to them. This is a wonderful combination. We serve it offen and I take the Left-overs to work with me. Good Stuff
