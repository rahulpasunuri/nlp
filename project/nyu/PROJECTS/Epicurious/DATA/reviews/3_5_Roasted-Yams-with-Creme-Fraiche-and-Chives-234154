I have made this a few times for different groups of friends. I am always surprised by the compliments for such a simple recipe. The creme fraiche and the fleur de sel are key to making this foodie worthy.

A good way to prepare sweet potatoes. I used lowfat sour cream and it was fine. Goes VERY nicely with the skirt steak in the "Tax Day" meal suggestion. (but skip the salad!)

Couldn't find creme fraiche so I substituted sour cream. Was still very nice. I had never thought to put sour cream on a sweet potato.

Served with VEAL CUTLETS WITH THYME BUTTER SAUCE. A great complement to the richness of the veal. This was the first time I'd had yams without any kind of sweet topping.. However, it won't be the last!! Easy, quick, little clean up... and nice flavor to boot.Loved the way the tartness and zing of the creme and chives played against the creamy sweetness of the yam. A keeper!

These were so good and so easy. A very nice substitute to the baked potato.

Yummy! The creme fraiche makes it decadent and it really goes nice with the veal with thyme butter sauce.
