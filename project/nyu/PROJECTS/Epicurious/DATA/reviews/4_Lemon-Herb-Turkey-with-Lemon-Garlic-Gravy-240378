We thought the gravy was awesome. For as much time and effort we took with the butter and lemon under the skin the turkey did not seem to reflect those flavors as much as we had hoped. We did not brine our turkey. I would make the gravy again but do something a little different with the turkey.

I liked it, but it was missing something. I loved the lemony note, but the gravy was not a good match. We will work on the gravy in the future. We did use the remainder of the butter on steamed fish and it was amazing.

This was the 3rd year that I made this turkey; although everyone loves it, last year my 92 year old mother-in-law mentioned to my husband that it was too lemony and garlicky for her. So this year I cut back on the amount of the butter spread underneath the skin and included fewer lemon slices. I was concerned that the gravy might not be as tangy as a result. But it was every bit as good and had just the right amount of tang. A huge hit all around! It will be THE turkey recipe for many Thanksgivings to come!

We've made this recipe every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas since it was published in 2007. It is fantastic. We never brine either. Tip: we add tarragon to the stock.

My neighbour made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was the most moist and delicious turkey I had EVER tasted. She brined it the night before. I plan on making it next year!

I enjoyed the recipe. Took me a bit longer to make than the recipe suggested, but I suspect that had more to do with the cook. Vance Fowler

My grandmother called it the most flavorful turkey & gravy she'd had in 88 years. I've made it 3 times, and it always gets rave reviews. The only change I made to the recipe was using chicken stock instead of turkey stock.

I made this turkey for the first time in 2007 and will make it again this year. It was the best tasting turkey I've ever made. I brined mine with salt, sugar, oranges, lemons, rosemary & thyme for 2 days prior to cooking. It was moist, juicy & full of wonderful flavor. I can't wait to make it again.

I made this for Thanksgiving a few years ago, and I'm hooked. It's amazingly moist. I normally hate turkey, and loved this recipe. I also love lemons, though, so maybe other reviewers weren't as fond. I did short cut the turkey stock and just used some chicken stock that I had made a few days previous. Anyway, really great, and went well with artichokes or asparagus. Great recipe!

I made this last year and was amazed at how well it turned out! The skin though was a bit tough, but the meat what amazing! I also loved the gravy... The lemon really gave the gravy a nice zest that is a bit different from gravies i've had in the past. Four stars for this great recipe!

I, too, will be repeating this recipe this year as our group of 15 thought it was the best turkey they ever ate. You won't need so many lemons..cut as you go. It is tricky to spread the butter under the skin, but worth the effort! I made my usual gravy without the additional lemons,etc.

With Thanksgiving coming up soon I just had to rave about this recipe - I had 20 guests last year and everyone started laughing after a first bite - it was so delicious. I used fresh organic bird from local farm - I will be making this again.

I prepared this for Thanksgiving. It was the first time I have ever made a Turkey(!) and surprisingly easy. I made the gravy as well. My friends and family were gaga. The herbs and lemons really made it look beautiful, and the meat was perfectly juicy and tasted awesome. They're asking me to make it again for Christmas Dinner.

Disgusting. Ruined a perfectly good turkey.

I enjoyed this turkey, but some of my guests thought the lemon flavor was a bit overwhelming, particularly in the gravy. I'm also not sure that so much butter was necessary, as it seemed like I had exactly as much fat in my drippings as I added in butter. I used an organic turkey that I brined for 4 hours and air dried overnight.

Everyone liked this very much. I thought there would be too much lemon if I used the whole rind so I only used a quarter of the rine. It was just the right amount of lemon. Very good.

This was delicious. I suspect that the difference in opinion among reviewers (excellent vs. too lemony) is a consequence of the type of lemon used. I used meyer lemons and their mild taste was perfect on the turkey and in the gravy. Lots of raves from my guests.

Made this side by side with the Cider-Brined- And-Glazed Turkey (BA 11-2005), mostly to experiment between brined vs. compound butter-under-the skin techniques. Thus, I followed instructions, and did not brine this one. Used 11 lb., free-range, organic birds in both cases. My guests really liked both, but gave an edge to the brined bird for juiciness and overall appearance. As for me, I thought it was a pain in the neck to get the butter under the skin. My only prior experience w/ this style of preparation has been to slide dry herbs under chicken skins, Zuni style. But with butter added, it tended to glob up in spots, and was very difficult to distribute evenly. Also, tested the convection roast function on our oven and it cooked both unstuffed birds to 175F (higher than Id wanted) in less than 1.5 hrs. Nevertheless, the breast meat on both was nice & moist with no/minimal basting.

Fourteen guests of mine (and I) RAVED about this turkey. It was, by far, the most incredibly moist and flavorful turkey any of us could ever remember eating. (I did use a fresh, free- range organic bird, which I brined the night before.) I will, however, agree with some of the other reviewers who complained about the gravy; the drippings are much too powerful for a gravy. I almost had a heart attack when I tasted the gravy after I prepared it per the recipe. I thought dinner had been ruined. Luckily I was able to dilute the gravy with chicken stock and water, avoiding disaster. The turkey gets a 10+, the gravy a 2.

Absolutely hideous. The lemon flavor was way too strong, ruined the turkey. Fortunately I had made stock for gravy ahead of time so at least we had edible gravy. I almost cried when I tasted what would have fabulous stock; the bird was wonderful (from a local farmer) had it not been for this recipe. I've been a BA subscriber for 22 years and, like one of the reviewers of this recipe, this is the first time I've been been moved to write a review. Yuk.

This recipe was fabulous. The lemony flavor of the turkey was refreshing and light without being overpowering. The gravy was very good, probably the best tasting gravy I have ever had. We also brine our tukey and it was incredibly moist. Definately will be making this recipe again.

While very lemony, my lemon- fanatic family thought this was very good. I did not add the saffron (didn't have any) or the additional lemon juice when making the gravy, but my guests thought it was especially tasty and put the gravy on everything from artichoke, sausage and parmesan stuffing to green beans with pancetta and sage. We always brine our turkey overnight and the bird was moist and delicious.

Whatever you do, AVOID this recipe like the plague. The lemon flavor is so strong it completely obliterates the herbs, the turkey, and anything else you serve with the gravy. The lemon flavor goes terribly with any stuffing. The gravy is a day-glo yellow from the saffron. I have used Epicurious for years, and this is the first time I have been moved to write a review. I wasted an expensive free-range turkey on Bruce Aidells's experiment. Don't make the same mistake!
