I fixed this for Xmas dinner and received raves from the family. After reading the various reviews I too reduced the amount of salt, about 1/2-2/3 and it was just fine. After pulling the lamb I removed it to a rack covered in foil to rest. The potatoes were gentle mixed to distribute the lamb drippings then placed under the boiler until they were just starting to brown. Four pounds of potatoes disappeared with only the four of us at the table. Yum! I paired it with a wonderful Nebbiolo which really complimented the lamb.

Not sure where all the rave reviews came from but hey maybe I didn't do something right. I only used 1 lbs of potatoes for a 6 lbs leg of lamb. Seemed to bee a lot of potatoes. I removed all the fat and silver skin. It seemed the potatoes didn't have a lot of flavor to me and The lamb was just ok.... Nothing to write home about. Maybe I missed something. I would next time season the potatoes. add more of assortment of root veggies. I would even marinate the leg before hand also...I'm hoping I just missed something but I'm just not digging it.

Alterations: I marinated the lamb in red wine and crushed garlic for a couple of hours prior to preparation. Used sweet potatoes instead of yellow potatoes. And only inserted thinly sliced garlic cloves into the meat since my rosemary was a little stiff. Great recipe. Will definitely make again.

The recipe sounded different so I tried it and thought it was great! I made a gravy for it also with red wine reduction,shallots carrot, beef broth, butter and flour. My company loved it. When the lamb was finished roasting, I let it rest and put the potatoes back in the oven to crisp up.

The lamb was perfect! It came out juicy, tender and flavourful! I was a little worried the honey would make it too sweet tasting but you only taste it slightly on the outside portions and it actually compliments all the other flavours! The only thing I would change is that I would try using other root veggies to go with the lamb and wilted greens for some variety...Delicious!

This was an excellent dish. This was my first time cooking a leg of lamb so I relied on the reviews. I used about 1 T. salt for the lamb and potatoes combined and it was plenty. This would be excellent for a dinner party because it is beautiful and the active time is minimal. I used a boneless leg and it worked great. Even my two year old loved it!

This is a wonderful lamb dish! I have not cooked lamb very often but made this once before and it was delicious. I was nervous about making it again because I thought maybe last time was beginners luck. It came out great again. I used herbes de provence instead of the herbs called for but that is personal preference. I roasted at 450 for the first 15 minutes and then at 350 for 25 minutes per pound. I served it with my grandmother's cranberry salad recipe and it really was wonderful. As an earlier person noted, definitely cut off the extra fat. (And I used a semi-boneless leg.)

Simply the best. Extremely tasty. One mistake I made was not trimming all the fat and I should have b/c it pooled on the bottom of the pan and sogged half the potatoes. I recommend Cooking it longer for the strongest flavor. Yuuuuuuuum!!!!!

Great dish. I put some of the garlic (in slivers) and rosemary in with the potatoes for extra flavour; Next time I might add thinly sliced spanish onions, rather than garlic, to the potatoes; the sweetness from the onions should compliment the honey on the lamb rather well!

I made this last night, and it turned out very, very well. It was my first experience roasting lamb, with rave results (from guests who would know!). The flavors were simple, but delicious. I would increase the amount of honey slightly (to caramelize on top). The potatoes, sliced very thin on a mandoline, acquired a lovely flavor from the lamb. Make SURE to have your butcher take off the fat and skin, it's well worth it to save some time. I served this with the roasted asparagus with morels and favas, also on Epicurious. Beautiful and delicious!

Although it took me most of an hour to get all the fat off my lamb, it was delicious. I wasn't too impressed with the potatoes, however, but only had a 4 mm cutting disc, so they weren't as thin as the recipe suggested. The greens were delicious - especially kale, and well received by my Easter dinner guests. I would love some suggestions for taking the fat off - most big markets don't have butchers anymore to do such work and it isn't something I do often.

This recipe was fabulous. Very easy and excellent results. I did not serve the wilted greens, just simple steamed asparagus and served a mint pesto on the side. Rave reviews. Will definitely make again.

We made this recipe for Easter dinner and were disappointed with the results. The recipe had good potential; however, it was overpowered by the amount of salt as called for in the recipe. The potatoes were very good. I'd make it again, but with half the salt.

This recipe is simple and savory.

I grew up in New Zealand and Australia where Lamb is a popular dish, so I love to find new ways with lamb and this was delicious! The honey gave an interesting flavour and it married so well with the garlic, the wilted greens were an unusual but tasty addition and my guests were most impressed. I didnt slice the potatoes so thinly, i used baby ones and scored them with a fork all over and they were crispy and golden. I really thought this recipe was simple and rewarding. A great way to try lamb or good for people who cook it regularily. Mmmmmm!

Tried the recipe to great success & raves from guests. Relatively easy, with most of the prep at the front end of the recipe so I could enjoy being with guests. I did not include the greens, but used another recipe - SPINACH PARMESAN CUSTARD WITH FRICO as the vegetable. Also very good.
