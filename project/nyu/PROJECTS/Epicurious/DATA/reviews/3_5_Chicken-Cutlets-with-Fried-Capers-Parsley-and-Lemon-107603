We enjoyed this although it took a little longer than I'd have liked. I sautéed 2 garlic cloves, one small onion and 1/2 red pepper first. Set aside, then fried capers. Then sautéed chicken. Last, combined parsley, white wine, and lemon juice for a little bit of sauce. Very tasty...particular hubby liked a lot.

This recipe is a real keeper. Tasty, easy to prepare with a minimum of ingredients and a healthy content. My husband loved this!

Fast, simple and tasty. I took the advice of other reviewers and added a bit of white wine, also thickened the sauce with butter and cornstarch. This is a good recipe to add as a staple for quick weeknight meals.

Really good and really easy. The fried capers make the dish. I coated the chicken with flour before pan frying and doubled the capers, parsley and lemon. Next time less parsley.

Really very good. Made it exactly as called for, just doubled the lemon juice and added some white wine. Light and delicious. Just what I was looking for tonight. Everyone raved.

If you want to thicken the sauce, knead 1/2 tsp cornstarch into 1 Tbsp softened butter. Whisk into the hot sauce and bring to a boil. I used 1 cup white wine with the lemon juice for the sauce, plus the shallots.

My friend forwarded this to me with her note to add a little dab of "Better than Buillon", which I forgot to do, but think it would have been the ideal key ingred. Based on the other reviews and my own taste, I doubled the sauce recipe, sauteed 2 large chopped shallots and 5 small cloves of garlic, and splashed in some white wine. It was too lemony and bitter, so I added a bit of 1/2 and 1/2 to the sauce when it was very HOT (so it wouldn't curdle) and it was REALLY good. I will definitely make again (adding it to my weeknight "rotation"), but will try adding the chicken stock flavoring. I served the chicken and sauce over wide/wavy egg noodles.

I give this 4 forks due to how easy and delicious this recipe is (I am an admitted caper hound -- I devour them like candy). What really helped were the delicious capers and caper berries that I brought back from a recent trip to Sicily. If you can get good caper berries, I highly recommend using them along with the capers for something a little more. I also added a little white wine -- definitely not necessary, but if you have an open bottle around it's a nice touch.

The chicken was moist and delicious. I think I used a wee bit too much lemon juice, however. I'm not the hugest fan of lemon, but if it's subtle I enjoy it. The fried capers were easy and added a nice touch. I served this with homemade pesto, which was a fantastic compliment to this dish.

Very similar to Chicken Piccata. I coated the chicken breast with a little flour to help thicken the sauce and added white wine with the lemon juice and parsley. The fried capers are a nice touch.

I have made this a million times, it is delicious. I use the thin sliced chicken cutlets, and they always come out juicy..... I usually serve with some sort of rice side and a veggie, next time I will double sauce and serve with pasta, as so many other reviewers have recommended

This is a great recipe - nice fresh, tangy flavor. I doubled the sauce, made some modifications/additions, and was very pleased with the results. After frying the capers, lightly brown 1 large chopped shallot and 3 cloves of minced garlic in the olive oil. Then dissolve one packet of dry chicken boullion, add the parsley, lemon, and 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes (I prefer the ones in olive oil). Cook at a fast simmer for a few minutes, then add one small can of vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then simmer until broth is slightly reduced. Add 4 cups of coarsely chopped spinach and blend until spinach is slightly wilted, but still bright green. I mixed the sauce with a multi-grain penne pasta, topping with the chicken. A huge hit with my husband. The modifications will add a bit of prep time, but are well worth the effort!

Loved this! Used boneless, skinless breasts, prepared as directed (sans salt and pepper), topped with the sauce and capers, then baked, covered at 325 degrees for 30 mins. It turned out great!

Extremely simple and very tasty. Definitely a repeat!

This is a simple and excellent dish. The capers are crucial here... they taste *fantastic* when fried. Using thin chicken cutlet is also important, I've found - so make sure to bash it down a little if you bought it thick. Like some others, I used extra lemon juice and parsley - can't have enough of that sauce! I served this with tabbouleh and got yelled at. I will serve it with tabbouleh no more. :(

agree with cambridge mass - flour cutlets and deglaze pan, but for goodness' sake, use white wine too! and the pasta recipe - oh my god! it's called "angel's hair pasta w/ lemon and pine nuts".

Taste was great, but next time I wouldn't fry the capers. It was time consuming to prepare them (you really need to get them very dry or they'll splatter in the oil) and I didn't notice a difference in the taste of them in the dish. I also like a bit more sauce, I added some leftover cream I had. I might even add chicken broth to deglaze and let it reduce some. I also used chicken breasts and let them steam a bit so they weren't dried out. Overall it was tasty and very simple. Good for a quick weeknight dinner, nothing fancy.

This recipe is terrific. Fresh, simple, bright-tasting, and easy. I usually flour the cutlets before sauteeing, then deglaze the pan with chicken broth before adding the lemon, parsely and capers again. This gives a sauce that is out of this world. I highly recommend this dish with the parsley, pinenut and lemon pasta also listed on this site. Very summery and delicious!

I have made this many times because it is delicious, quick and easy. I use the very thinly slice chicken that is becoming easier to get at the supermarket; it cooks faster and more evenly, and allows for variation in portion size. I double the amount of capers, because my spouse is a caper hound. Like most lemon-based vinagrettes, it needs more salt than one might expect; I use Maldon's sea salt, which adds a wonderful fresh briny flavor, without the sometimes metallic taste of table salt. The last time I made this, I doubled the amount of sauce and used it on about a half-pound of linguine, along with the chicken, about 3/4 pound. With a salad, and a bottle of pinot grigio, it made a delightful little dinner for two.

Delicious. I added slivered roasted red peppers from a jar and heated them at the end with the parsley and lemon juice which made this even better.

I made this for my friend's birthday and we both loved it! He still talks about it and it's been weeks. I served it with herb roasted new potatoes which were a good choice. I love the lemon/caper combination and next time will probably add more capers.

I was unimpressed. The chicken tasted good, but the sauce was way too runny and capers just don't stay on top of chicken in any way that makes them easy to eat with it. It was okay, but if you make this dish, be sure to eat it with something else that's flavorful enough to augment it.

I've made this twice now, the second time for guests who also liked it. The first time I made it I probably fried the capers too long, they came out a bit dry. The next time I will add some green olives and a touch of cayenne.

This is one of my most favorite recipies from this website. It is so easy and delicious! I use a whole jar of capers and at least double the amount of parsley.... To those of you who haven't made this yet - Try it, you'll love it!

I made this last night for some last-minute out of town guests, and it was fast, easy, and very tasty. Quite a hit with all. Also nice with the the olive oil/chive mashed potatoes.

We made this after work one night last week. It was very quick and easy to prepare. It made for a delicious meal with some roasted vegetables on the side. The sauce was wonderful. I may add a bit more lemon next time but that's just my preference.

It is true, the capers make the dish. I would probably make this again, since the ingredients are so easy to find.

This is one of our favorites for a quick dinner. Lively, salty and sour all at once. Perfect with broccoli and fried potatoes.
