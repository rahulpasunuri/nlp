This was sooo ONO-LICIOUS as we say in Hawai'i!!! My family loved it...only problem was I didn't make enough to stuff themselves silly! :)

A friend made this years ago--but subbed orange juice for lemon and added some fresh rosemary.... What a wonderful recipe that way! We would have eatern if off the floor! I've only made it that way since and it's a 4 with seafood or sweet potato ravioli.

This dish is simply amazing and easy to make. My boyfriend and I loved it and we live in New Orleans...it's better than the actual restaurant dish!

This meal was so good and it was really easy. I had to find this recipe and make it again. I will not lose this recipe again...

My husband and I (both cooks) thoroughly enjoyed this recipe! It has a great hint of spice and is rich in flavor. No need to strain the sauce. This even worked for leftovers which most fish dishes don't!

This was fantastic. I do think the sauce amount should be approximately doubled, and I frankly didn't think it needed to be strained (if you like garlic you can skip that step!).

I really liked this, but would at least double the sauce recipe next time.

Awful. I'm sorry, this was really bad. I like experimenting, but this did not turn out well. I don't think this is a good recipe for catfish, it was too wet. Really, don't bother, make something else.

Just delicious!!!! A real winner!!!

I spiced up the sauce with a bit of cayenne, but otherwise prepared as directed. It was a big hit with us and our guests--and so quick and easy. Make sure the pecans don't burn.

In spite of my love for most anything to do with New Orleans, this recipe just doesn't cut it. Maybe catfish is just too bland for me. Try something else.

We have never rated a recipe one fork but this one deserves it. It was bland and even the sauce did not lend any great help. I did follow the recipe. I could not recommend this to anyone.

i made this dish using red snapper for my cooking club and got excellent results. i also made this with orange roughy and wasn't as good (too gelatinous, gummy). which leads me to conclude that the freshness and the type of the fish really makes a difference for a dish this simple. i highly recommend fresh snapper from a trusted fishmonger and not the stuff you get from your local grocer.

It was delicious. I have been looking for a good recipe for cat fish, and this was it. Keep up the good work.

This dish was a lot of work, but it is very, very good. Made it for a dinner party, and I was simply stuck in the kitchen until I served. I purchased very large fillets, and not one guest left anything on their plate. May try to serve with a sweeter sauce next time.

The only substitution I made in this recipe was the fish - I used Orange Roughy because that was what I had on hand. It really wasn't as good as I expected it to be.

I loved this recipe, but found that it can be a little too rich for some people. The sauce has an unusual, yet really good flavor that complements the delicate fish well. I definitely will make this dish again.

Wow - it was great! This was the first time I had ever made catfish and I loved it! Will definately make it again and again....easy, quick and delicious! Wouldn't change a thing...be careful not to burn the nuts....

The sauce was very good and added just enough punch to the catfish.

I have made this recipe 2-3 times, my husband and I both loved it and have shared it with many friends. Be careful not to allow the pecans to burn.

I made it last March '98, and I'm preparing it again for a small dinner party I'm having. My husband and I both loved it.
