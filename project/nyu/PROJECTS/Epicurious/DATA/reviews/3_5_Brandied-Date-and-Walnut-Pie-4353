This pie is delicious and my family always requests it - especially during the holidays. You know it's good when a family full of 'chocoholics' would rather eat this pie than something chocolate! Enjoy.

The consensus at Thanksgiving was that is just ok - there are lots better pies out there. It tasted a bit like mincemeat pie. If you do make it, remember to toast the walnut pieces first - that did help enhance the walnut flavor.

This pie was delicious. I was looking for a recipe to use up dates and came upon this. I love pecan pies so I was hopeful that this would be a winner and it was! I was out of brandy so I used Jim Beam. Still it was really good.

I made this pie last weekend for a family get-together and it received overwhelming praise. I happen to love pecan pie, but this was a very nice change of pace - the brandy, especially, adds a depth of flavor not usually found in your average nut pie. The dates also made for an interesting addition. This recipe will surely be used again - especially when I'm trying to impress guests with something different!

I forgot the egg wash over the finished crust, and that would have preserved the crust better... but this pie is just exquisite! I didn't even whip the cream, just put a little in a shallow dish and put this pie over it. Wow.

Outstanding! I don't care for the too sweet pecan pies, so I was a bit nervous with this recipe. Wow! The less rich walnuts are a wonderful complement to the dates and the whole pie was eaten in one evening by a total of five guests. This will be a regular in my house.

This pie was absolutely fabulous, nice and moist with complex flavors and textures. I used pecans instead of walnuts and it tasted just dandy with the brandy.Yum Yum.

excellent pie...tastes different and a more interesting flavor/texture than the expected pecan or other traditional pies. filling is very easy to prepare (i used a ready-made crust). just enough brandy to give great flavor, but not overpower. recommended!
