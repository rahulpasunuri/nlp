I make a smoothie a lot like this. I add about half a cup of yogurt, because it's good for you, and it gives a rich taste. I like the idea of adding flax seed meal.

Very good smoothie. Left out frozen acai puree because could not find it at grocery store, but it was still an excellent smoothie. definitely would make this again
