Could have used more flavor. Also, I could have planned a bit better...I used one of the least hot burners on the stove, so my cooking times were more like 15 minutes than 3-4. Overall it was good though, and I steamed my broccoli and cooked my rice rather than microwaving anything.

Quick and easy--forget the meat. I added corn and green beans. Next time carrots.

Like most of the other reviewers I didn't microwave the brocoli or rice, but steamed my brocoli and cooked the rice on the stove top. Otherwise I followed the recipe (substituting the peanut oil for vegetable oil). My family really enjoyed this meal. I will definitely make it again as it was quick and tasty.

I made this recipe as is, adding some mushrooms to the mix, and liked it, but I found it needed more taste. I had frozen ginger that I grated, and I suspect that it may not have much flavour anymore. Will try fresh ginger next time. Will also double or even triple the sauce since there was very, very little of it (and my hubby is a sauce fanatic). All in all, a great quick meal.

This is a great quick weeknight meal. I too skipped all the microwaving and just made brown rice and added the broccoli at the end. The only other change I made was to add about a two teaspoons of cornstarch to the sliced meat before saute, it thickened the sauce nicely and gave the chicken (instead of beef) a nice velvety texture.

This is actually really good! I added carrots in mine and scallions. But I would definitely use low-sodium broth next time. It's a bit too salty in combination with the soy sauce otherwise.

Quick easy tasy and you can easily add all kinds of different veggies!

I made this last night and it came out very well. As far as quantities and ingredients, I followed it exacly, however, as other reviewers mentioned, I didn't do the microwave part for the brocoli. I add the raw brocoli at the point of "simmer" in the instructions, for about 8 mins and served. Will definately make this again!

This dish has a lovely, understated flavor. Don't bother with the microwave directions; instead I steamed the veggies and rice on the stove top. I steamed 3 small heads of broccoli, a red bell pepper, and a large handful of green beans cut into 1-inch pieces. I also cubed a sweet potato and boiled it separately and added it at the end. I also added chopped scallions with the beef and tripled the spices and broth because my family won't eat it if there isn't enough "juice" to flavor the rice. A really lovely, enjoyable dish to eat. I made the "Curry Cumin Popovers" [SUPER simple side!] on this site to go with it.

I have not made this, but I just wanted to point out that microwaving broccoli removes over 80% of the antioxidants, while steaming it only removes a tiny fraction.
