I am an experienced baker, yet had never made an angle food cake. This recipe was perfect, even at high altitude (I live at 5000 feet). I followed the directions exactly, but then had an oven problem, baked the cake at 475F for only about 15 minutes and it came out great, light, fluffy and tasty. I will make this again and will cook it at the recommended temperature.

This recipe was just plain awful. Hated it and so did my dog.

This recipe is super sweet. I put a quarter cup less sugar and it was still too sweet!

I made this cake for my wife who's dieting, and she loved the taste and the fact that is so low in calories, as it's mostly air, protein from the eggs and not too much sugar. I personally would use less cream of tartar next time as I feel it gave the cake a little overy salty-bitter taste. The mango sauce was simply delicious. It added freshness and a little zing from the ginger.

I've made this numerous times, with and without the sauce, and either way it is delicious!
