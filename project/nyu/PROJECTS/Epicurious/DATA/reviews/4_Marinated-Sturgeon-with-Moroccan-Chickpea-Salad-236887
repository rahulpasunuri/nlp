I did not make the fish, I only made the salad, so this is a review of it. It's awesome. I've taken it to my sister's Moroccan Christmas feast two years in a row now. I make a full recipe of the charmoula sauce, and double the amount of the salad ingredients (because as the recipe is written, half of the charmoula is for the fish.) I've made it with the bread once, and with extra chickpeas all other times, and it's great both ways.

well this was my first sturgeon and what a wonderful fish it is! meaty, firm but not too much, moist and delicious. i usually don't marinate fish for long as it gets mushy but did on this for about 3 hours and it was perfect.even good leftover 2 days later. YUM. the salad was really great and raisins and nuts add something special. i served the pita on the side as soggy bread is yuck. salad lost a bit after 2 days so just make what you can eat and toss the other up fresh later. i had way more charmoula than needed so plan on marinating some chicken in it tonight and yes, i'll be to go with. really good!

Whole Foods had some lovely fresh sturgeon so we took advantage of it to try this recipe. It was delicious and so easy to do. With so many recipes to try and so little time there aren't a lot of recipes we use as "keepers" to make a second time. But this recipe is definitely a "keeper"!

Sturgeon was impossible to find so we used Pink Grouper, per the fish- monger's suggestion. This recipe was excellent and so dinner party friendly. I made the charmoula a day or two before then made the Moroccan salad a few hours before but stirred in the flatbread and walnuts right before serving. We marinated the fish all day & it gave it a great flavor. Baked the flatbread in a very hot oven with great results (after burning two over the gas flame).

This is a great recipe. I was unable to find the sturgeon; Bristol Farms would order it for me at more than 30$ a pound. I found some swordfish on sale and it worked great. Looked great, tasted great and easy to make!

Loved it. My extended family really was impressed.

Ok, I made some major changes, because I had a chicken to cook and I don't like cilantro, but it was delicious and enjoyed by all and I will very probably make it again.

This was an easy recipe to make and the sturgeon was incredible. I noticed I seem to be the first reviewer to use this recipe with the recommended fish. For those who have not tasted sturgeon or who have a hard time purchasing it, keep looking. A firm and tasty white fish with a very smooth delicate taste. The charmoula complimented this fish well. We purchased ours from Whole Foods and the supplier was Mote Marine in Sarasota, Florida. Mote is farm raising sturgeon as a project to encourage others with this ecological positive project. Perhaps contacting either of these locations may give you access to this special fish.

I took suggestions from other review and used the jar of roasted bell peppers to save time. I also used chicken instead of fish (more authentic anyways). The family loved the chicken. My kids thought the salad was too spicy, but my husband and I loved it. It reminded us of our trip to Morocco earlier this year.

Used Chilean sea bass and it was lovely. Very classy presentation, and the flavors are fresh, fragrant, and succulent.

I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts instead of the fish, and it was really delicious. The flatbread toasted over a gas flame had a nice flavour. I will enjoy the leftover salad for lunch, and look forward to making this again. It is also an impressive looking dish, so would make a nice meal for guests.

I used Mahi Mahi, toasted the pita bread, and left out the rasins as well. Yum. I will definitely make this again. leftover bean salad is great on lettuce the next day for lunch.

I tried this last night with a one short cut and a few changes and it was excellent! First of all, I used Mahi-Mahi because I couldn't get Sturgeon. This caused the cooking time to be a bit longer in the oven, about 15-20 minutes. I used jarred roasted peppers to save on time, cut the crushed red pepper down to 1/4 tsp. only because I was serving it to my kids, & omitted the raisins as that would not fly in my house. I also toasted the pita bread so it would be crispy. My 4 year old gobbled it up proclaiming, "Yummy Fish!!!!" A definate keeper for my family.
