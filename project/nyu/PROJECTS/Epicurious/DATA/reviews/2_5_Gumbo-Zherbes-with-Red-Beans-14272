To be honest, this is the 2nd time I've made this. The first time around, I would have agreed with the other reviewers here. This time, I spiced it up by using this site's "Creole Seasoning" and some of the cooking tips from the other Gumbo Z'herbe recipes featured here (like adding cider vinegar and parsley at the end). I omitted carrots by accident and they would have been nice for the shot of color (despite using a yellow pepper). These revamps made for a TASTY vegan gumbo with a mildly spicy bite and will become my new monthly staple (wish I had time to make it more often).

This dish needed a boost. I served it atop of creamy polenta, (recipe with the Andouille Sausage & Shrimp) instead of the white rice. I always have a meat dish and a vegetarian main on my Summer Sunday dinners. This one looked promising for my vegetarian friends.

Wow, what did I do wrong? This tasted mostly like burnt oil (and the roux was fine, I promise). I don't understand how there is supposed to be any flavor in this dish with water as a base and no salt, parmesan, herbs, or spices. Yuck.

Perhaps this dish tastes wonderful, but it's blasphemy to call it gumbo. Who comes up with this stuff?

Yummy, yum, yum. I'm vegan, and I think this dish would please omnivores also. Shame on the person who rated this recipe so poorly without trying it first!

For the Lafayette cook, here in New Orleans, there is a dish called gumbo z'herbes. The recipe I learned from my grandmere is a quite different from this one and very good. I plan to post it soon. The one I used has 7 greens in it a is a staple in my family on New Years Eve.

I didn't even bother to try this recipe, for what's gumbo worth without the usual cajun-seasonings? And then all these vegetables - gumbo doesn't need them. I've forgotten this recipe already.

I would argue with the statement that this type of gumbo is not made in Louisiana. It appears in several restaurants which specialize in gumbo and is delicious. I would spice this recipe up with cajun seasonings, hot sauce, etc.

I made this for my vegetarian husband who is great fan of southern Louisiana culture; I thought that it was somewhat bland, but he, who has never had gumbo with shrimp, chicken or sausage, liked it quite a lot. I added plenty of salt and hot sauce and it grew on me. I may make this again and try different variations on the greens: This time I used only collards.

I made this Gumbo and I suprised my wife with it. It tasted like it had smoked ham in it. I put it over long grain rice and thought it was delicious. We're having friends over tonight and will see their reaction.

This recipe has got to missing something, namely seasonings! I used the recipe as a base and added tons of spices (Cajun seasoning, cayenne, paprika, and Johnny's Seasoning Salt) and herbs (fresh oregano, Italian parsley, and thyme) to the roux. It probably made all the difference. It was great with these additions.

One of the most disappointing recipes ever. A total waste of good greens.
