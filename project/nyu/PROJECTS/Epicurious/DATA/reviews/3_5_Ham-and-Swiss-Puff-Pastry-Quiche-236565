I made a couple changes to this recipe...I don't like mushrooms so I substituted some sauteed onions and red pepper. I also added some frozen spinach, well squeezed to get rid of excess moisture. I used a milder Swiss but it was too mild. I am going to try it again with a stronger cheese. I like the puff pastry better than a traditional crust!

This recipe turned out sooo good. Super easy and fast. I did add a few things, I didn't have ham so I diced up some bacon & cooked until almost crispy. Sauteed onion in bacon drippings for a few. I used 5 eggs, mine weren't exactly large. I would spread the egg mixture as close to the edges as I could next time, it keeps the pastry from puffing as much. I will make this again!

Super delicious and easy weeknight meal. Followed recipe exactly. You could add lots of other toppings to suit your taste.

Wow, this recipe was incredible! I followed the other reviewers' advice and sauteed the mushrooms in a little olive oil first. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written and was so pleased!

This gets an extra fork for being so easy. I took the advice of others and cooked the mushrooms ahead of time, along with a couple of shallots. My kids and husband gobbled this up!

I sauted the mushrooms with onions, too. This is an easy, stress free and elegant alternative to quiche. My first one came out like a quiche pizza and was perfect for the party I took it to.

Very easy and un-scientific. Instead of the toppings called for, I threw it together with some leftover sauteed broccoli rabe, a little proscuitto, and some asiago. Used an extra egg than what was called for in the recipe. Tasty and pretty. Teenagers loved it, too.

Oh wow, just finished a wonderful brunch. I prepared everything beforehand (1/2 recipe)and then assembled it right before popping it into the oven. Reread the reviews and will definitely try some of the variations. This is so easy and so elegant. No muss, no fuss, just a gourmet delight. I do appreciate the reviews and find the tips extremely helpful. If you want to impress your spouse or guests, this is the recipe to use. I prepared a side of potatoes, roasted tomatoes and served with a nice chardonnay. Positively awesome.

I liked this idea and thought that using the frozen puffed pastry crust was a nifty idea that turned out well. I am one of those annoying people who changed the recipe around though... I left out the ham, used shallots as well as mushrooms and sauteed both first. Used thyme instead of rosemary, and gruyere instead of swiss. Was delicious!

I think this recipe is actually a 3 1/2 but I'm giving it a four because - well, what a great idea! I was able to get everything prepped ahead of time and assembled it at the last minute. I added some sauuted shallots and sauted the mushrooms beforehand as well. I was afraid the filling would overflow but that didn't happen. Not even close. Very tasty.

I have to admit. The reviews are an integral part of what I love about epicurious. With this recipe I followed those before and sauteed the mushrooms. The first time I made it with it's original ingredient list and thought it was really good. I have since made it repeatedly switching out the ham for crisped bacon and the rosemary for thyme. One other thing I have changed is raising the temperature to 425 and baking it for the same length of time, I find it helps crisp the bottom. I hesitate to say how often I make this as it has become my staple for taking to work for lunch.

This was delicious with the modifications suggested by other reviewers. Since I only had one sheet of puff pastry, I took a reviewer's advice and put the one sheet in a deep dish pie plate. I needed to roll it out a bit so that it would cover the whole plate. Then I cut and pressed the crust scraps to make an even edge. After putting the pastry in the pie plate, I sprayed the top surface with vegetable oil cooking spray; this helped somewhat in avoiding sogginess. I used fontina instead of swiss since I like a stronger cheese. I reduced the cheese to 1 cup, which was plenty. I still used 1 cup ham. I took others' advice and sauteed the mushrooms first with 2 shallots, adding 1 tsp DRIED rosemary during the last 1 minute of the saute, which worked very well. I think the fresh rosemary would be delicious, but this tasted very good in the absence of fresh. You could definitely substitute whatever omelet ingredients you have on hand as long as all the moisture is cooked out: jarred roasted red peppers; spinach; zucchini; broccoli. I also increased the eggs to 5. I baked it for about 25 minutes until it was no longer jiggly, covering it with foil at the end to avoid over browning. Definitely a keeper and an easy and impressive brunch or dinner with herb roasted potatoes and salad. My 6 and 3 year olds also really liked it, which is a definite plus!

This was great. Like other reviewers, I halved this recipe. I also sauteed the mushrooms with some shallots and a little bit of spinach before putting it on the pastry. Sooo easy, but very tasty. Even tasted good cold as leftovers, as a breakfast on the run.

All my guests LOVED this dish. I only made two changes: 1/2 lb of diced crispy bacon instead of the ham and 1.75 c of sour cream instead of the creme fraiche. I baked it for 1.5hrs and the result was absolutely rich and tasty.

Rating: 4
I have gotten a lot of mileage out of this recipe! I use it whenever I have overnight guests or at family holiday gatherings. I prefer to use creme fraiche if it's available, but sour cream works just as well. I use just one sheet of puff pastry, and 4 or 5 eggs and bake the quiche in a standard pie pan until it's not jiggly anymore. I love the pastry crust but have also used regular pie crust in a pinch. You can toss in whatever sort of omelette-type ingredients you have in the fridge. I often use up leftover veggies, but saute in a little olive oil and toss them into the egg mixture.

I found this to be very disappointing. As I usually try to do, I followed the recipe exactly as written for my first trial. I think the puff pastry is too delicate in texture and too distinct in its own flavor for the heaviness of the other ingredients. They just didn't go together. I would try using a different pastry, or use a more delicate filling with the puff pastry. Overall, the taste was "cheap commercial," what one would expect from a drive thru window. Sorry...

Made this recipe as mini quiches/puffs. Substituted pancetta for half the ham. Sauteed the pancetta, drained pancetta on paper towel. Sauteed mushrooms in a teaspoon of pancetta fat with two teaspoons of fresh thyme. Used frozen puff pastry, rolled it out sheet to about 10 by 13 inches. Cut out rounds. Lined mini muffin molds with puff pastry, added the mixture of ham pancetta, cheese and mushrooms. Then filled it with egg mixture. With silicone muffin molds the quiches come out real easy. Excellent, keeper!

Love this recipe! I sauteed the mushrooms, with some onion, fresh thyme and rosemary before adding it to the crust. HUGE hit at brunch! It only took about 18 minutes to cook but that could be because we were using the oven all moring.

This is easy and really tasty. Great for a brunch. The puff pastry I get sort of naturally breaks into three strips about 4 inches wide. I used it that way, then cut into 2 inch strips after baking. Made for a nice form factor for a "walking around" brunch event. You can also play with teh fillings on the three strips then (one veggie, for example) as you please. Like others suggested, I added some diced shallots & thyme, and sauteed the mushroom, shallots, thyme and rosemary together before putting it all together. It was a huge hit at my brunch. Really tasty, and even with the saute effort added it's still very easy to make.

This dish is fabulous, quick and easy! I have made this several times and my guests rave about it every time. I followed the recipe except I took the advice of other reviews and sauteed the mushrooms first to remove the excess water and I added 1/2 of a chopped onion as well. Swiss is best, but sometimes I used cheddar because it was all that I had at the time and that works well too. This is my staple breakfast/brunch recipe when we have out of town guests staying with us. As a bonus, it's great the next day microwaved.

This dish was really simple. I added sauted onions and used gruyere cheese. I also made mine in a pie plate with only one pastry. It was exceptionally good. It kind of tasted like my mom's breakfast casserole. Mom was pleased since it was Mother's day!

Very rich and rather salty, but I liked that. Next time I will cook some of the moisture out of the mushrooms before adding them to the cheese and ham. I'll also leave a larger margin for the crust, as the egg mixture ran a bit too much.

I made this for Easter brunch and it was delicious and easy, everyone enjoyed it. It was a nice change from the usual 'eggy' quiche. I did not use mushrooms (because of one mushroom hater in the group) but did add half an onion that I cooked briefly. I will admit that I was wondering how it was going to come together without making a huge mess, but it did looked beautiful.

I cut the pastry into circles and omitted the ham. I sauted 2 leeks and 1/4 C. sweet onions and the 2C. mushrooms, chopped until most of the juices were out. I tossed the juices and spread all on the puff pastry. I added 1.t dijon mustard to the egg mix and cut the cooled rounds into 12 wedges. Served them at a bridal shower and was loved! Was still crispy the next day too.

I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and sauteed the mushrooms with 1/2 c. onion in 2T. olive oil before adding it to the ham/cheese layer. Ran out of swiss so used half cheddar. Used low-fat sour cream and could definitely see adding spinach or substituting sausage crumbles for the ham. A great take on quiche.

Don't listen to the cook from Austin. This recipe is superb once you modify it a bit & use a little creativity. I sauteed the mushrooms with 1/2 cup chopped onion using 2 TBSP olive oil for about 4 min. Then I threw in about 3/4 cup chopped fresh spinach & continued sauteeing about 1 min. more. We had some friends over for brunch & one of the men who calls himself "the breakfast king" was highly satisfied. I'll definitely make this one a keeper!

This dish was extremely easy to make and the results were wonderful. Many complements at our brunch. I too sauteed the mushrooms with a small amount of chopped onion prior to topping the quiche. Do not leave more than the recommended 1/2 inch border as this plain pastry is not very exciting to eat & will get left behind. Fresh rosemary is a must. Used lite sour cream instead of full-fat version.

I highly recommend this recipe. It wasn't too eggy like other quiche I have made. I did saute the mushrooms first. Also, I used a 9 in' pie crust as my base instead of the frozen puff pastry. The family are not swiss cheese fans, so I used medium cheddar. The recipe still turned out wonderful. For those who enjoy spice: crushed red pepper sprinkled over the top is fantastic. Next time I'm going to try adding spinach and cutting the cheddar with some pepper jack to increase the spice level. I was very impressed with this recipe.

Great QUICK recipe that will impress! I took advice from a previous review and cooked the mushrooms-- I chose to add a small onion to the pan and cooked that with the mushrooms. I also substituted turkey for ham and, as I forgot to top the first layer with the cheese (I only had extra sharp cheddar), I topped the dish with the cheese 5 minutes before it was done and returned it to the oven. Rave reviews!! Good hot or at room temp! Am considering doing a sweet version of it by adding brown sugar and some vanilla to the sour cream mixture and using fresh berries as the bottom layer... maybe some marcapone somewhere or just topping it all with whipped cream or icecream?? This is so quick and easy that it puts you in a creative mood!

This was excellent, I ended up using brie cheese as I couldn't find any swiss, I also followed the recommendation of the cook from New Boston and folded over the puff pastry, it was delicious.

Found this great recipe while looking for something to do with leftover Easter ham.! Best of all, it is easy to manipulate if you don't have all of the ingredients. For example, I didn't have swiss cheese, and so substituted brie and cheddar. I also had only one puff pastry sheet, and so halved the recipe, placed the ingredients on one side of the pastry and folded it over like a calzone. Delicious. Fresh rosemary a must.

Everyone enjoyed this recipe. I did saute the mushrooms first to reduce the liquid. A delcious, easier version of quiche. The rosemary and swiss cheese were a tasty combination. I wouldn't hesitate to try other combinations.

This turned out very well & was very easy. My only negative comment is that the mushrooms produced an AWFUL lot of liquid! I actually had to soak up some of the liquid with a paper towel so that the crust wouldn't get soggy. Maybe saute them quickly beforehand? Or use a different, less watery vegetable?

To the cook from Buffalo, unflavored Greek yogurt would work well. It's thicker than regular yogurt.

I love quiche and would like to try this recipe with Christmas ham leftovers. My problem with this recipe is the sour cream- I hate the stuff. Any suggestions for a substitute?

This was a great twist on a classic. The puff pastry is a nice change from the traditional pie crust. It bakes flat and the puff pastry puffs up around the sides. You could add more meat or change the veggie out. You could also prepare ahead of time, then pour on the ingredients when you were ready to bake.
