I am a lover of chocolate lava cakes and am often disappointed at restaurants when they are not molten. This recipe was very easy to make, tasted great and was truly molten. I made the recipe and refrigerated the ramekins while we ate dinner. The trick is really greasing the ramekins very well so they come out easily when hot from the oven. I used a vegetable spray and coated the bottoms and sides really well. I put the ramekins on a baking sheet into the 450 degree oven for 13 minutes. I loosened the edges all the way around with a small paring knife and they came out cleanly. Do not let them sit in the hot ramekins, as they will continue baking. I dusted the tops with sifted confectioners sugar and decorated the plate with mixed berries.

I gave this three forks because the mint fudge sauce is not great and unnecessary. Next time I will do what others here have done and make a raspberry or caramel sauce to go with them. The cakes themselves were fantastic and so incredibly easy! I am passing this recipe around.

Rating: 4
Great recipe, I skipped the mint sauce and instead pureed some frozen raspberries with sugar. Makes enough to barely fill 5 ramekins. Add a teaspoon of espresso to the batter to intensify the chocolate flavor. I not only butter, but also flour, the ramekins for easier removal (i.e. smear butter on the inside, then dust with flour).

Quadrupled this for a dinner party for 20 and it was amazing. Used a seedless raspberry sauce with whipped cream and raspberries which was the perfect compliment for the over the top rich chocolate flavor. I used 6 ounce pyrex dishes for 11 minutes from room temp. Over cooked the trial batch and they're definitely best runny. So don't overcook. Let that center be pretty jiggely.

it was fun watching the chocolate ooze from the cake, but boy it is sweet!!! I'll try it again with less sugar next time. And yes, it was easy to make.

For whatever reason, people get it in their minds that "lava cakes" are challenging to make and something that must cost $9 at a fancy restaurant. how silly. these are wonderful all on their own (skip the mint sauce- dont need it) or with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream. Super easy to create and your guests with freak out. Sometimes I even cheat and make these with open bags of chocolate chips or half-eaten bars of dark chocolate. Always delish. Watch the tops when cooking- right before they look done, pull them out for a toothpick test. breaking one open will make you smile every time.

I have wanted to make Molten Chocolate Cake for a long time but wanted a fairly simple recipe. This was it. They turned out really great. I did not use the Mint Sauce because my family members are not big mint fans. So I made a caramel sauce and spooned it on the plates, sprinkled with a bit of sea salt, and a scoop of ice cream. Decadent!!

I've eaten many times in restaurants but first time ever making molten cakes at home and it was unbelievably simple and delicious. Even got the center to ooze chocolate! Will definitely make over and over again. I divided the batter into eight 4oz ramkins and they were perfect individual servings. Served with raspberry sorbet and fresh raspberries. Skipped the sauce.

We make this recipe all the time and it is our family favorite - my children have even made it at college for their friends because whenever they order it out, it is not as good as when we make it at home. I do make a different sauce because I don't particularly like the consistency of this one.

I make this dessert all the time! Great recipe for dinner parties. So easy yet seems very fancy. I make in advance and keep in the fridge and pop in the oven for 14 minutes and serve fresh! I'm not a chocolate/mint person - so I serve it with a little whipped cream and some fresh raspberries. Always a hit!

You would not BELIEVE the gifts I've gotten in return for making this. Every time my husband has a sweet tooth, he begs me to make these and I always slyly say, "Okay, but what do I get in return?" He doesn't know they only take about 20 minutes tops! I've gotten all the windows of our huge four-bedroom full-windowed walls washed. I've gotten all the floors vacuumed and swept. I've gotten the entire kitchen cleaned from top to bottom - all just so my husband can have these cakes!! I think I'm going to see if I can get something from Tiffany's next; these cakes are definitely worth it!

not rating yet as has not made it yet til tonite, will be following ideas from other members as they all great ideas but for all those who left out the mint i thought how about adding a little mint to the cake itself and having ice-cream to follow and may break up a pepprmint bar and sprinkle on top just for that extra little mint bite cant wait to try :)

If I were on death row, this would be my request for my last meal! My husband and I refer to it as the "Death Row Dessert." It's lick-the-plate good!! I did add the teaspoon of vanilla to the cake batter as others recommended. Vanilla ice cream is a must to balance the rich chocolate of the cake's oozy center and the delectable mint chocolate sauce. The cakes took exactly 13 minutes in my oven. Turn off the computer and go make this for your family--they will love you for it. If you make it for a boyfriend/girlfriend, be prepared for a marriage proposal.

Colorado..sorry..you need only one stick of butter plus two tablespoons from a 2nd stick of butter. One stick is 4ozs. (or 8tbs/) and then two more Tbs from the second stick of butter would be 10Tbs.. or a total of 6 ozs.Good luck.. L Jones

To Colorado wanting info regarding measurements for ozs.etc. IF you check your stick of butter they usually show how many ozs to a stick. Ea stick is 4ozs for 8Tbs. so one and one/half sticks would be 10Tbs butter. I hope I didn't confuse you. Good Luck.I'm off to make the cake now.

This is now my kids' favorite dessert. I follow the directions exactly - use the best quality 60% cacao chocolate - and they always come out perfectly. I also dust with cocoa powder and 14 minutes is the right timing for my oven. I keep them in the refrigerator, uncooked, and pop one or two in the oven after dinner for whomever wants one. I've kept them for three or four days, uncooked. A great, fresh dessert at a moments' notice.

DELICIOUS. We made these with a raspberry/blueberry sauce instead of the fudge sauce (redundant much?) and they were SO good. We cooked ours for about 16 minutes, from the fridge, and I thought they were perfect, though some may want more molten-ness. Ghiradelli chocolate was perfectly sufficient. Really impressive presentation with a minimum of work. :)

Rating: 4
WOW! This is really a great molten chocolate cake recipe! I tried several Alton Brown's from food network and was quite disappointed. However, this one was perfect! I do suggest using a premium baking chocolate such as valrhona (le noir 61 or 58%) or scharffen berger (62 or 70%)

I haven't made the sauce, just used vanilla ice cream and strawberries to garnish. The cake is excellent. I used a 175 ml pyrex ramekin and I think that's the perfect size. It yields 7 cakes. For me the more of the melted center the better. 15 minutes were the exact amount of time to have the cake just cooked enough.

Rating: 4
Wonderful and so easy to make! 11 minutes was definitely the perfect amount of time to yield a molten center. Not so great for leftovers, as the center was not soft the second day, but still tasty. Will definitely make again, with or without the mint sauce.

PLEASE HELP I DO NOT KNOW HOW THE CHOCOLATE GETS IN THE CENTER TO OOZE OUT. THANKS

3 forks as written but 4 if changes are made. As many others mention, it needs a flavor boost. I used a Tablespoon of espresso to bring out that chocolate flavor. Also, timing is key. My first attempt the cake slid right out of the buttered ramekin but was way underdone. Second attempt went better at 14 minutes in the oven. Do some trial and error before serving guests!

I have made this numerous times and each time it has come out great. After the first few times of making it, I started adding one or two TBS liquer - whatever I have on hand - to give it a slight flavor boost.

Impressive and very chocolatey ! I used cocoa powder instead of sugar. Added a little vanilla essence to the mixture. Didn't make the sauce instead served it with vanilla ice cream, Yum ! I've got one question for any members out there... what's the weight ( in oz or gram ) for 10 tablespn of butter ? Kind of difficult to measure butter ! Weighing it on a scale is easier so would appreciate anyone who can tell me what's 10 tbspn ?! Thanks

Fabuloso! Frankly, any recipe that has 345 reviews must be good. But, took some suggestions and ... buttered and sugared my ramekins; filled them half way only; added 1 tsp. vanilla; cooked approx. 17 minutes after having filled ramekins in the fridge for 2 hours. Will make for my next dinner party and serve simply with dusting of powdered sugar, and vanilla whipped cream.

Made this dessert for Valentine's dinner and it was delicious. I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate for the cake and baked them in standard ramekins (buttered and lightly dusted with sugar). The batter filled 6 ramekins to about 1/4 inch shy of the rim. I was worried they would overflow when I baked them but they puffed straight up without spilling over. I cooked them for 14 minutes (as I had prepped them about 2 hours in advance and had them in the fridge). The were just right -- cake-like on the outside and molten on the inside. I am a purist so I did not make the chocolate mint sauce and just served them with vanilla ice cream. They were divine and my guests finished every single bite! Next time I will try with a higher quality chocolate to see if it enhances the flavor.

Simply put, the best chocolate dessert I have ever had. And so easy to make! If cooked just right, this dessert will make anyone look like a chef. I have made this with the peppermint sauce before, but decided to serve it with a raspberry one last night... it was better! The raspberry sauce can be found on tis site, it's the one that uses frozen raspberries, jam and lemon. I drizzled the sauce decoratively on and around the cakes and served with vanilla bean ice cream, everyone at the dinner party cleaned their plate. Yum!

Rating: 3
Using the fork descriptors, I thought this was delicious, not exceptional. It was very easy to make and serve. It looked and tasted great and had some of the "wow" factor given that the chocolate oozes out of the center. However, I agree with other reviewers that the cake needed an extra flavor boost. I did use 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon chili powder, and Scharffenberger chocolate. But it wasn't enough. Perhaps next time I will add more chili spice or use espresso instead. I will, however, make this again!

Rating: 4
Delicious! A huge hit. They look very impressive and are actually pretty easy to make. Everyone I've made them for wants them again and again. I recommend the raspberry sauce instead of the mint as well. My only difficulty was getting them out of the ramekins - make sure you grease and flour those EXTREMELY well. Otherwise they break as they come out and that ruins the whole 'molten' effect. Next time I'm going to try adding some vanilla and a bit of Kahlua.

Delicious. My cakes rose perfectly, and were decadent with ice cream and the fudge sauce. My only warning is to not over-bake, which is very easy -- my first batch had gooey centers, but no gush of chocolate. The second batch I took out two minutes earlier and they were perfect.

This is fantastic. I bake it in 5 ounce ramkins for 10 minutes at 450 degrees. I also whip the eggs with the sugar until it's thick and pale. I then add the chocolate mixture (I usually use semi-sweet Callebaut) and add two TBS of coffee or hazelnut liqueur to the chocolate mixture. I don't make the mint sauce. Instead, I place a scoop or two of vanilla icecream on top of the cake and pour chocolate over it. Garnish with caramel sauce. Heavenly!

The cakes are wonderful if you make them as directed. However, I wouldn't bother with the mint sauce --overkill! Some vanilla ice cream, or peppermint if you're looking for a mint element, is delicious alongside. We tried it with both types of ice cream and were all moaning with pleasure!

After reading everyone's comments and lots of recipes, I made this version of the cakes, only I increased the chocolate to 6 ounces and used bittersweet. I baked off one cake to taste it, and found it flat, lacking 'depth of flavor. I added one tablespoon of espresso to another cake, and baked that off...the results were like night and day. The chocolate popped out and there was depth...this was sublime! I tried a bit of vanilla in another cake and again, got a better depth of flavor. So the trick is to add something to make the chocolate rich and really pop. Tonight I am adding Kaluha before baking to see what happens..try your favorite chocolate combo...maybe...raspberry liquor? I did not make the mint sauce, will serve w/whipped cream as a garnish. The cakes really do not need additional embellishment...enjoy!

Usually, I am a pretty decent baker. However, I really underbaked this dessert (even though I cooked for 12 minutes), and when I turned over the first cup, the bottom half was still batter. So, I must admit that I put the rest of the dozen in the microwave for 30 seconds, four at a time. If that doesn't screw up a dessert, nothing can. They were fabulous--served with ice cream and whipped cream (why choose just one?).

I didn't make the mint sauce; as a fudge sauce seemed a bit redundant with a molten chocolate cake, but substituted raspberry jam (strained the seeds) and vanilla ice cream. I baked at 425 (Just insurance. I tend to burn things.) for exactly 11 minutes, and I think that they could have come out a minute sooner. All of my ingredients were at room temp. Everyone loved it and scraped their plates clean; but it was a bit rich for me, so I left a few bites. Don't be tempted to overcook because the lava flow of chocolate is spectacular.

These were fantastic! I think I over baked them. One fell apart when I was trying to take it out and the center oozed out. So, afraid that the others would do the same, I cooked them too long. I would definitely NOT cook them more than 14 min. just ignore your fears! Despite all this, the cakes were wonderful! I made the sauce (which is a must as it makes up for over baked centers) but left out the mint. Instead I put in some almond extract and 3/4 c. pureed raspberries. Serve this with a good quality vanilla ice cream, such as hagendas, and you can't go wrong! Even my father (who refuses to eat things that he can tell is rich) got seconds. Believe it or not these are even good the second day, though they will taste more like brownies. Be sure to butter and dust the ramekins VERY well. These would really be good no matter how badly you messed up the recipe.

I would like to try making this again, but I'll share my mistakes first! 1) do not overcook; the "molten" center will overflow out of the cake and down the sides of your souffles! 2) Use bittersweet, not semi-sweet chocolate if you want them rich. (Someone else said it ended up tasting like milk chocolate, and I agree completely.) 3) My ramekins were 1/2c, not 3/4c, and I had enough for 8. I just wish I had adjusted my cook time appropriately! Used raspberry coulis instead of mint sauce - it was still a tasty dessert.

I have died and gone to chocolate heaven... This dessert is ridiculously good. I made it for my boyfriend's extended family, and everyone (even the one, non-chocolate lover) ate every single morsel. We made a chocolate fudge sauce and sliced a round carton of ice cream into circles which we placed in the center of the plate - a foundation for the cakes when they were done. A little sprinkled powdered sugar on top, and the dessert was ready to be devoured. Everyone was so impressed - including me. DELICIOUS and a major hit!

Probably one of my most popular recipes. It is quick, easy and absoulutely outstanding. I do substitute bittersweet chocolate as it is my prefered version of chocolate especially in this recipe. The mint sauce is quite good but not a necessity. Sometimes we just add a touch of vanilla ice cream or a raspberry puree. I've made this at least a dozen times and now my teenagers often make it themselves when we have a crowd coming over. This is a winner!

I was really disappointed by these, especially seeing Gale Gand's name associated with the recipe. Like a previous reviewer stated, the cakes were very light, airy and *eggy*. The outcome was not the rich, molten, semi-sweet or dark chocolate flavor I was expecting from the recipe. The taste was lighter, not as sweet and more like milk chocolate oddly enough.

Excellent "company" dessert since the cakes can sit in the fridge until ready to bake. I increased the chocolate by 1 oz and used high quality bittersweet, substituted 1/2 c. cocoa for part of the powdered sugar and increased the baking time as I don't like THAT much ooze. Used my own (better) chocolate sauce, adding mint, and it worked well over the ice cream. Sauce tops it off nicely and allows you to garnish with fresh mint. Guests loved it.

This is the one chocolate recipe that all others keep getting compared to. Absolutely wonderful and if you don't tell your guests that it's molten inside, then they get a delightful suprise when they cut it open. Absolutely fabulous and very easy to make and present.

I usually make it early in the day for a nighttime dinner party...that way, I just have to pop it in the oven to bake. I, too, bake it a few minutes longer than called for. Also, be sure to let it "rest" for 5-10 minutes before serving. I have never made the sauce - it just seems like overkill.

For die-hard milk chocolate lovers this was a great excuse to eat a plate of molten milk chocolate. While I loved the recipe for what it was, I was coming to the table with different expectations. I'd like something with a little more cake, and a dollop of melted sauce in the middle. This was a cake-crust swimming in pooled chocolate sauce. I should bake it longer, you say? Still the cake was thin and spongey, as you would get with an egg-laden batter, and it was definitely *milk-chocolate* tasting, even though I made it with semi-sweet chocolate. I think this recipe could be altered to be darker and more substantial, but would require some tinkering. On the otherhand, a milk-chocolate lover who shared it with me loved it and can't wait to make it again!

I did not make the sauce but the combination cake-ice cream was good enough. The cake is excellent. I cut out parchment circles and put on bottom of remekings before greasing and did not have trouble unmolding. This recipe is a huge hit!!!!

Excellent! The best molten cake recipe I've tried. Unmolding was tricky - I ended up serving in ramekins, but guests didn't mind! Rave reviews. I used an organic mint extract, and didn't find flavor overpowering.

Very good. Next time I'll make 7, not 6. They are very rich, plus an extra one is good to have because removing them from the hot ramekins is very tricky. I cooked room-temp batter for 14 minutes and they were just right.

This is an easy way to impress guests. Most restaurants have something similar on their desert menus. It is easy to make both the cake batter and the mint sauce ahead of time, however it took more than 14 minutes (closer to 20) to cook the refrigerated batter to a point where it was set on the outside. The mint sauce was excellent and, as per other suggestions, i only used 1/2 teaspoon of mint extract.

Rating: 3
Great recipe! I tried some of the modifications given by the previous reviewer (no change in ingredients, just quantities), but the cakes weren't cooked enough after 8 minutes. However, the flavor was divine!!! I made the sauce (made it less minty) but think that I'll leave it out next time. It's already so chocolatey, and the molten part of the cake ends up being sauce-like. Who knows, I may change my mind after trying it. I will say that I prefer this cake to the one with spices, also on this site.

As the Executive Pastry Chef at the Lodge at Pebble Beach, I tried about 10 different versions of this type recipe, including Jean Georges. I liked Gales version the best. I made a couple adjustments: I use 1 cup of powdered sugar and added 1/4 cup brown sugar to compliment the dark notes in the chocolate;(in my kitchen I use Sharfenberger 63%), I addded another 1/2 oz. chocolate, for a total weight of 5.5 oz. and I only added 1/4 cup all purpose flour instead of the 1/2 cup. I bake them in a 3 oz. ramekin sprayed and lined with sugar which gives them a nice little crust. I bake them from the refrigerator, at 400* for 8 minutes, and they come out perfect. Cudos to Gayle!!

When I served this to my guests for dessert last night, the response was an overwhelming 'WOW!'. So elegant and yet so simple to make. For the mint sauce I substituted 1/2 cup cold peppermint tea instead of the water and extract which seemed to offer a more subtle mint flavour than the one previous reviewers complained of.

Rating: 3
I disagree with the previous reviewer. I think the mint sauce is essential. Afterall, what makes a dessert excellent, IMO, is the CONTRAST of flavors, textures and temperatures. I'll admit that the next time I make this, I will make the mint flavor a little subtler than what this recipe calls for, but don't fear the mint sauce.

Rating: 4
Forget about the mint sauce. If you really want sauce, which isn't necessary, leave out the mint. My mom feels the chocolate sauce has a different consistency from the oozing chocolate. She thinks the sauce is a must, but again, without the mint. Don't forget the iced cream or whipped cream...Wonderful.

Very good, I think it would have been worthy of four forks with top-notch chocolate. I used Guittard's (SF) semi-sweet, but I would have liked something richer. I'll try a different chocolate brand next time, and probably substitute in some dark chocolate.

This was one of the most delicious, decadent chocolate desserts ever. I didn't make the sauce but did everything else as written. I used 4 oz. semisweet and 1 oz. bittersweet chocolate. I think next time I would use a 3/2 ratio. It was easy, you could make it ahead (which I did), and it was PERFECT.

I didn't rate this because 1) I made a subsitution (the suggested 1/2 C cocoa for 1/2 C of the powdered sugar) and 2) I got distracted and overbaked them. The centers turned out fudgey rather than liquid. Still tasted good- served with van. ice cr and raspberry sauce. Will try it again, good chocolatey taste. Made it ahead of time for valentines day.

I just made this for a very special Valentine's Day dinner party with some friends. Chocolate is a must for Valentine's Day, so these were perfect. It was my first time making them. I didn't make the sauce, I just served them very warm from the oven with a premium vanilla ice cream. Oh my goodness, they were wonderful and very easy to make. I made them in the morning and as dinner was being served, I just set them on the counter to bring them up to room temp and then just popped them in the oven right at the end of dinner. Do not overcook. The time in the recipe is way too long, even if you make them ahead and refrigerate. I took the advice of other cooks and just watched them for the right "doneness". Turned out perfect! A must dessert!

These cakes are wonderful and so easy to do. You can prepare these the day before and just bake after dinner as you put the coffee on! Also, for those of you who decided not to make the mint fudge sauce, I urge you to try it at least once. It really is YUMMY! I also serve this with a respberry sauce...This really WOWS the crowd and with very little effort!

I made this for Valentine's Day and it was out of this world. I used a little extra chocolate than the recipe called for, half bittersweet and half semi-sweet. I used four souffle cups, which were buttered and lightly dusted with sugar. I took them out of the fridge about 1/2 hour before putting them in the oven and baked them directly on the oven rack for 13 minutes exactly. I let them rest for a few minutes and they unmolded perfectly. Served with raspberry sauce and french vanilla ice cream. I don't think that you need to make the mint fudge sauce...I am definitely making these again.

This recipe was lacking in sweetness. The presentation is great and it is easy to make. However, I want a lava cake that is so sweet I feel it will melt the enamel off my teeth. It was very dull. I did not try the sauce.

My guests swooned over these. Took them out of the fridge about 1/2 hr before I baked them and baked for 13 mins. They were still very oozy in the middle. Don't bother with the Mint sauce. It over powers the chocolate cake and is totally unnecessary with the sauce that comes out of the cake.

I made these for my daughter's 30th birthday last night and they were so wonderful. Followed another reviewer's suggestion and did not make the sauce. Honestly, I do not think it is necessary. Used Callebaut chocolate, rum, and Tillamook vanilla ice cream. Can't wait to make again.

The presentation was beautiful, but an awesome chocolate taste was missing. I did substitute 1 oz of unsweetened for the bittersweet and would probably up the ante to half unsweetened and half bittersweet. Or maybe I'll just try the other molton chocolate recipe on this site.

I thought these were great. I made them for my mum's birthday dinner. Using 3/4 c ramekins there was more than enough batter for 6 cakes. I just buttered the ramekins, didn't bother with the flour, and they came out fine. Due to my wonky oven, I had the cakes in for only 9 minutes and they were perfect (I had to do a couple of test runs, and 11 minutes almost cooked them through completely). I didn't bother with the mint fudge sauce and just served them with rasberry sauce and vanilla ice cream. My family loved them.

A chocoholics dream! Definately keep this one in your memory and keep ingredients on hand for last minute get togethers. I have made these over a dozen times and have fun adding many types of flavorings or even nuts etc... (I'm going to try white chocolate next!) It is so easy to make ahead and freeze individually (bring to room temp or fridge temp before cooking). I use xtra large muffin pans. Skip the sauce and use whipped cream or ice cream. Follow cooking times exactly, they are perfect every time!

This was almost TOO chocolatey - if that's possible! And I'm a chocolate lover. I made a couple of modifications to this recipe in terms of flavoring. I added: 1. 1 tablespoon vanilla 2. 1 teaspoon instant espresso powder 3. A splash of dark rum This played up the flavor of the chocolate and made the ooey-gooey center even more delicious! I would definitely skip the sauce and just serve with a puff of whipped cream.

Rating: 4
Wonderful dessert! Rich and deep chocolate flavor with fabulous textures. I've served this for friends who are chocolate fanatics and they have all melted over this dessert. Based on other reviews, I didn't bother with the sauce and didn't miss it. Definitely use high quality chocolate. I used Sharffenberger bittersweet, and it really "makes" this dish. (Their chocolate is pricey, but well worth it. You can buy it on their web site for a bit cheaper than what you'd find in the store). Bittersweet chocolate with the powdered sugar creates the right balance of chocolate flavor and sweetness...I would think that using semi-sweet chocolate (as the recipe says you can) would make the dish too sweet. I used 4 - 7 oz. ramekins and it worked great! The cakes come out clean if you just butter the sides and run a knife along the edges when done. Fabulous dessert!

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe, this is VERY easy and impressive. 1) DEFINITELY butter the ramekins so that they come out easier. Instead of using flour, I've also found that cocoa powder instead works fine, it is a lot more aesthetic than flour. In other words, generously butter your ramekins and then sprinkle cocoa powder on them. 2) I use 3/4 cup ramekins and fill them 3/4 of the way. 3) The key of course is not to overcook/undercook this. There is around a tolerance of 2 minutes, which is pretty lenient. I bake until the tops just start to puff but are still shimmery. You'll want to let them sit for a few minutes before turning over to let the top settle, my rule of thumb is to wait until the ramekins are cold enough to handle. 4) Don't waste your time on the mint sauce, the cakes are sweet/rich enough so I would compliment with frozen raspberries. Get a package, process it with its syrup for less than a second. 5) You can also get creative if you want a different top (i.e. what becomes the top after you overturn). I'll do stuff like stick nuts or white chocolate on the bottom of the ramekin. It's not necessary, and certainly the base recipe is good enough, it may not even taste better. But this is just something to mess around with in case you get bored of making 20 or what not of the same cake for a party. 6) Serve this immediately or the filling will continue cooking and turn into more of a pudding. 7) Use fresh eggs if you're concerned about the dangers of consuming raw eggs, note that the middle is basically barely-warmed batter that contains eggs and yolks. To give an idea, if you put chocolate chips into the middle of the batter, the chips will not even melt, that's how cool it is.

Quick, easy, but most especially chocolatey! I used Scharffen-Berger chocolate but I'm sure a less expensive chocolate would work as well. Baked for the recommended time and came out cakey on the outside and oozed with chocolate in the middle. Omitted the sauce and just served with Vanilla ice cream. Awesome! We only baked 2 last night and will have the rest for dessert tonight! Used 7oz. ramekins instead of custard cups - turned out fine (but didn't have enough for 6 servings, just about 5. I only had 4 ramekins and filled those first, baked 2 of them, put the other 2 in the fridge. After we ate the first 2, I washed out the ramekin and scraped in the remaining batter for the 5th serving). Try it, you'll like it!

This cake is incredible. Everytime I go out to eat, I am on a quest for that perfect chocolate cake, slightly crispy on the outside, and liquidy in the middle, and now I cannot believe that it is so EASY for me to replicate at home! Unbelievably fantastic. I made this for a special New Year's Eve dinner and it was a hit. My suggestions: leave out the sauce, definitely use high-quality chocolate, and serve with a high-quality vanilla ice cream.

Just today, someone asked for a tried and true chocolate molton cake, this one immediatly came to mind. I have been making it for quite some time and it never fails. I never made the sauce, but instead have made raspberry sauce. Try the dessert cold, its delicious and fudgy.

I gave this recipe 3 forks because my family loved it. However, I found it to be MUCH too sweet, and not nearly chocolaty enough for my taste. I will make it again, as the texture of the batter/cake was perfect, but I will have to experiment with the amount of sugar/chocolate. I think replacing 1/2 c. of the powdered sugar with cocoa powder would help, as would doubling the amount of chocolate used and maybe using some unsweetened chocolate in addition to the bittersweet. Luckily, I served this with a very tart raspberry sauce that helped cut the sweetness.

I have made this recipe since it was published and everyone loves them. We have never made the mint sauce and usually don't have a topping. They are so easy!! My 13 yr old son was so nuts over them that he made a double batch and kept the batter in the refrig for several days. Anytime family or guests hinted at a sweet tooth, he would pop these in the oven and have an instant hit. A great dessert to start off the new year.

This dessert is delicious. I made it for family for Christmas Eve. and my chocolate-crazed brother-in-law thought they were amazing. I am making them again tonight for New Year's at the request of a friend. There have been some mixed reviews about the sauce. I too thought it was a bit overpowering so I decided to omit the unsweetened chocolate this time around. I just used Valrhona semisweet chocolate (as I did in the cakes) and the sauce is delicious. It is much better balanced. This is a sneaky little recipe because it comes out so good and it is almost too easy!

Rating: 3
Great recipe. This was a big hit at Christmas - it's an easy but impressive dish. I skipped the mint sauce and it wasn't missed. I made the cakes ahead of time and kept them chilled overnight. Because they were so cold, the 14 minutes of cooking was not quite enough. I would have preferred the cakes be a bit firmer. Next time I will increase the cooking time by 1-2 minutes (if I prepare them ahead of time).

These are delicious and absurdly easy, though whenever I serve them my guests can't believe they're not hard to make.

I made some the same day, 11 minutes, and some after refrigeration, 14 minutes, and they were perfect. I LOVE this recipe!!

This is a spectacular dessert guaranteed to have your guests begging for more. I've made it many times since it was first published, and it is so easy...always make it the day ahead and refrigerate to allow me time to work on other preparations...and have also frozen them successfully. I have never made the mint sauce however, but make a raspberry sauce by pureeing frozen raspberries in a processor, add a little Chambord to taste. Put a puddle of this on the plate, top with the cake and a small scoop of good quality vanilla bean ice cream...and go to HEAVEN. I'm making it yet again this Saturday for a holiday dinner party...friends have been calling this week to request it!

I thought this was one of the best chocolate cake recipes I have eaten in a very long time. I too found the first one I took out of the oven very soupy after 11 minutes. I put them back in and for several more minutes and was certainly able to plate them but still would of like to bake them just a couple more minutes. I too served with a very rich vanilla ice cream so the extra chocolate sauce gooing out of the middle worked just great. I think you just need to know your own oven and experiement. Luckily I only needed four so I had some room for error. I started the batter out at room temperature so next time I know they will take at least 14 minutes and perhaps a couple more. Be sure you butter the ramekins very well so the cake will slip right out. I will be making this many more times. It is easy to make and can be made ahead of time with most ingredients from my pantry.

After all the great reviews, I thought this would be the perfect dessert for my dinner party tomorrow night. I baked a one of the ramekins just now for trial, and my god, it was a total disaster. I followed the recipe and all customer comments but allthough the top of the cake cracked in 11 minutes it was all soupy. I baked for another 2 minutes an the cake didn't come out. Finally when it did, it didn't look presentable at all and was way too sweet. I am planning to make some more batter tomorrow without any sugar to reduce the sweetness but I don't know what to do about the consistency and the look. I would really appreciate if someone could help before I throw everything away...

This was an easy recipes especially since I made the sauce the 2 days before my dinner party and the cake batter a day before. I made the mistake of baking the cakes in a water bath(to protect my dishes) this didn't allow the bottom of the cakes to bake fully. The cakes were still delectible and enjoyed by my guests; the plates were licked clean! This recipe is easily doubled, however I would not double the sauce recipe. Enjoy!

Awww, can't I give out five forks??? My husband and I are totally obsessed over this little gooey cake. This is by far his most-requested dessert.

It tastes fabulous, regardless.

I agree with Gilly (below), I accompanied thes cakes with home made French vanilla ice cream - fantastic! raves from everyone, including those who "don't eat dessert". I did not use the mint sauce, however. I dressed the cakes with a little powdered sugar sprinkled on top, a mint leaf or two as garnish and gave guest a choice of 3 ice creams instead. also, iserved this with a muscat beaumes de venise - what a hit! I increased the recipe to accommodate 8 guests but would definitly double in the future for those who wanted seconds.

My guests went wild for this dessert. A definite keeper, as my husband says. The mint sauce put it over the top and I think if you leave it off, like others have recommended, it becomes just an everyday family dessert, not one for company. I put the batter in only four cups. The cakes were a little to big, no one could finish, and I had mint sauce left over, so the recipe is correct in making it for six. It MUST be served with lots of vanilla ice cream to help cut the richness. Extreme decadence!

This is a wonderful recipe! My husband and I were in need of a chocolate fix, but didn't have anything ready-made in the house and didn't want a long wait.

This is just the dish you expect it to be, and very easy to make. I served it with ice cream instead of the sauce. For those who want to make just two little cakes rather than six, here are the measurements I used with success -- 1 3/4 oz chocolate, 3 1/3 Tablespoons butter, 1 egg, 1 egg yoke, 1/2 Cup powdered sugar, 2 Tablespoons + 2 Teaspoons flour. I also buttered and dusted the ramekins with chocolate powder-- the cakes turned out onto plates effortlessly.

I made this recipe for Valentine's day and my boyfriend and I LOVED it! I made them in 4 oz ramekins (about 1/2 the recommended size) because that's what I had on hand, and we both ended up eating two! I had to play with the baking time a bit: 11 minutes left them so runny that they didn't make it out of the mold in one piece; 14 minutes baked them so thoroughly that there was only about a nickle-sized gooey area in the middle. I skipped the chocolate mint sauce because of time, and we didn't miss it - after all, the whole point of this recipe is that the center of the cakes are like hot fudge! We both agreed that they could have been more chocolate-y, so next time I will try 1/2 semisweet and 1/2 unsweetened chocolate. Yummy!

Made this again for friends and family. The recipe is a breeze and the results are delicious. Moist cake, gooey filling and just the right balance of butter, sugar, chocolate. I used Valrhona 70% first, Ghirardelli bittersweet second. Both produced a great dessert, but I prefer the complexity of the Valrhona if you can find it.

Really enjoyed this one! I agree, butter the dishes well... I used a little cocoa powder instead of flour after I buttered them. That worked excellent. I agree about the mint sauce, you don't need it, but if you make it, any leftover is very good on ice cream or fruit. I am making this again this year for Valentine's Day. Hope to find some heart shaped molds to use!

Oh yeah, this one is a keeper. I can't really add anything different than any other reviewers, except that I have never heard so many happy cries of "ohmigod!" from the people I made it for. All they were doing was eating the desert. I swear.

Made this for a dinner party and all I can say is "wow". I served the cakes with vanilla frozen custard and rasberries. No mint. One guest said it was the best dessert she's ever had! Now, I'm not much of a cook, and apparently I have a hard time reading a recipe....but the dessert still turned out great! As I reread the recipe, I realize I didn't follow the instructions!!! I used about 1/2 ordinary Baker's unsweetened chocolate and 1/2 high quality dark chocolate. To me, it was perfect, and I'll probably repeat my "mistake" again!

I made this first time for guests and it was a huge hit! The timing directions were right on the mark. I was too lazy to make the sauce, but it really wasn't needed with french vanilla ice cream on the side.

I have made this more times than I can count now. It is an incredibly easy and decadant dessert. I love the mint sauce...and any leftovers are great atop ice cream. Easy to make the whole dish before company comes over and then pop it in the oven after dinner. YUM!!

Like other reviewers, this dessert was big hit with company. I also made batter a day ahead and skipped the mint sauce, & with ice cream and fresh raspberries. It was easy, quick and decadently rich. I found that the recipe made 4 cakes using 7 oz. ramekins. Eleven minutes was all it took. A keeper.

Wish you had 5 forks for those few exceptional recipes that deseve it. For lack of effort, easy of preparation and "WOW" value in front of company, this recipe should be your choice. You can dress it up for presentation a hundred different ways. Sprinkle the cake just before serving with powdered sugar. My guests were scaping the plates!!!

I can't add much more to the other reviews. I also ommitted the mint sauce and served with Raspberry Sauce. This is definitely a keeper! We had 2 cakes leftover and my husband and I discovered that they were even better the next day! Didn't think it was possible! We had them with Dreamery vanilla ice cream and it was just unbelievable!

Not much to add to raves below, except that they're all TRUE! Very easy, elegant and delicious. This will be the only chocolate cake I make in the future. Took reviewer's advice and baked cakes in non-stick popover pan. Came out perfect and easily. Also, our dinner plans changed so premade cakes sat in fridge for almost 48 hours before baking -- no problem. Be sure to let your chocolate mixture cool a lot before adding to egg mixture. Mine wasn't quite cool enough and the eggs cooked slightly as a result.

Made this last night for my boyfriend's birthday. He doesn't like mint, so I did not make the sauce. Made the cake batter the night before and then just took it out of the fridge to warm up a bit. Sprayed and floured the ramekins and the cakes popped right out. Served with Grand Marnier whipped cream and drizzled the cakes with a little Grand Marnier as well. Garnished with an orange twist. Very easy and very yummy!

Unfortunately I had a kitchen disaster when making this recipe. But from what I managed to salvage - it was delicious - not pretty but yummy! I will be trying it again this weekend. I've tried this again and again and again! (minus the sauce) I have had people lick the plates clean - literally!

The cakes were incredible. I made a few in a large muffin pan and a few in the small soufle dishes. I definately suggest using the large muffin pan. The shape and molten part of the cake came out much better and because the pan was non stick, they popped out with no problem. I made a raspberry sauce instead of the mint by pressing frozen raspberries through a strainer and adding a bit or sugar and fresh lemon juice to the sause. I also served with vanilla ice cream and a dusting of powdered sugar. My guests were super impressed and delighted.

This is the second time I have made this recipe. It was a great finish to a great meal. I skipped the sauce and served it with blackberris and rasberries and a litttle bit of vanilla Haagen Daaz. I would cut down on the powdered sugar a bit next time though. I also added a disc of bittersweet chocolate in the center of each before throwing it into the oven and it turned out great. A very impressive dessert that is simple to prepare and can be made ahead. After dinner you jus tput them in the oven for 12 minutes and dessert is served.

My cakes fell apart. After reading the reviews, I think I made the following mistakes. Put the custard cups on a cookie sheet. Buttered the cups, but didn't flour. Could have cooked a little longer than the 11 minutes. And, plated immediately after leaving the oven. The taste, however, was fantastic. I didn't care for the sauce. I thought the sauce, along with the cake was a bit over the top. (Too much sauce.) I will try this again.

Rating: 3
WOW! This taste's and looks great for company. I served the cakes with vanilla ice cream and a fresh raspberry sauce with sprinkled confect. sugar on top. It was amazing. I made the batter the day before and put it in the buttered dishes in the fridge. The next night I took them out an hour before baking, then baked for 14 minutes-perfect!!!!

How do you look like a gourmet chef if you're not - you make this recipe! I've served it at two different dinner parties, and both were a huge success. I omitted the mint sauce and served the cakes with ice cream, fresh raspberries, and garnished with icing sugar and fresh mint. WOW! This will definitely appear again, and most likely by request from those who have had it already.

Excellent! These cakes are a real treat. I skipped the sauce as I wanted to do something quick and simple. Once I made the cakes, I just added a spoonful of fresh cream to the side and topped it off with chocolate shavings. My guests were very impressed!

I served these cakes for St. Patrick's Day--what a huge hit! My conscience couldn't abide all that butter, though, so I only used 4TB instead of 10.

I loved this dessert!! It has so many things going for it-it is quick,easy,can be made in advance AND it is delicious. If you butter the ramekins very well the cakes just slip out. I made them a day ahead, brought them to room temp before baking and they were perfectly done in 12 minutes. I also didn't bother with the sauce. The first time I served them with vanilla ice cream-yum. The second time I simply spooned a thin layer of creme anglais over the suface of the plate, placed the cake on top and sprinkled on a few raspberries-even better. The presentation was like that of a resturant and the flavours were wonderful together. Less sweet and rich as well, which is more appealing to me. A real winner of a recipe!

Outstanding desert. Won rave reviews. Like others, I chose to pair with a simple raspberry sauce, berries, and vanilla ice cream. The results - superb. If you're a chocolate lover, this will blow your socks off.

Well, mine didn't invert at ALL. So, I whipped together a raspberry sauce (thank Heavens for always having chambord and corn syrup on hand), added home-whipped cream, and served them in the custard dishes. That seemed to save the day as everyone was too busy eating to comment. Luckily, my husband didn't ask why they weren't inverted until AFTER our guests left!

This is an awesome dish that is relatively easy to prepare. I added coffee extract to the sauce instead of the mint extract. It was good, but I completely agree with others that the sauce is not needed. It almost gets in the way. Homemade vanilla ice cream also helped make this dish.

WHAT A HIT! Made this for visiting Olympic guests. I did not make the sauce, as I do not care for mint. I swirled butterscotch onto plates, put souffle next to a scoop of coffee ice cream and dolloped (SP?) with Marscarpone Cream and chocolate shavings. It's a keeper!

Rating: 3
The mint sauce is way over the top, not needed (would be great on ice cream though). I believed all the reviews that said that, but since I love chocolate so much, I figured I'd go all out. I made a molten cake in the past where you place a hunk of good quality chocolate in the center of each cake and then bake. Having had that as reference, I found this recipe to be a little too runny for me, too much sauce to cake ratio. But if you like that...this is for you! It is delicious and my husband loved it. I could see why ice cream would be a good addtion, the extra sauce has a reason then. *For the cook who had problems making it the day before (it was too thick to pour), when you first make the batter, pour in each cup right away, then put in the fridge idividually wrapped with plastic wrap. I used Pyrex ramekins, which went from fridge to oven, no problem.

So good! Very rich, so be sure to use small dishes. Take the opportunity to drizzle the chocolate sauce in a decorative pattern to make it look really impressive. Watch the cooking time..it continues to cook after it comes out of the oven.

The first time I made it which was about a year ago, I made it exactly like the recipe said, except the sauce, I didn't make the sauce. The cake turned out to be too heavy and greasy. This time, I made it with only 1 Tbsp of butter, and WOW, it was unbelievable!! This molten cake was perfect without all the butter. I had to bake it for 15 minutes to get the perfect consistency. Buttered and floured (with cocoa powder) the ramekins, and no problem at all turning out the cake after 3-5 minutes of resting. Will definitely make it again and again.

Made this twice, once for company, and tried it again for Valentine's Day. It is sinfully rich and the sauce only added to the sins. Served with vanilla ice cream. Used the pinch of salt recommended by others. The first time we refrigerated the mixture, and it was quite difficult to easily handle into ramekins as it was quite thick. Took 20 min. to cook, and still had a molten center. After we had a little problem removing our first one, we let them sit for 3 minutes and the others came out easily. Our guests were fascinated with the process. Used 1/2 cup ramekins instead of 3/4 cup the second time, and we overcooked slightly, but they still were great. I really like them because they are hot when served. Will probably try them with raspberry sauce next.

Rating: 4
WOW!! I made this for my V-day dinner & it was AMAZING! I followed the recommendation of skipping the sauce - good call! The vanilla ice cream was a great contrast as the cakes are very rich. I made them the day before to let them set and used a lot of butter on the ramakins and they slid right out! One note: I was worried about over baking them since I wanted a really soft center so I baked them for 121/2 minutes and they really could have used another minute or 2. It would be almost impossible to overbake these - they just ozze chocolate. It's a wow!!

This delectable dessert was served to my Culinary Society on Sunday and it was a great hit. I helped to unmold them and they all were perfection. My friend had baked them in very deep muffin tins. You could tell they were still molten in the middle as there was a dark circle in center of each one as they left the oven. We covered them with a baking sheet and inverted so they were resting topside down on that sheet and chipped off any little edges that were dark. I used a spatula to transfer them to plates where ribbons of raspberry sauce awaited them. We added lots of whipped cream and went to heaven :)

This is the first time I have ever made a cake from scratch and the oven in our apartment is completely unreliable so I was pretty nervous. Even so, my husband is already asking for them again. We both enjoyed the mint sauce and have already thought of a number of ways to use the leftover portion. I didn't have ramekins so I used disposable tin pans from the grocery store. Worked fine, but we had to eat them directly out of the pan because they wouldn't slide out. Still yummy and I'll be buying some ramekins soon for the next time I make this recipe.

Fantastic show stopper though I haven't had any luck making it ahead of time and heating it up. The timing seems to be off a little. But don't let me dissuade you, this is one of my favorite recipies!

Rating: 4
This is my favorite dessert for company because its delicious, easy, impressive, and can be fixed ahead of time. Be sure your oven's heat is accurate to avoid overcooking the cakes. It helps to let the ramekins sit for 2-3 minutes before removing the cakes; otherwise they tend to stick. I use the microwave to melt the chocolate -- this works well.

Rating: 4
I made a triple batch of this for a dinner party this weekend and stored in the fridge till baking time. One batch makes exactly 6 cakes if you use a 1/2 cup ramekin or muffin tin. You can fill to almost the tip top since the cakes hold their shape as they rise. Warning: the cooking time has to be carefully monitored since an extra minute is the difference between molten or solid insides. Err on the side of less cooking than more. You can always pop them back in for another minute. Another warning: if you cook the ramekins on a baking sheet, it will require about 1-2 minutes more than if the bottoms are directly exposed to the heat. Also I thought the cakes were much more attractive served right-side up vs. inverted. It wasn't hard to scoop the cakes out of the ramekins with 2 spoons.

This was my birthday cake, made by my husband. (He also made herb-crusted tenderloin and a wild mushroom tart, both reviewed on epi.) Absolutely delicious! We gave room for error, ie made extra, which was good, because when we took the first out, it fell apart--sides stable, too much that was undercooked though. It needed about 13-14 minutes (no refrigeration) this time, which may be b/c of humidity. It will vary every time, I am sure. The mint sauce is to die for! I will be using it for many other dishes. Simple but sinful!

This is an amazingly simple, yet impressive dessert. I'm one of those cooks that buys dessert for my dinner parties. Not anymore! I made these cakes 3 times over the holidays and had great success each time.

Heaven!

A great dessert after a big Christmas meal. I love that they're individual desserts and small (just enough). I had the cooking temp at 350 instead of 450 (my own mistake) the cakes just took longer to cook (actually worked out well, since they would have been done too soon). I made the chocolate sauce and I don't think it was needed, the center was very 'molten' and added plenty of sauce. I made it with semi-sweet choc. Served with vanilla ice cream and and whipped cream.

This dessert was very good and definitely impressed my guests. However the middle was still a little runny (like raw cake batter) and not the consistency that I was looking for. Therefore the next time I make it, I would cook it at a lower temp (around 430) and for about 16 minutes especially since I kept it chilled in the fridge. All in all, a very delightful dessert!

A home run! Everyone loves these cakes... even people who don't like chocolate that much. They're not terribly sweet, which is precisely why they're so good. I use Valrhona 56%. Here are a few tips: The recipe says it'll yield six cakes, but I get five. Perhaps I'm putting too much batter in each ramekin, but the finished size looks appropriate and is not overly big. If you're concerned about the cakes sticking to the ramekins, it isn't a problem as long as you use plenty of butter (don't use Pam -- it's ridiculous and artificial). Just put a glob of butter on your fingers and work it into all areas -- especially all the way to the top of the ramekin because the cakes do rise a little bit. Definitely make the batter the night before and refrigerate it already poured in the buttered ramekins (covered). Refrigerating helps because the center will then take longer to bake, resulting in that gooey, molten center. After baking, invert the cakes onto individual plates (this will help to keep them in one piece as they pop out). Then, skip the mint sauce and spoon some fresh raspberry coolie around each cake. The first time you make this it's OK to lean toward the longer cooking time. Even if you overcook them, they still taste good. If you take them out of the oven too soon the edges won't be set enough to hold their shape.

I made this recipe for a friend's birthday - it was a big hit. I like the fact I could make it ahead and just bake at the last minute. I doubled the recipe and it worked fine.

When I make it again I will probably leave out the peppermint since I'm not a peppermint fan and I don't like anything coming between me and my chocolate!

I made this and another recipe for molten cake, I like the other recipe better, but this is still excellent. I butter the ramekins and then spray lightly with butter flavored Pam.

My first attempt were a disaster .. tasted great though!! When I turned them out they were just sludge! Put the rest back in and cooked them some more, they did hold shape for a minute then collapsed! I did some more the next day which I cooked for much longer (20mins) and they came out perfectly! I was using a friend's oven so wasn't used to it, but I would think next time when I'm home I'll have to work out the right time for the oven and ramikin size! The chocolate mint sauce is just delicious!! I cooked these for mother's day ... and luckily my mother believes in taste over presentation!

I made a double batch for mother's day. The first several cakes didn't come out very easily - I think my ramekins were a little small so tha cakes were too tall and for that reason they split in the middle and the top of the cake stuck. But the last four came out perfertly. Maybe they just needed to sit a minute before being plated. Very good never the less. Everyone was impressed. (I didn't do the mint sauce - the oozing center was sauce enough)

This is a simple yet elegant finish to a meal. I buttered ramekins & put parchment paper on the bottoms for fear of sticking. I served them at the end of a entree of beef fillet with a red curry sabayon and port-balsmic reduction. I didn't make the sauce, but served them with vanilla ice cream. That was a little sugar overkill for me, next time I will try it with an espresso sauce. Everyone love them !]

Absolutely stupendous! I used a giant muffin tin, and sprayed the cups with Pam instead of buttering them. Refrigerated it for several hours, then took it directly from fridge to preheated oven and baked for exactly 13 minutes. Slid knife around each cake, and they all inverted beautifully. When I cut into one and saw that beautiful liquid chocolate oozing out, I was thrilled! Delicious. This recipe is awesome!

I agree with all of you that this is fabulous recipe. I've made this without the sauce, simply dusting the cakes with confectioner's sugar & serving with rasberries.

I made this using the only chocolate I had on hand, some premium semi-sweet chips. It was fabulous. I made the sauce ahead, put it in one squeeze bottle, and did the same with the cake batter. The next day, I squeezed the batter into prepared ramekins, and baked it. While the cakes were baking, the plastic bottle with the sauce was warming in a pan of simmering water. The dessert was extremely rich and chocolatey. I dusted it with a cocoa/confectioners sugar topping, and served it with the vanilla ice cream. With these two minor adaptations, it was wonderful.

This is a must-try recipe - it is extremely easy, allows for advance preparation, and tastes absolutely delicious! I made the cakes and the mint fudge sauce for a dinner party over the weekend, and my guests were wonderfully impressed. Once everyone raved over the first few bites, the room fell silent as dessert disappeared rapidly. To the Cook from NYC, I followed the suggestion posted by the Cook from Price, UT (butter the ramekins and then coat them with flour mixed with a bit of cocoa)and my cakes slid out easily. I look forward to using this cake recipe over and over again - maybe with a raspberry sauce next time.

This dessert is foolproof and delicious. I have made it 3 times with good results each time. I had no trouble removing the cakes from the ramekins. All I did was run a narrow knife between the cake and the dish. I was able to release each cake by inverting it onto its serving plate.

Easy to make, yes. But how the heck did you manage to unmold the cakes? When I tried, the "molten filling" poured out of the cakes and made a mess. I had to throw everything back into the ramekins and bake until the center were solid before they would unmold properly. -Yes, I did butter the ramekins before I poured the batter in. Suggestions, please!

This is very good. I made it with 1/2 unsweetened and 1/2 semi-sweet chocolate, very good without being overly sweet. Definitely flour (along with the butter) the ramekins, if you don't like the idea of having white floury "specks" on the cake, sift a bit of cocoa with the flour before dusting into the ramekins, it will disappear into the cake and they will fall right out. To the cook who said the cakes were too done, have your oven preheating during dinner, then bake the cakes after you finish eating. This will give you enough time to clear the table and start the coffee, and the cakes won't get overbaked.

Guests raved over this. I am not a baker, but this was easy. Use Pam in custard cups to help turn out. I baked ahead of time which set the chocolate too much. Next time will bake while we are eating dinner. Quick and Easy. Used almond extract and raspberries. Rave reviews.

I didn't make the sauce, it sounded like overkill, however the cake recipe is very easy and foolproof and was delicious with home made whipped cream and fresh raspberries. I also made it in a buttered muffin tin -- a bit smaller than the size called for but quite sufficient.

This is a great make-ahead recipe. I halved the recipe to allow a sampler plate with other choices. These cakes were a favorite.

Delicious, out of this world and EASY to prepare!!!!! I am not much of a baker but was able to hold up my head proud when I presented this to my family tonight. In-laws thought it was better than those served in four star restaurants. Everyone licked their plates clean. I did not make the mint fudge sauce. I served it with raspberries, soft-creamy whipped cream and vanilla ice cream and polished it off with powdered sugar. I loved the fact that I was able to do the initial prep work in the morning, chill it, and stick it in the oven after dinner. Oh, I also used Vahrona chocolate ... for those of you with Trader Joe's close by, they carry this world-famous french chocolate now (Williams Sonoma does too)!!!

Our family held a baking contest on Sunday and my 13 y/o son went to epicurious.com to find a recipe for what he called "lava cake" Kenny, single handily, prepared this dessert. It was the blue ribbon winner!!! He would suggest only one minor change- less peppermint extract - or a little sauce goes a long way,,,,enjoy!

Rating: 4
This IS a delicious dessert. I have served it 3 times(once at another person's kitchen...I had to bring some special tools/ingredients!!!). The mint sauce makes the difference from other molten recipes. Tip: you can leave the cakes in their prepared containers for awhile...in fact I think it makes a better quality cake...firmer and when you put a fork to them...the 'molten' sauce ooozes out!!!

These little cakes were so easy and the fact that you could make them ahead of time and then bake them is great. I liked the mint fudge sauce, although the melting scoop of vanilla ice cream made a delicious sauce in itself. Very impressive and extremely easy.

I had 1/2 cup ramekins on hand, so made 8 cakes instead of 6, which worked out perfectly. With ice cream and the sauce, it turned out to be plently after a complete meal that included appetizers. I buttered and floured the ramekins which made them fairly easy to get out. Next time I will try raspberry and/or vanilla sauces.

An easy and impressive dessert. I made the batter and sauce a day ahead for a dinner that we were invited to. The dinner got cancelled at the last minute, but we thought we'd enjoy them anyway. Incredibly delicious!! I made them with semi-sweet and found them wonderful (not too sweet as one other review mentioned) The mint sauce was wonderful and would be great just on good vanilla ice cream! As for removing the cakes from the ramekins- I had no problem at all. I used Pam to "butter" them with and they just came out, after I ran a small knife around the edge. Actually, a few took a minute to "fall" out. We ate some the next day, - cakes at room temp, sauce heated- again they were good! Next time I may make the cakes with orange extract though, and sauce w/out the mint, just for a change.

Wonderful. Unusual but not too strange. Everyone agreed it was great. I had to copy the recipe for everyone. I buttered and floured the custard cups, and no problem with sticking. It was very easy. I didn't make the sauce. Instead, made raspberry sauce and served with vanilla bean or coffee ice cream.

This was fantastic, very impressive and SO easy. I used semi-sweet chocolate and did not think it was too sweet. Using advice from other reviewers, I buttered and then floured the ramekins. I let them sit for 1-2 minutes after I removed them from the oven and then ran a knife around the edges. I had no problem at all removing the cakes from the ramekins. I did refrigerate the filled ramekins for several hours before baking and then baked for exactly 13 minutes. I didn't make the sauce based on the mixed reviews and instead served it with a good vanilla ice cream. It was a fabulous combo. Yum!!! Will definately make again SOON.

I have made this three times - once to test, once for a dinner party, and once to bring when invited for dinner. It has been delicious each time. We skipped the fudge sauce and served it with raspberrry sauce and vanilla ice cream. I also garnished it with starfruit one time and kiwi the next. You get a great result from little effort. The cake texture has been just as good when baked the day after assembly. I used slightly smaller ramikins to give a taller, but smaller cake.

made this for a new year's dinner and people are still talking about it. it seems to be more popular with men for some reason. while i was removing the last few cakes from their ramekins, several men were actually in the kitchen on their knees in front of me, after having taken their first bite. definitely a crowd pleaser. I did substitute raspberry sauce for mint sauce and gave the option of either vanilla or coffee ice cream. It is really so easy and your guests will think you are some sort of culinary genius (little do they know!)

Rating: 4
Very easy to prepare. I mixed the batter the night before and let it set at room temperature about 10 minutes before baking. I baked the exact time indicated and had no difficulty removing from ramekins. You must *love* chocolate for this dessert. I used bittersweet and it was perfect. The mint sauce is just a little strong. Served with vanilla bean ice cream and garnished with fresh mint. Nice presentation. Had two left over from dinner party and nuked for 30 seconds following day-should have only cooked maybe 15 seconds--they turned out cake consistency rather than oozy. This one's a keeper.

I made the cake and sauce the first and time and now just make the cake. I have given the recipe to a lot of people and have made it 4 times -- even buying new cups just for this. It's so easy and a crowd pleaser.

Marvelous is the only word to describe this recipe.However, I did substitute a few things. In the sauce I substituted 6 1/2 ounces milk chocolate chips rather than the two listed and for the cakes I substituted 5 ounces of milk chocolate chips. I also substituted Kahlua in the place of the peppermint extract. I found that the cakes came out of dishes better if i buttered and then floured the dishes.

Excellent. Simply Excellent! I have made it 3 times now since New Years, and it is wonderfull! If anyone is worried about the raw batter, you can simply cook it about 3 minutes longer, and use the mint fudge for the "ooze" effect. I use about 1/2 the Peppermint extract to get more chocolate flavor over the mint. Vanilla Ice cream a must.

To the cook from Chicago complaining about "raw batter": if this recipe were truly a health hazard, would identical molten chocolate cakes have been on hundreds of restaurant menus for the past decade? Also, Bon Appetit does not publish recipes with raw eggs, so I doubt they'd publish one of questionable safety. Really, no one I know or have heard of has ever suffered from eating this kind of cake. No one's forcing you to make it, but the rest of us know it's fine.

Rating: 4
To the other Chicago reviewer about my take on "raw batter"...I think baking them at 450 degrees for 14 minutes means that they ARE cooked...at least to get rid of anything dangerous. Oh well, I guess we all interpret things differently. I still think this recipe is AWESOME.

I used semi-sweet chocolate to make the cakes and would recommend bittersweet. To counteract the too-sweet result I got, I made the mint fudge sauce without the mint and got a delicious dark chocolate taste.

To Chicago, you can think of the soft and runny raw batter as melted chocolate if that makes you feel better. But...no matter how you look at it, this "cake" contains 6 large undercooked egg yolks and 3 undercooked egg whites mixed with only 1/2 cup flour. So what if some melted chocolate is thrown in? Like I said before, if you enjoy eating raw batter, make this cake. This is still laughable. Good grief!!

Bruce, has it ever occurred to you that the reason many of these recipes are in the Constant Comment section has to do with the fact that they coincide with the release of the Epicurious "new batch" recipes, and therefore people will be paying special attention and more apt to try a recipe when they get the new batch e-mails? For myself, I'm grateful for this particular section of the website, as I've found many recipes that I've tried and enjoyed, thanks to the feedback from others before me. Stop whining!

Rating: 0
Maybe this CONSTANT COMMENT section is getting incestous,i.e. a self-fullfilling prophecy in that the 30 recipes listed here have a much higher profile and therefore will get more "hits" than any other recipe. Just a thought. "These recipes have received the most comments and ratings from our users in the past 30 days." I will try and simplify; If these recipes are highlighted out of ten thousand, then it makes sense that they will always be the most talked about regardless of taste or quality. If Epicurious arbitrarily stuck 30 new recipes under Constant Comment I assure you that in the next 30 day period these new recipes would have the "most comments and ratings". Does that make sense?

Rating: 0
Bruce: are you planning on posting the exact same message with every Constant Comment recipe? If you are going to repeat yourself, at least make sure you're comments make sense.

I tried this recipe because of the rave reviews, KNOWING that the molten center was uncooked cake batter. While never being one to not lick the mixing bowl clean, it somehow doesn't seem exactly right to actually serve to guests uncooked cake batter. The idea of a surprise filling, like a lemon curd or ganache, is appealing however. P.S. While checking the spelling of ganache in a Martha Stewart cookbook, I discovered a recipe for these same little cakes from the queen herself. So, you might want to just ignor this critique! I am, nontheless, happy I tried these cakes before the dinner party. I served something else.

My cakes didn't come out either (in spite of lots of butter), so we ate them from the cups. Everyone loved them regardless. I wondered if it would help to sprinkle cocoa on the bottoms after buttering.

Wonderful! I doubled the recipe and refrigerated the batter inside the custard cups and they turned out perfectly. Use LOTS of butter to grease custard cups. Re the sauce, I didn't like the bitterness caused by adding some unsweetened chocolate and would use all bittersweet next time. I used Scharffenberger chocolate!! Can easily be served without the sauce but vanilla ice cream is a must.

I definitely undercooked them...mine caved in and oozed all over the place but were still good. I am excited to try again though because they were delicious. I will skip the sauce though and try it with raspberries as someone suggested. And ice cream is a must!

This is a very forgiving recipe. I made for valentines day and my family just loved it. They like the sauce, I thought it was too much. When I was cleaning up I found the butter, all 10 tablespoons on the other counter, and wondered what the butter was for and then remembered, the cake. My family was impressed, if it tasted that good without the butter, they wondered how would taste with the butter. My daughter had this cake in a restaurant with a green mint sauce and said that was better than the chocolate sauce. I liked it with vanilla ice cream. This is a keeper!!

Amazingly easy and simple. I used buttered ramekins and they slipped out perfectly. The trick seems to be calculating the exact time in the oven. I used 10 mins @ 450 degrees...(unchilled batter). could have done 1 minute less.

Rating: 3
I, too, had difficulty unmolding these, and think I made two mistakes - I likely undercooked them a tad (and didn't leave them in the cups for several minutes after baking, as someone suggested), and I placed the custard cups on a cookie sheet when baking. The cakes fell apart and oozed all over the plates when I unmolded them. They did taste great, though, so I intend to try again and see if I can do better next time. Worth trying, for sure!

Rating: 4
I too made this for Valentine's Day and it turned out great. The results were wonderful for such an easy recipe. The key to unmolding is definitely to wait a few minutes after they come out of the oven. I skipped the mint-chocolate sauce after reading the reviews and instead served it with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream. My boyfriend was so impressed and couldn't stop saying how good it was! Definitely a successful Valentine's Day dessert... :)

I think I made this when the recipe appeared in the magazine. It didn't come with a mint sauce, but with a cherry sauce, and the batter also had chopped cherry pieces in it. That was very good, and I regret that I have thrown the magazine out because I certainly don't want to make this with mint sauce. So apparently the "Bon Appetit" recipes appearing on this website are NOT exactly like the ones that were in the magazine.

Boy, was this rich! Excellent dessert for Valentine's Day. We loved it, but I don't think I could have this more than once a year. I too added a pinch of salt and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to the cake batter, everything else exactly as the recipe stated. My cakes turned out great no problem with them sticking. Sat in the ramekins for about 2-3 mins. after taking them out of the oven and I also buttered and floured them first. I thought the mint sauce was really good with it. I made the sauce beforehand and chilled it and it tasted much better after letting it cool and then reheating (which I did in the microwave and it was fine). I also made the cake batter and chilled it in the ramekins before and put them in the oven for about 15 mins. This is definitely a recipe for chocolate lovers. When my husband smelled them when I took them out of the oven he guessed what they were having no idea! I was surprising him. He said "It smells really chocolatey and decadent, like that oozing chocolate cake I had at Morton's once" and he was right on the money!

My friends loved this, even with just ice cream. I made it the day before and they came out great. Be careful not to undercook too much. I did the first time and the cakes caved in as I unmolded them and the molten chocolate spilled all over the plates. The second time, 13 minutes from the frig was perfect. I plan to make it again very soon.

What a superb dessert and perfect to make ahead! Agree with all of the reviewers comments, especially about the need to adjust amount of extra sauce. Just made it for Valentine's dinner and was a hit. To the cake batter, also added a pinch of salt and 1/4 tsp. of vanilla. I cooked a bit more to lessen the "molten lava flow" of chocolate, and tried 3 different sauces instead of the mint since I forgot to get mint extract: One I added a caramel sauce (from the Chocolate Souffles with Caramel Sauce recipe found here), just a small bit to complement the chocolate sauce, together with some pecan pralines I had on hand, and it worked great together. On another, I dusted with powdered sugar and whipped up some fresh cream to accompany. And the third I mixed some fresh raspberries with sugar, and spooned the berries and juice over the cake and around the plate. This recipe is so versatile you could try any number of things.

Rating: 4
Perfect and easy for Valentine's Day. Making six results in very large cakes that for today's stomachs may be too rich. I made a double recipe that yielded 18 perfectly adequate in size, and I made them in muffin tins. Remember to use little parchment paper cut-outs on the bottom of the tins to help unmolding. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
Delicious!!!! The cakes are very easy to prepare, but it is a fine line to get them cooked just the right amount. You have to keep a close eye on the oven. Even when I overcooked them (so they turned out solid instead of runny) they were still very good w/ ice cream. I used almond extract instead of mint, but as many other cooks mentioned this very rich sauce really isn't necessary.

LOVED THIS RECIPIE! I've made it twice, and it was a hit both times. But I think I will try eight ramekins next time - there's quite a lot of dessert with the sauce and ice cream as is. If you want a big portion, 6 is great. Easy recipie, excellent taste. Substituted orange extract the second time I made it because we had dessert wine with it. That also worked well. If you are hesitant about trying it because you think that raw cake batter sounds icky, I found that the sauce inside is more like chocolate sauce than cake batter.

To the cook from New York, you might try buttering and flouring the cups. The flour doesn't show. For the person buying her own ramekins, they can be had at Pier One for a bargain $1.50. The original molten chocolate cake was created by Jean-Georges Vongerichten and appeared in July 1999 Food & Wine. I think the proportions are a little better: 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter,6 ounces bittersweet Valrhona chocolate,2 eggs,2 egg yolks,1/4 cup sugar,pinch of salt, 2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour. I agree about it not needing a sauce. In the best presentation I've seen, a restaurant in Cincinnati puts a stencil of the solar system over an oversized white plate and sifts cocoa to create the design on the plate then judiciously places the cake on top and dusts it with a little powdered sugar, reinforcing the idea that it is a heavenly desert. We made a game of it at XMAS and let the kids create the stencils. My husband calls it a TBO--taste bud orgasm.

I had been looking for a recipe like this as my husband adores this type of dessert. I'm thrilled to have discovered this recipe. It's simple to make and absolutely delicious.

Haven't made this recipe yet (I plan to for Valentine's Day) but, for the cook worried about salmonella, I believe that the cooking time these cakes undergo is enough to kill any such bacteria. Just as when you coddle an egg before adding the egg yolk to a Caesar Salad dressing, the lightly-cooked egg remains runny and yet safe to eat. As one who can seldom resist even completely uncooked cake batter, I look forward to Feb. 14!

What an easy recipe for a such a fancy dessert (under 1/2 hr working time)! I always wondered how they got the molten chocolate inside since I first had this dessert two years ago. My friends were so impressed by this dessert when I made it this January. Personally, I think the sauce is a little heavy. I'd suggest something a little fruity. The second time I served this dessert, I omitted the sauce and it went perfectly with vanilla icecream. You should definitely give it a try!

I have to admit -- haven't found a recipe in a long time that is this easy and elicits such rave reviews!! I made this the same day my issue of Bon Appetit arrived -- couldn't resist when I saw the pictures. Decided to pass on the chocolate/mint sauce. Made the sauce once and substituted Grand Marnier. Also served with only ice cream. Would try warm Creme Anglaise next. Everyone raved about this dessert!

I had this for dessert at a friend's house over the weekend. Whoa! I immediately sought out the recipe, since this is virtually the exact dessert that my husband and I had when we were in France two years ago. "La Petit d'Enfer," (not sure of the spelling) or "The Little Inferno." (This was at a restaurant in Paris called Cafe d'Enfer.) In France, it was served with creme anglais, which was a nice contrast to the warm chocolate that oozed out of the middle of the cake. Anyway, we've remembered that dessert fondly ever since, and I'm delighted to have a recipe to create my own. Fantastic!

Made this for New Years Eve dinner for 6. A big hit. I agree that the sauce was a bit overboard considering the "sauce" that came out of the cakes. Still, used sparingly, it makes a nice complement. I used Frangelico for a hazelnut flavor rather than the mint. I think the mint would be nice with it, though. Mine popped right out of the ramekins. Also, since all oven temps are different, my boyfriend and I decided that once the cakes "puff" in the middle they are perfect.

A new favourite! I think the extra sauce is a little overkill though as the sauce that comes gushing out of the cake was more than enough. I refrigerated the desserts before cooking them for 13 minutes and the result was perfect

This is an unbelievably easy and DELICIOUS (though not free of fat and calories) dessert. We didn't even have vanilla ice cream on hand (it didn't matter).

YUM! My friend originally was going to share one of these with someone else, but after taking a couple of bites, she decided she wanted one all to herself! I didn't think the sauce was too minty, either -- just perfect for my taste. I thought using up all of the sauce would be chocolate overkill (the recipe makes quite a bit as directed), so I had a lot leftover. However, it tasted great heated up in the microwave and drizzled over some vanilla ice cream the next day!

Easy to prepare and delicious! Good chocolate is key to the success of this recipe. I used Scharffen Berger. I was careful when adding the mint, only adding a little at a time, but found mine barely had a mint taste at all after adding the full amount(which was fine with me). Everyone was impressed with the oozing chocolate!

This recipe convinced me I have to go out and buy my own custard cups instead of borrowing my mother-in-law's. It was very easy to put together and my guests were impressed. I loved the fact that you can make the batter ahead and refrigerate it. My mint fudge sauce was a little too "minty" for my taste but maybe that was just the type of extract I used.
