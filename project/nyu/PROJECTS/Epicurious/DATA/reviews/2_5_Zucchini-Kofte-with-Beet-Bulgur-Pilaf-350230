Disappointing. The bulgur was ok but a little flat. Everyone at the table ended up adding salt to theirs. The zucchini "kofte" was the most disappointing, however; I was so excited to eat it because the mixture smelled delicious as I was making it. Once in the pan, though, they COMPLETELY fell apart. Thank goodness I had flat bread so everyone was able to make a sort of sandwich with it and the yogurt.

***i didn't make the kofte - so this review is just for the bulgur pilaf*** this makes a ton of pilaf. i halved the recipe and still had a bunch left over. no worries, it keeps well and is great reheated. the color is beautiful and the flavor is outstanding. i served with lamb kofte with garlic yogurt sauce (also from gourmet).

I think the problem of the mixture not binding together is because of the canned chickpeas. I've made falafel before and the recipe calls for dried chickpeas that you need to soak overnight. The falafel stays together no problem with the dried chickpeas--I would imagine the same would apply to this recipe as well.

This recipe does not work very well--the kofte don't fry well and don't bind well, even after adding an egg. In addition, there is a lack of spices/flavor for both the kofte and the bulghur. This is way more work than it is worth.

These are delicious - if you don't fry them. I had the same problem with them falling apart, so we took our left over balls, mixed them with the yogurt sauce, and smushed them over crackers. It was so delicious, fresh, and healthy! I'll bet the zucchini mixture would also be tasty over grilled chicken.

I added an egg to the mixture and that helped a lot. I also only used a coating of oil to cook these in and they were fairly easy to handle. I would say if you don't care too much about what they look like they are delicious, and the beet "risotto" was very good, although I threw in a couple of boullion cubes while it was simmering. The yogurt accompaniment is essential. I would make this again.

Wow. This was...really not good. After I mixed up the kofte, it was obviously not going to stick together enough to make balls with so I came here and looked at the prior reviews. I added and egg, some oil, made balls and then froze them to try and get them to retain their shape. They sort of did but I still had trouble with them falling apart. Will definitely not make again - wish I'd read the reviews before undertaking this recipe!

I wish I had read the reviews before making this for Easter dinner! Like the others, the kofte completely fell apart in the oil. We had to throw it out and pull falafel out of the freezer to substitute. The pilaf was fine -- not much flavor, but nice texture. The only thing that worked well was the yogurt sauce.

This recipe needs to be updated with a cooking method that works. The bulgar was fine -- a bit tasteless, but good texture. The best part of the dish was the yogurt sauce.

This is a delicious dish - the bulgar is fantastic. I pan-fried the kofte with a little virgin olive oil (much less than the recipe calls for), turning them often until they were brown (about 10 minutes). They held together and accomplished a great texture - the middle was warm and moist and the outside was crisp.

I loved this recipe especially if you eat it all together in each bite. The bulgar needed a bit more salt and pepper. Now the Kofte fell apart all together but the scraps were damn good. I'm going to try and pan fry them or bake them next time.

The directions for the Kofte recipe should say to use a light coating of oil. The First batch I used the amount of oil stated and they all fell apart. After that disaster and clean up I lightly coated the pan and the patties held together just fine. I only made half of the bulgur recipe and it made more than enough for my family. I also used vegetable broth instead of water for more taste.

Exactly! Complete disaster when I cooked these: fell apart entirely. Disappointing particularly because it smelled great... and involved a very messy cleanup. The pilaf was tasty.

Like the reader in Petaluma, I made this as directed but the kofte completely fell apart when I attempted to turn them in the oil. It was such a disaster that it made me wonder if an ingredient was missing...perhaps an egg to bind it? The bulger pilaf however was delicious.

This sounded great. I made it as directed, but the kofte completely fell apart in the hot oil. Any suggestions?

What is the difference between the kofta and a falafel? The recipes look identical or almost identical.

The kofte are delicious. My mother has been making an indian version of this for many years, just using a different squash and chick pea flour instead. This verison was excellent and the yogurt is good accompaniment. The burghul is a bit bland (but contrasts nicely) however I would increase the spices to make it more flavorful.

I only made the bulgur-next time I would use broth so spice it up and double the beets as well as half the bulgur-it made a TON! But was tasty-a delicious simple side dish.

The kofte and yogurt sauce were tasty! The bulgar was a little bland (but perhaps this was the point--to contrast the bold flavors of the kofte and yogurt sauce) and perhaps could have been prepared with vegetable stock instead of water to add flavor.
