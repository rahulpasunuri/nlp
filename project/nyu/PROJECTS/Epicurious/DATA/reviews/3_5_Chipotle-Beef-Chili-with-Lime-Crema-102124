I'm making this chili for the Super Bowl Chili Cookoff today. I don't have any stout. Can I substitute an amber ale?

This chili is great! I will be making it again. Has just the right amount of heat and the lime crema adds a special touch.

So, I don't cook. Every so often I will take over the kitchen, make a huge mess and congratulate myself for a fantastic effort to make the family dinner (yes, I am a man). Anyway, we were invited to a chili cook off party. I made this chili and I won! I made a cup man changes (that actually worked out!). First, predictably, I used an entire can of chipolte chilis in adobo sauce and I used an entire large can of chocolate stout beer.

I made a doubled recipe of this chili for a group of friends (men and women) in January and it was a HUGE hit. I used 5 tablespoons of the chipotles, added a can of tomato paste, 1 tsp of Cumin, 1 tsp of ground coriander, doubled the amount of black beans, added kidney beans and used a full pint of Guinness. I let it all simmer for about 2 hours the night before, then refrigerated overnight and reheated, letting it simmer all throughout the party. This made for a very rich, chunky chili with enhanced flavors. I was able to skim some fat off the top this way too. The lime crema was the smash hit of the dish and adds so much flavor while helping to cool of your mouth - the chili was pretty spicy! Definitely make the crema the night before so that the lime can infuse through the sour cream.

very yummy - my husband and i loved this chili recipe! made 1/2 recipe, just as written except (in a pinch), i substituted a can of rotel instead of using tomatoes and chiles separately.

This is my go-to chili recipe. It's different than your standard chili and has a fantastic kick if you want some heat along with great flavor. Love serving this with beer bread or cornbread. Yum!

Delicious chili, especially with the Lime Crema! I used an extra can of beans and probably more Chipotle peppers than I needed too - it was really spicy! I also used tomato sauce because I was out of canned tomatoes. Served with corn bread.

Great Recipe!!! I was surprised at how well the flavors kept when I froze some for later use... reheated and made some fresh crema each time, but talk about a time saver that was well worth it every time!!

This was fabulous! I only had 2lbs/1kg of ground beef but made the recipe as proportioned for 3lbs/1.5kg. The only thing I did differently was to add 1 tablespoon of excellent quality cocoa powder, 1 tablespoon of imported tomato paste, a tsp of cumin and one of ground corriander as I was using a decent but somewhat mediocre chili powder that needed a little help. This is my new favourite quick chili to make!

Here is my adaptation using 1 pound ground beef: 1 1/2 cups chopped onions, 3 finely chopped garlic cloves, 1 tablespoon chili chipotle powder, 14.5 ounce can Muir Glen Fire-Roasted tomatoes, 12 ounce bottle Guinness Stout. Simmer SLOWLY 30 minutes to 1 hour 10 minutes. 1 tablespoon yellow cornmeal, 15 ounce can Eden Organic black beans, 1 tablespoon salt, freshly ground pepper

I loved this chili, in fact everyone I've served it to has loved it. First time I made it I followed the recipe. Since then I've use Penzys med-hot chili powder and added some barbeque sauce to zip it up even more. Also used red kidney beans in place of half the black ones. It's all good.

Rating: 4
We loved this! I used low sodium chicken broth because I didn't have beef. I also used about 25% more chipolte chilis and it was very spicy but excellent. The lime crema gave the first bite many exciting flavors. My husband wants to eat this two days in a row so we won't have any leftovers for the freezer. Guess I'll have to make more.

Some of the best chili I have ever had! I like more vegetables in my food, so I used two cans of fire-roasted tomatoes, diced red bell pepper, and extra beans. We are Californian, so we like a little more heat. We used three tbs. Chipotle chilies, but next time will probably go up to 4 or 5. Don't skip the lime crema! It's a perfect compliment, and so flavorful.

Made with combination of ground beef and stew beef (dusted with flour and browned). Made the lime cream with yogurt and it was surprisingly delicious. Used less chili powder and added mexican dried peppers. Really meaty and delicious.

The ratio of beans to meat is all wrong in my opinion. Far too much meat for the amount of beans! Okay if you really are a ground beef lover, otherwise, shift the proportions around.

Great! Just great!! I like spice, so I doubled the chilies and the garlic. Also, I used a porter which lent a subtle chocolate flavor to the dish. I thought the lime crema was a nice addition (also tried topping the chili with sharp cheddar and a squeeze of lime, instead. Also tasty!). It keeps well and impressed everyone...I will definitely make this again!!!

Mmm... crazy good. I made this for a small dinner party on a cold winter night with skillet cornbread (also from this site) and it was a huge hit. Third and forths were had! I forgot to serve the crema, but enjoyed it later this week with lots of leftovers. I have to say the advenure of shopping for stout was fun... so many to choose from, I settled for a local Canadian brewery. I'm making it again to use up the rest of chillies. (well, maybe also because it was so yummy.) Enjoy!

This was very good. I made it just as the recipe instructed, with the exception of cutting back on the chili powder. Really delicious and even better the next day. The lime crema was amazing and really made the dish. Too spicey for my kids but my husband and I loved it.

I used a can of borlotti beans, a can of red kidney beans, and a can of cannellini beans since black beans are virtually unavailable in NZ, where I am currently living. I also used a full can of tomatoes rather than just one cup, a full cup of dark beer, and 34 oz (1 liter) of beef broth since it came in a 1 liter container and I had no immediate use for the extra broth. I also used more chipotles than the recipe called for, probably about 4 T instead of 2 T. All the extra liquid meant that I had to keep my chili more than simmering in order to get it to thicken before it was dinner time, but with frequent stirring I had no problems. The addition of the cornmeal really thickened it up nicely in the end and the whole thing turned out very well. My husband and I, both transplants from Southern California, did not find it too spicy, even with the full 1/2 cup of chili powder and the additional amount of chipotle peppers, but I can see how it would be too much for some people. The sour cream topping was delicious! Served alongside a mexican-style cornbread, this dish was a real hit with my husband.

Rating: 3
After reading everyone else's input, I too decided to use less chili powder. I used 1/3 cup, instead of 1/2. And, wow, it was toooo spicy to eat! I then had to dilute it with some more crushed tomatoes and an additional can of black beans. Then, I added sauteed red/yellow bell peppers to give it some color. After making these adjustments, it taste really good. But, in no way would I start off with 1/2 cup of chili powder! And, I used the store brand (whole foods) of chili powder.

Having lived in Texas for many years I was leary of any chili that did not use traditional Texas ingredients, however this was delicious! Used 3 chipotle peppers, the 1/2 c. of chili powder, and it was blistering the first day, and no heat the second, just excellent flavor! We used New Castle for the beer, and I was surprised how much of the flavor came through. The lime crema is a must, I agree with other reviewers, it made the dish.

Rating: 3
This is a winner -- delicious & easy with special flavor through the chipotle in the chili and the lime crema on top. The 1/2 c. chili powder seemed extreme, so I used 1/4 c. and that gave plenty of bite. I also threw in the balance of the can of chipotle chilis & the balance was perfect. Homemade corn bread is easy, so I did that instead of corn chips. All in all a great chili.

Easy and outstanding. Have been making it as written for years. Made it with lentils instead of beef once when we didn't happen to have meat around, and it was surprisingly good. My VERY carnivorous husband just asked for the lentil version--what a surprise!

I tried a mix of black, kidney, and pinto beans for a little more variety and added some corn. This is a great recipe to begin with and lends itself well to experimenting.

Served this at a party for 15 and nearly everyone asked for the recipe. A great recipe on it's own or to tweak to make it your own. I added extra porter to deglaze after sauteing the beef and also extra in the recipe. Made for a richer, deeper flavor. Make the crema at least several hours prior to serving to really let the lime zest meld and flavor the crema. Great recipe and I will surely make it again and again.

Rating: 4
This recipe is fantastic. I made this chili and another for my big poker night and the boys were scraping the pan. I had several tell me that it was the best chili that they'd ever had. I'm not big on changing recipes the first time I make them, but I did go half hamburger and half pot roast because I LOVE shredded beef. That meant simmering it longer 2-3 hours to let the fat in the roast break down properly. I also went a bit heavier on the chipotles because you always want to give the boys a challenge (went through lots of napkins from brow wiping), but be careful.

This chili is really delicious - very hearty. Only recommendation I have is to add more spice - we like a spicier chili and the jalapenos and chili powder weren't enough. Was just as excellent reheated!

Great for the Superbowl party! I used 2.5 lbs of sirloin tip roast, cut in small chunks, extra black beans, added 1 can diced tomatoes and cooked in a crock pot for 5 hours. The guests loved it and the crema made it outstanding.

I also use this as my base chili recipe. The only changes I make are to (1) substitute skirt steak cut into bite-size pieces instead of ground beef and (2) cook the day before and refrigerate overnight, so I can scrape the excess fat off and let the flavors blend. I have served this 3 times and agree the Lime Crema is a must.

This is outstanding chili, and I'm not a huge chili person. My husband went nuts for it. I doubled the amount of chipotle chilis to bring up the heat. I, too, agree that the lime crema is a must, as are tortilla chips to add some crunch. Easy and delicious!

Very Good. I used 2 cans of readi-cut tomatoes and juice and 3 cans of black beans. More corn meal will adjust to thickness you want. The lime crema is a must. Don't skip it. Would be good over scrambled eggs with hot corn tortilas on the side.

Have made this three times and think it's muy delicioso, but still needs some tinkering. I now half the chili powder and double the chipotle, which pushes the edge of my heat threshold, but my husband thinks its perfect. We also just tried using 1/2 ground pork chorizo & 1/2 ground beef for more southwest flavor, but next time I'd like to try dry cured Spanish chorizo instead for a more chunky texture and perhaps sub cubed chuck for some of the ground beef as well. This recipe (as is) is somewhat lacking in the texture dept., so adding another 1/2 can of beans would not be out of the question either.

This is excellent. I will definitely make again, but next time will try a courser grind of beef or maybe small cubes of chuck. I served it with cornbread and the lime crema. Delish.

Not too bad...had good flavor. I agree that less chili powder would be better. I am not used to a solely ground beef chili, but it was good, especially with the lime crema. I served it with my own chili recipe at a party, and everyone who tried it loved it. The lime crema is a fantastic addition.

This was probably the best chili I've ever had. We entered it in my husband's chili cook off at his office and we won first place. The lime crema is absolutely scrumptious! However I do recommend cutting down on the chili powder to about 1/3 cup as it definetly reduced the heat to a more flavorful standard.

The first time I made CHIPOTLE BEEF CHILI WITH LIME CREMA, I prepared it as written and thought the flavors that make this chili interesting were overpowered by the chili powder. The second time I used 1/4 cup chili powder, 4 tablespoons chipotles, 1 can beef broth and a 12 ounce bottle of stout. The heat was the same and guests who had tried both, preferred the revised version (although both were received enthusiastically). I used "Old Country Style" whole-milk yogurt available at Armenian grocery stores instead of sour cream. It comes close to the decadent density of sour cream without all the calories.

My husband and I love this recipe. We have it as a "winter staple". I have found it is best if it is slow cooked in a crock pot for the whole day on low. I also only use one can of beef broth and add a whole bottle/can of beer. Friends and family love it!

I reduced the chili powder. Next time I'll use the entire bottle of stout and eliminate the broth. The lime crema is essential. A hearty and delicious meal!

The chili is good and my husband really enjoyed it. My only caveat: if you are not a beer drinker you may not enjoy the beer flavor. I think next time I will use 1/8 cup of beer, or omit it completely, besides that I thought the recipe was great.

Easy preparation for a good meal on a cold day. The actual chili lacks flavor and lime creama is an essential.

Rating: 2
My husband and I liked this, though I think it will disappoint those who prefer cumin-flavored chilis since it lacks that smoky spice. I used regular Mexican chili powder, and thought it could stand an extra chipotle pepper. Further, I recommend using specialty chili-ground beef if you can find it - the meat strands are thicker and more substantial, which helps the texture of this hearty stew. The lime crema is essential - without it, the chili is actually quite bland, save for the heat of the chipotle. With the crema, though - it's really quite good. Two forks only because I will make adjustments next time I make it.

Rating: 4
Always looking for good chili recipes and this is a winner. I think I would like to try it with beef shreds or small chunks next time. Agree that the lime crema is necessary though one should not use so much of it that the chipotle is completely neutered - as if that could really happen. Agree with the cook from S.D. Yeowww!

A great chili recipe! Chipotle add just the right amount of heat and the lime crema is the perfect foil to the chiles. I will use the Crema in other recipes. Everyone in the family loved it. Very easy as well.

Because I'm feeling poor this month and there's no end to grad school in sight, I made this with TVP (textured vegetable protein), which you can buy dehydrated for cents/lb at health food stores--not too much flavor, but the texture of ground beef, and v. healthy! Also, I always use smoked chipotle chili powder, which is v. hot, so I cut it to 1/4 c--even with a whole can of tomatoes, the rest of the bottle of beer, and some extra stock and TVP, it turned out *fiery* and delicious.

The snow really started flying today so I started the Chili this morning. Not snowed in, just chilly & windy. Didn't have all the ingredients - no chili powder. Now who do you suppose broke into my house & stole the chili powder while I was away for a year???? No Canned chipoltes but Penzey's ground chipoltes -- looks like a good substitute - sprinkle some in, taste it - hmm, no kick, sprinkle, sprinkle, sprinkle. Came home after working in my studio for a few hours. House smells WONDERFUL!! Can't wait to try it -- YEOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW -- moral of the story, a little ground chipolte goes a long way, good thing the beans still need to go in & can always add s'more tomatoes. Still plenty warm but wonderful none the less -- can't wait till tomorrow to have a bowl -- definitely with the Lime Crema!! :) Makes the chilly SD Winter a whole lot nicer! Thanks Epicurious!

This will become my new standby chili recipe. I added an entire can of fire-roasted crushed tomatoes (Muir Glen brand), which gave a hint of smokiness that complemented the chipotles. The lime crema was wonderful (I put in lots of cilantro), but I don't think it's essential to the dish. My husband just topped his chili with cheddar cheese and it was equally delicious.

Easy, fast, yummy. Teenagers loved it. And I improvised. No beer so used chardonay. Decreased beef broth, added more tomato sauce. Toasted cumin seeds and put in about a tablespoon of ground cumin. Added cinnamon. Sauteed more onion than called for, two carrots, a green pepper, 2 ribs of celery. I even forgot and put the black beans right in and simmered the whole thing for an hour. The lime flavored sour cream was perfect. We put Monterey Jack, chopped onion and jalapeno on top also. Superb.

Well I must say the chili was a big hit with the familia. My husband just loved it! And the lime crema not only complimented the chipotle chili perfectly, but also aided in neutralizing the spiciness. This dish tastes like you spent all day cooking (maybe because of the bold flavors), when in fact, it took less than an hour to prepare and serve. We will definetly be making this one again. Great even the next day. Oh, and with the tortilla chips; delish!

Delicious! I have made this chili numerous times and it has become our family favorite. The smoky flavor of the chipotles and the hint of stout make it top notch. I usually serve it with rice or noodles to tone down the heat for the kids. Also, I like my chili with a little more tomato flavor so I add a can of diced tomato and less beef broth.

I've made this chili, and several variations of it after experimenting, many times. It's the best chili I've had. This chili does improve from the addition of 1/2 a cinnamon stick and 1 tsp cumin, though. Just add the cinnamon when you add the liquids and fish it out after about 30-40 minutes of cooking. Other variations - ground turkey instead of beef; addition of vegetables such as finely diced carrots, bell peppers and zucchini with the onions; pinto beans in place of some or all of the black beans. I've also found that if you want to cut the time down on cooking and you're using a lean meat, it's not necessary to sauté the meat and vegetables seperately. If your chili turns out a bit thin and/or you don't have cornmeal, tomato paste helps thicken it.

My eight year old son said to rate this with 10 forks! I, like some of the other cooks, added more chipotles than the recipe called for. Also, I've been craving cilantro, so I threw some in a blender with the other ingredients for "lime crema" and not only was the flavor sublime, but it made the sauce a really beautiful fresh green, which is a color that I long for this time of year. Will make it again and again.

I made this yesterday as I have for the Superbowl for 3 years. It is excellent. My recipe has evolved to using 2# ground chuck 1# cubed chuck for texture. I will explore adding shredded brisket as well for the ULTIMATE masterpiece. A quality chili powder is key. Sometimes I use only the adobo sauce from the chilis to control the heat.

We don't typically eat a lot of meat, but my husband was RAVING about this. Best chili he's ever had, he says. For people not accustomed to eating much meat, I'd say: cut the beef to 1.5 lb rather than 3 lbs, and add 3 cans of beans rather than 2. Delicious. I also added an extra tbsp of chipotle and cut down the chili powder to a mere couple tablespoons (1/2 cup chili powder sounded like a helluva lot of chili powder).

Rating: 4
This chili is REALLY good. I subsituted 1/2 inch chunks of tri-tip for the ground beef which turned out great, though expect to simmer for quite a bit longer than the version with ground beef. Nice and spicy, but I added a little salt too, to bring out the flavors. I served the chili along side bowls of grated sharp cheddar, sliced scallions, fried tortilla strips, cilantro leaves, and diced fresh jalapenos so party guests could build their own chili. Everyone loved it - they all went back for second and third helpings!

I cut down the recipe as I live alone and substituted ground turkey for the beef. Unfortunately I didnt realize I was out of black beans until too late so I used kidney beans with no problems. I also added Mexican oregano and cumin for a greater depth of flavor and topped with chopped cilantro which adds to the crema and chipotle flavors

This was the BEST chili I have ever made. The chipotles with their hot smoky flavor really made this chili great! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect, however in my house, we like it HOT! I'll add an extra teaspoon of the chipotles next time. I followed one reviewer's advise and pureed the chipotles with adobo sauce in the blender. Alot easier to measure out. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!!

With the onset of cooler temps, I promised my husband I'd make him chili...but I can't stand kidney beans and chili powder. I searched and found this one, and we both love it. I halved the recipe and made these alterations. I couldn't bring myself to use 1/4 cup of chili powder so I dusted perhaps 1-2 Tbl. I used 14 oz of diced tomatoes and 1/3 can chipotles (4 Tbl) but I wouldn't dream of altering the lime crema. Marvelous.

I cannot say we really liked this. It lacked depth of flavor - it seemed only to have heat. The lime crema was good & the dish got much better with the addition of it. I have seriously had better made with a chili mix packet. So, I think we'll stick to our chili recipe and adopt the lime crema.

This will be our chili recipe from now on, too. I totally agree with cook from Sutton, MA....the final touch should be freshly chopped cilantro on top of the Lime Crema...SO good! We loved this. I used 1 pound of ground beef and 1 pound of ground turkey and you couldn't tell.

A very good, quick chili. To sum up my observations and others: (1) play around with the meat/bean combo. I used 1/2 beef, 1/2 pork, others use kidney, pink, whatever beans--do what you like. (2) Fresh cilantro on top--who doesn't like that? (3) Try a Mexican Creme Fresca (sp?) if you can find it--it's the texture of sour cream blended with yogurt but it has the tangy bite of sour cream, if not more. Very good addition. (4) Instead of adjusting the chili powder amounts, adjust the amount of chipotle in adobo. I usually process a can and then use it by the tablespoon GRADUALLY to add just the right amount of heat and smoky flavor. It can be added late, instead of chili powder which needs to cook to develop flavor. Or, scoop out a cup of chili, make it ridiculously hot and let your guests add tablespoons to their liking.

I used Gebhardt's chili powder. Whoa, was this baby spicy! Half of the family did not even finish their bowls, so I would definitely cut down a little on the chili powder and/or the chipotles.I really liked it the way it was, but they did not. The crema was OK, but go easy as it can detract from the chili's meaty flavor.

This was a good chili recipe. I used dried chipolte chilies (rehydrated) because I couldn't find canned. I also used only 1/3 cup of chili powder because I was nervous (based on previous reviews) that the chili would be too hot. I should have used the full amount called for. The chili was very meaty. I would have preferred more vegetable texture. Next time I will not chop my onions as finely and I will add canned tomato chunks. The lime sour cream was a fine addition (although plain sour cream would have worked just as well). I served with homemade corn bread. It made a fine family meal for a chilly evening.

I'm not a huge fan of chili, but this one is pretty darn good. I cut back the meat to 2 lbs, and added an extra can of beans - the only way to go if you don't want a chili that is 90% meat. I goofed & used double the amount of beer & added the beans at the same time as the meat- didn't make a whit of difference - the recipe is very forgiving, which is one of my favorite qualities in a recipe.

I made this chili for dinner last night, and loved it. I used to buy a favorite chili mix - can't remember the name of it, but after it was discontinued, I really missed it. This is the taste I've been missing. It's exactly like the mix I can't find anymore. Now, that's exciting. I followed the directions exactly, and it was a bit too spicy for a few. So, I might cut down a bit on the chipotles next time for the sheepish. Definitely a keeper!

Yes it's true. You must use (for this recipe at least) regular supermarket chili powder, not the pure stuff made only from chilies. Be aware; like the previous reviewer stated, if you add pure chipotle or ancho, it will be much too spicy. Bon Appetit should better clarify things next time.

Rather an ordinary chili, apart from the chipotles and the black beans. I couldn't purchase the chipotles so I used the regular green and red chilies which were also very good. To compensate for the absence of smoky taste I started with frying some bacon and added the crispy bits as an accompaniment. The black beans were somewhat spicier than the usual red beans. A nice change.

I made a mistake and took the advice of another reviewer and used Ancho chile powder and Chipotle chile powder in equal amounts in addition to the canned chipotle chiles in Adobo and the chili wound up being FIRE ENGINE HOT!!!! I could barely eat it! I was so disappointed, but I didn't realize the chipotle powder was going to be so hot. I immediately called my sister in NM and asked her how do I fix it and she said add sugar and some water and serve with plenty of fritos or tortilla chips. It was still very hot but tasty. Next time I'll know better! Otherwise, I followed the recipe as stated. BTW, the crema was terrific, don't leave it out!

This was a really great chili and relatively easy to make. I would, however, use a little less hot stuff. Even with the crema it was a bit spicy.

I'm one of those people that follows a recipe as if it were an exact science. If it's good, great. If it isn't, chances are I'm moving on rather than playing with it a whole lot. This chili, when prepared exactly as the recipe states, is outstanding!!! My husband (who makes a pretty mean chili himself) said that he'll never make his chili again - this was so far superior! It's very spicy, though... Some of your guests may need to really pile on that lime crema.

Made this for a Saint Patty's party (to use some of the stout. It was too hot for many of our neighbor's (mid-west buds!), but for the heat lover's it was great. The lime crema is a nice touch and a great flavor combo with the smokey chipotle's. It won't replace my standard chili recipe (not tomatoey enough)but a good new addition. Also a great slow-cooker recipe - brown the beef and then the onions as indicated, then add the rest to the crock pot and let it simmer!

Absolutely wonderful! I subbed stew meat for the ground, as I prefer the texture in chili, and eyeballed most of the measurements (onions, chipotles), but I'm fairly accurate with that. This is wonderfully flavorful, with a lingering heat. The lime crema is very good, but my husband and daughter preferred it with crumbled queso fresco. Definitely will be repeated. (Might be good with pork chunks also)

Easy and excellent. For the previous reviewers - you have to use REAL chili powder, not something like a Schilling brand which is mostly salt, garlic etc and very little chili powder. Go to a Mexican market (or order online)or check this Hispanic food section of your grocery. We used a combination of Ancho, New Mexico and California chili powders - used half black beans and half kidney beans. Used 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 ground beef (extra lean)and threw in a Tbsp of cumin. And it's the Chipotle chilies that are not, not the chili powders! Found this to a rich and delicious chili recipe.

My husband liked this recipe, but we both agreed that the result reminded us of a store-bought Taco Bell taco kit, with beans. Maybe I did something wrong? Overpowering chili powder taste, IMHO. I even added more tomato and stout, but they didn't help much. The lime crema was wonderful and added a lot to the dish.

This is the best chili recipe I have ever made. I cut back on the chili powder since my family doesn't like dishes that are too hot. The Lime Crema is a great addition -- it's also good as a dip for chips.

This was fantastic chili! I made it as a special surpise for my husband. It even went over great with my brother-in-law, the world's pickiest eater (I swear!). I did follow other reviewers' suggestions of adding a little more cornmeal and beer (all I had was Berghoff's, and it still came out good). I only used one can of beef broth and 1 lb of ground sirloin and added a big can of kidney beans (what is chili without kidney beans?). It turned out perfect. Not bad for my first-ever batch of chili! The lime crema was a great addition, too.

I hope I don't offend any of you voracious meat eaters out there :), but has anyone tried making a veggie version of this, perhaps with more black beans and some vegetarian crumbles? Thanks!!

This is the best chili I have ever had. I did add some tomato paste, and only used 1 can of beef broth, and used a mixture of andouille sausage, chopped sirloin and chopped pork loin instead of ground beef. This manages to be comfort food, as well as really delicious flavorful cuisine!

Made a double batch of this for a super bowl party. Everyone loved it. The lime sour cream is fabulous. I made it the day before and refrigerated it so fat could be easily removed.

This was a big hit at a recent party -- and the second time I have made it -- so many people have asked for the recipe -- I also used more stout than beef broth and if you like it a little milder just reduce the chili powder --

This is a great, flavorful recipe. I would just suggest draining the fat out of the pan after browning the ground beef, otherwise the chili ends up very oily, with pools of fat on top.

I have made this recipe several times & I LOVE it. It's easy and delicious; the lima crema is a refreshing, tasty addition. This is perfect for anyone looking for a hearty chili recipe & a guaranteed hit!

I made this for a chili cookoff at work and won first place. I used the whole bottle of porter and used jalapenos and cayenne peppers instead of chipotle. Very good recipe.

I really liked this dish. The smokey flavor offset by the lime crema was wonderful. I did use finely chopped sirloin instead of ground beef the second time I made it, even better!

Just use a full can or bottle of stout and cut down the amount of broth respectively. This has a very deep and rich flavor, and the lime crema adds a special zing to it.

Delicious. I'm from chili country and this is a great variation. Had no "stout" so I used non-alcoholic beer which worked fine. Also added some concentrated beef juice from roast. Great depth of flavor. Try it with low fat (not nonfat) sour cream. I cut the amount of chili powder by half...personal preference. Still plenty spicy.

I made a completely VEGAN version of this recipe by substituting the ground beef with one package of Boca ground beef substitute, one can of red kidney beans, and half a bag of frozen corn (it was already opened and just taking up space so i figured "what the hell"). Obviously sub'd beef broth with veggie. I used a sour cream substitute which at first seemed really stiff and un-sour cream like, but the texture loosened up with the addition of the lime juice. The wannabe gourmet grocery story that I went to didn't have canned chipotles, so I used some ancho chili paste. Overall, it's pretty good, it has an interesting flavor. It's a good jumping off point for a chili recipe, start with this and make your own additions and stuff. **Needs lots of cayenne for some kick**

I liked this recipe, but have a few suggestions. I added a couple of cans of tomatoes and would add some corn next time for color, also used more beer. I would use much less meat next time (1 1/2 -2 pounds). All around, a very good chili that I'd make again. Very smoky flavor and it freezes really well.

This is a superb recipe that I'm definitely going to make again. I doubled the amount of chipotles to increase the heat, but, otherwise left everything else the same.

I make this recipe every 2 weeks during the winter. It is the BEST chili I have ever had. I especially like the lime crema. It adds just the right amount coolness to the spicy chili. Add more chipotle for extra flavor!

I just returned from a Chili cook-off where I tied for first with this recipe. It is mild with a tasty, spicy after taste. I recommend making it a day or two before with at least 2 re-heats before serving. I also added some chopped chilantro to the lime crema.

Terrific Recipe. Took first place in a charity Chili cook-off. I substituted a Sam Adams Honey Porter instead of stout (less bitter) and added 1 6 oz can tomato paste. I also used canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. Judges commented on the unusual combination of flavors which were highlighted by the lime crema.

I like my chili spicy and tomato-y so I made a couple of changes. Specifically, I added a 6-oz. can of tomato paste, substituted the crushed tomatoes w/ 1 can of drained, mashed Ro-Tel tomatoes, substituted 1 can of Campbell's beef consomme' & 1 can water for the broth, upped the stout to 1 12-oz. bottle of Guinness, and doubled the amount of chipotles (canned with adobo sauce). I'm serving this tonight for the Superbowl so I'll have to wait to get my guests' reactions, but for my taste this recipe is excellent!

I featured this chili at a New Year's Day Open House. My husband said I made way too much--but there was not a bite left! I was careful about the amount of liquid I used, based on an earlier review, but had no problems. It was an unqualified hit, and I made another batch for us to have in the freezer.

I made this for dinner at a millennium party, and it was a big hit. several people asked for the recipe. I added a bit more corn meal than was called for, and i used chipotles in adobo sauce. the lime crema, as someone else said, was definitely worth it. thumbs up!

This was a so-so recipe. There was a recipe from Gourmet about 3 years or so ago for a chipotle chili that was far more superior that this recipe. The Gourmet chipotle chili recipe was featured on Sara Moulton's Cooking Live show on FoodTV.

This recipe came out too watery. I used dried chipotles instead of canned. The lime sour cream does help add a refreshing taste.

I made this for a group of 7 and it was a hit. Everyone loved the "heat" factor that the chipotle chiles add, while being able to tone it down with the delicious lime sour cream. Instead of ground beef we used sirloin cut into small pieces, which remained very moist. Yum. By the way: the recipe from the magazine does fail to tell when to add the meat back in, so I'm glad that the online recipe has corrected the ommission.

Not bad...it's amazing how hot those chipotles will make a dish. Great served over rice, and big tortilla chips are a nice addition. Definitely make the lime creme, it's worth it. I made it with fat-free sour creme and it still came out great.

I would like to try this recipe, but it fails to say at which point to return the beef to the mixture.
