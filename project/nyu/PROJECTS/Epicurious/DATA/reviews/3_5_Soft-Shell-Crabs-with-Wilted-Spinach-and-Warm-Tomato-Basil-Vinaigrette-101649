A Marylander by birth, I thought this was a very solid recipe that one ought to take up a notch. So I added Old Bay to the crab batter and placed the ensemble a top a bed of Japanese sticky rice. The combination was very popular.

Family hated the dressing (too much vinegar, in my opinion). Will never make again.

Family hated the dressing - what a waste of ingredients. Looked beautiful, though.

Excellent! Received rave reviews for those that I cooked it for.

I substituted red snapper for the soft shell crabs and kale for the spinach, and cut down on the amount of vinegar. It turned out very well.

Excellent and easy recipe. While I usually prepare soft shell crabs the traditional way (and still think they are probably best the least done to them), this is a great alternative and very good for company. I too added more basil but, I think in retrospect, less may be more. Strong flavors seem to overwhelm the crab. If you like soft shell crabs you cannot but rave about these results. Others will be very impressed; this is a great dish to present and takes little effort.

This was really great. The vinaigrette was delicious -- it would be a great salad dressing! I only had one problem. My shells were a bit chewy. I couldn't decide whether I didn't cook them long enough on the shell side, or if it was the crab itself. Any thoughts on the matter? By the way, make it easy on yourself, ask your person behind the seafood counter to clean the crabs for you, that's one yucky task you can do without!

soft shell crabs are wonderful but need to be changed around you will get very board with the flavors if it is prepared the samw way every time. If you like this maybe try a tempura batter 1 cup flour, 1 cup cornsterch, 1tablespoon baking powder, add water and mix with fork until smooth heat oil in pan too 350degrees for two minutes on each side and serve with a good viraity of differant hot and cold sauces.

We made this recipe last fall for six - everyone raved. We'll be trying it again next weekend when my folks come to town. Prepare the vinaigrette and clean the crabs before hand, and there's little to do once guests arive.

I was concerned that this wouldn't work with winter tomatoes. It did...brilliantly! I served it as a first course (smaller portions), eliminated the yellow tomatoes (too expensive in April), and probably used more basil than the recipe called for. WOW! My guests were impressed and so was I.

I've made this recipe without the crabs -- simply a spinach salad with the tomato vinaigrette. It is wonderful. I've also added different types of grilled sausage for a main dish salad. The vinaigrette also keeps well for a day or two in the fridge (best if prepared until the point of cooking when starting a day ahead).
