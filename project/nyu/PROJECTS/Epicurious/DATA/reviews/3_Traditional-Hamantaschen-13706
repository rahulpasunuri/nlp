Had a similar experience to the Cook from New York (review dated 03/20/11). Next time I will use a recipe that calls for butter and less flour.

These were great! I used the Cup4Cup gluten free flour in place of the all-purpose flour but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I had no problems with the dough being too crumbly. My cookies were done within 15 minutes and were a bit too dark by 20 minutes.

Only use this recipe if you are an experienced baker who can improvise and imagine what changes to the dough will be needed when it does not turn out properly. I followed the recipe exactly as written and the dough came out a crumbly mess. I added about a tablespoon of water and it just became soggy (oatmeal textured) mess. The dough does taste good, so if you know what you're doing you could probably make this workable, but again, if you're just looking to follow a recipe and come out with a decent product that you can give to your friends, look for another recipe.

I make these every year. I substitute 1 stick softened, unsalted butter for the vegetable shortening. The dough is easily rolled out. I always have success with this recipe!

I love hamantaschen but the only time of year I make them is for Purim, so to make them extra special, my sisters and I have always made them with almond filling, in addition to the traditional flavours. You just fill the rounds with almond paste!

I read all the reviews before attempting this recipe, but elected to follow the recipe exactly as I normally do the first time I make any recipe from a magazine or website. The raw dough is delicious--good thing, too, because it is impossible to work. I rolled it normally--fell apart. Rerolled between sheets of plastic wrap--rolled beautiful, cut out circles--as soon as they are budged from the plastic wrap--using a bench knife--they tore and fell apart. I will tweak my normal recipe with orange zest/juice (which my grandmother used to do anyway), but I would suggest a different recipe. I'm an accomplished (and paid) baker, but this recipe doesn't work as written.

Purim 2011 is coming up! I love this recipe but the dough usually comes out a little too dry and crumbly if you follow it literally. I made two adjustments and have been making these cookies for years! 1) Instead of 2 cups of flour, 3 cups of flour. 2) Instead of 1 egg, 2 Large Eggs. (if dough feels too dry, 1 more egg white) I also will add a little more orange zest and/or orange juice to balance out the dough's flavor. I have never received a single complaint since! I also make a few with Nutella inside along with all the traditional fruit fillings. Its a great addition to the Hamantaschen flavors.

I thought this recipe was easy to make, and the result was very tasty! I did use about 3T of orange juice instead of just one, but apart from that I followed the recipe as written and found the dough to be perfectly workable. I filled them with apricot jam, and not one pulled apart during baking. Will definitely make again, next time with help from the kids!

I'm with all the people who say the dough was way too crumbly. I didn't even add all the flour and still it was too crumbly to roll and shape. I ended up adding water to keep the dough from falling apart and managed to get 8 cookies out of it. They came out flat like pancakes and the orange taste is not what I would refer to as "traditional." They taste good, but don't make these if you need a trouble free recipe.

i make these every year. the dough definitely needs more flour. i fill half of them with applesauce the rest with jam.

they were delicious but flattened out during baking and resembled a cookie rather than a hamantash. any suggestions?

Don't forget plenty of extra flour for handling the dough (I'm a novice baker). Used whole wheat flour--added about a cup of club soda and double the eggs to make the dough smooth. I'd make another trans-fat free recipe instead (the pareve veg shortening is full of all sorts of hydrogenated oils)--maybe plain vegetable oil.

For me, this recipe was perfect. Most people do want their hamantaschen to be pareve, though, that was a small issue. As most bakers know, you'll have to adjust the flour amount based on how much humidity is in the room. I needed to add some, others needed less. The orange rind and juice is the line between okay and excellent, if you ask me.

The dough needed more flour, I used 2 and a 1/2 cups, omitted the juice (just used the orange zest) and it was fine. For an experienced baker not to make this simple adaptation..... I made a prune and cinnamon filling, delish!

The dough is tricky but after making these over and over again it has gotten easier each time. Well worth the effort.

Dough was too dry but was easily saved by sprinkling on some cold milk and kneading a bit. Cold water would probably also do if keeping kosher. I omitted orange rind and used lemon juice instead...final product was delicious!! Will definitely make it again.

TERRIBLE CRUMBLY DOUGH--I AM A BAKER--HAD TO THROW IT OUT NOT EVEN ONE FORK

Rating: 4
I have made this recipie several times, always to rave reviews from others. In fact, every time I make these hamantaschen, I always make them for friends or coworkers because if I have too many in my house, I would eat them all myself! I also found (by accident) that subsituting half the ammount of sugar with Splenda makes no difference in the taste. I have not yet tried substituting Splenda for all the sugar, but if anyone does, I would like to hear about the results.

The orange zest gives the dough a great flavor, but they're not your grandmother's hamantaschen (which is something I like). Something else to consider when making this recipe -- the dough expands a lot, and some of the cookies tended to fall a little flat, losing some of their triangle shape.

The dough was incredibly crumbly, I couldn't even form a ball to roll out! I tried adding more shortening, but that wasn't helping so I ended up tossing everything in the garbage. What a waste.

The BEST hamantaschen EVER. The orange juice gives it a fresh zing. VERY YUMMY.

This recipe was a total disaster. I have made these cookies with other recipes every year and I decided to make this recipe for my son's school yesterday and UGH what a mistake! The dough was falling apart and the flavor was mediocre at best. Very disappointing. It was an unsalvageable mess.

A co-worker asked me to make these cookies and he absolutely loved them! The cookies were straight forward to make. I would add water little by little to make sure the dough consistency works and I'd use a smaller cookie cutter so the cookies are smaller. Otherwise, great!

I put these in the oven for 20 minutes like the recipe said and they came out black! The next batch I put in for 12 minutes, and they came out fine. The dough was way too crumbly, and very difficult to roll out.

I am an experienced baker and had a lot of trouble with this recipe. The dough was much too crumbly--a real disappointment. I also followed the recipe exactly.

This was a very difficult recipe for me. The dough was way too crumbly to roll out and I DID follow the recipe exactly. Also, the baking time was far too long. 12 minutes tops before they burned in my oven. Flavor wasn't that great too keep on trying to get this one to work.

This is my favorite hamantaschen recipe and I make it every Purim. I use butter instead of Crisco and it tastes great. I like it with the apple raisin filling.

i made these for a purim dinner. they were a cinch to make. of course one or two of the corners didn't hold, but that wasn't such a big deal. but i don't know why people think it's so difficult. i roll the dough on floured wax paper, with a floured roller, as i do for pie crusts. i got a poppy mix recipe from Joan Nathan's book. i had so much poppy mix, i kept making batches. they got rave reviews by two groups of people, and all got eaten!

When I took these cookies to my Hebrew class, everyone said that they were sooooooo much better than any other hamantaschen taken into the Jewish center, so I was very pleased with the results. This recipe is a definite "keeper" and I'll be making it on Purim every year. I had no problem with dough texture so I am surprised at the comments of some of the reviewers. To avoid problems, let me suggest the following: 1. Always use regular solid vegetable shortening UNLESS a recipe specifically says to use liquid. (I used solid Crisco shortening.) 2. Use a large egg or a jumbo egg for this recipe; not anything smaller. 3. You'll need about 3 oranges to get the amount of zest required for this recipe. 4. Sift or whisk the flour BEFORE you measure it into the sifter; then re-sift with the salt and baking powder. 5. Don't use more than a gently rounded teaspoon of jam per cookie. 6. Dampen your finger in water and run it around the edge of each dough round before trying to seal the edges. 7. Gently lift the edge of the cookie with a small spatula, and bend it to form the side wall of the cookie. Then move to another side of the triangle, sliding the spatula under the edge and bending the side as before. Press the corners to seal. If the dough cracks or breaks, simply press it together again. No big deal. 8. Check your cookies after 13 or 14 minutes! 20 minutes is way too long! 9. After the cookies cool, a light sprinkle of confectioner's sugar makes them look professional. *PS: If my instructions sound overly simplistic for adults, you can chalk it up to my 28 years of teaching food prep to middle school students. It's hard to break old habits! VONNIE

WOW! These cookies are amazing. Sooooooo much better than the ones from the bakery. The dough was tricky (crumbly) but the results are well worth the effort. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will try using a little less flour. These cookies have such a wonderful flavor and unlike the ones from the bakery you really don't even need the filling!

I made this recipe twice and won't be making it again. For some reason my dough came out very sticky and I had to add a lot of flour just to get it out of the mixing bowl. After much struggle I ended up with a big mess that stuck to the cookie sheet. I measured very carefully so that was not the problem - perhaps there is a specific kind of shortening that gives the best results? If so, it should be indicated in the recipe. Once I knew what to expect it wasn't as bad the second time around; however, if I am going to make Hamantaschen with my kids, I want a more foolproof recipe.

Very delicious but difficult to fold like a tricorn hat. I only managed to fold and pinch two ends. Orange malmalade filling goes especially well with this recipe.

These were rather difficult to put together. Next time I'll make the cream cheese hamantaschen. But the taste, with the date orange filling, received RAVES.

The best hamentaschen I've ever had! Wonderful, crispy dough! I used canola oil for the shortening and found that the dough was too crumbly, not enough liquid. Quick fix -- use 3 tablespoons of orange juice instead of 1. Also, 20 minutes was too long for baking -- it only needed 17.

I thought this was an excellent recipe. The crust was quite flavorful and did not have the bland, "institutional" flavor that some recipes have. (I attribute this to the orange zest.) In response to the previous comments about the flour/water balance, I found the dough wanted to be handled similarly to a pie crust -- just try to get it in a ball and don't handle it too much. Once the dough is chilled, it will roll out without crumbling. I did have to add a few drops of extra water, but I consider this par for the course for this type of dough. (The moisture content will vary according to elevation, humidity, and the position of the stars). I also found that 20 min was too much time; 13 minutes was all that was needed in my case.

I also found that the recipe called for far too much flour, the dough was very crumbly and almost impossible to roll out.

I dont know what the first reviewer did wrong she obviously didnt measure carefully. The problem was the dough was crumbly it had too much flour...There is not enough liquid called for. You need to add a little water (a couple of TBSPs) or a very extra large egg. They were the best tasting of any hamanatshin I've made...
