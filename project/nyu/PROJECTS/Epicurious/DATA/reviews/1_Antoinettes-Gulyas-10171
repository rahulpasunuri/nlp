I did a recipe search for gulyas after coming across it in a cookbook. I had never heard of it before. In the recipe I have it calls for lard, not butter.

Hungarian kitchen doesn't use butter in cooking meaty dishes. Never. Shortening (pork-fat) or Vegetable oil and mostly Smoked Bacon for extra bacon. Butter gives a strange taste to Gulyas that doesn't belong there.
