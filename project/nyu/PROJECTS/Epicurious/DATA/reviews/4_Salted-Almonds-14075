Excellent and easy. Set the timer on 10 minutes and check for doneness. It is so easy to burn roasting nuts.

A very simple but elegant tapa. I made these almonds as part of a tapa trio that included albondigas (meatballs) and Saffron mushrooms (both Williams Sonoma recipes). Main course was Birthday Party Paella. Very impressive!
