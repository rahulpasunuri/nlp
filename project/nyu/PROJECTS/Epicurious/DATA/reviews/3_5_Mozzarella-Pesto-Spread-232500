Delicious, but add more pesto and sun dried tomatoes for more flavor.

Absolutely perfect. Just use a chefs knife and cut it like duxelles. No freezing, no machines and so.

It was good but a little too chunky for my liking. I will try the pastry blender idea next time.

Simple and excellent. Everyone will rave. No one will know just how easy it was unless you reveal it.

After mixing the ingredients, I worked them with a pastry cutter to make it a little smoother for easier spreading.

Delicious and easy to make. Everyone LOVED it. Freeze the mozzarella for about 10-15 minutes so its easier to grate.

Made this as an app for a dinner party and it was a big hit. I chopped the tomatoes in a food processor for a finer texture.
