I love these ribs! I have made them many times and always get rave reviews. I make them with country style ribs and they are always moist and tender. Make sure that you brush them often while they are cooking

I MUST'VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG HERE, THERE ARE SO MANY DELICIOUS RIB MARINADES BUT THIS WAS DEFINITELY NOT ONE OF THEM. MAYBE SOMEDAY I'LL TRY IT AGAIN.

I added some crushed red peppers to give it a little zing. I agree with the cook from Ester the sauce was a little thin but the flavor was good. Next time I will add wine or maybe vinegar to help tenderize the ribs.

It was quite unusual flavor in the beginning, and my adolescent children were not sure, whether they liked or not. But,now it has become our marinade of the jour. It is easy, not so aticky, and delicious. I just reduced the amount of the orange peel, and add a bit more garlic.

This a great departure from the usual ribs. Followed the recipe exactly, and made some tomato-based BBQ ribs as well, just in case. We had to eat the usual ribs ourselves the next day, but the Worcester-orange glazed ribs were all gone! Finished this in the oven, and got a nice glaze and color. Tender!

Too sweet and the sauce never thickened. We might try it again tho because of all the rave reviews. Maybe it just needs a little tinkering.

The marinade was okay - we added a little lemon juice to increase the flavour. My husband wanted to add red wine (we didn't) but I think it would have helped make the meat more tender. We would make them again but I'll loose on the red wine battle.

I changed my three fork rating to four...because I am already craving those scruptous "orange garlic worcestershire" tangy little rib delights AGAIN...ONCE THE FLAVOURS OF THE MARINADE MARRIES OVERNIGHT THE UNION BURSTS WITH FLAVOUR.

I was so excited to make this because of the great reviews and that it was so easy but boy I thought it was just so so. I don't know if I did something wrong since I never got the glaze to get very thick. the flavor on the ribs was nothing special. Sorry!

This is a great recipe! I changed the flavoring of the orange rind--just slightly. I put in just one tablespoon of fresh orange rind and one tablespoon of fresh grated ginger. My parents loved the ribs. I cannot wait to make them when the summer rolls around--Memorial Day weekend. I will have to make the marinade for friends. Thanks for the great recipe. I love this website.

I did not want to heat up the house and put the ribs right on the grill. They were absolutely delicious.

I didn't think these were anything special--my husband and son both voted not to make them again. I followed the recipe exactly and while they were Ok--they just didn't stand out.

I tried this recipe with "country style" pork ribs using the same time and heat recommendation. Never have I had more tender and tasty glazed ribs. I also recommend adding fresh cracked pepper to the marinade if you enjoy the meat and sauce a little spicier.

Although we aren't big rib eaters, the people present at the BBQ raved about these! My father was skeptical they would turn out well since he swears by parboiling first but they were as tender as can be!! Only drawback was the mess to clean up after. Be really careful about who put the ribs in when they go in the oven as it's hard to clean the pan after. Watch them SO carefully on the BBQ, they burn easily. Even though some ribs had burnt sauce, they were still all eaten!

Excellent! I wanted to make ribs for a Memorial Day party for 20 but didn't want to do the whole recipe on the grill last minute - this was perfect. The flavor is so unique and a pleasant change from the standard BBQ sauce based marinades & glazes. I had the butcher halve the racks lengthwise so that I could make riblets and then served them as an appetizer.

Being transplanted from Austin, Texas to Olympia,Wa, we couldn't find good BBQ so we decided to be brave and try it ourselves. This recipe blew us away. Gee, I really can cook afterall! Total winner. The combination of orange and worcestershire sauce gave way to a truly palatable experience!

Being my first attempt to make ribs without the conventional, sticky and strong tasting store bought BBQ sauces, I am probably not qualified to rate this recipe.....but I will tell you....everybody loved how it turned out. Definitely a keeper.

A nice change from the plain barbeque sauce. I added a touch of barbeque to thicken up the marinade and also suggest cooking the ribs right in the marinade rather than a foil-lined one. It gives it a lot more tenderness. Used this for 60 pounds of ribs and it was a hit. To the "Tastes Like Mud" comment, you must not know how to follow a recipe, and improvising helps also, try it again. Great dish, highly recommend.

This is a wonderful change from the usual barbecued baby backs. The orange/garlic/honey flavor is perfect. At one dinner party, this dish was a hit. Caution: be careful during the reduction process. The honey concoction tends to boil over easily, creating quite a mess if it does.

My husband and I love this dish and serve it with either green chile/cheddar cheese mashed potatoe or Zatarain's black beans and rice. don't skip the grilling part because it really adds to the flavor.

This was delicious with a slightly unusual flavour thanks I think to the combination of garlic and orange, easy to make and used ingredients usually on hand - all the components of a really great recipe. No time to marinate, I browned the ribs under the broiler, steamed them for an hour and then baked them in their sauce at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. Into the oven with them to brown went (fully-cooked in the microwave, covered, on high for 20 min, turning several times) dish of cut up potatoes and two large quartered onions tossed with olive oil, butter, sage, oregano, basil and savory. Even tastier with garlic added but would not have worked with this main course dish already containing garlic.

This was fabulous! We really enjoyed it. I didn't have enough time to marinate, so instead I baked them in the marinade at 300 degrees for 2 hours. It was great!

Thought they were very good, even though my husband charred them a little in the grilling phase

I've made this recipe several times. Now my friends invite me over to marinate the ribs for them! Very easy and not too sticky!

We shared this dish with friends and everyone raved how good it was. You can't go wrong with this recipe. Simply wonderful.

Terrific marinade for pork for those who like a little sweet with their savory! Here is a great accompaniment - grilled pineapple rings! just baste buttered & skewered rings along side your ribs with the same sauce - don't forget to grind on a little pepper too! Fabuloso with a scoop of vanilla icecream.............

What can I say more that each of the other reviewers have not already said. These ribs were absolutely the best. Period!!

I took these on our camping trip at the beach and they were definately a hit!! I made them a couple of days ahead of time and froze them. They packed great in the ice chest and were the perfect beach snack! I also used the marinade recipe for chicken wings, also incredible!

It was so delicious my family raved for days.! My nephew who is a very picky eater had seconds and my brother who rarely eats pork made a 'pig' of himself'(excuse the pun). I have mailed this to several friends already! This is now the family favorite! I just increased the garlic, but then I always do that!

I have done this recipe twice - once as given and then with 30 pounds of ribs for a party. On both occasions ther were no leftovers, just a lot of smiling faces. My kids had thirds ( with lots of napkins!! ). I served baked sweet potatos with honey butter and broccoli cole slaw as sides... worked very well...

I've already made this a couple of times. Easy to do, wonderful flavour. I think the zest of the orange adds some intensity to this. After baking, I finish the ribs off on the BBQ. Use low heat so they don't burn... I substitute maple syrup for the honey, and add some white wine.

THIS RECIPE DIDN'T TAKE A LOT OF INGREDIENTS. IT WAS EASY TO DO, AND THE RIBS CAME OUT SO TENDER, THEY FELL OFF THE BONE! WITH JUST A SUBTLE TASTE OF ORANGE, IT WAS A CHANGE FROM THE USUAL BAR-B-QUE FLAVOR WE USUALLY ASSOCIATE WITH SPARE RIBS.
