I reduced salt as recommended by other reviewers. Found this recipe very easy and the finished product pretty good. My only complaint might be that the crust didn't get very brown. But that could be because I made bread rolls instead of a loaf so it wasn't in the oven as long.

This is a pretty easy bread to make and the addition of raisins and walnuts bumps up the texture.

This recipe calls for way too much salt! If not for that it may have been all right.

This is a very nice bread - whether it's 100% whole wheat or not. It's not the best I've ever made, but much better than many, and I'll make it again. To the cook from St. Louis - - how can you substitute wheat germ for oat bran and expect success? They're two different things, in taste, texture, and what it actually is!

Love the idea of both make-ahead/bake later versions -- thank you, Bon Appetit! But this bread was a disappointment, even on a snowy winter day when hot bread should taste its very best. The only change I made was the substitution of wheat germ for oat bran. But I found the texture rough, the flavor bland, the nuts (even toasted) an apparent afterthought.

Okay, so this is not 100% whole wheat bread but it's absolutely delicious. The raisins and walnuts are a great addition. I've used this recipe several times and have never been disappointed. It's easy, and IS wonderful toasted with jam for breakfast!

Nice enough bread, but nothing special. I thought it tasted a little salty and a little yeast-y. Marvelously dense and chewy. The raisins are the star ingredient.

Well, it may not be a real whole wheat bread but it is easy, easy, easy and delicious. I have made it twice since the issue came out and will definitely make it again. Great toasted for breakfast.

This is *not* whole wheat bread!! There's more white flour ("bread flour") than whole wheat flour... If you want a whole-grain bread, don't waste your time with this one.
