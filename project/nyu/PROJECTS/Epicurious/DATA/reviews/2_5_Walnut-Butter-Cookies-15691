Totally dry & bland cookies. Waste of ingredients! It's like they're half a recipe -- shouldn't these be accompanied by jam, or something? Flavorless otherwise.

I made these cookies last year as part of a mixed tin of cookies that I gave to MANY people. I was not impressed but my husband and people who received them raved! I will try them again this year with some of the modifications recommended and see what everyone thinks. Thanks for the suggestions!

I like the shortbread style of cookie, so I knew I would like these. I chopped the walnuts pretty finely and after reading the previous reviews, I admit I added some orange peel, vanilla and a pinch more salt. They are very easy to make and you will probably always have the ingredients on hand. I also did not feel the need to cover in powdered sugar. If you like cookies that are buttery and not too sweet, I would recommend these for you.

I lost my recipe for walnut cookies and I was in a jam so I decided to try this recipe. Since I made these cookies I have found my original recipe and with a few changes these cookies can be a 4 fork recipe. Simply add 1 tsp of vanilla and substitute 3/4 cup regular sugar for the 1/2 cup brown. Let me know what you think.

Ok, it was relatively easy and fun to make, but it's nothing special. Nothing that great. Kind of bland. I would probably make it again but just to kill time.

In general, I find Epicurious.com's reviews so helpful and indicative of how the recipe will turn out for me. But this was one of those very rare times when my experience was different. I agree with Caracas that the cookies were easy to make, not too sweet, and crumbly, but instead of being delicious, they tasted (and looked) kind of blah.

a really good and easy butter cookie. We just tried it using pecans and they were wonderful- my husband and five year old inhaled them even though they weren't chocolate.
