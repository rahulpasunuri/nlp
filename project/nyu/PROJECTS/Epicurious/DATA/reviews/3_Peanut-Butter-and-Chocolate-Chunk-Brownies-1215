I made this recipe using the suggested timing and testing method and it worked perfectly. The squares came out after 33 minutes looking a little soft in the centre - crispy, but soft underneath - but when tested with a toothpick as suggested I indeed got "moist crumbs" so I let them sit for 20 minutes and they came out perfect - fudgy, not cake-like, but definitely fully cooked, with a crispy surface and great peanut-chocolate flavour. I used 1 cup sugar and 71% bittersweet chocolate because I don't like squares too sweet - the suggested amount of sugar would probably be perfect for most dessert lovers though.

Yummy! The peanut butter is subtle but adds richness. I left out the vanilla (didn't have it) and added a teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa powder to the batter. Also added a couple tablespoons of half&half.

The cookie itself was moist and had a good texture, but overall, the cookie was a bit bland and lacked substance. Perhaps one could add nuts or more chocolate to it to make it a little more special.

I made the mistake of NOT listening to other reviewers and baked the stated 33 minutes. They were not even close to being done. 33 minutes in a 9x13 pan, perhaps, but easily 55 minutes in an 8x8. There are too many recipes out there to mess with this one, again.

Right after I added the sugar, I realized I could have a real mess on my hands because I had used freshly ground HONEY ROASTED peanut butter, rather than regular! So I added a little bit more flour and an extra egg, and banked on the one review that said they were too "cakey". I made a double batch and baked them about 10-15 minutes longer than the recipe called for. Viola! These were YUMMY!

My family loves this recipe so much my grandson asked for it as a birthday cake. I baked it in rounds and added a dark chocolate frosting and the kids loved it. It's a real keeper!

I replaced the regular butter with 6 tablespoons of unsweetened apple sauce. Didn't even miss the extra saturated fat. Next time might even use double the sauce to make the brownies more moist. Otherwise very delicious.

Definitely needed additional baking time mentioned by others. I thought these were good brownies but a little too sweet

Yuck! Can't figure out what the fuss is about. The brownies turned out fine, thanks to the posts about lengthened baking time. But the flavor was awful. I used quality ingredients - Arrowhead Mills Crunchy Valencia Peanut Butter and Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate. Will look for other recipes.

These are absolutely fabulous brownies once they're actually baked. I've made them several times and sometimes it's been so long between bakings that I forget that the baking time, 33 minutes, is way too short. I'm not sure why, but I have always had to bake an additional 20 minutes at least. Excellent brownies once the timing is correct. I've starting baking them every Christmas. The kids love them. A keeper recipe.

Incredibly easy - uses ingredients I already had - my friends loved them. I made two batches and am sending a third to my dad for father's day.

Don't waste your time or ingredients if like chewy-type brownies, these brownies are cake-like and nothing special.

We had a BBQ and made these brownies. We had left overs of everything except the brownies!!

These are easy, moist and a great alternative to the same old chocolate brownie!

These are delicious! Not lo-fat in the slightest but terrific if you really want to splurge. They required a slightly longer cooking time though, more like 40 min. or so - the didn't seem to want to set up in the center. Also, I lined the pan with foil to make it easier to cut them, this worked well.

I've made this recipe repeatedly in the past three years. Easy, uses ingredients I usually have on hand, and very good.
