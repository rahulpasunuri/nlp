Great flavor....I would make it again, but definitely with less salt.

This was good--everyone really liked it. The cooking method was perfect--the meat was cooked just right. As for the rub, it was good, but I think I could do better. This recipe definitely got me thinking about how I'd do it next time. The methodology is just right--so this is the kind of recipe you can make your own. I didn't find Szechuan peppercorns and used regular black peppercorns--I'd recommend cutting back as I thought the pepper overpowered the other spices.

Boooooring. There are so many better things to do with a million dollars worth of meat!

This was a huge hit at my dinner party. Although I almost fainted at how expensive the roast was, I decided it was well worth it for this special dinner party. I couldn't find the anise or special peppercorns so I used regular pepper and no anise. It was still awesome.
