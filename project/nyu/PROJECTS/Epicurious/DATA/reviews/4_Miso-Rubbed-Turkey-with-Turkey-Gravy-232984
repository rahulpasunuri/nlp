Used this recipe for a 12 lb turkey on Thanksgiving. Skin got very crisp and browned even with the foil on. Had to use more water because it kept evaporating. For gravy used this concept, but used chicken stock simmered with turkey giblets while the turkey cooked, strained the stock, then followed recipe.

All I can say is that this was an awesome recipe. So so so so so easy!! I forgot to stick the rest of the onion inside the bird, but I don't think anyone noticed or cared...

I made this turkey last year for Thanksgiving and plan to make it again this year. I loved it and so did all of my guests. I made the gravy, though I will admit that I didn't follow the gravy recipe exactly and I also placed herbs and citrus fruits in the body cavity of the bird while it cooked. My gravy turned out great.

Yum! The turkey was unbelievably moist and delicious and I can't wait to make it again! I skipped the gravy and accompanied the turkey with "Trio of Roasted Potatoes" also from this site. Can't wait to make this turkey again!

Delightfully easy, yielding a moist, flavorful turkey. I skipped the gravy, as the meat was tender and juicy enough without it. I do recommend untenting the turkey at some point to allow the skin to brown attractively. Definitely a keeper.

Don't bother with the gravy - its boring and there is way too much - I prefer the canned stuff over it. The miso butter itself is so tasty, it might be nice to have as a side. Some work to put butter under skin but definitely a moist turkey will be yours..

I made this for Thanksgiving and followed the recipe perfectly, although, I thought the gravy was a little boring. The turkey was perfect and deliciously moist. I will definitely make it this way again and try to make the gravy more exciting.

This is the first time I ever tried to make a whole turkey. I made it for Thanksgiving for myself and my girlfriend, who is (was) anti-turkey. I followed the directions, roasted til the breast was 160 and let it sit, and the meat was flavorful and moist. My turkey-hating friend loved it; in fact she had leftovers for at least 3 meals. If I ever make a turkey again, this is the recipe I will use.

I loved this recipe! The miso did give a fabulous rich flavor and incredibly moist meat however I didn't find that it prevented the skin from being crispy at all. It was mahogany and sounded like potato chips when you were eating it was so crispy. It was just perfect. I do agree there is WAY too much gravy. I halved the gravy recipe and kept additional stock for soup still we had gravy left over.

This turkey was very good and easy. the meat was very juicy and had great natural flavor. I found that it took a bit longer to cook (3.5-4hrs for 11.75lb bird). the recipe also calls for too much gravy. i would halve the stock.

This is the best turkey that I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly, and the meat was perfectly done, moist and tender. The leftovers were great the next day. Definitely a keeper!
