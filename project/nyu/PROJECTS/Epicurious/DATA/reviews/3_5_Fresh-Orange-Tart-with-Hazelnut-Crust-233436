This recipe was a hastle from beginning to end. My hazelnuts would not chop in the food processor WITH the flour, so I had to take it all out and sift the hazelnuts out, then put the flour back in the processor. That was just one of many problems...there wasn't enough dough to extend 1/4 inch over the top etc... As for flavor,it did taste good. An insane amount of butter, but I tried not think about that when I indulged. My guests loved it and the candied oranges were a beautiful touch (couldn't find blood oranges in 2 stores, so used a regular orange), but honestly, I will never make it again.

Very good. The crust was quite think. The filling was quite good, but mild flavored.

This was so delicious! I didn't do the Hazelnut crust, I did just a basic sweet tart dough and it was awesome. It tasted like an orange creamsicle. I also did the candied oranges which are simple and make it look extra special.

I made this tart for guests last night. It was outstanding. Everyone raved and wanted the recipe. Delicious, different and a great do ahead. I added the custard to the crust late in the afternoon as I suspect the crust will break down if the custard is left in it too long. Also did the candied blood oranges. They were showy, easy to make, and added that extra je ne sais quoi!

This was very good. It reminded me of orange ice cream from a Florida orange grove my family used to visit. Now if only i could figure out a way to get that taste without all the butter. I made it for a New Years party and everyone like it though no one raved.

I made this tart along with two other desserts for a dinner party, and this was the hands down favorite. My guests all said it was very refreshing. It was also easy to do ahead. The blood oranges I was able to find were not very dark, and the garnish looked like tomato slices to me. Still I would definitely make the dish again.
