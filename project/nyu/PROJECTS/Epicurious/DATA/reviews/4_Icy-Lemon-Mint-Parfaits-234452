Very refreshing, I served it as a granité (only the lemon-mint granité) between the main course and dessert. Huge success!

This was so delicious that it surprised me! The granite was the best! I would've liked the whipped cream without them mint. It was all so incredibly full of flavor though. Also, I mixed lime and lemons-extra flavor! Mmmm!!

This was very easy to make, very delicious and refreshing. Splenda can be substituted for the sugar without any change in consistency, taste or behavior of the granite for those watching sugar intake.

I made this for a Memorial Day BBQ yesterday. I only made the granité, not the whipped cream. And, I froze it in an ice cream maker rather than in a pan, so that it was more like a sorbet. Everyone loved it and several people asked for the recipe. I only had one cup of mint leaves (not two), but it still had a very strong mint flavor. It was very light and refreshing...

This was awesome - and very easy! It would be a winner for a warm summer nite dinner party!
