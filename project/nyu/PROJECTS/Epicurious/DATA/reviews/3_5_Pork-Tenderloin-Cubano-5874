Definitely better grilled, but add some olive oil to the marinade so the meat won't stick!

Very nice, but not "outstanding" enough to get 4 forks. Served it with a fresh pineapple salsa and black beans and rice. My guests loved it.

This is a great recipe. But I hate throwing away all that great marinade - what a waste of ingredients. I pureed the marinade a little bit, and I deglazed the pan with it. Nice to place some spoonfuls over the pork. DELICIOUS!

Boring, dull, tasteless and visually unappealing. The only thing that gave this flavor were the orange slices and cilantro garnish.

My dear exclaimed, that he had never had better pork in his life. Instead of in the oven, we put it on the grill. I added mint, a little cilantro and omitted the cumin.

Absolutley amazing. I have made this dish several times and I have experimented making a sauce with the marinade. I added some butter, a teaspoon of brown sugar, and a splash Malibu coconut rum to the marinade and it turned out great. I served it with black beans, fried plantains and a roasted corn salad. The next day I made cuban sandwiches with the left over meat.

Very easy to put together. My husband really liked it. I thought it was just ok. I boilded the marinade to serve along side as others recommended. But i found the sauce grainy because of the cumin and preferred the meat without. I served is with a black bean and rice salad. I think some olive oil in the marinade may have improved the final results. Might try it again if I have all the ingredients on hand.

I have made this many times and it's always a hit. I sometimes include lime and orange slices in the marinade and it's even better. Leftovers are great to shred and make cuban sandwiches.

Thankfully I followed the suggestion and made a sauce from the marinade, it was the only thing that made this dish edible. Visually very unappealing, flavor was just, yuk. I can't imagine serving this to company. One of the first epicurious recipes I've tried that were this much of a disappointment. Save your pork for something (anything) better.

Rating: 4
WOW!! I was a little scared because of the mixed reviews but I thought it was awesome. Just like in my favorite cuban restaurants. I followed the recipe except for I grilled the pork about 20 minutes (indirect). And I boiled the marinade and added 3T butter at the end for a sauce. Served it with rice and Trader Joes cuban style black beans. Will definitely do this for company this summer.

Rating: 1
Very bland and somewhat dry. It didn't look very appetizing, either. Normally, I'd try it again using tips from other reviewers. However, in this case, I was so disappointed that I don't think I'll try it again at all.

Excellent recipe. The pork was flavorful and juicy, would recommend adding a bit more heat if you like it spicy. Definitely try it if you are looking for a different way to serve pork.

This was okay but not great. It had a vaguely citrus flavor, but nothing extraordinary. I have no idea why some readers say it has "kick."

I made this and found that the pork was both flavourful and moist. Our guests loved it. I made it with rice and peas, cucumber salad and sauted green beans (from this website). It was easy and I will make it again.

Really good! Tastier than I thought the marinade would be-

I thought this was great... I only had time to marinade for about 5 hours, but it was still really flavorful. We cooked it indirect on the charcoal grill and it stayed super moist. I served it with a black bean salad (black beans with chopped avocado, mango, onion, fresh corn, tomato, cilantro all mixed with lime juice, olive oil, and S and P) Almost even better were the cuban sandwiches I made with the leftover pork (thinly sliced pork, a few slices of ham, cheese, pickles, some chipotle mayo, and leftover grilled peppers -- not all traditional, I know -- on fresh bread grilled with butter) Oh My!

This recipe is very easy and absolutely delicious. I had to cook my tenderloins 35 minutes rather than the 25 minutes the recipe states. I can't wait to eat the leftovers in a sandwich!

I think I was expecting more of a punch. After this recipe, I decided I prefer my tenderloins seared first, and then dressed with a tart sauce. The tenderloin took on the flavors but I didn't care for the result. A little lack-luster

This marinade is wonderful for any type of pork. I used Egg and I brand (organic) pork chops and grilled them. I boiled the marinade and served over the pork chops, but next time I would add some honey or sugar. It is a bit acidic and tart. I made the tropical salsa with mango and kiwi on epicurious. I also made a salad with corn from the cob, sweet grape tomatoes, peas, green onion, basil, and 1 T. butter. I would make this again. Great for summer barbecues.

This was so delicious - and easy. As Mari says, it's nice for during the week because you can marinate it overnight and then just pop it in the oven (although I did have to cook it for about 40 minutes), but it's certainly MUCH better than anything I usually cook after work... unlike cook from Boston, I served this to company and it was perfect. Alongside I served cuban-style black beans (from epicurious) and a bibb lettuce salad with oranges. Wonderful!

Extremely easy and tasty tenderloin! Go easy on the salt (if any). I'd definitely make it again - a simple and elegant roast that doesn't take all day.

I made this for my 4th of July party. I grilled the tenderloin rather than bake it. Everyone loved it, especially the Cubans in the family. I followed the advice and made the Tropical Fruit Salsa to go along with the pork. The Salsa was a hit by itself but it didn't add too much to the pork.

In August in Texas, we try to avoid the oven at all costs, so we grilled this one. Absolutely wonderful!

Good, not great on its own. Any tropical fruit made into salsa will make this very, very good. We had it hot one night and thought it was even better served cold as leftovers!

Rating: 3
Moist and delicious! The OJ worked like the citruc juices in ceviche, infusing the tenderloin with flavor in the 20 hours it sat in the marinade. Turned out that we didn't have cumin after all, so I just substituted pinches of world spices in our cupboard (cardamom, mace, clove, chili powder, turmeric, white pepper) and went heavy on the garlic. Still delicious! My husband also loved it and we will be making this again.

Delicious and tender. I grilled it and served with fried plantains, rice and black beans. Husband and kids loved it. Started with some mojitos and it is a wonderful festive summer dinner! No leftovers here.

Absolutely delicious! I gave a small dinner party last night and forgot to serve the Tropical Salsa at first. I looked at the pork o my plate and realized something was missing. Quickly got the Tropical Salsa I had made to go with this dish and it was a hit! The marinade for the meat really made the meat flavorable (only marinaded for 24 hours)and then the salsa just topped it off! Definitely will use again in a future dinner party!

Excellent flavour, marinated overnight and grilled on the barbecue. Will be added to my favourites file. Served it with the Tropical Fruit Salsa also from Epicurious, the combination was perfect.

This was my first foray into the field of roasting meat! Heretofore, my husband was in charge of such duties. I'm delighted to say that the pork loin was wonderful...a big hit at a dinner party that night. Marinated about 24 hours...wonderful flavor. I have since made it again and enjoyed it once again. Leftovers are terrific for fajitas or burritos.

Rating: 4
Absolutely excellent! I marinated it for 48 hours, grilled it outdoors, and served it with its juices over jasmine rice. On the side, I served refried black beans and grilled corn (with a chili rub on the corn, Paprika and cayenne with alittle butter). I garnished the entire dish with grilled onions from the marinade, fresh diced tomatoes, cilantro! I highly recommend it!

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe. I made double the amount. On day one, I cooked the onions/garlic marinade (to boiling point, in case you were wondering) with black beans and served it with rice and the pork - YUM. On day two, I took the remaining pork, shredded it, and mixed it with really good BBQ sauce and served with mac and cheese and green beans. My southern husband loved it both times! PS: Cook from Minneapolis - Try cutting down the marinade time...36 hours sounds like way too long for just pork tenderloin.

Rating: 3
Very good and easy. As long as you remember to marinate the day before, you can whip this up in a hurry on meal day. Be sure to flip the tenderloins after a half day to coat evenly. I saved the onions from the marinade and cooked them to be served as a bed on the platter for the tenderloin. I served the tenderloin with the "Maple Glazed Carrots" on this site. . .good comfort food for the winter.

I have made this recipe every summer since it first appeared and my husband and I both love it! Make sure you turn the pork while marinading it so that the flavor is evenly distributed. I serve this with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and zuccini. I like to start with gazpacho.

We really enjoyed this dish. I did not like the marinade as a sauce. The roast gave off delicious pan drippings which we liked better. I think next time I will strain the onions from the marinade and either carmelize them or cook them with the meat.

The pork was wonderfully tender but my family had a hard time getting past the strong taste of oregano. Easy to make however.

This dish is very good, but I would not say fantastic. I marinated the pork for 24 hours. I did grill it rather than bake it which I would do again. The meat was very tender. It did seem to be lacking something. I served the marinade on the side (heated and thickened slightly with cornstarch) which I believe is a must. If I make again, I am going to experiment further with adding more spice.

My second favorite pork tenderloin recipe of all time. First is pork tenderloin calypso also on this web page. Marinated for two days....and left at room temperature for the last two hours. Served with the Black Bean and Rice Salad (that I think I like better than the pork) also on this web page. Finale was key lime pie....everyone thought it was wonderful. Many thanks to the previous reviewers for the great suggestions!!!

My husband, the pickiest eater ever, gave this recipe 5 stars! The pork is extremely tender and juicy, and I used the leftover marinade to make sauce- just put in on the stove and added a little arrowroot. I will be making this again for sure (my husband already requested it for his birthday dinner- and that's 10 months away!).

Very flavorful and authentic Cuban taste (I was born there, I know). I topped it with caramelized onions and served it over rice with fried plantains on the side. Everyone loved it. My non-Cuban husband raved over it. I regret not saving the marinade and making a sauce from it as other cooks did. Will definitely do that next time. Great winter dinner party dish.

After following the instructions I decided that this dish definitely needed some help. The second time I made it I marinaded it for 2 days. I the meat with olive oil, dusted it with cilantro, fresh orange peel, and black pepper, sprayed them again and cooked them over direct heat on the grill untill they were nicely browned, then indirect heat until done. The last 15 minutes I basted them with a sauce consisting of the juice of two oranges, equal part Grand Marnier, 2 tbls orange extract, 1 tsp orange peel, and 2 tbls brown sugar. Reduced is to 1/2 cup, added black pepper and 1.5 tbls butter. This dish was delicious.

I sliced a cheaper cut of pork in equal quarters and marinated it for 30+ hours. The results were outstanding! The marinade really tenderized the cheap cut. The flavor was the best. No one could stop eating until everything was gone. I fixed this with traditional black beans and rice. I also strained the onions and sauteed them until brown and then added the marinade and simmered it down to a thick no drip gravy. What a treat!

This was yummy! Even my three young boys ate it. I thought the flavors of the marinade were quite evident. I accompanied it with aromatic yellow rice topped with cuban black beans. Next time I'll make it for company!

The pork flavor was delicious, but the consensus was that the pork needed something a little wet to go with it. I cooked it to the exact temp. in the recipe, so the pork wasn't at all dry. I tried boiling the marinade, as some others suggested, but it had meat juices in it and was frothy and yucky looking and tasted too overpowering. Instead, I strained out the onions and fried them with a little sugar. They were a delicious accompaniment but still not quite enough - we all wanted something to wet the pork a little. I would make this again if I could find the sauce to go with it.

I am originally from Miami so I know good cuban marinade when I taste it and this is great. I found it to be better on chicken and instead of orange juice I use sour orange. I cook the left over marinade and add it to either drained black beans or saute it into rice. Yum.

I also took the others' advice and let it marinate an extra day. It was very tender and the flavors were amazing. Sadly, I forgot to make the sauce with it that was suggested; that would've been to die for! DEFINITELY a do-over!

Wonderful! Thanks to previous reviewers - combined ideas: Marinated an extra day, strained marinade cooked it down a bit and added 1-2 T honey and 1-2 T. butter to make sauce. Served with spinach/orange salad and black bean/roast corn/red pepper salad. One of my summer entertaining menu this year!

My husband and I loved this dish. However, I could not justify discarding the marinade with such wonderful ingredients. So I strained it, then added a teaspoon of honey and boiled it for about 5 minutes. Then spooned the sauce on the pork. I think it added to the already great recipe.

I used boneless pork loin cut in 3/4 inch cutlets and marinaded it for a day and a half, then grilled it. The meat was very, very tender and flavorful. It tasted just like the meat at a local Cuban resturant. We served it with seasoned yellow rice and spicy black beans. Served it twice to company and everyone loved it.

I used a boneless pork loin roast as my store was out of tenderloin. The meat absorbed the flavors of the marinade and was delicious. I am generally not a pork lover as I find it tasteless, but this was not. Moist and tender - I always use a meat thermometer so as not to overcook and end up dry. I probably used a bit more garlic than called for, as I like it. Next time I think I'm going to make a separate marinade for more onions, and then saute them and serve them over the pork as my husband and I have had in restaurants down in Little Havana, Miami.

It is true, this dish packs a lot of heat. You might need to shorten the cooking time to prevent to pork from being chewy. Cut the pork into strips and serve fajita style.
