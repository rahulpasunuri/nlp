Very good. Hearty. The filling is just as good by itself.

a very tasty vegetarian thanksgiving entree. it even received raves from the turkey- eaters. it was, however, quite time- consuming to assemble. i substituted the cornbread portion of this recipe with three packages of cornbread/muffin mix and shortened the bake time by about 15 minutes. the mole turned out to be quite excellent, though 12 minutes is far too long to toast the seasame seed/almond/peanut/raisin mixture. mine ended up ever so slightly over- done, which may have imparted some bitterness to the sauce. i added about 2-3 tablespoons of sugar (extra raisins would probably be wonderful too) and this seemed to balance the flavors nicely.

This recipe was a hit but with a big modification!! I followed the corn bread recipe and it was a watery mess. Then I noticed a review saying that it needed twice as much corn meal. I pre-baked it and it was like tasteless, gritty cardboard. I threw that out and pressed the filling into a dish and covered it with a boxed corn bread mix. I bought pre-cut squash cubes which eliminated a big chunk of the labor. It was delicious. The mole sauce was great on lots of the Thanksgiving dishes.

This is a great dish for vegetarian Thanksgiving because it keeps you in the kitchen all day, giving you that real holiday experience without all the turkey guts! On its own, the casserole is fine but not great. It is, however, a very nice vehicle for mole, which is otherwise hard to use in veggie dishes. I used a different mole recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/108581 I made two versions of it, one with chocolate and one without. Both were a BIG hit at T-give 2006, though I preferred the chocolatey one. I may make this again some year.

My vegetarian guests liked this, but I did not think it was that great. The cornbread never really set up and it was a lot of prep work for the filling. I ended up with two full casseroles. Only so-so for all of the work.

Rather underwhelming. I added a tablespoon of Tabasco brand chipotle sauce to try to bring some flavor to the filling, with not much luck. I lightened the cornbread significantly - cut the butter by 2/3rds, substituted egg beaters for the egg and used half the cheese (and 2% milk cheese as well), which worked very well - not bad at all. But the end result was pretty blah. Even my wonderful mole imported from L.A. couldn't salvage the meal. I'm sorry I have so many leftovers!

I was very disappointed in this dish after reading all the raves. The mole was very good, but the full recipe is enough mole to last me the rest of my life! Likewise with the casserole, the amount it makes is oppressive. The cornbread crust is very dry and heavy and the filling was honestly just so-so, really nothing special despite all the mushrooms. I would give this a miss and use the mole recipe for something special. Oh, someone remarked this was like tamales - not a bit. More like biscuits.

This dish was over the top fantastic. Made it for thanksgiving and once they tried it, no one wanted any of the other food on the table. Perfect for vegetarians and carnavores alike, and made great leftovers too. Definitly a time consuming recipe, so great for special occasions but not for everyday. I would go light on the extra water in the filling next time.

I made this cornbread crust with a different filling (with pinto beans, corn, tomatoes and bell peppers). I don't know whether it was because of this but I didn't find it time-consuming at all. I made the dough the day before but didn't assemble it until it was ready to go in the oven as I didn't want the crust to get soggy. It was still a little soft on the bottom but firm enough. I suppose one could try pre-baking it as another reviewer suggested or maybe even sprinkling some grated cheese over it before adding the filling. Also, I think I made my crust a little too thick (not for me, but non-cornbread-lovers may find it a bit much!).

Although this recipe was a tiny bit time-consuming, it isn't too bad if you do a few steps ahead of time. In fact, the squash filling is much better the day after it has been made and has had time to steep in the spices. This recipe was a big hit at my Thanksgiving party as a vegetarian entree, especially with the outstanding Ancho Mole sauce recipe which I followed to a tee. I would definitely make this recipe again, but would cut down on the cornbread amount.

This recipe was far too time-consuming for me to ever consider making it again. It just wasn't worth all the effort. The mole could have been more flavorful - kick up the spice more - and I made the cornbread crust too thick - my kids left their crusts on their plates unfinished.

Made this casserole and mole for a Friday night dinner party and it was a hit. I was looking for something that cold be done the night before and this worked out great. It came together rather quickly despite the long list of ingrediants. My guests were practically eating the mole out of the serving bowl. It did require longer cooking time to get the crust done. I too used a bunch of different mushrooms and think that all crimini or portobello would have been fine. With 6 guests, we wound up with a pretty good amount leftover, which reheated very well a couple of days later. Overall this was really good and I agree with other reviwers that there are quite a number of possibilities for experimenting with different fillings, which I am definitely planning to do.

I cut this recipe in half, and made it for our Thanksgiving dinner. The mole was pretty time-consuming, but well worth it, because my husband kept trying to think of ways to use it afterward. The dish is like a tamale in a casserole, and we really enjoyed it. I used a mix of oyster mushrooms and regular button, that I found on sale. The flavors were great!

This dish was good, my husband really liked it. However, for the amount of time spent preparing it (and the cost of the mushrooms) I was hoping for a great dish. I won't make it again simply because I didn't feel it was worth the effort, nothing difficult and all steps worked as described, just time consuming.

in order to save time and money, I used the jiff cornbread mix but made it with water and butter and added cheese to it. I also used a jar of mole sauce from Wild Oats. Finally I only made half the recipe cause there were only 2 of us. It all worked out well and was very good. I liked the filling alot and might just only put the crust on top next time.

This dish has a lot of prep time. All told is was several hours. I didn't mind because it makes for a lot of leftovers! It would serve way more than the 8 servings listed. It would probably serve 12-14. You have to cook the filling a lot longer than the times listed to get the squash done. It took me about 45 minutes to get the consistency right. It made us run late for our expected dinner guests. This is excellent served with some home made guacamole and pico de gallo on the side.

This was very good. I made it for vegetarian guests at Thanksgiving, with hazelnut mole from another menu (the bacon-wrapped turkey breast from December BA). It was great with the mole. I found the mushrooms lost in the other flavors & textures. Criminis would be fine. I also added a roasted red pepper. Black beans and tomatoes from 2 cans, but not the full 2 cans? C'mon. Next time I'll add 1 full can diced tomatoes in juice, 2 full cans drained beans. Maybe some extra shredded cheese on top of the filling. The plastic wrap was key to getting the dough in the pan properly. The masa/tamale dough was just right. I found the measures to be accurate. It makes a big pan, and we have leftovers and a dinner in the freezer from this. I would recommend making it, and if it's in you, some experimentation with the filling components.

I just made this for my vegetarian husband for Thanksgiving dinner. It was absolutely divine. I found it easy to prepare (afterall the only prep is chopping and cooking some veggies, opening a couple of cans and preparing a very simple dough) and was perfect for the day since I could throw it in the oven and get everything else ready while it baked. Vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike will love this.

This was a very successful dish, both in flavor and presentation. My guests were especially enamoured of the ancho mole sauce, even those who have not previously liked mole. The casserole served 8 with about an equal amount left over. I used a variety of mushrooms as suggested, but there were so many flavors already that I don't really think it was necessary; all crimini or portobello would have been fine. We made this dish a few hours ahead, and I think I would prebake the bottom layer of cornbread somewhat if I were doing it that way again, as the filling was still quite wet after much longer cooking than recommended, and the bottom seemed doughy in spots. Certainly a minor tweak for a fine recipe.

First of all, this is a delicioius dish. I assembeled half a batch, so I have the rest of the squash, mushroom mixture and mole in the freezer for another time. On the otherhand, It is VERY LABOR intensive. After I assemble it next time, I doubt I'll make it again.

there is an error in the recipe. there should only be about 2 - 2 1/2 c. of water for the cornbread. this almost caused our dinner party to go wrong. luckily, we had twice as much cheese, masa, and other ingredients to thicken the mixture back up. after we fix that, the end result was very delicious. the mole is out of this world.

tho this was a bit prep intense it was so worth it! the ancho mole was great and will definately make it again, a nice hearty autumn supper and awesome leftovers for lunch the next day, highly recomended vegetarian casserole that is not boring! I used several types of mushrooms that i had on hand and it was delicious.

I found this to be very labor intensive, the components and prep work taking forever. I think this article was titled "easy entertaining" or some such thing, and while the recipe wouldn't fit into the easy category, it is possible they are referring to the fact that it can be completely assembled the day before and then baked before serving, which is a real plus. The mole isn't bad to make and shouldn't be skipped. It really is delicious and I would make it again if I had the time and needed a vegetarian do-ahead dish. I also made the other component of this menu and the courses harmonized beautifully.
