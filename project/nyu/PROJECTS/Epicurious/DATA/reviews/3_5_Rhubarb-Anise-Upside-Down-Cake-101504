Super-duper!! Made as is. I used all the rhubarb by placing the first layer in concentric circles, then I randomly poured the second layer of rhubarb. It presented beautifully, and I'm glad I used all the rhubarb. The rhubarb to cake ratio was perfect.

Like o "A Cook from NY NY", I too did concentric circles and used 1/2 the rhubarb. I would've loved to find a way to add more, but how? Delicious, though not as pretty as I had hoped for

Made this recipe exactly as written using a cast iron frying pan. It came out beautifully and was a big hit. We will make it again for sure.

This was really a hit and so so easy. The only change I made was to substitute dried orange peel for the anise seeds. A show stopper and great non-pie use of ruhbarb!

This cake is exceptional. The crumb is very tender. It uses much less rhubarb than called for, maybe half as much. I did concentric circles of rhubarb - very pretty - and don't see how I could have fit more into my 10" cast iron pan.

This was pretty tasty. I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and it was plenty. Don't think I'd want to use more. But I think next time I'll sift it across the pan as it tended to glob up a bit. I also used fennel rather than anise seed. No problem. Also not a problem if you can't get the seeds powdery with your mortar and pestle. It was nice to find some more substantial bites with fennel. I had a blast laying out the checkerboard in the pan (total nerd), however, it didn't look nearly as glam as the photo, and certainly not as red. But no matter. The taste was good. Day two it isn't faring so well, however. The pudding consistency another reviewer mentioned has become really prominent today. Don't mistake me...I'm still going to finish it, but am making a note that I wouldn't recommend preparing it a day ahead.

Made this almost as written, only substituting plain yogurt for the buttermilk and using 9 ¼ stainless steel sauté pan. Arranged the rhubarb flat-sides down, in a checkerboard pattern which turned out beautifully! The cake was very tasty, but could have used a stronger anise flavour perhaps, in part because I used a full teaspoon of real vanilla. Next time I will double the anise seed. Also, I think using the paddle attachment instead of the whisk attachment on the beater might have made the cake a little less fluffy crumbly and more dense. The topping absorbed water from the rhubarb, creating a pudding-like layer below the fruit. I will experiment with perhaps cooking the sugar longer to see if that improves the caramelization. My partner liked the pudding-like goo layer though! Overall, nice, buttery, and homey, with a lovely presentation pre-slicing.

I made this for my book group, and even people who don't like rhubarb were taking seconds. I will be making this all summer long!

This was surprisingly good. I too would cut down on the brown sugar, thought it was a bit much. Love the cake texture.

This is truly delicious. I don't often add my reviews on epicurious, but this deserves accolades. I didn't change a thing except maybe reduce a bit of brown sugar because it seemed like a little too much. Try it. You'll like it!

Really lovely, and the anise is distinctive. Looks nice made in a square pan as well. Got raves for appearance & flavor.

Absolutely delicious, beautiful, simple and different. Loved it and will definitely make it again.

Alas, the super boyfriend was not able to make this cake for my birthday this past year. Perhaps he will see this review and make it for me real soon. I love this cake. I really do.

This was really really good and a great way to use rhubarb than in the usual pie. I made it in a cake pan with 2" sides, unfortunately it was a 9" pan and I ended up inserting that pan into a springform pan because I was afraid that it might run over. The end result was beautiful when I turned it out onto the plate since I'd also added some toasted almond slices. My brother even commented on the appearance! And everyone loved the combination of flavors.

My super boyfriend made this for my birthday many years ago and it is becoming a tradition. I think it's the best thing ever. I really do.

Most people I know who bake goodies from scratch with butter, spices and real fruit are not overweight. It is those who subsist on processed foods, "low fat" or otherwise, who gain weight. Real food tbat takes time to prepare is satisfying in healthy quantities.

Honestly! I used to be on a "cut fat" kick, now it's a "cut sugar" campaign. I've made this two weeks in a row, the first week following the recipe exactly (well, except for accidentally substituting caraway for anise since I was testing a dish for a St Patrick's dinner party and got caught up in the theme; BTW caraway was quite wonderful). But: by dropping the caramel to 2 T butter and 1/2 cup sugar (with NO taste difference) and the cake to 1/2 cup sugar (vs 2/3) and to all buttermilk AND by dropping the portion size to 10 vs 8 (still very generous pieces) calories drop 45% from 436 to 283 and for Weight Watchers, from 10 points to 6, or 55% to 33% of weight-losing calories thresholds for those of us under 150 lbs. And NO taste difference. Oh: I also substituted 1 t anise extract for 1/2 t vanilla, might have bumped the flavor a notch. This is delicious, it just doesn't need to be so decadent. This is another example of why I wish Bon Appetit and Gourmet would include nutrition information on every recipe: so they don't contribute to America's obesity epedemic. Repeat: NO TASTE DIFFERENCE. Except, maybe, that the anise flavor was more lovely when not competing with the sugar.

The anise and rhubarb combination is fabulous.

I found this recipe to be relatively easy to make. It's usually strawberry or raspberry rhubarb dessert combos. I like the fact that it was different, but not weird.

Just Superb! And you're right, you need not arrange the rhubarb in a circle unless you want to be terribly French. Just dump it in. Whipping cream... a lovely dessert.

Rating: 3
This dessert can also be baked in a 9" tart pan, just be midful that the butter might ooze out of the bottom where the ring meets the pan. Nevertheless, it works beautifully for the person who does not have a cast-iron skillet to bake in. And I also agree that 35 minutes is a more reasonable baking time than 45.

This is a fabulous recipe...one that looks like it was created by a pastry chef, even if you just throw the rhubarb on in a haphazard fashion! Very quick and easy, it has really impressed our guests. I came close to giving it a four fork rating.

It was really good and is one of the few baked rhubarb recipes that you don't need to make a crust for. The top is very impressive.

Very good, anise flavoring can be used to taste if seeds are not available. If doing so, vut the amount of vanilla down. It is a very flavorful dessert and a good mix of tastes and textures

This has become spring-time favorite...Almost as good with frozen rhubarb out-of-season. This is a good combination of a heavy cake with a delicate flavor. Rich, moist and they'll ask for seconds!r
