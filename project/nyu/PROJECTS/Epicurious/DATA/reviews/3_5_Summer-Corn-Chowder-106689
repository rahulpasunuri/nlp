As many people mentioned, this soup is pretty bland before seasoning. I added quite a bit of salt and pepper, then a bunch of stuff from the spice rack. The best addition was a healthy dose of cayenne; it gave a heat that paired really well with the sweet corn. Also seasoned salt, garlic powder, and chili powder. If it still tastes bland, just keep adding! End result was fantastic.

Excellent corn chowder recipe !

When I think of chowder, I think of something more hearty with more seasoned flavors. This recipe was more soup than chowder. I added salt, pepper and paprika, but still was lacking flavor other than delicious veggies. I wouldn't make this again.

delicious soup! it lends itself well to whatever veggies you have on hand. i added green beans and carrots and a little broccoli and just used the one pepper i had. it was a big hit and i will make it again. with my additions, it certainly made more than 4-5 servings.

This recipe was easy very good. Unlike other reviews, I did not find this to be bland at all. It says 'salt, to taste,' and I think a lot of people tend to under-salt. Anyway, make sure to use enough salt and pepper, and I also used an immersion blender - add the corn (step 3), let it simmer 8 minutes, use an immersion blender. Then add the bell peppers and half-and-half and simmer another 8 minutes uncovered. That will help thicken it and gives it more body. Would definitely make this again!

I agree about the blandness. I added tons of pepper, and a bit of basil and cayenne with the onions, but it still tasted a bit flat. Next time I'll add some garlic and more cayenne. Otherwise, it was easy, and (with adjustments) just the ticket for a rainy summer evening.

Super bland to me. I doubled the recipe. I used 8c (per suggestions to knock back liquid amount) Heres what I did to make it pretty good after an hour: added a little thyme, a little oregano, celery, 2 tbsps turbinado sugar, 2 cloves garlic, 1/4 c chopped cilantro, tsp cumin. I also think there's just way too many potatoes. I knocked back the onion to 1 1/2. Then I used and imersion (sp?) blender and thickened it with that.

I've been looking for a fresh corn chowder for a bit (no canned corn) and this was really good. I did make a few changes though.- because i wanted a slightly sweeter taste. I used two leeks instead of onion and I added two carrots. I also followed another suggestion and subed cilantro - basil just didn't sound right. I also pureed about 2 cups of soup to add some thickness. Quite tasty. As an aside, 4 cups of corn was about 5 ears for me...

pretty good for something so easy to make. I did have to adjust seasoning to give it more flavor, but it's a refreshing soup for summer.

I hate to be the lone dissenter but I found this recipe to be very bland. To be fair I did double the recipe and that may have changed something. I grilled the corn first hoping it would give more flavor but to no avail.

This dish was easy and sooo delicious. I used 4 cups of veggie broth and a cup of 1% and it was perfect. I pureed about a cup or 2 and it gae the soup the illusion of being very creamy. Next time i might even try a little more broth. I also used frozen corn because it was easier and it tasted fresh and wonderful. Highly recommend this soup as a low-fat, high taste dish.

I used all my basil to make pesto yesterday so lumped in 3 heaping tablespoons of the pesto and it tasted GOOOOOOOOD. I also went for 4 cups chicken broth and heavy cream and it didn't need any thickening.

I made this recipe with what I had in my kitchen, which means I used frozen corn, milk, chicken stock and cilantro. Despite all those modifications, it was still very good, although a little thin (my fault for substituting milk for cream I suppose). It was absolutely beautiful too, and filling enough to serve as a main dish. Next time, I'll probably puree some of the potatoes before I add the other vegetables to compensate for the milk/cream substitution, because I don't really like fatty soups.

Great summer recipe. My 11 year old daughter asks for it all year long. I only make it in the summer. I buy my vege's at the local farmers market, roast them on the barbecue, then make the soup. Absolutely beyond description. Can't wait for fresh corn season!!!

This was a great recipe! The suggestion to use 3 cups of broth instead of 5 was right on. We used 1 cup of 1% milk instead of the half and half. We added chopped celery when we put in the corn and peppers, but we should have put it in with the potatoes as it was still a little crunchy. We pureed most of it and added a little cornstarch to thicken it up further. All in all, we would definitely make this soup again.

Sooo delicious! I added a few slices of bacon and fried them with the onions for added flavour. I also added 2 cups of 1% milk and 3 cups of broth (instead of the half and half), and pureed about 1/2 the pot for a thicker texture. Definitely use fresh corn right off the cob.

Another winner from Sheila Lukins. I didn't have time to make the vegetable broth, so used chicken broth instead, otherwise followed the recipe. We loved this. Today (since I have the ingredients)I'll make the veggie broth for future use.

Great, easy soup recipe! I only needed 3 cups of broth instead of five, but I like really thick soup. I pureed about 1/3 of it to make it thicker and it came out great!

I used a home-made non-fat chicken broth with mine. I used 2% milk instead of half-and-half. Added a ittle cornstarch to make up for it, as thickener. I used fresh corn off the cob. It was very good, stayed well in the fridge for a few days. Especially good for summer and for those watching fat grams.

A VERY WHOLESOME CORN CHOWDER. I PUREED IT AT THE END & IT WAS MUCH THICKER THIS WAY.

Pretty tasty version. I used a good quality premade veg stock to save time. Thought it tasted great. I also used the cilantro instead of the basil. Fresh cilantro was definitely key to bring out the "summer" flavors in this recipe.

This was a great recipe, simple, and straigh forward. I would suggest it to anyone looking for a quick easy meal that was impressive at the same time

This is a great basic corn chowder recipe. I partially blended the potato/broth base to make the soup a little bit thicker. Instead of basil, which is what the recipe I think calls for, I added some fresh cilantro and dill to make the soup taste a little more "fresh."
