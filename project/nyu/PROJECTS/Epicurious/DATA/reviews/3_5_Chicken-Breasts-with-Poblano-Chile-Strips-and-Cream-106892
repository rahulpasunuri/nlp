Simple and delicious. Eating this recipe was like floating through clouds of deliciousness. Or something. We added mushrooms and the recipe was absolutely amazing. Will make again, for sure.

One more thing- do NOT rinse the chiles- it completely eliminates the spiciness, and poblanos are not actually that spicy in the US. I don't know what the difference is, especially since they often come from Mexico anyway, but I have yet to get a truly spicy poblano (or serrano, or jalapeno!), so there is really no need to rinse them- it eliminates the flavor that makes them wonderful! Just make sure to devein and deseed them really well, that gets rid of most of the spiciness also.

Wow! That was wonderful. Very simple too. I served it over rice instead of with tortillas. I did make a few changes (all fairly common to Mexican variations of rajas). I sauteed some sliced mushrooms first, then added them to the rajas at the end, along with some corn. This added a wonderful depth to the rajas. I also ended up increasing the cream because of the increase in ingredients. I used half sour cream, half whipping cream. My husband absolutely loved it! A definite keeper in my kitchen.

This is excellent! I made it a pasta dish by cutting the chicken into bite sized pieces. Sauted 2 cups sliced mushrooms (any kind) and then tossed everything in with cooked penne pasta. I used about 1/3 cup whipping cream instead of the sour Cream. You may need to thin the sauce with some chicken broth. It's a complete meal...veggies, protein and carbs!

I've made this dish three times now and it's a favorite in our house. I do a few things different - I pound the chicken breasts so they cook faster, and once they're done (I just undercook them), I put them in the warm oven and cook the onions and peppers in the same skillet to take advantage of all the good leftover chicken fond. I add a half-cup of the creme fraiche and cook for a few minutes, then slice the chicken and add it until it's all hot. I also add a good teaspoon of ground white pepper, and a fair amount of sea salt. Served over rice, it's a great meal!

I really liked this recipe although I did make the changes suggested by the previous reviewer. I added some corn kernels, and used 1/4 cup heavy cream + 1/4 cup chicken broth instead of the sour cream. I also added a sliced red bell pepper and sauteed that with the onion. Served it over brown rice. Lovely flavors, especially with the added corn.

good recipe... I do have a suggestion though (since my mom used to cook this dish since I was little ) instead of sour cream- use fresh cream- or crema fresca, use half that and milk =better texture...and if you add corn kernels...yuuuummmmmm! cream/poblanos/corn really go well together !

Loved the dish. We served it over a bed of rice and enjoyed a white wine spritzer. We ended up adding more sour cream than called for. The next time I'm going to use a half cup of chicken broth so that I don't have to add so much dairy. We aslo will roast the poblanos for longer than instructed so that the skins peel off more easily.

This was a perfectly good dish for a lazy Saturday night. I had a couple left-over poblanos I needed to use. I followed the recipe exactly but at the end the sauce seemed to need more cream. I ended up using about 1/2 a cup total. With a salad and some garlic bread it was a nice little meal.

We really enjoyed this recipe. When making it though, I did make some changes. I baked four pieces of chicken, seasoned with some salt, pepper and a little garlic powder. I roasted the peppers, peeled and seeded them, but did not rinse them. I sauted the onions, added the peppers and then I used a full cup of sour cream and a little whipping cream to thin the sauce, then poured it over the baked chicken pieces. Everyone loved the recipe and it will be made again.

I have now made this dish 3 times... the first time, I'm not sure if it was the peppers or if I didn't rinse them, but it was blazin' hot! The second time, it turned out pretty blah. I tried it again last night, cutting the chicken into strips and throwing it into the sauce and serving it all over rice. DELICIOUS!! My husband took the leftovers to work and had coworkers as for the recipe just from the smell!

Very tasty. I sauteed the onion, added the chile strips and then pureed with a little bit of chicken broth. I reheated the mixture and added the cream until hot. My husband and I both loved it.

Quick, easy and delicious. It could use a little kick - of what, I don't know. Anyone have any suggestions? I'll make it again.

Disappointing. I used creme fraiche rather than sour cream based on the comments, I don't think either would make a difference. I found this...well, dull, which is a shame as I love the individual components.

I cooked it by the book, wife loved it but I didn't. I used the sour creme, the fraiche would have been better I'm sure.

This is a very nice recipe. More for dinner with my boyfriend than for guests. I also deglazed the pan I cooked the chicken in, I used vermouth, white wine would also be delish. Although I didn't like the sour cream flavor, next time i will certainly use creme Fraiche or heavy cream.

I also say excellent! Once you roast the chilies, it is so easy and quick with wonderful flavor. I substituted the creme fraiche with fat-free half and half because I had it on hand and the overall flavor was still wonderful. Next time I may use more onions. I served this with Spanish rice and a Chopped Southwestern salad. It was too much food but and excellent menu.

Excellent!! I deglazed the pan I cooked the chicken in with some white wine and finished the sauce in that pan! Superb, simple and elegant!!
