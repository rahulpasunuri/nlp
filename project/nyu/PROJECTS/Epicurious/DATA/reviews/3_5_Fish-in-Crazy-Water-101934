I adore this entree! I made it the other night using Marcella Hazan's recipe featured in food & wine mag. Hers calls for water, not wine (I'd like to try that at a later date), and to reduce the sauce before adding in the fish. It was beautiful, flavorful, and so healthy too. I used red snapper fillets which had perfect texture and taste. I will definitely make it again. It is a perfect dish for a summer evening with white wine.

I made this tonight following the recipe almost exactly and we loved it! I used cilantro instead of parsley (because that's what I had on hand), added a chicken bullion cube to the 2 cups of water, and cut down the oil to 1 T and also used 1 T of butter. This was my first time cooking a whole fish and the only thing I disliked was that the scales came off the fish while it was cooking. I'm not sure if I was supposed to removed them prior to cooking? Anyway I removed the fish and tomatoes, reduced the sauce and then strained it before adding the last of the cilantro.

When I found fresh, whole red snappers at the Dallas TX farmers market, I went looking for recipes that sounded scrumptious. I read a number of recipes for "fish in crazy water." I combined some ngredients and techniques from several. (I noticed some recipes call for reducing sauce ingredients, then cooking fish in the reduction; others call for cooking the fish in the "crazy water," then setting the fish aside while the sauce reduces. I tried the first method, so the sauce and the fish would be done at the same time. From other recipes, I also got the idea of substituting low-sodium chicken broth for half the water, mashing up a few anchovy fillets in the broth, adding some chopped sun-dried tomatoes, and adding some capers right before I put in the fish. It came out FABULOUS. My husband loved it. The only thing is, I thought the delicious sauce was so assertive I didn't really taste that expensive fish. I will definitely be making fish in crazy water (pesce all' acqua pazza) again, but I will use a less-expensive fish when I do.

Needed a receipe without too many ingredients as we were at a vacation condo. Had a whole fresh red snapper and thought this was GREAT. Only variation we did was to reduce the olive oil to about 3 T. Served over pasta. Will do this again and again. I think the whole fish prep contributes to the better sauce. You lose alot of flavor when you only use filets although probably is easier.

I used halibut filets, made the sauce with one cup fish stock and two cups wine, and served it over riso pasta. The fish and sauce were bland and were only saved when I sprinkled some Tony Cachere's seasoning on the finished dish. Otherwise, the tomatoes were the only flavorful thing in the whole dish.

Made this with halibut filets for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a great hit -- also looked very Christmas-y with the red cherry tomatoes and all that parsley. I skipped the water and used all white wine -- the sauce was splendid. Served it with mashed potatoes and green and white asparagus.

This recipe is straight from heaven! I had reservations about it at first, but I followed it to a T and I thought I was a gourmet when I was done! Really marvelous.

After the admonitions of the chef from Northampton, I made this just as the recipe says. We tossed it with gnocchi, my husband raved and called it a keeper. It was really simple and tasted great. We served with a really nice italian white and will do it again.

I had high hopes after reading all of the great reviews of this recipe. I sauteed shallots with the garlic and substituted one cup of fish stock for one of the cups of water. I was not impressed with it -- I found the overall taste of the sauce to a bit greasy and lacking flavor. Even my husband, who likes almost everything I prepare, remarked that I should toss this recipe. Maybe there is too much white wine or too much parsley, I don't know. I won't be making this dish again.

Oh my... what a fabulous recipe. It's quick, it's healthy, it's flavorful, it's colorful. My husband begged me to make it again. So, I did... the next night. I made a couple of small changes though. Instead of the whole fish, I used Halibut filets. They cooked through much quicker. And instead of water I used 1 cup of chicken broth and 1 cup of clam juice. I didn't reduce it all the way down to a cup, as they suggest, because it was getting awfully salty. Then the first night I served it over toasted bread (as someone else reviewing this recipe suggested). The next night, I used Orecchiette pasta instead. Two nights in a row a keeper of a recipe.

A-plus! Purists unite, and don't listen to those adulterators who don't know how to follow a traditional recipe. This was fantastic and simple. The only changes I made were that I used striped bass fillets (one pound) and added a few red pepper flakes. I served it in bowls with two slices of oven-toasted baguette brushed first with olive oil (which is how it is served at ESCA in NY.) No fiddling or substitutions necessary. Reduce the sauce as directed (truthfully, I reduced it to about 1 1/2 cups) and it's absolutely delicious. Salt it well enough. Good enough for company and a beautiful presentation.

In my humble opinion. After reading all of the fantastic reviews of this recipe, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it left me feeling flat. Not only was the fish expensive, but I found the overall taste of the sauce to be one-dimensional. Perhaps the substitution of broth instead of plain water may of helped. This dished smacked of over-zealleous itallian cuisine. Too much white wine, and too much itallian parsley. I think if I were to make this dish again, I would add a touch more butter and possibly some saffron threads for a rounder more complex flavour. Definately a good base, that anyone can improve on.

I stumbled across this recipe in my Gourmet archives a few weeks ago.. The first time I made it, I used thick Halibut Filets, one and a half pounds of fresh large tomatoes, large clove of elephant garlic, cilantro instead of parsley, I didn't reduce the broth after it had simmered, and omitted the white wine... the result was still fabulous... Next time, instead of fish, I tried it with super-jumbo shrimp... again, it came out fantastic... then I tried it with boneless, skinless chicken thighs... again it was a hit. Finally, I just made the plain broth itself... my family is hooked. I definitely reccommend increasing the quantity of broth. I like to just have a cup of the broth for lunch, or if I want a light dinner, so I skip all the bread & fish/etc. This is a very versatile base recipe!

Very flavorful & a big hit with my husband. Instead of a whole fish i used snapper fillets & it was great. I recommend it highly.

A 3.1 actually. I was not disappointed but I was not overly excited either. It is a solid dish with aromatic flavors, easy to make, healthy tasting and extremely modifiable.

I substituted chicken broth for the water and the sauce had a great flavor. A winner.

The second time I made this dish, I used salmon and I added diced mushroom, carrot and celery. Also, I omitted the water and added more wine. I also used garlic, onion, oregano and cilantro to enhance the flavor. The reduced sauce was more flavorful! You can serve this dish on a bed of rice or pasta to complete the meal.

Is it, perhaps, time to credit Paul LoDuca with the popularization of this recipe? Or, could he be persuaded to divulge his source(s)?

Quick, easy and flavorful. I used fish steaks instead of the whole fish and it worked out just fine.
