Honestly, I have no idea what happened, but the batter for this recipe came out quite thin and the flavor was not good. I was able to thicken to compensate, but still, I was totally unimpressed. Wanted to like this. In theory...

Deliciously nutty with a crisp texture. I substituted whole wheat pastry flour and old-fashioned oats. I clabbered whole milk with two teaspoons apple cider vinegar rather than using buttermilk. I substituted a tablespoon light brown sugar for the molasses as others suggested. The batter was too thin so I added 1/2 c. all purpose flour.

Many fond memories of Rick and Ann's in Berkeley! The recipe didn't disappoint! Yum. Light and crisp. Even my 5 year old liked these. The only change I made was to substitute maple syrup for the molasses and rolled oats for the quick cooking oats. I only had full-flavored molasses and I was worried it would overwhelm all the other flavors. Will definitely make again.

This will be my basic pancake recipe from now on, we loved it. Unfortunately, I didn't have any molasses so, I added vanilla. In the future I'll try adding some flax seeds and maybe a heartier whole grain four. I normally only have blackstrap molasses in the pantry which would be too strong, maybe that's what the other reviewer used. Just a thought.....

Great flavor. Used the recipe for waffles. Added cinnamon, vanilla, and chopped walnuts and ground the oatmeal in a spice grinder.

Great whole grain pancakes, nice and light but with texture. My new favorite!

These. Are. Awesome. Try it with blueberries.

I made waffles with this recipe and they were great. I used Salba and water in place of one egg. I also added a 5 grain cereal in place of the oats. The kids loved them and I will definitely make them again.

These were good, but I prefer the Whole-Wheat Oatmeal recipe from Gourmet's Feb '08 issue. The molasses flavor was overpowering and made them too sweet, so next time I will use half as much. Added some cinnamon, and I used old-fashioned oats which worked well, since I soaked them in the buttermilk while I mixed the other ingredients.

Am making a few gift jars with this recipe. My family members and I like whole grain healthy foods. I am including Vermont dark amber maple syrup with the jar. Have made this twice- the first time took the chill off the liquid ingredients in the micro. 2nd time didn't. I noticed a difference in the look of the batter. 1st time fluffy, bubbly and 2nd time not as much. Also 2nd time tried using 2 tbls. canola oil instead of butter (anything to simplify it a bit for friends/family) Only difference in taste to my husband and I was less crunch. I'm sticking with butter. I changed recipe to make it easier to make - by adding 2 tbls. brown sugar in the dry ingredients and excluding molasses.

I prep the dry and wet ingredients separately on Friday nights and make them on Saturday mornings. Instead of cornmeal I use flaxmeal and I use old-fashioned oats. They definitely need some vanilla and nutmeg and one large shredded apple makes them extra tasty.

I used all wheat flour and added some flax and ground walnuts I also ground the oatmeal before adding it. If you like wheat breads and "hearty/healthy" flavors then you will like this. The nuts, cornmeal and oatmeal gave a great texture and crunch. Mine were thick and fluffy, if you had problems with this you may want to check the expiration date on your baking powder.

We thought the taste of these pancakes was very good, but they were so flat. Like a thick crepe. I don't know if I did anything wrong. I'm definitely going to try these again and see if they're fluffier. Maybe I'll try some of the other ideas from the other reviews. And if they are flat with everyone else, does anyone know how to make them fluff up??

Now my favorite pancake recipe. Was afraid that the molasses flavor would be too strong, but it wasn't - hardly noticeable at all; just added some depth of flavor.

Hearty, awesome pancakes... made 'em for my parents after they helped set up my apartment, and they loved 'em. Add a little nutmeg and vanilla; they're perfect then.

Make these now. They are awesome with chocolate chips!

These were a big hit at our Sunday breakfast table! Like a few other reviewers, I also substituted brown sugar for the molasses, as all I had on had was dark and I worried that the flavor might be overpowering. I found them to be not at all heavy, just flavorful and satisfying--we'll be making them again soon.

These are very good pancakes (even my 3 and 7 year olds enjoy them). Two of my sisters have said these are the best pancakes they have ever had and that they are a nice alternative to just old white flour pancakes. I substitue Red River cereal (or Sonny Boy)in place of the cornmeal and soak it in the buttermilk from the start. I subsitute brown sugar or maple syrup for the molassess. Very good!

Excellent pancakes! The grains give them an great texture, but they are still light. I didn't have molasses so just sweetened them with berries and maple syrup once they were served, but the lack of sweetness in the pancake didn't mean a lack of flavour. Also had to use 1/2 milk and 1/2 yogurt for buttermilk. Finally, i added some sunflower seeds which are wonderful for flavour and crunch. A fantastic, non-junky breakfast pancake.

Rating: 3
These are delish! But I say this with 1 caveat: you must enjoy whole-wheaty because, man, are these hearty! It's nice to have some different breakfast options that I can feel good about making/eating, and which actually taste good. The only change I made was to replace some of the molasses I had w/brown sugar (I only had dark mol. & find the flavor overpowering @ times). I'll definitely make these again!

Easy to make, hearty, and satsifying. I only had dark molasses, so I used half molasses and half sugar. I also substituted canola oil for half the butter.

These pancakes were supurb. Easy, delicious, nutritious. How could I ever go back to my favorite basic buttermilk pancakes again? Even though the cornmeal in these gave them a bit more texture, they were still light and fluffy. Divine. A keeper.

I used to live down the street from Rick & Ann's--these are amazing pancakes! So much better tasting than traditional pancakes--a much fuller flavor, sweet and slightly nutty, and they don't sit in your stomach like a brick. I just got a Bonjour laser surface thermometer, and that helps a *lot* with regulating the temp on a griddle pan (ideal is ~325 F). And Trader Joe's Grade B maple syrup rocks with this! This recipe makes about 6 Rick & Ann's size pancakes (ie, 7-8 inches). Don't skip the molasses!

We've made this recipe often in our home and love it. If you're used to white flour pancakes it takes about 4 bites to really appreciate this version but after that, you'll be hooked! They taste GREAT and that yucky "carbo crash" you used to get after the refined bisquick version is all but nonexistent with this recipe. Yum!

Just made these this morning, and have to say they were delicious, with a sweet cornmeal crunch. A nice alternative to light, fluffy buttermilk pancakes. Still relatively light, for something with so much fiber... I kept them a bit lower fat by using only pan spray instead of the 2 T of butter they suggest for the griddle. Very good with pure maple syrup.

These are a wonderful whole grain pancake although I did make a few changes. I'm not partial to the flavor of molasses so I used honey. I also omitted the oats and put more cornmeal and whole wheat flour. I also use non-fat yogurt and 1% milk in place of the buttermilk. I cook a lot and have found these substitutions work well. I added blueberries and nuts. What are pancakes without additions? While I know my kids like the IHOP white flour pancake, they love this healthier version as well.

My family loves this recipe! I use whole grain flour (no white), add a touch of vanilla and add frozen blueberries and pieces of sliced bananas to the top of the pancakes in the pan (make sure you pat fruit down and cover with a little batter). Incredible and sooooo healthy. I make a double batch and freeze them for quick breakfasts during the week.

Rating: 3
Really really good. I used whole wheat flour (1 cup) in place of the oats and cornmeal - and added blueberries. One tip if you're adding blueberries (fresh or frozen) - place them on top of the pancakes after they're in the pan (on the uncooked side)- works better. Very light and the molasses gives good flavour.

Yummers!! Everyone in my house gobbled these up. They are deceiving....they look heavy coming off the griddle but in your mouth....light, tender, mmmmmmmmmm. One suggestion, and maybe a little odd at that. Next time I would nuke my buttermilk for a minute to take the cold edge off before mixing it with the other wet ingredients. I found the melted butter and the molasses hardened with the cold buttermilk, not allowing me to get the smoothest batter possible.

Anything that is somewhat healthly and can absorb a goodly amount of maple syrup gets my two thumbs up!!

I substituted the all purpose flour with wheat germ and honey for the molasses and used spray instead of butter to cook. They were light and airy and so Healthy!! I loved the slight crunch of the cornmeal and the honey reminded me of corn bread. will definitely make again.

Just right with that amount of molasses: not too sweet. Good texture too, from the cornmeal and oats. The batter can be mixed the night before, and refrigerated. Powdered buttermilk works well.

I admit to altering the recipe somewhat. I deleted the molasses so I could use some of the massive amount of maple-walnut butter I had left over from making Marcel DeSaulnier's chocolate walnut coffee cake. I just substituted 4 tbsps of maple-walnut butter for the 4 tbsp of regular butter called for here. They were good, but not terriffic, which I admit may be my own fault. I might like them better with chopped walnuts...Maybe I'm weird, but I like nuts in my pancakes.

I thought these were the best pancakces I've ever had, but my husband thought the molasses flavor was too sweet sharp and pronounced, so if I were to make them again, I would have to reduce the molasses to 1 tblsp... probably won't make again unless he comes 'round to molasses though.

It's a toss up for best pancakes between these and the Oatmeal-Buttermilk Pancakes on this site. Let the batter sit over night with the buttermilk ... divine. I added some cinnamon and served with fresh fruit and syrup, too. Way better than bacon and eggs for breakfast..........

I used oat bran and additional wheat flour in replace of the cornmeal, along with soy milk in replace of the buttermilk . When I make this again, I will use cornmeal for the added texture. I also added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon for added flavor. I served up the pancakes with syrup and fresh strawberries. My other half totally loves these pancakes and found the leftovers in the freezer the next day to have some more.

I wanted to increase the grains in our diet, so decided to try this. It was OK. Maybe I am not used to this taste, but it tasted like bread to me. Like honey whole wheat bread, which is good. I had to use a lot of maple syrup. Maybe next time I'll put some blueberries or bananas in it.

These pancakes were interesting. They certainly had substance and texture with the oatmeal and cornmeal. I wanted to try them because of the high marks other reviewers gave but I won't make again. I prefer a light, cakey pancake. My favorite recipe is the IHOP version found at topsecretrecipes.com

These were both hearty and tasty. You can blend the dry ingredients on Saturday and whip up the rest on Sunday morning. Use maple leaf molds from Williams-Sonoma to really do it up right, and just add the true syrup from Vermont....

Both hearty and flavoriful! These are the best pancakes I have ever tasted and I personally do not like pancakes. At first I made them for my husband, he and I liked them so much I volunteered to make them for a family Sunday brunch. Everyone there loved them too! A real keeper!
