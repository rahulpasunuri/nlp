What a nice way to use our home-grown Asian pears! I, too, used only 1/2 cup of maple syrup and substituted candied ginger for the fresh as that's what I had. A light, refreshing dessert worthy of company. And easy to make.

The flavors worked really well (especially if you do find asian pears) and this was quite quick and easy. I also recommend vanilla ice cream to add a bit of richness, otherwise it is a very light desert (which some may prefer). Also, the sauce was very watery, perhaps consider thickening it on the heat.

Excellent!!! Served this at a small Oscar night party - I didn't have crystallized ginger, and forgot to bring the mint - no loss of WOW factor st all. Used half the maple syrup, as suggested, and embellished the dish with pomegranate seeds.

Very good but I only used half the maple syrup as I thought 1 whole cup would make it too sweet. 1/2 cup was plenty sweet. I did not use brandy either. Syrup was well balanced and very gingery which I loved. It is 'nashi' (Asian pears) season here in Tokyo and I'll be making this recipe often.

Don't use Scotch. (I will make this again, but with brandy or possibly bourbon!)

Fantastic. Couldn't get asian pears so I used bosc and served to my dinner group. It was a huge hit!

I'm rating the syrup, which is delicious. Instead of serving it with sliced pears, I poached the pears in white wine and sugar with some Chinese 5 spice powder, a cinnamon stick, a vanilla bean and a chunk of ginger. Fantastic with vanilla ice cream.

This has become a favorite dessert for my family and friends! The ginger-maple flavor is a perfect match with the pears. Perfect with vanilla ice cream.
