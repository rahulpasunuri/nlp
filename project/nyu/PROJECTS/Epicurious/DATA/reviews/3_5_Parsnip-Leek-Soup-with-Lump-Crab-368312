This definitely needed more stock and I added Almond Milk to save on calories. This ended up being too sweet and parsnip-y for me. I wanted so bad to like it, but won't make it again.

I also added more broth, but that was the only tweak I made. Very delicious and very satisfying soup!

This came out great, eventually; I made it as a formal first course and all my guests loved it. It did however seem to make almost twice as much soup as I expected - it needed a LOT more broth to get it to the right consistency. A blender or simple food processor will do the trick for a rustic texture, but use a super fine food mill if you are looking for a really smooth and sophisticated consistency. I will make this again.
