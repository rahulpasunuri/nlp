Good, but I would try to cut the bread as small as possible in the future.

i hate to rain on the love parade, but i found this stuffing incredibly bland. i followed the recipe except for using a little less butter, dried sage instead of fresh, and thyme instead of marjoram, and added some chopped carrots--really minor modifications. i think the culprit is the ciabatta bread, which is so porous and light and crusty and flavorless itself it ust doesn't take on much flavor from the other ingredients. plus the cubes were too large and a bit unwieldy to eat. a boxed mix like mrs. cubbison's beats this recipe, and i am NOT a fan of packaged foods! i'd use a bread that's richer and denser and add more herbs, for a start...

I have been trying to make my grandmothers stuffing for years with the recipe and it never turns out as good as I can remember. This recipe is it!!! I used homemade turkey broth using turkey wings and that may have made the difference. Also used plain ciabatta bread. I added a total of 2 1/2 C broth and then drizzed an additional 2 T on top before baking.

I finally found a stuffing recipe that the whole family liked. I think this will be our go-to for the foreseeable future. I added about 3/4 cup of chopped toasted pecans and found that the recipe needed about an additional cup of chicken broth, but other than that I made it exactly as written. I might follow the suggestion of another reviewer and double the herbs next year, but it was really good as is.

I made one half of this recipe as written and cooked it in an 8 X 8 glass baking pan. Everyone liked it but would have preferred the bread cut smaller. I also made one half of this recipe GFCF with Udi's gluten free bread and Vegetable oil instead of butter. It was very good and people said it was had to tell the difference between the two.

This was good (not excellent), but a bit dry and probably needed more herbs. I think it's a good place to start and would be better with some additions like apples, mushrooms, etc.

Last year I made this stuffing/dressing and it was probably only 2.5 to 3 forks because it was dry. So, this year I made the following changes. Doubled the recipe, but tripled the number of eggs and amount of broth (used vegetable broth for vegetarians) and almost tripled the amount of herbs. Covered the pan for the first part of the baking process (about 10 minutes), and then uncovered to finish. The result was wonderful. The stuffing was very flavorful, and moist. Everyone raved about it.

The best stuffing recipe I've made! I used ciabatta, which I toasted 2 days before Thanksgiving. Combined with the other do-ahead tip, this required almost no prep time the day of the meal. It did need more broth than stated - about 2 cups total. It kept well in the oven's warming drawer until served.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was absolutely great. I did make some changes: cut the bread in much smaller pieces; used vegetable stock; used a lot more stock (probably 1.5 to 2 cups total); and doubled the herbs.

Fabulous flavor. I also used leftover ciabatta bread. I cut the recipe in half, but next time I will prepare the full amount of egg mixture to help make it a bit more moist. I will definitely make again.

Delicious stuffing! I made it once with vegetable broth for my vegetarian friends and it was wonderful that way too.

Just okay. I thought the flavor was a little bland, but the texture was good.

This was delicious! I used ciabatta and made it exactly as written. Next time, I will cut the bread slightly smaller, use about half as much salt and I will use a little more broth. The herbs were perfect. I have been looking for a great stuffing recipe and I think I have found it!
