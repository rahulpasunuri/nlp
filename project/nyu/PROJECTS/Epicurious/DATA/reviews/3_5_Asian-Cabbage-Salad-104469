Am I the only one wondering at 21,5 Lbs of cabbage? Or is it 2.5Lbs - that would not make 25 cups of shredded cabbage. Help!

This is why I LOVE Epi: There is this truly great cook (rjordan) and she posted this dynamite dressing recipe: Peanut Lime Vinaigrette. I added hers with this and OMG! You MUST try them both together. As she puts it"...It will make you cry" it's that good. Thanks EPI and rjordon for teaching me deliciously.

I used napa cabbage and a little extra drizzle of the sesame oil. Just before I served it I tossed it with about 2 tBs toasted sesame seeds and 2 sliced green onions. Yummy!

I get the prize for bastardizing this recipe the most. (Halved the recipe.) I didn't have rice wine vinegar like I thought I did, so used (gasp) white balsamic, but only 2/3 cup, and went heavier on the sesame oil, then added a dash of sugar and about 1 tsp of General Tso's Stir Fry Sauce. Chopped up green part of green onion (celantro hates me) and added bean sprouts, chopped Clementine orange slices, salt & pepper and sesame seeds. I would go easy on the bean sprouts next time, but this isn't half bad!

This salad was quick, easy, and delicious--especially when I used a bag of coleslaw mix. I followed the advice of others and added sesame seeds. I also added bean sprouts to it, and I topped it with chow mein noodles. I will definitely be making this one again.

Good base recipe. Threw in sesame seeds and grated carrot and would have put in some ramen noodles if I had them. Cut recipe in half and it served 3 generous portions, with enough leftovers for all. Had spicy grilled shrimp over the top.

Great salad, added toasted sesames to it. Bought coleslaw bagged cabbage to save time. Goes great with "glazed grilled salmon". You can make both of these in under thirty minutes. A quick healthy dinner.

My Hawaiian niece-in-law brings a version of this salad at least twice a year to family gatherings. The best part of it is the crunchy (as in "raw!") ramen noodles and slivered almonds (doesn't sound gross to me at all, as a previous reviewer thought). Guess I'll have to (gasp!) ask her for her recipe, cuz I'm not finding it here. If I promise not to bring it to a family do, maybe she'll give it to me!

A winner, It will be a favorite in my kitchen...I love the recipe and it has wonderful flavor, I think next time to add a little bite, I might add some toasted seasame seeds.... this is perfect for low carbing.

Very easy & healthy. I added some sugar in the raw & diced jalepenos and enjoyed it. Even my husband who doesn't like salads had secnds.

I substituted parsley for cilantro and added a bit of red cabbage. This was simple to make, delicious and colorful. Served it with the pineapple salmon.

Really quite delicious and attractive. DO add cilantro like others have suggested because it really enhances the flavor mixture. Yummy!

Although this is probably a fine salad as is, I combined several Asian-type recipes I found here(I can never seem to follow just one recipe at a time!) and came up with a real winner. I started here, so I am reviewing this one. In addition to the above, I added: 1 T minced fresh ginger, 1 shredded carrot, 1 julienned red pepper, 1 T Thai fish sauce, and some toasted sliced almonds. I can't believe how good it is.

Incredible flavor...easy too! Check out the delicious Shrimp Fried Rice from this site also.It blows away any restaurant fried rice.

This was the perfect accompaniment to a spicy Chinese noodle dish. Very easy to make and quite tasty. I'll keep this one in my repertoire.

This is an excellent recipe; easy to make, delicious and it stands up to experimentation and fudging. I paired it with the glazed grilled salmon from Bon Appetit (not the original pineapple marinated salad suggested as a main course), and it won rave reviews from my guests. It also holds well as leftovers.

Wonderful recipe. Great w/ BBQ, oriental style salmon or almost any meal.

try variations of this and the Chinese Cabbage Salad, w/ a bit of soy and sugar.

I was looking for a simple dish to use up a head of cabbage and found this great one. Since I've tred it (using some of the previous suggestions like chopped nuts(I used mixed because they were on hand),sesame seeds and more cilantro, I can see that there are lots of good ideas for variations. As is it's a great low fat dish to pair with Chinese pork tenderloin from the grill and stir-fried veggie lo mein. My husband must have eaten 6 servings by himself. Should also be a big pot luck hit this summer!

I have made a version of this salad, it didn't call for the oil or the vinager. Instead I used italian dressing and peperoncini salad pepers. It gets rave reviews from family and friends. Try it it is really good

We make this regularly, with some additions: scallions, ginger, red pepper flakes or minced jalapeno, white pepper, CHOPPED PEANUTS, and a little soy sauce. We also enjoy a creamy version made with chunky peanut butter mixed with a little mayo (heat it on the stove a bit to get the peanut butter to melt, add water as necessary to proper consistency). The creamy version is the slaw used at Bandera.

I would like to get a recipe like this that uses cabbage so that I can get three reluctant kids to eat this amazingly healthy vegetable. I'm not sure about the lack of other ingredients like soya sauce? Cleveland: could you also send me your recipe?

What's all that stuff in the picture? Is the recipe wrong?

I haven't tried this recipe,but a few years ago, Chili Pepper Magazine had a similar recipe. It was cabbage, thinly sliced red onion, cilantro, and chopped seeded jalepeno,with the seasoned rice vinegar. It was delicious!

I have been trying to create an ultimate Asian slaw, fashioned after one sold at Wild Oats deli, but have had only limited success. Cleveland, if you would be so kind, please send me your cabbage salad recipe to try. Thanks!

I have a wonderful cabbage salad that I wanted to compare this to. No comparison. Albany, you gave me a good chuckle. Thanks!

Blah!! I would rather have minced green onions, sesame oil and something crunchy to make it interesting. Maybe even sunflower seeds.

Too boring, added some smoked salmon, carrot matchsticks, bean sprouts. Add a little sugar to the rice vinegar.

I've made a similar salad and added a little palm sugar to give it less of a sour taste. I prefer a sour and spicy thai salad over this any day!

a bit boring. Some toasted sesame seeds helped.

Haven't made this exact recipe, but another one like it. Here are some variations - add sesame seeds for a nuttier flavor, and you can also add raw, crunchy ramen noodles (I know it sounds gross, but it's pretty yummy!).

Great salad! Just needs a few varations. . . chicken, other veggies like carrots, celery, or snow peas. Even nuts!
