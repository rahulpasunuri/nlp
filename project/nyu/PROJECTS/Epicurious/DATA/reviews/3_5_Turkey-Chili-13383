Twisted it up a bit, per usual. Instead of kidney beans, which i do not like, i used chikpeas. Instead of 2 green peppers, i used one red pepper. And I used 2 28oz cans of plum tomatoes and 1 can 28oz can of tomato puree. Also, i added some nutmeg, fresh ginger diced finely, and cocoa powder. The chili was amazing and a little spicy, it had this like moroccan flair to it, very rich and didn't taste like a typical chili. Very good!

made a few slight variations. Used ground lean turkey and browned it with onions and garlic. Used 2 796ml stewed tomatoes, one 796ml diced tomatoes, one can tomato paste, one chili pepper, 3 tbsp of cumin, 2 tbsp cayenne, 5 grinds of pepper, 2 grinds of salt, 3/4c beef broth, one can of chick peas, black peas, kidney beans and a pinch of oregano! So maybe i altered it more than I thought. LOL Then added mushrooms and a pepper at the 40min remaining mark of simmering. Yumm.

This is the first time I read the other reviews and was surprised at the comments and variations. I make it just about exactly as written every year using Thanksgiving drumsticks and wings -- it is so good. I tend to use whatever cans of tomatoes I have on hand, usually a 24 oz can of crushed tomatoes with puree, and three 10 oz cans of petite diced tomatoes. I let it cook down slowly with the turkey parts for several hours, at least three, then add the beans but only one bell pepper (after I remove the bones) and cook it some more....yum- o. Its pretty spicy, thick, and very tasty, especially with sour cream and cheese. This is not something to just whip up, it takes hours, but worth the wait.

This recipe is a staple in my home. We freeze the leftovers to keep on hand to have a healthy easy dinner.

So here are my suggestions should you venture off the beaten path.... lean ground turkey (about 1.3 lbs), use only 1 35 oz can of diced organic tomatoes instead of 2, 1 can of rinsed chickpeas and 1 can of red kidney beans, 2 zucchini and modify the spices to your own tastes. I used garlic powder and toned down the cinnamon. It got pretty thick so I added a cup of organic chick stock and let it cook down again. A few dashes of hot sauce and voila. You could really throw any veggies/beans/etc and it would taste delicious - even healthier. I topped it with sour cream and diced avocado. Yum.

I still have the 1990 magazine featuring this recipe. For the person seeking someone who makes it just as written I have made it several Thanksgiving weekends with my carcasses. I love it and it makes enough to share with my neighbors. Linda in Charlotte

excellent taste, made it several times with 1.5 lb browned ground turkey. Definitely cut chili powder to 1tbs, and do add 1 tbs cocoa powder. Add spices after onion/garlic softened and stir for 1 minute, then add tomatoes and rest. I hope it keeps frozen for longer than 2 minutes? chuckles...

This was such a great way to use up the leftovers from my New Years day bird. I will definitely make this recipe again. I did not have kidney beans on hand and used black beans instead. Delicious!

Suggestion - make this with ground turkey instead of a whole turkey. Cook the turkey first, then following the recipe as directed.

Turned out great! Thought the reviews could use one from somebody who made it pretty much as written. Made it with one large can of yellow Roma tomatoes and one large can of whole red tomatoes; one packet of pasilla chile powder about 3/4 oz; and slightly less than one tbsp of red pepper flakes; one can of scarlet runner beans, one can of black beans, one can of kidney beans; two drumsticks two wings and one partial thigh from a 20 lb. turkey. More than enough meat in the chili, not soupy at all, the chili heat was just right for us, and the flavor was great. So easy and a really great way to use up the Christmas turkey!

I've made this several times and get rave reviews. The last time I mixed ground turkey with turkey sausage, and added lots of spice and it was incredible!!!! I love the texture of the mixed meats. Hearty & healthy!

I made this twice, both times with 1.5 lbs. ground turkey. I think the chili is a little different then what some people are used to when it comes to chili, hence the so-so reviews. However I think its a great chili especially for those who do not eat beef. It is a little on the sweet, tomato-ey side with just enough spice. Freezes well too.

Unfortunately we had a really bad experience with this recipe. It was more like soup than chili until we added massive amounts of flour and water. We like spicy food so emphasized the flavor-producing ingredients, and it was pretty uninspiring. Not to mention the stress of having people coming over for SuperBowl and having to improvise at the last minute given how watery it was.... wouldn't make it again.

Made this for a family I didn't know that doesn't eat beef or pork and has a diabetic member. They loved it! I used many of the suggestions written by other cooks: diced tomatoes, eased back slightly on the chili powder (but later realized the 1/4 cup is probably right. If it's tasted before the full cooking time has passed, then it does taste hot but it mellows a lot and is just right when the 2hrs 40mins has passed). As others did, I used 2lbs ground turkey, browned & drained it and added it with the beans. For beans I used 1 can black, 1 can white and it does make a great contrast with the redness of the dish. Also for that last 40 mins I added some frozen corn and 2 small cans chicken broth so there would be enough sauce.

threw a whole chopped jalapeno (with seeds) in with the onions and garlic, and put the ground turkey in with that before moving on; > replaced the peppers with two large, coarsely chopped carrots; > Used 15-oz cans of black, kidney and pinto beans; > threw in a couple of generous splashes of tequila with the tomato puree

Both times I've made this recipe it came out great. The spice combination is perfect. I skipped the turkey parts and instead browned a pound and a half of ground turkey in a separate pan and added it with the green peppers and kidney beans.

Really good chili, but I substituted the turkey parts for 1.5lbs of ground turkey and added Jalapeño peppers. I browned the turkey, drained the fat and then added all of the other ingrediants. Came out great.

Guess I'm the odd one out on this, but this was the worst chili I've ever made. Too sweet and not earthy enough. Also, I appreciate the reviews and hearing about substitutions/additions, but it seems like a lot of reviewers changed this into a different recipe entirely, then remarked on their own creations.

This is a wonderful recipe and I embraced many of the suggestions of others - use of crushed and diced tomatoes, adding both red and green peppers and an ounce of unsweetened chocolate. I took the last concept a bit further by using double chocolate stout in place of the 2 cups of water the recipe calls for. Some of the other ideas were less appealing - for instance I can hardly imagine adding corn to this, much less peas! I did add a couple of tablespoons of masa harina, to good effect, I think. Like many others I used turkey left overs for this, roughly cut in 1/2" pieces. I can see how cooking the turkey from scratch in the stewpot- as the recipe asks for - would make this even more flavorful. Oh yes, I found cans of beans at our local market that included a mix of black, pinto, and kidney. Perfect for this recipe. I was amused to see in the recipe that the chili "may be frozen for two minutes." After 15 years I should have thought someone else might have noted that!!!

Great chili. We used tomatoes from the garden, chopped and frozen. As they were orange, red, purple and green varieties, it livened up the look of the meal considerably.

this is a great recipe. I have made it numerous times and it is always a hit. The cinnamon adds such a nice rounded off flavor.I did exchange the turkey parts for ground turkey and added fresh roased corn.

The first time we made this recipe, we followed some of the advice of other reviewers... we used ground turkey, a red pepper instead of green, crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes, and cut the chili powder to 1 tbsp. The result? BORING chili, both visually (all red ingredients... looked like red mush) and taste wise. The second time we made it, we did the same as above, except we used a green pepper instead of red, added 2 jalepenos, corn, and 1 can of black beans. It is visually so much more appealing, and the taste is also much more dynamic. Will make this again!

Great chili recipe. One of my favorites off of this website. I have made this several times, but never rated it. I, like many others, prefer to add semi-sweet or unsweetened chocolate (1-2 oz)to my chili, and also 1/2 - 1 dark beer/ale by cutting back on the juices from the canned tomatoes. I made this once without changing a thing and thought that it was missing a bit. So, I use jalepeno's and serrano's instead of the chili flakes, one red and one green bell pepper, ground turkey, and a bit more garlic than what was called for. Wonderful, and of course better the next couple days as the flavors mingle together._

I liked this recipe a lot, might use more beans and chili called for and use ground turkey next time instead of cooked turkey. I found it somewhat acidic, it could have been the tomato puree I used so I fixed it by add baking soda.

We loved this chili. I cheated and used already cooked turkey out of the freezer. Everything except the beans went in the crock pot all day. When we got home I just threw in the canned beans and waited for it to heat up.

Excellent, excellent recipe that I will definitely make again. Also did tweaking -- unable to buy ground turkey in Germany so used combo of light and dark turkey meat sauteed with onions. Put only half the chili powder in and as red pepper flakes also not available here, cut up 6 small dried chili peppers. My guests went back for seconds and thirds.

I've made this recipe several times, tweaking here or there--and it's never, ever disappointed. Like others have done, I've used ground turkey, the cans of crushed and diced tomatoes, one red and one green bell pepper, and added a can of corn. Since I'm weird about beans, I use one can black and one can small red. Once I added dark chocolate. This chili has been delicious in ALL its variations! (And I'm *not* a foolproof cook.)

I've made several other chilis on this site, and this I am afraid, is the worst. The reason? That much chili powder carries a strong aftertaste and undertaste. Nothing could remedy the damage done to my tastebuds -- or the other ingredients. Stick with real chile peppers, and the accompanying spices (garlic, cumin, coriander, etc.)....

Nothing like a hearty bowl of tasty chili! I took previous reviewers' advice and replaced with two 28-oz. cans of crushed tomatoes and one 15-oz. can of diced tomatoes. I also used ground turkey (2 lbs.), and only one green pepper. This recipe has a lot of slack. Try it and enjoy!

Fabulous flavor! I made this in a crock pot with a few changes. Like Berkeley: 1 32-oz can crushed tomatoes, 1 15-oz can diced. 1 lb ground turkey. Substituted 1 green bell pepper for one red bell, and kidney beans for 1 can black and 1 can pinto. Also added 1 can of corn, 1 oz semi sweet chocolate, and ½ bottle of beer. In spite of all these changes though, I kept the seasonings the same, as they are what are truly delicious. The other changes were just for personal preference, and could be exchanged as desired. I cooked on high for 3 hours in the crockpot, and then reheated after refrigerating overnight, and served over baked potatos and topped with cheese. Even with just a pound of meat, it was plenty hearty, and made 8 servings. I would love to try with shredded turkey.

I made this with 2.75 lbs. of ground turkey (I like a meaty chili), and the results were fabulous. I added a little bit more of all the spices, just to give it a little more kick. It was so less greasy than the beef version. I'll never make it with beef again! Everyone loved it and asked for seconds.

I have been making this recipe since 1990. It's the best post-Thanksgiving recipe in the world and I love it. I've had several copies sent to me by friends after I lost the issue of Gourmet. I found epicurious.com after searching for this recipe on line. What a great resource. And what a great recipe! I use all the turkey I have leftover and it works great.

Even though I didn't make this EXACTLY as the recipe is written, I'm rating this chili anyway because the most important element (flavor) was still there even after I made a few changes. To start, I used ground turkey instead of cooked turkey pieces. Simply toss it in after you saute the onions and let the meat brown a little. My only two other changes were (1) replacing the plum tomatoes with crushed tomatoes in puree and (2) replacing the can of puree with a can of diced tomatoes. The only reason I did this was because I didn't have the specific ingredients on hand. Also, I simply threw all the ingredients in the pot after I browned the ground turkey and let the chili cook for about 90 minutes - and it tasted great. I don't believe these changes greatly altered the original recipe because this dish gets its big flavor from the great spice combination.

Great Turkey Chili Recipe! I substituted about 2 lbs. of browned ground turkey breast for the dark meat and added at the beginning of the 2 hour simmer, which is a great healthy alternative. This really doesn't have a lot of fat, so it's a great, high protein dish for those who work out or are on restricted diets. I added corn as well, and it gave one more layer of substance to the chili. I'd definitely make this again.

I made this chili with our leftover Christmas turkey. I reduced the amount of green peppers, and didn't cook the turkey parts in the tomato base. I had already cooked and seperated the meat. I just added the meat and some of the broth. My family loved the chili and we will be making this a regular post holiday meal. Quite possibly at other times of the year also! Yum!!!

An excellent chili for those who never know what to do with the dark meat--I also add the funky stringy meat on the underside of the bird. We like it so much that we often cook a turkey only to get to this leftover recipe. Add a bag of frozen corn and frozen peas and double this one!
