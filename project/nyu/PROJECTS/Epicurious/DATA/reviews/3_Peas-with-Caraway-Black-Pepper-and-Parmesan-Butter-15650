These peas have become a staple of Thanksgiving and Christmas spreads at my house. They are wonderful. I think they're best with high-quality petite frozen peas -- the bigger frozen peas are a bit too tough for my taste. The caraway seeds add a wonderful flavor.

Next time, I'd toast and crush the caraway seeds, to bring them out more, and be ultra-careful either to undercook the peas or serve them immediately.

I really enjoyed the flavour combinations in this dish. Caraway is something that I like the taste of and I'm often not sure what to use it with. It really works in this recipe.

It was alright. You could cut the recipe in half and still have plenty for a group of 6 or so. It was a little boring, although I love both peas and caraway.

With my first bite, I didn't think this was anything special, but after taking a few more, I really started to taste the parmesan and carraway. Wow! Really good! Don't omit the carraway, it gives this dish that "something" that makes this an interesting way to make peas.

My family loved it! Simple way to upscale peas. Used it exactly as written.

Another winner with my family! I tried it out with my husband and son before including it on this year's Thanksgiving menu. We loved it and needless to say so did our guests on Thanksgiving. I did not use the carraway seeds and added toasted pine nuts just before serving. A definite repeat.

Something happened when I put in the parmesan mixture. The cheese clumped together in a blob. Maybe I used too much cheese. Next time, I would not add the cheese to the butter, I would just sprinkle it in until it was well mixed. It was tasty though and good as a leftover.

I did not have caraway seeds, so I substituted sesame seeds and cut all portions in thirds. It tasted great and was still good as a leftover dish when microwaved. I agree that the lemon was a wonderful addition to the taste.

With all the great ingredients, I thought this would be better. Nothing special-wouldn't recommend.

It's great to be able to do something new with peas. They have a hearty flavour that goes well with beef.

This was a great side dish at Thanksgiving, but I would follow the advice of another reviewer and nix (or drastically reduce) the caraway, unless you happen to love that particular flavor. It really dominated the peas. We followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out wonderfully otherwise.

Delicious - a hit at Thanksgiving! I skipped the Caraway seeds and substituted chicken broth for beef broth and it came out great. Don't skip the lemon peel - it really makes the dish.
