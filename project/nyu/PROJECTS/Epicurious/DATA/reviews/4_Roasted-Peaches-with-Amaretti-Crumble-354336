I made this recipe last night for a garden party -- using direct from the market peaches and felt like it was just 'ok'. The only thing going for it was the amaretti cookies, otherwise I thought it was pretty bland/boring. I did like that it was not too sugary. I almost always receive compliments on my desserts -- and this one elecited no response!

I did a modified version owing to the fact that I did not have the amaretti cookies. I substituted old-fashioned oats, and used brown sugar. I found that the flavor was good , but the topping a bit dry. Next time it would add water until the mixture was a but more pasty in consistency and not crumbly. Still it was delicious, and worth another try.

I rated this 3 and not 4 for one simple reason...the skin. Next time I make this, (and I WILL definitely make it again) I will remove the skin after baking...too difficult to eat with it on. My company thought so too...but everyone did say it was absolutely delicious...the amaretti was yummy and wouldn't substitute for a different cookie... A nice change from the ordinary, but super easy to make!

I made this for a dinner party with friends. They were all gone in moments. Best summer dessert if you are looking for something light and not too sugary. I also recommend reducing the sugar to let the fruit's natural fructose shine through. A+

Made this for a bbq for my husband and his two friends. It was demolished in a matter of moments and they were still talking about it the next day. Super easy and perfect for a summer bbq. My peaches wouldn't halve easily so I cut them into pieces before tossing with the amaretti crumble.

I've made this 3 times so far - LOVE IT!!!!! I've used 2 different kinds of cookies - the type of cookie makes a difference - we tend to like the softer amaretti in this recipe.
