This was simply incredible. One of the best new recipes I've tried in the past year or so. Pork was succulent and amazing, sauce was great-- true it's perfect over mashed potatoes. This is rustic enough for a hearty family dinner and fancy enough for a party or holiday.

As an aspiring chef this recipe caught my eye at first glance. My husband is in the army an we just moved to the beautiful bavarian countryside of germany. Luckily here pork is like life to these people and my little village not only has a wonderful butcher but also a baker...sorry no candlestick maker, or maybe I haven't found him yet. I picked up some delicious and size-worthy pork shanks. Believe me the german translation was not so easy at first. Although this recipe is time consuming I suggest preparing this on a Sunday where you can take the day to really enjoy the aromas flowing from your kitchen. My husband absolutely loved this dish and my german landlords cannot speak a word of english but by their mmmmmhs and smiles I could tell they enjoyed this as well. Thanks for the great recipe. Some fresh bread for dipping in the sauce makes a great compliment.

I was unable to purchase the shanks in Charlotte but did order them from the perveyor suggested in BA. Received in two days, frozen solid. Served it at a dinner party. Rave reviews. The sauce is divine. Of course it was fatty, it is a pork shank. Just cook it and remove the fat. Would serve again in an instant. YUMMY

If you're concerned about it being fatty, braise the meat a day in advance and let it sit in your fridge overnight. This makes spooning off the fat much easier as it will have hardened at the top the next day. This recipe is out of this world - I am guessing that those who had problems bought their shanks (also called hocks) in the grocery store. I bought mine from an eco-friendly farm who also supplies to restaurants - the cuts were nice and meaty and the perfect size (about 1 lb each). You can also trim the rind and fat off before cooking, but I personally think you'd be crazy to do that. This was 1 of 4 courses at a dinner party I hosted this weekend (in addition to the ricotta gnudi from the same issue) and this course was BY FAR the favorite. Served with truffled mashed potatoes from Cooking Light - fantastic!

Made this dish with one major change: didn't use shank. Two butchers looked at me like I was crazy when I asked for it, and one talked me into--of all things--a pork butt roast. I did everything else according to the recipe, but did not include the last step of baking the meat on its own in the oven, as the boneless roast would have been totally overdone at that point. Otherwise, it was very flavorful and went over very well. The meat was juicy and not tough, and cost about $10. A tenderloin would also work well, and obviously be much more tender, but need far less cooking time. Generally easy to prepare. Oh - and instead of mashed potatoes, I added baby red bliss potatoes to the pot for the last 20 minutes or so. Super easy, very pretty, and hit the spot. A quick side of wilted baby spinach and good to go.

Like the other reviewer, the pork shank was fatty and disgusting. It ruined the dish. It's a shame, because the sauce was fantastic. It's worth trying only if you get a good and meaty pork shank.

I made this dish for Christmas Eve dinner and was very disappointed. I found this cut of meat to be disgustingly fatty although the sauce was good (I used it to make a shepherd's pie the next day). I expected this to be an osso bucco type dish, but it was just fat and skin. Yuck.

delicious & relatively simple to make. we found the shanks at a mexican market as even the butcher didn't have them...the meat fell off the bone, but i would cook the meat for even longer at a lower temperature to make it even more tender. also, each shank is QUITE substantial- have an appetite or figure out how to usee the extra...the sauce was delicious- all in all very impressive meal.
