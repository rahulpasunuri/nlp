Loved this recipe! Made this for valentines with my husband. I mixed vanilla bean specks into the egg mixture and a scant amount of vanilla extract. It turned out amazing! The vanilla aroma flowed through our house. The vanilla flavor wasn't overpowering either. Use incredibly ripe pairs. The pear flavor is fantastic in this. The powdered sugar melted slightly on the top (i sifted it on right after I pulled the dish out of the oven) and made the pears slightly crunchy and candy-like on one side. So incredibly good. I will def. make this again!

there is a reason why others found this too eggy, too greasy, fruit separating. Please try the follow recipe. its been in my family for years. take 3 large pears or 18 oz black cherries and dust w 1/4 cup caster sugar, leave for at least 30min. put in buttered tin. In a bowl, take 1 cup of flour, pinch of salt, 1/4 dcup caster sugar and 3 well beaten eggs and mix well.Add 1 1/4 cup of of whole milk and mix again. pour mixture over pears or cherries and bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees for 35-40 min. when it has cooled dust w icing sugar. please try this and you can use this recipe w any fruit. make sure you dust the fruit w sugar and leave for a bit. this makes a bit of difference and you don't need the 1/2 stick of butter as this recipe suggests. you only need some butter to butter the dish.

I did not have any white wine, sweet or otherwise, so I used some peach cider to macerate the pears. I also used skim milk in the custard, which seemed to turn out fine. I added some cinnamon, mace, cloves, and nutmeg to the powdered sugar, which really gave the pears a nice depth. This was very easy to make and delicious. I am eager to try this with different combinations of fruit and spices.

Delicious! I mixed nutmeg and cinnamon with the icing sugar but I did everything else as written. A little messy to serve but the taste was divine.

Followed recipe exactly - no problems with it being done in the time stated, but the custard was overpowered by the taste of the eggs.

Very easy and fast, using basic ingredients, which is wonderful. It is very good, but could use more flavor and less grease. When I make it again, I will use less butter and more vanilla or perhaps some almond extract for more flavor. The cinnamon idea that others mentioned also seems like a good idea.

This dessert had a nice taste, but I had a problem with the texture. I followed the directions exactly, except for cooking it 5 minutes longer to firm it up a bit, and it still came out very wet. The fruit and the custard sort of separated, causing the slices to fall apart when I took them out of the pan. A lot of butter also rose to the top, creating little butter pools (don't know if that's supposed to happen or not). But like I said, the vanilla and pear combination of tastes was wonderful. I'd love to get this recipe right so that it's not so soggy and stays together better. Any suggestions?

I made this with (home-grown) apples for a French bistro dinner. Topped with some whipped cream it was the perfect finish to the meal. A big bonus is the fact that it is so simple to prepare. I doubled the recipe and served 14 with ease.

This was a wonderful winter evening recipe. I added a bit of cinnamon to the batter which I recommend as well, and served it with a bit of vanilla ice cream. Next time I will try with strawberries, which is how I had first had clafoutis at a restaurant.

I made this the other night for a dinner party and it came out great. Everyone loved it and 2 people wanted the recipe! I used plums instead of pears. I cooked it for about 10 minutes extra since it still seemed a bit loose and quite honestly it could have used a bit more time than that to firm up. But, it still tasted wonderful and the fact that it was not firmer didn't matter--except to me!

Am suprised this has not been reviewed much! This is a fabulous, unusal, and easy dessert to make. Guests loved it! Wouldn't change a thing really. I used peaches since they have been in season but will try pears next. Looking forward to making this one again.

This is our new favorite dessert recipe. Talk about comfort food...this epitomizes it. Reminds one of a giant fat custard German pancake/bread pudding. Yummy!

I would try this again with real butter (instead of margarine) and a bit longer baking time. My 2 dinner companions loved this, but I found it eggy and runny.

This was a wonderful and simple dessert! My only deviation from the given recipe was to add some cinnamon into the powdered sugar.

Presents beautifully. It's a nice finish for dinner, for it is not over poweringly sweet, but still satisfys the urge for dessert. One of my guests said it tasted healthy. I didn't tell him about the 4 eggs......

This was a very quick dessert to make and very good as well. I did sprinkle a bit of cinnamon on top of the clafoutis along with the powdered sugar which gave it a little spice.

Very simple dish, which is its appeal to me--the fruit stays firm. I would, however, add some cinnamon, clove and a dash of nutmeg to the custard when using pears, that or mix the spices with the powdered sugar for dusting. Serving this with clear pear brandy goes over very well--excellent for fall dinner get togethers!
