I made this yesterday, along with two other varieties. My tips for making the frico cups are to use a flipped over mini-muffin tin, and use a paper towel to form the cheese over the tin after removing from the skillet. I had a lot difficulty with cracking when I toasted the cheese on both sides, but I found that if I just toasted the cheese on one side, and then put it on the tin with the toasted side up that the paper towel would remove most of the oil, and then later when I was ready to use them I arranged them right side on a baking pan, and threw them in the oven for a minute to get a crisp on the top. Worked perfectly, I was really happy with the results. I forgot to use the flour, but it didn't seem to make a difference. The herbed goat cheese was yummy, but it was better by itself as a dip or spread than in the frico cups. I'd make both again, but not together.

I also was making these for a large party we were having and wanted to make the cups ahead of time and freeze so I did an successful trial run by making just a few of the frico cups, froze them overnight, thawed the next day and they were just fine! You just have to place them carefully in tupperware to prevent breakage. And yes, for that extra crisp you can put them in the oven for a few minutes.

I failed at making the cups the first couple of trys then changed my technique. Used our BBQ griddle which covers 2 burners on the stove...then used my super thing, flexible metal spatula. You need to quickly slide the spatula under the cup to flip. I made 6 cups at a time. Used the mini muffin pan but just to give the cup a quick little shape by pressing in the center briefly so the sides came up. I wasn't concerned about perfect looking cups.

Super tasty. I agree with others regarding the frico cups. Impossible. I tried others' suggestions to no avail. I ended up purchasing frozen phylo cups & crumbling the baked parmesan rounds into them, then piping the goat cheese mixture on top. Looked mighty pretty and tasted just delicious. Received rave reviews.

These are great and I too gave up on the mini muffin cup concept. Flat little disks of cheese are tasty no matter how they look. Do use the micro plane to make them light as air.

I made this appetizer for our annual Holiday Party. It was a HUGE success, everyone loved it. I found it easy to make, although my first 3 frico cups failed, once I got the hang of it, the frico cups were easy to make. Re- heating in the oven did not work - the fell out of shape.

Once I abandoned the cup idea, these were very easy. I ended up making small rounds - I used slightly less than 1 t. for each, and spread it around so that it was a little smaller than a quarter (but not too thin or they are too brittle). I baked them on a silicone pad at 350 for about 7 minutes (the amount of crispness is a matter of taste, I think). Then when done I just piped a dollop of the goat cheese mixture on top - it made very tasty, 1-bite appetizers.

These are much easier to make if you turn the mini-muffin tin over and place the cooked frico on them. Just press lightly to form them. Also, if you make them ahead, and they get rubbery, reheat in a low oven for minute or so, and they will recrisp. A lot of work, but very tasty.

These are very tasty and there's an easier way to make the cups (I had trouble during my first attempts in a skillet):**Bake in a 300 degree F oven on Silpat for about 5-6 minutes or until they're golden. Then transfer them to mini muffin tins to create the shape you want. sooooo good!

I found these very difficult to make -- had to toss about one third because they melted into a blob or simply crumbled. The ones that did make it were fine, but not worth the work.

Was a little intimidated by some comments below, and I don't own a microplane! (am I the only one?) But I loved these. Used a regular old rotary parmesan grater, worked just fine. The first couple of fricos were a bit rough around the edges, and I poked a hole in them trying to get them in the muffin cup. The process came easy, I had fun, and the 'rejects' were tasty all on their own! I would use these cups with other fillings! This was the perfect combination of fun and good taste!

I made a bunch of variations on this theme for a holiday party I catered. I had a group of people who, I shudder at the thought, did not like goat cheese. For them, I made frico cups piped with roasted red pepper cream cheese and cream cheese with caramelized onions. Delish. Anyone have any tips on a way to make the frico cups more quickly? I was limited to making about 6 or so at a time. What a pain when I needed to make 150!

Easy to make and well received by all to whom I've served this. We have tried all sorts of variations in seasoning the goat cheese all turned out great. I found the Frico cups to be very versatile, and have served them with tempanade as well. A definite keeper

This was pretty easy to make, especially once I got the process down for making the cups. I tried using the spoon method recommended by one reviewer but found that sprinking with my fingers was much more effective. Also, I had to be careful about the amount of time I left the cup on heat - if I left it one for too long then the cup would crumble in the muffin mold.

This was a huge hit at our party. Making the cups was difficult, but with some practice, they get easier. I suggest pouring the mound of cheese onto the nonstick surface and then quickly using the back of the spoon to spread it out into a circle. It is easier than trying to sprinkle the cheese into a circle. I had much better control over the thickness and shape of the cups. I will be making these again in the future.

Had planned to make these for Mothers Day but ran out of time to complete the fricos. Used the goat cheese piped into leaves of endive and decorated with a small chive stem which was an easy alternative and well received. Next time I will add more chives and parsley to the goat cheese mixture as another reviewer suggested. On to the fricos...I tried them after everyone left and it took some trials to figure it out. My initial problem was using a very fine gauge microplane. When I switched to a medium gauge microplane they were much easier to cook and handle. Also,I liked the more rustic look. You can fill in any holes with a tad more cheese mixture before you flip them. The flavor combination was great. We did notice that they were quite crumbly when eaten by hand; I won't be serving these over my beautiful carpets but I will be serving them again. By my calculations, with the medium grater, this recipe would yield about 18 fricos.

Of the appetizers in the Holiday Feast menu, these were the best. The frico cups were not too difficult (the microplane grater was key) and flavors and textures were great.

Are you kidding me? This recipe is ridiculously hard, I don't know what planet these other people are from. You start sprinkling the cheese mixture on the pan and it starts to set and cook right away. How the hell are you supposed to get it to form into a circle? Mine came out totally misshapen and if you only use two teaspoons, there's no way they'll be big enough. Also, they completely crumble when you try to push them into the muffin pan. I'm not an inexperienced cook either, I make a damn good pie crust. That's pretty hard, this was impossible. I have to say though, I took some of the crumbled remnanats of my hacked up cups and smeared them with goat cheese, and they were absolutely delicious, I ate them all myself. There's no way you can make 24 out of that amount of parmesan though, more like 6 or 7. Ugh...

These were a hit for a NYE dinner. I left the frico cups in the mini-muffin tin (as an early reviewer suggested) and filled right before we eat. They turned out great. I will make these again for certain.

These were a hit with our guests at New Year's Eve. These were devoured faster than I could make them. The sharpness of the aged parm with the contrast of the goat cheese made this a delectable appetizer.

Served these on Christmas Eve. I consulted this forum before I made them and am so glad I did. Thanks for your helpful suggestions, everyone. I made three or four fricos at a time with no problem---the operation went slick as a whistle. I attribute my success to the Microplane Grater---it grates the cheese as light as a feather. The recipe yielded 30 appetizers rather than 36. I own 4 mini-muffin tins, so there was no need to take the frico cups out of the tins; I left the frico cups in place overnight. The next day I carefully placed the frico cups, still in their muffin tins, in shallow cardboard boxes,loaded them into my Subaru Outback, and transported them to Billings, Montana---350 miles. They arrived in great shape. We piped the flavored goat cheese into them and placed them on a white china platter garnished with long stems of chives. They looked great and were eaten with gusto. I will make them again. Next time, I will use a fluted, rather than a plain decorating tube, and I will be sure to use a light touch with the pastry tube lest the fricos crumble under the weight of the cheese.

These were a big hit at a house Christmas party. Make sure the pan isn't too hot when you cook these--I needed to increase the cooking time a bit as well. They don't make as many as the recipe says. And yes, you can cook about 4 in the pan at the same time.

The cups were impossible to make following the directions given. I measured exactly and followed the directions precisely and the cup mixture did not come together. We liked the goat cheese filling. Thankfully, I had some frozen puff pastry on hand to use as a base. I threw away the parmigiano-reggiano/flour mixture.
