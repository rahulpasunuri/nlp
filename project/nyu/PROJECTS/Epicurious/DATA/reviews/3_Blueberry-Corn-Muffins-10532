Great and easy muffins. I substituted 2/3 cup of cut up raspberries and I used partially frozen blueberries. Yummy!

terriable! they were bad and way too greasy.. all the cornmeal sank to the bottom they burned on the top and still did not cook in the inside.. the only good part was the crust...

These muffins were very good, exactly what I was looking for. I might make them just a tiny bit sweeter next time, to cut down on the dominance of the cornmeal flavor, but they were very good. The berries balance out the corn nicely, and using honey is a nice touch.

Made these exactly as written and they turned out great! I think that next time we'll use less butter.

These turned out very pretty and tasty. I used fine grain corn meal (for Polenta) because that was all I had. I still got a little crunch to the muffin. I also added chopped pecans which added some more texture and flavor. Used frozen blueberries from last summer (put in batter while frozen). Very quick and easy,.

Made these with my toddler yesterday, and they were fantastic! Used frozen wild blueberries, 1% milk, and swapped 2 tablespoons of applesauce for equiv amount of butter. Love the crunch you get from the corn meal, and they're jam-packed with blueberries.

This was a really good blueberry corn muffin recipe. I even used much less butter (cut in at least half) and substituted 1/4 cup of applesauce with great results. Also added a tiny bit of molasses, just for flavor.

I liked this because it goes together easily and tastes great! Those who had a problem do not understand muffins.They are not supposed to taste like cupcakes...and the key is mixing JUST until all the dry ingredients are wet. I used fine cornmeal and the texture was perfect! I added a half teaspoon of vanilla and a half teaspoon of cinnamon because I like those flavor enhancers, but I know it would taste great without. I also left out the sugar and sprinkled turbinado sugar on top for a little crunch. A definite keeper!

I think this is a little too greasy. I made the recipe as written with one exception. I used others suggestions of softening 1/2 of the cornmeal in milk for 20 minutes. I probably won't make these again.

I am going to try these muffins again. The first time I made them, they were delicious - but greasy! The butter seeped through the paper muffin cups and weren't very appetizing the next day. They're fantastic if you are planning to eat them all right out of the oven!

I am willing to try this one again, but only because I used defrosted berries. They came out mushy! There wasn't much flavor, next time I'll replace the sugar with honey.

I really liked these muffins. I followed the recipe and also soaked the cornmeal for about 20 minutes. I also cut the temperature down to 400 during the last 10 minutes (I cooked for 20 min) Next time I might add fewer blueberries. I definately recommend this recipe.

I used wild Maine frozen blueberries and the texture and flavor of these muffins were perfect.

Use more blueberries. Everybody likes a ton of them in their muffins. Frozen work great, are cheaper, always ripe, and remain suspended in the dough (you may have to bake just a little longer) I really liked the crisp top. A great "emergency" recipe, very fast and easy. Nice.

I followed the recipe, had great results and would definately make these again. They are quick and easy for a weekend breakfast bread.

Pretty good, I make this recipe fairly often. Usually I make 1/2 with blueberries (since there are only 2 of us) and the rest without to eat with chili or use later in stuffing for pork chops. Only complaint is the blueberries make them very moist and if you want a hot muffin, it's hard to get it out of the muffin pan without breaking up the muffin. It works fine with no blueberries.

Rating: 2
Just too grainy. It doesn't go well with the softness of the blueberries. Will not make again

Rating: 3
Delicious, moist muffins! The cornmeal adds a unique flavor. My only complaint is that I only got 10 _small_ muffins out of the batter. My modifications: I used only 1/2 c. cornmeal, which I soaked in the milk as other reviewers suggested. To compensate, I upped the flour to 1-1/2 cups. Also, I used raspberries (1 c.) instead of blueberries-- personal preference-- and added 1/2 c. chocolate chips. I'll surely be making these again.

These muffins have the crunch of the cornmeal, yet the moistness of the berries that pleases your mouth. I replaced the sugar with Splenda but kept the honey and it was perfect. For the Aussie cook from down under: when you need buttermilk, just put 2 T of lemon juice into a cup of milk and let sit for 15 mn at room temp. Presto buttermilk!

This is the perfect combination of fresh summer berries and classic corn muffin. I like that they are lightly sweetened with honey. Delicious!! I will definatley make these again soon!

I just realized I forgot the egg, but I couldn't tell the difference. Very moist and delicious. I also skipped the blueberries - I just wanted a nice, sweet corn bread to serve with spicy barbeque.

I made this recipe when I needed a quick batch of baked goods. Unfortunately, I left them in too long and they became dark brown, so I left them home. When I returned, I found my husband had carefully peeled off the over browned tops and eated 5 of them! He proclaimed them the best corn/blueberry muffins he's ever eaten, and he's picky. I thought they were delicious, and appreciated that they don't have to be made with buttermilk, which I don't often have on hand. I cut the amount of blueberries down to 1 cup, and it was a perfect balance of sweetness. They'd be great for a quick morning feast!

I've made this recipe 4 times. We love it. I substitute whole wheat pastry flour for the white flour, and use 1/4 cup veg oil and 1/4 cup butter (instead of 1/2 cup butter). I make 24 mini-muffins using paper liners. Be sure to use fine cornmeal (or cornflour), or else it will be too gritty. It's very flavorful and the honey keeps the muffins fresh and moist longer then most muffins. Freezes well too.

Way too crumbly and dry.

This recipe was way too sweet for my taste between the sugar, honey, and blueberries. I would at least cut either the sugar or honey in half.

These tasted great, but even though I tried the milk and cornmeal soaking technique mentioned below, I was afraid I was going to break a tooth on the finished product. If I make these again, I will use finely ground cornmeal, not the coarse stuff that I used today.

Very good muffins. Also soaked cornmeal in milk. Worked well. Only used 1 1/2 cups berries and that was plenty.

Ok, I enjoyed these muffins, but I'm stymied why Epicurious (the "World's Best Recipe Site", blah blah) has exactly ONE recipe for non-corn blueberry muffins. Maybe they figure regular blueberry muffins are too basic for their readers. I'm still looking for that recipe, though...

I tried these muffins again this week and substitued mashed bannanas and walnuts for the bluberrys and they were phenominal. I definitly reccommend saoking the cornmeal in the milk for 20 minutes initially.

Rating: 3
These are delicious. I used a combo of half soft cornmeal and half coarse. That gave a nice amount of crunch and texture without being too gritty. I did find there were a few too many blueberries - I'll cut back to 1 1/2 cups next time. I also added a tsp of lemon zest. They were great!

These muffins were a hit with everyone who was fast enough to take one before they were all gone! I made them in Texas style tins so they were big and delicious. They have just the right amount of sweetness for a nice breakfast. And I found that letting the cornmeal sit in the milk for 20 minutes did the trick to make the muffins less gritty, as suggested by one reviewer. Might be nice to sprinkle the batter with large sugar granules before baking. Will definitely make these again!

Some people complained about the grittiness of the cornmeal in this recipe. This can happen in any corn muffin recipe. There are two solutions: use a fine corn meal, or corn flour, instead of the rougher grind most of us have in our pantries. Try health food stores for fine-ground cornmeal/flour. The other trick is to stir together the milk and cornmeal and let that soak for half an hour before mixing in all the other ingredients. This yields a soft, cornbread-type texture, with pleasant contrasting textures. Using corn flour will yield a more cake-like muffin. Both are good!

Very disappointing. I think when I added the milk which was cold to the butter which was melted but cooled, it made the butter congeal. Total waste of time.

I make this recipe all the time, it's my husbands' favorite muffin recipe. I'm not sure why other reviewers were unhappy, but I think you should stick to the recipe to get the best results.

I liked the idea of cornmeal in these muffins but somehow it didn't seem to cook all the way through. The result was crunchy pieces of cornmeal in the muffins. I thought they would be more like cornbread, crumbly but moist, I don't think the cornmeal should crunch when you eat it. They have potential I think. Not too sweet and great for breakfast, but what to do about getting the cornmeal cooked without burning the muffins?

I thought these were ok. I know I probably share some of the blame for that, since I used barley malt syrup instead of honey (mine was all crystallized, and I was in a hurry) and whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose. Just don't tell Kallie! :-) They weren't bad, I just felt they were missing something...(maybe honey?). I did enjoy the chewiness, though. I doubt I'd try them again unless I was in a rare mood. Maybe they'll taste better if I heat one and top it with some honey....

Rediscovered this recipe and made it with frozen cranberries instead. A great balance with the sweetness of the honey, maybe even better than with blueberries.

Ok, I really liked the idea of making this into a savory versus sweet option. Here's what I tried, it's probably a new item, but it was based here so I thought I'd include it here. Cut the corn meal in half and replace it with flour. Keep the honey but replace the sugar with freshly grated cheese (I used a mix of asiago and romano). I included two teaspoons each of freshly minced basil and rosemary. Add a teaspoon of olive oil to keep the muffins moist since you're not adding fruit. Baking time stays the same but you end up with 10 muffins instead of 12 due to the missing two cups of fruit. It was very well received. Let me know your thoughts!

These were a nice change from your average corn muffin recipe. I will definately make these again.

These muffins were SO easy to make! They were moist and very flavorful. The blueberries added a nice touch to the typical corn muffin and likewise, it was great to have a new twist on plain blueberry muffins. I recommend using fresh blueberries in these.

These were good - a nice change from the good ol' standard white flour muffins. I used about 5 tbs of butter instead of the whole stick. I do this often as an experiment to see if a recipe can do without the extra calories and fat. These were still very good. Would they be even better with all of the butter? Probably, but I still enjoyed them with less. I found my muffins didn't keep as long as some other muffins - after a few days the texture of the corn meal became soggy and they tasted completely different. Perhaps due to the lack of the extra butter? Enjoy!

Absolutely wonderful. I added lemon zest and a tsp. vanilla extract, plus one extra egg. The cornmeal lends perfect texture.

I made these muffins and brought them up to a ski chalet. They disappeared. I too, found that they burned quickly, and were crumbly, but very moist. I used raspberries, rather than blueberries and I substituted a little whole wheat flour for white flour. After baking, leave them in the pan for a few minutes to cool before you attempt to take them out. In terms of being 'corny' or 'grainy', I think they're supposed to be that way, since they are 'corn' muffins?

THese are great. Interesting twist with blueberry and corn meal, just try it you'll love it.

I found that letting the muffins sit for several minutes in the muffin tin helped solidify them a bit, so they didn't crumble when I removed them.

Very nice, not too sweet and easy to make. The texture of the cornmeal adds interest, as does the honey. I sifted both the flower and cornmeal to eliminate any "grainy" effects or taste. They are delicious!

I made these today (Monday 4th) for a book club meeting at my house on Wednesday. My husband said "I had more chance of getting struck by lightening than these muffins lasting until Wednesday!". I only used half a tablespoon of lemon zest and this seemed enough. A definite winner!!

I only used 1/4 cup of cornmeal (that's all I had in the house) and substituted all purpose flour for the other 3/4 cup. I also used lactose free skim milk instead of whole milk. I added vanilla extract too. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee and it came out delicious. Fast and easy. I will definitely make these muffins again.

I made this recipe when it first appeared in Gourmet. I have kept it and made it many times since. They are moist, not greasy, and delicious. The cornmeal taste and texture and the blueberry flavor both come through well with neither being overpowering. A real summer treat.

I didn't have enough honey, so I used half honey and half brown sugar - absolutely delicious - very corny - could be used as a savory muffin if you delete some of the sweetener.

Rating: 3
I agree with previous reviewers -- this is an extremely moist muffin. So much so that I had to let them completely cool in the tins before being able to remove them in one piece. I find most muffin recipes not sweet enough, so I normally increase the amount of sugar. But not this one! It was great, as is, with a pronounced honey flavor. Personally, I thought that worked well with the corn taste, but if you're not a big fan of honey, you might not like that. Knowing now how much the honey flavor comes through, I would definitely try different kinds of honey. I did not have any fresh blueberries, so I used a 16 oz bag of frozen blueberries (which came to a little over 2 cups) instead. I did not thaw or rinse them, but I did make sure any clumps were broken up. There were plenty of berries (which I liked!), but I actually ended up with 13 muffins. One problem I encountered was that the edges of the muffins burned slightly at 425, even before the tester came out clean. I tried it at 400, but there was no difference. Maybe next time I shall divide them into 14 muffins, and lower the temp to 375. Did anyone else have this problem?

These muffins are easy to make, and a wonderful variation. The cornbread makes these unique, and the honey keeps them wonderfully moist. If your crowd likes classic blueberry muffins, they'll love these.
