Hmmm. I would take some of the reviewers notes and come up with a new recipe for asparagus bisque to post on here. I was withholding judgment on ingredient choices until the final product; I should have trusted my palate-instincts. Admustments: Chicken stock, sour cream instead of fraiche, a lot less dill, a little more curry and I like the thought of vanilla soy milk! May try it again, our way. :)

I wasn't that impressed with the recipe as is, but I will try again with chicken broth vs water and an extra leek. I also increased the curry powder and found myself adding alot of salt and pepper to bring out the flavor...and I'm not a huge salt fan. Maybe my rating will change after a second attempt with a completely revamped, i.e. new recipe...or I'll try a different one.

This recipe was a great success, exactly what I wanted in a chilled pureed vegetable soup to serve as a 2nd course in a 5 course meal. All the guests loved it! Using one reviewer's suggestion of left-over stock in lieu of water, I used 4 cups chicken broth and 1/2 cup water. A full 2 1/2 pounds of asparagus was key, requiring 3 bunches (1 lb each), leaving roughly 2 1/2 pounds after the fibrous ends were cut off. To save prep time, the leeks and asparagus can be cut into larger 2-inch pieces since they will soften with the simmer, and end up being pureed anyway. Leaving the vegetables off-heat on the stove to cool a bit before transfering to the food processor may decrease the burn risk that one reviewer noted. Instead of dill, I used fresh parseley, saving some to add to the creme fraiche dollops as garnish for the soup before serving. Creme fraiche, although more expensive than sour cream, was well worth it. I used 2 tsp curry (1 tsp each time 3/4 tsp was called for) instead of 1 1/2, a little salt and plenty of fresh ground black pepper and it was pleasantly subtly flavored.

I must have done something wrong compared to the other reviewers because I found it very easy to make and guests seemed to enjoy it very much. I had a large bunch of asparagus that had been in the refrigerator for a while and was looking for a soup recipe and stumbled across this. I also had a large batch of vegatable stock that I needed to use as well. I substituted stock for water and sour cream for creme fraiche. I made soup a day ahead and the next evening brought it up and served it at room tempature. Everyone seemed to enjoy it very much and I thought it was delicious and had a wonderfully subtle curry flavor. I didn't have pink peppercorns and garnished instead with a split asparagus flourette.

I did try this recipe as soon as the issue came out of the newsstand but since I didn't have sour cream, I altered this recipe slightly. 4 cups of water, 1 can of chicken broth, 3 stalks of leeks, 1 rubber-band full of asparagus, same amount of curry powder, 3 teaspoonfuls of dill, 1 cup full of vanilla soymilk (for depth), 1 tablespoon of salt. Do all this before the 15 minute simmer and then puree in blender and then season with a little more salt and some pepper. Delicious.

I got mixed reviews on this one. I may make it again if I can figure out how to make it better. I had a bad start with this soup--when I was blending it, scalding-hot, the bottom of my blender fell out, spilling thick burning green liquid all over me and the cat, who used to like to hang out under my feet while I cooked. Cured the cat of that habit. I served it to my boyfriend and one of our friends. They gave it back and asked me to heat it up. After it was hot, they both liked it. This may be due more to unsophisticated palettes than actual flavor. Like other reviewers said, I loved the idea of this soup, but the results weren't that great. Plus it burnt the hell out of my arm.

I agree with you guys! This wasn't good at all, despite the lovely ingredients.

I would make this again if I made the changes suggested by other reviews. Has anyone noticed, the receipes just are not that exciting anymore?? Often, the methodology is just "messed" up!! Also, not finding anything particularly exciting. And, I used to love this site!!

This soup was gross... Yech!

The taste here is very bland, and the saute recommendation in earlier review would have helped. Also, the need to strain was never explained. Very poor effort, but the idea of a curried asparagus soup is a good one.

I just saw this recipe and read it and the reviews. Two things come to mind. "Bland" has been popping up in more and more of the reviews--Epicurious seems to be concentrating too heavily on looks. Secondly, the methodology is poor. Curry powder should always be "cooked" before liquid is added. The recipe should have you saute the leeks and curry powder in a small amount of olive oil at the beginning

I agree with every word written by the cook from St. Joseph.

I used chicken broth rather than water, curry paste rather than powder, did not strain it, and served it hot. It was delicious. The kids thought it was too spicy, but they think everything is too spicy.

let me go on record saying that i love asparagus anything, however, i found this recipe to be VERY bland. i tried to remedy by adding chicken broth and heating it. came out so-so. i think there are a lot of better soup/bisque recipes out there -- dont waste your time on this one.

Simple and delicious. BTW, Merrrian-Webster defines "bisque" as "a thick cream soup made with shellfish or game [or] a cream soup of pureed vegetables."

How is this a bisque?

I love cream of asparagus soup anyway and the peppercorns and curry really make it special.

Even good Hot

Pretty good. I added generous amts of curry powder, dill, salt and pepper to try to avoid the blandness encountered by the previous chef. Straining is a must -- not that I did.

Nice texture, beautiful presentation, but kind of bland. I may try making it again using chicken broth instead of water.
