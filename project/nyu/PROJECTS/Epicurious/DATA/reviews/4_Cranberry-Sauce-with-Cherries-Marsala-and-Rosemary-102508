Hit at Thanksgiving this year!

Best. Cranberries. Ever. I've been making it for years - pretty sure if I showed up without this I would be turned away from the Thanksgiving table. Put it on waffles Friday morning, if you have any left over. And it *does* make a great pie - I've used it as a pie filling, by adding cornstarch.

Excellent!! Will be the traditional Thanksgiving cranberry sauce on my table from now on.

This recipe was a real hit for Thanksgiving and I will make it a tradition. After reviewing a similar recipe and user reviews, I revised by using 1/4 cup dried tart cherries with 1/4 cup of dried cranberries (instead of just the dried tart cherries). Also, I did not add the minced rosemary, opting instead to add three whole sprigs of fresh rosemary which I removed after simmering. Frozen cherries were hard to locate, finally found them at Ralph's & rinsed them so they were thawed enough to cut in half. Per one reviewers suggestion I used Trader Joe's dried cherries. This is an easy to make, outstanding cranberry sauce that your guests will love!!

Absolutely delicious. I doubled the recipe and made this with a few more frozen dark cherries by using both bags and reduced the brown sugar by 1/2 cup. I also added two whole sprigs of rosemary near the end of cooking on the stove, which I simmered for about 30 minutes longer than the recipe specified. I refrigerated the sauce for a few days before serving it. Some friends stated that never really liked cranberry sauce but loved this. It would be a great jam or pie filling or even to serve with brie.

I always get rave reviews on this cranberry sauce. My father keeps half the recipe just for himself! When I didn't have Marsala available, I just used whatever dry, red wine I had on hand. I also used pumpkin pie spice in place of allspice with very good results. Each time I made it though, I ended up boiling and simmering it for much longer. Yet, my results were still terrific.

I have been making this Cranberry Sauce every Thanksgiving since 1999 when I first saw it in Bon Appetit. Every year I introduce it to someone new at my Thanksgiving Dinner and they always leave wanting the recipe. I look forward to enjoying it every year too!

This is delicious. My family requests it every year. The best part though, is that the leftovers (if there are any) are even better as an appetizer at Christmas. I freeze any leftovers and then serve them baked over a brie wheel, or simply room temp over a block of cream cheese, with crackers. Yum!

My go-to for Thanksgiving and any other opportunity I can find. Dried Montmorency cherries from Trader Joes'work great for this. Definitely make ahead for maximum flavor.

Rating: 4
Every time I make this it all goes. I have used canned cherries and dried cranberries with the same success. I have also added an envelope of gelatin and molded the sauce. I've used fresh rosemary and dry. It is difficult to imagine any other cranberry sauce recipe tempting me away from this one. I love it! I've served it with all kinds of roast meats, turkey, lamb, pork...mmm, I think it's time to make it again!

This is the best cranberry sauce ever! The alcohol gets completely cooked out, so shouldn't be a problem for non-drinkers. If so, consider using sparkling cider and a large splash of good balsamic.

Rating: 4
I've made this several times and it's always delicious! The only change I make is to use a sprig of rosemary after you boil the cranberries then remove it after it cools.

I have made this recipe for many years now. Whenever I do Thanksgiving, it the single most requested recipe I receive. My wife hates commercial cranberry sauce and loves this. It has also become my father's favorite cranberry sauce. The only change I have made over the years is that I occasionally add orange zest. It's great either way!

I've made this every year for the past few years. It's amazing. It tastes best if made a couple days in advance.

I'd like very much to make this for Thanksgiving this year but my AA mom prefers to eat alcohol free foods. Any suggestions for what I could use to replace? Water? Grape juice?

This is the best sauce ever - even my kids love it. The one problem I had the first time I made it was that the sauce was much too sweet. I was able to successfully adjust the sweetness with lemon juice (and it tasted amazing). In subsequent years I have made the sauce with only 2/3 cup of brown sugar to begin with. I then add brown sugar or lemon juice to get the taste I want. I suspect that I've been using cheaper and sweeter Marsala wine than others out there, but I don't mind saving the money, and it tastes incredible in the end!

This is a new standard for our family's Thanksgiving table! It is so good - everyone had seconds and some had thirds. The only thing I changed was to use half the rosemary. I was concerned about it at first because it's not my favorite herb, but it was the perfect compliment to the other ingredients.

Rating: 1
The first time, I made this recipe exactly as stated. The rosemary was overpowering and the brown sugar gave it a strange flavor. The second time, I made a half recipe and put 2 rosemary sprigs in with the dried cherries and marsala (tossed them before mixing in remaining ingredients), and used white sugar instead of brown. I then made a full basic cranberry sauce recipe (with just a small squeeze of fresh orange juice) and mixed the two recipes. It was delicious! Even the cranberry sauce haters in the group loved it.

I really enjoyed this sauce. The wine actually mellowed the tartness of the cranberries and gave it a more depth of flavor as did the dark cherries. Reviewers that said that 2 cups of wine was too much and their sauce was to runny must not have reduced the wine as it says in the recipe. The sauce was nice and thick. Even though I really enjoyed it my guests were not as delighted with it as I was. Hard to find a cranberry sauce that makes everyone happy.

Rating: 4
The entire family loved this recipe. My father was eating it by the spoonfuls! We thought the flavors had the right balance of sweet and savory. It has become a must-serve at our Thanksgiving table. Getting a good Dry Marsala is key. I found that making it 2 days ahead enhances the flavors and it tastes even better.

This was intoxicatingly delicious! Would not change a thing.

Although this recipe was fair, it in no way compares with the cranberry sauce with port and figs. I found the 2 cups of Marsala overpowering, and the proportion of dried cherries to cranberries needs to be smaller. Also, the allspice was unnecessary. I guess that's it. We'll stick with the standby port and fig recipe.

Another cranberry sauce hater converted! Truely, this dish was amazing - with a perfect balance of flavors. Usually cranberry sauce is too sweet and syrupy. I just made this for Thanksgiving, and ALL 6 guests had seconds (myself included!) - I couldn't belive it. The addition of cherries makes the sauce different without being over the top. I must confess, I did not add the rosemary - did some tastetests after it cooked; my husband said he could go either way with the rosemary but i preferred it slightly without.

Rating: 4
This is the best cranberry sauce ever! I make it every year and have a couple changes to offer. I only use 1 1/2 cups of marsala, otherwise it is too watery. Also, make sure you don't use too many cherries, it overpowers the cranberries.

Rating: 4
This recipe was AMAZING! It had so many flavors going on and it seemed very gourmet. I forgot to buy rosemary but it still turned out great. I added a teaspoon of butter at the very end in order to make it nice and glossy. Usually recipes for jam-like things call for this. It really made the sauce glisten. Also I simmered it for longer than 8 minutes to make it thicker. I waited until it cooled a bit and put half in the blender to puree it. I mixed the puree back into the remaining half and it really made the sauce the perfect consistency. Not too chunky but not too smooth.

I normally despise cranberry sauce. A couple of years ago I made this for Thanksgiving and tried a few bites. It was love. I and all who eat it absolutely devour it. It is the best cranberry sauce around!

Just made this for the second time for this Thursday's Thanksgiving dinner - mmmmmm! Got rave reviews last year and this year already from spouse and me. I upped the rosemary (I don't find it overwhelming at all) and the allspice both, and reduced only 1 cup of the Marsala with the dried cherries, and it was still marvelous. Better the second day, as most of these things are. Definitely a holiday tradition in our house.

Made this dish for Thanksgiving, but had 3 other cranberry sauces and forgot to put this one out. It sat in the back of the refrigerator until christmas eve when I was roasting a pork loin stuffed with prunes and apples marinated in marsala. I was basting the loin with the remaining marsala but it looked rather ordinary. I dumped some of this sauce over the loin for the last 20 minutes of roasting, used the drippings for a gravy and added even more of the cranberry sauce to that. It was outstanding. Dont be limited by serving cranberry sauces with only poultry.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! I also made the 'Cranberry Sauce with Pinot Noir" as a backup (also very good), but this was a clear winner. The other one was better in combination with turkey, but this one stood by itself. This was a first attempt at homemade CS, and I'm pretty sure I won't be allowed to get away with the canned/jellied kind anymore. I basically followed this to the letter, with the exception of the whole rosemary sprigs idea previously mentioned and a little cornstarch at the end to help thicken (though I'm not totally sure that was necessary). The rosemary can be strong, so it's more subtle if not permanently mixed in.

Scrumptious!! Lush and yummy; so good that I made it three times the first holiday sdeason it appeared in print. It was more requested for seconds, for late-night snacking, and for "doggie bags" than any other part of the meal. Don't leave out the tart dried cherries.

I have made a lot of cranberry sauces over the years, but this is by far the BEST--everyone loved this! I used dried cranberries instead of cherries, and 2 cans of sweet black cherries drained/cut in half. As recommended by another reviewer, I infused the sauce with 2 4" stems of rosemary, then removed them after cooking. I only used 1/8 tsp allspice. You will not be disappointed with this sauce!

Best cranberry sauce we've ever had. Next time I might cut back on the rosemary and the marsala but only a tiny tad as both flavors deserve to be there. Did not have any issue with it being too watery. Anyway just reduce it to desired consistency if that's a problem.

Definately a keeper! I have been assigned providing this for all future holidays. Savory and not overpowering sweet or too tart. Was a big hit. I added some corn starch to give it body and it was perfect.

The rosemary flavor is an intriguing and delicious twist on regular cranberry sauce, and the cherries give this a bit of a sweeter flavor than most cranberry sauces, so this might be a good one to make for people who complain that cranberries are too tart. My only criticism would be that this sauce is extremely juicy, to the point where the juices were spreading out over the entire plate. I would either reduce the sauce even more or maybe strain it next time.

This is a terrific cranberry sauce. I couldn't stop eating the sauce and wound up pouring a little over vanilla ice cream. I used 1 cup of marsala which was enough to give it the extra flavor. Can't wait for Thanksgiving again. Yum!!

What a great cranberry sauce! Many of our guests at Thanksgiving commented that it was the best cranberry sauce they've ever tasted. I liked it because it was intense and complex in flavor, but not like a cranberry relish where you can only take a little bit once a year. Hands down, this is the best cranberry sauce I have ever eaten. Mmmmmmmm!

Excellent! My alterations: dried cranberries instead of cherries;less sugar and allspice. Add 1 tsp of orange zest at the end. For a less strong rosemary flavor I just added a whole stem of rosemary into mixture as it was thickening and then removed it after.

I make a different cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving every year, and this was by far the biggest hit. Everyone loved it, including my pre-adolescent niece who hates everything. I highly recommend making it several days before you are going to eat it; the rosemary flavor is pretty overwhelming on day one but mellows nicely with age.

I made two cranberry sauces this Thanksgiving. I think the Cranberry-Port conserve was better with the turkey. This recipe would be better with a pork roast or ham. I also will add the frozen sweet cherries near the end to maintain their shape. The cranberries I feel are over powered by the cherries. It has a very good flavor but when compared to the other cranberry recipe.. everyone went for the cranberry-port conserve.

I made this recipe for last year's Thanksgiving Day dinner. People flipped. My wife, who hates cranberry sauce, had seconds. My father kept asking for more. I wondered if I had accidentally spilled something addictive into it. We had a party for twenty the next day, so I ended up having to make another large batch, which also got gobbled up. It's ideal for those who prefer something more savory than overly sweet! KGGourmet

This smells so good when cooking. I just loved the taste of the sauce - rich and different. I substituted 1/2 dried cranberries for the dried cherries to cut the cost. I also made another batch and froze for gifts at Thanksgiving and Christmas with great success. Will become a family recipe for sure!

I substituted a raspberry wine from Bonnie Doon Vineyards for the Marsala and it came out great.
