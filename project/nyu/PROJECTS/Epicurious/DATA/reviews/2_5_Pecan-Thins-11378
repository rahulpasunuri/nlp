Ok, I have re-read this recipe 4 times. I did everything exactly as listed, using just a bit less butter as suggested in the previous reviews. I only got 15 cookies, they are not crisp but sort of limp and very unattractive. Was I supposed to whip the egg whites first?? Can't figure out what went so wrong...

This cookie is very flavorful and particlarly enjoyable served with ice cream.

I used the called for ingredients, only added a few more pecans. I topped each cookie with a halved pecan...they were very flavorful!

These cookies are wonderful. A pleasant treat with a flan or custard or an espresso coffee. My family loved them.

I really think these are wonderful. Thanks to previous reviewers, I used a bit less butter and they came out perfectly. Nice and thin and crisp. I buttered wax paper and put that over my cookie sheet, and it was simple to get the thins off that. I'd definitely make these again. Loved them.

Delicious, not very attractive. but they were all gone before they cooled so who says looks are everything.

I took the advice of the other review I read and used a bit less butter than called for. The cookies were thin and crispy; and my friend said she'd pay me $10 to make them again for her!

These cookies were easy to make and had good flavor but I was expecting a light, crispy cookie and they were actually soft and moist. I would recommend using a little less butter.
