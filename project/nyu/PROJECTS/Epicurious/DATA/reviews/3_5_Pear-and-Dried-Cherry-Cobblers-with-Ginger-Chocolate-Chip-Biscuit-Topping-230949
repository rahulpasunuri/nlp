I've tried a couple of the pear cobbler recipes on this site and this is my favorite so far. The chocolate chips in the buttermilk crust really make this dish. The hint of ginger really topped things off, making this a winner. Will make again.

Yum yum yum! I too would leave out the chocolate (or use really small bits if you leave in) and add more ginger. Was a surprisingly easy yet classy looking (and delicious) dessert!

Made this as the desert for an elegant dinner, and it made for a very happy ending. Made it as one large cobbler in a baking dish, not in separate ramekins, and it was fine. Because one of my guests was diabetic, I substituted Splenda for sugar and nobody knew the difference. The chocolate bits are an interesting addition. They pop up as a surprise . This could be made without the chocolate, but they do add a little interest to the recipe.

This is a fabulous dessert, and gets rave reviews every time I serve it. But I've never put the chocolate chips in; they just don't sound like they'd go with it. I'm really surprised that it doesn't have a higher rating for "would make it again".

My guests, like NRLong's, were demonstratively impressed in their own way although they were too stuffed to finish theirs (didn't pace themselves during the hors d'oeuvres course, tsk tsk). I used Bosc pears and those little Pyrex bowls with scalloped edges that you can buy by the pack. I followed the recipe but might add a little more ginger next time - what I had on hand had been lying around (in a closed container) for a month or so. This nice thing about the dessert-in-separate-dishes concept is that you will not be likely to overstuff yourself by eating the leftovers out of your guests' dishes.

WOW! Made this tonight and it really hit the spot! (Especially nice since I was worried about it with the hesitant comments people have been leaving--I was half expecting disaster!) Changes I made: I used apples instead of pears. I cut the sugar in both parts to 1/4 cup. I put it all in a 7 or 8 inch round pan (it took about 35 minutes to bake that way). It was FABULOUS. Yummmm!

This dish was OK...the best part was the cobbler crust with the chocolate chips! I made it in one big 9x13 pan instead of the ind. dishes and it came out fine. The ginger in this dish was weird and not needed in my opinion. My guests said that they could not even taste it, but I could. I would leave it out if I made this again...but I probably won't - there are too many other REALLY good desserts out there to waste your time on something so-so.

Made this for a potluck Christmas dinner and it was hands down the favorite dessert of the bunch, against some pretty stiff competition. Easy to do, with the unusual topping adding a nice gingery bite to what might otherwise have been a very ordinary dish. Definitely a keeper!

We made this for Thanksgiving, and thought that the filling didn't go with the biscuit topping--it seemed like a chocolate chip cookie was sitting on a traditional fall filling, which was wierd. I'd do the filling again with a regular crust on top.

If the title alone appeals to you you'll love the outcome. It was sweet and crunchy and it knocks down one of your recommended daily minimum of fruit servings. ;)

I made this recipe for seven people for dinner last night and everybody was blown away. They all fell on the floor and kicked their feet in the air, swooning. The only problem was indeed that the portions are very large and after a meal it is hard to finish a dessert this size. It was easy to make and DELICIOUS. DO TRY IT.

One of the best cobblers I've ever made -- or tasted -- ever! I baked this as a whole cobbler, forgoing the individual souffle cups, and got a very soft, almost runny topping in the middle. No matter -- the ginger/pear/chocolate combination was wonderfully pungent and perfectly proportioned. I wouldn't substitute anything for the crystallized ginger, which lends such a sweet, sharp taste. My husband, who's not much interested in pears, suggested peaches next time. Sounds reasonable, but this was a really stunning dessert.

Did not make but am dying to, however husband does not like cherries. Any ideas out there what to substitute???

What a wonderful, rich fall dessert. I substituted powdered ginger in 1 and 1½ tsp amounts for the crystalized ginger and it was just right. It filled 6 custard cups and was too much for some guests. Yum!

I baked this in one dish rather than custard cups which would have given 4 very large portions. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I am a huge fan of ginger of any kind (which attracted me to this recipe in the first place) but I felt that it added nothing to the recipe and would leave it out if I made this again. There are enough different flavors with the pears, cherries, and choc chips and the ginger competes with these rather than enhancing them. The biscuit topping was tasty and light, and had just the right amount of chocolate. Serve with vanilla ice cream or unsweetened whipped cream to balance the sweetness.
