Don't bother. This is a quick recipe but it needs more flavor and less oil. I will not make this again.

Simple, delicious, and quick. A perfect weeknight meal.

I live in Mexico so I added some of the very thick cream sold here (it's almost like crème fraîche) to the sauce and it was absolutely delicious. My two kids (6 and 9) gobbled it up!
