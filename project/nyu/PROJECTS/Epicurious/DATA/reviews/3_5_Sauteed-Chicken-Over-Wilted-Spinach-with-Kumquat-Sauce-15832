I did make a few minor substitutions to suit my on-hand ingredients, but the results were really good. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of skin-on breasts and chard instead of spinach. This will definitely stay on our recipe rotation for the next time we get kumquats in our CSA box!

This was great. I even made it with leftover chicken breast, and it was still amazing. If you have more kumquats, though, definitely add them. I put in 8. They were scrumptious and not at all overwhelming. Loved it.

Easy and delicious. I added a bit of grated ginger at the end after tasting the sauce to add a bit more complexity, and ended up using more kumquats than the recipe called for, since 3 looked skimpy. I followed the advice of other reviewers to lightly flour the chicken, which worked great.

I make this every year when we pick our kumquats and its always a favorite. I agree that the spinach is a little meager - it wilts down to nothing. I actually added a little more sugar, but my husband loves sweet chicken! Perfect with some white rice. This recipe is really versatile - It's so quick and easy, yet elegant and unique enough to serve to company. I've multplied the recipe by 6 to feed a crowd or left as is for us, and either way, its always great. The only substitution I make is using skinless chicken breasts - and I'm not at all sure why it would need the extra fat.

A friend of a friend made this for me several years ago, so I was excited to find it again. I'm surprised no one else experienced this, but I didn't seem to have enough sauce to wilt all of the spinach let alone spoon over the chicken. I'm thinking next time I'll just add more water possibly. I'm not quite sure. Maybe I let too much cook off, but not much time passed at all. Regardless, it was delicious, and we loved it. I'll try again with some tweaking.

Delicious. Made as directed - needed no adjustments. Simple enough for weekday meal but tasty and elegant enough to serve to guests.

Great flavor. Theonly thing I would say is it needs more spinach and a bit more sauce

It would have merited 4 forks except for the sugar. I used 2 tsp of sugar, given what other reviewers said, and it was wonderful. I've been looking for non-dessert kumquat recipes, this is a keeper.

Very nice sauce, although I agree that a little less sugar would make it better. Works fine with boneless skinless breasts.

Very good. I may also cut back the sugar just a tad as it was a little too sweet for my taste.

This was a great dish! It was quick to prepare and full of flavor. The pepper flakes gave it a nice warmth, without being hot. The only thing I would do different would be to cut the sugar in half. It was too sweet for my tastes, but my guests loved it and made me give them the recipe.

Very good and EASY! I might reduce the vinegar a little next time. I used a Chardonnay vinegar which might have been a bit more pungent than regular white vinegar. Otherwise, a definite hit!

Fabulous. Even better made with rock cornish game hens.

Delicious, special and easy. I distributed the leftover kumquats from the pint I bought along with the recipe to all the cooks in my office!

I used skinless chicken breast and seared them in the pan for five minutes on each side. Meat was surface crisp and results were delicious. Best of all was the ease of putting this dish together. Very good taste.

Loved this dish, which I served with rice. Didn't change a thing. I doubled the recipe and the leftovers were really terrific two days later. I just happened to come back from a Florida trip with a bag of kumquats so I had them on hand. Now I'm really sorry I didn't bring back more.

This is nice as a variation on boring old chicken. I substituted red chard for the spinach and it made the dish even more colorful!

This is a great recipe. It's delicious and very easy to make. We have a kumquat tree, so I was looking for kumquat recipes. I would recommend them, if you have them, for the recipe because the rind is sweet unlike other citrus. Will definitely make this again. As my husband said, "Yum Yum."

Both my husband and are are good cooks, but seldom have time for elaborate recipes. This was delicious and QUICK. Couldn't find kumquats, so I subbed w/ mandarin oranges. Used balsamic vinegar and cilantro, as I had it on hand. Excellant! Will definately do again.

Would give this 3.5 forks. Delicious, different and easy! This went wonderfully with rice.

Nice combination of flavors. Key point is to make sure you nicely brown and crisp the skin. Goes well with rice as a side dish.
