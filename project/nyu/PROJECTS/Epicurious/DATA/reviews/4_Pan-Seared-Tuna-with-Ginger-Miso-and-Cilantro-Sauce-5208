This was some crazy good fish!! Could not afford the red ahi so we used yellowfin tuna. Our guests were amazed. The sauce was very flavorful; we served it with some steamed Asian noodles. Great recipe.

How queer. No frozen orange juice in the house, but frozen passionfruit concentrate, yes. I took a gamble with the passionfruit, and it was a lovely substitute. This smelled very vinegary as it was reducing, but it mellowed out just right when I added the miso + cilantro. I skipped the marinade, since I had a sushi-grade cut. This was a great healthy meal I'll make again and again.

Used flounder instead of tuna and followed tuna marinade recipe. Fish broke up a bit was fine as we put over pad thai-style noodles and turned into a bit of a noodle dish. Doubled the sauce recipe. Shortcut was to use the frozen cilantro cubes that they sell at Whole Foods. Also, substituted the rice vinegar w/ red wine vinegar and it was fine and onion powder for shallots (I didn't have on hand). You will really love the strong flavors in this dish!

Really yummy mixture of flavors. I will totally make this again!

I couldnt find an acceptable hunk of tuna for this, so I used salmon and it was tremendous! I almost passed on the cilantro but am glad that I didnt as its sharp, brightness perfectly counterpointed the earthiness of the miso and the tangy sweetness of the orange. As another reviewer noted, all the individual flavors really hold their own in this sauce. I was perplexed by all of the bad reviews until I noticed that most of the negative comments on the sauce are from folks who substituted soy sauce for the miso. The two are not interchangeable. My deviations: I grilled the salmon on a cedar plank and substituted fresh OJ for the concentrate. I also added sambal oelek (fresh, ground chile paste) to the marinade and sauce (because its just who I am) and I served the fish on a bed of quinoa with sugar snap peas on the side. Raves all round. On the morning after, I used the leftover fish to make a smoked salmon, leek, and dill frittata from this site and topped the frittata with the remaining sauce. Devine!

Don't bother with the sauce, just marinate with the lemon, soy sauce and pepper, and pan sear.

I agree w/ the cook from Ft. Myers--I did not think this was very good. I think it's too much sesame oil.

Well, I'm reluctant to be the naysayer in a sea of good reviews, but I hated this. I made it exactly according to the recipe. I hated the sauce! We had the same tuna the following night and it was fine, but with a different sauce. My husband wasn't fond of it either. We have liked miso flavored things in the past and cilantro is almost used daily in our house, so I'm not sure where we went wrong.

I did use fresh orange juice and added minced orange rind and its surprizing that all of the flavors were very distinct and played off of each other. Perhaps I had an exceptional piece of tuna, but it was one of the best tuna recipes I've eaten. And yes...more cilantro!

Rating: 3
Great with wild salmon. Makes more sauce than needed--- could cut sauce recipe in half. Also suggest using fresh squeezed OJ enriched with lots of grated orange rind in place of OJ concentrate. As a cilantro lover, I would also suggest using about 10X the amount called for in recipe.

This was great. My husband calls it his new favorite (salmon with chili-mango salsa on this site used to be his Sunday staple)! I seared the bluefin tuna on the grill for about 1 minute per side. I used miso but I can't imagine that soy would work nearly as well? The sauce was great on the brown rice and asparagus sides too.

I'm not a big fan of rice, but this sauce is SO good, I devoured the tuna and the rice. Fast, easy, excellent recipe.

The fish turned out excellent. We also followed the same idea and marinated and cooked tofu as well. It did not compare to the fish, but it is a useful thing with you associate with vegetarians.

This was my first time cooking with tuna steaks, and I cooked them medium-rare as most of the other reviews suggested, and they steaks themselves were fabulous. The ginger, miso, and cilantro sauce was absolutely terrible, though, but based on the other reviews I am thinking perhaps I did something wrong?? I followed the recipe for it exactly, although I subsituted soy sauce for the miso, but the flavors just did not meld well...

Rating: 4
this fish was outstanding! i found the sauce to be a bit too salty and will probally try low salt soy next time vs. the expense of a block of miso which was the smallest i could find. what will i do with all that leftover miso? also, i can't tolerate ginger and shallots without garlic so added it generously to the sauce which added alot of flavor.

followed the advice of the cook who added wasabi, sherry and fresh oj....great.

This is by far the best tuna recipe I've come across. Tasted better than anything I've eaten in a restaurant. This is very easy to make, and the sauce can be prepared ahead of time...perfect dish to serve when entertaining - guests will be very impressed. I served with white rice, but think it will be even better with a wild rice mix.

This was one of the best fish recipes I've ever made. I used tilapia rather than tuna, and cooked it until it was just cooked through. I also used a little bit of light olive oil rather than the cooking spray. Can hardly wait to make it again!

I made this dish for a small dinner party of four. I could not find miso so I used soy sauce instead and it was still delicious. A nice easy recipe and quick too!! I recommend wasabi mashed potatoes as a side.

Great Recipe! I teamed it up with a recipe that was also for Tuna but I jsut used it for the Green Beans ASIAN-FLAVORED SEARED TUNA WITH GREEN BEANS Great combo! Yum! A keeper

This was extremely easy to make. I made the sauce as suggested and like another reviewer added a little wasabi and chili garlic sauce to the mixure. Process the sauce in a food mixer for the best texture. Everyone raved about this recipe. I will defintely make this again!

I made this last night and the tuna was perfect! The secret with the sauce is to not put too much over the fish, otherwise it is too salty. Although I thought this was pretty good, I like some of the other recipes for tuna on this site better than this one.

This was absolutely amazing. We followed the recipe exactly and loved it. Although we seared the tuna too long so that it was cooked through. It was still good.

This recipe was delicious. Be sure to not cook tuna too long. I served it with corn on the cob and sliced tomatoes from our garden. A great and easy meal. This is a keeper

Made it with salmon - very simple, elegant and yummy. A great recipe, but only if you really like citrus - the sauce has a very strong sweet citrus flavor. Omitting the sauce and just having the marinated fish would be fine too for a nice light summer meal.

The fish was great. The sauce is ok.

Good sauce - we could taste everything that was in it (I used fresh oj instead of concentrate). We served this with a side of arugula, and the sauce was great on the arugula. But 3 MINUTES IS TOO LONG TO COOK THE TUNA. I recommend cookingonly a minute or so, because tuna should be rare or med rare.

We love tuna and have cooked it many times but this was far to salty. We cut the sesame oil in half but it was still too much. There are many great recipes for tuna - this is not one of them.

Somethings are missing in the recipe. We added two tablespoons of white miso and it worked great.

This recipe fully deserves the 3 and 4 forks awarded it. Easy to put together, too. Take care not to overcook the tuna.

I marinated sushi-grade tuna overnight and seared it to a medium doneness. Wonderful! By far the moistest ahi I've made. Ginger sauce was a bit salty, though I used a low-sodium soy sauce in place of miso. Got rave reviews for taste and appearance - got my husband to eat fish (no small task.) We tried it over udon, excellent neutral compliment. Will definitely make it again.

I don't see what everyone is so gung-ho about, this isn't that good. I would give it a 2 1/2, not just a two and not a three. Easy, yes, but really not that great. Sorry.

I made this dish for three of my favorite people, my husband and our two best friends. We BBQ'd the Ahi rather than panfried, cooked approx. 3 min. a side. Perfect! The sauce was absolutely delicious. I served it with Wasabi Mashed Potatoes and even put the sauce over the potatoes.

If you love citrus, this is a fantastic recipe! I loved it! I made it for a "date night" with my boyfriend and he was raving about it all night long! I've since tried this with chicken and salmon. Thanks!

excellent dish! Everybody wanted the recipe. This is the easiest dish to prepare. The sauce took approximately 5 minutes to prepare and I seared the tuna for 1.5 minutes on each side. Can it be any simpler?

The first time we made this, we used tuna and seared it on the grill. The next time, we used skinned salmon fillets and pan-seared. Both preparations were great.

Thank you for this recipe! It was fabulous; when visiting my favorite fresh fish store, I saw fresh tuna on sale, which is usually too expensive. Found this recipe, tried it, we all loved it. Had all ingredients on my shelf except for the miso--couldn't find it at supermarket & used the soy sauce substitute. To us, it is a restaurant-quality dish. The sauce is luscious.

Superb! I followed suggestions to make sauce first and served with wasabi mashed potatoes. I don't know about shiitake flavoring (potato suggestion) so I just folded in sauteed shiitakes. Restaurant quality meal.

I had a house guest from the midwest who requested that I help her stick to her Weight Watchers diet, not overwhelm her with "unusual" foods, and introduce her to some sources of soy protein. She loved this! I served it with Super Slaw and edamame. My godmother no longer fears my fancy cooking. My mom was disturbed that fish could start out red. Otherwise they raved. Feel free to serve it to your most finicky eaters.

Made this dish for 8 at a dinner party and they raved. Superb. Recommend serving with wasabi flavored mashed potatoes (I also used shiitake flavoring) and encrusting tuna in sesame seeds.

Great recipe. Served it with Japanese sticky rice. Great sauce, too. Three forks for taste, four for ease, but two for cost. Any suggestions for a cheaper fish? It was great with tuna, but not quite as good with snapper. Might work to halve the tuna steaks and substitute in some shiitake mushrooms.

This was a delicious recipe. I do agree with the earlier account of making the sauce prior to cooking the ahi. I served this up with the recipe for Asian Spring Rolls with a soy-ginger dipping sauce. I also included orange juice, teriyaki sauce, rice wine and vinegar in the dipping sauce; this seemed to really bring out some lovely and savory flavors. This is certain to be a hit with anyone who enjoys a lot of flavor and can appreciate the tenderness of ahi tuna.

This is a delicious recipe, however I would change the preparation instructions by making the Ginger Miso Cilantro sauce 1st - this way, the tuna doesn't overcook while it stays warm. By the time I had finished the sauce, my tuna steaks weren't medium-rare any longer but cooked through. Not good. The flavors were fantastic however. I'd like to try the sauce with chicken, shrimp or pork next time.

Great with any firm fleshed fish, pan seared or on the grill. The marinade is also good with grilled shrimp.

This dish is very tasty - I highly recommend it. Seek out the miso paste, as it lends key flavor to the sauce. If you live in the West and have access to a Trader Joe's, I use their frozen ahi steaks, which work quite well and are cheaper than fresh.

Every time I make this dish it amazes me how easy it is to make. The flavors are very interesting and the use of miso for taste but also as a thickening agent is very judicious.
