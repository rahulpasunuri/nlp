I love this recipe! Made it for my parents and my husband one night and received rave reviews. My husband said he didn't want brownies any other way from then on! Later I made it for some friends who have slightly picky children, and the gobbled it up as well. Something about the smokey heat mixed with the not too sweet cherry flavor is amazing!

Very easy to make......everyone LOVED the Chipotle-Cherry Whipped Cream, since I made the cream everyone assumed I made the brownies :)

I had to add a bit more cherry and chipotle to this recipe to get any flavor at all, and once I did, it was pretty good. I loved spicy/sweet flavor combos, but I wouldn't necessarily use this for a party because I could see a lot of people not being so thrilled about it. By the way, I discovered Ghrildelli (sp) brownie mix.. SO GOOD!

Wow! I was hesitant because I knew my adobo sauce was quite spicy-hot, but I'm being brave this week. I was very pleasantly surprised! This was amazing, I could make a whole dessert just out of the whipped cream! I suspect a dash of cayenne would work as a substitute for the adobo. This had a beautiful cherry flavour and a very subtle heat that was extremely nice. I think it would be great in the summer on fresh fruit with a sparkling wine too (must try).

Excited to try this but cannot find canned chipotle adobe. For a party tonight so do not have time to make it from scratch. Any suggestions where to look?

This was good and very easy. I actually doubled the amount of adobo sauce and thought it was perfect.
