As others have said, start with this recipe and go from there. I put in a little extra potato and cabbage, and also added carrots, garlic, and bay leaves. Instead of regular vegetable broth, I used Imagine brand's "no chicken" vegetarian broth. I had never had borscht before, and was disappointed that it is not at all filling. I eat an average amount of food, and it takes three bowls in one sitting to make a light lunch. For that reason, I would recommend using full calorie sour cream. Also, don't expect to be able to eat this as a meal.

This is a good soup recipe but not outstanding. I pureed the whole recipe. Didn't add tomatoes but added more veggies and dill. I will play with this. Maybe add caraway.

Changes to the recipe: 4 small russet potatoes, doubled the amount of cabbage, 6 cups of beef broth (not vegetable) ,only 2 3-4" beets, Additions: 1 lb. stew beef sprinkled with salt & pepper, dredged in flour, seared and cooked several hours in crock pot to tenderize), 1 can of corn (niblets), 3-4 chopped carrots, 1 1/2 tsp sea salt, 1/2 tsp white pepper, 1 tsp dry dill. Use everything else in recipe as directed. DELICIOUS!!! With the addition of the beef, it makes a whole meal. Just add crusty bread.

This is a great base recipe. I doubled the amounts of potato, cabbage and beets. I also added carrots and garlic. The second time I made the soup I used beef broth which was much tastier than the vegetable broth. Added dill and bay leaf while simmering, and the soup was a hit!

Makes a substantial quantity. Too much for two people. Definitely serve with sour cream and lime.

I cooked a big pot tonight to celebrate our Siberian-like weather here in the Midwest. Tweaked the Borscht by adding carrots, extra beets, potatoes, onions and vegetable bouillon. So delicious!

Amazing! Loved it! I didn't change a thing. It was so easy and just perfect for a cold New England day.

I thought the beet tops were ok with lots of lemon, but my husband loved them (he loves collard greens, I don't - the beet tops definitely head in that direction) The borscht, though, was lovely! I'd been looking for a recipe that was sour rather than too sweet, and this is a nice basic one. I added rice vinegar at the end, about a Tbsp per bowl, and of course the lemon wedge and lots of fresh ground black pepper. Very good.

I added carrots, two bay leaves (I don't like bland), and two T white vinegar (forgot to pick up lemons). I left out the tomatoes and added 6 cups onion and beef broth. Blended, but left some larger pieces of vegetable. Finally, a dollup of plain yoghurt and fresh dill. Yum! I know I changed this recipe a lot...not sure if it even counts as reviewing the same recipe, but it was very good! I think it would have been too plain for me if I hadn't tinkered.

As other reviewers suggested, I added more veggies: ~ 8 beets, 2 carrots, whole small cabbage. I also decreased the liquid to about 6 cups of 1/2 broth 1/2 water (instead of 8 cups), added a few tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and lots of salt! I did not puree the final soup, and I would normally add dill as that's more typical of borscht but I didn't have any and the parsley was actually pretty good. With the sour cream, this borscht was delicious!!

This turned out to be a wonderful and thick soup. I also added corn, carrots, soy beans and whole basil leaves after the soup was blended. Overall... Delicious!!!

I have made this three times, with and without the tomatoes. Loved it each way. Grating the beets, cabbage and onions in a food processor makes for easy work, just chopped the potatoes as was recommended by others and did not blend. It is even better the next day. Served with a dollop of sour cream and fresh dill.

Maybe I'm not a big enough borscht fan, but this recipe was okay and not more. I tried this recipe because I was looking for ideas for using local seasonal produce I had from our CSA - potatoes, cabbage, and beets. I should have roasted the beets for salad and made colcannon with the cabbage and potatoes instead. Oh well, live and learn. The soup wasn't terrible, it just wasn't that great. FWIW, I left the veggies in chunks and did add the tomatoes, but like others, I can't say that the tomato flavor came through. I should have added bay leaves or something to build some more depth of flavor.

Tasty soup - even those who swear they hate beets will try and probably like this one; however, I agree with other reviewers that advise not to blend the soup. I tried it both ways and everyone agreed veggie chunks with broth was better than a puree mixture of any ratio. Also, tomatoes were an odd addition and I found the robustness of the beets to outdo any flavoring the tomatoes may have added.

Great recipe and made some changes, used veggie broth from veggie stock, vegemite, added yams instead of potatoes,sauteed garlic, garam masala & cumin...so good!

this was awesome! we decided not to blend as we preferred chunkiness and actually let it simmer on low for an hour and a half... (went out for pre borscht burger!)- also added dill at the end.

this was quite good. needed more potato and cabbage - i'll double these next time. i used a combination of green and purple cabbage. it would be easier to give the amount of beets in weight instead of a number. (this recipe has about 3 pounds with leaves attached). i will make this again.

I incorporated many of the reviewers' suggestions, and the soup was delicious. I substituted beef broth for the vegetable broth, and I grated all the beets, potatoes, and one bag of carrots (which I added) in a food processor. This prevented me from needing to do any blending. I also doubled the cabbage. I used crushed tomatoes, as that was all I could find, and added a little extra to the soup for added moisture. Finally, I served the borscht with dill, instead of parsley. My husband and I both enjoyed it greatly; he suggested that I chop, rather than grate, the potatoes next time so that they stand out a little more from the rest of the vegetables.

Yum! A delicious, basic recipe, very accommodating of modifications. I skipped the tomatoes, used about half stock, half water, added some white beans for bulk and chopped up tons of fresh dill. Oh, and a few cloves of garlic, roughly chopped. Didn't bother to puree it. Amazing borscht, great taste and texture.

Delicious and easy to make. Canned tomatoes seemed superfluous, so I omitted them. Also, the soup is so much better if you do not puree it. My son and I tried it both ways, pureed, and non-pureed with just the cut-up vegetables in that deep red broth, and we both agreed that the latter method is best. I topped off the bowls with a dollop of creme fraiche instead of the low-fat sour cream, and substituted dill for the parsley. Served to 8 friends at a luncheon and they all absolutely loved it.

As I am pregnant, I was craving vegetarian borscht all day long today. After consulting this recipe and a russian cooking website, I made this version with a couple of changes. First of all, I omitted the canned broth. Next, I took half the beets and cut them into thin strips. I poured cold water over them and let them boil at a slow roll for about 10-15 minutes, or until they lose their color. This gives the borscht a brighter color, as well as eliminating the need for the broth by intensifying the flavor. Meanwhile, I shredded the rest of the beets and all the other veggies + carrots (i don't know why the recipe is missing this vital ingredient). I added the potatoes and cabbage to the boiling pot. At the same time I sauteed the onions and carrots in a heavy skillet. Then I added the rest of the shredded beets, and once they were soft, added a tbsp of tomato paste and a bit of the cooking liquid from the pot and let it infuse for about 10 more minutes. After that was done, I added the mixture to the soup pot and let it boil for another 5 minutes, or until the cabbage and potatoes were tender. Then it was time for the dill. And the results were fantastic! My craving was satisfied (at least for the evening) and the best part is that I will have delicious leftovers for at least a couple of more days. Borscht is always better the next day :)

I've been making this borscht for years now; it is among our favorite soups. My method has evolved a bit over time to include the following tweaks: increase the vegetables, and most importantly, add lots of chopped fresh dill.

I loved this soup. I tweaked it only a bit by adding a couple of carrots and the chopped beet-top greens. Grated lemon zest on top of the sour cream is a lovely lightening touch. I didn't puree the soup either. Yummy!

I like beets and I like borscht, but I didn't think this soup was very good. Wasn't worth the trouble.

Loved it. I wanted to make borscht because of how delicious it was when I had it in Russian restaurants in Europe, and I was not disappointed. Delicious beyond compare. I did not puree, used crushed tomatos instead of sliced, and it came out great. In my opinion, perfection was achieved by adding salt, sugar, and white vinegar to taste.

Wow - what a great borscht. It was a hit with everyone who sampled it, and I think I made just about everyone try it. I used beef broth for the base however, and I did not puree my soup at all. Also I added a cup of tomato juice! Great!

Yum -- this was great! I took the advice of the others and used less broth and more veggies. I used baby beets and Walla Walla sweet onions picked fresh at the little farm down the hill from me, and I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. I didn't puree the soup, because I like "peasant-style" soups. This was fantastic and really highlighted the fresh, sweet veggies I used. I will definitely make this again soon.

This is a very yummy, hearty soup. My final product was great but like others I made a few subtle changes to the recipe...I dissolved 2 Knorr beef boullion cubes for my broth but only used 3cups of water. I added 1 small can of diced tomatoes with all its liquid. I then used 2c cabbage, 2-4inch beets, 1 potato, 1 carrot and 1 parsnip all chopped. For seasoning I added 1 large minced clove of garlic and a 1/2 tsp or so each of fresh cracked salt & pepper. Then I added one huge TBone steak bone from my freezer and simmered it slowly for about 1hour. I did not puree any of it - I prefer the rustic look...the potato melted into the soup and seemed to thicken it up quite nicely...at the end I added 1tbsp of butter and a squish of fresh lemon. Hot or cold this was a wonderfully rich soup - I served it with a dollup of sour cream and parsley sprig for color (cause its the only herb still alive in my garden right now) I will definately be making this one again & again!

This is a great soup as written, but I think even more delicious with some changes/additions. The first time I made it I had fresh beets with tops, so I chopped the beet tops and added to the other ingredients - I have since subbed with fresh spinach. Also added 3 large carrots diced, some garlic powder and a dash or two of ground cloves. For liquid I used 6 cups vegetable broth and the liquid from the canned tomatoes. But the real key to outstanding flavour is fresh dill - a generous handful of fresh minced dill added during the last 10 minutes of cooking, and additional dill and finely grated lemon zest sprinkled on the sour cream just before serving. If you use dill, delete the parsley. Also, use the juice from 1 whole lemon - I have found the acid counteracts any over sweetness and adds another layer of flavour. So fresh tasting, so yummy, and other than the sour cream so very healthy. A lovely soup and a great change from the good old standby soups we seem to make over and again. Please try it, I'm sure you will be delighted. A definite keeper!

The previous suggestions were very helpful in terms of less liquid. The soup is also delicious cold with lots of seasoning. Will definately make it again!

This rocks! I added more pototoes and beets and less liquid as other reviewers suggested. A very tasy blend! And as one reviewer suggested, don't wear white! This is a very red concoction. Fresh dill sprinkled over the top was key.

IT WAS REALLY A GREAT DISH. MY GRANDPARENTS ARE RUSSIAN AND I GRE UP EATING HOT BORSHT. IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AS GOD W/O THE ADVICE OF ALL THE OTHER REVIEWERS, I TOOK ALL OF THE RECOMENDATIONS FROM THE OTHERS ADDING LESS BROTH, MORE BEETS, A WHOLE HEAD OF CABBAGE, FRESH LEMON JUICE, APPLE CIDER VINEGAR AND DILL UPON SERVING. IT WAS A BIG HIT. I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!

I increased the amount of potatoes, cabbage and beets slightly, but the consistency was still thin. No need to add extra broth. The flavor was a tad sweet, so I added more lemon juice and quite a bit of salt and pepper. Yes, this one is a keeper.

This was a really beuatiful dish and tasted fantastic. My fiancé had never tried borscht before, and he loved it. I would recommend adding a few tablespoons of cider or rice vinegar if you use fresh beets to give it a nice briny edge. Also, DON'T wear white while you prepare this, beets are a natural dye. ;)

I have made this recipe a few times and everyone has loved it. I have a tendency of putting a few more beets (~8)
