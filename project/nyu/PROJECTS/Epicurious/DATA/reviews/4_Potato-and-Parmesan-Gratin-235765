I was a little short of parmesan so supplemented with asiago. Next time I will probably cover casserole with foil for the first half of bake time. Top was browning before potatoes were tender. Overall, delicious; I will definitely make it again.

I halved this recipe for 4 adults and didn't like the quantities. I only made three layers. I used an 6X9" casserole dish and sprinkled 2T.of half & half; then then 1 layer of potatoes, 2T. half & half, 2T. parmesan, repeated twice then topped with 2T. half & half + 2T. parmesan. The result was great but could have used more liquid. The top was nice and browned and crispy and the flavor was great. It was only in the oven for 1 hour so it had to sit and wait for the rest of the dinner to catch up.

I used this recipe but added layers of onions and sliced baby bellas in between. It was a bit hit. Turned out wonderfully and I got many compliments.

Made this gratin with roasted leg of lamb with garlic and rosemary. It was a perfect side dish. Used high quality parmigiano-reggiano cheese. Simple ingredients with perfect bold flavors.

I've made this many times, with steaks or with turkey...and it's always a hit. You have to use good parmigiano!

I did use a grocery store parmesan, which could explain it's bad flavor. I served it at thanksgiving and everybody had some left on their plates when we went to clean up. It wasn't awful, just not great. I'll use gruyere next time ad I felt the parmesan was too strong.

Wonderful. My boyfriend begs for this on the weekends. I use my food processor to cut the potates and just use half-and -half.

This was a simple recipe that was very delicious. A wonderful alternative to cheddar augratin.
