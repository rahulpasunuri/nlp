Made this minus the mustard greens since I didn't have any. Excellent warm. Had it the next day cold with a dollup of plain lowfat yogurt and chopped cilantro. Excellent for summer!

I love this soup and make it often in cooler weather. I make some adjustments to the recipe, as some others have suggested. It's too bland with water, so I use chicken broth instead (or vegetable broth). Also, I leave out the spinich and use only mustard greens and more garlic than the recipe calls for. The soup has a wonderful taste and a little bite to it from the mustard greens (you also get more bite depending what volume of red pepper flakes you add).

I thought this soup was excellent, but then again, I like simple soups. I used a mix of mustard, turnip, and collard greens, in addition to spinach. I probably used close to 3 lbs of potatoes. Like others, I used vegetable broth instead of water, and much more red pepper than called for. Otherwise, I added no additional seasonings and thought that the flavor was excellent. Also, I just made it all in one pot - sauteed onion and garlic, added potatoes and broth, then all the greens at the end (not bothering to use some for garnish). The extra potatoes provided a nice thickness so there was no need for cream.

I agree with the other reviewers that it is bland. I used chicken broth instead of water. Maybe sweet potatoes instead of Yukon gold?

I made a lot of alterations to this soup and it was still bland. First, per other reviewers, I added two pieces of pancetta. I crisped them up and removed them from the pan to use as a garnish, then cooked a whole onion, three cloves of garlic, and a 1/4 cup of shitake mushrooms in the fat. I deglazed the pan with a splash of sherry, then cooked the potatoes in chicken stock as recommended. I added red pepper flakes and seasoned with salt and pepper, and used mustard greens and fresh arugula from the CSA. I'm at a loss as to how this could have so little flavor with so many strongly-flavored ingredients, but I will most likely not make it again.

Got mustard greens in my veggie box by mistake and have never cooked them before. This recipe was so tasty! I decreased the potatoes and added a diced zucchini. Used boxed chicken broth plus water with a Knorr veggie cube to about 6 cups, to intensify the flavour. Didn't add the sour cream or bits of spinach on top. Yummy as it was, and a great, healthy way to get your greens.

I thought this soup was great! I was unsure what to do with a bunch of mustard greens I got from my CSA box, and this is a delicious solution. I made 2 changes? I didn't have spinach on hand, so I used a small zucchini and broccoli instead. I think this worked just fine. Also, I used vegetable broth for 4 of the 8 cups of liquid. I experimented with adding fresh basil and a squeeze of lime to some one bowl, and that was tasty as well.

This soup with additions is a yummy potato and greens soup. I made it because like some other reviewers I needed to use up some greens and potatoes. My additions were aji dulce peppers, ½ cup white wine, 4 pinches smoky chipotle pepper and a slice of Morning star soya bacon ( removed before pureeing). Didnt need any garnishes after that. You can use any greens instead of spinach-I picked various baby leaves from my garden-amaranth, spigariello, arugula. I made 1/3 the recipe and it was a lot-6 first course servings.

I made this soup last night and it turned out great! However its so filling my husband and I were only able to eat a cup each and we have a massive stockpot full of soup so I'll be freezing the rest. Changes - used 7 cups regular (not low sodium) chicken broth as the store was out and didn't add any additional salt. Used 1 tablespoon of red chili flake and didn't add any extra pepper. Used about 2.25lb potatoes and 2.5 total lbs pounds of organic green kale and organic baby spinach. Skipped the sour cream and chopped spinach at the end as the flavor was so good already. Note - every time I make hot soups I burn myself trying to puree them in the blender. This time I used the food processor and it worked like a charm! I didn't even have to let the soup cool so we were able to eat it right away. I will never use the blender for hot soups again.

Tasty soup! Proper seasoning was necessary - a bit of salt made the flavors stand out. I also carmelized the onions in a separate pan while the potatoes were simmering, then added the sauteed garlic + greens. I agree about adding a squeeze of lemon - it needed just a bit of acid. I garnished with a swirl of really good olive oil and a couple of homemade croutons instead of sour cream. I'll definitely make it again!!

This is a delicious and amazingly healthy soup! I loved it and can't wait to make it again. My error was that I needed it to be heated in the crock pot for a while and I erroneously left it on low instead of keep warm. I think that ruined some of the flavor, so I want to try making it again when I'll be able to eat it fresh! Don't discount the importance of a healthy dollop of sour cream and spinach sprinkled on top - not only does it make for great presentation, but it adds a lot to the flavor, too!

I was trying to use up mustard and turnip greens that wintered over in my garden and some red and Yukon gold potatoes so I started out with a slightly different ingredients list, but followed the recipe otherwise. It was ok, but I really felt that it needed an additional layer of flavor. It tasted pretty much like you would think. Potatoes and greens blended together and heated up. I chopped up some sun dried tomatoes and added them. I also threw on some herbed croutons. It helped a little and the soups depth of flavor improved over the course of several days. Really what it needs is something smoky like bacon. That would be delicious, but obviously take it out of the veggie column. I would make it again if I found my self with greens and tatoes that needed to be used. Would prob plan to serve it with a flavorful sandwich (ohhh..smoked Gouda grilled cheese, hmmm..the wheels turn)

I wasn't too crazy about this recipe. The overall flavor was missing something. After an initial taste test I rummaged through my fridge to find something to salvage it and the addition of a bit of fresh parmesan cheese was only a slight improvement. I wouldn't make it again.

My husband and I LOVED this soup. I used the suggestions -- red pepper, 1/2 leek & onion, chicken broth (it was easier for lack of time). A great winter soup and super means to use up spinach, potatoes & mustard greens. We buy only organic, so some of the yummy flavor comes from that, too.

This soup absolutely requires the mustard greens, I think. Plus the additional punches as suggested by others....veggie broth, more pepper flakes, half leeks/half onions. But the real WOW comes from the garnishes...in addition to the sour cream, I drizzled fresh meyer lemon juice, diced avocado and served with organic stone ground blue tortilla chips. All of a sudden it's a southwest concoction as interesting and yummy as could be.

I chose this recipe because I had potatoes and spinach to use up. My local natural foods store did not have mustard greens, so I had to substitute collard greens, and maybe that was the problem...but, I really found this soup fairly tasteless. If not for the red pepper flakes (I used 1 tsp, as recommended by previous reviewers) and chicken broth (instead of water), it would have had no taste at all. I should note that my husband really liked it-- it reminded him of his native Danish winter soups--therefore I'm giving it 2 forks instead of 1.

We really enjoyed this. I made a few changes- I added 1 tsp of red pepper and sauteed it with the onions. And I only used spinach. I also made my own vegetable broth (easy! boiled 8 cups of water with a chopped onion, garlic, red pepper, peppercorns, rosemary and thyme for 30min then strain and use liquid) and only used 6-7 cups. We topped it with parmesan cheese. I would make this again.

Great quick soup. I did a search looking for a soup that had potatoes and spinach - cleaning out the fridge & pantry! I took the recommendations from others regarding the red pepper flakes and used a whole teaspoon. Also suggested (with modifications), I substituted the 8 cups water with 7 cups chicken stock and one cup half & half that I added at the end. Color was a bit "brighter" than I expected, but tasty!

I liked this soup but felt that something was missing. I used Idaho baking potatoes instead of Yukon Gold and 7 cups of chicken stock instead of water for more flavor as suggested by other reviewers (8 cups would have been too much -- I like a thicker soup). I also added twice the amount of red pepper flakes and a touch of cream at the end but can't figure out what else is needed to make this soup *POP*.

This soup is hearty and has depth in flavor. Great for the winter.

I QUARTERED THE RECIPE FOR TWO PEOPLE AND STILL HAD LEFTOVERS. I USED BEAUTIFUL ORGANIC BEET TOPS INSTEAD OF THE MUSTARD GREENS.I DIDN'T BOTHER TO USE TWO POTS; JUST ADDED THE GREENS TO THE POTATO MIX. I THINNED IT WITH A BIT OF HALF AND HALF. GUESS I HAD MORE GREENS THAN I THOUGHT. ALSO SEASONED IT A BIT MORE. ADDED A SQUEEZE OF LEMON AT THE END. IT WAS GOOD!

Don't make this soup! This is by far, the most dissapointing recipe I have encountered on Epicurious. The look and the taste were just awful. Do not waste your time.

Our local farmers' market had HUGE bags of spinach today, so this soup ended up with only extra fresh spinach...and lots of it. I used 1 tsp of crushed red pepper (per suggestion of previous cook) 2 1/2 cans of chicken broth...and since the color was bright green, and seemed to need to be toned down a bit, I added about 3/4 cup of half-and-half to finish it off.

I liked this recipe somewhat but thought it needed something to 'kick it up a notch'. I tried lemon and tabasco which helped some. I'm thinking next time of adding smoked bacon or some smoked ham hocks...

This was excellent. I substituted Kale instead of mustard greens, and it still tasted great. Also, to spice it up even more I added 1 tablespoon, instead of 1 teaspoon , of red pepper flakes. Excellent!

Great soup! Hearty and healthy. I disagree with the "less liquid" crowd: I found that the amount called for was necessary. Maybe it depends upon your potatoes? And yes, use chicken broth.

Tonight I'm making this for the second time - this is an extremely flexible soup that works well with turnip greens, beet greens, braising greens - not just spinach and mustard greens!

I made this for an 8 person dinner party on a very cold night. It was fabulous. I made it the night before, adding roughly 1/2 the amount of chix stock than the recipe called for. When I re-heated it the night of the party, I added a bit more chix stock. We had PLENTY left over. The mustard greens were great--and a fun conversation piece!

Very good and tasty. I used three (14 oz)cans of low-sodium chicken broth and that seemed just about right. For scatterbrained cooks like myself, it was a little bit involved and messy though not bad and definetly worth it. Excellent sources of folic acid and calcium! Perfect for St. Patrick's Day too!

This soup is absolutely delicious. I served it with crisp tortilla chips. The only drawback is the amount it made. It made more soup than I could handle. Next time I will half the recipe.

The recipe requires modification: 8 cups is way to much liquid, four cups is just about right. I used chicken broth instead of water to boost flavor; it was very tasty.
