Made this sauce to go with salmon. Substituted half a yellow bell pepper for the jalapeno, and dry riesling for the chicken broth. Also used low-sodium soy for better salt control and reduced the garlic by half. A subtle sauce, but delectable.

Rating: 3
Easy, light, very little fat, sauce. Used the mini-prep to mince the jalapeno and garlic. Just threw the sliced basil on top after pouring the sauce on the pork. I will definitely make the sauce again for other dishes - fish, chicken.

Rating: 4
After reading the other reviews, I decided to both simplify the prep and kick the flavors up just a notch, using a couple of products from my favorite condiment line, Dr. Gonzo's Uncommon Condiments. Sub 1 tsp Garlic Mash for the minced garlic, 1 Tbsp Supermash for the jalapeno, add 1 Tbsp lime juice and 1 Tbsp honey. Put everything in the pan at one time, simmer to blend flavors and thicken slightly. It was spectacular on tuna steaks, with a balanced, gentle heat that brought out the best in the mango and basil.

This recipe has potential, but the next time I make it I'll try to concentrate the flavors of the sauce, which seemed a bit bland. Next time I'll use less chicken broth, and a large jalepeno. (I used a small jalepeno from my garden, and could't taste it at all.) Fresh basil is one of my favorite flavors, so I added it at the end of the cooking process after removing the pan from the heat. The sauce had a nice golden color, and looked appealing.

I'm afraid I have to agree with zhudi from San Diego. Freshly made and warm, the sauce was . . . strange but OK, at least in a finger taste. Once cooled and then rewarmed and served with the chops, it had turned vile. An unhappy marriage of mismatched ingredients. I threw the rest out.

Wow! I loved this sauce...easy to make and great flavor. The color of the sauce didn't bother me at all...it wasn't exactly brown as other reviewers mentioned, but rather it looked like the color of golden raisins. I saved the basil for sprinkling on top and that did liven up the color a bit. Overall, loved this sauce on the chops, but will be making it again to put over grilled fish.

YUM. Yesterday I jumped on Epicurious to find an easy pork chop recipe to prepare in the Summer heat. This one fit the bill. The only thing I had to purchase was mango. I used basil and jalapeno from my garden. This is a sauce that allows you to adjust the flavors to your liking and is easy to make. I agree with others, the sauce will not make the cover of Vogue but once you plate the dish you can finish it with additional chopped mango and basil. The colors will be brighter and more appealing. I also made the sauce in advance to give the ingredients some time to "blend". This one is a keeper. Next time I will try it with chipotle in adobo.

Rating: 4
You cannot go wrong with this sauce. It has never received less than rave reviews. The only change I've ever made was to use chipotle instead of jalapeno -- gives it a slightly smokier flavor. But ... try it. You'll like it.

The sauce is amazing. We make it anytime we can get fresh mangoes and then save it to use for fish, chicken, etc.

This turned out wonderfully! Pretty quick to prepare, too. I didn't change any of the ingredients, but I did leave the mango puree a bit chunky, and didn't bother measuring much. Awful color, but great flavor!

I only had to try this recipe once before I added it to my permanent collection. That was 10 years ago, and I have been making it ever since. I use a bit less garlic than called for, since a tablespoon packs quite a punch. The pork chops are noticably better when grilled, but the broiler is okay if grilling is impossible. I like to accompany this dish with another Bon Appetit recipe: vegetable couscous paella.

Rating: 3
A great way to dress up basic chops. The sauce reminded me of chinese food, but it had a good bite from the pepper. Would be easy to make the sauce ahead of time and then heat it up while broiling the chops.

Deliciouis! Definitely use fresh basil and garlic (of course). We couldn't get enough of the sauce and ate it over the leftover rice until it was gone! YUM!

This was an easy and flavorful dish but it just didn't really excite my husband or myself.We'll try something else next time.

Rating: 4
The flavor was great on my chops. The only problem I had was the basil. I kept the sauce in a measuring cup for serving and the basil floated on top. Next time I will just put over the chops on the serving plate. I used mango from a jar and after putting it in the processor, it gave me 3/4 cups which was perfect. I let the sauce simmer for about 20 min. to combine all the flavors. Will make again.

Rating: 3
We thought this was just great. Super easy. I didn't have a mango, but I had some fresh mango juice which substituted just fine. Reduced the sauce and it was great not just on the pork chops, but grilled asparagus, and portabello mushrooms. Yummy for a quick weeknight meal.

Bland. Bland. Bland. My husband thought it was good. I didn't like it at all and like the other reviewers, couldn't get past that watered-down mud colour. I wound up using Branston Pickle Relish on it instead.

This recipe was delicious. The store was out of fresh basil, so I made it with fresh mint instead. The result? Superb! I think mint is a perfectly acceptable substitute for basil in this dish. Served it with sauteed spinach w/ garlic and risotto.

I made this dish tonight. I bought my mango a week ago so I was sure it was good and ripe. I did not puree the mango. I finely diced it for more texture. I did not have fresh basil so I had to use dried basil. I bet it does make a difference. If I make it again, I will use fresh basil. Also, I am allergic to jalepeno peppers and most other peppers so I did not add those in to the dish. I think that it would have been a lot better with those included. Also, I grilled my pork loin chops and I had to put them back on the grill three times before they were cooked enough in the center so they would not be pink on the inside. I would suggest using thinner than 1 inch pork chops.

Rating: 4
Use ripe mangos for this recipe to give it more natural sweetness. Next time we make this, we are going to puree half the mangos to add variety in the texture. We also added more basil which gave it more bite. One jalapeno is enough for mild heat, but if you like spicy food, you might want to add two or three.

Rating: 3
We thought this was absolutely delicious. Since I didn't have any fresh basil, I substituted cilantro, and I added a couple Kaffir lime leaves towards the end, which really added a nice flavor. Also, I took the advice of a previous reviewer and just minced the mango. Very nice.

Rating: 4
I've made this dish many times over the past couple of years and always with great success. My own variation on the sauce has been to substitute chipolte chili's for the jalepeno's. I think the smokey flavor is a great enhancement to the sauce. Either dried or in an adobe sauce, I leave the seeds and vein out so the heat doesn't overpower the sauce.

Rating: 4
On my first try, it came out delicious -- and the leftover sauce was wonderful on fish as well as pork. I'll plan on making a jar of sauce to keep readily available in the fridge. The jalepeno adds just the extra little kick without being too spicy.

Rating: 4
This dish has become a staple for our special dinners. We use chicken breasts and seeded green Thai chillies served on a bed of rice. The taste is exceptional, and lends itself well to other robust flavours, but favours Thai. Although we've tried both fresh and canned mango, we've found no appreciable taste difference, and therefore use the canned mango's for convenience. Fresh basil however is a must. Great dish, which I'm off to make now for our guests.

Rating: 4
The recipe lends itself to Thai ingredients. A large sweet juicy ripe greenish yellow mango (which eliminates the need for sugar), Thai chilis which are very very hot, and a very generous amount of hoary basil bring this recipe into its own. Chop the mango into small pieces instead of puree for added texture--it will become saucy with cooking.

This dish is so easy to prepare and the flavors just pop. I've made it twice, once on pork and once on fish and I think it's much better on fish. I didn't seed the chile because I like spicy food. Several friends tried it and all loved it. You can also make extra sauce and freeze until ready to eat and then you can just saute fish or pork and reheat sauce and pour over for a quick meal. Delicious!

I've made this dish several times now, either with chicken or fish, and it has been delicious every time. I usually bump up the heat a little bit, and use palm sugar instead of brown sugar.

Yum! This recipe is amazingly delicious! I have never had pork that was so tender and juicy. I followed the recipe except that I used 1 cup of mango instead of 1/2 cup and since I didn't have a jalepeno handy, I used a few dashes of hot pepper sauce instead. The combo of flavors is just perfect -- this is a must try!

Yummy! Excellent sauce. I used a boneless porkloin and it turned out very good.

very tasty! i'll definitely make this again, very easy. i used olive oil, other than that, i followed the recipe. i'd use more mango next time and probably make it a bit more spicy (adding chili). i chose to slice up the pork loin and drizzle the sauce over the top. would have been great with mashed potatoes, but i forgot those when i was at the store.

Rating: 4
Made the sauce to serve over fish and it was deliscous! It totally reminded me of Thai food, with the mango-basil-chile combo, but a little more understated; flavorful, but light enough where you can still taste the flavors of the meat. I will definately be making this again, maybe substituting jalapeno for Thai chilis next time.

Rating: 4
I have made this a number of times since discovering it a few months ago. It is *wonderful* and takes very little time or fuss to prepare. I don't vary the recipe much-- but I do add a bit more jalapeno (and sometimes red pepper flakes). I also rub the lightly oiled pork with some cinnamon. The subtle grilled cinnamon flavor works really well with the sauce. One Caution: Do not attempt to use the bottled mango in your grocer's produce section. The end result is very inferior. It is worth the wait for fresh mangos.

Such great reviews! My experience was a little different. I don't think my mango was ripe since it did not 'puree'/get smooth in the processer. With it not being ripe the taste was probably not as sweet. The sauce was not awful just ok. Also, very little hint of jalapeno. IF I made this again I would add more jalpeno. So for those of you planning to make this recipe be sure and get a ripe (=soft) mango. Any, by the way, the color of the sauce was not an issue.

Rating: 3
A very solid recipe, perhaps the best pork chop-based recipe I've sampled on Epicurious... Don't let the color of the sauce leave you cold, it is tasty and with a bit of flair you can make it asthetically pleasing as well (use some crushed leftover basil and sprinkle it around the rim of the plate, etc.). As a caveat, when I made the recipe, it amounted to a sizeable excess of sauce, so one can either cut down the sauce recipe (or perhaps save some for another occasion)... All-around a favorite, even for my girlfriend who shys away from mixing fruit and meet!

We were looking to find something to change plain b.b.q.pork chops into something a bit different,we liked the idea of the sauce, not unlike sweet and sour sauce. The flavour of the Basil however was lost in the heavy mango and light soya sauce, but as we were having salad with it we put plenty of basil leaves in the salad,more than one way to skin a cat!!. next time I do it I will double the quantity of basil. It did go well with the pork chops,I was not put off by the colour.

This dish was OK, I usually like fruit with meat but somehow, maybe it was the presentation, I agree with some of the reviews, the mango-basil sauce just kinda of looked gross. The sauce was OK, but I couldn't get passed the color of it. Also getting the mango off around the pit was very messy, who knows maybe I just don't no how to get the pulp off the mango. I will probably not make the dish again.

Really lovely. The broiled chops are incredibly easy and stay juicy, and the sauce is savory and wonderful. When the pork went under the broiler, I added some mango chunks to the sauce and let them heat up, and when I served the sauce over the chops, I sprinkled a liberal amount of chopped fresh basil over it all (uncooked, so the basil odor comes through). I used all of the sauce for 4 small boneless chops for my husband and me, and we ate nearly all of it. The only change I made (and I usually change every recipe) was to substitute Vietnamese chilli sauce for the jalapeno pepper.
