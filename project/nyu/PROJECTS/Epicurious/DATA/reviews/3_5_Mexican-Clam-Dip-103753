Easy, tasty recipe. I would make it a little spicer the next time.

I added garlic chili sauce for an extra kick and it also gave the dip a nice rosy colour. Very tasty!

I, and others, really liked the recipe as is. And I believe that is how you should try something before you change things. I can see how the salsa you use would really make or break this dish. I would never use a big brand from the supermarket (too much sugar, and not enough heat). My final notes to this dish are to use 2 cans clams, 2 cans crab, a fresh authentic (and hot) salsa verde...and thus, I omit the chiles; and I use Tapatio as the hot sauce. Also you may wish to omit or lessen the cilantro, depending on how much is in the salsa.

I LOVE this and people practically lick the dish when I make it. It's amazing that combination of ingredients goes so well together. The only thing I really change is that I only use 2 cans of clams... 3 cans is a bit much (and I am a seafood lover).

I liked this and so did everyone else. I used medium flavored salsa verde (Pace's) and thought that it had the right amount of heat. I can see adding one more can of clams as others have suggested.

Good "emergency guest" item as almost everything is from cupboard. Took suggestion of reviewers and added cheese and a few drops of hot sauce. Served at outdooor dinner party and people gobbled it up! A keeper.

I've been making this since it came out in the magazine - to die for! It's one of my most-requested party recipes. My father-in-law adores it and asks for it any chance he can get!

Expect a pack of wolves to appear to devour this dip - everytime I serve it, it never lasts! I too use crab instead of clams, very easy to make.

This is absolutely yummy and SOOO easy to prepare. The only green salsa I can ever find is HOT and I am always afraid my guests will not like it. They gobble it up, heat not withstanding!

Easy to make ahead and heat up right before guests arrive. Loved the spice in this....

Based on the reviews, I thought this was a recipe I didn't have to test prior to making it for a Mexican-themed party. The only change I made was adding a few splashes of Tabasco even though I thought the recipe might be better if it included shredded cheddar or jack cheese. I made extra to yield 3 cups of dip. I didn't bake all of it at once and after tasting it, I didn't bother to serve the rest. In fact, most of the dip was left over, and I threw it out. The next day, I added shredded cheddar to the remaining dip that wasn't baked, and it was a huge difference. I used Sargento's Mexican blend and would never consider making this dip without the addition.

I made this for two different events and both times this was the groups's favorite. It is simle, quick to make, and a terrific start to a Mexcan dinner.

Excellent dish! I added a few drops of Tobasco and another can of clams as suggested by previous reviwers. I had several requests for the recipe!

Very good - I'll make it again and again. I used reduced-fat cream cheese so no beating was necessary. It doesn't get easier than this! I may try hotter salsa next time, but this is very good as is.

First time I made this everyone liked it but me ... made it again for a large crowd and left out the canned chilies and for a party of 50+ with tons of food this was the most-requested recipe. I took a reviewers advice and added tabasco and next time will mince some jalapenos. But this is a great dip!

Delicious and I was dubious about that list of ingredients! I added several generous dashes of tabasco and served it with blue corn chips. Guests loved it! No fishy, icky clammy nonsense -- just rich and delish!

I made this dip for a new-years party and it was the only dish to go! This was my first time making this dip and I think in the future I might add an extra can of clams, some mozzarrella cheese and hotter salsa. I didn't notice a fishy smell after it was baked so don't be afraid to try it.

Ugh. A dissapointment after rave reviews. Bland, neither clammy nor spicey. Glad I tried it out on family before taking to a party. Wont be making it again.

Rating: 3
This was very good and will become a mainstay due to the ease of preparation and the ability to make in advance. I made just as directed and was alarmed that it would be too runny, but it set up after baking. It also inspired me to serve over linguine with a few modifications, such as adding the drained clam broth; the family wants me to make again. Thanks for a novel idea.

Rating: 4
This is definitely a keeper - so easy! A great combination of flavors. I too rinsed the clams, and actually upped the fresh cilantro. Modified w/ reduced fat cream cheese and baked tortilla chips. Made it for an after golf party - was gone in 5 minutes! Everyone requested the recipe.

I have never seen a dip consumed so fast. Takes minutes to prepare, and minutes to disappear! I add a bit of cayenne for the zip. Goes great with Triscuts as well, if you don't have chips.

Made this for a late summer "back to school" gathering and everyone loved it! I'm not a huge fan of the flavor of canned chilies so left those out in later batches and personally liked it more! Lots of "recipe requests"!

This was a real crowd pleaser. I don't think anyone even new there were clams in it and I added an extra can.

Wonderful. Be careful that the salsa you add is not too salty because the clams are. WE used fresh clams and a different salsa the second time and enjoyed it even more.

Rating: 4
I've served this dip many times in the last few years, and it has always been the first appetizer to disappear. I don't like clams myself, but this is so good that you can't really tell what is in it. As a matter of fact, most of my guests scarf it down before they ask what it is. If you are looking for a great green salsa, try Mrs. Renfro's. It has a wonderful taste as well as a little kick - I used the one that says "hot" on the bottle. I have yet to smell anything fishy once the clams are in the dip, but I usually rinse them just to make sure. Enjoy!

I made this recipe for a birthday party, and since then, have been asked by the hostess to bring it to two more of her parties. The dish is scraped clean by the end of the party! The last time I made it, I prepared it a few hours ahead of time, and then baked it just prior to serving. I have to say, it was a little fishy smelling this time. All in all, an easy recipe that's not exactly the same old, same old.

Nasty...very, very nasty. I followed the recipe and the results were utterly disappointing. I took it to a tailgating party and even the very drunk people wouldn't eat it.

This was really good and different from the usual dips - served at a party and it was cleaned up, even by people who wouldn't have eaten it had they known what it was. To the person who said it smelled fishy, it did a bit before mixing up and cooking, but then I didn't think it did at all.

Very good dip. Our grocer did not have salsa verde though, so I used a can of green enchilda sauce and some red salsa to add kick. Great with black corn chips!

Rating: 3
I thought it was quite divine -- and definitely (annoyingly) addictive!! A dash of paprika before baking adds a nice splash of color, as do a few springs of fresh cilantro. We had a bunch left over (I made for a party of only 4). If you find yourself in this enviable situation, just thin it with a little milk, heat it in the microwave and toss it with some pasta. Heaven!!!

Made this for several different occasions, and it was gobbled up each time. Use hot green salsa or add a few jarred jalapenas chopped for a little more kick. Taste good with lime chips.

Everyone enjoyed this dip. I had many requests for the recipe and thought was was very tasty. I wish I would have had a pretty mexican bowl I could have baked it in. I baked it in a glass bowl and the color isn't very pretty since the dip is basically white.

Outstanding!!! My guests loved it and wanted the recipe. I certainly will make it for them again!!

Actually this rates a 3.5. Because it was open,I used the Ranchera Sauce by La Costena and their medium verges on hot. I added about a tablespoon more salsa. People loved the heat. The other reviews are right - it disappears.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time, & it was delicious. I've made it twice with smoked turkey instead of clams, & it's even better! Everyone says it's the best dip I've made - & I've made plenty.

I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and roasted chile salsa verde. We all thought that this dip was better than most cream cheese dips, and in fact we just about finished it all - but it is still a cream cheese dip, although a bit more exciting than the others.

This was fabulous! I made it for a cocktail party and it was gobbled up immediately. I let it sit for a little while after cooking and prior to serving, definately recommend doing that as it needs to "settle" a little.

This dish was super easy and my friends loved it. I sliced avocados on the top since I did not think the dip looked too attractive when it came out of the oven. I also added a little chipoltle for extra zip.

Twice, I brought this dip to dinner with friends and, although it looks like a lot, it disappeared in no time flat! It received rave reviews and I plan to make it many more times. For even easier preparation, put all the ingredients except for the clams in a food processor -fold in the clams last.

HOW SAD I WAS THAT I HALVED THE RECIPE!!! There were only four of us, and half a recipe should've been plenty... This was AWESOME! It's so easy to make ahead & bake later. W/ 1/2 the recipe I used only one can of clams and a whole brick of cream cheese and it was great!!!

As a reviewer said - if this gets too hot it is way to watery - people started eating it when it had cooled some and thickened. Most people couldn't tell what was in it - but they did like it. I added a small amount of ground chipolte pepper to the recipe to spice it up.

I liked this. It is not very clam-y which is good, or bad, depending on your perspective. I like clams so wouldn't have minded it being clam-ier, but my husband is not big on clams, so he liked that it wasn't heavy on the clams. Worth trying.
