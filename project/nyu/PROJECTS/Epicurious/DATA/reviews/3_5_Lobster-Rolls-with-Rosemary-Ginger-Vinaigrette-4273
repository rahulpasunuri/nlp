I made the recipe exact as original with paperthin daikon (mandoline) and daikon sprouts. I did cut the oil in half with no detriment to the vinaigrette--good call from prior feedback. BTW--daikon sprouts, which I found in a local Asian market, DO NOT taste anything like alfalfa sprouts. Daikon sprouts taste mildly 'radishy' and nutty--watercress would be a better substitute. However, if you can find them, the daikon sprouts are delicious!

Nice flavors and good presentation however I agree with the CT chef; oil needs to be greatly reduced.

I made this with large shrimp, and it was a hit at our wine-tasting party. Using the sherry vinegar really made a difference. However, I felt that the dip, which would not completely emulsify, had far too much oil in it.

The dipping sauce was tasty, but very overpowering. I made some of these with lobster and some with shrimp and the delicate flavors were completely lost with the pickled ginger and ginger flavors in the sauce. They did present well, but didn't have the wonderful combination of flavors that I look for in an appetizer and I've made better. I was disappointed.

The appetizer was a real hit. The vinaigrette which I poured over the rolls was terrific!!! Next time I will try shrimp instead of lobster--I felt the taste of the lobster got a little lost and maybe shrimp would stand up better to all the other great flavors. An appetizer well worth the work put into it--it does take some time to assemble the rolls. One last note, I found the peeler impossible to work with so I used a knife to peel the strips of zucchini and it worked much better. This appetizer could be assembled the night before, seal airtight and refrigerate---pour the vinaigrette over the rolls shortly before serving.

How wonderful to find a recipe that does not enthuse over using live lobsters and boiling them to death. The sauce was wonderful and everyone at our BBQ asked for the recipe - try it (with the frozen lobster tails).

Soo easy, soo pretty, soo healthy and soo good! Used the shrimp and alfalfa sprouts. Grreat on a warm day or night. The dressing tends to separate a lot - be sure to really whisk it right. I'm sure it would be even better with the daikon sprouts and lobster but it is so much easier to get the other ingredients at probably any market at anytime of year. Enjoy!

I first tasted this recipie at my aunts house in Hawaii, where she used fresh lobster ofcourse. It was so delicious I had to make it at home in California where I used shrimp instead and alfalfa sprouts...just as good!!

Very impressive looking in presentation, and it tastes fabulous. Especially the dipping sauce. Relatively easy to make once you get the hang of making the zucchini strips

I am a caterer and have made this several times using shrimp. I'd love to try it with the lobster but it is a bit more expensive. It looks beautiful on a platter and is so nice and different. I used regular alfalfa sprouts and have skipped the ginger and it is still good.
