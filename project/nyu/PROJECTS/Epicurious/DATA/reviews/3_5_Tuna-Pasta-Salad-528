Definitely 3 1/2 stars! I made adjustments based on other notes here: 1- used sauteed red onion rather than green. used green peas rather than beans (trying to use what I had in the house). 2-added 1 chopped carrot, 2 stalks chopped celery and 1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper. 3- used vegan mayo rather than regular (way less fat). only used 1/2 cup. Thoughts: The additional veggies were necessary--next time I'll add even more. I will also cut the pasta to 8 oz from 12 oz. Both my partner and I were incredibly pleased with the results (especially considering how little work it is). More than likely, this will become a regular dinner. And yes, there is definitely enough for a lunch or two left over!

This recipe was very easy and tasted great! I used 1/2 cup of mayo instead of 3/4, but I regretted it - tasted fine the day of, but it makes so much leftovers, and they definitely dried out in my tupperware. I'd use the whole amount of mayo next time. Peas would be a good addition too but I stuck to the recipe. Yum!

What a surprise! I who ate green beans went back for seconds and thirds.

I have been living on this pasta salad this summer. I crave it. I use less mayo and more veggies but just because I eat it so often!

My version (I highly recommend trying it!): I used peas instead of green beans, omitted the tomato (this didn't seem to go with the other ingredients), and added some chopped, drained marinated artichoke hearts. I also used much less mayo. So good!!

Yum! I added celery and a sprinkle of feta cheese on top, and did less mayo (probably half a cup). It could have used more tuna. Overall, a very yummy recipe. Warning though, it does make a TON. So get ready for leftovers.

For a lunch or a light dinner, this is a great recipe. Made it as is and wouldn't change a thing. All the ingredients blend beautifully, so don't leave anything out!

Delicious homey summer version of tuna noodle casserole. My family loved this!

3 1/2 for sure! I wouldn't bring this to a dinner party, but for lunch-DELICIOUS! I used two green onions, I can't imagine how over-powering five would be! Anyone who loves mayo and balsamic vineger will LOVE it.

Made this for an office potluck. It was a hit and easy to make. I used lowfat mayo and it still did the trick (less calories too). Would even be great for leftovers (if you have any!)

Easy and delicious. I added fresh basil and diced celery. One reviewer said that balsamic vinegar made the dressing brown; the solution is to use white balsamic vinegar. Stop & Shop carries it so not a rare item.

I just made this salad for dinner tonight. It tastes terrific. Of course, I made some changes. First, I used only 1/2 cup mayo and 1 TBSP of balsamic. I added those a bit at a time, and that amount seemed right -- light and not overpowering. Second, I had no green onions, so I used a bit of diced red onion. Both would work. Third, I had no celery salt, so I used regular salt and added one stalk of chopped celery. Finally, I have lots of basil in the garden, so I added about 1/3 cup chopped. My main recommendation here is to go light on the dressing and add fresh herbs to brighten the flavor.

An easy dish for a hot summer day. We really enjoyed this.

After the first bite my husband said that he hated it. By the fourth bite he said he liked it. If people are expecting it to taste like typical tuna salad with mostly mayonnaise, they are in for a surprise. The balsamic and olives (I used kalamata) give it quite a zing. Although I don't believe they would have changed the flavor, I wished that I had added the green beans (they went bad). Overall, good midweak meal.

Very tasty. I subbed peas for the green beans, carrots for the tomatoes, yogurt for half the mayo, and cucumbers for the onions (so my kids would eat it.) Will definitely make this again.

Nothing fancy but a great version of a basic recipe. I do love almost anything that contains seeded, peeled tomatoes! I will definitely make this again and again.

I thought this was a great and easy recipe, it only took about 25 minutes to make. I added diced celery which gave it a nice crunch. Red bell pepper would be a great addition as well. I didn't have celery salt so I used a generous amount of lemon pepper, which spiced it up really well.

My mum has made a variation of this recipie since I can remember however we prefer to use a low fat salad dressing instead of mayo, we don't use olives or any balsamic venegar and we use a lot of veg such as sweetcorn carrots and celery. The only seasoning I need to add to my salad is some black pepper. A good healthy tip is to use more veg than pasta also. Otherwise this recipie is a great take on a classic.

Do try this recipe. It was easy to make and very good. A bit different than "Mom's" tuna pasta salad that I grew up with. Was a little skeptical about using the balsamic, but was pleased with the taste! My lunch guest commented on the flavor (I didn't give away my secret though!). Also wasn't sure about using green beans, but that too was a nice addition. As always, there are tons of things you could add or change in this recipe, but I would give it a try as is first.

This was really good. I omitted the tomatoe and instead added 1 diced red bell pepper, and 1 green pepper, and 1 shredded carrot. This not only made it colorful, but also tasted great in the salad. I also added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar. My family really liked it.

Followed advice of another reviewer and didn't use basalmic vinegar. I used cider vinegar as that is what my Grandma used in her mayo based dressings. The second time I made it I added more vegetables: raw carrots julienned, diced celery, thinly sliced radishes, another tomato. We liked the increased ratio of veggies to pasta.

perfect for a summer picnic or make a batch for a party. simple--don't forget the scallion and tomatoes--they make the dish! i omitted the celery salt and the olives and it was still good. husband can't get enough.

Followed the recipe as written with exception of omitting the celery salt (didn't have any in the spice rack). I thought the recipe was okay - not fantastic but I would make it again. Color was less than appealing - the balsamic vinegar combined with the mayo makes a brown dressing.

Very good! I halved the recipe and it was still enough for 4 hearty servings.

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this salad and he doesn't like traditional tuna salad. A very unique salad and great for a hot evening's dinner. I look forward to bringing to a salad luncheon. I basically halved the recipe and added extra tomatoes, onions and black olives. I used low fat mayo to lighten it up.

This is definitely our favorite pasta salad! While our green beans are coming ripe, I'm making this salad at least once a week and hearing no complaints about doing so. The only alteration I've made is to leave the olives out since my best half doesn't care for them, but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. Though I am going to try adding some Parmesan, now doesn't that sound good?

This is one of the best tuna pasta salads that I've tried in a long time. It is easy to make and feeds a lot of hungry mouths. I would definitely recommend it.

I gave this three forks, my husband gave it two. I added more tomatoes and 1/2 pound of pasta instead of 3/4. I thought it tasted much better the next day. I would make it again - but for a crowd - it makes a lot!

This is my favorite tuna recipe ever! I made these changes: used only 1 can of tuna. 2 tomatoes & only 1/2 pound of corkscrew pasta. It looks so pretty & tastes so good! Also, easy to make & not costly.

Really good salad! I used 2 tomatoes but next time I would use even 4! Capers could be added next time, too. And do not overcook beans, they really must be crispy!

This is the best. The beans give it just the right texture and the addition of balsamic vinegar is a master touch.

This was a nice alternative to basic Tuna Salad. I was out of Balsamic and tried Garlic/Basil white wine vinegar and loved the results.

I have made this recipe a dozen times and my husband loves it. I always add a little more vinegar and celery salt to taste and less tuna.

We loved this. But it made a huge amount. Fewer green beans, and maybe susbstitute asparagus for them. I ate it for days and days. Needs maybe a little more tomato.

you must make this a few hours before serving in order for the flavors to blend. I served it for lunch and it was ok, i tasted it a few hours later and it was wonderful!

This is the best tuna pasta recipe I've ever made.Everyone loves it and I've made it over and over. I use multicolored rotini, 2-3 cans of regular tuna, and four big roma tomatoes; other than that, the recipe stays the same. I make a batch of it and have it for lunch at work all week. I definitely recommend this recipe!!

What a disappointment! Chintzy on all the ingredients, especially the seasonings. I used peas, instead of beans, and used 3 roma tomatoes rather than one as the recipe suggests. It could easily do with another can of tuna - you hardly know it's there. Balsamic vinegar, which is a favorite, didn't seem to liven up the dressing's bland flavor even after I kept adding more and more. I also increased the celery salt, and added a generous dose of freshly ground pepper but that didn't work either. If you're into presentation and taste, please don't waste your time with this one.

Very good. I didn't have green beans so I used frozen peas. I didn't have green onions so I used red onion. Also, I used light mayo and it was still delicious!!

I made this recipe for a baby shower buffet, then for a picnic. Everyone loves it! I use the dressing for other pasta salads as well - the balsamic vinegar gives it a great flavor.

This is a great, easy, do-ahead recipe! The night before I cooked the beans and refrigerated them. Then I mixed together everything except the beans, tomatoes & pasta. The next morning all I had to do was cook the pasta, cut up the tomatoes and toss in the beans. Everyone loved it!
