I entered a cooking competition with this recipe and out of 48 recipes submitted it was selected for a cook-off among 16 others. After the first cook-off, I was one of 4 finalists. This recipe was the grand prize winner and was then featured on the restaurant's menu. I followed the recipe exactly. Tonight, I was short on cranberries, so made a glaze of dijon mustard the prickly pear syrup, then topped with the panko mixture. Amazing!

Followed other suggestions and added a layer of dijon mustard before the crust. Was delicious and entire family enjoyed it.

Easy and excellent. Prepared it at home and cooked it at my boyfriends for his family. Had some precooked roasted cauliflower heating up as the salmon baked. Beautiful presentation. Great compliments.

I make this dish often for company because it it lighter than most company fare and it looks festive. I always use wild salmon which is leaner than farmed so I cut the baking time by 25%. I am happy that almost 10 years since publication it is still being reviewed. I made it for the first time on Thanksgiving 2002 for our "vegetarian" daughter.

Have made this at least a dozen times for a variety of friends and family in the last 18 months and everyone wants the recipe. Use shallots instead of green onion and mix a little horseradish, mayo, & dijon in no particular proportion to spread on top and help crumbs adhere. Just terrific.

I've made this recipe at least 20 times and it ROCKS!!!! Make it exactly as described and you won't be disappointed. Gotta love the people who make substitutions and then give the recipe a bad review. Um hello? Pamela Anderson isn't Marilyn Monroe - make it like it says and you can't go wrong :)

I made this recipe last week and loved it. My usually finicky fiance actually suggested it, so I knew it would be a good one :) Made no substitutions except used regular bread crumbs and it was still great.

This was my first time using Panko --which doesn't look or taste like breadcrumbs -- if anyone is wondering! I really liked this recipe - quite tasty and different than usual salmon preparations. I used a base coating of horseradish mustard on the filets as was suggested by others. Only 15 minutes baking time required. Presentation looked a little dry, even though it wasn't dry once you ate it. I would probably slightly increase the amount of drizzled butter on top in the future in order to brown it a bit more.

This recipe was very straightforward and received glowing reviews from my boyfriend. I highly recommend it--would be a great recipe if you need to impress someone since it also plates up beautifully.

I'd give it 3.5. It was yummy and a great twist for a salmon dish! I made it as is, but used other reviewers suggestions by brushing djon mustard with horseradish to add spice and was the perfect adhesive. But I think next time I'll try adding the mayo to help with the moistness. I slightly overcooked it, but overall it was good. Enjoy.

Very unique and tasty recipe. I would give it 3.5 forks if I could. I put a layer of dijon on the fish as recommended and served it with israeli couscous. My husband loved it and claimed the recipe as a keeper!

Excellent and I'm not a big fan of fish. Used the Dijon mustard hint and since it's the holiday's, I used fresh cranberries instead of dried.

Great recipe! I followed the instructions except to take a reviewer's suggestion and spread a thin layer of dijon mustard on the salmon before putting the coating on. I also cooked it a bit less. Delicious!

What a terrific recipe. We eat a lot of salmon and this is a gem. Lovely and unusual combination; the cranberries add a tart, slightly sweet taste. This is a keeper.

I thought this was great tasting and easy to prepare. The cranberry was a nice distraction from the usual preparations for salmon.

This is an amazing recipe. It looks very elegant and if I make it during the holidays I use more green onions because the subtle red/green colors make it look very festive. I also spread dijon and I once made it with regular breadcrumbs when I was out of panko and it worked just fine. Now I make a large batch of the topping and I freeze part for later use. This way I have a company dish with only 5 minutes prop time. I love this recipe and guests always rave about it.

This is my all-time favorite salmon recipe. I buy a side of salmon and use half of it for this recipe (2 lbs.) I am not a big salmon fan but I could eat this every day -- it is delicious! Be sure to use the panko crumbs and real butter!

Very good. Smelled great while in the oven. Reminded me of winter poultry holiday dishes but with salmon instead. I also spread Dijon mustard on the fillets before the topping.

This is too much crust and too much thyme. I've made it twice and it comes out like a gooey paste that tastes of Listerine.

This is a recipe that I've done multiple times. Have tried substituting leeks and shallots for the scallions with good results. Also like a thin layer of dijon on the salmon to help the panko mixture to adhere. Even my non-fishing loving husband enjoys this!

i love this dish. i used all of the regular ingredients and added regular seeded dijon mustard brushed on top before the mixture. i usually only leave it in just long enough for the fish to be rare-med. rare. delish. in fact i think i'm going to make it tonight!

As noted by a previous reviewer, 20 minutes in the oven yielded well- done fish. Otherwise, however, this recipe worked beautifully for me. I used lemon thyme from our garden, and it worked particularly well with the fish.

I followed previous reviewers' suggestions and brushed wild salmon with mixture of dijon, mayo and horseradish before covering with topping. I also used 2 tsp of dried thyme instead of fresh. I forgot to drizzle with melted butter and it was fine. Easy and delicious. 20 minutes yielded a fairly well done fish- I will cook 15-17 minutes next time. A definite keeper.

Yum! Used king salmon and replaced onions with a slightly smaller amount of shallots. The dried cranberries were an especially delicious accent. Squeezed a lemon wedge over the top. Best salmon I've had in a while!

I had fresh wild copper river salmon. Took a big gulp & chose this recipe plus hints. My head told me to just do it with lemon, butter, etc. But my other side suggested I check out another recipe. And I found this. Hubby just said it was the best salmon I've prepared. Should I get salmon right out of the Columbia again, it will be butter +. This was wonderful! And I did mix 1 tablespoon of dijon to 2 tablespoons of real mayo. Next time I will add horseradish to the mayo. If the salmon needs it. Judgement call!

Wow, how did we miss this one for so long? We eat salmon about once a week but with the drought we haven't been able to grill for ages. I followed the suggestion for mustard and I mixed 1 TB coarse grained mustard with about 2 TB of light mayo. I halved the recipe (only two of us) and it was EASY and really super. We will definitely make this one again. (I forgot the lemon peel and we didn't notice the absence!)

I agree with the other reviewer about the mustard. Brushing the fish with dijon before the crumbs is the way to go, I haven't made it without. This is a fab fish dish. Very easy and quick.

I made this for Christmas dinner. The red and green colors were perfect for the occasion. Beautiful presentation, very quick, easy, and well received from all my guests. I served it with a side of wild rice, and started it off with a salad with raspberry vinaigrette, cranberries, blue cheese and candied walnuts.

I've made this dish several times already, and what I love about it is that it is totally different than the standard butter and seasonings type fish recipes, and totally delicious! The cranberries and green onions are lovely together, and the panko (DEFINITELY USE THE PANKO--IT WOULD BE BLAND WITHOUT IT) really makes it. It's also a very pretty dish--nice and colorful. It looks impressive for company without being the least bit difficult. By the second time I made it, I could get it prepared to go in the oven in about 15 minutes. I definitely recommend this one!

This dish screamed out at me to be lightly brushed with a Dijon/mayo combination before topping with the crumb crust. It provided a nice zing and contrast to the crust, which I prepared as written, and also helped the crumbs stay put. For just the two of us, a pair of thick center-cut salmon fillets from Trader Joe's were done perfectly moist in 20 minutes, and needed only a squeeze of lemon to finish off.

This is a flavor combination I usually love but I found this quite bland. Too many other great salmon recipes out there to bother with this one again. Wonder what I did wrong...

Rating: 4
This is fantastic!! Extremely easy--the second time will be even easier since I know the recipe now. The cranberries add a touch of sweetness that is a wonderful touch. Definitely use the Panko--I imagine it's not nearly as good with regular bread crumbs. The Panko is so light and crunchy. Also would be a great meal to make for guests--easy, impressively tasty, and very pretty! This is getting added to my recipe book.

Rating: 3
Lovely recipe - but note that the cooking time is a bit long if you want "rare" salmon. I cooked it for 12 minutes (10 minutes at the given temp and 2 minutes at broil to brown the crust). Also, I used two (not four) center cut filets and really piled on the crust. It needs some additional moisture to bind it, I used a few drops of water.

Made this tonight and hubby took one bite and said "this is really good". I wasn't sure about the cranberries when I read the recipe but enjoyed the sweetness with the crunch of the panko. Will make again.

Wonderful dish. My guy doesn't like salmon very much, but he thought this was good.. I used dried thyme, and next time I would add more cranberries, they were awesome. YOU HAVEN'T MADE THIS RECIPE IF YOU ANYTHING OTHER THAN PANKO(JAPANESE BREAD CRUMBS)

I made this recipe for a spur of the moment dinner with ingredients in my pantry. I didn't have any cranberries, but it still was very good. I would like to mention that I've found that when baking fish, one needs to use the cooking time as a basic guide. You need to take into account the thickness and shape of the fish and check to see if it's done a bit before the given cooking time.

To the cook who asked about the apples: sure, give it a try. This is a great dish. To the cook who thought it was bland: maybe try using dried thyme? That's what I used, and it was wonderful.

I made the recipe exactly as written. The fish was over cooked and the panko not toasted. The taste of the dried cranberries never really came through and the fresh thyme flavor was lost too. Seemed very bland. It was pretty, but not tasty enough to make again.

I would like to substitute dehydrated Winesap apples (since I have tons of them in the freezer) for the cranberries. Does anyone who has made this recipe think that this would make a decent dish? Thank you.

Made this dish for our Passover Seder by using Matzah Meal instead of the panko. My guests raved although make sure you do not over cook the fish. I found the fish was too dry because I left it in the oven past the cooking time at 150 since we were not ready to serve yet.

Rating: 3
This was pretty good. I like it mostly because it is rather different from the usual salmon recipes. I did make a change in an effort to cut down on carbs. Instead of the panko, I used 1/2 finely chopped cashews and half whole wheat bread crumbs. I suspect that if I made it as written, it would be better, but this was still pretty good. Easy and fast enough for weeknights, too.

We love this recipe. I have made it several times and it is always a hit. I have used dried thyme in place of fresh and that works nicely also. (cut down the amount you use) Panko breadcrumbs are a must - they aren't too hard to find, I can usually get them at a local grocery store.

Very elegant but straightforward dish, would be excellent for entertaining. I made it for Valentine's Day because of the red in the berries, and served with the Potato and Apple Galette with Sage. To the crust I added just a bit of parmesan cheese and ground almonds in place of some of the bread crumbs and it was wonderful. I will certainly make this again.

great recipe. paired excellently with "roasted vegetables with balasamic vinaigrette." i altered by using olive oil, and elminated the bread crumbs. still a very nice dish. the roasted root vegetables i paired are roasted with rosemary and have lemon peel in the vinagrette. so, they compliment the thyme and lemon peel in the salmon. a nice, impressive fall meal! worked very well w/ a chateauneuf du pape.

We made this dish for Christmas, using the panko not breadcrumbs and it was excellent. Very colorful and elegent for a holiday meal, but it's SO delicious and easy I've made it several times since. It's also a great basis for expirementing, I've never had this recipe come out anything but supurb.

I love this recipe. I think the reason why most people don't give it the highest rating is because they modified it. You need to use the panko to give it just the right texture. I think that bread crumbs would ruin that texture and also add an odd taste to the dish.

i used regular breadcrumbs and they took away the flavor. i thought this recipe had too much labor time- flavor just wasn't there. I would also try to replace pecans for breadcrumbs as mentioned above. I thought the thyme got lost - maybe a stronger herb as well. cranberry texture was great.

I'm not a big fan of cranberries (or fruit and meat in any combination, really), but I tried this recipe because salmon is the only fish my husband likes and I'm always trying to do something different with it. I used the panko breadcrumbs and would recommend that. The cranberry was very subtle along with the other flavors. This recipe was weeknight easy, and extremely tasty. I will definitely use it again!

This was an excellent recipe. Breadcrumbs added great texture and flavor. I had no problem getting them crispy. The mixing of the cranberry with thyme was wonderful. Other reviewers are nuts.Substitue 2 teaspoons of dried tyme for fresh.

This recipe is VASTLY improved, in both taste and texture, if you substitute chopped pecans in place of the Panko or breadcrumbs. (Chop the pecans into small pieces - do not grind into pecan meal). I also cut back on the Thyme. With those changes I'd rate this recipe four forks. Just be sure that no one is allergic to nuts.

This was one of the best salmon recipes I have ever made! Definitely use the panko breadcrumbs, they added texture to the topping as they are very crispy when baked.

I thought this recipe was fantastic! While testing out different seafood recipes to include in our Thanksgiving menu this year, we tried this one and it was a hit! I included all of the butter in the breadcrumb mixture and after covering the salmon, I sprayed it with a generous amount of olive oil. It really added flavor to the dish, not to mention a great crust on top. Make sure to keep a close eye on the salmon while it bakes. You want the top to get golden-brown, and make sure you take the fish out of the oven, while it is still pink in the center. This allows for a very moist, delicate fish. The fish will continue to cook through after you remove it from the oven.

I can't get excited about this one. Nothing special. I gave it one fork because it was edible but I won't bother making it again. Something was lacking even though I made it exactly as listed.
