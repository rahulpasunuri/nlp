I was skeptical because I've seen giardiniera and never cared for the look of it but man, this chicken salad is senational. I catered a luncheon, used the regular (not the hot) giardiniera and the people just couldn't stop raving.

What a nice surprise! Super easy to make and very tasty! I used Kewpie-half mayo.

Best chicken salad ever! I used half mayo, half 2% Greek yogurt. I found the "hot" version of the giardiniera I bought seemed mushy so used the "mild" version and it was still great.

Wow! I was not expecting this to be as good as it was! I used plain greek yogurt instead of mayo, and I did not really add too much of the oil from the pickled veggies because it already gets in the mix from just the veggies. I had leftover chicken breasts that were coooked with herbs, so I did not add any extra herbs. Great, easy recipe! Hint: the pickled veggies usually have salt, so there is no need to add any extra seasonings.

Great go-to recipe for left over chicken.

Best chicken salad I have ever had. Makes 1 quart. I prefer to drop the dark meat and make it with just chicken breastk.

This was such a nice change from the tried and true celery-onion-mayo or curry-apple-mayo versions of chicken salad! I skipped the herbs and added some chopped pepperoncini, sliced green olives and rinsed-off marinated artichoke hearts. I suggest mixing the mayo and giarineira juice together separately and adding it in just a bit at a time, I definitely wanted less than was called for.

Very good and very simple to make. I didn't have any salad herbs, but other than that, made it exactly as written.

Wow this was great! I added some celery and substituted banana pickles and juice for the Italian veggies. Yummy!

This can't get any easier. I try to have this in the fridge when the hordes descend. I prefer all breast meat and caution everyone to be careful of the veggies: I've backed off of all spicy and now try to do half and half. I've had more than one guest tell me "this is the best chicken salad I've ever had."

I used a sotto aceti type of giardiniera, and didn't have any lettuce on hand. Since I didn't have leftover chicken, I poached a few breasts in herbes de Provence and then left the salad herbs out of the recipe. This was fantastic on a variety of different breads. The sotto aceti really lightened up the salad. This is a great option for an atypical chicken salad.

This was a really good chicken salad recipe. I'm pregnant and some foods and smells really get to me, so I left out the basil and salad herbs, cut down on the giardiniera juices, and only used 1/4 cup mayo. I'm sure I will want to try this recipe the regular way later when I'm ok with the smells. The pickled vegetables offer a nice contrast to the chicken, and the whole recipe is not overly mayo'd like some. I will use this again.

OMGosh, this is simply delish! I took it to a get-together and got raves. Instead of the toasted bread, I split a round of 3 cheese focaccia, across the middle and filled with the chicken salad and cut it into individual servings. mmmmm

For a chicken salad this is a four. It is better than any I have ever had.

One of my favorite summer recipes for a picnic! I made aioli and substituted that for mayo in the recipe and the aioli gives a nice garlic undertone that really works well with the other flavors! I also like adding a few additional pepperoncinis and because I'm a major olive lover, I chop up a few green olives and add those too.

I didn't think that I liked chicken salad,until I found this one! It had no resemblance to the bland, mayonnaise-smothered blobs of my childhood (thank goodness). We now keep giardinara in our pantry when we need to get our chicken salad fix! (some addictions are not such bad things :) Give this recipe a try.

This is completely delicious! I don't know what led me to make chicken salad, but I would totally make this again!

I really liked this chicken salad. An unusual mix of flavors. I don't have "dried salad herbs" so I just used all fresh herbs from my garden. It was kind of messy on the bread slices. next time I will try tortillas or a hollowed out baquette.

This was incredible. I made it with chopped celery and added cashew chips for the presentation with a twig of fresh basil on the side of each dish. Try this and you will never make chicken salad the way you did before.

I used Bar B Que chicken & served the salad in Pitas. Very very good!

Nice change from basic chicken salad. Found I didn't need salt. Also, used Herbes de Provence rather than the Italian spices. Will make again. KIMBER

Very good. This is now my husband's favorite way to eat leftover chicken. I also don't bother with the herbs, and I use fat free mayo. It is equally good on bread or just on its own.

An excellent lunch or light supper. Sometimes we have it on bread, sometimes just eat the chicken salad with a green salad on the side. I reduced the mayo to 1/3 cup, which seems right for me--the mayo doesn't overpower the textures of the chicken and giardiniera. And I don't bother with the dried herbs--it's plenty flavorful without them. The whole family likes this dish enough that I don't wait for leftover chicken. I often sauté chicken breasts and cool them to use later. Great, simple dish. Try it!

Good stuff! I substitued Italian seasoning for the dried salad herbs (no great insight, just didn't have the salad herbs on hand). Makes a nice summer lunch with a bowl of gazpacho and a Boston Lager.
