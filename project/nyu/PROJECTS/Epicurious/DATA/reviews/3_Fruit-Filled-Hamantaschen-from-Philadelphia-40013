I used only two cups of flour but the dough was still too dry (I used butter). A few tablespoons of water did the trick though. The filling was delicious.

Good basic hamantaschen recipe. Although I know I should prefer the homemade filling, I can't help but return to the Solo filling of my youth for a real nostalgic treat. I double the recipe, add the zest and 1 tablespoon juice of an orange, use 5 cups flour plus a little for rolling. No problem whatsoever with the dough, even without chilling.

I just made this recipe and it turned out perfectly! You must incorporate the butter/sugar/egg/vanilla fully and use the full 3cups of the flour mixture. After chilling the dough, I had no problem rolling it on parchment paper. Instead of the recipe filling, I used dried apricots which I stewed with a little lemon zest & water to the desired consistency. Well worth the effort. I would definitely make this again!

This dough was indeed very difficult to work with. Very sticky - stuck to rolling pin, table, me. I used cornstarch to roll out to reduce stickiness without sacrificing tenderness, which helped, I think. Dough was also difficult to shape and kept breaking. Some cookies were so mangled I had to throw them away before baking, which goes against my very nature. The cookies themselves taste great, but I'm not sure it's worth the trouble of messing with the dough. I usually use a cream cheese dough that is much better behaved. For filling, I use Solo brand; not universally available, but a perfect consistency for hamantaschen. They have apricot, almond, cherry, poppyseed, and lekvar - all the faves. I have also used choc chips and Nutella (excellent). Am wondering about dulce de leche next time...

My alltime favorite cookie recipe. Follow the directions and they are easy to prepare. I wouldn't try to fiddle with the filling too much, I've experimented with some preserve based fillings and the cookie ends up collapsing.

I tried these cookies 2 nights in a row using raspberry jam instead of the traditional poppy seed or apricot filling. The dough would not hold together when pinched, causing the filling to leak out. What a mess! However, I will attempt them again next year, using a different recipe.

These were a big disappointment. We didn't even get them in the oven, they were so greasy and delicate. They were crumbling as we rolled them out and falling apart when we filled them. We're trying another recipe...

Only made the dough; it was really great! Authentic taste-- we also added 1/4c OJ; used powdered sugar to roll dough--can't wait til next yr.

I checked Joan Nathan's book and the correct amount of flour is 2and1/2 cups to 3 cups. I found the dough a little dry so I added a little orange juice.

This is a wonderful, easy, tasty recipe. I made the Hamantaschen last year and filled them with chocolate chips. They were the hit of the neighborhood!

what does one half to 3 cups of flour mean ?
