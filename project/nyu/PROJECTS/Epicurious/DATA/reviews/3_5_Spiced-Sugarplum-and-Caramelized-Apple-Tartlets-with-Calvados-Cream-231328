I made these for our Gourmet. Several steps to the recipe and fussiness with the apples and they didn't look anything like the picture. I think the mistake was cooking the apples just a little bit too long to get nice thin slices - like with a mandolin if you look closely at the picture. The picture makes them look big and the pastry edges curled - they are small and the edges didn't curl. The calvados cream saved the presentation and tasted great too!

It was a lot easier than it looks probably because the dough is just puff pastry. The only time consuming part was arranging the apple pieces into flowers and that actually was easy to do and looks just like the beautiful picture on epicurious. My calvados cream was not as runny looking as theirs (it was more like whipped cream), but I only used half as much calvados and it still came out smelling quite strong. It was a must-do part of this recipe - tasted awesome.

Delicious and beautiful! These pastries were slightly time consuming to make (especially arranging the apples to form a rose) but completely worth the effort! They look (and taste!) impressive and are fairly easy to make. You can use Applejack instead of Calvados, but a small bottle of the Calvados will only set you back $15 and the difference in taste is well worth it worth it. I'd use a little less of the liquor in the cream.

This was really quite easy to make, and looked beautiful! I don't know if my apples were much larger than "medium", because I piled a lot on each tart, and still had some leftover, though. The cream isn't as liquid as the photo implies, and has a pretty strong alcohol flavor despite the cooking. All said, however, these were really good, and relatively stress free to prepare. I will keep this recipe for future use. Everyone raved about them.

This recipe was outstanding. My niece loved it so much I sent her back to college w/some that were frozen, and she popped them in the oven for her friends and they were a hit. By far one of THE best recipes ever. Easy and delicious! It is also getting easier to find Calvados. You can use any apple liquor, but Calvados is the best.

I had to modify this one somewhat due to limited ingredient availability but the results were impressive. I used dried cherries instead of prunes, and because they refused to mash I heaped them in the middle of the dough and encircled them with overlapping apple slices. Very attractive. The employee of the rural liquor store was totally ignorant of the existance of calvados, so I settled on a bottle of $8 apricot flavored brandy instead, fully expecting it to taste of cough syrup. A few experimental sips were encouraging enough to forge ahead, and the apricotish flavor actually turned out to be a subtle compliment to the cherry and apple. I'm sure calvados would impart a more sophisticated flavor but if you're on a budget, save yourself $30 and use the hiram walker. The only step that gave me any trouble was 'folding' the cream into the brady egg mixture. I had to wisk the dickens out of it to get it to even combine and although the flavor was nice it still looked slightly broken. Raves from my family.

This is hands down the most beautiful and delicious non-chocolate Christmas dessert I have ever made. I will make this again and again. I didn't think it took any longer to make than other special desserts and so much of it can be done ahead of time. This dessert is worth it!!!! (You could cut the Calvados Cream recipe in half though - it did make a lot)

Very painstaking to make, but well worth the effort. My guests loved them! Probably one of the better Christmas desserts I have tasted! This is mostly due to the Calvados, which is a brandy used most often with Christmas pudding. If you have time to spare I highly encourage you to make this.

It's too complicated to make, too many ingrdients and the product is not worth the effort.

I keep hearing about Calvados being a puff pastry. However when I read 2 tablespoons Calvados and checked it out myself and it is not a puff pastry as some alleged. It is an apple brandy. It usually is around 30-40 a bottle. I tried this desert and loved it. Also I recomend just tasting the wonderful flavor of this brandy. Very good

One fork is misleading. I now know what Calvados is. I know where to find the pastry. What I don't know is whether anyone has actually made this dessert. Before I invest in the Calvados, I surely would like to know.

Looked up Calvados, and apparently it is an apple brandy:-)

At the risk of sounding ignorant, what are "calvados"??? The recipe sounds great, but I have no idea what calvados is. Please help!

clearly, YOU can't proofread. It says 1 puff pastry sheet preferrably all butter in the recipe. Nice try.

The pastry is there, you just have to hunt for it! =) There is a mistake in formatting, so you'll find the pastry info stuck to the end of the apples description.
