I loved this, but my wife first couldn't stand the smell, and the flavor was just too strong for her. If you have someone in your family that can't handle strong odors or very savory flavors don't make it in the effort to make peace.

I made this with asion flavoured grilled pork. The corn flavours were exceptionally tasty!

This was excellent! I just used frozen corn. This was such a good twist. I will definitely make this one again!

GREAT marinade. Never used it on corn, actually! But fantastic to marinate salmon and shrimp before grilling. I usually double the recipe, reserving the extra sauce for the table.

Delicious and different, especially with a simple meal like fishwiches and cole slaw. Almost passed this one by, based on the reviews. College kids having vienna sausage and corn? Refugees (still stoned) from the 60's? Anyway, a tasty change from plain, buttered corn on the cob.
