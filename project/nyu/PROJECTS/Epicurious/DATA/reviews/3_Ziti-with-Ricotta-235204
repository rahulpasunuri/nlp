Yummy.Added some parmesan, lemon juice as someone suggested. Some cayenne pepper for some spice.

It was an easy and simple recipe and I liked that the most. The flavors were fine, if not a bit on the bland side. So far it is the best recipe that I have found that comes close to a dish I had a long time ago and absolutely love.

This recipe is good, but I think it could be better. Now that I have made it, I would add extra pepper, the pecorino to the sauce and the zest of a lemon for that extra zingy pop. We noticed that as it cools, it gets a much better flavor, so not eating it piping hot would be a good idea too.

Was great for leftover pasta, and I also added small cubes of smoked cheddar and topped it with chopped green onions. Delicious, and easy to improvise with, by adding other ingredients.

as is this recipe was pretty blah. I didn't use the finest ricotta, but I did use really good goat cheese, and it was still a little to plain for my taste. However, I added a pinch of nutmeg and another of cayenne, and that helped quite a bit.
