This is really easy and really good. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and it turned out great. You can easily double the chicken to four breasts and not double the sauce. There is plenty.

I'm not going to rate this one because I made way too many adjustments to accommodate what I had on hand. To begin with, I fried one piece of bacon in the skillet. I reserved the grease, set the bacon aside, and added 2 tbsp. butter and 1 tbsp. olive oil to the skillet. I pounded to boneless, skinless breasts to 1/2" thickness, sprinkled with black pepper and tarragon on each side, and seared in the oil combo on each side at med-high heat for about 4 minutes. I then set the breasts aside with the bacon and covered tightly with foil. Meanwhile I sauteed 1 shallot, 1 small yellow onion, and 2 cloves of garlic in the oils until lightly browned and softened. Then, added 1/2 cup rice vinegar (didn't have any other kind)and 2 tsp. tarragon, brought the sauce to a boil and reduced for about 5 minutes. After reducing pretty thoroughly, I added the 1 c. reduced sodium chicken broth and let it all meld for a bit on med-low heat. I cut the bacon into pieces, put it in the sauce, and let the breasts sit in the sauce for a few minutes each side. I served it with toasted quinoa. Overall, sweetheart and I would give it 3 forks. The recipe is ok, but I don't think it showed off the tarragon to its full advantage, so I'm going to keep looking for something that knocks my socks off. (And maybe do a better job of sticking to the recipe.)

This is an excellent dish which is very easy. Try it with the curried potatoes and onions on this site.

OMG that was delicious. It has just the right blend of piquant vinegar and zesty tarragon. I used boneless skinless chicken breast steaks because I detest bones and it was fabulous!

My fiance hates onions, but he just can't get enough of this Chicken recipe, it's his favorite.

We had pretty large breast halves and they took more like 25 minutes to cook through rather than 12. Sauce was very vinegary, so I added a pat of butter at the end to mellow it out a bit. Overall, just okay. Fine for something different as a one time weeknight meal. But I would never make this for company.

Delicious recipe; I loved the flavor. I ran out of fresh tarragon so I used dried (converted Tablespoons to teaspoons). The vinegar took longer to reduce than the recipe indicated but that was no big deal. However, next time I would wait to return chicken to skillet because the 12 minutes as indicated in the recipe was too long for my chicken since I sliced the breasts in half. But overall, I loved this recipe and I would make it again.

Overall simple to make. A bit heavy on the vingar - too much for my wife. Interesting to make and experiment with - but not great.

Good variation on a basic preparation. Try these changes for quicker, lower-fat but not dried-out chicken: Use skinless/boneless breasts, add a tablespoon of olive oil to the butter, then brown the chicken at medium-high about 4-5 minutes per side, which should cook it through. Remove the chicken, cover it with foil and skip the poaching step - just reduce and finish the sauce, then put the chicken back in the pan for a couple of minutes to absorb the sauce.

Wonderful Bistro dish! I found I had to cook it longer to get the red out, but otherwise it was absolutely terrific.

This is so good! But I had to make some changes...Didn't have any tarragon vinegar on hand, so I used 1/4 cup rice vinegar + 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, and added 1/2 teaspoon of crushed dried tarragon leaves. And some more dried tarragon in the sauce..I deboned & de-skinned the chicken before serving, then spooned the sauce over...Delicious! And better the next day!

This was not bad. I would recommend this. It wasn't GREAT. Keeping the skin on keeps the breast moist, but robs the meat of flavor. Otherwise, this is pretty darn good. Be careful to cook the breast long enough... the meat near the bone may need a little more time past what's recommended here.

Delicious and original! Was great for my Bastille Day celebration. Made it for 6 people and everyone wanted the recipe afterwards. Will surely make it again... it is so good and simple!

My husband and I were in Paris a few weeks ago, and we had the most wonderful chicken with tarragon. I'd been hoping to find a recipe that would approach that dish, and this one did. I used good tarragon vinegar and tarragon from my garden. The vinegar took longer to reduce than the recipe indicated, but the flavor was superb. The recipe was so easy to make, too!

I've made this recipe twice and it is wonderfully easy and full of flavor. The key here is the tarragon...not replacing it with thyme, or all the other versions which have nothing to do with the original recipe. I used a very high quality tarragon vinegar which I believe is the difference after perusing the other comments. A nice dish for week-day entertaining.

Loved it, it was so moist and delicous. I am makining it again tonight.

Neither my wife nor I am crazy about tarragon. I replaced the tarragon vinegar with raspberry vinegar, and added a chiffonade of basil. It was delicious!

Add my name to the list of disappointed cooks. The flavor was rather bland, had no zing.

I made this with thighs, because I had read too many chicken recipes prior to grocery shopping, and forgot which body parts corresponded to which recipe! (I actually prefer dark meat, but my husband doesn't). I though it was wonderful, and will make again with the breasts. For the cook who thought the vinegar had too much tang, I found that it took much longer to reduce this than indicated, and it would certainly have this flavor if not reduced fully.

This dish was pretty good. Its nothing special, but you can prepare it quickly. I will not go out of my way to make it again, but if I was looking for a quick and easy recipe and had the ingredients on hand I would make this dish.

This recipe was HUGELY dissapointing. Would never make it again.

Sounded promising, but I found it very disappointing. Make sure you use good quality vinegar - mine seemed to impart a "cheap" tang to the dish, which was quite unpleasant. Will not make again.

With the last of the fresh Tarragon (French,not Russian, in Australia for the season, I used this recipe with friends as an ordinary Friday night dinner after work. One left her chair to check she was here on the correct day by the calendar....she assumed she had made a mistake and it was a special recipe for Saturday night.....so easy to make and the suggested vegetables an absolute hit!....thanks again for sending meals which take little preparation but taste like those at the Hilton at a fraction of the cost...love em

Used free-range chicken breasts and dried tarragon as the market had no fresh. It was still good, next time I'll seach harder for fresh.

We substituted thyme for taragon also (no fresh taragon on hand today) - just delicious. Served it with some pasta and I was afraid there wouldn't be enough sauce for pasta too, but there was, and the consistency was great.

Great flavor, easy to make. Nice balance of flavors. I did boil it down a bit longer in the last step for a little bit thicker sauce.
