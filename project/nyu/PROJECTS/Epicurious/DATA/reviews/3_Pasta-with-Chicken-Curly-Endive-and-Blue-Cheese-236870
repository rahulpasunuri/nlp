Nice, and a good use for blue cheese, though I might cut it a bit next time with 1/2 ricotta or another mildly flavored cheese. Arugula was a great substitute for endive. The walnuts are an absolute must! They add crunch and an earthiness that helps to balance the bite of the blue cheese. And I'm speaking as someone who really likes blue cheese.

My husband and I both loved this, with some admitted changed. I used arugula, as endive is very hard to find here in Istanbul. The blue cheese melts into the sauce beautifully. I would reduce the amount of rosemary.

I really loved the flavor of this dish! I was concerned the blue cheese would make the pasta too creamy, but it added just the right flavor. I only added 1/4 of the curly endive - my husband is not a big fan of warm greens! It was very easy and was a wow for a casual dinner for friends.

This was an easy, delicious recipe for a weekday dinner. I would recommend cutting the chicken into bite-sized chunks rather than strips since you'll be tossing everything together anyhow. If, like someone else who posted, you don't like blue cheese (who doesn't like a good roquefort, I don't know, but I digress...), you can always substitute a quality, flavorful cheese (keep in mind that the recipe will get much of it's flavor from the cheese). I also used a bit less cheese than called for as a calorie saving measure. I used 5 ounces rather than the 9 the recipe calls for. If calories don't concern you, then by all means, use more cheese.

I added an oriental dressing to this, and it was still pretty boring. It was ok, but I won't make it again.

looks like a good base recipe,I'm going to fool with the cheeese sauce a bit. Bleu cheese is who's favorite?
