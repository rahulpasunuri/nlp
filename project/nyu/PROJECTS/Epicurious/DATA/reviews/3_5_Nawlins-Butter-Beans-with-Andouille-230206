I used fresh beans and this correlated pretty well. Next time I will saute the garlic, onion and carrots for a minute, add the tomatoes and cook all that down a while before I add the rest. Great, healthy idea though!

My family of 4 adults likes it and it makes enough for us. We don't eat huge portions, but we do eat more than a bird :) I can't seem to find chicken andouille sausage so I usually use chicken hot italian sausage instead and we like that. It's quick and easy and tastes good!

I forgot to put the thyme and garlic in, otherwise I followed directions precisely. We thought it was fantastic and was more than enough for my family including my husband who is a big eater. Will definitely make this again. This is a "keeper" in our home.

We had fun with this recipe, and enjoyed the results throughly! I substituted vegetarian sausage, and browned the slices before adding to the pot. I also caramelized the onions to add flavor, used local Christmas lima beans, and doubled the recipe (per the previous review). A dash of Flesh Feast hot sauce, and we were ready to roll with some corn bread - sweet, spicy, and healthy. Works for me!

Other than the andouille, I didn't taste anything in this recipe that reminded me of N'awlins. It may be nutritious and quick, but it wasn't particulary tasty. Unless your family "eats like a bird" I would suggest doubling the recipe to feed four, or better yet--find a different recipe. Oh, yeah--I thought a 1/2 cup of thyme was a little much. Maybe that was my mistake--I should have used the 1/2 cup.
