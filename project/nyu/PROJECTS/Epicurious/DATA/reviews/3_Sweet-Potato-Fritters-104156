THis was a hit at my hannukah party--competed w/the traditional latkes very well. I substituted baked butternut squash for the yams, which worked really well. People especially liked the mint-yogurt sauce on them. I used peanut oil for frying, and drained them on brown paper to absorb the grease.

This was a really great dish...I just starting cooking this year and while there is a fair amount of prepare time, you can refrigerate the dough and make it ahead of time. Also, I don't like mint much so I left the mint out and put a little clove and nutmeg in them, so they tasted sweeter. Served with honey mustard dipping sauce. A HUGE hit with everyone last night.

This was a huge success at the dinner party we threw for my parents, however, they are a fair bit of work! I made it entirely in the food processor-which was handy. But when it came to deep frying them-watch out! The sugar content in these is fairly high, so they brown very fast. The larger ones didn't cook in the middle, so I had to cut them and refry them. However, the sweet potato/mint mixture-while perhaps unorthodox-is a GREAT flavour combo. I would make these again, but I would have to be really in the mood for the work involved.
