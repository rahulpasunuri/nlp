i used chicken tenders and they came out dry, maybe i overcooked it or cooked at too high heat? i think i would marinade the chicken with the sauce first then cook

I didn't have fresh ginger, so I just used ginger powder. I used a chardonnay and accidentally used 3/4 of the can of chicken broth..not 3/4 of a cup. So I improvised and added a little bit more of everything else. Lte it cook for about 55 minutes on low, flipped thie pieces of chicken 3 times, and I served it with brown rice and broccoli. It was great! I do suggest straining the fat with that thing that looks like a measuring cup but has a spout for the fat. When I refrigerated my leftovers, there was a gross layer of fat on top.

This was a pretty big hit. It took much longer than I thought it would, but it was well worth the wait. I couldn't find Mirin anywhere, so I just used a red table wine instead. I also used brown sugar (and over twice as much) in lieu of regular. I would also highly recommend throwing the chicken in the broiler afterwards. Great flavor. I topped mine with scallions and sesame seeds. I also used chicken tenderloin. Mouth watering!

A great main dish which I will definitely make again *with* modifications suggested by other reviewers. I substituted mirin for sake, used brown instead of white sugar, and just sliced ginger and smashed & peeled garlic cloves instead of mincing. Did *not* reduce liquid to 1 1/2 cups, which would have been unbearably salty--instead, I defatted it and then thickened it with 1 Tbsp cornstarch. Finished chicken under the broiler for about 3-4 minutes, served with sauce and white rice. Everyone loved it, even my 6-year-old, who normally complains about everything.

I substituted the Splenda/Sugar baking mix for the sugar and it was still very good. The fresh ginger and mirin as suggested by another reviewer made a tremendous difference. Quite simple and fast, a good dish for us lazy singletons.

Thank you chef below. All of those suggestions were great!

The first thing I ever learned from my Japan-born mom was chicken teriyaki. This was similar, but here are some tips I've added over the years - mirin is good, but sweet, so add sugar to taste (it's personal preference, but I think there is too little sugar in this particular recipe). I like to use a mix of half sake/half mirin. I also use low-salt soy sauce (the amount of soy sauce in this particular recipe should be about 3/4 cup rather than 1 cup)and grated fresh ginger is an absolute must (you can get away from using garlic, but ginger is key). I don't usually add chicken broth - in fact, I add very little additional liquid (maybe a bit of water if I am using regular soy sauce). Another key is NOT to use the braising sauce to pour over the chicken - that's overkill! Braising the chicken adds tons of flavor on it's own and if it's done right, the flavor is already permeated all the way through. Also, as the Chef from Illinois noted, taking a few extra minutes to finish the chicken off in the broiler is great - it gives the chicken a deep, carmelized color and a crispy skin. Even if you take the skin off before eating, it still tastes 100% better. Final tip: chill and de-fat the braising liquid and freeze for other uses - it's strong, so just a bit is great for quick stir-fries, etc. ps - Use drumettes with this recipe and it will always be the first thing gone at a buffet table.

The classic teriyaki sauce defined. For those who prefer their skin a little crispier, cut the chicken in half (along backbone), baste w/ sauce and broil skin side up for 6 or so minutes. Also, sauce should be refridged for at least 2 hours before serving to allow fat to rise and sauce to become gelatanous. Skim off fat and reheat while chicken is in broiler. Serve with tempura battered yams (fried) and broccoli blanched in lemon water. B.Coulter, Executive Chef

It is great if you are a teriyaki fan. I think teriyaki in general is kind of dull. Try adding a small can of pineapple sauce and a bit less soy. We used ginger from a jar, so it was easy and we had everything on hand.

Out of necessity, I made this chicken in the crockpot. Per other reviewers' suggestions, I sliced the ginger to be removed at the ned and used mirin for the wine. I felt the saltiness from the soy sauce was overwhelming, and I wound up adding a lot more sugar. Next time I will go easy on the soy sauce and use honey or brown sugar. I regret that I did not have time to fiddle with the cooking liquid; however, I think the recipe is basically good with lots and lots of potential for tweaking (that's the fun part anyway!). In the crockpot, the meat is of course lovely and tender; no sauce is necessary. I recommend roasted asparagus and rice or crusty bread with chopped scallions on top of the chicken.

I made this so I didn't have to heat up my oven. I used ground ginger and sake. The chicken was very moist and tender. The sauce was really not needed. I did put some on my rice though...

The chardany I used was skanky so I added my glass to the mix. . . We loved it!

I found this to be very salty. And yes, I did use the low-salt broth. The sauce was so overpoweringly salty that I had to throw it out! However, the chicken on its own was tolerable. Infact, my boyfriend ate it all.

I had to make something quick and this was it!! As I was throwing the ingredients in the pot, I realized that I didn't have chicken stock or sherry. My quick fix was chicken boullion and Chardonnay. Still came out nice and the meat was falling off the bone. Finger lickin' good!!

I made some alterations (many from other suggestions in the reviews) and my dinner party loved it. Served it with steamed jasmine rice and crisp steamed broccoli with ginger and garlic. Here're are my changes: -slice garlic and ginger; remove after boiling -use brown sugar -thicken sauce at end with cornstarch & water -use Mirin as your wine

Outstanding. I also used Tim's additions (substituted sherry for the sake and used ginger slices). The flavor is more intense if you prepare the chicken a day or two ahead of time. Just add the cornstarch as your final step when you reheat it. I also skinned the chicken and it still turned out great!! I served this with the "Japanese Rice Timbales with Black and White Sesame Seeds" recipe found on this website. A bowl of edame (soybeans in the pod) rounded out the meal. Thanks for an easy, quick, no-mess recipe!!

I agree with tim who said this recipe has a solid foundation and I used some of tim's ideas to tweak this recipe also. I put in one green onion cut into thirds at the beginning and used dry white wine but only 1/4 cup light brown sugar and sliced the ginger to remove at the end. I also used cornstarch and water to give the sauce a glossy finish. One thing I did that improved this recipe very much was to baste the resting chicken with the reducing sauce which gave it a glorious color as well as further rich flavor. The chicken was falling-off-the-bone delicious and the sauce was superb.

The foundation of this recipe is solid, but it needs to be improved to be rated good. I suggest adding 1/2 cup of light brown sugar. Also, I suggest using 2 or 3 1/4-inch slices of ginger, instead of the chopped, which should be removed after boiling. Another improvement might be to use sherry instead of the sake or wine, this will add more flavor. One final improvement might be to add 1 Tbs. cornstarch + 2 Tbs. water to the boiling sauce to thicken. Serving with some sliced pineapple is also good.
