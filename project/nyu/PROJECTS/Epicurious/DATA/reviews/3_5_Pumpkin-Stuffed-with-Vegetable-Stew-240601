Oi, I see this recipe and I am reminded of the heart breaking thanksgiving when I spent two days and tons of money making this only to have the pumpkin crack at the dinner table. It is pretty, but not that delicious. If you want a show stopper do the pumpkin part but fill it with something easy like dressing.

I love the challenge of a recipe like this because it gives me a chance to have some real fun in the kitchen (on a day off). The result was a fragrant, flavorful stew with real depth. The wine sauce is brilliant. The pumpkin left a tenacious lacquer on my stainless roasting pan that only a brillo pad and serious elbow grease could remove. Clean-up not-with-standing I will do this again.

We have cooked this dish for 2 thanksgivings and it is fabulous. We do not make the fancy vegtable broth, but we just by our own and it still turns out fabulous. What a wonderful center piece and a great veggie option for any vegatarians or vegans who come over for thanksgiving. This is worth the work! Your meat eaters will love this also. Note: I purchased the seitan from Whole Foods

The process of making this was EPIC... required several days to do all the steps. Wish there was more of this rich, rustic stew for all the effort! This is definitely a special occasion dish.

I made this for Christmas, so large pumpkins were hard to come by. I used individual squashes which made for a nice presentation. I didn't roast the veggies for the sauce and it tasted pretty good. I used jarred roasted peppers. It is a labor intensive recipe, but can be done ahead for company.

Made this last year for Thanksgiving. . . Less then thrilled about this recipe. Looks AMAZING. . . Tastes less then average. Actually ended up in the trash. I followed this recipe to the tee. The only thing out of my control which I think blew it was someone added to much of the gravy to the veggies. But it was a lot of work and no reward.

There are far better uses for your time, money, and pumpkin. This took me better part of a year to make, and afterwards, my kitchen looked like it was hit by a tsunami wrapped in a tornado. The roasted vegetable and wine sauce turned out like soup, so it wasn't much of a sauce. No one but me enjoyed the stew, and I only did after I mixed it with mashed potatoes and salt. It was actually good, but not worth the incredible amount of time and effort...and money! I got all my ingredients from the farmer's market. And seitan is really not too appetizing. I would have doubled the mushrooms and added other vegetables. Looked cool. Wish I could say the same for my kitchen.

This is the second year we have made this recipe by popular demand. It is a show-stopper and absolutely delicious. And yes it does take all seven hours to make it. If you make this recipe, you don't need any other veggies at your table because this has you covered. I would recommend to make the stock and the sauce ahead of time. You can roast the veggies a day ahead and combine everything thanksgiving morning. I would suggest to time this carefully so you are just going from oven to table because it would be a pain to reheat this.

Quite good. We are not vegetarians by any means so this dish was a little bit of a stretch for us, but I needed a healthy side that was relatively low calorie. I went ahead and left out the roasted pumpkin entirely as it seemed too much trouble for a side dish. I also left out the seitan and added 5 fingerling potatoes that I had on hand. I also used extra chanterelles because I love them. It is easy but time consuming and was relieved when people liked it. I'm glad I took others' advice and did the wine sauce the day before.

I was so excited about a vegetarian centerpiece to rival a turkey. However this took all day to make. And it really didn't taste that special.

I've made this twice -- once with the pumpkin, once without. Although the pumpkin is a showstopper, it is a lot of trouble. The stew was just as good without. I made the sauce without wine and froze it. Believe it or not, it kept for fourteen months!

Tasted great, but I wouldn't try to make it all in one day again unless I didn't have any time restraints. I would probably do this over a period of about 2-3 days. Definitely recommend making the sauce the day before! It makes a HUGE difference in cooking time.

I'm an experienced, above-average cook, but this didn't work for me - especially disappointing given the great reviews and the amount of work!! We ended up throwing out most of the pumpkin - no one ate it and we didn't want to either, it was tasteless. Kept the left over stew - it's so-so. If I were to try again, I'd use lower oven temperatures to roast the veggies, which tasted heavy and a bit burnt, and likely just use Kitchen Basics stock with maybe some added fresh tomato, cut back on the sun-dried tomatoes, and make more roux. I'd add some sweet potato and/or butternut squash to the stew. And probably stuff halved butternut squashes. But then it would be something very different, and lighter, which would be good.

Good, but SOOOO much work. The idea of putting stew in a pumpkin is a cute, one, but make an easier stew to put in the pumpkin and save yourself a day.

I was the first reviewer back in 2007 and I made it again this past weekend for a company brunch that was catered. Everyone went for this instead of the catered food -- even the servers from the catering company loved it. Thanks again, Ruth Cousineau, for this amazing recipe. It takes a long time to make, but if you do it over a few days (sauce, vegetable bake/pepper roast and then baking the pumpkin itself) it is bad at all. And the results are heavenly. If you make some extra sauce, you will be well served. Freeze it and use it as a gravy base.

This was really spectacular. I just made a half recipe as a tester for Thanksgiving, and my roommate and I devoured the whole thing immediately. I thought the stock was too tomato-ey when I first tasted it, but mixed with the other veggies it balances well. I left out the seitan and added an extra 1/2 lb mushrooms and a few golden beets. Well worth the effort, but I highly suggest making the stock ahead of time as it's quite a process. I made a double batch and will freeze the extras.

Oh, and I used hulled barley (cooked earlier in the day) in place of the seitan and it was delicious.

I made two of these last night as part of a buffet for 30 people. They were beautiful and delicious. Made the stock on Friday; roasted the vegetables on Saturday; put it all together on Sunday. I would recommend watching the cooking time. My two 8-lb pumpkins were nearly mush by the end of the 90 minutes. Next time, I will cut back the time in the oven or back off on the temperature.

This looks wonderful, but has anyone tried adding sausage for the die-hard meat eaters?

How to serve: I just placed each pumpkin on a nice platter (I'd made three medium-small pumpkins) and stuck a big spoon in. People scooped their stew out. I told them to be sure to scrape a bit of the pumpkin from the side of the 'bowl' when they did. Worked well.

I've never made anything like this before. How do you serve this - do you slice up the pumpkin, skin and all, and serve itwith the roasted veggies? It sounds great - just not sure about the pumpkin.

I brought 3 pumpkins-full of this recipe as a vegetable side dish to a large-group omnivore Thanksgiving dinner last year. If I was a better person, I would feel bad about that, because the dish stole all the attention and accolades from my sister-in-law's perfectly beautiful turkey. Yes, it's a lot of work, but when a dinner crowd of 28 people agrees that it is the most stunning, tasty thing they have ever had at a Thanksgiving dinner, and you have to write epicurious.com on scratch paper for about half of them so they can get to the recipe...well worth it.

This is one of the most delicious things I've ever made. I had a bunch of meat-eaters over for Thanksgiving, and they didn't mind not having turkey after they ate some of this! I will definitely make it again in future years. The vegetable wine sauce is incredible. I'm thinking of trying to adapt this to make it without the pumpkin (just roasted vegetables with wine sauce) to cut off some of the preparation time and adding some squash.

This recipe makes no sense. In the ingredient list there is a title for "Roasted-vegetable and wine sauce" but no ingredients listed. There is no wine listed in the ingredients at all. Also, there are no peppers listed in the ingredients but the instructions say to roast some. Does anyone read these recipes before they publish them?!

All I can say is for the amount of time and money... it was so not worth it. I couldn't resist the picture and the idea of cooking a stew in the pumpkin but never again. It just wasn't very good.

The recipe is needlessly complicated, but the concept is strong and the result received rave reviews from veggies and meat eaters alike. I omitted the celery root completely and added in turnips-- I think that resulted in an overall better flavor pairing between sauce and base. That said, this really is a recipe for what you have on hand as others have said. Also used pearl barley instead of seitan (soak barley overnight and simmer in soaking liquid plus about a cup of sauce for 45 minutes, drain well before adding to root veg). If you are competent with a knife and streamline the recipe, prep time is about what you would do for a weekend supper for company. I used two smaller pumpkins (saturating the stem with oil) and I would recommend it - more pumpkin per bowl served. I would make this again.

This was beautiful and was full of flavor.I would make this again in stages.I froze the vegetables from the stock thinking that I could make"dirty mashed potatos"or add them to a soup.I used regular celery along with turnips and sweet potatos in place of parsnips.Just wanted to use what I already had on hand.

If anyone is interested there is a fabulous recipe called "Spicy fall Stew baked in a pumpkin" in the new vegetarian magazine. It is easy to make and delicious. It has more of a Spanish flair with hominy and tomatillos. Again, that is the 2008 Vegetarian times magazine.

The recipe is quite complicated and can be somewhat simplified. But it turned out great and was a hit at last Thanksgiving an not only with the Vegans and Vegetarians. It was completely carved up and several people took home leftover pumpkin and filling. I would leave out the seitan as most of us fount it too rubbery in texture and added little to the flavor. Some nice beans would work as additional protein. I agree that more sauce is better with this. Perhaps the lack of sauce was the result of me being unable to find the pumpkin size recommended by the recipe and using a larger one. I will make this again-it might even become a tradition. Also soaking the stem is a good idea

I made this for Thanksgiving this year, and while I enjoyed it, I think the recipe is unnecessarily complicated. If you're at all astute at making a good strong vegetable stock, you can avoid some of the complex directions. The vegetable choices were perfect however, and it was a hit with the non- vegetarians as well!

Rating: 3
Made this for a dinner party and it was a hit! Would agree with other reviewers that you can make the sauce using the bits of the vegetables you've cut off, that you should double the amount of sauce you make, and that it was preferable to buy several small pumpkins, rather than a large one. (Side note; if you buy a pumpkin with a tall stem, cut it down or soak it. Somehow one of mine like this caught fire.)

The presentation for this dish was absolutely fabulous. However, I found the flavors lacking. Once the pumpkin was cooked through (it took much longer than indicated) it was very delicious, but the filling was a little too "celery" flavored. I also found the mushroom gravy didn't pair well with the flavors of the stuffing and the pumpkin.

Rating: 4
Make sure you use a small pumpkin (no larger than 8 lbs, tiny ones for each individual would be ideal)--I made the mistake of attempting to roast a large (leftover from Halloween!) pumpkin and it turned out disastrously. The pumpkin flesh was stringy and oily and I wound up roasting the vegetables separately in the wine sauce. It was tasty but insubstantial and not worth the 4+ hours. I added eggplant to the veggies, yum!

I loved this recipe. We have a great market here in Rochester and was able to find all of the ingredients easily including the pumpkin. I did add 2 tablespoons of soy sauce to the wine gravy. My family loved it.

Gorgeous presentation but I have to agree that the work involved doesn't warrant 4 forks...although it is good. I would definitely make it in stages rather than all in one day; 3 of us did that and worked most of the day! I added more flour to the butter for the roux; the recipe as printed didn't thicken the sauce enough. Takes about 1/2 cup flour.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe-- even though it wasn't complicated, it took a LONG time to make, and I wasn't sure it was worth it in the end. the broth was delicious, but i thought the vegetables were too big, and if i made it again i would use different veggies-- i still can't really get into parsnips. I also had problems finding a pumpkin, so i used 2 small pie pumpkins and it's true, the presentation was beautiful.

This dish, served to vegetarians and omnivores, was a highlight of Thanksgiving dinner. The amount of time indicated to make the dish is accurate. It is delicious! However the only glitch was the reduction took much longer than the 2 hours, although I am not very experienced with reductions.

My daughter & I made this recipe for Thanksgiving. She is vegan, I am not. This was delicious! We will make it every Thanksgiving. We substituted balsamic vinegar for the wine and Tempeh for the seitan. We also added roasted beets to the mix. I've always avoided vegetables, but this won me over! Great presentation in the pumpkin shell too!

Throwing away the veggies used to make the broth makes me feel wasteful. Instead, you can use the tops of carrots, the fronds from the other fennel, and ends of onions and other veggie odds and ends to make the broth. Save yourself some $$$.

This is a fabulous recipe and very pretty. Pumpkins can be a little hard to find around Thanksgiving so it is kind of a challenge. I also used more red wine to finish the sauce at the end, but maybe this was because I used a fairly light shiraz, and needed a little extra to brighten the sauce. I served it with an herb creme fraiche...a big hit!!!

Wow. It takes a while to prepare, but it's worth it. I made the sauce the night before, and that's the most time-consuming part. I added some baby eggplant and baby zucchini from the garden before the frost killed everything, and this recipe was enjoyed by all. The sauce really does make the recipe, so don't skip any of the steps or ingredients involved.
