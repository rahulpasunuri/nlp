We're not huge fans of Indian food (we like it occasionally) or mustard greens and this was wonderful. I needed a recipe to try mustard greens again (I was determined to like them) and this fit the bill perfectly! I used store bought naan to save time and reduced the ginger by half. I highly recommend even the skeptics try it!

Perfectly delicious. Buy some naan at the store if you want a short cut.

I created a shortcut to this recipe that worked nicely for me. Use the thick Greek pocketless pita/flatbread (Kontos is a good brand) - which you can use instead for anything that calls for pizza dough, really, and it comes right out of your refrigerator. Not quite the same results, but a shortcut to the basic idea. Instead of goatcheese, I happened to have fresh mozarella which seemed best to melt that on top of the flatbread first, with a little olive oil (since it doesn't dollop or spread quite like goat cheese). Let that cool a bit. Do the rest of the recipe as a sauteed topping - you could experiment with different greens - whatever you have onhand - I've done this with collards and swiss chard; though the mustard greens will add a particular zing to it. Maybe add the cilantro as a fresh topping to the sauteed could be nice. Interested to know if this works for anyone else...

I was a little skeptical about all that ginger, but OMG - this recipe is phenominal! I used store-bought Nan for crusts and sprinkled fresh cilantro over goat cheese before baking. Yum, yum - will make again and again. It's the sauce that's so special. Would be great over rice too I'm sure.

This was fantastic! I used one 28 oz can of Muir Glen Fire Roasted crushed toms and Feta cheese. Made the Pizza Dough (2007) recipe on epicurious. This would freeze well (the sauce). Will make again, hoping for more mustard greens from my CSA!

Overwhelmingly tomato-y and spicy, and the goat cheese didn't complement it well. I did not at all like it, though I love Indian food and everything that went into the pizza, my boyfriend thought it was ok, but not worth making again.

Terrific variation on pizza...if you don't like mustard greens, try rocket (arugula) or watercress - both add a nice, peppery bite. I've also skipped making the crust from scratch and bought pizza dough from Trader Joe's, with great success.

Excellent recipe. Quick and easy to make, and very nice for a change of pace.

I used ghee instead of vegetable oil and I topped the pizza out of the oven with fresh cilantro leftover from making the flatbreads. I think it tasted better the next day, so next time I make this I will prepare the tomato sauce and dough the day before.

I'm not sure if being Indian gives me more credibility on this dish, but my diverse group of guests and I all loved this dish. I've made it twice with good success, both times using flour tortillas in place of the flatbread (pure laziness).

Very different and very good.

Great way to use mustard greens! I doubled the mustard greens (which my husband wasn't crazy about but I loved) and used store-bought tandori naan bread. I also prebaked the bread directly on the oven rack so it became nice and crispy. Next time I have mustard greens on hand I will make this again!

This was FANTASTIC! I used a store-bought bag of dough from Trader Joe's to save time, but will definitely try the flatbread crust next time. The sauce was really amazing, and would also be good served with grilled lamb and basmati rice, I think.

Great, great great! Would definately make again. Lovely flavors. We've been to the restaurant Tabla in New York and so were very anxious to try a recipe from there. This would make great mini pizza appetizers for a dinner party too.

Loved the topping. Used store bought pizza crust for simplification. Will definitely make again!!!
