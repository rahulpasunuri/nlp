I hate sloppy, damp, mushy stuffing but love all of the flavors. These muffins are perfect since they eliminate the parts of stuffing that i find objectionable. My family requests them every year.

Delicious. I did not find it over salty or dry at all. I used fresh cornbread and low-sodium broth, as well as unsalted butter.

This stuffing turned out over seasoned and rather dry. I would definitely cut back on some of the seasoning, add more moisture to the mix, and cut back on the cooking time.

These are great. I made them for Thanksgiving and my husband has requested a double recipe for Christmas (more leftovers). I made them first thing in the morning and then reheated them before dinner - they were still great. This recipe will be a family tradition.

I followed the recipe exactly but we didn't like them - I think I will stick with the New Basics regular stuffing recipe...

I didn't really like them. Had them as part of the overall Country Thanksgiving menu from the Nov. issue. I missed regular stuffing and judging by how many were leftover, so did the rest of the people we had over. I would not make these again.

Delicious! I used Mrs Cubbisons Cornbread Stuffing and wheat bread cubes. Added chopped zucchini and red pepper for color. Very moist and flavorful. A big hit with all! A definite keeper of a recipe.

Had them last night with Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved them. They are pretty easy to make, though a lot of steps, and they come out looking so cute! I used cornbread from a mix I bought at the grocery store, and it worked great.

I felt like this was very salty, but it was the first thing gone on the table. I added blanched poblanos, and I thought it gave it a nice heat.

Made 24 muffins for an office potluck-- they were a big hit. Used greased muffin cups for tidiness. Also, the cornbread took a while to set up. The first batch I cooked wasn't done in the middle. Make sure it feels firm when you tap it.
