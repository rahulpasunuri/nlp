Not to get off topic, but what an obnoxious comment by "A Cook." Way to bring classist jerkiness into the culinary discussion. The recipe doesn't call for "best quality $100 balsamic," it calls for "balsamic vinegar." Comments like the below are why I hate food magazines.

"I only used an eighth of the amount called for, but I can't understand why it didn't come out well". DUH And GOOD balsamic costs well over 100 dollars, not 50, you bought the cheapest tradizionale, not the great one.

Excellent recipe. I fried the chicken livers in butter and Dijon mustard and the balance of flavours was superb.

This sounded so wonderful on paper but I found it to be very bland. I also question the use of 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar! I have a little bottle of real balsamic, purchased in Modena, Italy and costing $50. A tiny amount goes a long way and 2 Tablespoons would be 1/4 of my bottle. Perhaps the recipe refers to the cheaper imitation stuff and maybe that's where I went wrong as I only added about a half teaspoon of my 'liquid gold'. This was also a labor intensive recipe for such a disappointing outcome.
