I love this squash recipe; however, I did not need to add Chicken broth. The squash was moist enough that it was not needed. I put garlic cloves in the oven with the squash when it was cooking, then added the inside flesh to the butter. It is yummy......

This is a very good dish. I used one medium sized kabocha and one medium sized butternut. Thankfully, I read the reviews first and noted that others used less broth. I ended up using no broth and thought just the butter was sufficient moisture. I'll try this again with just low fat broth since that can be a lower fat and lower cholesterol option.

This is a great dish. I use butternut squash, as it is easy to find. I usually make this in a large batch for family and tone down the garlic and butter a bit. I also use only a quarter to a half of the amount of broth in the recipe.

The quality of the squash is key. But with the right fresh ingrediants you will have a dish that folks cannot stop eating. Whenever I make this people go back for a second helping.

I made this recipe to bring to a friend's Thanksgiving dinner and no one liked it. I didn't pay attention to the comments about not adding all of the chicken broth, and it was completely soupy and unappetizing. Also, did not like the thyme with the squash. Won't make it again.

I was able to find the kabocha squash and per an earlier review I did not cut it in half, but baked it whole for 1 hour. I also poked holes in it and baked it in water. This worked great. The only thing I changed was not adding the full 1 cup of chicken stock. I used 1/2 cup and that was plenty. Even then the squash was a little bit runny. Next time I might just eliminate the chicken stock altogether. My husband taste tested it and added some maple syrup. This blended all the ingredients together for a nice mellow sweet flavor.

I love kabocha squash and this recipe treated it very well. I poked holes in the whole squash, which is much easier at this point than hacking it in two. I then put it in a pan with water and baked it on 400 for 45 minutes though an hour would have worked better for my squash. THEN cut it in half easily and scoop out seeds then the flesh. Very good.

It took me awhile but I managed to find kabocha squash, tossed in a bin with all sorts of decorative and eating types, at this time of year. They look fairly identical to another (butterCUP) and probably taste the same. I wouldn't hesitate to substitute acorn, buttercup, or even butternut given the difficulties in obtaining kabocha. What made this recipe different from other basic squash purees is the addition of garlic and thyme. Light and lovely.

I received this type of squash from a produce delivery that I subscribe to (www.urbanorganic.com) for those of you that could not find the squash. Recipe is great and full of flavor just be careful and add the chicken broth slowly as the squash might get too liquidy.

Was unable to find Kabocha Squash in three supermarkets. Who know something so delicious could be so healthy? I used acorn squash instead.

I used a buttercup squash, which turned out OK but came up short of 6 servings.
