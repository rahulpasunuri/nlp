Someone mentioned roasting the pumpkin first, and that sounded like a great way to increase the flavor, so I tried that. I split it in half cdrosswise and used the method described on SimpleBites.net at http://www.simplebites.net/roasting-pumpkin-101-how-to-make-your-own-pumpkin-pure/, except I did it at 400 degrees with a big of water, as one commenter there recommended. I loved the results. I did still simmer the coup for about 20 minutes, to make certain the pumpkin was very soft before blending the soup with an immersion blender.

I made this with butternut squash instead of pumpkin but otherwise did exactly what the recipe said. I swirled about a tablespoon of sour cream into each bowl before serving. The cloves give a subtle spice flavour. I'll make this again.

good soup but improved it by adding 3 tbs maple soup and garam masala (indian spice). Cream was fine but better and healthier with plain yogurt

This recipe is pretty good but not great. Use less cream--1/2 cup dulls the flavors--and add five, not six, cups of stock for a heartier soup. Mine was slightly thin. Also could use a bit of wine or beer--choose your own "punch," and adds lots of salt. Overall, it's a good base recipe for basic pumpkin soup, but I've made many other pumpkin soups I prefer more.

Wonderful simplicity in this soup. Made it as directed but without measuring, came out great! A fine way to use leftover pumpkin (from fresh, not can). I wouldn't add anything to it. The creaminess laced with the clove and honey flavor is delightful.

To the cook from Charleston "found the flavor bland and the texture quite grainy". HELLO, what parallel universe are you living in? This soup is simply sensational as is....I added Canadian Maple Syrup instead of Honey....really exceptional soup. Thank you Epicurious.....

Great soup, esp. if you want the vitamins of squash but are not crazy about squash soups. This is very lite and subtle. Did not use cloves and used veg. stock. Even kids ate. Used a little more honey than directed. Defin. a keeper for someone who cooks lots and only saves exceptional new recipes.

Just made this soup for lunch today. I used one of the small pumpkin pie pumpkins and it turned out fabulous!! I love it, and I'm sure my husband will too. I can't imagine using canned pumpkin for this! There really is no substitute for fresh. Once you've had fresh, you will never go back to canned (except for pies maybe). I only blended about 3/4 of it and left the rest chunky so there would be a little more texture to it, and I also added just a tiny bit of fresh ginger (I wanted the cloves to be the predominate spice flavor) but I think the ginger gave it just enough mystery. I think maybe a lot depends on the quality of the chicken stock used. I am partial to Trader Joe's liquid concentrate in the little packets because it is nice and savory and used half that and half organic chicken base to make my stock. I'm sure this would be even better the next day, but I don't think there will be any left!

interesting that the most complaints come from people who used canned pumpkin. Not really an acceptable substitute - especially if you are going to critique the recipe. I also don't understand why so many people wanted to spice it up so much. If I wanted a spicey soup I would have made a curried or southwestern style recipe. It was fine as written maybe a touch more salt. Not everything we eat has to assault our pallet. This was subtle & smooth. maybe those who used canned pumpkin could try again, there really is no comparison. I served it at a dinner for 8 and not a single drop was left in anyone's bowl. I will certainly make it again. griff in ny.

I live in Florence, Italy part-time, and made this for a very discriminating group of friends (who are all excellent cooks) for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved the soup. I added a little cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar and cayenne as suggested by others. I also did not add cream, but just drizzled it on top of each serving. There were raves all around. You cannot get canned pumpkin in Italy, so I used fresh, but will make it for Christmas with canned.

This was an excellent recipe, but in hindsight and at the advise of a friend, I think I will use the mini, sweet, pumpkins to see how that comes out. As usual, it was better the next day. I added some white pepper for a kick 'coz I like it a little spicy. Another excellent (if not one of my favorite) autumn soups is the sweet potato soup with chopped pecans http://www.epicurious.co m/recipes/food/views/SW EET-POTATO-SOUP- WITH-BUTTERED- PECANS-13324

We don't have a hand mixer or blender, so I used an electric beater to mix the veggies after they'd cooked. I liked the end result: some of the carrotts were still chunky, I like that better than puré soup. Was delicious, would definitely make it again!

my favorite pumpkin soup! Personally, I like to acutally taste the pumpkin, not just the seasonings, so I see no need to add anything.

This recipe was fairly bland compared to other roasted squash soups I've made. Perhaps I used pumpkins that weren't ripe enough...?

where's the flavor??? I added brown sugar, seasoned salt, nutmeg and allspice to give this drab soup an Autumnal 'kick'. More fat doesn't hurt, either, and since I'd used milk instead of cream (maybe one of the missteps), I had to compensate by adding a little more butter too. I'd rather try an entirely different recipe next time!

I make this year after year. I use a "Sugar Pumpkin" usually reserved for pies, always excellent and I find the amount of honey can be reduced for that desired sweetness to remain. A favorite of fall (even in California). Bon Appetit!

Don't understand "the negatives" on this recipe. I've made this soup many times. It's wonderful.As in one review already, I too, just put the whole pumpkin in oven and roasted until ready.It improves the flavor as with squash.I did increase the whole cloves to 7 or 8, otherwise kept to recipe. I thinned as needed with extra diluted stock and I have to tell everyone, I've actually frozen the leftover prepared soup each time I've made it. Believe it or not, it freezes beautifully. Just thaw out gently in micro and reheat gently when needed. It didn't separate. This is one of our favorite soups for the fall.

I've been making this recipe for many years and I always get rave reviews. I do vary the recipe a bit. I use canned pumpkin, instead of fresh. Also, I use 4 cups plain pumpkin and 2 cups pumpkin pie mix. The added spices give it a great flavor.

I made this recipe with fresh pumpkin from the garden and it was delicious. I gave a few samples to friends and the results were the same. An incredible, but seasonal recipe. I tried it again with frozen pumpkin and was disappointed with the texture. Wait until fall and do it fresh flesh and you will not impressed.

This is a good recipe with modifications. I added extra honey, and swirled in some amaretto at the very end.

I made this soup last night as a starter for a bunch of British people (generally not fond of eating pumpkin)and almost everyone had a second bowl. It's a pretty simple recipe (once you chop up the pumpkin). I added 2 bay leaves (when it was simmering and then took them out before liquidising) and also quite a bit more honey and some salt to taste.

Rating: 2
Somewhat disappointed with the results given the glowing reviews everyone else the recipe. I found that using 6 cups of stock left the consistency a bit too thick, and even after adding more liquid, I had to throw in an extra boullion cube to add more depth of flavor. The soup isn't bad, but I've had much tastier results using different pumpkin recipes.

Rating: 3
In the Dutch oven I sauteed until soft 2 chopped onions, 2 pears & 1 apple peeled & chopped. I ommitted the celery & carrots. Once I added the pumpkin (a can of pumpkin speeds things up a bit)I seasoned it with thyme, marjoram, salt and bottled hot sauce (scotch bonnet). I ommitted the honey (the fruit gives it a much nicer sweetness). After it is pureed in a blender or food processor I stirred in the cream or milk & heated it gently before serving. Even more delicious if made a day ahead!

Sounds better than it is. I can't think of any other word to describe this except "gross". I really wanted to like, it, too! I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and no one liked it. In fact, we just threw it out. I guess we like our pumpkin in pies and cakes and cookies, but not with chicken stock and carrots, celery, and onions. Even the honey and cream didn't fix it. Too bad!

We did not enjoy this soup at all. I even tried "fixing" it a little after the initial taste was disappointing. I added some cayenne for a little zip, added more honey, added more chicken broth to thin it a little--it just wasn't very good. We much preferred the Southwest Pumpkin soup recipe also on this site.

The first time I made this soup, I used a vegetable broth and canned pumpkin. It turned out slightly thicker than I'd anticipated, so the second time, I added milk (in addition to the cream), more broth, and sauteed cubes of sweet potato in the same way that the recipe called for adding the pumpkin. Instead of adding honey directly to the pot, I recommend adding some to each bowl (drizzled on top) with nutmeg as a garnish.

Because I believe soup recipes should be easy (that's the whole point of soup!), I used canned pumpkin (2 cans) and 1/4 teaspoon of minced cloves instead of whole cloves (that way you don't have to fish them out later). I agree with everyone that you are going to have to add salt. I didn't have honey, so I used brown sugar instead. Next time I make it, I add other spices as suggested by the other reviewers.

I served this soup as a second course for Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone loved and raved about it, they were asking for more then just the small second course portion that I served them!!

This is the best pumpkin soup I've ever had. Didn't want to waste my time trying to peel a pumpkin so I threw it in the oven and roasted it. The house smelled terrific and peeling was not an issue. I used a few more cloves and ground them up fresh so I didn't have to remove, and also added some nutmeg. If you find the consistency a little rough after pureeing, try adding a little cream to the pot...it'll smooth it right out for you. Try topping with a few homemade croutons.

Excellent appetizer with fresh homemade bread.Very creamy and smooth although it had a little bit of a granular consistancy thatI wish wasn't there(maybe it's my poor cooking) but overall I loved the soup. We had it for a small dinner party and everyone loved it. 10/29/00

This soup was great! I substituted fresh acorn squash for the pumkin, though. I don't know how they expect people to PEEL and cut a small pumpkin! I tried, and it didn't work. Also, I like my veggies well cooked, so I let it simmer an extra 15 min before pureeing it. It tasted thick and creamy, and it pleased everyone at my dinner party! It's a very good autumnal tummy warmer.

Wonderful. I use canned pumpkin often and it works fine - quite a bit faster. Just use a little less than the quantity of chunks of pumpkin and add it to the pureed vegetables. This recipe is quite flexible: you can use however carrots, etc. you have and just adjust the seasonings and it's still delicious.

I have to admit that I was a little underwhelmed with this recipe. I was expecting something with more flavor. After I finished preparing the soup, I added some cinnamon and nutmeg along with quite a bit of freshly grated ginger (about 1 inch) and I think that really picked up the flavor.

Mine came out delicious. I have a feeling it might even be a 'beyond compare' recipe depending on the quality of the pumpkin--you just never know how ripe or fresh a fruit or a vegetable is until it is prepared. Plus, I didn't use real cream;I used soy milk to make it a healthy recipe.

This was fantastic. It halves well. I did not use low salt chicken broth when I made mine and it turned out very tasty. I also used pureed pumpkin as I always buy a pumpkin every fall and roast it to make pumpkin puree for cooking during the year. I didn't bother to puree the carrots, celery and onion because I like some texture in my food. Everyone I have served this has liked it a lot and has asked for the recipe.

A very hearty soup. I make this 4 or 5 times during Oct. & Nov. Needs quite bit of salt 1T if I had to guess, 1t of nutmeg, 1t of cinnamon. The sour cream does set it off right, don't skip! This will easily feed 20! Reheats well.
