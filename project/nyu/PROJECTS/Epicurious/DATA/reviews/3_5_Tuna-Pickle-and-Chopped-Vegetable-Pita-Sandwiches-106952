This was an easy and tasty recipe. Will definitely make again. Cutting the pitas into quarters would make a great appetizer! The reason for only 3 forks was due to the fact that I doubled the recipe (to have leftovers the next day for lunch) and it filled only 2-3 pitas! Bummer...

Just a question, has this recipe recently changed because so many people used relish, rather then the chopped sweet pickle the recipe calls for (that would be gherkins, perhaps bread & butter, that kind of thing)?

As written, I thought this tuna salad recipe was kind of strange. The combination of the sweet relish and the apples makes it far too sweet, and the yogurt just tasted very odd with the other ingredients. It wasn't bad, and it was very easy, but I just didn't like or understand the flavor combinations.

Yum! I added a little Dijon mustard to the yogurt and mayonnaise mix and used red onion and bread-and-butter pickle chips, cut into pieces. My boyfriend thought the ingredients were all very well balanced. I put it on rustic bread for dinner and served the leftovers for lunch the next day in a multigrain pita. Would love to try it with some thick flatbread.

I agree with the reviewer about the pitas. It is hard to find good pitas at the big supermarkets. Otherwise I really liked the recipe. I didn't have sweet relish so I used dill relish instead. Still very tasty.

This was an okay recipe. I really loved the actual tuna salad, with the pickles, red pepper and apples. The crunch and different flavors were excellent. However, I thought the vinegar dressed extra veggies/apples were a bit unnecessary. Sure, a bit more substantial, but it just adds more of the same flavors along with a lot of vinegar (even after I cut it in half!). Also, the pitas (probably just mine...I never have any luck with them:) fell apart. I will make this recipe again, but next time, I will forgo the vinegar on the extra veggies/apples and probably use a wrap/tortilla to hold the sandwich together. That said, the salad plain is delicious, too!

This was really good. I did add an extra can of tuna because it seemed a little soupy for my taste, and I couldn't imagine 1 can being enough for four whole pita breads. Because I added the extra tuna, I also dou ble the pickles. Other than that I made no changes and would definitely make again.

Great on a tortilla! I love the tang added by the pickles.

This was not my favorite tuna salad. I doubled the recipe, used less yogurt & mayo, used red onion & too sweet an apple. I ate with whole grain crackers for lunches, but just felt it was too sweet. I might try again using a tart apple, as the recipe called for. Looks great though, everyone at work wanted to know what I was eating.

If I hadn't goofed up this recipe so badly, I probably would give it 4 forks. (First, I squeezed all the juice out of sweet pickle relish until it measured 1/2 cup, and then I accidentally mixed the chopped apple with the tuna mixture instead of the bell pepper mixture.) When I realized my error, I just mixed all the filling ingredients (except the lettuce) together. The resulting filling was too sweet, and tasted too much of pickle relish. To try to combat the sweetness I added both extra yogurt and a chopped, hard-boiled egg. This didn't help much. Next time I would use 1/3 cup relish (prior to squeezing) and cut the apple cider vinegar to 1 tsp.--one can always add more!!!

Really enjoyed this but next time I'll cut the amount of sweet pickle in 1/2. It overwhelmed the rest of the flavors.

I was skeptical at first to try this, but I read the reviews and had to give it a whirl! I cant believe it, I followed the recipe to the tee, and it was amazing! I've aquired a new taste for fish!@ Loved it, you simply must try this one!

4 Forks on a sandwich scale. Made as written. Used whole wheat pita bread and prepared sweet relish. I've made it several times now. Makes a low fat tasty summer lunch.

I made this using brown bread rather than pitas and it was fantastic. You can mix the apple mixture with the tuna and it is delicious, even stored in the fridge and used in a fresh sandwich the next day.

Absolutely delicious. So fresh, crisp and cool on a hot summer day. Great in pita pockets and on its own. The apple was such a nice surprise. Easy to make. A keeper.

I enjoyed this recipe when I made it minus the pickles and apples.
