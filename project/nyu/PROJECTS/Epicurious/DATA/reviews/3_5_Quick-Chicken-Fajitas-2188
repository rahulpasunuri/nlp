I used this recipe as a starting place to make up my own. I like bell peppers, so I added 5 (one red, one yellow, one orange, and two green) instead of 1. I also used about 2 lbs of boneless skinless chicken thighs (probably about double the amount of meat the recipe calls for) since breast meat tends to dry out in fajitas. I thought the spice proportions seemed off for the amount of vegetables and chicken (even without my modifications) -- I ended up using 3t of smoked paprika, 3t of pasilla chile powder (more chile flavor, less heat; you could also use ancho chile powder); 3t of whole cumin seeds (didn't have any ground cumin), 2t dried oregano, 1/2t of turmeric for color, and 1t garlic salt with additional salt to taste. Came out fantastic!

Used portobellos instead of bell peppers and improvised a little at the end. Needed more garlic, so I let it simmer with 3 smashed cloves--delicious.

This has been our go-to fajita recipe for a few years now. I make it about once a month. My picky husband loves them. I followed some reviewers suggestions: double all the seasoning (except cayenne), omit chicken broth, use fresh garlic instead of powder, add 1/4 t cinnamon and 1/4 t chili powder.

This was very good, but kind of spicy for me (but I admit, I'm a heat wuss). Next time I'll double up on the garlic and thyme and cut back on the cayenne. I didn't use chicken broth either.

This was a great receipe. I put all the spices and marianaded the chicken breasts for a couple of hrs, and i added extra paprika and cayenne pepper coz I like things hot. Turned out great with the tortillas. Quick and easy dinner indeed!

I prepared this and substituted 1/4 cup lime juice for the chicken broth. The seasonings were delicious. I mixed the lime juice, chicken strips and seasonings together and let them rest while I sauteed the peppers and onions. I removed the peppers and onions to a dish while I sauteed the chicken breast strips. After the chicken was mostly done I put the pepper and onions back in for the final 2 minutes.

Rating: 3
I've experimented with the recipe and here's how I like it best. I cooked the onions and peppers alone and then put them to the side. Then I added the chicken (using 2 servings cut into strips) into the same pan and sprinkled with the amount of seasoning listed in this recipe. I also added salt and omitted the broth. Then I squirted some lemon juice on it.

Simply not enough flavor here. Sure it is fine once you load on the calories with the sour cream, avocado, tortillas and salsa. But the chicken itself had no flavor. I guess I should have listened to the other reviewers instructions to double the seasoning.

When I make this again, I will put the spice in the cooking oil, flash fry the veg. on high heat untill slightly crispy, cook the chicken separatly in the broth and then mix the two to serve. I might mix some frozen corn in to give it some authentic mexican flavor.

A fast, easy week-night go-to. I use fresh, uncooked tortillas, which makes a huge difference. Also, I increase the spices, grind whole w/a mortar & pestle if I have time, and add a pinch of chipotle. It's regular at our house when schedules demand a quick dinner.

Rating: 3
A great, quick week-night meal. I always use the fresh, uncooked tortillas from the refridgerated section, which makes a huge difference. Just cook them on a grill or skillet while the fajitas cook. I usually use whole spices and grind them with a mortar & pestle; if I don't have time for that then I just double the spices and it's fine. I also add a pinch of chipotle powder, and a few squeezes of fresh lime. Not bad at all for a quick meal.

this is a great way to take advantage of leftover cooked chicken or using a store cooked rotisserie chicken, especially the lemon pepper seasoned. agree with using more spices but the presented amoutn is great for little ones who are still worshipping the ketchup god. i always add traditional sides, including fideo and blanco maiz sauted w/ onions. yum

I actually mix up these spices in copious amounts and keep it in my spice cabinet which makes fajita night that much easier, since I usually grind my own spices. I also add a bit of cocoa & cinnamon to the mix. Adding a bit more total flavor, I use about a tablespoon of the mix each time I cook this. Pass on the chicken broth, but I do use the juice of a lime about a minute before pulling it off the stove. Always a hit with the family.. we have these at least twice a month.

There must be something better out there!

I altered the recipe a bit but this is delice!!! I use olive oil in place of veg oil. I sautee red and yellow bell peppers and when cooking the onion I also use fresh garlic. I double the spices, 86 the chicken broth (I've never seen that here in Bruxelles anyway and it's always too salty.) and use the juice of one lime. Half squeezed in with the veggies and the other half when I add the chicken. Instead of sour creme I use fromage frais demi- grais which is fresh cheese lowfat. It kind of tastes like plain yogurt. We like it and it's healthier! C'est bon!!!

I've made these fajitas often and I too add cinnamon with the other spices. I also grill the chicken rather than throwing it in the broth. I'm surprised that the toppings don't include grated cheese and because it's not listed I often forget to buy it!

This is an all-time favorite at my house. The original recipe is so tattered from use, so I was glad to find it at this site. I make up the dry ingredients in a large quantity and keep it with my spices ready to use, that's how often I use the recipe.

i added cinnamon. the cinnamon is the kicker. i worked for two years in a kitchen with all mexicans, and they put cinnamon in EVERYTHING. try it, you'll like it. also, as with anything else, taste it before you go serving it, cause you may want more spiciness.

This recipe is great for weekday dinners - it took about 20 minutes to make. I used extra bell peppers and used more of the spices to give it an extra kick. With spanish rice and beans of your choice, you have a good meal. My fiancee loves these fajitas and begs me to make them once a week!

Not 4 forks but definitely a recipe worth making. I used pre-cooked chicken breast and the recipe worked great and saved time. Nice combination of spices.

This was excellent!! I ended up cutting out the avocado, don't much care for them, & the salsa. To kick up the recipe a notch, I added chipotle chili powder & crushed red chiles to the dry rub, then marinated the chix overnite in the frig. What a heavenly flavor. Definitely worth the effort & sooo much better tasting than the packet fajita variety. Upon assembly I also added a bit of monteray pepper jack cheese & sour cream. Yummy!! Will make again & again!!

this was a great easy recipe to make on the spot. i read the other reviews before i made it, then decided to add some white pepper to spice it up a little...perfect! hot but not overbearing. we did change the recipe a little by first grilling the chicken on the forman grill, then adding it to the vegies. we also added some black beans and rice...yummy!

I liked the simplicity of this recipe but thought it could be more flavorful - needs more spice and more heat. I will try it again and instead of adding the spices as directed will make a dry rub and rub it on the chicken before cooking.

Very delicious. I substituted turkey strips for chicken breast, because I had some in the freezer. I thickened it slightly with a little cornstarch and cold water just before serving.

While this recipe was indeed quick, I found it a little bland. Definitely needs more spices, doubling them may not even be enough. Using red, green and yellow peppers makes it more colorful. Marinating the chicken before cooking might help, too.

I thought the blend of spices were good, except next time I will add a little salt to enhance the flavor. I also doubled the amount of spices. To avoid having the chicken tuning tough & rough ( as one person experienced - which was a result of cooking the chicken in the liquid) I made an extra batch of spices, heated some oil, added the extra spice to the oil, than sauted the chicken in that. I removed the chicken from the pan and then proceeded with the recipe. I Added the chicken back into the sauted onions,red pepper and chicken broth and let cook for about 3 mins. Instead of bottled salsa, I maded my own. Delicious. This recipe has been put on my favorite quick and easy list.

I have never made fajitas before so I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. It's fairly simple to make and tasty. I substitued a half cup of water and soy sauce for the chicken stock because I didn't have any on hand and doubled the spices. In the end, I don't think you need to double the spices (or have any spices at all) unless you like fajitas that way. One suggestion though, cut the chicken so the pieces are small. Also, the chicken was a little rough and tough to chew.

Rating: 3
This was very good. I altered it a bit for the grill. I doubled the spices, whipped them into olive oil and the chicken broth. Poured over sliced chicken breast and let marinate overnight. Cooked the green peppers, onions and chicken breast strips on the grill the next night. I let my guests build their own and offered sour cream, guacamole, and salsa as toppers in addition to the peppers & onions. Served spanish rice and refried beans on the side. You know its a hit when you guests say, 'Oh my gosh, this is sooooooo good!'

We made this for dinner last night. The combination of spices was just right (although I might double the amount next time). It didn't have that artificial taste that the fajita mixes have. I did substitute lime juice for the chicken broth which gave the onions an intense lime taste. It is a great recipe when you don't have time to marinade.

After reading the reviews, I sliced the onions and peppers (I used red & yellow) on the thicker side to keep them from getting soggy.

I agree with what others have said about this recipe: that the chicken in bland. I've made this several times now and it's turned out great, but I marinade the chicken all afternoon in these ingredients: the juice of one lime, 1/2c. olive oil, and all of the spices listed in the original recipe (I leave out the broth). I whip it all up with my stick blender and pour it over the chicken. This helps a lot! My kids adore this recipe and they hate pretty much everything.

After making this a couple of times, I have pre-mixed the spices to have on hand. Of course, I added a couple extra chili spices like Ancho and Arbol. I also add a lot more peppers. I think that there is too much chicken for the small amount of vegetables given here. I usually use 1 each of red, yellow, and green peppers with a large onion. I too marinate the chicken in the lime marinade from the pepper fajita recipie also found here. Gives the chicken just a little kick. If you have an indoor grill, I *highly* recommend grilling the chicken before mixing it in with the peppers and onions. Adds a little bit of time, but totally worth it.

Good fajitas.. Only thing I change (and ALWAYS do this), is because the chicken breast is soooo dry, I marinate it up, and 'cue it WHOLE, to retain the juices. Let it sit for a few minutes, slice across the grain, and add it to the onions and peppers.. Keeps it from drying out, as it always wants to do..

This worked great. My first actual fajitas made at home. Onions and peppers were perfect. I didn't have any chicken broth, so I just used water instead. The water with everything else kept the chicken tender and made its own broth with the rest of the seasonings. Extra cayenne keeps it spicy!

Rating: 1
VERY DISAPPOINTING! 1. The onions and the peppers cooked too long. The onions practically disintegrated. The peppers were limp, lifeless and lacked flavor. 2. The recipe called for too much chicken broth. Was I making chicken fajitas or chicken stew! If I decide to make this dish again, I will add the spices to 1/4 cup of chicken broth, add the chicken and cook the peppers and onions (in a separate pan) in olive oil for about 5 minutes and then add the chicken to the same pan and sautee the chicken to lightly brown the outside. Maybe this recipe can be salvaged?

Rating: 3
This probably deserves 3 1/2 forks, it was great! I doubled the amount of spices (except cayenne) for 2 chicken breasts, and added maybe 2 tsp. lime juice at the end. Decreased chicken broth to 1/4 cup since I found it had too much liquid at the end and reducing it by cooking longer made the bell peppers mushy. I also skipped the tomato, avacado and (purchased??) salsa topping. Goes great with some sour cream, but is incredibly flavorful and moist all on its own. Leftovers keep fairly well. Would most definitely make again!

Rating: 4
This recipe is quick and easy to make--great for a weeknight. The only change I made was to increase the cayanne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon since my boyfriend likes spicy food. Using 1/2 can of broth is a good idea. It really does keep the chicken moist. I will definitely make this again soon!
