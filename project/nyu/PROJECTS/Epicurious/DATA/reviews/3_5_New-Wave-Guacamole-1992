I really like the presentation idea in the introduction to the recipe - the green of the guacamole looked very nice against the reddish-purple of the cabbage leaf. I did not particularly enjoy the flavour of the recipe though. Nor, did it seem, did anyone who tried it.

I liked the idea of this recipe, but the amounts of ginger and lime juice overpowered the avocado. What a disappointment and waste of good avocados.

I made this for a party, doubling the recipe, and it was gone in an hour. A quality recipe.

This was a great change from wonderful, typical guac. My husband doesn't like cucumbers so I diced and added a can of water chestnuts and they were really wonderful.

Making this recipe for my birthday party was one of the greatest ideas i've ever had!!! Everyone loved it, and the ginger gives it a kind of mysterious flavor that no one could quite guess what it was. I served it with tortilla chips and mexican flautas and it was a huge success. I also used it in my poblano chilies recipe and it was delicious. It's a must have recipe for all occasions.

I was surprised how good this was. I love normal guacamole but I was serving a pan asian meal and wanted something different. I didn't have cucumber so I used tomato instead but followed the rest to the letter. Everyone thought it was great.

Delicious! I made this to start off a recent Indian Feast. It was terrific with veggies and pappadam and a hit as a 'chutney' with the chicken biryani.

Guests loved the way this smelled (curry in avocado?) and tasted. Though I know classic guacamole needs no revisions, this is a standout and hghly recommended

This was a huge hit at my last party. I wouldn't change the recipe at all, but I am still partial to regular guacamole.

I made the dip and served it with tortilla chips for a mexican luncheon. The dip was a great hit. An excellent variation of a classic.
