Yes, this has a lot of (easy) steps, but it is so worth it. What a flavorful, interesting and healthy salad! I ate leftovers (without the lettuce) for 2 days afterward and they were even better the 2nd day. If you have a little time, it's well worth the effort.

Made this dish last night for our weekly dinner party! It was a sensation! Followed most everything to a tee, except made my own pesto from all the excess basil I had. It is the best dish to make for hot summer evenings. Paired with a white wine from Rioja, this was something I'll make many more times.

I loved this and my guests did as well, especially the pickle! There are a lot of steps, but the recipe is laid out in a way that makes it actually pretty easy and most of it can be done a day ahead and kept in the fridge. It looks beautiful on a platter and was so worth it!

Just say NO and step away from this recipe!! I love cooking involved recipes but this one is ridiculous. I've never posted a negative review but just read what everyone else who didn't like this recipe said and I agree completely. I started at 4pm and we ate at 7 two water baths later and the kitchen looked like I'd made Thanksgiving dinner and the flavors were so so - it tastes better when you mix everything together but loses the visual appeal. One takeaway - I used my ridged grill pan for the mushrooms and they were great so I'll be doing that again. Oh and my husband was munching on the different salads for a few days acting appreciative so that was a plus.

Will not make this again. It was SO labor intensive without much to show for itself once it was on the plate. My dinner party guests didn't go back for more of anything, and I don't blame them.

I liked this recipe a lot. I'm not giving it 4 forks because it's a little confusing and time consuming. But if you look at it as making several salads that you can eat all week, it's not so bad. Here are the modifications I made: I used 1/2 cup olive oil instead of 3/4 in the vinaigrette. I used frozen grilled chicken breast (tyson) and added pesto. I only used cremini mushrooms What I would do next time: Make the chickpea salad ahead of time because it tastes better the next day. Forget the green beans. Add the cucumber with the tomato salad. Forget the radish-cucumber salad (too much extra work and I wasn't a fan). Mine was overcooked and bland. Make extra chicken and have it over fettucini the next day with a side of one of the salads by themselves. I stored mine in separate containers in the fridge and now have a healthy snack. This was even better because I got a lot of the ingredients from my garden or the farmer's market. Delicious!

This was so delicious! Very time consuming and the ingredient list left out the almonds and the green beans, but still, excellent one dish meal for the summer.

I was completely underwhelmed by this recipe. It looked so good on paper, but was just blah. And the cucumber/radish pickles were insanely salty, I would cut the salt by about half if I made it again (which I doubt). It is OK but not worth all the trouble.

3.5 Forks. Delicious, interesting, refreshing. The radish-cucumber salad is particularly delightful and would be good with all kinds of dishes. The herbs and seasonings are subtle but distinctive. I might use a little more of each. If I make it again, I will use all the do- ahead suggestions so I can serve the dish from a clean kitchen in a timely fashion. This would also be a good dish for collaboration among several cooks.

Made this last night for dinner. It was time consuming but well worth it. We might want to do it the next time for a summer brunch.

Delicious salad - loved all the fresh herbs and especially the mushrooms! Next time I will use chicken breast instead of thighs - just my personal preference. We skipped the lettuce because I ran out of prep space after putting together the other parts of the recipe, and couldn't fit everything on my platter, anyway. We were satisfied with the salad - minus the lettuce. Just had leftovers for lunch! Don't shy away from the radishes, the pickling process really mellows them out, and the cucumber/radish combo looks pretty! I will make this again, maybe for a party, and will make parts of it in advance. Labor intensive, but worth the effort!

Excellent, just threw it all in a bowl and served it over salad. A good summer meal.

Very good but a little time consuming for a salad.

I almost never give 4 forks, but this salad was amazing! It was A LOT of work and took a long time with many steps, but thank goodness it was worth it. I think next time I won't worry about the presentation and will make it all in 1 bowl and avoid all of the separate bowls of ingredients. The recipe neglects to list the green beans and almonds, but I just guessed as to amount and it was fine.

This was delicious. I think there are parts that could be omitted (for example, if you detest radishes, like I do, you leave that part out), and it would still would be good. It makes a TON of food. I had the green beans and chickpeas left over and ate it for lunch the following day. It was even more delicious on day 2.
