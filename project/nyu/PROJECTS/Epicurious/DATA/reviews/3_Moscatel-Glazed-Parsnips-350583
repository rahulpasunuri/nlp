I love this recipe. I never core the parsnips and use red wine vinegar (for most things I prefer balsamic, but red wine vinegar is better for this).

I LOVE parsnips and knew I'd add this to the usual parsnip recipe lineup upon first taste. Not only does it taste lovely, it has a gorgeous color.

This was good, but nothing spectacular. I had lots of parsnips that needed to be used and liked the simplicity of this recipe. It was very easy and quick. Be sure to cut away the cores or you'll end up with a very chewy mouthful. I used balsamic vinegar and as I was cooking thought it smelled way too powerful; in the end it had surprisingly toned itself down.

I used port instead of vinegar and it came out perfect. My wife had never had parsnips before and she loved them.

Sweet and succulent, with a hint of spice from the vinegar and a wonderful earthy flavor. Braising the parsnips in this way really brings out their natural carroty sweetness while creating a firm but melting tenderness, like a roasted sweet potato. (Note: used white balsamic vinegar instead of Moscatel)

Very tasty and surprisingly flavorful. My husband hit the nail on the head when he described it as "McDonalds Apple Pie". Weird, but true! Sweet, apply, cinnamonny... I hate McDonalds, but love these parsnips! (I used "white balsamic vinegar")

This recipe didn't work for me. I didn't get the caramelization, and the sauce was too sweet. I think I'll stick to roasting the parsnips in the future.

This is my new favorite parsnip recipe. Delicious!
