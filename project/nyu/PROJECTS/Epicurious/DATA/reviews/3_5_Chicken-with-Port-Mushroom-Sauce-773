I have made this dish on a number of occasions and it's always been a hit with guests.Very easy to prepare and great with simple sides such as steamed broccoli and pumpkin.

The night I was going to make this, I discovered that I did not have the chicken breasts in my freezer that I thought I had but I did, however, have a couple of pork tenderloins. They made an excellent substitution for the chicken. I sliced them into medallions, about 1 inch thick, did not use the flour and instead of the rosemary, I used thyme. I doubled the sauce, as suggested by other reviewers, and used canned milk in place of the cream to cut calories. It was a huge hit and I have made it several times since for company. Thanks for a great recipe!

We love this recipe and there are never leftovers. I've made it multiple times and it's always a huge hit. The only changes I make are to double the mushrooms and the sauce. Wonderful with a loaf of crusty bread.

OUTSTANDING!!! The whole family thought it was one of the best meals Ive prepared in awhile. One small substitution- used fresh rosemary instead of dried. This one is a keeper

An absolutely delicious and elegant dish. Awesome. The port adds such a unique taste. I definitely wish that I had used more mushrooms, though, and was already putting more in than called for. I did have to add a little extra salt to the sauce at the end, and I recommend waiting until the end. A little salt goes a long way. Yum!

O.K. I made this again, however, what I did was, make the sauce,again, and used leftover pieces of chicken and served it over toast points. Also have come to the conclusion I pre fer ground rosemary. Also, I did use Tawny Port, and it was PURPLE.

I used fresh sage leaves instead of rosemary, otherwise DELICIOUS!!! To me, rosemary is for pork.

I had high hopes, but was not impressed - no one even wanted to save the left overs.

It was good. It didn't blow my mind but I will definitely make it again. I used portobello mushrooms and I served it over noodles and even my 2 year old loved it. My chicken breasts took twice the time to cook, however.

It was so-so. It didn't knock me out of my chair. I would not make it again.

Terrific! This dish was easy, tasty and quick. I followed the recipe almost exactly (I did substitute 1/2 tsp. of chopped fresh rosemary instead of dried.) and it was wonderful. I served it on top of the "creamy polenta with parmesan" recipe also on this site (but left out the parmesan on that recipe, that would have been too odd a taste contrast) and the results were wonderful. I definitely will make this recipe again.

This is a terrific recipe. Have made it many times always with great resluts. I however use shallots instead of garlic (double the amount), always use fresh rosemary and a generous amount of black pepper. Those that say the sauce is purple are using the wrong type of Port. Use tawny not ruby. I cut the chicken into chunks, brown them and then toss it all together with pene pasta. Very very good.

Very good recipe. The only change I would make is to use a little less butter next time.

There are many recipes of this nature out there, but this is the only one that I have said WOW about. It was simply delicious. I replaced the garlic with a small shallot and substituted the cream for fat-free sour cream, and it was REALLY good! The sauce was a lovely salmon colour. I will definitely make it again, but here is what I would change: reducing the butter to 2T; adding more port and broth to make extra sauce; reducing the rosemary to 1/2t. Will be perfect next time!

This is delicious! I added a bit of flour to thicken the sauce...I will definitely make this again and I would serve this dish to guests.

I liked the sound of this recipe, but wasn't impressed with the final result. I made the recipe exactly according to the directions, and I just thought the cream was too rich. I like cream sauces, but I thought the cream and the butter just came through too directly in the final result of this recipe. I probably will not make this again, but if I did I would cut the cream to 1/3 cup, and I exclude the flour and butter when browning in favor of simple browning with just a bit of olive oil, salt and pepper. I think that might reach a better balance when tossed with the port-cream-mushroom sauce. NOTE: I was much happier with a similar recipe on epicurious called "CHICKEN WITH CREAMY MUSHROOM SAUCE", which calls for a brandy or sherry. So if you like the idea of this one, you may want to try that one.

Good dish. I have made this several times. I am not sure I would do this for guests but as an everyday dish it is excellent. Make sure you remove the butter before you put the port in.

I am a pretty novice cook, and this recipe turned out just perfect. The sauce was delicious, and the recipe was relatively simple to follow for a novice. I would highly recommend this, and will definitely make again. I served it with roasted root vegetables and steamed asparagus - excellent combination.

Quick and easy, and very flavorful. I used all the recommended ingredients (adding more garlic)and thought all the flavors worked well together. There wasn't as much sauce as I thought there would be, so next time I will increase the amount to serve over rice or pasta.

Delicious! I only had ruby port so I used that, and it turned out great, although the sauce was a bit pink. I will try it next time with the tawny. I did think the rosemary flavor was a bit overpowering and I'd cut back on that next time. Otherwise, fantastic!

The first time I tried this recipe, I used "very dry sherry". It was really good, then I bought the port suggested and it was so good..it is so yummy I have shared it, and everyone elso is happy with this recipe. It is a winner!!

I would only make this recipe again because my husband loved the chicken with port-mushroom sauce. I felt it was just average. I doubled the amount of rosemary to add a little more flavor as well as used madeira. I served it with a side of spinach and pine nuts sauteed in basil oil. Mashed potatoes topped off the meal, and they were a perfect place for the sauce to run into.

Phenomenal recipe!!! I served this with steamed green beans and baby roasted potatoes. It was a huge hit and very simple to make. This recipe is a keeper.

This is a winner. I took the advice and used madeira instead of port and the sauce turned out wonderfully. This is definitely a keeper!!

Liked this recipe very much, as did all my dinner guests. Accolades all around. After reading the other reviews, I opted to substitute Madeira in place of the port. This way you get the right flavor, but without the sweetness. Also, it won't turn the sauce purple.

An interesting dish - the sauce is a little sweet, so season well with salt & pepper. You may need to reduce it for longer than stated to achieve a really nice thickness. Hubby found the whacky purple colour a bit much!

A very quickly prepared and yet tasty dish. There is no need for the cream, as the port and mushroom sauce is tasty enough by itself, without the added calories from cream. Good as a pasta sauce, actually, with smaller pieces of chicken.

Very tasty, with a subtle, complex flavor. It's just a touch sweet, and I think can be used for either chicken or beef. I also think variations can definitely be done easily. I made this for Mother's Day dinner for my wife and my mom and grandmother. It was a big hit!
