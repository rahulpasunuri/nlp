These cookies are delightful to look at. I just ate one, and thought it was good, but not outstanding. I think my favourite part of the flavour was the red currant jelly. If I had the time, I would make them again, because they are so pretty, and I will proudly give them away for gifts over the holidays.

Phenomenal!! I have made these cookies for many years now, and I make them many times a year. Someone always asks for the recipe. They are time consuming, but so worth it. I use seedless raspberry jam instead of currant, because I love almond & raspberries together. Getting ready to make them for Valentine's, and I need to send the recipe to my niece, she requested it, and says that everyone loves them.

Thee were lovely... yes a great deal of work compared to other cookies, but the payout is significant. Take the time give them a try - they are gorgeous.

Can't believe these didn't make it on the top 25 list! I've made these almost every year since 1997 - and definitely heard about it when I didn't make them! These are my absolute favorite Christmas cookies - even my mother-in-law, who is allergic to tree nuts, cannot resist them!

These cookies are absolutely award- winning. They are a little more involved than other cookies that one could easily make - but your friends will worship the ground that you walk on if you master these cookies!

Very good, lovely almond flavor. I was making lots of other cookies so I just made these as cut-out cookies, and decorated them with beautiful multi-colored sanding sugar. I was very, very tempted by the previous reviewer's suggestion of making these with rose-petal jelly, though; will definitely try it in the future! I didn't have to crumble my almond paste first, though I suspect that varies with brand and freshness. I couldn't stomach the beyond-corny name; I told everyone who asked that these were almond sugar cookies.

This cookie dough is very,very easy to manage. The one thing the recipe does not mention is that one must crumble the almond paste into fine crumbs in order to evenly incorporate it into the dough. I followed the recipe exactly and baked beautiful cookies which received excellent reviews from three different audiences: 1) a friend's two teenage sons' eyes lit up when they saw the sparkling starwiches. They thanked me profusely when I packed up a dozen for their family. 2) Co-workers were impressed with the looks and taste of the cookies. 3) Best of all, my neices were happy and grateful for the sparkling starwiches included in their Christmas package. They said they haven't had time to bake any cookies for their families. Only one of the cookies was broken on the trip from Montana to California. I just ate the last cookie. It was good. I do think I will make a couple of changes next time. First, I will include the entire tube of almond paste--seven ounces. The recipe called for 4 ounces, and I think it will be improved by using the entire tube. Second, I will reduce the flour by 1/2 cup. My Danish grandmother, who was the best baker I have ever known, told me that most cookies are mediocre because of too much flour. I'll let you know the results of my "improvements" on a great recipe.

I have been making these cookies since they were published years ago. I have made them with rose petal jam and they were ethereal. I have been asked for the recipe many times! To save time, I skip the interior cutting and jam and use the dough for all my cut-out cookies.

This is a cookie with European appeal that is delicious (and beautiful to serve). It does require time in the kitchen, but the end justifies the means!

These were fantastic. I made them for a family Christmas gathering. We all brought lots of goodies, but these were the first to go! I followed the recipe exactly and thought they were easier than other rollouts. They do take some time, but were well worth it. Very attractive, too!

These were amazing! The cookie tasted of delicate marizipan, perfect texture. They were time consuming though. I found freezing the rolled out cookie dough helped considerably.

Excellent. I adjusted the recipie; 3 sticks of butter struck me as over-the-top. I used two sticks of butter and added two egg yolks to the dough. The resulting cookie was still rich and buttery and delicious. I also added a bit more almond paste and almond extract to intensify the almond flavor.

These cookies were absolutely beautiful and delicious. A bit time consuming, but worth the effort. I made stars and hearts, the hearts beind a bit easier because there were no points to deal with. They will become a tradition in my house.

I love making Christmas cookies and make a variety every year. These are lovely to look at and taste good as well.

I made these for Christmas last year and have made them again several times since then. Incomparable flavor! I did not find them particularly difficult to make but DO allot plenty of TIME. Translates beautifully to Valentine's Day with heart-shaped cutters.

I made this recipe the year it came out and gave the cookies out as gifts. They were tough to make and very time consuming. But now all of my friends and family won't let the holiday season go buy without me making these again for them! They are absolutely delicious!
