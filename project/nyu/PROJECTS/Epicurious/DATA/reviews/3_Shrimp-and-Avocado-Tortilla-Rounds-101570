Very simple recipe but it was a big hit at my holiday cocktail party

These went fast at a housewarming party I had recently. I used Scoops Tostitos to hold all the filling in. They do get a little soggy as the night goes on, but they were almost all gone by then.

Yummy! Very popular appetizer at my party. Kick up the avocado/tomato mix with cayenne and be sure to top shrimp with a cilantro leaf. Very pretty, easy to assemble, easy to eat while holding a drink -- highly recommend.

I don't normally like hot food, so the fact that for once a dish combine two of my favorite flavors didn't include massive quantities of hot items excited me. The flavors combine nicely, and the cherry topping just set it of beautifully. I'm funny though, I had to try some on an old Ritz cracker, and found I prefered it on a savory cracker than on the chip... Other than that, wonderful!
