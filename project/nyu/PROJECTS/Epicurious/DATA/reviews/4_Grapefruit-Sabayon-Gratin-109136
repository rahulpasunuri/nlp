Absolutely Wonderful. Refreshing, beautiful, and so impressive. Our guests raved about it. (Used Port).

i've been making this since the recipe came out in 2004 (have shared and savered photo copies). it has always been a sure thing (except the easter i used salt instead of sugar and it wouldnt thicken. yikes! glad it didn't - saved the guests!)

It took a LONG time to beat the mixture into a ribbon (probably because I too used amaretto). I also substituted half of the grapefruit with bloodred oranges, which I ended up prefering over the grapefruit. If I do it again, I'm going to try just the oranges.

I did not know how this recipe would turn out. When it indicated that a "ribbon" would appear as the beaters were pulled away, I did not see this, so I kept whipping. Finally I decided that the whipping had gone on long enough and to my surprise, the mixture was stiff and delicious! Instead of adding an orange muscat, my lovely lady and I decided upon adding amaretto. It lent a a rich sweet almond flavor that softened the bright taste of the grapefruit. I believe that it took so long to mix due to the high alcohol content of the amaretto. This is a recipe that I highly recommend. This dessert is light, yet full of wonderful flavors. We did not have a thermometer and after the fact do not think it is necessary.

I tried to halve this recipe, with not wholly satisfactory results. I'd try again, maybe with a different wine too.
