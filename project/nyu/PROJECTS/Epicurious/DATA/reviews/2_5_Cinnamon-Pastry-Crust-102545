Just a note to everyone reading the negative review from the Atlanta Georgia cook. She screwed up the recipe for the pie that goes with this (see chocolate almond pie, Bon Appetit) and blasted that recipe, too. I suspect she's a cool-whip girl, so don't give her review much creedence.

I agree with the Atlanta reviewer about the crust. This is a dry crust and I have made far better.

I made the Almond and Cream de Cacio version of the recipe. It was dry. Crust was already slightly brown from the almonds when it went into the oven. I cooked for 10 minutes less than the recommended time and it seemed too brown. Maybe I disliked the crust so much because the pie was terrable. Would not recommend making either.

I used this crust for an apple pie and it was pretty good. I didn't use the almonds or creme de cacao, next time I will. It wasn't spectacular, just so-so. Maybe using more cinnamon would help.

I made this crust for the caramel apple and pear pie. The crust was very good, the pie, so-so. I will make the crust again, for its unusual texture and flavor. The color was also very nice.
