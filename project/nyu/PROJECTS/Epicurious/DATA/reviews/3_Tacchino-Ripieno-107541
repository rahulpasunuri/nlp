Made this for Christmas dinner exactly as the recipe was written. It was awesome and memorable. Very moist and flavorful and it made wonderful leftovers. My husband has requested it again for Easter! Will improvise this time with wild turkey breast, venison sausage, pecans and apricots.

Made it just as directions said. Tasted OK but it was very dry. None of us would make it a second time. Great idea to have a boneless, hence easy to carve, holiday dish, but I'd rather roast a whole turkey next time.

Okay, I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used chicken sausage instead of the pork. That may be why the stuffing didn't stay together when sliced and also the flavor was very sausage-y. Everything else I did as instructed. The butcher didn't butterfly the breasts as I'd asked and so I had to do it myself. Also, I think I need a little practice with the rolling and was only able to roll each breast the short way in order to get all the stuffing into it, so it wasn't a lengthwise roll. Not sure if that was the way it's supposed to be done. All in all, mine wasn't as pretty as the picture, but the meat was perfectly moist with a tasty, crispy skin and my family loved this different way of doing turkey! We ate one half and I gave the other to my parents. I will do it again but I'll create my own stuffing recipe. Thanks for the inspiration, Mario!

I agree on the halving the stuffing (or make two roasts and freeze one for later). I had no problems with the pan drippings, and they made a wonderful addition to the roast at the end. I have substituted 1/2 sweet and 1/2 hot italian sausage for the pork and figs for the prunes with great success. Pine nuts also work well in a pinch when chestnuts aren't on hand.

Love this recipe, but have modified it so that I use a pork loin rather than turkey. It has become a staple holiday dish ... and because I believe the pork loin is juicier than turkey, I have never had a problem with this being dry. I have not tried it with turkey breast.

I made this a couple of days ago for my daughter's christening. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed as the roll turned out very dry, the wine dried up so quickly I used broth to supplement it and prevent the turkey from drying out. But that still did not work. Perhaps tenting the roast with foil half of the cooking time might make it work. Though the stuffing was delicious, will not make this again as it was too much work.

A nice dish, overall, but there may be some problems with the recipe. The amount of stuffing should be halved as you'll never be able to wrap the turkey breast (no matter how flat you pound it) around all that dressing. The dried plums and chestnuts were fantastic together! Get the best quality prunes you can. Altogether, it's a recipe worth trying.

Followed recipe exactly. Came out very dry. Wine burned up! almost immediately. Flavor of turkey and stuffing good. I had a 6 pound breast... halves were not big enough to completely go around the stuffing. Surprisingly, these were much better when reheated.
