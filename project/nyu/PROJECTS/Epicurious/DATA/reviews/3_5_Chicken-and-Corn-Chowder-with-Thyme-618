This recipe is a huge hit with my family. I've made it several times. We're dairy-free due to allergies, so I subbed coconut milk. Delish. It does need a lot of salt and pepper though, and I usually use more bacon than the recipe calls for. Make sure to par-boil the potatoes before you add them. It's not as thick as your traditional chowder, but still very tasty.

I thought this was really bland. I simmered the potato longer than the suggested 5 minutes and I'm glad I did; it would have been undercooked otherwise. I had to add 1/2 tsp. salt and a lot of pepper because the soup was so bland. I added heavy cream (not half-and-half) and it was still thin. By no means was this horrible, but I had expeced it to be better.

I had grilled up some white corn a couple days before & had defrosted a couple of chicken breasts & had all of the other ingredients, so I figured I'd give it a shot. This was SOOO frick'n easy & turned out GREAT (of course, w/some changes). I think that grilled sweet corn made a difference, you can taste a little of that smokey flavor (I also used a 1/2 cup more... 3 ears).I also prefer white meat. I added at least 1 tsp more of thyme & added almost 1 tsp of cayenne pepper to give it a little heat. I didn't use any salt because I made some extra bacon, mixing it into the soup & using it as garnish as well. The last change I made was to use heavy whipping cream instead of half & half. I'll for sure make this again.... ok recipe, but if you take liberties you can definitely make this a hit!

This was OK, but I remembered it being better and thicker...and I remembered a picture of it with inch chunks of corn-on-the-cob (even though I always used frozen corn kernels.) I searched and searched Epicurious and finally found THAT recipe! Old-Fashioned Chicken and Corn Stew ! That's the one to make.

An easy hit with my family. Though it says it makes servings for two, I found it to serve 4 very easily with salad and biscuits. Don't skimp on the thyme and you'll love the results.

This is a go to/easy recipe. I have made it many times. I always double the recipe and cheat and use a whole rotisserie chicken. Makes it fast and relatively easy. I don't add as much thyme as suggested. Definitely need to add salt and pepper to taste. Its always a hit with the family.

Hmmm, this was good but a little bland. It definitely required a lot of seasoning. I served it with cornbread which was a nice compliment. Next time I think I'll add a roasted red bell pepper for a splash of color. I might also use heavy cream instead of half and half as it was a trifle thin.

Terrific and easy to do

This was a definte hit in my house. I did use heavy wipping cream instead of half and half to give it a richer, creamy flavor and added a couple of chicken boullion cubes. Fabulous!

I thought this recipe was okay, not bad - my husband on the other hand went into the kitchen and threw the paper it was printed on in the trash. He stated it was edible BUT he never wanted to eat it again.

This was amazing and a new family favorite. We used chicken breasts instead of the darker meat and it turned out amazing. Other changes made according to the personal tastes of either myself or my mother. Now made at all the family get togethers!

I was really pleased with how this recipe turned out. It makes way more than two servings - more like 4-5! We added garlic to the onions when sauteeing them, and precooked the chicken for safety's sake. Added flour-roux to the final mixture to thicken it up a bit, and used half rosemary, half thyme. Needed salt, and time for the flavors to infuse, but it turned out great! Will definitely make this one again.

Good, but not out of this world. When I think of chowder, I think of a thick, chunky soup, while this turned out rather thin. I'm willing to tweak it to get there, but wish I didn't have to.

My 15 year old daughter would like this at least once a week, in every season. I have made this for sick friends, a new mother just out of the hospital, and for informal dinner parties. It is wonderful! I dress it up with an orange and arugala salad with sweet and sour dressing, french bread, and a yummy dessert, or just serve it for family with the bread. UPDATE My daughter is now 20 and just emailed me for the recipe. USE CHIKEN THIGHS. I laugh at the people who get so complicated cooking their chicken breasts and then say the soup needs more flavor. I add a little more chicken than asked for, but other than that, "Don't mess with success"!

Very good and satisfying!! I omitted the thyme(becuase I did not have any, and I don't think I like it anyway). I used my immersion blender at the end to make the soup creamier, and added LOTS of fresh ground pepper. I used turkey bacon and sauteed the chicken and onions at the same time.

I also added sherry at the end. I doubled the recipe and wound up with a lot more than four servings. Also added a little more bacon.

Great soup and easy to make. It was a little bland, though, the first night. After sitting overnight in fridge and reheating, the taste was much better. Also, it was a little too salty so next time I'll use low-sodium chick broth. Great soup for a cold day!

I really like this recipe. But I have to admit that I added a couple of things, I chopped a small jalapeno pepper and sauteed it with the onion. I used only white meat, and sauteed it before adding the stock. I also added a little bit of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit (but agree with another reviewer that next time I'll mash the potatoes), and a couple of squirts of tabasco. I didn't have fresh thyme on hand, so I used dried. I'm sure that fresh would have been better, but this was an easy and delicious weeknight supper (and today's lunch). ;-)

This isn't a soup, it's truly a meal. I doubled the ingrediants and used split chicked breasts. I also used a Chicken Base to create the broth. Started this early in the day, removed the chicked and de-boned, and allowed the broth to simmer very low heat till just before dinner. Increased the heat and added the remaining ingrediants, including Half and Half and simmered for half an hour. My friends raved. Surved with a Crusty Bread. This is a keeper.

I don't know why this recipe doesn't have a higher rating: it is fantastic! Granted, it was the first and only time I've ever made Corn Chowder, but I found it absolutely delicious! I brought it to work and everyone just loved it and wanted the recipe. I did make some changes: I used one onion and 3 slices of bacon, but doubled the chicken stock, corn, dried thyme and 1/2 and 1/2. Used only white meat. I can't believe how delicious it turned out for such a simple recipe. A classic and an instant keeper!

I HAVE MADE THIS SOUP NUMEROUS TIMES, AND RARELY HAVE LEFTOVERS AFTER TRIPLING THE RECIPE. MY CHILDREN (ALL FOUR OF THEM)ASK FOR IT ON THEIR BIRTHDAYS, OR WHEN THE WEATHER STARTS GETTING COOLER. IT'S A HIT!!

We thought this soup was great--reminded me of my Grandma's soup. We didn't have bacon or fresh corn, so substituted diced prosciutto and frozen white corn, added celery and, as my Grandma would have done, 2 chopped hard boiled eggs at the end. We poached the chicken breasts in the broth and then cut them up.

What this recipe might lack in pizazz, it makes up for in speed and efficiency. You can whip it up quick like a bunny! As a previous reviewer noted, puree-ing some of the potatoes/corn makes the soup creamier, without adding more fat (I drain most of the drippings from the bacon).

I love corn chowder, so I went all-out making this soup: homemade chicken stock, fresh corn off the cob, artisanal slab bacon, etc. It ended up somewhat underwhelming: the brown coloring from cooking the bacon gave the soup a not-so-pretty dark color, there really wasn't as much corn flavor as I would have liked, and I had to pepper the soup so much to get flavor out of it that my wrist still hurts from grinding! It tasted a little better the second day after the flavors had time to blend and concentrate, but even then the high point of the soup was the chunks of yummy bacon I tossed on top of each serving. I guess I'll keep on searching for the perfect corn chowder recipe.

This soup was pretty good after some much-needed doctoring. The recipe is rather bland on its own. I added more thyme, several dashes of tabasco and lots of black pepper. The flavor would definitely mature into something more special if you prepared the soup a day ahead of time... which is what I'll do when I make it again.

This has become one of our family's favorite comfort foods. I use evaporated low fat milk instead of the cream and no body complained, browned the chicken along with the onions for a richer flavor and color, and thickened slightly with a little flour and water since we prefer a chowder that is a little thicker. I also use more thyme than called for. Absolutley a keeper!!

Rating: 3
I'm surprised by the negative reviews. I've made this a couple of times and my family has thoroughly enjoyed. I replace the cream with evaporated milk to save the calories, and am very generous with the fresh thyme. It definately falls into the comfort food category, but is that a bad thing?

Rating: 2
This was certainly simple enough to make. I used fresh corn off the cob, chicken breast meat, and a combination of fresh thyme and marjoram, less than what was called for. We thought the chowder was too thin, so I pureed some of the potato and corn, then added it back to the pot. Because I used fresh-picked corn, it came out very sweet, too sweet for my taste. Also, after sitting overnight, the flavor of the herbs became really strong. I didn't love this chowder, didn't hate it. I'm not ready to discard the recipe, but I definitely will tweak it somehow to make it better. I'll look for comments from other cooks before I try it next time.

Hi, I have made this soup twice to rave reviews! I used Tyme and Rosemary 1/2 each and it turned out GREAT! WIll keep this in my recipe box.

I was disappointed in this soup after all the positive reviews--I thought it was a bit bland-- my husband said it tasted like something his mother would cook. (She's a self described "good everday plain cook" from New England who defines a salad as something with iceberg lettuce or--for a special occasion--something with jello.) I didn't have fresh thyme and used dried so maybe that was part of the problem. I also followed the advice of another cook and used evap skim milk in place of half and half. I'm sure it would be better with the light cream but probably won't bother as it doesn't seem worth the fat and calories.

My family enjoyed this very easy recipe. I added a chicken bullion cube for more flavor, but reduced the thyme to 1 tsp. since I thought it be a bit much - and we enjoyed it thoroughly.

Because of some of the other reviews I cut back on the thyme. I also fried the corn in butter which gave it a very nutty and rich flavor.

Excellent! I've made it twice. Once as presented. The other time I subsituted ham for the bacon (used a little oil for the neceesary fat), added a 1/4 cup of sherry and used whole milk instead of half and half. Beleive it or not, the lower fat method was preferred!
