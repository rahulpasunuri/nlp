This is easy, yet really delicious. Made mostly as written, except used preroasted squash I had. also added paprika(hot), 1/2 jalapeno(cooked with onions), 2% milk instead of nonfat, butter, and used more sherry than called for. Served with the yogurt and fried sage leaves. My roomate said the best soup I ever made, but I don't know if I can back up that claim. Great, though!

I used chicken stock, omitted the tomatoes (allergic) sauteed carrots and celery to add to blender. Added 1 TBSP more of the sherry and used almond milk(allergic to dairy) and added 8 ounces crabmeat. HEAVEN!!!FYI- in milk based soups almond or oatmilk work better than soy or rice (more heat stable)

I searched for a butternut squash bisque after having an unbelievably good one in a four star restaurant in Park City. This was the closest I came to that and it is great. I have been making this soup every winter. Also bought the squash and broth from Trader Joe's making it simpler. Instead of yogurt garnish I use a bit of blue cheese and some walnuts floated on top.

Made this to take to Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. I did make the following modifications: - Added a fair amount more sherry than was called for - Used 2/3 Fat Free Half and Half and 1/3 heavy cream - Added some cayenne pepper to give it a kick GREAT!

Tis is the best squash bisque ever I have been doing it for a long time. I've tried other versions this is by far the best.I sometimes omit the milk and add cream instead of the yogurt.

I love to make this soup when the weather starts to get colder...it's always a big hit. Sometimes I add a large cut-up sweet potato...I also think you have to use good vegetable stock...I use Trader Joe's Organic Vegetable broth (and use the whole box) and buy 2 20 oz. pkgs. of peeled and cut squash from the same store or the supermarket. Somtimes instead of adding non-fat milk I add non-fat half and half. Either way I think this soup is delicious!

I read the reviews and was excited to try this soup. Unfortunately, however, I found the results very bland, even after I added extra salt, pepper, and sherry. I followed the directions exactly... perhaps chicken stock would be a better choice than the vegetable stock I used. It tasted better the second day, but I don't think I'll be trying this recipe again.

Terrific soup. My picky eater balked and asked what is was. I told him tomato vegetable soup. He tasted, tried another spoonful and devoured the whole bowl and asked for more. Very rare. I substituted chicken broth and added an extra pureed can of tomatoes. I used soy milk as we have a dairy allergic family member. Everyone loved this soup and asked to see it again. Great Velvety texture.

With such a simple recipe, you would think it would be fresh and good. This was so bad, even the best, most innovative cook could not redeem it!

This was incredible! My friends think I'm a gourmet chef thanks to this site. My palate keeps me coming back to this site time and time again. Again, make this. It's easy and an absolute delight to your tastebuds

Easy and delicious! Perfect Autumn fare, or a Thanksgiving starter. We've made it twice -- definitely use fresh thyme or none at all. Keeps well for a couple days in the fridge, too.

Delicious! Like a cross between a good tomato soup and a butternut soup. I added more dry sherry, right at the end of cooking time, as I felt it needed it. Such a nice fragrance it gave to my house, too!

Very good, and quite easy. I liked the low fat content!

This was the start of a great dinner party. I served this up along with a rose sparkling wine and they worked well. The squash took longer to soften that the recipe called for so next time I will dice it up in smaller chunks. I would like to be able to comment on how it tastes the second day, but Mom stole some before it ever made it to the blender so there was only enough for each guests' serving. I guess that says a lot!

Very good and very easy to make. I also substituted chicken broth for vegetable broth. Regarding the squash (acorn or butternut), baking it beforehand makes peeling a lot easier.

I would make this again only because my kids loved it and it's so easy to prepare. I personally thought something was missing. Saffron, maybe?

Fantastic!! The only problem with it was that we couldn't stop eating it....There are worse things to eat, I guess!

I left some of the vegetables chunky and substituted chicken broth for vegetable broth.

Just made a batch of this for lunch tomorrow, trying to stick close to the original recipe. I only used 1 T. of oil to saute the onions and squash; added a few frozen broth cubes when sauteeing the squash. Since I had an abundance of tomatoes, I used 2 large fresh, seeded tomatoes instead of canned. Only used one t. of dried thyme, but my initial taste test tells me this is a good soup. I used an acorn squash, though, and spent an inordinate amount of time "peeling" it -- any suggestions for simplifying this step? Perhaps a butternut squash is easier to peel than acorn because of the shape??

I have made this soup several times as-is (but with soy milk) and find it delicious. It is thick and nicely seasoned. The sherry is a nice touch.

As I was about to add the thyme, I did not think it would go well with the sweet smell of squash. So I omitted salt, pepper and thyme and added 2 tbsp brown sugar, freshly ground nutmeg, and a tbsp of crarified butter. The result was too sweet, so I added 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice. The soup, topped with sour cream, was great!!

Definitly a "three fork" dish. The combination of onion, tomatoes, and butternut squash create a sweet, red-orange soup, thick and smooth enough to hold up the "dollop" of yohurt suggested at the end of the recipe. Both the yogurt and the sour dough bread I served with the soup, were goods foil to the tomato sweetness. I suggest using only 1/2 the thyme called for, tasting, and then adding the rest if desired. I found 1/2 tsp. to be the right amount for me. The recipe calls for diced canned tomatoes. Mine had seeds in them; so I ran them through food sieve. I don't think the soup, which is very smooth, would have been as attractive with tomato seeds floating around.
