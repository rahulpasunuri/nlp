Have made this in the past and it was easy and delicious. Any thoughts out there on if this recipe would work well subbing short ribs for the brisket?

The smallest brisket I could find was nearly 4 lbs. It was not second cut. I trimmed some of the fat off, and now I think that might have been a mistake. Are you supposed to leave all the fat on? For the garlic, I just peeled and smashed the garlic cloves; I did not chop them. I wouldn't use the full amount of celery next time. Thanks for the tips to only use half the tomatoes. I refrigerated the brisket overnight, sliced it cold from the fridge, then laid the slices in a baking dish wish the sauce, covered in foil, and baked at 350 for 30 minutes. My sauce was actually too thin -- it would have been better strained and reduced on the stove.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and there was not one bite left.

This was so easy and delicious. Make sure you do have a very tight lid to braise. I forgot to check and the sauce was a little drier than I wanted. I just added more chicken stock. I will try this in the crockpot after searing the meat next time...

A friend of mine made this for dinner at a girl's beach weekend and we were all RAVING and asking for the recipe. I made it for my family of 6, and we were licking our plates and eating THIRDS, though we know eating that much might not be the best idea. :) Hands own, one of my absolute favorite recipes to make!

This recipe is EXCELLENT!!! I changed it up just a big by adding 4 cloves of garlic and dusting my brisket with chipotle chili powder before searing. I doubled the meat since I was making this for a party, but kept the rest of the ingredients the same and it was the perfect amount of liquid; I also could have fed an army with the amount of meat there was!! I got RAVE reviews and handed the recipe out to 5 friends as well. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone that is looking for a great basic brisket recipe to start with.

My Jewish fiancee said this was the best brisket he's ever had ... better than his grandma's! I made it as written with one exception: I made the batch 2 days ahead and left the briskets whole. I then brought the whole thing (sauce and meat) up to near room temp, cut the brisket crosswise in 1/4" slices, slowly warmed the sauce, then carefully laid the sliced brisket on top of the warm liquid to steam it until it was warmed and time to eat. This enabled me to not have to be cooking the whole day and the brisket came out perfectly flaky and tender. I thought the 1/4 cup of vinegar was going to be too much (the pots smelled very acidic), but it cooked down well and did its job of tenderizing the meat. I used a very good second cut of brisket and doubled the batch and it was just enough for 6 adults and 2 kids. I blended half the sauce and ladled a little on top of the brisket. The other half I put in the fridge and used for post roast the next weekend (also perfect).

This is a fabulous recipe -- the flavor is intense and delicious. I substituted fresh Roma tomatoes, quartered, for the canned tomatoes, and much preferred the flavor and texture.

Didn't think it was TOO tomatoey (I would reduce amount a bit or just add whole tomatoes...I ended up cooking it for another 2 hours b/c wife wasn't ready for dinner, added two bay leaves, 4 potatoes, half cup white wine and another cup chicken stock. Was a lot of oil when done cooking b/c of the fat side of the brisket...would maybe trim off a bit before cooking next time but was good nevertheless

This was a very tasty brisket recipe. I only used one 14 oz. can of tomaotes and added 1/2 cup of white wine and one tsp of dried thyme. I also added another 1/2 cup of chicken stock, as it usually cooks away, but this was very moist and tender. My husband and kids liked it very much and my 11 year old even liked it and she is very particular about what she eats. Definitely one to save to my recipe box!

I agree, way too much tomato, couldn't even taste the beef.

I found that putting the brisket on the BBQ for awhile...browned it, and gave it a slight burnt taste was great. Then I sliced the brisket (across the grain) into 1/4 slices was a great way to have tender strips...

Great, simple recipe! My first brisket..aww. Got rave reviews from whole family, young kids included. Served over pasta and can see why many wished it made more sauce. Next time will probably add some more wine(added a 1/2 cup of good chardonnay), water and add'l broth to get more sauce. Also, added a dash of basil and oregano because I was surprised it didn't call for any herbs. Came out awesome, definitely a keeper.

While I found this dish to be flavorful and satisfying, it lacked a certain wow factor. I found it to be a little too tomato tasting.

I just made this today. It is DELICIOUS. It's a no-fool recipe. I cooked my brisket for 3 hours. If it tastes this good out of the oven, I can't imagine how good it'll taste tomorrow! Thank you for a wonderful dish.

Excellent hearty meal. Other than the time spent searing and sauteing, it came together really easily. I noted that other reviewers wished there was more sauce, so I added another 1/2 a cup of chicken stock. I had to use whole tomatoes that I crushed by hand. All in all, excellent. I served it over egg noodles. I think one could use this recipe with a variety of cuts (short ribs, stew meat, etc).

Foolproof. Followed recipe to the letter and the results are succulent & hearty. I had a 4.65 lb brisket and it was done in the oven after 3 hrs 15 mns., so I guess that was a slight deviation, oh and subbed a cup of wine for the broth, which I used beef broth for... how embarrassing, I guess I didn't follow it exactly. My bad! But totally delicious!!!

Very good. I added some bay leaves to the pot before braising in the oven.

LOVED this recipe! Next time we would use first-cut. My husband loves potatoes with this so next time, we will add yukon gold potatoes or even small red potatoes in the pot. Cooked in our convection oven 2 1/2 hours nicely.

This was my first brisket ever, and my son said it was the best he'd ever had! What a fabulous recipe, and so easy to make. This is definitely a keeper, just the way it is!

What a delicious meal it made! I had a 4 pound brisket which took about 4 hours in the oven until it was easily flaking apart. It was so easy and perfect for a cold and rainy day. I did use a can of whole tomatoes and squeezed them through my fingers as I added them to the pot. Based upon reviews I was planning to add extra carrots within the last 30 - 60 minutes of cooking time, but forgot! If I had cut the carrots into 1" chunks in the first place they would have been perfect. Mine were still okay but very soft and still delicious. I did add chunks of potato in the last hour which probably absorbed some of the sauce. I wished I had more sauce! I don't eat a lot of beef, but I was very pleased that I chose this recipe for my splurge!

We loved the recipe. The sauce was absolutely delicious and the brisket came out tender and tasty and great. I highly recommend this. It was one of the easier recipes I looked at and turned out perfect. Thanks for the recipe. It's a perfect Passover brisket.

Made this with double carrots, no celery and with diced tomatoes instead of crushed due to pantry restrictions. It was WONDERFUL and my whole family and guests enjoyed. My cook time for an almost 3 lb brisket was just about 3 hours.

I actually used this recipe with deer brisket over the holidays (my mother had a freezer full of deer meat after hunting season!). It was very very good--even for picky tastebuds--and everyone actually thought it was beef until I told them otherwise. I didn't have canned crushed tomatoes so I just smashed up one whole tomato and it worked just fine. I'm doing the recipe again...this time with beef...for New Year's Eve.

In response to the question by A Cook from Fishers, IN: It can be done either way and both have merits. Now, when you serve the meat, you can serve it with broth and veg together, or you can strain it for just broth. In a classic way (but brisket is very much a personal thing) you would strain it. In reserving the liquid, I would personally strain it before freezing. A nice trick is that in any stew, some very good chefs will discard the vegetables that were cooked togwether and strain and reduce the ilquid so it is thicker. The veg.(baby carrots) and potatoes (nice ovals) are cooked seperately and then placed with the stew meat on the plate with a reduced sauce. That is a also great way to do it when reheating stew as the veg and potatoes can seem a bit brown and mushy later on, and this way the flavors are brighter. Of course, this straining, etc is not at all necessary , and some would disagree completely!

We used a 3.5 lb. brisket and the recipe handled that much meat just fine. Be aware the meat will really shrink in the cooking. We sub'd yellow onion, lagar for the chicken stock, & added a bay leaf too. I served it over egg noodles & the result was a very tasty, chunky dish. I liked the large chunks of carrot & celery. This rated a 7/10 on my personal rating system. We've frozen half, including the meat. I think shredding the meat & serving hot over a pasta will be lovely. It will require some liquid when reheating such as red wine.

Have a question...In Gourmet...the recipe suggests saving leftover braising luquid and use as sauce for fettuccini or base for veg soup. Wondering if when i serve this....do i strain out the veg and serve that with meat over mash potatoes....or just serve the meat with mash potoatos...(and no liquid) ?? I would think it would need at least some of the carrots/celery with meat...but wasn't sure. There's no pic in the mag.

The flavor of this dish was pure comfort in this cooler weather, and it made great leftovers (gained more flavor the longer it was stored). I had to add about a cup of water to the pan at about hour 2. It turned out wonderfully.

I doubled the carrots and skipped the celery. The flavor was terrific,but 3.5 hours was definitely too long in my gas oven. Next time I'll pull it out earlier. Yum! Definitely a great comfort dish for a cool evening.

Very good recipe-especially if looking for some good fall "comfort food"! It is easy to make, and smells incredible while cooking. Enjoyed by everyone at the table!

This is a wonderful recipe but I wouldn't get the "second cut". My butcher didn't like that cut said it was WAAAY too fatty. There is enough fat in any cut of brisket really. I served this with mashed cauliflower with "Leek Confit" -- look it up on Epicurious from Oct 2008 Bon Appetit. The flavors are great...and a nice Cabernet did not hurt the cause either!
