This was really extraordinarya nice comfort dish meal, especially if served over mashed potatoes. In terms of authenticity cudos to A Cook from New England & A Cook from northeast. That's what cooking is all about, tweaking to make it your own. @Ephemerella: Take an epicurean leap. You might like the flavors (by the way, 1960s is a plural,not a possessive).

The dictionary definition of 'goulash' is - a rich meat stew highly seasoned with paprika. It says the def. of the word 'gulyas' is 'herdsman's meat'. So those who are saying it is a beef stew are correct, as goulash can be beef stew, or lamb, and those who are saying it is a variation of goulash are correct because it does use an appreciable amount of paprika. Now, if the Hungarian hot paprika is used that is even better. About ketchup and worcestershire.. those may be innovations and not like my Hungarian Momma used to make in the old country,, but.. innovations are allowed, aren't they? well, not if you are into a classical dish, but this is admittedly not a classical and traditional recipe.

What is the actual definition of 'goulash'? What does it have to have, and what has to be avoided for it to be a variation of 'goulash'?

A lot of controversy on this recipe. To me, it looks like an interesting recipe as a change from just the same old beef stew. Maybe the title should not be 'goulash', but maybe 'goulashy beef soup'.. hahaha I'm going to go shopping for some of the ingredients to make a variation that includes some of the opinions of reviewers. I won't use ketchup, but maybe a bit of tomato sauce, gonna get some caraway seeds, a splash of worcestershire (I use it on beef but never tried it in soup), paprika, potatoes, and am going to add some celery, and some carrots too. ha! I know, I know, I've taken it yet one more step,or two, away from being really a goulash,, but if it ends up good and nutritious then that's alright.

As described, this was a nice rustic dish. Perfect for dinner. I am not Hungarian, but I did live in Hungary and Austria both. It seems that everyone has their own recipe, like our vegetable soup or stew. Yes indeed, most Austrian goulash that I had included caraway seeds, but I can also tell you that they called it goulash. What I don't understand is people rating recipes they don't try or make major changes then rate it poorly. Just try it - you may even like it.

After reading the list of ingredients and method of preparation, I would say that this would be quite a delicious beef soup. However, I feel that I must make the note that this is not at all a traditional goulash, or Gulyas. Actually, flour and tomatoes are never used in the real deal. Here is a good gulyas recipe: http://www.gumbopages.com/food/hungarian/gulyas.html

I have to agree with Andy here: this may be a nice tasty stew or soup,but it isn't goulasch. The idea of evolving recipes is good and legitimate, as long as they are recognizeable. There is nothing goulasch-y in this thing. It's just another stew.

This notion of calling ketchup-and-worcestershire-sauce concoctions "goulash" seems to have originated in the 1960's Betty Crocker style books where you find bizarre Americanizations of European and Chinese dishes. The result is strange artificially savory-sweet braised beef stew. NOT anything like a true goulash. And I DON'T consider these American condiment-based versions of international flavors to be healthy recipes. Would you eat an ignorant ketchup-and-mustard-and-cheez-whiz based version of a fondue and call it real food? It's not only not good but unhealthy, too!

for andy: thanks for the review, but no gristle for me, thanks. and i agree with the reviewer who said that recipes are meant to evolve and change--no need to be a food snob. . .unless its about buffalo wings!

I like this better as a stew, so I thicken it by adding small cubes of potato 30 minutes before the end. They add a nice flavour too. And you can make it with pork (also as a stew). I believe it is then called 'porkolt'.

this is not gulyas soup! true gulyas is a very basic , full bodied soup consisting of basic components.

Great soup especially for the winter! Loved the flavor of the caraway seeds with the onion and beef. Easy to make just takes some time to simmer, but not a problem if you make it a day ahead). I made this recipe as written except that i added only 1/4 cup of ketchup. Must serve this with fresh crusty bread!

Made this over a very cold and snowy Utah weekend and it was really good. I was tempted to just serve it the first night but am glad I let it sit. (Apparently epicurious.com doesn't recognize paragraphs) Andy63, great that you love your heritage, love your country (been there twice) and nothing personal but can we not go there? Trying to make one statement for what is and isn't one specific dish is an exercise in futility. I've been through too many arguments where someone from Texas, Kansas City, Kentucky, Tennessee, etc. has proclaimed exactly what "barbeque" is. "Barbeque contains these ingredients and only these and if it has anything else it isn't barbeque." It's just an exercise in futility. Irish stew is another lightning rod. I once posted my modifications to an Irish Stew recipe based on my maternal grandmother's recipe and was told that what I posted wasn't Irish Stew. Apparently my grandmother Mary Katherine McShane who was born, lived and died in the same small town in Ireland didn't know what Irish Stew was. Just my $0.02. Food dishes are always evolving. Let them live. Or at least make the dish so you can evaluate it.

This recipe worked very well for me. I was delighted with the result. I did a few things differently based upon what was available at my local market. I could not find boneless chuck so I used semi-boneless instead. The cut was nicely marbled but not overly so and my soup did not have excessive fat. I browned the meat in batches in a saute pan then added the meat to a stock pot. After the last batch of meat, I deglazed the saute pan with a small amount of vegetable stock and added that to the stock pot. I also added a small bag of mini carrots in phase one of the dish. The meat became so tender in the first cooking that I did not have to break it apart on the second day. The addition of the ketchup and Worcesterchire the following day gave the perfect amount of extra flavoring (note that the dish calls very little salt). The ketchup also gave the soup a beautiful color. My dinner guest had seconds and then thirds of the dish. Tremendous success!

This is a potentially decent dish but it is ONE thing that it is NOT !And that is a Goulash Soup ! Goulash (or [correctly]Gulyas]) is made of various cuts of beef , beef bones and gristle, onions, paprika, green peppers (optional), tomatoes (optional)beef stock or water - and that's all she wrote. The caraway seeds are a Viennese idea, garlic is redundant as for the ketchup, Worcester sauce etc......the least said the soonest mended. As I said : a potentially OK dish but goulash it ain't !
