I also loved this recipe. I added an extra cup of wine for flavor toward the end, which I highly recommend.

Delish! Definitely go for one cup of wine instead of the 1/2. And don't be afraid to go with something besides dry... I used Moscato and it came out wonderful!!

This was a tasty recipe! It took about 45 minutes to prepare and I also made the other recipes from the article (edamame dip and fennel). I wish I'd read the reviews and put in the extra wine--probably would have helped the flavor. I'd make it again.

We really enjoyed this dish. I agree with the addition of more wine. I didn't add the olive oil at the end and don't think we missed anything, Did all the prep prior to making the recipe and it was easy to make while entertaining guests at the same time. Next time I will add shrimp or scallops.

Great recipe! Delicious! My entire family loved it, including my 2 year old and 4 year old children. Especially with the egg on top!

Very delicious. I would recommend a bit more wine (1 cup) and is probably best with slightly runny yolks. I overcooked mine. Can't wait to make risotto balls with the leftovers!

Excellent! This is a wonderful winter to spring risotto. Requires a little more attention to detail than a simpler Milanese, but well worth the effort!
