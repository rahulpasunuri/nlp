I followed the directions presented here, but I added some cinnamon and all spice to it for a little flavor kick. It is like a dessert. The topping was so nice and crunchy. It is a little sweet if you have very sweet sweet potatoes. Next time I will taste test to determine how much sugar to add to the potatoes.

would love to review but could not make this because measurements for all of the ingredients and even some of the ingredients are not listed but are referred to in the recipe, ie.,eggs,milk, and several other ingredients. I could guess?
