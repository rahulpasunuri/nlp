I made this for a big cook-off last night, and it was the favorite out of all ten dishes served - YUMMY! I followed the recipe as written with one exception. I added doubled the jack cheese in the cornbread. The only thing I would do differently when I make it next time is dry out the cornbread a little more - it was very soft when it went on the grill. We all commented how good this would be as a dinner salad, maybe add grilled chicken, steak or shrimp. Enjoy this awesome dish.

Wonderful! Requires a bit of prep, but well worth it. The cornbread is easy to make, and eliminates the soggy bread that all too often spoils Panzanella. Very flavorful. Would definitely serve as a nice BBQ side for guests. Also a great dinner for hot summer night.

A good salad but I thought the cornbread didn't add enough value for the effort it took to make and add it. Would eliminate this next time.

We loved it. I made the cornbread in a Bundt pan. This salad is fresh and different.

This is excellent served either as a main course for a light dinner (we added some sliced salami) or as a nice side to grilled fish, chicken, etc.
