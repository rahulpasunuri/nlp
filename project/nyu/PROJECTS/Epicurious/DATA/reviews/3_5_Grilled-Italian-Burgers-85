I've been making burgers like this for years,although with some slight differences. I use sweet Italian sausage,and my favorite spaghetti sauce as a condiment. I add grated Parmesan cheese as well as the provolone, and baby spinach leaves(uncooked) with sliced beefsteak tomatoes.Not a lot of prep time involved, it leaves more time to enjoy the company of family and friends around the BBQ.

I used ground turkey instead of the ground pork & they still turned out delicious. Served with an antipasto salad.

Great! I did use chopped fresh basil instead of the dried herbs and half sausage (mix of hot and sweet) and half ground pork. Better than beef!

My boyfriend and I made this recipe this weekend and thought these were possibly the best hamburgers we'd ever eaten. We made the mistake of adding the sun-dried tomatoes to the meat mixture (we added ground beef instead of the additional 8 oz. of sausage) and they turned out fantastic. We'll do that from now on, and we will be making these again and again. Terrific! (Also don't be afraid to experiment with different cheeses.)

This equally delicious to use with turkey sausage and ground turkey for a low-fat alternative. Added 1 clove minced garlic to the tomato/mayo. Fantastic.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly (but doubled it.) The thick cheese was a tad much and I thought the burgers were way too big. Next time I am going to make everything much smaller. I couldn't get my mouth around everything and then things got messy. Still yummy though. I have passed this recipe on to friends already.

These are tasty and different. May I suggest that after you make your patties you put a hole in the center with your finger (doughnut fashion.) They'll cook through this way. I like alfalfa sprouts or lettuce on these too.

3+ Forks! This is quite the tasty burger with an unique taste. I used a spicy italian sausage with the ground pork and I thought it was wonderful. It makes a big burger with all the toppings. In the catagory of "gourmet burger".

There are five of us and three do not like spicy dishes. I used one pound of hot italian and one pound of ground pork (just ask at the meat counter). It was just right, both quantity and spice content. I agree the tomato/mayo makes it! A definite keeper.

I'm addicted... you'll never eat another regular hamburger again. And the mayo/dried tomato spread is delicious.

These are delicious! I, too, used mild Italian sausage instead of the ground pork (didn't have any ground pork at the market), which worked fine. Once you get the pepper quarter, the onion slice, the burger and the provolone on your bun, you've got a really tall sandwich! The sun-dried tomato mayonnaise really helps make this recipe, but it's just a winner any way you look at it.
