Well worth the time to start the night prior. I served these with a hand-smoked ham and I think the rolls outshone the ham. They kept well for several days, too. Can't wait to make these again.

These rolls are light, airy and delicious! Made them for Christmas dinner with a pork roast and they were a big hit!
