If you sub other ingredients for the bouillon and chickpea water, the taste will suffer.

This was awful. As an experienced cook, I should have known that this is an amateurish recipe. Broccoli is not good roasted, and somehow even with a can of anchovies and plenty of garlic, plus Romano cheese, this dish had no flavor at all.

I agree with some of the previous reviews, this recipe on its own is a little bland and needs a little kick or something. I added a half of a diced fennel bulb with the anchovies and garlic (extra garlic than called for) when it was sautéing. Next time Ill use the whole bulb of fennel or more. I also deglazed the pan with ½ - 1 cup white wine before adding the liquid from the garbanzo beans. I added a little crushed red pepper to the garbanzo beans and broccoli when I tossed it with the sauce. When I served it, my son and I thought it still needed something. I chopped up about 3 pickled hot red cherry peppers from the refrigerator and added it. When we served each dish we topped it with finely shredded Swiss cheese (I realized at the last minute I only had a little parm left) and sprinkled the top of each plate with extra sharp Hungarian paprika. The cheese and paprika finished the dish perfectly. I will definitely make this again, but with the extra ingredients. The dish seems like it should still have a somewhat delicate flavor, and it kept that when I added the additional ingredients, but it definitely benefited from more depth.

The combination of ingredients was great but the outcome was not as tasteful.

Wonderful, nearly vegetarian meal.

Sounds better than it turned out. The anchovies and garlic roasting smelled great and even with lots of pecorino cheese, it was still pretty flat. Didn't use the canned chickpea liquid either.

I didn't add anchovy pate nor chicken bouillon; used vegetable stock instead of chicken bouillon. I also used fresh snowpeas instead of can chickpeas...added a little bit of dry chives, I thought it was a rather decent vegetarian dish.even though it's not very similar to the original recipe any more.

After reading the other reviews I decided to use fresh chicken stock I'd just made in place of the reserved chickpea liquid (measured about 3/4 cup). I also added some sliced sun-dried tomatoes to the mix before roasting. Skipped the final step of adding pasta to finish roasting and just tossed it into the broccoli mixture before serving instead. No sauce -- just a shaving of romano. Husband liked it. Interesting combo of flavors I wouldn't have thought of putting together. Good, but not great.

This recipe was okay. I didn't have to order emergency pizza, but I don't think I'll ever make it again. It was a nice experiment into something other than baked ziti, though.

I thought this looked great until I saw the bullion cube - don't own one, won't buy one, and sure won't cook with one! That, plus using liquid from beans is not such a great idea since therein lies the gas producing essence... Please - no more bullion!

Disappointing at best. The anchovies did add a nice zing but overall it lacked any other dimension in flavor. I thought the chicken bouillon would be salt overkill, so I substituted the liquid (including chickpea water) for low-sodium chicken stock. The sauce was too watery and the dish was a bit of a one-note. Good idea, but not interesting enough.

This recipe has potential. However, I would not ever use the bouillon. Also, the can of chickpeas...retire the juice in the can. Used rinsed chickpeas (acceptable). Everything else sounds good -- the broccoli and whole-wheat pasta...yes. The anchovys and grated Romanao add enough salt. So, again, no bouillon or juice from the can of chickpeas.

Sodium is left out of the nutritional analysis. I figure, using organic low-sodium beans and no salt in the pasta cooking water, otherwise as written, this is ONLY 690mg of sodium per serving. You could cut out 250 of that by using "umami-rich" unsalted chicken broth instead of the bean water and bouillon.

This recipe is great. You can make it very fast and it's an excelent choice for dinner.

A fast and simple dinner recipe- I did make a couple changes however. I used anchovies with capers to lessen any fish taste and give another level of flavor. I also only used half a chicken bouillon cube as there is plenty of salt in this dish already.
