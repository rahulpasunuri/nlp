I would use chilli oil instead of Blk pepper. Also, rice paper for wrapping is a must, but aside from that, if you can only take one spring roll recipe with you, this is the one.

This recipe is delicious and very authentic. I made these rolls and they taste quite comparable to those made by my friends mother who is vietnamese! I sub'ed shitake for wood ear mushrooms and they still turned out great!

Wow, were these good. The prep is not hard at all. One reviewer was complaining that the shrimp overpowered the flavor...not at all. It's one of those recipes where the taste has a wonderful quality of its own that surpasses the sum of its parts.

My parents sponsored a Vietnamese family in 1975. Growing up it was my favorite treat to eat fresh shrimp rolls made by Lang. One day I sat her down and had her tell me how to make them. This recipe is pretty darn close. It sounds like alot of work (and it is!) but once you taste one you understand it is totally worthwhile. Once I made a quadruple batch for a party. Yikes! Anyway follow this and you will have authentic reall shrimp rolls. I like them pretty big and I use real rice paper. You can eat them cold...as good as cold pizza for breakfast if not better.

These spring rolls really are quite wonderful. I added salt, as I felt it was needed for the American taste (even though I don't do a lot of salt) but some is necessary. I tried to freeze both raw and cooked. The cooked worked out fine. Put in 350 oven for about 10 minutes and they are good. I added tamari sauce (soy sauce) to the dipping sauce as it was too sweet without. But a really good recipe. Thanks!

This recipe kicks, but unless you are an Asian peasant, it is going to take you forever to roll these suckers. I have never made a small batch, always 200 at a time, and it is an 8-hour affair. Don't bother with variations. Also, you can fry these, cool them on a rack, and freeze them. Be sure to wrap them very tightly in units of a dozen and then put them in a freezer bag. I would then suggest baking them at 450 for 10 minutes. The spring roll wrapper will be a little crisp, but they do hold. Be sure to get quality ingredients at an Asian foods store. Don't rely on popular brands from your local grocery chain. Also, be sure to have an oil thermometer or temperature-controlled fryer. The oil temp is key here.

I did not add the carrots or the mushrooms and only about half the amount of shrimp (only becuase I had that on hand). After those alterations these were amazingly good. A little tricky to roll up, but well worth the effort. They were a big hit at the party.

Complicated recipe, as so many of the great ones are, and well worth it. I've traveled extensively in SE Asia and live in CA where I can get excellent Vietnamese food anytime. These are still worth making at home. Better than classic!

If you are going to this much work, try other recipes on this site. The shrimp overpowers the pork (even with one or two pulses processing the shrimp - too pasty; chop it). Too many carrots, too many things going on to relish any one taste. Good directions for frying. Nice presentation.

These spring rolls taste just like those in the restaurants. I tried making them in the past with other recipes but they never turned out right. Yummy!
