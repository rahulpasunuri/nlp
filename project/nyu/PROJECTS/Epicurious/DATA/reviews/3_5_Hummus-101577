This is my favorite hummus recipe, and it's easy once you have the ingredients. One jar of tahini from a Mideastern store will last for several big batches, and keeps for a long time in the fridge. If you're pressed, skip the parsley oil and pine nuts, but they add a lot and make it the hit of the party.

Definitely follow the instructions of the two other users, to make the parsley olive first in the processor (adds a nice fancy touch and extra flavour, just be careful how much you put on it), then store. I roasted the garlic and it added a nice touch (3 big pieces) by making the garlic a more subtle flavor. Could use another garlic piece if you or the people you are making it for wanted garlicly hummus - so four like the recipie says. Then add everything in. I used about 1/2 cup of tahnini instead of 2/3. 1 lemon was fine, but more could have been nice for a more summery taste. I did add extra water ~3/4 cups in total - but use the chickpea can residual water. I used about ~1/3 cup of olive oil total. Was glad I added in less of the ingredients at first and added to taste. It will definitely benefit from cayenne, cumin, black pepper, and extra salt. Instead of pine nuts (boyfriend disklikes them) I used (roasted) pistachios. I also added 4 to the actual hummus, and put the remaining coresely chopped ontop of the parlsey oil on top of the hummus in the final serving bowl.

I just made this and thought it was great right out of the blender with a cracker. I used a single 540 g can of chickpeas, rinsed and drained (saving liquid) with 2 large cloves of garlic, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 Tbsps tahini, 2 Tbsps oil and 1/2 cup of the chickpea liquid. It turned out fabulous and the parsley oil is a great garnish - for a potluck but this hummus is great on its own. I eat hummus a lot and this is a keeper. Simple, great.

This is quick and easy way to make hummus, but there was a bit too much tahini for me, as it seemed to overpower the chick peas. I'll adjust ratios a bit next time, but this a great place to start from when making hummus.

very fine recipe. very easy. modifications: crushed the garlic with the flat side of the knife (one good pound). Also added some water. the resulting mix had a good rich and nutty flavor. recommendation: chickpeas vary greatly seasonally, even canned, same manufacturer. First time I made this I didn't drain all the water, and didn't rinse, and the hummus flavor was vague, can-ish, and weird.

Great Hummus! I like to use part chick peas and part cannelini beans, just because I love cannelini beans. I know, I know they're Italian, blah, blah, blah. Don't knock it 'til you try it.

one can also allocate the prep of the garlic on the cutting board. using a food processor makes it easy for you. why have an extra cutting board and knife to wash? just throw everything into the FP, adding the oil last (after adding water to help the texture). this way, no yogurt should be added, and you can keep the recipe vegan, as it should be.

This hummus is perfect with or without the parsley oil and pinenuts. Everything is in proportion. I disagree with prior posters who added more lemon juice. I always dislike homemade hummus where the cook adds too much lemon juice or garlic. The tahini needs to predominate and it won't if you add too much lemon and garlic.

Rating: 4
Who knew homemade hummus was so easy and so delicious? This tastes much better than store-bought hummus. I use a little less tahini than called for - I think 2/3 cup of it makes it too predominant of a flavor. I skip the parsley and the pine nuts and don't miss it. This is my go-to recipe for hummus.

Easy and yummy. I up the lemon juice a bit, add some cumin, and save the liquid from the chick-peas with which to thin the mixture if needed. I actually really like the parsley oil (less oil, more parsley!) and the toasted pine nuts are a great surprising crunchy addition. I've even added roasted red peppers to the mix and it's a really nice change. Terrific either way on toasted whole wheat pita thins or various colorful veggies.

This is a big recipe, so I hope you love hummus. It's also a little on the bland side which is great for jazzing it up how you'd like it. I'd go lighter on the tahini, add more pine nuts. This was an early homemade try for me, and I've had a lot of hummus from the store and friends. I guess I was hoping for more. If you've made hummus and know how to add some extra flavor this might work for you. Decent but plain in my opinion.

I have made this several times and always get so many compliments on it. The one thing that I change is I substitute plain yogurt for the tahini. It saves on $ and fat but not on taste. In fact people say they prefer it with yogurt as opposed to the tahini. Try it! This hummus is super yummy and very easy. I blend mine in the blender instead of the food processor for extra creaminess.

Great starting point, though it all depends on what types of hummus you prefer (what region, etc)... I don't bother with the parsley oil in general, and I've often ground pine nuts into the hummus, which is especially good for the consistency. Cumin is a must, I use more lemon juice (possibly because I squeeze my own from large organic lemons, which aren't very strong compared to bottled stuff), and actually, on top of all that, I also add sumac (though in smalllll amounts) to get the right "kind" of tang for my preferences. I put a bit more salt, too-sea salt, though, which (this variety of, at least) is milder than standard morton kinds. I've also, depending on how it's going to be served, added cayenne pepper to it or added an extra clove of garlic. It has a lot of potential and achieves the right texture, especially when you take the time to do the garlic paste (it helps if you crush the clove into a bowl with a garlic press instead of mincing by hand!) Anyway, definitely a good guideline and base recipe, but as many regions as there are where hummus is a staple, there's a lot of room for customization.

YUM! This is so easy and so yummy. I'm not sure what Newport, RI was talking about with the "peanut butter" comment... maybe confusing peanut and pine nut? But the pine nuts and parsley oil added wonderful balance to this recipe. I thinned with reserved water from the chic peas, so did not add salt. Will definitely make this again!

Oops! One additional comment... I puree the roasted pine nuts with the chick peas. They add a beautiful fullness to the flavor!

Rating: 4
This is by far the best hummus recipe I've found. Ever! The pine nuts and parsley oil are a must in order for this to be enjoyed in its fullest flavor and balance. As others have suggested, I reserve some of the chick pea juice to thin this out at the end instead of water. I also combined earlier suggestions to prepare this in a different order. First I make the parsley oil and transfer it to a small container. Then in the "dirty" processor bowl, I add the cloves of garlic and a bit of salt, whiz them a few times adding about 1 Tbsp of the chick pea juice to help the garlic to become puree. Then the rest of the ingredients go into bowl, puree, and voila. Deliciousness! My family requests it so frequently that I make sure there is always a container of it in the fridge.

This does make a ton; I would halve the recipe next time. Tasty, but needed something -- not sure what -- maybe the parsely oil, which I skipped? Please, only make it with peanut butter if you are POSITIVE no one is allergic to it (don't bring it to a party, in other words); my husband is allergic to peanut butter but likes hummus and would get a really nasty surprise.

Rating: 3
Almost identical to the recipe repeated in Gourmet August 1998 which also appears on this site with fewer reviews and a slightly lower fork rating. (cumin seeds are missing from this one and it does need some cuming flavor) At any rate, both are great hummus recipes (requested often by neighbors)! As indicated by several reviewers- the quality and quantity of the tahini are critical (interested to try peanut butter or sesame seed versions suggested here). Also the amount of garlic is personal as well. This amount raw is a bit much for me and I'm a garlic lover-so I always "cook" it slightly by microwaving in the olive oil (roasted garlic would work well also), it keeps the intensity of garlic, but flavor is a bit more mellow. Parsley oil is definitely optional, but for a party it gives a great look.

A tasty economical recipe... just consider the size of your food processor first. If yours is small, like mine, you will have to work this in batches (or halve the recipe). Next time I may actually cut this in half anyway, it makes a bunch!

I just made this hummus for a dinner at my church for 75 people. Rave reviews. I had at least 25 people ask for the recipe. I halved the tahini and used fewer chickpeas, and left out the nuts, but otherwise followed the recipe and it was fantastic. I will make it again and again.

Awesome! I've made this several times to rave reviews. I don't bother with the parsley oil and pine nuts. It's great without them. I think that mashing the garlic cloves with the salt is one of the secrets to this recipe. It really brings out the garlic flavor, which is, in my mind, the key to a great tasting hummus. I, too, will never buy hummus at the store again!

It was perfect and is very amenable to tweaking to your own liking!! I'll never buy pre-made hummus again!

It's absolutely fantastic... aside from the garlic breath. Yum yum and yum.

I don't use so much olive oil, and use the water from the chick peas like others recommended.

This is so simple and delicious! It is definitely thick. (Started with my small hand blender/chopper and quickly realized it was not going to work.) It is thick even with a little water but it makes you realize just how watered down all the ones you've eaten out or from the store are. Adjust the water to your liking but do try! Took another reviewer's advice and started putting it on sandwiches...yum!

Make this "California Hummus" by blending in canned mild green chiles (with the liquid)and a small amount of jalaoeno (optional, plus fresh cilantro. Addictive! Also, it's fine to substitute a little toasted sesame oil instead of tahini, which lowers the fat significantly, thinning with bean liquid or broth is necessary.

Wow! If you've only just realized that you can make your own hummus after a lifetime of buying it at the store, like me, this recipe might surprise you.

Better than any bought version, and I didn't even bother with the oil/pinenuts! I'll have a can of chickpeas in the cupboard waiting for the next time I have visitors.

This is the best hummus I've ever eaten, and I'm pretty much a hummus junkie. I didn't even bother with the parsley oil and pine nuts, since I just made it for a quick spread on bagels and sandwiches, but it doesn't even need them. Though I will try it at my next party... Only used 2 16 oz cans of beans; I guess that made the other flavors that much richer. Also, I had no problem with it being too thick, it was perfect. I think I'll need breath mints for a week (since I'll be enjoying it all week-it makes a lot), though. It's very garlicky, yum! Also, you can taste the olive oil a lot so spring for a quality one!

As most everyone else has noted, this hummus is very thick. I would recommend (as others did) using less tahini, and increasing the amount of lemon juice. Other than that, I agree that this is a pretty standard (and tasty) hummus recipe, and would definitely make it again. For those of you who can't find tahini, here's a trick: you may substitute 1 tablespoon of creamy peanut butter for the same effect, without influencing the taste! You would never be able to tell - still delicious.

I love hummus, but after adding twice the olive oil recommended in the recipe, this huumus was still an almost solid mass. Since I prefer my hummus creamier and, hmm, "softer" (for lack of a better word), I ended up adding more lemon juice and some water to thin it out a bit. I think I'll look for a different hummus recipe next time.

Good basic hummus recipe. I too added a bit more salt and lemon juice. I used all organic ingredients and my tahini (organic from Whole Foods Store) was pretty thick so I too added water to thin. I didn't find this too oily, but I rinsed & drained my chick peas before processing. Also, I made the parsley oil first in the processor, scraping it fairly clean with a rubber spatula, so didn't have to clean the processor twice! Better made the day before so the flavors meld together...

I usually halve this, and use a bit more garlic and lemon juice. A pit of paprika, maybe a touch of cayenne, and a bit more salt, and it's perfect. Instead of the toasted pita recommended, however, I've found that you can quickly and easily toast whole pita pockets by brushing them with a bit of olive oil and cooking on a George Foreman grill or similar sandwich-press type device. It comes out with lovely, crunchy grill marks just like at my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant. Just cut to bite-size pieces.

Easy and delicious. I usually halve the recipe unless I'm making it for a group because it makes quite a bit.

This is my 12 year-old son's favorite. I don't use parsley and pine nuts either. Also, I use much less olive oil. Tahini has such rich natural oil in it, so you really don't need much more. Like many of the other reviewers, I do thin it with some water to get good consistency. it's very very good!

When something this good is this easy, I wonder why everyone doesn't cook. I added a little cayenne and it was a virtual clone of the stuff I spend BIG BUCKS for at the local health food store.

I halved everything in the recipe, except for the garlic, since other reviewers said recipe made so much, plus since I was trying the recipe for the first time I wanted to go easy the first time around. I roasted the garlic and used 3 large cloves and this was just about right. Next time I will use slightly less tahini and slightly more lemon juice, but basically the recipe is a keeper. One can always modify these few ingredients to suit individual taste. I found that 1/3 cup liquid from the beans was just right to get the right consistency for making half the recipe. I didn't bother with the parsley oil or pine nuts because I wasn't concerned with presentation for this trial run. Also, I didn't want the additional fat grams.

I made the original recipe with the exception of the tahini. I pulvarized unsalted almonds instead and sampled it. I added olive oil, lime juice, cumin, and jalepeno peppers in addition to some of the pepper juice. My husband said that it is the tastiest thing he's ever tried.

Scrumptious, with a few variations along the way. I doubled the garlic and pounded it into the paste as suggested, using the dull size of my chopping knife. Next time I'd double the salt as well -- this recipe required a liberal dosing of salt to bring out the deep, rich flavors optimally. I also added a heaping teaspoon of cumin, and would double that next time as well. I, too, used only one can of beans as my base, but I was glad I had an extra can to work from as well. Having not drained the first can, I found the mixture too liquidy so added a couple handfuls of drained beans from the 2nd can. (I used the rest of the second can of beans to sprinkle liberally over the hummous when it was ready to serve...a nice, crunchy addition.) I also sliced a handful of Kalamata olives to sprinkle on top. While probably not necessary, the addition of the parseley oil and toasted nuts were lovely touches that I definitely would repeat. This made at least a quart of hummous and we've enjoyed it as a dinner and then as a breakfast spread.

This recipe turned out great, but I had to make adjustments. As others have pointed out, it's impossibly thick. In fact, I only used one can of chick-peas. There's no way I'd have fit the second can into my food processor, and it was completely unnecessary. The second important change is that I saved the drained chick-pea liquid, and ended up adding it all back. So next time I won't bother draining the chick-peas. Lastly, I skipped the pine nuts -- only because I didn't have any. Next time if I have pine nuts, I'll add them, but I don't think it will make a difference either way. Don't forget to top your spread with a few kalamata olives.

I haven't tried this recipe. I don't have to!! It is just about identical to my own. I omit the parsley since I don't care for it. Also I like more lemon and garlic- but ALWAYS taste as you are making it and adjust to your own perferences! My family LOVES it

I made hummus for the first time with this recipe, and I like it so much I don't think I'll look any further. I've made it many times since, and it's always a hit. Tasty and easy to make.

We eat Hummus here as most americans eat burgers and this recipe cannot get any closer to the one my grandmother and even her mother made before her. Of course, those of us who like a bit more garlic and less lemon for example, that is a personal choice, that doesn't alter the recipe. I love sun dried tomatoes but it is totally out of the question for this recipe, so please stick to it as it is. It is excellent!!!

Very straight forward, basic hummus recipe. Be careful with the tahini, quality and quantity are fundamental, it can make it or spoil this recipe.

This is virtually identical to the basic hummus recipe I've been playing for years, several times/month. We like extra garlic; roasting takes away the "bite." Hummus has long been on my list of Top 10 Favorite Foods. Cannot get with these new-fangled, low-fat variations popping up on website... rather have a little of the luxe version than an entire bowlful of dry, bland, no-mouth-appeal stuff.

The proportions are excellent and the presentations is beautiful.

Heavenly! Thanks to all for your suggestions (I used dried beans, increased the garlic and lemon juice, added bean juice and put the pine nuts and parsley into the dip). Next time I'm going to try using a favorite ingredient of mine - sun-dried tomatoes.

My first time making hummus and it was a huge success. I omitted the pine nuts (didn't have any) and used more lemon juice than the recipe called for. The beuty of this recipe is it is so easy to tweak based on personal taste.

I just needed to add a bit more olive oil. Very good standard recipe.

Quick and simple and the pine nuts and parsley oil add a nice touch. Received raves.

This is wonderful. I made it according to the recipe several times before I started experimenting by adding roasted eggplant and red peppers. I'll try olives next. This is east and even our Lebonese friends think it's wonderful!

I just made this hummus tonight and it was DEE-lish!! We can't stop eating it. My first time making hummus, too, and I borrowed tweaks from other cooks/reviewers to make it even better. I used roasted garlic I happened to have leftover in the fridge, one and a half heads total, and would even use two whole heads next time. I used only 1/2 c. tahini, juice from TWO whole lemons (we love lemon!), and only 1/4 c. olive oil. I added plenty of fresh black pepper and 1 tsp. cumin (which I borrowed from another hummus recipe on Epicurious). I took a shortcut on the parsley oil and just drizzled a little sesame oil on top and sprinkled chopped fresh mint and then the toasted pine nuts (cliantro or parsley would be yummy, too). Also, my canned garbanzo beans were the 15 ou. size, so they were slightly smaller than the ones called for. It does make a good amount, have lots of pita/naan bread/flat bread, vegies, etc. on hand!

This is wonderful and so easy! I didn't have the pine nuts either. Also, instead of water you can use the (reserved in advance) liquid from the canned chick peas to thin the mix a bit. A keeper for sure!!

I only used half the oil called for to make the hummus (about 2-3 tsp) and added a small amt of the "bean juice" from the canned beans. I also cut the oil in the herb mixture, upped the garlic, and used a few drops of tomato juice for a lower fat version that went like wild fire.

Delicious!! Everyone was impressed.

Wow! A great hummus recipe! Of course, every cook likes to 'improve' a recipe to suit his or her palate, and I did so in the following ways: Instead of making the parsley drizzel, I added the chopped parsley at the end. I used cilantro because it is more fragrant than regular parsley. Also, I roasted a head of garlic instead of adding a few cloves of fresh. The result was delicious! It really complimented the nutty & toasty flavour of the pine nuts (I gently roasted them too!) and the tahini.

Thank you Bridge! I intentionally added the pine nuts to the blend and I do believe I found the best-tasting hummus ever! I leave out the parsley oil. I just make the hummus, put it in the fridge, and eat it as dip or pita wraps for the next several days. Excellent nutty taste!

This hummus was delicious even though I forgot to add the parsley.

This actually took me a while to make, my food processor was acting up, but I would definately do it again. I accidentally blended the pine nuts into the hummus and it was fantastic. I made the toasted pita chips to accompany. This dish was a hit! Everyone said they had never had such good hummus before!

This was so easy to make. I did not however make the parsley oil for the drizzle, and I actually tossed a few of the toasted pine nuts into the hummus and blended them in for a little depth.
