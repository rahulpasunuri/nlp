This was delicious -- a new family favorite. I ended up with 2:1 cauliflower to potatoes, which worked well. I used Comte (like Gruyere) in the potato gratin and parmesan with the cauliflower. I also sprinkled some breadcrumbs over the top for a crunchier crust. My 6-year-old asked for 3rds!

Very simple recipe, came out beautifully. I used 2% instead of whole milk and mixed in a couple drizzles of white truffle oil just before topping with the Parmesan and baking. I used fontina instead of the Gruyere because I prefer the creaminess. Served this at a dinner party with some stuffed chicken, it was a hit!

Very flavourable twist on traditional mashed potatoes. Will definitely make again.

Was looking for a different potato recipe for a family gathering. Decided to give this a try but also made the traditional mashed potatoes as well. Much to my surprise this dish went first! Didn't have the Parmesan but the smoked Gruyere gave it a nice silky flavor.
