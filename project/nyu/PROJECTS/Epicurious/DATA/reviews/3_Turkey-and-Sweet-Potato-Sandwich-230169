This was a good, quick meal, but nothing special. Great way to use Thanksgiving leftovers when you have only a few minutes to prep a meal.

This sandwich was fantastic - everything about it was amazing and to be honest I am not a huge turkey fan. This sandwich will definitely become a tradition in our home. Mmmmm mmmmm!

wow, I thought I was the only one who liked the sweet potatoes on my leftover turkey sandwich. Even if you use thanksgiving leftovers, the sage is still important as the flavor of it takes the place of the stuffing without adding calories. If not using leftovers, and the idea of canned turkey gravy horrifies you, make your own with Better than Bullion- Turkey paste, water and cornstarch. Use a little less paste than the label recommends as it is a bit salty and peppery.
