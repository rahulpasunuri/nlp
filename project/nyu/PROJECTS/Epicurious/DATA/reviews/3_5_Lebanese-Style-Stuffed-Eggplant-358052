I did as the others as added the chopped eggplant to the sauce, and added 1 tsp of Cumin and an add'l 1/2 tsp of Allspice. It could have probably standed another 1 tsp of Cumin (i.e. 2 tsp). You definitely need ALL of 2 cups of stock. I only made 4 stuffed baby eggplants and my sauce really thickened up in a dutch oven on the stove- I had to actually add another 1/2 cup of stock and another can of stewed tomatoes mid-way through bc. I didn't have enough reduced sauce.

I also tweak this good recipe to improve it. I add some 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin and 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon to the allspice and a sprinkling of Aleppo pepper (cross between the taste of paprika and ground chili. I used cooked rice.

Needs tweaking if you are looking for robust flavors. Use cooked rice. Reduce oil by half. Add another 1/2 tsp. of allspice and 1 tsp dried oregano to the meat mixture; also add the lemon and parsley directly to the meat. As others did, dice the scooped out eggplant and add to the sauce. Increase the garlic. Puree the sauce. Pecans and currants are a nice substitute for pine nuts. Ground chuck worked well. 2 medium eggplant are easy to work with. Pour the sauce over the stuffed eggplant and bake at 350 F. The end result was very flavorful and got enthusiastic responses.

Not as good as I thought it would taste. Possibly it was the lamb; the brand I purchased had a very strong flavor unlike some lamb I've had before. Otherwise it was fine. I had very small baby eggplants which didn't hold a lot of filling but they worked ok.

The reviews were so good I expected this to be 4 forks. Only change was to use tomato sauce (which I had on hand) instead of diced tomatoes. I felt the recipe was bland and the rice was overcooked even though I only cooked 50 minutes. I ended up adding some hot sauce for flavor.

This recipe was delicious! It definitely took a while to make, but the end result was well-worth it. If I were to make it again, I'd add more seasoning to the meat mixture (cumin especially). We only used 4 baby eggplants and that was perfectly fine. We paired it with the Farro and Pine Nut Tabbouleh recipe from this site. This is definitely a keeper!

This recipe is very good. I have had a few different versions of this in Lebanon and decided to make some adjustments to this recipe to see how it would turn out. First I hallowed 2 medium sized aubergines (chopped up what was removed to add to the sauce later), sprinkled the insides with sea salt and placed them in a 350 degree oven for a few minutes. After they have softened in the oven, I rinse them in cold water then lay on a cutting board (open side down) to drain. I used 1 onion, but 2 extra cloves of garlic (Lebanese love garlic!), and used double the amount of pine nuts. I used ground turkey, and added 2 tsp cumin to the stuffing mixture. I added the chopped up aubergine to the sauce, and let that simmer for about 25 minutes before adding the eggplants. These turned out absolutely delicious!

This was good with ground beef and would probably be great with lamb. I made it with medium size eggplants cut in half and scooped out. Put the chopped up pulp into the tomato sauce to cook. But, I have a few issues with technique. Fry the pine nuts on medium low and and stir constantly, taking them out before they are done because the heat of the oil will continue to cook them. Four tablespoons of olive oil in a non stick pan is too much. Two cups of chicken stock is too much. I cut it in half.

This was easy and delicious. I didn't have a melon baller, so I used a spoon, and baby eggplant are out of season, so I used small-sized regular eggplant and made the fleshy part a little thinner (about 1/4 inch). I highly recommend this recipe.
