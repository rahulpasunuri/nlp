Made this for Valentine's Day and it came out great. The shrimp and spice combo worked really well. I used the broiler instead of a grill (hello, midwinter?)... Had a lot of sauce left over and plan to use it again tomorrow over halibut or salmon. Will probably use spicier chillies when I make it again.

This sauce is excellent as a marinade for steak. The quality does depend on the chilis. The taste is smoky and flavorful, unlike any other sauce I know, and not hot. Goes really well with zinfandel.

This dish was very good, I would probably make it again. The flavor was different, and it really came together with all the accompaniments. I served with garlic rice.

This was a simplified and delicious take on traditional adobo. The sauce is supposed to be rich and flavorful, not spicy. This version worked for me. The first time I made it, nicer dried chiles were available. You can definitely notice the difference. The flavors of the shrimp, adobo and avocado are awesome - definitely one to make if you want to impress. Yum, yum yum...

It wasn't spicy because it wasn't supposed to be. Neither ancho nor pasilla chiles are very hot. I think that the oil is gratuitous in this recipe..no reason for it to be there. I would add more garlic and cook the sauce thoroughly before serving it.

This was not as spicy as I expected and it was only okay. Would try something new rather than making it again.

Along with the shrimp I roasted a couple red peppers, a big sweet onion, and some jalapenos on the grill. We ate this with corn tortillas, rice, beans and loved it.

excellant on the BBQ, servered with grilled pineapple with tequila/brown sugar glaze and mixed green salad with vinegarette. Taste bud delight.
