I made this for my family's superbowl viewing. A lot of ingredient prep, so this isn't a quick sandwich that you can throw together. Instead of drizzling the tahini mix, I sort of painted it on the layers with a spatula. I did not cut the finished sandwich before wrapping, and I think that made it easier to cut when we were ready to eat. The sandwich was not soggy at all. Delicious mix of flavors. Served with homemade potato and bean salads.

Amazing sandwich! I've had this recipe for years and just now tried it... and can't make it enough. Great for a easy dinner with soup, brunch or shower! Delicious-

Excellent, probably the best roast beef sandwich I've ever made! Couldn't wait 2+ hrs to let it develop, but I can imagine it would get even better!

This sandwich is outrageous. I ducked the sogginess issue by mashing the feta cheese into a paste with about a tablespoon of soft butter, and spreading the bread with the feta mixture before I assembled the other ingredients. The cheese/grease emulsion prevented sogginess perfectly; I recommend this technique. Soggy or not, the flavors simply cannot be beat. This recipe is perfect. Make it and bask in praise.

Awesome! Served with Saada's Tabbouleh and baklava for dessert. Didn't add as much hot pepper sauce because of guest's tastes. If I make again I would probably make red pepper relish and tahini sauce the day before because the flavor got better the longer it sat. I served these right after they were assembled, so there was no refrigerator time. I also did not layer them as specified, though they did get soggy quickly and my layering job could be the reason. All in all a wonderful recipe, though like I said in the future I would make the relish and sauce ahead of time.

This sandwich is fantastic. My husband took it to a work event and now his cowokers are jealous of the incredible food his very talented wife makes...shhh. I was concerned about the soggyness factor so I didn't add all the water to the tahini mixture. It seemed to work. Hubby was able to save a piece from the grips of the savage coworks so I could have it for lunch the following day and it was still great...not soggy! I will definately make this for future picnics and parties and have already passed it on to some friends. Yummy!

Won't make this again because of the response of my husband. I found the flavor to be okay. Onions, bell peppers, feta, very good combination if one likes Greek food, which I do. But there is no way you could wrap up this sandwich and leave it in the refrig for a whole day. It was so soggy after an hour, that I changed my cooking process. It was so moist, that I cooked the sandwich like a grilled cheese sandwich. I let the sandwich sit in the frig, wrapped in plastic, for about two hours. I removed them, found them very soggy and let them sit out for about an hour, on a rack to dry the bread out a little. Then "grilled" them in the frying pan. I had to do something to save the "Black Angus" roast beef that I paid over $6.00 a pound for. Asked the hubby if I shoudl make this again, and he said no.

I made this last summer and my whole family thought it was excellent. I used ciabatta bread and assembled the sandwiches several hours in advance. The bread never got soggy and the flavors just intensified over time. Even the next day, when most sandwiches would be a wet sponge, these where still great!

I don't think I would make this again, but if I did, I would: 1) cut all ingredients in half - the sandwich was too big to comfortably eat 2) only put in the fridge for the minimum of 2 hrs - I did the 1 day thing and the bread got a bit soggy. The flavor was good, but just not anything I would get a craving for in the future.

I made this to bring to a friend's house for a light brunch, and it was out of this world. I used a nice, fresh ciabatta. At first I thought the spices were too strong, but they did, as another poster indicated, blend well after sitting together for a while. This is on my list to make again and again!

Yummy, says my 12 year old; 'sabrosisimo' says DH. It doesn't get any better than this. I did make some tex mex tweaks: made the parmesan and thyme focaccia found on this site (substituted asiago for the parmesan); charred the skin off of a fresh red bell pepper; used queso fresco instead of the feta; left over carne asada instead of roast beef; and lime juice instead of lemon. DH and I also topped it off with a really spicy tomatillo salsa (my own recipe). If I ever have leftover feta or roast beef, I will definitely try that out too. Excellent recipe!!!

I made these sandwiches for a lunch party and they went over very well. The focaccia was a "grocery store" baked bread and was too absorbant. This made the bread on the bottom a little soggy so I strongly recommend using a good quality traditional ciabatta and/or focaccia. I made these the night before and the "bakery" bread held up to the moisture very well.

I thought the ingredients seemed a bit overpowering at first, but after chilling the sandwiches for six hours, the flavors blended really well. You might need a fork and knife to eat these, but they're worth it! Very flavorful and satisfying.
