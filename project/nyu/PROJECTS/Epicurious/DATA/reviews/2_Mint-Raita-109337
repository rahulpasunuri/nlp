This is pretty bland. I know raita is not intended to have complex flavors, but the Cucumber-Mint Raita recipe on Epicurious is much better.

Why use a recipe? Why wait 6 hours? I've done basically this for years. I chop fine some mint leaves, mix with Greek yoghurt (available at Trader Joes, Whole Foods, etc.) or any plain yoghurt - whole, low-fat, fat-free, whatever, and add a bit of lemon or lime juice, whatever is on hand. I like it sweet, so I add a bit of honey, too. If I don't have fresh mint, I've even used dried. I make this whenever my mom makes a lamb roast because I always want a sauce for everything! I whip this up after the roast comes out of the oven, while it rests. You can make just what you need.

Based on the mixed reviews, I made the minted cucumber raita instead and it was great.

This is an excellent accompaniment to the chicken tikka recipe. We made it with just one cup of low fat yogurt - all that was available to us.

not too exciting. maybe a little lime juice would zip it up. decent accompaniment to the chicken tikka, but not as good as the chutney.
