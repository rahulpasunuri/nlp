My family has been making this for Easter w/ the Bonless Leg Of Lamb Stuffed w/ Swiss Chard & Feta recipe it appeared w/ since '92. LOVE it! Don't miss out on the Quinoa Timbales!

This was an interesting recipe. I thought the sauce could have been tastier.

This is a knock 'em dead recipe. Having lost my 'hard' copy, I was concerned that a truly great recipe had slipped through my fingers, until I found it again on the website. Now I can relax

I have made this several times as a starter course when company is coming, and have always received rave reviews! Not as much work as appears in recipe.
