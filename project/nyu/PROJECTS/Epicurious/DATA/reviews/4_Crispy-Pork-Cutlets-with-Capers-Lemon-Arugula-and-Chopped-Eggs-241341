Made this with wild boar cutlets and it was the best wild boar we have ever tasted, all the herbs and the arugula with egg was the perfect combination. I have a family of 6 and it pleased everyone.

Made half of this recipe tonight. My husband and I loved it! The whole recipe would probably serve 8. I used dried herbs b/c was too lazy to go in the yard and cut fresh ones. Lots of flavor in every bite!

My husband and I love this recipe, we've made it several times. We double the amount of herbs as the first time we made it, it just didn't seem like enough. Also, you could skip the lemon steps and just squeeze lemon juice over the cutlets. However, if you're going for presentation, the lemon wedges certainly add to the overall appearance.

Excellent cutlet recipe that I've been making for 2 years. The technique for breading the cutlets and letting them sit in the fridge is no-fail. Only alteration I make is to double the amount of sage.

Great. Simple and tasty. Didn't have bread, so used panko. Used lemon juice at the end instead of pieces of lemon. Served with orzo (w/ chickpeas, lemon, oregano and goat cheese). Will make this regularly.

I made a sandwich version of this for a picnic which turned out great. You can see a photo at: http://www.salmoncabin.com/2008/10/end-of-summer-picnic.html

I didn't do the complicated lemon (just served it with slices of lemons). Also used italian style breadcrumbs. Overall very flavorful! Served it with a small side of pasta.

Fabulous! We also used thin cut pork cutlets from the grocer, so we didn't have to do any meat pounding and they came out great. I agree with the other reviewer: next time we'll use more fresh herbs - we used more than recommended and could barely detect them. Surgical dissection of a lemon isn't our idea of fun, so we just squeezed lemon over the top and it was great! We plated the cutlets over mixed greens with arugula and added chopped tomatoes and cucumbers for a great healthy meal!

I loved this dish. Made for my wife and family and everyone ate everyting on their plate. The second time i was in a time crunch, so i only cut the pork tenderloin into medallions without pounding them out and made a spinach salad with sliced red onions. The arugula was still my fave but the red onion with the spinach made up for it.

I made this tonight with one substitution. I used chopped romaine instead of arugula. I think that the arugula would have added a spiciness that was missing with the romaine. I would skip the peeled lemons next time and simply squeeze lemon juice over the warm chops before layering with other ingredients. Overall, we liked it and the presentation was nice.

Fantastic. Served with risotto and peperonata on goat cheese toasts. Reheats well in the oven.

Wonderful meal, used pre-breaded pork loin cutlets, redipped them in egg, then panko crumbs and they were amazing, only had red leaf lettuce, so the flavour of the arugula was missing, and the capers were also not around, but it was all very very good, served with a side of couscous. I don't think we changed the recipe too much and it was a quick impressive economical plate.

Wow! A+ for presentation, A+ for taste! Loved the different tastes - the lemons, the arugula, the chopped eggs. Only difference was that I used thin cut boneless loin chops because my supermarket only had pork tenderloins that had been pre- marinated in godonlyknows what chemicals. What a great dish, and you can do everything ahead of time, and then quickly saute the pork at the last minute & pile on the salad stuff.

MADE THIS FOR MY HONEY AND WE BOTH LOVED IT. SERVED WITH BAKED ORZO WITH FONTINA & PEAS. THIS IS A KEEPER FOR SURE.

Took a little time to bread the cutlets, but well worth it. Awesome! Will definitely make this again. I did not serve on salad, but with couscous, excellent!

This recipe was so good! My husband and I both raved. I didn't have/buy arugula so I used mixed greens and that worked great. Amazingly the egg really adds to the overall result.I served this with Almond Rice.

There wasn't a person at the table who didn't love this recipe. The arugula salad was a great flavor contrast to the seasonings in the pork, and the eggs provided a creamy texture as well as a bright color contrast. Excellent!

This is easy and tasty. Since I was cooking for only two, rather than start with a whole tenderloin, I used a thick cut boneless chop that I split through the middle. In the future think I would season the meat separately from applying the chopped herbs to make it easier to see how much salt each piece is getting. I found it ended up a bit under seasoned as written. I'm a sauce lover, so next time I think I'll make a little lemon-brown butter or something to spoon over.
