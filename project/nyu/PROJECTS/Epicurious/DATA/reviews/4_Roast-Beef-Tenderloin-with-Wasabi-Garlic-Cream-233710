This was the best beef I have ever made! I think I may have reduced the sauce a little mire than intended, but it only intensifed the flavor so I didn't have the same issues other reviewers mentioned.

Excellent. I took another reviewer's advice and marinated the beef in soy sauce and ginger overnight. I cooked the roast at 400 degrees and took it out when the internal temp reached 125. The sauce was excellent - but I doubled the wasabi. I will definitely make this again.

This was excellent. Tasting the cream sauce by its self had me a bit worried. But the completed dish was really enjoyable. The only thing I'd do differently is add more wasabi; perhaps even double it. The sweetness from the cream reduction takes almost all of the bite from the wasabi.

Will not be making this again, what a disappointment. The wasabi/garlic cream sauce was a terrible blend with a great piece of meat.

Raves from me guests. Roasted at 400 degrees to 120 internal temp. Rest for 10 minutes and then sliced. Made small sandwiches for my guests. Everyone wanted the recipe. This is a keeper for sure.

Did I miss it? What temperature do you roast the meat?

This is my favorite recipe on this website!!

This was not nearly as interesting as anticipated. The sauce was just O.K. and the rest was, well, just tenderloin.

I will agree about the need for more wasabi but that's if you want it to have a kick not just a whiff of it. It was indeed the easiest roast I've done. Minimal prep and all the taste. We had it for a cocktail party. I just sliced it thinly and had the sauce as a dip. It was wolfed down in no time! Nice one. I will make it again.

Oh my golly. This was one of the easiest and most flavorful roasts I've ever cooked. Fixed it for Christmas dinner and it was amazing. I did increase the wasabi to 2 tablespoons.

I served this on Christmas and it was a hit. I cut the tenderlion in half, tied it, then seared it before rubbing it with the oil. It cooked much quicker than I thought. So watch the thermometer, not the clock. I caught it just in time! I'll make again!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner last evening and it was fabulous! All the guests raved over it, including the children. I did use 2 Tablespoons of wasabi and it had a bite but not overwhelming at all. Also instead of using olive oil on the tenderloin, I chose to marinate it for 5 hours in 1/2 cup soy sauce and sliced ginger. Placed it in a baking dish and poured marinade over meat, sprinkled lightly with sugar and salt, then roasted. I wish I could afford to eat this once a week! To complete the meal I stir-fried whole green beans in sesame oil, and a cucumber, mango, avocado salad that everyone wanted seconds of as well.

While the sauce is a good pairing with the meat, I made it far ahead of time and I found the wasabi became more and more bitter as serving time approached. I would recommend holding the sauce without the wasabi paste until just before service.

My guests loved this dish. I agree with the others that the wasabi should be doubled.

Using 1 1/2 ounces or a tube of S&B Wasabi paste, I made the sauce that was well balanced and strong enough without being overwhelming. The tenderloin part was great, too. My 2 year old even loved it, sauce and all!

This was a wonderful and easy Christmas dinner.

Very, very good and easy to prepare. I agree about using more wasabi than called for. I used wasabi powder from a jar, which you mix with water to make a paste. After making sauce and realizing how mild it was, I threw some powder in directly and it was a little lumpy, so I would definitely use a paste. The times/temps given resulted in a perfect medium rare.

I found that I had to add 3x the amount of Wasabi than the recipe called for. Wonder if using wasabi powder gives it a stronger flavor than the wasabi paste? Flavor is nice with the roast. Great sauce for pasta as well. Pair with a good riesling.

Made a cheaper version of this one night, and my guests couldn't stop helping themselves to more! For those of you on a budget (like me), I bought a nice large piece of top sirloin, shaped and tied it, and it worked great. I agree with the previous reviewer that said more wasabi would be welcome.

I served this to a group of friends and everyone at the table LOVED it! It was simple and tasty and I would highly recommend trying it.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving this year and it received rave reviews. I don't think we are ever going back to turkey. It is a low maintenance dish with great results. You can vary the amount of wasabi or garlic to your own taste. I added a little more than the tablespoon of wasabi called for in the recipe, and it still wasn't very pronounced. So if that is what drew you to the dish, I would say add a couple of tablespoons.

Made this as the centerpiece of my mother's day feast. I loved it. Really simple to prepare. For my own preference I would add a lot more wasabi, but the more predominant garlic flavor was definitely more in line with my family's taste. I served the roast with roasted potatoes and the cream was equally delicious on both.

This was a fabulous recipe and a great twist to a tasty cut of meat. The wasabi sauce added something different to a traditional tenderloin! My fiance loves this recipe!!

We absolutely loved this recipe. My boyfriend could not get enough of the wasabi garlic sauce. Minor tweaks - added twice as much wasabi for more flavor, braised roastbeef with sesame oil & white rice wine for added flavor & sweetness. Served with boiled red potatoes and mesculin salad. Tasty!

This was a fantastic recipe. The sauce was different and very special. I especially appreciated how quick and easy it was to prepare.

I made this for some friends and it was a hit! I chose the Thai green curry option b/c I happened to have some in my fridge and 3/4 tsp was perfect if you like medium to spicy food. The cilantro is a must. Once the sauce was poured over the meat it didn't seem so spicy, either, so don't be bashful about the green curry. I served this with the Winter Salad with Hoisin Vinaigrette and just a boxed Thai rice I found at my grocery store - Thai Kitchen's Green Chili Garlic Jasmine rice. It was one of the best meals I think I've ever made.

We really enjoyed this - it was great to have a different sauce to accompany the beef instead of bearnaise or horseradish, etc. I used about 3 times the amount of wasabi to achieve a mild wasabi flavor. Not sure why, but I am pleased with the results regardless. I think this would work for people who are a little shy about tasting wasabi, for fear of the heat. There was no heat, just lovely pungent flavor.

Wondrful taste. Easy and impressive on guests. I let the sauce sit for an hour and it took on a better taste - served it as a cold dolop on the hot meat slice. I suspect that one could let it sit longer as well.Also added more wasabi.
