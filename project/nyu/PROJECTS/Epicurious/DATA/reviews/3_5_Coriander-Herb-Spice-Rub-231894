Our neighbor, Bob, used this rub on a beef tenderloin at Christmas. It complemented the beef flavor and got rave reviews.

This rub worked great on three meals this week from this one recipe, filet mignon, chicken breast and pork chops.

I dry rubbed this on some lamb chops and grilled on the BBQ for 3-min a side on high heat. Delicious! Even my kids gave it a try, and liked it enough to ask for more! I had taken half the batch, and added 1 tblsp of Curry Powder (Indian) and it was very tasty too. I think next time, I would only use 1 tblsp of curry powder for the whole batch (half strength). Both version were very savory on the lamb!

Rubbed this on a porterhouse about an hour before grilling it. Will do that again, very tasty.

I didn't have whole coriander seeds, so I just used ground coriander. Maybe I missed out on the "toasted" flavor, but I still thought this was a great rub! I used it on some grilled prime steaks. The grilling brought out all the wonderful flavors. Will definitely use it again.

This is very tasty! I didn't even feel the need to use steak sauce... and I ALWAYS use A1. One thing, though. I would recommend reducing the amount of kosher salt to 3/4 Tablespoon, maybe less, but that's my preference. Other than that, this rub is definitely worth a try.
