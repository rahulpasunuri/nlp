Great recipe although I only used ground beef because that's all I had on hand. I was puzzled by the high temperature to cook this dish but once it came out of the oven I understood that this is what makes the meatloaf so crispy good. Served with my homemade salsa. Can wait for tomorrow's meatloaf sandwich. Yum!

advice more than a review. Just bought a "double" meatloaf pan so the fat flows down thru holes in the inner (of 2) trays. Puree sweet baby carrots for additional moisture.

Great recipe. Try topping (last 5 mins of cooking) with 50-50 catsup and Makers Mark Gourmet Sauce. Not a sauce to cook with. I have also used carrots, onion, seasoned bread crumbs, and garlic in a processor in place of oats.

Having read other reviewers' comments about dryness, I added 2 eggs (I tripled the recipe for 6) - it was satisfying moist. However, I thought this was neither "fish nor fowl", i.e., it really wasn't Swedish meatballs in a loaf form, nor was it that wonderful a "traditional" meatloaf (the mustard was a nice touch and the sauce worked okay).

I was afraid this meat loaf might be dry from the reviews I did the following: equal parts of veal, pork and beef,stale italian bread crumbs made from day old bread (not quite 2/3 cup) and before baking I shook Worshire Sauce all over meat loaf. It was great! I'd make it again

I agree with some of the other reviewers that this meatloaf was a little dry. I did not follow the recipe exactly which may have been the cause. I used whole wheat bread and added caraway seeds to make the breadcrumbs like rye. I also had more ground beef than pork. In any event, we loved it and would definitely make it again.

I agree with some other reviewers: I like my meatloaf moist and juicy. This recipe, although unique in ingredients, creates a very dry meatloaf. I think the sauce would be better with lamb or a falafel.

I thought this was really just okay. Sauce was good, but the meat loaves were pretty dry. We really like meat loaf and I'm always looking for new recipes. Although different in ingredients, I'd suggest Southwestern Salisbury Steaks with Pickled Red Onions from Bon Appetit instead. Much better. Won't make this again.

My husband and I loved this dish! We thought that the dill made the "old meat loaf" very 2001!! We also made it with carrots and creamed spinach as suggested - beautiful colors and flavors together!! We will definately make this again! Yummy!

Super good and easy to make. I didn't have rye bread, so I used regular bread crumbs. (I think 2/3 cup is a bit too much.) I served the meat loaf with the dill sauce, creamed spinach and steamed carrots as suggested and my husband and I really enjoyed this as a mid-week dinner combo.

Very tasty and easy. I substituted ground turkey for the pork and increased the amount of mustard and dill for extra flavor. This one received rave reviews and it changed my mind about meat loaf being boring.

This recipe is easy and delicious. We were not big fans of meatloaf before, but with this recipe we really enjoy it. I have made it several times and it never gets boring.

This was very very very nice and incredibly simple to make. I doubled the recipe for the three of us and had enough leftover to eat for lunch at work! And the flavor of the leftover was just as nice as fresh cooked! The small size of each 'loaf' was perfect as the time for cooking was decreased, a great recipe if you need to whip something up during the week. I've passed this one on to lots of others already. Yum Yum Yum!
