I made this for Thanksgiving dinner yesterday and it was fantastic! I used a Kosher 13 pound turkey and about 5 yellow onions. The carmelized onions made the whole house smell wonderful and the gravy was delicious. I am gluten intollerant, so I used corn starch instead of flour in the gravy, and I used dry sherry, as some other reviewers suggested. I did love the gravy, but next time I will make it with dry white wine, as the recipie directs, because I think I would like that flavor even better. This was a great recipie! Thank you!

I am working on this right now, at my husband' daughter's house;All reviews considered made me want to make it...now, about the reviewer who had problems with burned onions-if you DO NOT have a good, heavy roasting pan, I suggest roasting the onions separately with the neck pieces, etc. I am using one of those flimsy "one time use" pans, and saw a problem within the first 15 minutes of the onions roasting. They are now in a glass pan along side the turkey, so I can pull them at the best time

Although this is the ONLY turkey recipe I'll now use, I find the times are a little outdated for 2007. 2 times I have had the turkey done approx 1 hour before the receipe indicates. Due to onion-phobic family, I strain my gravy so there is no 'bits' in it. The flavour in the gravy alone makes this the best turkey ever.

This was the best Thanksgiving dish I have ever made. My fiancé and I announced our engagement over this meal and I am pretty sure had the food not been superb I would not be a part of the family. His sisters and parents are still talking about what a great cook I am. I did make a mistake and added an entire stick of butter to the bird. I read a half pound instead of a half cup. The turkey was soft and melted in your mouth!

This recipe alone doesn't do it for me but... my four fork changes: 1. Brine the turkey the night before (a must!) 2. Melt butter with fresh chopped sage and rosemary. Rub all over turkey under skin before roasting (and brush during). 3. Add a bit of sugar to the onions pror to caramelizing. 4. Add 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar to gravy. Use more flour/cornstarch to thicken. Makes a delicious turkey (I've used this for a couple Thanksgivings now) -- my friends raved!

Excellent recipe. We are not huge turkey fans so I substituted two 8 pound roasting hens for the turkey made a compound butter of the fresh sage and a good portion of dried thyme, rubbed it under the breast and followed the other cooking directions adjusting the cooking time for the chicken. After measuring and degreasing the onion mixture I pureed it with my stick blender before adding it to the roux mixture. The results were heavenly. This will now be my go to recipe for roast chicken. might even try it with turkey. Definitely the hit of our Thankdgiving feast.

You will love this gravy! My husband always makes me save any little bits for him later - if anything is left! I like a dry sherry as the wine; nice flavor. Will win you wonderful reviews!

This is my standard recipe for turkey anymore. My husband makes me save ANY extra for him to snack on later, including gravy! I like using a nice sherry for the gravy - it really adds a nice flavor. A very impressive dish!

This was my first turkey, but it turned out great! I doubled the sage, chopped it coarsely. I decided to try a combination several of the cooking methods in prior comments - for the first hour, I had the breasts and wings wrapped tightly in foil. Then, I panicked and took the foil off, and turned the bird upside down so the white meat would soak up the liquid, and tented the foil over the whole thing. That lasted an hour, then I decided that I would like the skin to be edible so I turned it right-side up, and let it roast freely for the remainder of the cooking time. Wow, it was perfect. Juiciest turkey I've ever had. The sage flavor was subtle, certainly noticeable and good. Also, I didn't have enough drippings/broth to make up the 5 cups for gravy, so I added a little milk. I also had to sprinkle in a little flour (about a Tbsp) while I was whisking it, because it wasn't thickening. Wow it was so good. I'm going to get a very big turkey next year and double the gravy.

Just one question: do you really put the turkey right on top of the onions, or put the turkey on a roasting rack, above the onions in the pan?

I've made this many times, always to great reviews. The only thing I do differently is to chop the sage and mix it with the butter before rubbing it under the skin of the breast and thighs of the turkey. The gravy is to die for.

I made this for a Sunday dinner. Excellent!! The gravy was out of this world. I pureed half of the onion misture. The gravy had a dark, rich color. Definitely a winner with my husband. I used regular chicken bouillon for the broth and ommitted salting the turkey. But it could have used a little more salt for flavor. I added potatoes during the last hour of roasting. For the vegtable, I sauteed an onion with some chopped fresh sage and added a can of peas to that.

I made this last thanksgiving, and I messed up the stuffing, the mashed potatoes were hard and the soup was bland, but this saved the day! The gravy is insane!!! Enjoy!

I love this method of roasting the turkey and use the same method for roast chicken. Everyone loves the gravy and I have passed the recipe on to rave reviews.

I started making this recipe the year that it was on the cover of the magazine. It got raves from everyone; they particularly loved the gravy. I just went to get out my magazine; couldn't find it and panicked!!!!! Then came on line and found it; thank heavens!!

Best roast turkey I've ever made. Followed the recipe exactly, but more sage wouldn't hurt. (Also, used a fresh turkey, and brined it the night before.)This is the one I'm keeping in the file!

Great Gravy, I added mushroom to mine. I put a ton of butter and all kinds of herbs under the skin not just sage. I'd definitely use this recipe again or with chicken.

This recipe has made my family think I am a great chef. It has become MUST HAVE every thanksgiving. I get better results if I tightly cover the breast with tin foil instead of tenting the entire bird. Definately add extra sage.

I've made this several times and it is always a crowd pleaser. I agree with comments about using more sage, it flavors the meat well and makes for a dramatic prentation.

This is now my Thanksgiving turkey, every year. The only change I make is I stuff twice as many sage leaves under the skin. The gravy is the best part.

A nice, traditional turkey and gravy. The wine and onions in the gravy give it depth and a lot of taste.

I made this recipe with a 21 pound turkey and I was surprised at how quickly it cooked. I didn't think the turkey had a sage taste to it. However, the gravy was delicious. I had never made a turkey or gravy before so this was a great recipe to follow.

Fabulous flavors but I really messed up somewhere along the line and the gravy was just onions. Im sure this should have gone though the food processor/ or onions drained away at some point but it did occur to me until serving and then it was just too late. So we had chunky dressing but it was delicious!

Great recipe! I prepare a 20 lb turkey with only a few changes. I doubled the onions and only roasted them for about 40 minutes. I also put extra sage leaves on the breast and added a tablespoon or so of rubbed sage to the gravy- The gravy was excellent- the onions dissolved almost completely.

This turkey was delicious. I prepared a 20-lb turkey and made sure to rub butter and sage both on and under the skin. I then basted, alternating with white wine and chicken broth. The turkey came out moist and full of flavor. The big winner though was the gravy--only slightly sagey but had wonderful tones of carmelized onion and wine.

This recipe is an interesting concept, but I think I'll try another recipe next year. Dad asked if the turkey had a disease when he started to carve the breast. No particular sage flavor in the meat. Gravy was good, but the onion haters in the family refused to have any. A final whine...there's a lot of fat in the pan in the end, and the onions clogged my gravy separator.

I have made this recipe two thanksgivings in a row. Excellent both times (despite my mistakes...)

This Turkey was a hit last year, at two different dinners. I made it and so did my Aunt. Absolutely delicious, moist ..and easy to make ! ..cant ask for more;)

This was the first turkey I ever cooked, but I made a few modifcations. I rubbed sage, onion powder, parsley, and garlic powder onto the outside skin of the turkey as well as putting the sage leaves under the skin, and I put more sage and herbs into the cavity (unstuffed); still, I agree with the reviewer who said it was not particularly sage-y. I tented the turkey with cheesecloth instead of foil because you can baste right through it, and I basted throughout the roasting process; at first I used a 6-cup mixture of chicken broth, red wine, and white wine to baste, then I basted with pan juices near the end. The white meat was slightly dry, but perhaps not so much as in other turkeys I've had. Adding all the wine when basting made me not have to add any broth to the gravy, and it did make a super gravy; there was extremely little fat to skim off and the final result was good. Still, though it smelled good and the gravy was terrific, I was disappointed by the lack of a pronounced sage flavor or overly moist white meat. I would make the gravy again but might change the turkey seasonings.

Maybe I missed something. Sara obviously had success with the recipe. I didn't. I didn't think the meat had a particulrly sagey flavor. But most disapointing of all were the onions. I followed the recipe to the letter but some of the onions burned. (I did check the oven temp). When I made the gravy, the bitterness of the burned onions was quite pronounced. I usually cook my turkey breast side down for the same reasons Sara mentioned. I didn't this time though and when the thigh got to 180 degrees, I thought the meat was a bit too dry. I like the concept though and I will try it again with some modifications.

Unbelievably delicious! I suggest cutting the leg/thigh off of the turkey and roast it with the rest, unstuffed, and breast side down. This allows both sections to be finished at the same time and the juices run down INTO the breast (also cooks much quicker). The caramelized onions brown the breast nicely, and Jim is absolutely right - it does make the best gravy ever!
