These are fantastic! I use sliced almonds, and make them stove-top rather than in the oven. Add the almonds to the oil, stir over medium heat for a few minutes, and then add the sugar, salt, and pepper. Stir a few more minutes and they are done. Great on the salad, and great to eat out of hand. A keeper recipe.

This was very good, but I changed the preparation a little. First of all, I used regular natural almonds, not blanched. Secondly, I put the almonds in a 9 x 9 pan (an 8 x 8 would work, too) and sprayed them with a store-brand "Pam." After that, I tossed the nuts in a bowl with the pepper, salt, and sugar to coat. Put them back into the pan and followed the advice to cook them at 350 for about 6-7 minutes. Delicious!

Definatly not as good as the black pepper almonds from bon appetite july 1997. The flavour is alot more pronounced.

Ok, what did I do wrong? I bought blanched almonds and followed the recipe to the letter, but the almonds were soft and not very crisp as I expected. Also, separating the almonds did not keep them from sheeting together when the sugar syrup remelted in the oven. I ended up with a sort of peppered almond brittle. ???

I make this salad for EVERYONE! When I am visiting, I tell them I will make the salad! It is SO easy! And, I 'toast' the almonds in a skillet on the cooktop. So much easier! And I also use Brianna's Blush Salad Dressing.

These make a great snack nut. I used splenda instead of the sugar--worked quite well. I never would have expected pepper to go so well on almonds.

Fabulous! They take about half the toasting time. Watch them carefully. Be sure not to under cook either.

If you cook the almonds at this temperature and for this time you will end up with incinerated almonds. Try cooking them at 350 and start checking at 6 minutes, otherwise they were delicious.
