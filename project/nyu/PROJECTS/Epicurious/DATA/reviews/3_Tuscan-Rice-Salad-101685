Disagree with reviews saying this was bland and hard to make. I thought it was quite delicious and SUPER easy. Boiled the rice in chicken broth, reversed the oil to vinegar ratio (and ended up adding a bit more of each) and added kalamata olives. Would like more egg and parmesan next time, though. Great use for the leftover Rosemary Garlic Pork Loin, and it definitely benefits from sitting awhile.

Used 1/4 c olive oil & 2tblsp vinegar as per other recommendations & glad I did. The vinegar would have been overwhelming otherwise. The rice was a little bland - the spices from the pork helped, but next time I will cook the rice in chicken broth. Maybe use 2 eggs & much more parmesan.

I never follow pairing advice, but this time I'm glad I did! The ingredient list reads like Chinese Pork-fried Rice, but the taste was pure Italian. I used the Garlic-Rosemary Pork Loin leftovers from Sunday dinner, but the salad would taste great without meat - and perhaps subbing in an equal amount of another vegetable. Same goes for the omelet strips; easily omitted, but it gave me an excuse to use up leftover frittata. As an ode to healthy eating in the New Year, I used brown rice, and it worked super well. Interesting comments about the vinegar-oil ratio 2:1. I added the warm rice to the dressing and let it soak up the flavors as it cooled. I was expecting to tweak it, after reading the reviews, but thought the balance was right on. Don't be put off by the comments that this salad is a lot of work; it isn't! You're cooking rice, adding a dressing, leftover meat, and frozen peas. What could be simpler!

Made this with leftover roast pork loin from the noted Epicurious recipe. The rice is very good and easy to make. I didn't think it was highly fragrant (even thought I added extra romano cheese and fresh chopped rosemary), but the dish was still quite nice. We had some the next day - contrary to other reviewers, I didn't find the flavor enhanced, though it was still good.

I made this recipe with a few additions, and it was to die for. Granted, the oil to vinegar ratio is off, and I did add a chopped clove of garlic to the dressing, plus more parsley, but I certainly did not think this was bland or boring!

I did equal parts vinegar to oil for the dressing, added a teaspoon of chicken better than boullion to the rice boiling water to add a subtle flavor and tossed with the cubed fresh tomatoes. Served with a bit of Pecorino on top and it was rated very very good by the hubby.

Really very good - we used organic short grain brown rice - which took much longer to cook but turned out lovely.

People seem to be all over the place with this recipe -- I personally enjoyed it, as did my family. In my opinion it is much better if it sits awhile. Also, to anyone using arborio rice be sure to cook it as the Italians do, i.e. in lots of water (like pasta) and then drain it after.

I think this is a fantastic dish. It has wonderful flavor and texture. My advice: just increase the olive. The recipe certainly does seem to have an incorrect ratio for oil to vinegar.

This is a pretty boring salad without much pizzazz. With all the other much better rice salads out there I probably won't make again.

I used leftovers from the rosemary garlic pork recipe--about 1 3/4 cups, reversed the oil and vinegar ratios, omitted the egg, added another few tablespoons of parmigiano reggiano, replaced the red onion with a large shallot and served over baby arugula. It tasted like summer and Italy to me--I loved it.

The ratio of vinegar to oil is too extreme. I reversed the amount of oil to vinegar to create a good vinaigrette, poured it over the rice while still warm, and let the entire salad sit for 15 minutes before serving. After adjusting the vinaigrette, the salad was quite tasty.

I didn't particularly enjoy this recipe other than the fact that it used up the rest of our pork loin. Husband liked it, though.

This was an easy summer salad that went well with the barbeque tri tip. It was so fresh and tasty. I added chopped flat leaf parsley.

Too many pans and too much prep. Too much vinegar. Liked eggs and parm though

This is not a spectacular recipe. Not one I'd show off with at a dinner party, but it is quite good. A great way to use up the leftovers from the Roast Pork Loin with Garlic and Rosemary recipe. My husband enjoyed it, and my kids loved it! I'll definitely make it a gain, especially since it's so kid friendly.

This was way better than I thought it would be. Very delicious. My husband even ate the left overs for lunch and he never eats left overs. In stead of fresh parsley (of which I didn't have) I used the frozen parsley cubes from Trader Joes. Worked great!

I made this an hour before serving and the too-myuch-vinegar flavor that another reviewer mentioned had mellowed out. The entire dish was OK but not special enough to warrant the prep work.

Excellent! Great for a summer main dish for a light dinner.

I use this in the summer with leftover pork tenderloin. It is a very lovely dish. We follow the directions exactly with the exception of the egg (which we leave out). I think the use arborio rice makes the dish. I have never had a problem with stickiness.

This was nothing special - I would have rather had the leftover pork roast sliced and rewarmed than in this salad.

Yuck, yuck, yuck! I made this with Arborio rice--big mistake, it was VERY sticky. Also I used balsamic vinegar as recommended by one reviewer-- I don't recommend that either. IF(and I stress IF!)you make this, be sure to use long grain rice and either a red wine vinegar or cider vinegar. That may be the only hope for this one. Good luck!

I'm not a fan of arborio rice, so I simply substitute regular long grain rice. I also suggest adding the juice of half a lemon to the recipe. It just seems to add a little more zest to a great recipe.

I made this rice salad for our block party and everyone loved it. I cooked two well seasoned butterfly pork chops in a skillet instead of pork roast. It was fast and tasted great.

This was an outstanding dish. I prepared it a day ahead and it was far better tasting when served the following day. I also used extra pork with lots of fresh garlic and rosemary. Every dinner guest loved this dish and wanted the recipe. I give it four forks and two thumbs up.

I used the rosemary pork and balsamic vinegar. My husband and I both took it to lunch the next day, and it was wonderful

My husband and I love this recipe! We will usually prepart the pork tenderloin with garlic and rosemary and use the remainder to fix this dish for our lunches the next day. I would cut back a little on the vinegar in this recipe. You can always add more if you would like. Great recipe!

I made extra pork just for this recipe and it was worth it. My husband gobbled it up quickly. It was better the 2nd day though.

I would definitely cut back on the vinegar. I used a high-quality red wine vinegar and it was overpowering.

This recipe is really delicious. My husband and I gobbled this dish faster than we were eating the leftover loin... Be sure to use a high quality vinegar. I also added a bit less red onion and a little more pork. I found the proportion tastier.

A great way to use leftover pork. I served the leftovers with omelets for breakfast the next day. Even better!

My husband likes to make the roast pork loin for a special dinner for the two of us and then I can follow up in the next few days with the Tuscan rice. Two really good meals with little effort.

Yum! I have made this several times with leftover pork roast and love it. It is great dish for a picnic also. Different and refreshing.

I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, fresh mint instead of Italian parsley and sprinkled some hot sauce on it. The result was that it tasted Vietnamese rather than Tuscan but it was very good.

We enjoyed this warm salad. I added pico de gallo to it to spice it up. I would also cut the vinegar back a little bit.

Great way to change leftover pork loin to something interesting. I substitued balsamic vinegar and it was a success. It was much better right after making it than eating it right out of the 'fridge the following day. Enjoy.
