Even my picky eater son snarfed these down! Just cut back on the salt in the filling. The dumplings also freeze beautifully if you want to make a large quantity.

I prepared these for a dinner party and they were delicious. For what its worth, we did a taste test of cooking methods -- some were boiled, some steamed, and some pan fried & steamed. The universal consensus was that boiling came out best, so I recommend sticking with the recipe!

Better than anything I've ever had at a restaurant! I made the wrappers, which is not impossible, but make sure you factor in the extra hour our so of prep time. We ended up with 44 dumplings in the end. No alterations are necessary; this recipe is perfect!

Fantastic recipe, easy to make, better than any take out in my area... I used frozen wrappers and followed their instructions by first frying them in a saute pan for 2-3 min then adding 1/3 c. water and letting it boil off...

Excellent recipe. I put my own little twist on it by adding some chopped shrimp and a little chili paste(2 tsp.)just for a little heat.I will never order steamed dumplings again.

The filling for these is just delicious. It is not worth making the dough. It's hard to roll it out thin enough and if it's too thick, it gets chewy. Store-bought wrappers work great.

This was actually easier than I anticipated (I used premade wrappers), and I steamed the dumplings for 12 minutes rather than boiling them. I also cheated and used a store bought Hoisin sauce for dipping. They were fantastic, these are definitely added to the "what to cook to impress guests" menu.

Great steamed dumplings. I used the premade wrappers and made the dipping sauce a little spicier. Better than any dumplings I've ordered out.

An absolutely adaptable recipe. The stuffing can be made and served heated over rice! Yummy and quick!

This was an easy and delicious dish, even my sometimes afraid of "new foods" husband enjoyed it. The only thing I would have enjoyed more about it would be if my hubby would get brave enough to learn to use chopsticks.

Made this dish for a potluck and had a number of people express surprise that they were not from a restaurant! They loved them and ate them all. I had to get used to working with the dumpling sheets, but once I got the handle on it, no problem. I will definetely make these arain.

These were quite good. They were also fun to make. I followed the recipe pretty closely but had to use wanton wrappers as I didn't have time to go to an asian market to find sturdier dumpling wrappers. Next time I will try making them myself

I make these often (using premade skins and an Annie Chen dumpling press) and the recipe is delicious, if a bit labor-intensive. However I would recommend pan-frying and then steaming them, rather than boiling: this is the traditional way of making "potstickers," and it results in tastier, crispy dumplings. It's easy: once you've made all your dumplings, heat about 5 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet, until the oil is hot but not smoking. Reduce the heat to medium, and start putting your dumplings into the skillet one at a time, holding them by the joined seam and pressing down on each one gently, so that they sit upright on flattened bottoms. Don't crowd the pan -- you don't want them touching each other. With the pan uncovered, let these fry for about 4 minutes (or until they firm up and hold their shape when you pick one up -- the bottom should be a medium golden brown). Once the bottoms have browned and crisped (the dumplings should not be cooked through yet), pour about 1 cup of cold water directly into the pan and cover immediately with a well-fitting lid to trap the steam (be quick and careful here: as soon as you start pouring, the pan will spit a lot). The steam that's produced will finish cooking the dumplings. After about 6 minutes of steaming, take one out (replace the lid) and cut it in half to make sure the filling is cooked through. If it's cooked, remove the dumplings and serve. If not, pour some more water into the pan, replace the lid and allow them to steam for 2 more minutes. Sorry for the epic post but this is a fabulous finish for a lovely recipe. I hope you try it!

Yes, these are fabulous! I made the wrappers from scratch (food allergies prevent us from buying premade wrappers) and I learned a few things in the process. The dough is adorable... it's soft and pliable and very sticky. Use plenty of flour while you work with the dough; it quickly absorbs the flour and becomes sticky again... which, really, is what you want it to do so that your dumplings don't fall apart! The big surprise was this: I rolled all the wrappers first (while my husband made the filling - we had quite the assembly line going), and I stacked the wrappers in a staggered fashion on a board so they'd be ready to use. But by the time I'd assembled about 20 dumplings, the remaining wrappers were completely melded together! Because we were cooking for just ourselves, this was pretty funny! But it wouldn't have been if we'd been cooking for guests. I'm not sure how I'll handle this next time... I think the only option is to roll as you go. Next time I don't think I'll roll more than 10 in advance. By the way, we substituted minced gulf of Maine shrimp for the pork, and it was lovely! It took the 2 of us an hour to make this recipe beginning to end, including making the wrappers and peeling a pound of tiny shrimps.

These dumplings are utterly scrumptious and (if you use packaged wrappers) relatively uncomplicated. I froze a ton of them in between sheets of wax paper that I'd sprinkled with rice flour and they don't stick to one another at all. The ease of having them on hand for quick dinners more than makes up for the time spent stuffing them. I used fairly lean ground pork and they have wonderful, authentic flavor without any greasiness. This is the best dumpling recipe I have ever found.

I completely messed up the prepwork, and it STILL came out great! I never blanched the cabbage; I didn't steep, strain, or drain the ginger. Even so, the flavor was wonderful, and definately work all the work to get there.

These were just terrific! The only change I made was that I added some minced water chestnuts that I had in the fridge and I didn't serve the dumplings as an appetizer, I made a simple beef broth-soup with finely chopped veggies (red onion, yellow pepper, carrots, mushrooms, white corn,cilantro) and tossed the dumplings in once everything was boiling. Fabulous!

I was taught by my former Chinese girlfriend how to make similar dumplings. She always used sourkraut in the pork mixture. I have tried several different ingredients. Mine always get better, this is my favorite food to cook. Would suggest to get the premade dumpling wrapper prefferably the round wrapper. And don't be afraid to add some heat to the dipping sauce. I have cooked these in China 2 times now and they can not tell the difference between mine and the kind they were raised on in China. Always get family and friends to help you wrap them that is the time comsuming part. But the more you make the happier your guests will be, they always dissapear fast.

I had never made this type of food before, but was pleasantly surprised by how easy to prepare and how delicious they were. I did not soak the ginger, but just added right in, as well as a minced garlic clove. Also, I did use store bought wrappers and steamed the dumplings instead of boiling. They were a big hit!

I love these dumplings. They are especially good if you substitue celery for the cabbage. You can also substitute leek. I ate these all the time for lunch when I lived in China. For those who think these are time consuming, you should have your guests stuff the dumplings. If you have the filling prepared and the wrappers out (cover with a damp towel), your guests can have fun sitting with each other and stuffing the dumplings. Then, they take no time at all to cook.

This recipe is similar to my mom's recipe for dumplings. The dumplings are just like how I remembered them whenever I was in Taiwan.

Delicious, but a bit time consuming. You have to plan ahead for this one. To spend less time away from my guests, I cooked in advance and simply heated in the oven. They're always a hit. Recommend a good quality/low sodium soy.

Great recipe! I am Chinese, and attest for its authenticity as well. Don't be shy with the spices. I added more ginger and scallion to the dumpling fillings, and minced some garlic and red pepper for the dipping. Excellent!

This is a very nice recipe for dumplings. I added some chopped mushrooms to mine, as well as a heaping tbsp of garlic (one can never have enough garlic). I also found that wilting the cabbage in a frying pan made for less gloppy filling. Likewise, I omitted the water called for in the recipe. I chose to make a peanutty dipping sauce rather than the one in the recipe: equal amounts of peanut butter and oil (vegetable + chili oil), sugar to taste, and about 4 tbsp of soya sauce.

These were outstanding. They are a little labor-intensive but worth the effort, especially when entertaining. I used wonton wrappers and took extra care to seal the edges of the dumplings. They took over an hour to make, but only 5 minutes to disappear.

These dumplings were incredible! I used pre-packaged dumpling wrappers which worked well, but the most important ingredient turned out to be the soy sauce. Kikkoman soy sauce is unacceptable for this recipe. Make the effort to find another brand, preferably one from an Asian supermarket. Wei-Chuan low salted soy sauce (green label) is the one I used, and it is fantastic. I never thought soy sauce was supposed to taste like anything more than salt! The dumplings took a while to put together, but in the end were completely worth the effort. My Taiwanese friend gave me the added reassurance that the recipe is very similar to her traditional recipe. Five stars!!

I made this recipe with pre-packaged (non-frozen) wonton wrappers and they came out amazingly well! There were four adults and a child eating them as an app. and all 50 disappeared as quickly as they came out of the boiling water! I used regular cabbage instead of the Napa without any compromise in texture or flavor! My husband, parents and son said I was free to make them anytime! Excellent!!

I added fresh shitake mushrooms and a couple cloves of garlic to the mixture and they were fantastic! I would increase the soy sauce for the pork by a tablespoon or more, as it appeared to require more salt. Also, I panfried the dumplings in a little oil before boiling them to achieve a slight crispiness and golden color. Now, I have great dumplings in the freezer that are a yummy snack or appetizer.

Great dumplings. I used garlic salt as I remember while I was in Taiwan that people would eat raw garlic with their dumplings. This recipe provides better dumplings than I can find in the store and I like mine with thicker skins which gives a chewier and more toothsome experience.

I thought this recipe was very easy to follow and the photo tutorial very helpful in showing a novice cook like myself how to create delicious dumplings! I made the dumplings on the weekend with some girlfriends...V.fun in the kitchen. Later on in the week, I cooked the remaining dumplings for a quick weeknight dinner. VERY EASY & DELICIOUS!!
