I made these cookies for a book club meeting the month we read a book from Mexico. Everyone raved about them! I'm not sure about the proportions of dough to filling; they were a delicate strudel to assemble; perhaps a bit more dough? But not too much more; you don't want it to overpower the scrumptious filling; cutting is also tricky, but worth it!
