Fantastic! Felt like I was back in Tuscany. Made the recipe as is except for one change. I used 28 oz. of San Marzano peeled tomatoes plus juice. Also used toasted panko breadcrumbs. I cooked the beans about 10 minutes longer than the recipe said. They never broke apart, but turned out fine.

This soup was absolutely delicious. So simple to make too. I used spinach instead of kale. This is a keeper!

Made this without the pancetta, but it was still delicious. Was more like a very thick stew than a soups which was surprising, but very filling and warm on a cold winter night. Much better than my standard beans and greens.

This recipe is DELICIOUS. I ended up using a quart of chicken broth and used big chunks of toasted baguette instead of breadcrumbs. I was surprised that I didnt need to add ANY extra seasonings as I normally douse everything with some extra salt, but this was perfect as is. THANK YOU!

Delicious soup for a chilly evening! I increased the onion, celery, carrots, tomatoes (28 oz.) and used 4 oz. pancetta and 4 oz. ham. I also increased chicken broth to 3 cups, and thought 2 cans of beans is enough. Toasted panko breadcrumbs. Husband just loved this!

Easy to make and so delicious. Tastes juste like the Ribollita we had in Italy!

This was delicious. My boys are pretty picky but really enjoyed this. Was looking for something to use some of my leftover ham in so decided on this. No celery since I did not have any. Toasted bread crumbs? My Trader Joe ones looked pretty white so i browned them in the oven with leftover truffle butter. End result - I will make this again and again.

Outstanding. Easy, tasty and healthy. I made it with some turkey sausage I needed to use up and less oil. I also forgot the bread crumbs at the end, but we just dunked our crusty bread in it. This will soon become a standard winter soup in our house!

Made this recipe with a few modifications that I read in some other recipes. Sauteed the vegetables with the pancetta. Pureed half the beans and added them to the pot with the whole beans. Also, cut up a loaf of 7 grain bread and added it to the pot for the last 10 minutes while simmering, which is more like classic ribollita. Yum, this is a fantastic recipe. Served it to company with the Mediterranean with Prosciutto and Pomegranate Salad, it was a big hit.

As a lover of authentic regional food, I have to complain about this Americanized version of "Tuscan Ribollita". I have had ribollita many times in Tuscany and this recipe is definitely not ribollita the way Tuscans make it. Real ribollita is a meatless bread soup with white beans and vegetables. There is no pancetta/bacon/ham/sausage, and Tuscans do not cook with garlic. And breadcrumbs??? The bread is the whole point of ribollita! If you want to make real ribollita from this recipe, omit the garlic, forget the meat (meat stock is OK), and - very important - use black kale instead of celery. It gives a distinctive tangy taste that plays off the sweetness of the carrots. You won't need extra rosemary because the soup will be anything but bland. And the bread... Find a salt-free artisan bread with a dense texture. Tear it into 1/2" chunks and stir a liberal amount into the soup, until it begins to thicken noticeably. Now THAT is ribollita! The word "ribollita" means "reboiled", and it it typical to serve ribollita that has been cooked and reheated a few times (the beans melt into creamy goodness on Day 3). Don't settle for less than the real thing - it's incredible.

Yummmmm soooo good! I changed a few things--an extra can of diced tomates, one less can of beans and extra carrots/celery, EXTRA rosemary for sure. Really, really rich and delicious. Oh, and I didn't add breadcrumbs.

Will definitely be making this again. I used bacon rather than pancetta, and omitted the breadcrumbs, and added white wine. It was delicious and hearty, definitely a meal with some crusty bread.

We have made this soup at least a few times now since we liked it a lot. We used chicken sausage instead of pancetta or ham. The flavor of white beans, kale, and tomatoes go nicely together. We will make it again.

Delicious. Used dried beans which extended the cooking time by a couple hours, skipped the kale and ham because I didn't want to run to the store and added a parmesan rind that I had in the fridge. I think the kale and ham would have added flavor but this is a flexible soup that can take many different variations. Haven't used fresh rosemary in a soup in a long time and LOVED the flavor it imparts.

I made this recipe once "as is" which was a little bland, but good. But it's fantastic with a couple of modifications. I left out the extra oil and the bread - didn't miss it at all. Also, I hate when cheese melts in your soup and sticks to the spoon -- but the flavor of the parmesan is so great. So instead I just added a 2-inch hunk of parmesan rind to the pot while it cooked. (Same flavor, less goo). Ham is pretty interchangable with pancetta, but I added two links of smoked sausage, boiled ahead in the same pot, then drailed and sliced before tossing in with the veggies and ham to sear. It really helped with depth of flavor. Lastly, I liked the texture better with swiss chard than kale. I had no problem adding it to the pot with the stock and tomatoes (btw, get diced, not whole if you don't like all the seeds and membranes). I found that two cans of beans is better than three here - I used one can of cannellini and one can of small white beans, rinsed. My husband will eat this as a substitute for meat dishes, so that's saying something. Great all weather dish.

This was good hearty fare, and makes for another way to use Kale, always a good thing! I wouldn't say it was particularly special, but it's nicely filling, and when thinned with more water/stock, accepts tortellini very well to make it a hearty meal.

This is so delicious! Left out all the olive oil and the cheese and it was still excellent. 1st time I tested and made a single recipe...ate the whole batch myself in less than 24 hours. 2nd time I doubled it as an appetizer for 10...not a drop left! Used Canadian Bacon, diced tomatoes, dried rosemary...otherwise as stated.

I made this exactly as specified with the exception of using dried rosemary in lieu of a rosemary sprig. I've been trying recipes that make use of kale and this is by far the best. It has a nice note of rosemary that is refreshing.

Nice recipe. I used dried beans...best to soak overnight, then cook, 1:3 ratio

This is excellent soup, loved it. I thought maybe it would be a bit bland but I thought the flavor was good. The only thing I did not add was the bread crumbs to avoid some carbs but I did not miss them. I used ham instead of pancetta and small white beans. I will be making again and again.

This was amazing! I had a pound of dried great northern beans to use, so added an extra can of tomatoes (used diced with basil/oregano from the pantry). Also added fresh thyme and used 6 cloves of garlic. Everyone had seconds!

Wow! I know it's unfair to rate a recipe that you didn't strictly follow, but I figure if I like the result, I should report it. Dang, this soup is so good I don't want to stop eating it. I wanted less fat per serving, so I browned a good chicken sausage instead of the pancetta. I used fire-roasted canned tomatoes instead of plain. I added a spoonful of brown sugar and of red wine vinegar at the end. I served it with the cheese and a drizzle of white truffle oil. This one goes in my personal hall of fame. Do give this one a try!

This is really excellent the next day. I added 1 tablespoon of sugar on general principles. I used frozen spinach, thawed and drained instead of kale because I'm just not a kale fan. Garnishing with parmesan and olive oil really add to the dish. I also garnished with black olives. This definitely gets into the menu rotation.

This was an excellent, hearty meal for a cold winter's night. Next time, I would use an extra sprig of rosemary and a few additional pieces of pancetta. I served the soup with toasted farmhouse bread. Delish! I will definitely make this again in the very near future.

Ribollita means "reboiled." I have made this many times using the vegetables mentioned and sometimes I add cabbage. You could use any vegetables you want, but I think the cooking method is important. The soup should be cooked and cooled, then add day old bread torn into little pieces and bring to a boil once again. It should be served warm or at room temperature drizzled with a little olive oil and red wine vinegar and garnished with red onion. It's a simple dish but out of this world in my opinion.

Excellent! This is one of the best soups I have ever made! I doubled the carrots, celery and tomatoes, and used chopped ham. Wow, I don't know what else I can say about this. I've never had kale before, I've really missed out! I will be making this often
