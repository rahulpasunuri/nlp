Made this corn bread to use in the Corn Bread Stuffing that goes along with this recipe. This corn bread is good for stuffing but not to eat on its own. I used yellow cornmeal instead of white. One recipe is enough to make a 9x13" pan of stuffing.

This recipe was written to be a part of a cornbread stuffing recipe, and it works well for that. Dense is good when you need to cut cubes and toast them.

This is a wonderfully rich and dense cornbread. Did I mention it is dense? If you like your cornbread "heavy" you will enjoy this. If you prefer a light, fluffy, cake-like cornbread, keep searching -- this recipe is not for you.

This is the recipe my mother used with homemade buttermilk biscuits to make the best Thanksgiving stuffing anyone has ever tasted.

There is a problem with this recipe that is easily resolved. The bad taste detected by some reviewers is due to the 2 tsp of baking soda. Make this change and you'll have cornbread you will love: use 1/2 tsp of soda, 1 tsp of baking powder. I've tried the recipe as written and then with this switch, and I'm sure you'll agree.

To make a better tasting/heart healthy cornbread: Sift 1 c. flour of choice, 1 tsp. salt, & 4 tsps. baking powder together. Stir in 1 c. yellow corn meal (corn is yellow, right?) & 1/4 c. sugar. Add 1 large beaten egg to 3/4 c. milk. Stir into dry mixture,(if too dry, add 2-3 tsps. milk). Heat 1/4 c. olive oil in oven proof 12 in.(well used cast iron is best) skillet. Add to mixture, mix well, and return to skillet. Bake in 400 deg. oven 'til top browns and cracks, about 25 min. Can be made 2 days ahead. Tip: heating oil and skillet before adding mixture ensures traditional brown bottom crust. I have a 30-yr-old cast iron skillet I use only for cornbread but never, EVER cook anything in it w/water. Raised by Grandmother born in 1880s & have used this recipe for 30+ yrs. w/great success every time! Great buttered w/ beans, soups, & stews or can be used for holiday dressing to serve 12.
