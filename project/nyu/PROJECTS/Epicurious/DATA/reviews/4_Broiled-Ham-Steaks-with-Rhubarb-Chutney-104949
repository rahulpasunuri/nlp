Very good, did not have cherry preserves so used fresh cherries. Yum! Would be very good on pork tenderloin and I like the suggestion of using it on a turkey panini.

Super-- I just made this to go with grilled pork chops tomorrow night. I think this could be used with a variety of meats.

Very easy recipe and very good. It goes very well with a ham steak. It was a little too early in the season for rhubarb so I used strawberries instead and halved the sugar (used splenda). If I did it with strawberries again, I'd leave out the sugar altogether. It was a little on the sweet side but not offensively so. With rhubarb, it probably wouldn't be too sweet as is.

Super delicious and very easy. Used black mustard seeds and strawberry jam as that is what we had on hand. Thought sugar could be cut back a bit, but overall, really wonderful. Chutney would make a great addition to a turkey panini as well.

I made the chutney to go with a baked gammon. It was very easy and everyone loved it - the sweet and sour really complimented the saltiness of the ham.
