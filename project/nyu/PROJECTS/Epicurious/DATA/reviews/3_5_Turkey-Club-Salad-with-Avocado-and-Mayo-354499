I liked the lemony, creamy avocado dressing, but it was not appropriate with this salad. When I think of a turkey club, I don't think of lemon. Next time around, would omit the lemon juice and possibly add olive oil to the dressing so that it would toss better with the salad. I loved the crunchy croutons and the salty bite of the bacon

I thought this salad was excellent! I had to use chicken cutlets because my market didn't have turkey in stock, but I don't think that substitution made much of a difference. My husband really liked it as well. I'd definitely make this again.
