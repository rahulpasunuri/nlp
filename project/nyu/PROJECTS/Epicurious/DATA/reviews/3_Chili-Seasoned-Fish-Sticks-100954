This recipe didn't work out very well. Followed instructions but coating was mushy and difficult to cover once you touched it with your fingers. Flavour was marginal.

These were pretty vile - soggy & tasteless, apart from a hint of acrid raw chili powder. On the plus side, the mayo kept the fish moist. The Diablo Baked Fish Sticks on this site are much better.

This recipe is great ! It was quick, easy and tasted great.

Easy, relatively quick, and deserving of 3 forks in my husband's opinion. Be sure the fish is fresh, and use enough salt. As crispy as can be expected without frying.

I thought these were great, especially considering how easy they were to prepare. I took it another step and used them as the basis for fish tacos: flour tortillas, shredded green cabbage and a sauce made of equal parts ketchup, mayo and buttermilk. Add a squeeze of fresh lime and voila!

I used catfish filets and substituted plain yogurt for the mayonnaise. Everyone loved it and requested the leftovers for lunch the next day.

My husband fixed this for dinner tonight and we both really enjoyed it! We used tilapia and low fat mayo. I think we used too much of the cornmeal mixture because our fish sticks did come out a little "powdery" looking. We both voted this recipe a keeper and plan to fix it again soon.

We love this dish, not too hard to make. I often use catfish but have used tilapia too.

This was really nice for a quick and very casual lunch. I served them with home-made mayonnaise which gave a bit more of a tangy flavour.

A really good, tasty, easy recipe. Works with various types of fish, eg orange roughy, cod, halibut. My 18 month old son just puts this meal away! (And Dad is constantly sneaking bites as well.)

First time my opinion of a recipe doesn't match with other reviewers. These came out terribly, not crispy at all, didn't taste good, and totally stuck to the pan.

This is one of the best fish recipes i've ever tasted. The mayo and lemon juice make the fish sooo juicy. My husband really dislikes fish BUT this is one of his favorite meals. Try this for your fish-hating kids or spouse!!!

This was great and very easy. My husband has requested it again. I used frozen orange roughy filets, and it was a snap to make. We will have this one again!

I found the fish bland but it was better than anything you'd find in the grocer's freezer. I definitely recommend serving it with tartar sauce. My husband liked this dinner since there was little to clean up.

My ratings are usually in line w/ everyone else's but for some reason this fish didn't appeal to me. Perhaps I missed something but I felt the fish need more seasoning. I did sub a whipped salad dressing for the mayo and perhaps that was my downfall!

I used fresh halibut fillets; easy and awesome flavor served with homemade low-fat tarter sauce. Keeps the fish moist. A keeper.

Good and fairly quick. I made some homemade tartar sauce and that really made it good. I think I didn't grease the pan well enough because a lot of coating was lost trying to dislodge the sticks.

I used halibut steak instead of fillet and it was great. Just cutting up that halibut was a little work. And the pieces ended up looking like chicken McNuggets. But it tasted great anyway and my 2 year old just loved it. It's a great finger food for them.

Very good! My husband requests this recipe. It is also a healthier version of traditional fish sticks. I use lite mayo.
