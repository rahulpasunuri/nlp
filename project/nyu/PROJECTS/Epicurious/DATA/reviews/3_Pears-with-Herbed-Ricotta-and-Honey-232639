Think this recipe needs some tweaking. Perhaps it would be better with canned pears, or all heated together. The texture just didn't seem right.

I liked this, my boyfriend fell over and made it two nights in a row! The flavors are yummy together and it's an interesting, fresh, new mix of flavors. I enjoyed it. We tried cooking the pears the second time we made it, but it's much better when the pears are nice and crispy! If you have a sophisticated palate this one is for you!

This was disgusting. I made it exactly as the recipe asked, and the flavors simply didn't go well together. Gross. Don't make it.

It was just ok... I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and then drizzled a balsamic reduction over the top as suggested by other reviewers. I'll look for different recipe next time I am in the mood for a pear dessert.

I wish I did not have to select a fork to demonstrate the level of satisfaction I had for this recipe. My dad's reaction to his first morsel of this so called delicate and flavorful treat was like when a baby is fed mashed brussel sprouts and then squints his eyes and wants to spit it out but can't for fear of the spoon stuffing the mush back in. I proceeded to try it myself and it was truly disastrous. There is nothing enjoyable about this recipe. The only enjoyment that we got out of it was a VERY VERY BIG LAUGH. I am sorry to those who liked it, I am sure that there are many people who would like this recipe; our family was just not in that bunch.

Beautiful presentation and amazing flavours. It sounded good in the recipe, but I was still wary. I shouldn't have been--this recipe is amazing! Light but tastes elegant. I didn't have fresh thyme nor fresh mint, so I used chopped dried thyme and mint/peppermint extract instead. Still wonderful. I'm looking forward to trying it with more fresh herbs next time.

YUM. The only trouble I had with this dish was stopping myself from eating my weight in full-fat ricotta. Make this dessert for a lot of people so that you can't possibly ingest more than 40 times your daily recommended saturated fat intake! (Fresh herbs from the garden - especially the mint - are subtle and highly pleasurable.)

This was a yummy, not-too-heavy, and attractive dessert. My mom was impressed.

This recipe is very tasty, and my fiancee has requested it twice since I made it for the first time. I almost didn't make it, given the negative reviews, until I read them and discovered nearly ALL of the negative reviews had not even MADE the recipe. Please do not comment unless you have something constructive to say from PRACTICAL experience with the recipe in question.

This is a very easy recipe and it's good, and looks good too, but not my taste. I prefer baked pears.

I always read reviews of recipes. I agree with the sentiment that reviews should only be written when the dish has been tasted. Please excuse me for this note. Thanks!

This is the perfect mariage between a traditional sweet dessert and a cheese course. Next time, I might try adding a little gorgonzola or mascarpone for variation. It's also nice with a few simple cookies for dipping.

Why all the hissy fits? Let's all just try to get along. We're talking recipes here--nothing earth-shattering... Enjoy your pears.

Amazing 7 reviews and only three actually tried the recipe. Don't make reviews unless you made the dish!

This was wonderful! I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and used a balsalmic reduction (Gia Russa has a bottled Balsamic Glaze, available at Publix supermarkets) and drizzled over pears and also drizzled a little maple syrup, which I had used in the ricotta instead of honey. The presentation on white plates with the two drizzled sauces was as good looking as any dessert or a first course, or breakfast brunch item could ever be. I guess you can tell that we loved it!

What review prior to making it are you talking about? As for London's question, good observation. Sounds like it would make a wonderful starter. Thanks for the suggestion.

I grated a handful of quite sharp pecorino cheese and added to ricotta along with the herbs, and used chestnut honey which is a little more bitter than others. Definitely a more grown-up taste which can never get mistaken for a dessert!

In response to London. Perhaps instead of honey some kind of a reduced balsamic sauce over the top would make it more savory and less sweet and work better as an appetizer.

Please make and taste the results of the recipe before you offer up a review!

I wonder whether this would be better as a starter than as a dessert? Maybe too sweet? Pears and ricotta do make such a wonderful starter.

Loved it. An elegant easy to prepare dessert.
