very good, super easy and we loved the biscuits!

I used sweet pluots and some plums that were still quite tart, but otherwise followed the recipe and the cobbler turned out great! I made some biscuits from the extra batter which turned out amazing also.

I halved the recipe as I had a dozen or so very small quetsches (oval, dark purple plums available here in France) that weren't very tasty to eat raw. I substituted creme fraiche for whipping cream, increased the cinnamon and added an equal amount of nutmeg which i LOVE. It is FANTASTIC! The bisuits are light and fluffy, the sugar level is perfect (i.e. not too sweet, but that's obviously easy to adjust for personal tastes) and the underside of the biscuit actually cooked! (usually the problem for me with other cobblers). Great, simple recipe. A keeper.

Didn't think this was worth the work. Biscuits not very tasty.

This was VERY sweet. Maybe my plums were too ripe, maybe I just wasn't in the mood for something this sweet. I might try it again because I love plums in desert and this SOUNDS very tasty.

Delicious. I substituted whole milk for the whipping cream and still was tasty.

very tasty way to use this year's plum harvest, but next time i'll make 1.5x the amount of filling because the biscuit to fruit ratio was off, even with the addition of two sliced apples. level of sweetness was exactly right.

Wonderful, not too sweet.

Brought it to a Labor Day picnic. Was a big hit. Glorious way to use fresh plums.

Excellent! I made this tonight for my family, & my parents went back for seconds. I made it pretty much exactly as written -- only thing was my plums were really ripe & sweet, so I used only 3/4 cup of sugar, and that turned out to be perfect. Served with whipping cream. Easy to make, my 21-month-old daughter even participated! The biscuit topping is lovely & light. Yummmm. This is a keeper recipe -- I'll definitely use it for a dinner party, as you can do it ahead, it's not fussy, and it looks good.

Yum. I really liked this and didn't think I would. All the flavors go nicely together. Definately a keeper for what the plum trees yield year after year.

This was a nice change from the usual cobblers and a great way to use all of those plums from your tree! The taste was unusual in a good way - the cinnamon really complements the plums. The bisquits are great -- they taste like true scones (not sweet). I had a little extra batter so I made little bisquits to serve on the side.

This recipe was definitely worth making! I was skeptical because I had never made anything with plums -- but the taste of the biscuits with the plums was delicious! A quick tip: use a little extra sugar with the plums if they happen to be a bit tart. This recipe is a must!

I make this recipe all the time with satsuma and santa rosa plums from my dad's trees. I freeze the plums, so I can enjoy this recipe all year. I don't change a thing in the recipe, and it turns out delicious each time! Very easy and smells wonderful too.

Holy cow, this is good! I made it for a potluck and everyone loved it. I used a mix of red and black plums. The dough was stickier than I expected but the biscuits baked perfectly - very happy I didn't add extra flour. As an added bonus, my kitchen smelled like plums and cinnamon for hours. I will be making this again very soon.

While both my husband and I liked this a lot, I will increase the filling next time, and possibly add more sugar, depending on the tartness of the plums. We both thought the "biscuits" had a wonderful texture.

I made this for Fathers Day, and it was delicious! I absolutely loved the plums & cinnamon together, and it was perfect with vanilla ice cream. I doubled the cinnamon in the biscuits, and it was done at 20 minutes instead of 30. This one is a winner, give it a try.

Great recipe, but it was fouled up by the cook. I used plums from my backyard, which are a lot smaller than regular plums, and I didn't use enough. Came out with a little too much biscuits. Still tasted fabulous!

I just made this with the end-of-the-season italian prune-plums (the little ones that come at the end of the summer). It was terrific... have been looking for a cobbler for years that had good biscuits and this one was perfect. Very tender buttery biscuits.

Delicious--definitely a keeper! Next season I will plan ahead and make it when there's a special on plums; I ended up paying 1.59/lb, which makes it a bit pricey.

Great dessert! I halved it, and used less sugar with the plums. Would work well with figs, too.

I used half of receipe. Made a lot. I want to lighten up biscuits. Liked it a lot a that....Will make it again.

I made this for a dinner with friends and everyone loved it! The biscuits balance out the tartness of the plums.

This cobbler is very good, but better with the addition of a little fresh lemon juice and lemon zest.

To the question of peeling- no, don't peel the plums. The amount of cooking time plus the ingredients they "stew" in while cooking virtually dissolves them. This dish is excellent & pretty easy to make. The most time consuming element is cutting the plums!

I'd like to make this because it sounds delicious - could someone tell me if you're supposed to peel the plums first? thank you.

I made this for a dinner with friends just last night and it was fantastic! It was a great finish for a casual meal and my guests raved. The only thing I changed was to use Penzey's Cake Spice (a mixture of China cinnamon, star anise, nutmeg, allspice, ginger, and cloves) instead of plain cinnamon.

I made this recipe for overnight guests for dinner and they all raved about it and said they would eat the left-overs for breakfast! Very good warm with vanilla ice cream.

I would like to score this recipe in two parts; the fruit filling is perfectly sweeten and I wouldn't change a thing, but I was not too thrilled with the topping. My complaint is that I prefer a drier topping similar to a biscuit or scone and this topping was more cake-like. Could be the egg.

Found it to be very easily made while preparing other food. The children enjoyed it. Also will make a great Thanksgiving/Christmas desert.

I made the dough using a food processor, with excellent results. All in all, the whole thing only took a few minutes of prep time, and I made it while otherwise preparing dinner. The result was a delicious dessert warm from the oven ready after dinner.

a no-nonsense easy recipe. just the right sour-sweetness of the plums, with the cinnamon biscuit - an instant success with kids and grown-ups. can substitute yoghurt or sour cream in place of vanilla ice-cream.
