Yummy and different way to make green beans - everyone loved these, even my kids. The leftovers were a nice addition to next day's salad.

I made this dish for 16 of my friends in college, and they all loved it. It was the first dish to go. I roasted the radicchio longer with more balsamic vinegar after it was added to the green beans and it took a little of hte bitterness away. Overall, i thought that it was a very festive looking dish, with the red and the green. This was a really great recipes

It was the only thing on the table that people did not enjoy. I made all the recipes from 11/06 The Big Thanksgiving.

The radduchio was bitter (I learned it is good to soak it in ice water before cooking and it won't be so bitter), the beans were overcooked and I didn't like the presentation. Perhaps I cooked the beans too long (I followed the recipe, though). It was a good recipe for doing ahead, but needs modification.

I roasted the beans for 8 minutes as a reviewer suggested and it was long enough. Also I peeled and sliced the garlic. Everyone loved this dish.

My mother brought this recipe to my house for Thanksgiving, and it worked perfectly well being transported and then reheated. It wasn't particularly attractive, which is why I go with 2 forks, but it was quite tasty. Not bitter or raw as the previous reviewer states, though it's true that the radicchio gets a funny color. This recipe isn't a stand alone, but it still stays in the recipe box.

This was terrible--I ws so embarrassed. The radicchio turned a very unappetizing shade of brown and everything was very bitter. Three pounds of green beans plus to heads of radicchio is a lot to fit on two baking sheets so everything was packed in tight, and I don't know how 2 tbsp. each of olive oil and balsamic vinegar were supposed to adequately cover or flavor this dish. By the time the beans and were getting browned, the garlic was still almost raw, and that plus the bitter radicchio (which I normally enjoy) overpowered the whole recipe. I won't make this again next year. The search is still on for a great Thanksgiving vegetable dish!
