Who knew almonds could be this creamy and delicious! My sister and I both loved this dish. The flavors melded very nicely together. Excellent. A keeper.

This is a nice light springtime sauce. I would saute the garlic before blending, it was too harsh raw. I also added a little half and half and nutmeg for creaminess.

After Reading the reviews from others about the blandness of this recipe, I adjust to increase the flavor. I used 3/4 cup vegetable stock instead of water, 3 cups of reserved pasta water, which I reduced with the almond and garlic sauce before adding the pasta and peas. I also added an extra 1/4 cup of Parmesan. It was delicious with these few adjustments. Thanks for the reviews good and bad.

I made it for the first time for dinner and was very pleased! The ingredients sound a little weird at first but ends up tasting excellent! YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS!!

We REALLY enjoyed this pasta. Made recipe as is. It is light and a perfect summer dish although I made it in the winter because I wanted to try it. Will definately be making it over the summer....I just used sliced almonds...

I made this exactly as written, except for using 16oz instead of 10oz of peas, and found it very blah. I couldn't get the sauce very smooth, which would have improved it, but the flavor of the sauce was just not very strong at all. The mint and basil added some complexity, but the almond flavor was not very strong, and even if I had added more garlic, the flavor would have been stronger but still boring. Maybe some crushed red pepper would have been a good addition. I just don't feel this recipe is worth working on to jazz it up. I'm deleting it from my recipe box.

I made this for dinner tonight and found it very bland and boring. My fiance didn't like it either. I definitely wouldn't make this again and would not recommend anyone else to make it.

I made this a while ago...could barely eat it. Husband thought it was okay.I did not make any changes.

Wow, was this bland. It was filling, I'll give it that. And for someone like me who doesn't like peas, it manages to disguise them pretty well -- they're only noticeable in terms of their cute little "popping" texture. Other than that, you wouldn't know they're there. A great way to sneak peas onto a pea-hater's plate. It's creamy, it's "almondy" and it's garlicky (ish), so it's okay, but by no means is it anything spectacular... :-/

I was extremely underwhelmed. The sauce smelled great all the way through the cooking process, but somehow the finished product didn't follow through. On the other hand, my boyfriend and roommates LOVED it. I will say that the almond was a really nice textural touch.

THIS IS DELICIOUS!! Easy, cheap and perfect for summer. We made it with spaghetti and it was really excellent. I would make this another time, without a DOUBT. It is great for weeknights, and it yielded tonssss of leftovers. I defnitely reccommend!

we really liked this. 9.8 says my husband - 10, if I had put chicken in it...I did add 16oz of peas instead of 10 (we love peas) but pretty much followed the directions otherwise. It was surprisingly satisfying and tasty.

Very easy and as stated, satisfying. I had penne not cavatappi, and some flaked almonds, not blanched so ground those up instead which worked reasonably well. Cavatappi would work better, and blanched almonds would probably make for a smoother sauce, but it was hardly unpalatable as I made it. I toasted some reserved flakes for the garnish, and enjoyed the dish. It is more filling than you might think. I also added a little bacon and parboiled asparagus to the leftovers for a nice variation.

This was a light dish with subtle, fresh flavors. At the advice of some of the previous reviews, I substituted about 1/4 cup of the pasta water for a citrusy Sauvignon Blanc I planned to drink with it. The substitution worked well, and I wish I had used more. I really liked the roasted almonds on top and would've used more of those too.

Use milk, in place of water, and add diced red bell pepper for added color, complexity and richness of flavor.

I made this almost as described but substituted green beans for the peas, because my husband is vehemently opposed to peas. I added about 1/3 cup of artichoke hearts, but found it somewhat bland. It got thumbs up from the family, but not way up. Next time I think I will add chicken stock or white wine and more lemon and garlic, and maybe increase the quantities of the herbs.

This was incredible. Made it for Easter. One guest declared it was one of the best sauces he'd ever tasted. Did not use mint only because I couldn't find it. Perfect spring recipe. Almonds were so tasty. Served it over homemade cavatelli pasta. Sublime.

This pasta was a hit with my family. We had it as leftovers the next day and it was a bit dry. I would add a bit more water to the puree. Possibly more lemon juice too. The pasta sucks up a lot of the moisture.

For the amount of work involved (very little), as well as the expense of the ingredients (also very little), I think this is out of this world. The almond flavor is subtle and lovely. Use blanched sliced or slivered almonds to make it easy to blend. I agree with the prior reviewer that it would be a bit boring without the mint and peas. Fine to increase the peas, though. The recommended garnishes are essential in my view.

I made this as written, and it was great. For what it's worth, I think the dish would be sad without the mint or with only half as many peas.

this dish is all right. I probably won't make it again but, if I did I would reduce the peas by half.

I made this a couple of nights ago for a mixture of meat eaters and vegetarians. The whole group really enjoyed it. I made just a couple of changes--left out the mint, used white wine to blend with almonds instead of water, and used the juice of 1 whole lemon. I also doubled the amount of peas for added nutritional value. Don't forget the chopped almonds to finish--I added some shaved Parmesan along with them over the top. Yummy!

I made this almost exactly as written and it's delicious. It isn't a typical "creamy" pasta, but provides a similar richness. However, I didn't use 2.5 cups of pasta water because even 2 cups seemed like a LOT. Also, the sauce took quite a bit longer than 3-4 minutes to thicken - about 10-15 minutes.

I made this for dinner the other night and it was good. I put extra garlic since my family likes garlic. I left the mint out since I thought it would over power.
