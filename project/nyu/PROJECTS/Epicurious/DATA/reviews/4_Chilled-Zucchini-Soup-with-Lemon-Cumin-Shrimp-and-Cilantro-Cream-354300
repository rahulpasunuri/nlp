this is easy and delicious.The only difference is that I only marinaded the shrimp for 20 mins, and it was fine. oh, and I also added a little mayo with sour cream for creaminess and salt. served it warm.

Amazing! The only change I made was I didn't use cumin seeds (didn't have) and used ground cumin instead. Will make again and again. Easy. Guest's did not know what the soup was.

Outstanding!! The cilantro provides a vibrant green color and the taste is fantastic. I asked guests to tell me what the ingredients were and no one could, but all said the soup was excellent. Most thought "pea soup" and only one said "it has cilantro". Definitely add as much as the juice of one lemon before blending; also, a full pound of shrimp is probably too much for six servings.

This is now our go-to zucchini soup recipe...so easy, and a very nice complement to the shrimp. I use homemade turkey stock in the soup and I add a little sambal olek to the shrimp for extra kick. Also good with seared scallops instead of shrimp...

This soup has a great clean zucchini flavor. I added a little lemon juice to punch it up. The cumin seeds don't really add anything to the shrimp- next time I'll leave them out or just add ground cumin. I'll make this again and again!

I've made this twice now and I really think it's best served warm. I just serve the shrimp @ room temp. The shrimp marinade is excellent.

gorgeous! my favorite part was the cilantro cream, which was delicious and very quick to make in a food processor. Next time, I think I'll try substituting fat-free strained greek yogurt as a healthier alternative to sour cream.

The spice blend for the shrimp is AMAZING on grilled chicken. (hubby's allergic to shellfish) The soup was good and fairly easy to make. Enjoyed it warm and chilled. I have made the Cilantro Cream a number of times since as well. Didn't know that garlic was the secret to success with that, now it's a regular side in our menu.

This soup was good after I added more garlic and cilantro and some lemon zest to it. I also added garlic to the shrimp and marinated overnight. Will make again as it is a great way to use zuchhini.

Just made the soup and not the cilantro cream or shrimp, but still quite nasty on it's own. And healthy. Added a dash of cumin and coriander at the end for extra flavor, and served it warm.

Guests and spouse enjoyed this very much and the pale green soup with the pink shrimp and cilantro cream composition is certainly lovely appearing. The shrimp was great prepared this way, though I found the soup a bit bland. I will try some of the suggestions from other reviews and perhaps the leftovers will taste better today. A wonderful way to use all of that zucchini our gardens are so overrun with in the summer.

We tried this three ways: room temp, chilled, and heated. It's excellent -- especially when the flavors have had a chance to blend overnight. I increased the amount of zucchini to 2 lbs. and used additional chicken broth to thin it a bit before serving. Fresh raw garlic truly adds a punch to the cilantro creme.

Fabulous flavor and texture. Do not adjust ~ get the cool cilantro and bitterness of zucc skin. Cold is a must served on an August dog day. My zucc and cilantro were homegrown. Best is that all 3 componenets could be prepared a day ahead. My first course only needed to be plated for service. ( a fun dinner - all four courses incl zucc).

Excellent - one we will make over and over.

Terrific recipe, easy to make and very refreshing in the hot summer months. Only change was the shrimp were steamed and and sprinkled with fresh lemon juice before serving.

Elegant, delicious, and refreshing. I added scallions to the cream.

This was delicious and a great way to use up some zucchini. Next time I will toast the cumin seeds in a dry pan first to release some of the oils. The marinated shrimp adds tons of flavor. I coarsely chopped the shrimp so that it would be easier to eat in the soup.

I've been making this soup for years; it's great either hot or cold. Caramelizing the onions and adding a bit of dashi with the broth will up the savory quotient on this dish, important when serving it cold.

Followed the recipe to a T. Be generous with the cilantro. This was one meal where after my first bite I could honestly say there was nothing that needed to be done to make it any better. So yummy!

I'd love to give 3.25 or 3.5 forks. It didn't throw me into ecstasies but it was really delicious. The soup is pretty basic, but the fun is how the shrimp and cream bring it to life, and how the separate components blend in each spoonful. I used smallish-medium shrimp and thought a pound was too much for the amount of soup. Next time I will get half a pound and use smaller shrimp or split the medium ones in half. It's the flavor you want, not the bulk. At any rate, a very nice starter for a dinner party because it's not something people are likely to have had before and it's delicious.

While the garnish of cilantro cream and lemon shrimp were very good, I thought the soup itself was a bit flat and flavorless.

This was fantastic and very healthy! I used low fat sour cream and it worked great. The brightness of the lemon and subtle flavors of cumin on the shrimp were the best part. I used it as a first course followed by the salmon with pistou in the same issue. Perfect.

The soup was delicious. I substituted basil for cilantro and left the shrimp out. I put in a chopped jalapeno for some spice. Served warm, it was delicious!

I made this for a dinner party and it was fabulous. It got a standing ovation! The soup was so velvety that you could not believe it did contain cream. However, I did not put the cilantro cream on top of the shrimp ... instead I put several dollops of it in the soup.
