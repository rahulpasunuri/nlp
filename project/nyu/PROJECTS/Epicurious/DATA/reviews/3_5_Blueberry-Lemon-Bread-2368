OMG! This is amazing. Lemony, buttery, blueberry-y--so, so good. It is kind of time consuming and fussy to make, but what a payoff! Wish I had doubled the recipe. Nice to know it freezes well. An excellent use for excess blueberries. I did use half buttermilk and half milk. I also coated the blueberries in flour so that they would not sink to the bottom of the pan.

This turned out great, like a lemony pound cake with blueberries. I accidentally put 1/3 cup more sugar in the batter than I was supposed to, but I guess my blueberries were extra tart because the level of sweetness was just right. Don't skip the lemony glaze at the end, it really gives the loaf an extra citrus kick.

Great recipe! Made it as it was written. Used frozen blueberries and the use of flour on the blueberries really worked. Also buttered parchment paper so there was no sticking to the pan.

Love this! My go-to brunch/light dessert recipe. Many of my friends request this bread by name (and some demand it). I never have problems with it sticking, just use Pam with flour in the loaf pan first. I love the glaze, but typically pour it on and only let it sit for a couple of minutes before turning it out onto the rack so that it doesn't get too wet. Delish!

Delicious and very tender, but holds together well. Please don't skip the lemon glaze -- it doesn't make it sweeter, it makes it much more tart and lemony. I doubled the recipe but only used 1 stick of butter total, it was still plenty rich. I used frozen berries, not thawed, and rolled them in flour. If you're having trouble with sticking, try oiling and flouring your pan. Don't use butter!

fantastic! doubled the recipe for a larger pan- halved the butter and omitted the last step (lemon and sugar)for a lighter healthier bread

This is a fantastic recipe. I followed the instructions as printed. Very light and very tasty. My baking time though was approximately 65 minutes. When I try a new recipe, I will set the timer for less time to be sure I will not overbake.

Love this recipie. I used fresh blueberries and rinsed them then tossed in a bit of flour and none sank to the bottom. Great flavor, very moist, and highly recommend the lemon juice/sugar glaze. Followed recipe to the lettter except for using the entire amount of sugar in the batter. Still not too sweet.

I made this recipe in 1991 when it appeared in the August 1991 Bon Appetit. It soon became a family favorite. I lost the recipe in Hurricane Katrina. I am so thrilled to have found the recipe online and once again I am a blueberry-lemin bread baking machine. Thanks for posting one of my family's favorite recipes.

Makes a very moist pound cake-type bread. The cake was sweet enough so I decided not to add the glaze. Unfortunately I forgot to dust the blueberries with flour, and they did sink to the bottom. Still tasty though.

This one is a winner! Added extra lemon zest & fresh jc. from 1/2 small lemon to the batter, floured the berries, and lined the pan with parchment(greased & floured). It was perfect. Mine didn't take the full cooking time--was finished about 6 minutes early. It is delicious!

I made this using half whole wheat flour, and brown sugar instead of white. The dough was thicker and the blueberries stayed in place. DELICIOUS! Even my kids loved it. For the lemon glaze, I reduced the amount of sugar and it was good.

Very good. Even dusting with flour, my berries still mostly sunk to the bottom, but nobody seems to mind. The glaze is overkill for me, but my sweet toothed fourth grader loves it.

I found this bread to sweet (despite not using the topping) and rich for my taste -- it tasted more like pound cake than a bread to me. My friend enjoyed it, though. I put flour on the blueberries and generously buttered the pan and didn't have any of the sinking or sticking problems others have described. The bread rose nicely, but sank back down a bit as it cooled. Perhaps this was due to my doubling the amount of lemon peel called for. I probably won't make this again as I prefer something more bread-like.

Rating: 3
The flavor in this bread is incredible, but I did have problems with the bread sticking in the pan (I buttered the pan with pure butter first like one review suggested). I will try again using parchment paper, or try butter and flouring the pan. The bread is very moist, and I don't think I will add the sauce next time.

This was just what I was looking to serve after a summer dinner. Light and sweet - perfect topped with a dollop of whipped cream. Would also be a great brunch item, I would imagine. Will definitely make this again! Oh, I coated the blueberries with flour and didn't have a problem with them sinking, and didn't have any problem getting the cake out of the pan either.

This was a quick and amazingly delicious bread. I found this recipe to be very easy. I used fresh blueberries, and I did dust them with flour and for the most part they did not sink to the bottom. I also adjusted the amount of lemon peel to 4 tsp. and added 1 Tbls. of fresh lemon juice to the batter. I also used a touch more sugar in the batter. I used plently of butter in the pan and had no trouble getting the bread out. This was a hit at home as well as at our neighbors the next night

Rating: 3
Yummy and very easy. I didn't think it was a four fork recipe however it was very flavorful. The blueberries and lemon are a 'never fail' combination. I would like to try this in a different pan...individual bundt or something for a different presentation...the loaf pan just doesn't cut it.

Rating: 4
This was so good. After a long walk (in New York City), my boyfriend and I came back to the blueberry bread that had been cooling on top of the stove. It has a lemony tang that is perfect, and the blueberries (I used fresh) did not fall to the bottom like some people said. Also, if you dont have time to make the glaze, it would be just as good without. Lastly, I used 1/3 cup extra sugar in the batter by accident (wasn't reading the directions to closely) but it still turned out great. I guess mine just had 33% more calories than the leading brand, not less. =)

Tasty! Excellent, moist cake...no problems with falling berries. I prefer more lemon flavor, and will increase the lemon zest to 3 or 4 teaspoons next time around.

This is a very nice bread--light and moist and cakey with a good flavor. I added a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice to the batter to make it more lemony. I used 1 cup of frozen wild Maine blueberries coated in flour and didn't have any problems with them sinking. Instead of the sauce, I made a glaze of powdered sugar and diluted lemon juice, which made for a pretty presentation. I think the bread would be every bit as good as written too though, and everyone at work seems to agree. This is my favorite quick/tea bread recipe so far!

This bread is soooo yummy. I made it last night. It was easy and delicious. It is great for breakfast. Another user complained about the berry falling to the bottom. I used frozen blueberries, I rolled them in flour and cooked them frozen, it came out perfect. The lemon sause is sooo good, add a very nice flavor to an alreay delicious bread....

Rating: 1
I didn't have the same luck with this recipe so many others seemed to have. While the cakey bread is delicious, all the blueberries fell to the bottom. I used frozen berries, drained them, dried them on paper towels, and dusted them with flour...all the suggestions I'd read earlier, but it's a mash of soggy berries at the bottom. Perhaps fresh berries are best. The lemon topping is excellent, and I'll use it on other recipes. In trying a number of tea breads, I find the Sweet Olive Oil Bread the best so far, on Epicurious.

I've made this bread twice. Increased lemon zest to 1 tbsp.(or more)for great lemon flavor. First time, I used butter in the pans; loaves came out perfectly. Second time, used new LOL product "spreadable butter with canola oil". I did everything else the same, but these loaves stuck to the bottom of the pan. So...I would advise using regular butter to grease the pans!

Rating: 4
This is just wonderful bread. I have made it multiple times, and have had a wonderful product each time. It doesn't even need the lemon-sugar sauce on top. I tend to get impatient, so I would recommend allowing the bread to cool completely in the pan before trying to take it out. I have had many seperations of the top and the bottom of the bread because of this.

Rating: 4
Awesome. I recommend making more lemon sauce for pouring over the top and being very careful to add more sugar to the bread and/or the sauce if the berries are sour (and maybe even if they are not). This disappears in minutes every time I make it.

Delicious! I had to use up some blueberries and absolutely love anything lemony, so I gave this a shot. I am so glad I did, as was the rest of my family who gobbled it up within an hour. I had no problem with the blueberries sinking, but a little flour on the berries would definitely remedy that. My boyfriend wants me to try this glaze on other things also because he enjoyed it that much. I am off to experiment!

Obviously a versatile recipe. I felt like a citrus fruit bread and found this recipe while looking for an orange bread to try. Figured what the heck and substituted orange zest for the lemon. It came out beautifully. I used frozen blueberries without thawing them and was very pleased with the result. Be prepared for the blueberries to sink to the bottom and create a two layer effect with berries on the bottom and bread on the top. To compensate for oranges slightly less pungent flavor when compared to lemons I increased the amount of zest to a tablespoon and substituted 1/4 cup orange liqueur for a 1/4 cup of the milk, unfortunately I forgot to compensate for sweetness of the liqueur by decreasing the sugar so the finished loaf is a little sweeter than my preference but my male relatives will devour it and the blueberries work nicely to balance it by being a little tart. It would be good either as a dessert or as a breakfast bread, it has a very fine crumb and is a little on the crumbly side. I like it and it smelled delicious while baking, I will definitely make this recipe again.

This is definitely a good brunch thing. I am into hearty breads, and on the hearty bread scale I would put it more in the cake-ish range. But it's very pleasant and it's nice toasted with butter. For people who love lemon and blueberry, it's a nice treat.

If there could be five forks..this would be it. I used maybe half of the topping which gives the cake/bread a nice finish. My berry picking in NH this summer paid off; frozen blueberries, thawed and drained worked well. Entire bookclub voted it was just the right amount of lemon..every crumb devoured!

Rating: 4
Excellent! 3.5 forks. I made a ton of various yummy blueberry lemon goodies, yet this one managed to stand out. The blueberries did sink to the bottom, though, which made the bottom half of the bread slightly wetter (and slightly blue) compared to the top half. So next time, I will flour the blueberries. Also, I want to increase the lemon flavor somehow, either with more zest, or lemon extract or juice. FYI, I had to bake the bread for about 7 mins longer.

This was good and easy to make! It's more like a cake then a bread and you must like lemons. I used fresh NH wild blueberries and most of them sunk to the bottom. I think if you toss them with some flour this may help suspend them in the batter better. I will make it again!

I'm about to make this for the first time. I came to this web site looking for the blueberry-lemon loaf reciepe that was published in the late 70's or early 80's. that reciepe called for oil instead of butter and buttermilk in place of milk. That was one of the best breads I've ever made. Is there any hope of getting it again? (When we were redoing our kitchen, all of my favorite recieps were thrown out. Also, around the same time a reciepe for pineapple-zucchini bread was published that I'd tove to have again!! Thanks, Marta1 P.S. I like to substitute lime for lemon in the blueberry bread, it's a wonderful change from lemon everything! I've even used tangerine.Wow!

I remember having to buy blueberry lemon bread with a rich buttery lemon taste. After trying this recipe in 1991, I haven't stop since then, I was surprise of the results. I no longer have to buy this rich buttery blueberry lemon bread. I can make my own! Tip: I butter my loaf pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. Then I butter the parchment paper. Turns out great everytime!

This recipe was tasty enough but it didn't blow me away. I made this for my boyfriend's birthday last night, since he loves both lemon and blueberries. He liked it, but I could tell by his face that this was not four forks material. On the recommendation of a previous reviewer, I made it in a bundt pan. (I buttered and floured it -- no sticking at all.) I can hardly imagine this recipe as a bread -- it's so sweet and cakelike. The dough is even made just like a cake batter. I added about 2 tablespoons (!) lemon zest to the batter and it wasn't lemony enough without the syrup. Also, I used frozen, unthawed blueberries (most recipes tell you not to thaw berries, I think) coated in flour. The batter turned bright blue as I folded in the blueberries -- if you're using frozen blueberries, expect a blue cake. Happy eating!

I have made this recipe every year since 1991 and it easy VERY easy to make. I pour the batter in individual size bread loaf pans and give them out as part of my yearly holiday goodies to friends and co-workers. They look forward to it every year. This recipe has never failed me!

Very good recipe that I would enjoy making again. In response to the reviewer who has problems with it sticking, I suggest that she line the bottom of her pan with wax paper or parchment after she butters and flours the pan, and then butters and flour the paper too - I can guarantee the cake won't stick then! I LOVE lemon, and the recipe was too strong for me as written. Next time I will cut down on the amount of syrup, but that's just for my taste; you have to be your own judge. Also, the berries all sank to the bottom of the pan. I strongly suggest that you flour the berries before you mix them in very gently so they stay suspended in the mix. Definitely worth making.

Very easy to make and is delicious-I agree with others that it's more like a cake than a bread. Next time I would probably add extra lemon to the cake and not add the topping since it made the cake too sticky.
