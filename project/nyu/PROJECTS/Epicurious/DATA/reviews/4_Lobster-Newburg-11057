For a different twist (since toast points aren't my thing), try serving it over Basamati rice with a garnish of fresh Cilantro leaves --- DIVINE!

I have been trying various seafood newburg recipes every year for about 10 years, trying to find the definitive one for New Year's Eve. This is it!

I would only recommend changing one thing on this recipe. Do NOT Boil the cream, slowly simmer it to reduce. This may take longer but the richness of the cream that you lose by boiling can be astounding. Never BOIL cream, always simmer and stir frequently, the same goes for stocks that you prepare, do not boil them, always simmer them slowly. Once the stock is complete, then it is okay to boil down, but never do so with cream.

If I should die before I wake (from so much cholesterol in one sitting) it would be worth it!! This is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I used B&B for the brandy, adding just a touch of sweetness, and it was perfect. You have to try this at least once!

Perfectly delicious as is! Would also try with shrimp and/or scallops.

We made this on New Year's Eve in Maine and it was absolutely fabulous! We doubled it for 6 people, and I used only sherry (didn't have cognac). Otherwise followed the recipe. Served over split phyllo shells, with some good champagne (for the adults!). Even my 10 year old loved it.

I thought the recipe needed a fourth lobster. Also, I like chunks of meat so I would not cut all of the lobster into half-inch pieces. I have been eating lobster newburg for 50 years. There is something missing in this recipe. It just might be cooking the empty shells in a fry pan and then adding a bit of brandy to flambe. The rendered liquid might add depth to the newburg sauce. When I figure this out, I will be back with an additional note.

I made this as an appetizer for our Valentines Dinner and it was exceptional! My fiance absolutely loved it and I can't wait to make it again! I am going to try it over rice--thanks!

This was lovely for Christmas Eve. I used frozen lobster meat and served it over Pepperidge Farm patty shells. Delicious and it looked beautiful!

The hit of Christmas Eve. I would make this again, it was worth the time and money involved.

Mother's Day dinner was definitely elegant with this as the star. Served over rye toast points, champagne as the beverage. Made it with a combination of shrimp and lobster. Was a huge hit. I wanted a bit more sauce so used 2 cups of cream and increased egg yolks by one and added an extra tablespoon each of the sherrry and brandy.

This was everything you want lobster to be - rich and luxurious. I considering using puff pastry instead of rye points to dress it up even more, but it wasn't necessary. Serve it with chamapgne for a special occasion.

Only change was I used lobster tails, lacked flavor, no one was impressed with the flavor, and I put it over puff pastry shells. I would not waste lobster for this dish again.

Instead of toast, I served the newburg in crepes. Wow this was good!

Awesome!I used frozen lobster, so there was a fishy taste. I added condensed cream soup to mellow the fish taste, but had the lobster been fresh, the recipe was perfect as is.

Excellent, takes a little more time than the other lobster newburg, but well worth the effort. Extremely rich but incredibly tasty. When you put the cream and egg mixture in, important to keep whisking, otherwise plain and simple

Excellent! Old fashioned and great for low carb diets.

tried this with alaska dungeness crab and was very well received with an Oregon white wine.

I made this dish for New Years Eve dinner for 12- I double the recipe. It was easy to make and came out great! Everyone loved it. I servered it over biscuts as someone else had suggested. My kind of reicpe- good tasting, unique, and not too difficult.

This is what I call a really good recipe for lobster. I can understand why it became a classic. As much as I like it with lobster, I was surprised to find out that it does not work as well with crab.

I haven't made this particular recipe, although it is very similar to my own for Lobster Newburg. But please, PLEASE, do not discard the shells and bodies. These add so much to a lobster stock that can be used for various seafood sauces and soups, especially Lobster Bisque. In fact, lobster bodies with their shells alone make a great bisque. The coral (waxy red roe) is a particular prize. It generally runs all the way from the head to the tail of a mature female lobster. Mix it with softened butter and force it through a sieve as a garnish for lobster dishes.

Very tasty. Beware: after reducing sauce to 1cup and then using four egg yolks to enrich it you can end up with custard if you let the sauce get too hot. I whisked in a bit of milk and it turned out fine. I served it over cheddar cheese biscuits (recipe from this site) and it was great.

Excellent dish even for some people who don't really care for lobster, or think they don't until they eat this dish.

This was a great and VERY rich dish. We put mushrooms in the dish - sauted before we put in the lobster. Very elegant dish for company.

Quick and easy to prepare. Delightful to eat and savor. Wash it down with champagne. What a treat!

From an ordinary cook....I would suggest adding Shitaki Mushrooms or a Morrell for a bit more nutty flavor. I also added curry and left out the mushrooms was a great success!

Prepared from Live Atlantic Lobster, it is truly a melt in your mouth delicacy. The cream, brandy and port are a perfect match for the richness of the lobster!

Adjust the amount of cayenne or tabasco to taste. Great over rice. If lobster is not available,substitute shrimp, and/or scallops.
