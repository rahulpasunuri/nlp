Loved it. Made considerably more than I needed and please never, ever leave the cumin out. It's the perfect counterpart to the lemon. Adding 1.5 times the lemon is the only change I made. What makes it great is that the cumin and the neutral tofu holds the taste so you get the vegetable taste first then the lemon blast in a half-second or so later. Had three guests say that they love hummus but never had it this good. Never told them that it was tofu. Wouldn't have worked well for a couple of them, I guarantee.

Glad I didn't read the reviews before making this! I added a few sprigs of fresh mint and omitted the cumin, and it turned out just lovely! Smooth, creamy and rich. Make sure you use SILKEN tofu, or it will indeed turn gritty.

I loved the way this looked on the plate  the white of the dip and the intense green on the blanched broccoli. Very pretty. It wasnt the best dip though... i did receive a couple of compliments on it, but there was a lot leftover. I found it bland as well so I made a few modifications: a little more garlic, 3x the cumin and instead of a pinch of cayenne I used paprika to taste.

There must be a mistake in this recipe. It is gritty, tasteless and bland. Has something been omitted? I tried it for use at a party, it is a good thing I tried it first. How can you let a recipe like that go through? It shakes my confidence . I would give it minus forks. Have been a subscriber to Gourmet for about 40 years.
