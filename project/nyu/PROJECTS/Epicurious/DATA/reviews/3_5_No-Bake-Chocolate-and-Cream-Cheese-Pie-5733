If you like cheesecake, chances are you like cream cheese. During warmer months, this pie is perfect as a no-bake, PLUS cream cheese flavor is not altered by baking. Many times I prefer the no-bake as it more quickly satiates the cream cheese hankering - no eggs or other ingredients to get in the way. Recipe is also very malleable. Thanks!

My 12 yo daughter made this and it was fantastic. Easy, fast, no bake, and a huge hit with our guests. It was so good and easy that I saved it for her to make again. Highly recommend this with no modifications.

I just finished making this, for Easter 2010. I adjusted ingredients by 1/3 more because my family likes deep dish pies. I also subsituted some mint chocolate. WOW it is amazing and so easy to make. I also used a regular baked pie crust so it wouldn't be too sweet. This is going to be a family favorite.

I have been making this pie for years. Fast, easy, and very tasty. I have made up many variations, with banana on bottom, rasberry jam, grated orange, dolce de leche. Each one is someones favorite!!

I love this pie, I've made it many, many times and I've always gotten great reviews. It's easy to make and easily 'dressed' up with whipped cream and chocolate shavings.

This was just ok. I used great quality chocolate and really feel it was wasted. There are so many other great chocolate pie recipes that I doubt I would make this again. It was very easy to make though so if you are in a hurry for something, this might do in a pinch. I doubt it will WOW your dining companions though. Bon appetit!

We loved this. I used a shortbread crust and it all tasted so good. I had to use semi sweet chocolate chips and didn't have any unsweetened chocolate bars, so had to use powdered. It was very rich and very good. I would make it again for any meal.

Really good quality chocolate makes this recipe. I've made it several time, and each time everyone wants the recipe. Now I just print it up ahead of time and have it ready.

Very easy and quite tastey. I used kahlua instead of vanilla to intensify the chocolate flavor, which worked rather nicely. I also whipped up the leftover whipping cream with a little vanilla sugar and kahlua and spread it over the pie with a dusting of cocoa on top. Turned out looking kind of like a Mississippi Mud Pie but with a sophisticated taste and texture. Soooo smooth and creamy, but not to cream cheesey. Very good!!

This pie is delicious, rich, and easy. I used an expensive bittersweet chocolate (a key to success) and served the pie with fresh rasberries and whipped cream. Try expresso instead of vanilla. Divine flavor and texture, it's sophisticated and simple.

Yummy and easy. Received great reviews from my gourmet club. Really rich, did not taste too much like cheese cake. Used all semi-sweet, coffee liqueur, only 3/4 cup of powdered sugar and a homemade Oreo crust in springform.

The pie was great, very easy to make. I opted to put in amaretto instead of the vanilla.

This was a great recipe that was easy, but seemed like it had taken a lot of time. A great quick and easy substitute for cheesecake. I mixed bittersweet and semisweet chocolate and it turned out great.

This recipe was very simple and tasted great, however it was extremely rich. I served it to two adults and two children and no one could finish a full piece! I think that it would be best served with coffee long after dinner! (If you are on a diet definitely skip this dessert!)

I made this for Thanksgiving. It was the only dessert that was completely consumed!! VERY rich, more like truffle pie. Loved by all,ages 1-75 years. I would definately make this again, it was very easy to prepare.

Use the best chocolate you can find...I used coffee liqueur instead of vanilla, Grand Marnier would be nice, too. I've had requests for the recipe from everyone I've served it to, but only give it to my best friends!

Disappointed. Was looking for a rich chocolate taste, but just didn't happen. Easy to make, nice texture, but just not the richness that I was looking for.
