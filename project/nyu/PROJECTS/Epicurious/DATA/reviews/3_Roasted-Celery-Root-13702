My CSA box this week gave me two celery roots...hmmm...what to do with them. I love roasted veggies, and after perusing some other epicurious recipes, I decided to go with roasting. I cut them into batonnets and roasted them with salt, pepper, and olive oil at 375 degrees for about 30-35 min, flipped them halfway through to even the browning. Delicious, really! A culinarily-inclined friend had no idea what veggie they were when I put them in front of him, and when I told him he asked, "Did you add maple syrup?" Honestly, they cooked up very sweet on the slow roast. So go slow and use good olive oil!

This burned extremely quickly and wasnt very good regardless. There's better uses for this pretty bland vegtable I think.

Although edible, this side dish was nothing special. I love celeriac and don't want to waste it with boring preparations.

I used these pieces as croutons for a spinach-tomato salad with raspberry-walnut vinaigrette. My carb-conscious guests wanted the receipt so they could start having "croutons" on their salads again. Everyone raved at the flavor and how simple to make.

Yum. This is one of those recipes that looks so simple, you don't think it's going to be very interesting. But the celery root (which never disappoints, in my opinion!), carmelizes so nicely in this recipe. I think this could accompany almost any dish--we did it with grilled salmon.
