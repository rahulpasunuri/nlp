This was elegant, beautiful, and delicious made with fresh snow peas from our garden. My honey used white wine instead of water to cook the peas.

Made this tonight using red onion instead of shallots because that's all I had on hand. Added a bit of diced red pepper for color. It was a good dish, mild and pleasant. My toddler daughter particularly liked it. Though I threw in extra garlic and a sprinkle of dried mint at the end to enhance the flavour, as I found it a bit bland. It's a good weeknight family dinner dish.

I liked this recipe; simple, easy, and surprisingly tasty. However, I made the mistake of using frozen spinach, thinking it wouldn't make a big difference - and although it was fine I would NOT do that again. So tempting as it may be to make things easier by using frozen spinach - don't!! I liked the dish anyway, but I think it would have been ten times better with fresh spinach!

This recipe was such a crowd-pleaser as an everyday meal that it's been requested for Thanksgiving. Easy, delicious, and a great addition to a variety of meals.

Very easy and quite tasty. I didn't have fresh spinach, so I used frozen. I just defrosted the spinach and peas together in a colander and wrung out most of the water. Then I didn't need to add water. A little Old Bay was tasty, too.

I really like both spinach and peas and thought I'd love this. But it didn't quite do it for me. I added a bit of veggie stock to make it more flavorful. But I will mainly prepare these separately in the future.

If you keep frozen peas in your freezer, as most of us do, this is a great dish in an instant. We made it as written, but had a few slices of bacon leftover from breakfast, so added those to the shallots and garlic. The color is amazing, and this would go with virtually any protein. We had it with parmesan and sage crusted berkshire pork chops. A winner!

This is a great dish to round out your meal. It was visually pleasing and tasty, great for casual entertaining. I made it in the morning and re-heated it for dinner.

Sooooo easy to make, and so good! I do double it, because the original recipe makes such a small quantity (I use it for dinner parties). Wait on adding the water. I've found that I sometimes don't need it depending on the frozen peas.

Very simple, healthy and delicious! As previously mentioned, I doubled the garlic and shallots with no regrets! The only change I would make next time (also as previously mentioned) would be to cut the butter and oil, and drastically reduce the water to just a tablespoon or two.

we added extra garlic and shallots (bc you can never have too much) and used an entire bag of frozen peas and a bunch of regular fresh spinach (not baby). after jacking it up with some extra sea salt and pepper, the dish turned out quite tasty! im sure it will be even better tomorrow. my only recommendation would be to cut the amount of water that is added to just a splash or none at all.

I make this dish all of the time as a side - it is quick, easy, delicious and full of good green stuff!

I cut this in half and it's perfect for just the two of us. It has become one of our favorite sides. You can even add some mushrooms when you saute the shallots to add a little more depth, but this step is absolutely not necessary.

I have to rate this dish as just okay, however it gets 3 forks because my boyfriend loved it. I added extra garlic and onion (didn't have shallots and had to improvise). If you are in a hurry this dish is okay, but not great. I would otherwise recommend the Catalan Spinach on this site, it's quick and much more tasty.

This dish was great! Perfect mix of green veggies. Very easy to make. I added an extra clove of garlic the second time and it was even better.

I've made this dish every since it came out in Bon Appetite and my guests always love it. I sometimes grate fresh nutmeg into the spinach at the end.

Not adding forks, just wanted to comment that I have made a similar dish by Jamie Oliver a thousand times-- petite peas, scallions instead of shallot, white wine instead of water, butter. It's truly a delicious side dish with fish.

Delicious, and easy. I made it as written except I used a 6-oz bag of baby spinach instead of 5 oz. Tasted fresh -- and did I mention that it was easy?

Rating: 2
I wasn't overly impressed with it: I thought it lacked freshness due to the slightly sandy flavour of the spinach. The next time I'll try adding some lemon juice and some butter to give it more flavour. Basic idea is good.

Very nice combination, but next time I will use either more spinach or less peas. I reduced the butter and oil by half to cook the shallots and garlic and it worked well. Was able to reduce the fat without altering it's function or compromising flavor.

This is a great side dish -- easy and tasty. In our house it pleased eaters aged 8 to 48 (even the non-pea eater).

A very nice side dish. I added extra garlic and a squeeze of lemon juice before serving (lemon juice will discolor the peas, so beware!). Company loved it.

Quick, easy, and tasty, but nothing special. I omitted the salt and enjoyed the natural sweetness of the vegetables, so I think I'll continue preparing it that way. I'd keep this as a quick side dish for myself, but I wouldn't prepare it for company.

I made this with half a box of frozen spinach, to avoid the 20 mile trek to the store, It was good, but seemed lacking something, I added a 1/4 cup fat free half and half, and was more pleased with the result. Next time I will try with fresh spinach, but overall a good solid side dish. I also might try serving with a little cooked crumbled bacon on top.

Too much salt! Otherwise, this is a tasty and easy side dish. I especially like the pairing of the peas and the spinach, something I wouldn't have imagined but really liked. Next time I'll add more shallots and cut the salt dramatically.

Very easy, very tasty. I used a little broth in place of the water, and if you're leery of fat, the butter isn't necessary. The broth and shallot/garlic mixture make it rich enough.

This is a MUST HAVE for side dishes. YUMMMMMY! It compliments any dish. Can't wait to make it again!!!

My family loved this recipe. It was quick and easy to make. I did not use baby spinach and there was no difference. It did add a little lemon to it. This recipe goes with any entree.

Just made last night - very quick and easy. Fresh too, both looking and tasting. Flavors are subtle but enjoyable. I may try lemon pepper next time instead of any other salt or pepper. Will make again but won't crave it.

This is one of those fantastic side dishes that's fool-proof, fast, and delicious. Make it and then forget about it while you're focusing on the main dish. Plus, it works well with nearly anything.
