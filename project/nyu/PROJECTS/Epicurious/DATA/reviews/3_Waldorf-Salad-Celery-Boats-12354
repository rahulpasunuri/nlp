I would like a totally vegan waldorf salad recipe using no "real" sour cream-toufitti substituing for the sour cream, no mayonaise, no roquefort cheese also. Many of us out here as "total vegans" do not eat cheese or any dairy products. Help us find more sweet seasonings and dressings for fruit type salads, please.

This is a delicious, easy and healthy recipe. It is surprising that just the bit of lemon juice and vegetable oil was enough seasoning. But it looks like nothing on the plate. It was getting so skipped over at the cocktail party I took it to that I actually carried it around to make people try it. Maybe it needs something like diced dried cranberries to give it more eye appeal? I think 4 of these on a plate would be a nice alternative to a salad course at table. I ran out of celery to stuff, so I had a cup or so of the mixture leftover. The next day I added a cup of diced ham and a litle mayo to it and served it with crackers. It was even better. I would give it full forks except that it is a homely little dish.

very good.I added some Major Grey Chutney to the mixture for added flavor. Just dice it finely & add in place of the oil. I served the celery boats as part of a fruit platter.
