This was delicious! My husband, who is a terrific Italian chef, loved it. I did make a real tomato sauce from scratch to pair with the squid, but the squid definitely deserved it.

I tripled this recipe for our Christmas Eve dinner, except I kept the eggs at just 2. This was easy to do with help from the family, they stuffed while I sauteed and added them to the sauce. The squid were so tender and the stuffing was delicious. The flavors were even better yesterday when I reheated it and made some spaghetti for an easy blizzard dinner.

Authentic Italian fish recipes do not use onion or basil. Garlic and oregano is used.

I took the advise of martooti, Brooklyn though deleted onion. I made it using a single large squid ( about 2 pounds)which made stuffing it very easy. Cooking time was the same. My children 2 and 4 were asking for more and loved it. We served it with couscous and it all disappeared!! This will be a new special occasion recipe for our family

Followed the same steps, but added finely diced chorizo, garlic, jalapeno, onions, and lemon zest to stuffing. Instead of using a spoon, put the filling in a sandwich bag and cut a small hole in corner to fill the squid. Worked well, but was still quite messy. When complete, placed the squid and tomato sauce on a bed of linguine. The dish was delicious, but next time would use one egg, squeeze some lemon juice into the stuffing, and a little less bread crumbs.

This was excellent. Made it for our Christmas Eve Italian dinner and everyone loved it! I actually used frozen squid and it was still tender (I was so nervous it would be chewy). I only used one egg and the stewed tomatoes I used was already seasoned with basil and olive oil. I added additional basil, but didn't go nuts following the recipe to season the sauce. Thanks for the recipe! It was a HIT!

Omitted the eggs based on previous reviews and the dish turned out perfectly fine.

Delicious. Definitely would make again. Having said that, I must confess that I made a major change, substituting pork sausage instead of the tentacles. (I hadn't bought those.) Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter, omitting the lemon as suggested. I served it with spaghetti with tomatoes and fresh herbs, also from Epicurious, and the entire dinner was a great success.

This was effing awesome! Stuffing the small squid was hard, but I used the recommendation by the other users for one egg and the taste, texture, and experience was wonderful! Next time I would like to try the larger calamari to make stuffing easier and to have these as a main course. Also would like to try it as a scampi with this stuffing. Should be fun!

I agree that there were too much egg in the stuffing. The flavor were great though. I will make it again.

The flavor was ok but not exceptional. There seemed to be too much egg in the stuffing. I followed the directions exactly but it seemed I had omlete stuffed squid. The squid was very tender though.

This is an excellent recipe. I, too, did the variation with lemon zest and lemon, and liked the added dimension. Sadly we forgot to deglaze the squid browning pan with wine, but will definitely do that next time, along with increasing the amount of sauce so there is a little more to go 'round!

I have not made this yet, but there is a version in the "Sopranos" cookbook (surprisingly good!) that uses capers and olives, but omits the basil. Everyone loves this recipe, too!

I agree with other reviewers - definitely better with lemon zest in the stuffing. I had 6 inch squid, but following the recipe I only put a slightly rounded tablespoon in each squid and they were perfect, nice and rounded with no splitting - I was left with over a cup of unused stuffing. The only thing I did that I haven't seen in previous reviews was to deglaze the browning pan with 1/2C white wine after searing the stuffed squid in it, and then adding it to the sauce. After searing my pan was beautiful with bits of browned squid, browned stuffing, and a glaze of the squid juices I just couldn't waste it! It turned out great.

This is the first time I prepared a squid recipe. It was excellent! I will agree with the other reviewers: inexpensive ingredients, time consuming (as far as stuffing the squid) and lemon zest in the stuffing is essential. I served the squid and sauce over pasta. And I used a tomato sauce that my husband made earlier in the week from fresh San Marzano tomatoes from our garden. (The fact that the sauce was made ahead of time really made the recipe easier). Note: Fill squid ~1/3 full. They really shrink! And when they are in oil, they really splatter!

its great if you add capers. also add a red wine vin/sugar reduction to the sauce.

I also added lemon zest to the stuffing and lemon juice to the sauce. This recipe took a lot of time expecially to stuff the squid. I expected it to taste better considering the prep time. I will add capers to the stuffing next time. I also had a problem with 2 out of 9 squid spliting open and the stuffing pouring out in my sauce.

This dish was served on a bet being paid from our Fear Facter TV night. The kids held their noises at first but soon came around when the meat was cut small. I used a 1/4 C of bottled clam juice for kicks and zipped it in the frige over night. Outstanding.

wow, incredible! very inexpensive ingedients but allow yourself some time. tasted like it was a recipe from the old country. i added grated lemon peel to the stuffing and a little lemon juice to the sauce. very flavourful.
