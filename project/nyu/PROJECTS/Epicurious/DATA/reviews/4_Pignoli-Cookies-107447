This was the 2nd recipe for pignoli I've tried in the last few years and it was excellent. I followed the directions without any changes. They turned out great :)

The almond paste would not break up on it's own in my food processor...it stayed in one big lump. However as soon as I added the 10x sugar and the salt, the mixture became granular as described. Just a word of advice, I don't recommend using a baking stone for these. I use my baking stone all the time and have always had success with it, but in this case, the cookies on my cookie sheet cooked nicely, the ones on the stone stayed raw in the middle. When I put them back in the oven (WELL beyond the cook time suggested in the recipe) eventually the bottoms burned around the edges, but the middle of the cookies were sticky and raw. Long story short - lost half my batch. Use a sheet, not a stone for these. The ones on my cookie sheet turned out beautifully!

These cookies are fantastic. I was a little afraid to make them based on all the trouble previous reviewers had, but they were REALLY simple to make. I frothed the eggs first, then added in all the other ingredients. I used the tube almond paste and had no problem--just crumbled it as i put it in the mixer. Also, let the dough chill in the fridge for about an hour and wet your hands when rolling into balls.

Made these exactly per recipe, but without the pastry bag. Rolled 1" balls with wet hands and then pressed into circles with wet fingers before adding pine nuts. To peel off parchment, I found it easiest to "push" from under the paper/cookie so that no cookie stuck to the paper. These cookies rock!

Other recipes resulted in a cookie that ran all over the cookie sheet. This recipe required no chilling and the cookie held it shape perfectly. I used a cookie press to put the dough on the sheet. Dough is real stiff and sticky

Very authentic Italian cookie. Has anyone tried a Silpat instead of parchment paper? The bottom of some cookies stuck to the paper. Thank you to review of 12/12/09 carrie120 from w.caldwell, nj. I used her recommendations to first whip the egg whites till frothy, then add almond paste in pieces. I followed with salt, honey, powdered sugar. Putting the nuts on a plate and using a 1-1/2" ice cream scoop made it easy. Since the batter is sticky I lightly wet my fingers to pick up the dipped cookie which helped from sticking to my fingers. I had to cook mine almost 15 mins.

Perfect! The dough is like sticky, wet cement, so I skipped the pastry bag. Dropped the dough onto parchment w/ two teaspoons and then shaped them into circles w/ wet hands. I made 50 small cookies.

I can not believe I found this recipe! I grew up eating these cookies and I LOVE them. This cookie recipe is exactly like the cookies you get in the Italian bakeries in NY and NJ. They are sooo easy to make,this is from someone that is not a great baker. Wetting your hands to put cookie dough on cookie sheet probably helps the dough not stick to your fingers. Again, LOVE this recipe!!!

i've been making pignoli cookies for years & let me share some 'hints' with you. there's no need to 'break up' the almond paste in the food processor - if you whip the egg whites until frothy FIRST, then you break off pieces of the almond paste & add them to the egg whites as the mixer is running, you'll have a BEAUTIFULLY homogenous mixture without using an extra machine. don't bother with a pastry bag - unless you're an octopus or have an extra set of hands, use a 1 ounce spring loaded ice cream scoop to measure your dough. put the pignoli nuts into a pie plate & drop the dough, 3 at a time into the nuts. use your hand to scoop up the cookie so the nuts will be on the bottom only. when you place the cookie onto a parchment lined cookie sheet, just FLIP your wrist so the side with NO nuts is now on the parchement paper. bake as directed in the recipe. it's sooooooooo much easier, faster & neater to make these cookies with these hints. ALSO, try to find FRESH almond paste - i go to a local italian deli to get mine, but i've heard others say they can get it at the bakery AND it's usually cheaper too. 8 oz can of SOLO is around $5.49 - i get a pound of fresh almond paste for $4.99. the quality is amazing. hope you try my hints!!

The BEST pignoli cookie recipe I've come across! Assuming you have the right ingredients (namely, CANNED almond paste; not the tube) and the right equipment (namely, a quality food processor), this is one of the easiest and quickest cookie recipes...I made the dough in 7 minutes! Piping and dotting cookies with pine nuts was the most time- consuming part of preparation. Raised in New York in a large, Italian family but now living in Massachusetts, I have long-missed this traditional cookie. These are light and chewy with amazing almond flavor, and they hold their shape beautifully. Just like Grandma made and the bakeries in New York!

Have made many pignoli recipes, but this is my favorite. I make them every year for Christmas as part of my cookie tray.

The cookies were delicious, but a bit too chewy after a couple of days. I did use the tubes of paste as I couldn't find the cans; maybe this would make the difference. I wanted a bit more of a cake texture like the ones from the Italian bakery.

I love this recipe and make it every year for Christmas. My only suggestion is with the use of the pastry bag. Make sure if you use a pastry bag you have a fairly large opening to make the cookies otherwise it would be very difficult. Love these!

After reading numerous reviews I followed the advice of wetting my hands before rolling out the dough. I did use the food processor and hand mixer as recommended. I found the recipe easy to follow and didn't have any major problems. I did have to bake the cookies longer than 15 minutes - I used the convection bake setting. I would recommend waiting until the cookies are completely cooled before removing from parchment. My one "thing" was that the cookies are just a hair too sweet but other than that they are definitely bakery style cookies!

This cookies are good but I agree with a previous poster....the center is too dense and I would revise the recipe in the future to make the dough "lighter". Perhaps two extra egg whites will do the trick? I found another recipe that called for some white flour. My cookies were small-sized, golden brown on the bottom and top and when I bite into one, it looks raw in the center. I have purchased these from a local European bakery and when they make them, the inside is very consistent and baked. Also, I reduced the heat to 325, and baked for 17 minutes based on info I found on another website. The only direction I did not follow was baking the cookies half-time each on the upper and lower racks (I find that a pain). Would rather leave them in the center rack and bake longer as other recipes online suggest.

SOOOOO good. These are my and my mom's fave, and I made them for mother's day. I didn't have confectioner's sugar, so I used a mixture of ultra-fine and regular granulated, which turned out great. I also did everything in a standing mixer instead of a food processor. SOOOOO good.

These had the same consistency of my favorite Italian bakery -- toasty on the outside, creamy inside. But I might add the lemon zest and vanilla from one of the other recipes next time to give it a more complex flavor. I used my Silpat baking sheet (ungreased) and they stuck a tiny bit to it. But very tasty!

Finally! A great recipe for these cookies. They taste just like the ones from the Italian bakery. I have tried other recipes for these and always failed - they were always a soupy mess. I think the canned almond paste really makes the difference. The only problem I had was with the piping as the dough was rather sticky. Next time, I will try the suggestion of another reviewer and make small balls with wet hands and then flatten them.

These macaroons are wonderful, albeit a little pricy to make. After processing the almond paste in the food processor, I added the rest of the ingredients to the food processor bowl, as it seemed kind of silly to use both the food processor AND mixer if I didn't have to. These are really rich cookies, so one or two with an espresso will do you fine!

This looks like a great recipe. I will be making it tonight. If anyone has access to a restaurant supply store (I have an account at Jetro Cash & Carry/Restaurant Depot in the Philadelphia area) you can get large quantities of almond paste. I bought a 7-lb can for $20. A friend in the nut business (food, not psychiatry) told me I should be able to freeze it.

Rating: 3
These were excellent macaroons. I heard moans of pleasure from people eating them. I did not have any difficulty with making them. I used Solo almond paste from the grocery store shelf. I did not pipe them out of a pastry bag, but measured out scoops with a 2 tsp. measuring spoon. Then with et fingers, smoothed them into rounds and pressed on the pignoli. The baked up light and crusty and were truly delicious. I'll be making them again next Christmas.

These cookies are delicious. Just like the Italian bakeries. A little messy but well worth it!

This recipe is good, but I think too dense. For less dense pignoli, with a crunchy exterior and yet chewy center, I used 12 oz. granulated sugar and 4 egg whites. The dough is very sticky this way, so you have to pipe 1 Tbs. onto a wet hand, drop in pine nuts and form a crescent shape. Follow the same baking instructions. You'll need more pine nuts this way, however.

I consider my self a well seasoned baker, but these I couldn't master. I think I (as others did) used the wrong kind of almond paste. It was a sticky mess in the pastry bag. I've never actually had a real Italian Pignoli, but mine were flat and chewy. FYI, I did try the Barefoot Contessa's Jam Thumbprints though. I added a teaspoon of lemon extract to the batter. Now those were awesome cookies!!!

This is a great pignoli cookie. Sometimes I can't believe the reviews I read. Someone actually complained that this cookie is too almond-flavored. Come on, what did you expect from a pound of almond paste? This recipe is easy to make; it, however, requires that one does not skimp on quality. Accept that this cookie costs a lot to make; make the cookie with love and generousity and enjoy the results.

I don't know what happened. I used almond paste however not in can. The paste was sweet already, however I followed the recepie and added sugar. I followed the recepie exactly. The cookies totally went flat and lost their shape.I could not even scrape them from the pan. I had to trash the whole batch. :(

cookies are delicious, party of six agreed. the problem is, though it's not a huge one, is almond paste is $5 for an 8 ounce can. there must be a way to make your own for far less. oh yeah, don't eat too much batter as you are making them or you won't have enough for your guests.

I looked everywhere for canned almond paste and finally found what I thought I was looking for, a can of Solo brand almond filling. I assumed that almond filling and paste were the same. WRONG! The filling was too sticky, not dry enough, and the cookies were a flat, sticky disaster! If I can actually find canned almond PASTE, I will make this recipe again.

These were fantastic! I used the pastry bag to pipe them and found that very easy. They all came out the same size and it made exactly 42 cookies. I served these at a baby shower and received many raves. I will definitely make again.

Have made pignoli cookies in the past and wanted to try a new recipe. I found that the cooking time was off (used thermometer so I know the over is correct)and the heat was too high to thoroughly cook the cookie without burning it.

I HAVW BEEN MAKING PIGNOLI'S FOR ABOUT 5 YEARS NOW, WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT RECIPES, GUARANTEED TO BE GREAT AND YOUR RECIPE IS BY FAR THE VERY, VERY, BEST I HAVE MADE. THE REASONS I LIKED YOUR RECIPE IS THE EASE OF THE RECIPE, THE RESULTS WERE MAGNIFICENT. THE COOKIES STAYED SOFT AND DELICIOUS FOR SUCH A LONG TIME. ON REQUEST, I MUST HAVE MADE ABOUT 6 EXTRA BATCHES. THE ONLY INGREDIENT THAT DIFFERED FROM THE OTHER RECIPES WAS THE MILD HONEY!!!! THIS MUST HAVE MADE THE DIFFERENCE. I HAD NO TROUBLE TAKING THE COOKIES OFF THE PARCHMENT, THAT WAS MY PREVIOUS PROBLEM. THE ONLY THING DIFFERENT THAT I DID WAS TO USE THE EGG WHITES SOLD IN CONTAINERS. I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO MAKING THIS RECIPE ALL YEAR LONG !!!!

Great recipe. I also did not pipe them but placed them with rounded teaspoonfuls on parchment and with dampened hands smoothed them before placing the pignolis on top.

These Pignoli Cookies have starred on my dessert table many times this holiday season. Everyone who tastes one, goes back for another, and another. Since there is no butter or flour in this cookie, a friend who is allergic to both dairy and wheat will be getting a batch for her birthday.

These cookies were awsome. Just like the Italian bakery! They are costly and time consuming to make though but worth it for a Christmas cookie tray (or Easter or any holiday tray). I couldn't pipe the dough or drop it easily so I sprayed my hands with cooking spray and gently rolled them. It worked perfectly. I also made them slightly smaller to yield more from the recipe. Everyone loved them.----To the cook from NY--I can't believe Dean & deluca didn't have almond paste. I find it in any grocery store in the baking aisle near the canned fruit fillings. SOLO is a brand thats commonly sold on the east coast.
