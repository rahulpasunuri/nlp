Not bad, but a bit too buttery and overly sweet for me. For all of those who complained that this came out crumbly and powdery, it's because you cooked it past the softball stage. Your thermometer may have read 238 degrees but it may need re calibrating. If followed properly, this turns out ridiculously creamy. I tasted the fudge after adding only a cup and a quarter of powdered sugar and found it way too sweet. I'll prob simmer a cinnamon stick in with the butter and sugar next time.

This is delicious penuche, but I had quite a time making it! I hope my errors save someone else from the same mistakes. First, I used too large a pot, so my thermometer wasn't immersed and I had to tip the pot up to get a reading -- not ideal. Second, I didn't test my thermometer in boiling water -- turns out it was 10 degrees off. The result? I overcooked the fudge and when I beat in the powdered sugar, the whole thing crystallized magically into grainy clumps resembling butter cut into flour for pie crust. But I was determined to win! So I reboiled it with a bit of water and cooled the pan in water in the sink (to 110) and then beat it, as in more traditional fudge recipes I consulted. This didn't work the first two times, ending up runny and not crystallizing at all (OK, I was crazy-stubborn), but it did work the third! So to all you other novices out there, persevere ... I didn't achieve perfect texture but it did make squares. BTW, if you do end up with the grainy stuff, you could just remelt it and save it as delicious caramel sauce for ice cream. I was really tempted to do this but driven to make fudge at all costs. I probably won't make this again till I get a more appropriate size of pot.

I'm so shocked that this recipe worked out for me- I have very limited candy experience. I've made brittle and marshmallows once before and I was fully prepared for this recipe to be a mess and to just chalk it up to a cooking lesson but not at all- it turned out great. The key is definitely to follow the directions EXACTLY- it says 238 for a reason, not 235 or 245 or whatever. I used the 1 1/4 C powdered that some others recommended and I still found it sickeningly sweet, so next time I will cut it down further to 1C. It's ok though, because one is not meant to eat a whole pan of this at once- a piece or two will do. Overall a great recipe- good flavor, good creamy, non-grainy texture, appealing appearance- and I will add it to my holiday repertoire.

yum! This was wonderful. It took a little bit longer than I expected to get those last 10 degrees of temperature, but it all came together just as it should. The only thing I wish is that when cutting it, it would have gone into nice even squares. Oh, well- maybe using the wrong knife? It was so delicious, the batch intended for my husband's work never made it out the door and my sister in law requested it become a holiday tradition. Currently making a third batch- to replace the ill-fated employee batch :)

Is my idea of "smooth, velvety, and creamy" completely different than everyones? The description of this fudge seemed to fit what I was looking for but I just made it and it definitely wasn't smooth and velvety but rather dry and powdery. I did reduce the confectioner's sugar down to 1 1/4 cup as suggested but I was really hoping for a soft melt in your mouth type texture. The flavour however was nice. I did change it in that I omitted the vanilla and instead added whole roasted garlic cloves to the mixture and removed it before it fully boiled. I was trying to replicate a roasted garlic fudge that I had at a garlic festival...weird, I know. The taste came close but the texture was far far off.

The other night I wanted to make fudge and grabbed a recipe from a cookbook - It was terrible. Afterwards, I realized that I usually use confectioners' sugar, not granulated and knew that other ingredients were missing. With my mother travelling right now, I couldn't call for her recipe, which is very similar to this one. I have called her for this recipe repeatedly over the years, but it always gets mis-placed - very frustrating. Now I don't have to wait until she returns from her travels - I will have my fudge.

i am obviously not an experienced candy maker because this turned out terribly and it's all my fault. first, i don't think my thermometer was working properly or maybe it was positioned incorrectly because it reached 225 and then back down to 200 even though i never changed the heat. the mixture started looking reeeeeally dark and smelling a bit burned so i did the drop-in-water test and it was hard-crack, not softball. yikes! so i scooped it off the heat into the bowl of my mixer, but i only have a kitchen aid with metal bowl (definitely not heatproof) and the mixture just didn't come together. it turned into a grainy dry crumble that looked like dark graham cracker crumbs or something. not good. very sad. i was really looking forward to trying this and giving it as holiday gifts. oh well.

I took into consideration other reviewers' comments that the fudge was way to sweet, and reduced the confectioners sugar to 1cup. I STILL found it very sweet: but not excessively so. And the texture of the fudge was perfect with 1cup of confectioners sugar.

I made this as written, with the toasted pecans, and thought it was excellent. Very sweet, yes, but the texture was everything I've always wanted in a fudge...will definitely try some of the variations that other reviewers mentioned!

I have been making this recipe for the past three years and love it! I just pulled out my well used hand written version and noticed that I had written and been using 12oz of butter not 12 Tbsp. I have been doubling the butter since the beginning with great results, a rich, creamy well structured fudge that was not to sweet, go figure! I may try it both ways this year, but then why ruin a good thing, Ha!

I modified this one because I was looking for a good chocolatey fudge recipe. However, this was all I could find. While simmering the brown sugar and the butter, I tossed in some scharften burger chocolate powder. Along with the chocolate, I put EXTRA vanilla both during the initial mixing of butter and and sugar and the blending process. When adding the confectioner's sugar, I also added some red wine. Altogether, these gave it a great taste and made it more chocolatey-smooth.

I make this recipe with maple extract instead of vanilla. It's a huge hit!

Excellent penuche fudge! If you double the recipe, it will take approx. 35 min to reach 238 degrees on the candy thermometer.

This is a fantastic tasting candy I usually double the recipe and use a 9x13 pan. I have been asked for the recipe many times.

i've made this a bunch of different ways. Made it as written - very good! Also made it adding cayenne, black pepper and cardamom (1/8t each) and pecans, AND w/ 50% light 50% dark brown sugar, 1 1/4c confectioners, 2T dark rum, cinnamon, cardamom and cloves (1/8t each). Pretty awesome and popular any way you do it.

Overly sweet and bland, probably due to the confectioners sugar (and I used less than the recipe called for.) This just doesnt have the depth of flavor I expected. Ill make my Moms penuche next time.

I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan. I think because I doubled it, it took longer than 30 min to get it to the soft ball stage. I also may have had my burner set too low. I used 2 cups of powdered sugar instead of the full doubled amount. It was plenty. The fudge is caramel-like but more sweet. It's very good but really really sweet.

I've been trying to perfect penuche since I was a kid, working with my grandpa's recipe, which I no longer have. Most fudge recipes call for way too much corn syrup, which makes icky, frosting-textured fudge, which I hate. This one, however, gets the texture right on the money -- not too grainy, not too slimy/smooth, just firm and very VERY tasty. I too cut down on the confectioner's sugar - using maybe 1-1/4 cups TOPS - which was fine. The second time I made it I also doctored it a little with an addition of a little spice and some heat from cayenne powder. And I always add more pecans than called for - toasted - because I like them (obviously, this is a personal preference). Yum-bo!

Yummy! I used only 1-1/2 cups of icing sugar as suggested and it turned out creamy and smooth. I found it only took about 15 minutes to reach soft-ball stage rather than the 30 minutes noted in the recipe.

this recipe is the best ive tried for fudge and i agree with other comments i used 1 1/2 cups as well delishious better than all the other fudge recipes

I was very pleased with the results of this recipe. The fudge was smooth, creamy, and somewhat soft (just as I prefer). I conflicted as to how much confectioners' sugar to use, as the recipe called for 1 3/4 cups while other reviewers suggested using only 1 1/4 cups, so I split the difference and went with 1 1/2 cups of sifted confectioners' sugar. That amount worked well for me-- no powdery mess, just delicious fudge.

Thanks to everyone who noted to cut down on the powdered sugar, it made all the difference in the world. I'm in love with this recipe and will make it forevermore (much to the chagrin of my favorite candy store).

I can't rate the recipe, because, I, too, ended up with a big powdery mess. Albeit, a big powdery mess with a great flavor! I'm not sure what I did wrong, I meticulously monitored the temp.

A good recipe! However, I'd follow the advice below. I made it according to the recipe and with the reduced amount of powdered sugar. Both times I added the toasted pecans. The second way was much better than the first. I also subtituted dark brown sugar for the light. I liked the richer carmel taste. Would definitely make again with these adjustments.

I didn't rate 'cause I was left with a big powdery mess, but I think it was all my fault. I had my burner to high and let the mixture heat up too fast. It smelled slightly burnt. Obviously a confectioner (sp?) I am NOT! Experts, was too high heat my problem???? The recipe sounds so good, too!

Reduced the confectioner's sugar to 1 1/4 cups as suggested. Added 3/4 cup of toasted pecan pieces to fudge and pressed 1/4 cup on top. OUTSTANDING!

This recipe is to die for!! If you love butterscotch, you must make this. My only regret is that I did not make a double batch. Followed the recipe, except you must sift the confectioner's sugar or it does not dissolve well. Also found that 1 1/4 cup confect. sugar was enough. If you don't want it to crumble you MUST line the pan with parchment paper. Make sure you work quickly pouring it into the pan, it hardens very fast. It was so super easy to make, so cheap and so good I will keep this as one of my holiday hostess gifts.

I'm sure glad you have these reviews available. They not only affect my choices of recipes, I love having the different points of view. On this fudge recipe, I remembered at the last second that a reviewer said the only bad thing about her experience with it was that SHE DIDN'T DOUBLE THE RECIPE. I took it to heart & doubled it right off the bat. Was glad of it; used it at a large Thanksgiving dinner. Rave reviews. It was also the first time I ever made fudge before.

I added several tablespoons of dark rum to the recipe, as I found the mix one-dimensional in its absence. The fudge's texture is more appealing after refrigeration because the confection pushes back against the mouth and remains on the tongue longer at that temperature, which does not overly dull the richness and the taste. Although I did not have any issues regarding powderiness, I am pondering adding an ingredient that will layer in another taste without detracting from the fudge's thick smoothness--perhaps finely ground pecans or hazelnuts.

I tried this and it was a big, powdery mess. Is the recipe flawed?
