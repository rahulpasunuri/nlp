I have made this recipe several times and they are always a hit. If you have trouble cutting these or any other brownie, try using a plastic knife. For some reason it seems to collect less as it goes through.

This will become four forks once I eliminate the salted peanuts. Believe it or not, the peanuts seemed to detract from the richness and taste of the brownies. Otherwise, a superior recipe.

These were certainly fudgy and tasted better once they cooled (and they were easier to cut). The coffee added depth to the chocolate. I cooked for 40 mins. I cut them into 20 squares which were big enough as they are rich. Only one problem - can't stop eating them!!

Baked and extra 7 1/2 minutes, but I think they could have been pulled at 38-40 minutes total. I am not a chocoholic, but I am serving them at a picnic tomorrow, so we'll see. P.S. I cut them into 16 small squares b/c they are very rich.

I have made these brownies a couple of times per year since the recipe was published and they are wonderful! They disappear quickly when I bring them to work.

A big hit with my dinner guests. Having a repeat performance tonight. Simple and delicious!

I would leave out the chopped peanuts next time, but otherwise I loved the peanut butter flavor; even made a peanut butter sauce to put on top. Also, much better the next day or just sufficiently cooled/chilled. i found 35 minutes was enough time for fudgey fudgey brownies.

I baked these in a glass dish (didn't have a metal pan) for an extra 15 minutes and they were still raw in the middle and too done on the outsides. They did have a nice chocolate-peanutty taste but very very rich!!!

Wow!!! These are amazing. I have made them 3 times now and they just get better. I cooked them 10 minutes longer than the recipe said. Try them while they are still warm. I'm surprised there were any left for my guests!!!

Delicious! Very rich and fudgy. I made it in a 9 X13x7 pan and it needed about 55 minutes to be done. Yum.

Excellent!, my boyfriend loved them.. I used 8oz peanut butter chips instead of 10oz. and bake them 5-10 minutes more... Delicious!!

I wrote and asked for a copy of this recipe it was so good and I had lost my copy! I've waited for it to show up here, when I didn't get a reply. I do remember adding less peanut chips too, but it was so chocolately yummy. I'm glad to get it again!!

Just excellent. Make sure they are cool before sampling because they soooo rich. In fact to me they taste best slightly frozen.

A Few Adjustments can be made. I found it interesting reading some reviews that people needed to cook these longer. If I make these again, I will use 5oz. of the Peanut Butter Chips, instead of the recommended 10 oz. I found the Peanut Butter flavor to be a little overbearing. For my particular oven, I think the bake time could have been reduced 5 to 10 minutes, from the recommended 30-35 minutes. I cooked them for a full 35 minutes, and they came out somewhat dry.

These are among the finest of rich, dense, dark, fudgy brownies. You definately need to cut into smaller squares - even if you are a chocoholic.

What a wonderful brownie recipe. So rich and gooey. Texture was beautiful. I used parchment paper in my pan. Did not stick at all. Served a scoop of vanilla ice cream when brownies were still warm..... The BEST!!!!!!

I had to try this one to see what all the fuss was all about. I baked them for 39 minutes and decided they were just right. My mother, children, husband and self all thought they were just about the best brownies we had ever had. I guess I'll have to keep buying those peanut butter chips!

This was a winner at my house. Very Rich. Perfect for chocolate lovers. I cooked it for 40min and that was to long, I think 30-35 min is perfect. I used the peanuts as a middle layer and topping. Sprinkled top with powdered sugar. Great recipe!

Not as good as it sounded but okay, I had to cook for about 50 minutes but that may be the high altitude.

Wow, this got raves from everyone who tasted it. Required 35 minutes baking time. Important to cool well before cutting. Suggest it serves 12 to 15 people as it is very rich.

After reading the reviews and because I live at 8500 ft, I added an additional 1/3 cup of flour. I had to bake for 40 minutes. The brownies were more cake like and my family loved them. I might add a little less flour next time to get a more fudgy brownie.

All of the ingredients looked as though they would make terrific brownies. However, the baking time was nearly double and when I attempted to cut the brownies they completely fell apart into a gooey mess. I doubt you can overbake these brownies, let alone serve them in neat squares. After all of that; who cares what they taste like?

These brownies received fantastic reviews. If you don'y over cook them, they come out with a fantastic fudgy center. And with the peanuts and peanut butter chips, these aren't your Betty Crocker box mix!

Very, very rich. A little goes a long way. You definately have to cook longer than 35 min. Closer to 45 min. Perfect for a choc-o-holic.

Fudgy, luscious, and just the right amount of peanut flavor, to still allow a major jolt of chocolate. I will add this to my collection of brownie recipes, because it is unique enough to not be a clone of my other chocolatey versions.

I am constantly in search of the perfect brownie and this is the closest I have come. The peanuts offer a nice crunch and the flavor is very rich and "chocolatey". I did not bother to chop the peanuts, and I sprinkled some on top to decorate them. Prep time for me: 20 minutes.

A delicious recipe but took several minutes longer than the 35 stated.
