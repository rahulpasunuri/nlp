Hate the pickles and SUGAR. for hors doeuvres..I have a caviar pie that never goes uneaten. I mashed avocado, 3 tbls red onion, chopped, mix 6 hard boiled eggs with 3 tbls mayonnaise and spread over. finish with 100g jar of lumpfish caviar serve with sesame seed crackers.

yuck. I have several renditions of this treat and this is the only one I would never make again. What is with the pickles? Caviar and pickles? and cream cheese? and sugar!? Such a travesty.

Since receiving the January 1996 issue--I have made this fabulous Caviar Pie every Christmas and any other holiday that I can. Just try it, and you will see why my family views this as a traditional holiday food.

Have been making a different Caviar Pie recipe for many years and always loved it. Decided to try this one for Easter (you just gotta have an egg dish at Easter!) and although it was good, it just did not measure up to my original recipe. If you are looking for a great variation on this theme, try this: Using a 10" ceramic quiche pan or deep dish pie plate, spread a layer of avocado mashed with a little lemon juice, salt and pepper until smooth. Sprinkle with minced red onion or thinly sliced green onions. Whisk an equal amount of softened cream cheese and sour cream together until smooth and gently spread over avocado/onion layer. Force the hard cooked eggs through a coarse sieve, evenly sprinkle over cream cheese layer and gently pat down. Cover with saran and refrigerate for several hours. Just before serving (to prevent bleeding), arrange black caviar on top in a loose/open spiral fashion - a rather fiddly/fussy step, but you could make a pattern/template as another reviewer brilliantly suggested. How come I didn't think of that before?! On occasion, I have added finely minced parsley to the spaces between the caviar. Serve with a sliced baguette and/or cocktail pumpernickel. Delicious, impressive, attractive and always garners copious compliments. The avocado and sour cream make all the difference! Enjoy!

A huge hit any time of the year! Everyone asks me for this recipe. I use the already sweet "vidalia" onions and omit that step.

Easy to make and deserves every word of praise it receives.

This dish always gets a lot of compliments--it's very impressive in presentation. My husband came up with an easy of designing the caviar. He took a file folder and cut it into strips. He arranged the strips into the design we wanted. Much easier and more creative then hard-sided cooke cutters. The strips create a border so the caviar is straight. We did ours like a sun--with rays being different colors (including the parsley). It sounds complicated, but with the cardboard strips it was easy (just takes a patient hand to spoon the caviar). Also did a heart in the middle (in orange caviar) and the black surrounding it on either side, with accents in yellow. Even the caterers were impressed!

I made this for a champagne tasting and it was a big hit! It is easy to make, yet impressive. I used shallots instead of onions and served with toasted french bread per another reviewer's recommentation. Wonderful! The hardest part is finding decent caviar in different colors.

Okay, to start -great !! Easy, Elegant, Easy to create. Delicious to eat. Gets raves, esp from caviar lovers! I put the cream cheese on the bottom, egg mixture w/o onions next, I use chopped scallions next layer. Last, I put the caviar on. No ying yang sh-t! Using a poaching ring, cookie cutter or any circle thing,I put black caviar on the outside, and then I put red caviar on the inside of the ring, removing the ring and filling the small space made by the ring. Parsley all around the outside mostly for garnish. I then buy a good baguette or two and toast (broil carefully) ever so slightly. Much better than crackers. Again - YUM!!!!

I made this for New Years and it was a BIG HIT. The yin yang design was beautiful and easy to do. Lots of people asked for the recipe. For such an easy and relatively inexpensive recipe it makes quite a splash, especially for entertaining.

The only changes I make are layering the onions right above the egg mix (it's prettier) and using the original cream cheese (better texture). As for the top, I do the yin-yang also, but since it gets expensive in black and red or black and yellow, I border in parsley and salmon roe, leaving a smaller space for the expensive stuff. It gets raves!!!

To the person who had trouble figuring out a design for the caviar on top of the pie: try a simple yin-yang design. Reserve a little bit of each color to put a "dot" of color on contrasting caviar. I made this recipe for an office party, did the yin-yang design, and everyone thought I was on my way into catering!

This is quite good, but I found making an attractive presentation with the two colors of caviar harder to do than it sounded.

Not only is this a beautiful presentation, but it is delicious! Even "I don't like caviar" people tried it and loved it.
