Everyone loved this at our 4th of July party. Although I skipped the bread & added the garlic & cayenne right into the sauce. Delicious!

I love this recipe. I have made this several times and everybody loves it and asks for the recipe. I didn't change a single thing.

This was wonderful, although I took the liberty of adding a couple of cloves of minced garlic in with the vegetables because it cried out for it. And, being a girl who loves things spicy, I added more cayenne than it calls for. We LOVED it. Fun to have a New Orleans recipe that isn't the standard Jambalaya, Gumbo, Etouffe, etc. A winner!

Huge hit at our Mardi Gras party last night. I had a lot of people so I just doubled the recipe and also added a little roasted garlic to the sauce. Had to print out extra copies so many people wanted the recipe! Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was sensational. It won great accolades from our dinner guests. We had a couple of guests that "can't take the heat" of even moderately spiced foods so after serving the rest of us, I added a bit of 35% cream to the remaining broth and it toned it down beautifully. Definately a keeper!
