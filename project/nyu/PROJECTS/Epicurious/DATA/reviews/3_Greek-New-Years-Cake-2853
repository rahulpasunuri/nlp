My wife and I made this cake and it was fantastic! It comes out the consistency of a soft shortbread. Delicious! Make sure you let it cook the full time (unless you know your oven runs hot). It's great with a nice vanilla or chocolate ice cream.

This cake tastes good (like pound cake) but unless you like a really dense cake, the texture is terrible! The batter is much too thick for whipped egg whites to be of any use in lightening it -- there's too much flour and too little leavening power. It turned out really dry even though I baked it for 20 minutes less than the recommended baking time. Other than that, it was a "fun" cake to search for the coin, but I must say far better versions of this cake exist.
