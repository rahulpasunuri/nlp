Have a recipe very similar to this (that tastes way better! Added; 1 tablespoon honey, 2 teaspoons minced onion (or 1tsp gran onion pwder), 1 tea celery seeds... increased both the mayo & sour cream (to equal 1 cup). I also drain my cabagge, put colander in a bowl; place cabagge in colander; sprinkle generously with salt, let stand for about 20-30 minutes, rinse cabbage off & drain well, using a paper towel to drain off excess liquid before adding the dressing.

It is an OK slaw; but it lacked in taste. I added more salt (about 1/2 tsp) and 1 tbsp sugar.

Crunchy and delicious both times I made it-- with and without adding cilantro. I could have eaten the whole bowl!
