THIS RECIPE WAS OK, I JUST THINK THERE ARE BETTER COLD BEET SOUP RECIPES OUT THERE.

I've made this a few times, always successfully. It's easy, light and delicious. I usually don't bother with the cucumber.

A refreshing, easy soup that still impressed my guests. I'd make this again in a heartbeat.

A simply delicious, elegant soup I have served several times. We had it first for Easter dinner as our opener followed by the smoked salmon canapies. It set off the entire meal.

We made this for Easter. Everyone loved it. We will make it again and again. The orange juice is the secret ingredient. We used fresh beets. We will add cabbage to it next time as an experiment.
