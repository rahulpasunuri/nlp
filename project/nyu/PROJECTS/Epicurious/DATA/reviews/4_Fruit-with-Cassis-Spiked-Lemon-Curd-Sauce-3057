Just not that good. After reading the other reviews, I started with 1/3 c. lemon curd, but it lacked flavor. I added more (slightly less than 1/2 c. total). It had enough flavor, but the lemon curd dominated the creme fraiche and the cassis. It's not bad as a dip for fruit (ends up being quite thick) but nothing special

I have made this my easy and really delicious go to dessert. I mix the lemon curd with marscapone cheese. You can vary the amount of the cheese to get to the level of sweetness that you want from the lemon curd. Plus use whatever fresh fruit you like. I have substituted in blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, halved seedless green grapes and they have all been wonderful with this.

Wonderful flavor as well as quick and easy. Have mixed the lemon curd with lemon yogurt and vanilla yogurt, among other things and served on top of all sorts of fruits. Have never had a problem with too much sweetness -- probably depends on the lemon curd used.

I recommend starting with less than a 1/2 cup of lemon curd. After following the recipe exactly, I had to reduce the overwhelming sweetness by adding more creme fraiche and yogurt. I now have enough sauce for 10 people. For a party of 6, 1/4-1/3 of lemon curd seems more appropriate. I will definitely make this recipe again with modifications.

You can use any fruit combo. I added Kiwi, green grapes, and raspberries. This is a fantastic topper. I used creme fraiche.

What a wonderful, quick sauce for any fresh fruit combination! Have used sour cream, yogurt and mascarpone with the lemon curd-liqueur mix. All excellent. Bought lemon curd keeps a long time in the fridge - invest, save time and enjoy multiple salads.

I was looking for something fast and easy for our dinner party and this was a total hit. I made it using creme fraiche.. Not one drop/bite left. I can't wait for the summer berry season to arrive so I can experiment with different combinations Update- made this after the above party for my husbands golf group dinner ( all men) and once again,not a drop left.
