Cookies are ok. I wish I'd read the reviews before making. I would have followed the advice to increase the peppermint in the dough. I put some peppermint extract in the melted chocolate like other reviewers recommended, and I think that was a good move.

I was called on to make a cookie we wanted to call "Thin Mitts" for an election night event (in support of Obama, mind you...!! Make no mistake about that!) I was thinking I would do a chocolate shortbread and make it mint flavored, but found this recipe. Wish I had read reviews...they are kind of right. Very dry cookie and not enough butter to act against the flour and egg content to make them rich tasting. Also, this yield is WAY off. If you indeed make 2 inch diameter cookies and cut them to 1/4", you get about half the yield the recipe indicates. This cook apparently can't measure!

I make these every year for the holidays. Aside from doubling the mint in the recipe and adding mint to the chocolate -- they're perfect. They're a cinch to make. And, they're delicious!

These cookies are terrific once you tweak the recipe. INCREASE peppermint extract to 2 teaspoons of more. UNDER BAKE!!! Bake about 8 minutes just until set. I then freeze them. Take from freezer and dip the cut side into the dark chocolate. You can add additional peppermint extract to the dipping chocolate if you want a VERY minty flavor. Zig zag with white chocolate to finish! A HUGE XMAS TREAT FOR ALL OF MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS. I have been making these since they first appeared in 2002. After the first batch I realized the correction needed! MAKE THEM LIKE THIS!

Just a suggestion for those wanting to make Thin Mint like cookies... Add peppermint extract to melted chocolate. Dip Ritz crackers in melted chocolate. Let cool. Optionally, you can drizzle chocolate (red and green, or white, etc.) over top of cooled cookies to make them pretty. I received these at a cookie exchange this past Christmas - everyone loved them.

Wish I had read on where several reviews said how dry these cookies were. Not worth the effort. Gave them out anyhow and everyone agreed...way TOO dry. Not like thin mints at all!

Great. My friends thought I bought them already made.

I used Scharffen Berger non-Dutch process cocoa and 2 tsp of peppermint extract. The cookies were delicious and got a great response from friends and coworkers. Two minor problems: First, after chilling overnight, I could not smooth the dough logs as recommended. That was okay because I'd shaped them nicely before baking. Second, the chocolate drizzled over the cookies makes the edges uneven. I'm not sure what to do about that. It's not a big deal, though.

YUCK! Dry Dry Dry ... my husband who will eat anything chocolate and mint didn't even like them.

I actually was looking for a substitute for Girl Scout Thin Mints, as I'm trying to eliminate trans fats. My boyfriend is the cookie aficionado, and it took a few adjustments to get this to a satisfying conclusion: We bake the cookies a tad longer so that they are actually crunchier than the original recipe, more like boxed cookies. I also doubled the amount of peppermint extract, and tripled the vanilla. I've made this to give as gifts two Christmases in a row, and both years have been asked for the recipe. The only reason I don't give it four forks is that just drizzling chocolate on top isn't quite as satisfying as a very thin layer of chocolate all over. But since tempering chocolate is so tricky, this is a good substitute.

I made the recipe as written. I sliced mine too thick, so would definitely keep them thinner next time. As to the chocolate, at first, I, too, thought I had made a mistake. But it's not the chocolate or consistency that's the problem. The fork must actually swing back and forth. Try the technique right in the pan with the melted chocolate first. The chocolate won't drizzle/drip off your fork, but it will come off in strings if you swing it. - As to taste, these were good. Not great, but definitely a keeper, and something people will remark on.

These cookies are dry and boring. I even cooked them for shorter than it says. Messing with rolling/cutting them isn't worth it.

Tasty. I skipped the frosting part and the cookies were wonderful.

I tried this recipe because I LOVE "Thin Mints" They did not dissapoint me. I used the suggestions to double the mint in the recipe and sliced them thin. I used a knife to "frost" them front AND back with melted mint chips (or you may add peppermint flavoring to milk chocolate chips.) These resembled and tasted like the GS cookie and got rave reviews, too.

Very disappointed in these cookies - and I love thin mints. Couldn't taste much of a similarity myself. Definitely need more mint if you're going to try them.

I have these cookies stashed in my freezer right now in preparation for Christmas, and it takes everything I have not to eat them. I think this is a wonderful recipe, but drizzling the chocolate takes some practice. My chocolate drizzles don't look anything like the photo. Maybe next year. BTW, I agree that a little more peppermint extract couldn't hurt.

I sliced them thicker than the recipe suggested and they were terrific! My friends think I have broken the thin mint GS code! I did add 2 extra drops of mint to make the taste stand out and chilled them a long time.

My recipe turned out exactly like GS thin mints. The trick is to double the amount of peppermint extract in the dough (as other reviewers have said), add about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. of peppermint oil (it works better than extract) to the chocolate (I dipped mine instead of drizzled), and be certain the dough is very firm when cutting it (make the dough and form it into the log shapes then refrigerate at least overnight). Also decrease oven temp 25 degrees if using dark cookie sheet like Caphalon. This way the cookie is thin and perfectly round.

I had a very maddening experience while finishing the prep for these cookies last Christmas. The chocolate which I melted wouldn't get anywhere near the consisency required to drip off the tines of a fork. I actually dumped a few batches directly into the garbage pail, as a result of my anger. But throughout the next 3 days, I scoured my city for a bag of mint chocolate chips, and finally found some (I learned that they are at a premium around Christmas). I melted the entire bag and dipped the remaining cookies halfway into the melted chocolate - what a delicious solution! These cookies were absolutely scrumptious, and numerous people requested the recipe. For those who don't think these are minty enough, finish the cookies with mint chocolate instead of what the above recipe calls for - you will not be disappointed, and you'll love these cookies.

these are NOT thin mints. We found them to be mintless. very disappointed.

I loved this recipe. Found it to be just chocolatey enough. I would add a touch more peppermint next time. Perfect to have in the freezer for the occasional chocolate treat!

GS Thin Mints they are not, but still good. Good texture and not too sweet. In fact my husband thought they weren't 'minty' enough.

I thought these cookies were great, although my kids wouldn't agree. I loved the chocolate-mint flavor and the fact that they were not too sweet. It didn't matter no one else liked them; I ate them all myself!

This was well liked by my co-workers - the mint was a refreshing change to our ongoing cookie challenge.

I made them for the office Christmas party, I thought they were delicious - and I don't like Girl Scout thin mints!! I used the Scharffen Berger cocoa powder and drizzed them with some bittersweet Valrohna - and they were decadent! I think I ate more of those cookies than anyone else!! I will make again. The hardest part was slicing the cookie rounds thin enough before baking.

Nothing special about these cookies!

Oh my gosh. My mom and I ran across this recipe more than 15 years ago in a magazine (don't remember which one) and we made these cookies and absolutely loved them. Unfortunately the recipe disappeared and I had been searching for it off and on since. I am so excited that I found it again. Better than the $3.00/box of GS cookies.
