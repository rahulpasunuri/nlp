We found this to be really dry.

We have eaten this dish at Ford's Filling Station and loved it but for some reason, never thought to make it until we saw the recipe. Using Trader Joe's ingredients, we took quite a few shortcuts and it came out divine. We turned it into a pizza with premade dough. Make sure to cook the leeks, onions, and shrimp in the same pan (at different times) to add to the flavor. My husband marinated the shrimp briefly in lemon, garlic, EVOO, and salt/pepper before cooking. We also used TJ's white bean hummus instead of making our own and used their mixed organic microgreens on top. Grated parmigianno reggiano and rosemary provided a delicate crust over the pizza. We cooked dinner for our friends who have a new baby and they are looking forward to the leftovers!

Made this recipe for my husband. He has made it abundantly clear many times that he did not like hummus but I figured he would never know the difference with all the different toppings. I used store bought flatbread, looked more like pita bread but the end result was fabulous. I am planning on making it for our next Memorial Day get together. My husband is still raving about how good it was.

I went shopping and forgot to buy a lemon so that part with the lemon slices was left out. I had lemon juice in a bottle at home so it was used in the humus and I followed all the other directions. This might be my favorite recipe of all time.

I hosted a ladies lunch a week ago Monday and this was my main course. However I used Jeff Smith (Frugal Gourmet french bread recipe) for the flat bread. I served this with Caesar salad. Apple spice cake (on this site for dessert. Everyone was very impressed great flavors and textures. Using this recipe again on Tuesday.

Hummus recipe is great, try adding balsamic vinegar for a nice twist.

This is exceptional!!! The house smelled amazing!!! I prepared the hummus and flatbread the day before. This made cooking the onions,leeks, and assembling very simple. I didn't want to spend $9 for a tablespoon of tahini, so I used organic peanut butter instead, and the hummus was amazing!!! On first glance this recipe seems a bit odd, but all of the elements come together and have wonderful depth of flavor. This would be outstanding as an appetizer or as a main dish with a salad on the side. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I must have done something wrong, but instead of bread dough I got batter. I put in the stated amounts of water, flour and oil, but ended up adding scoop after scoop of flour to make it come together as a dough-- anybody else have this trouble? I'm not leaving a fork review because this is probably just me being inept.

Exceptional recipe, a little on the long side if everything is prepared together but, even with some shortcuts (ahemmm... i forgot the leek ;) and bought the bread) is really tasty! Will try to cook it again, correctly this time.

This is really easy if you take the advice of the other reviewers and buy the flatbread and hummus. I used naan for the bread, and ful medammes, which is an Egyptian hummus made with fava beans. One thing, onions need more than 12 minutes to carmelize. I usually cook them for at least 20.

I didn't make the entire dish, because I just needed a white bean hummus recipe. This is the best white bean hummus I have ever had. I will making the entire recipe soon.

Excellent! Made this exactly as the recipe called for - time consuming, but worth it! Will definitely make this again.

This is the best receipe for white bean hummus. The vinegar makes it pop. Next time I will add more rosemary.

EXCELLENT - time consuming but worth it. To save time, buy pre-made Naan shortbread (I used garlic) and pre-made hummus spread. Boiled gulf shrimp then tossed in mixture of olive oil, pickapepper and honey to make sweet glaze. Also use some mozzarella cheese for "gooey-ness" and Parmesano for sharp taste. Dont skip the lemons! Also added yellow and red bell peppers for color and texture. Sautee onions in brown sugar and garlic for even more flavor. TOTAL HIT!

Exceptional - even with my short cuts. While I'd love to do the whole home made recipe (and I will some day) this time I used Tandoori Naan bread (thanks to that reviewer) and Trader Joe's hummus. Even so, it was totally excellent. This dish was a trial run for a cocktail party I'm having in a few days & it was a HIT with tonight's dinner guest. Also, I used the greens for a salad. Thanks Ben. I can't wait to try it at your restaurant.

do I cook the flat bread first?

This was awesome! Didn't change a thing. Will definitely make it again. It's really nice to be able to make most of the toppings ahead of time. Served it on the deck w/Mojitos.

This was a delicious and different appetizer. I used wheat naan flatbread that I purchased. Omitted the leaks for the sake of simplicity. I used frozen shrimp that I thawed, grilled and chopped before adding to the top of the flatbread. The thin slices of lemon were a great addition - don't skip that step, just cut the lemon paper thin. I added more lemon juice, water and oil to the hummus to thin it down (but I also used canned garbanzo beans instead of white beans). Will certainly make this again - especially when I plan ahead and do a lot of the work the day before.

This is FABULOUS! It was a little bit more than what I wanted to take on at 7:00pm, but it was worth it. I was a little afraid of the sliced lemons, but they proved to be one of the things I loved the most. I will make this time and time again.

Having just watched the Chef Ford Video on prepairing these the included recipe fails to note the roasemary bean hummas is spread on the flatbread prior to layer lemon and shrimp et al on the Nan bread
