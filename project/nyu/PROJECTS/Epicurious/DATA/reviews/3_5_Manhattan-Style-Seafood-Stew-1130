Based on the other reviewers comments, I reduced the amount of liquid to 2 cans tomatoes & 2 bottles clam juice. This was just right for the amount of seafood called for. To get more texture into the stew, I hand-squeezed the tomatoes (the most fun & messy part of making this dish!) into the pot. Once the potatoes were added I removed a portion (approx 2c) of the base and pureed the lot so that it would have a good stew-like consistency. How much you puree would depend on how thick you wanted the end-product. And as with any seafood recipe, the quality of the shrimp & shellfish are KEY. Definitely a make-again recipe.

I did not like this dish. I do like this prepared more Italian.

After a couple of tries with the shellfish suggested in the recipe that never turned out that well(the sauce was always fabulous, but I had trouble getting the clams to steam properly without burning the sauce), I resolved to just use other seafood and forget the shellfish...Well, I made this last weekend, for eight, with shrimp, scallops and a big mess of sea bass ... my guests almost fainted this was so good. Genuinely great recipe.

I made this stew for a dinner party thus doubling the recipe. Two additions I made were fresh crab meat ( added at the very last minute ) and some dark molasses ( to taste). The molasses was added to tone down the spiciness of this stew.I also used Pepper Bacon in my base and believe it made a difference. Some reviewers have said that this stew was watery but I found that by making the base earlier in the day, simmering for several hours, removing from heat and then reheating it made a difference in the thickness of the base. I received rave reviews on this stew-------everyone at the table asked for seconds and some even asked for thirds!!!!!!!!!! This recipe is definitely a "keeper"!

This food was great.But we used mussels instead of scallops and we put roasted baguettes underneath it.I would make it again,it was great!

I have been making this recipe since I first saw it in Bon Appetit. I have served it to dinner guests over the years, they all loved it. Some have returning dinner guests have actually requested that I fix it again for them.

Comfort food supreme! I modified the combination of fish/shellfish according to what was most readily available with excellent results. I particularly like the fact that this is a relatively quick dish and worthy of company as well as family.

Took Jamie Doyle's advice and added some fresh fish (cod), oysters, and more shrimp than the recipe called for. Actually added some celery and green pepper as well. A big hit during the NFL playoff games!!

Very tasty and hearty. The bacon gives that sauce a great taste. I would cut down on the amount of sauce or add more fish to serve more. We ended up using the sauce for 3 subsequent dinners and just added more seafood to the sauce to simmer for a few minutes. I would definitely make it again.

A really excellent dish. Just about defines how a "Manhattan" seafood dish should be. The lemon peel really lifted the dish. Serves 6 people generously, rather than 4.
