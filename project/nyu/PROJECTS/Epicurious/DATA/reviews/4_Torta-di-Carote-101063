i love stuff like this -- excellent for people who can't eat wheat. wonder what this would taste like with beets instead of carrots.

To the Cook from Los Angeles (3/24), grinding up whole almonds tends to yield more. In other recipes calling for ground almonds, I start with less of the whole almonds than the amount of ground almonds called for. Grinding 1.5 cups of whole almonds should yield approx. 2 cups of ground almonds. Hope this makes sense :)

organic carrots from Whole Foods could not save this recipe. I thought it was vile,could not even swallow the first bite. fed it to the disposal. I am an accomplished baker and find it hard to believe thta everyone else is raving. Guess that's why Baskin Robins make so many flavors.

I notice a discrepancy between the amount of ground almond called for in Joyce Goldstein's cookbook (2 cups of ground almonds) and the web version (1 1/2 cup of whole almonds, ground). Can any bakers suggest which is the better amount to use?

Has anyone tried putting a traditional cream cheese icing on this cake? for those who have tried it, would it go well?

Don't fret about the carrots. I made it twice (one with regular carrots) -the carrots do make a difference, but not enough to avoid this great recipe because you can't find or don't want to pay that much for them. First time I used a tube cake pan, second time I used a bundt pan. The bundt pan worked best. I served the cake made in the bundt pan and with the better carrots during Passover, and it was all the rave, even from people that have access to excellent Passover baking. Plus, it gets very high marks on nutritional content.

I've made this cake 4 times and am making it 2x next week. EVERYONE LOVES it. I even made it for a non-holiday dessert. I did find at Trader Joe's (ground) almond flour (instead of toasting and grinding them myself) and used organic baby carrots (also from T.J.'s). I usually also add raisins, dried cranberries and chopped walnuts. Definately a winner -

I'm not so into carrot cake but everyone seemed to enjoy it. I couldn't get organic carrots but maybe I just lucked out in getting tasty regular ones. I don't know if I would make this during the year but its a good passover recipe.

I have made this recipe every year since it was published. My kids expect it, and even request it when it is not Passover. I put a paper star in the middle and sprinkle icing sugar over the top to finish it off!

Yes- She could not find the right carrot. If you have something helpful to say , say it. Otherwise you should keep your not so nice thoughts to yourself. Cooking is a process, both in preparation and in learning where to buy your ingredients. Great Recipe!

If you can find them, I recommend using the long, red Japanese Kintoki carrot. They are a lot sweeter than our western orange carrots (also good for carrot juice). They're even difficult to find here in Japan, though.

To Sue in Seattle: I too live in Seattle. You can't find "the right carrot?" Good grief! We have the largest farmer's market in the country (Pike Place Market) with the very best of vegetables (organic and otherwise), meats, fruits, fish, the best imports from all over the world - you name it!!! And you couldn't find the "right carrot?" Someone needs to go back to cooking 101.

This is a wonderful dessert - don't wait until passover to make it. I used organic carrots and it turned out well.

It is hard to find the right carot.
