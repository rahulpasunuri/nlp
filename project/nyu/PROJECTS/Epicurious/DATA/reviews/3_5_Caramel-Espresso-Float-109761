Couldn't find the instant espresso, so used additional, premium grade instant coffee. I would suggest using cold espresso, omitting the second cup of water, but still using the ice cubes. Pretty easy dessert that turns out wonderfully.

This float made a wonderful and refreshing end to a summer meal. I did cheat a bit for time constraints, but it still turned out wonderful. I used pre-made dulche de leche, mixed in water with the espresso powder (enough to make a little over 2 cups). But, still used the whipped cream, toasted almonds, chopped Ghiradelli choc. YUMMY!! Will certainly do again!

Haven't made this yet, but a little tip about the caramel. It would be faster, and a LOT easier to buy caramels, such as Crafts, melt them and follow the rest of the recipe.

It's a great refresher for the summer time. Very creative and very cool.
