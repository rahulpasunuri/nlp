Was excellent. I was concerned that the shellfish would overcook if cooked for twenty minutes, but everything came out perfect, including the smaller than recommended shrimp I used. The only complaint I had was that it was a little messy with the 2 inch pasta. Too small to twirl, but big enough to flap around. Will probably use orzo next time

This was delicious, quick to prepare, and surprisingly suitable for guests (a friend dropped in as we were serving it up, and it served 3 no problem). I used what I had already purchased at the market -- shrimp, mussels and littleneck clams -- feel free to substitute, as it's all about the fried/simmered/baked pasta and the broth. I used linguine, broken into 2 inch lengths and it made the dish a little more hearty, which helped stretch it for 3. I must suggest adding clam juice to the broth/wine mixture, as it ties it all together beautifully. My artichokes got a bit mushy, but they were jarred, so perhaps frozen would hold their shape better. My personal taste preference leans toward a bit of garlic, despite authenticity issues, so next time I make it I'll throw a few whole cloves in while it's baking. Very tasty; I highly recommend! Enjoy.

I really liked this. I made 10 ounces of pasta - to have leftovers for lunch. 4 1/2 cups of liquid was too much, next time I would use 4 cups.

My whole family enjoyed my version of this meal. We just got back from vacation and I didn't have time to go shopping for the correct ingredients so I had to make do with what I had on hand. I used spaghettini for the pasta and giant prawns and salmon for the seafood. Being Canadian (used to the metric system rather than imperial)I had a hard time figuring out how much 6 ounces of pasta was. I ended up underestimating and had a lot of broth left over at the end. The broth was so good that my son and I ate it up with a spoon at the end of the meal. Mmmmm.

I hate to burst Dugas's culinary bubble, but this is actually a decent rendition of a quite popular Spanish dish, fideua. Fideua is similar to paella in its seasonings-- using short pasta instead of rice-- fideos, to be precise. The traditional paella doesn't actually have any garlic, so don't feel as though you are disregarding the Spanish tradition-- you aren't. Spanish cooking tends to be milder than that of its neighbors. This looks like a nice recipe that I intend to try, just as soon as my saffron-hating husband takes a business trip.

I've been making this dish since the recipe was published. My family loves it. I keep the seafood very cold until putting it in the pasta; perhaps that keeps it from overcooking. It's important to use good quality seafood and good olive oil. I also use marinated artichoke hearts for more flavor: If you can find Balducci's brand, they're great. I add a small clove of finely minced garlic when browning the pasta. I add a pinch of cayenne and about a 1/2 tsp. salt (might add less if using chicken broth with salt). The dish takes no time to make, and I think you get great results from little effort!

Call this anything, but don't call it paella. It is so far from the Mediterranean, it could be from Hong Kong. It has no heart, it has no soul; it has no garlic and onions; which is the very essence of Med. cooking. Please, at least one clove of garlic!

I had such high hopes for this dish. The results were dismal. The flavor was bland. The shellfish was cooked too long. And I will never use frozen artichoke hearts again. They have no flavor. If you must make this, use marinated artichoke hearts and put the shellfish in at the end of the baking time. 20 Minutes at 400 degrees is to long for scallops and shrimp. The only reason I gave this one fork is that I couldn't give it zero forks. Next time I'll just open a box of Rice a Roni.

I have made this dish several times, and enjoy it every time. It has become our traditional New Year's Eve dinner. The two things that I think are especially important are the browning of the pasta in oil, and the use of plenty of chives, which adds a wonderful flavor.
