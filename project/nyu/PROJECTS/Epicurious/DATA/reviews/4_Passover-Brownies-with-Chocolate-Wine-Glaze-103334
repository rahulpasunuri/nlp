I am not Jewish but I made these brownies for my boyfriend's dad's birthday and everyone was raving they were so good. I used butter and flour instead of margarine and matzo meal. They were simply amazing.

Fabulous! Made it for 2nd nite of Passover and it was "gone" shortly after it was put out. Put out a second which had not been glazed and it was gone too.

i made just the glaze for some chocolate chip scones. it was exquisite, although i did use the butter instead of the margarine. i also substituted a drier wine - crosspoint pinot noir. i almost drank the glaze out of the pan, it was so good!

I love these brownies. I made them last year for passover and even people who complain about flour-alternatives loved these brownies. I caught the hostess in the kitchen licking the glaze off the plate... She made me swaer i will bring them again next year (tonight) so off to the kitchen i go...

I made these brownies without the glaze, and they were the best brownies I've ever made. They are moist and chewy, yet cakey. If you don't like a strong orange flavor, use less orange zest.

None of the guests at my seder thought these were anything special and I was happy I had two other desserts on hand. I thought the matzo meal taste was very distinctive and I really wish I would thought to leave the orange zest out. Too tangy with the chocolate. The wine glaze wasn't bad. I might try that again next year, but will go back the Engel's passover brownies. A truly fabulous recipe...and not just for passover.

Yum! First time I bake a passover treat that doesn't come in a Manischewitz box...and I'm greeted with delicious results, even without the glaze. You can't tell that these were made with matzo cake meal! A new favorite on my passover menu.

These were great!! They didn't taste like they were made with matzah meal at all. Just beware that the frosting never really hardens.
