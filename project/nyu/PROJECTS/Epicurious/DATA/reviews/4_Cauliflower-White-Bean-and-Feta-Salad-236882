Outstanding with just one change: steam or blanch the cauliflower. I've also substituted thinly sliced fennel for the endive. I reduced the salt, but that is just my preference. Very satisfying dish!

REDUCE THE SALT to 1/2~3/4 tsp! That "1 1/2 tsp salt" must be a typo. I omitted the endive (I find it bitter) and served the salad over baby spinach instead. Delicious.

I think this is a wonderful recipe and I will make it often. I skipped the endive due to cost and I don't really like it. I added fresh chopped asparagus to up the veggies. Used some of the Rancho Gordo Vallarta beans instead of the white ones because that is what I had and started from dry. Used green onions instead of chives cause they are more versatile and cheaper. I thought it was too salty last night but today it is perfect and great. A lot of the reviews steamed or blanched the cauliflower - I just broke it up in very tiny pieces and it is great. The lemon and vinegar soften it. Yummy!

I did not follow the recipe exactly, but what I did make was fantastic and will definitely make again. Used 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary, blanched the cauliflower, used arugula instead of endive, used chick peas instead of white beans, added more feta used 2T sliced green onions

This is one of my favorite epi finds--it's light, flavorful, and easy to make. I find that it benefits from a night in the fridge to let the flavors blend; it makes great leftovers and I will frequently make a big batch and use it in work lunches all week. One time I was out of feta and used a plain goat cheese; that was also delicious.

Excellent summer salad. As is, I would rate it three forks, but if the cauliflower is partially cooked (steamed or parboiled) then the dish is a four fork recipe. Make sure the cauliflower is in small pieces. Also, significantly increase the rosemary.

I made this salad on a whim, in spite of the fact that I'm not crazy about any of the individual ingredients. I'm trying to get more beans into my diet though, and this has been a great way to do so. I steamed the cauliflower although the recipe didn't call for it; I just don't particularly like my cauliflower raw. It worked out great, with just the right consistency. I let my salad marinate in the fridge overnight, and the flavors really soaked in. I've been taking it for work lunches all week, and eating it with different additions; my favorite so far has been a half an avocado, but also good with crackers, and leftover quinoa. Overall, super easy, healthy, and flavorful. I will definitely make this again.

I have made this recipe twice now with great results. I should note that the first time I made the salad I was a slightly disappointed because some bitter flavors appeared. I took the advice of others below and used about 10 times more Rosemary, also I was a bit indiscriminate in which parts of the Belgian endive I used. I think both of those elements contributed to the bitter twang. The second time around, I used only 3 times more Rosemary than the recipe and was very careful not to include any of the rosemary stem. Also, the second time around I was very careful about which parts of the endive I used. I would recommend tasting as your slicing the endive to make sure you don't inadvertently include any overly bitter leaves. Otherwise, great, healthy salad! Be sure to serve it in a brightly colored bowl so that the color contrast pops.

This was a really nice salad. I didn't have rosemary, so skipped that part and cut the oil back to 1/4 cup. I also blanched my cauliflower for 30 seconds, then shocked. Nice flavors!

Wonderful and tasty salad! I too blanched the cauliflower, which helped accentuate its sweetness a bit. That worked very well with the lemon and vinegar in the dressing

I've made this several times. I kick up the rosemary and lemon juice a notch and insist on fresh sheep's milk feta. Quite tasty.

I really love this recipe. It's also great for making your own variations. I like to add anchovy to the dressing. Meyer lemon is a great substitute for regular lemon when you have it available. I like to barely blanch the cauliflower just to take the raw edge off -- 20 seconds and then into the ice water. Also parmesan or pecorino are great in here, as well as toasted pine nuts. I don't think you can go wrong with this dish.

Rating: 4
I made this as printed except that I only had half the amount of endive. As suggested by others, I blanched (well, more than blanched, because I got distracted) the cauliflower. I used canned navy beans but didn't experience the mushiness some other reviewers described. I accidentally mixed the toasted pepitas from another dish in. The dish was good without them and amazing with them. I'll definitely make this again.

I made this exactly as prescribed, and I liked it quite a bit the first day- but the next day I found it less flavorful and the texture less pleasing. I'm not sure how that works; it's the antithesis of everything that I know as a cook. fyi- I blanched the cauliflower, and soaked dried beans. Worth trying, I think.

This was just good all around. The combination of textures was splendid. I did everything but add the vinegar. I thought the lemon brought enough tartness. Man! A new favorite!

I don't see the need to blanch the cauliflower. The most critical part is to taste the endive before adding it,because if it is bitter it will ruin the salad.

Delicious! I made the following substitutions with good results: blanched cauliflower, fennel (for the endive), goat cheese. I would recommend cooking your own beans, as the canned beans were a little too mushy for this dish.

This was easy, delicious and healthy. I hate canned or jarred beans and didn't have time to prepare from dried beans - so I used Israeli Couscous instead. I chopped up about 6 medium shallots, sauteed with a light amount of olive oil until browned, added the dried Israeli couscous until browned. Then added 2 cups of boiling water. As that simmered for 8 minutes, I (BARELY) steamed one large head of cauliflower (al dente), then added to the couscous -shallot mixture when done. Instead of endive, I used 2/3's head of radicchio. Added a few green onions and parsley, made the dressing as directed -- using a good cabernet sauvignon red wine vinegar. Then added the feta and mixed... then added some more feta! A big hit at home and at a holiday gathering. Saved it to my recipe box with these changes.

This recipe is so delicious, there is only ever enough for leftovers the next day! I often substitue the feta cheese for a milder goat cheese. It's always a hit at parties, too. It's the only dish I have found that my husband actually LIKES to eat cauliflower!

Rating: 4
This recipe seems simple but really is as good as the other reviewers state! I used half the dressing (and cut the salt way back) since I had only a small head of cauliflower (microwaved for ~1 min) and a small head of fennel (very thinly sliced, subbed for the endive) from the CSA box. Used canned cannellini beans (a bit soft, would be better with home-cooked beans). Omitted chives and resisted adding garlic. It definitely needs the feta and should sit at least an hour to blend flavors. The taste was superb- light, lemony, refreshing and healthy. This recipe should be versatile to sub other veggies. Would be great as a vegetarian main dish with crusty bread.

I liked the recipe, but I used canned beans. (I am not the type to soak beans overnight!) I felt the texture was too soft with the cauliflower and will use chickpeas/garbonzo beans next time. I also do not like endive and used Napa cabbage, and I thought that was a nice substitution.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe-- it has become one of my go-tos. Because of the hardy ingredients, you can make a double batch and have leftovers available for several days. This is an easy one to improvise with if you don't have all the ingredients on hand. I also made a variation with cauliflower, endive, thinly sliced radishes, scallions, feta and loads of fresh chopped parsley and thyme. Dressed with lemon, red wine vinegar and olive oil. Perhaps even better than the original!

comment for others - i used canned cannelini and they were fine. if you are going to parboil the cauliflower (i wouldn't, just cut it small) be sure it is cool before you add anything else or it will be mush.

this is really good - but to make it a lot prettier use either yellow or purple cauliflower. terrific, good enough for company.

Delicious! I substituted cabbage for the endive, because I couldn't find fresh endive. I also didn't follow the recipe for salt; just seasoned to taste. The flavor of this dish definitely improves overnight, but the salad doesn't keep long after that. Gets rave reviews! Cutting the cauliflower is a little tedious, so have a worker bee standing by.

Excellent! I have made this recipie three times already in the past month. Flavors are great and winter white colors make a nice presentation. I have blanched the cauliflower as recommended by other reviewers and like that it takes some of the rawness out of the cauliflower but still leaves it crunchy. Great as a side dish or as a between meals snack.

This is a great salad!! I made it exactly as written except for taking the (good) advice of others and cutting way back on the salt. No need to blanch the cauliflower, just make sure the florets are small. Made it in the morning and by dinnertime it was outstandingly flavourful. A great salad to have on hand over the weekend because it keeps so well. I will make it all year round.

I loved this recipe! I did blanch the cauliflower and did not have a problem with it affecting the consistency of the beans. I haven't used endive too much in the past, I now add it to my side salads. I also did not add as much salt as it called for.

I made per recipe using Great Northern beans, and blanching cauliflower for about 90 seconds. I was underwhelmed to say the least after my initial tastes. The texture was awful - in part because the beans did not keep their shape and were just starchy mush clinging to the cauliflower. There is also little to balance out the bitterness of the endive. On day two the flavors melded a little better, and I liked it a bit more, but only just. I would not make this again.

Fabulous recipe but way too much salt.

I liked the contrast of flavors with this salad. For lack of suitable Belgian endive, I used frisse, which was complementary in terms of color contrast and taste. I did not use 1.5 teaspoons of salt, just a couple of generous pinches of kosher salt. The next time I make this recipe, I will not grate the lemon, but peel and mince the lemon. For me, at times, the finely grated lemon peel was a bit too much.

Rating: 4
I don't like bitter flavours, so I used fresh fennel root instead of endive. I steamed the cauliflower and fennel first and then mixed it all in. I can't believe the recipe says 1.5 teaspoons of salt! I used less than half a teaspoon and it was enough! The salad was absolutely delicious!!

I expected to love this recipe since I love cauliflower but the mix just didn't do it for me. I think the canned navy beans is what ruined it. i usually make my beans from dried beans and I don't like them to be mushy. The canned beans were horribly mushy. I would like to give this salad another try but I will do my own navy beans or use chick peas instead. Canned chick peas seem retain a better texture.

Love it! I've made this recipe several times now. I even have it as the main dish; its that good. This is especially telling since I don't really care for cauliflower. To reduce the fat, I cut the oil to 1/8 c. and used 1/3 c. reduced-fat feta and it still tastes great.

suprisingly good salad. The crunch of the cauliflower goes well with the soft navy beans. I also added more lettuce. I think the key is the lemon zest. Delicious!!!!

Made this as directed, but added just a bit more parlsey than called for. It was easy and delicious, although I wouldn't call it "mild flavored." The feta and red wine vinegar gave it some zing. I did make it a day ahead (which some folks suggested), so maybe that impacted the flavor. Matched nicely with grilled salmon.

Great concept, pretty and fresh tasting, though it was a little on the bland side for my taste. I'd probably add a little bit of garlic or onion next time, not too much though because it would overwhelm the delicate mix of flavors. Maybe just in the oil with the rosemary. With the crunch of the cauliflower I felt like the Belgian endive, which is a bit hard to come by and not cheap where I live, was superfluous and not really noticeable. I might leave it out or substitute artichoke hearts, fennel, something with a little more zip. Also I will make this salad a day ahead next time as it was much tastier the next day. Leftovers make a healthful and filling brown bag lunch.
