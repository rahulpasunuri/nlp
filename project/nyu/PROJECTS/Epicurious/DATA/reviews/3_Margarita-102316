Haven't tried this one yet, but a good variation for a hot summer day is a frozen margarita made with Cruzan Banana Rum instead of tequila. Careful though -- it's really easy to gulp them down.

I will try this with some of the advice from others. For those who like frozen margaritas, my favorite recipe is 1 can Frozen Lime concentrate, 1/2 of that can tequila, 1/3 of that can triple sec, ice and lime juice. You just put the lime concentrate in the blender, then fill the empty can with the tequila and then triple sec. add the ice and lime juice (to taste--I use about 1/2 lime) and mix. They are awesome!

The key to a good margarita is more the tequila than the recipe. A good tequila for margaritas will add a distinctive flavor and a bit of heat yet still blend with the sweetness. A margarita made with Cuervo Gold will never be that good. One made with a great silver tequila, like Don Julio or El Tesoro, will have a distinctive character. Another key factor is limes. In Mexico, especially in the southern areas, I have had many margartias made with tequila, lime juice and triple sec, and they tasted delicious. At home, I had a lot of trouble getting anything like the flavor until I discovered limas dulce (sweet limes) that are available for a few months a year, at least here in California. They have a very different lime flavor, and make the perfect drink. When they are not available, I use tiny Mexican limes, similar to key limes, that come close, but find that I have to add some simple syrup to get the right balance. Also, instead of Triple Sec or Cointreau, try Citronge, which is available at Trader Joe's for a reasonable price.

This is a good margarita. Although I substitute the lime juice with a mixture of sugar, fresh squeezed lime and lemon juice.

I love bitter, harsh drinks that make my eyes water and throat burn - this one's for me! San Diego is where the real margaritas are made.

Tried this recipe and a few from around the internet. This one was close but stil too bitter. What seemed to be right on was 1 shot glass lime juice, 1 1/2 triple sec and 2 shots of tequila. Pour over ice.

Great if you just want to get drunk quick, otherwise not so good. You might want to add some sour mix or something else to give it some taste.

I made this last night for a group of friends, and it was not a hit. It was too strong - not a recipe I would make again.

Like many others, I used this recipe as a starting point. (Based on one of the reviews below, I bought both Triple Sec and Cointreau. I was expecting the Cointreau to be much better, but after tasting both I couldn't tell much of a difference.) After making the drink exactly as specified, my husband and I decided to increase the lime juice to 2 tablespoons and to blend the drink with crushed ice. To us, this made the concoction fabulous, but we're used to blended margaritas. In the end, everyone was happy. A little too happy actually, I was pretty drunk by the end of the evening! We're planning on making these again soon!

The TRUE traditional recipe from Margarita herself: 1 part lime juice, 1 part cointreau (NO triple sec - yuck!), 3 parts silver tequila. Stir well, serve on the rocks. NO SALT (but that's a matter of taste). Two of these and you'll find yourself dancing on the furniture with a lampshade on your head! A touch of Blue Curacao adds a nice color, for those looking for panache in their margarita!

I am presently making Chicken and Green Olive Enchiladas accompanied with a Guacamole side dish. This drink compliments this so well and is so smooth, I can't wait to have another excuse to try it again.

Margarita is my favorite drink. This is about the best I have had.
