This recipe is a favorite. Easy to make, and very tasty, not too sweet, with a nice crispy top (at least when they're fresh. If you store the leftovers the tops soften up.). I usually make the mistake of mixing in all of the crystallized ginger from the ingredients list, instead of half of it, but the flavor doesn't suffer at all. I've never bothered with the glaze. Particularly when made in giant muffin cups, these are so filling they don't need any more sweetness! Highly recommended as a fall and winter breakfast staple.

My changes were: Added: 1/2 cup applesauce Reduced oil to: 2 T. oil Added: 1 t. cinnamon Added: 1/2 cup chopped pecans They were very moist and delicious. I also used fresh pumpkin puree I made.

Excellent! These muffins are very moist and have just the right amount of ginger and molasses. I added walnuts to mine but otherwise followed the recipe as written.

Fantastic! So sinfully delicous that they seem more like a cupcake than a muffin. If you like gingerbread you'll love these! I used regular dark molasses.

These muffins are absolutely great. Perfect texture and very moist. While everyone is 'fessing up to their substitutions, I'll give you mine. In the spirit of the season, I substituted egg nog for the buttermilk and added some nutmeg along with the powered ginger. If you make the jumbo version, they are a whole meal.

These muffins were great!! However, the glaze needed a little bit of help. I added cinnamon and ginger to the glaze and molasses. It turned out wonderfully. I will definitely be making these muffins again =)

This is such a great recipe! It is quick and easy. I made it alittle healthier by adding half oil and half applesauce and also instead of 3 eggs I added eggbeaters and then 2 eggs. They are moist and have amazing flavor! I will definitely make them again.

Not that good. Okay, but there are better muffin recipes out there. Make sure you chop that ginger into small bits.

This was so incredibly easy to make I omitted the crystallized ginger and used more ground ginger, nutmeg and allspice instead. The result was fabulous!

This is one of our fall favorites, and tastes a little more strongly (but not in a bad way) if you use black strap molasses instead of light). I replace 1 1/4 of the flour with whole wheat. 1/2 the oil with apple sauce, and 1/2 tsp. of the ginger with pumpkin pie spice. I also add a an extra 1/4 cup of crystalized ginger chips than called for and skip the glaze. Great with dried cranberries in them too.

Just made these muffins and we love them. A few changes: roasted butternut squash instead of pumpkin, organic whole wheat flour, and some cinnamon. Delicious!

This was a great recipe. I omitted the crystallized ginger and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of ground cloves. Instead of the glaze, I made some cream cheese frosting. I also made mini-muffins which took about 15 minutes to bake. Served them at Thanksgiving and they were a hit!

Rather a nice cake than a muffin, but a good cake. I used half rye flour and cut the oil in half, subbing 1/4 c applesauce instead. Added fresh cranberries at the end for some zing and to counteract the sweetness, and sprinkled a crisp topping (oats-flour-sugar-butter) over the top for some crunch. Even with the reduced oil and increased fiber, I got a lovely, springy, super-moist cake. Not pumpkin-tasting, true: but is anything, really? It all tastes like the spices in the end, in my opinion. ; )

Made these with whole wheat flour. Good flavor, but dominated by ginger, not pumpkin. Tastes like good gingerbread and not too sweet...the glaze really adds a lot! Overall, these were good, but not as "pumpkin" muffins.

i just finished making these and havent added the glaze yet. i would agree that the predominant flavor is ginger, not pumpkin. i like them because they aren't too sweet and they have a very nice texture. i also used half whole wheat flour and added some raisins.

these muffins are great--very moist and not overly-sweet. even with just a simple sugar glaze they are great.

These came out perfectly. The glaze and crystallized ginger are easy to add and really take them from "good" to "wow".

These muffins are delicious, even without the glaze (I was interrupted during the process and couldn't apply it), although I'd love to try them with the glaze and ginger. Dried cranberries would be a nice addition to the batter as well, and perhaps something crunchy, like toasted pecans.

They were good and very easy to make.

These muffins are wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly and used standard muffin pans. My toddler and my husband love these and they freeze well- perfect for those very busy mornings.

Very moist and yummy, I will add raisins or some other dried fruit when I make them again.

AMAZING! Moist, tender, a far cry from the usual lemon-poppyseed or blueberry. i have used this recipe for mini-muffins and "normal" sized muffins, as well as the giants. This is a quick, easy people pleaser. My sister loved these, and she doesn't even like ginger. i used blackstrap molasses for a darker flavor...yummy!

I really like these muffins although I did make a couple of substitutions. I used half white flour; half whole wheat flour. Instead of mollasses I used honey, and instead of the crystallized ginger, I added cinnamon, allspice and a little nutmeg to taste. Very tasty, and these are still good after being frozen for a few weeks.

good, but not bowled over. i'll probably try something else before i make this again.

I've already baked these muffins on two separate occasions; made once without the glaze and they were just as good. My husband loves them. Freeze beautifully.

Just delicious. I added a medley of golden raisins, dried cranberries, dried blueberries, and chopped walnuts. I did not put on the topping.

Very yummy flavor, nice moist texture. I really loved the zing of the crystallized ginger. I'll probably double the ginger next time I make it. Nice pumpkin flavor. With ginger as the only spice I thought they *did not* resemble gingerbread or pumpkin pie, which can be easy to default to. Took muffins to a holiday brunch and everyone loved them and asked for the recipe. Will definitely make again.
