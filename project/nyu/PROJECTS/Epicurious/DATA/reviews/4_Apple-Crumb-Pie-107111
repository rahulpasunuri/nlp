Excellent! I followed the recipe, other than to change the 3/4 c walnuts to half walnuts and half pecans. I will do this again next time! I made the filling 2 days ahead and reheated it before filling the pie. I tried baking a crumb pie on request from my in-laws, and it was so delicious that I am sure this will become my new go-to recipe for apple pie. The crust, apples, and crumb make this the perfect blend of apple-pie and apple-crisp! ...and you could totally get away with a store bought crust. The rest is that good!

This was the best decision I ever made. Especailly served warm with vanilla ice cream! I did make a few revisions: Used a pre-made 9 crust  baked for 10 minutes before adding filling Used water instead of apple cider, Used some kind of red apples that I picked instead of Granny Smith(6 large = 3 ¾ pounds but was way more than I needed, would probably use only 4 or 5 next time) I didnt use walnuts because my family doesn't like them, but it probably would have added nice texture. Im pretty sure you could make individual serving in those little baking dishes w/o the bottom crust and it would be good. The crust got a little soggy so I might not use it next time (plus I can save on calories that way)

Perfect way to use the apples from our trip to the orchard... Apples were all mixed up - so I used a nice mix of varieties and it was delicious! My son helped, his slices were thick cut mixed with my thinner cut slices giving a variety of textures. I loved the flavor but did add some golden raisins. The crust was easy to work with and came out yum. LOVE the topping but opted for an addition of a little cinnamon plus added more walnuts - you can never have too many nuts!! Will def make again since I love the fact the filling is pre-cooked which keeps you from baking it too long protecting the crust and topping from being overdone. Enjoy with some vanilla ice cream :P

This is the BEST apple pie recipe ever! The crust is easy to work with and light and flaky. Its just a perfect recipe. I make this pie after apple picking in the fall and I use the best apple cider and homemade applesauce. The pie takes a while to make (especially when making two with all those apples to peel and core and I have a peeler/corer!), but it is well worth the time!! I make this exactly as written, except I don't pre-bake my crust and it comes out great.

Oh! I forgot but I also replaced the walnuts for the pecans for the topping and it definitely made it better! A nuttier flavor to it but not too much to cover the taste of the apples. To save time, I used pre-made crust.

It was a good recipe; however I will try it with a bit sweeter apples as someone suggested using Braeburn apples.As usual the topping was THE BEST!!! I could not stop pinching pieces of the it before and after I baked the pie! I added oatmeal to the topping mixture and it made it crispier!! I will definitely bake this again!

I used a store bought crust. Saves time and work. I added a table spoon of instant Tapioca pudding to the filling. Makes a great binder and the sweeten up the filling. I also omit the walnuts. Make this all the time!!

I made this apple pie for Easter - fantastic! Made it exactly per the recipe except I used store-bought crusts (Marie Callendar) which I pre-baked per instructions. The recipe filled two 10-inch crusts. Will definitely make this pie again.

Fantastic. I had to make extra crumb topping, but otherwise... my goodness.. I don't even like apple pie and I ate this up!

My first apple pie so I took a shortcut and bought 2 ready-made deep dish pie crust. Instead of using walnuts I replaced with graham cracker crumbs for the crumble and I also used both pears and apples. Made two pies and they came out pretty good!

I have made this pie many times and used the crumb topping when make a traditional apple pie as well. The crumb topping is the best part of this recipe.

Someone should review these recipes before posting... piecrust needs to be cooked at`425 degrees... and how are you making clumps without something to hold the mixture together? Increase the flour to 1 cup and rub in 1/2 cup cold butter... then you have crumbs!

Great pie. I used my own pie crust (all-butter pie crust from cooks illustrated) and a mix of granny smith and braeburn. Just sweet enough, and the crumb topping was terrific. Like other reviewers, I had enough filling and topping to put in a separate dish which my kids loved

This pie turn out to me Amazing!!! We all loved the crispy-nutty top. The crust was kind of hard to work with when rolling it and transfering it to the pie pan, I am not sure if this is because of the recipe or because this is my first time cooking pies. At the end everything was really good, excellent flavour!!!

great apple pie recipe. the filling was delicious. the applesauce added a nice texture. pre-cooking the apples was a great idea. topping was perfect. just enough. i used my own pie crust recipe.

A great pie - I also had extra filling and crumble, so put in ramekins - easy and good for those who don't want the crust!

I made this for thanskgiving, I was looking for a crumb topping which came out very good. I don't think I used enough apples thou. I used a bag and one add'l apple. I think I'd use more next time. I liked the tartness of the pie. First time I cooked the apples prior to baking. I will definitely add this to my receipe box.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was delicious. I am also from Montreal, the only thing better than this pie is Rockaberry's Apple Crumb :) It was my first pie and I would make it again. I found the crust a bit flaky to work with, but it could have been my poor job at rolling it out and into the pie dish !

This is a real keeper. It is one of the best apple crumb pie I've made. I added 1/2 tsp of lemon zest to the filling and followed the rest of the recipe as written. Restaurant quality! Definately 4 stars. Another 4 star recipe is in the Nov 2005 issue, the apple pie recipe. AMAZING!!

i have made this pie multiple times and it has always came out good. i did melt the butter for the crumb part. it's super easy to make.

Even with the substitution of a ready-made deep dish pie crust for the bottom, this pie was plate-licking delicious. I used a bit of oatmeal in the crust as well, and I think it contributed to the crunchy, nutty goodness. A winner!

I am not a fan of apple pie, but this is a really good pie. REALLY GOOD!! I think the crumb topping is what does it for me. I will be making this again soon. Oh, I used Gravenstein apples for this reciped - not sure if it makes a difference. I think they a better apple than Granny Smith.

Great crust. I used lard instead of the vegetable margarine. I also used canned pie filling I had made.

this is a great recipe, especially for those who like apple crisp. I want to share what I added to this recipe to make it even better: put a scoop of good quality vanilla icecrean and drizzle icecream, pie, and plate with warmed caramel or butterscotch syrup. this makes it look elegant and taste great!

I used my own blind-baked crust. Other than that, I followed the recipe and thought it was as good as any apple pie I have EVER had. I had some filling and crumb topping leftover which I baked in a separate ramekin. It was just as good as the pie, so another time, I'd probably skip the step of blind-baking a crust and just fill and top individual ramekins. They are also easier to reheat and serve.

This was my first apple pie (other than tarte tatin). It was so easy. I love the half butter half shortening crust. One alteration, I used apple butter instead of apple sauce. It added a nice depth of flavor. This is now my apple pie staple.

I was disappointed with the recipe. While the recipe was not difficult, unlike the others who reviewed, I found it very time consuming. I also did not like the applesauce in the pie filling.

I thought this was a great pie. It was a nice change from a basic apple pie. I used a variety of apples, MacIntosh, Royal Gala and Granny Smith. I would definately make this again.

A very simple pie to make. It stayed fresh and moist for several days after baking - the only change I would make would be to use my own tried and true pie crust recipe - this one I found slightly difficult to work with. I will definitely make this pie again - maybe adding more cinnamon next time.
