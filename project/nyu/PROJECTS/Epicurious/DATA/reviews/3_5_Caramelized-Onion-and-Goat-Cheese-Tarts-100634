Yum! Added some chopped mushrooms to the onions mid-caramelization and substituted white wine for half of the water. Crowd pleaser as an hors d oeuvres

This was really tasty in my opinion. I did increase butter to 1 and 1/2 tablespoons and seasoned the onions with salt and pepper. We had this with a simple salad for dinner. Will make again for sure.

This is an EASY delicious appetizer. I used Puple Haze goat cheese by Cypress Grove (Whole Foods) and it made it even better. The herbed cheese added a higher level of complexity.

Easy and delicious appetiser for a dinner party. I used one red and one white onion for more colour and doubled the amount of fresh thyme. I also found that it needed a bit of salt to bring out the full flavour of the caramelised onion. Will make again!

I've been making this recipe for 4 years and have great success every time. As mentioned by another member, used a little bit more butter in the custard. Also use puff pastry which adds a nice buttery tone to the appetizer. Lastly, have always made it 1 week ahead and freeze uncooked - then cook the day of my party! Very easy!!!

Easy to make. I mixed some cream cheese in with the goat cheese.

This didn't work at all. It was easy to make, but the goat cheese and the onion didn't blend at all, and the pastry just kind of fell apart around it. It was like eating three separate things - nothing melded together.

This was easy and delicious. We have made other tarts and this on was so easy and just wonderful.

Yum. I really liked these. It's a very easy recipe that comes together very quickly. It's nice with a salad for a light meal or as a starter. I think the amount of pastry was just right--it's only 1/6 of a sheet per person.

This was good, but needs some fiddling. I used puff pastry cups (2 packages, 12 total cups), as several have suggested. While it certainly made it easy, there was WAY too much pastry for the filling. They were also too big; I would rather they were "finger-food". Next time I will make the recipe as written. It may be fussier, but I think the size would be better, as would the pastry to filling ratio. Good flavor, although nothing revolutionary. Who hasn't had some variation of this? This stays in my recipe box for a few reasons; it's very easy, and when making a big appetizer spread, that counts for a lot. It looks really pretty when topped with the thyme. And it's a crowd-pleaser, I don't think there would be many out there who don't like it at all.

This was a lovely combination of flavors. Next time I make it, though, I would make a few changes. Half way through baking, I will pull out the puff pastry and split it open, put the filling in, and reclose, so the cheese melts. Then I will put a little creme fraiche or something like that on the top. But overall, easy and wonderful the way it was!

Made these for appetizers, and used triangles of puff pastry. I would try the cups next time as others have suggested. Pressing down the centers was a fiddly and messy business. These are SO rich! I can't imagine eating the first course serving recommended.

The ingredients sounded delicious, but some of the reviews put me off. So, I skipped the puff pastry, made a regular pie pastry, tripled the filling part of the recipe and made one large tart. It was delicious. I would definately make this again -- either as one tart on regualr pastry or individual puff pastry cup. It got rave reviews at a Thanksgiving party.

THis is a great hors d'oeuvre. Just cut the puff pastry (why are other reviewers talking about phyllo? And filling, for that matter - this isn'e a quiche...) into bite-sized pieces, and cut up the carmelized onions (be patient, reviewer from Holland, any onion will carmelize over a low, slow flame) so you don't have unattractive long strings of onion hanging over the edge, and garnish with fresh thyme. Yum! Incidentally, I had carmelized onions left over and used them for the potato, goat cheese and onion gratin, also from this web site. My kids even loved it!

It was difficult spreading the goat cheese on the pastry without crushing the light fluffy pastry. The onions tasted great but the whole visual effect was unappetizing. I think if I ever made the recipe again I would definitely use the puff pastry cups instead of the puff pastry sheets.

I made this for an apitizer on a buffet for a party of 120 people. It was easy to cut the philo into smaller portions then bake. I made everything the day before and assembled 1 hour before guest arrived. Not only did everyone think they were fantastic, but they kept well at room temperature throughout the party.

These turned out really good! I can understand that those who don't love goat cheese might not be impressed. But, if the basic ingredients appeal to you, then you will love these as I did. I used the ready-made phyllo tartlet cups and added the filling so I could serve them as appetizers rather than a first course. Great!

A lot of work with poor results. We tried it out for our gourmet club and were disappointed. Not much for presentation value. We couldn't get the onions to caramelize but none the less, there are better recipes to choose.

this recipe is great. I am a perfessional caterer and I use it in my business.

I made this recipe with a couple of changes, and it was delish! I had bought at a specialty market these cornmeal pizza crusts made by viccolo pizzeria (San Francisco) which are also available at webvan.com. I decided to use these instead of puff pastry. Their texture is wonderful and if you like cornmeal, they are a winner. Also added thin slices of roasted eggplant, underneath the goat cheese. I think I may have spread some pesto on the crust for extra flavor, though it proably didn't need it. Try it!!

I would spend a little longer to caramelize the onions to bring out the sweetness of the onions. I used Vidalia onions and liked this recipe as an appetizer.
