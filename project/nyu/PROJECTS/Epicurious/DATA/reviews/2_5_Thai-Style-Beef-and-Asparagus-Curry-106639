First of all, I tried this recipe with yellow curry paste because my step daughters don't like spicy food. I added at least twice the amount of paste for flavor. I would probably add more types of veggies next time I make it.

This dish is quite good - I've added it to my regular dinner rotation! I did make some changes, though. First, it absolutely needs more curry paste. I've used the mass-market paste available at big grocery stores (Thai Kitchen brand maybe?) and have to use about half of the little container it comes in. Second, it needs fish sauce. 2 or 3 Tablespoons. I marinated the beef in a mix of the fish sauce and curry paste that I mixed together, and this was successful. I was out of basil, so I used cilantro, and this was a tasty substitution.

This recipe was disappointing...really needs the curry enhanced! Thai food should be spicey to taste, but this was bland. The coconut milk could be lessened also. The milk makes the spices calm down so it should be used sparingly for a good taste for the meal.More veggies could be introduced to make it a real treat.

It was very bland I added 2 more teaspoons of curry paste to it and it still needed something. The basil and lime juice did brighten it up flavorwise a little it just needs something else.

I don't know how authentic this was, but I can attest to the fact that it is (a) fast to whomp together on a weeknight, and (b) yummy. I found the amount of heat just right; I used the amount of curry paste stated in the recipe, but did marinate the beef overnight, which perhaps accounts for the acceptable spiciness; I would never call this dish "bland", although it certainly wasn't incendiary. I did use Thai basil rather than the generic basil in the recipe. The one thing I would change in the recipe is the addition of something salty, which for Thai would be fish sauce, but other than that, I would not change a thing. We snarfed it right up.

Loved this dish but I added quite a bit more curry spices and lime juice (also some salt). Delicious!

Definitely needs more curry paste. Way too bland for me. When I want Thai, I want fire! Will use more spice next time.

Agree with those that said it doesn't have any flavour. None. Zip. The only flavour was some of the heat from the paste and the corriander I added. I know, some of you may be thinking, "I'm no Thai Connoisseur so I'm sure it will taste like good Thai to me!". Wrong. Food Court Thai tastes better! Take the time to continue your search! I should have :)

Quite good and very simple. Used extra curry paste (Mae Ploy) and sweet carrots instead of asparagus.

I made a slurry with brown sugar, corn starch, fish sauce and water and thickened it at the end. (I wouldn't recommend making it exactly as written - add a little soya sauce and sugar if that's what you have.) Used light coconut milk and it was still quite good. However - learn from my mistake - I got it in my head that red curry paste would not be as hot as that darn green stuff and was a little too liberal! My boyfriend found it excruciatingly hot (and it was, however, I wasn't a suck about it) and couldn't quite finish his meal (which I've never seen before) - I will be toning down the spice next time as I don't want to witness that Academy winning performance again!

One bite, and the dish screamed, "I'm missing something." I thought sweetness, so added some orange marmalade--I was desperate. If I had cilantro, would have used it. I only had 12 oz. meat, but two teaspoons curry paste wasn't enough.

It is what it says, a Thai style recipe, but it is really quick and easy and very tasty. We used about 4-5 tablespoons of red curry, but maybe ours was just mild.

This recipe is OK but is missing something - and in my experience that something is thai fish sauce. The addition of some fish sauce really improved it. Also, for the red curry paste I purchased, two teaspoons is not nearly enough. I tripled the amount and next time would probably add even more than that.

This is a very simple dish to prepare, I simply par-froze the beef, (I used tenderloin,) and it was very easy to slice thin. Also good with stringless snap peasinstead of asparagus."Thai kitchen " makes an excellent red-curry paste/base. I cut up a couple potatoes and added them as well.I make this dish whenever I need a thai/curry fix. Everybody loves it!

I don't understand how something with so many yummy ingredients could end up having absolutely no taste or texture. Not even the addition of sugar, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger, and chili flakes could save this weapon of mass destruction. My boyfriend says he's sleeping on the couch tonight.

I would say this recipe is good basis for a great dinner. It was very quick and easy to prepare. One word of caution regarding the curry paste -- degrees of hotness varies from one brand to the next. 2T. was too much for the paste I used (and I love the heat). With the asaparagus, I added mushrooms, scallions, tomatoes (quartered and seeded roma - they should be added a little later because they break down quickly in the heat)and garlic. Because the paste I used was a little too hot, I added a 1/8 c. sugar during the simmer and it balanced the flavors out nicely. I used lots of cilantro for garnish.

We were a little short on the asparagus, so we par boiled some carrots and added them to the dish. I mixed a little of the coconut milk in with the paste and marinated the meat for a half hour. We used lite coconut milk and remembered to shake the can well to get mix it sufficiently, otherwise it will go into the dish "separated" and you will have some problems with the sauce. We got a very nice consistency in the sauce. You can go heavy on the basil without hurting anything. My wife and I agreed that sweetened coconut milk would make this recipe a 3. We liked it a lot, but it just didn't have any "finish" to it other than the heat from the chilies in the paste.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. Like the last reviewer said, the sauce was runny and somewhat bland (it was spicy from the chili paste but not intensely flavorful). It definitely needed something else.

This was undelightful...it was runny, watery...and just blah! I added red bell pepper strips to it for color...I was not a happy camper and will not make this again.
