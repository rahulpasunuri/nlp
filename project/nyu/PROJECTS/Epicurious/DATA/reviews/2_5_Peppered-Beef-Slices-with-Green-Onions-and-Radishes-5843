The marinated beef is delightful; tender, juicy and very savory. The idea of cooked radishes was beyond the pale, so I omitted them, then served with sauteed squash and couscous.

We had a huge crop of radishes in our garden and I needed to do something with them so I tried this recipe. I thought it came out well. With the marinating, the beef came out very tender. The wine, pepper, and fennel gave it a nice flavor. The radishes were a nice change and it was nice to have something to do with them other than eating them raw in salads. My partner, who really isn't that into vegetables, really like the combination of peppery beef with the radishes. If you like the general recipe but aren't sure about the radishes, you could substitute green or red bell peppers or some other more traditional vegetable.

My family was not crazy about the cooked radishes, but I found them interesting. The fennel in the marinade was tasty. I liked the sauce.
