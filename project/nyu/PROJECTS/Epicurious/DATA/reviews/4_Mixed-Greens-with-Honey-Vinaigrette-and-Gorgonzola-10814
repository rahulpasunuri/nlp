This was so easy to prep and super tasty. I've made this dressing several times and tried it over baby romaine, spring mix, whatever salad greens I have on hand. Toasted slivered almonds are a MUST on this! Don't leave those out. This also makes a good meal on its own when you toss in some grilled chicken.

Very tasty!! I did not have sherry vinegar, and used balsamic instead as recommended by others, it worked well. Cant wait to try it with the sherry vinegar. I also made Sweet and Spicy Candied Pecans (found in Epicurious) to add to the salad, and sliced a pear. WOW what a combination. Good eats to all!! RS

Wow! Do yourself a favor and go by a good quality sherry vinegar and make this salad dressing! Best I've ever made. I highly suggest to add a half a head of chopped radicchio, toasted sliced almonds, and a pear or apple. This is our new favorite salad!

For over 2 years I have been asked to bring this to EVERY house we've been invited to. It's fabulous! I double or triple the recipe and keep in the fridge to use every day.

One of the best vinaigrettes I have made. Love that sherry vinegar. The salad is good as is, but I prefer it with toasted almonds, diced apple or pear, and chevre.

I made this salad and served it with Blue Cheese Shortbread Leaves, Bon Appétit, November 2002. I served the salad and baked the shortbread with dolce latte gorgonzola and it was fabulous. I topped the salad with roasted beets and used roasted garlic in the dressing. It was a hit with my foodie friends and British neighbours. Good opening salvo for the braised short ribs that followed.

Great dressing! The only change I made was to crumble bleu cheese over salad versus the sliced plated cheese.

This is a regular now. Great dressing for sour greens, as the honey is just perfect with them. I use the 3 tsp/or a tbl. of honey

Great recipe, realized I was out of the rasberry viniagrette I usually use on my sald and was able to whip this up with things I had on hand. Used a good quality red wine vinegar instead of sherry vinegar. Added walnuts and dried cranberries, just delicious!

I don't normally write reviews but thought this recipe deserves one. Substituted balsamic for sherry vinegar and added walnuts and grapes for a little extra sweetness and crunch. Devine.

After trying too many store bought salad dressings and then being unhappy, I have determined it is better(& more economical) to make my own. This one is a winner! It is definitely a keeper! Salad combination delicious and you can add grapes, nuts, or just plain greens. The dressing is outstanding.

AWESOME! My favorite of all time! Added sugared walnuts to the salad. You will have to try this.

LOVE IT! Thanks to all of the raters' sugestions, I always get rave reviews when serving this salad. I add pear chunks, dried sweetened cranberries and toasted hazelnut. The salad tastes better than most you might find in gourmet restaurants (if I may say so myself). The dressing is a great staple, and I always keep some on hand to dress up a weeknight salad of whatever is in the fridge.

I loved this recipe. I couldn't find sherry vinegar at my grocery store, and substituted balsamic vinegar. When I make it in the future - I will always use the balsamic vinegar. Since I was making the salad for a large group, I offered crumbly gorgonzola and walnuts on the side, and I mixed sliced red peppers in the salad. I had thirds or fourths (I couldn't get enough), and other members of the dinner party really enjoyed it also. It will become my balsamic vinaigrette dressing of choice in the future.

Excellent dressing - and one where you have everyting in your pantry too! Added pancetta and toasted walnuts - can see how pears would also be great.

I served this salad on Christmas Eve as a starter to a lovely supper. Upon rave reviews, it has had many successful repeat performances. The honey makes the dish.

This salad got rave reviews at a cook-out with some foodie friends. I couldn't find sherry vinegar, so used part balsamic, part red wine vinegar and part sherry cooking wine. I used regular gorgonzola, added red bell peppers and it was a winner. Would try candied pecans next time and danish blue cheese.

This dressing is phenomenal! I whip up a batch at least three times a week -- I can't get enough of it! Really, truly delicious.

I couldn't find any sherry vinegar so I used equal parts balsamic vinegar and red wine vinegar. The dressing was tasty, but I felt the salad needed something to go with the honey in the dressing so I added some sliced pear and walnuts which I coarsely chopped and then lightly toasted. My friends loved it and asked for the recipe. It was fairly simple to make so I will most likely make it again.

Got rave reviews from coworkers. Added craisins and walnuts.

The dressing was really tasty. I didn't think the sweet gorgonzola was anything special and would likely just crumble some blue cheese on the salad next time.

My husband and I belong to a Gourmet Club at Travis AFB Ca.Each month we get together with five other couples and have a gourmet meal.We hosted the group for May. As the hostess I plan the menu and give each couple the recipe that they are to prepare. This was our salad recipe for May. It was wonderful,so wonderful, in fact, I am making it for my family again tonight.

Great dish for a party and/or to serve with pasta or fish. The dressing was really simple. I added a bit more mustard and honey. I also served it with pecans which worked out fine. I think this would go nice with candied walnuts too.

My all time favorite vinaigrette! Additions of toasted walnuts, plumped dried cranberries, fresh pear chunks, plus crumbled blue or feta cheese made a delicious and attractive holiday salad.

Nice dressing. To complement the gorgonzola I added some carmelized pecans. PERFECT. As with some other cooks, I found the addition of nuts improved this salad. I'll definitely make it again.

I used crumbled blue cheese and threw in some toasted pignoli nuts. The dressing was very nice. It was a good starter for the spicy Jambalaya I served for the main course.

I don't usually give 4 forks, but I could've eaten the whole bowl of salad by myself! This is delicious. I added toasted chopped pecans. This made a very easy, elegant salad appropriate for formal and casual occasions. I'll be making it often!

This was a nice light dish for summertime. The honey vinagrette was different -- very refreshing. However, for my taste, it could have used another flavor. Next time I will try adding walnuts or pecans.

I tried this salad on the basis of the rave review it received and it was fabulous. Very easy to make too. I added honeyed walnuts, which added a nice touch. Will definitely add this to our list of recipes to make again and again.
