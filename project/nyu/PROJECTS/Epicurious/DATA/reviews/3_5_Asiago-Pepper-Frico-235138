I make these all the time. They're a huge hit at parties, never any left. Great alone as an appetizer, atop salad, sticking out of a savory flan or custard. You can add fresh herbs, or smoky paprika. Delish! I use a Silpat liner and they lift right off. I often make one large frico and break it up into pieces, or long sticks to stand up in a glass or short vase. Makes for a great presentation, and takes less room on the cocktail table!

This is a great recipe but it REALLY makes a difference what type of cheese you use. For my first batch, I grated my own asiago. It took forever to cook and I ended up undercooking them a little. So I left the next batch in until they were really golden brown and they were inedible (very, very bitter). Next I decided to try a tub of pre-grated romano-blend cheese. They cooked up MUCH faster and tasted great. So I suspect this particular frico recipe works best with pre-shredded cheese.

Forgot to add in my previous review that I always use parchment and never have any problems. I just cool a minute before removing with a spatula, and then cool completely in a single layer on paper towels. The paper towels absorb excess oils, and keep the frico crisp.

super-easy, and super-tasty. What more could you ask for? Everyone always asks for the recipe, and I almost feel guilty about telling them how easy it was.

We had some asiago cheese and I didn't know what to do with it. I found this recipe and tried it. Very quick and quite tasty. I substituted a jerk seasoning for the cayenne pepper.

These were very tasty and an easy appetizer. The first batch I baked on a new silicone baking sheet and they came right off the sheet. The second batch I did as the directions instructed on parchment paper and these ended up with parchment paper stuck to them permanently. I wish I knew what the answer is.

Good with the salad. Easy to make.

I've been making this for a long time and it's a wonderful appetizer. I also add a sprinkling of flour to the mixture - seems to make them less greasy. I make them somewhat smaller than the recipe calls for and find there's no need to space them so far apart - you can make more per batch that way. I put them on a silpat, rather than using parchment paper. Thay always get raves and it's almost embarassing to tell people how easy they are!

So easy and so good. A wonderful way to dress up a salad. Don't need to change a thing.
