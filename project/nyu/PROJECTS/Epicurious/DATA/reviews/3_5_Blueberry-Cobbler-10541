this is a amazing cobbler recipe - i'll never buy a cobbler in the store again. this recipe is just as good using frozen blueberries if it's not blueberry season near you. i had my doubts, but this recipe is easy AND delicious!

I love this cobbler recipe! I've made it many times and every time it's been exceptional. I've even used a mixture of berries, frozen berries, fresh berries and all come out great! I've run out of cornstarch before and used 1/4 cup flour instead and it thickens up nicely. Delicious!

A nice cobbler. I thought the biscuits were great. I added a little nutmeg too. The blueberries where too liquidy for me.

Great recipe!!!...just made it.... I added blackberries and made a larger amount of filling, just increased the amount of sugar and corn starch to compensate. so this recipe is good if you want to make a large amount. Made the same amount of topping. It came out perfectly amazing and I paired it with home made vanilla bean whip cream, which I totally recommend!

The filling was quite good (perhaps a little on the sweet side, but of course that depends on what blueberries you are using). The cobbler, however, was a little too cakey for my taste. I prefer a more biscuit-y cobbler dough. Still, I'll hang onto the proportions in this fillin. Well worth making, especially if your cobbler preference is different from mine.

Easily and quickly prepared. Very nice fresh blueberry flavor. The cinnamon is a good compliment to the fruit. Will make again.

I used a peach mango in addition to my fresh blueberries and the recipe was to die for.

This was wonderful...I did cook it down a bit before putting it in the oven and I doubled the cinnamon which tasted great but turned the batter brown which was not quite as pretty. Will make again!

This recipe was very easy and tasted wonderful hot from the oven with some vanilla ice cream.

While not the best blueberry cobbler I've ever had, it was warm, sweet, and a nice end to the meal. I halved the recipe and baked it in 4 ramekins for individual cobbers. I topped it with caramel ice cream which I liked better than the usual vanilla. My guests loved it, but I thought there was something missing in the crust. I may add more cinnamon next time.

Good cobbler - liked the cinnamon flavor in the topping. Done in less than 25 min. at 375 in my convection oven.

Simple, fresh and delicious! A show stopper at a recent dinner party with foodie friends. I reduced the cornstarch to 2T for a bit more syrupy consistency; eliminated the cinnamon and added about 1 tsp of lemon rind to the dough which really heightened the cobbler.

As noted by another reviewer, my topping was done before the berries were cooked. Another recipe with a similar topping calls for the fruit to be cooked for a few minutes before putting the topping on.

Oh. So. Good! Look no further for a blueberry cobbler recipe.

Doubled recipe for large group. One problem I had was getting blueberries and dough to come out at the same time. Dough was browning on the outside but neither the inside of the dough nor the berries were done, so I flipped the dough over and baked until berries and dough were done. The berries that stuck to the dough when I flipped it gave it a nice look.

This is an easy recipe, which tasted delicious!

It was really a delicious dessert! My mom picked 25 lbs of blueberries while vacationing at Topsail Island, and brought me 5 lbs. Perfect way to use them. I doubled the cinnamon, and added some cardamom. Also didn't bother with unsalted butter or pushing the brown sugar through a seive (didn't have time). And it got rave reviews!

I would actually give this dish 2 1/2 if it were possible. The topping was missing something. I'm not an expert cook so I can't pinpoint what it is exactly that's lacking. I would try another dish first before attempting this one again. Overall, I would say it satisfied my craving (I'm expecting)! :)

The 1/4 of water for the crust should be listed as an ingredient. I generally look at the ingredient list and go for it, seldom reading the actual instructions...I made this without the water and the crust was terrible!

I made this recipe once before, with peaches, and didn't enjoy it. The topping just didn't do it for me. I made this again recently, with blueberries as suggested, and it turned out ok. I didn't actually get to taste it (took it to a party and it was gone before I got a chance to taste). My boyfriend and his parents loved it, and said the topping had kind of a cookie-like texture. I guess you either love or hate the topping, but overall the recipe is very easy to make. I only gave it two forks because of my first experience with it and the fact that I didn't actually get to taste it the second time myself...

Rating: 2
Good, but I don't get the 4 forks from some folks. I thought the batter was a bit sparse. Think I like the plain old-fashioned recipes from Betty Crocker, etc. better.

I made this last night and we liked it. I used fresh berries from the farmer's market and reduced the sugar in the berries to 3 tbsps. The sugar in the topping adds a lot of sweetness and we didn't miss the extra sugar. I also doubled the cinnamon and added a capful of vanilla to the topping. I did not push the brown sugar through a sieve and it turned out fine. The topping was different, but yummy.

This was the most wonderful cobbler I ever made! My husband just loved it! It was so easy. When blueberry season is over, I will try it with frozen berries. The only thing I added was some nutmeg.

I made a few modifications and it turned out well: used frozen berrie for the filler and added walnuts into the food processor for the crisp. Yummy!

I always get requests to make this for parties. I've been making it for several years and its always a big hit. I use frozen mixed berries instead of blueberries and I double the cinnamon and add a small pinch of nutmeg to the topping.

I thought the cobbler was delicious. I don't know what the person was talking about who didn't care for the topping . . . . it's just a big cookie. I substituted whole wheat pastry flour and it was still fabulous. I used just a bit more water, so I could "spread" the topping a little easier. The blueberries were fresh from the farmer's market, and super plump, which helped, I'm sure. My book group girls loved it, and they have high standards!

This was my first cobbler (to make or eat) and it turned out beautifully. I doubled the recipe for fathers day -- the two dads I was cooking for are both blueberry lovers. It was extraordinarily rich -- even by our decadent standards -- so cut the smallest pieces possible. The blueberries I used were really sweet and juicy so, yes, it's true, it did get a little soupy but I simply poured some of the blueberry concoction over the ice cream and no one complained a bit. Bonus: it was a snap put together.

Rating: 3
A very good & easy recipe. Mine was a little bit too juicy, though. Next time I'll maybe double the cornstarch.

It's packed with flavor and very easy to make. The topping is almost like a giant cookie. Everyone loved it.

Made this many times. Fast and easy to assemble. Delicious result...perfect dessert for any summer meal. YUM!!! Don't overcook...bluberries will be runny.

Rating: 3
The dough is sweet and crumbly and is a perfect match with the blueberries. I used less sugar with the blueberries because it was a little too sweet the first time. A hit all around the house.

Absolutely the best cobbler I've ever made. I've brought it to three get togethers this summer and everyone loves it! Definately a keeper.

I served this to rave reviews (and got several requests for the recipe). I used fresh blueberries which were fantastic, and I made this simple recipe even easier by using a food processor for mixing the topping. I will definitely make this again, perhaps including some other fruit with the blueberries.

This is the best cobbler! I've made it several times and everyone asks for the recipe.

This is very good! I made with frozen blueberries. I used 1/2 cup less and rolled the blueberries in flour, because of the extra water that frozen blueberries contain. Worked great! I also used a 9 inch pie plate and had no problems with it running over. This is a keeper!

Great & easy! Loved the brownsugar crust. Very nice change from the normal biscuit crust. I'll definately make it again. My kids and husband loved it. I used frozen berry mixture of boysenberries, rasberries and blueberries but didn't change anything else!

Though we liked this dessert, it was not really a "cobbler". The topping is sweet, but more crumbly and less "biscuit" like. Good - just not what we expected.

This is the first cobbler I've ever made. It was very quick and very easy and the whole thing was gone in 15 minutes! I sprinkled some granulated sugar on top before baking for extra crunch.

This was good and was eaten all up but I am still in search of the perfect cobbler recipe. I used half blackberries with good effect.

Delicious and easy, too. A wonderful choice if you have to work around milk allergies, as you can make this successfully with dairy-free margerine. I plan to try it with peaches, too.
