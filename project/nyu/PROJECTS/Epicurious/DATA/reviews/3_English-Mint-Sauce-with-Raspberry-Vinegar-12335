This is excellent and I moderated the sugar to the taste we wanted. My english boyfriend was the judge and jury, since they are big on mint sauce on their lamb, and he gave it a big thumbs up. I put it in the vitamix to get a nice blend...

I've made this recipe several times and like it a lot. It's simple and to the point (and cheaper than store bought!)

I found this recipe to be a little too sweet although the taste improved with the lamb. I'll try it again with a bit less sugar or maybe with some red wine vinegar and a little less of the rasberry vinegar.
