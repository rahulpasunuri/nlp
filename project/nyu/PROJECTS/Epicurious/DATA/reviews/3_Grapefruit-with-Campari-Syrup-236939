i forgot to include this in my review - i had a lot of leftover juice when the grapefruit was gone - i added some gin and it made a tasty cocktail!

very simple to make and tastes good - but it good in a simple way - it doesn't bowl you over with wow. i do disagree with the cook who said don't bother with the campari - the bitterness the campari lends is essential to this dish, i think. i added black pepper and liked it a lot better that way.

Light, refreshing and delicious. It's a reasonably quick winter dessert that's been a big hit in my house.

This tasted good, but it could have been from the sugar added to the grapefruit juice rather than benefits of Campari. Not worth the effort to buy special bottle of campari, remove membranes from grapefruit, and reduce juice to form syrup... good in theory but overall not worth the effort.
