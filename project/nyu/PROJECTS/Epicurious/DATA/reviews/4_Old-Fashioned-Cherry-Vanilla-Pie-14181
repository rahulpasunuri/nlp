This recipe, using fresh or frozen sour cherries, is absolutely the best recipe I've ever used. These cherries have such a short period of availability, so I usually buy 10 or more quarts in early to mid July, then pit and freeze them. Served with vanilla ice cream, you simply cannot beat the flavor and textures. Enjoy!

The flavor in this pie is mouthwatering delicious. Prepitted frozen cherries are the best.

I've finally found a really great cherry pie recipe! Our Montmorency tree has been giving prolifically the last three years and now I've found the "Keeper" recipe for them. I don't use quite as much sugar as called for because we prefer things less sweet. No matter the pie crust recipe I use, I always substitute 5 tablespoons vodka that I keep in the freezer for that amount of ice water. The reason is scientific (thank you, Cooks Illustrated) and it truly does make a difference in the tenderness and flakiness of pie crust. My husband considers this one of the best pies - filling AND crust - he has ever eaten!

This recipe is outstanding. I'd definitely make it again. It may have been me, but I felt it was a little labor intensive. Well worth it, though! We also felt that it was super-rich for a fruit pie. That's OK--it just means plenty of leftovers!

Great pie. The amount of vanilla was fine. I used the lattice pie cutter from Williams and Sonoma which made the top a breeze. I also used fresh cherries which took forever and stained my hands for days. I don't think the fresh cherries were worth the cost or the time.

This pie is delicious. I used only butter in my crust as I don't like to use any shortening (no hydrogenated oils in my food!) and it was just fine. I also used flour instead of tapioca, same quantity. Someone commented that it was too much vanilla, but we loved the rich flavor the vanilla added. You could use 1.5 Tblspoons instead if you wanted it a little more subtle. I made this last weekend and am making it againt today. I'll be using regular cherries, so I'll be reducing the sugar a bit, but other than that, just the same recipe!

Excellent pie. Put the vanilla in while you are cooking the cherries, so the alcohol has a chance to burn off. Also, I didn't mess with the wax paper for the top crust and it worked out fine.

We liked this, but thought the vanilla was too strong. I will look for a better recipe for cherry pie.

I've made this pie three times and absolutly love it. I am a cherry pie lover as well as one who really likes vanilla. I acually add another half tablespoon of vanilla to this recipe. Also, get the best vanilla possible, I use pure vanilla extract from Mexico. My friends and family love it as much as I do. Just be sure to use only the freshest Bing Cherries.

I also enjoyed the vanilla flavor. If there was a slightly overpowering and out-of-place flavor, I think it was the cinnamon. Otherwise, it was an excellent recipe. Pre-cooking the tapioca with the cherry juice made the filling come out with just the right thickness.

Great recipe. I can't understand what all the vanilla fuss is about, 2 T. was fine as is to all who sampled. The only thing that I didn't follow was building the lattice top on wax paper. Seems like a hassle to then have to move it to the pie - just build it on top.

I wish I had listened to the other reviews about the vanilla. I added 2TB and it was too much. That said, everyone else but me thought the pie was lovely. Couldn't find tapioca here in Australia so I used cornstarch which seemed to work fine. A great recipe overall

Worked well, even with canned cherries, which was all I could find. Two tablespoons of vanilla was just dandy; I can't imagine it being overpowering unless you're using some exotic super-charged Madagascar brand. A little caution on the recommended method of building the lattice on a sheet of waxed paper and sliding it onto the pie. That lattice had no intention of sliding anywhere. There just happened to be a man with large hands and a knowledge of pie crust in my kitchen who managed to slip his hand under the waxed paper and flip the thing over onto the pie. If your kitchen is not so equipped I'd do the lattice the usual way.

I made this pie for as a 'thank-you'gift for someone....they told me the pie was excellent! I used my own crust recipe but followed the filling part exactly...2 TBS of vanilla and all. I did use frozen cherries...and they worked out nicey! They camed already pitted which saved me a lot of time. I will be making this next month for the church fair!

This is a great pie. As most of the reviews suggested, I cut the vanilla in half and I think this was plenty.

Ridiculous amount of vanilla? Honestly, I almost followed the advice and used 1 tsp of vanilla but knew with the flavor of the cherries I wouldn't taste it (it is Cherry Vanilla Pie, after all). I ended up using 1 TBL of very fine vanilla and was happy to have the flavor shine through beautifully. May increase the vanilla to 2 TBL as called for next time. And there certainly will be a second time. Note: When using that amount of vanilla, you need to use the best otherwise it's the alcohol flavor that comes through.

This is a fabulous pie - I made it last year for Thanksgiving and it was rated the "best" pie. I'll be making it today.

This pie has some problems, but even with that considered, it's stunning. First note: DO NOT use the 2 tbs vanilla. Follow the other advice: 1 tsp is just heavenly. The vanilla and cinnamon blend with the cherry flavor into something truly spectacular. The dough was a nightmare to work with, but everyone loved how deliciously flaky it was. Sugar on top of the lattice work gave a sweet, crisp finishing touch. My own nightmare: I could only find small pearl tapioca at the store, and even with cooking it a bit longer, it never dissolved and my pie never set. Nonetheless, my father, who very seldom bothers to compliment the cook, proclaimed several times that it was the best cherry pie he'd ever eaten.

This recipe is simple and makes the most delicious cherry pie I've ever tasted!

Am I missing something? I thought this pie was really pretty bad. I, too, was a bit surprised by the amount of vanilla and started with 1 tsp. Even then, I found that the filling tasted like some sort of artificial cherry dessert. What a waste of good, fresh cherries! The only saving grace was the pie crust (which is the only part that I would ever make again).

This pie is fabulous except for the ridiculous amount of vanilla. Vanilla is an expensive and pungeant flavouring, to be used in moderation. The first time i made this pie i used have the amount shown, and it was still too much, and an insult to the superb cherry flavour, as it overpowered it. The next time i used 1 tsp. of vanilla, and the balance was perfect.

I made this pie last summer and can't wait until the sour cherries are at the farmers markets so I can make it again. Fantastic!

I made this recipe for a couple of women who attend Round Top on a regular basis. We could have eaten 2 more--GREAT PIE !
