I was not expecting this recipe to be so good - it was delicious. Admittedly, a few tweaks: no mushrooms so instead started with a mirepoix to make sure there was enough flavor base; used mixed poultry seasonings instead of fresh thyme; added some ancho chili powder and crushed red peppers because I didn't have fire roasted tomatoes; swapped spinach for kale. Also, I left the lid off for most of the boil to make it more of a stew. If you're thinking about skipping the poached egg - don't! It added so much to the dish.

I thought this was sort of blah. I did like the egg (fried over easy). Makes more than 4 servings, and we're big eaters. I would make it again because it's easy and healthy, but I think I'd use beef broth to give it a little more flavor.

This soup was easy to make, tasty, healthy, and very comforting. I agree with other reviewers that it's tasty even without the egg -- but why not add the protein? I will confess to some tweaks: couldn't find shiitake mushrooms so used baby bella. Added a little diced carrot. Used regular barley (because it was half price), so had to cook the soup a bit longer. This was really yummy with crusty homemade bread. Homemade oatmeal cookies for dessert (use the Gourmet September 1999 cookies.

the soup by itself is pretty tasty; the egg and Parmesan put it over the "good" to "really delicious" level. big plus for being easy to make!

This was a very nice soup. I had never used fire roasted tomatoes in soups before, but it added an interesting taste along with the mushrooms. Did not do the eggs, but the end result was still very tasty with some parm cheese on top.

Really simple to make and delicious. I used bella mushrooms and chicken stock, and poached eggs for the top. My kids loved it. Will definitely make this soup again.

I thought this recipe was great! It was delicious, hearty and healthy and also simple and easy to make. An excellent dish for regular weeknight dining (and lunch the next day too). I made a few slight adjustments to the recipe 1) I used chicken broth instead of vegetable because that is what I had on hand and as a result found that this made it slightly salty. Although still incredibly enjoyable I will definitely try a veg. broth next time. Also, I used regular field mushrooms (again, for convenience sake)and did not include the thyme - instead I added just a touch of dehydrated parsley. I also forgot to add the spinach at the end! I was very hungry and got ahead of myself ;) I did however poach an egg for the top of mine while my boyfriend opted for no egg and we both thought it was an excellent recipe overall. We will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe. Easy to make and fairly quick. Made a double batch without any problems. Instead of poaching the egg I fried it in ghee. The egg really makes it. It's similar to Kitcherie, more americanized.

I was very pleasantly surprised by this soup. Expected it to be kind of basic, but it was really wonderful and satisfying. I used regular canned tomatoes and added red pepper flakes. I also used well-chopped kale instead of spinach and it was very nice. The first night, we had it with the poached eggs, which really added to the richness of the soup. The second night we had it plain and it was wonderful as well. Very easy, very healthy, and very satisfying.

I skipped the egg and vinegar and doubled the garlic. I garnished with a ton of parm-reg. Very, very good and easy and so nutritious.

Tasty. A nice bite thanks to those fire-roasted tomatoes. Did not use the eggs. Added one leek. My 15-month-old loves this, so I have made heaps of it!

Perfect for a cold night and little time. This is a hearty recipe with a woodsy, satisfying, peasant blend. How I used the recipe: I used Bella mushrooms, added 2 celery stalks and sauted them with the onions, used 1 tsp dried thyme, plain canned tomatoes, added a few shakes dried red pepper flakes, it also needed more salt. I also did not use the poached eggs. I served the soup with French bread and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. As a vegetarian, this soups was a delight! The earthiness of the mushrooms permeated the stock and took away that bland veggie stock taste. The barley added a great starch to the soup which made it much like a mushroom stew. And it took me 1 hour to make-- including a trip to the grocery store! With my additions, I will be returning to this recipe quite often.

a good, basic soup that you could customize to taste. i made as written only substituting clam juice and fish stock. was very good next day as well.

For a cheaper version, I used regular mushrooms & a single bag of oatmeal. Omitted the spinach and egg, didn't notice a difference. Good with french bread.
