This fig jam is awesome! I can't wait to make it again - and using dried figs, you can make it any time of year. I used a tawny port, sourdough baguette and a soft-yet-crumbly goat cheese from Spain. A big hit at my catering event!

Wonderful. Vanished so quick as everyone loved. Used regular dried figs (could not find black mission), mid grade port. Did not use the fresh fig garnish, just garnished with a little fresh thyme. Great to make ahead the jam, but much prefer the toasts freshly made. Very easy. Only time consuming part is chopping the figs. I highly recommend this recipe. Making again as one of my Christmas appetizers.

Made this for a Thanksgiving app and only so-so considering the expense and time...it's one of those recipes that seemed like it had all the right ingredients but just fell a bit short.

This one is really good for an office gathering because you can make the jam and crostini beforehand and bring it in without working about heating up or chilling. I assembled them at my desk! Everyone raved and asked for the recipe.

So easy, yet so elegant. Don't wait for fresh figs to make this, you don't need them. I make this with dried figs, and then spread honey goat cheese (from Trader Joe's, but have used regular goat cheese too), then add jam, and a slice of prosciutto. So good, and I get rave reviews. This is my new favorite appetizer.

This is a really nice app. I was in a rush the second time I made this so used "store bought" fig jam (not quite as good but acceptable). I topped the crostini w/ jam and a wedge of fresh fig and THEN the goat cheese. I then flashed them under the broiler - awsome!

I made the fig jam using a combination of fresh and dried figs. Like other reviewers, I found it took considerably more time to cook the jam so that it was smooth and spreadable. The jam is a keeper and worth repeating. Also very nice with the liver pate (with clarified butter)on this site. I love goat cheese but I didn't think this app was worthy of 4 forks. Good but nothing special and not worth repeating.

Fantastic! The sweetness of the fig against the tangy goat cheese is wonderful. Couldn't find fresh figs to put on top but I really don't think they are necessary for this crostini. This is my new favorite appetizer.

Made this for my book club and everyone loved it. Prepared everything at home and assembled the crostini when I arrived. I also topped the goat cheese with a sliver of prosciutto - no fresh figs available. Easy recipe and full of flavor. Will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe. I made this appetizer recently for a dinner club, I didn't find fresh figs at the market so I served it just with the fig paste and goat cheese. I plan on making this again.

This is delicious! The fig jam also goes well with brie.

This was really good. I didn't find fresh figs at the store, so I topped with prosciutto instead. Tasty! I've used the leftover fig jam in a chicken with fig dish (cooking light) and in a vinagrette.

I've never eaten figs, but I was looking for a good appetizer for a Morrocan meal and thought I'd give them a try. I couldn't find fresh figs for the topping and was serving to friends who don't eat meat, so I drizzled the goat cheese with a mixture of honey and black pepper and topped with toasted walnuts. They were delicious, and I will try them again--next time with the proscuitto.

This was wonderful and I'd definitely make again. The figs are savory, as others describe, but really are delicious with the goat cheese. As others recommended, I served with proscuitto, which was delicious. This is very easy to prepare and can be prepared any time of year. Very elegant.

I've made this countless times. Easy recipe with amazing flavor. Often I make the fig jam and serve it over goat cheese. Guests can spread it themselves on crackers or bread rounds (eliminating the time and tedium of assembling the crostini). Easy for picnics, with proscutto, etc. I use red wine instead of port and add a little honey if needed. Grrreat.

Excellent with a little honey drizzled over then warmed in the oven for a few minutes

My mouth is watering just thinking about this one. I served them at a backyard dinner party with some prosecco. I made half as-is and the other half, I added some mild prosciutto from the local Italian butcher. Divine!

This gets rave reviews anytime I serve it. Even when figs aren't in season, we have it with the jam and goat cheese. It is totally worth it to make the jam. Nothing in the markets compare. Decadent and easy!

This is quite possibly my favorite thing to eat. The figs and chevre pair beautifully and these will wow your guests (if there are any left when they arrive!).

I have made these many, many times and they are quite possibly my favorite thing to eat. The figs and chevre are an amazing combination and they make a beautiful presentation that will wow your guests (that is, if there are any left by the time they arrive!)

The recipe is fantastic - a delicious flavor combination. I took the suggestion from another reviewer and instead of fresh figs (which are out of season), I topped these with a thin sliver of proscuitto. I made them for a wine tasting party and they were a big hit.

The savory jam is fantastic - an unusual and delicious flavor combination. Instead of fresh figs (which are out of season), I topped these with a thin sliver of proscuitto. These worked well with a sweet sparkling cava aperitif.

Serves these at a cocktail party and they were a huge hit. People kept asking what was in them. It's fun to serve something unusual. I'll definitely be doing this one again!

These were really wonderful and very pretty. Made as directed and served Christmas eve before dinner. The jam is the perfect savory compliment to the goat cheese. The fresh figs I got weren't quite ripe, but it was still fine, as most of the flavor comes from the other. Be careful when reducing the port for the jam, it took less than 10 minutes. I highly recommend these.

I can't recall ever getting a more uniformly ecstatic response to a dish. I used more fresh fig on top than is noted and that was a very good move since my jam was very savory.

Substituting carmelized red onions for the shallots, and a fairly inexpensive cabernet for the port produced a fig jam that was slightly less sweet, but still complex tasting, and less pricy that the written recipe.

Rating: 4
These were absolutely outstanding: a simple pleasure, yet such complex flavors... they were still be talking about after dessert. Made these as part of a fig-themed menu to highlight the season. The key to success here is the fresh fig slice on top - if the fruit is sweet you've got perfect harmony. The jam is fine when made the day before, making the final prep super easy. Make extra jam & you'll be having it with breakfast all week.

Taste was very good, but I found it a bit sweet as an appetizer. Folks seemed to enjoy them -- not raves, but decent reviews. The fresh fig is a good touch.

Seriously, figs and goat cheese are the best combination ever. My favorite short cut/unexpected guest snack or whatever: grab a bag of dried mission figs, cut a slit in them (but not all the way through) stuff with goat cheese. Top with an almond if you're feeling particularly indulgent. It's awesome.

i had a spa party for all my friends. this was a huge hit!!! everyone wants the recipe. would definitely make it again!!!

i have made this jam many times. the first time, i chopped the figs, but felt that the consistency was too rough so i used an immersion blender to smooth the jam. now i chop the figs, quite finely in the cuisinart to start, and then proceed with the rest of the directions. i also ran out of port once, so i used madiera in its place and it was equally wonderful. if fresh figs are not avail, i substitute them with proscuitto.

This recipe was one of the best appetizers I have had in a really long time. I would recommend spreading the goat cheese on first, putting the fig jam and then fresh fig slices. Delicious!

Made this for a corporate function and it was very well liked. Quite different and interesting. Used soft (mi-cuit) dried figs - don't know about Black Mission figs. Agree you need to cook jam for a bit longer than recipe states.

Yes I agree, good, but not "out of this world...." Will probably make again though. Liked it, just wasn't bowled over by it -- thus 3 forks

Absolutely delicious, and quite simple to make. As others mention, it takes a bit longer than 10 minutes to adequately cook the fig jam. Since fresh figs are not readily available during winter months, I did not use them but really were not needed. The combination of the jam and goat cheese is delicious and got rave reviews!

this is fantastic! i used a stong red wine mixed with cointreau. Served to 100 people they went wild.

I was very uncertain of this recipe at first, but it was a hit with my whole family! I used fresh figs from our garden instead of dried figs and just cooked them for longer, and used a red wine I had sitting around instead of Port, but it still turned out amazingly well! I can't wait to make this recipe again.

Deliciously easy. Was a big hit at a party yesterday. I followed the recipe to a T and took the hint from another reviewer to use the food processor for the dried figs. Another hint: use FRESH dried figs, not some you pull from your pantry that are already kind of dried out. The fresher the package, the better!

i found the recipe didn't quite describe the cooking process - it took longer or I did something wrong but loved the flavors and am making it again tomorrow.

I agree with the previous reviewer- a snap to make and really excellent. I served it as one of a few hors d'oeuvres when having people over for some wine and bites to eat and it was a huge hit. I don't know about the shortcut to using store-bought fig jam... this is so easy to make there's no reason to cut corners. If you use a food processor to help finely chop the figs there's no reason you can't throw it together quickly.

An absolute winner that's a snap to make. I added 2-3 T. Brown sugar to the simmering mix and it added a nice mellow flavor. I also ended up simmering for quite a bit longer to reconstitute the dried figs. This marmalade makes a very flavorful glaze for sauteed chicken paillards, then sprinkle with a little goat cheese (montrachet or feta) when serving, easy and delicious!

I used purchased fig jam from Whole Foods due to time issues. I also made some with melted brie. So easy and everyone loved them!

This is lovely, elegant and easy. I ended up simmering the fig mixture for 3x longer than the recipe called for. Next time I make it I'd start with an even finer dice of the ingredients. It's even easier if you purchase a fig compote and use that - I did a side by side tasting and if pressed for time I wouldn't hesitate to use store bought, both were delicious.

I added more thyme and fresh (finely chopped) rosemary. I made crustini and served it on the side with one dish plane goat cheese and one dish fig jam and let my guests put their own together. Huge success.

Savory fig compliments the goat cheese nicely. I might boost the thyme next time I make it.
