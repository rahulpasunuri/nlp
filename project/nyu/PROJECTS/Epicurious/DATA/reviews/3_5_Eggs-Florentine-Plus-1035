Just made this for breakfast and it was fantastic! I didn't have mushrooms, so substituted chicken broth for the mushroom sauce. I also used crumbled sausage instead of turkey. I spread goat cheese on the toast before topping it with the eggs and it was so delicious!

We really liked this recipe. I had vegetable broth on hand. A dried mushroom blend so I don't know what kind of mushrooms I actually used. Picked out the sliced mushrooms and chopped them after soaked in broth. Used leftover bbq chicken. Fresh spinach from the garden and it all came together really well. And we ate it for a dinner. Very YUMMY!

I just made this for breakfast for guests and we liked it a lot! I had to use shitake mushrooms and will make it with porcini next time - if I can get them. I agree that 12 ounces of spinach were needed - could even do a little more. I used baby spinach and 12 ounces just barely covered the bottom of the dish. I also used 8 eggs and it was fine. YUM!!

Delicious. The smoked turkey and mushrooms add rich, exotic flavors. Feeds six people with modest portions -- so plan on serving other side dishes. Use 12 ounces or more spinach to coat bottom of dish.

I own a small Bed & Breakfast in Palmyra NY. This recipe, with the addition of a bit more butter and some chopped broccoli has become a special favorite with my guests. You can use any kind of mushrooms and any kind of turkey...it's always good.
