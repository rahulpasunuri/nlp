This is one of the best recipes on this sight! Not only does it taste wonderful, it looks beautiful as well. It is a lovely pink color with the orange and yellow confetti citrus rind. My husband and I enjoy making cheeseboards, and this marmalade is a wonderful addition. We serve it with Cougar Gold on a plain cracker. The marmalade is sweet, the cheese is salty and creamy and the cracker is crunchy. It is a real treat! I've made it several times and am considering canning it for Christmas gifts this year.

the end product is superb! i doubled the recipe and got almost 16 half-pint jars. i definitely reccomend processing the jars, due to all the time and effort involved (you'd might as well be able to enjoy them and have them to give as gifts). it definitely takes longer than stated in the recipe to cook down--as in about 2 hours for mine.

This recipe is good but I found it too sweet for my taste. The sweetness takes away from the overall flavor. I tripled the recipe (had a crate of tomatoes) and only added 2/3 of the sugar- but I also used quite sweet Navel oranges from my neighbors backyard...... I think next time if I were making this amount I would add the sugar slower....It also takes forever to cook down. I really like the citrus and tomato combo. This would definately be good with bread and a soft cheese such as brie or even reblochon or robiola.

Next time, I'd only add the edible part of the orange and then the grated peel; the pith gave it a strong bitterness.

This is quite an easy and delicious recipe (the chopping takes some time, yes). You do have to cook it down for longer than the recipe calls for to get the right consistency. The pungent flavour from the cooked down tomatoes is exceptional.

I like to make jam in the summer to give out as Christmas gifts. This has been a really big hit. Make a double batch so you have some to keep also! It is really good as an appetizer spread on a sliced sourdough baguette, and then topped with a small wedge of brie cheese.

By far this is the best marmalade I have eaten. This was really easy, although all the chopping was a bit fiddley. I cut the oranges and lemon into eighthes instead of quaters before slicing because I prefer a finer peel in marmalade. I found it was easier to slice the citrus when I placed them sideways on the cutting board with the peel facing me.

I think the flavor and texture of this marmalade is outstanding, not to mention the lovely appearance in glass jars. I had to cook the mixture almost two hours before it was thick enough, and I ended up with a little over 5 cups instead of 3 (so be sure you have adequate jars to put it in. This will be a wonderful hostess or holiday gift from the kitchen.
