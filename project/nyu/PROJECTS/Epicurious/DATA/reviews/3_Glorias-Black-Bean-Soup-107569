This is the first recipe off Epicurious in a long, long time that I thought was truly terrible. I made it exactly as written. Before I added the sugar, it tasted bad, and after I added the sugar and salt it was worse. It just had this gross bitter taste, but no actual flavor. I couldn't taste any elements of the pepper-onion-garlic mixture. And the bay leaf and oregano-- usually the key flavors in a black bean soup-- were also lost. I threw out nearly the whole batch--and that's rare for me: I hate to throw away food. It was just inedible.

An authentic cuban black bean soup recipe has a touch of sherry at the end.... mmmmm

I started this search for a Red Pepper & Black Bean soup recipe. (Trying to duplicate Campbell's Select Roasted Red Pepper & Black Bean soup). After 2 hours of searching this site and others, I decided on this recipe. I did puree all of it, which was what I was wanting. The only thing that saved it, was, adding; a can of roasted tomatoes, red wine reduction, balsalmic glaze, and finally, a can of pumpkin puree.

This is just the black bean soup recipe I was looking for! Simple, lower in fat, flavorful with an emphasis on the on the black beans (which I love). We ate it over the course of a few days and it just got better and better. I plan to make it again this weekend as a hearty vegetarian alternative to the chili I'm making for our annual open house. This time, though, I'll reduce the sugar and salt by 1/2 tablespoon each.

I found this soup to be lovely and satisfying. I'd feared it might be a bit lonely without any visible vegetables, but the vegetable puree and generous amount of olive oil gave it richness. I would suggest adding half the salt at first and then tasting - for me, 2 tablespoons was too much. And do make sure the beans are well cooked!

i've made this recipe several times and my family loves it. I've taken it to potlucks and everyone has loved it and didn't add sour cream either maybe I'm just used to eating beans I don't know but i really like this recipe.

I once read a review where something was described as "boring vegetable sludge." Unfortunately, that is exactly what I had in mind the first time I sampled this labor of Sunday afternoon love. I didn't have fresh oregano, but it would have taken a lot more than that to save this. I brought it to a group of 12 people, most who ate it, but only one made a positive comment about it. I added some chilis in adobo at the last minute in a ditch effort to make it edible, and whipped up some fresh pico de gallo which was crucial. Served with shredded cheese and light sour cream -- which I hate to do, because I feel like a good soup shouldn't need the help. Next time I will either choose a recipe that is decidedly southwestern and uses more than two spices, or keep making the AMAZING "black bean and pumpkin soup" that is also on epicurious. Definitely give that one a try if you haven't already -- it eats circles around this one.

The quest for the best black bean soup recipe has been one I been on for a number of years, now. This recipe definately ends the quest. Without a doubt the most wonderfully balanced perfect rendition I have yet tasted - with or without meat. Try using whole cumin and roast it (as you do with an Indian Curry), then use the mortar and pestal to mash them with the fresh oregano. Add these last just minutes before serving - it really differentiates the flavours. Thanks Gloria!

I never made a black bean soup before, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but this soup did not have as much flavor as I hoped that it would. Adding sour cream and salsa definitely helped it out, but I am not sure I would make this soup again. However, it was pretty filling!

I have made this recipe many times. I prefer less water than the recipe calls for (I like the soup a little thick) and a little more salt. I also add a spoonful of chipotle sour cream which gives the soup a wonderful creamy texture and smokey flavor. To make the sour cream add a teaspoon of chipotle adobe into a 16 oz container of sour cream and mix.

Just the smell of this robust soup is reason to make it over and over again. I boiled the beans in chicken stock and added a couple of serrano peppers. It was really good soup. This will be a regular at my house.

I have made this soup sooo many times that I rarely need to look at the recipie, I always add either double smoked bacon, farmer's sausage or a few drops of liquid smoke if I am going vegetarian. This is by far one of the most popular meals in my home. We eat it at least once a month. Instead of sour cream garnish, try some parmesan cheese

I enjoed this, (it's bland as is) but I did mod it somewhat-used 1/3 less water and 1/2 the oil, also because I had no fresh red peppers on hand used bottled red peppers and regular green peppers. Also did not puree all the vegies-just about 1/3. Did puree the beans to thicken (VERY necessary!) Added Andouille sausage- really compliments the soup-plus I used less oregano and more cilantro-less salt and used cracked black pepper- dash hot sauce at presentation! Needed this to let the flavors come through!

We love this soup!!! Have made it 4 or 5 times. Don't be shy in the oregano dept., if you don't have fresh, use all dried. It does not overwhelm the recipe. I do run all or part of the batch thru the food processor, which thickens it considerably. It is so much better if you garnish it (once it's in the bowl) with a couple spoonfuls of pico de gallo. In the height of fresh tomato season, I made a batch of "pico" using both yellow and red pear tomatoes, red onions, some jalapeños, and of course cilanto and salt. I can't begin to describe how beautiful the bowls of black bean soup were, garnished with yellows and reds and greens -- and no one could stop eating it because it was so good.

I would try it with less olive oil. i used the recommended amount and I am not convinced it is necessary. I also added chili pepper or hot pepper for a little more taste. It was not the best black bean soup I've ever had. I missed those other things like lime, and potatoes etc. Also call for fresh oregano...not necessary. I also used a thickening agent; the soup looked too runny. Okay!!!!

This is by far the best black bean soup I've ever made, or tasted, for that matter. I used less salt and less olive oil. I did not find it labor-intensive, just intensely flavourful. Thank you, Gloria, and your mother, too.

This soup was very tasty, especially the next day. I halved it, and added a jalapeno, but that was the only mod I made. There was too much water with the beans at the end for my liking, so I drained some out, and pureed some of the bean mixture as well to thicken it up a bit. Husband thought it baby food-ish, but I thought it was great! Maybe next time I'll follow the recipe and leave the beans whole. Served with monterrey jack, some fresh pico, and tortilla chips instead of the recommended sour cream and red onion.

I used the pressure cooker instead and in 20 minutes the beans were soft and ready for the sofrito. If you use sufficient water, 1 tablespoon of salt is enough. Also added a little cilantro and nixed the sugar. Was great!

I made this recipe for our weekly "soup night" and everyone enjoyed it. I have never made nor eaten black bean soup before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I would imagine most recipes would have a bit more kick. I did not follow the recipe exactly, for various reasons. Since I was cooking for a crown, I quadrupled the recipe. I did not quadruple the olive oil, however. I used 1.5 cups extra virgin. The taste did come through; I agree one should use a quality oil. I omitted the shallots due to budget constraints and used minced garlic from a jar. I used 5 large onions, and a package of frozen mixed peppers (shocking, I know, but I had it already...) In the middle of everything, I discovered there was no oregano in the house, so I substituted dried marjoram (which I'm told is acceptable - who knew?. I acquired some ground oregano from a neighbor and added a heaping tablespoon for good measure, in place of the fresh oregano (horrors!) As luck would have it, I had only 2 of the 4 Tbs. of cumin my adjusted recipe calls for , so I added 1 Tbs. sweet paprika, and 2 Tbs. chili powder. I followed the others' lead and started with a fraction of the salt called for, but ended up adding more. I also added more chili powder and some black pepper. Next time I will use less sugar, more cumin, and maybe some cayenne. Also, next time I will assemble all of my ingredients ahead of time! And, I liked sour cream with this soup.

This was excellent, and a good one for the food processor. Like Liz, next time I'll start with less salt - say a tablespoon - and ramp up; I'm also going to try brown sugar instead of white. IMO, unlike the recipe indicates, sour cream is NOT an option. (A little grated Jack or soft Mexican cheese sprinkled on top might be good, too - perhaps some cliantro?) Overall, a delightful dish, and one I'll be making again soon.

I followed the directions exactly and the soup came out WAY too Salty-- not just slightly. Leads me to wonder if there's a typo in the recipe- 2 Tablespoons of salt should be 2 Teaspoons instead? Start with 2 teaspoons- you can always add, but as I found out after 3 hours of cooking this soup, you can't take away. Seems very tasty otherwise, although it's labor intensive.
