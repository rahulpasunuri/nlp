I made this recipe for an office pot luck and it was a hit. I cooked and chopped (following the exact recipe) the night before and assembled in the morning and it was perfect. I also added some chopped walnuts which gave it good texture. It didn't look as nice by the evening, so I would say don't make a day ahead.

Yum. Summer in your mouth. Great way to use up your CSA veggies. I added turnips...that was pretty okay. Great to bring to a picnic, group events. Mmmm.

My husband has never been a fan of potato salad unless made the traditional way with mayonnaise so I was skeptical about introducing him to an updated version. It was a great success! I am glad I tossed the last bit of vinaigrette in the end or it would have been too dry. With that said, it was not quite as delicious the second day. Even so, I will definitely make this again!

Easy and good warm or cold. I used red potatoes with skins on and scallions. Will certainly make again.

This was wonderful this summer when we grilled outside. Beautiful color when presented. Yummy

Very nice dish. I used red skinned potatoes, and didn't use the onions and celery. The vinaigrette was wonderful, although I didn't use it all to dress the salad. We just tend to like things a bit lighter.

The vinagrette was delicious. I made the recipe excactly and it was excellent. The next time I added it bit of crumbled cooked prociutto because I had some and it was also good, but not necessary if your beans and pototoes really flavourful.

I changed this a bit, for the better I think. I used small red potatoes w/skins left on. Used scallions instead of red onions. Added fresh dill and crumbled bacon. Good warm or cold. Also used a little more dijon mustard.
