Bland and uninteresting. I made it exactly according to the recipe. Then to make it so I could serve it I had to start doctoring it. In the end I had an OK dip, but I am rating the recipe as is.

Delicious. Made few changes-small eggplant, sliced, brushed w/olive oil & broiled made it faster. Will try grilling for a smokier flavor. Also will add more garlic & maybe more lemon. Am addicted to Trader Joe's eggplant hummus & this has a fresher taste & less $$.

If you like both "regular" hummus and eggplant, then this is a great combination of the two. The recipe was flavorful and easy to make (the only time consuming thing was roasting the eggplant for 1.5 hours). I recommend adding more garlic and roasting the garlic beforehand. I did not use parsley and did not miss it.

I made this for the first time last night, and really enjoyed it. I think it's a simple and delicious way to enjoy eggplant. I used cannellini beans instead of chick peas and it worked well. (I prefer cannellini; I think they're milder.)

I thought this was fantastic! I love garlic so I tripled it and left out the parsley. This was great served on pita with veggies for lunch.

I love hummus, but really didn't like this recipe. I did make one mistake and put the parsley into the processor rather than in at the end. It was not appetizing with the eggplant seeds, not a pretty color and not much flavor. I did take the previous reviewers tips and used roasted garlic which was nice. Overall though I was disappointed and won't make again.

This is also called baba ghanouj. It is better after sitting in the fridge the next day. sometimes I scrape the seeds out if the eggplant is the big fat purple kind. I also like to add some of the skin for flavor and color.

This was really easy to make a very flavorful. I loved it and made it for guests, who loved it too.

Very tasty - the eggplant lightens up the usual hummus recipe and the chickpeas make it richer-tasting than a typical baba ganoush

I made this for the second time tonight and some little adjustments tonight made it much better than my first attempt. I usually take lots of short cuts and use chopped garlic and bottled lemon juice but tonight I had the real stuff on hand so I gave it a whirl. The fresh garlic and lemon made a huge difference - it was much better this time! And fyi - I was out of fresh parley so I omitted that but it was still great!

I am now on my 4th batch of this, with minor adjustments along the way. Am leaving the skins on the eggplant, and pureeing a little longer. Better the next day, if it lasts that long.

A wonderful recipe and one worth saving. I adjusted the amounts of lemon, salt, tahini and parsley to account for the size of my eggplant, but was true to the ingredient list otherwise. My only other adjustments were that I smoke/grilled the eggplant (smoke pan in the grill) rather than baking it, and seasoned further with S&P at the end. We had a bit tonight -delicious - but I'm looking forward to tasting it tomorrow as I'm sure the flavours will develop a bit more. To stevelvv: no, this is not Baba Ghanoush...

I really liked this a lot - made it basically as written except that I probably used more parsley than they expected. I highly recommend.

I barbequed the eggplant which I think added a nice smokiness. I had to use limes instead of lemons - I wouldn't recommend doing this. I would also make it a day ahead to let the flavors blend a bit - tasted better the next day.

I just made this & thought it was fabulous. I am watching my weight, so I sprayed the eggplant with an olive oil-flavored non- stick spray before cooking it, and only added a teaspoon of olive oil to the pureed dip. Also, I did not use the parsley (I hate to buy a whole bunch of parsley to use only a little bit). I love highly-flavored foods, and this was tangy and wonderful. I plan to have this for lunch in a lo-cal wrap with some romaine lettuce.

This is the best hummus I've made. I used a few cloves of roasted garlic instead of the fresh, to take out the bite. I served it with fresh veggies for a delicious, healthy dinner.

We love hummus, and we like eggplant. Somehow this didn't come together into a tasty combination for me. My daughter, she of the wine-tasting palate, analyzed it by saying that it was good initially and not bad at the end, but the "middle" taste was off. And of course it looked quite nasty.

To the "Cook from Philadelphia": Making the same comment 500 times is not necessary. This is a very nice dip, and if you thought it was silly, skip it and make comments on recipes that you have tried.

We used this as a side to grilled chicken and it was delicious!

If you leave out the half-cup of chickpeas, it's called baba ghanouj. Really, talk about maximizing the number of "recipes"....maybe next there can be a recipe for bolognese sauce, to which one adds a half-cup of chili. It's a whole new recipe!

I made this last night for a perfect and fast summer dinner. I used frozen grilled egg plant so the whole thing came together in less than 10 minutes. I turned it into a meal by making a salad and adding scoops of the hummus along with feta, tomatoes, olives and cucumber. It was a perfect summer dinner.

Everyone loved this appetizer and ate it all at my party! This was a yummy spin on traditional hummus. I added a little extra lemon juice and tahini for extra flavor. Don't forget to add salt and pepper.
