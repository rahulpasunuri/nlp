This is an easy recipe and I enjoyed the final result, but you must be careful not to overcook! Its a little less than you might think and the outside of this guy gets a little crusty. That said, the flavor was wonderful and it was very fast to make. A good basic, I served with homemade strawberry sauce.

way, way too dry. I tried to resurrect it by making a frosting, and it was still too dry

One more thing, careful not to overstir pound cake. I added the coffee before i mixed the dry and wet ingredients, and that may have been a factor in how moist it was.

This cake seems worth making just for the batter-it's very rich and thick. I didn't have espresso powder so I just used plain coffee, and added a teaspoon of cream, just to test it. I baked it for forty five minutes and it came out wonderfully moist. Everyone loved it!

This cake was too dry. Luckily, I made a raspberry sauce to put on it or it woould have been inedible.

Two forks for taste; but jeez -- it came out like a brick. I did 40 minutes for two loaf pans. 30 probably would have been better, but who knew.

I was looking for a recipe I made once before and I think this is it except the recipe I had had a sour cream and brown sugar topping with strawberries on the side.. If the cake is dry, it was baked too long. I never go by the time listed on a recipe. I check it well before to see if it is done. And I almost never bake cakes for 1 hr.

I added 8oz. of sour creme and baked the cake for 1 hour, based on the reviews stating it was dry. I then coated it with a chocolate and Jack Daniels ganache and served it with vanilla ice creme. It was dry. My husband, a fan of all things stale, loved it.

This cake is way too dry. I would not make it again

A nice but not stunning cake-- travels and freezes well. I never bake longer than an hour, and skimp on the sugar. Toasted almonds make a nice addition to this cake.

This is a winner. It looks great but more than that it taste wonderful. It is a taste of true chocolate delight. Easy to make and easier to eat!
