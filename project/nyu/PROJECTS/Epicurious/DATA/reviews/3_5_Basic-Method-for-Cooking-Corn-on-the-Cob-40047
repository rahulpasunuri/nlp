For 40 years I have made corn this way -- WO the salt. The really good thing is you can make it up to thirty minutes ahead freeing time for the rest of your meal. It's one few perfect cooking suggestions I have learned in life.

When I came across this recipe immediately clicked on to say "never boil corn in salted water" and what did I see, most of us already know that. Although I've never used sugar do know many who do.

NEVER EVER cook corn in salted water. Makes for really tough corn. And if cooked for more than 5 minutes it is mush. Bring water to a boil. Add 2 tbl of sugar & 2 tbl. of vinigar. When water is boiling at a full boil, add corn cobs. Cover, remove from heat & let set 3-5 minutes. NO MORE! Perfect corn. This recipe has changed the lives of many corn lovers. Most from corn country.

You should never boil corn in salted water...it makes the corn tough. Instead, add a few teaspoons of sugar to your boiling water to enhance the sweet taste of the corn.

The best corn on the cob is a cob with smallish kernels, boiled NO MORE THAN 3 minutes. Trust me. It's fool proof. Add salt or whatever after it's cooked. Easy easy.

Thank you all for the sugar tip- trying it tonight. I used this method when making corn on the cob to eat with baby back ribs, since we were trying to make all of this without actually owning a grill. It was unbelievably easy, fast, and with perfect results. I love complex recipes, but why needlessly complicate something so good?

Not a good idea to boil the corn in salted water, especially for long periods of time as the salted water will toughen the kernals. Add one tsp of sugar to water, bring to a boil, add husked corn and cook for 10 minutes MAX.

I'm converting my friends who boil their corn for twenty minutes to this five minute after-boil method.

Somewhere wayyyyyyyyyyy back someone suggested boiling water, 2 tbls SUGAR, 2 tablespoons of vinegar. Put corn in the boiling water. Cover, take off the burner. Eat it in 7 minutes. My son-in-law was raised in corn country. I cooked the corn he brought this way--he couldn't believe it. It's the only way he'll cook corn now. He leaves the salt shaker on the table.

A nice easy method for cooking corn. My mom always boiled it to death so that's what I've been doing all these years. I used the sugar instead of the salt. Very tasty

As a college student, quick, easy, cheap food is a must. I've taken to making corn on the cob this way whenever I have people over, or when I'm making a picnic dinner. It's great!! The only thing I add is pepper in addition to salt when serving. PS~ This keeps hot for about half an hour if you put it in aluminum foil. That also makes it great for transporting/serving.

The worst corn I have ever cooked. It was extremely tough and I followed the recipe exactly.

My customers love this corn. I use extra (double or triple) the amount of salt because it makes the corn so tender and tasty.

I wasn't zapping the frozen stuff, so I decided to go back to basics and was very glad I did! Subbed the sugar for the salt and added the vinegar and it was the tastiest, yet easiest, part of the meal.

I actually never got a taste. It all evaporated before the plate got around to me. I took the sugar/no salt advice of many of you. I will try it again over the next week.

This is the way I cook my corn except the only difference is, I don't use salt. I use sugar. Salt toughens the corn. My corn can sit in the pot of water for more than 10 min. without getting tough.

I have tried unsuccessfully so many times to cook corn with consistent quality, this recipe is PERFECT. The corn comes out crisp and juicy every time and it's so easy.

Corn is perfect every time. We used to cook it to death.

I am reviewing Niki's Grandmother's recipe using 2 tablespoons of sugar & 2 tablespoons of vinegar. I have been using her recipe for a long time & am never disappointed. It comes out sweet & crisp, no matter how old the corn is. If you want tough corn--add salt to the boiling water.

Salt?!? NEVER, NEVER, NEVER! A pinch or 2 or sugar in boiling water, in goes the corn, then turn down to simmer and leave corn in til tender (any longer than 8 minutes and fresh corn season is over in your part of the country). BTW, the sugar does indeed complement the vegetable's natural high sugar contant ("bring out the sweetness"), as opposed to adding sugar to the dish.

Ok, I am not a cook. It says cook in salted water. Just what exactly is that? How much salt per how much water?

Cooking corn on the cob is obviously a very simple thing to do, and the results are nearly foolproof if you don't overcook the corn. I found this recipe intuitive and clear, and made some delicious corn. The varieties of corn DO make a difference! Learn about different types of corn and you'll enjoy a lot of good flavor.

I BOUGHTA DOZEN FRESH EARS OF CORN FROM A FARMER'S MARKET, FOLLOWED YOUR DIRECTIONS, AND HAD THE BEST CORN ON THE COB EVER. IT WAS DONE TO PERFECTION. I WISH I HAD A DOZEN MORE, BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN EATEN. THANKS.

This was the best way to cook corn ever....just great. It was tender and sweet...done to perfection.

The tenderness and freshness of corn should determine the cooking time. Although the method seems to produce a more tender corn than keeping the water at a boil to cook. Adding salt to the water does seem to toughen the corn. Adding sugar doesn't 'bring out the sweetness,' rather, the added sugar is the sweetener... if you like sugared vegetables. As far as the reviewer who decided that this recipe 'tasted like crap'... hmmm, if you can't cook a recipe this simple, it must be your ingredients or skills that are lacking.

My grandmother's recipe for corn included equal amounts of sugar and vinegar (about 2 T), then 7 minutes off heat and covered in water that had been brought to boil. It was always delicious, no matter how fresh the corn was.

If you are using "fresh" picked sweet corn, you would only want to bring the water to a boil and then add corn for no longer than 3 minutes. This recipe is fine for store bought corn. Although I agree with the other critics, that you should never add salt. I have added sugar, but prefer to add a little molasses.

I think adding salt toughens the corn. I add a tablespoon of sugar and one of lemon. This brings out the sweetness in the corn.

To make the corn even sweeter, try using sugar instead of salt in the cooking water.

How about using the microwave ? Much simpler than boiling water. I pull down the husk, remove the threads then pull the husk back up. Cook for approx. 5 mins on medium-high. Spead with butter. This way none of the flavour is lost to the water.
