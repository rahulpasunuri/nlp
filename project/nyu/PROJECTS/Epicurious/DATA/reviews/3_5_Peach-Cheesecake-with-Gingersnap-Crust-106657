Followed this recipe exactly except for one small exception. I'm not sure about how everyone else felt about the size of the 9" springform but I felt like the amount of ingredients were really more suited to a 10"springform. So I used a 10" and baked for 75 minutes. I was sceptical of the peach compote inside the cheesecake but it was really delicious!This is a winner for a late summer ending barbeque finale!!!!

First time trying to make a cheesecake. I am not an experience cook so I found the lack of specific instructions unnerving, but the result was awesome! I probably cooked it for an hour and a half, not the 1 hour. And I was still worried about it when I finally pulled it out. I would definitely make this one again. http://yfrog.com/5gbfrnj

I'm not all that great at baking, yet I attempted this anyway. It was going well, until it hit about an hour and 15 minutes of baking... I was running late for a date... so I turned the oven off and left it in there to finish baking/gradually cool. My cheesecake cracked. So I used the glaze and garnishing peaches to cover the imperfections and it tasted great! So, if I can make it turn out well, anyone could...

This has become my default cheesecake recipe! I've made it a few times with the peach/ginger combo, but it's so much fun to experiment with my own flavors. My personal favorite? Chocolate raspberry. I use chocolate cookies for the crust, a bit of almond extract and mini chocolate chips in the filling, and fresh raspberries mixed in, with a few dropped right into the top before baking. Yum!

I have made this cheesecake several times for office functions, and it is always a hit. As far as the gingersnap crust, I found that if you pop the ground up cookies into the microwave for about 30 seconds, they will soften up a bit and absorb more of the butter. I always add another 1/2 tsp ground ginger to the crust mix, which really pops against the flavor of the peaches. I also add about 1/4 C Peach Schnapps to the filling mixture. You really have to let the compote cool to room temperature before you work with it, else the filling will come out soggy on the middle.

Rating: 4
This came out exceptionally creamy and delicious and I definitely will make it again. The only thing I would change would be to peel my peaches first next time (maybe I was supposed to in the first place?) as the little bits of fuzzy skin in the compote was a bit weird. I cooked it for about an hour 20 mins on 300 degrees in a water bath.

Love this recipe but didn't have peaches however I did have mangoes and they worked beautifully. Everyone loved the cake. I used some apricot jam drizzled on top and then sliced a fresh mango and laid it in a cirle on top. Very nummie!

Best cheesecake I ever baked or tasted! i doubled the crust recipe for thicker crust, halved the sugar in the cheese mix and made extra compote for the top instead of fresh peaches/glaze. the combination of flavors (gingersnaps/peaches) is what makes this cheesecake stellar.

Loved loved LOVED this. I'm pretty particular about cheesecake, but this had a fantastic tase. I made it for a potluck & everyone had seconds. The only substitution I made was canned peaches (in juice, drained) since peaches were not in season at the time. It was still great.

I made two of these cheesecakes this weekend for separate events. I didn't have gingersnaps this time so I spiced up graham cracker crumbs with 1 tsp. ginger, 3/4 tsp. cinnamon, and a pinch of ground cloves. There is plenty of batter in this recipe for 10" cakes, which is what I make. The fruit tends to sink a bit, so I put more than half in before adding the compote, being careful to leave enough batter to cover the fruit. As others have said, I always have to bake this longer than stated, about 1 1/4 - 1 1/2 hrs. This is an impressive do-ahead dessert that always gets raves.

This is an amazing cheesecake! I used 16oz of gingersnaps and an extra stick of butter for a deeper crust. I also added an extra peach to the filling. It turned out fabulous! I used a water bath and my cake came out with no cracks for the perfect presentation! If you do use the extra gingersnaps and peach, make sure you adjust the springform pan size to 10inch.

I made this dessert for a potluck meeting. It disappeared in a flash. I was barely lucky enough to taste my own creation. :) I used a 9.5 in pan. I used 9 oz of ginger snaps to get anything up the sides. 12 oz would have been just as good. I did notice I also had the pool of butter under the pan. But I noticed that ginger snaps I used didn't seem like they would absorb butter like graham crackers would. People were intrigued by the use of ginger snaps. After the hour baking time, my cheesecake was still wobbly and wasn't even close to being set. So I just turned off my oven and left it in there until the oven completely cooled. I made the cheesecake in the evening so I left it there over night. The next morning I put it in the fridge. As for topping, I had some apricot preserves I had left over and used that instead of the peach. I lined the edge with fresh raspberries then put the glaze over the top. I liked the raspberry.

This was a big hit, especially with the guys. I used a 10" cheesecake pan and it was perfect. I cut the crust butter in half and used 6 oz of "Swedish style". Cooked the compote for about an hour, breaking it up wtih a spoon (it made the perfect amount) and cooked the cheesecake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, turned the oven off and left it in for an hour. It was perfect. The peaches are awesome right now so I'm going to make some compote and freeze it and make this again in the winter.

What a fantastic cheesecake...I added chopped toasted pecans to the crust and baked it for an extra 20 minutes or so...peaches and apricots together make it even better! I will make this recipe again and again...

I've made this recipe twice and had rave reviews. I make the filling first and let it cool. Then, I make the crust and cheesecake. I had to bake it longer than one hour. I didn't strain the preserves and used a whole peach to decorate. I marinated the peach to decorate in liquor (I used lemoncello) and the lemon juice for about four hours. A half peach is not as pretty on the top.

I only gave this two forks because I'm not crazy about fruit desserts, unless they are tart. But I have to say that I don't know why so many people had trouble with this recipe! I had NO problems at all and I am not at all experienced with cheesecakes. I've probably only made 6 or 7 total not all even turned out well. I had no problem with the crust. I had no problem with cracking. I did a water bath. This turned out perfect (except that I couldn't get the inside to look quite as nice as the photo here.) and was well-received by my guests. I was REALLY nervous about possibly wasting time and money making this, based on the reviews, but it was really a breeze.

This didn't turn out quite how I expected... the filling was incredibly creamy and custard-like prior to baking, but afterwards it was almost fluffy in texture. Cutting the peaches was a lot of work, but the presentation was worth it. I really didn't like the crust... tried doubling the cookies as some others indicated, but it came out mushy after baking... maybe I used bad cookies. I much prefer the caramel-hazelnut cheesecake recipe to this one.

This cheesecake was fabulous, and it is so true that it is ideal to do ahead and travels well. Everyone loved it and it looked like a magazine cover. I used reduced fat sour cream and cooked it about 10 minutes longer than suggested and it was perfect. I topped it with fresh peaches and blueberries in a little flower design. I would definitely make it again, with whatever fruit happens to be in season at the time!

I usually love recipes from this site, and knew I was taking a chance based on the reviews. I made 2 small modifications to the recipe based on other reviewers suggestions: I doubled the qty of cookies without increasing the butter, and I added some Peach Schnapps. The cheesecake was good, and got a lot of compliments, but I didn't think it was great. The crust didn't leak but it was soggy and butter-heavy and the flavor of the cheesecake wasn't special, though the texture was nice. I've made fruit versions of Rose Levy Beranbaum's Cheesecake from her 'Cake Bible' book that were far superior. I highly recommend her version; you can't stop eating it!

I made this for a dinner party, it was a big hit. Everyone raved. It was not set in one hour, I think I cooked it at least 30 min. longer. I used the called for # of cookies but I added toasted pecans to the crust. It was delicious! I didn't bother simmering the lemon juice and preserves, I just bought a good quality peach jam, wisked it a bit and glazed the cake with that.

I made it for a dinner party and it was the highlight of the evening. What a light and fruity dessert for the summer. I would suggest using twice as many cookies as suggested for the crust as it was not quite enough for presentation as I usually like.

This is a very good, dependable recipe. The cheesecake is so creamy. Do be careful with browing the crust as it can quickly turn rock hard. Another tip -- buy GOOD QUALITY ginger snap cookies or the crust will be nothing special. It is worth the small cost difference. I've made it with peaches multiple times and even with Ranier cherries one time. Do people like it? It is one recipe I receive requests for from friends and family. In fact I'm making it with blueberries for a birthday celebration this weekend. A keeper for sure.

Made this for my husband's birthday. It was quite good but I did encounter some of the same problems others had. The butter leaked from the crust (fortunately, I put foil under it before cooking....what a mess it would have been had I not). I have a convection oven and didn't lower the temperature enough so the top got VERY brown (fortunately didn't taste burnt) during the first 1/2 hour of cooking. I covered it with foil and continued to bake for the remaining 1/2 hour. The middle didn't set so I kept it in for another 20 minutes. Then I turned off the oven and left it in the oven till the oven cooled. Was cooked perfectly. The top did sink quite a bit....when I put the glaze on top it puddled in the middle. I also brushed the glaze around the outside of the cheesecake which gave it a nice shine. I think there should be more compote in the middle....will do that the next time. I doubled the crust recipe which was a perfect amount, however, the corners were quite hard and impossible to eat. My husband and everyone else loved it. I may make this again but with a few adjustments.

I've made this cheesecake now a few times and it's always been great.I made it last weekend for my mother-in-law's 85th birthday and because there were going to be a lot of people there, I decided to make it in a 10" springform pan. I increased the filling by about a fifth (5 eggs instead of 4, 5 pkgs. of cr. ch., etc.) I always increase the crust, including the butter because I love the crust and always want more. I get the gingersnaps from Trader Joe's - their 3 ginger kind so there's a little chewy ginger in it as well. Also, per a suggestion made much earlier, I add Peach schnaps to both the filling and compote. Except that this time, since it's summer and I had really good peaches (organic), I felt I didn't have to. And lastly, I approximate the baking time, starting with an hour and then checking to see if the color on top has gotten brown. This time, though, I realized I had a hair appointment and wouldn't be able to let it finish baking so I pulled it out of the oven after about 5 minutes, stuck it in the fridge and then baked it (chilled)later on. It came out done but exceptionally creamy! In fact I felt like in the very middle it was almost a custard. Maybe this is what people are talking about when they feel it was undercoooked. But can cheesecake custard be bad??? NO ONE complained. Not at all.

Rating: 3
I followed the suggestions of so many posters on this and it turned out great. More gingersnaps and the same amount of butter made the crust almost too dry, but it worked out fine. I baked the cake for exactly an hour and let it sit in the oven for more than an hour after baking. It looked perfect, slightly brown and puffed, no cracks, but when I served it the next day it was slightly undercooked in the center. There were no complaints, only compliments, but another 10 or 15 minutes baking would have done wonders, as so many people noted.

Rating: 2
After the rave reviews, I was excited to try this recipe using some fresh peaches from the farmers market - but it was an utter disappointment. As many others had mentioned, the one hour baking time is wholly insufficient, but because a few other reviewers had had good luck leaving it in the oven for a second hour with the heat turned off, I tried that - it was STILL underbaked. I turned the heat back on and it eventually firmed up but then also cracked and got too dark on top. Perhaps it got a bit overbaked in the process of rectifying the inadequate baking time in the recipe, but the texture just seemed off in the final product and the peach slices inside were very mushy and unattractive. I did think the crust had potential and was a nice twist on the usual, but I probably won't bother with this one again.

Haven't made this yet, but I cross-referenced some other gingersnap crust recipes on this site after reading the reviews and most use half as much butter for the same amount of gingersnaps. Try it. It might solve the excess butter problem. I shall do that when I make this.

Made this for the second time this weekend, with the following changes. First, I used a 9 1/2" springform pan instead of the 81/2" I baked it in the first time, and the consistency was perfect after an hour. Second, I doubled the number of gingersnaps in the crust but left the same amount of butter. Still wasn't satisfied; while the crust didn't leak butter like other reviewers said, it was hard as a rock and very difficult to slice. I also didn't feel the gingersnap flavour came through, so I'll continue to experiment with that. Maybe a combination gingersnap/graham cracker crust with some chopped walnuts or pecans thrown in? Third, I added 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger, extra lemon juice and 2 heaping tablespoons of finely chopped crystallized ginger to the peach filling, and it really woke up. This is a great basic recipe, and I'll continue to tweak and experiment with it.

After reading all the reviews, i tried baking the cheesecake the suggested 1 hour and then I turned the oven off and kept it in the oven for an additional hour to cool. The center was not runny and the consistency was better. Also, when cutting this cake, try dipping the knife in hot water between every cut and you will find it easier to handle. This recipe made a great hit....

I read the previous comments before I made this (thanks fellow cooks!) and added 5 or so extra gingersnaps to the crust. Also, I added a squeeze of lemon to the filling. I did cook it an extra 15 min and it settled with a large crack in the middle that had me worried that I'd overcooked it. The peach garnish covered the crack so it was not an aesthetic problem. It turned out great and I got rave reviews from my guests. It is messier to cut than some cheesecakes I've had in the past and the crust was a little soggy on the remaining cake the next day, but I will definitely make this again! It is very beautiful and a twist on the the standard cheesecake with strawberries.

I would definately make this again, but with a few changes. The gingersnap crust leaked butter all over... good thing I did put the foil underneath while baking... so I would use a graham crust next time. Also after 1 hour and 10 minutes it still was not cooked in the center, so will cook for 1 1/2 hours next time. Everyone raved about it in spite of the above, it was a very creamy and delicious cheesecake.

A lot of work to make, used a graham cracker crust that worked. The entire affair tasted great but recipe called for 1 hour cooking time which is totally inadequate. After 1 hour cooking at the prescribed temp of 350° the top looks done with some golden browning and appeared set but the center was not set and when cut made a rather messy presentation. This was disappointing and a little embarassing after all the work, but it did taste good for peach cheesecake soup.

I've made this twice, same problems with the crust as others describe; will try something different next time. Also cooked it at least an hour & a half. The second time I didn't use all of the compote and it worked out better. (Using all of it, the first time, covered the whole cake with no spaces in between the spoonfulls.) Besides all that, I loved it & so did family & guests.

Love it. After reading the reviews I didn't use the recipe crust. I always make my own anyway. For this recipe try 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar 1 tsp ground ginger, 1 stick butter, 1 egg yolk. Mix the flour, sugar and ginger. Cut in butter and egg yolk. Crust will be crumbly. Spoon enough crust mix to cover bottom of spring form pan. Bake at 400 degrees 7 min or until golden brown. Let cool (this is a good time to mix together the rest of the cheesecake)on rack. Butter sides of pan. Attach to bottom and pat the remaining crust mixture to the sides of pan, poor in cheesecake mixture and cook as directed.

I agree the crust is a mess. Butter runs all over. Ginger flavor is great, but need to figure out a way to make it easier to slice, with no butter melting. I added fresh raspberries to the peach compote after I took it off of the heat. They blended well with the peaches.

I've made this twice in the past two weeks, once with the peaches, and once without. Brilliant either way. However, next time, I'll use Graham cracker crust - the ginger snaps ooze butter/syrup in the final stages of baking, and over the next few days as its sits in the refridgerator, it continued to ooze. I'd prefer a crispier, sturdier crust. It really is a great, basic NY cheesecake. Plus, I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and no-one noticed. I also think you could put peach slices directly into the middle without cooking/creating the filling as directed.

We all thought the lemon flavor was a little too tart and would have been better if it had been distributed throughout the cake rather than just in the filling and topping. The amount of cookies called for in the recipe weren't enough to cover the bottom of the pan and the baking time seems to be off. I've always baked my cheesecakes until they reach 150 degrees -- this cake took 1 1/2 hours to reach that. All in all, it's an okay recipe but nothing to rave about.

I couldn't wait to rate this cake it was that good. I'm a much better cook than I am baker so I am always a little leary about baking but this one was a true winner. the only problem I had was the amount of gingersnaps did not cover the bottom of my pan so I had to increase a little, and peeling the peaches and then trying to get them off the pit without totally squishing them was a bit of a challenge but worth it in the end. everyone at the dinner party LOVED it and there wasn't even a piece left over.
