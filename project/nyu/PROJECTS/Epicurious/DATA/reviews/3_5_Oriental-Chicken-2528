DELICIOUS! My daughter simply loved this dish. She's only 17 months. I served it with rice. It was fantastic.

I substituted boneless chicken thighs for the chicken breasts, since I tend to dry them out all the time. My family loved this dish and requested to have it again soon. It was savory enough for the adults, but not too spicy for the kids. A definite keeper.

The hubby loved it -- and this from a man who deems my Asian cooking "scary"!! This dish is easy and yummy. I suggest doubling the sauce. You might consider adding tofu or even substituting it for chicken if you're a vegetarian. Enjoy!

I thought this recipe was ok, not as good as some of the reviews suggested. It was quite tasty the next day though. Next time I will try pork tenderloin instead of chicken.

Have made this recipe twice. Also doubled the sauce and substituted an excellent quality spicy teriyaki sauce with ginger (J+E+S brand found in most chinese or oriental markets) for the oyster sauce. Skipped the sugar (the teriyaki sauce added just the right touch of sweetness) and threw in some brocolli as well. All around, a healthy tasty meal that even the fussy eaters in my family enjoy.

I made this last night and it was great! It was quite easy too. I made double the sauce and it was just perfect. My boyfriend raved about it all night!

YUM! I made extra sauce and omitted the veggies for the main course and it was sooooo good! I should have served it with rice so I could sop up the yummy sauce. I will definitely make this again!

Very good. im not familiar with chinese cooking, but still turned out well. i added mushrooms, julienne carrots, toasted sesame seeds, and red pepper flakes. actually added a bit too much flakes, but the sweetness of the sauce ended up merging with the hotness very well, so if you like hot, feel free to spice up this recipe. also tripled the sauce as others had suggested. chicken was delicious fried in the corn starch.

I threw in Bok Choy, Carrots, and Snow Peas. I probably used more meat than the recipe was made for as well, so I tripled the sauce recipe. Came out just right. One of my roommates said of all the meals I've cooked, this was his favorite. Not my favorite, but really, REALLY good.

I think this is my favorite oriental dish from this site so far- I added broccoli to it and it tasted like it came from a FANCY chinese restaurant.

A good starter dish for people not used to Chineese cooking. I personally like pork in stir fry best. I also added a bag of oriental vegetables to add some nutrients and green to my meal. I also like to make both white and brown rice so you can mix them. May want to taste the sauce before adding the sugar. Mine turned out a little on the sweet side.

This was one of the best asian dishes we've had. I used pork instead of chicken and doubled the amount of sauce given since we like a nice sauce over our rice. I omitted the red pepper strips but added broccoli and baby corn. Truly incredible!

This was pretty good although I don't really like the oyster sauce with chicken. My husband and I both agreed the chicken might be better with a sauce made of soy and lemon, although the ginger and garlic were good.

I doubled the sauce as most suggested. Would have been better to increase the sauce by 50%. I also added a diced cayenne pepper and thai pepper from my garden, which really kicked this dish up a notch! Great flavors. Would probably add broccoli or minature corn or some other veggie next time.

This was so good! I made 3 times the amount for sauce & served over basmati rice. Only complaint was lack of color. Snow/sugar peas or something green would be great. Or baby corn. Or Chinese cabbage. HEY! It's the sauce! And triple of it is perfect to serve over rice. Oh. I did add several dashes of toasted sesame oil. Husband said it was "super". That's a win in my book!

This is my specialty now. It's simple, easy, and so yummy!;)

Easy, quick and delicious. Next time I will try some of the suggestions from others, DEFINITELY INCREASE THE SAUCE. This recipe can be altered in many ways, beef, pork, shrimp along with various vegetable changes. The use of toasted sesame seeds sounds great.

I would like to ask a question of some of the cooks out there. I have poor luck dredging meat in cornstarch and then frying. I would like to try this recipe, but am unsure of how to work with the cornstarch-chicken mixture. Any tips for good results?

Thank you Epicurious for another keeper. Formerly from the States, I had a craving for some good oriental food and this did the trick for me!!!! I made this with Broccoli, red peppers and green peppers and onions. Because of the amount of veggies, I doubled the sauce, next time, I would make even more sauce.

I doubled the sauce as well. Easy and tasty. Kids friendly, too!

A good recipe! I also doubled the sauce, I grated the ginger and crushed the garlic,instead of chopping it. I'm not too keen on eating pieces of garlic!! My kids really liked it and I would make it again!

I loved this recipe. I would double the sauce and decrease the oil as suggested before.

For my first forray into Chinese cooking, I am satisfied with the results. Very easy and sure to please most palates. Great with all kinds of veggies; I used mushrooms at others suggestion as well as red and green bell pepper. I think a last minute sprinkling of sesame seeds would create a more visually appealing dish.

I added green beans to this dish and it made all the difference! So aromatic and delicious, just pour over rice and you have a complete meal.

Delicious! I didn't use the entire 1/2 cup of oil..just enough to brown the meat. I agree that next time I would double the sauce. With the amount of sauce as it is, it just coats the meat. I loved this recipe!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I added a little toasted sesame oil and some five spice, it was terrific!!

Really flavorful! I doubled the sauce as advised by previous comments. Everyone loved it. Try it!! I don't think you'll be disappointed!! The chicken was especially good browned in the cornstarch.

Excellent! Serve with a vegetable dish and rice. Serves 2-3, not 4. Will add some mushrooms next time.

This recipe was delicious. We cooked it on the wok of our Red Devil grill and it turned out great. When we make it again I will double the sauce.

This one great recipe!.. I agree with the other review.. double the sauce and its much better, also, If served as a main course, It would barely feed 4 people... I put in water chestnuts and shitaki mushrooms as well as the chicken and there is just a little left over for 2 people... try this its wonderful!

The recipe doesn't make alot of sauce, I doubled it and served over rice. It was a hit.
