@ Sydney, AUS- You can make you own clam juice or liquor by simply buying fresh clams and cooking them in water by themselves.

This could be really good, but it was too salty to eat. Since I added no salt at all, I assume it came from the pancetta. Next time, I will cut the pancetta to 1/4 or 0. I doubled the red peppers, and tripled or quadrupled the garlic. Those levels seemed about right.

This recipe was OK, but I wouldn't try it again. If you like quick recipes, and rather bland food, this recipe might be right for you! Otherwise, look for another recipe.

I also used canned clams and the juice provided and absolutely love it! I am constantly getting requests to make this dish and now make sure that have all the ingredients on hand. Oh and it's easy too!!

A simple, easy recipe that tastes delicious. The pancetta really boosts the flavor.

I have not made this version of spaghetti alla vongole, but it's one of my favourite dishes and, in my opinion, the simpler the better. I would never use pancetta and there is absolutely no need to use bottled clam juice. The Italian waiter who taught me how to make it was adamant that all you need is olive oil and a little white wine. The garlic and chile are a must though.

Cherie, I too have not been able to buy clam juice. However, I have been to a restaurant in Hobart in Tasmania which makes the best clam vongole you would ever taste and he says just use a little fish stock because the clams have their own juice which just add to it. The restaurant is called Conchettas and if you are very in Hobart make sure you go there!

I"m totally lazy and used canned clams, used the juice provided. It was killer. Always using a little more chili pepper, keeps it from being too bland. Served with a fresh cesar salad and the best bread you can find. Very delicous.

I cannot purchase clam juice in Australia - can anyone suggest a substitute please?

This was quick, easy and delicious. I too cut down on the olive oil added more garlic and diced carrots, a leek and some red bell pepper. Being from the Pacific Northwest I used the local Manila Clams... This is a keeper for sure.

easy and fast. Found it a bit salty, unsure if it was the pancetta or the clam broth. Once the clams opened I removed to reduce the sauce and added a small amount of cream, adding the pasta and clams to mix and reheat.

I love this recipe! I make a modified version of it frequently. I skip the pancetta and the hot chiles. I use little neck clams. I prefer a little more garlic and use 2 cloves. I use about 1/4 cup of olive oil, maybe 2/3 of a bottle of clam juice and add about 1 tbsp. of fresh basil. I also add a dab of butter before serving. I think that the recipe is better than the vast majority of italian restaurants that serve spagetti a la vongole. Make sure that you have bread on hand to dip in the juice. Buen Appetite!

This is wonderful! The clam and pancetta flavors work so well together. I agree with previous reviewer that the full amount of olive oil is not needed. Volume of sauce was just right. Cook pasta until 2 minutes before al dente and finish cooking the pasta in the sauce for 2-3 minutes as the pasta will absorb quite a bit of the broth enhancing the flavor.

This is very good. I found that there was too much sauce, so next time I'm going to either boil down the sauce to make it richer or use less bottled clam juice. The pancetta is a wonderful addition.

Very nice pasta. Comes together very easily. The pancetta gives the dish great flavor. I didn't think it needed all of the additional olive oil at the end so I just drizzled some on each person's bowl - maybe 1-2 tsp.

This is the best! We used vongole clams and right at the last minute threw in a tablespoon of butter. It really adds to the flavor.
