This is a dessert that everyone swoons over. It also keep beautifully in the freezer, even after you have topped it with meringue and have left overs. Serve it for your most elegant party or for just a casual get-together. It is sure to be a hit!

Does anyone have any good experience with a particular type of ice cream? I am guessing the hardest and coldest is the best?! Thinking of trying this recipe out, once I find some hard ice cream. Here in Holland it is mainly soft scoop....and yes, it's very soft indeed!

I make this pie every Thanksgiving and have never met anybody who did not LOVE it. I do everything the day before and torch it right before serving. The only suggestion I would make is sometimes you need extra pecans to cover every part of the pan.

Delicious and beautiful! I made as directed with the exception of using the lemon curd recipe from Gourmet 2001. Once the curd is made it's a snap to put together and can be made the day before which is so nice when planning a dinner party. I put the pie under the broiler (flame not coil) and it browned the meringue perfectly. You won't be disappointed in this one!

I used to frequent Josie's on the Upper West Side and fell in love with their lemon ribbon ice cream pie. I have since left NYC and longed for that amazing pie. And then I found this recipe and was oh- so-happy! I used the Gourmet lemon curd recipe & Haagen Dazs ice cream. It was a hit with both grandparents and grandkids. Perfection!

This pie came out amazingly, it was a huge hit with dinner guests, I will definitely be making it again. Putting it in the oven for just a few seconds worked perfectly to toast the meringue since I don't have a kitchen butane torch. I agree with some of the other comments, less sugar and more lemon in the lemon curd would be better.

Excellent make-ahead frozen pie. If using butane torch on meringue, leave whole pie out about 20 minutes before slicing. May substitute fat free butter for 3/6 Tbsp. and Equal to taste instead of sugar. These substitutions do not affect the fabulous results.

I made this for my Grandmother's 80th birthday party (lobster dinner). I followed some of the previous reviewer's suggestions. I used Gourmet '01 recipe for Lemon Curd and doubled the amount of lemon zest, to make it extra lemon-y. I also made a gingersnap crust, because my Mom is allergic to nuts. I suggest buying high quality vanilla ice cream (i.e. from a local shop)- this recipe is a great example of a simple dish that is exceptional when exceptional ingredients are used.

I make this every year for my little brother's birthday, and it comes out great every time. I use mostly graham cracker crumbs for the crust and just like 1/4 cup of crushed pecans to make it more kid friendly. The lemon curd is not particularly lemony but it balances nicely with the vanilla ice cream. A wonderful, easy, guest-pleasing alternative to regular lemon meringue pie!

Impressive and delicious! As noted by another, watch your timing. I did all but the meringue in one day and then finished in the morning. I used a springform pan, but I DO NOT recommend the 500 degree oven for the finish! Mine started to melt and drip after 2 minutes! Think I will try it with almonds sometime. Really not that much work, just quite a few stages.

Made this for a dinner party and everyone LOVED it (bonus: my gluten intolerant friend could have as much as she wanted!). Made/assembled the crust and layers the day before, then froze (with clingwrap pressed on the surface of the pie). Made the meringue and torched it just after dinner while the cake sat out and softened just a touch. Awesome. Oh, few changes: 1) used the Gourmet '01 Lemon Curd recipe instead of the one here (it's more lemony and less sweet) and 2) didn't bother with the multiple layering - just spread all the HaagenDas on the bottom, then the curd later on. 3) for easier presentation, I used a springform with parchment running around the sides and pressed the crust on the bottom only (time to serve = loosen pan sides, remove, then peel off paper collar.) Enjoy!

You best have a big head start on this pie with all of the freezing. I liked the crust but had make 1 and half times the amount- otherwise it didn't sufficiently cover my pie plate.I'd try to cut down on the sugar.

pretty good ice cream pie. I had my doubts while making it, but it turned out fairly o.k. I found it overly sweet even after using only 3/4c sugar in the curd. The ice-cream is what makes it so sweet; maybe I'll make it next time without the ice cream (this time, I used Haagan Daaz dulce de leche, which tasted fine). The crust, I found exceptional. It actually held together very nicely and tasted like it was more than just pecans. I also loved the contrasting textures of the entire pie: my bottom layer was sticky, dense curd; the middle layer was creamy ice cream, and the top, of course, poofy meringue. I don't think I would make it in the exact same way again. Now that I've learned to make meringue, I'm going to try a baked alaska next. ***also, i don't have a blowtorch so I did some old-fashioned broiling. turned out fine after I returned the pie to the freezer, but my initial slice was a bit wet and drippy

Fantastic! I brought this to a dinner party and it was the hit of the night. I follwed the recipe exactly, except I made my own homemade ice cream that I steeped with Kaffir Lime leaves to add an extra flavor element. Next time, I will back off on the sugar in the lemon curd just a little bit, but overall the dessert was amazing and the flavors combined beautifully. I highly recommend making this dish when you want to impress.

Delicious! I spread this out over several days. Make the curd, two days later make the pie except for the meringue which I make the next day and put back in the freezer until the following day when I intend to use the pie. I also use the 9" springform pan. As per other suggestions, I decrease the sugar to 3/4 cup, increase the lemon peel to 4 tsp and use 5 egg whites. The leftover pie goes back in the freezer and is just as good the next day and the day after that!! This is an all time favorite and gets lots of raves!

Everyone thoroughly enjoyed this pie! I thought the ice cream was a nice addition to a lemon merinque pie...cooled it off. I did find the custard took much longer to make then the recipe indicated...and I felt it ended up a bit too thickened, so I will not cook it as long next time...particularly since it gets frozen. Otherwise, not at all difficult to make and it looks fabulous!

I was disappointed in this recipe, as I thought that it was way too sweet. I think I would have preferred it without the meringue. I'll admit that I usedTrader Joe's lemon curd instead of following the recipe--but I think that it was all the sugar in the meringue and the crust that ruined it for me. I should note that it was all eaten by my guests, but they didn't rave about it like they did the lasagna I served first. All in all, I think this recipe's just too much trouble to make relative to the taste payoff.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Although it takes the better part of a day to prepare, albeit waiting for it to freeze, the results were well worth it. One guest remarked five times, "This is good," during the time he ate his piece. It's a winner, especially for those who love lemon and ice cream.

I have made this recipe several times and every time it has been terrific. Always have to give out the recipe for guests to take home. The lemon curd made according to their directions does take a lot longer (20 minutes) than what the recipe quotes. I always make mine in a spring form pan as I find it makes a better presentation. Other than that, I make it according to the directions.

This pie was good, but I prefer the Lemon Meringue recipe from Gourmet in 1999. The lemon curd and the crust from this recipe are terrific, I just didn't care for frozen lemon pie. I followed the suggestions made by another reviewer and shortened the freezing time by making two layers instead of three, and then broiling the meringue. It worked great, but nobody raved, including myself, about this pie like they rave about the standard lemon meringue pie fromm this site.

Great recipe and yes, I made it in a springform pan so the crust did not shrink. Just placed the crust in the bottom of a spingform then used a knife to loosen the edge of the entire dessert before serving. Made a great, layered presentation that way. Very good, easy, make ahead dessert. Suggestion, if you torch the meringue, let the entire dessert sit for a few minutes before cutting to soften the layers just a bit. Helps blend the flavors better.

Rating: 4
Very good. I made it with key lime w/kaffir lime leaves (Simply Ming's) . It was a bit too tart. I think it would have been better with the lemon curd. I used 6 egg whites in the meringue and ended up not using it all. Next time just the four. I was worried about the frozen Pyrex pie plate breaking in the very hot oven so I placed the pie pan on double (nested) roll pans and it was just fine.

Loved the pie! However, I my regular curd recipe which used only 3/4 cup sugar and it was plenty sweet. In cooking the curd, I never use the simmering water method - just use a very heavy-bottomed pan (Le Crueset works well) and keep stirring. It should only take a few minutes. To be sure of the smoothest curd you can quickly pour it through a sieve after cooking (add the zest after sieving). The crust was awesome but I had some sticking as well as a thick area where the sides slumped when baked. The thick area was difficult to cut through. I tried reshaping it while it was still hot, but obviously not enough in that area. Next time :-).

Made this for a family cookout. Doubled the recipe and made it in a 9 x 13 glass pan. Froze the crust for a few minutes before putting it in the oven--it didn't slip at all.

This is a truly fabulous recipe! I had it last week at a friends house and just now finished making one for a dinner party tomorrow night. Just some tips: It also took me about 20 minutes to get the curd thickened, and it only reached about 165- and that was over a very aggressive simmer. Thickened very nicely in fridge. I also modified the layers to save on freeze time- I did one layer of ice cream, lemon curd and then the meringue. That way, as long as your crust is cool, you could do the ice cream and lemon curd at one time, pop it into the freezer while you make the meringue, and then top with meringue and freeze. I also plan to broil the meringue, not use a 500 degree oven, that way the heat will all be on top, as opposed to the whole oven being hot. Also, if you are nervous about freezing the meringue, if you have a stand mixer, it only takes about 5 minutes to make, so you could easily make it right before serving. Yummy!

Everyone raved about this dessert! I will definitely make it again as both rich-dessert lovers and those who prefer less rich desserts loved it. I made a few changes to the recipe as follows: I used 3/4 Cup sugar rather than 1 C. in the lemon curd; I used 4 Tablespoons Meyer lemon juice and 2 Tablespoons regular lemon juice (both fresh); and I upped the amount of lemon zest to 4 teaspoons to increase the tartness of the curd. In addition, I added some lemon zest to the vanilla ice cream and I also increased the egg whites for the meringue from 4 large eggs to 6 eggs. As suggested by many others, I sprayed the bottom and sides of the pie dish with Pam and had no trouble at all removing the pie.

Wowsa...this dessert has made me extremely popular! I am an avid baker and have baked many different desserts, but this one was by far the most well received ever. It does take a little forethought to make. It's not a lot of active cooking time, but a lot of freezing time in between steps. So make sure to read the recipe through well before you plan to make it so you can have a game plan. The good thing is you can make everything in advance, meringue and all, and keep it in the freezer until serving time. Torch the meringue with a kitchen torch or broiler and you're done. This pie will disappear in no time! Awesome recipe. I'm so glad I tried it!!

I have made this for parties 5 times already,everyone loves this pie! Living in southern California I am able to pick lemons from the yard for this fabulous treat. I will try Trader Joe's lemon curd when my tree quits producing. I did find that while preparing the lemon curd the water level of simmering water should be equal to the level the curd in the bowl is in while thickening. It will thicken faster! When the simmering water level was shallow the curd took longer to thicken. Hope this helps.

i made this for a cookout, pretty much exactly as the recipe called for. i wasnt able to get the temp of the lemon curd up to the recommended number, but it still turned out great. rave reviews from everybody there. really very easy, it is nice that you can kind of put it together over the course of a couple of days.

This is wonderful and perfect to make ahead. The second time I made it in a real rush and had no pecans so I used a premade graham cracker- a sin I know, but it was still wonderful. I also tried the curd in the microwave. I did it at 30 second intervals,stirring often until it hit the desired temperature. It only took about 2 minutes.

Most excellent. Easy, because I used Trader Joe's wonderful lemon curd - 2 jars - my only misstep was not having enough freezer time (2 hrs.) between layers of ice cream, so it didn't set up as pretty as pictured, but tasted out of this world. Next time I'll try making the lemon curd and see if homemade is better than TJs

Seriously our new favorite dessert - we are already talking about when we can make it again. I didn't have quite enough pecans so I added about 1/3 of the amount of ground graham crackers (good quality ones without corn syrup but still sweet). OMG - no one has stopped talking about it. The meringue even held up in the freezer for the next couple of days - it was amazing! (and the only reason it lasted was b/c we made it for ourselves - no company included)!

This pie is amazing. I used a pre-made lemon curd from England to keep it simple. I also made a larger batch of crust (seems like there is never enough) but it was not necessary. Next time I will add a bit of lemon zest to the ice cream or use a vanilla ice cream/lemon sorbet mixture, as I wanted a bit more lemon!

ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. Made for a dinner party and people went back for seconds-- got rave reviews all the way around. Time consuming because of the freezer time, but otherwise very easy. Definitely make ahead. Don't worry about the 500 degree oven-- the ice cream stays frozen as long as you serve immediately out of the oven. Trust me, you want to try this one!!! P.S.--Still just as good the day after (so yes, you can freeze the meringue!)

I've made lemon curd for years and never felt the need to take its temperature. So when it cooked to the thick-and-glisteny stage (which I regard as done), I put in the instant thermometer and read 160, far short of the 178-180 decreed by the recipe. So I cooked it another 5 minutes, and the temp went up hardly at all. I feared for overcooking the eggs, and I stopped at that point. The curd was just fine when I spread it on -- not overly sticky as some reported. So I question the 178-180 degrees stated in the recipe. I took the pie (already meringued) out of the freezer 20 minutes before finishing it in the 500 degree oven. That was probably a mistake, because the ice cream was nearly melted. That probably wouldn't happen if you use the torch method to brown the meringue. But very good nonetheless!

We loved this recipe. I made it exactly as outlined in the recipe. I think the crust was the best part of the pie and will use it over and over again for different pies.

I made this for Easter--the family (including three kids ages 8 - 11) all loved it. The lemon curd is delicious! The only less than positive thing was that the crust got really dark (i.e. burned) in 12 minutes. However, I went ahead and used it and didn't notice that it detracted from the final product. (Since no one else mentioned this, maybe I made a mistake on the oven temperature or something.) You should definitely try this--you'll feel so proud of yourself!

Made it in stages, transported it a few miles frozen with the lemon curd on top. Put the ice cream on, and froze during dinner, and added the meringue just before serving. A perfect dessert - beautiful to look at and just light enough and tart enough to follow an Easter feast of roasted leg of lamb.

This dessert does have it all! I do recommend starting with curd and crust a mininimum of 2 days before your planning on serving it. Also, the recipe instructs you to use a kitchen butane tourch in order to brown meringue. If like me, you don't have a kitchen butane tourch, use another source of flame to brown the meringue. I couldn't bring myself to put an ice cream pie in a 500 degree oven! You and your guests will love this dessert!

Easter 2007; my mother got our family a subscription to bon apetit and loved lemon meringue pie-so in honor of her, I thought Id tackle this pie. As my sister-in-law said: if you make it in stages, it isnt so difficult. But, if you are on a time deadline-its murder. I used local SF Bay area dairy-Strauss vanilla bean ice cream--- so f**  in good!! Meyers lemon from Rainbow Market for the curd and organic pecans. All in all, its a real treat. It is exceptionally richand I was reading a NYT article on heart attacks while I was making it  if you are a heart attack candidatemove on. But, for a once in a while, special treat, this is a great pie. Go easy on the sugarif I make it again, Ill cut back on the amount of sugar recommended. I like things a bit more tart.

I'm going to try this again, but it came out a little too sweet. I think the easiest way to cut out the sweetness is in the ice cream. I used Breyers Vanilla, next time I'm going to try Edy's Dreamery since I looked around and a lot of websites think Breyers is too sweet but rate Dreamery highly. Any other suggestions on the ice cream to use?

This pie is delicious! I used Pam on the bottom of the pie pan and didn't have any trouble getting it out of the pan. The curd will take at least 15 minutes to cook (not the 8 listed ine the recipe.) I made the curd two days ahead and the meringue the night before. A few quick minutes in the oven and the pie was ready to serve for Easter dinner.

This was absolutely delicious. This was the dessert that went first at our Easter dinner. I would certainly make this again. I loved the crust and addition of the vanilla ice cream.

This was outstanding and so easy to make it almost felt shameful! I just made this for an Easter dessert and people who don't normally like lemong meringue pie loved this. In addition every one at dinner was amazed with how good this tasted and how light it was. It is the perfect spring/summer dessert. I sadly did not read the reviews before I made it and we did have some trouble with the crust sticking. Next time I will use PAM.

I also made this pie for Easter dinner. It received raves reviews by all at the table from age 7 to 89! I made the lemon curd five days in advance and completed the whole pie including the meringue two days ahead of time. I used a butane torch immediately prior to serving the pie--skipped the oven entirely. This recipe is a sure "keeper"! The flavors were outstanding together. I am going to try the crust with other fillings as well as the pecan flavors added immensely to the pie.

This pie was the star of our Easter dinner. Raves from all---and no one asked for "just a tiny piece". I was a bit concerned upon reading the recipe about possible pitfalls--ie the curd and the crust--but I followed the instructions exactly as written and the pies were perfect. In all, not a very difficult recipe. Used St. Louis' famous Ted Drewes frozen custard for the filling-- heavenly.

Delicious! Thought ithe piec looked beautiful based on the cover photo, but was skeptical...lemons and ice cream??? It was fabulous. Served it for Easter and was a big hit. Made it exactly as written....with homemade vanilla icre cream.

AWESOME. I am usually a person who thinks dessert must be chocolate to be good but this was great. And easy too. Made the curd one day and the rest of the pie including meringue the next. Froze overnight. It was perfect and beautiful. Only two small complaints- the curd takes much longer than 8 minutes and it is hard to get out of the pie plate. But it is sooooo good who cares.

This is a keeper! I made most of the pie one day, added the meringue the next morning & then froze it alll for about 7 hours before torching the meringue & serving. It was terrific! & yes, I think you can consider lemon curd slighty "sticky."

Oh my, this pie was just delicious. In a vain attempt to cut the calories a bit, I used Hagen Dazs frozen yogurt instead of ice cream. The lemon curd takes a lot of whisking, and the meringue a lot of whipping but it is all worth it! And any excuse to use the kitchen torch is always fun. We all loved it and I would make it again in a hearbeat.

Like the cook from Wisonson I was wondering about freezing the pie with the meringue as well. Does anyone have any suggestions? Also I am half way threw making this pie and made the lemon curd last night, when I took it out to spread it it was very sticky. I thought lemon curd consistancy was like custard???? I have never made it before, can anyone advise.

This pie was delicious! The curd recipe is really yummy with Meyer lemons. Goes perfectly with the pecans! It was hard to get out but still worth the trouble!

To alleviate the crust sticking to the pie plate use a parchment round in the bottom of the dish. Spray dish with Pam first then place parchment. Great recipe and thanks to Jamie's for sharing!!

I want to use this recipe, but can it be correct to freeze it AFTER you put on the meringue? I thought that you could not freeze meringue...? Thanks for any help that you can give me...

I have made this twice and both times the crust stuck to the pie plate--will try Pam next time. This is a wonderfully different take on lemon meringue pie--delicious and so lemony. Perfect for an impressive dessert for guest (especially if it doesn't stick to the plate!)

This was the first time that I made lemon curd but it took a lot longer than the recipe suggested. Next time I will make the pie and I will definately make it again, I will buy the lemon curd. Everybody loved the pie.

Made this as soon as the April issue came out and it was excellent. In fact I'm making it again this weekend for Easter because I think it would work for my friends observing Passover. The combination of the lemon curd, toasted pecans and ice cream was heavenly. Oh, I did spray the pan with PAM and didn't have any trouble getting the pieces out.

We had a very hard time getting the frozen pie out of the pie pan. Any ideas? It's got so much butter in it I can't imagine greasing the pan would help. Loved the ice cream and curd combo. The nice nutty toasty pecans are a good contrast flavor.
