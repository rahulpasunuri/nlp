I really liked this. I think maybe there is too much bread crumbs, but I may just be whining about the carbohydrate load. Flavorful, absolutely!

Yuchy! Have a dish of dry bread crumbs on bitter cabbage like tasting turnips. Why? I can finally elimiante 1 vegetable from my repertoire.

I was astonished by how tasty this was. It is a very simple dish which highlights the subtle sweetness of turnips. I've made it twice, once mostly following the recipe and once with some additions. The second time, I used a vegetable broth in place of the water. I also added collard greens in the second half when the dish was simmering. The breadcrumbs are a must. Do not skimp on the garlic or quality of your olive oil.

This was really good...even my kids ate some, and they normally wouldn't touch turnips. I'm going to try cumin seeds next time as suggested by a few reviewers...they were great as-is but could use another herb.

Great side dish! It compliments just about anything since the flavor is so mild. My family loved it!

I am not a big fan of turnips, but cooked this way they taste delicious! Half way through I was sceptical, but once all of the liquid cooked away and the turnips carmelized a bit, they tasted great. Not bitter at all, with a good texture. I used Japanese turnips (although the recipe says not to).

our second time making this recipe. we have made it as a side dish both times, but decided this evening it was the star of the meal and could stand on its own as a small-plate type appetizer. wow! great turnips!

Tasty turnips....who knew? It is amazing what bread crumbs and garlic can do! I made the recipe as is except I substituted olive oil for the butter.

Exceptional way to prepare turnips.

MmmMMmmm! I loved this recipe, though I hardly followed it. I cut the butter with bacon grease (heh heh heh) and for the coating I went half and half with Brazil nuts (what?! I had them on hand!) though I suppose walnuts could also work. I also didn't have poppy seeds or parsley, but I did have a few fennel seeds and a bit of savory and it came out wonderful! My only advice is to really roast the bread crumbs and mix it all up beforehand so it doesn't look so much like an apple crumble.

Made this for the third time. Really good, the turnips are very mild like this. I used a bit of cumin too.

Second time I made this, didn´t have poppy seeds; used cumin seeds, 1 tsp. Delicious again.

I enjoyed this recipe as written and will be making it again this holiday season

I followed the recipe pretty closely, I just left out the parsley. It was great. I'll be making it again this week with some turnips we got in our CSA bag. The breadcrumb topping really makes the dish. I used the topping on a cabbage gratinee I made & it worked just as well on that

I sliced the turnips with a mandoline and added a couple of carrots. Sauteed them for a few minutes, then added the other ingredients and covered for about 10 more minutes. Then I transfered everything to a dish and baked at 350, like the "turnip gratin". I sprinkled the poppyseed mixture on top and baked a few more minutes. Delicious!

Loved the coating, yummy! Altho it became less interesting the next day. Our turnips (perhaps too old?) were a bit too crunchy still, so if I make it again I will have to cook them longer.

I really enjoyed this dish! So easy to make and very fresh flavor. I made mine with young organic turnips, so the flavor really came out.

This was delicious, with a complex flavor and texture unlike any turnip dish I've ever had. Didn't change anything. Served it as a side dish for a North African style meal. My husband, who doesn't care for turnips, loved it.
