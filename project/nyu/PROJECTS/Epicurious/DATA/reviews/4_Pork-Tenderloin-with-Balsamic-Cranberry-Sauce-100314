Wow! Just looking for something easy to do with a pork tenderloin in the freezer. I happened to have all the ingredients on hand, which never happens, so I prepared it exactly as written. What a delicious, easy, lovely recipe! My husband, not wild about p.t., fought me for the last slice. This one definitely stays in the rotation.

This is a recipe that I make over and over again--it's elegant, and the contrasting flavors of the sauce and pork tenderloin is wonderful. It's also a very quick recipe, and allows for variations, depending on what you have on hand--I've substituted zinfandel for the vinegar, and omitted the onions--a wonderful fall and winter dinner.

This is excellent. I make it once a week for the family. Whenever a recipe calls for butter and it is to be cooked at high heat I use ghee or clarified butter which does not have the same health concerns as butter at high temps. My changes are only to simplify the process. Cook the pork as directed. Remove from pan when done. Cook onion and rosemary on the stove top in the pork roasting pan. The onion releases enough moisture to de-glaze pan. When softened, add the cranberry sauce and the vinegar. Cut the pork and plate. Pour the released juices into the sauce, season with salt and pepper, spoon over pork and serve.

As others, I doubled the sauce, and agree that the pork takes much longer to reach 155 degrees, and more time to thicken the sauce. However, the sauce was WONDERFUL and received rave reviews from my much more accomplished cook/other half. I followed the recipe as published.

Rating: 3
Delicious, and an easy way to spiff up a weeknight meal. It took more like 20 mins in the oven for the pork to reach 155, and the sauce took a whole lot longer than 6 minutes to thicken. However... both the pork and the sauce were done at the same time, so no real complaints here! I'll make it again.

Since the butter/stent combination is not considered a good one, I substituted olive oil. With that substitution it becomes quite a healthy dish, I believe. And it was still delicious!

Great recipe. I used apricot jam, half onion, half shallots, and threw in a slice of fresh ginger. Definitely double the recipe for average size tenderloin. We've never had any leftovers with this recipe.

This one got lost in the old accordion recipe file. First tried it in 2003. Made it the other night subbing raspberry jam for the cranberry sauce and making the sauce earlier in the day. I also sub shallots for the onions.

My 8 year old says: Too good!I hope my mom makes it again! I also think it deserves a blue ribbon.I would give it 9 or 10 forks if I could! I say: Quick and easy to make,great results. Didn't have cranberry so used black cherry jam which was fantastic with the rosemary.Great meal to make a week-night special.

Rating: 4
This was excellent and easy to make. Made two tenderloins. I used shallots as recommended. I gave the sauce a swirl in the Cuisinart as the shallots where a bit too big. I double the sauce recipe and next time will triple so when I reheat pork for leftovers I warm sauce first and put in pork slices for a quick heat up. Recommended you undercook one tenderloin a bit so when you reheat it is still good. Recipe is a keeper and know my husband will be asking me to make it again.

Served this last night, along with roasted winter vegetables and a savory tomato soup for a festive New Year's Day dinner. I used a full pork tenderloin (about 1.25 lbs.) and made 2X the sauce. I substituted shallots for the onions, and about 1 1/2 cups of fresh cranberries for the jellied cranberry sauce, then reduced the sauce by a 1/3 before finishing it in the roasting pan while the tenderloin was resting. It came out great and everybody had seconds (and thirds).

Very tasty, and very easy to do. I served with Trader Joe's cornbread (very sweet and moist!) and french cut green beans. To keep with the theme I also served Trader Joe's rosemary raisin crackers topped with cranberry goat cheese. I paired with a pinot noir. I just wish this recipe were made for an average size pork tenderloin ( approx 1- 1.25 lb) I doubled the sauce, like others have mentioned. I also might use cherries next time. It was loved by all, and I will make again!

Delicious and easy! I doubled the recipe, but after reading the reviews, only used 1/2 c finely chopped sweet onions, but I think shallots would be even better. I added 1 c fresh whole cranberries and simmered the sauce until they burst. The sauce thickened nicely after 10 minutes. I cut two pork tenderloins in half and they took around 15 minutes to cook in the oven. Overall, very easy, but festive!

Rating: 4
Delicious! I doubled the amount of sauce and made that first so it would have plenty of time to reduce. I used shallots. I think a handful of fresh cranberries would be very tasty too. I served with pureed garlic cauliflower and an arugula, orange, blue cheese salad with a vinagerette dressing. Will definitely make again.

We love this pork! It's delicious, very simple & quick to put together. I usually double the sauce because it's so wonderful. I've made it with onions and with shallots, great either way. Goes nicely with mashed sweet potatoes and a nice green veggie. Our family's favorite pork recipe.

During the years when my family traveled to my inlaws for Xmas day and dinner, this dish was my favorite holiday meal on Xmas Eve after church with my family at home. The sauce makes it seem like such an elegant dish and the entire meal comes together very quickly.

My family thought this was okay but not great. The sauce was delicious but when I make it again, I will double it. Also the browning took much longer than stated--next time I would continue searing until totally brown almost blackened to achieve a wonderful outer crust. The cooking time also was longer than the recipe suggested for my meat--about 25 mins to reach 155. I think it would be excellent grilled.

I made this as an app for my son's birthday party (I'm turning him into a foodie early) and sliced it thin. It went over beautifully and out of the two tenderloins I used, there are only a few slices left!! I did use cherry preserves instead of cranberry sauce and it was just tart enough.

Rating: 3
The only reason I gave this recipe three forks was the amount of onion. It needs (as previous reviewers have suggested) about half the amount. I processed my onions until they were almost a puree - which meant that I didn't have to strain the resulting product. I also increased the amount of balsamic vinegar by about one half.

Since I first reviewed this recipe, I've made it at least 50 times, for every occasion and in every quantity (up to dinner for 26). The sauce is beyond delicious, and if you concoct your own stock (as I do), the flavors are so deep and sensuous that everyone savoring this dish gasps in awe. I always make the sauce ahead of time so that it is reheating as the pork cooks. Truly yummy,

You will be surprised by how delicious this sauce is... It's actually even entertaining-worthy, especially becuase it is so simple and inexpensive!

Wow, that sauce is mouth watering tasty. I decided to try this last minute as I had the tenderloin but no inspiration. I didn't have fresh onion so I used onion powder. It tasted fantastic. I also threw in a quarter cup of dry white wine into the pan after searing off the tenderloin and threw it in the oven. Be sure you cover the tenderloin with foil and let it rest a good 10 minutes after removing it from the oven. This was super easy and really delicious. I will make this again for sure.

Made this today. Tripled the recipe (except for the butter) and added more cranberry for a total of 2 cans. After 10 min, pork was at 160, so took out, rested for about 10 minutes. Was a huge hit and am looking forward to leftovers! Oh, also, I sauteed the onions in one pan, but when I took the pork out of the other pan, put the onions and the rest of the ingredients into the pan with the pork drippings.

I made this as sandwiches for a holiday party. I increased the amount of cranberry and balsamic and also added a little cayenne pepper, I let it thicken into a bit of a spread. Served on challah and whole wheat rolls. It tasted like a bite of Thanksgiving, bit hit with the party goers and easy to eat in a party setting.

I've been making this recipe for 10 years and its a hit each and every time. We now call it simply "plate licking sauce". We've had so many friends and family over the years ask if they can lick their plate afterwards since its that good. When we do it for dinner parties we make an herb crusted pork loin and serve the sauce on the side. I've made the sauce by itself for Thanksgiving too. (Try it on a turkey sandwich with cream cheese!) It is so simple yet delicious. I always use the whole can of cranberry sauce and double the rest of the ingredients since how its written is just not enough.

This dish was delicious, easy to make and low in fat. I substituted olive oil for the butter and otherwise followed the recipe except for the addition of a splash of port as the sauce thickened.

Excellent, and quite easy to make. It's on the roster for me and a 12 year old who adores pork. Served with mashed potatoes and spinach! I also needed extra roast time, but I simply ate the ends and saved the middle for leftovers, doing a quick saute to finish off the cooking.

This recipe is exceptional, with 5-star results with very little effort - and I'm not a very accomplished cook. I used the recipe with slight variation. I used a whole can of cranberry sauce, and doubled everything else except the balsamic. It definitely takes longer to cook both the loin and to reduce the sauce. Allow more like 20-25 minutes. Served over rice, every plate was wiped clean.

Rating: 4
Excellent sauce but lackluster pork without it. Took the advice of other reviewers and strained the sauce - next time, I will add fresh cranberries back to the strained sauce and heat until they "pop". Increased and decreased measurements as follows: one cup of cranberry sauce, 1 1/2 cup broth, 1/2 cup shallots, 2 Tbl rosemary, and 3 Tbl of a high quality balsamic - increased cooking time for both pork and sauce. Company worthy!

Rating: 4
I would recommend only 2 changes: First, only add 1/2 the amount of balsamic vinegar -- it's really mellow but still carries a little balsamic "bite". Second, strain out the solids (rosemary and onion) before serving. Otherwise, delish!

Finally. A pork recipe that not only tastes good, but looks wonderful on a plain white plate.

I wanted to make this but I didn't have the cranberries. I did have pomegranite juice so I subbed that. I added a slurry to thicken. Worked out really well, my whole family enjoyed it. Meat was at room temp. when I started and was in the oven for 15 mins. Came out perfectly but it must depend on the wt. of the pork.

Had to reduce sauce a few minutes longer, but tasted rich and wonderful. Will make again soon!

Delicious sauce! I made it with extra fresh cranberries from Thanksgiving that I froze. I baked them at 325 with a cup of sugar sprinkled on them for about and hour and a half, and used them in the recipe. Sadly, I used a pork SIRloin and not TENDERloin and I didn't like the texture - all my fault. I will use the tenderloin next time.

The original copy of this recipe clipping in my file is tattered, with a few balsamic stains from years of cooking and love. I've tweaked the dish over time to match our tastes. Who doesn't? That's why cooking is art, not merely science. Meat lovers need to increase the portion of tenderloin, even when serving this dish with rice and other sides. A bit less onion, a bit more balsamic, sometimes a touch of herbs de Provence instead of rosemary. Divine!

This is the perfect cool weather pork tenderloin dish! The flavors are wonderful and it's so easy to prepare. I made it as is but did as another reviewer reccommended and deglazed the skillet used to roast the pork in order to make the sauce instead of using a separate pan. I used the whole can of cranberry sauce and increased the broth and balsamic. I served it with homemade polenta (which is great with some of the sauce spooned over it) and steamed asparagus. YUMMY!

I have made this a gazillion times--for 2, 4, 6, 8, 12--you name it. Never fails. Make the sauce beforehand and you only spend about 15 minutes away from your guests. When you walk through the door carrying plates laden with all that aroma, they swoon. Then they eat and ask when's the next time they can come over!

Very, very nice-- my husband raved. The only change I made was to prepare the sauce in the pan that the pork was roasted in, after removing it from the oven I added the butter and went ahead as the recipe as stated, basically deglazing the pan with the broth. I may have added a bit more balsamic, too. I served it with roasted root vegetables and a green salad.

great sunday dinner for picky eaters. Comes together fast --I've made it a few times w/only one change: the tenderloin needs much more than 10 minutes in the oven, more like 20. (maybe the ones I've made were much bigger than 10 ounces). I used probably 2 tablespoons of balsamic and kids really loved that.

This recipe has a big flavor payoff - especially considering how easy it is to prepare!! I recommend using a sweet onion instead of yellow or white. Also, take care to select a premium cranberry sauce; I use organic cranberry preserves made with cranberry fructose instead of processed sugar - it adds considerable flavor and makes the dish a bit healthier.

I did not rate this recipe because I strayed waaaay away from the original recipe. I used thick pork loin chops, browned them in butter, finished them in the oven as stated. For the sauce, I added garlic, black pepper, salt and doubled the recipe (for 4 chops). I added more balsamic than called for in an attempt to cut the sweet. I would *love* this recipe if there was a little "heat" to the sauce. The balsamic kept it from being overtly sweet, but in my opinion, it would have been a homerun if it had a little "heat". I will try this again adding chipotle or jalapeno and report back.

I made this for a NYE dinner party. The tenderloin cooked perfectly. The sauce I cooked down quite a bit - it had a ton of flavor.

I have probably made this 50 times and it is always a hit. I usually quadruple the sauce and cook it way down so it is thick and yummy. I also put the meat on the grill rather than in the oven. It just tastes better that way. Any sauce left over? Freeze it in an ice cube tray for later use. It's great on chicken and turkey too!

I made this for the first time and it turned out good. I used a 2 pound tenderloin which took a lot longer to cook (cooked at 475 20-30 minutes). I seared it a little longer on each side, too. It came out moist and tender. The sauce is very tasty (I doubled it)instead of canned cranberry sauce I used Trader Joe's Organic Orange Cranbbey sauce in a jar. It was easy to prepare but I forgot that a bigger tenderloin was going to take longer to cook so next time I will have to start a little earlier.

I make it through out the winter for weekday meals. One year I served it for a fancy Christmas Eve party and everyone loved it. I highly recommend this dish. I have found a short cut to eliminate the oven; cut the porkloin into medalions and saute on both sides. Keep them warm and add them back into the sauce when it is ready. Have fun and enjoy!

I made this for my sister's birthday. My picky family loved it. The pork was very tender and the sauce was a perfect blend. Because of time restraints I did make the sauce ahead of time and left it on low for awhile. I made too much sauce so used the extra the next day on roasted chicken. Not as good as the pork but still very good. My whole family actually agreed that the sauce was better the next day. Next time I may make the sauce the day before and reheat it before serving.

Fantastic! I seared it 2 minutes on each side and cooked it in the oven for 20. I started the reduction right after putting the tenderloin in the oven and it thickened nicely by the time the meat was ready. My fiance was floored by this recipe. I'll definitely make it again.

I made this last week for friends and again last night for other friends, all to rave reviews. It is an excellent dinner and the sauce is fantastic.

I really liked the flavor of the sauce in this recipe. It has a lot of depth and it isn't too sweet. My only problem with it was that I wasn't crazy about the consistency of the sauce with all the onion. Next time I'll either cut down the amount of onion or strain the sauce at the end. Also, the color of the sauce was a little dull and didn't look the most appetizing. As others have said, the pork needs to roast longer. Whenever I do pork tenderloin, including for this recipe, I sear for 2 minutes per side and then finish in the oven for 20 minutes at 425. It comes out perfect every time!

Removed pork from skillet and while resting, I cooked shallots and rosemary in drippings left behind and then added broth and cranberry sauce. I couldn't quite bring myself to use Oceanspray canned cranberries so used a bottled cranberry/orange sauce that worked really well. I doubled this recipe as I had two tenderloins but didn't double the amount of fresh rosemary. I love rosemary but I think 2 tbsp would have been too much for my taste.

This is really good, and so easy. I seared the tenderloin for about 2 minutes per side, instead of 2 minutes, then put it in a baking dish to finish in the oven - 425 for about 15 minutes to reach 150 degrees (my tenderloin was about one pound). That let me use the browning pan to make the sauce. I'll definitely do this recipe again.

FABULOUS and EASY! This recipe knocks 'em out every time and it's really simple. I have added one change 'tho. After the pork comes out of the oven - I transfer it to a cutting board and deglaze the pan with the prepared balsamic/cranberry sauce - It deepens the flavor - YUMMY! Enoy.

Delicious, I added sliced mushrooms to the sauce and it gave it some texture. Chop the onion slightly coarse and experiment with the sauce. Also, let the sauce cook until it thickens, that is where it will get its flavor and it will adhere to the meat better.

A total and uttter disappointment. No depth of flavor at all. Easy? Yes! Prepare again? NO! Sorry to add my name to the few dissenters amongst the hundreds. Trust me .... discerning palates, stay away.

Simple? Yes? Would I make this again? No! No depth of flavor to the meat, warm chutney-like sauce barely passable, despite the use of organic cranberries, delightfully aged balsamic and fresh rosemary from the garden. Glad it did not take long, because I would have resented the effort had it been a time-consuming dish with all the accolades it has received on this site. Sorry to add my voice of dissent to the few others who were equally disappointed.

Rating: 1
To continue from my last note. The meat had no depth of flavor whatsoever (I am not sure what I was expecting, as it is just seasoned, seared and then roasted) and could not stand on its own. The flavor of the sauce, despite organic cranberries, fabulous aged balsamic and wonderful rosemary from the garden, was OK, but nothing I would want to repeat.

Quick and very tasty. We actually followed the recipe with only a slightly longer searing of the pork tenderloins to give a deep brown. We found the sauce delicious when used in moderation and would probably be enough for 2 tenderloins and to serve 4. A definite repeat for us.

Rating: 2
2 1/2 Forks. This was good but too sweet for my taste. My only deviation was to use white wine rather than chicken broth, and my balsamic is very high quality (a gift). I'm wondering if a lesser vinegar and the chicken broth called for would cut some of the sweetness? Next time I will try a mustard coating on the tenderloin and more rosemary. My son made no complaints and ate seconds, - the ingredients and preparation are simple so all in all it's a keeper.

I think I reduced the sauce a little too much. The end result was a sauce that was much too sweet. I will probably try this again, but using a homemade cranberry relish next time. My guests liked it more than I did.

Rating: 3
We've made this 3 times with very delicious results. Our only change is in the finishing of the sauce. After transferring the pork to a cutting board after its time in the oven, we instead pour the cranberry mixture into the skillet that the pork cooked in. This lets you use all the juices/scrapings resulting from searing the pork, and has the added bonus of pre-cleaning the pan by boiling off the stuck on, yummy brown bits.

This recipe is great! I can't count the times I've made this. Didn't change any ingredients. The only thing I changed is after the pork rested for 5 minutes, I sliced it on a diagonal 3/4" thick and added the slices to the sauce and boiled for a few minutes to thicken the sauce.

The best part of this recipe is how easy it is. I was able to whip this together along with a lemon ride on the side in less than an hour total. Made to the recipe - next time will try white wine to deglaze the pan as in previous reviews.

Rating: 4
Grrrreat, Deeeeelicious but most of all FAST! The only thing that I would change is adding 1 Tbsp of olive oil when searing the tenderloin because when you do it with butter only, the butter burns on "medium-high heat" as they directed. No need to place it in the oven because I added the sauce to the pan where I seared the meat and so it finished cooking in the sauce. I will definately make this as a routine dish.

Rating: 3
We really enjoyed this dish, although we also made some changes as many appear to have done. First, I used homemade cranberry sauce which I had leftover from Thanksgiving. I also used shallots instead of onions. I think next time I would also add in some garlic - it seemed to need it. As for the chicken broth - I reduced it slightly and added some white wine instead. I believe this gave better depth of flavor as well. Additionally I decided to deglaze the cooking pan with the sauce ingredients instead of doing it in a separate clean pan. What is the point of wasting the fond that has developed in that pan? This was relatively easy to prepare. My husband really enjoyed it and it will be added to my rotation for sure.

After reading other reviews I started the cranberry sauce before the pork to give it plenty of time. It worked out well that way. I doubled the recipe and it tasted fabulous with no leftovers. I seared the pork in a cast iron skillet and when I put the pan in the oven it smoked badly and those wonderful pan drippings were burned and unable to be used. Other than that this was a very easy recipe with GREAT flavor. Can't wait to try it on chicken thighs. Definately double that wonderful sauce.

I loved it. Forgot to add the balsamic vinegar, and it was still terrific. Loved that dark cranberry taste. My guests were an hour late due to weather, and the pork still came out really delicious

Made this with dried rosemary (one third of the amount specified) and it had WAY too much rosemary for me. I guess next time I will use fresh. One compliment: one diner said he would not have eaten the sauce if he'd known cranberry was in it -- then had more, with sauce.

Rating: 3
I was searching for a sauce to spice up a basic broiled chicken breast. I ran across this recipe, and per earlier reviewers used shallots in place of onions. It was a great sauce, I'd now like to try it with the pork. Definitely a keeper and nice for an autumn dish (with the cranberries).

Rating: 4
Delicious. I made this recently and it was perfect. The pork took a bit longer to cook than the recipe said. I also deglazed the pork pan with white wine before adding the sauce, and it was scrumptious. Served with roasted acorn squash and sauteed swiss chard with olive oil and garlic. Great Autumn meal.

I made this again tonight, but used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. This receipe is delicious and simple to prepare.

Amazingly good.

This is the first time epicurious has ever let me down. I followed the recipe exactly except I subbed shallots as so many reviewers suggested. It was just ok. Absolutely nothing special. For a much better (and easier) dish, buy Costco's Chipotle Rasperry Sauce and pour over the pork tenderloin. It will provide all the "pizazz" missing in this recipe.

This a super dish...quick, easy and flavourful. Have made it a few times with pork but tried it last night with chicken thighs and think it was even better. Quickly browned the chicken then set aside and made the sauce in the same pan. I used red onions, homemade cranberry sauce to which I added the fine zest of 1 orange, and splashed in 1/4 cup of Kirsch. Poured the sauce over the thighs and baked at 350 for 45 minutes. A real success...moist, tender and truly delicious! For a change of pace, do give chicken a try!

This was quite good with some of the same revisions as others. Do not need to double the sauce as I so often do. Made sauce in the pan that I cooked the pork in. Deglazed the pan with white wine and chicken broth after cooking the onions and cooked quite a while to reduce. Would leave the rosemary sprigs whole next time and remove before serving. This would be good with chicken or turkey breast as well.

Outstanding recipe. It's now in my collection. I didn't have cranberry sauce, so I substituted a berry medley chutney. The balsamic vinegar helped to cut the sweetness. My husband was particularly pleased when he saw me use rosemary from our garden. It's easy, it's fast and it's delicious.

I was expecting a lot more "pow" of flavor from the balsamic and cranberry. Maybe if I'd do it again, I'd grill the pork and reduce the sauce to a glaze to spoon over it.

I love this dish. Doubled the recipe for the sauce for 1 pork tenderloin and couldn't get enough. Served w/a huge chunk of brie (sauce & brie alone would be good even) and zucchini noodles (low carb option). Also substituted shallots for onions and used 1/2 chicken broth, 1/2 white wine. Took a while to reduce- but patience paid off as the sauce got very thick! This recipe is a toss up between our beloved pork tenderloin w/gorgonzola sauce also on site.

Rating: 4
I thought it was an interesting recipe, tasted good, but my husband raved about it and said to add it to his list of favorites. I'll definitely be making this again. I sliced the tenderloin very thin & smaller pieces so it absorbed more flavor, substituted scallions for onion & used 1/3c. of canned cranberry + an extra dash of salt instead of wholeberry. I served the leftover canned cranberry on the side along with a simple spinach salad & mashed potatoes.

Rating: 4
Really, this was great. Very simple and an excellent pairing with pork - and I had all the ingredients on hand. Do note, however, that it serves two...I had to double quickly for my guests. Also, my 2yr old loved it, which was an added bonus!

My husband kept raving about it as he was eating it, and a couple of nights later asked to have it again! The second time I made it with thick, boneless pork chops and it worked just as well. Instead of regular onions we used scallions from the garden with very good results. We did not like it much as leftovers, it didn't translate well; seemed like the flavor punch was gone.

Rating: 4
I understand why this dish is so popular. Simple, tasty; a big hit with the family. Just adding my "two cents" worth of substition. I don't buy canned cranberries and didn't have time to make my own sauce so used lingonberry sauce instead which added a little more flavour and tartness. Sweet onion, homemade chicken stock and Herbs de Province all reduced in the roasting pan and it was good to go for seconds.

Served with rice pilaf and Trader Joe's balsamic fired vegetables. Very tasty!

My husband - who is an educated man - took one bite and said, "Damn, this is good!" Now, I'm not a bad cook and I don't think he was so much surprised that I prepared a nice dish as he was how a simple dish was to turn out "so damn good." (I am known for my elaborate dishes that use LOTS of pots, pans and utensils. He watched me make this as we had a glass of wine.) I followed the recipe as written with the minor exception of preparing the sauce in the pan that I roasted the meat in. My teenage son, who is one of those "I don't mix meat and fruit types" really liked it as well. I found the sauce to be subtle and complimentary. I used Ocean Spray Whole Berry because I was in a hurry and wasn't going to scout around town. Because of this I thought the sauce might be sweet. It wasn't at all. Also, because I thought it might be sweet I did not add the mushrooms that someone else mentioned. I can see now that it would have been great. I used a 1.25 lbs tenderloin and put it in the oven for about 20 minutes. I did find that it took about 12 minutes to get the sauce to the consistency that I liked. I sliced my tenderloin into serving sizes pieces and put them in the sauce with the heat off so that I could finish my most awesome glass of '98 Cab. Next time I will double the sauce and add mushrooms.

The sauce was absolutely delicious! I found the blend of flavors very complex despite the simplicity of its ingredients. I found the pork to still be very pale after searing for only two minutes-- it needed quite a bit longer. Like one of the other reviewers, I also found the overall cooking time to be too short-- It needed more like 20 minutes, rather than 10, to reach the proper temperature. The sauce tasted even better the second day!

Another easy yet excellent keeper. I also used shallots instead of onions, and added 8 oz. of slice mushrooms. I could eat the 'sauce' as a side dish, it's so good! Also left pork in oven for 16 minutes and only reached 153.5 on instant-read therm. after a few minutes. Was planning on serving with carmelized parsnips and carrots with orange butter, but no parsnips to be found. Settled on previous reviewer's wife's yams with Frangelico/brown sugar/dried apricot topping and the rest of the cranberry sauce on the side. Almost like TG. Also panna cotta with coffee granita for dessert. Just your average Saturday night romantic dinner, and it only took an hour to prep and cook!

This is the second time I made this recipe and it was even better than I remembered! I must admit that I changed the recipe a little, I used shallots insteat of onion but that's all I changed. I had a cooking friend over for dinner and she said this dish is worthy of a dinner party! So next time, guess which entree I will be serving my guests?!

We had to make a few minor substitutions but this recipe was simple to make and really delivered the flavor. This recipe turned out the way you hope it will when you read it.

An all time favorite everyone asks for the recipe anytime I make it for them. I definitely would not brown the pork ahead of time and allow it to sit before baking as noted by the cook from Lexington. This method might allow bacteria to form making it potentially unhealthy to eat. I would only make the sauce ahead of time and keep pork refrigerated until ready to cook completly. Would not want you to have a bad experience with such a great recipe!!!!

This one is a keeper! Served it for friends last evening and got rave reviews. Another plus is the ease of preparation. I made the sauce an hour before the guests arrived--it is easy and delicious. The only substitution I made was to use shallots instead of onions based on another reviewer's comments. I also browned the tenderloins in advance and then placed in the oven after the guests arrived. It took about 20 minutes at 450 to cook them since the pan was not as hot when placing into the oven. I like the pork to be only very slightly pink and this worked well for us. Served this with rice pilaf and asparagus. I will definitely make this again!

Everyone liked the sauce. I used jellied sauce, not whole berry. The sauce turns out dark brown because of the balsamic vinegar, and I don't think having little round balls (the whole cranberries) in the thickish dark brown sauce would have added to its appearance; the jellied sauce was fine. I strained it, mashing hard against the strainer, to get the pieces of onion and rosemary out, so the 'whole berry' concept would have gone by the boards anyway. This recipe is quick and good. It doesn't taste too cranberry-y or balsamic-y, either; the flavors meld well together. Try it.

Very, very nice. I did not have any cranberry sauce, so I used Rasberry Preserves. It was delicious. My husband wants me to make it again for Father's Day. This is a great company dish. I will use this again and again. One option I will utilize in the future is to grill the meat on the BBQ.

This was really delicious! I followed the advice of the other cooks and used just one pan, making the sauce in the same one used to cook the meat. It worked out well. I will definitely use this one for a small dinner party, doubling or even tripling the recipe. It's a keeper.

The cook from Austin offers good advice. Too bad I goofed and had only jellied cranberry sauce in the house. It tasted great but would have looked nicer with the whole berries. There is always next time. Served this with brussels sprouts and roasted sweet potatoes with rosemary and pine nuts. Good combination ,we thought.

Like the Cook from Austin, I also couldn't stand to waste the pan drippings, so I moved the pork to a cutting board, letting it rest, and made the cranberry sauce right in the same pan. It reduced down quickly, so it worked out perfectly. I agree too, that shallots would be better than the onion. Will try that next time. (There will definitely be a next time!) I served this with mashed butternut squash.

The balsamic-cranberry sauce is good, but do not follow the recipe verbatim. Play around with the cranberry sauce and broth to make it the consistency that you like.

My husband and I enjoyed this pork tenderloin. I am always looking for different ways to use this cut of meat as it is great for the two of us. I took the meat out at 145 degrees and let it rest for 10 minutes and it was nicely pink in the middle. I let the sauce reduce for about 20 minutes prior to adding the pan juices, so it was very think and clung to the meat. Served it with baked sweet potatoes and brussel sprouts.

I loved this dish. The pork was delicious and the sauce was very flavourful. I didn't have canned cranberry sauce, so I made my own from frozen cranberries. It turned out great, but my husband thought that the sauce was too thick... not saucy enough. I thought it was great.

Iknow, I know, I'm supposed to rate the recipe "as is", but I accidently tweaked it in the making and it was Awesome and I wanted to tell you all. I keep in my pantry the rub from the bourbon-mustard babyback ribs and sprinkled this on the tenderloins instead of simple salt/pepper. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. My husband who is not a fan of "sweet sauces" with his meat thought this was fabulous - he asked for lots more sauce. I don't know if it's because of the extra seasoning from the rub, or just the right amount of cranberry and balsamic but it was tangy with a hint of sweetness and absolutely perfect.

Wonderful! Will definitely make this one again. I had two tenderloins so I doubled the recipe. It took about 16 minutes in the oven at 450 deg. I used 1/2 cup white wine & 1/2 cup broth and since I only had jellied cranberry sauce I added about 1/4 cup dried cranberries. Very good. Served with roasted potatoes I started first before preparing the meat. Had I known it was this good, I would have cooked 3 tenderloins. Would definitely try with any kind of pork.

I thought this was simple and delicious. To be fair, though, I should mention that my husband seemed to think that it was a bit pedestrian (and I've seen this man rave over mac & cheese). Still, if he weren't coming to dinner, I'd make it confidently for guests. I didn't have fresh rosemary and used dried - I wouldn't do that again since the dried rosemary didn't soften up enough. Overall, a quick, easy recipe with delicious results.

Absolutely decicious and very easy. I tripled the recipe and used a 4lb pork loin instead. Served with haricots vert and wild rice. Highly recommend.

This was an easy but elegant dish. I watched the pork closely to not over cook it. After removing it from the oven when the thermometer was 155 I left it in the pan for about 6 minutes while I reduced the sauce. Great flavor and easy.

Great dish! Delicious, easy & quick! It will become a staple for us.

A great autumn dish, very sweet and delicious. Unlike many recipes I've found on this site, this one actually creates an adequate amount of sauce as-is. I've tried to tinker with the ratio of ingredients, don't do it, too much of the cranberry with make the sauce stick and too much broth will make it thin. I do add more rosemary, but that's a personal preference. As always, don't skip searing the tenderloin.

Rating: 4
We've made this several times with different cuts of pork, but porkloin is the fave. It's a fabulous sauce! Latest rendition is to cook, then strain the sauce & it's much better that way. Strain & then add more whole cranberry sauce so the only chunky part is the cranberry. Oh, and it's pretty, too.

I loved this dish. I did not have cranberry sauce, so I used dried sweet cranberries that I reconstituted in the broth. It was great.

Rating: 3
I had pork chops in the fridge and didn't know what to do with them and came across this recipe. I had cranberry sauce in the freezer from Thanksgiving and also homemade broth from yesterday, so I thought I'd give this a try with the chops. Since I wasn't using a tenderloin I cooked everything in the skillet and it was quick and easy and tasted very nice. I did not use all the butter (just a little olive oil) since I am watching my fat intake and didn't miss it.

What a tasty, easy to prepare dish. My dinner guests just assumed I took the usual time and effort to make this sauce. I wonder if the other cooks who commented on the cooking time used a roast rather than a tenderloin because I found the timing to be accurate. I also allow my meats to sit out prior to cooking so that it cooks more evenly.

Rating: 3
I made this last night and thought it was great! My boyfriend thought it was a tad too sweet, however I will definitely be making this again - maybe with some long grain and wild rice sprinkled with toasted almonds. Sauteed mushrooms would probably go well with this also, though I made green beans last night. Excellent recipe - I look forward to making it again!

Rating: 4
This was absolutely wonderful! I've made it for three dinner parties now and usually serve it with sweet potatoes; everyone raves about it. For low fat cooking-- omitting the butter and using non-fat cooking spray-- it does not significantly alter the taste.

This is a family favorite. Very easy to make for a weeknight, yet, impresses weekend company. If you are looking for an easy sauce for duck - try this one, it compliments seared duck breast very nicely.

This was great! I used a 1+ lb. tenderloin, so doubled amounts for sauce, using 1 whole can of jelled cranberries (I was out of whole berry sauce)... I also used dried rosemary instead of fresh. I baked it about 20 minutes and it was moist, tender and very juicy. My husband declared it a winner. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and fresh steamed green beans. I will definitely make this again and again!

Rating: 4
This has become my family's favorite dish! It's so easy and has great results. You can also be flexible with the sauce: I have used beef broth instead of the chicken, and jellied cranberry instead of the whole (sometimes kids prefer this). Though I prefer fresh rosemary to dried, I have used the dry and it's still good.(for ease, chop the dried rosemary right in when you're chopping the onions) I've had many requests for this recipe after serving it!

This recipe was a winner from the start. I even had to buy a skillet to make it, BUT IT WAS WELL WORTH THE INVESTMENT! My husband and I love this and I'll bet I serve this 2-3 times a month. Even my grandchildren love it! Now that's a recommendation. It's simple to make and is the most tender pork we have ever eaten. This is definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic recipe. Very easy & delicious. I'm currently on a no-fat diet for medical reasons (maximum about 4-5 grams of fat for a main meal), and this recipe has become one of my favourites - I ditched the butter, seared the pork on a grill pan and just used a little of the stock instead of the fat when sauteing the onions. Served up with a well-baked jacket potato studded with garlic and a green or two... mmmmm.

Rating: 3
A very good and relatively easy recipe. I thought that the rosemary was a little out of place in the sauce. Next time I will rub the rosemary on the turkey before searing and roasting and leave it out of the sauce. I served with wild rice and cut asparagus, and it was great.

My family absolutely raved about this dish. The sauce is like nothing we had tasted before. I added a bit more cranberry than what was called for and served it with oven-roasted potatoes (although mashed would be terrific too) and sauteed baby bok choy. I will be making this again!

Rating: 4
So easy, so delicious -- epicurious made me look like a star at our recent dinner party even though I'd never done a pork tenderloin before. I made the sauce in advance and reheated it while I was preparing and roasting the tenderloin. My cranberry sauce was a little light on the cranberries so I added a handful more frozen whole cranberries I happened to have. I took others' advice and cooked the sauce with the rosemary sprig intact then removed before serving. Served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. It was delish!

This may be have been the best pork tenderloin I have ever had. The sauce paired so well with the meat. However mine did take quite a bit longer in the oven than the recipe stated as well.

Thought this was okay. Thickened sauce a bit and probably should have just left it per the recipe. Good sauce but it just didn't taste that great. Maybe will try with figs and/or prunes for a better sauce taste.

WOW! I made this for Christmas eve and what a smash hit! I made the sauce ahead of time and cut the tenderloin into individual "steaks" so it would be quicker to cook. Excellent recipe for entertaining because you can do a lot of prep ahead. I tripled the recipe and it was AWESOME! Served it with sweet potatoes, marinated/broiled baby asparagus and a green salad with almonds, red onions, madarine oranges and vinaigrette. YUM!

Wow! good stuff!, I made a few changes, I doubled the amount of cranberry, let it reduce a little and then strained. I returned it to the pan and thickened with a little corn starch. I also added a little red food coloring whick gave it a great deep burgundy color. this is also wonderful on oven roasted chicken, a real keeper!!!!

This recipe is marvelous. I doubled the recipe for our family Christmas dinner. It was a hit. The combination of the cranberry sauce, rosemary, over the pork tenderloin was incredible.

Wonderful recipe. I catered a Holiday dinner party for 8 with this as the centerpiece. Fruit and cheese tray to start, then Butternut Squash Soup with Cider Cream (from this website), the pork dish, gorgonzola mashed potatoes, steamed baby carrots, butterflake rolls, and for dessert "out of the oven" ice cream sandwiches made with the chocolate chunk cookies with hazelnuts also found here. The hostess baked the cookies while her guests were having dinner, which made the house smell incredible. Served with vanilla Haagen Das and Amaretto hot fudge. Easy meal and I received two referrals because of the taste and presentation. Made cranberry sauce from scratch using the directions on the Ocean Spray fresh cranberry package.

I was suprised this got such good reviews. I thought that with cranberries, balsamic vinegar and pork what could go wrong? I love all of those ingredients but they really do not go together well. My husband is out picking up our pizza right now since this was such a disaster.

Turned out very good, & w/nice presentation. My husband usually doesnt go for "fruit sauce" recipes, but I think the balsamic gave it just the right bite so it was not overly sweet. My only sub was beef broth instead of chicken, I thought it would be a better compliment in flavor.

I have made this several times now for family and guests--its always a hit. My mom doesn't like rosemary in her food, so I simply added a whole "branch" of rosemary (approx 3-4 inches long) to the sauce and cooked it according to the instructions. I removed the "branch" before serving and the flavor was just as good if not better than with the chopped fresh rosemary.

the pork if very tender and the sauce excellent. My husband loved the left overs. Definite keeper. easy to make; to the cook from chicago. I think your pork might have been tough, to brown it for 2-3 minutes and cook it for ten which i cook for 20 it should not be tough.

I make pork tenderloin all the time, and this recipe yielded the moistest, most delicious results! I used one stainless-steel pan for the whole recipe...deglazed the pan juices with butter and sauteed the onions in that. Then I added the broth and cranberries (used nearly 2 cups of cranberry sauce). It was delicious!

Rating: 4
The cranberry gives it a Thanksgiving like taste, but the balsamic provides a nice balance. Excellent flavor though!

Rating: 3
Easy and flavourful. Increased the amount of onion, though, and cooked the onion a bit longer to carmelize slightly. To the cook from Chicago: to avoid having the thin end of the tenderloin cook too quickly and toughen, fold the thin flap at the end under the thicker part and tie it with kitchen string. When I cook whole tenderlons I always do this for more even cooking.

My Aunt made this dish when we visited last weekend. I was a bit skeptical after reading the ingredients (I guess I'm not very adventurous), but I was extremely pleased with the way it turned out. I almost wish she'd made more sauce to spoon on top. Nice blend of flavors. And I came here looking for the recipe so I can make it as well. YUM!

Rating: 4
I agree with the previous reviews--this was wonderful! I used the "triple cranberry sauce" recipe from this website rather than canned (also modify the cranberry recipe by adding a bit of Grand Marnier). You will need to reduce the sauce a bit if you don't use canned cranberries. It would be wonderful with a bit of horseradish...if you don't like chunks of onion try finely chopped shallot instead. This time I served with a side of horseradish mashed potatoes with fresh chives and garlic.

Totally delicious -- sauce is awesome. I cooked this (approximately doubled recipe) for the first time when my in-laws were visiting and burned myself on the 450F skillet handle. OW! Be careful. It was delicious (and almost worth the burn). I've since made it a few more times, once with some onion, and twice with some garlic in place of the onion. I prefer the garlic to the larger pieces of onion. Also, each time I've made it, I used home-made whole-berry cranberry sauce that I'd made and canned. I can't say how it compares to canned cranberry sauce -- I haven't even tasted that since I was a kid.

Rating: 4
This is easy and a great recipe. Have made it a few times. I however, didn't want the chunks of onion and the rosemary in my sauce. When making the sauce, press down the cranberries to smash as much as possible. I also added a nice jalapeno to add a little zip. You could also use red pepper flakes. I strained the sauce through a sieve and brought it to a simmer to heat and then served. Great with brussel sprouts! Serve with a good Pinot.

Totally delicious - I cooked a pork tenderloin on the BBQ in my usual way, but made the sauce as something special for a dinner party, and everyone loved it! I would have to agree the rosemary is quite strong, but I wouldn't say overpowering. Two thumbs up, I'll definitely make this again.

Loved it!! Only thing I'd change next time is a little less rosemary (I agree with another reviewer who thought it was a bit overpowering.) It also seemed to take a lot longer than 6 minutes for the sauce to thicken...and yes, I would have loved to have had more! Yummy!!

Very interesting recipe but I had some issues with it. The pork fillets did not sear in the butter but were still tasty. I had cranberries and cranberry sauce not whole berry sauce, I diced about 1/4 of whole cranberries and used the jellied sauce, it was fine. Actually it helped to thicken the sauce by itself faster. My question to others has to do with the vinegar. I had a very expensive balsamic and I just thought it overpowered the dish too much. Would appreciate hearing from others. I will make it again but with some changes.

Pretty good pork tenderloin and we really liked the sauce. I had to sear it longer than recommended to get it evenly browned and should have then reduced the amount of time it spent in the oven but didn't. As a result the tenderloin was overcooked and a bit dry so be sure and adjust accordingly!

The first time I made it I followed the recipe, but found the amount of fresh, minced rosemary to be incredibly overpowering.

Also, I find that the pork needs to cook between 15-20 minutes in order to reach the 155-degree internal temperature. Easy to prepare and truly wonderful... my guests are always impressed!

Festive and delicious! I made fresh cranberry sauce (hey, they're in season!) which I think was a nice start.

The balsamic really gives the whole thing a mellow kick. Everybody loved this.

This was fantastic and we thought it made a beautiful presentation. A very impressive dish for company or just for you! I should have doubled the sauce, as recommended, but I forgot! We served it with garlic mashed potatoes and carrots with cheese sauce (receipes from this site). One of the best meals we've made together.

This is quite good. The balsamic vinegar really cuts down on the tart/sweetness of the cranberries. A nice change for pork, and easy too.

25 Thumbs-Up!!! I have just arrived home from serving this to a client and family for their son's first Holy Communion party. As a Personal Chef, I am always looking for time saving, but with oustanding results recipes. I used two 10lb pork loins, placed slits with garlic in them, seasoned the outside with fresh ground black pepper, Kosher salt and fresh rosemary.Then baked at recommeded temp. Internal temp at 150 let it rest and perfection!! What's for my families dinner on Sunday THIS FOR SURE!!Outstanding

I felt like Julia Child serving this. It looked beautiful and tasted wonderful. The amazing thing is that it's so easy to prepare. I would make only one change, and that is that I would simmer the rosemary in the chicken broth to release the flavors, then strain to remove the rosemary leaves. I would then add the cranberry sauce.

This was DELICIOUS!!! I used a 1&1/4 lb. tenderloin, 1 whole onion, 1 whole can of broth, and a whole can of cranberry sauce. I also used a teaspoon of dried crushed rosemary. I added garlic powder to taste. I cooked the sauce ahead of time, so it would have plenty of time to reduce. It came out nice and syrupy. Served over garlic mashed potatoes. My hubby said the sauce tasted like a cranberry BBQ sauce! He loved it SO much, that he ate almost the WHOLE THING!!

I've made this dish at least three times since I read the reviews. An excellent entree -- fancy enough for company -- easy enough for an impromptu mid-week treat for the family.

A keeper for sure.

All four of us thought the dish was excellent, but not beyond compare. My guests from England thought the sauce was a little too sweet, but the rosemary taste perfect. My wife thought it was not too sweet, but too much rosemary. I thought it was just right. We doubled the recipe, so the reduction took a little while longer. We could have used more sauce than the recipe calls for.

I made this for dinner last night. It was good but by no means outstanding. Next time I will saute rosmary springs with onions and then remove. I have a recipe for Pork Tenderloin that is similar to this but I find it much more impressive. The pork is marinated in oil,garlic, onions, balsamic vinegar, rosmary, and black currant preserves. It is then grilled and basted with marinade. The remaining marinade is strained and boiled, then served on the side.

This was fabulous, quick and easy to prepare for a family dinner! My picky-eater mother-in-law even loved it. I added a teaspoon of sugar to the sauce at the end to sweeten it up just a bit, it seemed a little tart for our tastes. And, I cooked one of the tenderloins for an additional 10 minutes for those guests who wanted it more well done.

We served this for our Christmas-day dinner last December, to rave reviews from all concerned. Honestly, its very hard to mess up a tenderloin (unless you overcook), and the sauce was perfect. I would only say that you should err on the side of a larger cut of meat if your guests have hearty appetites.

Maybe this CONSTANT COMMENT section is getting incestous,i.e. a self-fullfilling prophecy in that the 30 recipes listed here have a much higher profile and therefore will get more "hits" than any other recipe. Just a thought.

This was a really good recipe. My family and friends raved about it. The first time I made it I had to use regular cranberry sauce instead of whole-berry sauce and I think it actually turned out a little better. It took longer to cook the pork tenderloin in the oven than the recipe said.

Rating: 2
I agree with naysayer. When I want a sweet and sour chutney sort of sauce, I have to confess, I go with Crosse and Blackwell's Branston Pickle Relish or Major Grey's Chutnery. The flavor is much more intense. This seemed watered down somehow. However I did like the suggestions for accompaniements. Corn muffins, green beans, and acorn squash were great with the pork roast.

Rating: 2
I make pork tenderloins at least 3 times/month. This recipe is marginal; I'm not sure why it received such glowing reviews. The recipe that is truly exceptional is the pork tenderloin w/ gorgonzola sauce from January! The pork is tender and flavorful ON ITS OWN, even w/o the sauce (as opposed to this cranberry recipe).

Rating: 3
Made this last night to rave reviews! I took advice and used much less rosemary (I cut a sprig and sauteed it with the onions, etc., and as I made the sauce ahead of time, let it sit until I reduced it.) Even so, too strong a rosemary flavor for me. I did sear the meat a little longer and roasted it at 450 for 20 minutes and it was perfect, but not quite the 155 they specify. I'll serve it to guests.

Rating: 4
Fantastic dish! Thanks to all who recommended searing the pork for longer before roasting - it made all the diffence in time. This also gave it a more savory and smokey sauce...very yummy!

I made this for a dinner party, and served the mashed sweet potatoes with Maple & Cardamon, fresh steamed spinach, and my own salad, which consisted of avacado, strawberries, Ruby Red grapefruit, red leaf lettuce and celery seed dressing. Everything went beautifully together (to the taste buds and to the eyes as well). Since, I have shared this recipe with several friends and my daughter. One friend has already served it herself. I have not heard anyone say they didn't like it. By the way, I also had to cook the pork tenderloins longer than recommended in the recipe. Mine were bloody at the end of their time. I travel in an RV and cook with a small gas oven. Perhaps my over was a factor.

Rating: 3
Yes, I did try this with center cut pork chops. It was excellent. Just sauteed the chops and proceeded with the rest of the recipe. Put the chops in oven to keep warm while finishing dinner and added ''pan juices" from platter to the sauce. Way too much sauce. We cooked it way down and added more cranberry sauce.

As others have mentioned, the recipe as written does make a LOT of sauce! Has anyone tried this with center cut pork chops instead of pork loin? Just curious.

Absolutely 4 forks! I've made this so many times, I'm starting to run out of people to serve this to! A couple of suggestions: Throw a couple whole sprigs of rosemary in when sauteing the onions and discard when onions are soft (who wants pine needles in their mouth?). Next, let the sauce simmer and slowly reduce for 30 mins ; make the sauce in the morning or the night before if you can and just heat before serving. This sauce improves the longer it sits. Can't wait to make it again soon!

Since it was for 6 people, I used a 3-lb boneless pork loin instead of the tenderloins. The recipe makes a LOT of sauce. I made as directed (except dbld the quantity of cranberries) and had enough to serve 6 people, even tho the recipe is for 2. Was a big hit w/ my dinner party guests. Served it with (from this site): mixed green salad w/ oranges, dried cranberries, and pecans; potato and apple galette; featherweight biscuits; and molten chocolate cakes. As well as some roasted asparagus.

My husband said it was excellent but I was not impressed. It was good, but I would never make it for guests.

This was SO easy ~ not to mention quick! The flavours were wonderful and nothing was overpowering. I doubled this recipe with 2 tenderloins and it came out divine ~ Would definately suggest to sear pork well before roasting as it helps with the cooking time and lends wonderful flavour to the drippings which are later added to the cranberry sauce. YUM!

I do not normally try new recipies with guest, but I did serve this one and it was a true success. Everyone enjoyed it so much ( in fact, one of the guest said that it was the best meal he had ever had) that the guests asked for the recipe and served it at the next two dinner parties they hosted. The only thing that I had to do different was cook the pork longer that suggested in the recipe. Definitely, a keeper

This recipe is a great way to make the pork tenderloin as it keeps it moist inside and the flavours of the sauce really compliment the pork. And all of the ingredients are always in my fridge! I serve mine with jasmine rice and make sure to have extra sauce for the rice too.

The flavors in this recipe work wonderfully together. I like to serve it with the mashed sweet potatoes with maple syrup (and cardamom) recipe also found on this site. The green beans with orange zest is a good suggestion, but try making a little vinaigrette with the zest, some ginger, olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice or a light vinegar and pour it over the beans.

Made this for a holiday get together for friends who have kids. Even the kids loved it. Very easy, moist and delicious. I use the whole can of cranberry and less chicken broth. I slit the pork when 3/4 done and poured some of the thickened sauce over it. Beautiful and yummy! I followed everyone elses advice and cut back on the rosemary too.

Rating: 4
I have made this several times for my boyfriend and myself and each time I make it I have made an adjustment. I have found that making the sauce separately and then cooking the pork right before I'm ready to serve it gives the sauce time to thicken up. Before adding the chicken broth I mix about one tablespoon of flour to it and then add it into the onion and rosemary. I also use about 1/2 to 2/3 cup of cranberry sauce this gives it more flavor. I cut the rosemary back to about 2 teaspoons so it doesn't over-power the cranberry. Serve with baked sweet potatoes and asparagus! Excellent!

To Food Service Professional from San Francisco, I am glad that you spoke up and responded to NH's incorrect statements about Trichinosis and reinforced the fact that, yes, it has been greatly reduced in the U.S. but NOT COMPLETELY ELIMINATED. Stay healthy....cook your pork properly.

When I quit my day job and open my restaurant (it can't hurt to dream, can't it), I've found my 2nd recipe for the menu (seared tuna pepper steaks was first - look it up on Epicurious). A couple of tips. I used regular strength chicken stock instead of the low-salt called for (I never think the low-salt has enough flavor). If you don't use low-salt broth, you don't need to salt the pork, as the recipe recommends. I did, and it was a little too salty. Also, my onions could have been chopped a little finer - not too fine, though. Finally, don't skimp on the cranberry sauce. It all cooks up. I think at least 1/2 cup would be fine. Great main dish to serve to impress your friends, and pretty easy to make.

I haven't tried the recipe yet, but I can speak to the issue of appropriate temperatures for pork and trichinosis. Temperatures between 41-140 degrees are called the Danger Zone and most foods should be kept out of it to prevent food borne illness. Cooking the pork loins to an internal temperature of 155 degrees for 15 SECONDS will destroy most harmful bacteria. I would not cook any pork to less than an internal temp. of 140 degrees. Trichinosis in the U.S. has been greatly reduced, but it has not been completely eliminated. Any meat, pork included, should be handled with care and cooked to a safe internal temperature. All ovens are not created equal, and they cook at different rates. If the timing on this recipe appears to be off, invest in a good oven thermometer and/or have your oven recalibrated. If the pork is not done to one's preference after the requisite cooking time, cook it longer in 5-7 minute increments until it reaches the desired level of doneness.

Rating: 3
I am a health care provider, and Cook from Boston is right; trichinosis was a problem when pigs were fed slop/any human or animal leftovers. Due to modern pig feeding practices, it is quite rare in the US today; the risk is greater in some wild game. Trich, even if present, is killed at a temp of around 137-138 degrees F. One does NOT have to cook pork till it's gray...that is a waste of a good cut of meat.

We loved this recipe. I used the cranberry sauce (grand marnier) recipe from epicurious in place of canned. The flavors go very nicely together. I'm planning on serving it at my next dinner party, and passed the recipe on to my mom, who is quite a cook!

Wow, this sauce really was delicious. I definitely licked the spoon. I used dried rosemary and smooth cranberry sauce. Don't cook the pork longer than fifteen minutes; I think the ten minute estimate would be fine if you like meat on the rare side. Yes, I will make this again.

The pork was cooked perfectly pink after the time stated in recipe. I doubled the recipe, but next time, would not double the amount of rosemary. I also turned the tenderloins while they were baking so that they browned evenly. It was delicious, even my children ate it.

Just a quick note to the reviewer from Nantucket - pork is commonly served medium-rare now. Trich is pretty much a thing of the past, when sanitary conditions and healthy animals weren't regulated as much. Go into most any fine restaurant and you'll find pork served a lot more rare than it used to be. It does take some getting used to, but read up - you'll see that it's ok.

Well, I agree with everyone that the sauce is delicious, but I had a terrible time with the pork tenderloins. They were rare in the middle after the requisite ten minutes of roasting in the regular oven, and still pink in the middle after another ten minutes at 450 in the convection oven in an attempt to hurry things along. The whole timing of my accompaniments was thrown off as a result. Who eats pork "medium-rare" as another reviewer put it? Hello!!! Trichinosis!!! This is not safe. I will cook this again just to get the sauce-- but there has to be a better way to cook the meat. I served steamed spinach with this, and yams and regular potatoes in equal portions mashed with butter, nutmeg, and a splash of milk.

What a great pork tenderloin recipe. I agree that an instant read thermometer is helpful. It also took me 15 minutes to get to 150--it definately continues to cook after it comes out of the oven. Rubbed the pork with garlic before sauteing. When I reheated the sauce for my daughter, I added oj like another reader suggested and it was very nice. This is a keeper.

Delicious, but I changed a few things. Decreased the amount of chicken broth in the sauce and made up for it with orange juice. Instead of adding rosemary to the sauce, I made a paste of garlic, fresh rosemary and salt, and rubbed the tenderloin with the paste and refrigerated overnight. My guests thought it was delicious.

This dish was so easy and good, but it wasn't the best tenderloin recipe on this site. I have made many recipes here and I think this one is very good but the honey gingered pork is far better and even easier.

There was more than enough sauce. I also added some chopped dried apricots and some apricot marmalade -- a couple of tablespoons to lighten the cranberry flavor... it was just delicious. We'll certainly eat it again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish, but we found the tenderloin to be a bit tough. We recommend using a tenderloin roast and doubling the sauce, as previously discussed by other reviewers.

I had great expectations after reading all the reviews and I was a little disappointed. It was OK, but not something I'd make again.

Great dish that I've made countless times. The sauce is also wonderful with roast chicken. I've modified the quantities for the sauce recipe by using 1 large red onion, 1 can of cranberries, 1 can of chicken stock and also adding garlic. I start the sauce early in the day and let it simmer for an hour or more until very thick. I can then reheat it when I add the pan juices from the meat or poultry.

Fantastic! My entire family really loved this dish, The sauce is what really makes this dish! I too, doubled the sauce recipe which was good because I used a boneless pork tenderloin roast and have 1/2 roast left over. The sauce will make these leftovers a treat! I followed the recipe exactly and found it too be a very easy and impressive dish. I will certainly make this again, and wouldn't hesitate to make it for company.

Rating: 4
Tasty, easy and delicious. I followed the receipe as written but doubled the sauce because most receipes seem skimpy on sauces. I did not need to double but will freeze and use the extra sauce with the second tenderloin (most often tenderloins are sold with 2 filets together). The sauce makes this dish. It is fantastic. A real company dish. The tenderloin cooked exactly as timed...very moist and tender. I do have a high BTU cooktop and did not need to extend the cook time on the sauce...even when doubled. It is a keeper!

Rating: 4
I have made this dish many times and always successfully! I substituted thyme for the rosemary and added a little cornstarch to the sauce to make it adhere to the meat better because you can't get too much of it! I have also made the sauce hours ahead for company and just reheated it on the stove with alot of success.

My husband's highest praise after a fine, home-cooked meal is 2 simple words: "Company dish." And that's what he said while relishing this pork tenderloin. It was a perfect entree: easy to make but with complex, complimentary flavors and aromas. I doubled the recipe for my family of 4, roasted the pork for 20 mins @ 400 instead of 10 mins @ 450 (the butter was smoking too much at the higher heat), and reduced the amount of rosemary to a half Tbs. I also made the sauce in the cast iron pan in which I'd roasted the pork, de-glazing the pan with a little red wine before adding the onions and rosemary. The sauce required at least 15 minutes of cooking-down to reach the desired consistency. The pork was fork-tender, and I believe I could've drunk the sauce from the platter by itself. We'll make this over and over. We served it with creamy mashed potatoes and asparagus roasted with olive oil and sea salt.

Everyone at the table agreed this was excellent. I used shallots instead of onions and cut back on the rosemary. As with other comments took much longer then six minutes to thicken. I want to get one of the fancy stoves they use to make all these sauces as it always me much longer to thicken them then they suggest!

This was soooo great - even my six-year old liked it! You do have to cook the sauce a little longer to get it to thicken - I started right when the pork went into the oven. A real keeper.

I have made this dish twice and the recipe hasn't failed me yet. I did extend the cooking time by 5 minutes, but the sauce is great. Add more cranberry sauce if you like a sweeter sauce. It was also suggested that if you reduce some of the sauce till thicker, then brush on the tenderloins and place under the broiler for a minute just before serving, it would impart some color to the meat.

I made this for a couple of friends for a New Year's Dinner party, and it was great! I, like others who reviewed the dish, had to cook the sauce longer to get it to a nice thickness.

Wonderful. I love simple-to-make dishes with complex flavoring...and this fits the bill. Instead of roasting, I pounded pork tenderloin medallions, dredged in flour and sauted. Used half the rosemary called for. Wow.

I'm not usually a big fan of pork, but this recipe was delicious! I made it for my boyfriend, who typically steers clear of cranberries, and even he enjoyed it. It is a truly good, solid recipe that can be made over and over again without too much difficulty. Even the ingredients were fairly simple, which is always a relief!

Made this dish for my family this past weekend. It was a resounding success. Since there were 4 of us I doubled the amount of pork, but tripled the sauce and used the entire can of cranberry sauce. We have decided to try the sauce the next time we roast a duck.

I would really give this dish 31/2 forks if possible! My husband, who is not a big cranberry fan had 2 huge servings! I used 2 inch thick boneless loin chops, and seared them in about 2 tablespoons of butter. I too used the same pan that they cooked in to prepare the sauce. My chops put out quite a bid of liquid (although they were still very moist), so I didnt need to add more than a couple of tablespoons of broth. I also added garlic and onion to the pan while baking, as well as in the sauce (the onions carmelized nicely!). I will definitely make this again, due to the fact that it was easy, inexpensive and tasted incredible!

Other than that...Bon Appetit!

I made this last night and it turned out wonderful! I too used the same pan to cook the sauce in as the meat and the flavour was excellent. I reduced the sauce until it was thick which really concentrated the flavours. The meat turned out great; medium rare and was very juicy. I will have to try the sauce out on chicken next time. I just loved this dish!

I concur with the "Cook from Virginia" on making the sauce in the roasting pan. I also deglazed with a little red wine to liven it up. Great dish.

This recipe has become a standard in our house. I've recently made it for a group of 12 people using grilled chicken instead of pork. It is extremely easy and has great flavor. Made it again last night using pork and served with wild mushroom rice pilaf, portabello mushrooms stuffed with spinach and sun dried tomatoes sauteed in olive oil and minced garlic and sauteed yellow squash. Delicious!

I have made this dish three times now. The first time I followed the recipe, the second time I was at a friend's and she didn't have Rosemary so we used roated garlic instead with some Italian seasonings to add a little rosemary, the third time I added garlic to the written recipe. All were great! The men loved them! It is hard to serve this dish "elegantly" but the taste is great. I think the best presentation was out "Easter Eve" dinner with the pork, jasmine rice, steamed green beans, a salad of organic baby greens and edible flowers with a home made balsamic vinigrette and Mocha mousse torte. Add a great wine and it is a feast!

Rating: 4
To capture more flavor in the sauce, I use the same pan to brown and roast the meat and to make the sauce. After the meat is cooked, I remove it from the pan and keep it warm. I cook the onions, rosemary, etc. in the drippings, before deglazing with the broth and then adding the cranberries and vinegar. It takes a few extra minutes but adds a dimension of flavor and saves the washing up of one pot.

Rating: 3
Big hit in our house! Dinner was delayed, so I pulled the pork out of the oven just before it was done, sliced and covered. Sauce had reduced so I left it on and kept adding water and repeatedly reducing. When others finally arrived microwaved pork for one minute and plated on top of sauce. Served with fresh field greens salad and double baked roquefort potatoes. This recipe stood up very well to the "when are you going to be home" test of a busy family.

Very very tasty. Definitely double the cranberry. Only complaint was that the pork took much longer to cook than noted. Therefore, everything had to be kept warm while I waited for the meat to finish.

I thought that this sauce was very ordinary compared to others that I make to go with pork.

Rating: 3
Usually I am very disappointed in the epicurious recipes people rave over, but this one was actually good. The pork did take longer (abt. 20 min) to cook, even after searing and at that temp. I used shallots instead of onions and 1 clove of garlic in the sauce for a little more flavor; I omitted the rosemary as I'm not crazy about it. There is really plenty of sauce here for the amount of pork specified in the recipe--I made the mistake of doubling the sauce and we had a ridiculously huge amount of it. So, don't double it unless you double the meat; also don't add more cranberries or the sauce will be too tart. It's really almost perfect as-is. I served this with sugar snap peas and mashed new potatoes. While not quite elegant enough for company, I would make this again for quick but nice dinners at home for my family.

We really enjoyed this dish. The pork tenderloin came out very moist and tender and the sauce...WOW! I actually made triple the sauce because I had purchased more of the pork tenderloin than the recipe called for,so we had quite a bit leftover. That turned out to be a real plus because we loved the sauce so much that we wanted to try it on other meats. The next night my boyfriend wanted to have it on grilled lamb shoulder chops, that was really good. The night after that, we had it on grilled veal. Again really good. One thing I did a little differently than the original recipe was to puree the sauce in a blender. I thought it would make a little nicer presentation and I felt it did. This is a definite keeper.

This was a great recipe, I will definitely be serving this the next time I have company. It was so easy and I made the sauce ahead, and reduced it more as the pork cooked. I took the advice stated in other reviews and added more of the cranberry sauce. It was great. I did double the sauce and backed off a little bit on the fresh rosemary.

Extremely easy and elegant. This dish can easily be made ahead of time, then reheated. Very good for company (got rave reviews from my guests). One thing about making it ahead, though -- if you are not going to serve it within about 24 - 48 hours, then definitely cut back on the rosemary a bit. I used fresh rosemary, and served it four days after making it; although it doesn't hit you all at once, the rosemary starts to overwhelm the dish. I will defintely be making this again -- as a previous reviewer suggested, I think this would also be delicious with duck.

The speed and ease of preparation makes this recipe appealing. Even novice cooks can make this suitable-for-company dish. Make sure you really SEAR the tenderloin with high heat - try to get a crust. The 10 minute cooking time may seem short, but I bet the recipe assumes you are using meat not straight from the fridge, but meat that has been sitting out at room temperature for 30-60 minutes (this is actually a good, common technique). But do cook the meat until the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees. The sauce is a wonderful accompaniment. Sweet onions and shallots are acceptable alternatives to yellow onions, but you need to use the whole-cranberry canned sauce, if only for texture.

Truly enjoyed this dish, only suggestion would be to sliver the onion instead of chopping.

This was a delicious dish! Very easy and relatively inexpensive to prepare (pork tendlerloin was on a good sale this week). The entire dinner took me about 35 minutes to make. I made my "standard" corn muffins (out of the Fanny Farmer Cookbook) and put the pork in with the muffins for the last ten minutes of their baking time, then left the pork in the oven alone for another few minutes on a bit higher heat. I served this with a simple green salad...my husband raved about it. Be careful not to over-cook the pork so that it stays juicy.

Great relative lowfat dish. I used red onions to sweeten and reduced the sauce to a runny chutney to bring out the cranberry sweetness. Next time I think I will saute the pork in slices to get better consistency of doneness. The end pieces were a little overcooked despite only going to 155 degrees. Went great with a Soquel Vineyards 1993 Pinot Noir.

Not really a review, except of a comment from another writer re menu suggestions. While she/he may find them "patronizing", I welcome any help with what to serve -- after 37 years of meal planning, I need some fresh ideas !

Luscious, deep demi glace flavor. I substituted shallots for onions. Next time I would mince the shallots for better texture.

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was a cinch to make and gourmet delicious. I would make this for company and feel great about it. But be sure to use a meat thermometer -- it took the tenderloin longer to get up to temperature than the recipe said it would.

I think one could safely use less cranberry sauce. Also, using two skillets is not necessary if you brown the pork in the same one you use to make the sauce, then transfer the pork to a roasting dish. As for the accompaniaments, I can do without suggestions such as this! I mean, come on: butternut squash and corn muffins? Boiled green beans with orange zest? Ice cream with warm chestnut sauce? This is just annoying and patronizing; it seems to be trying to turn a quick and easy recipe into an all-day marathon.

I made this dish for a last-minute, no notice, dinner with my Mother-in-Law. She actually liked it and gave me a complement! This is a wonderful dish, I will definately make it again. My husband even had to agree (finally) that sweet/fruity sauces are great with pork.

I tried this dish because there were so many positive comments on it, but wasn't crazy about the sauce.

I made this with fresh frozen cranberries I had on hand that I cooked with some orange juice and sugar. It worked just fine and the dish was pretty and tasty.

easy to make - few ingredients - had to substitute dried rosemary - added some basil, too. great for after Christmas/Thanksgiving when you've got too much cranberry sauce on hand

What a great dish! Very easy to prepare and very tasty. Our young sons, 3 and 5 1/2, enjoyed it as well.

Not only great for dinner but use the remainder tossed with green beans and potatoes as a great lunch salad the next day.

Was an excellent dish the first time around. Adding some dried cranberries as well was also a good addition.

The first time it was great but always looking for a new twist -- I added Portabellos and fresh raspberries with raspberry liqueur the second time ----- excellent !!!!!!

Deee-licious and easy to make- a hit with the whole family- we accompanied it with my wife's own invention-yams and little apricot pieces with crushed hazelnuts, brown sugar and Frangelico...yummy.

Family loved it. I tried it with turkey tenderloin the next week and that was a hit also.
