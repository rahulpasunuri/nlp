This is a great recipe! My family loves it. I've made it a few times now and it always turns out good! My 14 year old son requests it and my 9 year old daughter really likes it as well. I just use any cheap pork I can find at the market and I saute the chili sauce in a skillet to give it a little toasted flavor before adding to soup.

AWESOME! My only issue was the chilies. I used ancho chilies and only 1 1/2 ounces, and seeded most of them before I soaked them - I ended up blending only half of them and added the mixture bit by bit and it was still pretty hot (in a good way). I also kept adding chicken broth and cooked it for a much longer time than 30 minutes. It was fantastic. I just wonder about the chilies and if ancho are the right kind to use, and if mine were particularly hot.

I grew up eating my mom and grandmother's Pozole so I never had to make my own. After living in Italy for almost 3 years I decided enough time had passed and I should try to make some Pozole of my own. This recipe was so easy and delicious that I love making it and my family loves to eat it!!!

This has become a family tradition. Even the most hard core Mexicans in the family look forward to this dish. The recipe is easy and tastey. Other pozoles I've tried have some fatty and boney parts which makes for a less pleasurable eating exp. This one leaves in only the best parts, so you can confidently fill your mouth with spoonfuls of goodness.

This recipe is delicious, easy and pretty cheap to make. This was the first time I've used dried New Mexico chiles in a recipe. They added so much flavor, color and depth without significant spice. I used fresh oregano instead of dried and added a couple sprigs of thyme and two bay leaves. I think the thyme and bay leaves added some flavor. I'll definitely make this recipe again. One cook recommended cooking your own hominy rather than in the can, and I think that would've added an authentic quality, but for time's sake, the canned variety worked great here.

OUTSTANDING!! Super easy for being pretty much from-scratch. I did add a 4th teaspoon of salt towards the end. We served with cilantro, lime, oregano and red pepper flakes, oh and sour cream and tortilla chips. I don't know what country style ribs are, but I just asked the butcher at the Mexican market and he gave me some chunks of pork with bone and skin. The only thing I did differently is I thinly sliced the remaining onion and simmered it with the pork and garlic. Will be making this again and again - although will research how to incorporate fresh mint which I've read is authentic. BTW the kids liked it (6 and 11) too - not too spicy.

My partner said, "This is my favorite soup ever!" Granted, she says that almost every time I make anything new, but far be it from me to reject a compliment. This soup is super easy to make, very flavorful, and yields a lot. I halved the recipe, and still had enough for 6 people. I also used a combination of boneless pork chops and loin chops (what I had in my freezer), and added 1/2 an onion to broth while cooking the pork. We chose tortilla strips, thinly sliced cabbage, limes, cilantro, and feta cheese as accompaniments. Delish!

As a beginner I really appreciated this recipe. I know how to get deliciously flavored shredded pork (which I love) and I know how to make a delicious chile sauce from scratch. I love all the garlic too. By the way, the ancho chiles from penzys spices and the Mexican oregeno are extra delicious. I would love more pointers on getting delicious, authentic ingredients.

I think everyone has their own way of making Posole and everything thinks they're right. I was taught to make this by a little old Mexican lady who is one of the finesst chefs I know. She added bay and thyme from her garden to the broth (which she made using water, chicken, pork and onion) and then she sauteed the dried chile guajillo and onion with half a tomato (she said she likes tomato) and more thyme. After sauteeing she added some water, pureed and pressed through a sieve. She also served it with iceberg lettuce, and, interestingly, as I recall, her Gran Libro de Cocina Mexicano also calls for iceberg lettuce. Perhaps the cabbage thing is regional?

This was fantastic, with one big exception. There's 97% of a day's allowance of sodium in ONE SERVING. I imagine you could put that much salt on a truck tire and make it taste pretty good. I love salt. My favorite bagel, salt, favorite snack, pretzel. This recipe is ridiculous. Let's add it up. I made a 1/2 batch. 2 cups of regular (not low sodium) broth 1,700 mg, 29 oz. can of white hominy 4200 mg, 1 1/2 tea salt 3,450 mg. Grand total: 9,350 mg div. by 4 servings in 1/2 batch, 2,338 in one serving!!! Then my favorite part of the instructions: "Simmer pozole 30 minutes and, if necessary, season with SALT." I added one arbol to a half batch, made it very spicy. Recommendations, reconstitute dried hominy, or if using canned, do not add any of the salt in the recipe and use reduced sodium broth.

Rating: 4
I like this recipe and it's very easy to make. I made a few changes to it: -I use lean beef stew meat instead of pork (cut the cubes up smaller and salt and sear before boiling). -I mix milder ancho chilies with the New Mexico chilies. -And with the garnish... I believe it's more traditional to use cabbage than the shredded romaine lettuce suggested here.

This was my first time making pozole and I was a little skeptical of this recipe because it seemed so simple, but it turned out great! I only had pork tenderloin so I did 16 cups of water and 6 chicken bullion cubes. I didn't want to lose any flavor in the broth. I also used 3 oz of New Mexico red chiles and 2 oz of dried ancho chiles. This spiced it up quite a bit. Great recipe!

Rating: 3
Tasty recipe, but not as flavorful or spicy as I expected. Will make a lot more of the chile sauce next time, or possibly just throw in some hot salsa. Might also consider marinading the ribs in something, although I'm not sure what.

This was a fairly good recipe. I tweaked it a bit, i added a bay leaf, and some cumin, I used 5 Chile Guajillos, 5 Chiles de Arbol, and a little cayenne. However, I felt I need to up the heat a bit regardless. I also added some knorr (caldo de pollo) to the recipe to add to the flavor. It was a bit better than the pozole you would get in crappy chains in Mexico, like Vips or anything like it. But it lacks the depth, heat, and flavor of a true delicious home made, or street pozole. I'm going to tweak the recipe to try and improve it. I don't feel like this recipe provided enough broth, so I'll increase the amount of water next time, plus more knorr. It's key to use cabbage. I used napa, but you can use other kinds as well. Of all the pozole I've had in Mexico, I have never had it with lettuce, that's straight up ridiculous. Over all the recipe was great, (I just don't hand out 3 or 4 forks, I dunno, I guess Im picky?) maybe fine for a Gringo pozole, but not very authentic.

My brother turned me onto this recipe. I grew up with my family in Colorado having homemaed pozole for holiday and special events. This recipe is not quite what grandma made - but she used more exotic ingrediants like pigs feet and trip(menudo). That said, this recipe is so simple and it's really awesome. I added a little more pork and doubled the amount of hominy (four 30z cans) and it turned out amazing. I want to try a different blend of chiles next time - more spicier.. Love it!

Oh! Also, you can put this in a crockpot or braise it in the oven. I prefer these two methods.

Very good recipe. If you want less prep, you can also simply put in a couple of small cans of fire-roasted chiles and canned mexican tomatoes. I also just put my onions straigt in, without doing that blender step.I think the tortilla chips are a great idea. You can dollop with Mexican Crema as garnish, too. Yes, that woman in the video was ridiculously stupid. An embarassment to epicurious.

This is a very unusual combination of flavors for my traditional North American palate, but I was very pleased ultimately. As so many others have written before, the garnishes are critical to the success of this dish. The Pozole itself is rich and garlicy, with a smooth, wet texture resulting from the very tender pork and hominy. I boiled the ribs longer than the recipe specifies, and was glad that I did when it came time to pull the meat off. I also added a diced fresh serrano for breadth, in addition to the dried peppers. As garnishes, I used diced avocado, shredded lettuce, chopped onion, diced radishes (perfect!), lime wedges, and cilantro. Mixing up these flavors in every bite made this hearty stew much more adventurous.

Excellent starter for me. I buy NIXTAMAL from a local Mexican market and use it instead of making my own or using canned hominy. I also add gormet chorizo for added depth of flavor.

Everyone in our house loves this recipe, which means it serves six rather than the suggested eight. Only real change is that since 2 ounces of dried red chili powder creates eye watering results, we prepare the recipe using 1/4 cup of the same type of chili powder purchased in the bulk section at Berkeley Bowl. Also don't bother with the homemade tortilla chips. On the side we serve napa cabbage, cilantro, oregano, jalapeno pepper and lime. Delicious!

This recipe is so easy to make and always gets fabulous reviews. A dollop of sour cream, lime juice, fresh sliced tomatoes and cilantro really make it. Tortillas are served on the side. When making this recipe recently, I used dried smoked chilis that were purchased on a trip to Oaxaca and they really added a wonderful dimension.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I used Goya brand hominy, which my husband says is more suitable than certain other brands that have a larger, softer hominy. I used cabbage and onions and the fried tortilla strips. I thought it lacked a bit of depth, so I added some sort of soup base (solfito?) by Goya, which gave it a tomato flavor. Next time, I might add some tomato paste or chopped tomatoes. I used pork butt instead of ribs. I cut it into chunks so it cooked faster, and then shredded it.

Fantastic! I have made pozole before, and it's typically a little thicker with stewed tomatoes. This was incredible... I served it with sour cream, radishes, cilantro, green and red onion, lime, and the homemade chips.

I cannot imagine this tasting any better ... it was wonderful ... I used the pork butt instead of ribs ... 4 cups of chicken broth and 12 cups of water with knoor suisse for each cup ... I also used chile sauce in the can equalling 1-1/2 cups and sauteed finely chopped onions in a bit of olive oil, a bit of salt and the dried oregano and then placed this in with the pork and broth ... I cut the pork butt in large chucks and after several hours as per recipe, shreaded it and placed back into the broth ... I also threw in two large chicken legs, bones and all ... and when shreading the pork I removed the skin and bones and shreaded the chicken legs as well ... otherwise, I followed the directions to a tee ... and it was fantastic ... I sliced cabbage rather than lettuce used a bit of lemon instead of lime ... and also served with those crispy round tortillas ... BIG BIG WOW ... WHAT A FANTASTIC DISH ... it brought the rose to my cheeks ... that's for sure ... oh, I forgot, I also served it with red table wine ... nothing all that fancy ... because this is truly a country dish I feel ... but wonderful nonetheless. Oh ... I threw in a little red pepper flakes for extra zip and spice and cooked the pork longer than recommended for extra 'melt in your mouth goodness' ... SUPERB!!! In fact, Exquisite ... PS ... don't forget to skim off the oil/fat along the way so that it is pretty perfect!!!

I make pozole whenever I have left over pork. A few shortcuts for Pozole... and it is just as good: If using left over pork (and I use loin and boston butt - usually if I have roasted it) cut it into bite sized pieces, poss it the fry pan and brown in a little EVOO). To the fry pan I often add little pieces of carrot and some chopped onion and then right at the end of the browning I add soome red pepper flakes. Deglaze with the chix stock. Instead of chiles, use a small (or large depending on batch) of good red enchilada sauce. Really... it is good. Dump it into the stock with the hominy (which you should rinse because they use lye). Let it cook down and garnish it with the stuff they suggest. You can also add to the soup: red pepper, cilantro (right at the last)... I do not put tortillas in it, but do serve them along side or I make little folded over cheese quesadillas with a little spring onion or serrano chile folded in.

I have used this delicious recipe as my "starter" for posole a few times, always with good results. This time, used pork shoulder, neck bones, 6 ancho and 3 guajillo peppers, and of course added Knorr suiza! A couple notes, though...I can't imagine using canned hominy. Yuck! I get dried white posole online. And my wife, who is from very near Guadalajara, swears that the only way posole is served is with lettuce, not cabbage. (Either works for me.) BTW, I give out four forks ("A dish beyond compare") about as often as Mobil gives out 5 stars. ;-)

Rating: 3
A reasonable attempt at the real thing, without the pig's head. I toasted the chiles before soaking them. The dish lacks the depth and complexity of a really good pozole rojo that would be found in Mexico. Will try a mix of anchos and guajillos the next time.

Loved it! Had never made it before, and had a late guest, so had to keep it cooking for longer than anticipated...should have added more water (all of the leftovers liquid was soaked up in fridge, but made great burrito filling!). Didn't find it fatty, but did a very thorough skimming job. Halved it and used 3 peppers...I don't like spice, and it wasn't near spicy enough. Used the Mexican chicken season mentioned in other reviews and I think that really helps.

My children love pozole.. this recipe is the best yet. I used 4 dried Aneheims and 5 dried New Mexico Chili's. Also used 6 TBS of the Knorr Suisse that another reviewer recommended (OMIT salt if using the Knorr Suisse) This adds alot more flavor to the added water. We had an au-pair from Mexico and she always used the Knoor Suisse when cooking mexican specialties for us!

Great pozole recipe! I like to substitute part of the New Mexico chiles with an ancho and a pasilla. If you like it hot, try using a few dried arbol or pequin chiles. For the accompaniments, use a firm cabbage instead of lettuce; it holds up better, and is more authentic.

I made the mistake of using chili powder instead of ground New Mexico chilies. Thus, the dish lacked the heat I'd anticipated. I used boneless spare ribs and made 1/4 the recipe. It served 3 amply. Next time I'm going to add lots of cilantro at the end.

Have made this recipe 2 times & have enjoyed both times. Use diced stewing pork since it is much cheaper & results are fine. Added a little Buffalo chipotle sauce b/c we didn't think it was spicy enough. May try a different dried chili next time, like ancho or guajillo.

I prepared this recipe for a casual supper on Christmas Day. It was wonderful! We served it in deep bowls to hold all the fixings along with crisp tostadas and hand mashed frijoles on the side. I added about a third of the chili sauce as earlier suggested and passed the rest at the table which was quite satisfactory. I will most definitely serve this again and again.

Being American, but also of Mexican decent, I must first clear up one thing! Pozole does not originate in New Mexico, it has been a favorite dish in Mexico for centuries, originating in Guadalajara, Jalisco. My father & Grandmother are from Chihuahua, Mex., and my fondest memories are of going to my abuelita's house, and eating her Pozole. Theres absolutely nothing better in the world! Heres a tip you will only learn from a mexican, there is a product called Knorr Suiza (like chicken bouillonbut in powder form, not cubes) If you add - maybee 1 tbspn to each cup of water used in cooking the hominy (Which we refer to as Nixtamal) instead of plain water, it will make the pozole so much better!

Made it exactly as written. The texture of the pork (soft and fatty, even though I had taken off as much fat as I could) was a little unpleasant, and it tasted too much of garlic. Disappointing.

Rating: 4
WOW! Not knowing what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious this dish was. Anticipating house guests on a night I worked all day, I froze the basic recipe without the hominy and added the hominy when reheating with excellent results. I followed the advice of earlier testers and used only 1/3 of chile mixture and passed the rest at the table for those wanting a spicier bowl. Fresh pico di gallo, Monterey-jack cheese, cilantro, shredded cabbage, diced onion and avocado were excellent accompaniments placed in the bottom of a large bowl and topped with the stew made with chicken broth in place of the water. YUM!

I just made this and oh my god! I used a combo of 3 chiles, guajillo, ancho and new mexico. I only used about 1/3 of the chile sauce and I thought it was plenty, so did my guests. I served it with Crema Mexicana (Mexican table cream) diced onions and cilantro, a wedge of avacado and a sprinkle of lime on top. This was such a surprise in taste and texture. I also used Juanita's Mexican style White Hominy. Will definately make again. This would be great with shredded chicken.

I've been looking around for this particular recipe. It's now a regular dish at my house, but it really needs to be served with shredded cabbage, not lettuce.

This recipe is very close to the one in Rick Bayless' cookbook. I used 6 ancho chiles and 3 guajillo chiles. I added more water and then let it reduce via the last simmer. That intensifed the flavor but I think I'll try roasting the peppers too next time. I used some pork neck bones, a small piece of shoulder and the bulk of the pork was a very lean roast, cut up and not shredded too much. One tip I read elsewhere is to definitely use only white onion and for the garnish-destined diced onions, rinse them under cold water first to brighten their flavor to use as a topping once the soup is served. I was curious about sub'ing chicken stock for the water and I will try that too next time. Very good stuff and reputedly good for hangovers. ;)

We have served this to friends (usually larger groups) ever since we found it in 1999. It always draws rave reviews. So much so that we always keep recipes on hand since everyone always asks for one. Two changes we make are we grill the ribs first for a deeper flavor and, for the same reason, we use Swanson's chicken broth in place of the 12 cups of water.

Rating: 3
This was a great starter recipe for the posole. However, my mother and grandmother always added stewed tomatoes and sliced carrots to their recipe. Unfortunately, doing the stewed tomatoes, makes the chili flavor much more mild than I like. Next time, I'd make more chili sauce for the soup. The roasted coriander gave it a wonderful taste.

Have made this twice since it first appeared in Gourmet. My husband, who is Mexican, says it's as good as any pozole he had in his country, and it's much easier to prepare. We'll be making it again soon. The dried red chiles can be a mixture of different kinds, if you don't have enough of any one kind. For authentic flavor, do use hominy.

Oh, I have been craving pozole sinced I had it at a resturant. I asked several people if they had a recipe, but no one did. I found this one, and I'm in heaven.

This has come one of my family's favorites! I have it down to a system now, having made it several times. I do substitute a little less meat (I use a pork "tri-tip" roast), and serve with finely shredded cabbage. This soup is so-o-o rich and flavorful. Well worth a little effort!

I normally use pork butt or shoulder in addition to pigs feet. As for additional spices try a touch of cumin and fresh ginger root sliced. If you preffer your "POZOLE" spicy add some chile de arbol picante sauce: soak about 20 chiles de arbol in 8 ounces of water overnigth after removing stems,grind in a blender, add salt to taste and one ouce of apple cider vinegar. Add picante sauce at individual servings. I also preffer fine chopped cabage instead of letucce.

This is a great dish. Very authentic tasting. I did follow a suggestion and added the "patas", along with roasting the chile peppers. I strained the chile paste well to make sure bits of skin were not added to the broth. Broth if rich and the pork fell apart. My family keeps asking for more. Added chopped onion, more oregano, and shredded cabbage.

We had been trying to duplicate the Pozole that we had eaten on a regular basis while living in California. Well this recipe did it. We make a huge pot for the two of us and eat it for 3-4 days! I added feet like one woman suggested and roasted the chilis before soaking them as another suggested. These extra steps make a BIG difference. We don't use lime as a garnish because we've found it diminishes the spiciness too much for us. Very pleased with this one. My husband is always asking me to make it. A little extra effort but worth it.

Made it for my "sayonara" party in Osaka, Japan with ingredients I had brought back with me from the States. Received rave reviews from both American and Japanese guests! Boiled up a one-pound bag of dried hominy to replace the canned hominy (cans were heavier in the luggage). Added a couple teaspoons freshly ground cumin and one more teaspoon oregano to the broth. Didn't have the whole chiles, so I used about 1/3 cup pure ground New Mexico chile instead--and made up a side dish of red chile sauce for those who wanted it spicier. For the serious Chileheads, I provided a bottle of Dave's Insanity Sauce. Now I'm back stateside and aim to make it again right away! Beats sushi any day!

This recipe is close to the pozole made by my husband's family from Jalisco (area of origin of pozole). My favorite comfort food. But if you want a more *authentic* pozole, and want to be adventurous, I suggest slow cooking a couple of pork feet and some pork neck bones (that's right!) with the meat. You will need to add more water if you do this. Trust me, this will add an incredible richness and flavor to the soup that will keep you coming back for more. For me, it's just not pozole without the "patas (feet)"! I concur with previous posts-use shredded raw cabbage, not lettuce, roasting the chiles. Mexican oregano is a must, Greek oregano is just not assertive enough for this dish. Try "Tapatio" brand hot sauce as one of the condiments.

Incredibly good. I followed the excellent suggestions of earlier reviewers (pre-straining the soaked peppers, cabbage instead of lettuce, baking the tortilla strips). After making it three times and feeling guilty because of the fat, I substituted boneless, skinless chicken thighs (NOT breasts). This cut the fat, and the braising time (to 35 minutes), and still tasted great. Now I can enjoy it even more often!

This recipe was terrific. My family really liked it. My kids even asked to have some for lunch the next day! I liked it because I could start it and then forget about it for awhile. I added some extra onion to the cooking broth with the meat. I also added a fresh pico de gallo (jalapenos, tomato, cilantro and red onion seasoned with salt,pepper and lime)to the condiment tray. Next time I will add more hominy and try using a spicier chile.

I had a special request for this from a friend who wanted to recapture many vacations in Mexico. Got reviews that they could be back there and I was forced to promise to make it every Father's Day. Used cabbage (both my friend and a very helpful produce manager-from Mexico) said it was mandatory. Also used boneless pork stew cubes to cut done on the fat. After making this I came across an article on roasting the chiles first. I'll do that next time as well as experiment with different chiles.

I cut this recipe in half for my husband and myself and it was excellent. It didn't take all that long and made a great one dish meal.

The recipe is excellent but flawed. When working with dried chiles one should always cut them open, remove the seeds and then toast them on a heavy iron skillet or griddle. This deepens the flavors of the chiles. The next step after soaking the chiles is to puree them and then you MUST strain the puree to remove bits of the skins that can be tough and bitter. This will greatly improve the texture. If you will add these steps to the recipe you will have a better dish. It only takes a minute and makes all the difference in the recip.

Made this for 36 people and all raved. I seeded the chilis and had different hot sauces on table. Also used sliced cabbage instead of lettuce which is more authentic (Nayarit, Mexico). Baked the sliced tortilla strips at 400 degrees for 15 min. to save on fat and for ease. Served chopped cilantro with other accompaniments. Great large party recipe. (I quadrupled and had leftovers)

Really was excellant, very tasty. Should be a little clearer on the amount of chiles to use. I cut the total recipe in half, using 5 chiles -- I liked it, but it was a little too spicy for one guest.
