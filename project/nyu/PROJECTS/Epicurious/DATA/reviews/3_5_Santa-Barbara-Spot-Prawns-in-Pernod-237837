As a pro chef, I would like to rate it 10 forks! It is the best fast food possible. What flavor! I used 16-20 shrimp and DON'T omit the tomatoes... they add just a hint of acid to balance the richness of the dish, and a nice color to the plate. I served this with roasted asparagus and sauteed oyster mushrooms. The total plate was incredible. It was 10 mins to peel toms and 5 mins to fix dish.. that's fast!

Wow! I used white wine (Pinot Grigio) instead of pernod, didn't use any stock, only 1 Tbsp olive oil and 1 clove garlic.Served w/pasta that I swirled in pan to pick up extra sauces. The chili pieces gave it a nice zip. Yummy!

I tried this recipe for the "with no fear" blurb alone! LOL! It's easily one of the tastiest shrimp dishes I have ever made to date. Do yourself a favor and try it for yourself. You won't be disappointed.

This is my husbands new favorite dish that he prepares as an appetizer. A real crowd pleaser that always gets rave reviews. He too leaves out the tomatoes (personal choice).

I substituted dry pale sherry for the pernod (not fond of anise flavors) and made it without the cherry tomatoes (didn't have any) but in the end it was delicious.

I also chopped large tomatoes instead of whole cherry tomatoes and added heavy cream at the end and served over pasta. Really good!

I don't what happened with this recipe, but it just wasn't very good. I followed the recipe exactly and while the prawns were good the sauce just didn't have much flavor or really any flavor. It was a waste of good prawns.

Excellent excellent excellent. We loved the taste. We printed the recipe, made it and 15 minutes later we were eating it. The best fast food that I've ever had!
