Fantastic, easy way to make sweet potatoes. We tried this for Thanksgiving and they went fast in the crowd. Made them again for midweek meal, easy, quick and tasty! Paired well with a grilled chicken salad.

These were a good alternative to more traditional sweet potato recipes, but not a four-star dish. The molasses/horseradish combination is unusual and tasty. Will most likely make them again.

Have been making these for Thanksgiving since first printed in Gourmet in 2003. Truly delicious and loved by all who try.

This was a great way to introduce variety at the Thanksgiving table. Everyone commented on the unusual, delicious flavor, and it was a nice alternative to the really rich casseroles we usually serve.

I made this for our Christmas buffet and everyone RAVED. I made a few changes - I used rubust (dark Molasses) which the recipe said not to use. The flavor was fine, but I would probably use light molasses next time, as the dark molasses has a slightly bitter flavor. I roasted the potatoes earlier in the day and gently tossed them with the glaze. Then, I put them back in the over for about 10 minutes to warm them up for dinner. They were just great, and everyone asked for the recipe. This is a great thing to make if you want a vegetable that you can prepare ahead of time rather than last minute for guests.

This was easy fast and simple - which makes Thanskiving so much less hectic. It got rave reviews from all my guests. It was so easy that I will be adding this to my everyday recipes.

loved this recipe. made it for Thanksgiving dinner and the nice thing is that the horseradish is not overwhelming but, it kicks in at the end. got very nice compliments on this side dish.

I've made this so many times I can't remember. I've never had leftovers, no matter how many times I've doubled the recipe!! It's a real hit. The hint about the sheet pan is spot-on.

If you're going to experiment at Thanksgiving, experiment with a side dish. And if you're going to experiment with a side, this is the one. Smokey and sharp, this glaze makes a tuber which generally seems bland and mushy-tasting to me despite it's sweetness really stand out. My boyfriend was saying "Mmmmm!" after each bite. Definitely adding this to the repertoire. (Oh, and fresh horseradish works as well--just use less than the commercial.)

I made this for the family at Thanksgiving and an encore was requested for Christmas dinner. Secret is to not crowd the spears so they can brown nicely. (The editors need to change the title of this recipe so it reads "MOLASSES HORSERADISH **SWEET** POTATO SPEARS"

Made this dish for Thnaksgiving this year, and it received rave reviews. The horesradish is not overpowerful, just enough for people to say "what's that flavor I'm tasting?" I've already gotten requests to make it again next year, and several people are asking for the receipe.

Great reviews for this dish--but the sweet potatoes didn't roast as nicely as I would have liked (probably because we doubled the recipe). The next time, I'd roast in two batches. The glaze sounds crazy--but it worked. Unfortunately, there weren't any leftovers.

You just have to love horseradish to like this recipe. This is my first impression, maybe I'll grow to like it more. We'll see.

When I first saw this recipe I wasn't sure about how it would be. I decided to try it and it was wonderful. Was a big hit with serveral guest. Had serveral request for the recipe. I used parchment paper and reduce oven temp to solve the potato browning to fast problem work great! Will be making this one again!
