This was a great appetizer. Make sure that the plantains are green otherwise they do not get as crisp.

This was really very, very good, although after making the cilantro dipping sauce, even though I slowly incorporated the oil, it separated. Before serving I ended up spooning off most of the oil, therefore next time I make this I will definitely cut way, way back on the oil in the dipping sauce to begin with. I also cooked the plantains in canola oil only so I could cook them on high heat very quickly....they were not greasy at all. Be sure and slice very thinly and cook till crunchy. The thin, crunchy ones were much better than the thicker chewier ones that I had experimented with!

yummy and pretty easy to make. I should have cooked the plaintains more, next time I might bake them in an oven so they aren't as fattening.
