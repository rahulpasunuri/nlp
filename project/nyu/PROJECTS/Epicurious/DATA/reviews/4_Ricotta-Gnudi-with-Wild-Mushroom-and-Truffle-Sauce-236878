I used veg broth instead of chicken broth, substituted Morningstar "bacon" for the proscuitto, didn't add truffle oil and didn't add so much butter. It was tasty and flavorful. I was hoping it may be elegant enough for a dinner party, but the gnudi were a bit sloppy in the sauce. Mine didn't turn out as pretty as the picture. Good flavors. I froze half the gnudi (individually on a sheet first and then I'll bag them). Hopefully, it will be a good quick dinner someday.

This recipe was enjoyed by all at our house. The crumbled prosciutto and sage on top make it a four star recipe. I did follow the recipe with a couple small modifications: I added a little bit of cream instead of the chilled butter to the mushroom sauce at the end, and also added 1/2 cup white wine to the sauce at first, so I decreased the broth by the same amount. It was labor intensive, as I didn't do anything ahead of time; next time I will.

Excellent! A lot of work to make it, but well worth the effort!

Oh my! This was the perfect cool winter night, lets be decadent and snuggle up dinner. I was a bit skeptical about the gnudi...gnocchi typically isnt my favorite but I do love cheesey gooeyness and this seemed like a nice compromise and oh boy was it. I had to make a few changes. My apologies to the purists. First of all this recipe is HUGE for two people. 2/3 of it is in my freezer. I made the gnudi exactly as stated and they came out superb. Not sure where I read about it but someone else mentioned doing a nice pan sear rather than boiling the gnudi so they would get a nice crunchy carmelized crust. I forgot all about that until I was 3 bites in and had that same thought. Thank goodness I have the extra so that will be the next rendition. The sauce was tweaked a bit. It's nearly impossible to find sage in my world but I did find rosemary and thyme. I love rosemary anyway so maybe it was for the best. I only had one itty bitty shallot so I added a half of elephant garlic clove. No pancetta but I did have bacon. No chicken broth either but I had a beautiful mushroom broth. I cut down on the butter and added some mascarpone, parm and a hint of whipping cream for the ultimate splurge. Note: if you follow any of my tweaks DO NOT add salt...the reduction of the broth with the parm was plenty flavorful enough. To turn this into a meal we threw in some grilled mahimahi and scallops. Cant wait to make this for my pro chef friends for one of our Friday night cook offs.

Help! I'd like to make a really knock-your-socks-off dinner for a date and I brought back preserved black winter truffles from France recently that I'd like to incorporate into a recipe. This recipe seems like a fairly good match, but what else can I serve with this dish? I'm still a novice cook and in the "experimentation" stage of what dishes go well with others. I'd like to serve this as a second course in a 3 course meal, so I need ideas for a really light appetizer and a not-so-rich 3rd course to go with the gnudi. Can you guys help me out? I'd really appreciate it!!! Thanks :)

Made this with tempeh bacon instead of prosciutto & veg stock instead of chicken. The gnudi were perfect.

perfect. my company enjoyed it very much that my sister in law wanted to spend few hours with me so she could learn how to do it exactly the way I did. Well I actually just simply followed the recipe.

Astounding taste and texture. Flavors are amazing. I used basil, and it's even better.Also substituted lower-fat ricotta--delicious and just as creamy.A++++++ recipe!

This dish was great. Potato gnocchi are almost impossible to make well (for me) but these are much more fool proof. The sage is a great touch.

they freeze just fine. Instead of broth I poured boiling water on some dry porchini and let it cool, then used the porcini with the rest of the oister mushrooms and used the porchini water insted of the broth. Then poured some cream in the souce. It was great. Will do it again and again.

Has anyone tried freezing the gnudi? I'd like to be able to make this ahead.

i substituted button mushrooms and used spiral sliced ham and it turned out to have way too much liquid!! almost like soup. the gnudi were delicious however. i tried reducing the broth beforehand and its a great idea to remove the mushrooms when you reduce the liquid. are wild mushrooms dry? what else did i do wrong? how about using bacon?.

this was a delicious alternative to gnocchi - light and really fluffy. I made the little logs of gnudi fairly small (approx 1" by 1/2") as they puff up to almost twice the size when cooked. The mushrooms and the sauce is really rich and flavorful with the butter and truffle oil. Everybody raved about it at my dinner party. It's good as a small portion as an appetizer or as a main. My only note is that there seems to be a lot more gnudi and not quite enough sauce to cover it all, so I used the leftover gnudi the next night and made a new sauce.

I expected to love this, but it was disappointing. The gnudi were much denser than I thought they'd be, and the sauce was average, nothing special. I think the mushrooms could have used some garlic, too.

I had not heard of gnudi,but tried this recipe and we loved it! I tried it with ricotta that I had made myself as well as restaurant quality ricotta. While I think the homemade ricotta makes for a fluffier gnudi, they both worked great. For the sauce, I used pancetta instead of prosciutto as that's what I had on hand. I did not have truffle oil, but will try it the next time. I also made a pesto/cream sauce and offered the gnudi with either sauce. Everyone really liked the options and are clamoring for me to make more gnudi soon.

I think I made the mistake of overworking the dough so the gnudi weren't as fluffy as I had hoped, but this may have been my fault. The only time consuming part was the actual forming of the gnudi - next time around, I'll follow other reviewers' advice and make ropes that I cut. Otherwise, not that much work for the result. I do also like the idea of adding a touch of sherry vinegar, which I will try next time. The dish was delicious as is though and went over well with my guests at a recent dinner party. The crumbled prosciutto on top is a must - be generous with it!

The gnudi themselves are immaculate -- the soft cheese and toothsome dumpling work together perfectly. I think not overmixing the dough is important, since it makes for a more inconsistent, exciting dumpling texture. The sauce is good, though a splash of vinegar -- we used sherry, not more than half a teaspoon -- brightened up the flavors. The sage leaves and the pecorino are vital to the final dish. Great!

Ricotta gnudi were excellent. Very light. When I was making them they seemed like they would fall apart in the water, but they held up well. I didn't love the sauce. We liked it better with marinara sauce. They were oddly shaped, but we didn't mind.

Haven't made it yet (we're still in the dough-resting stage) but I have a quick question: Epicurious describes this as a first course, and my meat-and-starch fiance wants something additional. What dishes/sides do you serve it with? We're making a simple veal scallopine to serve alongside, and I'm curious as to what others are doing.

ok... so gnudi are just ricotta gnochi, which I love. I had high hopes for the sauce but found it a little richer than expected. I little too savory. Maybe a little less oil and less sage would be in order, but I'm not sure without experimenting. The crispy sage and cripsy prosciutto made the dish, IMHO. Mixed reviews from my guests.. Some picked at it and ate the gnochi. some picked at it and ate the mushroooms. Some ate it all.

Delicious and very handy to make ahead. I made one batch w/ regular supermarket ricotta and one with fresh ricotta to see if there was a significant difference and there really wasn't. Some of my guests preferred the former ... but I thought the fresh ricotta was fluffier and tasted slightly less grainy. But if you're in a bind, regular ricotta will certainly do.

Absolutely heavenly! My new favorite dish of all time! I made this over the weekend for parents' 65th anniversary celebration(luncheon for 75). It was also my mother's favorite of the many dishes (most of which were 4-fork recipes off this site!) Other guests rated it "favorite," "best ever," & even "better than anything I've ever had in the finest restaurant!" Of course, those who don't like mushrooms won't touch it (their loss!) I tripled the recipe & added some additional kinds of exotic mushrooms to the mix (where I live, you have to grab what you can!)& really had to scramble to find black truffle oil. (However, I loved the aroma/flavor, & who knows what recipe might taste better with that pricey little addition?) Made the sauce the day before, as well as mixing up the gnudi--but didn't cook the gnudi--just left it on cookie sheets covered with kitchen towels in our 40 degree garage. (Cooking for crowds forces ingenuity; I needed a huge refrigerator! Sub 0 outside, in case you were wondering!) Rolled the gnudi into thick ropes and used a dough scraper (flat edged & easy to handle) to cut dough lengthwise into 2 ropes, & again halved each of those. Then rolled each of those in flour to coat & finish; repeated that until all dough was rolled out. Used kitchen shears to cut into 1" lengths. Really saved time! The morning of luncheon: boiled the gnudi & added to sauce, then sauted proscuitto & sage leaves & put them in a baggie. (When gnudi/sauce was in electic chafing dish for serving, garnish of crumbled sage and proscuitto was conveniently added.) Looked as pretty, & smelled as delicious, as it tasted!

Really glad to discover Gnudi! I didn't use truffle oil and still felt that this was really quite a nice new dish.

The dish was excellent and was visually very appealing. The sauce was really a good pairing with the gnudi, which by themselves are quite mild. Followed the recipe to a tee and I wouldn't change it next time.

The gnudi were good; the sauce quite unremarkable and not worth the effort. If I made this recipe again, I would make only the gnudi and serve it with my favorite sauce.

It's New Years Eve and my bro and sis-in-law brought these tasty pillows of heavenly cheese! They were great!! Sis-in-law says, perfect for entertaining because it can all be done ahead. She also suggest just making a big "rope" out of the mixture and cut it into the desired size nuggets. The sauce is great - you could also use any sauce you would enjoy!

Oh my gosh! This was an unbelievable dish. While staying in Manhattan over the holiday week, we ate at Dona's and had the gnudi for dinner. It was so delicious we wound up going back the next night for more! I politely asked the waiter if the Chef gives out his recipes (I just had to have this one!), only to learn it would be in the Jan. '07 issue. A wonderful dish and wonderful restaurant---highly recommend it!

Made this for Xmas and everyone loved it. Being mushroom hunters we added porcinis and chanterelles - fabulous. Be careful to not make the gnudis too large and once they float to the surface, they are done. About 4-6 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the gnudi from the boiling water.

This was outstanding. I suggest pulling out the mushrooms and reducing the mushroom liquid separately so that the mushrooms don't get overcooked. It will produce a more flavorful sauce. I also used wine to deglaze the pan and added in a bit of dry vermouth. The gnudi were perfectly fluffy. Made this as a second course for Christmas Eve dinner and received rave reviews. Would definitely make again.

My husband and I made this dish and while it was time-consuming, it was so worth it.
