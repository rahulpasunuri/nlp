I liked this recipe a lot, and my picky boyfriend even liked it. The next time I make it, though, I am not going to use a food mill for the tomatoes and then throw away the solids. I think that it would have been delicious to have chunks of tomatoes in the sauce, so I'm just going to chop them in the food processor. The almonds and bread crumbs can also be made in the food processor, which cuts down on prep. Also--I used only about half of the almonds that the recipe called for, because the full amount seemed like A LOT. It wasn't too crunchy that way.

This was great - an interesting mix of flavours. I used bottled tomato passata instead of sieving the canned tomatoes, and pepped it up with a little sundried tomato puree. I included the almonds (chopped very finely) but did not put any essence on them, and made fresh breadcrumbs with a French baton. Also followed other reviewer's suggestions and doubled the sauce although I did not use it all - probably 1 1/2 quantity would suffice. Very tasty and fun to mop up with some fresh bread! Leftovers were great too - even cold!

great--but does anyone know what "pasta chi civa" means in Sicilian??

Delicious! I made this easier by processing the peeled Italian tomatoes in a Cuisinart and throwing it all in. I also used sliced almonds, which saved time as well. This recipe makes enough for 8. The sauce does need to be doubled. I made this with the Blue Cheese Caesar Salad (subed gorganzola), fresh bread, and cannoli for dessert.

I made this recipe for our New Year's Eve dinner. It smelled wonderful while it was cooking, and tasted good as I sampled. Then came sitting down for the meal... first impresion was "hmm, this is different, pretty good." After a few bites the almonds became overwhelming as did the unusual sweet/spice flavors. We are fairly experimental, but why on earth would you want to crunch through a pasta dish???

this is without a doubt the most amazing pasta dish i have ever eaten - it was incredibly unique & flavorful - my taste buds were blown away - i made this 3 years ago and am still thinking of it - i had to find the recipe again!

This dish is absolutely delicious! I followed the advice of the cook who halved again the recipe ... perfect! The almonds are such a nice addition! We had six people for dinner and have enough left for a second round ... my husband and I can't wait to eat the leftovers!!

I think if we make this again we will leave the almonds out. They are really crunchy, and it's kind of disconcerting. The cinnamon was a unique twist, though, and was a nice change of pace. We prefer the penne alla vodka (this website) to this recipe.

I always have my eye out for recipes with unusual ingredients. It was the almonds and cinnamon that intrigued me. The end result was like no other pasta that I've had before. Great flavors, and textures. Made fresh bread crumbs from day old dutch crunch loaf. Also made 1-1/2 times the sauce which turned out to be perfect. Deserves 3-1/2 stars. Definite "must try".

This is a delicious recipe -- the almonds and the pasta are a great combination. I actually substituted soy "pork sausage" for the pork with great results. And I agree that I think I'd cut down on the bread crumbs next time (it probably didn't help that I made mine with less than fresh bread) maybe to 1/3 or 1/4 c. I didn't bother with a food mill on the tomatoes -- just chopped them up, seeds and all, and threw them in -- and it was still great. Toast the almonds until they're pretty dark to really bring out the almond flavor.

I used a 3/4 lb. trimmed pork tenderloin & ground it (10 pulses) in my food processor. Since I don't own a food mill, I strained the tomatoes thru a fine sieve, after pulse chopping them in the processor. This dish has great flavor from the almonds, my husband loved it. We had it with a nice Pinot Noir. I'll cut the bread crumbs to 1/4 cup next time (and use fresh bread crumbs that I make myself), there seemed to be too much. All that olive oil is unnecessary too, especially in the pasta cooking water.

This is a delicious recipe. It's perfectly composed and the meat is absolutely essential for the flavor. Without it, it would be seasoned tomatoe paste. It's also great reheated.

This was a good recipe which I found very easy to make. The sauce is tasty and in spite of the recipe's warning that the recipe didn't make much of it, there was plenty for the dish. It is a little sweet and very light and would be an excellent sauce for a lighter pasta, perhaps simply poured over spaghetti or angel hair. Next time, however, I'd leave out the meat. It simply is not necessary.
