I omit the mustard and basted with olive oil and balsmatic vinegar before grilling on the BBQ

I'm surprised that others didn't like this recipe. We've made it a few times and have liked it. I've served it to guests and they've enjoyed it. It's a nice dish for an otherwise bland veggie. Very quick, too.

We do yellow squash and zucchini on the grill all the time. This recipe is a bit over the top. I slice the squash, spray with olive oil and sprinkle with "canadian" steak seasoning. A spritz of lime is nice once it's turned, but a bit too much if it's served with it. The acid can get bitter. We love the freshly grilled veggies and wouldn't think to pour something on top. I think the mustard is too strong for the squash. Fresh squash is really good and doesn't need much else.

So-so, not as good as I had hoped it would be. I like slicing the zuchhini and summer squash thinner and then grilling. Not a keeper.

Staple last minute zucchini sauce. Quick & easy, with stocked ingredients. - I prefer to prevent the centers from becoming soggy by salting the open face of the vegetables and letting them sit for 10-20 min. before cooking, sponging off moisture with paper towels prior to applying olive oil.

Very simple and delicious. The leftovers just got better the next day after sitting in the vinaigrette overnight. I sprinkled a bit of thyme on top when I served the dish - a nice extra touch.

Simple and excellent side for summer bbq'd dishes.

I first tried this with grilled asparagus, adding a few grilled red onions. I served it at a potluck and the host kept the leftovers! It is wonderful as written with the squash an zucchini.
