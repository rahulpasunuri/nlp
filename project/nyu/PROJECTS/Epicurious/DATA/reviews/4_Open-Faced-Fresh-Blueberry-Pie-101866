Used frozen blue berries to make the "glue" and fresh for the rest. Kept the sugar to 1/2 cup and increased the lemon juice by a tsp.Came out fantastic. Will definitely make again.

I needed to add more sugar so I couldn't give this more forks. I'm sure my berries were to blame but once I added more sugar and a bit of vanilla it was much better. THE CRUST GETS FOUR FORKS THOUGH !!!

WOW! Best blueberry pie ever! And do use the suggested pie crust. You can't go wrong.

I loved this pie. The filling was not too runny and not too firm. I used the pie crust recipe suggested and together with the filling it was just the right amount of sweet served with unsweetened whipped cream. This is a keeper! I might try adding some fresh mint with the fresh blueberries next time.

Definitely an easy and delicious way to present fresh blueberries. Our pie was made with our own home-grown fresh blueberries from the backyard, right here in sunny SoCal. I do recommend that the lemon juice be added to provide a nice citrus note to the flavor.

This is an outstanding, very easy to make pie. Taste the blueberries first and adjust the sugar accordingly. I added more lemon and increased the amount of blueberries by 50% to fill the pie shell up to the top. I have tried it with several different crust recipes and the included "basic flaky" one is ideal.

Instant classic. The only blueberry pie I'll make from now on! Rave, rave reviews from everyone. The crowd rose as one for second helpings. You can use 1 cup of frozen berries for the cooked part of the filling, but the rest does need (and is what is so successful about this) to be fresh. I did not use the crust recipe, but would like to in the future. Great find!

I loved this pie. I agree with others when they say it is a great change from traditional blueberry pie and that it is perfect for summer. The success of the dessert depends on using fresh, sweet blueberries. Don't even try to make this with frozen berries or when blueberries are out of season. I added a little extra lemon juice and some lemon zest. I did make the pie crust recommended in the recipe, but I did not follow the overly complicated instructions, rather using the simpler way of combining the dry ingredients, cutting the butter in with a pastry cutter, then adding the wet ingredients and combining gently. It turned out very nicely and I would make it again. And I will certainly make this blueberry pie again too, but I am going to add more blueberries next time to maximize the deliciousness!

Okay, really I'm not much for reviewing food unless it's really bad. This is my one exception, only because this was soooo good.I made this for mothers day and it was really the best pie I've ever made. I even managed to mess up the crust by stretching it so it shrunk a little in the oven. Didn't matter though, the pie looked like a rustic dessert straight from a magazine cover.Everyone raved.

Terrific! Fresh, not too sweet, easy. I used a frozen crust and it was a snap. I tried the lemon curd folded into the whipped cream as suggested by another reviewer and it was a delicious topping. Next time I'll add another teaspoon of lemon juice to the berries.

My stepson does not enjoy desserts. He requested this pie to be made 3 times in a 10 day visit. His wife learned to make this pie (she does not cook) before they left so she can make it at home. Simple recipe, fresh taste, not overly sweet. I followed others suggestions and used lime rind and juice. It adds a nice little punch to the taste.

This is so yummy and so easy. My 12 year old made and entered it in a contest where he had to relate something he made to a book. He chose Harold and the Purple Crayon and won with this pie. He was tight on time so he used a ready made crust but cooked it as the recipe says and it turned out great. I've made it several times since and everyone loves this pie!

Love the uncooked berries. Why had I never thought of doing that before? We used half blueberries, half blackberries, and it was a hit. For a rather extravagant but wonderful topping, try this: fold chilled lemon curd into an equal amount of freshly whipped cream. It is a fabulous fluffy consistency, it looks lovely, and the citrus flavor works wonders on this already fresh-tasting, summery pie.

Really wonderful! Love the light natural taste. Have made this recipe twice and will make it again while the blueberries are plentiful. It is quick and easy as I used a store-bought refrigerated style crust (with a little dough-boy). My suggestion is to let the blueberry mixture cool down a little before spooning to crust. It sat up very well and didn't run when serving. Another reviewer suggests adding lemon zest; I am going to try that next time. Barbara

Love this recipe - I've made it several times, but this time I tried a few different things: I had a limited amount of blueberries, but supplemented with strawberries. The mix was really good; I added lime zest and juice (instead of just lemon juice) to the berries - I love a citrus flavour, and this really amped it up; I used a graham crumb crust (mainly to save time!!), and it complemented the berries well, and all my guests LOVED it; I had a ton of mint growing in my herb pot, so I added some to the berries, which also garnered favorable reviews... I'll definitely keep making this one!

This tastes great. I never thought I would say that a pie needs a little more goop to it, but I think that the whole thing - the appearance, the cut-ability, the tartness - would benefit from maybe half a cup more goop! Delicious and versatile as is, though!

Yes, all of the above. I added fresh lime juice and a splash of vanilla.Next time I will add a splash of grand manier (sp?). How about using strawberries instead? As a variation how about one of those fluted storebought sponge cakes as a base with a layer of whipped cream cheese with the berries on top?

Absolutely hate soggy, jelly type blueberry pie. This blueberry pie was heaven, but FRESH, sweet blueberries are a must. Some whipped cream on top and you have a gourmet delight. Made this pie using large, fresh, sweet blueberries purchased at a local farmers' market (Amish/Mennonite farmers). Even family and friends who weren't blueberry fans wanted second and third helpings. Luckily the recipe is so easy (especially with frozen crust) that I made three pies for the Fourth of July family and friends gathering--not a crumb was left over though other desserts and treats seemed virtually untouched. Exquisite pie, love it, but will only make it during blueberry season.

Made this pie with fresh blueberries and a group of 6 year olds. It was easy but incredibly tasty. The berries were perfectly cooked. We added some lemon zest and a dash of cinnamon and a dollop of vanilla ice cream. I'll definitely make this again and again. Easy to make with kids; tasty enough to wow the adults.

Really delicious, especially because the pie is not too sweet. However, this does not rate four forks since, as others have noted, it is too runny. I'm not enough of an expert to know if more cornstarch would help, but since it is so easy, I may try again with that slight change.

I reviewed this pie a few days ago but now I must update that review. After spooning the berries into the crust and allowing it to sit for two hours, berry juice overflowed onto the counter and the crust turned into a soggy super mess. Not appealing. And promptly two days after making the pies, they were covered with cute blue mold. Better luck to you if you try this one!

Almost too easy! My freezer/refrigerator broke so I had to find a recipe to use up the blueberries and blackberries I picked during the summer. I had the perfect quantity of berries for two pies and I just happened to have two pie crusts in the freezer. Before I knew what hit me, I had finished making two pies! This recipe is a keeper.

I think this recipe would have been great but I used frozen blueberries and made the mistake of not thawing them all the way through because my pie has come out watery. I think the best is to use fresh blueberries! Also, keep an eye on the first cup of blueberries when making the syrup or they can evaporate too fast and burn.

Very impressive! Use fresh blueberries. I use a Pillsbury frozen pie crust (the best). You roll out the dough into a glass pie pan. You do not need to coat the crust with egg white. I used lemon zest instead of juice and a little less sugar, but you can't go wrong whatever you do. So good and simple you can eat it for breakfast. I've eaten half the pie myself since I made it last night.

I have made this recipe many times (I own the cookbook). I just made it again yesterday with some fresh blueberries from the farmers market. Delicious and easy. What I love about this pie is that the blueberries maintain their integrity because they are not all cooked. Most blueberry pies are too sweet and lack texture. Be sure to make the basic flaky pie crust with this. It is worth it.

I don't even LIKE blueberries, but when I prepared this recipe for a friend and tried a little bit of it, I became a blueberry convert.

Wow ...is this good. I made the recipe as is the first time. The second time (in the same week) I did a graham cracker-toasted almond crust. I crushed the berries well for the syrup. And I added to the syrup part at the end: butter, vanilla, lemon zest. I then cooked the added berries a minute before spooning into crust. I did bake the pie for 15mins at 350 as another suggested. It set up beautifully. I used a total of 5 cups of berries. And I'm glad I did as it may of been too flat and too much of a gelatin consistency. I also did do the lemon cream top. This was a heavenly addition. My husband said it was the best blueberry pie he ever ate.

This is a terrific filling recipe! Raves all around for the 4th of July. I'm a complete convert to this method. I did use a different crust recipe (Julia Child using all french butter) which is my favorite hands down. Made 3 minor modifications: 1/ mushed up the first batch of berries a bit, as suggested by an earlier reviewer, to kick up more pectin release; 2/ left mixture over the med-low heat while folding in remaining berrie (i think this melded flavors effectively); 3/ let mixture cool for a few minutes before pouring into pie crust so that the base wouldn't get heated up and soggy. Fab!

I made this to take to an outdoor concert--started (including the purchase of ingredients) an hour and a half before I had to leave. The recipe is fast (for a pie) and delicious. Everyone loved it. I made both the crust and the filling exactly as the recipe directed and both turned out just as I'd expected. I particularly liked that the recipe called for ingredients that I already had, which made it very easy to make at the last minute. My husband is a self-proclaimed blueberry pie connoisseur and the pie won his heartfelt approval.

Tasty, but wasn't at all like a pie. The filling didn't set. It was extremely runny. Can anyone tell me why? I'd be really grateful. You can write me at bags2007 at yahoo dot com.

This blueberry pie is to DIE for!!! Just scrumptious but very different from the traditional blueberry pie - and I'm never going back. I attempted to make the pie crust and cheated by not fussing with the all the steps, but was careful not to overwork the dough. It wasn't pretty but it was light and delicious and a huge hit. The berry filling was phenomenal,and I messed up on the cornstarch (added it directly instead of mixing with water first) and didn't have real lemon juice on hand, and it was still lovely and light and like being in blueberry heaven. I also used splenda. I agree with one of the other reviewers; if you don't like fresh blueberries, then maybe this might seem a little bland. For me the traditional pie now seems cloying and heavy. Can't wait to see how this comes out when I do everything by the book!

So easy and so beautiful - I used my own favourite crust (with 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour) and filled 2 dozen medium sized tarts instead of making a pie. Fresh wild blueberries provide a far superior flavour and a prettier look as they are smaller and more delicate. I personally would not use nonwild blueberries for any purpose.

Great pie - a keeper!

No, this is not the one. I tried this recipe two ways, first as written. The uncooked blueberries were chewy and barely held together by the cooked syrup. A messy pie filling which tasted mostly uncooked. The second time I tried cooking ALL the blueberries into a cooked filling, and increased the cornstarch to 4 tablespoons. I also increased the sugar. The cooked filling still had too much liquid but I spooned some out. The consistency ended up being good, and it held together when cooled, but the blueberry taste was weak. I need to find another recipe.

I've made this pie several times. I've used Marie Calender pre-made crusts because of time constraints. You can make a great dessert this way in less than 30 minutes!!! For the gel/sauce, I've substitued a cup of frozen berry mixture (rather than just blueberries alone . The mixture includes blackberries, blueberries, raspberries then fold the pint of ripe, fresh blueberries into the thickened sauce. The pie tastes even better if you bake it for another 30 minutes rather than let the filling set. The other berries in the thickened sauce add a subtle nuanced flavor that had my dinner guests telling me that the blueberries were the finest they had tasted.

As always, Rose delivers a winner. ONE SMALL ADJUSTMENT, HOWEVER-- the two tablespoons of cornstarch seemed a bit excessive the first time I made this, making the filling a bit gummy.

ALSO... when I didn't have quite enough fresh berries for the recipe, I used frozen for the cooked part and fresh for the remainder. PERFECT!

I've made it more than a dozen times now and I've never had a chance to have seconds the next day because people eat it up fast!! You'll find no better blueberry pie recipe anywhere else! An important note -- make sure the berries are ripe and have flavor. And use FRESH lemon juice... none of that bottled stuff! Also, I use arrowroot instead of cornstarch because of allergies, but everything else I do as directed.

This is the cook from Mankato, MN who suggested spreading a white chocolate mixture on the bottom which a few of you referred to. To those who were disappointed, the pie is only as good as the fruit. Also, if it's runny, be sure you BOILED the sauce mixture a full 2-3 minutes-so the cornstarch can fully swell. The beauty of this pie is in its simplicity-instead of a too-sweet cooked berry pie, you get the pop and the tart of the fresh berry and that's what I think makes it better than most. I'm curious about the person who suggested "The Best Recipe" pie. Which pie are you referring to? I recently held a pie tasting at my house, wherein we sampled lots of different crusts and fillings. The basic flaky pie crust from the Pie/Pastry Bible I think is best, BUT use 5 T. of heavy cream in place of the water and vinegar. Soooo good. Interestingly, the favorite crust of the crowd, was the all american lattice crust from The Best Recipe cookbook, which I used with a peach pie, but of course it had sugar all over the top of it... If anyone is as completely obsessed with baking and perfection as I am, feel free to email me and we can exchange recipes. sclive@charter.net. Happy baking!

Eh. It was OK, but not great. The main plus is that it's so easy and quick, though the main reason for that in my case was that I used (gasp) frozen pie crust. If you're going to make a crust, I think it's just as easy to do a traditional pie-the Cooks Illustrated recipe in "The Best Recipe" is by far the best I've had. This was fairly one-dimensional in flavor, and I found it to be too sweet.

Thank you, cook on 8/19. I did scroll, but must have missed the ingredients for the cream cheese mixture! The egg white on the hot, baked crust forms a seal, so the juices from the berries don't make it quite as soggy. I've used the technique before, but honestly don't know how much difference it makes. Obviously, the cream cheese would also work, and taste much better!

Also coated the bottom crust of a pre-made graham cracker crust with the sour cream-white chocolate-cream cheese mixture suggested by a reviewer from Mankato, Minn.. This was really great as its sweet crunchy taste perfectly offset the tartness of the berries. No topping for the pie was then needed. I would rate the pie 3 forks as written, but 4 forks with the changes.

LOOK NO FURTHER!!!! This is the only blueberry pie recipe on my menu, blow your mind blueberry flavour, great texture, i added some lemon rind and a touch more cornstarch. tonight i am serving it without a crust and a scoop of gelato. yum!

This pie is so delicious. I used a frozen prepared pie crust, baked according to directions on the pkg. I added a tad more sugar and cornstarch to the 1 cup of berries that were cooked. Because my berries were large I felt more cornstarch was needed to gel the juice. Make it early in the day and let it sit on the counter until serving and it should be perfect. Mine was!

I loved this recipe. The filling took just minutes to prepare and it held together beautifully. I loved the fresh blueberry taste. The leftovers were delicious cold the next day. I made the crust recipe that goes with the recipe. It was terrific but time consuming. I expect that with practice it will become much faster to prepare.

I followed the recipe exactly, and somehow the pie came out very runny... the amount of time for cooking the crust seemed too long as it was a bit overcooked, and I had to add alluminum foil to the edges for the last 5 min. The end product was mush, and I am not an unexperienced cook. The taste is good, and I like the freshness of the berries, but will not waste my time with making this again. I will ask my fiance's grandma for her recipe, which is much better.

This is my favorite pie. It tastes fresh and light and is amazingly good!

Really great, not overly sweet. I used a prepared crust in a tart pan. Also used part sugar, part splenda. Looked great and tasted better! Can't wait to make it again.

I couldn't believe how easy this was! I cheated & used a pre-prepared crust - but other than that I wouldn't change a thing to this recipe!

The fresh, whole blueberries in the filling were wonderful. I used Splenda and a prepared whole wheat crust to make it more "South Beach friendly", and it was delish!

absolutely delicious way to do blueberries, not completely cooking the blueberries preserved the freshness which was totally welcome. I used the filling on a custard tart instead and it went fast! I also recommend the mascarpone cheesecake tart, peach jam and blueberry topping.

I made this pie with the basic flaky pie crust recipe and it was marvelous. It is the first time I was able to make a pie crust that not only looks pretty but tastes good too. Both my husband and I think it's the best blueberry pie we've ever had (the crust so fluffy and the berries so plump). The two of us finished the whole pie all by ourselves. Definitely worth the extra effort with the crust and next time I am going to make two at a time. Follow the recipe exactly and you won't be disappointed.

I've made this pie several times and it always gets raves. My husband will finish off 3/4's of the pie in one sitting (I get the other quarter).

I'm afraid I have to differ with most of the other reviewers. I made the recipe exactly as written -- with THE most delicious, plump blueberries -- but the pie just didn't live up to my expectations and my family was not impressed.

Based on everyone's rave reviews I made this for July 4th along with the Glazed Strawberry Pie - nice red, white and blue! It disappeared from the dessert table in minutes. It stayed firm when cut (unlike the strawberry pie) and was easy to serve. I used a Martha Stewart piecrust recipe but I will try this crust when I have more time. I used a ceramic pie dish that was a little too deep for the filling so it really needed the whipped cream piped on top to make it look finished. Very flavorful and everybody loved it.

Stupendous. I'm not the biggest blueberry pie fan (I made this for a dinner w/ several blueberry pie lovers), but I thought this was absolutely fantastic, as did everyone else. It actually tasted like BLUEBERRIES as opposed to the gummy, blobby, cloyingly sweet mess most blueberry pies are. I used a diff't pie crust recipe, but once that was baked, this pie was a snap to make. I topped each slice w/ some lemon cream: beat appox 1c heavy cream w/ 1-2T sugar and the juice from 1/2 lemon or so (although I gave another extra squeeze from the other half) to soft-to-semistiff peaks. Now THAT made the pie killer!

I have made dozens of pies, and you can end your search for blueberry pie here. This is the best and I've made it many, many times. If you need a variation for fun, try beating 3 oz. white chocolate, melted, a T. of sour cream, and a few ounces of cream cheese, and spread on the bottom crust before you put the berries in.

Absolutely fabulous blueberry pie. i did not make this pie crust but the filling was the best i have ever had. it had a surprising freshness to it because most of the blueberries are left whole. i am a very serious home cook that entertains weekly and tends to never use the same recipe twice because i'm always looking for something better. i can assure you that i will never use another recipe for blueberry pie. now, if i could just find an apple pie recipe that is as good as this blueberry pie, i'd be all set!

I've been looking for a good blueberry pie recipe for quite some time. I decided to try this and used my own pie crust recipe. It was delicious (we had it with whipped cream)! I served it at a family get together and they loved it. I have made it twice already and will definitely make it again.

This is a fantastic blueberry pie recipe. We have huge, plump, and ripe blueberries in season right now, and this is a fantastic way to enjoy them. A must try.

This is definitely the best blueberry pie--not overly sweet or gloppy. As one of the other reviewers said, it could also be prepared sans pieshell and served as a parfait.

Excellent pie. I have been asked for the recipe evertime I serve it, even from people who don't normally like pies. Works great with all blueberries or mixing with about 25% raspberries. I put a crumb topping on (from the apple-cranberry crumb pie recipe) that makes it exquisite.

Before this , I didn't understand the point of blueberry pies. Now I get it! I find it tastes best with about half the sugar and lately I've been skipping the pastry entirely, spooning the blueberries into goblets and serving with a little whipped cream. This will also be my new cheesecake topping.

It was terrific. Much better than baking all the berries. I used a prepared pie crust.

Blueberries were on sale, wondered what to do with the three pints I bought. This recipe was the best, tastes fresh, used a graham cracker crust, and (horrors) fat free cool whip, but it was wonderful and low fat too. My son said put this at the top of the list, he even wants the recipe!

Followed Cook from Brooklyn's advice on 5/13/03 and used mostly blueberries with rasperries and blackberries - YUMMY! Topped with Sweetened Whipped Cream (yes, I needed a recipe for that) and it was perfect :)

Wow!! What a delicious pie. I actually made this in the winter with frozen berries and it was awful. I decided to give it another try, this time following the recipe. Am I glad I did! Perfect pie - gorgeous and delicious. Definitely one to make over and over again. BTW, I too found the whipped cream superfluous - to my mind, it just detracted from the blueberry taste.

This is the best Blueberry pie I ever had. I love that you actually taste whole blueberries not just mush. I made a shortbread crust which was just wonderful with the blueberries. I followed what other cooks said and just cook the additional 3 cups of berries for 30 seconds. This is a keeper

WOW! I have made dozens of recipes on this site, but this is one of the best. A breeze to make and delicious. I already made two this past weekend.

This is an excellent summer pie. I used a purchased crust which cut down on the prep time and the results were wonderful. On a hot day it's great not to have the oven on for an hour or so to produce a delicious, fresh, berry pie. I made it for Father's Day and it pleased everyone from adults to my eight year old who had three pieces! Will also try it with a mixture of berries as others have suggested.

I have to add something to the review I wrote (below) over a year ago. I now make this pie with 2-3 cups of blueberries, 3-4 cups of raspberries and 1 cup of blackberries. The results literally make people go hysterical with appreciation and the pie is spectacular looking. I find I need 6-7 cups of berries, not 4 cups, or my pie crust doesn't fill up. (The following is what I wrote a year ago...) Excellent recipe, simple to make. The instructions were great but I found I needed to simmer the blueberries longer, and my crust came out a bit too well done; I will bake it for 5-8 minutes less next time. We didn't have whipped cream and I am not sure I'd need it with this the pie is so good, and I am a whipped cream addict. Also, I add four teaspoons of lemon juice instead of two. I will be making this forever.

Fantastic! I subtituted creme de cassis for water & cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup. Cooked for close to 2 minutes to get the berries closer to baked texture. Just tried it with peaches & peach schnapps, cooked for 1 minute also great.

This is the blueberry pie I have always wanted to eat. I used a bought pie crust, but apart from that followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect! (and really quick, without making the crust) Fabulous, fabulous. I'm going to try it with fresh peaches too and see how that is.

I have never tasted a more wonderful blueberry pie. I have already made it twice. I don't like making pie crust so I purchased a deep-dish pie dough container at the store and followed instructions. I suggest that you don't mix the corn starch and water together until you are ready to add it to the glaze or it will curdle.

Finally - a non-gelatinous blueberry pie filling! I took the other reviewers' advice and did cook the whole berries for 30 seconds or so. The pie looked and tasted delicious. I admit to using a frozen crust to save time, and I'll have to be more careful to dissolve the cornstarch - I had a few cornstarch "blobs" in the pie. Still a smash hit.

I needed a quick and easy desert to bring to a bbq so I made the filling a put it in little individual filo dough pastry cups and it was attractive and yummy! So easy and fast too. fresh blueberries made all the difference.

This pie was just OK, especially considering how labor intensive the crust is. I would definitely follow the advice to cook the berries a bit if I had another go at it, but I would probably not make this pie again.

This has to be the best blueberry pie recipe I've ever found. I've made it several times and everyone loves it.

I will definitely make this again but my plan is to let the later added blueberries cook for about 30 seconds. Maybe my berries weren't as good as some of the other cooks but I thought mine might have been better with just a little heat. Delicious nonetheless, and gets better as it sits. Yum!

So delicious I daydreamed about it for days after (my guests loved it also). I used an oreo cookie-crumb crumb crust (crushed oreos, butter an melted chocolate) instead of the crust in the recipe. Of course the freshness and sweetness of the berries makes a big difference; I made it again with a batch of berries that were not quite as flavorful and while still very tasty it didn't evoke the same raptures. Very easy and quick to make.

Delicious and it's nice to not have to bake the pie in mid-summer. I used a crust of oatmeal and coconut with a few almonds. Very nice flavor blend with the blueberries and a lot less fat than a regular crust.

I made this last summer and everyone thought it was great. It was very quick and easy too. I'll definietly make it again this year.
