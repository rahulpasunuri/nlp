Excellent. Hard to say whether the pureed version or the chunky one is better. The puree is very tasty and has some chewiness if your use an immersion blender. It would be great for someone on a low sodium diet. Once the vegetables are blended, there is so much flavor that salt is irrelevant. But the chunky version (just a cup or two of the soup pureed) preserves the great mouthfeel of the French green lentils--they almost pop. I did add a smidge of tomato paste and extra vegetable stock to both versions .Haven't tried to add vinegar yet. This will be a new staple for our family--what a way to eat your vegetable!

Delicious! I stirred in some dried marjoram at the end. Served with arugula, apple, and parmesan salad with soy sauce dressing; pickled beets; and Dijon devilled eggs.

I often use store bought "brown" lentils for the green lentils. I adjust the liquid as necessary but I do that regardless. This recipe, as well as the curried lentil soup on this site (fabulous), are both great with the regular brown lentils.

I wanted a more rustic soup, so I skipped the puree. Since my freind can't eat onions, I substituted Anise for them. I also used 3 tsp "Better Than Bullion" to 4 cups of water instead of stock, and put 3 cloves of garlic rather than 2. It was positively delicious. Even better the next day. This soup and some French Bread is perfect for an early Winter dinner.

And to the cook who asked if there's a difference in what kind of lentils you use... the answer is yes. The French green lentils are smaller, firmer, and don't soak up as much of the broth as your garden variety "grocery store" lentils. Which are likely to be brown lentils. I find them to be a bit mushier and milder in flavor and soak up alll of the broth necessitating the blending for texture.

Rating: 4
This is probably one of the most flexible recipes for lentil soup as I've found. You can make it as is and it is wonderful and hardy or you can play with it. The best variation I've found so far is to make mushroom stock (dried "fancy" mushrooms, leek, onion, carrot, celery, herbs de provence) for the broth, use fire-roasted tomatoes for a smoky flavor, and then add diced black forest ham in large chunks while the soup simmers for about 30 minutes. Exquisite.

I made a modified CURRY version of this soup that is FANTASTIC! I used grocery store lentils, but used 1/4 cup of dried yellow peas because I didn't have enough lentils. Used chopped fresh tomatoes instead of canned. First I carmelized the onions, then I added the rest of the veggies for an addition 15 mintues on low. Then I added 1/2 CUP OF VERMOUTH and let the alcohol boil out. Then I added 4 cups of water and a Rapunzel vegan bouillion cube and cooked for the stated 35 minutes. I blended part of the soup, as stated in the recipe, then added 1 Tablespoon of curry powder, salt and pepper. It's savory and wonderfully pleasant for a fall day. I will definitely re-use my modified recipe.

Love this soup. I used Ro-tel tomatoes and added some chicken broth and thyme.

I love this soup, but only with amendments. As is, it truly is bland. For the most amazing flavor, you only need to change the recipe a little, but do use bacon, and some simple spices, like dried thyme. At the end, some chopped parsley. I love the thicked, but not completely pureed texture I get by wizzing it a bit with my immersion blender. I've never used real French lentils.... Just the supermarket kind - so maybe there's a difference?

This is fantastically easy and delicious. I added bacon (1/2 lb., 1/2 inch dice) and cooked til crisp; removed w/ slotted spoon; removed most of the bacon grease & replaced w/ olive oil & then added veggies to brown. I finely chopped all the veggies in a food procesor - huge timesaver! Finally, I doubled the recipe (except used 6 cloves garlic), plus some thyme & oregano, used only 1 can of diced tomatoes + 3 tbsp. tomato paste, and added about 1/4 C. finely chopped parsley & reserved bacon near the end of simmering. Soooo good.

Love this soup. It turns out really well. There is no need to blend it if you prefer more of a stew consistency (plus, less tools to deal with and clean). I added a teaspoon of cumin and thyme. I also upped the garlic. And chopped up kale, too. Perfect and healthy!

Rating: 4
I love this soup and so has everyone I've ever made it for or recommended it to. Yes, it is a basic recipe, but comforting and hearty. Cooking the onions until near caramelization and using a good vegetable stock are key. The only change I really make is more garlic and sometimes I add a bit of thyme. By the way, regarding the question of what kind of lentil to use--I use French Lentils (the teeny green-black ones). I always assumed the name answered the question of what kind to use! I never thought it could be French Lentil Soup as in the country! Anyway, that may be why some folks find it bland. If you aren't using French lentils, which hold their shape and have a delicious flavor, the soup will be very different.

Rating: 3
This is the basis for a very tasty hearty soup, but is a bit bland as is. That's not surprising when you consider that no seasonings are specified. I ended up throwing in a bit of basil pesto that I had in the fridge, and then also added a touch of Sriracha to liven in a bit. But once again, it's a basic recipe that is easy to tailor.

Rating: 4
Great basic recipe! I did not have everything called for in terms of the vegetables - no tomatoes, and not enough carrots to equal 1 cup. It still turned out fantastic. I added more garlic, and 2 splashes of balsamic vinegar. I pureed (lightly) most of the soup, as I prefer it that way.

I used baby carrots, real tomatoes, and left out the celery since I didn't have any on hand. I also did not puree in the blender--it was great chunky!

It is bizarre that the recipe does not specify what type of lentil to use. Yellow? Green? Red? It's called "French lentil soup" so I used Du Puys. I'd say that that wasn't a good choice. For one thing, it was a waste of a good lentil. Du puy lentils are so easy to make delicious, and this recipe is sort of yucky. It's too sweet because of all the onions, carrots and tomatoes. The large amount of vegetables wipe out the taste of the lentils. Plus, it's blah. I tried spicing it up as other reviewers suggest, but the sweetness from the vegetables just wrecks it. Great disappointment.

Rating: 4
This is a surprisingly hearty, flavorful soup. As with any recipe, it will be improved by tweaks that suit the taste of the cook, and the best ingredients you can get your hands on. The only additions I would suggest are a little something from the pig (bacon or a good sausage), paprika and a little cumin.

I found this four years ago and have been making it exactly as the recipe states ever since, and I think it is perfect. I don't think it needs spice because it isn't bland - the lack of spice allows the flavours and textures of each individual ingredient to emerge without the greasiness of meat or extra salt. I use fresh tomatoes from my garden and don't add salt or pepper and this is phenomenal.

For those that found this a little bland, it may be the vegetable stock. I use Penzey's Ham stock, which gives it a nice flavor. I also use Penzey's smoked spanish paprika, I add about a tablespoon while sauteeing the vegetables. I skip the balsamic vinegar altogether and don't miss it. And of course, the immersion blender makes it very easy.

This was my first time making lentil soup and I was very pleased with the result. I made it twice actually over the course of a couple of weeks and it cam out better the 2nd time. I love that it is healthy and as someone who eats a lot of raw food it is a great addition to my diet!

Enjoyed this soup, but, found it a bit bland. I added parsnips, which added a nice flavor. I definitely recommend using Sherry vinegar rather than Balsamic. It just seems like a better pairing to me. Another suggestion for the prep phase....use a handheld blender, if you have one. Its so much more efficient!

I found this recipe to be a good foundation for a lentil soup. I thought the original recipe was bland so to enhance it I added a few ingredients. I fried some sausage adding Italian seasoning then once thoroughly cooked I added this to the rest of the mixture, along with long grain rice. I also used cayenne pepper and garlic salt to give it a spice factor. After a few twirks it was a fabulous meal!!!!

I made this on a cold rainy day. WOW! This soup is hearty, simple to make, and very flavorful. I made some small substitutions based on other reviews: (1) used Kitchen Basics chicken stock (not veggie broth); (2) added fresh chopped Thyme leaves; (3) used S&W chopped tomatoes in juice with Oregano, Basil and Garlic; and (4) added 1/4 tsp of smoked paprika. I didnt need to blend my soup --- I like it hearty (chunky)and it was thick enough without blending. Delicious! Im with the other reviewer and believe that a quality stock makes the all difference in cooking. BTW  I used to purchase Amys Organic Lentil Soup  but those days are over. This recipe is a keeper (no more Amy's).

I chose this recipe because I was searching for a "French" lentil soup, not any lentil soup. So I'm surprised by some of the additions suggested by other reviewers. French lentil soup is classic peasant food, simply prepared with quality ingredients. This recipe comes very close to what I was looking for. For those that suggest adding bay leaf, I'm not sure what that does (the debate on bay is quite extensive, and be sure you are using the true culinary species, not California bay). A French lentil soup would characteristically use thyme for seasoning, so I did add that, and since I'm not vegetarian, I used chicken stock rather than vegetable (not sure how the French would feel about that, but it does add considerably to the flavor). Finally, instead of balsamic vinegar, I used the traditional apple cider vinegar--just two teaspoons for a hint of vinegar. In the end, the soup I made was just a little thicker than what I had in mind.

Rating: 3
This was a great meal...took other's advise and added lots of seasoning and spice, which I think made the difference. I added red wine, salt/pepper, paprika, bay leaves and old bay. We got a meal plus a few lunches. I served it with a spinach salad, baquette and a great soft cheese.

I don't understand how this recipe has 4 forks. It was just 'meh'. I added extra carrots (1.5 cups instead of 1), some red pepper flakes, cumin, smoked paprika, a fresh bay leaf and herbes de provence. It was still just ok.

Rating: 2
This was somewhat of a disappointment. While I think it's a good START to lentil soup, despite quality ingredients, it's just not that tasty. In looking over previous comments, I think reviewers gave four forks on their final products: with bay leaves, more carrots, spices, etc. Good starting point for measurements of lentils, stock, etc. but use it as a jumping-off point -- don't expect it to be a four-fork dinner as-is.

So easy to make and delicious! Made with red lentils and added some of the celery leaves as well as a few chopped cilantro leaves after the soup was done simmering. The cilantro goes really well with the lentils. One other thing I learned from my grandma about cooking soup with carrots is after you saute the onion \ garlic in oil, you add the carrots and celery WITH A BIT of water - just enough to cover them - in order to really get the orange color of the carrot.

delicious! the best soup i've ever had. i added the bay leaf, cumin, and paprika, didn't use celery (upped carrots instead), and used better than bouillon (1 tsp chicken and 3 tsp veg versions) plus water, in addition to both green lentils and French browns. garnished with fresh Italian parsley instead of celery leaves. absolutely delicious and didn't need the balsamic, in my opinion.

Very easy. I followed the other reviews added a bay leaf, paprika and cumin, this is a must! Also used 1/4 cup of broth at the end to thin out the consistency, as it was a bit thick for my liking.

I love cooking with green lentils. It's almost therapeutic sorting and rinsing them and checking for stones. So I don't mind the only part of the preparation of this dish that takes any time. The results are worth it: a fragrant dish of healthful food. You don't have to puree any part of this dish if you prefer the texture of the whole lentil, as my taste tasters do. We also like it thick, almost like a stew or a vegetable side dish, so I don't usually add any extra liquid. But this is a dish that a cook can play with. I was just recovering from a cold and still feeling the need for comfort, so substituted chicken broth. That may be what contributed the full flavor my tasters described. Next time, I'll try the Vegie broth.

Good basic lentil soup recipe. Don`t forget the vinegar. I added a potato cut in small dice, and I always add bacon to lentil soup (fried some up in pieces, took out most of the fat and proceeded with the onion, etc.) Used about 3/4 cup dried lentils and had to use significantly more liquid. The recipe made 4 hearty main course servings; I`m sorry not to have had any left over to freeze. Next time.

If you like lentil soup, this is the perfect, simple version of it. The vinegar takes it from good to great, so do add it. The only modification I made was to add 1 tablespoon of herbs de provence (when i added the lentils) and a bay leaf. The recipe doesn't remind you to season the dish, which should be done at the end.

i'm embarrassed to say i'd never cooked with lentils before.. what was i thinking? this soup is wonderful, though i did take the opportunity to break out a new tin of smoky spanish paprika, and used a bit of allspice as well. it may be because i've gotten into the habit of starting soups with a homemade chicken stock, but in looking at the ingredients list, i felt i needed to provide a little bit more depth... plus, isn't it just more fun fiddling around a little? long story short, this is wonderful. comforting, homey and delicious. for those of us trying to watch calories and carbs before the holidays go into full swing, this is a god send. beautiful, healthy, satisfying food. after the holidays when i don't care, i'm going to sprinkle it liberally with good parmesan.:) thank you for sharing this recipe!

A decent base recipe, but needs a lot of doctoring to make truly tasty. Like others I added bay leaf, thyme, and a dash of worchestershire.

Also chopped up two "rashers," or slices of bacon, and sautéed them with some of the onion, garlic and spices while the rest of the vegetables cooked.

This is a great recipe to start from but if you want something really delicious, I agree, caramelize your onions w/some balsamic vinegar and red wine. Your base will be extremely flavorful. Then I added red pepper along with the thyme and bay leaf, as suggested. I did puree two cups of soup, which does add more than you can initially guess. Other addition, which I recommend for anyone who loves flavor enhancers, AA Borsari original seasoned salt. I use this for tons of things (my meats and t-giving stuffing owe a lot to this) but it really does a miraculous thing for soups.

Delicious and highly recommended!!! We served with a small green side salad and Pillsbury Grands Jr. biscuits as I forgot to buy french bread. Very filling!

This was excellent, solid-feeling fare. I heeded the advice from others to use chicken stock and add a bay leaf and it was superb, especially on a winter evening. Next time I will add the garlic, cumin and thyme referenced by the 1/16/10 reviewer from Cape Elizabeth, Maine (the place of my mother's youth!). Maybe also some harissa. I didn't add these things this time because I want my kids to try it. Maybe also some pancetta to start with next time? This was very, very good.

This is without question, one of my top-two soup recipes now. I followed the advice to use chix stock and to add cumin, thyme, bay leaves and worchestershire sauce. I also added 4x the amount of garlic and it was completely perfect and not too garlicky. I tested the soup before adding balsamic vinegar and it was just too perfect to alter, though I did try it with a splash into a bowl. For me it was better without the vinegar. Will make this for friends and family for years and years to come.

Like others, I made a couple tweaks, but in all thought this was a great base recipe for lentil soup. I used veggie broth instead of water, and added two fresh bay leafs, and a generous amount of fresh thyme in tandem with the lentils. I then simmered it for an hour to really let the soup thicken. It was delicious, and like all soups better the next day. If you don't have a blender, no biggie either.

Considering that this is just lentil soup, it tastes pretty spectacular. The caveat is that I used ultra-ripe heirloom tomatoes instead of canned, and I threw in one of the 603 crookneck squash lying on my kitchen counter (anybody want some end-of-summer squash?) along with the lentils and tomatoes.

I really liked this recipe. The only thing I did differently was add a bay leaf as others suggested. I also did add maybe 1/2 cup water to thin it out a bit (since I was out of broth). Very tasty. Only needs about a teaspoon or so of balsamic for the pot, don't add too much!

If you look over the positive reviews for this recipe, many of them added several ingredients that were not in the recipe. I understand why, as this is one of the blandest things I have ever tasted. Having not added any sort of herb or savory meat beforehand, I had to salt and pepper like crazy in order to make it the least bit interesting.

it was my first time making/tasting lentil soup. i was a little skeptical with such simple ingredients and so i was very pleasantly surprised with the end result! taking the advice of other reviewers, i put in a bay leaf and just a dash of dried thyme. i also happened to have a slice of pancetta, so i chopped it up and sauteed it with the vegetables. other than that, i followed the recipe to a T and ended up with a really delicious and healthy soup! definitely will make it again, if not sooner rather than later...

Wonderful with puys or Italian lentils from Abruzzo. A trick to non-mushy lentils--sweat for 10 minutes in salt. My family thought the dish was improved by draining the tomatoes, and adding two bay leaves, no-salt chicken broth, and 2 slices of bacon, cooked and crumbled. But they went wild when, having no bacon, I used a leftover Maple Breakfast Link. Lovely sweet undertone.

Made a double batch of the lentil soup and was very pleased with the outcome. I needed to add additional chicken broth as the lentils really soaked up the stock however the flavor was fantastic. I served it with freshly grated regiano parmigiano cheese on the top which really brought out the earthy flavor of the lentils.

I first made this recipe about half a year ago and I've been making it about once a month since. It's part of my resolution to eat less meat by dedicating one day a week to being a vegetarian. I usually end up using much more than 4 cups of homemade vegetable broth (usually about 6-7 cups). I like my soup to have more liquid. I also use half green (puy) lentils and half red lentils, I substitute two fresh tomatoes for the canned tomatoes, and I add a bay leaf to the soup while its simmering. I always blend 2 cups of the solids because it makes the texture of the soup really great. I also add just a bit of balsamic vinegar to the soup as soon as it's off the stove. It's not the prettiest soup, but it's so comforting, filling, and not difficult to make at all.

I added: 1 lb of black beans, 1 lb of cranberry bean, cumin, cayenne pepper, chipotle chile pepper ( a goodly amount of each), 6 oz of tomato paste (I think this really added a lot of taste) and a red pepper. I and my friends couldn't believe how good this tasted!!!!

Made it last night for dinner. Everyone raved. It was a little dry at the 25 minute mark when simmering. So I added an additional full cup of water--for a total of 5 cups broth/liquid. I put in two handfuls of greens--thinly sliced beet greens--along with the lentils and tomatoes. Do puree the two cups of solids--makes the texture just right--a hearty soup, not a stew.

This is a case of very humble ingredients combining into something much more than their individual parts. I used tiny French Lentils but otherwise followed the recipe. My husband came up with an inspired topping, however. I had made a brussel sprout side dish by carmelizing a leek in olive oil, adding shredded brussels sprouts until crisp tender, seasoning with salt and pepper, adding a handful of pinenuts and squeezing a half lemon over it after removing from the heat. As a topping to the soup, this added great taste and textural notes.

One of the best lentil soups I've made! I, too, caramelized the onions and used some roasted garlic I had on hand. Pureed slightly with an infusion blender. The vinegar is a wonderful touch. Simple to make and great served with homemade bread and a salad. I will definitely be serving this for lunches at Harrison House B&B!

Rating: 3
I would give it 4 forks but I did alter the recipe SLIGHTLY; like one other reviewer I also caramelized the onions (how could that hurt?!), at the end I added 0.25 cups of orzo and let it cook in the soup, a spot of cream and some diced firm tofu. It was excellent, hearty and healthy. I agree with others that the basalmic vinegar is the crowning touch. The caramelized onions and bit of cream was a good vegetarian sub in for bacon or prosciutto (both of which would be welcomed additions in this recipe!) 4 forks with the additions!!!!!

Rating: 3
It's really better than a 3, but I'm not quite ready to give it a 4. This soup is rich and layered in both taste and texture. I might puree more of the soup in the future, to give it more of a silky depth. I left out the tomatoes, regretfully, for someone's food allergies, but made sure I added the balsamic vinegar so that there'd be a little bite. I used a chicken broth I'd made the night before.

Rating: 2
Most of the raves for this soup seem to have come from those who modified it. I made it exactly as written, including the Balsamic vinegar (1 TBS) and found it just ok. There's nothing wrong with it...it's just that it's not anything special. Yes, it's quick and easy and that's worth something...but not 4 forks.

Rating: 3
I made this soup and it turned out well. I added the optional vinegar, which was better than without, though be careful not to add too much! I also added reduced fat kielbasa with the other vegetables, and I added 2 handfuls of chopped collard greens when I added the broth and lentils. It turned out well with these additions. The soup tasted better the next day.

I normally don't review recipes unless I made them exactly as written, but thought I would share the lazy, easy way that I made this. I dumped all ingredients except the vinegar into my slow cooker and let it go for 5-6 hours on high. (I also added a bay leaf during cooking) I used my submersion blender to partially blend right in the slow cooker, then added the splash of vinegar just before serving. Could not be easier, and far healthier than most slow cooker recipes. Again, I can't really compare to the original, but for anyone looking for an easy, easy dinner, it's a good one.

Rating: 4
This was easy to prepare and delicious to share. Healthful, interesting and simple - a great slow cooker for a cold day. I plan to make it with vegetable stock next time when I have vegetarian family members over - I hope it is as tasty as it is with the chicken stock.

Rating: 4
I agree with Daren from San Francisco. It helps to cook the onions longer before adding the rest of the ingredients, and then to cook the whole soup for much longer than the recipe calls for. (Although I don't simmer it as long as Daren.) And yes, the vinegar makes all the difference. My family loves this.

Rating: 4
I've made this soup several times now and it never fails to satisfy. Last time was for our annual Autumn potluck at work where it vanished quickly. The only changes I've made is caramelizing the onions first and when almost done adding the garlic, celery and carrots. Then simmer it for about 2 hours and just before serving using a potato masher to thicken up the soup. The vinegar is A MUST!

Rating: 4
Easy, delicious, healthy, and perfect for a weeknight, what more could you want in a meal (or a man). Anyway....I used 2 TB olive oil and less carrots (what I had) and added green onions. It really acheived greatness with the drizzle of a 10-year balsamic and those sprightly celery leaves. YUM! Great with crusty bread and dark beer!

Rating: 3
To add more flavor, I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, and added 2 strips of bacon. I added the optional tablespoons of good balsamic vinegar and it came out great. I'd give it 2-3 forks as-is, but 4 forks with the changes. Tastes better the next day.

This is a fairly easy recipe; however, I concur with some others that it was just okay. It was very thick and I had to keep adding broth. Otherwise it would have been like mud. It was certainly hearty but I think I will try some other lentil recipes.

This was the first time I have ever used lentils. My husband loves this lentil soup that they serve at our favorite Italian restaurant so I thought I would try it at home. I added a pound of extra-spicy Italian sausage and substituted chicken broth for the vegetable. With these modifications the soup was fantastic. I think it may have been a little bland otherwise. It also doesn't look very pretty, but I suppose that's what you get with lentils. I will definitely make this again!

What a great recipe for lentils. I doubled the garlic, used chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth, and added about 2 teaspoons of Penzeys Adobo seasoning.

My husband loves it when I make this dish. I always make a double recipe and freeze half of it. It is cheap, easy, and good for you. I make it as written except I use half red and half green lentils (I agree that all green lentils give it an unappetizing color) and I don't bother to puree it, I just cook the hell out of the lentils. I don't find it lacking in flavor at all, although once in awhile I will add some curry spice for something different.

I have never reviewed a recipe before but don't know how this recieved four forks.

I don't understand some reviews stating this was lacking in flavor. I thought it was wonderful! I tasted it prior to adding the balsamic vinegar and it was so-so. The vingear is an absolute must.

This is a delicious soup. I'd definitely serve it to guests. I followed the modifications by BobrRob from Palatine, IL "I made a double batch with some modifications. 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil - 4 cups chopped onions - 2 cups chopped celery stalks - 2 cups chopped carrots - 4 garlic cloves, chopped - 8 cups (4 cans) Swanson Chicken Broth 99% Fat Free - 2 cups lentils, rinsed, drained. Thats 2 cups BEFORE you rinse them - 2 14 1/2ounce can Stewed Tomatoes with Oregano and Basil Pureed - ½ tsp Thyme Leaves - ½ tsp Parsley Flakes - ½ tsp Oregano Leaves - ½ tsp Marjoram Leaves - ½ tsp Tarragon - ½ tsp Sage - ½ tsp Crushed Rosemary - ½ tsp Ground Sea Salt - ½ tsp Ground Pepper - 1 ½ Tbsp Balsamic Vinegar. - Preparation. Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and all the seasonings, except the pepper. Saute garlic until it starts to break down, then add onions, celery, carrots; sauté until vegetables begin to brown, about 25 minutes. Add broth, lentils, and pureed tomatoes with juice and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until lentils are tender, about 35 minutes. Add pepper. Use a blending stick, on high, 5 passes top to bottom. Came out great."

This was my first time tasting lentils, nevermind making lentil soup. It was delicious! I added 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp thyme, and 1/2 tsp rosemary to the mix. I also used 4 cups chicken broth & 2 1/2 cups water. The soup had plenty of flavour, and it had the ideal thickness (looked like the photo). This soup becomes a hearty stew if you add brown rice, potatoes, and anything else you can throw in after. Very nutricious! I definitely recommend it.

Although I am an avid home cook, I've never made lentils before. This was easy, filling and delicious.

Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe! I find this very exciting to see so many comments on this recipe. I read through most of them before I finished my soup. I actually found your recipe by a google search. I just finished making a triple batch of it in which I used spinich and tomatos in the blender first in stead of a couple cups puree later. I really like it. I also never thought a 1/4 squeezed lemon would do so much to improve the flavor of a serving! Now I got enough soup to last a month since I eat this all the time.

this recipe was quick, delicous and hearty. I added zuchinni and diced mushrooms. I also only pureed about half so the soup would be chunkier and you could taste the vegies induvidually.

Instead of the diced tomatoes, I used 3 Tbsp. of tomato paste with 1 cup of water. I don't like pureed soup, so instead I cooked the lentils for about an hour until they were very soft. This made a thick soup which I served over cooked long grain rice. We all thought it was delicious. The balsamic vinegar is necessary. (A little lemon juice would work also.) I've made this soup also with a couple of browned, sliced, Italian turkey sausage links added and served over rice with cornbread on the side. It was a big hit.

Went exactly by the recipe for cooking and serving. The four of us tried to eat it, then we dumped it into the garbage disposal.

Delicious, easy and fast. What more could you ask for in a soup recipe? We used vegetable bouillon cubes and water in place of broth. Ended up adding about 2 extra cups of water, and the soup was still nice and thick.

I have already made this dish twice, it's just that good! I purée it with an immersion blender, it works very well that way. The tomato/lentil combo is very yummy, perfect for a winter day.

This could not have been a more exact match for what I was hoping for in the perfect lentil soup! I made as is--no alterations, except a little bit less oil than asked for. Also, after a couple days in a row of the soup, I added some parmesean cheese and a dab of truffle oil in each bowl to give it a different depth...it was great too! Will make the recipe Many, Many, Many times to come!

Awesome soup! Especially considering how few ingredients are listed. This seemed like magic!

This lentil soup is wonderful (and who would think....good for you too probably) I used the orange lentils that I bought in bulk form from Whole Foods and Trader Joe's Organic Vegitable broth,my family loved it. This one is surly a keeper.

I have several lentil soup recipes but when I made this yesterday , it became my instant favorite. I was fortunate enough to still have a supply of French green lentils and I do agree they have a much richer flavor than regular. The only change I made was not to bother removing 2 cups to a blender, I just used my stick blender right in the pot to puree part of the mixture. This one is a definite keeper and I do love soup.

This turned out very well - despite the fact that my can of diced tomatoes contained only juice and no diced tomatoes!! I boiled a potato and put it in the soup to thicken it due to lack of tomato. I also pureed it all in a Cuisinart as I dont like soup with lumps of stuff in. I used brown lentils and it turned out great but I will try with French Green Lentils another time. I froze it in batches in my freezer. I added a swirl of cream at the end as I always do with soups. Very nice.
