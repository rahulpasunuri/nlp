I agree that fresh ingredients are key. I used organic spinach which is sweeter and nuttier tasting than the twice washed spinach you can get in other packages. I also reduced the amount of oil and used regular soy sauce instead of the kind they recommend.

Fresh, in season veggies are key. I used carrot juice (all I could get from my local co-op). Instead of chopping everything I started by blending the herbs, garlic, ginger and shallots with the liquids. Once that was smooth I added everything else (spinach, scallions and avocado) and pulsed in texture. It was quite good, but go light on the ginger and garlic to start.

Absolutely loved this! We don't have a juicer so I purchased carrot juice. We couldn't get enough of it. My husband dislikes most soups, especially cold ones. He took the leftovers of this to work!

This is a perfect Summer soup.

This looked interesting, but the result was un palatable. I used carrot juice as a previous cook suggested, but the whole was overwhelmed by the garlic. There seemed no way to rescue this - No one in the family would eat it beyond the first few bites.

Quite delicious. Very "rich" in both texture and flavor. Lots of ingredients, but I agree--don't leave any out (except maybe the escarole). Definitely not just for people with raw or vegetarian tastes.

I love this soup ! Have made it both with carrot juice and with tomato juice. I prefer the carrot juice version. If you juice your own carrots, the recipie "Carrot Soup With Spinach Chiffonade" is a perfect complement to use up the carrot pulp ( and to use up more spinach if you have a garden-ful ! ). I agree with another suggestion to reduce the garlic and jalapeno, but just-a-little. I will make this recipie again and again !

I own this book,RAW bu Juliano Brotman, and it is the best. This recipe is the one that is the easiest and fastest to make and is great everytime. The list of ingredients looks like a lot, but it is worth it. And if you leave anything out, it will be noticeable.

I made this for my un-raw family (as a raw vegan myself) and they surprised themselves by loving it! Leave out the olive oil and use 1 and 1.5 - 2 avocados instead --- and don't bother with the unpasteurized soy sauce, a little celtic sea salt is perfect. It will be just as delicious with less of the strong stuff (garlic etc. if you are a 'supertaster' like my mother!) And use the juice of an entire large lime -- I may be biased toward raw recipes but I think everyone could give it a try!
