I made this for a dinner party of about 26 adults. I doubled everything and it still was not enough. The dates were flying off the appetizer tray, as they were that good. The store was out of applewood bacon but the hickory smoked kind was just fine. We used a good Asiago cheese which really works well here. I would stick with the slightly bigger Medjool dates as recommended. The smoked paprika is a VERY nice touch here, also. I was quite liberal with it, as it adds a great smoky touch and provides great color to the bacon. I assembled them all the night before, and then popped them in the oven the next day. This makes it a great party app, since it requires no real work during a gathering.

I was happily surprised that the dates were not overpowering - dates not being a favorite ingredient of mine. I was surprised that the Asiago was completely lost, since it's mild flavor disappeared when melted. All it added was more richness, which was definitely not necessary. I would try one of the other cheeses mentioned by previous reviewers such as blue or Manchego next time.

Delicious! I used Manchego for half the batch, and one almond each for rest, both were great.

A perfect appetizer as it can be mostly assembled ahead and is completely multipliable! I served it with the Frozen Mango Margaritas on this website, what a nice combination for any time of the year. You can also make this with dried figs and Parmesan cheese.

Made these for a New Year's Eve cocktail party and everyone loved them. Even those who didn't know that they liked dates. One comment - I purchased my dates from the bulk section of our local store and purposely picked out the larger ones. When I make it again I would select smaller ones. They would have been easier to eat and the bacon would have wrapped around all the way. Other than that they were perfect.

Pretty tasty. Salty/sweet/savoury combo is nice, though at times it was a little strong. Still enjoyable, but maybe something to cut through the dates sweetness and bacon/cheese fattiness would be nice. I had mine with some prosecco which helped a little, but maybe if served with an accompanying drink/dish that was less sweet and more bubbly or more acidic the whole experience would have been more balanced. Definitely a nice combination though, just needs a little something to balance the sweetness/saltiness/savouriness.

Used blue cheese and what an amazing appetizer. Easy to do and perfect to do ahead. I havent come across one person who doesnt enjou these. I highly recommend them to all.

Unusual blend of flavors. Very rich. Can not eat too many, but great as a novel appetizer to supplement something lighter.

Wow...these were super easy and made me look like a genius in the kitchen. I used manchego. And I forgot to put the paprika on the inside of the bacon, so I just sprinkled it on top. Was still as yummy and might have made it look even better.

I made these for a party, using Manchego cheese. These were the first hors d'oeuvres to disappear...and in a hurry! This recipe is a pure winner!

Pre-soak dates overnight if dried. Manchego cheese will melt and some will run out during roasting. It's probably why harder cheese, asiago or parmesan, is suggested. Thicker bacon needs 18-20 mins. in the oven. I cut bacon slides in half, rolled up with flat end last,and left toothpicks in place (they were heavy duty and attractive) for ease of serving. Found smoked Spanish paprika at Penzey's Spices. Can order online. For neatness, if you use waterchestnuts, cut them in half before stuffing. I doubled the recipe and made half cheese, half waterchestnuts. They were all gone in short order.

Party attendees practically bowed down to me after I served these guys. Sooo delicious. I overstuff them with blue cheese - that sharper flavor cuts the sweet much better than manchego or asiago.

Cheese irrelevant? Water chestnut better! Guests loved these w/that variation. Combination of date w/smoked paprika and bacon was a winner. I made versions of this with a sweet gouda, parmesiano reggiano, jarlsberg, and gorgonzola and found in all cases that the sweetness of the date and strength of the other flavors completely overwhelmed the cheese anyway. Taking a cue from the recipe's description, I tried stuffing the dates with water chestnut for crunch and found that the added texture was quite appealing.

Very easy and tasty. The combination of sweet, salty and smokey is terrific. I used 1/2 pice of regular center cut bacon on each date and cooked for 8 minutes on each side. Not the prettiest appetizer, but would make again. Guests loved it.

Very similar to an appetizer at AOC in Los Angeles. They (and I) use a spear of fresh Parmesan instead of Asiago which cuts the sweetness just perfectly.

These are great! And easy! I've eaten several variations of this idea in restaurants as well. One stuffed the dates with Blue Cheese. Yum! Another stuffed them with Chorizo, then wrapped them in bacon. I don't want to think about clogged arteries, but OMG! Just to die for! I'll be making a batch for our pre-Thanksgiving feast this year.

These were good, but Asiago has a bit of a strong cheese flavor and I don't think it goes perfectly in the same bite with the sweet-tasting dates and bacon. I put out a plate of these for 2 guests and they only ate 3 between them. Next time I'll try plain cream cheese instead.

This is a party favourite. I ended up using Manchego, and regular bacon - it was just as tasty! They were gone in a matter of minutes...

This is quick yummy. I found that the paprika didn't make too much of a difference, but perhaps mine is too old to be very flavorful. I also used half strips of bacon so they would wrap all the way around and be secured with the toothpick - made for a MUCH prettier presentation. Also, a broiler pan is neater than a cookie sheet, although they take longer.

Very easy to make, but they look fancy despite their bizarre, bug like appearance. Not your usual chip & dip appetizer! I made these for a girl's night get together and everyone raved about them. I used Manchego cheese, which was very good, but next time, I think I will try gorgonzola to cut through the sweetness of the dates even more.

This was easy to make and a hit with my guests. I however thought the dates were a little too sweet. But overall it was a success. I would definitely make it again as an appetizer.

So good! Very similar to an app that I had at a Spanish restaurant once. I used prosciutto instead of bacon, and we found Asiago a little too much, so I used havarti to make them the next night. I can't wait have people over and make these again.

I've made these twice and got rave reviews both times! Both times I forgot to sprinkle the paprika on the bacon before rolling and, instead, had to sprinkle on top after done. Yummy!

I made these as an appetizer for Easter and everyone loved them. I used ancho chili powder instead of smoked paprika and white cheddar cheese and they were great. I wrapped them the night before and it just popped them in the oven right from the fridge and it worked out well. I didn't tell anyone they were dates for fear they wouldn't try them.

These were easy to make, delicious, and a great party food. I almost forgot the smoked paprika and that would have been a mistake. The smoked paprika was not overwhelming but gave the rumaki extra zip. I made them according to the recipe. I also made a "vegetarian" batch for my vegetarian friend. I left out the bacon and smoked paprika and only stuffed the dates with asiago cheese and then roasted them in the oven without turning. They were very good and not your typical appetizer.
