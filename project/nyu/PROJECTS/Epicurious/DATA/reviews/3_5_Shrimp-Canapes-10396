Been making this one for almost 20 years and there's still never any left. Luckily the issues it came out in had a photos and it makes animpressive presentation as well. I followed exactly, candied lime peel just doesn't seem to jive with me-even with avacado mayo, lime zest maybe....but candied?!

the recipe was great but a little to classic for me . I tweeked it with an avacado mayo and lost the dill and replaced it with a candied lime peel.
