really great and simple. You really don't need that much butter if you're trying to keep it light. Good carrots, a low fire and nonstick pan and you can use half of what's listed.

My husband said this is the only way he'll eat carrots from now on, so it's definitely a keeper.

This was simple, quick, and delicious! I added a touch of thyme, also. We served it as a side dish to vegan "Celebration Roast."

This is a simple but delicious way to prepare carrots. It's flavorful but not too spicy for unadventurous guests.

A GOOD WAY TO GET TWO VEGGIES AT ONCE.
