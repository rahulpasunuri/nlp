Unbelievably delicious. I placed mine in individual dishes with the figs at the bottom with chicken pate on top and chopped walnuts above that! People were licking their spoons!

This was my first attempt at making anything like this and it turned out great! I love that the recipe is so easy and fun to play with. The flavors were great and it really impressed my boyfriend. I will be making this for an up coming Christmas party.

Really good. Maybe it's obvious to others, but this is so rich, a little goes a long way. I don't think I had much more than two cups of it when it was done, but it was plenty. Added four strips of softly cooked bacon and a teaspoon of herbs de provence to the simmerring pan. Otherwise followed the recipe (full amount of butter etc).

Made this 2 times. Once followed to the T and then after reading all the great tweaks did as followed: 1. At least 2 Tbls of Cognac. 2. Substituted 1 stick of butter for 8 Tbls of cream cheese (texture becomes wonderfully smooth. 3. Added some fresh herbs to the liver when in . processor. 4. Used Port for the figs and doubled the amount I made of them, as you can never have enough. 5. Pecans instead of Walnuts (and not sure you even need any nuts it is so good!

Excelent balance of flavors at a very low cost. I made two versions; one with 1/4 cup Cognac an one with 2 Tbls, I prefer less cognac in order to keep balance of flavors. I substituted 1 stick of butter for 8 Tbls of cream cheese and the texture becomes velvety and the strong taste of the chicken livers is reduced without disappering. Remember the garni of herbs makes the difference, as letting it 10min in food processor.I used Marsal for the fig marmelade.

It's so easy to play around with the presentation of this dish! My favorite? Use the plastic wrap method to mold in ramekins. I cook the figs and cognac down until it's a jam. Alternate pate-fig-toasted pistachios-pate-fig-toasted pistachios. Freeze what you're not using. I make it at Thanksgiving and have plenty for throughout the holidays to use and give as hostess gifts. I've been using this recipe for years and am constantly being asked for it!

This is so easy and inexpensive to make. I add a teaspoon of chopped dried rosemary and garnish with fresh rosemary. I put it in 12 oz. ramekins so I can freeze leftovers. I've found it freezes well and is nice to have on hand. Used pecans instead of walnuts. Buy a little extra chicken livers so you can trim well. Added less salt as I didn't use unsalted butter or simmer in low sodium broth. This is always a favorite!

After reading many of the comments below, I added 3 large slices of smoked bacon cooked to medium well (not crispy). I was a bit afraid to go for the full 6 slices. I also put in a couple of sprigs of fresh thyme and gave it a few twists of the nutmeg grinder. I also added about the same of fresh ground black pepper - all went into the simmering pot. In the food processor phase, I did also decrease the butter by half (or even a bit less) and I used salt butter, not unsalted. I put in just under a 1/4 cup of really good cognac (all that happened to be in the cupboard) and a bit less than the recommend salt (remember that I used salt butter). It was not quite right to my taste so I put in somewhere around 1/2 tsp of sugar (to taste). That sugar was the final magic as it really made the flavors pop. The end result - as yet without nuts and without figs - is remarkable. It is definitely - with modifications - a keeper.

Following the comments of others, I added 6 slices of soft cooked bacon per pound of chicken livers.Gave a nod to the fresh thyme and increased the cognac to 1/4 cup; decreased the butter by half. Made one pate with the figs molded within and another on the side- both were devoured at an equal rate. As I was using figs I'd home preserved earlier in the season the port was not used though I will certainly add it next time. The plastic wrap in a bowl trick worked like a charm and made it quite simple to stud the pate w/ nuts at the last moment. This recipe will remain in my roster as a simple yet delectable beginning to all festive occasions.

I rated this three forks however with the minor changes I've made, I'd rate it four forks. I've made this several times in the past two years and received rave reviews. My changes were: I used toasted pecans instead of walnuts and poached the figs in a good port. In the food processor, I roughly chop the figs with a bit of the port.I don't have a fancy mold so I use a loaf pan. I spread half of the liver mixture into the lined loaf pan and then top that with half of the figs. Then I spead the remaining liver mixture. Once I unmold the pate, I press the rest of the chopped figs on top and press the chopped toasted pecans into the sides. The result is an impressive presentation for not very much effort and guest who taste it roll their eyes in pleasure.

really good stuff. I added some of the fig mixture to the center of the pate in addition to the top. I used 6 slices of crumbled bacon and some fresh tyme as suggested in previous reviews. I used two small mini loaf pans. The pate is very rich and a little goes a long way.

This has become my go-to recipe for liver pate. It's even fine without the walnuts, though they're nice for texture. If I don't bother with the figs, I just serve with red onion confit, cornichons, and mustard.

This recipe is absolutely tremendous. I had doubts about the texture and consistency of first cooking the meat and then pureeing in a food processor. But the technique worked. Because you will not be straining any batter through a cheesecloth, remember to assiduously pick over the livers and remove viciously any and all connective tissues. You can increase the salt a bit, and add a bit of sage and or thyme. You both sticks of butter. I decided to poach the livers at a simmer to avoid toughening the meat. And I started with about 20 ounces of livers to allow for all the unwanted connective tissue that I was going to discard. Also, you can easily increase the brandy. It is all a matter of personal preference. I used a suggestion from another reader to incorporate a couple cooked bacon strips, which I also think is a good idea. Remember, lastly, to give the processor time to break down the mixture. I processed about ten minutes with the standard knife blade.

I was having only a small party so I used a couple of smaller dishes to mold the pate, freezing one for use at Christmas. This was devoured at the first, fresh serving, but the frozen version was not appreciated as much. The recipe is wonderful and was enjoyed with the French 75 recipe on this site.

Rating: 4
Delicious and easy. My friend took some extra home and her FAMILY is bugging me for the recipe now! Following previous reviews I simmered the figs in red wine until tender then drained and chopped finely into a kind of rough jam. Used 1/2 the butter and added a tsp of thyme to the livers. Layered it in a silicon mini loaf pan for easy unmolding. Layer of pate, fig, then pate. Presents beautifully this way.

I first discovered this recipe when looking for something to do with the abundance of figs from my parent's fig tree. I have made it many, many times and people always love it. The fresh figs are great if you can get them. I recently made it with dried mission figs, and it was still very good (but not quite as good as with fresh). I also soak the liver in milk. In addition, after I soak the figs, I reduce the port (adding a tsp or so of sugar) into a syrup. Why throw it away! I then pour that back over the figs. It also makes for fun plating to drizzle around the outside of the platter. Overall, really good and so easy.

Just made this a second time, to give as a gift. This time I followed another reviewer's advice and added 6 strips of cooked, lean (uncured) bacon during the simmer, as well as fresh thyme. Used 1.5 Tb cognac. It came out so delicious I couldn't believe it. The bacon adds a richer, deeper flavor and the thyme added complexity. I still give 4 forks because I think it's great without the changes, too. But if you want a really amazing pate, I suggest adding the bacon and thyme, and still cut the butter from 2 sticks to 1. Devoured and loved by all.

I decided to have fun with this...I wanted small servings, so I put the finished product in demitasse cups and topped each with beef (yes beef, not chicken) aspic, which was a breeze (just beef broth and gelatin). Following reviewers' recommendations, I soaked the livers in milk first and cut the butter in half. I also added fresh thyme during the simmering. To my taste, however, increasing the cognac was a mistake. I put in 3 Tbs and the flavor was way too strong. Other than that...magnificent. Putting it in demitasse w/ aspic made it adorable and perfect single servings to have with bread or-- really good--Carr's (very buttery) Rosemary crackers.

This is similar to a pate recipe I've been making for years so I felt comfortable making a few modifications. I couldn't get fresh figs so I did without. I reduced butter to one stick. I didn't put in as much salt as the recipe called for, but that was a mistake. It really does need the salt to make the flavors pop. I also put in 2 or 3 tablespoons of Cognac as we love the taste and 1 just doesn't seem to be enough to notice it. I also add a pinch of nutmeg and mace, a few grinds of fresh black pepper, and a few sprinkles of thyme. We enjoyed it with confiture (as the French do) and it was just delicious! Will try it with figs another time.

Absolutely delicious. Figs complement the pate and make it a really gourmet dish. Made it for Thanksgiving dinner the other day; everybody loved it!

I'm giving this two forks because it was good, but not delicious or exceptional. I made the recipe exactly as written. I like pate, but this just didn't make me want more. My guests all said they liked it, but there was a lot leftover. The figs are very good.

This was incredibly easy to make and the results were wonderful. I made this last weekend for a meeting of our local French club. It was a huge hit! As other reviewers recommended, I first soaked the livers in milk. After poaching the figs in Madiera (I didn't have any port on hand), I chopped the drained figs. I poured half of the liver mixture into the mold and spread two-thirds of the figs on top and then finished with the second half of the liver mixture. Once unmolded, I sprinkled the rest of the figs on top and pressed toasted chopped pecans onto the sides. The presentation made this recipe a show stopper and the melding of flavors made it the talk of the soiree. This one's a keeper!

I have made this several times with excellent results. It is SO good that my friends have requested that I make it for Christmas gifts! I used two small molds and placed toasted chopped pecans between the layers. I served on a large platter with the figs on the side with purple grapes, butter lettuce and whole toasted pecans for garnish. It was an impressive display. The pate was the star of the dinner party. PS-Don't tell anyone how very easy this is!!!

EXCELLENT! I made as directed except only used 1 stick butter to control fat. It was very rich and devoured by all. The figs were a nice touch-mine were still a little tough after the soaking time so make sure they are soft when you drain the wine. I froze the leftovers and hope to have them in the near future. This is very easy and a nice presentation for a party.

Made this as an hors d'oeuvre for a NYE dinner party - it was a hit. As did other cooks, I added about 1/3 of the reconstituted figs to the pate. Used pecans instead, left them whole and only served them on the side with the figs in case anyone had allergies. It was quite an excellent, easy and impressive dish.

The secret extra ingredient to make this even better is to add about 6 strips of cooked lean bacon with the livers.

Oh, my, this is truly divine. I made the pate according to the recipe (simple), used toasted pine nuts instead of walnuts, and served with bite-sized prunes cooked in ruby port until the port was reduced to syrup. Heavenly. I will definitely make this whenever I can splurge on the calories!

Have made this several times each holiday season since it first appeared; each year more friends request I bring it to parties. One brother insists on a personal stash for his freezer. I cook down and add a good cognac and toast the nuts (sometimes substitute pistastios ). I also layer the nuts between layers of pate. Great as is, or use your imagination...very forgiving.

Although I usually like to make something different for nearly every occasion, I've found myself making this often over the past few years. Although I sometimes substitute pistaschios or pecans, I never omit the figs -- simmering them in a little cognac or port until only a little syrup remains makes the dish. One other note: this pate freezes beautifully, so I always have one in the freezer and often give them as hostess gifts.

I loved this! Next time I won't bother with the nuts and figs--they seem unnecessary once you taste the pate. I can't get over the ease of preparation and relatively inexpensive nature of this dish! I will make this pate again and again.

A few suggestions: If you can find them, try turkey livers instead of chicken, as turkey imparts a more interesting flavor. I also use half the butter called for, and it's still excellent. Finally, when I am making this for a casual-but-elegant evening, I skip the oil-lined mold/fig/walnut presentation, and simply pour the whipped mixture into stoneware crockery--saves loads of time, and the simple country-style presentation reduces the wow! factor, which relaxes my guests.

This recipe has been a big hit each time I made it. For last night's New Years party, I made it as directed except when preparing the figs. I simmered the already-quartered figs in about a cup of 10-year tawney port, for about 15-20 minutes until the port reduced to just a few tablespoons. This enhanced the sweetness of the figs (but not too much) and made a really nice contrast with the salty richness of the pate.

Rating: 3
Excellent taste, but I changed the procedure. Did not use any broth. Instead of boiling the livers and onion, I sauteed them. First sauteed onions in 3 Tbsp olive oil, sprinkled with Herbs de Provence (or just thyme), for about 10 minutes, till colored. Then added the livers and sauteed about 5 minutes more. Put the cognac (I used brandy) into the pan and ignited to flambee. Pureed in the food processor as indicated in the recipe. Delicious!

Have made this several times and it's been a big hit each time. I add 1/2 tsp dried thyme and 1/2 tsp freshly ground pepper to the liver mixture and substitute pistachios for the walnuts. We usually serve it with cornichons and minced red onion on the side, in addition to a bread product. On one occasion I was lucky enough to find fresh figs and they were superb with the pate!

Great and simple - inadvertently put in 1/4 cup brandy - I think Ms. Childs would approve - and it was excellent. Next time I will omit figs as I and my guests felt they didn't add too much to the dish - but the walnuts are very decorative and tasy with it.

This was my first time making pate (with my brand new food processor) and it was wonderful. Even my 18 year old daughter loved it (I didn't tell her it was chicken livers until after she tried it). I used a regular loaf pan and put some colored gelatin in first (which put it on top when turned over) and it was snazzy. The figs were wonderful and are essential to make it palitable for non-pate eaters.

I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed this recipe. It was such a hit...absolutly unbelievable!The figs make the dish beyond special. I too halved the recipe and had alot left over. Next time I would soak the figs 15mins longer in the wine. Try this for sure, if you like pate, you will love this!!!

This was very good. I served it a party of about 15 (along with other appetizers) and there was quite a bit left over. I would half the recipe next time. In a pinch, try purchasing premade pate instead. A serving suggestion: prepare and assemble this in bite sized pieces (piece of bread spread with pate, topped with fig & nuts) and arrange decoratively on a nice serving tray.

If you like pate, you will like this. I don't care for pate, but with the nuts (I used pecans) and the figs I found myself snacking on it.

I followed the lead from the cook from Vancouver and added some figs to pate. Very nice. I was lucky enough to have a patient husband to trim the livers (no small task).

Wonderful pate. The presentation with the figs and some kale for garnish is beautiful. Added a handful of the wine poached figs to the pate; it added a different texture. Really love this pate. Lined a glass terrine with plastic wrap, spooned in the pate, covered it with plastic wrap. Let sit overnight. Didn't oil anything. It came right out onto my platter. Christmas Eve wouldn't have been the same without it.
