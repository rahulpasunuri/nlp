Great tasting recipe and very simple to make. Like most everyone else, I added some extra feta whited helped thicken the sauce. Plus who doesn't love extra cheese. Served it with salad of orzo, grape tomatoes, mixed greens, kalamata olives and pine nuts.

Very good and would make it again, but it needs some adjustment. Next time, I'm definitely adding a clove or two of garlic - there's just something *missing* and garlic isn't a bad place to start on narrowing it down.

This dish is such a family favourite. I add more feta and double up on the tomatoes and broth. To make it easier, I cook skinless chicken breasts in the oven and then add it in sliced.

This soo easy and soo delicious! Made it for a quick Sunday lunch and the kids devoured it, then begged for more. Agree with others, you got to amp up the feta. I also added a small touch of cream to help thicken when I was boiling it down, also used boneless, skinless. I would imagine you could do just about anything with this and it will turn out a'okay!

This was delicious and satisfying on a cold winter night. Was short on shallots so added some garlic as a substitute, and had fresh tomatoes on hand so used those. Boosted the feta as suggested, and would have liked the sauce a bit thicker. Only drawback was that the house smelled so good hours later, that I was tempted to steal out of bed for some of the leftovers.

Excellent! I cut back on the feta and added some skim ricotta to cut some calories. Served with couscous and added freshness with parsley. The chicken (mine without skin) was extremely moist as well.

This a great base for the dish I prepared. I used onion with the shallot, seared the chickend and deglazed with a splashing of white wine. I also added the kalmata olives to the tomatoes and broth as well as canned chickpeas. I let this reduce until the liquid was getting thick, at this point I added some greek yogurt to thicken more. I then used fresh feta as a garnish-supurb will probably use this recipie for a dinner party group I cook for.

I absolutely loved this recipe! I made it for my boyfriend and he wouldn't stop talking about how good is was. After reading some of the reviews, I took up some pointers and added a little red wine to the sauce. This gave the sauce a great kick. I only used about 80% of the chicken broth. The food cooked perfectly as directed. I served with Orzo and a crisp green salad. I also used boneless/skinless chicken breasts.Try this one tonight!

Great recipe but made changes. I used more than 2 tsp. oregano, used only 3/4 cup of crushed tomatoes with some added tomato paste to thicken it. I used 1/2 a can of chicken broth & 1/2 a can of red wine. I also added more feta cheese than called for.

This dish was nice and easy, but I found the sauce to be a little watery. Delicous, but would have liked it to hold up better against the noodles. I added 1/4 diced onion, 2 garlic cloves, and italian parsley to spruce it up a bit. Will make again, but with less chicken broth.

I made this while we were camping in our RV last weekend. Made it for two other couples and EVERYONE raved!!! It went together in a snap. Next time, though, I think I'll just use skinless, boneless breasts. Served it with the Orzo/Feta mac- n-cheese from this site along with steamed broccoli. Yummmmm!!!

I made this last night and can't wait for leftovers today at lunch! I took the advice of others and added 2 tsp. tomato paste, red wine, and garlic. I also used a bit more of the kalamata olives and more feta than the recipe called for. One thing I would change is to leave out salt completely due to the salty nature of the feta and olives. Also, add the olives and feta at the last minute. I think 5 minutes is too much time to cook the feta because I like it when it's not completely melted throug. My husband raved about this dish. Said it was better than something he'd get in a nice restaurant!

This was surprisingly fabulous. I used boneless skinless chicken. The sauce was so good, that this dish would also be great as a straight pasta dish.

Don't forget to add the olives to the sauce even though it doesn't say too. A GREAT EASY DISH!!

We thought this dish was excellent. I used a whole chicken, cut-up, and there was plenty left over for the next day. And...it was even better the next day. The only change I would make would be to serve it with noodles or pasta instead of orzo and that is only because I am not a big fan of orzo. My husband raved about this recipe, and I will definitely make it again.

I loved this, so did my boyfriend. I did modify somewhat, as follows. Did not have chicken breasts with skin and we don't like that, so I used skinless breasts. I pounded them to make them quite a bit thinner (a little over 1/4 inch) and dusted them with flour. Then I browned both sides. With that modification the recipe was great because the chicken was very tender and had a little crust. I would definitely make this again, I plan to make it every few weeks.

This recipe received a rave review from my very picky husband.. I didn't have tomatoes with added puree so I added and 1/2 cup chopped sun dried tomatoes to the other tomatoes while the chicken was cooking. It turned out very good. I chopped 4 large pickled olives (pimento removed) which is all I had on hand and it added quite a bit to the flavor.

Big hit? Good flavor blend. I used skinless chicken breasts. I substituted black olives for the greek and I added a little fresh garlic. Also after it was cooked I topped the pan with as much fresh spinach that would fit in it and covered it to steam to wilt it. Will make it again next time when having guests...that good and easy!

After a recent dinner party I ended up with tons of leftover feta cheese. I searched around for some quick recipes and this one caught my eye, since I had most of the ingredients on hand. Maybe I was just hungry after a long day fighting south Florida traffic, but this was yummy. I used chicken tenderloins, so I did not have to worry about the length of time to cook. This cut of chicken cooks up quick and tender. I used white wine to deglaze the pan before adding the tomatoes and skipped the broth. I did not add the olives to the sauce, but sprinkled on top. Since the Red Wings won the last time I made the dish, it is going to be repeated tonight for Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Finals. GO WINGS!!!

Not outrageous, but pretty good, and very quick and low-energy to make. The orzo is a great accompaniment.

I love this dish...yummy! I followed others' advice and added garlic to the shallots and tomato paste to the sauce to thicken it up a bit. Absolutely fabulous. I did, however, skip the kalamatas, and I'm glad I did. I'm afraid they would have overpowered the already-rich sauce! Instead I used plain ol' black olives, and it worked just fine. Definitely a keeper. Great over olive oil couscous!

This recipe is OK but with a few quick changes it becomes really good. I would definitely marinate the chicken with lots of garlic, lemon, olive oil and whatever fresh herbs are on hand. It really makes it better!! But the tomato and feta and olive combo is great...I made with the lemon potatoes from Kokkari....very good meal!

My husband really liked it! It was good, but next time I would add more feta cheese. And definately half of the broth needs to be substituted by red wine. As I did not have shallots, then onions were fine, too. This food with pasta could be done again!

Rating: 2
I'll make it again but with a few changes. You need to infuse the meat with flavor, possibly by marinating beforehand or simmering longer. Five minutes of browning and ten minutes of simmering just doesn't do it. The sauce is yummy but the meat ends up only tasting like chicken. Also, I only used a quarter can of broth and it was still watery, probably because the canned tomatoes introduced plenty of liquid. Next time I'll spoon only the big chunks into the pan, but in no case will you need an entire can of broth IMO. For the record I used bone-in thighs, no olives, and served it with steamed white rice. Once I get this right it'll be a winner.

Rating: 3
I tried this recipe after looking for a different way to serve chicken with cheese sauce. It is definitely different. I left out the olives and used boneless skinless chicken breasts. I followed the suggestion to use half (or even a quarter) of the broth-a good idea. You'll have to boil it vigorously for about 10 minutes to thicken. Full bodied taste-nice finished with rice and petite peas. Very salty, and only for feta lovers! I will definitely make it again. I would suggest using chicken with skin unless you are like me, and don't enjoy the chicken skin. It will soak up the sauce and keep the chicken moist.

Rating: 3
This dish was quite good and very easy. I would cut the chicken stock in half, however, as it was very watery even with simmering. It seems like it would be very easy to vary it by adding things like garlic or other spices to zip it up a little. We would make it again!

Rating: 3
One can't go wrong with feta in my opinion. I omited the olives, as I think the salt of the tomoatoes and feta is enough for one dish. I also added two tablespoons of flour to thicken my sauce. A rapid boil wasn't doing the trick. My only complaint with the recipe was that the chicken itself was a bit bland. The sauce was wonderful, but the chicken hiding beneath the sauce needed something to balance the flavors of the sauce. My husband recommended marinading the chicken to help flavor the meat. Perhaps Italian dressing ("Wishbone" brand is one of my favorites). I served this dish with my leftover au gratin (feta) potatoes and sauteed carrots. Perhaps I will use a green vegetable next time to add more color to the plate (red, orange and yellow are not colorful enough).

Rating: 2
I liked this dish, but I think I would omit the olives next time and definitely add more cheese. I also would serve it with rice or a different pasta instead of orzo. The orzo had a strange consistency to me. I also added tomato paste and a 1/2 c. of red wine and it made the sauce thick and tasty.

Good basic recipe. I took the other reviewers' suggestions (additional olives and cheese)and have a few of my own: brown the chicken first, then remove from pan and cover with foil. Then saute the shallots and garlic (I used one large clove), add remaining sauce ingredients - make sure you use wine - bring to a boil, reduce heat and then add the chicken for remaining cooking time. I also used feta with sundried tomatoes and basil. I served it with tri-colored orzo. Very nice result.

With alterations, to make the tomato sauce not quite so heavy, this was a decent, quick supper, good to use up leftover feta cheese. Use chicken thighs, as they stay moister; onion instead of shallot; add minced garlic (what's a Greek dish without it??); substitute 6 diced tomatoes w/juices & 2 T tomato paste for the canned tomatoes; wine for the broth (add it a little at a time, so the sauce cooks down rather than turning into a stew). When you mix in the cheese, add chopped parsley and the green parts of scallions, & serve immediately. Good with couscous. Overall, an okay dish, with some nice flavors.

I baked this dish in the oven after bringing the tomato sauce and chicken to a boil.(350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours.) I also added artichokes cut into quarters and left the olives whole during the last 1/2 hour. I doubled the sauce and all the ingredients and used 12 half breasts.

In the future I may take another reviewer's suggestion and shred or dice the chicken and make it more of a pasta sauce dish.

I was looking for something new to make, and boy, did I find it! I have simple comments to make concerning the preparation of the dish though... 1. brown the chicken first,remove it, cook the shallots, add the chicken. Cooking the shallots first makes the chicken stick to the pan. 2. Add some red wine to the sauce for a full bodied flavour, then slowly reduce the sauce to thicken it. 3. Add the feta and olives at the very end, so that they are just warmed throughout. A chunky surprise mouthful of feta is wonderful, besides, sheep's milk cheese has more protein than cow's and does not melt evenly. Do these modifications, and you have a dinner party showpiece!!

This is an excellent quick to make meal with amazing taste. I would suggest taking off the skin of the chicken before replacing it in the sauce. You can also substitute the tomato sauce for a 28oz. can of Pregresso crushed tomatoes with the puree. By doing so, you will make enough sauce to save and use on pasta at another meal. It's really tastey!
