Agree this recipe had a lot of steps - was not as easy as I expected. Lemon was a bit too intense. Unless you really love lemon, I'd omit the zest from the breadcrumb mix next time. Also, I'd bake the chicken next time instead of pan-cooking. That would make the recipe easier.

Excellent and very easy to make. I marinated the chicken for 2 hours in lemon juice, oil and 4 cloves of chopped garlic. My husband loved it.... Would like a sauce next time.

lots of steps but,tasted good and lemony but I'd like something a little easier.

Chicken came out juicy but even though we pounded it down, it took way more than two minutes a side and over-browned. I marinated for about 2 hours in lemon juice, garlic and olive oil but I didn't notice very much lemon flavor. All in all, an OK meal, but not good enough to justify all that butter. :)

I served this as a side dish with the Lemon Gnocchi with Spinach and Peas. The two dishes complemented each other well. Both have light, fresh, summery lemon-parmesan flavor. I will make this dish again.

This was Delish!! I too marinated it in garlic, olive oil and lemon juice and used flour as well. really tasty!!

Really delicious. Thanks to the other reviewers.. I did the marinate, dipped in flour first and made the remains into a fabulous sauce. Thank you!

I like the dish and made it with rice pilaf. However, they left out one crucial step: dip the chicken into flour before the egg. Otherwise, the crust won't stay on the chicken. Make sure to have a bowl of flour on hand if you want this to resemble anything coated in breadcrumbs. My husband wants me to try it with pasta next time. The good thing about chicken is that it can go with just about any carb you choose.

I made this recipe a lot when it first came out, years ago! It was a favorite and we even loved it as cold leftovers. Since then, I've craved the recipe, but we quit eating chicken. Tonight I tried it with Tilapia. I mixed the bread crumbs with flour and only used a TBS of butter for 2 large Tialpia filets. It was delightful! My honey couldn't stop raving and said it is the best thing I ever made. I still think it is better with chicken, but pretty awesome with Tilapia too.

This was a nice weekday recipe. I used the woman's marinade suggestion. My daughter liked it that way. However, for my husband and I, I used the scrapings from the chicken pan, added approx. 1/2 cup water, 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1 1/2 Tbl of sugar, and 1 tsp of lemon peel and boiled. Once that boiled, I added a corn starch/water mix (1 T/1T) and simmered until it thickened. It made a nice lemony sauce on top...husband scraped the pan for more.

This is excellent if you do one thing different. Omit the soaking in lemon juice, as it can get strange and lemony

I have made this numerous times... new tweeks, marinate in lemon juice, garlic, olive oil and a few dashes of Janes Crazy Salt- I also use chicken tenders- white meat, kids LOVE this... dredge in a bit of flour first, then into the eggs, then into a combo of breadcrumbs/Parm cheese and Panko Japanese crumbs- this method helps keep the breading on the chicken, plus the Panko makes it super crispy- cook in olive oi; with a smidge of butter. A fun recipe for kids to help with.

These were very good although I didn't think they would be. I used the lemon/oil marinade for 3 hours suggested by other users (this is a MUST-so good!) and followed the recipe after that. The only problem was all of the parmesan/breadcrumb mixture fell off the chicken in the skillet, making just a big mess. This may be because I used actual bread crumbs from a piece of bread. Next time I will use the store kind. Also, be sure to pound the chicken because otherwise it just took way too long to cook through. Moral of the story: very good, but don't serve to company!

Thank you to the reviewer from Florida who suggested marinating the chicken in a garlic, lemon and olive oil mixture. I did just that and it was terrific! I sauteed the chicken in a combination of olive oil and a bit of butter and it was delicious. And so easy to make! My family raved about the chicken and asked me to make it again. What more could you ask for?

Rating: 3
Definitely easy and good. Husband gobbles it down. I also only use olive oil. I skip the permesan when I want to be extra healthy, and it's still good.

I had made this recipe many times before but after reading some of the more recent reviews, I decided to change it a bit. I took a garlic-lemon marinade from another Epicurious recipe (1/4 cup olive oil (I used an organic one with meyer lemon infusion), 2 cloves minced garlic, 2 tablespoons lemon juice strained, and 1/2 tsp salt) and marinated the chicken breasts for about 3 hours. I followed the rest of the recipe, but did not use butter in the skillet, just regular olive oil. I got rave reviews!

This was quite a tasty and simple dish. I would have liked a slightly more intense lemon flavor, but it was respectable as is. Im follwoed the recipe exactly - no changes or modifications and it was well received by all.

Easy and great for a family dinner. I threw in a little Herbes de Provence and it was great! Also- marinate a bit longer and cook in olivie oil with a touvh of butter. A rich dish like this only needs some steamed vegetables on the side.

Very tasty. I also did not pound the chicken thin enough, and came close to over browning. I served it over roasted garlic couscous. All in all, I would make again.

This may have been my best chicken dish ever! I seem to have found a "secret ingredient" that I just had to share. I forgot to buy lemons and then found I was even out of bottled lemon juice. On a lark I used Mike's Hard Lemonade to marinade and to mix into the egg batter. [I also used an 1/8 of a teaspoon lemon power in the egg batter.] So try some hard lemonade sometime - but shush - don't tell anyone:)

My boyfriend made this dish for Valentine's Day and it was very tasty! A lot of the breading fell off during frying but the lemon flavor was wonderfully fragrant. He served it with a side of pasta and marinara sauce like chicken parmesan and it all came together great! Will definitely make this dish again.

Rating: 3
I didn't thin the chicken enough so cooking time took a little longer. I did however double dip the chicken to allow the breading to stick. Olive oil also worked very well as a substitute for butter.

Rating: 4
Wonderful taste. Easy to make. Key to success:freshly grated parmesan and bread crumbs from pounded Italian crackers (crostini available at Trader Joes). I needed to cook the chicken for at least 5-8 minutes on each side. Next time I will pound the chicken much thinner. Also, be sure to use a stick free pan.

Rating: 3
The chicken tasted great, followed the recipe exactly. I did encounter the same problem as another cook. When I fried my chicken in butter, the coating came off. The second batch of chicken, I added olive oil to fry them in. That solved the problem. I had no problem with under-cooked chicken because I pounded my chicken breasts very thin. So they cooked very quickly and browned nicely.

Rating: 1
I have tried this dish twice but experiemced the same problem as a couple of the other reviewers, where the chicken took so long to cook through that all of the coating wound up burned to the pan. Anybody have any thoughts on what I'm doing wrong? The second time I even horizontally halved the chicken breasts and still had the same problem.

This was a big hit with my family! I made it and put the chicken breasts in a bed of spaghetti noodles and then poured sauce over the top. I was very good. Liked the chicken by itself too.

Yum! This is an excellent, easy to make recipe. I asked to butcher shop to tenderize the chicken for me. They got it so thin it just melted in your mouth. Makes great leftover too! We will be making this again soon.

This recipe is nothing special. It's good as a change from plain ol' chicken, but it's not a "company meal".

This recipe is always a hit. It can be made so quickly. For fast cooking, flatten your chicken a little more than 1/2 inch. Also, add a little more butter before you flip over and both sides will be very crispy. Excellent served with pasta with chunky tomato sauce with sauteed onions, squash and zucchini topped with parmesan. Very light but filling meal. Made this recipe many, many times.

It was time for a change, as I had tasted my wife's basic chicken recipes for too long! She branched out and prepared this dish as a special surprise. We served it in our beautiful dining room. The chicken was tender and the bread crumb and lemon mixture was light and tasty.

I followed the recipe as it was written and had no problems at all. I did finish it in the oven for about 10 minutes, just to make sure the chicken was done all the way through. I thought it had a great flavor and I will definitely make this again.

This recipe turn out awful for me. The coating never stuck to the chicken. I think it would have worked better with olive oil.

This was very good and not at all difficult. For some reason I did not get as much of a lemon flavor as I wanted. I served it with lemon pepper pasta tossed with olive oil and parmesean and a green salad w/ fresh tomatoes and Blasamic Italian dressing. It was very good.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but we didn't like this dish one bit. The lemon-taste (from the juice, not the peel) was overwhelming, really tart. The coating was nothing special at all. Will definitely NOT make this again!

Whatever you do, do not omit the lemon peel that is mixed in the bread crumbs. I make this type of chicken often and that is what sets this recipe apart from other parmesan chicken recipes. I also used olive oil instead of butter and it is still delicious!

This is by far the best chicken cutlet recipe I have ever made. The first time I made it the crust fell off..the second time I placed the cooked cutlets on paper towels. This made the difference. MMM MMM GOOD!!

Rating: 1
I'm not sure how to rate this recipe because either I did something REALLY wrong, or it just wasn't good. Seems like the heat was much to high, even just over medium and the coating quickly burned, leaving the chicken uncooked in the middle. I had to finish in the oven and ended up scraping the coating off while guests sat at the table. I'll admit the chicken was still very moist, but I was disappointed not to have tried the great sounding coating. I'll probably try again, maybe even skipping the fry pan altogether.

Great. I didn't have boneless skinless chicken braests, so I had to make it with breats with skin and bones. (I did deskin the breasts, however.) So, instead of frying in a pan, I baked the chicken. There wern't really any favorable conditions for my making this dish; I didn't have parmesan to grate myself, so I had to use the kraft fat free parmesan that comes in a bottle. I also was only making dinner for my mom and myself, so I had to reduce the recipe to a 1/3 scale. Despite these set backs, it came out delicious. The breading kept the chicken very moist and delicious. I'm going to go out and buy boneless skinless chicken breasts, to give this recipe the medium that it deserves. A definite keeper.
