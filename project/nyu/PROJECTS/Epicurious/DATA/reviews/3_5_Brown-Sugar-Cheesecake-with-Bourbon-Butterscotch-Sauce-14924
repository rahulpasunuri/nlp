I have made this cheesecake meny times for my customers and I am amazed how quickly it is gone. I have had customers beg me to make them another one for themselves because it was gone before they could get a taste. The best was when I was called from London by a military wife/friend to make, freeze and send her one for a very importent dinner party. On the cold days of fall there is not a better way to indulge your sweet tooth.

I made this a couple of days ago. I was very pleased with the way the cheescake turned out--the sour cream topping is a nice twist. The SAUCE, however, took forever and was not worth . Like another one of the reviwers I had the thought of adding bourbon to butterscotch sauce in lieu of making the sauce again. Good to know that didn't turn out. It went through so many differnt forms, and it took so long for the sugar to melt. Then when I added the bourbon and water it turned hard and I had to melt it all over again. Upon each reheating of the sauce it's gone through multiple congealing phases. Realloy werid stuff. I felt like I was making some sort of Harry Potter potion there for a while.

I made this for a Thanksgiving feast and it was very well received. Two vegans were advised to make an exception for this cheesecake. I followed the directions except for the sauce. I just simmered a jar of butterscotch ice cream topping with 1/2 cup bourbon. That was not so good, and I may try to make the sauce the next time. I loved the chocolate pecan crust, and the sour cream topping gave the cake a nice tangy kick. The cheesecake is beautiful when you take it out of the springform pan. This one disappeared quickly.

I have to agree with another reviewer in that this is a smooth and sexy cheesecake. It got RAVE reviews from my family on Christmas, however, I like the thicker, New York style cheesecake better and would probably only make this again on request. The sauce was fantastic on it.

Everyone loved this. I am glad that I read the comments before making, since I did have to bake the cheesecake 10 min.longer. The sauce does take a long time to make, but well worth it.

I've made this twice and the reviews are all the same...one of the best, smoothest, sexiest cheesecakes ever. The sauce didn't work the first two times ??? but worked fine the third time. I love the cake without it too. A very subtle but complex gem.

It gets 4 forks with sauce, 2-3 without. The sauce was time consuming, but well worth it. I didn't try it for the sauce, but I suppose you could start with caramel and melt in the butter & bourbon. My guests loved it.

My guests loved this cheesecake! I used gingersnaps for the crust instead of the grahams and it was awesome. The sauce took a while to make, but it was worth it and made the cheesecake taste even better!

Subtle flavoring, but very tasty. Sauce DOES take a long time and is very sweet, but that's balanced by the not-too-sweet cake and the sour cream. I used glazed pecans for a garnish and also served a simple puree of slightly sweetened peaches with the cake -- very good! (apricot or raspberry would also work). could also add choc layer or chips.

I make desserts for a local restuarant so I tried this one out and it was gone in a day! I agree with the previous cook- needs more baking time and the sauce took forever- but well worth it.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone thought it was fabulous. I received many compliments on it. Then again it never hurts to have a nip of bourbon when your with my family. We have a nut allergy in the family so I substituted boxed Oreo crust and boxed graham cracker crust and it worked fine. My only problem is the middle of the cake was soft and yogurt-like rather than typical cheesecake consistency, so you may want to add 5 or 10 minutes baking time before adding the topping. Also, maybe it was me but it took a long time to make the butterscotch bourbon sauce because the sugar took forever to melt. I probably spent between 30 minutes and an hour on just the sauce. Still, I'll be making this again soon - probably for the Christmas gathering.
