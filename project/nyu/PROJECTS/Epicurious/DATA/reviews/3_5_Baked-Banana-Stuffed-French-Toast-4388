This is a good weekend breakfast recipe. I added more cinnamon than called for and didn't use the powdered sugar. I used Orowheat Double Fiber bread beacuse that is what I had on hand. It is only 70 calories per slice so this is a low- cal and healthy recipe. A real breakfast treat but VERY filling.

Very good recipy. The only fault about it is the banana and the bottom bread are both a bit too mushy.

Perfectly decent; everybody liked You're kidding about the liver pate, right?

I used only about one-half the amount of bananna called for, and the middle was still very mushy, which my family didn't appreciate. Sustitute jam for the bananna to get some variety.

Banana flavour was a little bland and the whole dish was way too heavy for breakfast.

Made this for my husband and myself, we didn't really care for it. The bananas tasted bland. Would prefer french toast without them.

This is a nice, filling breakfast dish. Definetely ensure the use of icing sugar as I found the dish needed the sweetness. Used regular whole wheat bread which did not require as much soak time due to its lighter texture. Will make again. Quick and easy to impress a crowd for breakfast/brunch.

Very good recipe...I soaked the sliced bananas in a little lime juice, sugar and white rum for about 10-15 mins then mashed with a fork before putting on bread slices. The end product was delicious, ordinary french toast is too bland for me this is just very tasty. My hubby loved it and will make it for my mother in law when she comes to visit. Will also include this for my next brunch.

Good stuff. I toasted pecans in a skillet and added some brown sugar to carmelize, and served the toasts with the nuts on top. I also think the entire dish would be good with a penuche sauce rather than maple syrup.

This recipe is delicious!! I used more than a mere pinch of cinnamon, since I love cinnamon, and it came out great. Definitely top with maple syrup! Also, make sure you are very hungry when you make this - It's extremely filling.

Quick, easy, and filling. What great way to use up ripe bananas! I only had Italian bread and King syrup and it was delicious. I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe in the home ec class I teach and the kids loved it. My family loves it too. I would certainly make it again. It is an interesting twist to the old french toast recipe.

A very nice change of pace over regular old French Toast. Also another good way to use bananas.

Delicious! I also used thinly sliced challah bread. I added some blueberries to the mashed bananas and the combinations was excellent. It is definately filling!

This is an amazing and EASY breakfast or brunch recipe. I mashed the bananas instead and spread a thin coating over the bread and then sprinkled it with toasted, chopped pecans. I also substituted buttermilk to add extra flavour w/o much more fat. Teriffic! Everyone had seconds--even me!

This was a good, easy recipe. Without gourmet skills or lots of counter-space to prep., this was a tasty treat that the family loved.

The end result was tasty but this turned out to be a pretty heavy-going breakfast, even for a Sunday morning. We'll stick with our regular French Toast.

This recipe was delicious and easy to make. My 2-year-old loved it. I used home made Challah bread instead.

A suggested alternative to the eggs, milk, etc. dip, is to substitute spiked eggnog. I have done this with left over eggnog from the night before, and it is good.

Great taste and very filling.

May substitute kiwi, apricot, or peache slices for bananas and it's delicious. Also, half buttermilk and heavy cream instead of the milk is superior. Don't worry about the fat content...Indulge and enjoy!
