I decided to leave out the oil & vinegar called for, & instead puree the garlic with the entire contents of the artichoke jars. Big mistake! The liquid measured the same, but I ended up with artichoke soup. Too little oil in the marinade I would guess. It's still sitting in the fridge while I decide what to do with it. In the meantime, I've made the appetizers using an herb cheese I have on hand as the base instead of artichokes. I'm using rare beef slices from a high quality deli, & rolling them around tiny gherkin pickles. I ended up grating the cheese as it didn't want to co-operate. They look good, Hope they taste okay!

We LOVED this....wow! I served it as part of a heavy appetizer cocktail hour. Didn't have arugula so I used a chiffonade of baby spinach -- worked great. Forgot to buy a chunk of Parm, so used grated Parm that I had on hand, and that looked pretty and tasted fine. Guests raved (men and ladies alike!). Will absolutely make this again when I need a heavier appetizer / showstopper.

Perfect! I followed the suggestion from others and reduced the vinegar and didn't rinse the artichokes. I paired this with our just released Cabernet and made "300" food pairings for the wine club. They loved it! I purchased medium rare, thinly sliced beef from my local meat market. Wonderful served at room temp. for a large group.

Delicious! I agree with reducing the vinegar - I reduced it a little but still found it overpowered the artichoke. Next time I'll leave it out.

I made this for a party and it was a big hit! I used white balsamic vinegar because it was what I had, and it seemed a bit too strong. As others have suggested, you may not want to use all of the vinegar suggested. I used lamb instead of beef tenderloin to save money and it was fabulous (although I am sure tenderloin is great)! Piave (one of my current favorite hard cheeses) is a great substitute for the Parmesan if you are looking for something a little different. A great cocktail party dish. Very elegant!

Big hit with my dinner guests. I grilled a well-seasoned filet mignon. It creates a nice spicy edge when you slice it thinly. And just pour the entire contents of the jar of marinated artichokes into the blender - no vinegar or olive oil necessary (though I do like garlic).

I added some good quality balsamic to the artichokes...yummy and so easy to prepare. Will use again

Made with flank steak marinated in red wine and herbs. This was an absolute hit.

Really delicious, pretty, and fairly easy to make, especially if you take a shortcut on the spread. I agree with the last reviewer -- just blend the artichokes with their marinade. The taste is the same (I tried it both ways). Everyone I have made this for has raved about it. Great for a cocktail party.

WHAT A FABULOUS BLEND OF FLAVORS! I own a restaurant, & I served this as an appetizer, for Father's Day. To liven up the colors, I added Roasted Red Bell Pepper Strips. Unfortunately, my produce co. did not deliver me Argula, so, I substituted Fresh Basil Leaves. I picked up this AM, Fresh Baked French loaves, to make the Crostini. ***I have a HUGE QUESTION! This recipe calls for you to rinse off (the olive oil, garlic, and vinegar) from the Marinated Artichokes. Then to pulsate, the rinsed off (artichokes, with Olive Oil, Garlic and Vinegar). In my Opinion, this requires several steps that ARE NOT needed. The next time I make this artichoke paste, I will simply put the marinated artichokes into the blender and blend until a paste. There really is no need to take out, what the artichoke hearts are marinated in, and then, add back what the artichoke hearts are marinated in! * I cooked the Fillet of Beef, EXACTLY as called for in this recipe and it is mouth watering good! I laveshly, spread the artichoke spread, onto the cut bread pieces, then topped with Fresh Basil Leaf, then, the fillet of beef pieces, then the shaved parmesean. I arranged these pieces, (4 crostini w/beef etc), on Fresh, Romaine Lettece, and garnished with Roasted Red Bell Peppers. TRULY A KNOCK-OUT! EVEN my 4 Star Chef, was impressed!

I took the advice of another, and just purchased the best rare roast beef I could from the deli, and I think the results were fine. The men in the crowd loved this dish. Use vinegar lightly, as for my artichokes, 1/4 cup vinegar was too much. This was easy to prepare, attractive, eaten by the crowd - - - definitely a keeper!

Terrific recipe, tasted even better, when I warmed it in the over just until the parmesan cheese melted.

This is a fabulous recipe. I've made it several times and it is always a big hit. Very savory, excellent with cocktails.

I've made this recipe numerous times and it always impresses - especially the men in the crowd!!! The combination of arugula, the artichoke mix, beef and parmesan was outstanding! Of course, using the best of everything really adds to the dish.

Excellent appetizer! Biggest hit at the party! Made it easier on myself by buying thinly sliced rare roast beef from deli.

Awesome!!! I prepared this for a bridal shower. It tasted great and I got lots of great reviews. The tenderloin was so extremely tender, however, that it was very difficult to cut thinly without crumbling. But...Yummmmy!

Received very well at several different dinner parties. Very easy to put together, leaving time for more complicated dishes. Rib-eye is also a good cut for this recipe.

Time consuming to assemble and a bit expensive, but WELL WORTH IT. We brought it to a cocktail party... my boyfriend was so excited about the fabulousness of the dish, that I got continuous updates throughout the night about how it was fairing against "the competition". Next time I may season the beef a little more for some kick.

I made this recipe for a New Year's Eve party and everyone really enjoyed it! I am not a beef eater so I can't rate the taste myself, but everyone that tried it asked for the recipe.

I halved the recipe for a small dinner party and it was perfect. Cooking the filet to 125 is a must to make sure the beef is perfectly rare/medium rare and tender. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for a small dinner party. There was a lot left over, so my husband insisted on finishing it off by himself! He couldn't wait until the guests left, either. I made it a couple of days ahead, and it kept very well. Might have combined the flavors better, too. Definitely use good, thickly cut bread, or the dip will soak through.

Made this for a party. Delicious. Will certainly make again!

Outstanding and easy to prepare. I made this for a friend's anniversary party and it flew off the plate . . . this is great for parties since you don't need to concern yourself with keeping it warm.

I have been making this dish since it first appeared in gourmet. It has been a mainstay for a hearty appetizer for all parties and tailgates. always wins much praise. I don't add half the vinegar, because I find the marinated artichokes, even rinsed, still have a tartness to them.

I am a professional chef and caterer. Prepared this item as one of 7 for a cocktail party for 60. It was very well received and the ability to prepare the "parts" separately eases with preparation when you are doing a fairly large party! I agree with the other reviewer that slicing the beef very thin is a must.

I actually made the dish over 3 consecutive days - first the spread, then the beef, finally the toasts. I served these at a cocktail party and they were a hit. I used a little bit more salt in the spread, since using too much on the beef tends to dry it out. I also didn't want people to taste overly salty beef but a nice combination with a saltier spread.

This was really outstanding. I served this at a party and several women asked for the recipe. One friend will be using this at a tail-gate party. I plan on making it again for a steeplechase party.

I made this a couple of times for holiday parties and it literally flies off the plate! I did make a slight adjustment: Since I usually have the "hot" variety of marinated artichokes, I just used a drizzle of vinegar - my husband thought it was just too overpowering with the full 1/4 cup. Otherwise, it was outstanding and much of it can be made well in advance of your party. In my opinion, the thinner you can slice the beef, the better.

This is a very special and tasty appetizer with its combination of tender beef, marinated artichokes, spicy arugula and nutty parmesan on chunchy crostini. It is also pleasing to the eye and as such is a wonderful addition to a buffet table. It's interesting to note that in the October, 1995 issue of Bon Appetit, there is another recipe, Beef Tenderloin and Artichoke Puree on Rye Toast, that is so similar it even uses arugula and parmesan curls!
