This was great! I cut back on the butter and cheese, as other reviews suggested. Used a food processor on the carrot and onion to reduce the prep time. Husband and 8 year old devoured it.

YUM. Deep and delicious flavors. Do make sure to use a low or no-salt broth. I skipped the butter, and used 1/3 a cup of cheese and it had all of the richness it needed.

A lot of prep work (chopping, etc.) for something I didn't enjoy as much as I though I would. The flavors were ok but I think I like slightly stronger risottos and it was a bit too creamy with all the cheese. Definitely too heavy to use as an entree, so it should just be used as an appetizer.

Satisfying and terrific! Just back from a trip to the farmer's market, I had all the ingredients on hand, and also added fresh edamame and peas. A great stand-by risotto recipe that I'll be sure to make again.

This was a great success! I followed the timing indicated for each addition and it helped to get the right consistency. I will definitely have this again. Very fresh.

I made this recipe mostly as written (slightly less butter, slightly less cheese, sub veggie broth) and it was fantastic. Yes, a contrast to the muskly earthiness of a wild mushroom risotto, but that's what I liked. This dish is bright with spring flavors, balanced with the risotto's creamy richness. I used a strong chardonney which I'd reccomend to make the wine flavor pronounced. A lot of work, but the workload is made easier if you chop all your veg in advance.

I ommitted the butter and no one missed it. Fresh, organic vegetables add plenty of flavor. This is just a classic, simple recipe. Great as a side dish with some grilled shrimp or as an entree. One can even tote this to a sophisticated potluck. Very versatile and flavorful.

Made this for Easter dinner and it was a huge success. The best risotto recipe I've ever found, everyone raved about it. I made it exactly as directed. I found it fed a lot more than 6-8 people (12 is more like it) and I also found it to be delicious reheated the next day.

This is my go-to recipe for small dinner parties and family get-togethers. I absolutely love the way the flavors come together, and unlike another reviewer, I think the leftovers are just as good as the original!

This was a lovely, flavourful risotto. It smelled great, it tasted quite good. But I realized while eating it I don't actually like it. I prefer the wintry, autumny type of risotto with mushrooms or chicken or squash. There is something a bit too frozen peas and carrots/rice pilaf about the look of this risotto and I find myself thinking of the leftovers with dread.

Very nice vegetable risotto, wouldn't really change anything.

Fabulous! I didn't get the directions for cutting the squash, so I used 1-inch cubes, and they worked great.

We really enjoyed this risotto and I plan to make it again, but I'll think about ways to simplify the process and not dirty every dish in the house.

I omitted the carrots due to previous comments and did not have peas. This was very flavorful and rich. The asparagus and zucchini cut the richness nicely. I will definitely make it again.

Added bite size pieces of pre-cooked chicken and used salt and pepper generously. Good weeknight meal.

I would omit the baby carrots and add another vegetable - maybe broccoli florets. Other than that, this was fabulous and a definite do-again.

My family LOVES this recipe and we make it often and always to rave reviews!! We omit butter and sometimes use different veggies (mushrooms, corn, red pepper). No matter what we do, it's always wonderful! Best of all, use the leftovers to make risotto cakes. Just add an egg to the leftover risotto and mix. Then drop in small amounts into a pan with a couple TBS of olive oil. Shape the risotto into cakes as you saute, and cook until deep golden brown on both sides. Top with parmesan and serve with salad and wine. A fantastic meal in itself! Enjoy!

Hated it. I like risotto but this just wasn't good. Don't know why. I think it was the asparagus. I like asparagus but with stronger flavors like balsamic vinegar and garlic. The only thing that I could taste in this dish was asparagus. It needs garlic or SOMETHING. White wine is too mild a flavour.

This was wonderful! I used double the amount of asparagus and excluded the pine nuts. My family loved it for Easter and it was excellent as leftovers!

Rating: 3
Very good. Very spring like with the veggies. Used slightly less butter and olive oil than the recipe suggests. Didn't have pine nuts which was too bad because that would have made it even better. I sauteed all the vegetables first, (didn't chop any carrot just used baby carrots), then added the rice for a few minutes, then the wine and chicken stock. No need to go through those other steps. All the risotto recipes I've ever made have been one pot dishes and this should be no exception. If you like vegetables, this is your dish!

Like this risotto quite a bit - there are a couple of different ingredients that set it apart from typical recipes, including the finely diced carrots sauted initially with the onion and the toasted pine nuts sprinkled on top. All combined to make a wonderfully textured risotto. As with previous reviewers, we cut back on the oil, butter, and cheese(and used veggie broth), and it turned out wonderfully. Thanks to the previous reviewer for reminding me of the yellow pepper risotto on this site! I had tried that years ago and had forgotten about it. Very tasty, as I recall.

I served this with a salad of mixed mesclun greens with a vinaigrette dressing as the main course at a luncheon for a group of friends; it was a wonderful dish; rich, creamy and delicious - perfect comfort food on a cold February day. I like that the vegetables stay crisp, too. Be sure to use the very best parmesan you can find - it does make a difference. If you are a fan of risotto as I am try the Yellow Pepper Risotto on this site. I found the recipe years ago in Gourmet and have been making it ever since - to rave reviews.

I replaced the white wine with red (because I had a bottle open) and through in some broccoli that needed to be used. It came out a light purple color -- and tastes great! Definitely worth it!

I loved this risotto with all of the vegetables. I make a different risotto just about every weekend and this one is always being requested by family and friends. I also use less butter and I don't use the whole baby carrots. Sometimes I vary the vegetables depending on what I have. Definitely a keeper!!

Ordinary?! -- Hardly! This was an absolutely wonderful recipe. I served it last night with some parmesan encrusted sole (just dust the sole with a mixture of grated parm and flour, then pan fry in butter and olive oil until browned) -- the fish really complimented the risotto. I may try it next time with some grilled shrimp, although this dish can certainly stand all on it's own!

Made this at Easter. It was fabulous. Lots of chopping of vegetables to get to the end product but worth it!

This was a typical risotto dish and nothing special. Next time I make it I will cut down on the butter and oil, since risotto is already so rich.

I have made this dish 4 times. We eat it as a main dish. It is wonderful.

Made this for my Italian-themed potluck, and it got rave reviews. I thought the rice absorbed the liquid faster then the recipe expected, actually. Maybe I had the temp a bit too high, though. I also did a yellow pepper instead of the crookneck squash. And no peas. But still, very good, and now I've got the feel for how to make risotto.

I made this last night and just loved it. I used a yellow pepper as well as used 1/2 large, sweet onion. Cut the butter & oil in half; next time I would probably skip the butter altogether as it is not needed. Risotto is naturally creamy if you are using arborio rice. Plus the cheese adds an even more creamy consistency. Anyway, quite a beautiful dish, but it takes longer than the recipe says to gradually incorporate all the broth. Not a problem, however...just enjoyed another glass of wine.

We've made this dish 4 times already and are still willing to make it again. Like another reviewer, my husband normally does not like risotto but actually asks for this one. Its true that it is also very versatile, I tend to add some mozzarella at the end and garlic pronounces the flavous a bit more in a subtle way. Compared to other risottos I've made I would give it average difficulty. Originally, I made it with butternut squash b/c crookneck (ie yellow zuchini) was not yet available here, worked all right.

First time making Risotto of any kind. I was very pleased with the results. My husband, who normally doens't like creamy foods, rated this dish. I didn't have asparagus, so I used brocoli. Worked well. I will make it again.

instead of the oil/saute routine - I blanched all of the veggies in boiling water prior to a ice water bath. then - when making the risotto - I added in everything. I cut the butter/oil in half and used more broth and doubled the basil and added a yellow bell pepper for more bright color. It was still quite creamy and rich. I served it to six for dinner next to grilled fish/lentil salsa. Everyone loved it and commented on how beautiful it was! The parmesan cheese certainly led to a sticky clean up - but it is worth it - I will make it again! time consuming.

It is a good recipe but nothing extraordinary. I don't think you actually need this recipe to make it - a bit of imagination and fresh veggies and you've about got it.

I've made this recipe twice, and while it is a bit labor intensive, it is quite good. The only change I made was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, making this a vegetarian dish. The result was very creamy, with very good flavors.

My guests and I enjoyed this dish for dinner tonight. A great use of spring vegetables; much better than making pasta primavera. The risotto came out creamy, and the vegetables maintained their unique flavors. I used a pinot grigio for the wine and substituted yellow bell pepper for yellow squash.
