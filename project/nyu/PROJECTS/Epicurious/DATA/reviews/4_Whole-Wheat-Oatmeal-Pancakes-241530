This recipe is good. I used oat flour instead of oatmeal by blending it in my blender. I did not have to soak the oats. Followed recipe exactly other than that. The pancakes were smooth and very tasty. I used real maple syrup on top!

Just made this. For those of you who avoid dairy, I made almond buttermilk by adding about 2 tbsp to the amount 1 1/2 c almond milk. It curdled nicely! I also used Earth Balance butter. If you're vegan, just sub out the egg with applesauce or a flax egg. These were delish!! Perfect taste to accompany syrup. I added vanilla based on other reviews and can't complain about the end product. Yum!

Had to try it with all these great reviews. Found the batter a bit too runny and in need of vanilla (which I added: 1 teaspoon). Next time, I'll increase the amount of wheat flour to 1 cup.

I had some buttermilk that was going to go bad, so I decided to try this out. They were delicious. A much healthier alternative to the standard buttermilk pancake. I like the fact that the pancakes have some texture most of all. My only complaint is about the recipe "yield" noted. It makes a heck of a lot more than "4 individual pancakes." It's more like pancakes for 4 individuals, especially at 1/4 cup of batter per pancake.

Rating: 4
Made exactly as written. Fantastic. Hands down the best pancakes we've eaten in this house. I'm guessing here but, maybe the problem people are having with them being too runny is the type of buttermilk being used. I used whole buttermilk (3.25%). Thicker milk, not runny at all. Oh, sorry, I did cook a little longer. 1min on second side not enough. Otherwise, awesome

My 34-year-old loved these pancakes. I used steel-rolled oats because I don't use quick-cooking, and I let the oats soak for more than 10 minutes, but I'm not sure it mattered. The batter seemed a bit runny to me, so next time I'll use a bit more flour. I also found that they browned (burned) pretty quickly, so I'll cook them longer over lower heat. Delicious!

Rating: 4
Good stuff. I used two whole cups of buttermilk (nonfat milk and lemon juice) as some suggested but it came out too runny. I had to add more flour. I added a tiny bit of ginger powder. Next time I think I'll add more/and different spices. I topped it with sliced bananas and a strawberry puree. Next time maybe coconut extract topped with mango and coconut flakes?

Rating: 4
Very moist and tasty. I used steel cut oats and soaked them in 4Tbs buttermilk powder/1 cup water, then added 1/2 cup plain nonfat yogurt to the batter. Substituted 1 Tbs oil for the butter, and only used 1 tsp sugar. The nutmeg in the batter paired very well with blueberries for those who like fruit pancakes.

Made me 8 large very fluffy perfect pancakes. I substituted Old Fashioned Oats since I don't use quick-cooking oats and it worked just as well. I plan to make them often. Absolutely perfect!

My mom used to make whole wheat pancakes that were full of nuts and very dense. These were light and tasty while still making me happy to serve them to my family! I only had powdered buttermilk, but it worked fine! I used one cup of the milk to the oats and added about a 1/8 to a 1/4 cup of flax seeds at the end. I also made a blueberry compote to put on top. Great!

Rating: 4
Very fluffy and not too wheat-y. I omitted all of the spices (including the sugar) because I was going to use some pureed strawberries for a topping. Besides, I don't usually like my breakfast to be too sweet. I'm not sure what size pancakes the original publisher was making, but this recipe made about 8 pancakes for me.

Really delicious recipe. I added extra buttermilk (1 c instead of 3/4) like some reviewers suggested. The pancakes came out really fluffy and full of flavor.

My whole family loves these pancakes. I have no problem making them every week because they are whole grain. I personally find that it works better if you use 1 full cup of butter milk to soak the oats and use almost 2 full cups of buttermilk total.

Surprisingly light pancakes. Since I didn't have buttermilk on hand, I used the vinegar + milk substitute. Turned out very well! This is my de facto recipe now.

Made as-is except vegan by using almond milk with lemon juice instead of buttermilk, and earth balance instead of butter (if good this way, they would definitely be good if using dairy). They're moist but not soggy, they rise the perfect amount without being too airy or cakey, and they're flavorful without being too sweet. Topped with berries and their juice; didn't need syrup. Both the foodies and "Bisquick-likers" asked for the recipe. The batch made about 8, 4-inch pancakes (the recipe's yield amount must be an error).

I think these are the best pancakes I've ever made or eaten. I typically prefer savory breakfast foods, but this recipe is definitely going to enter my brunch repertoire. It's hard to say what makes them so great - they don't taste particularly buttermilky, nor very oaty, nor heavily spicy - but somehow the ingredients come together in perfect balance. These are exactly what pancakes should be!

These are the fluffiest, yummiest pancakes I've ever made! I used a combination of buttermilk, yogourt and milk (it's what I had) but they were SO fluffy. Wow. As others have said, it makes way more than 4 pancakes....but that's not a problem, because you'll want more!

This recipe is fantastic. I didn't have all of the ingredients, so I had to improvise. Even with the changes, this recipe was still outstanding. Also, if you like cinnamon, you can add an extra 1/4 teaspoon and it almost tastes like french toast. I ended up with a lot of batter left over though, which isn't a bad thing for me. Now I don't have to make the batter for another 2 or 3 mornings! Would absolutely make again.

These were delicious. I doubled the recipe to get rid of some buttermilk I had leftover and replaced the eggs with a very ripe banana. I also sprinkled some shredded coconut on top of the pancakes when cooking them. The only thing I would change next time is that I would use less sugar. I think the banana made this extra-sweet.

I thought, when I read the reviews calling these pancakes light, you folks were out of your mind! MY APOLOGIES!! These are amazing, not to mention rather healthy. They are quite filling,but that is a good thing. Of course, I tweaked the recipe. I had to "make" my own buttermilk using lowfat milk and lemon juice. I added more cinnamon, used prepared nutmeg b/c that's what I had, and added a small dash of ground clove. I also added fresh blueberries while they were cooking. (husband is allergic to bananas) The moisture from the blueberries kept them very moist, and the syrup was truly unnecessary. I doubled the recipe b/c it says it makes 4 individual pancakes ... but those gotta be some HUGE pancakes! I followed suggestions here and froze the leftovers with wax paper between. I can't wait to see how they toast up.

Love this recipe. There's so much flavor from the oats and spices (I add a little more than in the recipe) I eat these plain, no butter, no fruit, no syrup. My 18 month old loves them too. If I don't have buttermilk I use milk mixed with yogurt. These are so tender and moist but cook through easily so there's no gumminess in the middle.

Only 1 tablespoon of sugar in the whole recipe, and you don't even miss it! These are some of the best pancakes I've ever had -- and I LOVE pancakes. Light and fluffy and not heavy at all. Great little bit of texture from the whole oatmeal (I use extra thick rolled oats). Fantastic made with blueberries or topped with blueberry sauce. Even my non-whole-grain-loving fiance scarfed up these pancakes and declared them "really good." Now that I've had these, I only go back to "traditional" buttermilk pancakes for special occasions, since I try to avoid white flour these days. Hooray for tasty healthy treats like these pancakes!

You can make these gluten-free by grinding the oats into flour ahead. Use this to replace the "whole wheat flour." Omit the oil and sugar and replace with applesauce. Use plain yogurt instead of buttermilk. Add water to thin to a batter fitting for pancakes. Use extra eggs if you wish to increase the protein even more. I use more cinnamon, chopped apples, pecans, raisins, dried cranberries (at Christmas,) and give these gifts to new mothers coming home to a family to feed. Packed to feed them all in freezer bags, they heat in a minute in the microwave. Nutritious and filling --with love.

Wow - these are great! Very light, especially considering they are multi-grain. Added a mashed banana, a couple TB of ground flax, and about 1/4 chopped walnuts. Soaked the oats in vanilla soy milk and 1 1/2 TB lemon juice. Just be careful with the heat - medium is pretty hot for pancakes, I had more consistent results over medium-low.

My 5 year-old daughter declared that these were her "favorite" pancakes.

Made this for my in-laws. We are gluten free so used the suggestion of a previous reviewer to substitute buckwheat for the flour. I doubled it, adding an extra egg, honey for the sugar, regular oats ( since that's what I had), blueberries and half whole milk/half buttermilk. All liked it. I think they were heavy but that is to be expected. Maybe next time with two additional eggs it would be a bit lighter. Definitely will be using this as a base recipe!

This was my first attempt at making whole wheat pancakes and I was a little nervous, but this is a super easy recipe and it tasted really good, too. Paired it with Strawberry Compote (substituted strawberries in the Blueberry Compote recipe) and it was s winner.

Yummo! Batter was very thick, so had to thin it out. But other than that, it made big, hearty, and fluffy pancakes that were delicious even without syrup.

I finally followed the recipe exactly the way it's presented and I think I prefer this with substitutions compared to the actual. I liked the texture and spice and enjoyed them but would probably cut down on the baking powder and maybe salt. Unfortunately, this was very salty (I used unsalted butter, too). I would recommend a yogurt/milk/soymilk mixture instead of the actual buttermilk (maybe because it's too thick and salty). I also let the mixture sit a good 8 minutes in addition to the oats soaking, to allow the gluten to relax (I tend to like the pancake texture with rest). I thought after I mixed all the ingredients the batter was too thick for my taste and added more milk. I would make this recipe again, but with the aforementioned changes.

I made this recipe but substituted regular oats (which I let soak for 20 minutes), whole milk for buttermilk, and regular flour instead of whole-wheat just because I didn't have it.

Can't wait to try the recipe without subs!

Tasty, even with a few differences. I never have buttermilk in the house, so I used regular milk. I also separated the egg whites from the yolks and beat them till fluffy, then folded them in at the end. After turning the pancakes (which were very light and fluffy), I added banana slices to the pan to let them caramalize a little. Oh, I also left out the sugar entirely. What with bananas and syrup, I found it unnecessary.

Very good recipe with great flavors. The only thing I changed was to use 1/2 cup of spelt flour and 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour in place of the 3/4 cup wheat flour - the spelt adds a nice nutty taste. Also used regular oats since that was all I had. The batter is pretty runny which makes me think it might be good to make it up the night before. It could just be that it takes regular oats longer to soak up the buttermilk. Definitely a new favorite.

I used Whole Wheat Pastry flour instead of plain whole wheat flour which made the pancakes come out much lighter and fluffier like a pancake should be. I topped with sliced bananas, chopped "toasted" walnuts and maple syrup. It was YUMMY!

I just finished making these pancakes and they were very yummy indeed. I omitted the nutmeg, and used plain milk instead of buttermilk, since I'm apparently out of even vinegar this morning. The one thing I found was that the batter was very stiff, almost gelatinous, and I therefore had a hard time getting the tops to set before the bottoms burnt. Other than that, yummy, and healthy (by pancake standards).

Great recipe for relatively healthy pancakes that taste as good as regular pancakes. I was skeptical at first, but really glad I tried them. Instead of buttermilk (which I never have in my fridge), I used 1 cup of sour milk (1 tbsp apple cider vinegar & 2% milk to make up to 1 cup) and remaining amount with plain yogurt (I happen to have Balkan style thick yogurt around). As well, added ripe banana to the mix right before putting them on the pan. And I don't have unsalted butter, so used regular butter and used only 1/4 tsp salt. Only needed 1 large omega-3 egg to bind (although sounds like some people use 1-2 eggs). DELICIOUS! and EASY! It made 10 four inche pancakes using my 1/3 cup measuring cup. Will use this as a staple from now on. YUM!

We made these delicious pancakes this morning after I was dreaming of a lumberjack breakfast.

this recipe is similar to but a little easier to prepare than the bon apetite 1999 oatmeal buttermilk pancake (which needs 2 hours to sit). i tried this recipe because the total time was shorter. pancakes turned out well, loved the quick prep, light texture, and healthfulness. gave it 3 forks because i used freshly grated nutmeg and at less than 1/8 tsp, it overwhelmed the flavor of the pancake. my daughter said it was too "gingery" and needed to use more syrup than usual. i would use vanilla next time. tweaks: used 2%milk + apple cider vinegar in lieu of buttermilk (i like the previous reviewers suggestion of keeping powdered buttermilk on hand) and added 1/4 C ground flax seed. used one XL egg and had no problems with flipping or the batter being overly thick. this made 10 4" pancakes! will probably become my new base recipe.

We have been looking for a very good whole wheat pancake recipe that isn't heavy and doesn't taste doughy and this is it! Light and airy. My husband raved, and we will have these again tomorrow for breakfast! They cook fast so pay attention!

I totally messed up measuring the ingredients (grabed the 1/3 cup thinking it was the 1/2 cup) and they were still so amazing. As another cook said, they are very fault tolerant.

I have already made this twice. It so good that you do not need much syrup or topping.

Awesome recipe. Made this for our first ever "breakfast for dinner" and will be making again for sure. I added an additional egg per suggestions and also one extra tbsp of flour. Only had a cup of buttermilk and used 1% milk for the rest and came out fine. I used blueberries in some and mashed a very ripe banana for the others. Was plenty for dinner and still had some left over for my pre-workout snack. A definite keeper!

These are great spread with ricotta and topped with fruit. They're also fault tolerant; I've used white flour instead of whole wheat, rolled oats instead of quick, with no problems. This is my favorite thing to make with leftover buttermilk!

These have become my golden standard pancakes. I make them at least once a week, and often double up the recipe for a grab-and-go breakfast that will serve me well on busier mornings (they're delicious cold, too). I add a bit of grated orange peel and a tbs of grade B maple syrup for some extra flavor. I always add frozen blueberries, because they work wonderfully with the recipe. You know that powdered buttermilk? It works fantastically here. just add 3 tbs to your oats and soak in 3/4 cup water, and them 4 tbs to flour and 1 cup water to wet ingredients.

These are fabulous! Here are a few changes I made, as my first try according to the recipe yielded somewhat mushy pancakes. 2nd time I made the following changes: regular rolled oats for bite and texture. a little more baking soda for some more rise. a little more whole wheat flour. a tad more salt. They came out PERFECT this a.m. with the changes I made to the recipe. Definitely made for an excellent birthday brunch, and beautiful lazy morning breakfast.

I have made a LOT of whole grain pancake recipes and this one is tops! I used 1 c buttermilk + 5/8 c milk, to thin it out, otherwise followed the recipe (except I used salted butter). I used white whole wheat flour. The pancakes were delicious and I like that they are all whole grain. They were not too heavy or too wet like some other recipes. The spice level is just right. This made eight 5" diameter pancakes for me, using a ~1/4c ice cream scoop.

I made this for supper last night and they were great! Great taste, hearty but not heavy. I did add an extra egg as someone recommended, and used old-fashioned oats. I used yogurt thinned with water. I will definitely make these again.

These pancakes were absolutely delicious...the cinnamon and nutmeg are perfect complements to the hearty whole wheat. The only thing stopping me from giving it 4 stars is that it took forever for them to cook! They were also very hard to flip on the griddle, but this is solved by adding another egg. My favorite variations: -Use 2 cups of buttermilk and a little bit of skim milk to thin out, add extra egg, add 1/2- 1 more teaspoon cinnamon (makes perfect pancakes!!!) -Substitute 3 tbsp. unsweetened applesauce instead of the butter to make them lower in calories and fat -Make waffles by using 3 eggs -Thin it out a lot and add vanilla to make a pancake similar to a crepe

I, too, used a low fat yogurt in place of buttermilk. The texture was awesome, fluffy on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside.

One of the best "healthy" pancake recipes I've tried. Used nonfat yogurt thinned with some milk instead of buttermilk, so might have been less rich than intended. Stuck to the pan some. Great with real maple syrup, really conquers the pancake craving.

Very good. These are a heartier pancake. I used old fashioned oats instead of quick cooking and it was fine. I also added a tablespoon of flax seeds to the dry ingredients which turned out nicely. Will definitely make these again.

These pancakes were fantastic. I used skim milk to thin out the batter a little, and went lighter on the sugar. Soaked old- fashioned oats in the buttermilk while I mixed the other ingredients. Next time, I will try using powdered buttermilk (or maybe milk + lemon juice) since buttermilk is not an ingredient I usually have around. Could also try molasses instead of sugar for a slightly different take. I love the cinnamon and nutmeg - awesome. Will make these for years to come!

We got 10 pancakes (not the 4 stated in the serving size), and I probably will thin the batter a bit with milk next time too. I didn't have quick-cooking oats so I used just regular oats, and it worked fine. The pancakes are very tasty, and the hint of cinnamon was a delight. I briefly sauteed some bananas and served with maple syrup. My preschooler ate 3 whole pancakes, which is a sign of how yummy they were! These pancakes are a great way to replace processed ingredients with "whole foods".

For a "healthy" pancake, these were excellent. I loved the subtle hint of cinnamon. The batter was a little thick and I had to add more milk, but other than that, these were perfect!

This is absolutely perfect. I suffered with regular pancakes yesterday, and was almost convinced I am a pancake disaster. But no!!! These pancakes just worked!!!

My quest for the perfect whole-wheat oatmeal pancake ends here! No need to ever try another recipe. I did add extra buttermilk to make the batter thinner, but still only got 12 pancakes. I'll definitely double the recipe next time, and will try adding raisins.

Excellent. As others have said, the flavour is much better than with usual pancakes. I served them just with maple syrup, but will try them with blueberries or apples next time. This is a guilt-free way to eat pancakes, and best of all they are filling but light.

Rating: 0
These are really good and more filling that a typical pancake. The next time I make them, I'm putting an apple topping on them. They're almost like oatmeal cookies.

Great recipe! Best whole-grain pancake recipe I have tried. I sprinkled organic, frozen blueberries over the batter after pouring onto the skillet. Also used rolled oats instead of quick-cook and it was fine.

I got 14 pancakes from this recipe. They were excellent & much more healthful than the usual breakfast fare. I fixed them for a big family get together & everyone asked for the recipe.

Very good pancakes! Out of curiosity, how many pancakes did you make with this batter? I found it was pretty thick and didn't end up making as many pancakes as I expected. Perhaps should thin batter nxt time to make it spread a little better?

These are indeed very good. I've used the batter for waffles, just added a little more buttermilk, as the batter is very thick. I can see this becoming a standard recipe in my house.

Excellent recipe! I added a taste of vanilla extract as well. Great with blueberries...

I was surprised how good these pancakes were. I have been trying to use my whole wheat flour for months and now I found a way to do so. Excellent pancakes and much better than any box.

These pancakes were exceptional...I used white whole wheat flour. My son, who normally isn't a pancake person, couldn't stop telling me how good they were!

These pancakes are divine. If you are tired of the lackluster flavor in an ordinary buttermilk pancake, try these hearty, healthy pancakes with maple syrup. These will be the ones I choose when company comes. Yum! LKF,
