My husband loved this. I chose not to use the bun and simply placed the fish on top of a plate of the wasabi coleslaw. It's just as good without the added carbs.

A quick and easy way to whip up a fancy tasting lite lunch.

Very simple and delicious fish sandwich. If you like fish and horseradish, you will love this recipe.

I've made this a couple times and I love it! You might want to add a little more mayo as the sandwhich can get dry if there's a lot of bread. I also, make it as an entree instead of a sandwhich and just eat the grouper with the slaw on top. You can really use any mild, white fish...yummy!

This was alright. Nothing special. I'd rather have a fish sandwich w/ tartar sauce.
