Here is my changes. I like mine with a little more spice. Sub out 1/2 cup oatmeal instead of flour. Sub out 1/4 cup brown for white sugar. Cut out half the vanilla if using vanilla yogurt. Add 1/2 tsp cardamom. Add 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil.

I made so many substitutions that it is unfair to review this as listed - so here's my changes: 4oz cream cheese plus 1/4 milk and 1-1/2 tsp lemon juice for the yogurt; 1/2 walnuts and 1/2 pecans; 2oz unsweetened chocolate plus 2 oz semi-sweet chopped together. It was a delicious cake - not too sweet and not too dense. Want to make it one time with the "correct" ingredients.

if you want the cake to be heavy and moist double the banana amount or halve the other ingredients. i literally gasped when it asked for a whole stick of butter so i decided to put in half that, but because i was worried i would ruin the ratios i just halved the rest of the ingredients EXCEPT the banana- i still put in a whole cup. i didn't have any walnuts or chocolate and thought it would be sweetness overload to add equivalent so i put in a huge tablespoon of peanut butter.- so if you go full amounts, thatd be two tablespoons. it turned out really small but fantastic.

This is a moist, delicious cake. Though I am a BIG chocolate fan I don't particularly like the taste of chocolate and bananas together. Never did like banana splits:(. I did not hae plain yogurt so I used sweetened vanilla yogurt and omitted the sugar in the filling. I did like the cinnamon, however. I used a springform pan and it turned out wonderful! Definately a keeper!

Hands down, the best banana bread I've made and I make banana bread at least 6 times a year. Don't let the title fool you, the cake pan makes this cake shaped, but it's banana bread...just shorter. Really moist, great flavor! I added an additional 1/2 cup of banana because it was already peeled, used fat free plain yogurt and Guittard semi sweet baking discs chopped. Also, I left out the 2 tbls of butter for the filling/topping and it was fine. May try it next time with half butter/half applesauce to cut some of the fat.

This is a much better use of overripe bananas than your standard banana-bread recipe. My only complaint is that this serves far more than eight--I suspect this serves 16.

This is really good. I forgot about getting yogurt so I replaced it with 1/2 cup of skim milk. I also cut down the sugar for the banana batter to 1/2 cup. I baked it for about 55 minutes in a 9 in round cake pan. It came out perfect.

Thanks to those who suggested skipping the cinnamon and adding some candied ginger. I baked this in a 9-1/2 inch cake pan, and it seriously overflowed during baking. Maybe a springform pan would be better? Wonderful flavor.

This is delicious and easy! I had to leave out the nuts (husband's allergy), but I really didn't miss anything. I very much liked the bittersweet chocolate in it rather than semisweet. I thought it really added something. I will definitely make this again!

Very easy to make! I loved that it was not overly sweet. Got rave reviews from the entire office. Even the non-banana lover had a second helping:)

This was a hit at my office. I didn't make the topping as written; instead I mixed some brown sugar and cinnamon to use in the middle of the cake, then topped with walnuts and chocolate chips. I also used vanilla flavored yogurt, as that's all I could find at the market. The cake was delicious and I highly recommend giving this for a change over standard banana bread.

I made a number of changes based on reviewers' experiences - with the goal of making this more dessert and less breakfast bread. I omitted the cinnamon, which I associate with banana bread, and added 1/4 cup very finely chopped crystallized ginger in the chocolate/walnut filling. I used 1 1/4 cups all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour to make it more like a torte. To prevent the center from being soggy, I baked this in a 9.5 inch circular glass cake pan. It worked well, and it had the added benefit of allowing me to cut it into long slices that were more elegant for dessert. I served this with vanilla ice cream, which cut the richness and the spice. It was wonderful!

Because of a dairy allergy I used coconut yogurt (vanilla flavored since Whole Foods was out of plain), and margarine instead of butter. Also used 3/4 of a cup of Guittard Akoma Extra Bittersweet Chocolate Chips and replaced walnuts with pecans. Will definitely make again next time I have some overripe bananas.

I really like this combination of bananas & chocolate. It was definetly a hit, no leftovers!!!

A yummy treat! I made it over the summer and my friends all begged for the recipe. They now consider it my specialty! I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, just to make it a little healthier.

I replaced the walnuts with hazelnuts since banana-chocolate-hazelnuts is one of my favorite flavor combinations. It is delicious and easy.

I used 4 bananas and added more chocolate chips because I wanted this to be more of a dessert cake than a coffee cake. It still cooked up fine but the texture remained like a coffee cake. After a day or so it also dried out quite a bit despite covering it up nicely. It was good, but for me I prefer other banana cakes that I've tried. The addition of chocolate was deceptive - it was still a coffee cake style and not as sweet and moist as I would have expected.

A true crowd pleaser - my entire family devoured it. Fast & simple recipe.

I loved this cake. I used sour cream instead of yogurt and semi-sweet chocolate chips. It's definately more of a coffee cake than your usual banana bread recipe. If I wanted banana bread I would still use my Grandma's recipe, but for a coffee cake I loved this!

Great cake- made it for a Sunday brunch and it was perfect. Put buttered parchment paper on bottom of pan to make sure it would come out of pan easily. Made it in advance and froze it.

Great little snack cake. I wasn't looking at the recipe when I made it, so I forgot the cinnamon and put all of the chocolate mixture in the middle. It still turned out very tasty.

I used semi-sweet choc. chips and the result wasn't half-bad. A little sweet, even though I reduced the sugar in the recipe but this cake is like an indulgent child's dessert, sweet, soft, with the occasional nut. A rich bread.

Excellent way to use leftover bananas. I used 4 instead of 3 but I should have stuck to 3 because it was a little raw in the middle.

This was absolutely the best banana cake I have ever had. I will make it again and again. Very moist! Perfect.

This cake is more like a banana bread, but the chocolate and nuts make it oh so much better. The combination of the banana and dark chocolate chunks is absolutely delicious. I made some yesterday, just had a leftover piece, and want to finish off the rest right now (but I will show restraint so that I can enjoy it longer). You won't be dissatisfied with this recipe.

I saw this prepared in Alexis Stewart's blog and it looked so good so I thought I'd try - It's awesome! I only had 0% fage yogurt so I used that instead - it isperfect. Will definitely make again.

Delicious and very easy to make. Liked the chocolate and walnut topping. Will for sure make it again.

I thought this was very good. I didn't have yogurt so I used sour cream. I didn't bother turning it out of the pan, just sliced and served it right from the pan. Also, I baked it for an extra 10-15 minutes as it was still quite runny in the middle after 40 minutes.

The half fork results from the average of the ratings that reviewers have given the recipe. I think that is what the earlier reviewer was asking about. The recipe sounds good, but I haven't tried it yet. I will, though, very soon!

This cake was great, very moist and the chocolate goes great with the banana. I also baked slightly longer to make sure the middle was done. As for the greek yogurt, that's what I used. Although, I used the 2% fat and it turned out fine. Not sure what the 1/2 fork is that you're talking about...

Made the cake as written and it came out moist and very flavourful. I had to bake it a little longer than the recipe called for. Nice twist on plain banana bread. I will definately make it again.

An excellent moist tasty cake. I made it with 5 bananas rather than 3 and liked the strong banana flavor. I had to bake it a bit longer so that the middle of the cake was not mushy. I used a 9" square glass baking dish. I will make it often; everyone loved it.

Before I make this cake, does anyone know if I use Greek yogurt instead of regular yogurt. I never use regular yogurt anymore. Banana Chiffon cake is my son's favorite, but I would be willing to try this one if I get an answer. I'll keep checking back. Thanks in advance P.S. How does one make 1/2 fork?

Wow! This was awesome! I just used regular chocolate morsels, low-fat yogurt and pecans (didn't have walnuts). Yum.

I thought this recipe was great...and my family loved it as well. I didn't have yogurt so I used sour cream. I also ran out of sugar so I used light brown sugar for the filling/topping which turned out great. The only thing was that it took longer to cook than the recipe said...an hour instead of 35-40 min. I would definitely make this again for a brunch.

Outstanding, great ratio of flavor for effort involved

My boyfriend loved this cake; I thought it was good but not excellent. This kind of reminds me of Ben & Jerry's Chunky Monkey in cake form. The cake is pretty dense but has with great banana flavor without being too sweet. Would make a good coffee cake, but not quite an after-dinner dessert. I really liked the walnut, cinnamon sugar and butter topping. I only had nonfat Greek yogurt, so I used half yogurt and half buttermilk. Not sure I would make this over my Cook's Illustrated banana bread recipe.

this was good but was really more like banana bread with chocolate than a cake. Next time I will stick with the healthier banana bread recipe I have and try another recipe if wanting a cake.

Easy and excellent - much better on day 2 when all the flavours have set. Will send to my kids at university for Valentines Day!

One of the most delicious banana baked goods I've ever made. Did not have yogurt so I used sour cream instead, along with Ghirardelli bittersweet chips. Really easy and yummy.

Fabulous!!!! I made this over the weekend and my family and co- workers all thought it was great. I didn't roast the walnuts and could only find 60% cacao at the grocery store, but it was still great. This would make a great 'coffee cake' at a breakfast or brunch get-together. I'm laminating this recipe!!!
