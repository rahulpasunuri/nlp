Very quick and easy with a nice healthy light taste. However, I did add a splash of Bragg's vinegar just to add a little more flavor and instead of sugar I used stevia.

I've made this twice in the past week, with minor modifications based on what I have around (lime juice instead of lemon, scallions for red onions, etc.) For those who say it's too much for 2 people, I doubled the recipe for three salad eaters and we ate almost all of it -- the number this will serve really depends on your salad-eating habits.

This recipe should be halved at least if for two people. I personally would add much less onion. I recommend adding chopped peanuts. Nice change from cole slaw, and I will make again and continue to adjust to taste.

My only quibble with this recipe is the fact that it's much more than two servings. It's great the next day, though, so definitely not a problem having an overabundance. I used a coleslaw mix and added in the onions rather than fussing with the cabbage and carrots. The only change I'd make next time is cutting back a bit on the salt. I'd start with 1/2 portion and adjust from there.

added grilled tofu, lime juice, used sesame instead of veggie oil, added red bell pepper and flax seeds.

I thought this was very good. I added a dash of fish sauce and a dash of sesame oil, and crushed peanuts on the top. The coriander and mint make this dish.

Served this a part of a slightly Asian meal. We all enjoyed it . But I had doubled the recipe to serve five. No need, it will serve five as written. Will see how it is as a left- over tomorrow.

Crunchy and refreshing. Followed the advice of the reviewer from Newport (sesame oil, fish sauce, lime juice), and added a minced jalapeno, plus replaced the carrot with half a red pepper cut into matchsticks. Definitely better to keep salad and dressing apart until ready to serve to maintain the crunch.

I made this to serve with the Thai Shrimp Curry also on this site. It was the perfect accompaniment--light, refreshing and flavorful. A mandolin does come in handy for all that grating/slicing.

I thought this salad was easy and delicious. I added some toasted cashews, which worked well, but otherwise made as directed.

This was delicious and went great with our chicken satay. As suggested by a previous reviewer, I used the dressing for the Thai Cucumber salad with Peanuts, adding a few drops of sesame oil and substituting a dash of Asian red pepper sauce (Sri Racha brand) for the jalapeño. Instead of red onion I used scallions sliced on a sharp diagonal. To reduce carbs I used Splenda instead of sugar in the dressing and omitted the carrots, but added mandoline-cut strips of red bell pepper. Also included the roasted peanuts from the other salad. Great combination with the mint and the cilantro; will be interested to try it with basil. With the cabbage and peppers and peanuts, a very nutritious salad.

Love this salad. Very light and fresh. Added some thin slices of red pepper for even more color and crunch.

This was delicious, but it actually works better with the dressing for the Thai cucumber salad w/ roasted peanuts (from this site)! When I make this I cut down on the onion and increase the carrot, just because I love carrot & found it was too oniony. I also dice up the onion reeeeaaalllly fine and mix it all in - I like it better that way b/c you get subtle onion flavour w/out biting into big onion chunks.

My husband and I loved it. I added some chopped roasted peanuts.

This was very, very good. I served it with a spicy marinated Chinese chicken dish, and it was fresh, light and crunchy. Took the leftovers for lunch, and it was still good. I'll definately make again.

Made sans cilantro, but otherwise followed recipe. Husband loved it. Very refreshing. Served with Shrimp Brazilian Stew which was a great complement.

Great recipe, I also added Thai basil to the salad and used Napa cabbage. Dressing needed alot of help, used lime juice instead of lemon, fish sauce in place of salt, and a tsp. of sesame oil, and a couple of TBS of seasoned rice wine vinegar, perfect. I also waited until just before serving to add the dressing, very fresh and crunchy. Served it w/ pork satay and California roll salad to rave reviews.

This was refreshing and lowfat. My husband didn't seem to care for it much but he's not a fan of cilantro. I didn't use the mint because I didn't have it, but I think it would make it even better.

Boy does this make a lot of salad. This is a very good salad, light and flavorful. There are lots of people out there who don't like cabage, but I think they might like this. I served it with coconut marinated grilled kabobs, turned into a nicely rounded meal. This could easily be made in the morning for an afternoon or evening meal. The dressing causes the cabage to condense a bit, but the flavor is very good.

Very nice and refreshing. I used lime juice and added a couple drops of fish sauce and I loved it! It is not for everyone though....but definitely try it if you like non-traditional dishes!

A great accompaniment to Thai seafood or soup dishes- especially for a light, summer dish. Definitely use nam pla, fish sauce, for a more authentic flavor. I find that preparation in advance greatly enhances the flavor, but also contributes to sogginess, which is a bad trait for a salad that lends itself to so much crunch. Using a mandoline to slice the onions and cabbage ensures perfection!

This was excellent! I did not use the mint & increased the cilantro. Made it for company & ate it all!

To make this more Thai than just "style" lime juice, not lemon should be used, and fish sauce rather than salt. Despite adding a couple of Thai chilies, this dish was really bland and boring. My husband didn't even take the leftovers to work for lunch and he'll pretty much eat anything.

I absolutely love this recipe. I have been looking for something that was similar to the cabbage salad I order at my favorite Thai restaurant, and this mimics it perfectly!! The taste is great and it is beyond easy to make.

Excellent! It was much more refreshing than regular coleslaw. I made it with Mussels with Thai Red Curry and my husband was so impressed he kept on talking about it for days. (He still does.) I added a tiny bit of fish sauce to add Thai flavor, and it worked as well (if you like fish sauce.)

A great twist on coleslaw!! Served it with grilled chicken and got rave reviews.

This is a wonderful, simple dish. We have found that it's best if made about 15 minutes before serving. As for the onion - bring on the flavor!

I had leftover cabbage from a different dish that I was determined to use - found this recipe, thought it looked kind of dull, but thought I'd give it a try. Hey! It was great! I'd agree that the onion is a tad strong, but otherwise, terrific flavor. I'll make it again.

This was not only fast but VERY easy - I did not have fresh mint so I added additional cilantro and also used red AND green cabbage. Watch out for the onion - a little goes a long way.

I LOVE IT!!! Fresh, light , healthy and easy..who could ask for anything more?

This is an easy and satisfying recipe. I made this in February, but - because of its minty lightness - it strikes me as especially appropriate as a summertime dish. I substituted lime for lemon and increased the amount of cilantro. Definitely a "keeper."
