These were great BUT we found the milk chocolate a little under-whelming and overly-sweet. The Nougat Whip is fantastic, though! This is a great first souffle recipe....... bitterendive.blogspot.com

Made these for a Valentine's dinner party. Made 4 big ones (doubled recipe) for each couple to share. And used semi sweet chocolate. Baked them straight from the frig and they turned out PERFECT! And the nougat whip is super yummy - I think that was the best part.

Super easy and super delicious. I baked half of them last night and the other half will be baked tonight. The batter lasts for two days. How great is that!

Awesome and easy! Souffles sound like a big deal but you can make this ahead and it's divine. I made half the souffles (4) and a full whip recipe and it was a perfect ratio. I also put it double almond for extra crunch. Will definitely make again.

This was a fantastic way to finish our valentine's dinner. We used a dark chocolate instead of milk and were quite pleased with the result. Time was short (dinner prep took longer than anticipated) so used plain whipped cream. My family raved about this souffle - it's a keeper!

This was so easy and a wonderfully light finish to our dinner. I made them about 6 hours ahead of time, put them in the refrigerator, drove them to a dinner party, re-refrigerated them and put them in the oven for 20 minutes. They puffed up high and were so airy. I enjoyed the little crunch from the almonds in the nougat--the hint of amaretto is nice.

This was absolutely fabulous and may become a "signature" dessert for me. I made it a few hours before our dinner party and then put it in the oven when we were ready for dessert. It came out puffed and warm and perfect. In response to others comments, mine definitely puffed up but probably would have puffed even more if I had not refrigerated them prior to baking. I liked the nougat but did not think it was essential to the dish. I am making this again for valentines day and will just use whipped cream with a bit of kirsch.

I was so excited to make this recipe for my milk chocolate-loving husband (and some guests), but found the souffles a bit underwhelming. To my husband's surprise, he preferred the dark chocolate souffles (also from this site---recipe includes cardamom creme anglaise) that I made recently; I think he finally gets that dark chocolate bears more chocolate flavor, which we both missed here. If I make these again, I'll try them without the chopped almonds in the nougat whip. I'm sure the almond flavor alone would have been a nice complement (and that came through with the amaretto), but we and our guests were a bit thrown by the juxtaposition of crunchy almonds and airy souffle. Just felt like an awkward texture combination... Also, while it was so helpful to prepare and chill the souffle batter in cups ahead of time, I do think I sacrificed a bit of loft in the finished souffles. Next time, if I stick with the make-ahead method, I'd remove them from the fridge and let them come closer to room temp, at least, before I pop them in the oven. Anyone think this is a terrible idea?

A friend served this at a dinner party last night. Excellent. The souffle did not puff up as you would expect a souffle to -- I don't know if it is supposed to. Probably not since you can refrigerate it for two days before baking, which would cause the egg whites to fall. She said the recipe is very easy (She doesn't cook much, so if she says it's easy, I believe her.) I will make this recipe.

Really excellent, and I forgot to add the egg yolks! Quite rich. The nougat whip is fantastic and a must-make.
