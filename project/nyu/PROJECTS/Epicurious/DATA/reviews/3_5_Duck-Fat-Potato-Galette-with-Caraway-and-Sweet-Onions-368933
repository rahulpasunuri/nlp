I made these in individual sizes - more crispy edges for everyone - they were SO good. I used nonstick foil with a little butter to crisp. the onion flavor is very mild...i used bacon fat instead of duck fat and subbed thyme for the caraway (rye bread potatoes? huh?). anyway, they were great! I actually baked them and then set them aside on the pans, loosely covered with foil for over a half an hour. back in the oven for 10 min to heat and they were perfect.

This was an excellent start for a potato dish, there a variety of ways to modify this recipe to meet your tasts. I was going to make this last night and only leave out the duck fat/bacon fat, but as I was getting my prep going I discovered I had no caraway seeds. I substituted fresh rosemary and it worked very well. I also just went two layers of onion and three potato layers. My wife said this a keeper. The presentation is also very nice for a pototo dish. I think this can be made with a lot less fat as well.

Im surprised this didnt get more reviews - i mad these as individual galettes and it was SO GOOD. the edges do get almost like potato chips, so crackly. I used half bacon fat and half olive oil (plus the butter). and thyme instead of caraway. i fit 3 rounds on a half sheet pan lined with buttered nonstick foil. and I wound up reaheating them after my main dish freed up the oven and they were still great. use far more salt and pepper than called for.

This potato dish was good...but I had higher expectations. It's basically a roasted potato dish, I'm not sure why it's called a galette (other than the round shape it's supposed to be). One word of caution - use a rimmed baking sheet. I didn't, and the fat dripped off the sheet, and the parchment caught fire...

I made it exactly as directed, and and the result was delicious and easy to make. This is going to be a go-to for a nice side for a fancier dinner. The best part is the crunch top layers, it's almost like they're fried by the end. Next time, I might ditch the spring form and just do layers across a sheet pan and monitor the cooking so there can be more crunchy delicious layers. It's worth the duck fat, I bought it at Wegmans for $5 and it doesn't go bad for months in the fridge.

Liked but didn't love this recipe. Didn't follow the instructions exactly as I needed to double it so instead of the free form on a baking sheet baking method I cooked it in a enameled cast iron casserole pan. This may well have been a problem as the sides didn't get crispy. The best part was the top which did get crispy. So my rating may well be my own fault. I used truffle salt instead of kosher and that was not a mistake! The dish just needed more oomff. I didn't taste the duck fat so much. I am a huge Potatoes Anna fan to which this dish is similar but I think it needs some fresh herbs and, if I make it again I'd take the trouble to caramelize a lot more onions before layering them between the potatoes.

after I prepared the potatoes, they sat for about 15 minutes before I put them in the oven. Lots of 'juice' ran out from them so I soaked it up with a paper towel before baking. used non-stick foil. very good recipe!

These potatoes taste great; although I have never met a potato that I didn't like! I made them with bacon fat and skipped the caraway and they still were delicious. I might try thyme or rosemary next time. I did have trouble seperating them from the foil. I think generously buttered parchment is the way to go. As they bake, they tend to flatten and spread a little. They will look exactly like the picture.
