I'm trying to figure out what I did with this recipe. I made the chickpea Confit and cooked it for the 45 minutes. Being carful not to brown contents. I let cool and refridgerated overnight. The next day I made the Chickpea spread using the Confit. Is the amount of sun dried tomatoes correct? I followed the directions and what I got was horrible. The chickpeas in oil were hard and chunky. No matter how long I processed them. I consider myself to be an above average cook. Is there something missing in this recipe? My spread is very red in color. I used 1 bag of sundried tomatoes... no where near the 40 called for in the recipe. This recipe looked so yummy since I love Hummus but.....HELP!!!
