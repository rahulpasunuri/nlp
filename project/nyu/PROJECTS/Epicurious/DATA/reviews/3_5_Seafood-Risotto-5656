This risotto travelled well to Christmas Eve dinner at my Mom's assisted living place but barely served 4. I followed the suggestions about the saffron and a squeeze of lemon juice at the end and added some clams as well. Delicious but I'll increase the receipe next time.

Great recipe. I used homemade fish stock instead of water/clam juice, and also a mix of tiger shrimp, scallops, squid rings and marinara. And double the amount of garlic.

This recipe is not only delightful but flexible enough to be manipulated. I used a mix of shrimp, scallops & calamari, & substituted seafood broth for clam juice & canned tomatoes w/Italian spices for fresh tomatoes. Also used dry vermouth for the wine. My wife & I agree that this was a keeper good enough for company.

I've done this recipe many times, and every single time people come back for seconds and all guests leave the table happy. I do add the shitake mushrooms and drop the shrimp peel directly into the water/clam juice mix. I let it simmer while chopping other ingredients. A little heat and lemon juice right before plating does not hurt either :) - Makes for great leftovers too.

Delicious!!! My guests all had seconds. I followed the recipe but also added shitake mushrooms and 1/2 cup of the wine (towards the end). I'll make this one again for sure.

My boyfriend and I devoured this.....super yummy. I did resist the urge to add cheese (a no-no with seafood as far as we Italians are concerned) Just added a little red pepper flake for some kick. Super easy and delicious.

Phenomenal. I've made it with numerous variations now, and the best is simply: add a pinch of saffron. Otherwise, the recipe is great as is. And please don't add dairy to a seafood risotto, unless you want my little old Italian grandmother to spin in her grave ^_~

Wow really good. left out the tomatoes and used some old bay for extra flavor . Also added a touch of cream it didn't need it but I had it . mmm can't wait for lunch tomorrow.

Due to weather, I was along for Christmas and decided to treat myself to this recipe. Made as written it was excellent, be sure not to overcook the shrimp and scallops and be sure to add their cooking liquid to the rice. I agree with previous reviewer, no cheese is needed for this risotto, you will lose the fresh taste of the shellfish. Of course I had leftovers so today I formed some of leftovers into three to four inch patties and rolled in beaten egg, then panko breadcrumbs and fried until golden brown. Add tarter sauce and fresh chopped dill for a delicious brunch.

I made this recipe as is, the only change was I added the asparagus alongside the seafood and used Trader Joe's frozen seafood mix to keep the costs down. Delicious! My guests loved it.

Im not the type to follow directions for recipe, but this one, with a few tweaks was very good. I added some extra seafood, and garlic and onion powder to shallots while sauteeing. It brought out the flavors better. Also I didnt use two bottles of clam juice but substituted the rest of the liquid with chicken stock. Overall- a very tasty meal!

Upon reading this recipe and reviews I could see how the result could be bland. To ensure a bold flavor without bringing in butter or cheese, I stayed true to the Seafood theme with a few tweaks: Right before toasting the rice, add 2 cloves of minced garlic to the shallots for 30 seconds 2) Substitute fish stock for the water portion of the clam juice mixture (I bought frozen Stock from the fish market) and add a few strands of saffron to the broth as it simmers 3) season theshrimp/scallops with fresh cracked pepper before cooking and when adding them to the risotto, also add any/all juices from the pan. 4) add fresh lemon zest to right before serving to each plate. I served this to guests and not a single morsel of risotto was left on a plate!

I loved this! Thanks for the suggestion of the shitake mushrooms--they were a wonderful addition. I used beautiful bay scallops and tiger shrimp from the Delaware shore. Really made all the difference. My only suggestion to others would be to really make sure you like stewed tomatoes before making this recipe. Also, this made surprisingly delicious leftovers. Leaving it overnight really gave the flavors a chance to come together. Brilliant!

This was by far one of the best recipes I have ever made! I had gone to a restaurant last week and had Seafood Risotto. I was looking for a recipe so that I could make it myself and this recipe was just about exactly what I had eaten at the restaurant! My family loved it too! The only extra I added was paprika when I was cooking the fish.

Rating: 4
the key to this dish is the clam juice! and yes, i added a bit of parm at the end too, just as i mix in the seafood. to cut on cost, use the frozen bag of seafood mix from trader joe's (scallop, shrimp, squid) - it is the perfect amount for this dish!

I substitue chicken broth for the water, I add chopped clams, and chopped asparagus. And, I know the rule no cheese with fish, I made an exception for this dish and added freshly grated parmesan

I must disagree with everyone else's irresistable desire to add cheese, cream and other typical risotto condiments...you're missing out on the clear taste of the sea. Still, like everyone else I tinkered. For those of you that suggest the dish is bland (a complaint I couldn't imagine) I added chopped watercress at the end. The watercress added some additional color but also a peppery hotness that chased any notion of bland away. I also added some chopped squid since I had some left over (in addition to the scallops & shrimp). The squid intensified the sea flavor. This recipe is now in my regular repertoire. We loved it.

After making this three times, I think I've tweeked it to perfection for my and my family's taste. This is what works best for us and it is definitely delicious. I make a double recipe to make sure there are left overs. Do not use fresh tomatoes, use canned diced tomatoes available with basil and oregano seasonings included. Do not use asparagus, as some reviewers suggested but definitely use the shitake. You'll need to add about a cup of heavy cream at the end. Just after the shrimp. If your timing is off a bit in terms of getting everything and everybody to the table, add chicken broth to keep it from getting too thick. Do not add oregano (there is enough in the canned diced tomatoes) as another reviewer suggested, instead (and this is very important) add one cup or more of fresh basil after the shrimp, before or after the cream. I have included scallops before but they are not necessary and I omit them because my kids don't like them. When you saute the garlic, do so with the shitake. Add the shitake without the liquid to the rice before the shrimp. YOu'll probably need to add a bit more olive oil to the skillet, then saute the shrimp. Do not put parmesan in while cooking but have plenty available for diners to top the risotto according to their preference.

Outstanding. Used leftover broth from boiling crabs instead of clam juice; added diced zucchini and sliced mushrooms near the end. Next time I'd add some cayenne or paprika -- otherwise, just delicious.

Rating: 3
I know it sounds somewhat sacriligeous with the Itallian flavorings but I added about 3/4 tsp Spanish smoked paprika and the flavor become so much more developed. Without it, the dish was quite good but with it....it was delicious. I'll definitely make it again. If you haven't discovered Spanish paprika, I would highly recommend that you find a store that sells it or order it from an internet source like LaTienda.com. I have sweet, bittersweet and hot. (I used bittersweet for this recipe.)

I felt the recipe was bland however I think if a fresh herb such as basil is added, it would brighten up the dish. Who can turn down scallops and shrimps!? Otherwise pretty easy to make - just needs more flavor.

I really enjoyed this recipe, everyone had seconds! I added a little bit of yellow squash, sage, shitake mushrooms, and parmesean cheese that complemented the recipe wonderfully.

WOW!!! This was awesome. I just made this for my husband and he LOVED it! I have always been somewhat afraid of risotto due, I guess, to the "time-consuming" bad press. I followed this recipe to the letter, with the exception of adding additional seafood, asparagus and mushrooms. It was sooooo delicious and took under an hour. It will definitely be a company quality recipe and I can't wait to make it for friends! Go for it!!

My Italian mother has a term describing bland food -- "white." She would definitely describe this recipe as "white," but with a few modicfications it has become a new family favorite. First, it's essential to use shallots and arborio rice -- otherwise, it's just a rice casserole. Second, I recommend adding ample amounts of basil, minced garlic, garlic powder and oregano. (For non-Italians, "ample amounts" means add more than common sense might dictate.) I use fresh basil and oregano and it's great. And although it appears to be offensive to some epicurious users, I put grated parmesan on the table and everyone usually likes the dish better with a little cheese on top. Finally, I usually cheat and use pre-cooked frozen shrimp and scallops. I thaw them out and then saute them for a minute or two as described. It definitely isn't as good as fresh but it significantly reduces prep time.

Excellent! No clam juice in the house, so I boiled the shrimp shells in water for 30 minutes; quartered sea scallops; used 1/2 cup shallots and 1/2 cup onion; and added 1/2 cup parmegiano reggiano at the end. Really fabulous...

This is a GREAT dish! I have made it numerous times and it ALWAYS gets rave reviews.

I loved the flavor of this recipe! However, and maybe this is simply my problem, but the texture seems gravy-like to me. I've tried making it 3 times, cooking the risotto from less to more time, and the consistency is always gravy-ish. It may be the type of risotto I use, who knows. The flavors and indredients are lovely together. I might just have to find another recipe and try again! :)

Excellent dish! I forgot the clam juice so I simmered the shrimp shells in water as others suggested. I used chicken stock for the rest of the liquid since that's all I had. In addition to scallops and shrimp, I added diced baby portabellas and asparagus tips. At the very end I put in 1/4 cup parmesan and 1/4 cup heavy cream. The dish is great with or without those last two items. I did need to add salt and black pepper.

Made this for Mother's Day & knocked Mom's socks off. Added asparagus & lobster as suggested by others, & made sure to keep adding broth right to the end. A beautiful & flavorful dish. Gave me the courage to try other risottos (previously ended in disaster). I think that sauteing the seafood at the end is a very good trick.

This was phenomenal! I made it last night for a Valentine's Day dinner party and it was devoured with rave reviews from all. Took other reviewers suggestions and made the shrimp stock, increased the garlic, used sea instead of bay scallops, and sauted the seafood until just barely opaque. I also added squid rings to the seafood mix, and separately steamed mussels in white wine and stirred them (still in the shells) into the risotto at the end. My advice to Raymond from Dallas: risotto continues to thicken up a bit after it's taken off the heat, so once last addition of a small amount of stock at that point may prevent it from becoming "concrete."

Rating: 2
Well I followed all of the tips in the reviews like making the shrimp stock, adding asparagus, and more garlic and I did not think this dish tasted very good. It setup like concrete. I mean I was adding stock to it until just before I served it and it did not have that creamy consistency that I come to expect in risotto.

Rating: 3
Delicious! I took the advice of two reviewers. I simmered the shells in the 2.5 cups of water called for and prepared the seafood until just barely opaque. Great suggestions! I also added lobster and asparagus. I par-boiled the asparagus and added it at the end. It was delicious. This is a simple and elegant meal. Champagne compliments it nicely! Can't wait to have the left-overs!

This is an outstanding risotto recipe! My only suggestion would be to saute the shrimp so that it is barely opaque. It will fully cook once you add it to the risotto.

I have now made this recipe several times, and each time I tweak it a little differently. I always use leeks, no shallots, and recommend never skipping on the clam juice. Shrimp, halibut pieces, scallops, clams, mussels (the last two rinsed well!) all work. In summer, use juicy new tomatoes with your own Italian seasoning instead of cans.

Rating: 3
Made this last night for my husband and mother. They loved it!! Instead of plain water, I made a light shrimp broth by simmering the shells in the water for about 20 minutes (while I prepared the ingredients) then combined it with the clam juice. I also added more garlic. If you are serving hearty eaters, however, plan on this recipe serving 4 instead of 6.

Rating: 4
Totally agree with excellent previous reviews.. and I took their advice: added more shallots, garlic and parsley. Also used 1/2 lb. of shrimp, scallops and lobster respectively. As I usually do with risotto, used 1/2 olive olive oil & butter, added 1/2 C. good Parmesean at the end, and used vegetable broth combined with clam juice. RAVE reviews from friends for dinner as one of "my" best risottos ever.

This is a great recipe -- Even my husband "aka Mr. Finicky" liked it. I couldn't find Italian-style stewed tomatoes so I used regular stewed tomatoes and added 1/2 tsp. dried Italian seasoning. I also replaced the bay scallops with sea scallops, quartered. I think the larger scallops are sweeter. I can't wait to make this dish for my friends.

This is a wonderful dish with surprising nuance. Make the scallops and shrimp slightly underdone and let them finish in the risotto just before you serve. Grilled asparagus with olive oil and a splash of balsamic vinegar is a perfect side dish.

One of the best recipes I've ever made. I made it for my husband on Valentine's Day. It tastes wonderfully extravagant but is simple to make. The only thing I would change would be to cut back on the olive oil just a tad (6T was a lot and made just a tiny bit oily). Hopefully this change won't alter the integrity of the recipe because I know that you need to use enough oil to coat the arborio rice.

I have never made risotto before so I didn't have anything to compare this recipe to. I used arborio rice which came out thick, creamy, & too heavy. I followed the directions exactly. We didn't care for this recipe even though we love seafood dishes. Would be reluctant to make risotto again.

LOVED this! easy to make, and leftovers are wonderful. I splashed some sherry over the leftovers and it was even better. I will say that we made this for a special occasion and, while delicious (and expensive - we used fresh shrimp and sea scallops), it doesn't have the look or feel of an elegant dish. For our next special occasion we might serve this as an appetizer and find another main course.

Very nice! 3-4 chopped fresh tomatoes added to the rice one step before the shrimp/scallops enhances the flavor and makes the dish more pleasing to the eye. Why use cans when you can use the real thing?! Also works well doubling the amount of shrimp and omitting the scallops for those cooking for non-scallop lovers.
