I took a few shortcuts and purchased the croutons and white fish stock at Whole Foods. I followed another reviewer's advice and used the whole fennel bulb and fronds which was successful. I think I will turn up the heat (spice) just a bit the next time I make this. Perhaps I would do that by making a rouille that has a bit more kick to it. That way people who don't like extra spicy don't have to add the rouille. Excellent dish that I will make again for a dinner party or special event!

SO GOOD! It's also relatively easy to make. My family always rates the meals and my BF is hard to please, he actually gave this a 10 and said numerous times that he loved it!! I adored the rouille and will actually quadruple the recipe next time so we can add even more to the soup!! We also added some lime to our soup as thats simply a tradition in our family when eating a soup such as this. We also like ours with a kick so I added a lot of the hot spice. I didnt make my own croutouns but bought texas toast croutons instead and they too were excellent with it. Enjoy!!

Whoops - forgot to say that I cooked the soup with about 3 celery hearts cut into 1 inch pieces and about 1/4 cup fresh parsley.

Maybe this is a fail-safe recipe. Maybe Bouillabaisse done wrong still tastes great & shows beautifully. Or perhaps I just erred in all the right ways- I didn't stick to the rules but this was nothing short of FANTASTIC. My changes were many (due only to what I had on hand, which dictates what I make in the first place): 1) Didn't have fennel fronds so used about 1 1/2 tbl of toasted fennel seeds crushed in a mill. 2) After using 4 small peeled tomatoes it didn't look red enough so I added a tbl of tomato paste. 3) No fish stock - oy, one would think this to be a sacrilege omission- but low sod chick stock got it done rather nicely and I suspect its got everything to do with the saffron. 4) I already had sage roasted potatoes on hand from the night before so used them w/skin on instead of peeled & raw. 5) No live lobster. Who has that just lying around? I defrosted about 1/2 lb of shrimp instead. Don't omit the Rouille - it adds depth and texture. This ones a keeper for sure. Just not sure that it'll freeze so well.

This was my first time making this dish, and I am pleased with how it turned out. But I was disappointed in the lack of a fennel taste by just using the fronds. Next time I'll add the fennel bulb to the stock. I also thought it tasted a bit too oily. I'll cut back on it next time. I omitted the lobster and used cod, shrimp and mussels, but next time I'll definitely add the lobster. Overall a great recipe that you can tweak to your liking!

JUST GREAT! EVERYONE ALWAYS LOVES IT!!! The only thing that I change on the recipe is the lobster, I don't use it, I just use fish and no seafood. AGAIN, ALL I CAN SAY IS GREAT!!!

I applaud the effort to "define" the fish in a true bouillabaisse. It is perfectly normal, in fact absolutely essential, in the wine world with AOC, DOC, DOCG, etc. It's protecting a "brand" if you will, and is important to those of us who value food history, culture, etc. Otherwise they could just call it fish stew, and that's OK too! It has nothing to do with being a snob.

I guess I have a real problem with the intro on this recipe regarding the french restaurants signing a charter on the only "official" fish to be included in bouillabaisse. That snobbery is just ridiculous. Made this with local seafood here in the southeast U.S. It was o.k. But if you really want a terrific seafood stew recipe without the attitude, search on "cioppino". Made in the USA is best!!

Divine! The best bouillabaisse I have done so far. A keeper! We used lobster, halibut, haddock. The rouille is a great kick! love it and lots of compliments on it.

I exceeded my expectations with this recipe. I modified it just a little by adding a small can of tomatoe sauce, fennel, leeks, hand full of diced carrots, and chopped fingerling potatoes. Almost all organic except for white fish stock and seafood which came from a fish market (wild caught). I used Wholefoods brand frozen scallops and shrimp and added just before i cooked in the fresh mussels. Key is adding in the fish by cook time so not to over cook.

Outstanding, and what a crowd pleaser! We did it without lobster, using instead a large cooked crab. We saved the legs for the very last minute of cooking, but put the back into the stock mixture. And since the recipie called for fennel fronds, I put the fennel bulb into the stock along with two salmon heads, carrot, celery, onion, etc. I also added paprika, a small can of diced stewed tomatoes, and tarragon, along with extra saffron and fennel. We used juliened, diced leeks instead of onion in the broth. We used a variety of frozen fish from Trader Joes that had defrosted when our power supply to the freezer was cut off for 48 hours. So, this recipie works well with fish that isn't fresh.

After eating this in it's birth place, this is pretty close. Food 911 has a better one. Must use saffron and fennel. If you don't like the bread crumbs, use the traditional potato. Boil, one, and puree in with other ingrediants for the rouille

Fennel was a real plus. I used the bulb for the broth and the fronds for the bouillabaisse. Also, an interesting take on rouille. Contrary to a complaint from another reviewer that there was nothing in it to make it red or "rust colored," the cayenne worked well and really zinged it up.

Nice... Added about a teaspoon Herbs de Provence, left out the saffron... Will keep making it a little different each time until I get it right.

This was wonderful. I was not familiar with Roille and almost didn't make it but it was fabulous and added a lot to the dish. I used a 10 oz lobster tail instead of a whole lobster and about 1/2 lb of shrimp. I used cod, tilapia and some fish we caught in Apalachicola Bay--probably white trout. Also, I left out the fennel cuz I don't like it. I like to make something new and special on Valentine's Day for my husband and this was superb! I'd prepare this for guests cuz a lot of it could be done in advance and would be easy to put together with guests hanging around my kitchen.

A rare and wonderful dish. Those are my fiancees' words. Everyone else who tried it agreed. I put about 1/2# 51/60 ct. shrimp in mine. My fiancee wants me to put some clams in next time and I think I might.

I really dislike fennel, so I omitted it, substituting paprika and caraway seeds. I suppose this made the dish not truly bouillabaisse, but more of a seafood goulash stew, but it was terrific. I used fresh catfish, tilapia and shrimp as well as canned crabmeat.

Rave, rave, rave. I made stock from salmon bones etc using as a start for it the leftover poaching liquid from Joy of Cooking's recipe which has white wine, peppercorns,whole coriander,etc. Added lots of leftover carrot and parsnip peelings and other veggies to the stock. The fennel fronds are essential to the broth. I omitted the lobster and added a few clams and mussels and their broth, after cooking them separately. The rouille is super. I forgot the garlic on the croutons, but with all the garlic in the rouille it didn't make any difference. I used about 2 1/2 # mixed mahi-mahi, sea bass and ling cod. Everybody who tasted this dish went nuts for it.

I was upset about the rouille. 3/4 cup of bread crumbs has to be wrong. Otherwise the dish was great. It's a trick to prevent the lobster from getting overcooked.

Who keeps 10 cups fish stock in the pantry? Where in the rural midwest does one scrounge up fish heads a few hours before dinner time. I improvised and it was still a great recipe. In lieu of fish stock I used white wine, clam juice, juice from home canned tomatoes, and enough water to reach the desired degree of "soupy". I used mussels, orange roughy, and crab claws for the shellfish. It was Great!

Fantastic! So far the best recipe for bouillabaisse I've made. I didn't use the lobster, but the dish was great with turbot, cod and rockfish. Making the broth is not for the squeamish - fish heads, fish heads...

Great recipe. I made it for the 1st time tonight, I'm still perspired from the heat of the bowls! I was able to find Sculpin, (scorpionfish, one of the "required" fish from Francophile dictate), at my Japanese supplier here in LA. Only comment, I don't think that 3lbs of fish was required for 9 cups of stock, 2lbs would suffice, w/ croutons and lobster. My left-overs needed more liquid, which I had. Rouille is integral, it's a powerful kicker that puts the dish over the top. Garlicy result, not good for a first date, unless everyone enjoys the strong emulsion, but hey, the Cote D'Azur is a romantic place!
