Recipe was a good starting point but I used comments from the other reviews and did the following: -switched scallops for Mahi Mahi -added an avocado -added half a large mango -added 3 cloves of minced garlic -cut back to 2 jalapenos -served it on small rice cakes made with purple sticky rice with some flour for binding & fried in light olive oil. It was easy to make, tasted great and got rave reviews.

Did not use coconut. Used sushi grade ahi tuna sliced small, added 1.5 avocados and this was AMAZING! Best ceviche I've ever had or made :)

I made this with tilapia. I didn't have coconut. I added one mango, two kiwis, fresh mint and fresh oregano. It was delicious.

I made this with the mangos and mint additions for a party. People loved it. Everyone wants the recipe!

No, sorry, mahi-mahi is just NOT the right fish for making ceviche. Made it dozens of times, w/ scallops, even conch while at my place waaaay down on the Yucatan. But mahi texture...well, it just ain't right...

EXCELLENT! I've used scallops, as well as Mahi Mahi depending on what is fresh and in season. You muct try- serve in a martini glass for a gorgeous appetizer. Even non-ceviche eaters will enjoy this.

I added the mango because so many suggested it, but I still thought this was horrible. A waste of nice fish, in my opinion.

This recipe was great. I used frozen, marinated mahi mahi from Trader Joe's, added a diced avocado, mango, and some rock shrimp. Tried it a second time with Chilean Sea Bass but it wasn't nearly as good as the mahi mahi.

excellent! marinated the fish for two hours or so, used fresh mint instead of the oregano and added some fresh mango. it was a hit. instead of cooking the onions and chili to lessen the bite, run cold waterover them in a sieve and let it drain well then dry on a paper towel.

I made this with flounder because I couldn't find the Mahi Mahi - It received rave reviews! I will definitely make this again

Yummy. The oregano adds an interesting and unusual flavor, but I like it. A bit too spicy, though -- and I like spicy food. I'd only use 1-2 jalapenos next time. Adding a chopped mango is a great suggestion.

This dish was excellent! and so easy to make. I made this for a dinner party and it was great. I used Ocean Trout and Tuna instead of Mahi Mahi. I did not use the Oregano and I cooked the onion and chilli before I mixed it with the fish so that it was not too strong.
