This recipe just didn't do it for me. I think the problem for me was the pieces of crystalized ginger, which even minced were unpleasant to chew and provided too strong a taste.

Very, very tasty! I don't usually review recipes, but this one is worth it. Everyone had seconds and thirds and was asking for the recipe. Definitely must use the candied ginger. This recipe will impress your company!

Too sweet, and not worth the trouble or cost (crystallized ginger is not cheap). Tasted a bit like pumpkin pie.

I live in Japan and made it with Japanese sweet potato, which aren't as sweet as yams, but it still came out great. You (and your arteries) probably could do with half the butter - it's the ginger and cinnamon flavors that really do it.

I've made this every thanksgiving for years and it's always a huge hit!!

I thought the butter was the perfect compliment to the sweet potato. I didn't have any crystallized ginger on hand so I had to use extra ground. I just made up a batch of candied ginger so I'll have to try this recipe again as written. I loved the molasses flavor.

I served the yams out of their skins mashed with the ginger-butter, and it was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. The ginger was subtle and smooth. This recipe is going to be a family staple.
