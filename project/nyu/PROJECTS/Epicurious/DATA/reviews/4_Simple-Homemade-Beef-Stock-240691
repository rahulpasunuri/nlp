Used my leftover ribs from a 17lb Xmas rib roast, this made perfect stock.

I came back to find this recipe - to give to a friend and noticed I had not left a review. This stock has changed this boullion girl forever. Yes, I make my own stock now and not just beef, vegetable and seafood too. It's good enough to be an epiphany to the masses. Ok, that's a little strong, but I really can't believe the difference this makes to any recipe you use it in.
