I thought this was a nice spread although it was not a big hit with dinner crowd.

Delicious. I didn't measure exactly, so I might have added more spices (and less oil) than called for. Added peas and turmeric and served with yogurt and rice.

One word - spicy. There are no other Indian flavors that present themselves in the dish. I even tried adding curry powder, garlic and garam masala. This seems to be a challenge with most Indian dishes I try at home.

This was a simple and tasty dish. Like other reviewers, I added garlic and turmeric. I used only a few tablespoons of oil and added a bit of water after I added the eggplant- healthier. Overall, a yummy and easy disj.

I added some cayenne and salt and I thought it was excellent... with naan from Trader Joes and over rice again the following day. Yes, could absolutely be used as a dip for crackers or sliced Naan if entertaining. I love that it is so, so healthy, vegan and very flavorful. Do not, do not forget the cilantro, and you can add more the following day. In my opinion it really brings the flavors together.

Pretty good but definately needed garlic imho

First off, make sure that you roast the eggplant thoroughly--overdone is better than underdone on this recipe. I added 1 teaspoon of turmeric, and substituted a jalapeno for the cayenne. It still tastes like it's missing something, but I can't put my finger on it...

Like another reviewer, I cut the eggplant in half and then grilled it over a low fire. This gave it a wonderful smoky flavor. This was a hit with my chicken curry dish. It is okay as a side dish, but even better as a spread on naan.

What an easy dish to make! I liked it but my husband didn't. We served it over rice as an entree - I agree with the previous reviewer and think that this would be best served as a spread.

Excellent spread for parties. I let the eggplant cool in the refrigerator and served it with crackers before dinner. Dinner guests are always looking for this when they come to my home. Did not like it as a vegtable serving with main course at dinner.

This recipe is rather bland, as is. The mixture, before the eggplant, is quite tasty, but after adding the eggplant and serving over rice, the flavor disappears. So -- I added mango chutney to the mix and all was well. I agree with previous recommendations to add something for substance. I think peas and minced carrots, along with the chutney, would make it flavorful enough. And serve the rice on the side, not mixed in! Have fun!

I am Indian and thought this recipe was just so-so...and it was NOT spicy enough. I had to add more ground chili powder and add more cumin and I also add some ground coriander seeds as well. For authentic Indian recipes, I would rather use Madhur Jaffrey or Julie Sahni or Neelam Batra.

I thought that this was not only really good, but easy to make.

probably would not make again unless i added other ingredients such as chick peas or green peas or some other serious tweaking. I only used 1/8 tsp of cayenne and found it to be as hot as i could take it. NOt a very exciting recipe even though I did roast the eggplants whole to get the added smoky flavor of eggplant.

This recipe is excellent! I've made it last night and it was a big success. I've already send it to my brother in Atlanta to tray it too. Defiantly a keeper.

We just finished eating and it was great. Used Japanese eggplants. First halved and salted the eggplants - letting them sit 15 minutes and "sweat" out the bitterness - before we grilled them. We peeled and seeded the tomatoes first, and added a little extra fresh ginger. Fresh Cilantro was crucial! Served over white and wild rice with chutney. GREAT.

I've been looking for a good bengan bharta recipe for several years. This isn't it.

I used 1 large eggplant instead of two medium eggplants. THus, the tomatoes and eggplant proportions were a little more balanced. My husband is not a big fan of eggplant. We loved it! Although I did not grill the eggplant, I followed the previous reviewers advice and roasted it whole after poking it with a fork, rubbing with olive oil and salt in a pan with a rack. The juices dripped through the rack away from the eggplant. I added lots of garlic and red pepper. It was YUMMY! We served it with aromatic jasmine rice. We will definitely make this recipe again.

This is absurdly easy to do on the grill, and it gives the eggplant a nice,smoky flavor. Wait till a night when you're grilling out anyway. When you've removed your dinner from the grill --steak, corn, whatever-- the fire will be low. Put on the eggplants that you've pierced all over with a fork, oiled and salted. Cover the grill. Let them roast about an hour, turning once or twice. You want them fairly soft and just starting to collapse. Let them cool on a deep platter, discarding the bitter juices that accumulate in the bottom of the platter before skinning the eggplant and proceeding with the recipe. Now you can refrigerate this and keep it for spicy eggplant the following night. The only OTHER thing I did to alter this recipe was to saute two minced garlic cloves with the onion. And 1/4 teasp of cayenne was plenty for me!

We loved this recipe; heat was perfect; flavor outstanding!

Great flavor and spice. We used grape tomatoes sliced in half, which gave it terrific texture. I can understand the variation in reviews: this is very spicy so if you're not a fan of heat, this might not appeal. My husband loves spice though, so it was a big hit.

I found this to be very tasty and it was a big hit at my dinner club's "Indian Night." No bitterness here, I used regular eggplants, but they were very fresh and young. I added 1/2 tsp of garam masala at the end and lots of salt. Very good "different" eggplant recipe.

Needs a LOT more salt. After that, quite good.

Sorry to be a negative voice in the midst of great reviews! Smelled great while cooking, but I thought it tasted awful! To me, the cayenne was overpowering..and I like spicy food. I was dissapointed- thought it had a bitter taste that wasn't at all what I was expecting.

This is fabulous. The 1st time I am promtped to give a review as this is the most outstanding recipe by far. Like the previous reader, I also use japanese eggplant which worked well. The left over tasted even better as the flavour developed.

This was fantastic! I doubled the recipe, used more cayenne to crank up the heat, and served with white rice. Many who ate it said that this was the first way they've been able to enjoy eggplant. The flavor really is outstanding. Thanks.

This is a great dish. I use Japanese or Asian Eggplants, which do not have the bitterness that you can sometimes encounter with the round large eggplants. I served this dish over a plate of Basmati rice. I make it at least once a month.
