I have been replacing some of the milk with yogurt and even different fruit.

Not worth the trouble! Bland flavor and grainy texture. I threw the batch away.

the recipe was delicious but yes grainy. I would make it again but need to first read the reviews.

I had the same issues as others -- did not thicken, took forever to freeze, and came out grainy. The flavor is good, so next time I'll double the cornstarch and cross my fingers.

The flavor of this was alright but the texture wasn't so great. It was very grainy rather than smooth and creamy like gelato should be.

After I doubled the cornstarch, this recipe worked for me. My family really liked it and it did not taste low fat. I would definitely make it again, but only with twice the amount of cornstarch.

I followed this recipe to the letter and ended up with cherry soup that did not set-up in my ice cream maker, even after I pre-chilled it much longer than indicated. Very disappointing.

I don't think this recipe was tested. It was not as other reviewers mentioned thick at the end of 10 minutes of cooking. I thought I would just go ahead and put it into the ice cream maker, and it never did set up as you would think. The end result was a grainy recipe, and all that almond extract just made an artificial tasting gelato. I'm very disappointed in Gourmet for NOT TESTING this.

Fortunately the recipe said it should be thick after cooking for those 3 minutes. Mine was not, so I added another 1 3/4 Tbsp cornstarch, close to doubling the original amount. That did the trick. The flavor was good, and my husband loved it. (Cherry ice cream is his favorite.) Will make it again with that increased amount of cornstarch.

The flavor of this gelato is mild and not too rich. I would add some lemon juice next time to "perk up" the flavor. The 3 minute cooking time did not make a thick sauce, even after 9 minutes it wasn't what I would call thick. After the nine minutes, chilled as suggested, froze - the end result was a very creamy texture. If you want a light refreshing gelato this is a great recipe. If you want a more intense and sweet flavor, you would need to use a traditional recipe using eggs, etc.
