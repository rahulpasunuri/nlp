Some may say this isn't the same recipe but I'm writing anyway to encourage those who may not have all the ingredients on hand but want to use up some cooked barley. Didn't have leeks, carrots, porcini so I subbed one parsnip and one sweet potato. I omitted leeks/porcini. added garlic and thyme during onion saute. subbed one veggie bouillon and added about tsp ghee towards end. I'd say it's actually a little too salty for my taste! not bland at all...but that may be the ghee. I threw in tons of cooked barley once the soup was done. pretty darn good I'd say

I generally like bland food, so I didn't worry about the other reviews. However, this really IS bland without help. My go-to solution is 1-2 cups of finely cut basil, flat parsley, and cilantro in a ratio of 1:2:1. I also threw in a little hand-pulled pot roast and a dash of soy sauce. My guests loved it, and so did I. I'll definitely make it again.

I also added a couple cloves of garlic, 12oz of shiitakes (love them!) and about two tablespoons of soy sauce at the end. This was a great soup. I thought I might miss the protein but I didn't! My 16 yr. old loved it too! I added a green salad and it was a perfect healthy meal!

I added a couple cloves of garlic and 1/2 Sherry with 8oz of baby bella's and 3.2 oz of shiitakes. Very rich and hearty. Great meal with a grilled cheese.

This is a wonderful soup! For the folks who found it bland, SEASON IT! It should always be assumed that the salt and pepper amounts for most any recipe are very conservative. So, think like a COOK not a robot! I added more salt and pepper, and a few shots of hot sauce, not so much for heat but to bring out the other flavors already there. Then a little lemon juice will always brighten up a soup. I don't have any on hand, but some fresh dill would really put this over the top. Any recipe (with the exception of pastry) should be a guidline, not a mandate! Have fun, and enjoy the path!

I love this soup. It is quick and easy to make. However like many others I substituted the water for a veggie broth and added a dash of soy sauce to it.

We loved this soup. I deviated a little from the recipe & used beef stock & I added some minced garlic. Delicious!

I have made this recipe about 5-6 times. It is a hearty stew-type soup that satisfies both vegetarians and meat eaters. Perhaps some find it bland because they are not using good porcini. I am vegetarian, so I used vegetarian beef-flavored boullion cubes to substitute for beef broth. Ii is very flavorful, filling and low-fat.

I thought this soup was good, but not great. I'm not sure where the confusion about the water originated. The ingredients list calls for 7 cups of water. After you cook the barley in 3 1/2 cups and soak the porcini mushrooms in 1/2 cup you still have three cups remaining to add at the end. I think it was those three cups that made the soup a bit bland -- chicken or vegetable stock would have been more flavorful.

This soup was excellent! The only thing I did differently is add quite a bit more salt and added a spoonful of Creme Fresh when serving. Ignore the other comments about saving the liquid from the barley... you don't use it! You use the liquid from the porcini mushrooms.

I followed the recipe exactly except for one thing. I did not add as much water as called for as I felt it would dilute the flavor. I added half as much and still, the soup was bland and tasteless. This one gets tossed out.

I made it just as given (did not save the barley water) and thought it was delicious! The 20 minute "active time" must assume that the veggies are cut up before starting!

Aie-yaie! When I read the part about adding the remaining 3 cups of water, I had to triple read whether or not I was supposed to have kept the liquid from boiling the barley. I had thrown it out, so I added water (it needed more liquid anyway) and it ended up being bland, of course. I ended up adding a lot more broth and white wine and a lot more seasonings. It ended up very good, but I'm not trying this one again.

Very flavorful. Hearty and warming. Recommend it!

This is a very solid soup, can easily be a meal. It is better to make a day or two in advance - it is much more flavorful if allowed to sit a while in the fridge.

We enjoyed the soup, but too many vegetables. (It should have been called vegetable soup with mushrooms and barley). Next time I will focus on the barley and mushrooms. Also, there was not enough broth.

This soup is justs fantastic. I have made it with different varieties of mushrooms, making sure to have some wild and some domestic and then some dried and some fresh, and it is very flexible. I added a few cloves of garlic and that really picked up the yummy flavour of beef broth (which I used as a base). I also made it one with chicken stock as the base and that resulted in a lighter, but still very flavourful broth - with oyster mushrooms. This whole menu (from the 2002 Jan issue) was a hit - twice for two different groups. Very good.

Delicious. I used 100% dried shiitakes (no porcini or fresh shiitakes). They are very inexpensive at Asian markets. VERY rich and satisfying. Served over very rare shredded beef tenderloin.

I agree great for a cold night. Couldn't get dried porcini (they were out) so used a combination of dried mushrooms. I also added about three ounces of shredded cooked chicken. Make a salad, crusty bread - a fine meal

It was the perfect soup for a snowy day. It was delicious. I couldn't obtain quick-cooking barley, so I used pearl barley (regular style.) I highly recommend this soup.
