Those that seared the roast first complained of poor jus....I think this is a by-productt of sealing the roast. If you want good jus, do not sear and let it stand to rest afterward adding any drippings from the platter to the jus.

This is my go-to Christmas dinner roast. Comes out perfectly every time and the jus is great. Don't leave out the butter, just read that this is a trick of chefs to add butter to enrich the gravy. Reviewers with problems need to use higher quality ingredients: broth, wine,etc. I always use a bone-in roast. This may help with the flavor also. Merry Christmas!

Wonderful and easy (that's cause I forgot to do the jus!). I brought the extra butter to the table and used a bit on the steaks and the small white potatoes I made alongside. Also, I used a less expensive Cross Rib Roast which came boneless. It was 3 pounds and took 1 hour 30 for medium rare.

I first tried this recipe several years ago for Christmas and I've used it for all but one Christmas dinner. That one which I didn't make this roast I was asked why I didn't. It is tasty and rich. The Au Jus gravy is very rich if you use a full bodied wine. Well worth the time and I will continue to prepare this at Christmas!

Delicious and so easy. My fear of the standing rib roast were unfounded. This was suberb. The au jus was not quite as flavorful as I hoped, but no complaints. This is a winner.

I made this for Christmas dinner last year. It was so wonderful, I had to grab the recipe to make it again this year. I think this may be our new Traditional Christmas Dinner. I have to admit, I cut back on the butter in finishing the sauce tho & just used the Pepper Butter.

This is a great rib roast recipe and my family found it tastier than any prime rib we've had elsewhere. I added some chopped rosemary to the peppercorn paste. The au jus comes out bland and overly buttery though, so you'll want to modify. My solution; add roasting vegetables to the pan (carrots, celery, red onion), deglaze the crusty bits, simmer w/ broth & some fresh herbs, strain and mash juice out of it all, skim fat, & you have a much better flavor. If you want gravy, start w/ a dark roux, add the beef broth, then add the skimmed drippings and simmer to desired consistency.

I made this for Christmas dinner after searching numerous "standing rib roast" recipes. I choose this one based on its simplicity - since it was to be my first ever attempt at a standing rib roast. The meat cam out beautifully - the best beef I have ever had, but as a previous review stated - I think that was down to the fabulous cut of beef - and not this particular recipe. I followed the suggestion of another poster - and choose to sear the meat at 500 degrees for 15 minutes, which left a great dark crust, then /i lowered the temp to 350. My dissapointment stemmed from the Au Jus. I followed the directions to a "T" - but my au Jus was virtually tasteless! I don't know if the brand of beef broth I used had anything to do with it - it did seem on its own to have no taste. I tried desperately to season it up - by adding salt, pepper and a load of "gravey master"! Nothing helped and it ended up tasting like salted water. This was a major dissapointment for my family. My English mother in made amazing Yorkshire puddings, and eveyone was dissapointed there was no gravy to drown them in. I wouldnt try this recipe again personally, only because even if the au Jus had been tasty - I think my family would prefer a thick gravey to go with the meat (not me personally as the meat was so good on its own!!)

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was lovely. First time making a standing rib roast, and it was wonderful. I served it with the Orange Roasted Baby Onions, which were an even bigger hit

Absolutely perfect. I had smaller roast & altered the measurements for the paste accordingly, and was totally impressed. I encountered none of the problems discussed-- perfectly browned, great pepper crust, delicious flavor. Wonderful sauce that enhanced my roast potatoes beautifully. I did not reduce the amounts for the sauce as I wanted extra, but did eliminate the additional butter, and can't imagine why you would need it. This is a keeper and my new tradition at Christmas!

Simple, elegant and delicious! I cut back on the extra butter for the au jus. I seared the meat at 500 for 15 min and then 20min/lb at 350 for medium. Does get a bit smokey when searing but the results are a nice well browned roast.

You guys made me look like a professional chef. This recipe was so simple and my guests enjoyed it. Definitely FOUR forks!

Rating: 4
I thought this recipe was fairly simple and came out great. A few adjustments after reading some of the other reviews. I halved the recipe because my roast was smaller, I cooked it at a little higher temperature, and I didn't add the last bit of butter that this recipe calls for. I definitely don't feel it is necessary due to the fact that there is a fair amount of fat on this type of roast. It was the first time I made a Prime Rib and I will definitely make it again.

The "rub" for the outside was good, but I had better luck browing the meat and cooking it at 200 rather than the method presented here. Also found the "au jus" to be pretty awful - could have just dipped it in melted butter and it would have been the same.

Made this for a dinner party and was very pleased. Added a little brown sugar to add sweetness to the au jus and everyone agreed it was delicious. Im making it again (by request) for my husbands bday dinner.

Oops - when I referred to letting it sit at room temp before roasting, I was thinking of another recipe.

Aahh so delicious. I added a good amount of rosemary and thyme to the paste. Also, I skipped the time spent letting it sit at room temp, and it didn't seem to matter.

I,too, was a first time roast maker and made this for the holidays. It was amazing but I chalk that up to the cut of meat more than anything else. the peppercorns I spent so much time crushing were lost inside the pan, or in the carving and might as well have been added at the table with a pepper shaker. The butter in the au jus though, yummy, can't go wrong with more butter!! I will make this cut of meat agian, but will try another recipe.

This was my first beef roast of any kind and I made it for Christmas (yeah, I take risks all the time!). It was picture perfect and magnificent. Impressed everyone (including myself) with so little work. Since it can be prepared a day in advance, except the gravy (which was painless), I love this for parties and will certainly make it again for company. I made a 14 lb roast and it came out perfect with pro-rated adjustment of the recipe and the thermometer made the cooking a breeze. Highly recommended even for a first timer.

Followed the directions. The roast just didn't brown and get crusty like the photo. I'm guessing the temp is too low. The wonderfully sounding seasonings were lost in cooking. I'd find another recipe.

This roast was the first one that I ever cooked, and I was quite pleased with the results. It turned out wonderfully! Because I used a smaller roast, I adjusted the time. I impressed myeslf and my family with this one.

I made this w/a very small roast (2 ribs). It was very easy to make with excellent flavors. The au jus was perfect. The temperature came up a bit faster than I expected. I pulled it out at 135* it was still a good medium rare which my guests prefer. Next time I will try the roasted red onions.

Excellent dish and relatively simple to prepare. The sauce seemed too peppery during preparation, but it was almost perfect with the meat. And it truly turns out looking like the poster child for great entertaining dishes.

This was a very yummy dish. I made it for Christmas dinner and it was quite the hit. I used prime beef, which I would recommend. It was very tender and had a great flavor. The Au Jus is worth the time, as it added a great flavor to the beef. I made the red onions as well, which were a hit with this dish.

ONE OF THE FINEST rib roast recipes EVER! We made this for Christmas dinner and my brother is still talking about it - I just sent him the recipe to make for New Year's Eve! It is so flavorful you really can do without the au jus, but, then again, why not gild the lily!

I made this for Christmas dinner yesterday (for the 2nd time - also made it the year it was the Christmas cover recipe). It was a hit with everyone. I made it with the Roasted Beets with Horseradish Cream, also from this site, and made enough cream to use with the beef as an option for those who didn't want the au jus. Delicious. One thing - I had a 6.5 lb. rib roast and that was PLENTY for seven adults and one child. I can't remember if I had the same size the last time I made this or the 8.5 lb roast called for in the recipe. My brother and his family will be arriving from out of town today and we're having roast beef sandwiches for dinner! Terrific!

Thought the au jus was smashing but this recipe uses a ton of butter on top of a fat laced piece of meat. In the interest of health, I think I'll stick with Herbed Rib Roast also on this site.

I gave this recipe low marks only because I was comparing it to some of the other beef recipes I have tried from this site. It was good, but not a favorite. I much prefer the herb and spice roasted beef tenderloin with red wine shallot sauce from this website, even though this one was much easier to prepare. If I were to make this recipe again, I would omit the last four tablespoons of plain butter added to the au jus at the end. This recipe already had a ton of butter and that last bit seemed to overwhelm the other ingredients in the au jus.

I just have to rave about this fabulous recipe! I made this for Christmas Day '03 for our family which included my very picky father-in-law. He loved it! This would make an excellent main course when having special guests. Not only will I make this again, I already have a request to serve it next Christmas -- from my father-in-law!

I made this for our New Years Eve dinner (2003)and it was a huge hit. We're only 4 so I halved the meat quantity and roasted for 90 min. (medium rare). It was the most tender, juicy roast and was delicious. I served it with a medley of roasted vegetables - not just red onions. Make sure to let the roast sit as this adds greatly to the success.

Great recipe! I used a small 3lb standing rib roast and adjusted cooking time and amounts accordingly. Next time I would use a little more wine, pepper and beef broth and less butter (a little rich for my taste.) Can't wait to experiment with this recipe next time. Fills house with wonderful smell!

This dish was outstanding!!! I love to cook prime rib, it seems so daunting but it's really simple. But I guess when you have such a good cut of meat you'd have to really mess up for it to not be good!! I made this for Easter dinner ( I usually have ham but one of my guests doesn't like ham) I used a boneless rib roast but did everything else the recipe called for. AWESOME!!!!!!!!

Was awesome. We always have prime rib on Christmas Eve and my husband didn't want me to stray from the usual way (just baking it - nothing special). But I held in there and it was awesome - I'm always going to make it this way from now on. Yummy flavor.

I made this for our New Year's Eve party, and it did not last for long! Made the whole menu that was planned out in the magazine. Everyone loved it. The onions didn't seem to go over too well, they seemed to get too soft when I roasted them, but everything else was fantastic!

A wonderful redition of rib roast. I followed the recipe except I halved about 8 shallots and set my meat on top of them to roast. They caramelized and picked up the juices so wonderfully as well as looked great on the serving platter. This made for a wonderful Christmas feast.

I saw the photo in the December Bon Appetit issue, and knew this was one to try. It was absolutely DELICIOUS! This was an exceptional Christmas Day dinner - and with little to minimum fuss! It was just my husband and I, so I reduced the recipe accordingly. My mouth is salivating in memory!!! Can't wait to make again.

This was my first prime rib ever and it turned out wonderful! I served it with simple mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. The butter,pepper and garlic sauce was heavenly I used the same wine recommended for drinking with the meal (Shiraz) in the aujus, and it added spicy flavor! The rib roast itself was quite expensive @ $9.95/lb but worth every penny! There were 6 of us, and we couldn't have eaten in a fine restaurant for the price of the roast. Next time, I'll try serving it with the Lobster Mashed potatoes. (BonApetite 2/02)

Made this as recipe called for with two exceptions. 1. I started it at 450 degrees for 30", 2. I made gravy and not the au jus. I'll do that next time. It was wonderful, smelled heavenly while roasting, and tasted delicious. It was cooked perfect - rare. I took it out of the oven at a smidge over 120 degrees - 140, as most thermoms call far isn't rare. Great flavor!

I believe this dish is best when the cut of rib roast is small and therefore more tender. Over cooking would be the kiss of death. Fills the home with wonderful smells.

This turned out wonderfully...but, I am not so sure about the "125 degree" temperature--could this be an error? My roast was 6 lbs and it took 2 hours to get to medium rare, which, by the way is around 145-150 degrees on a standard meat thermometer. Otherwise, this was fantastic and everyone loved it.

Rating: 3
This was excellent, although the meat was cooked a little more than I like. We used a convection oven at 325 for about 2 1/2 hours (8 lb roast). I'd probably roast it about 20-30 minutes less. The au jus was excellent. It is important to degrease the juices as it says.
