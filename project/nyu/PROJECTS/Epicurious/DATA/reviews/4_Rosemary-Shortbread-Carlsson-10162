One last note - I like this recipe so much that I just wrote a review for it - forgetting I'd already done so. Ooops. Oh, well...THAT is how good it is.

When something is needed to bring to a party, this is it...so wonderful with wine. The only change I make to this perfect recipe is cutting the shortbread into little round bite- sized pieces (with fluted edges - very cute) that take 25-30 minutes to bake. I learned not to tamper with the ingredients; for example, "light" butter will not do. : ) Give this recipe a try - you'll be glad you did.

I spontaneously made this for a savory appetizer, I had EVERY ingredient on hand, it was so easy, such a hit!!! I'm making this for holiday gifts, so easy and yummy!!!

i LOVE this recipe - always a hit at a house party. wonderful with wine. for the most recent batch, i varied it by using a 1.5" cookie cutter, in a floral shape, to make little shortbread biscuits. also, i had just under one T of fresh rosemary, but mixing in some dry rosemary worked just fine.

If you like shortbread thats crumbly but with a touch of "chew" on the inside then this is for you. I think it's lovely.

I used dark brown sugar in this recipe and it was INCREDIBLE!!!! Everyone in the family, including the kids, gobbled this up within an hour.

I LOVED this recipe. I made the shortbread for a birthday party and everyone absolutely loved it. The recipe doesn't specify, but I used salted butter and dark brown sugar. Once the squares were cooled, I melted some chocolate and dipped the ends. The result was a unique, delicious flavor. I will definitely be making these again.

Good, but the reason I would not make this again is that the "Rosemary Shortbread" recipe on this site is even better! The Carlsson recipe comes out thicker and softer, but I prefer the other one, which comes out crisper. I recommend baking the Carlsson in a pan larger than 11x7. FYI, the Carlsson also comes out sweeter than the other one, but whether that is better or worse depends on your personal preference, of course.

Easy, easy, easy and ALWAYS gets raves. Made this to go in gift baskets and it barely got out the door as my spouse loves it. I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe - definitely not too sweet. A neat alternative to all the sugar-loaded holiday treats.

Fabulous! Made it for a cocktail party. Everyone was thrilled at the lovely and surprising flavor. What a winner.

I had been looking for an unusual recipe for shortbread that I could make and give out as a Christmas gift. This seemed a good balance between sweet and savory tastes so I decided to try it. It was so verstile! Everyone loved it. My mother even asked me to make a batch for dinner and it was a great compliment to the apple pork roast ensemble she had put together.

I loved this recipe. It is very unusual and is perfect with tea.

Good, but next time I will add 1/4 less sugar
