This intriqued me. First, make sure the tomatoes are large enough, and that your eggs are medium or large, not jumbo. My eggs overfilled my tomatoes, and made the pan hard to clean. Second, grease the pan - they will stick. Lastly, next time I will poach the eggs and add them after baking the pesto filled tomatoes. The eggs cooked unevenly - the yolks were set while some of the white was undercooked. But the combination of flavors was outstanding. The crispy pancetta, the romaine, the cheese - it was kind of like a BLT and Caesar salad all rolled into one. I made the English muffin toasts from the same issue of Gourmet and had a fantastic breakfast for 6.
