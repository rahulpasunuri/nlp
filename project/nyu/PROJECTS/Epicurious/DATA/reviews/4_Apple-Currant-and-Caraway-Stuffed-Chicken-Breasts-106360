Very good and nice party dish. I often deglaze pan with apple brandy (Calvados) when making; adds depth. Serve on potatoes anna for a nice presentation and scatter fresh herbs(sage leaves or fresh thyme). I am a caterer and this is always popular.

Love this dish! I have used the stuffing in pork tenderloin roast as well - delish! Raves from anyone I've made it for.

Delicious and very flavorful! Definitely use 1 TABLESPOON caraway seeds for full flavor. Though it sounds 'exotic' it is really easy. The stuffing takes some time, so I usually make it the evening earlier while that night's dinner is cooking/baking. Also, last time I was out of celery so I added extra apple and my husband said it was the best yet. If you don't want to buy and entire loaf of rye bread, just purchase a couple of rolls from your bakery and cut off the crust.

Superb dish... served at a dinner party for 7 and all guests raved over how wonderful the chicken tasted... Any dried fruit (used Kirkland (Costco) brand dried mangoes and berries when I made it), chopped roughly berry size, will work instead of currants; used finely chopped shallots instead of onion; if unfiltered apple cider isn't available (it wasn't when I made this), regular apple cider works fine.

This was very good--fancy enough for "special" dinner with my mother-in-law, but not at all daunting, even on a week night. Made exactly as written, the recipe produces good flavors and a very pretty presentation--a win! I served this with honey baked sweet potatoes & roasted broccoli.

Great recipe! I didn't have cider, and skipped the last step, but sprinkled the chicken a little bit with lemon and baked it under a lid: it came out perfect!

Rating: 4
I've been making this for years, and it is always a big hit. I've made this dish for dinner for over 100 people and it worked well since the chicken breasts can be stuffed in advance. The stuffing is versatile, and instead of chicken I quite often use it to stuff thick-cut boneless pork loin chops, and then grill them 6 minutes per side. The only other substitution I've made is to use dried cranberries instead of currants.

I enjoyed this recipe, but would make one major change if making again. I would DEFINITELY INCREASE THE CARAWAY! That is the unique part of the recipe and differentiates it from any other stuffing. I would, however, keep the ratio of cider:broth the same; otherwise the sauce would be too sweet. Perfect sauce to drizzle over the chicken. Also good with pork. Agree with previous poster that this is a nice combo of sweet and savory. Served over bulghur. Broccoli rabe was a nice bitter complement.

I love this recipe -- just the right mix of sweet (but not too sweet) and savory. It's easy to make (though unfortunately not quick), and it's consistently been a big hit with everyone I've made it for. Very highly recommended!

I'm afraid I must join the few dissenting voices. I found this dull verging on dire. Maybe, here in London, our chicken breasts, caraway seeds, celery, apples, onions, cider, home-made stock and currants are sub-standard, but somehow I doubt it. All those lovely ingredients added up to an unmitigated bore. One of the few Epicurious recipes that's been a let-down. No taste, no forks.

Rating: 4
OK, so I winged it. Without all the ingredients I was able to substitute a few things, I added Manderine orange and raisins instead or Currents and plain breadcrumbs, it was great! Baked it all w/ 1/2 in. slices of plum tomatoes and Large mushrooms pieces. As a side used dirty rice w/sausage and steamed broccoli. And wine, serve with wine.

Yum, I loved this recipe and so did both kids. Husband wasn't that crazy about it, though. He thought the caraway was overpowering. The only reason I didnt give it 4 forks was because the sauce was pretty lame and needed a lot of doctoring. If you find you need to use toothpicks to hold the stuffing inside, its possible that youre not cutting the pocket correctly. Go here to see pictures: http://tinyurl.com/4 st86q When stuffed like this, there is no leakage.

Delicious and easy. Great for a weeknight meal or company. The pan sauce is amazing. Warning: this becomes a lot sweeter the next day, so if you don't like that flavor, be sure to eat it all the first day.

FANTASTIC! Made this for my boyfriend with the Wild and Brown Rice with Cranberries from this site and we both loved it. It is a bit labor intensive, but definitely worth it in the end. The sauce was to die for and complimented everything perfectly. Will DEFINITELY be making this again!!

Fabulous recipe! One of the best chicken dishes I've had in ages. Great combination of flavors. Don't over-cook the chicken; that's always my downfall.

We loved this dish. I usually associate this kind of stuffing with pork dishes, but the chicken was wonderful. This is gourmet good.

Rating: 4
This was simply outstanding. I read all of the reviews and agree with most of the minor changes, although I suspect none of them are critical. The recipe is great as is. I used a combination of both dried currants & cranberries. Cranberries are more colorful so I think it's a good idea to use them. They're also easier to find unless you live in Manhattan :-) I couldn't find unfiltered apple cider so I just used regular apple cider. Don't really know what difference the unfiltered would make anyway. The reviewer who recommended making extra stuffing was right on. The stuffing is delicious, and it's particularly attractive for presentation to have it as a bed underneath the sliced chicken. I think one reviewer commented that it was dry ... totally disagree! In the event that that reviewer had been right, however, I took others suggestions of using the toothpicks and adding some cider to the stuffing as a preventive measure. Was exceptionally moist. Six halves of chicken breast are more than 2lbs. of chicken and once stuffed the chicken breasts take longer to brown, fyi. I can't wait to make this again.

Thought this was only so-so. The gravy was a bit salty - and the flavors in the chicken were not as exciting as I expected. A decent dish, but there are far better recipes on this site.

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe exactly and was very satisfied. Very nice dish, not too much work and presents nicely; would be good for company. The only thing I did differently was I toothpicked the breast together when I browned it and then removed the toothpicks before putting them in to bake. I was certain all the stuffing would have fallen out had I not done this.

Oh my goodness this was good! I substituted dried cranberries for the currants and regular bread crumbs for the rye, only because I had both in my pantry, but I think I would always make it with cranberries mainly because they looked so pretty. I served it with some buttered and herbed noodles, and braised fennel and celery. My husband and I were just moaning all through dinner. Definitely good enough for a company dinner, but not too much work to make for just the 2 of us!

This is one of my favorite recipies. I add cranberries instead of currents and add about 1.5 to 2 times as many caraway seeds. Whenever I make it, I make many more breasts than I need and freeze the leftovers stuffed but uncooked. Later in the week we can use them to make an elegant dinner in only a half-hour!

I made this recipe as part of the buffet for my daughters wedding. I did a trial run at home, one with the recipe exactly as listed and one with dried cherries instead of currants. The cherries were far better. I also flattend the chicken Breast and rolled them with the stuffing inside. This made for easier portion serving. It was 50/50 with whom liked it. Those that were not "thrilled" with it were the ones that do not like caraway, all other Loved it. I took all the advice others gave and prepared everything the day ahead, it worked great. Thanks for the help.

Just the right amount of flavoring and very good texture. I used olive oil and a teaspoon of butter to brown the chicken instead of vegtable oil, otherwise I wouldn't change anything.

I too used dried cranberries in my stuffing. It was a so tender and delicious. I will be making this one again soon.

This was really good! It was a weeknight, so instead of stuffing the breasts, I just put some extra chickent stock onto the stuffing, browned the breasts whole and baked them on top of the stuffing in a casserole dish. It came out great, the stuffing was the right consistency and it was pretty quick to make.

This recipe got me thinking of caraway with lots of lemon, whesh onion and oil as a zip-lock marinade. I made it a few months back and the family loved it. As I recall, the lemon caraway seed was da bomb.

Lovely dish, very nice presentation too - I used dried cranberries as suggested by others and the colours looked lovely. Dissappointed with the sauce though, maybe I will have to try again as it too received excellent reviews by others. Next time I will cut down on the butter used for the stuffing.

I loved the basic idea of this recipe but made changes: pork instead of chicken, 7-grain bread instead of rye, no caraway or currants. The final product was fabulous and my husband loved it.

I made several changes to this recipe in order to use what I had on hand and it was still great. I used fresh semolina bread crumbs instead of rye, dried cranberries instead of currents, and dry vermouth instead of cider (which made it tart rather than sweet). Served it with wild rice and baked acorn squash with maple syrup, nutmeg and butter. A beautiful fall dinner.

I have made this recipe 5 or 6 times already and we love it. Each time I make a minor variation to change it up a bit. This is a great fall recipe..I am currently using dried cranberries..also added a few fresh to the gravy and it was lovely.

I saw this recipe and thought that it would be so much better using Pork Chops. I took really thick boneless pork chops, sliced them in the middle, made a nice size pocket, added the stuffing, and used toothpicks to close the chops. After searing them, I baked them covered for 35 min at 350 degrees, then uncovered them and baked 10 min. more. I made the sauce from the recipe. They were delicious! Really enjoyable! Will make again.

Rating: 3
I've made this three times now and it's always delicious. I've left out the currants and parsley and substituted wine for the cider, but the caraway flavour really shines through. I've also found that using different kinds of apples doesn't affect the recipe negatively. The only real issue is getting chicken breasts large enough so that the stuffing stays inside!

Rating: 4
What a pleasant surprise! The sauce was perfect and the mix of flavors was a culinary delight. I used golden raisins as suggested by another reviewer because we couldn't find currants. Will definitely make this one a keeper.

I made this for a Halloween birthday party yesterday. I made them up the day before and dipped them in an egg batter then seasoned flour. I used dried cranberries instead of the currants. WOW, what a great recipe. I served the breasts on a bed of mashed potatoes with the apple sauce over the top. Also had green beans and for dessert the pumpkin bread pudding from this site. I felt like a gourmet...

Rating: 3
Great fall recipe! I used craisins and golden raisins instead of currants and also added a little cider to the stuffing. I didn't have enought fat in the pan to make a roux so I thickened with cornstarch instead. Served with candied butternut squash, mashed potatoes, and broccoli with french apple pie for dessert. Everyone wanted the recipes.

This was one of the best stuffed chicken recipes I have ever tried. I found I had a lot of left over stuffing though. The apple cider gravy was amazing, and I used the left over gravy the next day, and it was still awesome. The chicken is not as good when it is reheated though. I would definetly make this chicken again.

Rating: 4
Wow! Killer recipe! It was a bit of a pain, but the results were well worth it! I closed the "chicken envelope" with toothpicks and string before pan frying and during baking. This kept the stuffing from going all over the place and made me feel like I was some kind of a culinary genious or something (actually, I got the idea from another review -- thanks...). I've made it twice in the last week and have plans for making again this week. A good excuse to go and buy some apple cider (great for drinking too!).

Rating: 4
You can read all the other reviews if you like. All I can say is "WOW!" The only addition I'd add would be to skewer the stuffed chicken with tooth picks along the open edges and tie off with twine. Perhaps I stuffed mine too full, but . . . yum!

Rating: 4
Will definitely use this in the future for "entertaining", Two minor changes I made were to use golden raisons I had on hand in place of the currents and chives inplace of the part of the onion. I only had a little vidallia so made these suibstitutions which worked very well. Also cut back on the butter by using pan spray to decrease fat content . This was marvelous any ways though

Definitly stuff the chicken overnight, helped to keep the chickens together when in the skillet. Many requests for this one.

Delicious recipe. the only change I made was eliminate the cup of broth, and add another 1/2 c up of apple cider. It reduced perfectly and gave the chicken a much nicer apple taste. I had raves from my company.

I'm not a chef by any means, but this recipe got outstanding reviews from my family. An unusual combination of ingredients and flavors, but well worth the risk. I, too, used white wine cooking sauce instead of unfiltered apple cider and it was superb! Will definitely make again.

Wowee was this good! Really nice, and unusual, combination of flavors. It was fairly labor-intensive, but not difficult. I also did not have unfiltered apple cider so used wine at another reviewer's suggestion -- yum! I served this with the Roasted Cauliflower with Garlic and the Rice with Basil and Pine Nuts, both on epicurious as well. They were all good fits. I very rarely give 4 forks but this one deserves it!

This is a superb chicken dish. Makes a beautiful presentation. I have made this dish 3 times in the last month to rave reviews and requests for the recipe each time. We are big stuffing fans so the last time I quadrupled the recipe and baked the dressing in the oven with the chicken. I placed a little mound of stuffing on the each plate with the sliced chicken breasts around. It was a feast for the eyes as well as the palate. I love this site and often use a recipe based on the reviews. Thank you Epicurious!

I couldn't find UNfiltered apple cider anywhere so I used white wine instead and it was delicious....I also made chicken roll-ups with the stuffing and baked extra stuffing. I like the fact that you could make these the day before....really helps with time.....I will definitely make these again.

We actually were short for time when we made this so we didn't stuff the chicken, rather we served the stuffing on the side. We thought it was excellent, and we were disappointed that we had to eat our dinner rather quickly.

I made this for my husband who deosn't really like 'stuffing' recipes, and he loved it! I left out the currants and it was still good. My kids wouldn't touch it - but I will absolutely make it again. I wonder how it would be with pork chops??

Maybe I'm some kind of retard but I am mystified by all the good reviews for this chicken. My husband likes just about anything and he didn't go back for seconds which is a sure sign that something is terribly wrong. It was OK but nothing to write home about. This is only the second epicurious recipe that I have actually thrown out but it got trashed on Saturday night.

This was a wonderful dish. I plan to make it again and again. Frying the caraway seeds seems to open up the flavor. Next time I make this, I will double the recipe for the stuffing and bake some extra. I needed to cook those chicken breast a little longer than 15 minutes.

Loved this recipe. I added wine (of course) to the broth just for flavor (plus a few glasses for myself) so by the time I ate it, I was in fine form. I recommend wine while cooking (as opposed to cooking with wine). Served this to guests and they were overjoyed. Perfect with rice and a nice salad. So tasty.

This was a wonderful make ahead main course for a special dinner. I did use kitchen string to tie the stuffed breasts together before browning. The taste was sophisticated and delicious. I served immediately after the stint in the oven, but am happy to learn that it could rest for a while longer before serving.

When entertaining, I almost always challenge myself by cooking new dishes. However, I never choose recipes that haven't already been positively reviewed by my fellow epicuious.com readers. Until now! I'm happy to report that this dish was a big hit with my Easter guests who don't eat pork or lamb. The breasts ended up sitting in the oven (switched off) for an extra half hour, and still they were nice and moist. The mix of the sweet flavors with caraway is wonderful. I served it with other yummy dishes from this site: goat-cheese scalloped potatoes, curried carrots, sauteed snow peas and radishes, and my all-time favorite starter the watercress soup (without the scallops).
