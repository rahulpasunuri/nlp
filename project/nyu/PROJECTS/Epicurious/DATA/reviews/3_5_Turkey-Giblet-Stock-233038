This has better flavour when made with chicken stock (or turkey stock if you have it) instead of water. It will definitely raise the bar for your gravy.

I have never made turkey giblet stock before so I am not quite sure how to rate this recipe. However, this Thanksgiving was the first time that I have ever received rave reviews on my gravy!

Wonderful, I think it was the key to making the much raved about gravy.

I made this to add to the gravy and the gravy was devine - the best gravy I've ever tasted. Only issue I had was I only ended up with 1 cup of stock so I added 1 cup of chicken broth and 1 cup of water and used that to make the gravy. Next time I'll put the heat on the lowest possible setting so it doesn't evaporate away so much...
