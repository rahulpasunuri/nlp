This makes a great appetizer and tastes better than it looks. Once tasted, it is sure to be finished. Well liked and different.

Made the mistake of not prepping the day before, but I think it worked out better that way. I think that the pork would have been too salty if it had sat there for the recommended time. The annual potluck-style party I served this dish appetizer at is attended by our musician and artist friends. I think we all try to bring dishes that are going to really impress each other and this one worked well for me!

2-1/2 forks - Made this last Christmas and got rave reviews even though I found it a little too salty. Am making it again this year but will be sure to completely remove marinade. Will also be doing half with sweet mustard and trying half with a peach chutney.

I have made this one a few times now and it has been a hit each time. Some alterations I would do: use some course dijon mustard -- much more impressive looking and flavorful. No need to marinade such a long time as it dries it out some. Serving warm is no problem and I prefer not chilling so long before serving. If you make large amounts or triple recipe, do not triple the salt amounts as it will harden the meat. A great dish for appetizers and it is a regular on my entertaining menu.

This is so easy to make - the tip about preparing the pork on the plastic wrap really makes a lot of sense. This gets devoured every time I make it and I also get requests for the recipe. Great for parties!

EASY and delicious. The pork turns a deep rich color from the marinade, so some people wondered what meat they were eating, but once they tried it, they loved it! The mustard sauce is also a great sandwich spread.

Simple, needs no rushing, and delicious! Edit: have since made this for guests, served on a plate for everyone to nibble at. The plate was clear within minutes and two people asked me for the recipe.

Not worth the effort. I thought it was a waste of a good pork tenderloin.

Yummy! Interesting pairing of flavors. I couldn't find tenderloin so I used a small loin roast but it worked great. Served it to my brother who's an executive chef and he asked for the recipe so you know its a hit! You could probably cut the sauce by 1/2 because there is more than enough.

I served this at a bridal shower, as I prefer "advanced-prep" recipes for such occasions. Impatient cooks may get flustered at the marinate time and roasting time, but the results are worth the wait. Warning: Seal well before marinating/refrigerating ... odors are on the strong side.
