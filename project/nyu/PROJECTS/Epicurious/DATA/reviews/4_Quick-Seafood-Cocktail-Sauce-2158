Excellent and easy recipe. Loved the interest that the fresh tarragon added. Only change I made was adding more horseradish to give a bit more kick.

I used dried thyme and dill instead of tarragon. For this little effort, it's great. To the reviewer from Stroudsburg: Try inviting different friends.

I used the dried tarragon and refridgerated it overnight. I was disappointed to see at the end of the party that it was not touched and was then thrown away. No one (15+ people) cared for it at all.

I have made this countless times over the years...simple and beats any jarred cocktail sauce hands down. A 1/4 to 1/2 amount of dried tarragon works great.

We have made this many times just as written and it's terrific.

Great recipe with the tarragon...even better with dill! All of my friends love this sauce...even my husband, who does not like cocktail sauce, likes this sauce. I will never by cocktail sauce again.

Great recipe, though you might try 1/2 cup chile sauce and 1/2 cup Ketchup to even out the hello Heinz. Cheers!

This is a terrific recipe - the only problem was that I didn't make enough. (This recipe seemed to be enough for about 40 medium cocktail shrimp.) Nice fresh flavors.

This cocktail sauce is excellent. The tarragon, lemon and onion make for a very interesting flavor, BUT... i recommend starting with one 1 Tb of tarragon, then adding more to taste. 2 Tb was a bit overpowering, so we reduced it for the second batch.

I loved everything about this cocktail sauce EXCEPT for the fresh tarragon. I liked the color that it added, but its flavor seemed somewhat misplaced. Next time will substitute chopped parsley. Otherwise, this is fast and fresh, with a great balance of flavors. DEFINITELY heads above jarred cocktail sauce.

Excellent. Every ingredient is important to the overall effect of this sauce. A very nice twist to the plain cocktail sauce. Use dried tarragon instead of fresh if you want, just mix it into ketchup earlier to let the flavor meld before adding the other ingredients.

Must echo everyone else's rave reviews. This couldn't be easier and couldn't taste fresher. Everyone absolutely loves this sauce. I've been using it for years!

Wonderful and easy. The tarragon adds a nice nuance to a traditional sauce. I can't wait to try this will dill or thyme next time around...

Yummy and simple. Thanks.

Once you try this, you'll never go back to the bottled variety. Fresh tarragon is the key. I made this for a BIG party, used a mega bottle of Heinz ketchup and multiplied other ingredients to match. A major hit...

It's wonderful; but even better made with chili sauce instead of ketchup.

Very easy and very good. I liked it with slightly less grated onion and slightly more lemon juice.

too much horseradish for me in this recipe -- but i modified it to taste, and it is really delicious. So simple. No more bottles for me either!

I used a little less fresh tarragon (to suit my tastes) and it was really very good. And, no, I won't buy the bottled variety again either. This is better.

Very fast and easy to make as well as great tasting. What more could you ask for?

When I think of the money I've wasted throwing out expired half-consumed bottles of mediocre cocktail sauce... You'll never go back!

Killer cocktail sauce. The tarragon is the perfect flavor that's missing from the pedestrian bottled fare. I added a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce and Tobasco to taste for an extra hit. Splendily dressed the oysters.

Excellent! Best cocktail sauce I have tried and very easy too.

Never buy bottled cocktail sauce again! This recipe is so simple, and is divine with fresh, chilled shrimp. The fresh tarragon is worth the expense -- it lends a terrific flavor to the overall result.

Couldn't be better, couldn't be easier. Why would anyone use bottled!

This is a fabulous recipe. I used crushed tomotoes instead of ketchup, I prefer the consistency and I find the flavour more rich. I popped it all in my mini food processor and it couldn't have been easier. Definitely better than anything I've bought off the shelf.

Excellent with BarBQ shrimp and scallops! Would never had thought to use tarragon! Tarragon definetly made the recipe! I live in Halifax so it was critiqued by REAL seafood lovers!

This sauce was wonderful, but made way too much. I cut the recipe in half and added just a touch more of horseradish to give it a bit more kick
