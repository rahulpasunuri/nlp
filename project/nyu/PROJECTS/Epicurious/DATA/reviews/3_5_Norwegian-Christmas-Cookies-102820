Not bad, not great. I think for the effort, I would make Scottish shortbread instead. They would be fine with tea.

I made this recipe as described here... and the dough was crumbling on me...what did I do wrong? :(

I made these exactly as directed and I thought they were good. . . rating 2 1/2 forks. I really like the fact that they are so small - you don't feel guilty eating one or two!

Oh my god!!!! These are so good that I do not think they will make it to my dinner on December 25th!!!! I followed the suggestion to sprinkle the cookies in crushed almonds plus I sprinkled the rest of the batch with christmas red and green sprinkles! Oh, oh, here comes my husband asking for another two cookies!!

I make a lot of these, they are very popular! I was taught this by my dear mother-in-law and we flatten the balls with a fork to leave a nice inprint + after brushing them they are dipped into a mixture of pearl sugar and chopped up almonds. If you are making lots of cookies and live somewhere cold I recommend putting the preflatened balls on their trays out on the veranda- bannister while making other cookies. When they are firm and cold simply dip them first in the eggmix and then into a bowl with sugar/almond-mixture!

I love this recipe! These cookies are perfect - my new all-time favorite. I added 3/4 tsp ground cardamom because I couldn't believe there was a baking recipe with "Norwegian" in the title that didn't call for cardamom. I also used superfine baker's sugar, but only because it was what I had on hand. I don't know if it changed the consistency of the dough from what it would have been with granulated sugar.

I thought these were good, but my husband really loved them and asked that I make them again next year, so I will. They were a little understated--almost a snickerdoodle without the spice. They were very easy to make, which is a big bonus at this time of year.

I have made these sarina kakor for years. Yes the key is to add a large egg and don't skimp on the egg wash. Find Pearl Sugar! I also use my big Kitchen Aid...I'm a caterer. They are not complex, but there is no Scandanavian cookie that really is. I've been helping my little Norwiegan grandma make cookies since I was small.. I should know. It's their simplicity that makes them so good. Like the potato chip... you can't stop at one, its just a potato and some salt that has been fried.

These cookies were not bad, but I expected better results considering the effort required (and good reviews). I used the best butter I could find and added a bit of cream as another chef had suggested, but the texture was still very sandy, like dry shortbread. I ended up making them into Thumbprint Cookies with 1 tsp apricot or raspberry preserves, which helped give them some flavor. Definitely won't take the time to make these again.

I make at least four batches of these cookies every Christmas using good quality butter such as Plugra. They make the perfect cookie press dough -- just the right consistency and not too wet or dry. Sprinkle them with colored sugars and bake.

Still searching for the perfect sugar cookie recipe. These were ok but not great. I've had way better.

I make these every year for Christmas. I use Plugra unsalted butter, and add 3/4 teaspoon sea salt to the recipe. I use a small cookie scoop to form the balls, then I flatten them slightly on the cookie sheet with the palm of my hand before I indent them. I fill the centers with colored sugar and omit the egg wash. The European butter gives them an ultra-rich flavor. I make a lot of different cookies and candy for Christmas, and many of them are intricate and chocolaty, but these simple cookies are always at the top of my list.

This is the second year that I am making these cookies. They are lovely, buttery, melt in-your-mouth. I did take the advice to add a little milk and that really helped the dough come together. I also used raw can sugar - becasue that was what was easily available - and it came out nicely. I may try the rolling in cinnamon and sugar suggestion next!

If you use a stand mixer kepping the dough together is no big deal. Also be sure the butter is room temperature. But the cookies are really only so so. We tried then with cinnamon and sugar, white chocolate morsels, and milk chocolate morsels and they are dry and dull. I really don't think i'll make them again.

I spiced up this recipe by turning this recipe into a variety of different cookies. Some I rolled in cinnamon and sugar, some I rolled into balls and pressed my thumb into, filling the cavity with either apricot or strawberry jam. Some I pressed chocolate chips into. All of them disappear in a few hours. The crumbly butter cookie make a wonderful base on which to pile your favorite Xmas goodies. This is the third year I will be making them and I will continue playing with the toppings.

Even my pickie girlfriend loved these. They are wonderful with a little vanilla and colored sugar.

These were tasty, but I just didn't find them any more interesting than ordinary shortbread and more time consuming to make.

Whoa... I am definately in the minority. We prefer really simple cookies, but no one in my family liked these. They felt the cookie was too powdery and bland.

These absolutely melt in your mouth! I used raw cane sugar (available at Safeway, in my case) and they turned out beautifully. Tasting these makes me proud of my Norwegian heritage.

These are very melt-in-your-mouth tasty butter cookies. There are not too sweet and have a nice, crumbly texture. I had no problem getting the dough to hold together. Be sure you use softened butter and a large egg. Also, you must remove them from the cookie sheet before they cool too much, or they will stick and break.

Following advice, I added liquid to the recipe. I added milk, which is more in keeping with Scandinavian recipes. Pearl sugar is a must. But the cookies were definitely a hit!

These were good and lasted all Christmas season - alas very dry dough made them heavy. I needed to add vanilla to the egg and sugar because there was no way all the flour was going to be absorbed. Also, I think this recipe was designed with real "mixer" equipment in mind. Took a long time to roll into balls because the dough was so dry.

Really melt-in-your mouth! I can't remember giving anything in Epicurious 4 forks! Not very difficult either. I added about a 1/4 cup of water to the dough as it seemed very dry and wouldn't hold together, but that could well be because I cannot get extra-large eggs in Portugal.

I made this recipe at Christmas and everyone loved it. The recipe is easy and gave great results. My children especially liked them.

I excitedly purchased December's Gourmet magazine when I saw it had a Norwegian cookie recipe! I'm of Norwegian descent and love when I come across a "Norsk" recipe. This was an excellent cookie. I made 21 different varieties this year! This will definitely be one of the cookies I make every Xmas. It reminded me of a cookie my mother used to make every year "Berliner Kranser". This cookie tasted exactly the same, but was shaped in a ball instead of a wreath {Kranse}. I used coarsely crushed sugar cubes, since I didn't have pearl sugar. My Mom always crushed sugar herself also. I adjusted oven temp. to 300 F. I baked cookies for only 11 min. I flattened cookies with the bottom of a small glass and then super-imposed a small depression in the center of that again with a small cap. The depression in the center of the cookie is where I placed the crushed sugar. Supurb cookie!!
