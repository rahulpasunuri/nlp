These are fantastic! but I changed the recipe so much that maybe it another version altogether... I used 3 1/2 cups flour and substituted 1/2 cup light olive oil for the butter. Bumped up the pepper to 2 1/2 T., tangerine zest 2 T. and added 1 cup of toasted pine nuts. I prefer biscotti recipes w/ olive oil...like the flavor and don't want the added fat. they are great!

Definitely an unusual take on biscotti - I bump up the pepper and liqueur too...

I've made these biscotti numerous times, always to rave reviews (come prepared with printouts of the recipe!). I recommend doubling the Grand Marnier, substituting orange zest for lemon and increasing the zest to 2 1/2 T. Delicious!!!

I made these with high hopes after reading all the reviews -- they sounded like something I would really enjoy. However, I was disappointed in the texture and to a lesser degree in the flavor. The biscotti were too airy and crisp rather than hard and crunchy. If I made them again I would not mix the butter and sugar until fluffy but would use melted butter (a technique that gives fabulous results in other biscotti recipes such as the Dec 99 Bon Appetit anise-almond biscotti recipe on this site). The flavor was mildly interesting but just didn't grab me. I think increasing the salt to 1 tsp would highlight the other flavors. Adding pine nuts as another reviewer suggested would be a nice variation too. I would not make this again as written but might try it one more time with these modifications.

Excellent flavor with the cracked peppercorns and hint of orange. My only alteration was to add a second dusting of powdered sugar after the 1st baking but prior to cutting them. Texture was perfect - dry but not too crumbly.

This recipe is good, but it is GREAT with the following recipe tweaks. Add more peppercorns (up to 2 tbsp), use orange or tangerine peel instead of lemon peel, and add toasted pine nuts to the batter (3/4 c). The final roll in powdered sugar makes a great contrast to the pepper and pine nuts. I made 4 kinds of biscotti for x-mas this year, and these are the winners for taste and creativity among testers!

I used this recipe the first time I tried baking biscotti...I liked it, and the pepper adds a nice bite, but I think I would have preferred it had the usual almonds or pistachios also been included.

These were good - sweet but still with a bite. I haven't made biscotti before and I cut them too thick. So they were moist, but I am not sure if it was the recipe or my slicing!

I printed this recipe years ago, but never made them because I was never sure. I made them today - they are super easy and very tasty, but not the best biscotti I have ever had. Still, worth making again as a good basic biscotti.

Easy to make, and each time I've made them people said they were the "best biscotti they had ever had". I safely increased the pepper a little bit. These produce a slightly softer (i.e. not rock-hard) biscotti.

Very delicious. An easy recipe that is sure to be versatile.

My daughter lives in Italy and made this for Christmas. She told me about it so I tried it today. Didn't have lemons, so used orange zest and also added toasted walnuts. My daughter told me not to let them cool too much (10 minutes was too long she thought) so I waited 6-7 minutes before slicing the logs and no problem. She also said they tasted better the next day, so I'll have to try them tomorrow. Guess I'm giving 2 reviews here. Well, we both love the recipe, even though I changed it a bit. Definitely will make it again.

I did this recipe for a bake sale, except I replaced half of the black pepper with dried chili flakes and added a cup of toasted pine nuts. I also drizzeled the finished biscotti with melted dark chocolate. They all sold.

Fantastic! I made one big "loaf" of biscotti when I formed the dough onto a baking sheet, so that I'd have longer cookies. It worked fine; I simply increased the baking time in both stages by 10 minutes. These biscotti are delicate and soft-crumbly, not overly hard. Served with Papa Vigne Vin Santo and Zabaglione Gelato (gelato recipe is also on this site), these made my family very, very happy.

A black pepper freak, I tried 2 tbsp. Too much. And for the writer whose first baking resulted in crumbs when cut into bars, "cool slightly" means about 10 minutes. It must be cut while still very warm. I have better luck standing these cut pieces upright and letting them cool in a turned off oven after the second baking. Hotter than hell with my extra black pepper, these were still delicious.

This was a very interesting recipe. I think a whole TBS of pepper is too much and couldn't really taste the lemon or Grand Marnier. I will make this recipe again however decreasing the pepper and increasing the lemon and Grand Marnier. I would also not slice them on the diag in order to get more slices. These expand quite a bit when baked. This recipe is worth a second try with a few personal taste adjustments.

I've made several biscotti recipes but this is the best by far. Everyone wanted the recipe. Great with coffee and not so terribly sweet. Absolutely delicious!!

A huge disappointment! The dough was very crumbly (nearly half the batch gone trying to cut the logs into individual biscotti), and taste became quite bland after second baking--we lost the pepper, lemon & orange/Grand Marnier flavors altogether, and the end result was more like a biscotto-shaped butter cookie than anything else. (Just out of curiosity, I didn't rebake the ones that had crumbled--and those had a delicious, fresh flavor in which the pepper & lemon really shine!) A huge waste of time, and especially frustrating for me because I was hoping to use these for little holiday gifts. Tomorrow, I'm baking pepper biscotti again--but this time, I'm going back to a great recipe I clipped several years ago from the NY Times...

This has become my standard biscotti recipe -- it's super easy to make, and absolutely delicious! Sometimes, for interest, I add a tablespoon of ground cardamon, and I always use the pepper grinder on the most coarse grind instead of cracking the pepper, for ease.

Who would have thought that biscotti made with black pepper would taste so good. This recipe is delicious -- and easy too. Definitely would make this again and again.

This biscotti was fabulous. We added a bit of green peppercorn as well. So delicious. Dipping in white or dark chocolate would be yummy too. I will make this again.

The addition of butter to this recipe makes a cookie more like shortbread than true Italian biscotte which never adds fat. I will try the seasonings, with a tbs and a half of pepper to a basic biscotti recipe minus the butter. This is definitely not a buiscotti but a good shortbread.

This recipe is perfect as is. I wouldn't suggest making any changes to these til you have made them for yourself and then make any alterations to suit your own taste. We had them with hot tea and red wine, but found they paired wonderfully with white wine as well. Please try these biscotti. They are some of the best we tasted and the kids loved them too.

Delicious!!! My first attempt at Biscotti and it worked. I put in the grated peel of a whole orange and a wee bit of it's juice too. Next I might dip the ends in melted White Chocolate. Then give them away so i don't eat them all.

I'm totally addicted to these! Made them for a holiday cocktail party, and had to fight the urge to hover over the plate and growl at anyone else who wanted one! Very peppery, not your usual sweet biscotti, but excellent!!!! Will make many times again (and may not share any of them!)

VERY GOOD. I added more pepper though and more lemon.Also, I cooked the logs only 30 min. so they were nice and fluffy (not hard). I will make this again for sure.

What a great addition to our biscotti collection. It is definitely not your ordinary cookie~ it makes you take another bite just out of curiousity! Everyone has really enjoyed the "spark" of flavor from the pepper. We added candied lemon peel.

The recipe sounded great, however I over did the pepper. Next time I'll put in a little less and up the amount of lemon peel. Despite this I liked it and would try it again. I like it because it isn't too sweet.

These are very close to an expensive peppery wine biscuit availabe at specialty food shops. They are wonderful with a glass of red wine - we loved them as did our guests. They are definitely not what most people expect from biscotti though!
