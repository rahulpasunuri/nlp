I made this recipe and was very nervous to cook one night as I was cooking for two chefs. They went crazy for this ice cream! I made half the recipe and served it with a small wedge of chocolate cake. The combination was very, very good. It was a dramatic presentation as well, very subtle and elegant. I would definitely make this again.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and I was very nervous because I was cooking for two chefs. They both went crazy for this ice cream! I did half of the recipe. I served it with a small wedge of chocolate cake, no frosting. It was a huge winner here.

I know people on this site freakout when people who have not made the recipe review one, but there's a much saner version of this recipe in Cooking Light that doesn't require 2 dozen eggs.

Tastes OK and makes a good bit, but 2 dozen egg yolks is nuts..

Two dozen egg yolks??? I guess you make a few angel food cakes to go with the ice cream???
