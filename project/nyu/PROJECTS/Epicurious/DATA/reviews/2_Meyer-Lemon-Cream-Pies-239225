I was highly disappointed in this recipe. It looked so good--and so easy--but the filling had no flavor! I ended up adding the juice of 1 more Meyer lemon and another 1/2 cup of confectioner's sugar, but that only made it passable. And it still didn't cover up the flavor of the silken tofu.

Yummy. My husband made this for me. Unable to find Meyer Lemons, he substituted key lime juice. We actually ate it the following day. The texture was very creamy , no chalky taste as another reviewer had noted. Mori-Nu silken was what was used. The filling itself would be a great sustitute for whipped cream on top of warm gingerbread or between ginger snaps then frozen for mini "icecream" sandwiches!

I liked this recipe. I have made similar with chocolate, and thought the lemon would be a nice summer sub. The tofu tasted chalky, and I used more lemon than recommended. LOTS MORE ZEST, for flavor. I also made one with limes, and added a bit of vanilla. Also, I added a dropper of vanilla, and topped them both with blueberries. They were OK. Probably would stick with the chocolate.

horrible recipe. it doesn't taste good. i used the silken firm tofu as recommended. i admit i've not let it cool for an hour. perhaps it gets better. a bigger problem is the amount of filling that is created for four small tartlett pans. mine hold about a half a cup of liquid when empty. when filled with crust, they hold much less. this recipe makes a blender full of filling when at most you need 1 1/4 cups. perhaps only one container of tofu was intended??? i grew those meyer lemons and i resent their sacrifice.

The tofu flavor should not be evident if you use "silken" tofu - especially Mori-Nu brand. Perhaps the reviewer used regular tofu.

Made this tonight-- it was awful. Added extra sugar and lemon juice, but the tofu flavor was overpowering.
