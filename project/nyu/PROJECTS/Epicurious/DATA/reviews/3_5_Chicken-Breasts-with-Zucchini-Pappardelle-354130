I discovered after reading the reviews and making a few changes myself, this dish can be amazing! First, I brown chunks of skinless-boneless chicken breast in coconut oil or butter, depending on my mood. Remove from pan and then brown some onions, garlic & mushrooms in more oil or butter, over med-low heat. After a few minutes, I like to de-glaze the pan with some white wine and sauté the veggies a little bit more, until slightly caramelized. Then remove everything from the pan. Add about 2 cups or more of chicken stock back into the pan, stirring the caramelized flavors up into the broth, and bring it to a low boil. Next, after thinly slicing the zucchini with both a julienne and multi-slicer blade on a mandolin, (giving it a spaghetti like appearance), half-blanche the zucchini pasta in the chicken stock for a minute or two. This gives it a pasta like firmness. Lastly, once the zucchini is at the consistency you like, put everything back into the pan and warm together for serving. Now you can add the basil, and this is when I like to add some sea salt and Braggs Liquid Aminos, to taste. When served with quinoa, this is one delish - dish! Aloha :)

This is good! I made it as written the first time with the exception of using chicken stock. But its also delicious using a white fish (used basa), and white wine instead of water, mmm.

I also de-healthified and changed the recipe, so this review is more about using this as a base. My changes: Blanched the zucchini to make it more pasta-like in consistency. Used skinless breast, cut into 2-inch pieces. Browned that in batches, then added onion, garlic and mushrooms to the pan with more olive oil. Then doused the pan with chicken stock to deglaze and get the browned bits. Added the chicken back in and simmered until cooked through, then threw in a little butter, some crumbled bacon, red pepper flakes, basil, and the zucchini to warm it up. Topped plates off with grated romano. Delicious! Again, I veered pretty far from the recipe but this is where I started and it's a great base.

I started making this recipe as written, but halfway through I realized that I had bought Thai basil, not sweet basil. I decided to roll with it, and added a little chopped ginger with the garlic, then finished with a few drops of soy sauce to complete the Asian theme. I also sauteed the zucchini for just a minute. It was delicious!

This is nice Zucchini recipe ! I also went with broth and white wine as some other reviewers. It will probably not get into my top 10 foods list, but definittely reccomended. This recipe is for all those, who love variety in food and don't like to turn same 20-30 recipes for whole life :).

Very nice combination. I dont care for raw zucinni soI sauted it for a very short time in the juice with a little butter and white wine.

The recipe itself was on the bland side, BUT the major take-away for me was preparing zucchini this way. Zucchini can be boring, but it was tender and tasty prepared through this method. We'll try it again with different -- and more -- herbs, spices and meats. The dish was also fast to make, a bonus on weeknights.

I liked the simplicity of this but nonetheless I found it was missing something. Maybe a dusting of Parmesan on top, or some bright yellow pepper strips sauteed along with it....

This was easy and delightful. I deglazed the pan with shallots, garlic, broth & white wine. I loved how the zucchini strips soaked up the resulting sauce.

I too deglazed with white wine to give it more flavor. Next time I make this, I'll probably use the shredder on my mandolin to make zucchini "noodles."

This is a great, simple, low carb dish. I cut the chicken into 1 inch slices and definitely use a peeler as the zucchini needs to be thin. I too went with deglazing the pan with white wine and added broth. I forgot to saute the garlic slices so added them while the sauce was reducing. It was still delicious. I like the idea of adding fresh grated parmesan and will do that next time.

We didn't really care for this. It is healthy, but just kind of bland. I won't bother trying this again.

Amazing! I was worried this might be bland, but it turned out wonderful! I had skinless breasts so I used those and I added a small amount of Pecorino Romano Cheese ontop. Can't wait to make this again!

This was an extremely simple and tasty dish. I used a wide vegetable peeler for the zucchini and it was easy enough. I deglazed the pan with a little white wine and then added some chicken stock. I served this with an asparagus risotto and also drizzled with a nice balsamic vinegar.

Use a potato peeler for the zucchini it's easier and makes a nice change for a staple veg.

Such a simple recipe, the only thing "complex" is shaving the zucchini, and that's not really hard just uses a lot of dishes (I used a blade attachment on my food processor). I thought it would lack flavor but the garlic and basil added a surprisingly great taste to the dish. Next time I'll probably cut the chicken into smaller strips (used skinless, boneless) just so it cooks faster and is easier to eat.

Simple and delicious. Used a vegetable peeler to prepare zucchini and broth in place of water per reviews. Boneless skinless checken too. It's a keeper for a healthy easy meal. May substitute some shaved parmesan for basil next time.

Loved this and so did my son. I used a vegetable peeler and chicken broth instead of water. Easy, delicious and healthy. Thank you!

I didn't have high hopes for this recipe, but we ended up very pleasantly surprised by the sheer simplicity of it. We used skinless chicken breasts and a little extra olive oil. I think with a recipe like this, it's about the freshness of the ingredients and little touches like good-quality olive oil -and a mandoline so the zucchini is sliced thin and cooks so lightly that it has a nice crunch.

I do have a mandoline, shaved the zucchini into thin slices. Would not make this again, family felt it just didn't have enough flavor.

What a quick and delicious way to use zucchini! My neighbors gave me a huge zucchini today and this recipe's presentation and simplicity caught my eye. I loved the way the juices from the chicken and garlic combined with the thin zucchini slices for a fabulous flavor. I too used chicken broth rather than water, and although I didn't have any fresh basil it still turned out well.

This is a great recipe - its quick to prepare and nice and light. The kids even liked it!

Hm, I should have read the earlier reviews about adding broth and vinegar! I found this dish to be pretty bland when prepared per the recipe's ingredients.

super easy. simple and delicious. used a vegetable peeler for the zucchini. it was a very interesting way to serve zucchini. a great mix to the standard summer vegetable array. yum!

This is a great little recipe and so easy. I do not own a slicer, so I tried to slice the zucchini as thin as I could (1/4 inch), and I sauteed it with the garlic to thin it out. I also substituted the water with chicken broth as suggested by others. I used zucchini and basil from my garden, yummy! I will definitely make this one again.

Excellent, flavorful, easy, quick weeknight meal. I shaved my zucchini the night before and put it in a plastic bag. Took it out and got it to room temperature before making this tonight. I love zucchini and garlic, so it had me right there.

This is a really delicious warm-weather dish. Preparing the thin zucchini slices may sound arduous, but a sharp vegetable peeler does the trick with relative ease. I've made it a couple of times and recommend it highly.

I liked the ingredients in this recipe. In order to ensure the chicken was tender, I added lemon and lemon pepper to the chicken. The only thing I would do differently is slice the zucchini thinner. 1/8-inch seemed to take a while to wilt and I had to keep it on the skillet to soften. I would suggest 1/16-inch or thinner.

Totally agree with the review below, great summer recipe. I took the suggestion and added broth instead of water, it added a nice dimension to the mix and helped to thicken up the sauce. I also added about a 1/4 cup of toasted sliced almonds and sauteed them in the pan with the garlic slivers. A great way to sneak some veggies into the boyfriend's dinner!

This was easy and a perfect summer meal, with a few changes. First, use broth instead of water to deglaze the pan and second, add a drizzle of balsamic vinager. Also pine nuts are a good add.
