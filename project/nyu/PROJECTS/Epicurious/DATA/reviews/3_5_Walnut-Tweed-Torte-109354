Superb. Lovely flavors of toasted walnut, chocolate, and orange coming shining through. Moist, light, and flavorful -- a hit with guests. Not hard to make. A keeper.

A very delicious, elegant cake, which I served with a dusting of KLP powdered sugar. Following suggestions, I did place some parchment paper on the bottom of the springform pan and, therefore, didn't have any problem removing it. Because I only had Belgian bittersweet chocolate chips, I couldn't not grate the chocolate, but instead chop it fairly finely. The result was just fine and far less work than grating the chocolate. I would definitely make it again.

This looks wonderful, but where do you get kosher-for-Passover vanilla? It almost always has corn syrup in it, even the best ones... I think I"ll take a vanilla bean and stick it in the sugar and just use that. That ought to be kosher, right?

This is a delicious cake and it was a big hit at Passover. I would make it again for the holiday and at other times.

This cake always gets rave reviews and is definitely worth the effort. It's good enough to eat not on Passover. I would grease/parchment the bottom of the pan but not the sides. I think the cake needs to cling to the sides to get tall enough.

I didn't have a spring form pan, so i used a cake pan, buttered and floured with matzah meal, it turned out great!

Does anyone know if this cake would work with regular all-purpose flour instead of matzo meal?

If you cut a piece of parchment paper the shape of your pan and put it in the pan before filling it with the batter, you will never have a problem with removing the cake after it is baked.

This cake was very light and had a nice orange flavor that complemented the chocolate. Like the previous reviewer, I, too, had a little trouble getting the cake out of the pan...whipped cream would have been a nice option for a dairy meal.

I made this for my family's Passover seder, and everyone loved it. I iced the cake with a lightly sweetned/vanilla-enhanced whipped cream, which was the perfect complement to the nutty, rich texture of the cake. I did have a bit of trouble getting the cake cleanly out of the pan, but the icing hid any deformities.
