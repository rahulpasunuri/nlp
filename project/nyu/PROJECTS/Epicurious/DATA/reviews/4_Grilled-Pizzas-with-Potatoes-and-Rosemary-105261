We make a lot of pizza and this is one of our favorite toppings. Grilling pizza can be tricky, the initial transfer to the grill being the tough part. And the dough cooks very fast on a hot grill so you need to top quickly or you risk burning it. Just as tasty when cooked in the oven, you just don't get that nice flavor that only the grill can impart. When done right on the grill, the dough comes out like naan bread.

This was delicious. The dough was especially good - I've used it on a number of other types of pizza. Baked at 500 degrees instead of grilling and didn't chill the dough beforehand. Might try adding bacon, carmelized onions, or blue cheese next time for a little more flavor.

Fabulous! Paired it with Louis and Martini Cabernet for wine club. Both the wine and appetizer received rave reviews. I'm getting ready to make it again and realized I did not share my comments. First, I made the dough in my bread machine. Instead of letting it chill in the fridge, I immediately put it on a foiled tray. It was actually easier to spread it out this way and the results were wonderful. I never grilled it.

This was fabulous! I made this to pair with our Cabernet we brought to our wine club. Snooth.com, a wine web site, made this appetizer suggestion. (by the way, the wine was Louis and Martini which the group considered the best in the group $10-$15 wines). I made the pizza dough in the bread machine and did not let it sit up to chill as it stated. I placed the dough immediately on foil and cooked it in the oven. VERY easy to form this way. I loved the cornmeal taste with the potatoes and rosemary; it gave it an earthy taste. Rave reviews by all.

For speed, try using the microwave to cook Idaho baking potatoes until done, (about 9 minutes). Peel, slice and set aside. Then split and toast the outer sides of bagels under the broiler. Turn the bagels so that the soft inner sides are facing up in broiler pan. Top with slices of potato, drizzled olive oil, coarse salt, ground pepper, a hint of rosemary or thyme, a few pitted olives and lots of freshly grated Pecorino Romano. Broil until cheese bubbles and begins to turn golden. Eat immediately!

These were very good. I don't think they were exciting enough for an entree but they'd be a wonderful side. I think a wedge or two next to some scrambled eggs with chives and a green salad would be a terrific brunch menu.

Very good- I cooked it in the oven at 500 degrees for 8 minutes rather than grilling and it worked well.

This is a great easy recipie. During the colder months I make this in the oven with, dare I say it, Boboli.
