This is a great recipe and a keeper. However, my real "southern friends" wanted good ol' barbecue sauce on their ribs...which was easy enough to do. Just pour bottled sauce or make your own and pour over ribs and grill.

Have made this many times and love it every time. Guests think a lot of work into the preparation. I now always stock the teriyaki glaze.

Easy and tasty! All the ingredients that are in the cupboard. I did add 4 garlic cloves. It seemed boring without it and added a bit more chili garlic sauce to give it a bit of a punch

I cheated and used the sauce on pork chops - pretty tasty!

This is one of my favorite recipes and is always a crowd pleaser. A good teriyaki sauce baste is the brand "House of Tsang" that you can get at the ethnic aisle in a grocery store (be sure to get the teriyaki style because they have other style sauces). I also prefer to use spareribs instead of baby back ribs for this recipe. Also, although it is a little more time consuming, smoking these ribs with hickory chips as specified by the recipe makes all the difference.

Excellent recipe, I made this for the first time on Memorial day and everyone loved it, made it again on Fathers day with baby back ribs instead of larger spareribs and it was just as good as the first time, now everyone wants the recipe! Simple and delicious.

I made these ribs for a Labor Day barbecue. This is the first time I have been able to prepare pork ribs that were tender and flavorful. I plan to use the foil-bake method for any ribs that I prepare no matter that the subsequent marinade. But this marinade was very flavorful.

a hint of spice, but very nice.!!!
