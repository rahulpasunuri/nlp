Time consuming but delicious! The previous leg of lamb I roasted had such a strong mutton flavor it was inedible, so I removed all the visible fat from this one because I read that's where the muttony flavor resides. I wasn't even thinking about that when I wrote this recipe was time consuming: it was the rolling and tying that took time and patience. A whole butterflied leg of lamb is a very loosey-goosey affair. To make it easier, I rolled it like you do sushi or a jelly roll: I arranged the meat into an approximate rectangle on a piece of plastic wrap and used the plastic wrap to lift the meat. After it was all tied up, I smushed the loose stuffing into the folds of the meat with my fingers and laid the roast on a bed of herb sprigs. I added an egg to the stuffing because several reviewers complained about it not staying in the roast. I also added about 10 ounces of good, mild, diced feta. For the greens, I used a mixture of chard, kale and mustard greens. I didn't measure the other ingredients precisely, just approximately. The meat was delicious and tender, but I agree with other reviewers that it should be roasted at a lower temperature. I cooked mine exactly as directed and removed at exactly 136 degrees (hottest reading of several), but the meat was only very faintly pinkish. It looked well-done, not medium-rare.

Made for New Year's Eve Buffet. People loved it. I agree that 425 is probably too hot and a lower, longer roast would make a more even pink.

Made a modified version of this: excluded chard and made the mushroom/room "stuffing" without cream or breadcrumbs. Had shitakes, cremini, and chantrelles. Then used Julia Child's method for roasted leg of lamb (from Mastering the Art...). Was excellent. Served it with JC's Potato Gratin Provencal and buttered french green beans. The gratin is amazaing, especially with all the great tomaotes we have now.

We've made this lamb several times and absolutely love it. I'd recommend on cutting down on the stuffing though

I prepared this wonderful dish for guests last evening. Shiitake and portabella were used and shallots were substituted for the onion. We doubled the recipe for the stuffing and put in oven 35 minutes before the roast was done. When we pulled the roast out, we split the aus jus between topping the roast and the extra We are glad we made the extra, most of it is gone as well! We started with a boneless leg of lamb, which required 7 bamboo skewers to put back together, and then we tied it in 4 places. It was carved at the table and made quite a hit in terms of presentation and flavor. Some guests asked for mint jelly, so we suggest preparing a mint reduction sauce in advance to have on hand. There is a good recipe on this site.

I have made this twice and both times it turned out well with the following changes. After 15 minutes I turn the heat down to 350 degrees and my 6.5 lb roast still cooked in about 70 minutes. (I use a convection oven.) We like the meat medium rare--around 130 degrees when we take the meat out to rest(per Julia Child). I make the stuffing as directed but change the mixture on the outside of the meat. After rubbing the meat with oil I apply a thin layer of Dijon mustard, then much more thyme, rosemary and minced garlic than directed in the recipe. I use the minced garlic instead of slices inserted into the meat.

Very good recipe, and the stuffing is perfect as written. Could it be better? What about shallots instead of onions? Also note that the Joy of Cooking gives a lower internal temp for medium rare--I would suggest checking temp at 1 hour and 10 minutes. If you're fanatical about having the meat very pink, as I am, remember that temp will rise as the meat rests. Before rolling the meat, have a couple of bamboo BBQ skewers at the ready to plunge through the meat and hold it while you tie--then you can do without the extra set of hands.

I made this for Christmas using a combination of fresh and dried mushrooms. This is delicious and will be made again and again. We had one vegetarian in our group. I made the stuffing recipe through to the paragraph "Preheat oven..." and reserved about a cup of it. I browned two Tofurky steakletts in olive oil. In a baking dish I layered the stuffing between the two steakletts, seasoned with salt and pepper a bit extra of rosemary, thyme and garlic, drizzled with olive oil and baked until warmed through. I used the mushroom soaking water and some wine to add to the baking dish to keep it from drying out. He loved it and was not relegated to just side dishes

I wasn't as thrilled with this as other cooks. The lamb itself was delicious, of course, but I found the stuffing to be heavy (I used ground lamb and rainbow chard) and I didn't really enjoy its texture. It was okay, but I'd make something else next time.

I used spinach instead of chard (couldn't find chard). Took two people to roll and tie but it was worth it. Dinner party guests really liked it. It kind of falls apart when you cut it--I'm not sure how to handle that. Smelled great cooking, too.

Outstanding! Unbelievably good. I had a little difficulty keeping all the stuffing rolled into the lamb, but it didn't affect the taste. Prepared it for a passover seder, so substituted matza meal and non dairy creamer for the breadcrumbs and whipping cream. I don't think these substitutions hurt the resulting taste at all. I will definitely make this again.

This was phenomenal. I decided to make this last year, 2005 for Christmas to impress myhusbands parents. Well I impressed myself for pulling it off. The flavors from teh mushroom chard stuffing complement the lamb so well. This is truely a great dish. It does take some love int he preparation stages, but a good glass of wine some music make it all worth while.

This was a truly wonderful recipe. The stuffing is good in other contexts too. We had leftover stuffing that I used to make a phenomenal omelette (a phenomelette!) We added some salt to the recipe, and we also substituted some spinach when we ran out of chard -- results were great.

This was quite delicious. I changed some of the ingredients and it came out fine. I minced chicken for the stuffing as I am not big on minced veal, beef or pork...I got very good reviews!

This was the BEST lamb I have had in a long time. Moist, with lots of umame. I rarely want to lick the bottom of the pan and I had a hard time not succumbing.

Delicious! I pureed the lamb after it was done to the consistency of pate and served it with Ritz Crackers -- very classy

I made this for our Easter dinner this year (2005)....it was beyond fabulous! I followed the recipe exactly. My family went crazy, went back for seconds, wanted thirds but the platter was clean. Claimed it was the best lamb dish they ever ate. It was a beautiful presentation also. A winner!

I substituted swiss chard for kale, and used a mixture of portobello, shiitake and chanterelle mushrooms and forgot the extra ground meat, but it was still a success.

This was outstanding. I had the butcher trim off all fel and fat. Used spinach instead of chard. It is somewhat work intensive, but since the stuffing can be mostly done the day before, I was able to relax and socialize while lamb was roasting. I did need a helping hand in the tying, just to hold together tightly while I tied. So worth the effort. Even guests that did not care for lamb loved it.

I have fixed this twice, substituting baby spinach for the chard and adding morel mushrooms to increase the variety of wild mushrooms. Both times our guests asked if they could take leftovers home.

Made this for Easter dinner, to rave reviews. One guest said it was the best lamb dish she had ever eaten. We used a boneless leg and made a bigger pocket by slicing it ourselves...awkward, ungainly, and required two people to stuff and tie, but it worked. For the stuffing, we left out the cream. We sauteed the ground pork with the onion, because we wanted the lamb rare and were afraid that the pork would not be cooked. Additions to the stuffing included 3/4 cup crumbled feta (as in another stuffed lamb recipe on this site) and toasted pine nuts. We had stuffing left over, which we baked separately. Roasted 20 min/pound, the lamb came out perfectly and juicy, no sauce needed. Served with sauteed asparagus and basmati rice made like the Spiced Quinoa Timbales on this site, with the substitution of apples for tomatoes. I can't comment on how the lamb leftovers tasted; there weren't any!!

This was great even though I stuck the thermometer into the spinach I used instead of the lamb and overcooked it so the lamb ended up chewy :-P The flavors inside and out are great. This would be a great way to make a pork loin as well.

This was great! I changed it a bit by using spinach, adding feta cheese and pine nuts. I also omitted the bread crumbs because I didn't have any. My boyfriend was very impressed for Valentine's Day. The filling was sooo good. If you're looking for a lamb dish, this one is a keeper!

Superb! As I am an avid cook, I found this to be a "no-brainer" recipe. For those of you who have never tied a roast, make sure you have another set of hands to help. I used veal, but I'll try with pork the next time. I can definitely see many variables in this recipe, such as adding some Parmesan-Reggiano, subbing wine for cream, etc. Overall, a keeper for sure.

This is a wonderful dish, but not either easy nor quick to prepare. I made three of these roasts for a group of about 24 people and the dish was a smash. The wild mushrooms add a wonderfully delicate flavor to the lamb. Be sure to tie the roast securely, which will save you time and effort when you go to slice off individual pieces.

I've made this several times to rave reviews. For a special meal, what I've done is to use this Rx with rack of lamb, putting the stuffing in the center of four racks tied together in a square crown shape. Absolutely fabulous,and actually easier than trying to roll up the butterflied piece. To serve, I first show the guests the stuffed crown, then cut the racks and serve the ribs around the stuffing. Still looks great. Look up receipes for crown roast of lamb for the timing, etc. And don't leave out the veal please - I think it makes it - I tried once, cause I didn't have any, and it was nice, but not scruptious. I've tried both spinach and chard - both equally good.

My spouse was impressed with the reviews....and it is sometimes hard for us to get leg of lamb in Southern Maryland (versus everything that is available in Alexandria), yet the butcher butterflied it and the stuffing was likewise everywhere, but it was all very delicious. Had to use spinach instead of chard which was not available, but we were able to get various mushrooms. Exceptional flavor, and funky just as Stuffed Ham is in Southern Maryland. Just a different take that was very nice.

Impressive Easter dish. Made it twice and found that the stuffing is much better with the grnd pork vs veal. As long as the butcher butterflys the lamb properly, this dish is not that difficult. Cooked it the 2nd time over charcoal on the Webber - got the raves it deserved.

I left out the veal, substituted spinach, and only used basic button mushrooms (there are limitations out in the middle of nowhere). This was beyond words. It was time consuming, but not difficult. The only problem I encountered was that I forgot skewers or twine to tie the roast with so it didn't really end up 'stuffed' but who cares? It was one of the most delicious messes I've ever eaten. The lamb was tender ans savory, and the stuffing, oh my lord, it's amazing that any of it actually got into the lamb!! My mother and I kept spooning it out of the bowl. I cook lamb a lot and this is now one of my very favorite recipes.

"Difficult to stuff and tie" and "time consuming" are understatements. This is really a lot of work. Yes, it is delicious. Yes, everyone loved it, but I'll make something else next time.

I used spinach, as did others. Mushrooms used were shitake, crimini, and portabella. I subsituted ground turkey for the veal, as my daughters-in-law do not eat red meat and I thought they might like the stuffing as a side dish. The recipe was a bit time consuming and the mushrooms weren't cheap! We eat lamb often and we all found the recipe to be pretty ordinary. The side dish of leftover stuffing, with extra crumbs and some cream, was not a hit, either.

Rating: 4
Very impressive dish. Presentation is beautiful. Taste incredible. Not difficult to make. I use fresh shiitake and dry porcini. Instead of cream, I use liquid from porcini mushrooms. I made this dish twice. Goes great with basmati rice pilaf with raisins.

We made this lovely leg of lamb for Christmas and it has been resoundingly requested again for Easter. It is labor-intensive however. I learned my lesson on Christmas and have said I'll make it and a potato dish, but have farmed out other cooking duties to the family.

This was a labour intensive roast that was worth every ounce of effort. The chopping, slicing, sauteing, stirring, combining, and ultimately, eating was satisfying. I struggled to get it all tied up with the filling intact. Didn't matter a wit, after it had cooked I added a little wine and broth and brought to the boil, touch of cream and we had a wonderful gravy.

This was a huge hit at our Fall dinner party. The flavors are fantastic. I substituted spinach as the other person did, and didn't bother with the veal. It was really great and I got numerous requests for the recipe. Great leftovers also!

This dish was complicated and time consuming, however the rewards were were it. It was a big success at our dinner party. Keeping the stuffing inside as it was being rolled was a challenge.

Great meal...loved the diversity and taste of the ingredients. The next time I make it, I will omit the veal as it didn't make a huge difference to me. I would also do something with the drippings on the bottom of the roasting pan.

delicious, complex flavours. Best lamb roast yet!

This recipe was terrific. We made a few changes to adjust for our taste, but think it would have been just as good using the original version. Not being Swiss Chard fans we substituted spinach, chopping while raw and adding it to the mushroom mixture during the last minute or two of the saute process to wilt. We also omitted the veal. We served it with grilled polenta and savored every bite!
