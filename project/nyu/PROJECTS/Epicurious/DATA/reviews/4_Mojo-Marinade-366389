I cannot say enough good things about this marinade. It is SO full of bright flavor. I used it to marinade a flank steak overnight and oh my god was it amazing. I want to use this marinade on everything.

This came together in just a few minutes and was so flavorful! I used bottled OJ, leaves from our Cuban oregano plant, and only one jalapeño (so that we could serve it to our toddler). I threw everything in a dish in the morning and put the chops on the grill when we got home from work (10 or 11 hours later) and they were wonderful - served with cous cous and wilted spinach.

This recipe was so delicious! I kept the ratios the same but cut the recipe in half as I was only making dinner for two and a toddler. Everyone loved it and it was plenty to marinate four bone in pork chops. I marinated the chops in a zip top bag then grilled them. I poured the remaining marinade into a sauce pan on the stove where I boiled it down a bit then served it on top of the chops and some quinoa. It was great. Husband and son loved it! Will be using this one again and again.

you haven't lived until you've tried this marinade, do yourself a favor .. a Cuban friend turned me on to this when I lived in FL and I've been using it ever since..10 yrs.. tastes great on chicken, I leave it in the marinade when cooking, Cubans don't remove it, that's good enough for me
