I made this for Christmas this year and everyone is still talking about this cake! After reviewing others comments I made the following modifications. To the filling I added a teaspoon of coconut extract. For the cake I folded in 3 egg whites which were whipped to a firm peak. Everything else was done as written except I didn't toast the coconut since I wanted a pure white cake for christmas. Next time I might try the simple syrup prior to applying the filling. Overall 4 forks for sure!!

This cake was awesome. Time consuming and expensive, but my husband is in the food industry and VERY picky. He really liked it. I will make it again for a special opinion.

Now I love Epicurious, but out of respect for the true glorious cake that gives anyone one more reason to visit Charleston, I must point out that this is NOT Chef Carter's Peninsula Grille Coconut Cake. A quick scan of the ingredients will tell anyone who's had the cake that there is simply not enough volume of ingredients to turn out that cake. For those who want the true recipe for this one, Martha Stewart has it on her website. Happy Baking!

Great cake!! Have beeen making it for years. Not neccesarily dense but stury enough to stand up to the filling without turning to mush. Is a little crumbly and would definately recommend using wax paper your cake pans.

This is an absolute favorite, especially the filling. I have been making this cake for 9 years. Being a purist, I always use a seven minute icing instead of the cream cheese as listed here. I also use a can of coconut milk for the cake. A practice I use on all cakes, following Julia Child, simple syrup is added to each layer before assembling. Beautiful and deeeeelicious.

I have been making this cake for six years now. It is totally awesome. I take it to all occasions and never have any left to bring home! I make the filling a day ahead, it makes the process go a little faster.I noticed one reviewer said they didn't like it because it was so dense, it's not a Betty Crocker box!

AMAZING! Love this cake! Not only is is Beautiful, it tastes great and is a spectacular presentation. I have made this cake for my father's birthday as well as for other family celebrations. Followed the recipe almost to the T - unusual for me! If you love coconut, you'll love this cake! ENJOY!

I used the recipe at Martha Stewart's site. It was awesome. I received many rave reviews on the cake. Other then whipping the filling in two batches (my 5 qt KA couldn't handle the load) the recipe went as stated. The cake resembled corn bread..a large crumb and very yellow but the final product was very tasty. I highly recommend the recipe on Martha's site. http://www.marthaste wart.com/portal/site /mslo/menuitem.fc77a 0dbc44dd1611e3bf410b 5900aa0/? vgnextoid=a95264c02a 752110VgnVCM1000003d 370a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt =default&rsc=also_tr y

This is not the recipe for the Peninsula Grill coconut cake. The measurements are incorrect for example: filling should be 9 cup shredded coconut 3 cups of sugar 5 cups heavy cream 1 lb butter +++ others the layers must be assembled using symple sugar...

my thanks to the previous reviewer who mentioned the martha stewart site. i recently was in charleston and had the coconut cake at the peninsula grill. very good. the martha stewart version is, or at least appears to be, the real deal. i actually made both recently and much prefer the stewart version. the cake is tastier; includes coconut extract. the frosting is better. 2 to 1 butter to cream cheese as opposed to this version which is 2 to 1 cream cheese to butter. one could certainly apply the techniques shown in the video to this cake which would improve this cake. if nothing else, watching the video was very educational.

I made this cake twice. I read all the reviews before making it. The first time, the cake was very crumbly and would have been incredibly dry had I not used simple syrup to moisten the cake layers. So, the second time, I reduced the butter in the cake batter by one stick as one reviewer suggested and folded in 3 egg whites into the cake batter as another reviewer suggested. The second time, the cake was a bit better but still pretty dense and somewhat crumbly. After searching on the internet for some other reviews of this recipe, I found a video on Martha Stewart's website of Peninsula Grill's Chef Robert Carter making this cake. The recipe was completely different. I think some recipe editor edited the recipe along the way with the end result being multiple reviewers complaining that the cake is too crumbly and dense. The recipe on Martha' website is materially different. The butter and sugar is creamed for 5-6 minutes until light and fluffly as opposed to just blended as this recipe suggests. The butter used is a European butter (Plugra) that has a higher butterfat content. The coconut for the filling is pulverized in a food processor before being added to the cream and butter custard. This recipe misses that step. Also, the cake is baked in two 10-inch pans and each cake is split into thirds for a combined 6- layer cake where the layers are moistened with simple syrup. All of these things make a difference. I will bake once again using the recipe on Martha's website and report back.

This was one of the best coconut cakes ever--the only change I made was to whip 3 of the egg whites and then when the batter was done I folded the whipped egg whites in the batter. This made the cake very light. Very good

I just gobbled down a slice of this cake that I made this weekend for my husband's birthday and I had to write a review. This is a great cake for special occasions! It is a bit of work, but well worth it. I made the icing and the filling the night before. I followed the advice of others and I reduced the amount of sugar in the frosting to 1 cup. It was plenty sweet for my taste. In addition, I used low-fat cream cheese and the frosting tasted great. You won't be able to taste the difference. For the cake, I also reduced the sugar to 2 cups and it tasted great. I was feeling ambitious so I decided to split the three layers and make a six layer cake. If you double the filling recipe, you will have plenty for the extra layers. One piece of advice that I could have used while baking was to rotate my cake pans halfway through the cooking time. My cakes were a bit lopsided, and the unevenness is exaggerated when you are piling up six layers. One major important tip - check the cake as early as 25 minutes in the oven. I followed the advice of a review and checked at 28 minutes. The cakes were a little dry around the edges, but I wish I would have taken them out a little bit sooner. Overall, this cake was a huge hit at our party. Out of 15 guests, not one person refused to have a slice and they didn't leave much on their plates when we cleaned up!

I have made this recipe several times. I would recommend letting the cake sit overnight in room temperature (not in the frig) allowing the filling flavors to penetrate the layers a little more. I have made this cake in a three and four layer tower. It is always a favorite.

It was a hit! Many guests commented on the beautiful presentation. I cut the sugar, - granulated and powdered - just added less than called for. Also, I did not use sweetened flaked coconut, but simply flaked coconut from the bin at Whole Foods. Sweetened coconut is too sweet. Excellent recipe.

Swooned over this cake at the Peninsula Grill a few years back. I added 1 tsp. of pure coconut extract (from La Cuisine in Alexandria, VA) in addition to the vanilla to the batter, and took the cake out a full 10 minutes earlier. PERFECT. Not just a keeper, but THE recipe for Father's Day and my husband's birthday. An artery- buster, so slice it thinly!

This cake turned out very well. I made a few changes. I used 2 ten inch cake pans and torted the cakes. I doubled the filling recipe. I did not toast the coconut. This cake got me some serious raves from family and people I didn't know. At first they thought it was from a bakery. The next time I make it I am going to substitute some of thecream in the cake with coconut milk and see how it turns out. The cake batter is pretty thick. Cake was very moist. I will be making this again. It is a real diet buster.

Cakes are dry because they are overbaked! Use the cooking time as a SUGGESTION. I always start checking for doneness (with a cake tester) about 10 minutes before the state time. My cakes are moist!

Just came back from South Carolina and order this at the Peninsula Grill. Previously, I had made the cake and found it dry. Anxious to try the 'real deal', I questioned the waiter who informed me that the layers are sprinkled liberally with simple syrup before the cake is assembled. They use a squirt bottle to do it. This recipe omits that step. The results? Certainly not dry but the sugar syrup soak made this original cloyingly sweet. I'd never want to add that step. Still, a great filling and frosting. I'll now make this with a different cake recipe. Sorry for the long winded review....

I think this is a great recipe. I've made it twice now, and it was great both times. I've had it in the restaurant as well. This recipe produces similar results. I split the cake layers in half. This might the solve the problem for anyone who found the cake dry.

Delicious cake! Rave reviews from "everyone"! It is a huge cake!! It served 16 easily by slicing down the middle and then sideways instead of wedges. I did not know how to "toast" coconut and put it under the broiler and I thought it dried it out a lot but later found an article about toasting it by putting it in a 350 degree oven for about 15 mins. I will use this method next time I make it. I think maybe you could add this information in with the recipe so that others like me who don't know how to toast coconut will know how when making the cake.

Made it twice exactly as listed. Next time, I'll split the layers and figure out someway to get a little chocolate involved. Stored in the refrigerater with a chocolate cake. The little bit of chocolate that mixed in added a nice flavor. For those that commented on cake being left on the plate, This probably serves closer to 24 than 12.

Looks can be deceiving. This cake looked great, in fact, it looked spectacular. Unfortunately, it was disappointing when finally cut and served. The cake packs an incredibly high proportion of fat - butter, eggs, sour cream, cream cheese - which would lead the baker to think it would be moist and tender. It wasn't. The crumb was coarse, it was dry and it was crumbly. The filling is wonderful, the frosting even better. The flavor of the cake was flat and did nothing to show off the coconut. This is not a difficult cake to make by any stretch of the imagination, and the ease and simplicity of it make it appealing. The final product, though, just isn't worth it.

Yes, this cake is dense, it is rich, but nothing to complain about because it is yummy, yummy, yummy. I have made it 2 or 3 times now and everyone thinks I buy it. I love coconut and so next time I make this I am going to try to lift the flavor so that its not so pound cake-ish or so much like a butter cake, but more coconutty flavor. I already add a bit of coconut & almond extract to the batter, but I want to try to add some cream of coconut to it. I will post results! NOTE: Only VERY lightly toast coconut - tastes better that way. PLEASE TRY THIS RECIPE!!!

I made this cake for a work birthday celebration. What a hit! Yummy and beautiful! People said that it looked like a professional made it. It is very rich, but it is very, very good. What does one expect from a coconut cake, but richness and goodness? I think next time, I may slice the layers (as others have mentioned) to lighten the layers some. It baked beautifully, and turned out very moist. But, I agree that you need to watch it like a hawk in the oven ...

Excellent cake - I made it for Easter and not only was it beautiful but the flavor is fantastic. The only reason I didn't give it four forks was because it wasn't overtly "coconut". It was definately a part of the cake but it didn't scream it. The cake portion was actually very nutral - dense and moist which others have reported. Almost a cake version of shortbread which plays well with the light coconut filling and rich cream cheese frosting. I stuck to the recipe but I made two 9 inch cakes (instead of 3), split each layer so I had 3 layers of filling (made a double batch), single batch of frosting which just covered the cake but I feel it would have been too rich if I'd added more. Even so - it's very rich and a thin slice will do you. I tried it out on family - looking forward to making it for a brunch baby shower this summer. Should be excellent with coffee. Enjoy!

This cake was great though certainly a heavy dessert. I followed the advice of other reviews and closely watched the baking time- I ended up baking it for 28 minutes. It wasn't at all dry. I also sliced the 3 layers in half to make 6 layers which worked out well. Everyone really enjoyed this cake. It made a beautiful presentation- it looked like a masterpiece- something out of a bakery. It is dense (making it quite filling), so it's very easy for your eyes to be bigger than your stomach with this one! I garnished it with a strawberry fanned out on top which just made it even prettier. All in all, it was very good, but I would not recommend wearing fitted clothing when eating this cake! You'll be stuffed!

wonderful cake - everyone i served it to loved it. it is very heavy, though, don't eat a big piece and then try to sleep. I used baker's sugar and cake flour and watched cakes carefully to make sure they didn't overbake. I served it with lime ice cream, which i made using vanilla ice cream, lime juice and lime zest. I used real ice cream, but i think it might actually work better with frozen yogurt - I prefer a less creamy texture with citrus falvors.

It was a time consuming cake but definitely delicious.....I double sifted the flour which helped make a lighter cake.....also poked holes with a toothpick and brushed Kahlua over each cake layer......also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese for the frosting, worked quite well......

This cake was awesome! I made it for a birthday dinner party and it got rave reviews. I followed suggestions and made it into a 6 layer cake, and started checking whether it was done starting at 25 minutes (one of the layers was done that fast, but one did take 35 minutes). I also used cake flour (my box said to add 2 Tbsp more cake flour for every cup of all purpose flour in a recipe, so I did do that) and bakers sugar, and the texture of the cake was very light and airy. I would highly recommend it! I think I could have used more filling though - it is probably too much for 3 layers, but it gets pretty thin for 6 layers. Also, when the cake was cut, it was hard to tell there were 6 layers. I think next time I might shave some dark chocolate onto each layer of filling so you can see the demarcation.

I made this cake x 2 as a birthday cake for my twin girls. The coconut filling absolutely makes the cake. The sour cream added a great twist. Because it was for a "pink party", I coloured the filling pink and didn't use the toasted coconut for the topping. I would like to try it sometime with the recommended icing and toasted coconut. I had to make the cake kid-friendly this time.

I have made this cake and received great compliments. I will make it again. I was very fortunate to be able to go to Charleston and have a piece of this cake. One thing that they did that was not mentioned in the recipe was to split the layers and have six instead of three. It was very light and moist, and worth every cent!

Made this for my coworkers with a couple of changes. One cut the sugar by about 1/2C in both filling and cake. Substituted 1/2C butter with 1/2C of Coconut milk in the cake. Used the 7 minute frosting instead of the cream cheese. Cake was dense but very moist. The denseness was countered by the light frosting. Really great, no hesitation making it again. Lots of raves from my coworkers.

I altered the recipe after making it the first time. Since then, people go nuts for this cake. I found the original cake too heavy & dense, so I decreased the amount of butter, sifted the flour & I also added coconut milk. This makes the cake not so heavy. Once you've adjusted it to your taste, it is a cake that no one will ever forget.

My daughter requested a coconut cake for her birthday and we picked this recipe after reading quite a few others, but made some adjustments based on raters' comments. Noting opinions on its dryness, shortage of flavor and overly sweetness, I decreased the sugar in the cake batter by 1/2 cup and replaced it with 1/3 cup of canned sweetened cream of coconut. I also added 1/2 c. coconut cream and an additional cup of confectioners sugar to the frosting recipe. The cake was still slightly drier than I would consider ideal, but it was a big hit! Though sliced thinly, it was so rich most people couldn't finish their servings. We decided a deli slicer might be in order for cutting pieces thin enough for most people to be able to finish! Despite its outrageous richness there were a couple of guests who ate seconds! Someone who said they didn't even like coconut commented that it was a delicious cake. Someone else described it as a dream cake. My 17 yr old daughter was tickled with it. If someone requests a coconut cake I'd make it again. I might try 1/2 c. of the cream of coconut in the batter and also pull the cake from the oven a little sooner and see if that helps with the dryness problem.

Man, this cake is dense (which can also be read as dry). I thought it was way too heavy and pretty much flavorless. Granted some of this should be expected from the ingredients, but I hoped for something a little more flavorful considering the ridiculous amount of butter in it.

This is a delicious cake which is addictive if you really love a good white cake with lots of coconut. My only modifications: I used 1/2 cup LESS sugar for the actual cake batter and felt that the sugar may even be able to be reduced another 1/4 cup. Also, I used Swansdown Cake Flour which made the cake have a gorgeous texture and was lily white when baked. Frosting - I used a little over half of the completed frosting recipe and felt that to use all of the frosting would have been way too rich and overwhelming. This is an excellent, showstopper cake. It can be beautifully decorated for seasons with goldleaf mint leaves, etc. Do not waste this recipe on people who do not appreciate the difference between real, from-scratch cakes and souped-up cake mix and pudding recipes. This cake is scrumptious. The filling is excellent.

I made this for a co-worker's birthday after seeing the Peninsula Grill featured on a cooking show. I doubled the filling and cut the cake layers in half, and used vanilla bean instead of vanilla extract for the frosting (just as they showed it at the Peninsula Grill). I topped it off with some chocolate leaves (white and dark) and a few strawberries. Great recipe.

Excellent recipe! I took the recommendation and used half and half in the filling and the cake. It was perfect. I decided to use a different icing as I thought the cream cheese frosting would be too heavy following the meal we were having. I used the old fashioned Seven Minute Frosting which complimented the cake and filling beautifully! I have already had two requests for the recipe.

This is the best cake I have ever eaten! We made this for a large party and the guests raved. I got up in the middle of the night to eat some then had more with my coffee in the morning. Absolutely delicious. Cooking time for cake needs to be closely monitored or cake will dry out, we shortened the time by about 5 minutes. Also toasting the coconut only takes maybe 10 minutes and it should be stirred about every 3 minutes or so.

I made this cake for the first time for my daughter's teacher, who is a coconut lover. I was a bit concerned after reading some of the reviews, but as an experienced baker I found the recipe to be sound, and gave it a try. The only thing I would add is the suggestion to line the cake pans with rounds of parchment paper for perfect release from the pans. Because of the high butter content of this recipe the cake is very moist, and might stick. Otherwise, I would make absolutely no changes to this recipe. People who love coconut will go crazy over this cake, as it is what you expect in a coconut cake - sweet and heavy. Make this with confidence for someone who loves coconut and you won't be disappointed with the result!!

I made this cake for a party and received wonderful compliments. I read all of the other reviews before I made the cake. If I read the same comment from 2-3 cooks, I tried to incorporate the change into my recipe. Here's what I did differently: I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream in both the filling and the cake. I cut back on the amount of butter called for in the recipe. For the filling, I used 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup. For the frosting, I used 1/4 cup instead of a 1/2 cup. For the cake, I used 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 cups. I only needed 2 cups of coconut for the topping, Most of that fell off the cake anyway, so I can't imagine needing the 4 cups the recipe originally calls for. Lastly, I baked the cake for 25 minutes instead of 35. Like other cooks, I was initially shocked at how flat each layer turned out. After layering them with the filling and frosting, however, the cake looked beautiful and tastes great.

This cake is the heaviest cake ever. I tried carrying it with one hand and ended up sore the next day! The batter is the thickest ever so dont' think you're making a mistake when you are using all your strength to scoop (not pour) the batter into the pans. The cake turns out wonderful. THe cake isn't dry, just heavy. Be sure to let the cake defrost a bit if it's been in the refrigerator. IF it's too cold, it may seem dry. Everything from frosting to filling to cake is scrumptious!

I would have rated this a "4" if my daughter hadn't said a patient had brought in a better one to her office the other day. I just made this for Christmas dinner and every one said it was very good. My dad, the coconut cake lover, said it was good; for me, that is good enought. I don't understand why some users said they needed to add another cup of powdered sugar to the frosting; mine turned out perfect. I did, though, follow the advise of a few who said to cut the coconut in half--there was plenty in/on the cake. Instead of making a three-layer, 9" cake I made a two-layer, 15"x9" cake; it turned out just fine. Thanks for sharing.

This cake both looks delicious and tastes delicious. It's a little time consuming so I made it in three patrs. Day 1 - filling. Day 2 - cakes. Day 3 - frosting & assembly. Everyone who saw this cake was very impressed by the presentation and amazed that it wasn't bought in a gourmet store.

I selected this particular coconut cake recipe because of the rave reviews. Because so many people claimed that the cake was dry, I bought a new thermometer and checked my oven before baking. Imagine my surprise when I found that it was heating the oven to about 40 degrees above the setting! I compensated for this, and the cake came out perfectly, although I can see how could become dry if not watched carefully near the end. The cake was a knockout, I didn't even toast the coconut (going for a white cake), and everyone raved about it. Very rich!

This was a delicious cake. I took it to a going away party for a coconut lover and she packed up the leftovers. I took this as a good sign. I didn't add quite as much coconut and it still turned out fine even though I only refrigerated the filling for 3 hours as I made it in the morning of. Not to continue on, but, the second time I made it for my family, I lightened it up considerably with light butter, half & half, and less butter and it was even more fabulous -less heavy.

Well... the filling was awesome, and so was the frosting, but something went wrong with the cake batter - despite following the directions perfectly.

Cake turned out beautifully even though I baked it in two 13 inch roasting pans. The filling was good enough to eat by the spoonful.

This is a great tasting cake and not all that difficult to make. This was my first attempt at a giant layer cake and it turned out spectacular and tasted great, my wife couldn't believe that I didn't buy it. My suggestion is that you only bake the cakes 30 minutes instead of 35, this way they will be more moist, not that they were bad at 35 minutes but 30 minutes probably would've been better. The cake itself is very dense, which me and my wife like in a cake. The cake needs to be somewhat dense in order to spread the filling that you prepared and chilled overnight. I took the coconut filling out of the refrigerator when I started making the cake batter, this way, by the time you make the batter and bake the cakes it will have softened up enough to make it easier to spread. Don't skip on tosting the cococunt, which you will pat on after spreading the frosting, it makes for a grand looking cake and adds a little bit of nuttiness to the overall flavor. I will make this cake again when another opportunity arises, it's a little time consuming, but what great cake isn't, although it's not that difficult to make.

This is the best cake I have ever fixed, and one of the best I have ever eaten. 2 cups of powdered sugar was not enough for me. I had to use 3 cups to get the frosting firm enough to spread.

Fabulous. Impressive to look at, better to eat! All coconut lovers must try. The filling is tasty enough to eat with a spoon. Favorite dessert at Christmas dinner party for 40.

I made this as a birthday cake for a coconut lover. It was delicious - not too sweet - interesting textures of cream filling, coconut, frosting & cake. Next time, I'm going to substitute milk for cream and reduce the butter in filling & frosting - it seems excessive

Relatively easy to make, delishious to eat. I think next time I might use half cake flour though to make it just a smidge more tender. Definitely impressive looking and it tastes as good as it looks.

This is a very special cake. You do not need to let the custard cool overnight! Just be sure it is chiled prior to using. By the time you make and cool the cake, the custard will be ready. It is party fare.

This cake is definitly dressed for success. Came together rather easy. For coconut lovers it will certainly please most. Did'nt change anything expect, left the top of the cake plain without coconut. A great desert for a special dinner party. Leave at room temp several hours ahead for easier cutting. Enjoy.
