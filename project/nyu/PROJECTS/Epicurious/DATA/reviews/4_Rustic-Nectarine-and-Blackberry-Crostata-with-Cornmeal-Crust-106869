This was fantastic! Easy to make and super delicious! After 30 minutes of cooking the crust cracked in one spot and the juices poured out. I saved a little bit of the dough and just patched it up while it was cooking. The leaking stopped. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe, even though the crust cracked and the juices leaked. It's called a "rustic crostata"...I think it just added to the rustic name.

brought to a lawn picnic and got rave reviews for the crust. Used peaches, plums, cherries and blueberries. Not sure the orange rind added much. Also used the graham cracker crumbs on the bottom as mentioned in the other reviews and it worked well.

This crostata,albeit with peaches and raspberries substituted for nectarines and blackberries,was one of our contributions to a July 4 dinner. Accompanied by a small scoop of vanilla gelato, it was a hit. The crust is very simple to make and delicious. (We used medium, not coarse, cornmal to avoid grittiness in the finished product.) The crostata did leak just a bit on baking, but we were prepared for that with foil to catch the juices, so no worries. We found it took about an hour and ten minutes of baking time - so more than the recipe specified - for this to be done. Did not use the preserve glaze but agree with others that the egg wash and raw sugar step ie essential for the look of the finished product. We will definitely use this recipe again. The nectarine / blackberry version is on the horizon and the possiblities of fillings are many.

Had a bunch of peaches that were ripe & decided to make this recipe. I also used blueberries instead of blackberries. The coarse cornmeal gives the crust & nice taste however, I agree with other reviewers that it was too coarse & bits do get stuck in ur teeth. I am wondering if we should use fine corn meal, may try this next time. Also I did drain off a little of the juice so while baking the crostata it did not run all over my oven. Overall taste was very good.

to help out with any leakage you could put a thin layer of apricot jam on the crust before putting the fruit down. You can also use a thin layer of melted chocolate (white, milk, dark whatever). It will help seal the crust. If using chocolate, wait for it to harden before putting down fruit. I plan on making this tonight for a little date night and I can't wait to taste it!

I made this for our 4th of July BBQ. Having never made a pie crust before, I just hoped for the best, expected the worst...It turned out delicious and beautiful! Followed the tip on using graham cracker crumbs to soak up the juices (thanks for that!). Used peaches and blueberries since that is what I had. With such a rich crust, I think next time I will use fruits that have a more tartness to cut the richness a bit. Loved the texture added by the polenta too!

Very easy and really tasty. I didn't bother with pinching the crust every 2 inches - I just folded it over the filling and made sure that everything was sealed. Everyone loved it!

This recipe made a large and very tasty crostata. It is important to let the fruit stand in the sugar mixture and I found that the crust did not get soggy because of this. Also, it was good to make the crust in a food processor-much easier to work with this way. An excellent dish.

I have made this crostata several times. Everyone always loves it! Pretty presentation--I will make this over and over and over!

I was quite impressed with this tart. I used only nectarines, used the graham cracker suggestion made by others (brilliant!), and served it with a burnt caramel ice cream (recipe also on Epicurious). My favorite part is the crust -- easy to work with, and really delicious. The orange is wonderful, and I like the tooth of the polenta.

This crostata was really, really good. I think the best part was the crust, actually. I did have trouble with juices escaping, too, because I, unfortunately, forgot to put crushed up graham cracker crumbs under the fruit as other reviewers suggested. Truly, this was delicious.

This came together very easily. Since blueberries were on sale and blackberries weren't, nectarine-and-blueberry it was, which worked well. A bit of trouble with juices escaping, but I'm not sure if that's because I didn't make sure the crust was even enough at the Point of Escaping? Everyone liked it, although as they sat there picking polenta out of their teeth afterward, it was generally decided that perhaps a different crust would lead to less dental issues. Though the orange zest in it is AMAZING!

Delicious and easy. Instead of the graham cracker trick mentioned below, I used ground almonds, which worked well. I threw in some blueberries and Rainier cherries as well (waste not, want not) and it was just great.

This beats the heck out of making a pie in a pie pan! I was short of enough butter and used a few tablespoons of butter flavored shortening and it was still great. I could see using alnost any combination of fruit and it makes a great presentation

Everyone loved this! I used blueberries instead of blackberries, and about half peaches/half nectarines. Also reduced butter to 8 Tbs, and used the graham cracker suggestion mentioned earlier. The crust was wonderful.

Made this over the weekend for friends. I particularly like the crust: the crunchiness the polenta adds and the whiff of orange. Nice dessert with minimal effort.

Rating: 4
Really wonderful crust. Seemed wet with 1/3 cup ice water (certainly did not need more) and I was a little afraid it was just going to melt away in the oven given the amount of butter and how soft it was. Turned out very flaky and the orange peel added a nice note. Didn't have enough blackberries so added blueberries as well and increased the amount of cornstarch accordingly. Did spread graham cracker crumbs on crust before adding fruit -- may have helped keep crust from getting soggy. Even people who normally skip crusts finished every crumb of this one...

Great recipe and looks beautiful. I've made it several times, once with blueberries instead of blackberries. I especially love the crust...the cornmeal adds a wonderful texture. I have had troulbe with excess juices from the fruit filling. A friend told me to add a few teaspoons of tapioca to the filling to absorb the juices...I'll try it next time.

As others have commented, I am COMPLETELY crustophobic, particularly since I shy away from cooking with too much butter, but I used SLIGHTLY less (10 tbsp)and it still came out great. I found a good tip to help with fruit leakage in one of Deborah Madison's cookbooks. She recommends putting about 1/2 cup bread or cookie crumbs underneath the fruit to absorb excess juice - graham cracker crumbs worked great. I also baked on a silpat instead of parchment paper and as always it worked like a charm. This recipe was much easier than I thought and very impressive.

Rating: 4
An excellent and versatile recipe. Have made it many times with different combinations of fruit; apples, mangoes, blueberries, raspberries, etc. Have never glazed it with the preserves but don't omit the egg and sugar. The crust is easy, the cormeal crunch perfect, to those who thought the crust soggy...try again.

Fan-F__ing-tastic! I have never had so many compliments for a recipe EVER! Definitly worth the effort.

I made this for my gourmet club and it was a hit. I loved the combo of the blackberried and the nectarine. I could have done without the crust though and used regular old pie crust. It was too heavy and it was kind of a gooey cornbread with fruit on top. The vanilla ice cream was a nice touch though..

Rating: 3
Made this with a combo of peaches, nectarines and plums. Delicious. My recommendation would be to not include the juices from the fruit -- despite cooking the tart on a pizza stone, the crust still got soggy -- and perhaps add a little more cornmeal to the crust. But I'm making it again for a 4th of July party this weekend.

Gorgeous!!! Just made this for a casual dinner party on the patio. Used peaches and raspberries and apricot preserves because I couldn't find peach. Delicious and very easy, and beautiful! I am generally pretty intimidated by crust-making, but this "rustic" tart was a breeze. Definitely do not skip the dusting with raw sugar, it really was the perfect touch. Will definitely make this often, using whatever seasonal fruits are available.

This recipe was great!! I am seriously crust challenged and was scared to make this for a potluck, but took the chance and was the hit of the party. The polenta hides any flaws in the making of the crust, which was great forme. I used peaches since they looked better than the nectarines in the store and it was beautiful and yummy. My husband says it looked like a picture in a food magazine.

Awesome! This is so easy, neat looking and great tasting! We had fresh blackberries, so that is all that I used. My 3 and 5 yr. olds did most of the work and I thought it would be a disaster, but it was so good. I loved the crust. So tender and buttery... it reminds me of shortbread.

I love this recipe and have made it several times with different fillings. My favorite was with straberries and rhubarb, with a strawberry/rhubarb jam glaze. YUM! My guests always gobble it up and some have even given me fruit from their garden hoping I would make it again! Definitely a keeper!

I've made this recipe twice now, with no adjustments other than using a sprinkle of regular sugar on top. It was a big hit both times - looks impressively rustic, and tastes just sweet enough. It is still somewhat delicate, like most pastry, but has a more interesting texture thanks to the cornmeal.

I made this crostata first for my daughter's college graduation and it was a big hit. I added peaches alone and it was terrific. I will definitely make it again. The crust is great; the polenta gives is a depth and bit of crunchiness that is hard to beat.

I have made this recipe several times. Mouths start watering for this one the second I mention that I'm going to make a fruit tart. I have made the crust with and without the cornmeal, with different fruit (raspberries or blackberries with peaches and nectarines-white or regular), and always without the glaze.

Rating: 2
the taste is very good. The most difficult part for me was the crust. Like a previous critic, it was thick and thin with the juices running. The glazing makes it somewhat too sweet but can be corrected by using different preserve. How about less polenta? any thoughts?

HAD A CROWD AT THE HOUSE, EVERYONE LOVED THIS INCLUDING MY FOUR YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER-DEFINITELY WILL MAKE AGAIN.

This recipe wowed a bunch of foodies at a small dinner party. There were lots of possible disasters along the way: crust that was thick on one side, thin on the other; leaky fruit juice; I didn't have special sugar. But in the end, it all worked. I used apricot preserves instead of peach and regular sugar for glazing the crust. I also rolled out the crust between two sheets of floured parchment. Who cares if it was lopsided. It looked like something from an Italian farmhouse.

This recipe is a keeper. The crust is fabulous and the recipe was easy to follow. I made it this weekend for a dinner party and got raves from my company. I will definitely make this one all summer.

I'd make this again, because the filling is actually quite good, but the crust really didn't do anything for me. I may take previous reviews suggestion of puff pastry or some other variation, but I won't be making the crust again.

This recipe turned out great. I was short on time and used puffed pastry. All my nectarines had not riped. I used some Puots and some raspberries left from a fruit salad. The tast and texture were just as great as the first time. This is truly a keeper!

To solve the terrible crust problems, could I put the crust in a pie pan? My crust didn't stand up and the juices all leaked.

Rating: 4
Made this to rave reviews for a dinner party. I did have some leakage. Two caveats; one, resist the temptation to increase the amount of fruit, and two, make sure the rolled out pastry is not stuck to the parchment when refrigerated or you will fiddle too long making the rolled up edge.

A really great recipe that is definitely a cut above the usuals. It was the perfect dessert I was searching for to top off an elegant summer Italian dinner. It is an excellent example of why I love Epicurious.com. I searched, I found, I read the reviews and tips of what to look out for, I made it and it came out great. Thanks Epicurious.com!!!

I agree that you must work fast with the crust because it can become soft quickly. This was an incredibly beautiful and tasty dish that wasn't very hard to make. Served with vanilla frozen yogurt. Excellent!

I made this twice in two weeks. It went so quickly! Very easy... the crust is the only thing a bit difficult, and you just have to time it right. The first time it leaked. The second time I quickly stretched crust over some pin prick size holes and it came out beautifully. I highly recommend this!

I didn't have the ingredients for the corn meal crust so I used ready-made Pilsbury crust. The crust was soggy. I think this was caused by baking on the parchment paper. The flavor was excellent. I will try the recipe again without using the parchment and baking directly on the baking sheet.

I have already made this tart three times since I got this issue of Bon Appetit, and it has always received rave reviews. It is so easy and delicious, even my in-laws who never have seconds on anything, wanted seconds on this dessert, that was a first ever for them! I could not find the polenta, so I used a coarse cornmeal instead. Otherwise, I have followed the directions exactly, this is a wonderful dessert that I'll make over and over!
