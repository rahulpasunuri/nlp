Yup, it was still leaden, and the flavor had not improved after resting all the components together. A wasted effort. And I double checked my baking powder.

This cake barely rose, and my baking powder is not outdated. I was able to slice the very dense and rubbery layers, though they were so thin they tended to break. The filling was good, but barely enough to cover each layer. The frosting did not whip up to a good volume, so it was barely enough to spread over the cake, though it was just enough to act as glue for the coconut, so on the outside it looks pretty. I'm taking it to a pot luck party tonight only because it has so many fairly expensive ingredients, but will warn everyone that it is leaden. The crumbs I tasted were not good, either. Will update this review after I (bravely) taste the complete cake tonight.

I've made this many times. I love it. The cake is dense and rich. I haven't had problems with it being dry. The seven minute frosting takes me back to my mother's favorite cake - which I always thought was too sweet. The sweetness of the frosting is nicely offset by the tart cranberry filling.

This cake is a Christmas tradition. We have dinner with friends every year -- great cooks -- and this finishes a dinner whose centerpiece is beef Wellington (and starts with single-malts). I have made it at least 5 times and it always comes out perfectly ... a wonderful combination of sweet and piquant, and a beautiful presentation with holly leaves & berries around the sides of the cake plate.

I won't make this cake again. It was too cumbersome and the icing tasted like mashmellows.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was delicious! The cake wasn't too dense (don't rush the mixing stage) and the filling was wonderful. Even people who don't like cranberries OR coconut enjoyed it. I only made a couple of modifications -- after reading the reviews saying that the cake layers were too thin to split, I baked it in two 8-inch pans instead of three. That worked out perfectly and made it very easy to split the layers and work with them. Also I didn't have time to make the frosting in the recipe, so I just made a butter frosting flavored with coconut extract.

MADE THIS CAKE FOR FIANCE'S FAMILY AND THEY LOVED IT!! THEY COULD NOT BELIEVE IT WAS THE VERY FIRST CAKE I HAD EVER MADE FROM SCRATCH. THEY FOUGHT ABOUT WHO WOULD GET TO TAKE THE REMAINDER HOME!

The picture in the magazine was so gorgeous I had to make it. What a disappointment! I made the cake part twice -- couldn't believe how dense and dry the cake was, and too thin to slice in half. The frosting didn't whip up the way it was supposed to either. In short, this recipe was terrible, and a huge waste of time and money.

I made this recipe for an Easter dinner party for 9. The layers were easy to make, but each layer was thin, too thin to split. I decided to keep the cake to 3 layers. Many of the people attending the dinner do not like cranberries, so I tried to make the filling using frozen raspberries. For some reason, the filling was too liquid, so I opted to use sliced strawberries on top of frosting between the layers. Again, for some reason unknown to me, the first batch of frosting I made was not sufficient to cover the entire cake. I made a second recipe of frosting and was able to apply it liberally. The finished cake with the coconut was very impressive. I placed the finished cake on a cake pedestal and decorated it with whole strawberries and mint leaves. There were no complaints! Though having to take extra steps to complete it and with still with the substitutions I made along the way, it was relatively easy to make. I would try again sometime just to see if the outcome would improve with practice.

Cake layers were dense but very rich due to high butter content. We had to substitute canned whole cranberry sauce, to which I added vanilla flavoring and triple sec, because we couldn't find fresh or frozen cranberries for valentine's day. The layers split very nicely--cake was enjoyed by everyone.

Made this cake for Christmas. It came out perfect , and got rave reviews. It was a bit richer than antisipated. My advise cut small portions. Cakes came out moist and were easy to slick into layers. The only adjustment was I added more filling from my own homemade cranbery sauce, so double that recipe.

1. Prepared & baked twice, both times layers were .075 to 1.25 inches high(to small to split) 2. Recipe barely 6-7 cups- - too littlle batter for 3-cups per pan!!! 3. When baked layer sliced- - -lots of air bubbles & dense. To short to split. Needed to bake six (6) separate layers to make cake!!!!!!!! 4. What is wrong with this recipe. I rate it as:1-Plastic Fork

Sorry, I can only give this cake one fork. I made it and the cake didn't rise. It came out pretty rubbery. I came up with 3 possiblities: 1) It was too humid today (I live in Hawaii), 2) my baking powder was too old, 3) there was a typo. Although the rest of the recipe was fine, I didn't really care for the frosting either. Even though it was half the height it should have been, it looked pretty cool with the fluffy frosting and coconut -- kind of like those "snowballs" we used to eat as kids!! I'm very curious to know what went wrong. My friends still tried it, although they didn't rave about it as usual.
