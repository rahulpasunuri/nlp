Wonderful base maybe, but I'd rather make it from scratch. This came out tasting like mayo! :P The frmo scratch recipe is a pain to make, but it tastes so much better than this.

I used lemon basil instead of regular basil and served it with citrus-glazed salmon. It was a big hit!

This was very easy to make and tasted delicious. I recommend using a small food processor or a blender if you do not plan to make this ahead. I served this over grouper with mushroom risotto and asparagus! Yum

This is a good recipe for a basic aioli. I used the suggestion for herb substitution and used dried chives (ground in mortar and pestle first). I would reduce the lemon juice to 1/2 tablespoon to decrease acidity (combined with the lemon peel, the original recipe was too tart). This kept in the refrigerator for about 7 days. Great with homemade red potato fries!

this was simple and fantastic. I used it as dip for crab cakes and grilled artichokes. Definitely a keeper, thanks!

I hesitated making this recipe because I'm not a fan of mayo, but it added great flavour to my portebello/ roasted red pepper crustini

Very nice and super easy sauce for seafood. Don't worry about precisely measuring the ingredients - simple add them to taste. Make at least a double-batch...one batch doesn't make very much.

This was so delicious! I used it with crab cakes and also on a beef sandwich.

i made this to accompany the salmon cakes with tarragon-chive dipping sauce (recipe from this site) and since that sauce didn't sound so appealing, i tried this instead with the advice of others. my boyfriend and i loved it! even tho i knew all that mayo was in it, i couldn't help but use a nice dipping amount of it with each bite of the salmon cake. next time, i'll try using a light mayo to make my eating less guilty but this sauce is deeeeeelicious!

Pretty good. Nice with the beef kabobs I made for dinner. I used lemon juice instead of zest. Makes more than we could use up in a few days. Good on our sandwiches the next day.

Very easy recipe. I made it as an accompaniement to the SALMON CAKES WITH TARRAGON-CHIVE DIPPING SAUCE recipe from this site. It sounded better than the Tarragon-Chive Sauce. I should also add that I substituted lime for lemon and it was great. It added a little sweetness to the taste. It was very good. Try it.

I loved this. I have made it three times now. My boyfriend requests it all the time. It would be great on sandwiches too.

Easy starter: Spread this aioli on small bread rounds and top them with a slice of roma tomato and a fresh basil leaf. It's wonderful for a summer party.

as much as i love lemon, i think the sauce was overpowered by the lemon zest. i will try it again but cut the zest by at least half...

This is excellent on any fish...it sure beats the heck out of tartar sauce. It keeps for about a week, if covered and refrigerated.

This sauce is easy and delicious. We love it on fresh grilled sword or ahi.
