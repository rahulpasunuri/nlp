As sandwiches go, I have made better ones from this site. Last night I subbed spinach for the arugula, like I always do. But my problem was with the onions--TOO sweet and sour, and the cheese got lost. Also, maybe O/M deli thin sliced turkey breast was not flavorful enough. Hubby and I did not like these enough to make them again unless I find better meat, add no red wine vinegar, use less mayo, use romaine lettuce for the greens. So, in essence, I would not make these sandwiches again as written.

At the end of the day, it's really just a sandwich, isn't it? Found mayo and blue cheese a bit OTT.

These sandwiches are good but not exceptional-I added more turkey and less onions- flavors are good but would be better with more of everything on ciabatta

I had some blue cheese and arugula in the fridge so when I saw this in the magazine I thought "why not?" We thought the sandwiches were great! I would not have thought of combining these flavors but they work!

I haven't made this, but I appreciate recipes for simple things. Here are combinations I wouldn't have thought og.

Very tasty sandwich! Strong flavors (I felt the blue cheese was dominant), but a good balance overall. I might add tomato next time to soften it a bit.

Loved these flavors together. I know it isn't groundbreaking, but it was really good. Instead of putting more arugula in the sandwich, I made an arugula side salad with a sweet shallot dressing. Will absolutely make this again.

Samwhitch is samwitch....Really. Who doesn't make a sandwich this way? Or at least kinda this way. This is picnic fare all the way! This is easy lunch and/or supper. Does anyone really need a recipe for this??

A good idea, but way too much onion and mayo. The onion overpowers the turkey and everything else. One or two rings per sandwich would be plenty.

This is a new favorit. The only change I made was using mustard instead of mayo since I can't stand the taste of mayo. Someone suggested using a fig spread which I'll try next time.

Wonderful! I just whipped this up at the beach last weekend and it quick and easy! I used the ciabatta bread since I was serving it on the beach and it was a big hit with my man, who is a big meat and potoatos kind of guy. I am making this again when we invite guests back down to the beach!
