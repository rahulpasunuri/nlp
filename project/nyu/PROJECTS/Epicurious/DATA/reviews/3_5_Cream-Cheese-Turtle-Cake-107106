I think I would give 3.5 forks if that was an option, but am rounding up because this was really easy and people loved it. I added sweetened coconut to the nut mixtures on the bottom and top in order to make this approximate German chocolate cake a bit more. I also worried about the cream cheese portion "disappearing" as others had experienced, so I increased the cream cheese to butter ratio (used twice as much cream cheese) and added an egg to make it more cheesecake-like. It came out great - very marbled - and the icing on top makes it look really beautiful and professional. I agree that the caramel got kind of lost in the topping, though it tasted great, but next time I'm going to drizzle half the caramel over the nuts on the bottom before adding the cake batter - I think that will be better. Overall delicious and a real crowd-pleaser.

I used devil's food cake mix, margarine instead of butter, apple sauce instead of oil and reduced the sugar as some other reviewers have suggested. I also boiled a can of sweetened condensed milk for dulce de leche. The cake was sweet, but in a good way.

Rating: 1
I'm surprised this was rated so high by so many. It was WAY to sugary, the cream cheese wasn't detectable flavor-wise, and it came out as a sticky layer on the bottom of the pan. The icing was so overly sweet that it overpowered the dulce de leche, and the cake - well it's just a box mix after all, so that is just what it tastes like. Not worth keeping.

I was disappointed. I guess I expected more of a brownie type cake and more significant addition from the cream cheese part. I used the less sugar as everyone advised and I think it came out as intended. It's more like a Duncan Hines chocolate cake with a thin strip of cream cheese at the bottom and a not-too-exciting topping. Would not recommend, and will definitely not make again.

This cake is wickedly, insanely good! Used devil's food cake mix, and only about 3 cups of powdered sugar in the entire recipe, especially reducing it in the cream cheese filling. I also added an egg to the filling, and used only 3T of butter there. Worked great, filling did not sink or make the cake soggy. I also followed the suggestion of cutting the cooled cake into squares, then drizzling the toppings over them so they ran down the sides. This was perhaps the best way to serve it, beautiful on the plate and giving a satisfying taste of the toppings. I used almost all the chocolate, and boiled a can of sweetened condensed milk for homemade dulce de leche. Excellent!!!

I have made this cake at least 20 times and it has been wonderful every time. I looked at reviews and tried different approaches and think that this works perfectly. 1. Use a triple fudge/ devil's food cake mix 2.do use the cream cheese as recipe state- just make sure you beat it well so that all the butter is incorporated into the cc mix and it won't separate. Sometimes it does sink but even then it forms a great creamy layer on top of the chopped nuts. 3.To save $$- I have made this for groups of 50 to 75 at a time-I use walnuts at the bottom . 4.FINISHING I cut the cake into approx 16 to 24 pieces- usually into1/9ths and then diagonally to make triangles. Slide pieces apart so that we can drizzle the sauce over and let it drip down the sides.But first poke holes with a wooden sppon handle as suggested and drizzle caramel ( the kind in tubs in produce section as suggested also)into holes- sometimes it helps to warm the sauce). Make icing using approx 50% of sugar. Place large pieces of pecans on top and drizzle pour icing on top letting it drip down sides. Finish with some toasted flaked almond- they look great against the dark choc sauce.Sometimes I put these triangles into flattened cup cake liners for presentation. 5. Serve with fresh whipped cream for a dessert NOONE ever ever leaves on their plate. Sorry that was so long- I have experimented and wanted to share- This is a great looking dessert that is SOO easy and always a crowd pleaser.

Rave reviews at a family get together. I too, cut the sugar SIGNIFICANTLY! I think I used 3/4 cups and it was plenty sweet. I also would have used a more fudgey chocolate mix...I didn't love the German chocolate flavor here. Cut the chocolate chips out of the icing altogether but sprinkled some on top of it. I put the nuts ON the icing and not under to make it look more like a turtle cake. ALSO: Don't use ice cream caramel...use caramel apple caramel or melted caramels. The ice cream topping is transparent and syrupy and gross. It didn't even look good. But a real caramel topping would probably be really impressive and GOOD.

The cake and topping were delicious! However, the cream cheese filing came out strangely clear & way too sweet. I would make the cake again without the cream cheese.

I blew the minds of my friends when I made this cake. I had this "secret" recipe that everyone wanted. heehee Baking has been my passion for about 50 years, but this cake definitely "kicked it up a notch." Just Heavenly! Can't wait to wow more people.

I'm the official birthday baker at work and I use my coworkers as guinea pigs for new recipes. To feed all at work I had to triple the recipe. I modified it by substituting coffee for the water and cutting the powdered sugar in the cream cheese mix. I only used about 6 1/2 cups and added vanilla. Following others, I also cut the icing in half (I cut the sugar in that also, only minimally) and only used the caramel as decoration, no where near what the recipe called for. Last I sprinkled coconut over the whole thing. It was very moist, rich and sweet, but if I had used all the sugar I think it would have been intolerable. My coworkers gave it a big thumbs up with a lot of requests to make it again! I will, but only with these modifications!

The first time I made this cake, I had the same problem that some other people encountered where I found the cream cheese filling too sweet and where the cream cheese sank to the bottom. When I made the cake the second time around, I actually came up with a different cream cheese filling where I beat an 8oz pkg of cream cheese with 1 egg, 1/3 cup of sugar, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. This solved my problem with the filling falling to the bottom. This filling was also a lot less sweet than the original recipe. The second thing I did differently was to take the end of a wooden spoon and to then poke some holes inoto the cake. I then poured my homeade toffee sauce on the cake and the sauce would then fill up the holes. Finally, I only made about 1/2 -3/4 of the recipe for the chocolate sauce since I previously had a lot of extra sauce left over. instead of drizzling the chocolate sauce over the cake, I lightly iced the cake with the chocolate sauce and ten put the rest of the pecans and almonds on top of the cake. I found the nuts stuck to the cake better this way and I felt the toffee sauce inside the cake gave it more of a "Turtle" cake feel. I must also admit that as I am addicted to toffee sauce, I also poured a little bit of toffee sauce on top of the nuts as well. You might not want to do this if you don't like oyur cakes too sweet.

This is one of those recipes that you have to make and decide for yourself. It is very sweet, I left out 1 cup powdered sugar in cream cheese part as per instructions but I have to agree with other reviewers, it is supposed to be sweet. It came out perfectly and everyone loved it. It is not fancy, it is what it is, a very sweet chocolate cake that tastes delicious with vanilla icecream. I also only made half of the chocolate topping and it was more than adequate, I would imagine the whole amount would be a little too sweet for me.

I can't believe that this recipe only has a 69% rating, it's so good!! I do not use all of the chocolate topping that it calls for, I use about 1/2, otherwise it is too sweet. Also, be sure not to overmix the cream cheese into the cake or else it falls to the bottom. I have made this 3 times and everyone loves it.

This cake was way too sugary sweet. I couldn't even taste the toasted nuts, chocolate and caramel because of the overly sweet cream cheese mixture. This recipe is a waste of time and money.

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday. It was sweet, gooey, and delicious. We all loved it. My boyfriend's dad said it was the best chocolate cake he'd ever had. The only thing I would change next time would be to use a homemade caramel sauce and not the overly sweet sauce from the grocery store.

This cake is *very* sweet, but tasted wonderful. Hello... the cream cheese is *supposed* to sink... look at the photograph!

This was probably the WORST cake I have ever made. It sounded so delicious in the description. The cream cheese sank to the bottom and disappeared somewhere in the sickening sweetness. The texture was mushy and grainy. Don't waste your time or money.

Made this for an office birthday. Everyone wanted the recipe. After reading previous reviews I made the following changes in the cake recipe. Did not change the icing recipe. Applesauce instead of oil, egg beaters, 1/4 cup butter, 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar, Newfchatel cream cheese, chololate fudge cake mix, and all pecans. The cake was moist and not sweet. The icing is sweet enough, but not too sweet for the revised cake.

We gobbled this up, even though I substituted applesauce for oil, neufchatel for cream cheese, used half the butter and sugar, and half the frosting. (I also used all pecans, no almonds, and chocolate fudge cake mix for a closer turtle flavor.) No trouble getting this out of the pan!

The cake was beautiful, but sickeningly sweet. I would add NO sugar to the cream cheese mixture to contrast the sweet cake and chocolate. That may do the trick

This is a very rich, moist cake that any chocolate/nut lover will enjoy. I baked it in 4 loaf pans for a bake sale and they were the first off the table. Sure, the cream cheese part falls to the bottom but it kinda carmelizes, and I think, adds to the dessert. I've passed this recipe on to friends and filed it as one of my favourites.

I made this cake for Christmas everyone loved it.I will make it it again i added coffee instead of the water great taste to the cake.

I made this for a family holiday party and got rave reviews. I enjoyed it as well, but I think next time I would reduce the amount of sugar in the cream cheese filling just a bit. It keeps very well too- I brought the leftovers to work two days later and it apparently still tasted just as good- it disappeared in minutes!

Rating: 1
Out of the 2 dozen or so Bon Appetit recipes I've made, this is the first that I would absolutely advise that you not waste your time on. The cream cheese mixture takes like pure sugar in the cake (and yes, it sinks to the bottom) and the cake is just soggy (because of the oil?). It was so overly sweet that I went back to review the recipe to make sure I hadn't put in too much sugar, but I hadn't! Nobody could finish their slice, and I tossed out the rest.

I took this to work for a potluck and everyone raved about it--people came out of the woodwork to try it and many keep asking when I am going to make it again. It weighs about 10 pounds, and for anyone on weight watchers, it is about 20 points per serving, but it is definitely worth it!

I went into making this cake expecting a so-so outcome (but had to try it because the picture looked good), but was pleasantly surprised that the end result wasn't bad at all. A few revisions made to save on calories and fat: used only 1/4 cup oil for the cake, which did not effect the moistness of the cake. I also used only 1/4 c. butter and 1-3/4 c. powdered sugar for the cream cheese mixture since previous reviewers complained of the cake being too sweet. Baked for only 44 minutes. I would suggest halving the icing, since it makes way too much. My husband and son didn't want to wait 2 hours (as recommended in the recipe), so we dove right in and served it with vanilla icecream. The guys thought it was 3 forks worthy. Like I said, I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome, considering the previous reviews. I think decreasing the powdered sugar in the cream cheese mixture made a difference. Didn't have the problem with the bottom of the cake being to soggy either. Good for a work potluck or informal gathering. Real simple to make. And even though it's from a cake mix box, I'm sure that I will make it again.

i mjade this recipe to great reviews awhile ago. the only adjustment i made was substituting part of the required water with some strong coffee to kind of temper the sugar. maybe next time i will add some coconut. sure, this isn't the fanciest of dishes but if you need something to put together for an informal potluck or bake sale. This is definitely the dish to try. presentation and taste wise you and your guests won't be disappointed. oh, it is definitely better the next day.

I actually haven't made this recipe but I have one very much like it that everyone raves over. It is called Earthquake cake. You spread coconut and chopped pecans on the bottom of the pan, pour the prepared german choc. cake mix on top and then cream 1- 8 oz. pkg. cream cheese, 1 stick butter or marg. and 3 1/2 cups powdered sugar. You drop by spoonfuls onto the cake and then kind of push it down. Bake it for 40-45 minutes at 350 degrees. The Cream cheese mixture stays in the middle of the cake. It is delicious. I may try this turtle cake sometime too. They sound very similar.
