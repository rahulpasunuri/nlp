Have made this time and time again. Always a hit and couldn't be easier.

I didn't have apple juice, so I watered down some apple sauce and used that instead. It was so delicious, I can't wait to make it again.

A lovely light, but very sweet dessert. I used Calvados for the stuffing and decreased the amount of apple juice as I anticipated the pears would release juice as they roasted (which they did). A good choice after a heavy meal but would omit the added sugar.

I just made this last weekend. While we ate the main course I put these in the oven and they were ready to eat for dessert. I substituted almonds for the hazelnuts and Grand Marnier for the Frangelico. Use what you have. This is simply fabulous!!! Serve with fresh whipped cream or squirt some Redi Whip into dish. Your guest will love it!

This is elegant and the taste is wonderful! This dish will impress both the eyes and the taste buds. Easy to make and ingredients are few. Vanilla ice cream is a must. I just made it a week ago and plan to make it as the dessert for Thanksgiving.

Perfect ending to a meal! Try using a grade B pure syrup,the maple flavor is even more intense.This is going to be one of our favorites!!

A snap to assemble, gorgeous presentation, and absolutely delicious -- what more could you want from a dessert? This is one recipe for the permanent collection. Try it with pecans and amaretto sometime; also superb!

Every time I ask my husband what I should make for dessert when we have guests over, he always says the PEAR recipe! This is a wonderful recipe and a great treat, especially during the fall and winter months. Don't skimp on the ice cream -- get all natural. If you make the recipe outside of the optimal season for pears, you will have to cook a bit longer as pre-season pears tend to be a little harder than normal.

This is the perfect dessert to serve to guests -- it's very easy to prepare and can be done ahead of time and then baked while you're eating dinner. My guests and I really enjoyed it -- people who don't normally eat dessert were going back for seconds! Next time I would bake it a bit longer than the recipe calls for -- the pears could have been a bit softer.

This is one of the most fantastic desserts I've ever made. Preparation was a snap. I used firm Bosc pears and had to cook for 5 minutes longer than specified to get the pears tender enough. I served with a scoop of Blue Bell Natural Vanilla Bean ice cream. My guests ate EVERY bite and RAVED!!

Great flavor and texture. It didn't look like the picture but was still wonderful. Our guests loved it. I used less of the maple syrup then called for thinking it might be too sweet.

I have made this dish three times already. It's a wonderful dessert especially after a rich or heavy meal. I made it with pecans and served a scoop of dulce de leche ice cream with it, my guests loved it.

This is a quick & elegant dish. I enjoyed it and so did others - I used foil to cover the dish for 1/2 half the cooking time to keep the fruit moist and retain the juices, plus I increased the liquids slightly. A nice autumn desert & very easy. It took a little longer to bake then the time indicated in the recipe.
