My family and friends love this recipe. My only modifications were the following: Four green onions and no shallots. Process everything BUT the shrimp. Cut the shrimp into thirds, after cooking, then add to processed ingredients. Pulse 2-4 times, just to mix. You want to have recognizable chunks of shrimp. This is definately better if made the day before and chilled. Serve with Melba toast or thin slices of bread.

I actually rate it a 3.5--I don't know why it doesn't score higher with other reviewers. It's one of my regular party appetizers. It uses fresh ingredients, is super-simple to make, can be prepared in advance, and tastes great with crackers or crudites. True, it's not spicy--but not everything needs to go for the burn.

I don't think I'll make this one again. I made it for my husband who has always loved the campbell's soup shrimp dip. I thought this would be a classier version. But the onion taste was too strong, the texture was oddly grainy even after a long time in the food processor and I had to add much more tabasco, worcestershire and some lemon juice to give it enough zip. Not really worth the effort in my opinion.

Tried recipe today for family bbq and it was a hit eventhough did not add any tarragon. Doubled the worcestershire and hot sauce measure.

You know, I was just really SO SO on this dip. The taste was ok, but I was not wild about the texture. Too chunky and not creamy enough. As written, the flavor was a little bland, so I added extra hot sauce and some lemon juice, which helped. Was hoping to find a nice alternatice to shrimp cocktail for an appetizer, but unfortunately this recipe just didn't make it in my book.

Liked as in the recipe and also with less mayo/sour cream. Has a different consistency, but it's healthier...

I was looking to use some leftover shrimp. I did not have sour cream on hand, so I used FAGE total yogurt instead. My shrimp had been previously cooked in Old Bay Seasoning, so I decided to skip the tarragon. It turned out quite good. I look forward to trying it again with the tarragon.

Everyone always asks me to make this for their parties. I always use at least 1.5 pounds of shrimp, and often make a double recipe using 3 pounds. I serve it with those Ritz dipping crackers! Delicious!

I used leftover grilled shrimp. Wow this is an awesome way to use the few extra shrimp you made on Friday for a Sunday afternoon snack by the pool!

No color or taste. Added more hot sauce, tarragon, and 1/2 jar minced red jalapenos - still white and bland. No one even knew there was shrimp in it. Looked mayonnaise-y, so many guests passed it by. A loser.

I make this for every party or special occasion, because I can make it ahead and it is simple. My four year old even loves it.

Love this dip--easy and so good. It really does need to sit a couple hours to have flavors blend, though.

I made this for guests and it was just fine, but next time I will cut down on the tarragon, mayo and sour cream a little. Also, more worcestershire. This is so easy to make.

How can you go wrong with mayo and sour cream? Next time, I'll substitute low fat mayo and sour cream and hope it's almost as tasty. I served it with plain pita chips.

I too thought this was a great basic recipe. I added a little more hot sauce (New Orleans, you know)and a little lemon. I also added a little more than a pound of shrimp because it seemed a little "wet" until I did. My neighbor already called me for the recipe. I will definitely save this recipe.

Made this for an impromptu New Year's Eve gathering & it was easy & delicious. I used canned shrimp & dried tarragon & it came out great. I'd like to experiment by using crème frâiche (in place of the sour cream) next time & of course, fresh tarragon.

I made this dip for "Burn the Book Club" and everyone loved it. Don't skimp on the tarragon, it adds a real depth and freshness. Unfortunately I was out of worcestershire sauce so that is the only change I had to make. Another recipe to add to my recipe box!

Good recipe to start with, GREAT recipe with a minimum of tweaking. I doubled the shallots and the green onions, as well as the Worcestershire. Kept the hot sauce the same, and it was wonderful. I'd give it 5 forks for ease of preparation and the raves of my guests. Served with club crackers, but celery sticks would have worked well also. A definite keeper.

Overall this was a nice reciped, although I found it a bit bland. Adding a bit more hot sauce and some pepper flakes seemed to do the trick. Next time I make it, I would use less mayo and sour cream and not chop the shrimp as much.

TOO MUCH TARRAGON! I would half the amount AT LEAST. don't overwhelm the recipe by adding the suggested amount.

I loved it and EVERYONE loved it!!! Had to pass along the recipe since everyone was so interested!! Very good!

We found this recipe to be very fresh tasting and light also. Have served it at different times with potato chips, cucumber slices and toasted baguette slices. We love the taste of fresh herbs.

It was good for something quick and simple to throw together. I used the small cocktail shrimp as another reviewer and it really simplified things. A little soups for dipping but good flavor.

I didn't care for this at all, however my husband said it wasn't too bad, hence one fork. But, most of it went down the garburator - what a waste! Too much tarragon - the strong flavour overwhelmed the subtle taste of the shrimp. The colour was unappetizing as was the mushy texture. If I am going to splurge on fat calories, the flavour/taste has to make it worthwhile! Otherwise, what is the point? There are much better recipes for shrimp dip out there -don't waste your time, effort and money on this one. I would NEVER make this again!!!

I really liked this dip, and so did my guests. It was just as good with chips as with vegetables and was interesting to taste but also subtle. I served it as an appetizer along with some Artichoke and Brie Crostini, and the combination was great. We also had some leftovers later with cooked artichokes, and that was very good as well.

If you're processing the shrimp anyway, use smaller (and cheaper) ones. Or be really lazy, like me, and use thawed frozen bay shrimp (called salad shrimp at some grocery stores) and avoid the deveining.

This dip is very easy and tasty. Try to let it set in the fridge for a couple of hours before you dig in. I too think it tastes best with potato chips.
