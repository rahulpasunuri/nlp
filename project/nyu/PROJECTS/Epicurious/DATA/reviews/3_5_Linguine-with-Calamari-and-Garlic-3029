What are "rolled anchovies with capers"? -- I couldn't find so just used plain old canned anchovies and their oil. I did cook the calamari very briefly and then removed from the skillet while I finished the sauce: absolutely key to tender (not rubbery) calamari. I followed the recipe exactly and I thought this was good but not exceptional; maybe next time I will try doubling the amount of sauce as suggested by another reviewer.

We used arugula instead of basil, added green olives, juice of a lemon, grated pecarino ramano and whole wheat pasta. Otherwise stuck to the recipe and thought it was fab. Enjoy!

We had fresh caught Rhode Island squid. The recipe as is was very flavorful. I removed the squid after 1 minute to not overcook as suggested by other reviewers. Excellent and easy!

Served this dish for lunch this afternoon. My husband thought it was the best meal out of all of our dishes throughout the holiday season! It´s quick and reminds me of our vacations in Italy. Few ingredigents required and I added fresh tomatoes to enhance more flavors.

Haven't rated this yet, but I make calamari a lot and I agree with one of the reviewers that you have to take out the calamari after about a minute. Finish the sauce and add the calamari when you are tossing the sauce for plating. Otherwise you will get rubber rings and the dish will be ruined. I'll make this tonight and review the results.

This was fantastic! Seriously good flavor, well-balanced and wonderful. Don't skimp on the red pepper flakes, garlic, or anchovies. The anchovies make a delicious anchor for the sauce, deepens the seafood flavor without being at all fishy. I doubled the recipe and upped the garlic a bit, added some minced ginger and the juice of a lemon, but otherwise followed this pretty closely. Oh, I did pull the calamari out of the pan before I added the wine and let it reduce. This prevented overcooking the seafood. After the sauce had reduced, I added the pasta, tossed it to coat, then dropped the calamari in at the end, with the basil. Shredded some parmesan and topped with ground pepper. Without a doubt, this goes into my bag of tricks. It went great with a pino grigio and a mixed green salad, loaf of french bread. Kick-ass meal.

I can't believe the other reviews. Aside from the heat from the red peppers, I thought it was tasteless and a waste of good calamari.

My fiance gave this four forks, but it wasn't quite there for me. The sauce was very tasty and the recipe was super quick, and it made this beginner cook look great! A few notes: I used the TJ's frozen calamari too. It thawed in about 2 minutes under cold running water. I also used the TJ's frozen garlic and basil cubes. I think a bit more basil would've been better. After reading the prior reviews, I added extra garlic and red pepper. I used a dry sauvignon blanc (and finished the bottle with dinner). After I added the wine, the sauce took a long time to come to a boil, so I scooped the calamari out and let it sit while the sauce thickened. I think this sauce would be much better with scallops (though I'm not a huge calamari fan, so I'm biased).

So simple and so tasty! I doubled the recipe, but you need a very large skillet for that. I've also made it with shrimp when i can't find calamari and it's just as good .

We tried this recipe tonight as we really like calamari. We followed the recipe to the letter. It was very tasty, and the flavours blended in a very apetizing way. We normally have calamari as an apetizer, and we use a cajun spice to coat it and cook in olive oil for just a few minutes, the calamari is always tender. This subject recipe turned the calamari into rubbery but tasty seafood. We feel squid is akin to scallops, they need VERY little cooking to keep them extremely tender. As stated we enjoyed this recipe, but unless we can get any suggestions as to how we keep the calamari from becoming tough, we will not make it again.

Excellent! I skipped the anchovies, halved the pepper flakes, doubled the garlic, doubled the calamari and added some spring onions, one red pepper, two fresh tomatoes and some italian parsley. I made it twice already and everybody LOVED it!

This dish was incredibly tasty, and so easy!! I just used regular anchovies and added capers (rinsed). Didn't have any wine so used chicken broth with a tiny squeeze of lemon at the end. I think next time I will sweat the garlic a tiny bit in the oil first before continuing with the recipe, but it was delicious as is. My daughter doesn't like spicy food but she loved this, altho hubby and I added more hot pepper flakes at the table. What can I say, easy prep, easy cook, easy cleanup = perfect dinner!

This recipe was so simple to make, yet my guests raved about how gourmet the dish appeared and more so tasted. They believed it took all day! I'm thrilled to have found this recipe, this will be in my regular rotation. This makes the Inexperienced cooks blend in with the best! I took the advice of others and added more anchovies, garlic and crushed red peppers. Thank you!

Even with all the rave reviews, this dish still exceeded my expectations, and with Trader Joes frozed calamari or mixed seafood, it's incredibly simple to prepare. Thanks to all who advised extra red pepper and garlic.

SO easy, took 15 minutes, and good. Plus, the ingredients are typically on hand for me. I made some substitutions--used a tin of anchovies and 2 tbsp of capers and added a can of whole tomatoes, tomatoes (mushed a bit) first, then the juice, right at the end. Also Used TJ's frozen calamari (not breaded) rings. Delicious--perfect weeknight meal.

Thanks everyone for your additions to this recipe. I'd like to add just a few more. Sliced mushrooms and the juice of a can of chopped clams and just 1 minute before it comes off the flame add some sliced green onions and the clams. YUMMY

YUMMY, Fast and Easy! This was MUCH tastier than I expected and the sauce was ready by the time the pasta was cooked :-) I used 7 anchovy spirals and also doubled the chilis. This will be a worknight regular in our home.

I followed the suggestions for more red pepper flakes and more anchovies. Also thought it cried out for chopped parsley, if only to keep the dish from looking so pallid. Very tasty. Perhaps those who thought it bland followed the recipe's direction that this was to go with 8 oz of linguine. That's way too much pasta for 2 people. I made it with 4 oz and the proportion of sauce to pasta was just right.

After tasting this recipe, my boyfriend Eric cried out for MORE! MORE! hot pepper flakes. (Though he mentioned that it might just be the prozac making him yearn for spicier dishes.)

I often order calamari out, but have never ventured to make it myself at home. This recipe turned out to be a great basic one for a first timer. Quick and easy (especially since my grocer sold the calamari prepped). I only had capers and no anchovies, but it still turned out to be scrumptious and my partner agreed, although I am sure the anchovies would add a new dimension. Add some grated pecorino romano and warm italian bread and a star is born.

This dish was fabulous. I doubled the recipe and my husband and I ate the entire meal. I would not normally choose anchovies (unless on a Ceasar), squid or capers, but they are my husband's favorites, so I gave it a try. Suprisingly, I thought the recipe could have used more anchovies. I will definitely make this again. Very easy prep.

This dish looked very unimpressive while I was cooking it, but tasted very good. I am not a big fan of anchovies (except in Caesar salads) but love the flavor they & the capers added to this dish. I would have liked it a bit spicier. I liked it despite using previously frozen calamari rings, which lacked some texture (and couldn't be easily broiled as some reviewers suggested since there were some very small pieces). [Note to anyone who uses frozen calamari- after defrosting, pat them dry well or you will end up with a lot of water in your saute pan!] I also added grated parmesan to finish, which was very good. All in all, an easy and very tasty recipe.

A lovely, simple recipe: inexpensive, easy and quick to make. I make it whenever my local store has calamari available, which is inexpensive and makes for a much more interesting dish than linguine and clams made from canned clams. Very flavorful, even when made with dried basil. I'm a wimp, so I leave out the crushed pepper, but I've used it before and it adds an enjoyable kick if you like that kind of thing. :-) Don't be squeamish about the anchovies if you think you're not an anchovy eater! They add an immense amount of flavor without being overbearing. I use imported anchovies in a glass jar--not that much more expensive and better quality and flavor, I believe, though no capers. Also easier to store remaining anchovies. Highly recommended! I would also recommend NOT adding tomatoes--this is not that kind of dish. Enjoy the simple flavor from the sea with the wine, garlic, basil and anchovies for fullness of flavor.

This was a good, quick, weeknight dish, with some frozen calamari. Very similar to linguine with clams. After tasting, I added a few more anchovies and cooked them down. I used much less pepper and still a bit too spicy for my family.

Calamari needs a livelier sauce. Crushed tomatoes perked it up. Too dull as it is. Or add shrimp and scallops.

yummy yum yum....good for my tum....I also made it with shrimp & scallop combo that was just as nice, however, upped the anchovy content to compensate kick it up a bit. Very nice too & quick - happy to serve it to company, even hubby and make it.

that's fantastic! you rated a recipe that you didn't even use. no peppers, no capers, no artichokes, no squid! a recipe for linguine with calamari and garlic is supposed to have squid. but i am glad that you wrote this review. i'll be laughing 'til tomorrow. cubed froze turkey! classic

To the cook from Wilmington, De: if squid disgusts you, why wou you even look at this recipe? Even more, why write a review when you didn't even make what was written? Don't skew the numbers for those of us who like squid!

This tasted more German than Italian, very bad. I omitted the red pepper and garlic. The idea of eating Squid disgusts me so I replaced it with cubed defrosted boneless skinless white-meat turkey. The anchovies, wine, and capers were too pungent and skanky. The pasta was burned, yet soggy. Ick!

We were very disappointed in this dish. The anchovies made the sauce dirty-looking, and the overall flavor was somewhat lifeless. Unusual for us, we didn't save the leftovers.

Simply delicious. Thought the basil would be a little weird, but it wasn't at all. I also broiled the squid, but only for 6 minutes.

This is a great pasta dish. I took Cindi's advice and marinated and broiled the calamari. The calamari was delicious and well worth the extra effort. As other readers suggested, I also added extra garlic and anchovies. Thanks to all who reviewed this recipe and offered their advice.

My husband and I both loved this one. We decided to make it at the last minute and found it to be quick and easy. We used calamari steaks (cut into thin strips) which we had on hand and added a 1/2 lb of shrimp. The shrimp made a great addition. I'm sure we'll be making this one again.

my husband made this recipe -- it was good. i would do what the last cook did next time i make it -- i.e. broil or grill the calamari before adding it to the rest of the dish -- it needed a more distinctive texture. but really a good dish. i think we more than doubled the calamari.

This was a great recipe. I marinated the calamari in lemon juice, olive oil and garlic cloves for a few hours, then I broiled for ten minutes. Added them to the sauce and poured over the linguini. Quick and super.

I've made this for non squid eaters, who enjoyed it. The anchovy oil and basil makes the dish. Don't skimp on either. I use slightly more anchovies and add about a teaspoon of capers as well. My local Asian market has the large squid bodies (about 12" long) and they are the best if you can find them. Very tender and sweet.

Rating: 4
The basic recipe is good because it is difficult to find calimari recipes that can suit a spectrum of tastes. But I did make changes. First, I parboiled the cleaned squid, using body flesh only. This 1) controls the cooking time; 2)gives you eight good ounces of squid; 3) allows you to cut it into very thin strips easily and, 4) reduces the characterist squid flavor, a good idea for those picky eaters. I added the cooked squid when I threw the cooked linguini into the skillet. Instead of a generic dry white wine, I used pale dry sherry. I also used ground red pepper rather than crushed so to make that flavor even throughout thus eliminating hot "spikes." I added a two tablespoons of quality extra virgin olive oil, used a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic, added two more caper/anchovey rolls and like others added grated cheese on top. Now that is one heck of a meal. Throw in a glass of merlot and some garlic bread and everybody's happy.

Thought it tasted more like Thai than Italian, but tasted fine anyway. Very quick to make so you MUST have all ingredients prepped before starting to cook calamari or you will over cook it.

I don't know what the Seattle reviewer did to warrent this recipe "lifeless" but this was an outstanding dish. Don't be shy with the anchovies (even if you don't generally like them)-they do not stand out in this dish at all and add a wonderful flavor. I used 1/2 the linguini so that the reatio of calamari to linguini was more to our liking.

Excellent dish - my boyfriend absolutely loved it. I did add extra garlic, hot pepper, and anchovies as the readers suggested and it came out beautifully. The only thing I substituted was black squid ink linguine for basic linguine, which if you can find it I would highly recommend it.

This recipe is marvelous!! This one will go into the family cookbook. Definetely use more anchoves and more garlic, but carefully watch the red pepper for too much hot spice.

What an impressive dinner that can be made after work. My husband and I really enjoyed this even though my husband insists he doesn't like anchovies. The recipe is great the way it is,no need to make any changes!

I read the previous reviews and made the following changes to the recipe. I guarantee there will be no leftovers and no one would dare throw any of this dish away. I used six anchovies with capers and 6 cloves of garlic. I also used 1 1/2 teaspoons of red pepper as well as 3/4 of a pound of squid, including the tenacles. I also added the tomato as Galli suggested. It is critical to not over cook the squid and to make sure the pasta is served al dente. A 1996 bottle of Rocca Guicciarda Chianti Classico Riserva , bread sticks and mesclun salad with oil and citrus dressing made this a dinner to return to for special occasions.
