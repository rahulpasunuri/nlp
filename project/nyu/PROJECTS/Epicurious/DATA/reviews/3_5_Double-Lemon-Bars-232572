simple recipe & delicious. i love the crust, but i don't think the bars were as lemony as other recipes i've tried. i will give it another shot, maybe using more lemon juice than called for.

These are fabulous! Very lemony and I love the shortbread crust. Since I my husband doesn't really care for lemon bars, I decided to try freezing half of them. I wasn't sure they'd freeze well - but, I just took them out of the freezer yesterday and they are still firm and delicious!! Matter of fact, I'm going to have another right now.

I LOVE this recipe. The crust turns out more like shortbread, and the lemon pulp in the filling really adds a kick of flavor. I use my hands to knead the dough of the shortbread (the traditional Scottish way, I guess) and I use a spoon to scoop out as much pulp from the lemons as possible (like the epicurious tip recommends -- it really does help). For one batch, I typically use 3-4 lemons. Whenever I take them into work, they're gone in 90 minutes or less!

this is one of the worst recipes i have ever made. the crust was burnt by the time the bars were completely finished baking and the filling was an eggy disaster. i will never make these again.

You will never have to look for another lemon bar recipe again. With simple directions, these treats come out delectable (and addicting I might add). I have made these so many times since discovering this recipe. I prefer meyer lemons, but other lemons work as well. If you're looking for extra lemon flavor, add some lemon peel to the crust as well as a bit extra lemon juice in the top filling. Depending on the over, it may take a shorter or longer than recommended time to cook. Just watch it and when it looks golden brown on top it's done! I will probably use this recipe for the rest of my life!

I used Oranges instead of Lemon, delicious. With Oranges though it is better to use less than 2 cups of sugar.

This has become a new family staple - - I am getting requests for birthdays and other major celebrations. Two caveats: for anyone buying lemons, I am able to get 7 tbsp. juice from two medium-size lemons and 1/4 cup zest from three. I have also tried using cornstarch instead of 1/4 cup flour in the filling, as I find it interferes less with flavors.

These are absolutely delicious. A crisp crust with a custardy filling...YUM! Very easy to make!

I baked this today using the shortbread base (Gourmet March 1999). I ran out of white sugar, so used 1 cup white and 1 cup light brown and it turned out fine. Easy to make and quite delicious.

I made this recipe for some friends last weekend and everybody loved them. I followed the suggestion to freeze the bars for 5 min and then used a pizza cutter to cut them, and it worked out great. Will make it again for sure.

Very good. I also found I needed to cook longer in bothe cases. I did have a problem getting the middles solid without the edge of the foling buring too much. Still delicious though.

I found this recipe in Bon Appetit magazine while on vacation and decided to make it because it had so few ingredients. They were amazing!! I left the magazine but Thank goodness I found it here! I have made it many times since then and it always gets rave reviews! The zest is the key!

I give this recipe 4 forks for flavor but only 3 for ease of preparation. This was my first time making lemon bars from scratch and I found them really hard to cut. Very messy!! I make have overcooked the crust and that is why it was so crumbly. The taste of the crust, however, is outstanding. Buttery and melts in your mouth. The filling was also very good, lemony and rich. I took these to a bbq and everyone loved them. I look forward to making this again and getting better at the crust.

Not that great...these bars were not as lemony or as flavorful as I would have hoped. The bars came out a bit too egg-y. I might use 1 less egg, leave out the lemon zest, and add more lemon juice.

Great recipe. I also doubled the lemon filling and it got rave reviews. I will be making this again for sure!

Oh. my. goodness. These are definitely the best lemon bars EVER. My mother gave me a bunch of meyer lemons from her tree, and I jumped at the opportunity to make these. I used a glass pyrex pan instead, so I had to cook the crust and the lemon mixture a little longer than indicated (about 24 minutes). The center bars are still a bit sticky/gooey, so next time I might increase the second baking time a few more minutes. Having a metal pan may solve this issue, I don't know. And the suggestion to chill the pan before slicing was very helpful! But gooey or not, these are YUMMY.

These are great lemony bars and a family favorite. The best way to cut them neatly is to freeze them just a little before cutting.

This is the easiest and best recipe for lemon bars that I have ever tried. The crust came out flaky and tender, but was still easy to cut into perfect little bars. Nice, tart lemony flavor, too. Thank you, Doris!

Easy and tasty. Make sure you read the recipe through first as I didn't (I just followed each instruction without reading ahead) and put all the flour in the crust. I also didn't read the helpful tip for the lemons until I already juiced my lemons. It still came out ok!

This was a quick and delicious recipe! Nice and lemony. I did find the filling a wee bit grainy, perhaps next time I will try it with icing sugar. I made them for a work potluck and they went like wildfire!

Great recipie, with a few minor adjustments. We have a zillion lemons on our tree, but we easily tire of the sour taste and its heating effect. So, I made this lovely recipe into Lemon-Lime Bars with fresh lemon and lime juices and zests. It was delicious. I also added a bit more sweetness, taking the note from previous comments that it was a bit too strong. Yum, yum.

I prefer Lemon Curd Bars from the Joy of Cooking (newer edition) to these, though this recipe has good flavor too. Our family LOVES lemon bars, so I've tried many recipes. The Joy of Cooking Lemon Curd Bars are very similar to these and also have a shortbread crust, but I think they cook together a little better than this recipe does.

This recipe definately needed a lot more baking time than the recipe called for. The bars were so-so. Alot of effort to put in for a not too good dish.

Like some others, I also found that I needed to bake these longer - both the crust and the filling. Worth making as they're absolutley delicious - definitely keepers!

Excellent, I've made it at many times, but I note a typographic error on the website. There should be only one entry for the butter.

This recipe was alright. I would advise a longer baking time for the last bake. The short bread was fine-but do make sure you pack it firmly! Great for little kids.

These were delicious with some sliced strawberries. I found that the base took almost 30 minutes to bake "to a golden brown. The idea of adding nuts is appealing and I'll try that next time. I thought the filling was terrific, so I'm intrigued to try the filling for the Lemon Shortbread Bars that the other cooks think is even better.

I loved the base of this lemon bar recipe with the addition of 1/2 cup chopped, toasted macadamia nuts. I baked the base at 350 degrees until it was lightly browned, about 20 minutes. I used the filling and streusel topping from the Lemon Shortbread Bar recipe on this site. The things that I changed in that recipe were: I increased the lemon juice to 3/4 cup as well as increasing the lemon peel to 1/4 cup, finely grated. After pouring the lemon filling over the hot crust, I sprinkled 4 tablespoons of macadamia nuts and baked it for 30 minutes at 325. I then proceeded with the lemon shortbread recipe by adding the streusel topping. I got rave reviews and will definitely make this again.

I loved the base of this recipe, but preferred the filling from the Lemon Shortbread bars also on this site. I added 1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts to the base as well as to the topping.

Great lemon flavor! Guests liked it not being "too" sweet. Perhaps I used very large lemons as only two needed for zest and lemon juice. The flavor even better the next day and at room temperature!

Absolutely the best lemon squares and very easy. Can't wait to share with friends.

Somehow the first two ingredients are listed twice (butter and powdered sugar). I assume this is an error. Please reprint the correct recipe.

anyone else found it hard to cut the bars neatly? i already baked mine for an extra 5 mins, but after cooling completely on rack, the filling was still too liquidy to cut through neatly. any ideas?

Super recipe. My Dad loves lemon. The more the better. He loves these squres.

As other cooks noted, typo lists first 2 ingredients twice. Flour amount in ingredients list should read "divided" to avoid confusion, as some of it is for crust and some is for filling. I made this recipe, adding a cup of toasted chopped almonds to the crust, and it was a really nice texture and flavor addition. The next time I make these I'm going to reduce the sugar in the lemon filling by 1/4-1/2 c. as these were a bit too sweet in my opinion. Loved how lemony they were.

should be named "Extreme Lemon." delivers what it promises.

I like the recipe except for the typo of repeating the "1 cup butter, 2/3 cup powdered sugar". Anyways, lemon flavor very pronounced. If you have pure lemon oil around. Add 1/4 tsp of it in the lemon filling. The bars are good enough, with the lemon oil smells even more lemony.

Is there a typo in this recipe? The first 2 ingredients are duplicates.
