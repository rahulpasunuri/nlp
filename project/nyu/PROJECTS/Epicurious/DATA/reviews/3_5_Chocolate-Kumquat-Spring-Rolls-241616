upon reading this forum, i got really quite interested as i learned a lot from all the other postings in here. i pondered whether it is really possible to have this kind of spring roll. I thought that spring rolls are often times with vegetable filling and sometimes with tofu. I consulted my program about that and to my surprise, it was listed there.Good thing that i had that program to make me aware that there are common recipes with a twist.

Who would have thought that an Asian dish that has a touch of liquor :) I have a feeling this will be my favorite because of the chocolate but would lessen the liquor and perhaps add a little amount of orange juice or frozen orange juice concentrate this way if there are no oranges or mandarins available, you could have this substitute.

There is a novelty factor to this recipe but it is also delicious and easy to make. I substituted Triple Sec for Grand Marnier. It makes far fewer chocolate bars than the recipe suggests. As an experiment, I kept some warm in the oven after frying them and they were still delicious. To the chef who said he/she may substitute kiwis....don't do it! If kumquats are not available, you could add orange/mandarin (rind only). The texture will be different but at least you will have the citrus flavor.

Made this for a lunar new year party. My guests liked it but I only thought it was ok. There are better uses for quality chocolate.
