Just do it! I substituted the 1/4 cup of water with an additional 1/4 cup of broth. Also we served it with mashed potatoes and steamed spinach, and a 2003 Bordeaux.

Very Good.. & I placed my filet atop a small bed of mashed potatoes. My Suggestions: 1) If you enjoy sauces.. Double the sauce recipe. 2) Only use ½ the mustard in the beginning , you can always add more later if you like. 3 ) Frying the beef in ½ oil and ½ butter with shallots, adds a lot of favor.

It was a good dish. Very quick and simple. Went with sauteed vegetables, and a garlic mashed potato. Overall I think the sauce was a little strong, but not to the point of taking away from the dish.

I have to agree with some of the reviewers: my husband and I both felt that the sauce overpowered the meat. Oh well, I still adore this website!

I thought this was very good--between two and three forks, but my husband loved it, so I went with three. Yes, it's very easy--the kind of recipe that allows you to prepare side dishes easily simultaneously. I'd definitely make again, and I like it that this dish is low-fat but elegant at the same time.

I've made this dish time and again for my family, and they adore it. The mustard sauce compliments the filet mignon perfectly. And it's so dang easy to prepare. Love it!

Not bad, not the worst version. Made it with garlic broccoli and potatoes. substituted cognac with port - interesting.

I got rave reviews from everyone who tried this! It is fantastic, and easy to make. I served a whole filet, not sliced, and grilled some baby sweet peppers stuffed with pepper jack cheese, and grilled asparagus. The entire meal was delicious, and I will certainly make it again. I used regular dijon mustard, as I didn't have whole grain, and I will do it exactly the same way next time.

This steak is delicious! My boyfriend believes that it is a crime to cook a steak any other way than on the grill but not after this dish! The mustard sauce is the perfect compliment!

Though the recipe was simple to make the mustard sauce was too overpowering for the great piece of beef.

This sauce is to die for! Very simple, yet so delicious - I used this recipe as part of a special birthday dinner and it was a winner - the recipe looks and sounds plain, but oh so yummy! I will definately make this again and maybe even try putting thin slices of filet on slices of toated baguette.

My husband loved this dish, and that is a lot coming from him since he is a picky eater. The sauce was fabulous! Mashed potatoes were great to soak up the sauce. I didn't have cognac or brandy, so I used rum and used 1/2 cup of beef broth instead of the water. This is definitly a keeper!

Simple to make and a very delicious sauce. I added a teaspoon of butter to the sauce as well.

This has immediately become a new favorite! It's very quick and easy, but is also incredibly tasty and beautiful enough to serve for company. I add a little butter to the pan to help get a nice color on the meat. Definitely a keeper!

This is a fantastic dish; so easy to prepare and so tasty. I couldn't believe how well the "tenting" worked to extract juices for the sauce. Very easy to prepare as an impressive meal for company...just add a good Cabernet

Yumm, yumm, yumm, easy, delicous, what more could you want? Made this for Valentine's Day and it was delish! Didn't have cognac so I used brandy instead. Also used creole mustard like previous reviewer, perfect with the filet, definite keeper!

Excellent! I took the advice of another reviewer and made the potatoe galettes (also a great recipe). My husband says it's restaurant quality!

This was excellent and very easy. Two of the best features in any recipe. I used creole mustard for the course grain mustard and it was just the right seasoning. Will definitely make this again.

Fantasic blend of flavors. I served this with the Crisp Potato Galettes and the Green Beans and Red Bell Peppers with Marjoram and Almonds. It rivaled anything we've ever had at "high-priced" restaurants. I served it with a 1996 Chateau Semeillan Mazeau, Listrac-Medoc. Fantastic!

The mustard sauce was to die for. I really enjoyed this dish. I'd recommend people make this.

The sauce has wonderful flavor and was so easy to make. I did not thinly slice the filets and I made extra sauce. I served this to company with the recommended Crisp Potato Galettes, and Green Beans & Red Bell Pepper with Marjoram & Almonds (BA11/98). It was a good menu.
