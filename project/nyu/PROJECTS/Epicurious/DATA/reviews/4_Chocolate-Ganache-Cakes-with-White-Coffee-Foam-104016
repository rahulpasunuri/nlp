The cakes were to die for!! Extra cakes store well in the frig but the chocolate in the center hardens. To refresh the center place the cake(s) in a microwave and zap it for 15/20 seconds. Bring on the sauce!!

The timing on this recipe is very sensitive. It is also very rich for my older guests (cholesterol wise) so I sometimes shorten the butter - and it still works fine. I highly recommend this quick dessert. (I didn't make the coffee foam - I add a small amount of whipped cream (no vanilla or sugar).

I didn't make the coffee foam. Instead I drizzled a raspberry sauce on the plate, put the cake in the middle, put a dollop of clotted cream on top and garnished with a sprig of mint. Very elegant!! My guests were impressed. You've got to be VERY careful not to over bake these cakes. It's a good idea to bake one first and make sure the center is perfectly gooey. If it isn't quite right you can modify you cooking time for the rest of them. Even 1 minute can make a huge difference.
