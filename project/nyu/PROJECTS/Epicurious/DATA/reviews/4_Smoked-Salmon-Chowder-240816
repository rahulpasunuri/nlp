I would say this recipe is only OK as is. If I were to make it again, I would reduce amount of leeks to 2 and maybe thicken it with some mashed potato. I'm guessing this tastes better the next day, when the flavors have had a chance to develop. I agree with a previous reviewer: this chowder might taste odd using lox type salmon, would definitely recommend using fillet smoked salmon.

This recipe made a tasty but not overly rich soup. The tomato paste creates a film of red-pink that overlies the cream-colored soup unless it is stirred. I made plenty of substitutions, to take my review with a grain of salt! I substituted 1/4 cup white onion for one of the leeks, doubled the garlic, used unpeeled cubed fingerling potatoes, and seafood broth instead of vegetable broth. I also used soy milk, and reduced the cream to 1/4 cup. The soup was tasty but not to-die-for. It felt like there was a seasoning missing.

This was delicious and a hit for our guests! I did a few things differently - I used 2 leeks and 1 shallot, 2-3 garlic cloves, and a bit more celery. I also added corn and rosemary when adding the salmon, and to make it healthier we used 2% milk and half & half. Hearty, creamy, and satisfying, it really is a meal in itself and is very easy. When I make this again, I will cook some fennel in with the leeks and only use 2% milk (no cream) unless we are entertaining.

This was a delicious meal in itself for a cold autumn night. In addition to the salmon, I put in some leftover (cooked) crawfish, substituted onions for leeks, and dill for chives. It was excellent.

This is easy and it's delicious! I was a little loose with the ingredients. +1 clove garlic, +2c broth, +~1/2t red pepper flakes, +~1oz sherry. I used whole milk and had a fresh baguette for dipping. Delicious!!

Easy, and relatively quick to make. Smoked salmon may make it 4 forks, but, I used easy canned salmon. I added corn, onions, doubled the garlic, and also garnished with some old bay. Oyster crackers or large, seasoned croutons made the texture nice, too! I will make again, and perhaps try with another variety of seafood?

I didn't see specifications anywhere for what type of smoked salmon to use, but I chose the fillet-type rather than the lox-type and highly suggest that others do the same-- the texture of thin lox in this soup would be really strange.

My favorite recipe on this site so far. This was totally delicious. Like some other reviewers suggested, I did a quick mash and stir of the cooked potato to thicken it just a bit. I also added red pepper like some suggested, but it actually made it too spicy for me, so next time I'm going to leave that out. Still, even slightly too spicy, we ate ever bit of this chowder and LOVED it.

This is a rich and flavorful chowder. The salmon provides an excellent smokiness. I added 2 additional cloves of garlic, a sprig of thyme, and 1/2 a bay leaf. For the liquids I used chicken stock, skim milk, and half-and-half. With the salmon I added a chopped fresh tomato, 1 1/2 tsp of sherry (dry), and a dab of butter. These final steps really enhanced and rounded out the flavors. All in all a very sophisticated and savory dish that takes surprisingly little effort to prepare.

This is a delicious and hearty chowder. I changed no ingredients, but I did alter the method. Cook over med heat, not low. Once potato and celery are added, cook for about 7-10 minutes, stirring frequently. All the veggies saute together in the oil and take on a crispy texture.

Rating: 4
This was excellent especially for a quick and easy weeknight meal. I followed the recipe pretty close except added a can of diced tomatoes (drained) and the corn as others suggested. My husband LOVED it and we have enough for a couple more meals. Great weeknight supper with nice glass of red wine.

Rating: 4
Very quick and easy! I'll definitely make this again. I was looking for a seafood chowder recipe without bacon, and this was perfect since the smoked salmon provided the same smokiness. I used non-fat milk and half-and-half but otherwise followed the recipe. I used three packages of Chicken of the Sea smoked wild Alaska salmon since I didn't want to "waste" my high-end, pricey salmon in a chowder. Worked great. A keeper!

Rating: 4
It was easy and tasty. I blended 3/4 of the base and then added the fish. To lighten it up I used 1% milk and at the end stirred in fat free half and half instead of heavy cream. Instead of salt I used Thai Fish Sauce, which has a more complex flavor.

Rating: 4
Quick. Easy. Tasty. The surprise was the spicy punch straight out of the pot, a zest like you'd find with a good dose of Tabasco in a clam chowder. I wasn't expecting that considering the ingredients. I used two four ounce packets of smoked salmon, one of which was peppered and that might have added the extra kick that proved to be the trick.

Rating: 0
This was delicious the way I tweaked the recipe. I doubled the potatoes, tripled the celery, added some frozen corn kernels and threw in one shredded carrot. I also doubled the amount of garlic, used one can of chicken broth and one can of vegetable broth, used a little more than 12 ounces of smoked salmon because that was the smallest amount I could find and mixed in some dried chives in the last simmering step instead of using it as a garnish. I might add some crushed red pepper to the leftovers to give extra kick because I like spicy. This chowder is a welcome treat on a cold Alaska night.

Rating: 3
I really liked this soup. And the "vomit" post was silly and unfair. I added a decent amount of crushed red pepper to give it some umph as well as a dash of sherry right at the end because this exactly the sort of dish that really benefits from some sherry (like a fruit salad does). Interestingly, I think this soup is better cold than hot. Try it.

I shouldn't really review this recipe because I didn't use the smoked salmon. I used crab instead and it made up into a very nice soup. I skipped the cream and added probably another cup of vegetable broth. Very easy and good flavor.

This chowder is much more delicious when it is reheated the second time. I read all the reviews and made sure I used smoked salmon but my brother thought the s. salmon gave a weird texture to the chowder. I liked it but was not really wowed either as the reviews lead one to believe. I will not be making it again.

Rating: 4
Just made this for the first time.. Was totally awesome, nice smoky flavor, quite salty, which for me is a good thing, it was just how I like it. People who do not love salt will probably want to forgo the 1/2 teaspoon of Kosher salt, even I might cut it back to 1/4 tsp next time. If I could I would take off half a fork and give theis a 3 1/2 due to the slightly overbearing saltiness. However that probably varies a lot with the smoked salmon one uses, so adding the 1/2 tsp might be perfectly appropriate with some. Overall though a delicious and hearty meal for a cool autumn day. Perfect with a warm baguette.

I live in halifax, NS and have made and loved many chowders....this is NOT one of them. Don'y waste your time...a horrible use of good smoked salmon.

Rating: 4
I agree with previous reviewers that smoked salmon is essential. I love canned (non-smoked) salmon as a flavorful alternative to tuna salads and sandwiches, but for this chowder, if it's not smoked, it ends up being quite bland. Smoked salmon is intensely flavorful, probably cuz of the smoking/reducing process -- and it defines this dish. Go all out for the salmon if you make it -- if you have a Trader Joe's near you they have an xlnt one for good price.

I love this chowder and have been making it for a couple of years! The cooking times of "1 minute" and "3 minutes" are a little ridiculously brief; I saute the leeks for at least 10 mins on low, and also the small cubed potatoes when I add them. I've added corn and diced red peppers to this successfully (nicely sauteed beforehand to increase their sweetness and intensity) but the recipe is best as is. I add an 8oz bottle of Bal Harbour clam juice and then add the rest of the broth required -- which has worked beautifully with chicken, turkey and vegetable broths. I use organic whole milk which is lighter than cream but very creamy in the finish.

this was excellent. However I did not use smoked salmon, I had bought an entire salmon and used the fillets for dinner party, the bones (the meat in btw) and head and 1/4 of the filet I put into the boiling broth and I added liquid smoke to it. Added some dill to it too and carrots. It was fantastic

Rating: 4
Fantastic! And I didn't think the color was weird at all. I would definitely make this for company. Our entire family loved it, and the kids are often picky. Only changes I made were the same as most other reviewers - blended it before adding the salmon, and also adding a cup of corn with the salmon. It definitely needed the corn for both flavor and texture, and would have scored only 3 forks without it.

Rating: 3
I agree with a previous reviewer that you should definitely use the best smoked salmon you can find. I used some sub-par salmon and it didn't turn out as good as it could have. I also think that the fat content of the milk you use should depend on how thick you want the soup to be. I used fat-free because it's what we had around the house, but the soup turned out watery because of it - even with the cream. Personally I would use whole milk next time to get that classic chowder consistency. Otherwise this is a very classy, tasty, and unique dish.

Wow - this soup is fantastic. I just finished the leftovers for lunch. SO good. Made it on a work night, and it was very fast, as stated. This is what I did differently b/c of what I had on hand: -subbed yellow onions, 1/2 inch dice (3 c.) for the leeks & minced scallions for the chives -used skim milk & chicken broth -used less than 1/4 c. heavy cream -added about 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper -3-4 cloves of garlic -added 5 jumbo shelled shrimp (i had them in freezer): throw shells in w/ vegetables to increase seafood flavor of broth, cook shrimp til barely pink, remove, chop and add with salmon later. I blended the soup a bit (like others) w/ an immersion blender before adding the salmon & shrimp. The blending thickens the soup nicely and makes all the difference in consistency and chowder look. No need to add any other thickener!!! Like another post says, it doesn't look good until you add the salmon - - but it comes together at the end and is a knock out, and absolutely dinner party worthy in appearance and taste. YUM!!!! I'm adding this one to my recipe box!

Really good; 31/2 forks. I used half clam juice & half veg broth since I had some around and would do this again. I also cut back the cream by about half because I don't like overly creamy soups, and added 1 cup of corn. I took other's advice and blended the soup partially before adding the salmon and corn and liked the result. Tasty, healthy, hearty and quick. I would definitely make this again.

This soup tastes great - I added thyme and red pepper flakes and doubled the amount of garlic. Instead of chicken stock I used 3 c of fish stock (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/fo od/views/Strong-Fish-Stock-105266) and reduced the milk by 1 cup. I didn't know what other reviewers were referring to about the appearance until I added the tomato paste and noted the somewhat off- putting pink pallor of my soup!

Rating: 3
I made the following adjustments: subbed green onions & white onions for the leeks, added some spice with crushed red pepper flakes, as well as a bay leaf, thyme and two ears of fresh corn. The chowder came out well-- it was really flavorful and everyone liked it. Though I enjoyed the taste of the salmon, I'm not sure about the texture-- I actually like the texture of smoked salmon, so I'm ambiguous about cooking it. Next time I may add some of it in "raw", but that detracts from the smoky flavor of the broth...

Very good chowder and simple to make. I only added a couple of tablespoons of cream but it wasn't missed. Like another reviewer, it's not something I'd serve up for company - it's tasty but presentation isn't one of its strong points. If I try this again, some fresh corn might be a good addition.

I made the following mods: 1) Doubled the garlic 2) Doubled the potatoes 3) Doubled the broth 3) Used only about 3/4 cup milk 4) Added couple dashes of cayenne pepper 5) Doubled the tomato paste 6) Added 1.5 tsp of thyme 7) Added 1 can creamed corn plus 1/2 cup fresh corn 8) Used about 12 oz salmon Served with crunch garlic bread. SO GOOD!!

This is an easy, delicious new take on chowder. I have made this several times - the first time exactly as written - but I think that my favorite way involves adding red pepper flakes, extra garlic and fresh corn off of the cob. I pureed part of the soup last time I made this but I think that it would skip that step next time. I think it makes the chowder feel heavy since the ingredients are already rather rich. Personally, I find the presentation a little lackluster so, I wouldn't serve it to guests unless it was a really casual gathering but it's a great weeknight dish.

A little rich for my taste, but perhaps next time I won't add the heavy cream and add in corn as well as someone suggested. Still decadently delicious.

Delicious. Made this last night using 1% milk and half and half instead of the heavy cream in an effort to cut fat content. Blended about half of it before adding the salmon and half and half, also added a couple teaspoons of flour to thicken it up as it simmered. So, so good and very easy!

Ecellent! I followed some of the suggestions below (use a little white wine, pureed about 2/3 of the potato/leek mix before adding the salmon) and it turned out great. Only one thing though: about 10 hours later, my wife and I woke up with severe gas! We had a laughing fit at 5AM because we kept "venting", each time longer and louder than the last.

Followed some recommendations like adding creamed corn and red pepper flakes. Also used a bit more potato and only 2 percent milk to cut the richness for one of my guests. It holds up even without the cream (though I'm sure it would be over the top with it). Before adding the salmon, I pureed some of the soup in the blender and then added it back into the pot to help make the consistency thicker. Lastly the crown jewels: I sauteed kale in olive oil and butter until it first softened and then got crispy, adding some minced garlic during the last 30 seconds. This made a fantastic, crunchy garnish. Serve with some crusty bread and you have a super tasty autumn supper.

A definite staple dish!! I think I'll add some white wine next time I cook this..... Yum!

Good recipe. I took some advice and added creamed corn and crushed red pepper. Then I added 12 oz. chopped scallops (1/4-1/2 in.), 10 pieces of shrimp chopped (1/4-1/2 in.), no chives. Because I added more items, slightly more salt, pepper, cream, milk, broth, and paste was used. So, in the end, one might think it was more of a seafood chowder than just salmon chowder. However, chopping the scallops and shrimp into smaller pieces allows them to "blend" into the "background" of the chowder.

Rating: 4
Lynda used my fish stock made from steamed mussels, added a little chilli for a kicker, and concluded this was the best seafood chowder ever had - very rich but matched any flavour from any restaurant we have eaten at. One restaurant known for its seafood chowder using a crayfish based stock, was overly intense. I didn't think that was possible, as most times restaurant results are under powered or too heavy on the seasoning.

Quick, easy and delicious weeknight supper! It played as well with my year old daughter as it did with my spouse - no easy feat. I had to substitute chicken stock and waxy red potatoes, but I don't think the chowder suffered a bit. I would serve this for company too.

This was good, but per other reviewers recommendations I added red pepper, some fresh corn, and I also made up some rue to just thicken it a little bit. I mashed the veggies a little. It came out quite good!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I should have followed one reviewer's direction and lightly mashed the veggies before adding the salmon, as the soup can feel a little chunkier than I'd like. To combat the bland complaints, I added about 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper for a little spice.

Fantastic chowder! I followed the recipe exactly and used Nova Lox for the salmon. Delicious!

This was very good after we added the corn in. Without the corn, it just needs a little something. However, with the corn, it's very very similar to a recipe that my mother makes that calls for ham instead of salmon, and honestly, I think the ham version is better. This chowder is delicious, but I adore salmon and I think the flavor of the salmon gets drowned in this chowder.

Extremely bland. I added some dill. Still kind of bland.

This was easy, and outstanding. Like another reviewer, I thought the dish just looked like a bunch of chunky vegetables in a watery-milk broth until the addition of salmon and cream at the end. Have no fear though, the end result is very, very tasty, and it looks much better finished. I made the whole recipe for just the two of us and I'll add some corn to the leftovers for dinner later this week. Hot, crusty bread goes well with this.

A good soup for cold winter days. I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I roughly pureed it with a potato masher before adding the salmon. I also took the soup off the flames right after adding salmon, to preserve the lovely texture of the fish. Definitely would make this again with a few adjustments. Someone recommended adding creamed corn and clam juice, which sounds like a good idea.

We loved this recipe. I will definately make it again. I followed the directions closely only adjusting by adding spring onions to the leeks and missed the leeks. A keeper........

I was unimpressed with this recipe until 5 minutes before it came together (i.e. when the cream and salmon are added). It's deceptively simple, and the flavours are rich and hearty. I'd recommend adding half the smoked salmon to the soup as per the recipe's directions, and the rest once the pot is taken off the flames so that the salmon cooks less and retains it's original consistency. Definitely a keeper.

I thought this was really exceptional because of the great flavors and the ease of preparation. Both my husband and I really enjoyed it and I will definitely make it again.

The soup was great. My only complaint is that the delicate texture of the smoked salmon was overpowered by the celery and potato slices/cubes. The taste and aroma of this soup were amazing. It came out just the way it looks in the picture too and it tasted great! To modify this, I might not have stirred the smoked salmon into the soup. Instead, I would have just topped the warm soup with the room temperature (or even better cold) smoked salmon.

This was absolutely delicious! I made a few changes....I didn't have any leeks, so I used 1 bunch of green onions (white and light green parts), and 1/3 sweet white onion, chopped. I increased to 3 garlic cloves and 2 Tbs EVOO. I used 1lb. red potatoes with the skins on, and I used 1/2 n' 1/2 instead of heavy cream. When the broth was added, I also put in a bay leaf. EXCELLENT!!! My husband is a huge fan of smoked salmon, so this was an easy sell! I will definitely make this again!
