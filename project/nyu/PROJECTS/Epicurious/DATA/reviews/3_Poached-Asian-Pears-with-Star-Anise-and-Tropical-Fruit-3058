The pears were yummy, but I'm wondering if I misunderstood the spice quantities. Does "a 2-inch piece of ginger, sliced" mean 2 inches of a ginger stalk that then gets sliced, or a 2-inch slice that then gets julienned? I interpreted it as the former and then found such a gingery syrup that I couldn't use it. (I'm hoping to incorporate it into some other sauce once I think of a good idea.) What with the ginger and star anise, I couldn't taste the cinnamon. I'd like to experiment with adjusting the spice ratio before I serve this recipe to guests.

This was a great way to use asian pears. I ended up using a riesling instead of a dry white wine and it was great. I agree that reducing the liquid is the key!

Recipe was served as a pot luck dessert for a group at work. Everyone raved about it with numberous requests for the recipe and what spices were used to give the pears the unique flavor. I did quarter the pears as they were large and I was not sure how many others may have brought a dessert. I served the pears in the syrup out of a bowl. When making this recipe it is important to heed the directions on reducing the liquid to 3/4 of a cup. Nothing was left over for me to bring home.
