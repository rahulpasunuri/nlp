I made this with butternut squash ravioli and it was perfect. Instead of the pasta water I used a little chicken broth.

To spruce up the sauce I used combo butter and olive oil, and added large clove of minced garlic along with the sage. Served over mushroom ravioli. Very Nice.

This is a simple recipe. The quality of dish will depend on the quality fresh tortellini. We used Herb Chicken Tortellini. I would defintely make this again.

My husband did not care much for this. It is quick and easy, but the taste is just okay, nothing to remember. I won't get out of my way to do this again, but I might if I have some more fresh sage leftovers and I need a quick fix.
