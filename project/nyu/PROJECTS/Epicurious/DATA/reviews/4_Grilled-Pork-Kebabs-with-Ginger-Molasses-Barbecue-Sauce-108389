Very good and easy! I will keep this recipe, as everyone in my household liked it (an accomplishment with my picky eaters!)

Fantastic! I am definitely going to make this again. Made this for a labor day weekend BBQ party for 5 families on our block. So, used a 5 lb pork tenderloin, cut up into 1 inch chunks for kebabs. Multiplied the sauce recipe by about 5 x (except less on the salt, and less on the hot pepper - only had jalapeno on hand) and cooked it down longer as others had recommended. Used half the sauce to marinate the pork cubes overnight. Then made kebabs with the pork, sweet onion, red pepper & pineapple. Used the remaining sauce to baste the kebabs (though still had left over). The meat was SO tender & flavorful and the sauce is just fantastic. I would make the sauce alone just to have on hand for stir fries and other dishes. WOW!

Wow! This one is staying in the recipe box. We had an extra pork tenderloin and not a lot time. We followed other reviewers and cooked the sauce for longer. We will double the sauce next time. This makes a great weekday meal and would also be easy for a party.

Yum! I didn't have molasses so used blueberry honey n brown sugar. Served it cut over salad w extra sauce

I'm definitely going to do this again. I reduced the sauce, like someone else recommended, for about 15 minutes, versus 3 minutes. I also saved some sauce on the side and coated the cooked pork right before serving - awesome!

Delicious & so easy to make. I followed the recipe but doubled the sauce. Next time, I may triple it.

very tasty and easy to make. many people complain that the sauce is too thin, it is not supposed to be a thick sauce. the sauce has tons of flavor and is used to caramelize the pork (good for chicken too). definitely let the sauce cook for 15-30 minutes, not 3. then baste the meat. i then boiled the remaining sauce and let it simmer for a bit and then poured over cooked meat. this was a REAL hit.

Made the sauce as described but went slightly lighter on the serranos. The sauce didn't ever reduce as much as described but after 20 minutes it was good enough. When I tasted the sauce though I panicked as it seemed way to spicy due to the serranos so added additional ketchup, molasses and sugar. I shouldn't have worried though because after 4 hours of marinating, and BBQing on the skewers for 10 minutes, this was the best meat I've ever had. I did make extra to use as a sauce as others suggested, but still felt the sauce was too strong to do that so we ate the meat alone. Very good!

Great Recipe I love the ginger barbecue sauce. I agree that it was a little thin, I think next time I'll make a little more of it so that I can really slather it on the pork. Otherwise the flavor is amazing and the kebab presentation makes it really fun.

This was a good recipe but I was disappointed that the sauce was so thin. After reducing it to 1/2 cup I expected the consistency of a BBQ sauce. The flavor was good but it really didn't coat the meat which would have given the pork more flavor.

I enjoyed the molasses bbq sauce. I used half for basting and saved half for serving. Also, I grilled boneless pork chops instead of messing with the kabobs. I also used this sauce for grilled, boneless chicken.

I make this one with green chilies as called for or with habanero peppers. Love the heat. At the moment this is my top whenever I get pork tenderloin. First time I made it rain started, so I just poured the marinade over sliced pork and broiled in the oven, still came out very well.

Stellar finish. Half of the family doesn't like heat, so it was lucky that I doubled the recipe but used only the one pepper. It had its effect. For those disgruntled with the wooden skewers, invest in some metal ones. That way you'll have more reasons to make kebabs. I love this site, but FoodNetwork has a recipe with separate marinades for chicken, beef, shrimp and veggies that is spectacular. This just rounds it off with the addition of a perfect pork marinade.

I made this for guests and it was an overwhelming success. The only change I made was to eliminate the chile pepper, instead I added some red pepper flakes so I was able to control the amount of heat. These cook quickly on a hot grill, so they need to be watched carefully

I've made this a couple times and love it. Great flavors! To other reviewers who use leftover sauce to drizzle on the meat after cooking: I think the recipe says to throw out the leftover sauce because it will be contaminated with raw pork juices. Make sure to separate out some of the sauce beforehand if you want to do this.

recipe was great, took reviewers advice and added two peppers instead - it was fantastic, my husband keeps asking me to make it for pitas and burrito filling as well.

We used whole pork tenderloins rather than slicing into strips and skewering. Also, I didn't have any fresh chiles, so I substituted dry powdered chipotle and a small amount of cayenne. The tenderloins were juicy, and the flavors were great. The ginger and molasses were well balanced. My sauce seemed the proper thickness after about 12 minutes. I definitely recommend this recipe!

Maybe it was my gas stove but 15 minutes was a very long time to cook down the sauce. I ended up with something really sticky that I had to add water to. The amount of hot pepper was too much for my husband, he liked the dish but could barely eat because of the heat. You could leave out the seeds to tone it down a bit if serving for folks who are heat intolerant.

Rating: 3
This was pretty good...I had a pork loin roast to use and cut it into chunks and skewered them. Also, I added a bit too much fresh jalepeno, as that is what I had on hand. I ended up adding more ketchup and sugar to cut down on the vinegar-y taste...it overpowered my kitchen, too! Overall, good but not great. Served with coconut rice & grilled veggies.

I made this last night - we really enjoyed it. I took the advice of others - doubled the sauce and it definitely has to simmer at least 15 minutes, then it was a nice thick texture. I used hot sauce instead of chilis - the sauce has a delicious sweet taste. Went great with yellow rice and the black bean and corn salad that is on this website. I will definitely make this again - I would also recommend this dish for a barbecue for company.

Will absolutely make this again. We didn't have fresh peppers, so we used chipotles in adobo. Then we used the extra sauce for dipping sparingly. Absolutely delicious.

I modified this recipe and served it to 24 for lunch yesterday. They raved - here are my suggested changes: double the recipe and simmer sauce at least 15 minutes. Allow to cool slightly, it will thicken as it cools. Marinate pork tenderloin (or chops)that are cut in 1 inch cubes for at least one hour, and up to 6 hours in half of sauce, reserving rest of sauce for serving. Remove pork from marinade and skewer with red bell peppers and green onions. Grill over high heat (put foil on grill where skewers are exposed to prevent buring, until nicely charred, turn and repeat, about 8-10 minutes. I plated over cashew jasmine rice and drizzled with remaining sauce. It was a hit.

Loved it! Cut the pork in chunks because I couldn't quite figure out the instructions. If anyone can explain it that would be great.

First of all, don't discard leftover sauce! Use it for basting at least, keeps the meat tender and flavorful. We're on the South Beach Diet, so I subbed: Equal for sugar, salsa for ketchup, sugar-free syrup for molasses, and Chululu (?) hot sauce for minced chile. Used bigged pork chunks, so grilled 20-25 minutes instead over medium heat. Also added peppers and onions to my skewers. Yum, yum, yum, yum. Was fantastic!

I made this recipe for friends. Marinated pork in sauce overnight. Gave meat lot of flavor. All my guests enjoyed it lots.

This recipe is a definite keeper. I double the sauce recipe and use it for dipping. If I don't have fresh ginger, I have used candied ginger, diced, and it works great. I also keep diced jalapenos in the freezer so I can make this on the spur of the moment if I want. Easy, delish weeknight dinner.

This recipe was amazing! It was easy to make, it was inexpensive and it was very healthy. Everyone who ate it feel in love with it. The only thing that I did that differed from the recipe was that I didn't simmer the sauce for three minutes, it was more like fifteen. Which I think made it better by giving the flavors more time to blend and the pork was so tender. I was very impressed.

My family thought this was great. We used skinned, boned chicken thighs instead, as that is what we had on hand. Yum Yum Yum! We will definitely make it again.

Yummy! A fun meal to eat..my picky pre-teen daughter even asked for more. But how do you make uniform slices? I think next time if the tenderdloin is slightly frozen it might be easier to make nice slices. Defintely will do again. It would also make a great appetizer for a coctail party.

We loved this! Very simple, great taste. My 5year old said, "hey mom, this is pretty good." I did add extra garlic (about double) and I didn't have molasses, so I used honey. Also, didn't have a serrano chile, so used a jalepeno instead. Turned out great! I would double the recipe for the sauce though, so you really have enough to coat the kebabs.

I made just the kebabs for dinner and all my guests raved about them. I marinated the meat for 6 hours and they turned out very tender(hence tenderloin) and flavourful. My husband has requested this recipe to be in the "rotation".

This dish is very good but very sweet. The corn worked as did the grilled green onions. Every part of this dish has a sweet side to it since good corn and green onions tend to be sweet, so be sure to use lots of extra spice to bring down the sweetness.

Very tasty, and VERY easy. I reduced the amount of peppers and garlic, but regretted it. Despite reducing the sauce by 50%, it was not too spicy--next time I will use the amounts in the recipe--should be just right. I brined my pork for 30 mins in 1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 c. Kosher salt, and 4 cups water, turned out nice and moist. Next time I will up the molasses a bit. Good recipe.

I also doubled the amount of pork and bbq sauce for 4 people. I cut the tenderloin into medallions rather than thin strips. My sauce was so thin that I ended up using it as a marinade rather that a bbq sauce (I still can't figure out what I did wrong) but the flavor was wonderful! I served the grilled creamed corn, grilles scallion and beet salad as well and it did make for a complementary meal. So much so that I made it again for different guests 3 days later!

This was delicious, but I used boneless pork strips which I cubed, rather than the tenderloin, at least 1 1/2 lbs. which made 6 generous skewers. I also doubled the amount of bbq sauce. I made the grilled creamed corn accompaniment and grilled scallions.

Great flavor. The sauce could be thicker to keep the tenderloin more moist. Any ideas as to how to make the sauce thicker without giving up the flavor?

We were in the mood to grill some "kebabs" on a warm summer evening and this was a wonderful variation. The sauce is terrific. They do cook fast -- be careful not to overcook. And I'm really glad I DOUBLED everything for 4 people -- the sauce and the meat (2 tenderloins). One tenderloin is not enough for 4 people. We had a skewer or two leftover the next day (not for long!), but that is better than not having enough for your dinner.

Yessshhh! There will be an encore performance! I stuck to the original recipe. I was a bit pressed for time so I'll admit to using a little cornstarch mixed with soy sauce and whisking it in to thicken. What a treat - these were like pork lollipops! I always wished for the secret to my favorite Chinese restaurants "meat sticks"... now I have it. My family is already begging for more!

Thank you, Bernadette; I followed your advice, adding onto the book recipe and cooking the bbq sauce longer. Not being a huge pork fan, however, I followed the recipe using some leftover beef tri-tip (or flank steak works). Came out delicious!

I did everything that was suggested in previous comments, increased the sauce, sliced the pork a little thicker and increased the amount of chilies and it was fabulous. My husband loved them! This recipe is definitely a keeper. I found that I had to simmer the sauce much longer than 3 minutes to reduce it to the proper thickness.

In addition to soaking the skewers, you can wrap the exposed ends in foil and they'll be completely unsinged (like the ones in the photo).

I am planning to try this recipe tonight, so I'm not exactly reviewing it -- just responding to John Kumler who asked about the skewers and not singeing them. I soak bamboo or wood skewers for an hour in cold water, then thread the meat and/or veggies on. This keeps them from burning on the grill.

Rating: 4
I loved these pork kebabs! I added 3 serrano chiles to make it spicier and it was perfect! The more sauce you put on, the better. I would say that one tenderloin serves 2 people. I made 3 tenderloins for 5 people and had some leftover. I discovered that leftovers are really good the next day!

As I grilled outside,Iwould suggest the following. 1.Increase the amount of BBQ sauce to at least 3/4 of a cup. 2. Slice pork loin a little thicker,say a minium of AT LEAST 1/4"thick. Were not making bacon. 3.The magic of not even singing those wooden skewers is the mystery of all. Sure they weren't inserted AFTER cooking just for the picture????
