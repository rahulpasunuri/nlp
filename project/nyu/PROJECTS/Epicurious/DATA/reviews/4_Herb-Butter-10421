Made this as part of my Easter brunch. The store was out of chives so I used 1T of chopped green onions. We used it on roasted asparagus and the biscuits. Delicious!

Fantastic to serve with hot bread or rolls. Looks great and the fresh herbs make for a real treat.

This is really wonderful on vegies or on bread and meat. You will want to make some to keep on hand all the time.
