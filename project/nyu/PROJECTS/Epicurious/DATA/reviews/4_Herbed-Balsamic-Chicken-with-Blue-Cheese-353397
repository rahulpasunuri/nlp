I didn't have time to marinate the chicken for the full two hours but it was good all the same. My family loved this. Also, I didn't have blue cheese on hand to finish the dish but will for next time. One thing that is a bit problematic is the amount of marinade called for. I made it with only half and it was both sufficient and less of a waste of balsamic vinegar, a pricey item.

This is delicious and is my go-to chicken dish. I always laugh when people ask me for the recipe (which is often!), because it is so incredibly simple. This is easy to make and tastes gourmet  if you are even considering making this recipe, do it! I generally leave out the herbes de Provence because I dont like the taste of dried herbs, and I usually serve it with a salad instead of on a bed of arugula. This is one of my all-time favorite Bon Appetit recipes.

This is a great weeknight recipe. The marinating time can be cut in half if the breasts are butterflied first. Also, I seared the breasts in a hot cast iron pan instead of grilling. It turned out well. I used both goat cheese and gorgonzola. We both agreed that the gorgonzola was best!

This was really excellent, and very easy. I liked the slightly sweet marinade with the tart cheese. Followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except I used chicken thighs, which almost always turn out better on the grill - more flavor and they don't dry out. Yes, definitely sprinkle the spices on once the chicken is on the grill.

it's herbed chicken. i used lots of herbs--in the marinade, and on both sides of the chicken as I cooked it. The key, it seemed, was to get the herbs to mix in with the blue cheese--and the better the cheese, the better the taste. Don't skimp and just get any cheese, and don't make your own HdP. The taste is probably three stars, but it is so darned easy, I'm giving a fourth fork here.

I wouldn't say this is exceptional but for the short list of ingredients and ease factor, probably worth four stars. I put the herbs in the marinade like some reviewers recommended which I would not do next time. I think their flavor got a little lost. Makes for a great leftover sandwich!

Easy and tasty. Didn't have cheese today but chicken still tasted very flavorful without it. Instead of grilling I just roasted the chicken at 375 for about 20 mins. Will definitely make again.

Loved this recipe....it was sooo easy! I added my own flair to it...we were out of blue cheese so I added goat cheese instead....it was delicious and the entire family ate every bite. Even my picky eaters asked for seconds!!! I think I will try this marinade on a turkey breast with some white wine rosemary sauce over the holidays and see how it tastes/does.

This was a winner. I thought it was good, but my boyfriend thought it was amazing, and it was incredibly easy to make. I'd say the biggest obstacle in execution is having the 2 hours to let the chicken marinate. But, other than that, it was simple, and easy and very good. I used a grill pan and put the blue cheese on the chicken breasts with 3 minutes left. I tried to slice the blue cheese but ended up with thin crumbles, which was fine. I had no herbs de provance so I used a mix of Italian herbs and oregano, and it was fine. Will definitely make again and again.

The marinade is fool-proof and it is a great idea to have the herbs in there as well. Marinated for 5+ hours. Brought bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts to room temp and dried them before browning (3-4 min) then flipping and finishing in the oven at 425 deg F for 10 min. Reduced the marinade for a finishing sauce (and which I also drizzled on the sauteed asparagus with garden tomatoes and goat cheese crumbles). Used goat cheese rather than Bleu because that's what we had. Worked well having it too at room temp then spreading on the chicken half-way through the cooking. All this was very easy and very yummy and will be made again.

This was excellent and so easy! I served it with the arugula salad, and with chunks of cantaloupe. Great weeknight dinner!

Rating: 3
I wish Epi would let us make files for our recipes, as this one would surely go in the "Weeknight Dinner" file. I used breasts with the bone in, so I browned them first, then let them simmer in the leftover marinade for about 10 min to cook through. Put the cheese on halfway through the simmer, worked like a charm. I would take the arugula recommendation to heart, however. I used spinach instead (for reasons too irrelevant to list here) and know without a doubt that arugula would have been a much better accompaniment.

This recipe was amazing! I live in an apartment, so I bakes the chicken breast halves for 25 minutes at 375. They came out perfectly! I also followed recommendations to put the herbs in the marinade and to put the cheese on the chicken half way through the cooking process to melt the cheese (essential). Also do not use crumbled cheese, too messy. Use sliced cheese. Every one of my guests asked for the recipe afterwards. Some of my guests do not like blue cheese, so they had the chicken without cheese and it was still a huge hit. They commented on the moistness of the chicken, as baked chicken without the bone is rarely moist. I just had the chicken for lunch as a leftover sandwich and it was still moist. Make this in a double batch for the purpose of a leftover hit as well! Make this. Done and done.

Second review for me. Have made countless times. Boil/reduce marinade, and toss with arugula or baby spinach with shredded carrots or cherry tomatoes for a delish warm salad under chicken.

Great taste. I baked the chicken - then pulled it from the oven about 7 minutes prior to finish and slid the bleu cheese under the skin. Yum.

without reading all the other reviews, here is my take: this is so easy to make and quite versatile. You can serve it with green beens and roasted potatoes, or sautee some onions and serve it on french bread as a sub with whatever else you like. Who knew that something so basic can be so delicious!

Always looking for something new to do with chicken I decided to give this a try and glad I did. It was really delicious and couldn't be easier to put together. Following suggestions from previous reviewers I added the herbes de Provence to the marinade, marinated longer than suggested (I had about 3 1/2 hrs.), and boiled the marinating mixture while the chicken cooked for a great sauce. I only had 3 chicken breasts but used the same amount of marinade; used blue cheese on 2 and goat cheese on 1. They were equally delicious. Wouldn't change a thing, all ingredients work perfectly together. Thanks to Jill for the recipe and thanks to the reviewers for their suggestions.

Easy and delicious- moist and flavorful. Used sprinkled blue cheese instead of wedge and cooked it on a grill plan on the stove. If you don't like blue cheese or are looking for a lighter dish,the chicken was good by itself.

Excellent - children loved it. I get annoyed that so many recipes have you prepare way too much marinade,batter or breading & it is wasted (balsamic is expensive!). I used 1/4 cup of balsamic, 2T of oil & added the herbs de Provence to the bag - perfect & nothing tossed out! Also, used room temp. goat cheese.

so easy and tasty. a definite go-to recipe for a quick and easy grilled chicken. i used a very strong blue cheese though and it overpowered the other flavors. will try a milder version next time, or go without entirely.

This dish gives depth and sweetness from the balsamic and salty, creamy from the blue cheese. Boiled down the marinade to drizzle over the cooked chicken. Had with egg noodles and an arugula salad with roasted beets and candied walnuts. This is a tremendous chicken dish.

I may have even commented on this before, but I am BACK! This has turned into my go-to grilled chicken recipe, just putting the balsamic and oil in a big freezer bag and SHAKE! I just do it w/o the recipe now - just put some of both in there. There's a recent bon appetit recipe for grilled veg with blue cheese/mustard vinaigrette - so I just did that tonight and put on both. This is a great recipe for someone learning how to cook (like me!).

Quick question: did anyone substitute the blue cheese for another? My husband doesn't like it all (his only fault!), so I need something else. Would Fontina work? An early reviewer used Boursin.

Amazingly delicious! Marinated the chicken for about a day. My Herbs de Provence have lavender included...yum! We have a communal BBQ and were having trouble getting the right temperature which means we spent forever cooking them (couldn't get our mesquite charcoal very hot). However, this slow cooking made the chicken absolutely delicious! So juicy!! We had really cheap (read: disgusting) blue cheese. However, it still tasted great with the balsamic & the herbs. I would use a better cheese next time...i'm thinking Humboldt Fog!! Definitely worth the splurge! Overall, delicious easy meal. The flavors were an interesting combination and it really jazzed up standarded grilled chicken. Yum!

Made this especially for my mother- in-law who had given me a bag of herbs de provence from France (!) and who doesn't like anything spicy or garlicy. I'll use this marinade again. Invited a few other singles, called it a "widows and orphans" dinner, served w/ grilled zucchini & fresh corn on the cob. Everyone raved!

One of the best quick-easy-marinades I've ever tasted. What can I say, balsamic vinegar + grill, works every time. Eat this with or without the blue cheese, it's great either way (I didn't change anything else). If you do use cheese you should obviously put it on while cooking so it melts (duh). I would pair this with a pale ale or a good porter. One more thing: next time I'm going to make it into the ultimate chicken sandwich--whaddya think of that?

Made this last night for friends and everyone loved it. Obviously, it's super easy and it looks lovely. Used local chicken breast, which I brined, and overall, it was a great dish. Agree that it should probably be 3.5 but with the ease of preparation and good looks . . . nice enough for a dinner party.

Very easy, but doesn't taste like it! I added some whole grain mustard to the marinade and I think it really gave it some punch. I also used a very mild, creamy blue cheese so it didn't overpower the chicken. Next time I will put the cheese on while the chicken was still on the grill so that it melts a little bit more.

Easy and simple. Served with a green salad and thick sliced beefsteak tomatoes just drizzles with olive oil, salt and pepper. It may have been the type of blue cheese i chose (two soft?) but mine did not look nearly as elegant as the image shown here... My cheese crumbled and I had to kind of push and mold it onto the chicken. Regardless - quite simple and a wonderful combination of flavors.

We LOVED this recipe. I added a teaspoon of dijon mustard to the marinade and use gorgonzola cheese on top. Served with spinach salad/balsamic dressing and grilled herb garlic bread. It was the perfect summer dinner, light and flavorful. Everyone, including guests and a 2 yr old gobbled it up. We cooked on a charcoal grill, with the lid shut, which I think was key. The chicken was super moist. Next time I'll cook an extra batch to use in lunches and salads for the week.

This just didn't do it for us...it was tasty, but the taste was all blue cheese. The chicken, on it's own, did not absorb the flavors of the vinegar and herbes de Provence and was just kind of bland. Won't need to make this onoe again.

This gets four forks for time invested/results. Tasted more complicated than recipe actually was, which is always a plus. Have already made twice. A new tip to share: I used split breasts and just peeled the skin off before cooking. Retains moisture, especially for grilling. And we're bone lovers anyway.

Great idea, but the balsamic and blue cheese overpower the chicken. My guests said they liked it, but I know it could have been better had I used a milder blue cheese and less vinegar. I completely agree with the Pinot Noir match up vs. a white wine. Arugula or spinach salad makes this complete.

I made this dish tonight and it was very good. The family enjoyed this light, refreshing dish. Definitely serve with sliced fresh tomatoes and the arugula salad. The sides add amazing contrast to the blue cheese. The blue cheese did slightly overpower the chicken. I was not able to taste the distinct flavors of the chicken. Still a keeper!

One of the best easy recipes I've found for ages. Served it with just arugula tossed with EVO and balsamic. Slice ripe tomatoes may have been nice, and, of course, some crusty bread, but it was fine as suggested. I used the Foreman grill, BTW, which was perfect for this.

Remarkably easy, but would be a great dish for a fancier dinner party. Be careful with the choice of side dishes as the blue cheese / balsamic combo is pretty strong. We tried with a CA Chardonnay, which was a bit beaten up by the blue cheese. I would recommend something with more weight, like a Pinot Noir or Merlot.
