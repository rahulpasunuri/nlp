what went wrong? I followed the recipe closely. I soaked the beans over night and I boiled them for an hour.Them I baked them for 5 hours at 300 keeping them covered with water. At 5 hours they were still very hard, I left them in for three more hours, before I gave up. they were still to hard and tasted starchy and raw. i have made baked beans before using the recipe on the back of the Thompsons bag and had no problems. I realize that its not the recipe.Has anyone had this happen to them?

These were bland beans. I did as other suggested and doubled the bacon, cooking it ahead of time just enough to get some fat rendered to cook a chopped onion in. Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. Luckily I was making these the day before I needed them. I ended the cook time while the sauce on the beans was still a bit thinner than I wanted and moved them into an 13x9 glass pan for overnight. Before warming them up the next day I "doctored" them with more of everything until the flavor was alright then I baked them to the consistency I prefer. This is just not a very good recipe.

This is an awesome recipe. I doubled the recipe. I did what others suggested, cooked a pound of bacon until almost crispy drained off the grease and sauted 1/2 a yellow onion. I also added a splash of Jack Daniels.

Excellent recipe. Originally made as written, later changed it to make it less sweet. 1/4 of maple instead of 1/2. Added a pound of bacon instead of two slices as well as two chopped onions - one early on, and one toward the end to have nice crisp chunks. Used a slow cooker and it turned out great.

Great taste, everything you want with baked beans. Added cooked bacon and onions to the recipe. Will definitely make again.

Added bacon and onion as others suggested. Very good but a bit of a time suck. I checked beans after 1 hr in oven and they were completely dry. Had to add boiling water every 1/2 hr. Done in about 4 1/2 hrs. Too time consuming. But guests did like.

Doubled this and made it for a party Saturday night and am just getting to the leftovers -- yum! Following other suggestions, I fried up a pound of bacon, drained that, reserving just a touch of grease to saute an onion. Dumped both in with the beans. Also added cider vinegar as someone suggested. I used robust molasses and grated ginger into the mix, but next time would use more. Good recipe.

Perfect as written except I use four slices of good, thick bacon instead of two. I don't think the extra steps other reviewers mention are necessary. This has a nice balance of flavor, the beans are savory and it is very quick and easy to make - PERFECT!

As others have suggested I upped the bacon to half a pound, chopped and sauteed it for a few minuted, dumped the excess fat and then added a chopped yellow onion. I also exchanged half of the maple syrup for brown sugar and added a few tablespoons of molasses and a few tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. Came out great.

Delicious, had guests asking for the recipe. Left out the molasses and used ham hock instead of the bacon because that is what I had.

I made this recipe last night except I doubled it... kinda. I doubled the sauce recipe but, only did 1 1/2 pounds of beans. I did a combo of the Navy & Great Northern beans (which made for a nice texture. As others have said, more bacon is necessary so I baked a full pound of bacon, chopped it up thin and threw it in with the sauce. Thanks for the onion tip as well; used the bacon grease to fry a 1/2 a yellow onion and threw that in as well. Used my grandfather's bean pot and my husband and I agree they are THE BEST beans we have EVER eaten!! If I was going to make one batch I would definitely double the sauce recipe though!

This is a good base, I guess, but you really need a 1/2 pound bacon, 1 onion (chopped), 1 green onion (chopped) and probably double the sauce. Also, make sure and check it every hour otherwise the beans will dry out in the oven!

I did as the other reviewers suggested and rendered the chopped bacon first, dumped some of the excess fat, and fried a small onion in the leftover drippings. Didn't change anything else. I made the Irish Soda Bread recipe (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Noreen-Kinneys-Irish-Soda-Bread-241956)to go with the beans. De-lish! Husband practically licked the plate clean.

This is an excellent base recipe to improvise upon as you see fit. I doubled the recipe to bring to a soccer party. I added a lb of bacon which I cooked separately in a 325 oven so that the fat was rendered and the bacon was evenly cooked. I also added one large onion which I sauteed in some of the rendered bacon fat. I added the bacon (chopped) and the onion to the beans at the same time I added the sauce ingredients. I will definitely make these again.

Excellent! Thick sauce and very tasty. I was looking at another Epicurious recipe and soaked the beans first. Still worked. Definitely check the water level and add just a small amount each time. My additions, based on other's comments of too sweet: 1 chopped onion; 1 large diced green pepper; 4 slices pepper bacon, crisp-fried and crumbled. This one is so nice to bake and have comfort smells all day.

This recipe worked perfectly. It's a little too sweet for me, but I think it has exactly the classic flavor it should. Next time I might add a bit less maple.

I was very worried during the cooking process as my samples didn't have a hint of maple.....but, when it was done, WOW! I really love maple and will be making this for all barbecues from now on.

Excellent! Don't add too much water near the end, I did and had to let them cook an additional hour to get rid of it. Better after they sit a while.

Excellent recipe. I didn't change a thing, and although it takes a long time to make, definitely worth the effort. Beans did dry out during cooking so watch carefully.

I have made this recipe three times now, the first with no bacon and scant on the brown sygar...delicious. Second and third time with exactly the amounts specified but did not use bacon, used salt port and added partially cooked pork chops cut up...again absolutely delicious. Maple Syrup used is home grown not store bought. I am making again tomorrow. Freezes well. Would recommend this recipe highly.
