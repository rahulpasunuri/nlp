This was my first attempt at a frittata, so I think it got a little overcooked. I think the flavors were just kind of so-so, though. It's quick and easy and makes a nice, light dinner with a salad. I just think there are more flavorful frittata recipes out there.

A great brunch item! This dish went over very well with company. No leftovers! I made a few revisions: as someone suggested I added artichokes hearts. In addition, I used cheddar cheese instead of the swiss and also added some oregano, basil and Nature's seasoning. To make it healthier, I used Better than Eggs, Turkey Ham and 2% shredded cheese and it was still delicious.

This was a great recipe - I didn't change a thing. Served with roasted garlic potatoes - easy and delicious. Even though my kids didn't like it, my husband and I thought it was a winner.

Fantastic and easy. I doubled the recipe, which made it take a little longer to cook in the center (I had to finish it off in the oven for 5 extra minutes). I also added asparagus, which was delicious.

Ten friends descended on my house this morning and I prepared this dish "on the fly" adding chopped artichoke hearts. It got rave reviews from all. It was simple to make and, accompanied by banana pancakes, fresh fruit and orange juice,it was the perfect brunch. I won't be surprised if they're back tomorrow!

Three forks because it is a simple and delicious way to use up leftover ham--and very quick.

Wow! The broiling trick answered our question on how to finish off a frittata. We added a little garlic and a few sliced green olives to this and served with crispy homemade hashbrown potatoes...a special Valentine's brunch!
