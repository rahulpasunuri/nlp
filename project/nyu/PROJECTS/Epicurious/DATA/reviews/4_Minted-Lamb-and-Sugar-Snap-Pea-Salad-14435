This is an excellent way to deal with left over lamb. I didn't have any peas, so I just put the dressing over cubed lamb, sliced red onion, and chick peas and it was delicious. The fresh mint made this dish.

I made this for a pre-concert picnic and it drew raves. This is a far better way to use leftover grilled leg of lamb than attempting to re-heat it. The sugar snap peas I bought at the farmers' market were a little past their prime, so I blanched them for substantially longer than a minute, but otherwise I followed the recipe here to the letter.

This is a fabulous dish which I have made several times to rave reviews. It is also good as a leftover since we were unable to finish it the first night.

We had a party and wanted to use the mint from our garden. It was a big hit - so delicious and perfect for summer.

This has become classic in tbis family. So good and so refreshing....after all? What is a salad if its not filled with meat?
