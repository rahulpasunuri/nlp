This is delicious. I also used a small can of mandarine oranges and added a little bit of the syrup to the dressing and eliminated the sugar. Note to grammyhedge: I slice my red onion very thin and then I soak in water for about a half hour, then drain, and pat dry. The onions won't be as strong.

Amazing. One of the best recipes on Epicurious (as someone else stated). I get lazy and use mandarin oranges sometimes. I also like this salad with arugula.

Followed the recipe, except took the comments about too much salt and cut that way down...wonderful flavours and textures. We all loved it and our guests were very impressed. Will make this again. Onions I was able to get were a bit harsh...any suggestions?

I loved the combination of oranges and warm goat cheese. The cheese undercut the acidity of the oranges and dressing, which was nice. I did add a tablespoon more orange juice for the dressing.

Slicing navel oranges, reserving juice...blah blah blah. Sorry, No time. I opened a can of mandarine oranges and used a carton of OJ - it was STILL good. I'm sure with the original ingredients it would be stellar! I had to substitute (sucessfully) brown mustard and plain white vinegar. I followed the recommendation of a previous reviewer and made a more concentrated version of the dressing by using 4 tablespoons of OJ, plus 1 tblspoon of vinegar and boiled it down until reduced by about 1/2. Also, I used only 1 tablespoon of oil. It's a keeper.

Outstanding flavors, with the exception of the ridiculous salt content. Cut that way down and you've got an easy, everyday winner.

I made this last night (from a page of the '01 Gourmet that I'd saved) - I skipped the onion but I thought it was great -- the goat cheese was simple & delicious. Note it should say 350 degree oven...

great recipe....for all who thought dressing was too thin...try reducing fresh squeezed oj with the vinegar and sugar to a light syrup, then tossing with oil and mustard. A quick squeeze of meyer lemon woulnt hurt either. Oil cured black olives could be added for a more mediterranean feel.:) a keeper

Was fine but dressing was a bit too thin to bring out the best in the chunky components.

Easily one of the best recipes I have ever made off of Epicurious. So quick and so delicious - I would be very pleased if I was served this in a restaurant. I added the salt and sugar to taste and used a tablespoon of fresh OJ instead of trying to catch the juice from the oranges. Warmed the goat cheese in the oven at 250 - can't wait to make this again.

maybe i'm biased bc. i love goat cheese but this salad is great. i usually make the dressing ahead and put it in the refridgerator to cool it. i've also made this with blood oranges and it was just as amazing as the original.

Rating: 2
On the plus side, the combination of spinach, oranges, goat cheese, red onion, and pecans is delicious. The negatives... I didn't like the dressing at all... too bland, oily, and salty (and I did use kosher salt). Plus segmenting oranges and making the medallions was too much work for a quick dinner. Next time I'll try another dressing recipe and will add toasted whole pecans and goat cheese crumbles slightly warmed in the microwave. Will also just segment the oranges.

made the recipe pretty much as-is, except subbed breadcrumbs for nuts (shopping malfunction ;)and used blood oranges. the dressing is quite thin. salad isn't spicy per se, but tastes fresh and light. the word 'succulent' comes to mind. perfect for springtime.

Knock out! Very reminiscent of a salad from a favourite restaurant in my old neighb. Partner delighted in taking the leftover serving for lunch the next day. I sprinkled the excess pecans into the salad.

Made with pears instead of oranges, and did a dressing with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, a good seedy mustard, honey and a bit of lime juice. Tossed the greens and onions with the dressing, but added the pears later. People loved it, and the baked goat cheese really made it something special. Thanks to other cooks for the tip re: red onions -- that worked really well.

Made this for a dinner party that included kids. Everyone really liked it including the kids who had to be coaxed to try it but then ate every bite. I ran out of time and just chunked the goat cheese and sprinkled in the pecans. Still very good but next time I'll take the time to make the rounds hot. This is a make again.

Rating: 4
The dressing was slightly acidic but balanced nicely by the mild goat cheese. I used crushed waluts since they were all I had on hand and they worked very well. This was an excellent salad. Someday I might try substituting the organges with strawberries or blueberries instead. They would also go well with the warm goat cheese.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I used a very strong organic dijon instead, and loved it. I also used 1/2 amount of salt, which was perfect for my taste, but I use sea salt instead of kosher. Thank you to the reviewer who explained how to segment the oranges, though I will need more practice.

Very good, and very easy. We made it twice this weekend and it was well-received. I think the ratio of goat cheese to spinach is weighted too high in the goat cheese area, and would cut that back on that. The dressing wasn't spectacular, but the combination of other flavors is grand.

This is a wonderful recipe...my guests raved about it. It will find it to my table many times. I substituted romaine hearts which I like working with more than spinach.

Made this last night for a preogressive dinner party - and it received raving reviews! Great complimenting flavors and worth the work (sectioning oranges, making goat cheese medallions). I reduced the kosher salt by half based on other reviewers recommendations and added addtional oj. super recipe - will definitely make again soon!

I thought this was a very nice winter salad. I didn't have the problems some of the other reviewers had.

Save that supermarket white wine vinegar for washing the windows and invest in a bottle of organic, gourmet white wine vinegar for this salad. Also, fresh organge juice will mask the tart flavor of the vinegar. One half a teaspoon of kosher salt does not sound like too much. I wonder if the other reviewers actually used kosher salt, which is less salty than table salt?

Rating: 2
This salad was good, but the dressing needs some work. The white-wine vinegar did nothing for the orange juice...I ended up adding some apple cider vinegar and a touch of honey, which helped. Definitely only add salt to taste at the end once you've mixed the rest of the ingredients as others have suggested. And if you plan on skipping the fresh oranges, please don't! They make the salad and the natural sweet complements the goat cheese where mandarin oranges would be a bit too-sweet.

Rating: 4
Like a previous reviewer, I found the dressing to be WAY too salty. I ruined the dressing the first time I made it and had to start over. I would recommend that you start with a pinch of salt and then taste. Otherwise, this is a GREAT salad! My dinner guests said it looked like something you would get in a restaurant!

I found the dressing to be really salty for some reason and I followed the instructions to the word. Next time I would probably omit the salt completely. I was short on time and used canned Mandarin Oranges and added in some sliced mushrooms. They seemed to do the trick nicely.

I liked the fresh taste of this salad, but thought it lacked flavor. The individual ingredients tasted fine, but as a whole, it lacked flavor. May make it again just because I love spinach.

I served this salad to 10 dinner guests on father's day. Everyone said it was the best salad they ever had and this group frequents some of the finest restaurants around! The fresh orange segments and warm, nut-rolled goat cheese make this salad outstanding. Best of all, it's very easy to put together.

Screw the canned oranges. They're garbage. Segmenting a fresh navel orange is about the easiest thing there is to do, especially since I assume we are dealing with better-than-average cooks on this site. But for the 25 words or less demo, here goes. Cut a thin slice off the bottom of the orange so it lays flat on a cutting board. Then just follow the curve of the orange and remove the peel and pith with a paring knife. Then pick up the orange in your left hand (if right-handed) and cut wedges, again following the natural membranes that separate the sections. I usually do this step over a bowl to catch the juice, which I then incorporate into the vinaigrette. So there. Fresh goat cheese and orange is a great natural pairing--almost Dreamsicle-like. Adding good red onion or Vidalia slices, crunchy nuts like pine nuts or almonds along with spinach or any other kind of green makes for a simple and amazing salad that will quickly become a staple in your kitchen.

Loved it!! I had most of my friends ask for this recipe. I used a can of mandarin oranges and juiced 1 large naval orange for the dressing, so I did not deal with cutting the oranges and the mess. Was easy, had a great presentation and everyone loved it...A Keeper!

Very good salad, with the oranges complimenting the goat cheese perfectly. The only changes I made was to increase both the vinegar and mustard from 1 to 2 teaspoons.

An excellant salad. The goat cheese is scrumptous. I've used baby spinach- just 1/2 pound. The dressing is delicious. I added 1/4 tsp of sea salt instead of kosher. Have prepared it 3 times.

Great salad even without the goat cheese. I made this for a holiday potluck at work and added some dried cranberries that I had soaked overnight in orange juice. If I wasn't using the goat cheese, I'd add some toasted pecans to it.

I think this is a great salad. I totally simplified it and created the perfect summer side dish. First, I used a small can of manderin(?) oranges (rinsed) to cut down on prep time. Rather than heat up the oven, I added whole walnuts to the salad and crumbled goat cheese on top. I used only about 1/2 of a red onion, as I find they can be quite overpowering. And finally, I made the dressing pretty much as written, but greatly reduced the salt as I find it works better to salt and pepper the entire salad just before tossing it with the dressing. Enjoy.

I made this as part of my family's Easter dinner and everyone loved it. However, I didn't care for the dressing at all--salty (I used Kosher salt) and oily. I substituted a dressing that I use on another spinach salad: 3 T. white wine vinegar, 2 T. olive oil, 1 1/2 T. honey, 1 tsp. dijon mustard, 1/4 C. orange juice.

Kept recipe as is, served as started for Christmas Day dinner in front of a prime rib. Enjoyed by all. Important to use kosher salt or it will come out way too salty. I, too, added a bit more vinegar in accoradance with my wife's tase.

Very tasty. I also used different greens. The dressing was too bland, so I added more vinegar. The second time (the next night!), I used toasted walnuts, crumbled the goat cheese, added pitted Kalamata olives, and used half walnut oil and half olive oil--very good also!

If you want to impress your guests, serve this simple salad. I made a few changes. Since we are not big spinach fans, I used a spring mix salad. To make it even easier, I used a small can of mandarin oranges, and eliminated the salt. It tasted like something you would order in a gourmet restaurant.
