This is an old family favorite, except that we whip the cottage cheese until there are no visable curds. I definitely prefer it that way. So yummy!

This also tastes great if you replace the oranges with canned peaches and the orange Jell-o with peach flavoured. It's even good with some sliced banana added.

This is a variation on a Better Homes & Gardens recipe from the '70's. It called for the same ingredients, except the Jello was orange-pineapple, and there was no extra Knox gelatin. I make it every year for the holidays, and it always goes quickly. Drain the fruits thoroughly. I never bother to mold it. It tastes good, and looks great in a bowl.

I make a very similar dish to this one - only I cook the Jell-o as the package describes, chill for 1 hour, mix in Whipped Cream, pineapple (drained well), mandarin oranges (drained well), and pecan chips. Then I let it sit in the refrigerator overnight (if you can). I don't use cottage cheese or extra gelatin. This comes out nice and creamy and fairly firm. I think the cottage cheese takes away from it, but that's a personal thing.

It tasted very good, however, it did not mold to my expectation. I added both the jello and gelatin powder to the recipe. Should I have first dissolved the gelatin powder? I was not clear on that. I think I will try it again only I will dissolve the gelatin first and I will blend it in a blender for a more smooth even texture.

For the previous questions: Do not add water to the dry Jello mix, just sprinkle it into the cottage cheese and stir well. I didn't have the Knox gelatin on hand, but I didn't plan to mold it so I thought I'd try just the large box of Jello. After refrigerating overnight, the consistency was fine without including the Knox gelatin. (Just be sure that you drain the fruit real well.) I used Lite Cool Whip and lowfat cottage cheese and it made for a nice light and refreshing dish. It does make a large amount, so it would be great for a potluck. Enjoy!

I hope that the recipe is as simple as is sounds. I will follow it and be able to clarify the two last reviewers question. Tah, tah for now!

This recipe sounds good but the directions are confusing to me. Do you prepare the gelatin first and then add to the cottage cheese or do you add them dry. Thanks! I'll go back and rate this after I make it.

I haven't made this yet because the directions don't make sense to me. Do you just mix the gelatin powder with the cottage cheese or do you mix with hot water and make the gelatin according to the package directions first and mix that with the cheese. I would like some clarification. Thanks

This is a childhood favorite. It is easy, delicious, and is a vibrant orange color which is wonderful for presentation.
