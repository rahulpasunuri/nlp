I have made this many times now. I make like it is but add 1 cup black cherries pitted and 1 Tbl of black cherry preserves. With 3/4C of Port wine. Reduce the wine by 2/3's.Then add cherries and preserves. Then add the last 4 ingredents. Scoring of the fat is a must to render all the fay from the breast

This recipe is fabulous! I had bought two duck breast halves from Peapod, not knowing what I was going to do with them. Found this recipe and I actually had everything, even sweet potatoes! Served with haricot verts; what a pretty plate. Getting all the ingredients together was a little lengthy so next time I will be more organized. This is a true keeper.

The duck was great, but I was not at all impressed with the sauce, way too much effort for the taste. Excellent way to cook the duck and I did put it in the oven at 400 for a little over 5 minutes and it was still rare...may cook a litle longer next time for med. rare.

Excellent! In all fairness I did not follow the searing technique of the duck breast called for in this recipe. Instead I used my foolproof method that has been my staple for some time now. After searing my duck breast I did follow the instructions for the sauce which turned out terrific! I followed the directions as stated and brought the sauce to a boil. I did boil about 2 minutes longer until the sauce was reduced by 1/3 and because a lovely glaze. The sauce complimented the duck breast perfectly. My husband thought it was 'awesome'. My foolproof duck searing technique is to score the fat side of the duck breast, then rub with salt and pepper on both side. Over med/high heat, place duck breast, fat side down, on hot pan. Cook for 6 to 7 minutes(depending on the size of the duck breast). Turn over duck breast and cook 2 minutes. Remove duck breast to a baking dish and bake at 400F for 5 minutes. Remove and let set on cutting board for 5 minutes before slicing. Medium rare every time. I highly suggest this duck recipe as the flavors are wonderful.

My son is a chef, so I had a sample of 4 duck breasts in the freezer from his supplier. I followed the recipe for ingredients exactly. I was told it is important to score the skin to render the fat. My other tip was to cook a little slower to render all of the fat. I cooked at medium and turned it down a bit toward the end and added a minute or two. Breast temp was 148 when I removed from pan. I served w/ mashed sweet potato and a wilted spinach w/ shitakes and a touch of lemon juice. Excellent and I'm not a huge duck fan.

I made this mainly for the technique for cooking the duck, which can be notoriously difficult. The duck was excellent! Perfectly cooked, not too greasy, moist all the way through. I would recommend this technique for anyone making duck breast. And since its all stovetop, you can make the duck in batches and keep warm in the oven. I sauteed the onions and served with a simple salad with gorgonzola. Came out great.

Very easy, very flexible (I used chillis that I have been marinading for Piri-Piri in whisky for 3 years instead of the dried chilli). Using the timings given, the duck was perfectly cooked, so I think the person who found it 'raw' may need to upgrade their cookware (I use All-clad) or their cooker. I served it with steamed baby potatoes and flash-fried mange-tout. All round very good!

This is a great dish with a few small adjustments. First, the sauce has a strong honey taste. To counteract this, add more port, a bit of lemon juice and some chicken stock. Upon reduction, the sauce is greatly improved. Also, finish the duck in a 350 degree oven because otherwise it will come out too rare. (Note: I enjoy rare to medium rare duck but this was raw!). Use a meat thermometer to check internal temperature.

The first time I fixed this, my wife and I both thought it was the best thing we had ever eaten. When I fixed it again, I overcooked it, but my guests were still in awe at the flavor.

I used beaujolais instead of port and chipolte chiles in adobo sauce because I couldn't find ancho, and it was delicious. Not too sweet and just the right amount of spice.

An adventurous substitute for Turkey at Thanksgiving. Nice balance of sweet and spicey but requires some last minute prep - so use it for small dinner party.

This was the first time that I used this recipe. The recipe was very easy to follow, however, when does one add the scallions? I did not use them, and I substituted one small shallot for the white onion. I thought that the overall flavor was very good. The glaze complimented the duck very well.

This is the second time I've made this recipe and it is just as good the second time around. I rarely follow recipes to the "T", but this recipe is a perfect mix of all ingredients. On a side note, it wasn't till looking up this recipe for a second time that I realized the contributor (Windows on the World). Just knowing that, this is a recipe me and my family will certainly treasurer.

I am always looking for new recipes for duck breast, so I tried this. It was good, but not fabulous, although my guests enjoyed it. I will continue my quest....

Delicious. Easy to prepare. Next time, I might add a little hotter pepper. There's a restaurant in Key West that serves duck breast with a jalapeno sauce. It is excellent.

The sauce is very tasty but does slightly mask the delicate flavour of the duck (perhaps it's the ducks we get in the UK ?). I also had to use 'ordinary' red chilli flakes as we cannot get 'ancho' chillis. The sauce would however be superb with a stronger tasting meat such as lamb (from Wales or the Cheviots !).
