The real question is what to do with the other 12 pounds of banana squash after you have your two cups! Have you ever SEEN one of these giants?!

Fabulous! The earthy ancho pepper flavor in the chili colorado sauce is a perfect complement for the roasted root vegetables. A wedge of lime is an essential addition as it brightens the flavors beautifully. We substituted pork tenderloin for the pork butt, and saved a good deal of preparation time by browning diced pieces of pork, then simmering them in the sauce.

This has become a family favorite. One time when I couldn't find the pork butt, I used flank steak instead. My family liked it better than the pork. Whenever my son comes home, I have to make this and send an extra pan home with him. Highly recommend this recipe.

I made only the sauce from this recipe. I was trying to find a good recipe for Chile Colorado sauce that I could mix with leftover pot roast chunks for Colorado Burritos, and hit upon this one. I thought it strange that it didn't use any tomatoes, but made it anyway! The color was wonderful and I couldn't wait to taste it, but it was so RAW tasting! I felt like I was just tasting pureed peppers! There was no real flavor to the sauce, only that raw pepper taste. I'm actually going to use the sauce tomorrow night, but I plan on mixing in a 15 oz can of tomato sauce to see if I can salvage it. As written, it tastes nothing like the rich red Colorado sauce I've eaten in restaurants. It LOOKS like that sauce, but doesn't taste like it!

A definite yumm. The chili colorado sauce is fabulous and certainly merits use in other recipes.I am using the leftover sauce for a variant of huevos rancheros.The sauce would be great on chicken and probably beef as well.This recipe is a lot of work but the results are worth the effort.

This is the best recipe for leftover roast or grilled pork. I have cheated and used canned enchilada sauce when in a hurry, but the basic concept is wonderful. There's something about the addition of juicy potatoes and onions that takes it out of the "just leftovers" category so my picky family actually finishes the whole thing.

One of the best dishes we've ever made!!! Guests have loved it too. We use acorn squash instead of banana squash (easier to find) and pork tenderloin instead of pork butt (more tender). You really should try this recipe, it's one of our all time favorites!!! Cheers!
