Yummy! Simplified this a bit. Prepared butter, using more salt and less butter, while I pare boiled corn. Dried corn, brushed with butter mixture and grilled til slightly browned on all sides. My husband didn't add additional salt or butter, which is a minor miracle.

I hate to go against the crowd on this one, but I don't think the cumin does much to bring out the flavor of the corn. Also, the "keep the husk" technique is really just for show. Husk the corn and wrap in aluminum foil instead. Next time, I think I'll stick to salt, pepper, and butter.

Great flavor! If you soak corn in water about an hour about an hour before prep the husks will not burn.

The flavors of this were really good, even though I had trouble with the tied husks burning on the grill and then disintegrating into tiny charred bits upon serving. Next time I will use the same ingredients, but wrap the corn in foil for grilling.

This is a most interesting and innovative way of sprucing up plain old corn without ruining all that is good about plain old corn. The flavor of the cumin seed is mild and amazingly complimentary. This has has made frequent appearances at summer meals, especially with BBQ'd lamb roasts and chicken.
