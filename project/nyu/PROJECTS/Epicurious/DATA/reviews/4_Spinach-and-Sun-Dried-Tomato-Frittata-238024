This recipe is AMAZING! It is so flavorful 3 Everyone loved it. I didn't have 4 little dishes so I cooked it in 2 medium sized dishes. I only wish I had made more because it was so good! (not because my portion wasn't filling, but because I wanted to eat an unhealthy amount of it!) I will definitely make this again, probably on a regular basis. Had it for breakfast. Yum. 3

I loved this recipe, in part because my husband, toddler and 12 mo. old baby all loved it. We're meat eaters and since I made it for dinner and we so often have meat with our meals, it felt like it needed something. My husband suggested a side of sausage.

This was an easy recipe and a delicious meal. It is so simple it makes an easy mid-week meal and the kids should like it. I used Parmesan because I had no Asiago, cooked this in a glass baking dish and skipped the berries and toast. Vary the ingredients to suit your personal taste.

We enjoyed this recipe very much. Seeing how I dislike peeling shallots, I used vidallia onion instead. Also added mushrooms and sautéed them with the onion. Put in some minced garlic too. Used the sun dried tomatoes in olive oil. The only thing wrong with this recipe, is we wanted to eat more! Would double next time.

Delicious. My only question was to use dried sun dried tomatoes from a bag, or the ones in oil. I use the ones in oil. perfect.

Made this recipe for a recent potluck at work. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. For ease of transporting, I cooked it in a muffin pan instead of the individual baking dishes. It cooked just fine this way. I will definitely make this recipe again! It turned out wonderful!

Followed this recipe to a T..... guests LOVED it... well I actually added a little half and half at the last minute ( can never follow anything precisely... have to always add my touch!) ... At the last minute I used muffin tins instead of individual baking dishes... sprayed the muffin tins with an olive oil mist and popped the Frittatas's out and served in the same serving dish as the Italian rolls .... a HUGE HIT

Easy to adapt. No shallots or asiago, so I substituted onion and Parmesan. It needed more than 14 minutes to set, though.Very tasty.

This recipe is incredibly adaptable to servings. I quartered it and put it in a little heart shaped ramekin for myself. It bubbled over just slightly but I think it was either me adding slightly too much basil or having a slightly too small ramekin. Either way it's a lovely lovely quick easy healthy breakfast. PERFECT for just before my morning work-out; not too heavy!

Cooked this for a light lunch today and halved the recipe for the two of us. I used quite large ramekins and it cooked in exactly the right time. I didn't have any fresh fruit so used frozen, defrosted berries, -- delicious and quite unusual. Have put it in my personal database for future use - great

The flavors in this frittata were really good, and I especially liked how they were in individual ramekins! The only problem I had was that it took about 20 minutes to bake, rather than 14.

I doubled the cheese, spinach, and shallot, quadrupled the basil, used six whole eggs, and baked it in one large dish (per a friend's suggestion). Quite possibly the best thing I've made from Epicurious. My 16 month old daughter actually said "mmmmmm" while shoveling it in her mouth. This one will go in our permanent book.

I love this easy recipe. I cooked it in a large cast iron dish. I just doubled the recipe. Will make this again.

This was seriously delicious. I made a number of changes, but I think I stayed true to the original recipe. I made it in a pie pan, because I didn't have ramekins. I used a small onion instead of a shallot, and I used mozzarella instead of asiago cheese. I will definitely be making this again.

This is a staple for me, I used half the cheese to cut down on some calories, still yummy! I also put them in 2 ramekins instead of 4, increased cooking time a little. Overall, this is soo easy, I put it into the oven, take a shower, and its ready. The other ones heat up great in the microwave the next day!

Excellent!!! One change however - it took about 20 minutes in the oven for the frittatas to set. We don't like our frittatas runny, so we baked them longer.

This was such a delicious frittata. I used all whole eggs and parmesan cheese as I couldn't get asagio. I served with a salad as toast and berries seemed an unusual match.

Loved this! I doubled it, added in some zucchini, substituted goat cheese, some Parisien herbs from Penzey's spices and some sriracha chili sauce for a little kick! My guests loved it. I used a silicone floral mold and it was a hit for my sunflower loving cousin who co hosted the New Years brunch!

We love this recipe - have used Goat Cheeses for Asiago, and Spring-onions for Shallot. But Guests & family alike all enjoy tremendously!

This recipe was delicious. I made it for my family and boyfriend's parents... They LOVED it. I doubled the recipe, put it all in a pie dish, and baked it for 30-35 minutes. This is a very flavorful, colorful, and healthy breakfast.

Just made these for a baby shower and they turned out great and were easy to make for special diets and a large group. I added mushrooms, garlic and a little spice. Next time I will add more sun-dried tomato and maybe shallots. Overall I enjoyed it and will add this to my bruch recipe list.

I hate it when people change recipes and then review them, but...I used all whole eggs and cooked in a saute pan, fabulous!

This was an easy brunch dish that everyone loved. They baked up nicely in the ramekins and could really be modified in a variety of ways. Yum.

Deliciious! I thought this frittata had great flavor for so few ingredients. Made this as a weeknight meal served with green beans and garlic toast instead of regular/wheat toast. Nice and easy recipe that my hubby loved. Will definitely make again.

Although I didn't go "ga ga" over this frittata, I'd probably still make it again. Next time I may add a few shakes of tobasco sauce to give it more of a kick. Also, I had to bake it for 30 min. in order for the eggs to sit.

I didn't have the little ramekins either, so I used a small cast iron skillet. I substituted 1/2 cup of ricotta cheese. Next time I'll add more tomatoes, but otherwise, very tasty!

Very easy. I used a 6-inch skillet pan instead of the little cups. It took about 14 minutes. I made it without shallots and it was still delicious. Very easy and savory.
