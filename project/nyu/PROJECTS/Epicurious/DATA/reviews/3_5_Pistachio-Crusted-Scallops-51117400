Delicious and really simple. The coating of the scallops after cooking lets you taste the freshness of the herbs.

Outstanding! The flavors of the fresh herbs and toasted pistachios meld perfectly with the seared scallops. Served this with the butternut squash risotto (also on this site), and it was a winner.
