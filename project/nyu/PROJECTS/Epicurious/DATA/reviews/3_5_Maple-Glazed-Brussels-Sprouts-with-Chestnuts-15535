Excellent recipe ! I wasn't convinced when I decided to make it but was ready to give it a shot. Well, we will have them for Christmas too! You need to boil the sprouts long enough in the maple syrup in order to let all the water evaporate and leave just the maple to glaze them. I added chopped almonds and hazelnuts that I had previously roasted. Just perfect !

Made this recipe last Thanksgiving and did not care for the sweetness of the maple syrup paired with the pungency of the Brussels sprouts. This year I'm going to look for a recipe that enhances, rather than attempts to mask, the natural flavor of my sprouts...

I always get asked for the recipe. So delicious.

This was really nice, except the sauce did not thicken. Not sure what happened there! I also substituted cashews for chestnuts, which was equally delicious.

I was warned that not everyone would like Brussels Sprouts at our Thanksgiving gathering this year, but this recipe made all the difference. Everyone raved about the flavor and the chestnuts added an interesting note for those unaccustomed to the taste. Will definitely make again, and have had requests for the recipe.

Fantastic. I ate the leftovers greedily for days! Like many other Epicurious reviewers I must confess to having made one change in this recipe. I had a butternut squash at home so I roasted it and added to the pan when I was glazing the other ingredients. It added color and flavor. My husband and I ate it with short-grained brown rice. Never has healthy tasted so great.

Good recipe for brussels sprouts (I, too had a few brussels sprouts-haters who cleaned their plates!). Definitely easier if you are able to buy already-peeled chestnuts. Trader Joe's is now selling them in their rice & grains section and I'll try it with those next time.

I started making this dish a few years ago for Thanksgiving. Now it's on our table every year for Thanksgiving, but I also make it as often as I can find the time. It does take some time to prepare that many brussels sprouts and prepare the chestnuts. I used to be able to find chestnuts already clean and in dry packages. That was so much easier! This year I had to buy them frozen; already roasted, but shells still on. Took me an hour just to shell and skin the chestnuts! My husband adores brussels sprouts this way, but so do most of my guests. They go particularly well with our Hanukah latkes dinner too! I probably use much less butter and maple syrup than called for since I usually make 3 lbs. of brussels sprouts at once and don't measure anything. I just cook the sprouts until they absorb the syrup. It always takes longer for that step than expected. Others who didn't like the results might not be cooking long enough.

A good way to serve Brussels sprouts to people who think they don't like them. The chestnuts are a great touch, but it's hard to fresh roast the chestnuts, peel and skin them, and at the same time do all that's required to prepare a multi-dish meal like Thanksgiving- fresh chestnuts taste better but do yourself a favor and use a good canned or bottled brand to make life a bit less hectic.

this dish tasted ok but looked grouse and the texture was not nice and I like brussel sprouts

we loved it! my husband hates brussel sprouts and couldn't stop eating it. the obvious reason is because it's more like candy than a more healthier prepared vegetable dish.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight, and, since I am near the end of a long week without a trip to the grocer's, I didn't have chestnuts. I made it without them, and I can say this recipe is delish! I didn't parboil the sprouts, just halved them and sauteed them in the butter until they were tender and pan-roast-y-looking, then swirled in the real maple syrup, salt and pepper at the end. It was a real treat! Since I'm low-carbing it, I will elminate all but about a tablespoon or two of the maple syrup, as there was a lot of sauce in my opinion. It should be more a glaze, 'cause it's so rich and good, rather than a "pool on your plate" sauce. Besides, I'm cheap, and good maple syrup is expensive and ought not be thrown around, willy-nilly (Gads, I sound like my Greatest Generation parents!). I recommend this recipe, even if you have folks who don't like sprouts coming for dinner.

I like brussells sprouts, and I liked this. The people who don't normally like them also liked these. A nice change, and a way to please everyone. The chestnuts make it worth repeating.

I was SO impressed with this recipe! I like brussels sprouts anyway, and thought this dish would go great with the maple glazed roast turkey recipe. I was concerned that my husband wouldn't like it because he's not fond of sweet mixed with savory flavors. His review? "This is the first time I've ever had brussel sprouts that I liked!" A definite hit at my house!! :-)

I made this recipe last year but substituted the chestnuts with roasted hazelnuts. It's the first time I have ever seen every single sprout disappear! My only disappointment was that the sauce never did thicken. Delicious anyway.

I too used walnuts and it was very tasty. I will be making this again.

If you don't like brussel sprouts, why make them? I found this recipe yuckie. After one taste the sprouts went in the garbage. I happen to like brussel sprouts and this killed all the flavor of the vegetable.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving, and have already received requests to make it again this year! Try substituting walnuts for the chestnuts...it's just as good, and a bit more rustic in flavor.

My Brussel Sprout hating friends like these sprouts. Any recipe that makes Brussel Sprouts palatable to the other half of the population (Brussel Sprout haters) is a keeper!
