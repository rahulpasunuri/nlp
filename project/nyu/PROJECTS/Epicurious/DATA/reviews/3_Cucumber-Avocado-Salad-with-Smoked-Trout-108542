What a shame that this recipe has probably been neglected for eight or nine years because the first review was negative! This was absolutely delicious. The balance of sweet, sour, salty and umami flavors was anything but boring. I've made it with smoked trout, smoked salmon and without fish as a side salad (great with regular salmon). I've never bothered with the cucumber peel (also used English cucumbers); I just dice the cucumber and avocado and make the sauce, mixing some lemon juice with the vinegar, honey and dill. It's especially delicious in hot weather.

This recipe was a bit avant garde for my taste. It might be nice as a small appetizer, but I would never serve it in large portions again. The flavors compliment eachother but after a few bites I was bored.
