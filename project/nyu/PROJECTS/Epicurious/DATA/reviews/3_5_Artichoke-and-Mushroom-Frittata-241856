Quick, easy and yummy! Used a pre-steamed artichoke, added sliced baked potato, fresh thyme, chive and marjoram. Paired with a simple salad with balsamic dressing and it was a satisfying light dinner.

I've made this recipe several times and it's been a hit every time, the flavors are really rich. When I make it as a main course, I add 2 more eggs and mix in crumbled cooked Italian sausage to give it a bit more weight.

Some people play music purely by the sheet music, and it sounds good. Others read the music and then embellish on a theme. I think you could say that is the basis of many classical music pieces. I fully enjoy seeing peoples variations. If you enjoy cooking you would too. Obviously if they vary the receipe that is the way they liked it best, and that IS their opinion that you are looking for.

Used five eggs and a half can of quartered artichoke hearts, drained. Fast, easy and delicious!

Delicious and interesting to make. My local gourmet deli did not have baby artichokes the day I needed them for this so I cut up and radically trimmed two regular chokes...This was so much work I decided to halve this recipe. I wasn't sure whether my skillet was oven-proof, so it helped that the oven time for this is a mere one minute...Made this with an unsuccessful arepa recipe from the New York Times (they turned out like Guatemalan potato latkes), but this one's a keeper.

I made this last night and it was delicious! I used jarred artichokes and added a couple spoonfuls of light garlic and herb cream cheese to the artichoke/mushroom mixture. Also, before I put it under the broiler I layered the top with fresh crab meat and sprinkle of cheese. SO GOOD!

Excellent. I cut the recipe in half, and of course added extra cheese. Very tasty!

This came out wonderfully! I used frozen artichokes and they were great!

Ever since seeing the picture in the magazine, I've wanted to make this frittata. So, when I saw baby artichokes ($$$$) at my local green market, I snapped them up although Whole Foods would've likely had them as well. Anyway, the frittata was quite good and I would make it again. Big BUT! But I won't go to all the trouble of buying and trimming down those expensive baby artichokes. I'll buy frozen ones next time. For those who said they had to cook them for longer or were still tough, you really do have to get down to the very light green inner leaves. And since everyone is having her say, I enjoy hearing about variations/additions to recipes, but I do want to read about the actual recipe from those who made it as printed.

Trader Joe's frequently carries baby artichokes, and very high quality frozen baby artichokes, as well. One still needs to trim the fresh ones significantly so no tough outer leaves remain. It's a pain in the neck, but worth the result.

This is excellent for a weekend breakfast or a quick supper meal. I made it also using marinated jarred artichokes, using some of the marinating liquid with the cooking oil. Delish!

I disagree, evh... FreshCope is doing us all a favor by taking the time out of his/her busy schedule to enlighten us lowly at-home cooks. FC is obviously the executive chef of a prestigious restaurant somewhere and yet, somehow, has time to "correct" the suggestions in a public forum. We should all be grateful. Thanks, FC! You should try to comment on every recipe.

Listen up, people. When you discuss your variations on a recipe, you are no longer discussing the recipe as given. Please do us all a favor and keep your variations and substitutions to yourself. Let us know whether the recipe works as is, not as you decided to make it. Thank you.

I don't think I'd make this again--not because of the flavor or difficulty in preparation, but because here on the east coast, the only baby artichokes are too big! I cooked them a lot longer than called for, but they were very tough. I did trim off the tops and remove quite a few outer leaves, but I needed to remove lots more. I may try this with canned/frozen artichokes, or with some other veggie.

A good brunch recipe. I used a shortcut---jarred artichokes--and one pan. First I sauted the artichokes, added the mushrooms, then added the egg mixture.

Seldome see baby artichokes in our markets. Did anyone use frozen or canned. Would think they'd be a bit woody.

I made this last night & thought it was delicious. I added about a 1/3 bag of frozen spinach, thawed & squeezed dry. Very easy to make. I, too, am not sure why the reviewer below thought it wasn't good.

Simple, hearty weeknight dinner. It was even good cold the next day. Don't know what happened with the vague naysaying review below, it seemed pretty foolproof to me.

I made this dish for a work function & it was very well received - I got lots of questions! I did, however, substitute Asparagus for the artichokes.

This was the worst recipe I have cooked in my life, I even wonder if the magazine tested before they added to the issue. I am not advanced cook but have some knowledge of cooking, follow the instructions as indicated in recipe, the frittata was uneatable.
