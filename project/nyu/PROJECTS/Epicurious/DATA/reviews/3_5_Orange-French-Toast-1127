This is delicious, but is inclined to burn when cooked in butter. This may be because the sugary OJ burns, as does the butter. Better to use a combination of cooking oil and butter, or just cooking oil. I liked this French toast with just a very thin layer of orange marmalade plus the maple syrup. The powdered sugar is absolutely great!

My husband made this for our christmas morning breakfast. He couldn't get the sogginess out of the center...quite icky. the orange flavor was great, perhaps not soaking it overnight would make this one work.

I made this over Thanksgiving weekend for house guests and it was great! I didn't get time to make it the night before so it sat for about an hour before I cooked it. It was nice and crispy on the outside and had good flavor.

I came across this while looking for recipes to use up the surplus of oranges on my backyard trees. And I was pleasantly surprised! Easy and very, very tasty. My guests loved it.

Excellent! We used texas toast, added some nutmeg and vanilla. Cook over medium heat, not high, or the outside will burn before the inside is cooked.

My father called this the best french toast he ever ate. I used challah and brioche and topped the toasts with sliced strawberries and powdered sugar. They really don't need syrup. Am wondering if other taste combinations would work well too.. maybe substitute frangelico for the orange liquor and sprinkle with nutmeg, or use some other fruit brandy?

I prepared this recipe on Christmas Eve and refrigerated it to cook on Christmas morning while opening our gifts. It was wonderful tasting and so easy! Real maple syrup adds just the right touch to this elegant breakfast.
