This recipe was easy and tasty. The secret is using a nice rich stock and great mushrooms. I added dried porcini and portabello mushrooms and used some of the liquid in the stock. The sourdough was nice, but you can use any other kind of bread. I would make this again.

If you read the recipe, no where does it state that the cooked bacon goes back into the dressing. Not sure if this is a typo, but I took it as one and added all the cooked bacon bits to the dressing...amazing flavor! My guests actually liked this dressing more than the bird and other side dishes. They also said it was better than any stuffing/dressing they'd had. And I agree that you need to get the 3 different varieties of mushrooms called for-it's worth the effort for the end product!

Very easy and savory recipe. Came out perfect first time I made it. A new Thanksgiving favorite!

My Neighbor, Nancy, raved about this recipe so much so, that she has made it 3 times in a two week period of time. I made this for a post-Christmas party and it is a definite KEEPER! One suggestion, make sure you locate the different variety of mushrooms-they clearly make the dish. It also takes more stock than you might think-but that adds to the goodness. Enjoy!

Yum! This dressing was a wild success. Made it along side a roast turkey breast and lamb for thanksgiving, everyone loved it. Very rich and flavorful. A new holiday staple.

I am not normally a fan of Bobby Flay's recipes but this one is fantastic. I will definitely make it again!

VERY good recipe! I was purposefully looking for a "stuffing" recipe where it was cooked separately b/c I'm pregnant and we're not supposed to eat stuffing that's cooked inside the turkey due to higher risk of bacteria, etc. EVERYONE raved about this recipe at our Thanksgiving dinner! I didn't have to make a single adjustment.

It was good. Paired well with the Porcini Mushroom Turkey I made but it wasn't "amazing" good like the rest of the meal. Made as directed.

The recipe had a great variety of flavors with the deep mushroom flavor from roasting to the smokiness and texture from the bacon. You will probably need additional stock. I used an additional 1 oz of dried porcini and used 1 cup of the juice from reconstituting the mushrooms.
