Love it! Super easy and delicious. Great for a weeknight dessert. Beware though, I ate half of it in one sitting!! Addictive! I reviewed it here on my blog at http://thekitchenbitch.wordpress.com/

So yummy! I found this recipe a few weeks ago and have already made it lots of times. It's a very popular weekend breakfast for all my family, and so quick to make too.

Delicious. Probably doesn't need the 20 minutes, more like 16-18.

Oh, my goodness, this is like eating funnelcake for breakfast, only not as greasy. It's quite delicious and berries are a good counterpoint to the extreme sweetness of the Nutella Sauce. There was plenty of sauce leftover (yummy as a topping for coffee ice cream sundaes!) I can also see this as an extremely easy alternative to dessert crepes -- with sliced strawberries, a dollop of whipped creme fraiche and a garnish of mint on the side.

This recipe was great. After eating it as written. I made some changes. I took the Nutella thinned with milk and added 2 oz of Contreau wisked in thoroughly. Then I lightly smashed up some pistachios and sprinkled on the Crespella before drizzling the now Nutella with Contreau. Was great with the texture of the nuts and the hint of orange in the Nutella.

The end product looks like it took a lot more work than actually required!

I made this for our four kids this morning as a special Valentine's treat. I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the result! My kids and husband really enjoyed it. I had mine with powdered sugar and strawberries as the Nutella is just a little too sweet for me. Really tasty, lovely presentation and very, very easy to prepare!

I added lemon extract, blue poppy seeds, and a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon instead of vanilla. I baked in two small cast iron pans, splitting the mixture; half into each. Baked up wonderfully!

This recipe is so easy and delicious! Presentation was impressive....a much better alternative to pancakes!

I don't have a 12in oven proof skillet so I decided to make this on the stove top kind of as crepes. They turned out excellent. I also added a little orange zest to the batter and then thinned out the Nutella with a little orange juice instead of the milk. My kids ate them as fast as I could make them. I will definitely make this again.

I have probably made this 20 times-just as written-as a brunch dish. terrific even without the Nutella sauce. My toddlers love it, too. Now, that's saying something!

Yum, yum, yum! My boyfriend and I both give this dessert rave reviews for it's not-too-sweet oven pancake and it's simplicity! I will definitely make this again...and again...and again.

This is a good and simple breakfast popover. I used the Loecker brand hazelnut-chocolate paste which is less sweet than Nutella and t worked really well. I will definitely make it again.

Definitely use real nutella. I used store-brand and it was disappointing. The recipe is good. I wouldn't say it is the most flavorful oven pancake recipe I've found. But the concept is good.

perfect when you want something sweet & don't want a whole cake/pie in the house! yum!

The best and most simple dessert I have ever made. I have made it often, and it gets raves every single time. Thank you, Melissa!

Excellent and easy (and impressive when it comes out of the oven). I'm not a Nutella fan, so I just make a simple dark chocolate sauce with it--not too sweet and very elegant.

don't know if I made this correctly but it was mostly flavorless except for the nutella sauce. better just to make crepes

Easy & pretty. Definitely requires strawberries or something to cut the sweet chocolate/eggy pancake combination.

Absolutely delicious, impressive and, best of all, very, very easy to put together. I usually have all of the ingredients in my cupboard already. I don't make desserts often, but this is a breeze and I can't wait to make it again.

So good and so easy! My four year old loved it! I think it tasted best after it had cooled off.

I haven't tried this yet, but it sounds so good. Maybe something to make at the cottage this summer. My only addition would be to add some orange zest to the batter.

I had a similar breakfast prepared at a B&B in Washington,LA. It was served with powdered sugar and lemon juice. I made this crispella this morning and served it with powdered sugar and the option of lemon juice or nutella. I sprayed the cast iron skillet thoroughly with Pam and preheated the pan as the oven warmed up. I also used the 2 Tbsp of butter in the recipe. It didn't stick at all. The outside was crispy and the inside was custardy and we all liked it very much. My ten year old voted to make it again.

this had a great flavor and was so easy to prepare in no time! i didn't have a skillet so i used a glass pan. It turned out pretty good to me. But I also experimented and made them on the stove top in a pan. Turned out like a crepe but still tasted great! I served one with honey and vanilla ice cream instead of nutella and that was pretty good. Nutella is much better though!

i already did it twice and it was excellent, and quick to prepare. I also added dulce de leche and it was great, it is a mix between a pancake and a crepe.

Rustic yet elegant!! Reminded us of an evening in Paris last summer. I doubled the recipe and baked in pie plates and ramekins. The batter was so watery, I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour. Next time,very soon, I will make a single recipe and follow the directions although ours turned out perfectly!!

Unfortunately, the crespelle stuck to my well-seasoned cast-iron skillet. The interior looked exactly like mashed potatoes and tasted eggy. I prefer the David Eyres pancake recipe published in the NY Times.

This was an exceptionally easy dish. The crespella was very light and not too sweet, which balanced well with the nutella. I followed the recipe exactly and did serve with fresh strawberries, which was delicious. Will definitely make again.

This was absolutely fabulous. Super easy and so good. Nutella is one of my favorites, and I love this idea for it...it's kind of like a big Nutella crepe...what's not to love?!

This was so easy and so delicious. I did exactly as per the instructions and it turned out great, though the nutella is for us lucky souls with a sweet tooth. I might try it again with a coulis and some fresh fruit for a lighter variation.
