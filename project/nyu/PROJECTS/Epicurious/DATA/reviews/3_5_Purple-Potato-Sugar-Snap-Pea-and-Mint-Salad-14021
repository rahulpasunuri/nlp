Yum! I used 1 1/2 tablespoons each of olive oil and vinegar, that seemed perfect. I also added pinenuts and shaved parmesan - next time will try feta. Loved this salad!

Quick & tasty! Healthy (I like), yet potato-ey (DH likes). What better combo for a weekday night! Since it's winter and I try to avoid foods that are too cooling (per Chinese medicine philosophy), I used fresh basil leaves instead of mint per another reviewer's recommendation. Like other reviewers, I had to increase the dressing amounts so it didn't get too dry. If you have flavored sea salts, this is a great dish to try it on. We tried our curry-flavored Sri Lankan sea salt on this and it added a nice little something-something. (Wonder if there's a typo where we should be using Tbsp instead of tsp to measure the olive oil and balsamic vinegar...

This is an amazing recipe! I double the recipe so I would have leftovers and I'm sure glad I did! I used top-notch olive oil and added a little more than the recipe called for, which was a good choice. I also added toasted pine nuts and feta cheese. It was wonderful! I'd definitely make this again :)

I added roasted pine nuts and feta to this recipe. The flavors were delicious, but it was a bit dry. I would recommend increasing the olive oil by one-half to one tablespoon.

It wasn't bad, but I wasn't impressed. I used good balsamic vinegar and olive oil, and peas and mint fresh from my garden, too. Maybe it just needed time for the flavors to meld (I served it immediately), or maybe the feta is a necessity. I'll give it a second chance with those modifications, since it is so easy to make.

This was exceptionally good--3.5 forks, if there was such a thing. I was surprised that these ingredients combined to make something so tasty. I made with the scallops and it was a great accompaniment. I will definitely make again when I want to do a potato salad.

the balsamic vinegar and mint are a surprisingly good combination, especially with the sweetness of the sugar snap peas. i'll certainly make it again, and i'll try it with feta, as suggested below.

I was so glad that this side dish was recommended with the rosemary scallops. Easy and quick to make and I did add a small amount of feta cheese as recommended by Karen. I will make again and again.

Made this last night. Used snow peas and fresh basil in place of the sugar snaps and mint. Was very tasty and such a pretty presentation. A very big hit and will be an often repeated item in our house.

This salad nicely accompanies fish. I replaced the snap peas with green beens and it was absolutely delicious. It is also extremely easy to make. I highly recommend it.
