This is yummy and easy to make. A little too garlic-y for my taste, but it was a crowd-pleaser.

This was delicious..I used baguette slices and added roasted red pepper pieces to the top to give it some more color. It would also make a great dip if you don't want to take the trouble to spread the paste on all the slices. Very quick, easy hors d'oeuvres.

This recipe is a good base, but I think you should add extra herbs to make it your own. I added more garlic and lemon juice, salt, pepper, and oregano...THEN it was tasty.

I modified this recipe substantially, using about 5 times as much garlic (some roasted, some not). I accidentally added all the olive oil to the bean mixture, so I thickened it by adding 1/2 the walnuts & processing it all together. I also added some cumin, paprika & cardamom, a little fresh sage and at *least* 4 raw garlic cloves. I then brushed each slice w/ a little olive oil, spread a very thin layer of the mushed roasted garlic, then spread a thick layer of the bean mixture & sprinkled walnuts on top. Baked that for about 12 minutes, then added thinly shaved good-quality parmesean. Stuck it back in the oven (w/ heat turned off) to slightly warm & melt the parm a little. So basically it became a different recipe, but they were VERY VERY DELICIOUS. Good luck beans for New Year's Day.

I gave this only 2 forks since I know better bruschetta recipes. However, this was good, and it disappeared quickly. Even my Italian guests thought I made it "just like Italy". I made the toast in a more traditional way, brushing with olive oil before baking, then rubbing garlic on the toast slices. Also, I heated the beans, then mashed the beans, garlic, lemon juice rather than process the ingredients, because that is how I learned to make a similar bruschetta when living in Rome. The presentation was a bit more rustic, but I think more pleasing. I tried it with toasted pine nuts, and then worked well too I thought.

a bit too bland for my taste, especially when eaten with the bruschetta, and i didn't think the walnuts made a difference. but i added salt and served it the next night with chips and it was pretty good.

Like the others, I thought this was a delicious and simple dish. I recommend however making sure that your "2 cloves of garlic" are not that big, or the garlic might overpower the simplicity of the other flavors and give you dragon's breath for the rest of the evening. I placed the bean mixture in a bowl, made a well in the center for some extra-virgin olive oil and then sprinkled the walnuts on top. It was a beautiful presentation.

A very well recieved and easy to make little dish. I also prefered the paste on the second day.

Very good; very easy. I think the bean spread tastes better the next day. Next time I'll make the spread a day in advance.

I thought it was too mild when I tasted the white bean dip by itself. The end it up with walnuts and olive oil, bruschetta was absolutely delicious!! I think I'll make it again.

The walnuts really make this dish. Don't add too much garlic--I tried using an extra clove and it was too overwhelming.

This bruschetta was scrumptious. Such simple ingredients, but a really innovative combination.

I took a risk and made this recipe for the first time for a party at my home. I was delighted with the outcome, and so were my guests. The only addition I made was a dash of salt.
