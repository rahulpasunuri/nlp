"One serving with leftovers"? You're kidding. We got 4 servings and had more leftovers. I also noticed that leftovers tasted much more bitter than fresh-cooked. Hereafter would only make enough for the meal at hand. Followed the recipe as written, with wine vinegar,except had no red onion so used yellow. Probably wouldn't make it again.

Made this exactly as stated, except that I only boiled the kale for 5 minutes, as other reviewers suggested. Excellent dish, will definitely be making again!

This was an amazing yet easy way to prepare kale. It was my first time cooking kale, and instead of boiling it, I steamed it first for about 10 min. The first time I made it, I used the red wine vinegar, and it was great, but today I substituted with some fresh squeezed lemon juice instead and it gives it such a refreshing taste!

This was the first time I made kale and will definitely make this again. Very easy to make and delicious. I served this with hamburgers and gravy and it make a quick, delicious meal.

So simple and flavourful, this is one of my favourite ways to prepare kale. I doubled the garlic and halved the boiling time for the kale and still think it was a bit overdone. Next time I will just blanch it. It was delicious.

Yum! Substituted raspberry balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar. I also inadvertently mixed in some black beans when it was on my plate - and it made a really nice combination.

I joined a CSA this year and so have been receiving lots of greens with which I've not cooked before. I was very wary of the red kale I received but this recipe made a convert. Delicious! And so healthy. Like other reviewers I boiled the kale for just five minutes. This recipe has even convinced me to buy kale on my own in the future. Thank you Epicurious!

Delicious recipe that's worth saving and making again. I used springy, young kale, so five minutes of boiling was plenty. Also, I added diced mushrooms to the onion saute and thought they went beautifully. The last-minute addition of good-quality balsamic vinegar transformed the dish into something really special.

Excellent. The vinegar and onions are just wonderful. I love that no one tried to fatten it up with bacon or pancetta (although I'm sure that would be da bomb!)My green-veggie-hating father took a look at what I was making and actually said,"Do you think I'll actually eat that?" ...and he did!

I've made this recipe a few times now - a hit every time! As other people have noted, 5 minutes is plenty for the kale in the boiling water. also, sprinkling sunflower seeds on top is tasty. I plan to use sesame oil next time. Soy sauce instead of vinegar, too!

Wonderful! I used red kale, sherry vinegar and tossed in toasted pine nuts. I only cooked the kale 5 mins. before draining. I'm headed back to the store for more kale!

Only after I made this did I notice that this was intended to make ONE serving! Leftovers? I think not! Very tasty way to make kale, the onions are a nice touch, and as others suggested, I tossed in some chopped walnuts, and used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine. The kale was quite tender after just 5 minutes in boiling water, incidentally.

Pretty good. I liked the hot pepper kick and next time will try with walnuts and some bacon.

Loved this! Followed recipe & added walnuts. Served w/ baked salmon & roasted sweet potatoes. Wonder about the boiling- don't usually like to boil my veggies(washes out nutrients) but I think kale is a special case.

I'd never eaten kale before, and found this unbelievably delicious. I added lots of chopped walnuts to the pepper flakes and garlic when I put them in the pan.

I make this recipe frequently, adding/subtracting various seasonings, but with one additional ingredient: I slice a small/med-sized ripe tomato into the onion/garlic saute -- it caramelizes them and adds a savory flavor to the finished -- yummm!!!

I have made this a handful of times. It is easy, simple and healthy. Occasionally I'll use shallots which are nice and mellow. Also nice with a bit of bacon :)

I give it 4 forks and I didn't even trouble with the onion. It really is the best way to cook kale, imho.

This is a tasty recipe as is (I've made it before), but I just took it over the top. I used my stovetop smoker to smoke a sliced sweet onion. Then, I diced it and sauteed it, finishing the recipe according to the directions (except I did use balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar). This really took it over the top! It was a bit of trouble to smoke the onion, but it took it from good to most outstanding. If you have a stovetop smoker, give it a try!

This was so good! It nearly melts in your mouth. I used balsamic vinegar instead of red, because I was serving it with salmon that had a balsamic-honey glaze. Other than that, I followed it exactly.

Yum. I've made this twice. The first time I doubled the recipe and din't add too many red pepper flakes. The second time, I made it straight and added lots more pepper flakes. Fabulous both times. Even my children asked for more and were disappointed when the pan was empty.

Great healthy side dish. I added roasted sweet potato. It received two thumbs up from my kids.

The great thing about this dish is that it's unexpected yet very easy. I substituted a small yellow onion, which worked just fine. Modifications would be very easy to add, such as toasted walnuts or dried fruit (i.e. currants or cherries). A different vinegar would also be a nice touch. Definitely a repeat in our home!

This is a good basic recipe for kale, which I make all the time. I used one shallot instead of the red onion and it was fine. The vinegar adds a nice fruity taste.I served it with chicken soup for a healthy weeknight dinner. Look for other recipes; I usually saute garlic, onion, and anchovy paste with rosemary then add kale and red hot peppers. Really deep and rich.

Quick, easy and tasty. Tried balsamic instead of red wine vinegar, which better suited our main course and it turned out great. We get a lot of kale in our CSA box, and this is probably the best and easiest recipe for a simple side dish that I've found.

Rating: 2
Very dissappointed considering all the positive reviews. Made the mistake of not boiling first as many reveiws said the step could be skipped. As a result, it took a lot longer to saute, throwing my meal serving time off by 10 minutes. Plenty was leftover and not one positve respone, no complaints either. Oerall just ok.

I really enjoyed this simple, yet tasty Kale recipe. The vinegar adds something to the greens that make this delicious. I've now made this twice, one with kale from a bag, and once with kale from the farmer's market. I wouldn't necessarily recommend the stuff from the bag for this recipe, as Kale is too much of a "star".

Rating: 3
Healthy and simple to prepare! Next time I'll use a bigger pinch of pepper flakes to give it more of a spicy punch, or I'll try it with balsamic vinegar instead of red-wine vinegar, which I think will complement the taste of the kale better.

I love kale (and all leafy greens, really) and prepare it this way, but without the vinegar, often. I have varied it with or without onions, mushrooms, garlic, red pepper flakes, etc. and it's always a standby fall side dish. Kinda funny to see something I make regularly as a recipe here.

My boyfriend and I were both kale 'virgins' before I tried this recipe. This was a perfect side, the mild flavor of kale was jazzed up with onion and vinegar. Plus, it's so pretty! Definitely making this one again.

I have been a fan of epicurious for a wile now and have not left a review...until now. I had kale from a CSA I had no idea what to do with. So I sauteed (did not boil), used everything according to the recipe except no red pepper flakes. But I strongly recommend trying it with walnuts. The nutty flavor goes so well with the frangrant olive oil and flavorful kale- no bitterness what-so-ever. So delicious.

This is a great side dish. Made it a few days ago and just came back for the recipe becuase I'm making it for a dinner party this weekend. Different and delicious. By the way, the first time I made it I used Balsamic vinegar and vidalia onion and it came out great.

This is my first real experience with kale and I loved it! What a pleasant surprise. It was juicy and flavourful and delicious. Not at all bitter like I expected. I plan to keep it around as a staple veg after this experience. Oh we used balsamic vinegar cause we were out of red wine and it was just fine.

I have yet to try this recipe as written, because we didn't have enough kale. Never mind: I've been avoiding kale for years because I didn't know about parboiling it first. I added a whole mess of stuff to fill our plates - cabbage, sausage, feta, red bell pepper, pine nuts, garlic. Next time I'll buy more kale and follow the recipe.

I have cooked and served kale to friends and family for years. Some helpful tips re kale: use lacinato kale, skip the blanching step and saute directly in olive oil, garlic and red pepper flakes; and use a mild vinegar (i.e., rice vinegar).

Delicious! Kale has wonderful texture, so it can nicely complement softer dishes in a way spinach cannot. Like many who reviewed this recipe, I generally prefer balsamic vinegar, but for this dish, I recommend the comparatively subtle red wine vinegar. It doesn't smother the kale's natural flavor, and it works well with the red pepper flakes.

We tried this last night (due to no spinach available) and really enjoyed it. This was our first time to eat kale. It is more substantial than spinach and had a nice fresh flavor. I also used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine and thought it was really good. The red pepper flakes add just enough kick. It really cooks down so if you want enough for two people or leftovers you might make extra.

We had some kale delivered so had to find a recipe that could be made with other ingredients already on hand. We have never had kale before. This was ok, not exciting, altho I think nice enough if you are already a 'greens' fan. We won't make it again though; my husband wouldn't finish his serving. I used balsalmic vinegar b/c we like it better than red wine vinegar. Next time I might try one of the recipes for kale & bacon. And this generously served two of us.

I grow kale in my summer garden and this is recipe is simple, fast, and very easy to modify very simply for a delicious and healthful side dish. You don't need to waste time boiling or steaming the kale first. Just toss right into the pan, and it's cooked in minutes.

Four forks if you like cooked greens. Just like Grandma used to make. Perfect just the way it is, no changes. Although, I would say the red pepper is optional depending on how you are feeling.

i am not one to really do much experimenting with veggies, but... it was yummy! they say this makes one serving with leftovers, i would say it is enough for two people that aren't big veggie eaters. here's what i did with it: i served it on top of some mixed wild rice and topped it off with some raisins and parmesan cheese. i also used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. i think it is a great main vegetarian dinner option or could be a great option for a side to a pork chop perhaps.

I would certainly make this again. The kale is delicious this way...but I must confess that I overdid it on the red pepper flakes because I forgot that I was using half the amt of kale. I had purchased it for another recipe that also had potatoes just before my husband told me he was going back to the induction phase of the low carb diet! Not wanting to waste the kale I found this recipe and love the taste of the kale...but now it is too hot and I'm hoping it will keep a day or so 'til I get an equivalent amount and make it without the pepper flakes and mix them together! Does anyone know how this might freeze? Sort of defeats the idea of a nice healthy fresh and easy green, but sometimes....

Great side dish. However, in the interest of full disclosure, I simplified the recipe and it was still terrific. No boiling of the Kale in advance and no onion. Simply wash and clean the Kale (break off all the tough stems and, for those that still seem a little tough, separate the leaf from the stem and discard stems; its very quick). Sautee garlic and red pepper in O.Oil. Throw in Kale. Add a little chicken stock/water, not that much, and cook for awhile. Salt and pepper. Couldn't be easier and is terrific. Vinegar/lemon juice adds to recipe. Even threw in a can of rinsed Cannelini beans.
