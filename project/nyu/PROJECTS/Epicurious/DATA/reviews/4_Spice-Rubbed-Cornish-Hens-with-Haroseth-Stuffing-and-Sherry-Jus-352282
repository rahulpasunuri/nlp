Made this for a second time for a dinner party--I only cooked the hens 35 mins and that was plenty--you really just have to use a meat thermometer, but cornish hens are fatty enough that they are quite forgiving. Didn't have dried dates so used a mix of dried prunes and dried blueberries. Still great!

Very nice flavor combinations! I will definitely make this again. I had already made date, apple, and almond haroseth so I used that instead. It worked nicely. Next year, I'll be making this haroseth so I can try the recipe as is.

Not surprisingly, the stuffing tastes a lot like fruitcake. The spice rub adds subtle flavor and a beautiful color to the bird. I didn't think the sauce brought much added flavor to the party, so I wouldn't bother putting in the effort (unless you're willing to tweak it). I hate recipes with vague cook times like 'until the juices run clear'. Cook the birds until a probe thermometer in the thickest part of the thigh reads 170 degrees.

Everything about this dish is delicious, including the Apricot/Date/Pistachio stuffing. Prep isn't very complicated or time-consuming, so that's great. I didn't use any cayenne (there were spice-sensitive kids at dinner), and everything still had tons of flavor. Skipped the Jus, but basting the hens a few times during cooking kept them very tender. The Mint Salsa Verde was garlicky and superb- a perfect balance to the sweetness of the stuffing.

I wish I could give this recipe more than 4 forks! I made this for dinner, and used one whole chicken. Injecting the sauce between the skin and meat definitely made a huge difference; the meat was so moist and flavorful. I did have a problem with not having enough juices to baste the chicken with. But I simply added more oil, a little water, and sherry, and it worked out well. I basted the chicken 3 times before removing it from the oven. I added sliced potatoes around the chicken in the baking dish. These came out incredibly tasty as well. I changed the Haroseth slightly and used walnuts instead of pistachios.

Wow - this was a hit! The hens turned out beautiful, tasted wonderful, and the dish was pretty easy to make overall. I made the stuffing a day ahead (and, yes - it is very good with Manchego cheese). I wish I'd prepped the hens the night before to save a little hassle the day of dinner. We served this for Easter & everyone wants to have it again! The sauce and the salsa verde were both great as well. I'm not typically a recipe follower - but this one works!

Amazing. There was nothing overly complicated about this. I don't have much input now, as I made it at Christmas and don't remember much beyond loving it.

To Taravat. For making this with turkey just increase the batch of the Haroseth to fit the bird and make extra to roast, wrapped in foil, as you would any other stuffing. Just make sure to use a good stock to moisten it. Trim all the fatty crap from the turkey and render it down over low heat and add some of the fat to the dressing to give that turkey flavour to what is now a dressing. Voila, You are a genius to your friends and family. An alternative is to use quail. Bone them out (Not hard to do. Just give them a quick, gentle, crush with the heel of your hand on a board and use your fingers to work between the meat and the bones. Use a knife only to separate the thigh and wing joints from the carcass) then stuff. 30 in an oven on 2 levels can be handled. Roast no more than 30 minutes. Baste at least twice with a mixture of your favourite wine mixed with mango juice and a touch of soy sauce Makes a great appetizer for the adults as well as a nice meal for the kids. Try it, you might hate it

This dish looks awesome, and with a few, minor, changes to suit my personal tastes, will definately be a memorable addition to many, great, family feasts. They're gonna' love this!

I'm having 30 for the Seder (16 adults/14 kids). There will not be enough space to do this recipe with hens. Has anyone tried it with a turkey? And...if so....results? Suggestions? Any suggestions to another recipe (not meat - as my mother is doing that for the first seder) that is good for a very large group? We will be serving the main buffet style...

The multiple flavors (rub spices, haroset, salsa verde) in this recipe were divine together. Not only was the dish mouthwateringly good, it was gorgeous on the plate with the dark skin of the hens against the bright green of the salsa verde. Made the Sherry Jus with the minimal pan scrapings at the end of roasting. (Although, the dish was fine without it.) Did not have any juices to baste with after the first 20 minutes though. Reviewer "Vzlangrl" - How did you get pan juices?

I am a personal chef/assistant and I made this for passover. It was a huge hit! I followed the recipe (which I never do) and it was awsome. I am not Jewish and would still could this over and over again. If your hens smokes you cooked it to close and if you didn't have jus not enough olive oil! this is a repeat!

I am a personal chef/assistant and I made this for passover for the family. I followed the recipe to a tee which I never do and it turned out awsome! I had no smoking in the kitchen made the jus and it was a huge hit! I did use a little bit different of a verde salsa but all in all a repeat dinner!

I followed the recipe to the letter and it was a big hit at dinner. My whitemeat-only fiancee didn't leave a single nibble on the carcass. I really like the accent that the salsa (really a chimichurri) gave to the dish. It cut through the sweetness of the stuffing a bit.

I used large free range chickens. Basted then for 24 hours before. Drizzled some olive oil over and cooked as per recipe. No need for a sherry jus at the end. was simply delicious

Made for Passover 2010. Not difficult (a big win when one is busy preparing for a holiday!). The stuffing was wonderful and we had more with the meal. The entire house got very smoky roasting the game hens at 425. No drippings for the sauce but scraped up the stuff on the bottom of the pan and made a sauce. Couldn't find unsalted pistacios; substituted walnutes.

Overall, I liked this recipe. The combination of the bird with the stuffing was delightful. However, I did not get any drippings and so could not make the sauce. Any theories on the lack of drippings? This was my first time cooking a bird this way and I would like to know what I did wrong for the next time I make it.

This was incredible. I couldn't find pistacios in the store so substituted walnuts. I think the pistacios would have been better, so will really look harder next time. And used a whole chicken instead of cornish hens. It came out beautiful, delicious, and full of really intriguing flavors. I've raved to my friends about it. Definitely will make it again!

I made this dish last night for my husband's birthday dinner. I used a roasting hen. It was wonderful. He raved about it. It's going into my recipe file. I didn't make the salsa as he wouldn't have liked that dish.

We couldn't find Cornish hens so we used 2 small organic chickens. This was very good, but the skin was a problem. We would make it again, but would only do it with the Cornish Hens

This dish is simply amazing! I had never cooked cornish hens before. I am a personal cook and my clients asked for it so I followed this recipe step by step (well, with one exception; I used walnuts only instead of almonds and pistaccios-- just had a ton of delicious toasted almonds at hand) and it was a BIG successs. The stuffing is heavenly and the flavors of the rub mouth watering. My cornish hens were moist and savory and turned out just like the ones in the picture. Basting every 10 minutes, per the recipe, is the key!

I didn't have game hens, so I used the rub over chicken and it was wonderful. My husband raved about it. I served it with sauteed radishes and fresh corn on the cob. It was a great meal. Will try using game hens next time. A winner recipe!

I think I am the first review who is not jewish but I really liked the ingredients. It was delicious. I did not make the stuffing but put a 1/4 of a navel orange in the cavity of the cornish hens. I also added some orange juice to the sauce which was a big hit.

I planned to make this for 8 for passover. Cornish hens were too expensive, so I made it with roast chicken, which I stuffed right before putting it in the oven. It was fantastic! Highly recommended.

Wow! I made this as written except I halved it. This is a wonderful recipe. We all loved it! The rice is also great. It makes me want to look at some middle eastern cookbooks.

Made this last night for Passover along with the parsley mint salsa verde, saffron rice pilaf and orange flan for dessert. Absolutely fabulous! Moist, flavorful birds (I stuffed them with the haroses) and the salsa was a perfect complement to counterract the sweetness of the stuffing. We had 10 for dinner so I cooked 7 birds. No need to double the stuffing (it was just enough) although I did have to double the spice rub for the birds. I started them at 450 per the recipe for 20 minutes. Then covered the wingtips and leg tips with foil, reduced the temp to 350 and continued cooking for 15 minutes more, basting every 10. They were perfect, tender, juicy and flavorful. Everyone raved. Didn't make the gravy--too much else going on, will try that next time.

This was easy, and I thought it was incredibly delicious--moist, flavorful, almost haunting combination of spices. I dreamed about it after having eaten it. We did make the salsa verde to go with it, and that was very tasty as well, but not a must in my opinion.
