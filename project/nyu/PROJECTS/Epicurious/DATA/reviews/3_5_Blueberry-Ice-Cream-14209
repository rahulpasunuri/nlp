Based on other reviews I decided to make this as a custard based ice cream. I used 5 egg yolks, a tsp of vanilla, and an additional 1/2 cup of sugar in the custard base. I cooked the blueberries as directed in the recipe, but brought them to room temperature before adding them to the custard base. I added the blueberry pulp in addition to the juice. The result was a wonderfully smooth and creamy (and purple!) ice cream with bits of tart blueberry. Delicious!

I reworked this a bit after reading some of the reviews results were a very smooth icecream with good bery flavor, great texture. And Lactose free. 2 cups fresh blueberry picked over 1 1/4 cups sugar (note sugar demand is dependant on the berries and how long they are cooked. longer cooking brings out a bit more bitterness from the skins. 2 T mexican vanilla. Dash salt. 2 cups heavy cream 1.5 cups Lactaid or other 2 % Lactase fortified milk 1/2 cup marscapone cheese. Cook the sugar water salt and berry together to pop. Strain through seive and mash skins to get out the juce. Scare the exit side of the sieve to get the pulp. The objective is to have no skins and minimal seeds. Chill over night with the freezer section of you freezer. Next day the pulp will rise and congeal a bit with the pectin blend the berry juice and pulp back together with the cream and vanilla. Set up thhe freezer and put this mix in and start it. Beat the marscapone in the bowl you just emptied with the milk bit by bit until smooth and add this to the machine also (of course everything should be cold. 35 min in my cuisinart was pure blue heaven.

A perfect way to use some of the fresh blueberries we picked on a hot summer morning. Like most others, I didn't strain the blueberries. No need. Simple and delicious.

This is not a great recipe. Since it is not custard based, it taste's like a cross between sorbet and ice cream. Texture is terrible. I'll try some other recipe next time.

This ice cream is way too rich! Mine is a beautiful color, but it tastes like butter. (actually, it may be butter - I made it yesterday and it was 95 degrees outside. I don't have A/C and it was probably in the mid 80's inside my apartment. After 1/2 hour in the Cuisinart ice cream machine, it was still partially liquid and didn't seem to be getting more frozen, so I went ahead and put it in the freezer.) Maybe those paddles were starting to turn the cream into butter! Everyone likes it but me.....

The flavor of this ice cream is amazing. Yes, the consistency is not that of custard-based versions, but on a hot summer day, who wants to stand over a stove? Output far exceeds input. And my toddler loves it.

eh. i have high standards for ice cream. this is ice milk, not ice cream. it's a straightforward recipe that takes, maybe, 10 minutes to make. i DID strain the berries -- wasn't hard, and will improve the iciness problem, but not solve it. good flavor, strange color, fair to poor texture compared to a custard-based ice cream. for what it is, it's not bad, but i would probably make an egg-custard based ice cream if i felt the need for more frozen blueberry treats.

What an amazing recipe, I accidently left the ice cream in the machine too long and it developed a wonderful airy texture. I didn't sieve the mixture and I added a little cognac right at the end of the simmering which added a nice little twist to it. I will definitely make again.

This is an update of my review from two years ago. I have made this recipe many, many times and it is the recipe I use for wild blackberries, wild wineberries, and raspberries. Over the years I've made a few changes. I use about 1/2 to 1 cup extra berries....more intense flavor. I do not strain the blueberries, but I do strain the blackberries and wineberries as they have too many seeds. Straining raspberries which have tinier seeds is optional. I add 1 Tbsps Grey Goose vodka to prevent the ice cream from hardening too much if it gets the rare chance to remain in my freezer for a long time. I use a different proportion of cream: 1 1/4 cups milk to 1 1/4 cups heavy cream. Since I always have skim milk in my refrigerator I sometimes use that instead of whole milk, in which case I may or may not increase the proportion of heavy cream. I always use heavy cream that has no additives, in this area that would be the Garelick Farms brand (use it quickly as it does not keep for long in the refrigerator).

All homemade icecream is good, lets face it, but this recipe, although the easiest I've ever seen, does not have a great texture. There are better (albeit harder) recipes out there.

The texture says egg custard, the ingredients merely say lots of cream. Great flavor, and the texture is wonderful with the skins. Don't strain it!

When we first got our ice cream maker, we always used an ice cream cookbook with recipes calling for eggs and cooking the cream and whatever. Since I found this blueberry ice cream recipe and a few others in Gourmet, I always go with these far simpler approaches. This one is a real stand-out - and I don't strain the berries either.

This was very easy and quite delish. I made this for a dinner party and it was a big hit. Tied with the chocolate chili ice cream as best of the night.

I'm not a big fruit ice cream person, but this was excellent. We also did not strain out the skins. Kids and adults as well loved it and I sent home 3 moms and 1 dad with the recipe!

I've made both the blueberry ice creams found on this website (the other one includes Gran Marnier)and this one is the winner. Now I've made it twice. I wouldn't change a thing except that I did not strain the mixture in any recipe. WHY would you want to?? This is a simple, pure ice cream.

I used to hate blueberries, but now that I like them, I decided to make this ice cream because we had lots of blueberries. It was a surprise and everybody loved it. I added about half a cup of whole blueberries after the ice cream was mostly frozen and I didn't use an ice cream maker. Instead, I put he mixture in a bowl and stuck it in the freezer, stirring it every 30 minutes and covering it with plastic when it was done. Yummy!

Yum! I went blueberry picking today and picked way more than I needed. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. I couldn't believe how smooth and creamy the ice cream tasted-without any egg yolks. Four forks for taste and the easy preparation.

Perfect summer treat, and so simple even I can make it! I botched the recipe, adding all the ingredients before cooking, and with only half the sugar, and still it turned out great. I, too, left the pulp in. Why lose that home-made touch? I got raves from kids and adults alike. What a yummy way to use blueberries - way easier than pie and a lot more fun.

This was very simple, and I appreciated that it called for only a few ingredients, all of which I had on hand. I use a Donvier ice cream freezer, and the size of the recipe was perfect for that (it holds a quart). Nice flavor, not my favorite thing ever-my partner, who is a huge blueberry fan, absolutely loved it.

Ahhh. Mmmmm. So easy. So delicious. I didn't have whole milk and used skim with no discernible loss of taste or texture. And such a delicious color to the finished product, too!

Absolutely awesome. One of those simple but perfect recipes. I followed the recipe exactly and the result was wonderful. I've made it with both cultivated and wild Maine blueberries. The version made with the wild berries was a little more flavorful.

WOW! I THOUGHT THIS WAS GREAT, I ONLY WISH I HAD AN ICE CREAM MAKER BIGGER THAN 1/2 PT... I DID USE BUTTERMILK FOR VARIETY. IT HAD A NICE TANG! I CANT WAIT TIL BLUBERRIES ARE BACK IN SEASON.

Not only is this absolutely delicious, but making it is truly (not to get too weird here) an experience that captures an essence of the joy of cooking. I'm talking specifically about when you strain it to remove the blueberry skins - what emerges on the other side is so satsifyingly smooth, not to mention the most incredibly gorgeous color. I wish I could give it a 10 fork review. To the "novice blueberry cook," just mash your berries with more force, with a potato masher instead of a fork. That should do the trick.

Very nice fresh blueberry taste. Perfect wayto use up summer berries

This recipe was easy to make and had great taste,texture and color. I used all half & half which worked out fine and probably saved some calories and fat. Next time I want to experiment by putting some fresh mint in with the berries and sugar, and then straining it out. The suggestion, by a previous reviewer, to add a splash of fresh lemon juice also sounds good. I read another blueberry ice cream recipe that included fresh lemon juice, so I am sure it would work.

I really didn't care for this ice cream. I thought that the flavor was kind of strange which was surprising since the ingredients are so pure and simple. I love blueberries so I was disappointed. I love strawberries and love strawberry ice cream so I thought that I would also like this. It could be that I like my blueberries tart and the ice cream is sweet (as it should be) My husband liked it. The texture was great and was very smooth and creamy.

I made it with frozen blueberries, because fresh ones were way too expensive at the time I was making it. It still turned out awesome! It tasted intensely of the berries, but still was very rich and creamy. Excellent recipe, and really easy!

My family loved this....real blueberry....they licked the bowl! I did wonder however if it might not benefit with a quick squeeze of lemon juice....next time.

Perhaps I am a novice blueberry cook...Either my blueberries didn't have enough juice to bring the fruit mixture to a boil, or I didn't mash them enough. I ruined the this recipe by trying to save the fruit mixture with water. Anyone have some advice as to what I may have done wrong? I tried the other blueberry ice cream recipe on epicurious, and that one came out great, I think because it calls for some water with the fruit.

If you grow your own blueberries like I do this ice cream is the best one I have ever eaten.

This is just the best blueberry ice cream. I couldn't make enough of it for my kids and neighbors last year.
