Boring. I even added carrots, snow peas and bok choy.

This has become my go-to stir fry sauce template. I don't have the dried mushrooms on hand so I use chicken stock instead, and use various vegetables in the stir fry (tonight it was onion, carrot, celery, red pepper, snow peas,bok choy, asparagus. Can use beef or chicken instead of shrimp. Very tasty.

This was my first recipe using fermented black beans - I got my first packet this week. I didn't have shrimp, so I made this with chicken, used mirin instead of sherry, and at the end, added some szechuan peppercorns. It was outstanding. I'm going to try this with pork next, but lobster is also a great idea.

I used fresh lobster instead of shrimp and fresh mushrooms and vegetable broth instead of dried. The result was absolutely delicious.

I made this exactly as written. It was pleasant, but needed a lot more spice for my tastes. Of course a lot of that has to do with the pepper you use; I just wish I hadn't deseeded mine, and had used more.

I am quite surprised at the reviews that said this was bland. I used dry salted black beans as recipe called for not black bean sauce and it was delicious. The only thing I am going to try next time is to add an additional tablespoon of the black beans and less ginger and garlic as I prefer the taste of the black beans and oyster sauce over that of the ginger and garlic.

I didn't have white wine so I used sake instead and I added carrots and peas for flavor. I put it all over soba noodles for a healthy option. One word: delicious. My husband and children loved it.

At last I've found an authentic black bean sauce. I can't stop making it! It's great over clams, as well. Steam the clams open first, set aside, and substitute the clam juice for the mushroom water. Also, in a stir fry with chinese pea pods, tofu, and black mushrooms. Be careful not to add too much sherry. It alters the taste dramatically with even slight overusage. This one is the real deal.

This is my new favorite recipe. Tried it the first time with prepared black bean sauce and found it overly salty and metallic. Gave it another try with the called-for fermented black beans and it was just terrific. I simply don't understand those who said it was bland and tasteless. I find myself craving this and have been making it exactly as written, except for more heat, about twice a month for the past three months. Simple to prepare (but a lot of bowls to wash) and very, very tasty.

I just made this tonight and was disappointed. I used a ready-made black bean sauce and everything else the same. It was kind-of bland with no distinctive taste. Oh well.

Very good. I also used prepared black bean sauce, 3 Tbsp, and 1/2 head chinese cabbage, stir fried after I removed the shrimp.

This is a simple and tasty recipe. Take Grand Rapids suggestion and double the recipe if it's your main course.

Bland and uninteresting. Followed the directions exactly (used fermented blk beans). Not worth the outcome.

This is one of my all time favorite recipes. I have always substituted a high quality black bean sauce which is easier to find than the salted black beans. Don't be put off by the sound of oyster sauce (I know that didn't sound good to some of my friends!). The fragrance of the ginger, garlic, etc. is divine.
