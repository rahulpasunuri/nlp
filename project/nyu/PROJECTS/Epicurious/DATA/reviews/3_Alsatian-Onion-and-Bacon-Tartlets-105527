Easy, tasty and simple to enhance with more flavor. I substituded panchetta for more flavor. Easy to cut into quarters for appetizers on a buffet.

Delicious and an all-around tasty dish, especially for a brunch. I used this recipe for one of the dishes at my wedding and got rave reviews about it.

Very nice tart, dough is especially lovely. I used this dough to make the goat cheese tomato onion tart that is also on this website. It turned out flaky, and the flavor is nice. Made this for a large number of people and everyone liked it.

bland. Needs cheese or something to liven it up.
