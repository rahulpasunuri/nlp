Okay I admit to using a purchased pie crust but did every thing else as written. Served slices with a good sized dollop of whipped cream and a thin slice of fresh orange. It looked lovely but my guests and I were disappointed. Next time I'll try a different recipe.

I thought this was good but I didn't love it like previous reviewers. I made it according to the recipe. Serving with whipped cream was a plus. Wouldn't necessarily make it again though.

Loved this, however I thought the orange zest in the pastry and the filling was a little overbearing, to the point that that is really the only thing that you tasted. I would suggest to keep the zest in the pastry and let the ricotta filling speak for itself. I doubled the pastry, and chilled both. Rolled out on a pastry cloth with plenty of flour incorporated to prevent sticking. It worked out well. Used a 10" tart pan, sprayed with Pam, brushed the top pastry with an egg wash, after baking, sprinkled granulated sugar as suggested. Served with A dollop of whipped cream, a drizzle of raspberry coulée, a couple raspberries and mint leaf, beautiful presentation. The only reason that I am giving 3 forks and not 4 is that I think the orange zest was a bit overbearing. Will definitely make again.

This is a fabulous recipe; very simple ingredients and easy to make. A big hit as the ricotta makes it so creamy and the orange zest in the pastry and filling really made a lovely cool summer dessert, accompanied by whipped cream. I had my mother down to my baby brother raving about it, so it's a defintie for all ages. TIP: I brushed the top of it with egg white before baking, which gives it a gorgeous crunchy sheen. Then dusted it lightly with sugar granules. Then (thanks to anther reviewer) cut 5 extra-thin slices of orange and decorated the middle.Will make again soon for any occasion. Only fancy ingredient is the ricotta.

I have made this recipe twice in one week. Looking to approximate the cassati (ricotta pie associated with Easter in the Italian culture) my mother-in-law used to make, I tried this. Since we absolutely loved it on Easter, we made it again yesterday for guests, placing each piece on a pool of lemon filling (using the recipe from the Joy of Cooking). Every one of them asked for the recipe. Thanks, Eliza, for sharing your family treasure!

(am i alone here?)

This recipe was delicious. A few recommendations I have is not to overfill with ricotta filling or it will overflow when baking (I threw out a little filling), also, chill both pieces of crust to handle more easily, else it is too sticky to work with.

I made this for my italian in-laws for Easter. It was a huge hit. I accidentally put all of the eggs into the crust before realizing it was divided. It came out a little more cake-like (and was horrible to handle). They were none-the-wiser, though it was a little too much crust for my taste (they ate it all though). I also cooked it with several very thin orange slices on top. This added a nice visual and colorful effect.

Based on previous reviews and my time constraints, I used a pre-packaged pie crust. I followed the filling recipe but added 1/4 teaspoon almond extract. I did not use a top crust but sprinkled the top with sliced almonds and coarse sugar crystals. I made it for Easter and my one friend stated that he felt he was back in his Italian grandmother's kitchen! Simple, delicious...perfect!

My guests all loved this pie. I cut the sugar by 1/4 and would cut it even a bit more the next time. I would use the full amount only if you like desserts to be very sweet.

Wonderful! Everyone raves. I made the tart with no top crust. It was outstanding. Also, accidentally used 1 full cup of sugar and the zest of one large orange in the dough and it tasted fabulous. Without a top, I will try a few pine nuts during the last few minutes of baking, for visual interest.

Loved this cake, the orange zest is a wonderful addition. I used lots of extra flour on my work surface to keep dough from sticking.

This was very good-the orange really does jump out at you. Like the previous review, the crust is VERY hard to deal with. Definately use the wax paper method for rolling after chilling the dough and a little flour for it not to stick. Other than that, this was wonderful.

My daughter made this for desert on Easter and it was outstanding! I took the left over dough and made a 1/2 dozen sugar cookies and they were wonderful too. We will make this one again and probably use the dough recipe for Christmas Cookies this year.

Absolutely fabulous! I've never made or eaten this kind of pie before and we all flipped over it on Easter! My only problem was the dough was very difficult to roll out and put on top and I sloppily draped it over and made do. It looked awful when I first put it in the oven, but by the time it came out it looked fine and you could hardly notice. The orange taste really comes through - delicious!

This dish exceeded my expectations, it was SO YUMMY! Whoops, and now I see I only added half the recommended eggs . . . It was perfect though!

This was a very tasty tart. I make traditional Italian Ricotta Cheese Cake each year for Easter, so when I stumbled across this one, I thought I would give it a try. My cheese cake doesn't call for cream cheese which added a nice dimension to the finished product. I do not have a tart pan with a removable bottom, so I used a springform pan and greased the sides really well. I lost the pretty presentation of the tart pan, but I believe the finished product tasted just as good! My Italian family seemed to enjoy it, too!

Served this for Easter. It was delicious. The orange really comes through. Only problem was the "crust" is really soft, wet and sticky to work with and I didn't want add a lot more flour to make it more workable. You definetely need to CHILL it to work with it and roll it on wax paper so you can invert it into and on the tart. I wonder if I didn't use the top if it would dry out. The filling was very creamy.

I used pine nuts instead of candied citron, and 2 Tbsp. limoncello instead of the vanilla. I also drained my supermarker ricotta before mixing; probably not necessary with Calabro brand. A lovely fresh-tasting dessert.

This was the perfect ending to our Easter dinner. It was sweet, easy to prepare and a welcome break from holiday chocolates!

This was easy to make and very delicious. My friends who are Italian immigrants loved it. Can't imagine any higher praise.
