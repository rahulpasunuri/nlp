This was a big hit! I thought the cranberries might be too tart, but with vanilla ice cream they were perfect. The poached pears were amazing all by themselves.

I did this from the magazine recipe, so I didn't benefit from your reviews. The shortbread crust is delicious! I too would have cut down on the poaching recipe, as I probably had close to two cups of syrup left over. Great if I ate ice cream often, which I don't. Might make good gifts though. For me, I would cut that part of the recipe in half. Also, the cooking time was much longer than 10 min. to get to syrup state.

Everything in this recipe turned out correctly and tasted delicious. It looked beautiful. But it just didn't pull together to make a cohesive dessert like I expected.

Ok something is missing from this. The poached pears are great, the cookie crust is awesome but it doesn't hold together. Next time I think I will add a custard cream to make the tart hold together when you cut it. And you only need half a cup of cranberries at best.

Very good dessert and the syrup was the best part. I cooked 2 extra pears than the recipe calls for so the tart crust was filled completely. This dessert is a great change of pace to heavier offerings.

I loved loved loved this tart. I too had lots of syrup left over, but I will serve it on ice cream another night. I didn't change a thing from the recipe *except* I used Martha Stewart's pate sucree recipe for the pastry. Next time, I would make a double layer of pears, instead of a single layer. The pistachio sugar was a lovely touch to the tart. This is definitely in my "make again" list.

The timing to reduce the mixture down to a syrup is totally inaccurate. It took closer to 35 minutes rather than 10.

This was a big hit at last year's Christmas dinner. It is delicious and looks beautiful. I was amazed at how easy it was to make. I also had lots of syrup left over.

This is a fabulous recipe, worthy of a photograph when it's assembled and tastes wonderful, too. The crust is excellent--although, as always, I did not chill the ball before rolling it out. It rolled out beautifully at room temperature. (Or maybe my rooms are cooler than everyone else's!) Next time I might leave out the sugar in the pistachio sugar and simply line the crust with chopped pistachios. I found the sugar gave a slightly gritty texture, even though I used less than the recipe called for. You may decide to ignore this advice, but I for one am constantly "de- sugarizing" dessert recipes I find online. It's amazing-- sometimes appalling-- how much sugar is called for when it's really not needed. I also suggest clearing all the spices--the cloves and the cinnamon stick-- from the poaching liquid before you boil it down. As I boiled mine, the spices fell apart and were difficult to remove once the reduction was fully thickened.

I've made this several times to rave reviews. I have dressed it up a bit with a mascarpone cream base: omit the pistachio sugar, mix a container of mascarpone cheese with 1/4c powdered sugar, cinnamon to taste, and 3 tbl of cream. Spread the mascarpone over the crust, top with the 1/2c finely chopped pistachios (from the pistachio sugar), and proceed from there. It's wonderful!

This was absolutely delicious and made for a gorgeous presentation. I made it exactly as written; the syrup took much longer to reduce than 10 minutes and I did have some extra as well. A great, light dessert for the holidays.

I made this tart exactly as written. I was able to make the pears,cranberries,syrup, pastry, and sugar the day before. Then assemble the tart an hour ahead of my dinner party. Everyone absolutly loved the tart. I will make this again and again. I agree that it made extra syrup, but you needed that liquid to poach the pears and cranberries. The syrup is wonderful!!! I am not sure you can have too much of it. I served it with premium vanilla ice cream and it was just perfect. Give this a try. A definite winner!!!

Loved it. Big hit with everyone and not a crumb left. The recipe made much more red wine syrup than needed so I'll have to think of something else to use it on. I wouldn't think of letting it go to waste.

This was just ok. I'd rather have only the poached pears with vanilla ice cream.
