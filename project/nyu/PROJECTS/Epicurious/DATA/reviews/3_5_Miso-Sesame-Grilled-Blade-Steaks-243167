From the instructions it should be clear that it's not a marinade as such, more a paste than cooks on the outside of the meat. Nothing that thick will marinate meat in 20 minutes. I agree with the reviewer who commented that the type of miso should be specified. A very strong variety like Red Miso 'Aka-miso' is far too salty. After a bit of experimenting I have settled on a half shinjyo (very light brown) and half Saikyo (the white miso made famous by Nobu in Miso Black Cod), which makes it on the less salty end of the miso scale. As for the meat, I think any fatty cut grilled on indirect heat slightly cooler and longer than the recipe calls for works well, as the lower temperature lessens the risk of burning the miso paste completely. If you want to eat it as part of an Asian meal you can slice the steaks thinly across and serve in the middle. Then everyone can put the steaks in their rice bowl so the yummy bits of miso end up on the rice!

I was looking for a quick recipe for a cheap cut of meat that would please everyone in the family - this did the trick! It was fast, used only a few ingredients, and was quite flavorful. I'll hold onto it for week night meals, for sure. I was not sure at first whether I was supposed to rub off the marinade before grilling because it was pretty thick and miso can be very salty, but I left it on and everyone enjoyed, especially the crispy bits. I also just cut out the gristle leaving the blade steaks in two strips (I intended to chop it up for stir fried rice the next day, but there were no left overs). For sides, we served steamed jasmine rice, oyster flavored stir fried veg, and a light brothy soup.

This was very good. I used pork loin slices and Dashi Miso with Bonito. Also cooked on stove in cast-iron skillet. Entire family enjoyed it...even my 2 year old. Served with peas and rice as I do not like cabbage. Will definitely make again.

The thing that annoys me the most about fusion recipes like this is that they betray an ignorance of the ingredients they use. What kind of miso? There are at least five common kinds on the market! White miso? Miso with bonito? Dark double fermented miso? Also, I would add more mirin and marinate longer. Some types of miso will be too salty or too light for this recipe.

We made this with flat iron steak, which is the same area of the cow but no center gristle. We let it sit for 2 hours rather than 10-20 minutes in the miso paste mix. The steak was amazingly tender and had great "steak" flavor, but the miso and soy flavors were almost undetectable--unlike when similar mixes are made with fish. The paste burns rather easily so I'm not sure more of it is really the solution, at least not if the excess is not removed before cooking. I also don't know how much the marinade is going to penetrate with more time. I'll be making flat iron steak again, but probably not this particular seasoning. Unless maybe the acid in the mirin is what tenderized it?

My husband and I whipped this up on a night when we were both tired and hungry. It was quick, easy, and danged tasty. We paired it with the Spicy Napa Cabbage Slaw from the same issue of Gourmet, and they were fantastic together. I totally recommend this one. Not having a blade steak, I used a cube steak I had around, and it worked just fine. Don't worry about the blade steak bit. I'll bet almost any steak would do.

I really love how miso can taste geat on all kinds of meat. These steaks tasted great and the recipe was very simple.

I felt that the marinade did not penetrate the meat deeply enough, so I recommend a longer marination time. Also, the marinade can be improved on with stronger flavours. I would probably rework the recipe in future.

Very nice recipe...

Normally, we try not to eat much red meat, but this recipe was delicious! We couldn't find "blade steaks," so substituted "breakfast steaks" (thinly sliced steaks) instead. Even our toddlers liked this one.

This was a fun recipe! The steaks cook quickly. The butcher knew where to find the blade steak at the top of the shoulder and cut one special for us. The marinade was delicious and for an inexpensive cut of meat, surprisingly flavorful. The butcher said if we wanted, we could filet along the gristle for a more tender cut, but as the recipe is written, cut across the gristle and snipped through the center, I think the only difference would be in presentation.

Or you could look for 'patio steaks' or 'flatiron steaks'. Technically the latter is a slightly different cut from the same part of the cow without the gristle.

Google "Blade Steak" click on the wikipedia link. Recipe writers, posting on the net, are going to assume and certain level of research competency is present amongst the target audience.

The recipe does not explain what a "blade steak" is. Here in northern California the stores do not carry anything labeled simply "blade steak." Cuts of meat have many diffent names in different parts of the country, so recipe writers need to be very specific in explaining what cut they have in mind. I used to see "blade chops" in the midwest, which were lamb, but a blade steak? NO idea.
