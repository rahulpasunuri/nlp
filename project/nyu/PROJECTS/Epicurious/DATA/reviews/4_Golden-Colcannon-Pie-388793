Definitely beats boring boiled cabbage and potatoes, but taste to make sure there's enough salt and pepper in there before you add the egg. Will be making this every St. Patrick's Day!

I made this for the first time on St. Patricks Day. What a hit for everyone! Will definately make this again for my husband, my mom, anyone. I mixed half cabbage and half kale, which I had never even tasted before.

Found this to be boring. Needs some kind of spice. I agree with a previous reviewer that more pepper would help.

This was so simple and yet so tasty. I was in a hurry (quite typical) so I pressure cooked the potatoes and cut the cabbage into smaller chunks to steam. I also used 2 eggs and used 2 pie plates because I wanted it to cook a bit quicker. No scallions but onions worked quite fine. A great St. Patrick's day meal.

Great recipe. We loved it for St Patrick's day dinner tonight. Changes: I didn't use the egg, and made vegan style substituting olive oil for butter, and only used about a Tbs. Added salt and a generous amount of black pepper, which I think is important in enhancing the flavors of potatoes & cabbage. It baked up beautifully.

I just made this for the first time. I nuked the cabbage with some carrots I needed to use. I diced some Maui onion cause I didn't have scallions. I also had about 1/2 cup of leftover cooked corned beef so I added that. A very inexpensive flavorful dish.

How much kale, if you don't want to use cabbage?

Why not include the potato peels? After all they contain the food value. Why not microwave the chopped cabbage in a couple of tablespoons of water again for the food value. And I think the taste.

i have made this often as is, but usually make some changes. i make colcannon with kale which is healthier and also still traditional. i also eliminate the egg and occasionally add a layer of corned beef or ground beef to make a one-pot meal.
