The crust, and caramel filling were super good and very straight forward. I was nut a fan over the the whole hazelnuts. I thought the flavor was a tad over powerin. I am making these again this week and will crush the nuts over the top instead.

These were easy to make and delicious to eat. I did change the recipe around, however. I added cream before heating it and again after heating it, and it came out creamier and more delicious. These were gone within a day. You can't eat just one!

Delicious, I was lazy to make them indivually so I made this in a 10" pie dish. I will definitely make them mini next time. they are very rich.

yummo! i followed the recipe exactly, but had so much caramel left over that i bought 15 phyllo shell tartlets, filled those and still have enough caramel sauce left for ice cream or pound cake! these little tartlets are to die for; the toasted hazelnuts really add a nice twist. they are easy as can be, not labor intensive, just time-consuming with all the waiting and chilling. everyone loved them, so i know i will be making them again. it's cool the way the hazelnuts float to the top of the filling. big hit everywhere they went.

This were very easy to make, but I did it the easy way! I used caramel from a jar that I had and for topping I used nutella, needless to say that my kids loved them! The pastry was very good and very easy to make,with lots of other uses,

How can this recipe have 4 forks if I am the first to review it?!? Sounds goo, I'll admit, but still...
