The original recipe in Gourmet magazine (dec 1990) used 3 minced garlic cloves instead of 2. I think 3 is better for 3 pounds of pork!

this recipe is as good as it gets, delicious and easy to prepare, a real keeper. i have made other picadillos that were far more complex, this was as good, if not better, than some of the others. served it with rice in palce of the tostadas.

I really liked this, and I love that it took (from start to finish) about 15 minutes. It doesn't get any easier than this! (I cheated and used store-bought taco shells)

We enjoyed this picadillo. The green olives were prominent! Felt that the clove and cinnamon combination complemented the recipe. The flavor was subtle-it would have been hard to guess what the spices were just by tasting it. Used the food processor to make freshly ground pork from a pork London Broil. Will probably do this picadillo again.

I served these as tacos at my recent appetizer party and they were delicious. The spices add an authentic richness to this dish.

This dish was very, very good. My family and I decided we liked it better using the tortillas as a taco, instead of as a tostada. It is easier to eat them with your hands than try to cut through the tostada shell. Will definitely make it again.
