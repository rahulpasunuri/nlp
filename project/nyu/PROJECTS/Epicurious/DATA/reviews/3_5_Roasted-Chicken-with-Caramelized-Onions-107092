I agree that this was quite oily - would cut down the butter and oil next time. The chicken was good although it took 15 extra minutes to be done, and it was not a huge chicken. The onions (I added whole mushroom caps) were DELICIOUS. The vinegar balanced the oiliness nicely. Will make again - and a good basic technique for roasting cut up chicken with or without the garlic skin.

This recipe was fairly time consuming although much of it can be done ahead of time. I liked the blend of flavors. I followed the recipe as written. I did use the bottled peeled garlic cloves for convenience. My dinner guests loved it.

This was tasty but there was a bit too much oil in the final product. The onions were fine by me, but not that well liked by others at the table. I omitted the cream which may have tempered the acidity of the onions.

I loved the garlic flavor with to onions... even my 3yr old and 1yr old loved this dish. I would make this every day if I had the time!

We roasted a whole chicken with some baby onions. While the chicken was resting, we made the sauce in the roasting pan with roasted onions. Easy..Great..

This is a great recipe! I added the sliced mushrooms to the onions and kept everything else pretty much as written. I made this for a friend last night who raved about it the whole time we were eating. Will definitely make again very soon.

I love this recipe! It's one of my family's absolute favorite dishes. Peeling all the garlic cloves is definitely time consuming, but it's worth it. The blend of flavors - roasted garlic, balsamic vinegar - is delicious. I've made this with chicken pieces as well as whole split chickens and it's been a hit either way. I would recommend brining the chicken in advance for a moister result.

Beware of this one! It's awful - an awful waste of good ingredients and time!

Definitly a keeper. We made a half of recipe, followed the hint from one of the reviewers of just adding the whole garlic under the skin of the chicken. Not sure what the purpose of boiling the garlic in milk and throwing away the milk is, but we love garlic and enjoyed biting into the soft and delicious garlic cloves as we enjoyed our chicken. Also added a pint of slice mushrooms to the onions as they were near done. We did not reduce the amount of onions used from the original recipe, even though we were making a half portion. Glad we did this as the taste of the onions were a special treat with the chicken.

We have been to Pinot Bistro and it is a GREAT restaurant so I expected this to be a GREAT recipe and it was just okay. The onions are good but as far as roasted chicken goes..... IF I make this again, I would put the garlic paste under the skin of the chicken before pan-frying. We don't eat the skin so most of the flavor was lost. Also, the roasting time was too short. The chicken we used was 4 pounds and after 25 minutes in a well heated oven it was still rawish inside. I served this with mashed potatoes and an Eggplant and Tomato Gratin veggie from Cooking Light 7/2002.

Loved the onions; I would think they would be great with any dish.

This was very good. The steps in the recipe were a bit out of order, I thought. What I mean is that it tells you to do the garlic first--yet its the onions and chicken that take so much longer. Also, I would definitely prepare the garlic paste a day ahead--peeling all those cloves was the most time consuming step.

Wonderful! I don't know why the garlic cloves are boiled in milk before roasting. I couldn't stand to throw away the milk so I added more garlic cloves and butter and made garlic mashed potatoes as an accompaniment! This dish is really quite tasty and easy.

This is a keeper. The blending of flavors is fabulous. The only change I made was to replace half the balsamic with white wine. Don't let the effort required deter you from making this dish. Enjoy.
