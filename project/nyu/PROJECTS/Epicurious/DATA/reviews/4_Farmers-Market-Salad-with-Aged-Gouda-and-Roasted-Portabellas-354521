Very tasty. I did do a few things differently, I added roasted red bell pepper and feta instead of gouda because that is what I had on hand. I also added thyme to the mushrooms while they roasted.

yum! i used a mix of baby arugula and mustard greens, and believe the mustard greens made it amazing. the only thing I changed is i upped the cheese because i can never get enough cheese, and i added honey to the dressing. next time I am going to double the amount of portabellas and add fresh sliced strawberries.

I used smoked gouda, and added raisins (an awesome combination) and cherry tomatoes from the garden. Next time I'd add toasted nuts as well.

Delicious salad! I added a bit of sugar (consider honey or maple syrup...I like A Cook from Washington, DC's suggestion), and a bit of lemon. It was tastier than I expected.

Delicious! Love all the tasty portabellas. I only added a touch of maple syrup to the dressing (or you can add a dab of honey). This is a great go-to salad!!

Easy, flexible, delicious. It's prefect as-is, and easy to add more accompaniments to make into more of a meal. Love it!

And to odlaram7, let's just stick to helping each other out on the recipes. I don't think the title is that important and it's no more pretentious than calling yourself a locavore.

I don't believe that there is another name for them, just les champignons de portobello. But you can also use les champignons crimini or les champignons de Paris.

Could someone please tell me what portabella mushrooms are in French. Haven't found them in the dictionary. Thank you.

Not a review, just a comment: does anyone else think the title of this recipe is a bit pretentious? I mean I'm a locavore and all, but this just seems a little much.

Very good. Served it with a charcoal grilled rare T-bone.

This was absolutely yummy. I used all arugula which paired well with the gouda and dressing. I added slices of grilled chicken to make a complete meal. Next time I would add heirloom tomates to add some color.

This is one of the best salads I have made recently. I pared down the portions for 2 people and served it along side a salad of heirloom tomatoes (cut into one inch pieces) marinated with a chopped clove of garlic, red vinegar and olive olive with basil. It was perfect for a summer night's meal. Make sure to use the aged gouda - it was a delicious contrast to the portabella mushrooms.

Fabulous salad. The only change I made was the addition of toasted pine nuts. Very good taste!
