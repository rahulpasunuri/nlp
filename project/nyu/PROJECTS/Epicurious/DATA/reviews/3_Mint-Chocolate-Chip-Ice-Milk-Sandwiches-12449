I tried this recipe out of sheer frugality...my Skinny Cow addiction was going to send me to the poor house!! I LOVE the snaps - needed a bit of milk to bind the dough however. And the ice cream (I used 1 T Vanilla instead of the Creme de menthe and no chips) firmed up nicely in my Donvier and has a nice mouth. A bit of work for a Baker's Dozen, but far less expensive than $5 for 6 sandwiches!!!
