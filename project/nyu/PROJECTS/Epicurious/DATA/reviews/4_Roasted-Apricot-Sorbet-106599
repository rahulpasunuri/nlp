I make sorbet all year round, but my favorite time for it is in the summer, and this recipe is the reason why. I substitute about 1/3 Splenda for the sugar, with no observable difference in flavor or texture. I like to team this up with homemade banana and raspberry or blackberry sorbets.

Woah, Nellie! This is sweet! I'm surprised no other reviewer has commented on the sweetness. Maybe the apricots I used were particularly sweet? They were fresh off the tree from Yakima, WA. Still, despite the intense sweetness, this sorbet recipe shines! I will most likely pair the apricot sorbet with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream to tone down the brightness. Would make it again, though!

I absolutely loved this recipe and wouldn't change a thing.I like sweet and it is sweet enough for me. I did strain it and it has a very creamy consistency with an intense apricot flavor.

When I was little, I used to get in trouble for sneaking spoonfuls of frozen orange juice concentrate directly out of the freezer container. I couldn't put my finger on what this recipe reminded me of at first, but this has a similar tangy, concentrated, addictive taste, albeit a little more sophisticated. Yum.

Just wanted to add that the texture--creaminess--of this sorbet is just RIDICULOUSLY good! Soooo smooth and yummy! I've been recommending it all around!

This is a really easy and quite a tasty sorbet recipe! I'm pleasantly surprised at how delicious it is. Even my 6-year old likes it. :) It's got quite a strong dried apricot flavor, but I imagine it comes from both the dried apricots as well as roasting the apricots. Followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing!

The roasting gives the sorbet an unexpectedly rich texture -- almost chewy like fresh ice cream. Frozen peaches can be substituted for the fresh fruit.

Although my daughter thought this needed more sugar, everyone else who has tried it loved it just as it is (made exactly to the recipe specs). It has great silky texture (I strained the base), lovely deep color, and a very intense apricot flavor. I've mixed a scoop with thickened, drained non-fat plain yogurt, and it's just delicious like that...creamier. In that case, I DO add a little extra sweetener at the time I mix in the yogurt. I highly recommend this.

I first made this last year and it was spectacular! I flavor of apricots really shines through. Great dish for the fleeting apricot season. Later in the summer, when the apricots were done, I used dried and fresh peaches instead. This also turned out very nicely. The roasting really brings out the flavor.

Wonderful texture - smooth and creamy. The dried apricots dominated though, so I'll decrease a little bit next time.

Very intense apricot flavor. I used dried slab apricots (ugly to look at but very flavorful) which probably helped. I didn't bother to push it through a sieve as the puree was very smooth. I bought an ice cream machine just so I could try this recipe. I've been waiting (not very patiently) for apricots to be ripe so I could try it. It was worth the wait.
