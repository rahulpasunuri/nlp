Okay, no self-respecting pit master would really call this pulled pork. But for an incredibly simple, quick weeknight dinner it's one of the easiest dishes ever. Kids loved it, we have some leftovers, and they're already asking me to make it again. How bad can that be?

It is best to cook the meat in plain water, or perhaps some root beer and then add the BBQ sauce after shredding (then cook for about an hour more), but NOT to cook the pork in BBQ sauce for 9 hours. The sauce turns bitter. It was gross. I thought it might add extra depth to cook it so long, but it was just plain disgusting.

I have made this recipe about 10 times and it pleases everyone, including epicurians. I am making it again this weekend for a work party. I have no doubt that it will garner many compliments. I have a big crock pot so make about 8 lbs at a time, and it still only takes 8 hours to make a delicious sandwich. I have done this the other way (slow smoke) and this recipe is almost as good and whole lot easier.

Returning the pork to the slow cooker after shredding makes a big difference in achieving a truly deep barbecue flavor throughout. I kept the shredded pork in the slow cooker for at least another 45 minutes before serving.

Delicious! The only reason I withheld the extra fork is that the proportions of sauce and meat are off. I would use a larger piece of meat or try 1 1/2 bottles of sauce.

OK, I know this is nothing like a proper, slow-and-low, smoked pulled pork, but the effort/reward ratio is extraordinary. If you can get past the in-authenticity of it, try it, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Being the epicurean that I am, I made my own BBQ sauce (sauteed onions and garlic, then simmered brown sugar, tinned tomatoes, cider vinegar, ketchup, paprika, chipotles, chileajo, and liquid smoke), and went heavy on the vinegar. Coming home from a nine hour night shift, I just put 1.5kg of salted and peppered shoulder, trimmed, somewhere in the region of 40+floz of vinegarey BBQ, 8 hours on low in the slow cooker, and some seriously tender tender pork came out when I woke up. I would argue that if you can attend to turning it over halfway through, it might benefit from only being half covered by sauce, as the top edge managed to peek out on mine, and it had a nice 'crust' on that bit. If you like the end of a roast beef, you know what I mean. There was definitely plenty of fat to skim off the top when it was done, and the sauce only thickened a little, but it worked out beautifully, making for sloppy-in-a-good-way, tangy sandwiches. It served up nicely with the Tuscan Kale Caesar Slaw from Bon Apetit July 2011. Definitely a keeper for me, sacrelige or not.

This is more like a really bad Allrecipes recipe, and not at all what I look for from Epicurious. Pork boiled in BBQ sauce until it's nearly mush, really? ugh!! People, cover or foil it and bake it in the oven if you don't have a smoker.... way better than crockpot mush! It'll be ready to pull at around 195°F. internal temp.

Ignore the snooty reviews. This is a great technique for home pulled pork (and cheap$). I tried several other "fancy recipes" & then finally thought of trying the slow cooker- it was far better & easier. Wish I had seen this earlier so as not to waste my time on other techniques. Of course a homemade BBQ sauce would be great, but there are some very good bottled sauces out there these days.

1. Go to supermarket 2. Buy Jack Daniels shredded pork, pre-cooked 3. Heat and serve. Far easier and less expensive than doing this yourself, and delicious. I serve on toasted sesame seed bun with tomato and avocado.

The fact that this is a recipe from a baseball "star" is its only redemption. Of course it is easy, & it would work great for "BBQ Mini's" for party appetizers.

No offense but it seems that this should be listed as beginners guide to making a sandwich.

Easy recipe, but I'd toss a piece of provolone on top of the pork once it's on the bun. And add jalapeños.

This is nothing short of an insult. The 30-year-old pamphlet that came free with my mom's Crock Pot has more thoughtful recipes. Meat+jar=dinner is well below the standard of Epicurious, Bon Appetit and the late Gourmet. The fact that people have given positive reviews is just as depressing. Someone rouse Ruth Reichl.

Pleaase, this is not a recipe worthy of Epicurious. It obviously is intended for those who do not find creativity and joy in cooking. Perhaps you could have included a recipe for homemade barbecue sauce?

Try making this using the Kalua Pork recipes on this site. They work just as well and take less than half the cooking time! Aloha

This was wonderful - my husband thought it was better than we get at restaurants!! I put the pork in the crockpot at 7:30 with salt, pepper, and half a bottle of BBQ. Left it in until I got home at 5, it was perfectly cooked. Takes a LOT longer than anticipated to shred it! Will definitely make this again.

Delicious and simple. I added a large sliced onion into pot before cooking and used only 1 1/2 bottles of barbecue sauce. This recipe needs at least 8 hours in the crock pot if not longer.

Great classic crock pot meal. Almost didn't want to put the pork back in the sauce once it was shredded, the flavor was already incredible! I added sliced sweet onions to the crock pot and rubbed pork with minced garlic as well as salt & pepper. Would maybe add green peppers as well next time.
