I made this with fresh strawberry sorbet and added finely chopped sweet and cinnamon basils to the lime semifreddo with great results. Delicious!

My daughter made this as an end-of-summer dessert, and it was wonderful. We really liked the contrast between the taste and textures of the sorbet and the semi-freddo. I think the semi-freddo could be used with lots of other things (it is really the star) and the sorbet is good on it's own as well--you really don't taste the tequila. Together, however, the two are more than the sum of their parts.

This dessert was wonderful! I used a farmer's market fresh watermelon and it turned out great. My only problem was including the seeds, I really regret not taking them out but otherwise this is a delicious (and easy) recipe for the summer.

I completely agree with the other reviewers who have indicated that the semifreddo is the star of this dessert. My first impression was that next time I would just make that. However, after just finishing my third piece of this, I'm now appreciating the contrast in the lime and watermelon flavors and textures more. Overall, a good and unique summer dessert.

Loved this. Didn't have tequila so I used dark rum. I did pick out the dark seeds, and I'm glad I did, as I found that the black dots resulting from the few I missed annoying. The last of this was still very good two weeks later.

Made some changes...substituted 2 tbsp white rum for tequila; didn't have ice cream maker so froze, whipped, and froze sorbet; and forgot to whip cream until stiff. The taste was still very refreshing (thought I didn't get too much of a boozy kick). The sorbet had quite large crystals but I attributed that to lack of ice cream maker. Otherwise it was easy and looked impressive.

Do you think it would taste good with vodka instead of the tequila? I'm not much of a tequila fan...

Yummy! The second time, I made these in a 9x13 (I don't have a 9x9, and used an 8x8 first). The thinner bars were easier to eat. We also made the semifreddo just a little bit more tart--more lime zest and juice.

I only gave this three forks because I actually made Bon Appetit's Fresh Strawberry Sorbet (I do not like watermelon). It was fabulous!

Fantastic! Super easy with few ingredients and pretty quick to pull together. I made it for some Labor Day guests - a great dessert to send off the summer!

excellent summertime dessert. My husband is a huge watermelon fant and thought maybe if we doubled the watermelon sorbet it would be even better - it really turned out well. You don't think the tequila works with the wate melon and it just really made it wonderful for a hot summer day!!

I agree with the first reviewer who commented on the sorbet... when I first took it out of the ice cream maker it was great, but when it fully froze it was just too cold to enjoy. I have sensitive teeth and it was just painful to eat. The semifreddo was delicious, however. I like the idea but I feel like the sorbet just needs a bit of tweaking.

This is a beautiful summertime dessert. I made it after seeing the recipe in the July issue. My mother and I unknowingly made it the same weekend. I used a store bought sorbet (Ciao Bella, blackberry cabernet flavor)and she made the watermelon. We brought each other a sample. Both were great but the watermelon didn't have quite the intensity of flavor I was hoping for.

Cooks illustrated has a great similar recipe but more simple, to make watermelon popsicles, similar sorbet, fold in a few mini chocolate chips, spoon into small paper cups. When almost solid, spread softened lime sherbet over top, insert stick and freeze til solid. A very cute "palatte cleanser" for the summer!

I haven't made this yet, but know that some things don't taste as well frozen because our taste buds don't work as well with things that are too cold. I also wonder if this wouldn't be really good if the lime business was made green with food color, and used as "rind". then freeze lime first, and add the watermelon business to make the appearance of watermelon as well as the taste. I made something years ago like this, using a smallish bowl and using purchased sherbets. Bet a homemade version would be MUCH better.

Very simple to make. Sorbet is delicious on its own. Yummy summer dessert.

I thought the watermelon sorbet was delicious when it was first made and sort of slushy, but by the time it froze solid, it wasn't as good. The lime semifreddo was delicious though.
