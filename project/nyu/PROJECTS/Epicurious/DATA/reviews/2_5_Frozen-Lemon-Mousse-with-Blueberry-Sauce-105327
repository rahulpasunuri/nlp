I thought this was fabulous on a hot summer day! I've made it several times and every time people just rant and rave!

This dessert was hard to deal with. It didn't come out of the pan easily. It didn't serve as many people as I thought it would. It wasn't great.

I thought the presentation wasn't very good. You could hardly distinguish between the layers of mousse and cookies. I used blackberries instead of blueberries and that worked fine. A much better (and beautifully presented) lemon mousse recipe is the Bon Appetit Lemon Mousse with Rasberry Mint Sauce.

NOTE: You MUST remove this from the freezer about 20 - 30 minutes before serving to soften it up a little. It was too hard The amaretti cookies make a wonderful texture contrast to the smooth mousse and the lemon/almond flavours work well together. I served it with strawberries.

I thought this recipe was pretty mediocre, and after making it, was especially puzzled why the author of the recipe thought the mousse should be frozen. It added nothing to the flavor of the mousse, and the texture was not pleasant. The dessert tasted better after what was leftover was put in the refrigerator.

I recently served this to some visiting relatives. It was light, cool and perfect for a very hot summer evening. I especially liked the fact that I could make this ahead of time and pull it out of the freezer when I wanted to use it. It sliced up very easily for serving. I used bordeaux cookies instead of amaretti and was pleased with the result. The contrasting colors of the mousse and sauce make this very easy to dress up for a more dramatic presentation. I will certainly make it again, but may try my favorite lemon mousse (also a Bon Appetit recipe)instead of the one listed here.
