Quite good. Added a jalapeno, corn, and only 1/2 red pepper. Baked as muffins. 15 minutes at 425.

Sorry - I forgot to add that it only took about 30 minutes, not 40 minutes. So just watch your oven closely. I just didn't want anyone going to the trouble of making corn bread and then burning it or drying it out!

The only change I made was to add some corn and green onion along with less red pepper. The texture of this corn bread is very good - firm, but not dry. The cumin makes it very savory so you may want to add more sugar if you like a sweeter corn bread. And if you had cumin-haters in the family you could leave it out. I think this recipe would work well for stuffings. In fact, I think I will save the leftovers for that purpose.

I made this for a group of sixty to go along with black bean soup. Everyone loved it.

This had to be the best cornbread I've ever had! It was moist and flavorful, and the peppers added a nice touch. Next time I'll use more salt (and there will be a next time). Who could guess it's low-fat?

Good -- savory and quite peppery, not sweet. My personal sweet tooth prefers sweet corn breads, though :) Good texture. Shorten the baking time by about 5 mins or so.
