This turned out terribly--the toppings were watery, which made the crust soggy.

Delicious. But like everything in the world, even better with bacon. Fry it up beforehand with some sliced red onions and you've got a fantastic, well-balanced pizza that is fit for the a main course. (I also cooked the grapes in just a couple T of red wine vinegar instead of wine and sugar, which cut the sweetness nicely.)

this was delicious, sweet and easy.

Wow! Rich, different, wonderful! Worth the expense. Agree, though, that this might be nicer served as an appy rather than main course. At the moment, we are restricted to a no-red meat diet for a few weeks and that inspired me to finally try this recipe. ummmmmm--oh, I too used a Boboli shell; topping proportions perfect.

I've made as is on a number of occasions. Agree with previous reviews that proportion of ingredients in recipe is right on (extra is just too much) and is better served as an appetizer than an entire meal. Even my picky friends loved this one!

Just got back from Tuscany, where I had a modest, but delicious form of gorgonzola pizza in a cafe in Sienna. It was a new taste treat. Came here to find something similiar and, grazie, here it is. Can't wait to try this version...thanks for all the tips! The only one I will add is that the version I had in Italy had no weighty toppings...and the crust was very, very thin and light.

Really-this pizza dough is so easy to make and so delicious and adds so much to the dish that it is almost a shame not to make it. Very classic Tuscan flavors..excellent and unique appetizer.

I was really disappointed in this pizza. I was so excited, as it looked like a marvelous recipe. I had even specially ordered the proper cheeses. Maybe I was just expecting too much.

I utilzed a combo of wines as well. Great combo of flavors. Grilled. Really nice looking.

Very nice recipe. I substituted a combo of a dry white wine and ice wine since that was what I had on hand and it turned out well. Because of the sweetness of this pizza I think it would be best served as a nibble (rather than as a main course) paired with a nice glass of white wine.

I'm not a pizza fan, but this recipe looked like a crowd pleaser, so just gave it a test whirl (with a premade uncooked crust). And even I say, yum! Agree with reviewers below--the proportions and ingredient list were carefully crafted on this one, I'd stick to them pretty closely. Even the cooking time was right on for me!

Used Marsala since I didn't have Vin Santo. Also added garlic, oregano, basil, and thyme to the crust. Got rave reviews. The only problem? My guests ate so much, they weren't as hungry for dinner!

Vin Santo not available at my grocery so I substituted a merlot.

Less is more with the toppings on this pizza. I loved the idea of strong cheese paired with sweet grapes, so I went a bit over board and added nearly 2 cups of sliced grapes and the result was a pizza that was overwhelmingly sweet. The roasted grapes carmelize and are delicious, but would be best as a hint of sweetness and not an overpowering flavor. Similarly, next time I'd add less fontina as well.

YUCK!

What a wonderful recipe~! I went and purchased a bottle of Vin Santo, $19.95, and do think it is worthwhile to do so. My pizza was done much quicker than the recipe said, so I would keep a eye on it whilst cooking. Other than that.. follow recipe as stated and enjoy! BTW, i served this as a addition to a cheese/charcuterie plate at a party and out of all the fancy cheeses and salamis.. my friends liked the pizza the best!

This pizza sounds quite bizarre but the end result is amazing! So much flavor. I will be making this again for sure!

This was just amazing...very easy especially if you use ready made pizza dough. I wouldn't change a thing!!!

This was an awesome recipe. Used plum wine because that's what I had. Also, didn't bother making the crust and used a Boboli...not a crumb remained!

This sounds amazing - haven't made it yet but looked up a substitute for Vin Santo and - it's Marsala. Looking forward to more reviews.

This is a great pizza, one of the best recipes I have tried in a long time. Luckily I had a bottle of Vin Santo, and I think it is worth sticking to the ingredients listed if possible. The wine added just the right touch. I bought the dough at a local Italian specialty shop, and it makes a difference -- to have the kind of crust you like. I didn't use the parchment paper because I have a mesh metal pizza wheel which made it easy to transport the pizza. I hope you try this recipe.

Yum! Sweet yet the slight tang of the cheese comes thru. I don't know what Vin Santo is so I used balsamic vinegar. I was impatient, though, and boiled it down to 2 Tablespoons rather than the 1 called for in the recipe Next time I'll go to 1 T, or drain off the excess liquid (oops--my mistake!). The flavor of the gorgonzola just came thru and wasn't overwhelming. Next time I'll probably bump up the ratio of gorgonzola to fontina because I'm a gorgonzola NUT! But there's certainly nothing wrong with this recipe as is!!
