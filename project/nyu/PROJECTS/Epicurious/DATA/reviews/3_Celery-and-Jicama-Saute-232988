Easy, delicious and fast to prepare. I used half a jicama and 4 stalks of celery to make 2 generous servings. I didn't have fresh parsley on hand so left it out. It was a big hit. Highly recommended.

It is yummy, though not terribly exciting. I pesonally think the heathiness of this one makes it a winner. Extra pepper and lime instead of lemon.

I thought this recipe was great, teally unusual. I'm a big jicama fan, I'd never thought to cook it. I upped the garlice quite a bit to give it a little more flavor, with the lemon it was very flavorful.

Peeling the jicama was time-consuming. Canned water chestnuts would be simpler and would offer a similar taste/texture. Dish was decent but not worth making again.
