This is a nicely balanced recipe that does well eaten hot from the oven or, even better, eaten cold on a picnic. A little slice of heaven with pickled Red Onions on the side. The dough is nice and flaky with a good flavor. Although, I didn't follow the instructions completely because I make a similar pastry dough in two less steps, so I used those steps instead. :D All in all, a tasty pie that will be a picnic staple and a holiday party trot-out.

Just baked it. May Cheese gods forgive my ignorance, I bought Boar's Head vermont white cheddar (8.something per pound). And OMG, this delicate melt in your mouth flaky goodness is sitting on my plate and waiting for me to finish this review. Salivating and wrapping it up quickly because I will drool all over my keyboard. Thanks for sharing this, it's awesome!

Delicious! Instead of steaming the potato I shaved it paper thin with a mandolin and cooked it until translucent with the onions. I served this pie at room temp and it was perfect. Will be making again soon.

Fantastic! I thought this would be fairly plain but I used 1/2 tsp of dried thyme, 1/2 cup of fresh italian parsley, and the Cabot Seriously Sharp white cheddar. It was awesome. My wife, who is not a big fan of onions, loved it. Served it with a nice salad and basalmic vinigar. Perfect.

Made this with lots of parsley and very sharp cheddar. It was really good, more interesting than I thought it would be. It was pretty, too, the tart looked great on the table.

I made this with Cabot "Seriously Sharp" white cheddar; the recipe was easy to follow, and the pie was beautiful and very tasty -- similar the Cornish Pasties I've had in England.

This was easy and yummy. Has something for everyone - cheese, onions and potatoes (and a great buttery crust). Can't wait to make again.

This pie was delicious at a recent brunch. I used a very good quality Irish cheddar, with lots of character, and I'm sure that makes a big difference. The crust is gorgeous, delicious and flaky. Like some reviewers, I used parsley instead of thyme--added nice color. And don't omit the potato; it adds a bit of body and texture. I'm sure it's important not to overdo--it's only about 3/4 cup of diced potato. Served with an apple and poppy seed slaw, a perfect complement.

Reviewers who found this bland: try substituting stilton for the cheddar; absolute heaven for lovers of strong cheese.

What I love about this recipe is that it works equally well at brunch or dinner, and much of the work can be done ahead. I use parsley instead of thyme, a good quality English or Irish cheddar, and a premade crust from FreshDirect here in NYC. (Homemade premade, such a treat.) My parents were here for Mother's Day last year and my father liked it so much he begged my mother to get the recipe from me.

This was my first crust too - and it was very easy and turned out great. Used parsley instead of thyme. Used Black Diamond cheddar. Could use a little something more, maybe a little less potato and more cheese.

I'd make it again, with perhaps a 1/4 cup more cream because everyone found it on the dry side. I served it with lightly steamed veggies tossed in an oil and mustard dressing, but next time I might make a creamy mustard sauce for the pie itself, or serve heavily dressed leaf greens on the side. It needs something akin to the tang of mustard to really bring out the flavours. I think it's going to be better tomorrow, or even the next day, after the flavours have had a chance to meld. Good for a quiet night at home, but not for company.

This was my first pastry crust! This was delicious, not heavy at all. The texture and flavor was very good. I will definitely make this again!

This tastes exactly like the pasties we bought at the village bakery in Shropshire a few decades ago. Thank you!

I agree that the cheese is really important. I used a great quality white cheddar and the sharpness gave it lovely flavor.

Excellent recipe. I used good quality cheese and it turned out beautifully. It was light and tasty and the potato actually gave it a really nice texture -- but I followed the instructions re: the potato EXACTLY since I thought it sounded a bit weird.

I thought this was heavy and bland. The potato gave it a real starchy texture and there was no interesting interplay of textures or flavor.

I made this for a company luncheon...it was well-recieved. It's imperative to use a quality sharp white cheddar, or else the pie will be bland. It was just as good warm or cool.
