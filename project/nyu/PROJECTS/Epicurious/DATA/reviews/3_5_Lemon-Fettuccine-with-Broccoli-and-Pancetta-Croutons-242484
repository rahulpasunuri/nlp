This was an easy recipe that also tasted great. I have to admit, I made a couple of substitutions/additions but nothing that really changed the spirit of the recipe. I had some trader joe's chicken sausage so I used that cut into small pieces in place of the pancetta. I also diced and caramelized a medium onion with the sausage. Other than that, followed the recipe. Simple, tasty flavors. Would definitely make again, especially since it was so easy.

Two forks as is; meh. Three forks after I added garlic and creme fraiche.

I will definitely cook this meal again as my children loved it... I substituted bacon for the pancetta and extra lemon juice for the lemon rind ... It a great family dish ...

I made this recipe with a few modifications. Since I am lowering the amount of fat in my diet I use I chose whole wheat fettucine and coated the noodles with an olive oil/lemon juice/garlic vinagrette. I steamed the broccoli and a little delicata squash I had left in the fridge which I added to the noodles along with some grana padano. I didn't have any pancetta but I had a little prociutto left so I cut it into ribbons and garnished the dish with it. The flavours were fantastic and I look forward to making it again.

We absolutely loved this dish. Made a couple minor adjustments with stellar outcome. Thanks Epicurious.

This is a distinctive pasta dish that is very good by itself or to accompany such dishes as "Chicken Breasts with Fontina and Prosciutto" found on this site. I followed the recipe as written.

This was a good quick supper.Used leftover broccoli, frzn. gr. moose sausage along with a mettwurst sausage instead of the pancetta. Didn't need any butter or oil as the fat in the sausage was sufficient. Husband really liked it. I just "liked" it...too much spice in the sausage then I put too much gr. blk. pepper on it.

I found some beautiful broccoli at the farmers market and this recipe was the perfect way to let it shine. I made a couple changes: I carmelized some shallots while the broccoli and pasta cooked and then tossed them in at the last minute. The sweetness was perfect with the bitterness of broccoli and the salty bacon. I also finished the recipe differently: I added all the parmesan with the butter and oil (and other ingredients) over low heat. I reserved a cup of the starchy pasta water and added a splash at a time to make a nice silky sauce before adding the broccoli and pancetta. I know we all hate it when someone makes changes and then reviews but I just can't help myself!

Very delicious. I used regular bacon because I had an excess of it... its probably better with pancetta, but still very good. Quite light but very tasty.

I made this last night for super-bowl Sunday. Very easy to make and totally delicious! I also reduced the oil, but I kept the butter amount the same. I used frozen broccoli florets and steamed them in the microwave because it was easier for me that way. This will definitely be in my rotation. We had leftovers tonight for dinner, and it was even better! Don't skip the pancetta...YUM!!

This was indulgent and wholesome at the same time. We made it on a cold December day and paired with a red wine (Shiraz/Cab-Sauv blend), which cut the butter beautifully and rounded out this warming meal. I also substituted green peas for some of the broccoli to increase the protein and fiber content but still preserve the beautiful green color. This was also really quick and easy to make. I'll add it to the monthly rotation.

I used lots more lemon juice (as I didn't have an actual lemon on hand from which to get zest). Instead of pancetta, I cut prosciutto into strips (fettucine-sized) and toasted it in garlic and olive oil. I also threw in some sliced mushrooms I had leftover. Delicious. (Also, I didn't measure the olive oil, and used about 2 T of butter... The parmesan is plenty oily on its own.)

We wanted to try a different pasta dish and this fit the bill. It has interesting and light flavors but we still found it to be filling. My 18 month old son ate it when we topped it with a little marinara and my 4 year old daughter ate it willingly. The only change I made to the recipe was to use regular bacon instead of pancetta. Will make again probably every other month.

So good, I used fresh red pepper pasta to give it a little more flavor and it was just fantastic!

Perfect summer pasta meal. I used basil instead of thyme, and I also added some sweet onion to increase the veg content. Loved it!

Made this for a Christmas open house...was the rave. Everyone loved the mix of flavors. Excellent and easy!

When we tried this, we thought it might be our second favorite pasta dish ever. And we love pasta. Yum. My sister just brought it up at dinner tonight, about 3 months after eating this. I think I'll make it again next week!

And, I used Barilla Plus mulit grain thin spaghetti!

This was delicious and light. I didn't use the pancetta since I eat very little animal protein and I felt that the thyme would have been a little too strong for the delicate flavor of the lemon and rind. I reduced the butter and "Primo" extra virgin olive oil to 1 1/2 tablespoons each. This was perfect for us!

Good and different-I used angel hair pasta which made it lighter as fettuccine is heavy. I liked the lemon taste and added garlice which enhanced the flavor.

I made this exactly as written and it was delicious. The lemon adds a nice and interesting flavor. Next time I will definitely add more pancetta and more butter. The pasta and broccoli really soaks up the butter.

Loved this! Very bright-tasting, and light enough for summer even with the pancetta. I used a whole lb. of pasta, so I didn't feel it was as oily as some other reviewers. Will make again often!

This is one of those dishes where the quality of everything you put into has a big impact on the outcome... real parmigiana reggiano & high quality extra virgin olive oil are a must. We used half the amount of olive oil & butter called for & I will probably use even less next time. Great flavor combos - I'll definitely make this one again.

My family loved this dish, but next time I make it I will definately used less butter and olive oil. My daughter, who is a super picky eater, had seconds!

We love this dish very much and have made it a staple in our meal planning. You can certainly cut back on the oil and butter if you desire, but organic butter and extra virgin olive oil are very healthy for you so we prepare the recipe as noted. I've also tried using uncured bacon and it works just fine.

I added a half-pound of roasted butternut squash, cut into 1/2" cubes, which added a tasty splash of color. I also added garlic and wine, at the suggestion of other reviews.

I did the same as misskiki and added garlic and wine to the pancetta fat (even reduced the amt of fat as well). I wanted to make it more substantial so I substituted broccoli with asparagus and added sauted shrimp which I had sprinkled w/a wee bit of crushed red pepper before sauteing.

this is great:) if anyone fell it doesn't have enough flavor, then it probably didn't add it enough (lemon juice, salt, pepper) I used diced ham in place for pancetta(that was in house)and of course some garlic. I licked my fingers and 3-year-old licked his plate :) In my kitchen this is a keeper.

Although I enjoy the recipe as described, I usually make a simplified version with buttered noodles and a squeeze of lemon instead of the sauce. It makes for a quick and easy meal on work nights. Also, I think asparagus makes an even better match with the pancetta than broccoli.

My boyfriend and I decided this would taste better with a less sticky pasta such as penne. Also the lemon flavor was faint to nonexistent and the pancetta very salty.

Rating: 4
This was great, really different. We made it exactly as suggested, and wouldn't change a thing. Make sure you use really good pancetta, that is key. And in my view, the broccoli is the perfect compliment for the flavours, but that is subjective, of course.

I thought this recipe was very good, simple and straight forward. I did take recommendations to reduce the fat. I used 3 tbl of butter and 1 of olive oil. I drizzled lemon juice on the pasta first, then the zest, butter and oil. Then I tossed in the rest. The pancetta I used had a lot of flavor. I liked it.

This was a very bland recipe. I followed it exactly and it, to say the least, lacked flavor. Nothing impressive! A waste of expensive pancetta.

yum!! i agree with niania - i cooked a little garlic in the bacon fat, added some wine, and threw everything in that pan to mix, leaving the butter out completely. great.

This recipe is great.. I added garlic and white wine to it though! Use the pan that you cooked the pancetta in (don't wipe it out)..add 1 T of minced garlic heated just slightly. Add bout a 1/2 cup of white wine, reduce to a glaze and put into the pasta after it's cooked with the butter, oil, lemon juice, zest and thyme..it gave it a nice kick!

It was very good. I reduced the amount of olive oil by half, but I should have also done that for the butter. It is just way too much for 9 ounces of pasta. If you use thick cut bacon, as I did, I recommend about 5 slices. It was tasty and I would definitely make it again.

This was delicious and easy. I used dried thyme and think spaghetti but everything else as instructed. Next time I might use fresh thyme. Also a little more cheese and not as much olive oil

Good. Easy weeknight meal. I used spinach fettuccine and cut the amount of butter and olive oil in half.

I ended up not using any of the olive oil, after adding in the butter and other ingredients I didn't feel it needed it.

My entire family--husband and kids aged 6 and 2--loved this quick-and-easy pasta. I used regular bacon and just crumbled it up into the dish. I'm looking forward to pasta leftovers for lunch today!

We thought this was wonderful! Light and flavorful with a delicate lemon twist. This is a great quick meal and will certainly make it again. Thick cut bacon would be a nice sub for the pancetta.

very nice - lite & tasty. A little dry - perhaps a little chicken stock??

I used dried spinach fettuccine, a minimum of butter- flavored spread plus olive oil, powdered thyme, and bacon. Very good, and I am making it again tonight. The lemon adds great flavor. I think the lemon and freshly grated Parm- Reg are the key to the great taste. You could clearly substitute any number of fresh veggies for the broc.

Not great, but pretty decent. I agree with almost everything the previous reviewer stated. I would definitely cut down on the olive oil. It did take a bit longer than 15 minutes, but it was an easy recipe to put together. I will definitely make this again as a mid-week easy dinner.

Rating: 3
This was delicious. Made as written,but next time I would cut the oil and butter by at least a third, as it was very oily. Broccoli and pancetta proportions were fine. Perhaps a little more cheese, and a little more thyme. My market has slice to order pancetta, and the chewy little cubes were great. Speaking of more "time", unless you are very organized and a real speed demon, this recipe is NOT a 15 minute recipe.
