Served this for guests and had rave reviews. Since it was such a large cake for a small dinner party, I froze half the cake and served it again for Thanksgiving at the beach. It was wonderful even after a month in the freezer.

This cake was absolutely delicious and a big hit when I made it in '98 for a get together at my daughter's country preschool. I am going to make it for New Year's this year for her. It is NOT a no-brainer and requires quite an orchestration, but it is well worth the extra effort. I made it exactly as written, used Calvados for the brandy. It is basically a spiced apple cake with a most amazing maple cream cheese icing. Delicious.

I JUST HAVE TO SAY THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING CAKE EVER !!! I USED THE WHOLE BAG OF GOLDEN DELICIOUS APPLES IN THIS RECIPE (I CHOPPED BY HAND THE APPLES INTO LITTLE PIECES BEFORE BOILING THEM). I BOILED BOTH THE APPLES AND THE CURRENTS(DRAINED AND COOLED UNDER COLD TAP WATER) INSTEAD OF USING THE 1/4 CUP OF WATER,I USED FRESH COCONUT MILK OUT OF THE COCONUT. I ALSO USED 2 TBLS. OF BRANDY INSTEAD OF ONE. FOLLOWED THE REST OF THE RECIPE AS WRITTEN. I DIDNT USE THE 9 CAKE PANS, I USED 2 OF THE LARGER ROUND CAKE PANS . I DID HOWEVER NEED TO BAKE THEM FOR 45 MINUTES INSTEAD OF THE 20 MINUTES THAT THE RECIPE CALLED FOR . PRESS IN THE CENTER OF THE CAKE, IF IT SPRINGS BACK UP, ITS READY. THIS IS BY FAR ONE OF MY MOST FAVORITE CAKES EVER !!!

I had saved this recipe back in 1998 and finally made it for a dinner party with friends this weekend (November 2011). I can't believe I waited so long to make this one - it's delicious and everyone loved it! Since Pippin apples were not in season, I used MacIntosh and, like others, did not puree the apples. I did use more apples, which came to about a pound and a half after peeling and coring. I refrigerated the icing double the time recommended, stirring it in between. You've absolutely got to use the dried currants, they make this so special (I finally found them at Fresh Market). This cake is an incredible fall dessert!

As some other reviewers have mentioned, the apple taste is basically lost in this cake, and it closely resembles a carrot cake. That's not to say it isn't delicious, because it is. But if you're looking for apple flavour, this isn't the cake you want. Like others suggested, I didn't puree my apple sauce and left it a little chunky. I also added a little more than the 1 1/4 c. I substituted currents with chopped apples. It took a little longer than 20 minutes, and as another reviewer suggested, I checked for springiness and not just a toothpick coming out clean. The cakes came out beautifully. As for the frosting, I'm not the best judge as cream cheese frosting isn't a personal favourite, however, I can say that as far as consistency goes, it was an utter failure. It was incredibly liquid, more like a glaze. I tried adding more butter, more cream cheese, icing powder... I let it chill, I put it in the freezer, nothing helped. The cake was hideous when iced. I wound up putting cookies all the way around the cake to hide the sides and then tied a ribbon around it. The cake was very moist and not too dense. It was extremely well received and I had five people ask for the recipe.

This cake was fantastic, even after leaving out the baking soda! I thought the layers looked a little small and then discovered I had left out that one ingredient. Cake was more like pound cake than fluffy layer cake but still delicious! I used Granny Smith apples (my local Kroger didn't have Pippins) and did not puree them. I found the apples nice and soft after simmering them with the water. Now about that frosting...I could eat an old shoe with that frosting on it and it would taste good! Fantastic and I now have visions of eating the leftover frosting on a toasted bagel. This cake is a keeper, can't wait to taste it with baking soda next time!

This cake is simply marvelous--the recipe goes in my Favorites file, and nearly everyone loves the taste and texture and wants the recipe. I can only make when I have chunks of time to concentrate just on making this.

Wow. I made it with leftover pear-ginger sauce (that I had put on the ginger cheesecake) and just layered fresh apples on the top of each cake layer. For the frosting I added a bit more maple syrup because I didn't have maple flavoring and added a fair amount of powdered sugar to thicken it up. Sprinkled some cinnamon on top and the cake was gone by the end of the night with just 9 of us eating it. Amazing amazing cake (especially with ginger-pear sauce).

I have made this cake again and again, minus the nuts for my allergic friends, and it is absolutely worth the effort every time. This cake, and this frosting is delicious. Absolutely fantastic. I'm making it tomorrow using fresh pumpkin puree instead of the apples...

This cake is absolutely delicious! I made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand - Granny Smith Apples, dried cranberries instead of currants, and almond extract in place of brandy. The only thing I might change next time is to swap some of the butter for oil - I like my cake nice and moist. I will be using the maple cream cheese frosting in other recipies - it is fantastic!

Rating: 4
Delicious cake! The frosting is to die for - I used vanilla instead of maple favoring because I forgot to buy the maple. For the cake, I don't think I'd puree the apples next time, just leave them kind of chunky after cooking. I left out the currants and used pecans rather than walnuts because that's what I had on hand. It was very good - will definitely make again.

it was YUMMY! i chopped the apples and added buttermilk to the batter. The frosting was GREAT! and i didn't have any problems with the consistency. I made them into cupcakes and they made abt 30 cupcakes (abt 1/4 cup matter) each

Awesome cake! Pureed apples and added one chopped. Omitted currants & nuts (inside) and added extra cinnamon. Substituted buttermilk for water too. Frosting was delish and great to work with- cut brandy to 1 tsp. and added extra vanilla. Chilled cake & frosting overnight before applying final coat. Picture perfect with toasted walnuts on sides.

I was a little disappointed in this cake. But it may have been me, not the recipe. I chopped the apples instead of doing the puree. I also substituted golden raisins for the currants and skipped the brandy. I thought it was a little on the dry side. and didn't have as much apple flavor as I would have liked. The frosting is unbelievably good, but very soupy. I had guests coming for dinner and had to keep putting it in the freezer to firm up. I think next time I try this, I'll make my carrot cake recipe and put in apples instead of carrots. And I may put in powdered sugar in the icing to help it stand up better. I really wanted to pipe a shell border along the top of this cake, but unless I had put the icing back in the freezer for another hour or so, it would be impossible. It's almost a glaze consistency. With some modifications, I think I could make this better.

Cake was pretty tasty. Left out the brandy, currants, and walnuts. No Pippin apples, so used Gala. Didn't puree apples either. Just roughly mashed them up. Loved the maple combination with this cake, however the cream cheese doesn't seem to work with this cake. It seems like a plain maple icing/frosting would work great instead.

Rating: 4
This is the best apple cake ever! I made it with and without the brandy and without is much better. Also, I chop up the apples dust in flour and add right to the mix. I think it gives the cake more texture. The frosting is amazing. I have made this 3 times and people rave over it. A definite keeper!

I just LOVE this cake. I was given the recipe by a friend after I raved about it when she made it. It really does come out beautifully every time I make it. I've make a few changes to the basic recipe here and there, but it doesn't merit any changes (except I never puree the apples!). YUM. This has to be one of my favorite recipes ever! The icing is wicked.

Rating: 3
The kids loved this cake when I made it for Rosh Hashanah and asked for it for their birthday. Great frosting--the cake can be a bit tricky--needs to cook enough but not overbake. I followed the substitution tip of buttermilk for water. I also used 4 apples and didn't puree them as my kids don't like raisins, so I left some chunks of apple to replace the raisin. The cake can be sticky, so lining the pan with parchment paper helps a lot.

Good cake but I've had better. Ideal for those who like a fine-crumbed cake. The icing, however,is fab.

This cake is so good. I also chose to chop the apples (I used 3 large) and add 1/4 cup buttermilk instead of the water. The cake turned out super moist, dense, chock full of apples and delicious! So far, this is the best apple cake recipe I have found. Note: when I tested this cake with a toothpick, it came out clean, even though it was a bit undercooked. I would recommend pressing on the center of the cake to see if it springs back instead of the inserting a tester, which may be deceiving. Enjoy!

This was, in my opinion, a pale imitation of carrot cake. The frosting, however, was out of this world. I would make that again.

Great cake! Easy to make. Made a few adjustments based on family preferences and availability... used 3 large Gala apples and added them in chunks instead of puree, used pecans instead of walnuts and Grand Marnier since I didn't have brandy. Also, left out all maple syrup and maple flavoring, using 1 teaspoon of vanilla instead. Everyone at our holiday dinner raved! This one is a keeper.

I made this cake for a dinner party because of all of the rave reviews - very disappointing!! I would agree that the cream cheese frosting is fabulous, however the cake itself is very average. Nothing great - just average. There are many other cake/dessert recipes far better than this one.

Definitely a keeper! I made this for a family dinner and continued to receive compliments for several days. I made the following changes from the recipe and was happy with all of them: pecans instead of walnuts,kept the apples chunky as so many other cooks had recommended, omitted the brandy simply because I didn't have any on hand, baked it in a 13x9 pan to feed a crowd of 20+ and to simplify assembly. I'm looking forward to making this one again.

This cake came out extremely perfectly, despite a few novice-cook missteps (first we took it out of the oven too soon, then put it back in with a little bit of frosting already on, THEN overcooked and cut off the burnt parts, disguising them with frosting). I was so worried what the people at the church function would think but it was such a hit that it disappeared in five minutes and everyone raved about it. I also made a second one with the leftover ingredients (intending to make two but only having time to bake one) and it came out very well despite sitting in the fridge overnight. EVERYONE talked about this cake, even the next day after services! Completely appropriate for an autumn gathering or holiday.

Fabulous! I cut the recipe in half and used two 8" cake pans. And I, too, didn't bother to puree the apples.

Everybody that I made it for absolutely loved it! I did Macintosh apple chunks instead of pureed apples, didn't have dried currants so I chopped up some dried cranberries, used some good bourbon instead of brandy, and used pecans instead of walnuts, as suggested --- absolutely incredible!

A great cake - sort of the apple version of a carrot cake. Chunky granny smiths were the only variant in my cake - worked fine, but I'll probably double the amount of apples next time, just 'cuz they were so good in it but all too rare; used vanilla extract rather than maple flavoring in the frosting (husband not too fond of maple) - worked fine, too. I've never seen such an easy frosting turn out so well!

Rating: 3
I can tell this cake would have been fabulous if I hadn't tried to cheat and use apple sauce from a jar. I served it at my son's birthday party and was a little embarrassed that it was too heavy. Luckily the frosting more than made up for it. When apples are in season I'll try it again.

This definitely tastes better without pureeing the apples. The cake is delicious- very dense and moist. I added vanilla extract to the frosting and cut down on the maple flavor.

Fabulous cake, don't hesitate to try it. The frosting is the star, although the cake itself is quite good. The currants help make it a little moister, so don't skip them. I included walnuts in the cake, but not in the frosting. My dinner guests loved it! A real keeper.

I find that pureeing the apples makes the cake bland. I soaked the apples in sweet sherry, and left them chunckier. This gave the cake more flavour, and the texture was great!

Rating: 4
This cake is wonderful - I was told it tasted like a cake from the 50s. The cake is not overly sweet, which is good, because the frosting is the scene-stealer in this recipe. My friend said it was picture perfect, and tasted even better than it looked. If you want to try a variation on the cake, I chopped up a Pippin apple (obviously without the skin and core) and substituted it for the currants. I was concerned the cake may be too moist, but since the recipe calls for tossing the currants with a tablespoon of flour, it worked very well. It gives the cake more of an apple taste, given that the apple puree mixed gives it a very subtle apple flavor. If you want to impress someone (or just thrill them with a really good cake that's not chocolate), make this cake!

The reviews are steller, the cake is not. It's more like a mild/bland spice cake. The taste of the apples is completely lost.

I made this cake for my friend's birthday and she said it reminded her of one her mother used to make, which sounded to me like a pretty nice compliment -- assuming her mother is a decent cook, of course. I used raisins and nuts, the frosting was delicious. The cake was heavy enough to be its own meal but a complete success.

I was in such a hurry to make this cake that I forgot to add the baking soda, but needless to say I assembled the cake and it looked great a little short but great. Nobody knew anything was wrong except me. It was a little sweet because there wasn't enough cake to balance out the fronsting but it was still very good. I used 3 apples and only got a little over a cup of puree, so next time I will use 4. And being in such a hurry I had lumps in my frosting, so after I put nuts all on the sides I melted some chocolate in a zip lock and drizzled it on the top for decoration, since it was such a little amount you couln't taste it. I too left out the currants but I think next time I will add raisons.

I made this cake for a picnic with my boyfriend and his family and everyone raved about it. I left out the currants,and walnuts (just because I don't like them).

My husband absolutely loved this cake, and he is not easy to please and usually doesn't like cake at all. He keeps asking me when i'm going to make it again. I was afraid all the different flavors were going to be too much, but they worked together wonderfully. I used pecans instead of walnuts (always better down here in pecan country), and dark rum instead of the brandy. I made it in an oblong instead of layered for easier travel and I could have halved the frosting recipe. Also had to cook an additional 15 minutes. My husband thought it tasted better cold.

3 apples was a must, as were the currants. Used pecans since I don't like walnuts. Cake is really good, but I thought the frosting should be a normal cream cheese frosting. The maple frosting was outstanding, but would be better on a maple cake. Will make again. Also-it is a must that the cake come to room temp before serving. I had to threaten people who tried eating it while it was still cold. I kept telling them..Trust me-wait!!

I thought the cake was delicious and within 10 minutes of bringing it to the office, it was gone! I used more apples, cooked them until done but did not puree them, leaving some soft chunks of apple. You have to use raisins and walnuts, that's the best part! Also, I used a little more maple flavoring in the frosting and a I used a 13x9x2 pan which was perfect and less hassle than a layer cake. 2 Thumbs Up!!!!

This recipe is very nice. I found that the apple puree did not amount to 1 1/4 cups though. So I will add an extra apple next time. I did not use the currants and walnuts in the mix. I baked in a jelly roll pan. Cut the sheet in half, frosted one, then topped with the other. Then sprinkled with the finely chopped walnuts.

This is a very delicious cake. I made this cake as part of a dessert buffet for Thanksgiving dinner at a Country Inn I was working at last year. It was well received by all the guest. I also was ask to prepare a dessert for a friend that was having a party and did not have time to bake and this was what she wanted. In my opinion there is nothing better than a fresh crop of fall apples, and this recipe make good use of them.

Didn't find the cake to be amazing, but it was very flavorful. I would omit the currants next time--seemed to have too many flavors going on with the apple, currants and walnuts.

This cake was just wonderful. I made it for my mother's birthday party and she and her guests just loved it. Mom's cake was only a 2-layer because the third one cracked as I was taking it out of the pan. So I covered the third layer with frosting and nuts and put it in the fridge at my father's house where I knew it would get eaten. Dad said the frosting made it really stand out and he even shared it with other family members who liked it just as much. I'll definitely make this one again.

What a rich cake, would definitely make it again. My guests loved it. It was hard to judge when to take it out of the oven because the middle was moist due to the apple puree. I cooked mine a little too long,but my guests didnt notice, they all wanted the recipe.

Quite possibly the best non-chocolate dessert I've encountered to date. This opinion is seconded by the dozen or so people to whom I served it. The cake is delicious, and the frosting is one of the easier, better-behaved ones I've made. Two personal notes: (1) For those who need to bake gluten-free, this recipe works very well with gluten-free flour mixes (rice/potato/tapioca); (2) If you can't get currants, dried cherries and chopped dates work well, too.
