Delicious and simple. If you have Home Goods stores near you (division of TJ Maxx), scour their food section on weekly basis. It's where I pick up all my expensive oils (truffle, grapeseed, walnut). They are not expired (generally have a year to go at least) and are about half the cost of the same oils in my grocery store.

Delicious! I didn't have high expectations, but it was excellent. I added garlic, and both my husband and I enjoyed it.

Yum! Had leftover cauliflower from two huge party trays - about a gallon bag full. Added lots of garlic to the onion like other reviewers and eyeballed portions of chicken broth and milk. After simmering added about 1/4 tub of soft cream cheese and shaved a hunk of an unknown semi- hard cheese over it to finish. Used white pepper and truffle oil to season, and truffle oil to garnish. Very flavorful!

Excellent recipe - only change I made was to roast the cauliflower first for more depth of flavor (toss with some olive oil and salt, roast at 450 for about 30 minutes, turning once). Used fresh pecorino for garnish and shaved with a vegetable peeler. The truffle oil is really a perfect touch to top it off.

Healthy and delicious. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken. The truffle oil added something special to it. Highly recommended!

Yum! Thanks to the reviewers who suggested the half broth/half milk combination - I used 1% lactaid milk and water with a few veg bouillon cubes, extra garlic and it was stupendous. Tons of flavor, few ingredients, easy and healthy too.

This soup is very good, especially when considering how simple it is to make! I substituted milk for half of the called for chicken broth. The texture is wonderful and the flavor is subtle but very enjoyable. The soup reminded me of a potato soup, so next time I plan to add bacon and perhaps a little cheddar cheese, I think these would be wonderful additions. Very good soup, and fast, I will definately make this again!

I loved this recipe, and so did my husband. I used half chicken broth and half milk like some other reviewers, and found that to be ideal. I like my food spicy, so I added cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes when cooking the onions, and that really worked well. And the truffle oil was worth the $15 I paid for the bottle. Soooo good. :)

Instead of using chicken broth, which I find way too salty, I added 2 cups of milk and 1 cup of water. It was a most delicious, creamy and very popular soup. I was able to adjust the seasoning to our taste without worrying about sodium content being too high.

This is an amazingly delicious & easy soup! I always get compliments on it. People are in disbelief when I tell them it's made with cauliflower. I do believe the Truffle Oil is essential (a good, flavorful one!) I also add a bit of Ancho Chili Pepper powder and a dash or two of Tabasco.

I started following the recipe as written, tasted it and felt it was a bit boring/bland. Decided to take it another direction- added sauteed leeks in addition to onion, a little bit of dried thyme, some 1/2 milk and 1/2 chix broth, then topped it w/ crumbled bacon. Overall, came out pretty good, but not sure you need both truffle oil and bacon, one or the other will suffice.

Great recipe. I have used both chicken and vegetable broth, and I prefer the taste of the vegetable broth in this soup (but it darkens the color).

Caveat: I made this recipe using suggestions from others' reviews, but I'm very glad I did because this soup turned out STELLAR. I sauteed one large leek, a quarter of a large white onion, and three large cloves of garlic with the butter for about 8 minutes. Added a small potato at the 5min mark. Then put the cauliflower in for a few minutes, then added the chicken broth and simmered for 25min. Immersion blended the whole thing with half a pack of lite boursin, freshly ground pepper, and a bit of salt--and ta da! An AMAZING soup. I LOVED the drizzle of white truffle oil, but really, if you don't have it on hand, the soup wouldn't suffer. Thanks for the hints, everyone!

OK, the soup was good but even better the next day and awesome on day 3. I would change some ingredients, though. Less potato, more shallot and I would start by browning some (not too much) pancetta or bacon and then using some of the drippings to sautee the shallot, fennel, and apple (I would use a sweeter apple next time, too). The soup was good, but the smokey quality of pancetta/bacon would have been the perfect touch. The butternut quesadillas were awesome!!!! I made them just as stated in the previous review....WOW! Delicious.

I haven't made it yet, but I was going to roast my cauliflower with a potato or two and whole garlic cloves that have been tossed in olive oil, S&P, and turmeric, cardamom, dash nutmeg, marjoram, cumin and while that's a-roastin', sauté some shallot, fennel (I love its clean flavor), and a green apple in butter, S&P and then deglaze with splash of OJ and then white wine and reduce liquid by half, then add the slightly caramelized roasted veg, add enough chix stock to "fill" pot and let simmer for 30 min. uncovered, remove and reserve some florets, puree with an immersion blender until smooth, return reserved florets to soup and add cream, season to taste. Truffle oil drizzle might be in order. I'm going to serve roasted pumpkin/butternut quesadillas with maybe chopped cilantro mascarpone that's been lightly-curried with avocado and pico de gallo? We'll see.... I will let you know how it turns out. Oooooo, fried or roasted plantains would be good in the quesadilla too...mmmm

I've used this recipe several times, always to rave reviews. It's very simple, especially if you use a plunge style blender to puree it in the pot. I've created a vegetarian option by replacing the bacon with butter that has been seasoned with a couple drops of natural smoke seasoning and that works wonderfully. A dollop of mascarpone or cream fraiche to finish it after it's been blended is also nice. Don't skip the truffle oil (truffleless oil?); it adds a richness that sets this soup apart and makes it special.

OK, so every recipe that I get from here or any other source, I make the recipe exactly as written the first time I try it. The recipe here is a high 2 low 3 star soup who's saving grace, really, is the truffle oil, but then again I'd eat my own head with truffle oil. So with the help of other reviewers advice, I cranked up batch 2. This last version is a rock solid 4 star recipe. The differnce? I subbed 1 large leek for the onion, to which I added 2 large minced garlic cloves and sauteed the advised 8 minutes. Add 5C cauliflower florets and saute 2 more minutes. Added 1QT chicken stock, covered, simmered 25 minutes. I then used an immersion blender to puree the soup with 1/2 teaspoon of white pepper and as someone suggested, although I was a little dubious, 1/2 of a 5oz package of Boursin with Garlic and Herb Cheese. Seasoned with a little kosher salt and used a white truffle oil drizzle along with a couple of homemade garlic croutons and HS! Thats one freakin' fine soup. The original recipe was fine, but a little bland for me. The kick ups I added just put this soup WAY over the top!

For a quick after- work dinner I boil a bag of frozen cauliflower with a vegetable bouillon/broth cube, using half milk & half water, then puree (blender for smooth, stick blender for textured). To thicken, double the cauliflower or reduce the liquid. Or use a thickening agent - a tsp of cornflour in cold water mixed in at the end and boiled through, or a few tbsps of potato flakes (boxed mashed potatoes - works great!) at the end. To vary the flavour, add onions and/or garlic while boiling, or use porcini broth/bouillon, or a little grated cheese at the bottom of the bowl and as garnish. I always use truffle oil - it makes a very simple meal taste decadent!

This so simple, yet so delicious. I steamed the cauliflower and then pureed with boursin garlic and herb cheese, green onions, added 1/2 cup warm milk with 1 tbsp butter and 4 cloves of garlic, 1/2 tsp white pepper, salt and then transferred to same pot to thin with 1 cup of chicken broth. I used black truffle oil which i just drizzled on top and garnished with green onions. Will try leeks next time!

Rating: 4
I made this with a few variations, and it turned out very nicely. I roasted the cauliflower (400 degrees for 45 minutes) with one Yukon gold potato and a bit of butternut squash, which added some sweetness. I added these with the chicken stock and simmered for just a few minutes before blending with an immersion blender. As another reviewer suggested, I used leeks in place of a regular onion for a sharper flavor. Also added a chunk of Pecorino Romano, as another cauliflower soup recipe on the site suggested. Overall, a hearty soup with nice flavor, very satisfying.

Rating: 3
For added flavor, I suggest leeks instead of onion. Also try roasting the cauliflower (tosssed in olive oil) until golden & tender before adding to broth in pot. White pepper helps too.

I loved this soup, easy and quick and the truffle oil is great. As an extra-delicious addition try adding liver pate to the soup bowl then pour the soup over it...the pate melts into the soup and adds that extra taste, i made it and had my guests lining up to give them more....loved it.

We really enjoyed this soup, so tasty yet so easy to make. I liked it with the truffle oil but found the taste of the oil was light even though it was drizzled just before serving. The next day I drizzled with EVOO instead and frankly enjoyed this even more.

It would seem impossible to make this any easier, but I just cut up everything, throw it into the pressure cooker with 4 cups water and 3 teaspoons "Better than Bouillion" (chicken) and cook for 20 minutes after pressure has been reached--then puree in the blender--I don't think it's even necessary to add cream as so many reviewers have done--to me, it's velvety and delicious, and I feel virtuous on top!! Win-Win--even my kids love it--truffle oil really makes it special. I find it easier to control truffle oil by pouring a small amount onto a teaspoon, then drizzling...officially my favorite thing to do with a head of cauliflower!!!

What a disappointment! The soup as is had no flavor, so we tried adding extra salt/pepper, a little garlic, and some hickory smoke salt, and then it just tasted like those things. We used the rind of Parmesan and plenty of truffle oil, too. It was so thin, drab, and unappealing that we poured it down the sink and made macaroni and cheese. Ugh!

Rating: 3
Very good, very easy. Here's a frugal Italian cooking tip: save the rind when your Romano or Parmesan cheese is used up. Drop it into soups like this (or, especially, minestrone.) Fish the rind out at the end and discard. Great flavor.

I added 1/4 cup of Romano cheese thanks to another cook's suggestion (and left out the truffle oil). I thought the soup was very good and now I'm just looking for ideas on 'spicing' it up. I will definitely make this again.

I've already made this twice this week. The only change I made was to add about 1/4 c. of fresh grated Pecorino Romano cheese to the soup before pureeing. The result is smooth, rich and creamy, like velvet! Absolutely wonderful, even without the truffle oil!

Rating: 3
Absolutely lovely as cauliflower dishes go. The bacon added a lot of flavor,and the truffle oil at the end is worth adding, elevating the final product just enough to make it extra-special. I had grated pecorino romano on hand, and not being sure how much it would take to make the desired cube, I added 2 tablespoonsful and I think this was the right amount, as it added a subtle slightly salty tang. I would definitely make this again even though cauliflower is not often in my repertoire. 3 & 1/2 forks.

A great recipe to impress guests. I added 1/2 Cup Half and half and an extra pat of butter in the end to give it more of a creamy richness. Fantastic and easy recipe. Just a tiny bit of truffle oil goes a long way.

I served this as a first course last nite at a dinner party and everyone loved it. I added the garlic and fat free half and half as suggested by a previous reader and served parmesan cheese at the table. We finished it for lunch today. A winner!

EXCELLENT with a few additions: 3 chopped garlic cloves added to onions; 1 cup white wine; 1 sliced carrot; 1 cup cream OR 1 cup 2% milk with additional butter. Very slow simmer to reduce liquid by 1 cup. Cool, liquefy. The carrot gives the soup a beautiful peach color; it fools the eye to make you think that cheddar cheese has been added (almost tastes that way also).

Rating: 3
This (without the truffle oil) makes a great base for a fake "cream" of broccoli soup - Very figure-friendly. Just add chopped steamed broccoli and sprinkle your bowl with a couple of tablespoons of cheddar cheese. It tastes very creamy without the added fat. I've even frozen cauliflower soup in individual containers and added broccoli and cheese later.

I don't understand why the previous reviewers rated this recipe so low? I make this soup all the time. Everyone that comes over loves it.

Try this again after reading up it is so wonderful as a first course.

This soup is DIVINE! So creamy and tasty. The first time I made this soup I followed the instructions and ingredients exactly but my soup was kind of bland and needed extra salt. The last couple of times I've made the soup I've used chicken broth without reduced sodium and it's 10 times better. I added cream and extra butter at the end. I'll be making this for Thanksgiving - my husband and kids love it.

This is really good, very easy to make. I great first course. Not too filling, just enough to get your ready for the main course. I used slightly more cauliflower than called for and used an immersion blender to puree the soup. It took a little while longer and it had to be done on low speed or it got too foamy. One lesson learned: Be sure your cauliflower is in small florets. Some of my pieces were too big and took a lot to puree.

Rating: 4
OMG, this was HEAVENLY. Tasted even better than a similar soup I had at an upscale restaurant in Boston a while ago. Granted, I did make a few adjustments to tone down the somewhat prominent onion and chicken broth flavors. Like a previous reviewer, I added a few very generous splashes of heavy cream after pureeing (I would say maybe 1/3 cup total? Go little by little, depending on the ultimate flavor you're looking for), plus I added a tablespoon or two of unsalted butter after pureeing which added just the right touch. These additions make the soup much richer and heavier, of course, but it makes the soup outstanding. I had black truffle oil instead of white, and that final touch totally brought the entire dish together. My boyfriend who hates cauliflower loved this soup, had seconds, and even demanded to eat the leftovers the next day. Plus, it's a snap to make! This recipe is definitely going into my list of favorite standbys.

I made this as an intermediate course for a lunch party we had this weekend, and it was a real hit. I have to say that I added a rather large dash of cream to it to make it richer, as it was served with some reasonably heavy wines. Most of the guests, who apart from being wine geeks, are also keen foodies, wanted the recipe. It's a lovely way to use up truffle oil rather than on pasta or in viniagrette.

I love this recipe!!! Of course, I love vichysoisse, too. At the risk of being mocked, this is a wonderful Atkins dish when you're jonesing for some potato-ey event (a slight modification gets you to something very like mashed potatoes). I added white pepper for a nice edge.

I made this last night and loved it; so did my family. Since I used homemade stock, it did need a little salt. I also added about 1 T. of lemon juice to "brighten" it up a bit and about a cup of good plain yogurt to give it a creamier texture. The tartness of the two added some needed body. I used some chive and tarragon flowers to give it a prettier presentation. Was glad to find a recipe requiring truffle oil - I thought it made this soup much better! Definately a keeper.

This is a great recipe that showcases simple, high quality ingredients. It will pay off to use homemade stock, and leeks and shallots instead on onion. I would try for small, young, fresh cauliflower from an organic producer instead of the hoary old heads usually sold commercially. 1/2 to a whole potato will add body.

how boring - I guess everyone must really love cauliflower - however, it is a good base for truffle oil since the soup has little or no flavor so all you taste is the truffle oil. I think adding parmesan if you are not going to do the oil is a good idea. I added cream which slightly improved things.

Hey, that Pizza recipe - the one with the white truffle oil. Remember that hard to find cheese? Seems to me Tracy must have gotten lost in Minneapolis. And she can't spell. Her posting on 1/3/99 - about 28 months ago...probably says that that white truffle oil; that expensive hard to find cheese has lead her to ????? Is she lost? Got cheese? Got any idea as to why probably fewer and fewer people are posting here? That's a looooooooooooooong time ago! And expensive recipes just don't appeal to the most of us. So, go check and update that review - and BELIEVE IT OR NOT, it might be time to put a newer review on. Or let mine sit and see how long it takes for it to be 'updated'.

I did not have any truffle oil. I did add some garlic while sauteeing the onions. I also sliced a thick piece of some homemade french herb bread and soaked it in olive oil. I then sauteed the bread in a pan and then placed the toasted bread on top of the soup. I then added some fresh parmesan and mozzarella cheese and baked it all in the oven until the cheese was bubbly (a la french onion soup style). It turned out to be delicious but I am going to have to get me some truffle oil.
