I made this to take the beach and my kids - and the adults - loved it! I didn't have all the ingredients so had to make some subs. I substituted the red onion for green, the ginger for cumin, the lemon for lime, and left out the red pepper. I plan on putting the leftovers on grilled fish tacos tonight. Yum!

3 years and counting, still a staple :) BTW, Trader Joes now sells a roasted version of frozen corn. I use a bag of this and a bag of sweet white corn. Not quite as good as kernals cut off a fresh-grilled ear but a lot less work!

My CSA farm gave us fresh edamame last week, thus my search which resulted in this recipe. Whilst shelling the edamame I vowed I would never use fresh edamame again. However I will definitely do this recipe again, the flavors are wonderful. I used regular mayo and steamed corn, otherwise followed the recipe as written. I'm sure it would be even better with roasted corn.

I've been making this for several years now. It's always a huge hit and I am invariably asked for the recipe. I use the mayonnaise as directed. It's a relatively small amount and gets thinned out with the lemon juice. Or lime, which I use more frequently. I've just made up a double batch for a picnic at Tanglewood tomorrow. Like others, I find the flavor only improves after a day or so.

Absolutely delicious. Followed the recipe exactly except that I used frozen edamame and corn, but I could see the roasted corn adding a little something to it. I later mixed it with Israeli Couscous which made for an even heartier side dish. The flavor continues to develop in the fridge, so two days later I'm stealing bites from the leftovers. On the soapy taste a commenter mentioned - I'm betting that you don't like cilantro and this has a LOT of cilantro. Skip it and you might like the dish.

This did not work for me at all. Tasty off and soapy.

This is fantastic and a staple food for me right now: delicious, healthful, satisfying and keeps well. I have to disagree with the pro-olive-oil people though. It is MUCH better with mayonnaise, especially if you keep it around for a few days. I am not a big mayonnaise fan, in fact, before I started making this salad I don't think I'd used more than a few teaspoons of the stuff in the past year. But the recipe calls for mayo for a reason: it just tastes better. I tried olive oil a couple of times and it wasn't bad but I don't think I'll ever make it that way again unless I need to please a vegan.

Healthy, colorful, fantastic! As others have suggested, substitute olive oil for the mayo. I also used lime juice instead of lemon and increased cilantro. To make it more substantial, I added grilled chicken breast, seasoned with southwest dry rub. I made this for a ladies salad luncheon and was told it was the "stand out" of the day, by far! Perfect for summer picnic or pot luck as it travels well and is best made ahead. I'd suggest bringing copies of the recipe because people are going to ask for it. As you can see, there is a lot of "wiggle room" with this recipe. However, making this salad as is will certainly not disappoint! It's a keeper!

I really liked this salad. Like others, I used olive oil instead of mayo. (I can't imagine it with mayo!) I used a heaping 1/2 tsp of prepared ginger and couldn't taste it, but that was ok, I will make without the next time. I added chopped avocado, served it on a bed of baby romaine, and it was very good for a light summer afternoon lunch.

I found this recipe because I had grilled up a whole bunch of white corn that was on sale and didn't know what to do with it. This salad is so refreshing on a hot summer day and so easy to make. One thing I might try when I make it again is to add a bit of rice wine vinegar (I was out of it this time around). I like a bit more acidity. I agree that you could alter the ingredients a bit and make it more latin versus asian if you wanted.

This salad is incredible. I use frozen corn and frozen edamame to expedite the process, and replace the mayo with olive oil as other users suggested. The ginger-lemon-salt combo is so delicious. The whole salad is fresh, easy, healthy, and chocked with flavor. I've made it twice in the past 3 days. Yum!

I make this whenever I'm going to a party where I know there will be a lot of vegetarians/vegans present: I make 4 times the amount in the recipe (which is roughly 2 bags of edamame and 2 bags of frozen corn when corn is not in season). You can skip out on the mayo and substitute olive oil to taste (not a lot...just though to lightly coat). Everyone loves it! Without mayo you can keep it outside a lot longer, it has a lot of protein and it's really versatile  can head more in the direction of Latin than Asian if you omit the ginger. I've even sprinkled some leftovers on chicken tacos to add to the filling.

this salad was so quick and easy to make, and had a delicious fresh taste! i used frozen corn instead of grilled - it was still good. it also keeps well as leftovers.

Super-tasty, I may have over-done the ginger; used a bit of splenda to cut the taste.

I served this at a dinner party and it was a big hit. I didn't use mayonnaise - - which seems so incongruous with the fresh and lively flavors of the other ingredients. I used olive oil instead. I used a lot more cilantro because we all like it and it provided a nice constrasting color.

I love the combination of corn and edamame. Very nutritious and everyone I've made it for asks for the recipe.

This was absolutely out of this world delicious. I added celery, roasted red, yellow and orange peppers that I had roasted in the oven the day before. I cut them up and added sweet pieces. I also added a little balsamic and red wine vinegar. I used parsley since I did not have the cilantro and that was good as well. Also, if you aren't using sea salt, consider it. It makes a taste difference. I will keep this as one that is always a WINNER!

My husband doesn't even like cilantro and he loved this! One reviewer described it perfectly "fresh" and I was pressed for time so I purchased organic frozen corn and shelled edamame from Whole Foods and I don't think I'll make it any other way (unless I have left over roasted corn). I made this, as recommended, with the miso chicken. Great summer meal!

This is an amazing summer salad! I have made it about a dozen times now and most of my friends now know what edamame is...LOL. The only change I have made is to use a can of corn for speed, natually roasted has more flavor though.(why do people change everything in a recipe and then rate it?)Enjoy!

Wonderful salad. My husband and I both went back for seconds. A very healthy salad and I did substitute one tablespoon of plain yogurt for the light mayo because that's what I had on hand. I definitely would use this salad as my first choice for a summer barbeque or other potluck.

Even with all the changes I had to make, this was a perfect side to the Miso Chicken dish. I didn't have edamame, red onion or red bell on hand so I nixed the edamame, used white onion and green bell pepper. I also skipped the mayo for a bit more olive oil and lemon. Good Stuff.

surprisingly good. could easily use all corn or edamame

I took juliunruly's suggestion, subbing 2 good glugs of olive oil for the mayo and upping the lemon juice to that of a whole lemon. This turned out quite good -- the ginger flavor is almost overpowering at first, but it mellows out with time. Definitely a make-ahead dish.

Excellent! I served it on top of a green salad. Since it's winter I used frozen corn and edamame, and just let it thaw...no need to cook.

Nice fresh side dish. I love edamame so increased the portion of edamame to equal that of the corn. I used 1/2 the grated ginger for a double recipe and there was still enough ginger flavor for my guests. Also added green pepper the 2nd time through. Sauteed the red onion slightly the 2nd time I made the recipe to take away a bit of the bite. Very good.

Delicious. Made it the first time as written and was good. Second time around, nixed the mayo, added a splash of olive oil instead and extra lemon juice. Freshy, healthy, a GREAT mid-day snack that screams "make ahead."
