Huge hit. Wonderful taste and texture combination. Impresses guests with minimal effort. I chose a milder, creamy blue cheese. I think that one of the drier and bolder blue cheeses would not have been quite as successful.

This is delicious! I made this for a get together with coworkers and also for a girls' night dinner. I substituted in chopped pecans instead of the hazelnuts. It was a big hit with both parties. Even better, it was SUPER easy to make!

My guests and I all puzzled over these, saying, "I can't decide whether I like them... better have another!" Next thing we knew, they had disappeared. I guess that's good, right? Peeling the hazelnuts was fussier than I expected from the description, but I gave up at "good enough" when there were no more papery bits flaking off of them, even though they weren't fully peeled.

I fully intend to include this one again and again at our Holiday Cocktail Party. I used finely chopped toasted pecans instead of the hazelnuts. Everyone loved them. So fast and easy. If you have to make make multiple dishes, this is a great easy one to include.

these are delicious! And aside from having to husk the roasted hazelnuts, are ridiculously easy to make. I used an asiago bread instead of a plain baguette and lavender infused honey, and served as a snack. disappeared in a heartbeat. I'll be making these over and over again.

I liked this, but would suggest to cut the bread as thin as possible. Found it too thick and crunch at 1/3 of an inch.

I can't believe that something so simple is so delicious but these are fantastic. I grilled the baguette slices on my cast iron grill pan and I used Saint Agur Double Cream Blue. Outstanding. I don't think you need as many hazelnuts as the recipe calls for. I used have a cup with 1/2lb of cheese.

Simple and delicious. What better combination?

I made this for a dinner party and all of my co-workers loved it! I found it to be extremely easy to make. The most difficult part of the recipe for me was to prevent the dumplings from sticking to the pan! I substituted the hazelnuts with chopped pecans. I used ones that were not toasted to maintain the softness of the nut which worked nicely with the crispy bread. I will definitely be making this appetizer again!

I felt like a gourmet cook when I served this at Thanksgiving dinner. This was very easy to prepare and tasted like something that would be served at a fancy cocktail party. The taste combination of the ingredients played off of each other beautifully.

I can hardly call this a recipe since it's so simple, but it did produce yummy results. I plan to make this for many future parties as it is easy to prep and was quite popular. I would suggest using a good blue cheese as opposed to something you would get from the packaged cheese section in a megamart.

I used Rosenborg Extra Creamy Danish Blue Cheese, found in the Safeway deli department. I let it come to room temp and it spread perfectly. Served at a Shiraz tasting and the pairing was perfect. Very quick, easy and got great reviews.

I used a St Azur blue cheese, on the recommendation of the cheese shop I went to. It is amazing, very creamy and spreads like butter. I toasted walnuts instead of hazelnuts and used my favorite wildflower honey. What a treat this crostini is...I will make this one again for sure.

Very good. Used stilton w/a little lite cream cheese mixed in to help w/spreadability & temper strong taste (only slightly). Sprinkled with toasted pecans & a very light drizzle of clover honey. Big hit w/guests.

Incredibly simple. Tasty, but certainly not out of this world. I am also wondering if I could have used better honey or a different cheese (used stilton).

I made these for a birthday pot-luck, and they were gone in about 60 seconds with lots of requests for the recipe. I used walnuts instead of hazelnuts. and orange blossom honey (it was all I had), which I was kind of reluctant to do, but it tasted quite good - nice combination with Maytag blue cheese. You don't need much honey, by the way -- it helps if you make a little depression in the middle of the cheese when you spread it. I experimented with balsamic vinegar (as another cook recommended), but it made the whole thing too drippy and looked very unappetizing, plus I thought the vinegar overpowered the other flavors.

Very simple yet sophisticated! A great combination of flavors and nice with a good chardonnay.

Cheese and honey! Yumm...so easy and impressive.... with a good bottle of wine...delicious!

This was easy enough, but it didn't make me go "wow!" Maybe I needed a different grade of gorgonzola?

Perfect blend of savory and sweet. Quite a hit at a cheese party i threw. Give 'em a quick zap under the broiler to melt/slightly brown the cheese. Mmmmm.

I love these! I also mixed whipped cream cheese into the gorgonzola, and I drizzled a little balsamic vinegar along with the honey. They're so good, and so easy you can put your kids to work assembling them.

This recipe is easy and delicious. It was the most requested recipe at my last party.

This was a big hit at a bunco party,i used a little cream cheese with the bluecheese to make it a little easier to spread.
