I have always stayed true to the listed recipe and have never used or seen pudding or custard as being used. Everyone who has ever tasted this wonderful and sweet trifle, have raved about how good and decadent it tasted. I truly believe it is worth it to literally follow the directions and not to take any shortcuts or add anything else to this recipe. If you do, then you take away the true taste and ambiance this special dessert calls for.

This is a great dessert. But as others have said ... do NOT sustitute pudding for the custard (which is really a zabaglione). There is no comparison in flavor or texture between the real thing and a boxed pudding mix. I make 1 1/2 times the zabaglione ... proportion seems better. I sometimes shave dark chocolate over the top for decoration. This has become our standard Christmas dinner dessert.

This is delicious and there are ways to put your signature on the recipe. Using store bought pudding is NOT one of them!!! Really, make the custard and don't be so lazy. I'm always amazed at people who look for "recipes" that begin with "buy a pound cake ...."

I just made this for Christmas dinner, and it was excellent. I used a 12-cup trifle bowl as recommended, but it wasn't quite large enough for all the ingredients -- I think a 14-cup bowl would work better and allow room for garnishing the top without overflowing. Definitely make this the day before, as the flavor is too boozy and overpowering if eaten sooner. After chilling overnight, the flavors blend beautifully, and the tartness of the berries is the perfect counterbalance to the rich cream and marsala flavored cake.

your review A Cook from berkeley, CA on 08/19/09 I've been making this recipe every Christmas for years, since it first appeared in the magazine. It has become our traditional family dessert and every year friends and family say,"you're going to make that trifle thing you always make, right?". The Marsala cream IS hot and tiring, but it is definitely worth it. Sometimes I make a home made yellow cake or a genoise, but it is still really excellent with a mix, and helps balance out the pain of whipping the cream on top of the stove. It is an exceptional dessert I will make every Christmas for the rest of my life.

Just made this for a New Year's Eve dinner party. It was absolutely delicious. I used a pound cake mix from Williams-Sonoma, and sprinkled the 3/4 cup Marsala over the cake when I assembled the dish instead of baking it in. The custard was WONDERFUL - but note that the whipping it over the stove it time consuming and hot. In general, make sure you start prepping this dessert with plenty of time so you give it adequate time to set up in the fridge. Also, I didn't see where to use the fresh raspberries in the recipe, so I folded them into the custard very gently so it wouldn't turn pink. I had to make extra whipped cream for the top because my bowl had a wide rim. I dotted the top with marcona almonds, fresh raspberries and a mint sprig. It looked and tasted fabulous!

We(mother and daughter) have made this recipe for over a decade and LOVE IT! It is simple and divine. Not sure why so many have chosen to take short cuts on an easy recipe. I was first a child when we initially made this, and given that the alcohol is cooked out, thought it was wonderful. We recommend making this recipe per the exact instructions and advise that the egg custard is really the key. Don't be lazy and make vanilla pudding, since it is fake and detracts from the true value of this wonderful(ly easy) recipe.

We sampled the zabaglione/cream with the crushed raspberries and homemade sponge cake before assembling. Each flavor shouted out with its own voice. Tart berries, savory marsala, sweet cake. We were thrilled with the combination. After sitting for 24 hours the flavors muddied. It lost its punch. Next time, I will layer the ingredients in parfait glasses and serve.

Easy, pretty, rich and delicious. Marsala is the whole point of this dessert.

Needing a Christmas dessert I went in search and found this trifle. I and my family absolutely love this dessert. Instead of making the custard filling I use CheeseCake sugar free, fat free Pudding. In fact It's being requested again for Christmas dinner. Horray for our new dessert!

Worked well. I would recommend making extra filling and pouring it over and around the servings. The cake soaked up most of what was in the dish.

I made this for Christmas last year 2005, it was amazing. Fortunately for my husband and I, everyone was very full and we had a lot of leftovers for the next day! I am looking up the recipe again today to prepare it for Super Sunday......I am sure it will be a crowd pleaser. I also used cooked vanilla pudding (2 boxes) instead of the egg custard...easy and yummy!

Bar none, the best dessert I've ever made, and in 50 years of cooking, that's a lot of desserts. Boozy, fluffy, light, decadent, sophisticated. I made my own basic sponge cake instead of using a cake mix. I also added some good grated bitter sweet chocolate on top for a garnish. Raves all around. Thank you, epicurious!

Excellent! I'll use the egg & Marsala custgard as a topping on other desserts in the future, too.

I made this for Memorial Day dinner guests, and it was a big hit. My partner runs a produce business, and I had salvaged and frozen a large quantity of local raspberries that had gotten slightly crushed in the warehouse last fall. Lots of raspberries are what make this really great. I lightened by using Alice Medrich's pudding recipe rather than all those yolks, and cooked some sweet marsala into the pudding rather than vanilla, which worked great; used full amount of marsala (also sweet) in cake mix. So my kids enjoyed also; all liquor was cooked and not overpowering. I rarely use cake mixes and was concerned about using that much marsala, but I was impressed. Very nice and beautiful trifle.

Wow... It was AMAZING. MUST make it at least 24hrs ahead so all the liquids absorbed in the cake...mmmm...Also, i dropped the wine in the cake and it was a good decision. Also, the wine in both would be too much...Also, i used very good Italian Chardonay...Also, did the "Shtik" with instant vanilla pudding/whipping cream/wine thingy instead of the eggs thingy. It Was A Hit!!! Will make it again and again...

This dessert is easy to make, stunning to look at and delicious. I made for Christmas. The group of six finished the entire dessert by the end of the evening. The abundant raspberries make it so appealing. I looked up the recipe just now because I'm making it again for an international potluck dinner this weekend.

I tried following the recipe and ended up spewing filthy words and dumping it down the drain! If you are challenged by basic cooking technicques, take my advice...use vanilla pudding mix and substitute some of the milk for marsala. Then use cool whip instead of the real stuff. The grocery store only had one bag of frozen raspberries so I used some blueberries and blackberries too. I forgot to drain them (because I didn't real the directions carefully). But I layered it all in my trifle bowl and it looked great. I took my creation to a party and everyone raved about it! I don't know if you could call it a Raspberry and Marsala Trifle, but I like to call it the "If at first you don't succeed, tri-trifle again" Trifle.

I've made this dish 3 times and people love it! The only complaint is the intensity of the marsala; most people don't mind but some have commented that it is very strong. Since children were at the last party I served this at, I made the cake mix according to the box directions (without Marsala), and used 1/2 c. Marsala and 1/2 c. water for the filling. This still turned out delicious and no complaints from anyone! Also, frozen sweetened raspberries, rinsed and drained, work really well.

I made this trifle for our dinner group's annual Progressive Christmas Dinner this year. It was great! I didn't have a trifle bowl, so I used eight balloon wine glasses instead to make individual servings. It looked really pretty and was a great way to serve the dessert. Last summer I froze a ton of raspberries and used those in this recipe--even in place of the fresh raspberries.

I made this trifle for a co-workers birthday and it got rave reviews. I absolutely loved it too! The cake made with the Marsala is scrumptious. I will never make an ordinary yellow cake again:o) I was pretty tired last night and decided not to make the egg mixture, instead I used 2 boxes of cook and serve Vanilla pudding made with 3 3/4 cups milk and 1/4 cup Marsala wine. I also blended the Raspberries in the blender and then ran them through a strainer to omit almost all the seeds which everyone appreciated. I can't wait to make this trifle for Christmas! I would also make just the cake in a bundt pan to give as gifts. It has such a wonderful flavor and people would never guess it was a box mix!

So good, so pretty, so easy! On Christmas eve however, unsweetened rasberries were hard to find! Had to use sweetened but just rinsed and drained them. Still great. OK to make the cake a day ahead.

It was beautiful and delicious. The package cake mix and frozen berries made it very easy. A few bites wouldn't fit into my trifle bowl which allowed me a small sneak preview. Everyone loved it on New Year's Eve.

I prepared this trifle for Christmas dinner this year. All my guests loved it. It was quite easy to prepare, delicious and looked beautiful. I would like to try it with perhaps a different fruit too. One suggestion - if there are children among your guests prepare something else for them.

I've made this half a dozen times, it is exceptional. people rave, and it is spectacular looking. tip: make the cake from scratch, it's great from a box, but homemade takes it over the top.
