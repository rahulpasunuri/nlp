This was just fantastic. I didn't grill it on the coals, actually didn't grill it at all, but used a cast-iron skillet and seared it to perfection, as I typically do with steaks. The pepper stir-fry really made this extraordinary! Was simply perfect.

This was a great recipe and a fun way to cook. I used two cuts because my grocery did not have any porterhouses. The thick cut cowboy bone in ribeyes did fantastic at exactly 4 minutes a side, could have been a little less for medium rare. The thick strip steaks, while thicker than the ribeyes, cooked much quicker and were a medium at best. So i would do them again at 3 minutes max. But the chile saute is delicious. I served with roasted sweet potatoes and it was amazing. Will def use this recipe again. I did find the use of a hair dryer very helpful, both for ash removal and stoking the fire.

Seriously, the best steak I've ever eaten. Simple seasoning of salt & pepper. Incredible flavor, juiciness, and crust. The bell pepper stir fry enhanced the meat extremely well. Must do with the recommended charcoal. We had no residue that needed to be brushed off of steaks. Amazing!!

Move over Tuscan, the Caveman has arrived! We have always used the "Tuscan Steak" method from Cooks Illustrated. This new way of placing the meat directly on the coals was faster and actually produced a better result in terms of outside crispness, inside juciness and overall taste. Having the coals accessible for the cast iron pan produced excellent peppers.

This was the best steak we have EVER had. So simple, but so perfect, and the poblano pan fry was a huge hit....great flavors poured over the meat.
