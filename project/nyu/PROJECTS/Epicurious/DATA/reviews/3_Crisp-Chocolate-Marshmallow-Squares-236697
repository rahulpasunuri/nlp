These are really good, particularly the ganache. The recipe makes plenty of ganache so you may want to double the recipe for the marshmallow squares.

I did not make the ganache, but the kids loved the squares! Not too sweet.

Love this recipe. My son doesn't care for dark chocolate so, I didn't add at first. I found him dipping his into the ganache and decided to add it. He loved It. Will make this often.

Too chocolatey, gooey & sickly for me. I followed the recommendations of previous reviewers and added a little more butter and a few more marshmallows to prevent them being too dry, then cut the whole thing in half before sandwiching together with the ganache, which, incidentally, I had heaps of left over. I'm curious to see what my colleagues and family think when I share them out tomorrow!

Brought these to the winery I work at to pair with our Late Harvest Zinfandel. They were gone in half an hour. Kids and adults loved them, and went excellent with the Zinfandel.

Most important: More marshmallows. For the amount of rice krispies called for, I would guess at 20 - 25 large marshmallows instead of the recommended 15, which yielded far too dry and crunchy a texture. Probably a bit more butter as well. The granache turned out brilliantly. But we'll definitely perfect it and make it again.

thanks to the chef who said to cut the sheet in half - it makes it so much easier! that said, i will not make again. a waste of a delectable ganache on rice krispy squares. the components taste good seperately but not combined. do yourself a favor and just make the regular rice krispy treats and use your best chocolates for another recipe.

Tasty. It's much faster to cut the sheet in half, spread the ganache on 1 half and then top it with the other half. Drizzle the ganache on and THEN cut into squares with a large hot knife. The recipe's directions for assembly are tedious and time consuming.

These were too salty and too boozy. I also didn't care for the addition of cocoa to the rice krispy squares. It was an interesting concept, so I will try again with some major modifications.

A delightful twist on a children's classic. I have never made Rice crispy Treats even though I have children. They just seem to hurt your teeth and I was very protective of my kids' teeth (all grown and no cavities). So when I saw this I thought why not? Wonderful with the mocha flavored ganache!
