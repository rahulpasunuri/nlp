I like the flavors of this cake. If I made it again, I'd punch 1/4-inch holes throught the top of the cake, about halfway down, before pouring the syrup over the top. Otherwise, the cake doesn't readily soak up the syrup except where it pools up around the edge.

I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup, soaked the apricots in hot water and lemon juice before chopping them up, substituted pan roasted almonds for walnuts and changed the orange for lemon in the syrup (and eliminated the liqueur). Kind of a different cake, but great!

I was very excited to try this recipe, but was disappointed in the results. I followed it precisely, yet the cake did not rise very much. It tasted ok, but I think it needs more baking powder or soda to fluff it up a bit. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know!

Ridiculous person (Cook on 5/4/01). 'Friable' means 'easily crumbled', as you would know if you had consulted your dictionary before sneering at someone else's use of a perfectly appropriate word. Great cake, by the way.

what the heck is "friable"? pliable? fry-able? geez. . .

Even after I monkeyed around with some of the ingredients, this cake turned out much better than I expected. I used whole wheat pastry flour, 2 tbsp butter and 1/3 cup applesauce (instead of a stick of butter), and about 1/2 cup of sugar. The cake was still quite moist and with the orange honey syrup, almost a bit too sweet for my taste. Using strained yogurt is a fine innovation -- makes the cake's texture rich and friable. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes apricots!
