I was less than impressed with this recipe and I am not picky. I made it last night and found it bland. I added water chester, per a reviewer's suggestion but it didn't help. The highlight was the pork. If you ate it alone it was good. If you ate it as part of the stir fry, it was lost. It might have been better if the sauce was thicker and more flavorful (ie some ginger, etc.) I will not make this again

Wow! Delicious! Easy, yummy. I usually add a couple tablespoons of fresh minced ginger when I add the garlic. I also double the recipe because I like leftovers. I've made it 3 times already!!

I added dry mustard and powdered ginger to give some more dimension to the flavor. Very very good.

Really quick! A nice combination of ingredients, though i like my stir fry to have a little sweetness and the teriyaki sauce i used seemed to be lacking in that department so i added a tablespoon of brown sugar. It made all the difference.

This was a quick and easy weeknight meal. I agree somewhat with the cook from Los Altos because the meal really could've used another veg in the mix, but that is amended easily enough.

This recipe had no flavor or interesting texture. Water chestnuts and/or sliced carrots might have saved it, but I would just skip this one and make something else.

I have been stir frying for many years and typically add ingredients in longest to shortest cook time. This recipe directs preperation in a manner I hadn't prior used. Doing a little precooking goes a long way to maintain the individual character of each ingredient as well as assuring ideal "doneness" for each. A rocking good recipe. Make sure to get a good pork loin and slice it nice and thin.
