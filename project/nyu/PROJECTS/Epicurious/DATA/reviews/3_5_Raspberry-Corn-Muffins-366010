These muffins were a mess. The fresh raspberries made them mushy and a weird purplish color stained the muffin around the berries. We threw most of them to the raccoons.

These muffins were very surprising! They are lighter and larger than I thought they would be. I used blueberries rather than raspberries but now I want to try raspberry. I also used stone ground cornmeal. The timing and ingredients are accurate and great.

Good, but not special enough to save the recipe in my folders. Raspberry is MUCH tastier (and more special) than blueberry. I would make it again until I find something really great.

Made these for a ladies brunch for 140 ppl. They were terrific! I loved the subtle sweetness and the tart raspberry paired with it. I also made some with blueberries and they too came out great. I like the raspberry pairing better flavor wise but remember when you used the raspberries, the muffin around the berry will be a little discolored to a purple/grey. Wish raspberries didn't do that, but they do and it doesn't distract front the outstanding taste! Loved them!

These muffins were great and had just the perfect touch of sweetness. They can be used as a side to a main course or with a cup of coffee for breakfast. I followed the recipe exactly and found that if you use silicone muffin pans 20 minutes of cook time is a tad too long (not burnt but a little too brown). Next time I'll try 15 minutes.
