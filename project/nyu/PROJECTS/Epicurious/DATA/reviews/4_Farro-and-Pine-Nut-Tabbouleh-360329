I prepared the recipe exactly as written and for me, like another reviewer, the onion was overpowering. I also didn't like the texture of the farro as much as a "normal" bulgur version. Tasty enough, but not a do-over for me.

Made this for my boyfriend and I on a hot summer night for dinner. Did not cool it or marinate for 20 minutes simply cuz we were too hungry to wait. No jalapeno, and did a half lemon and one lime instead of a full lemon. No salt or pepper. Also used less parsley, maybe half a cup at most. We were freaking out over how awesome it was and how we could eat it every day.

This recipe was great!! So fresh! We found farro in the grain section of Whole Foods. I would add a whole jalapeno instead of half, and add some extra lemon juice. I found the onion to be a bit overpowering, but maybe that's just me. This recipe was great though...definitely will be making this again!

Wow! Was not expecting such a luscious rich flavor from a simple tabbouleh! I skipped the jalapeno (had none) but it was fine without. Also, I used garbanzo beans that had been marinating in lemon juice & garlic for several days. And I cooked my farro in a beef stock. This is my new favorite salad!

This dish is fantastic. I couldn't find farro in my local grocery store so I used quinoa. Same ratio of water applies: 2 cups of water to 1 cup of quinoa.

Very good summer dish. I didn't have pine nuts on hand so I substituded toasted slivered almonds. Added extra peperoncino, fresh from the garden, and chopped basil instead of parsley. It deserves to be made again. I thought it was fairly easy to make and super quick. We ate some fresh mozzarella with it. Good stuff!

I made the farro in the rice cooker, 2.5c chicken stock, 1 cup farro. It take a looong time, so plan accordingly. came out a tad wet, but I dried it out when cooling in refrigerator. also dumped in the goo from seeding the tomatoes, yumm. skipped the olive oil, did not miss it. flexible recipe for the summer- throw in any fresh or lightly sauteed veggies you have on hand. the lemon juice is key.

I make this kind of salad all the time - just made a very similar one today with barley. A small but tasty improvement: before boiling the farro, toast it in the pan with some olive oil and perhaps a bay leaf, some fresh herbs, chili (if you like spice) and even (if you like fragrance) a cinnamon stick. Then when it's all cooked you can discard them, but they make the farro more aromatic. Also: I find it much easier to toast the pinoli (or any kind of nut) in a dry pan on the stove, that way you can make sure they don't burn. Just throw all your favorite flavors in... and enjoy!!
