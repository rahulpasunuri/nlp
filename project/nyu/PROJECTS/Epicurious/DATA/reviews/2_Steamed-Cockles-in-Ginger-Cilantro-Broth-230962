I should preface this review by saying that I really enjoy "subtle" flavors. Sushi is my favorite food on the planet. I find delicate white tea delightful. Etc. That said, this dish was unbelievably flavorless. Even after decreasing the water by half, as well as simmering the broth ingredients separately for a few minutes, the "broth" pretty much tasted like faintly oceanic water - not ginger, not cilantro, and definitely not even a whiff of Sherry. There are so many truly delicious, flavorful recipes out there... this one's a dud.

Lovely and simple to make soup. Served it as an appetizer while camping last summer and it'll show up on my Asian New Year's celebration in Feb as well.For a change of pace followed this recipe to the letter, LOL.
