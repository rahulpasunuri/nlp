Easy, and a really good use for a melon lacking in flavor. The lime and cardamom flavors go very well together.

I would highly recommend this recipe. It was a great combination of flavors, and not too difficult. I was on a very constained schedule and had to use the freezer for part of the chilling, but it was excellent nonetheless.

Delicious. Elegant. Pretty. An excellent combination of flavors; my guests loved it. Even so, next time I will pour the syrup over the melon in advance, and chill the whole thing for a few hours--the leftovers this morning were even better for having macerated. Tossing in a cardomon pod or two while making the syrup might make for a more evenly suffused cardamon taste. Perhaps also the juice from the melon might replace some or all of the water in the syrup. The vanilla cream is lovely--rich-tasting without being terribly fatty--I didn't even realize this was a low-fat recipe until I logged in just now!

Delightful; even more so with the Vanilla Cream garnish.
