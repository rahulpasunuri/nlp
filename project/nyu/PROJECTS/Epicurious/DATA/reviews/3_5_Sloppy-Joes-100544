This is excellent. It's all the necessary ingredients to make a great sloppy joe. I was missing tomato sauce so I substituted tomato juice, it turned out great.

have made this twice, halfing the recipe with the only excption of using 2 jalapeno's. i used valentino hot sauce instead of the tabasco. With a toased white bun you can't go wrong with this one.

Could I possibly give it less than one fork? At first glance, this recipe sounds great. Really wanted to like it. Especially since it isn't as sweet as some sloppy joe recipes seem to be. Complete waste of 2 pounds of ground beef. Too much onion (although I did dice it very fine which could have been part of the problem). Even with ample salt it was still horrible. I was surprised how just one teaspoon of Tabasco sauce could make it so "vinegary". Sorry...

Big hit! I made a few minor changes according to our family's preferences and what we had available (no jalapeno, for example), and we all loved it. My husband was craving sloppy joe's, and this his the spot. My 2 year old gobbled it up!

big fan of this recipe. made with one onion but that was enough. the only drawback was the whole jalapeno was a bit too much heat for me. added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar and 2 teaspoons of mustard powder. everyone enjoyed. would def make again

I was out of almost everything at home and had to come up with a receipe using ground beef. I used a can of tomato paste and added 1/2 cup of water instead of using tomato sauce. It turned out perfect! I will make it again for sure!

Rating: 1
This recipe is very bland and needed a lot of tweaking to suit our taste. I omitted the green pepper and tabasco, upped the tomato sauce and tomato paste, added barbecue sauce with the ketchup. The mixture was quite dry, so I added chicken stock to make it wetter and add flavor. Only used 1/2 a jalapeno, but would use the whole one next time. Also added a lot of black pepper. With those changes, we loved it!

This is a great basic sloppy joe recipe. I did make a couple changes to suit my taste. I omitted the ketchup and instead added 1 1/2 c. bbq sauce, which provided a nice smoky flavor and creamier consistency.

Rating: 4
This is great. I mean, it's Sloppy Joe's, but it's still great. I discovered that there is a lot of flexibility in the recipe. You can leave out or sub a few ingredients and it's still good. For example, I somehow managed to not have tomato sauce or tomato paste on hand, but a blended raw tomato, extra Worcestershire and some wine vinegar instead worked fine. Oh, and I used a yellow pepper instead of green, and a little chipotle in adobo instead of a jalapeno. It was just a milder flavor, but really, really good. Chop the veggies very small (like 1/4 inch max) and it comes out great.

I have made this a couple of times. It beats the canned kind hands down. For those who think there are too many veggies. Let them cook down till very soft to make more of a ragu.

this is a great base recipe, but one that needs adjustments - I left out the ketchup, and used brown sugar, some red wine, and ground coriander and cumin. It was delicious, and a definite keeper - but it needs some doctoring...

This is great! Trader Joe's sells 3- 1lb paks organic GB. I used one Lb & added 3 T brn sug, 2 Tsp cider vinegar, 1 T mustard and NO HOT stuff and still was flavorful (just not hot) IMy wife even said she'd try it.

I like this recipe because there's no need to be exact. You can just add more or less of whatever you have on hand. I do like to add plenty of extra liquid (beer or stock is great) so I can really simmer it, and also some chili powder or cajun spice blend. It also freezes perfectly for quick meals.

This was a very tasty recipe. I probably needed to chop the veggies a bit smaller and I used a hot sauce that was way to hot because I was out of tabasco. I used Dave's insanity hot sauce (1/2 t) and steam was coming out of my ears and I love hot! But overall the flavor was great and everyone enjoyed. topped sandwich with a bit of cheddar cheese.

This was good, but I had to make the adjustments suggested by previous reviewers to have it taste like the Sloppy Joe's we love. I have also tried Rachael Ray's Super Sloppy Joe's and prefer that recipe because it's perfect just as written.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe, with a few mods per the other reviewers. I added the recommended apple cider vinegar, dry mustard, and brown sugar. I also used ground turkey breast instead of ground beef, and added extra of all the liquid ingredients as there didn't seem to be enough (a sloppy joe is supposed to be sloppy, right?) The other good hint here is to simmer the mixture a long time, as that really deepens the flavor. I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe. I add 1 -2 tablespoons of fennel seeds (or to taste). It adds a really interesting flavor.

For sloppy joes, this is a great recipe. They tasted a lot better than the ones I had growing up. I didn't think any changes were needed. Don't leave out the jalepano or celery...they add taste and texture. (take the seeds out of the jalepano) Know what you're putting in your body...throw those cans away.

I thought this was a great dish. I also think its funny when people say that certain dishes are not good but they are not even following the recipe thats listed. How can you review a recipe when you havent even used the items listed in the recipe? You people make me laugh!

I tried this upon a sudden and strong craving for sloppy joes, but not having any canned sauce in the house. I never would have thought to make it from scratch before, but wow. This was really good, and nicely spicy. I followed the suggested additions of brown sugar, mustard seed, and cider vinegar. I substituted a chipotle for the jalapeno (they're basically the same after all) and used a red bell pepper because they were what I had on hand. I was out of celery, so left that out as well - sounded like it would be an odd-tasting addition to me anyway. Definitely making this again!

Rating: 3
very, very good! used half the amount of beef, double the worchestershire, followed the recs and added mustard (not dry though), vinegar and brown sugar. i substituted the jalapeno for local birds-eye chillies (about 5 of em... yes, we are crazy folk!) and the end result was quite good! amazing flavours and texture, and as an asian who has never tried sloppy joes before (except from a nasty recipe from betty crocker), this is addictive and fun stuff! will definitely do again.

A great sophisticated take on a comfort food from childhood. Love the adaptability. After several days of rich holiday food this was great. Added the brown sugar, vinegar and mustard as others suggested. Also, didn't have a few items, so substituted chipotles and roasted red pepper for the jalapeno and the bell pepper and used additional tomato sauce for the paste. Both my husband and I loved it and we'll make it again.

I've never made Sloppy Joe's before, but these were wonderful and quite easy. I skipped the jalapeno because of the kids, but pretty much followed the recipe as written (added a bit more tomato paste). It seemed a bit "tart" so I followed the previous reviewers advice and added 2T brown sugar, 2t cider vinegar and about 2t dry mustard...perfect. I let it simmer (uncovered, then covered) for quite a while and the end result was delicious.

This is a great recipe! I left out the celery and the jalapeno, and it was just the right spiciness. A great casual dinner. I made half the recipe but used the whole amount of the sauces. It was a little too much sauce so added more meat. Will definitely use this one on a regular basis.

I thought that this recipe must be in error because there simply wasn't enought sauce... forget about reducing the liquid, there just wasn't any. I doubled all the liquid ingredients, and that brought it up to the correct proportions, and it was quite tasty.

Today was a grilling day that got "rained out." With people waiting around, this was the alternative. Easy & tasty. Most everything was on hand in the pantry. I halved recipe.

Really easy and tasty. We ate it with dense Italian country bread. I doubled the tomato paste and as suggested by earlier reviewers-- added 4 tablespoons of brown sugar and 3 table spoons of white vinegar (didn't have any cider vinegar). It was just a little bit too sweet, so next time I'll start with only 2 Tbsp sugar and then add to taste.

Using veggie ground beef substitute (12 oz), this recipe turned out very well. I halved the recipe (except for the jalapeno and tomato sauce) and added a tsp of mustard powder (my Mom's recipe used mustard powder). I think the next time, I'll add some brown sugar and more mustard powder. Yum.

This is a good base recipe but some might like to try these changes/additions. Brown the meat first, remove beef and the grease from the pan. Brown onions first in olive oil, when they soften add sliced fresh mushrooms, bell pepper if you like, add the garlic last so it doesn't burn. Instead of tomato paste and sauce, try equal amounts (more or less) of ketchup and water. Season with salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, jerk seasonings, southwestern seasonings or whatever you like. Add the beef back to the pan and simmer, simmer, simmer. The flavors intensify as time goes on.

I made this recipe for 50 people who were at an all day event. Had the hamburger and vegetables pre cooked and dumped eveything into a roaster and simmered it all morning. Left out the jalepena peppers and added extra tomato sause, tomato paste and brown sugar. It was a hit and there were people disappointed on Sunday that we weren't having the same sloppy joes again. I think one of the secrets here to simmer for a long time.

Geez, I hate giving less than 3 forks but just can't go that far with this one. I added cider vinegar and brown sugar as per another reviewer's suggestion but the sauce just didn't kick or really, I felt, have any flavour. Maybe if I had used BBQ sauce instead of tomato sauce and ketchup? Sigh, really for 10% less flavour, I'll go 90% less effort next time and open up the Manwich can.

This did not go over well in our house...my fiance felt that he might have liked it before he met me, but that he has become snobbier about food since then because I normally cook more gourmet things.

To the guy who claims this dish is in reality Cuban Picadillo. Your history of the dish is probably accurate. However given that this dish is not called "picadillo," and given that most Americans are not in Havana, Cuba, and given that the original Havana bar call Sloppy Joes probably doesn't even exist any longer, thanks to Senior Castro. I doubt this was ever intended to be authentic Cuban Picadillo. Now, you can go right ahead and do whatever you want to do to any Cuban that makes this recipe. However for us Americans who love American(ized)"Sloppy Joe" sandwiches this recipe is great, and probably a heck of a lot better than the original.

During the Thirties, a bar by the wharfs in Havana, Cuba, introduced to foreign sailors what was a famous cuban dish: "picadillo". Since the name of the bar was "The Sloppy Joe" the dish took that name outside of Cuba. By the way, Sloppy Joe is, today, the name of a bar in Key West,Florida, but the original was the one in Havana. Anyhow, no picadillo or sloppy joe was ever cooked in Cuba using: celery, jalapeno pepper, ketchup, tabasco sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Any cook guilty of doing so would have been drowned in Havana harbor. Wrong recipe. Gets a Big O from me or any other cuban.

This was okay, as in just-only okay. Did not like the BBQ sauce (it was too sweet) and while it was hot, it was hot without corresponding flavor--something just seemed "off" about it. However, it is a valuable recipe in that there are very, very few sloppy joe recipes out there (I have 70+ cookbooks, and the only one I could find was in the "50 things" cookbook for turkey joes, although admittedly I couldn't locate my Joy of Cooking). So the value of this recipe is that it gives you a place to begin your own joe experimenting. Tonight I am making it again, but this time I'm substituting tomato sauce for the BBQ sauce, and I think I'll skip the jalapeno but add chili powder. Also: I admit that perhaps the version I made was with TVP instead of meat, so perhaps that adversely affected the flavor of the original.

Rating: 3
Great for a quick dinner: I made this in about 15 minutes while talking with a friend on the phone! (The cooking time for the cooked meat with sauces was only 5-10 minutes). I don't like celery, so I didn't use that, but I still thought these were excellent, particularly on toasted buns with spicy sweet potato fries.
