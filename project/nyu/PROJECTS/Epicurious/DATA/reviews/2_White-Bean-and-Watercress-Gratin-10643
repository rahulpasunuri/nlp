Agree....with the person who said bland..saved the leftovers to the freezer.....but think I will probably pitch them....a failure.!

Made this during a snowstorm, hoping for something much better than we got. Too bland!! Got a couple meals out of it but eventually had to throw out, as it was too tasteless to finish. Couldn't figure out what would possibly improve upon it.

Easy weekday meal, that really sticks-to-your ribs, perfect for a cool night. I substituted one package of thawed frozen chopped spinach for the watercress and thought it even tastier.
