I have made this cake more times than I can count. And it always stops the show! For the frosting, I use a mascarpone, sour cream blend that just has a bit of a bit to cut some of the fabulous sweet....and if you have eaters who love frosting, this cake cuts very well to make even more layers. Thank you, Aunt Tom!

This cake has been love at first bite for everyone who's had it. Two years ago we were in Ashville, NC and had a wonderful Italian Cream Cake at a local tearoom. My partner "went on" about it and I decided to try to make one for his birthday. I found the Aunt Tom's recipe and with all the positive reviews I figured I couldn't go wrong. I didn't. I do several mods: all butter and no margarine in either cake or frosting; 1 1/2 times the frosting recipe; and added pecans and coconut for garnish. I get a 12 oz bag of pecans and a 14 oz bag of coconut and toast both. I use the indicated amount of pecans and coconut in the cake and then use the remainder to press into the frosting as a garnish. Usually I put the pecans on top and the coconut on the sides but I've reversed them and even mixed them together. It's all good. We also prefer it to chill overnight in the refrigerator before serving but on the occasions when that hasn't happened it hasn't really affected the consumption. This cake has pretty much become my required contribution to family functions and I'm happy to oblige. We all have to agree that this isn't anything like diet food. With the added pecans and coconut as garnish and extra frosting we're looking at something considerably north of the 800 calories per 1/16th that others have posted. I consider it to be a decadent treat and definitely wouldn't make it for someone with dietary restrictions.

This is a great recipe and is a wonderful little taste of home whenever I make it. Crisco and vegetable shortening are difficult to get here in Australia, and its nice to reduce the amount of fat in the recipe anyway. As a result, I use roughly half butter and half apple sauce in place of the margarine and shortening in the cake recipe. It always turns out beautifully and the mild apple flavor is a welcome addition.

Thanks to other reviewers for their comments about using half veggie shortening and half butter. Very sweet, but many guests have said it is the best cake they have ever had. I make this cake for many special occasions and it is always a hit!

I have made this cake year after year and never changed anything except more butter for shortening. It is the most decadent cake I know that doesn't isn't chocolate. I am going to make it today and don't have the sweetened coconut so I am going to use a technique I found on e-how and soak my unsweetened coconut in milk for 30 minutes, pat dry and add 4 tsp more of sugar to the recipe.

This cake is huge and delicious! I substituted a stick of butter for some of the shortening, and toasted the nuts, but those were the only changes I made. I had some trouble getting it out of the pans, there was some crumbling, but nothing I couldn't fix with a little extra frosting. Made this for a co-worker's birthday, and now there are very high expectations for my next cake!

If you love carrot cake you will love this recipe! The cake is spectacular on it's own and I usually save any leftover scraps for breakfast the next day. I make it using 2 8-inch cake pans and cut them in half so that I have four layers. I also increase the cream cheese by another half package; probably use about 3/4 of a pound of confectioner's sugar; increase the teaspoon of vanilla to 1 1/2 teaspoons and add 1 1/2 cups coconut and 1 cup pecans to the frosting. I recommend roasting the pecans in the oven for about 10 minutes to bring out the flavor. Oh and i've replaced the shortening with olive oil on one occasion and applesauce on another being that I didn't have shortening on hand both times the cakes came out wonderfully!

Perfect! Simple, moist, flavorful. I made it as a birthday cake for an Italian friend, served it at a party of 10 and there was not one piece left -- everyone had seconds! I did add a half teaspoon of almond flavoring (in addition to the vanilla) to the frosting. Yummy.

First of all, yes I changed some things...I used butter instead of margarine for the cake batter and the frosting. In the batter, I changed the ratio of shortening/butter to 1 cup/1 cup. I used 2 9" cake pans and then sliced each layer in half to make a total of 4 layers. I also doubled the frosting ingredients, except for the sugar. I only used 1 pound of that and it is plenty sweet. The cake is amazingly good!!! Trust me-it will be a hit, but is not something that can be had on a regular basis (at least not in my household.) I sliced mine into 16 pieces and each piece is a hefty 800 calories.

This cake was a hit at Thanksgiving. For fat in the cake I used 3/4 cup butter-flavored shortening and 1 cup butter. The texture of the cake was wonderful. For frosting I doubled cream cheese and vanilla, substituted butter for margarine and doubled that but used only 1 box confectioners' sugar. It was still a little sweet for my taste, but no one else complained! A delicious, easy cake that is definitely a keeper.

DukeD from Maryland: You are free to NOT read the comments; they are here for those of us who may not have all the ingredients on hand (substitutions have been a part of baking since the first cookie was made). This is a very good cake. Subtle flavors, good texture. And, yes, I used all butter, no margarine (that stuff is gross! Ewww!).

I'm not sure about all these reviews saying use this and use that... don't use this and don't use that. I always thought you were supposed to review THIS recipe.... not your version of it. Nothing wrong with being creative.... but people are interested in what the recipe tastes like... not necessarily what you like. Anyway, enough editorializing......I prepared this cake exactly as the recipe states.... it was terrific. Everyone wanted the recipe. It was really special.

I love this recipe with a few modifications: 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. shortening, i split the layers and filled them with raspberry jam diluted with amaretto, pressed toasted coconut on the outside and for extra flash decorated the top as noted in the orange marmalade carrot cake recipe on this site. A big hit at a work potluck.

P.S. from previous review...I use real butter, always, and use parchment paper. Grease the pan, lay the parchment paper in, lightly grease the paper and lightly dust with flour. It falls right out of the pan...piece of cake (ha...a bad pun)

Of all the different cakes I make, this is the best and most popular. I just made it for my brother-in-law for his birthday and we demolished it. It is my favorite, and I don't like coconut. It is a little bit of extra work, but don't let it throw you...it is worth it. I double the frosting recipe because I found making it as is is not enough. I also add extra powdered sugar because I don't want it to be so creamy it slides down the side of the cake. The first time I baked it I was worried because the layers looked so brown, but they tasted great and it was not dry...just the way it is supposed to be. I also put chopped pecans on top.

Took previous reviewers' suggestions and used 1 cup Crisco and 1 cup butter. Also made chocolate ganache for between layers, toasted coconut for decoration and used only 1/2 lb. of the 10X sugar for icing....all suggested by other reviewers. Thanks. It was really wonderful. I brushed layers with straight Amaretto which was a very subtle taste. Maybe I will add it to the ganache next time. I was worried that using the top 1/3 of the oven @ 375 was too warm and the layers did start to brown quickly...but it did not seem to impact the flavor. I froze a portion of the cake(so I won't eat it all!!). Now I'm anxious to see how well it tastes when slowly defrosted.

I adjusted this recipe according to some of the prior reviews and then for high altitude. I was a bit nervous about the number of changes but it was quite a hit. 1.25 cups of sugar 1.5 cups of butter instead of shortening and margarine no change to eggs no change to flour .75 teaspoon of baking soda .5 teaspoon of salt 1.5 c of buttermilk toasted 1/2 of coconut and 1/2 of pecans frosting: 8 oz of cream cheese 1 stick of butter 1 tea of vanilla .75 lb of powdered sugar I used two 8 inch round cake pans and cooked them at 395 for about an hour. It was still a bit greasy out of the pan but won rave reviews from my tasters!

With apologies to Aunt Tom, I make this so often, it is now my cake. Everyone always loves it. I make it pretty much as the recipe requires, but make extra frosting. I don't have any trouble getting the layers out of the pan - I just use parchment paper and grease...it just falls out of the pan.

I altered the cake a little bit since I hate using fake food to cook with. I used a little bit of shortening and substituted butter for the rest as well as for all of the margarine. Even with all the changes it was still an amazingly sweet and dense cake, as it should be. I made two cakes so I made one big double batch of icing and I think I used a pound of sugar with double the cream cheese and and butter and it was extremely sweet. I definitely recommend adding the sugar a little bit at a time and testing it from time to time.

Rating: 4
I made this as posted. I doubled the frosting and followed suggestions to use 1 pound of confectioners' sugar. It was perfect. I also added a couple things per suggestions. I drizzled 1/2 shot of frangelico between layers prior to frosting, I used sliced bananas between the layers. I also used hazelnuts instead of pecans. This cake was very popular at a party I attended and I have shared the recipe. Its delicious!

I made this last night for a friend's first mother's day (May 10 here in Mexico). I followed some of the suggestions given by other reviewers and also adjusted for our altitude (over 7000 feet). Added an egg because the eggs here are on the small side, cut the sugar back to 1.5 c, used unsalted butter in place of the shortening, and a cup of homemade yogurt for the buttermilk since buttermilk doesn't exist here (my Irish friend says that type of yogurt is called kefir or bulgarian yogurt on her side of the pond). Then baked in a 9x13 pyrex dish for 40 min at 350 F and then 20 min at 375 F. For the frosting I doubled the amounts of cream cheese and vanilla and used equal amounts margarine and butter. Then I added the sugar little by little until it seemed sweet enough...no idea how much, maybe a cup. I cut the 9x13 in half and made it a two layer cake that has been getting rave reviews all morning. No expectations for this to be like a carrot cake...it's Italian cream cake pure and simple just like I remember from my Texas childhood.

Rating: 2
Maybe my expectations were raised, but this recipe just didn't do it for me. It was reminiscent of a carrot cake without carrots. You can, however, halve the recipe into two baking pans for a smaller torte-like cake and the frosting does lend itself to a pretty presentation. Will keep looking, however, for a different coconut cake recipe.

I can't imagine the amount of butter/shortening is correct in this recipe - 2 cups!!? Look around at any other Italian Cream Cake recipe; they are all quite similar and call for 1 cup (commonly 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c veg. shortening) I have never seen a cake recipe with this amount of fat. Yes I did make it as printed and it came out very greasy looking, reminding me of an oily carrot cake. Unfortunately I sent the cake with my husband to some relatives and I am not able to rate my opinion of the taste/outcome. I just wanted to alert others to the possibility that there is a typo here in this recipe. I was attracted to try it after seeing all the rave reviews but after I made it I did more research and frankly I am a little grossed out at using as much butter/shortening as this calls for and will not make this again unless to try it with 1 cup total. What does everyone else think?

I love the results I get from recipes where I carefully read the reviews before attempting to bake! Yes, the first batch did NOT want to come out of the pans and when it did ... disaster! I lined the pans with was paper and oil, and the second batch came out perfect. I omitted coconut and nuts, and added banana to the frosting in between each layer. I also doubled the cream cheese, butter and vanilla in the frosting recipe (using only 1 box of sugar), and it was perfect! Plus I had enough frosting left over to decorate the cake. One of the comments I received was "spectacular!" Next time I might try a kahlua drizzle with the bananas.

Fantastic! I made this cake for a birthday dinner party and it was fit for a king. Everyone raved and several guests had seconds. THANKS to all the reviewers for the great suggestions-- I used only butter, substituting for the shortening and margarine. I decreased the sugar in the cake to 1.75 cups, increasing the buttermilk by 0.25 cup, and also halved the sugar in the frosting. I filled the layers with Meyer lemon curd, and topped the frosted cake with toasted coconut. Spectacular presentation, and so moist and delicious. Can't wait to make it again!

This was a great recipie. Instead of the cream cheese icing, I made a white chocolate buttercream & filled it with a white chocolate ganache. I omitted the coconut (for those who were allergic) and followed the advice of some others, including the crumb coat (rum, butter & sugar) and cutting the sugar (I just omitted 1/4 cup). The cake was a great success.

This is a fabulous (very rich, not for the calorie-conscious) cake. My step-mom and I share birthdays, so we made this together. She doesn't like coconut, so omitting it didn't change the rest of the recipe at all. We added a drop or 2 of butter flavoring--almost over the top. Also, it's ok to make cream cheese frosting with a LOT less sugar! YUM!

A lovely, incredibly delicious cake. Per other reviewers I used 1 cup butter and 1 cup butter flavored shortening in the cake and had no trouble with the cake crumbling, or any difficulty in removing it from the pans. I doubled the frosting recipie, while only using 1 box of confectioners sugar and the result was a delicious, not too sweet frosting that complemented the coconut beautifully. This will be a standard special occasion cake at my house from now on.

Okay, this was so good! It wasn't as large a cake as I was expecting but it did feed about 15-16 people. Some with really itsy bitsy slices. It was moist, and just overall a great cake. I did have a problem with the sides being too hard. But no one seemed to mind. Also, followed another reviewers suggestion of buttered, floured pan and buttered, floured parchment paper, otherwise could have been a hard to get out of pan without breaking. Also put coconut in icing (doubled icing w/o doubling sugar, very good), and half pecan pieces on top. Great!

This is a wonderful recipe. I have made this cake for several weddings and gatherings.

An over-the-top cake!! I made this for my Dad's Father's Day/Birthday Party last weekend, as Italian Cream Cake is his all-time favorite, and everyone loved this delicious cake - I followed other reviewers suggestions, using 1 c shortening & 1 cup butter, made 2X frosting, but using only 1 1/2 X confectiners sugar. I also made a syrup using 1/4 butter, 1/3 cup rum and 1/4 sugar, warmed until the sugar dissolved, and brushed this over each layer prior to frosting. Also toasted the pecans, and then garnished with toasted fresh coconut. Was asked when I was going into business selling them; could not have asked for a better cake. Had no trouble with crumbling, but did use caution w/ parchment, buttering & flouring, etc. I will definitely make this again when I need a special occasion cake. Considered using pastry tip to do fancier frosting, but the toasted coconut on smoothed icing gave a very elegant look. (I found some beautiful, very large flake fresh coconut)

Wow, what a great cake! I read all the reviews, and hints. I wanted to avoid a crumbly cake, so I used 1 cup butter and 1 cup butter crisco. I eliminated the coconut from the cake, and instead toasted it and put it on the frosting, in case I had crumbles anyway. I toasted the pecans, before I put them in the batter. Everyone was raving about the cake. I will keep this recipe!!

Very very good - it was all said and gone in 60 seconds. Mine wasn't crumbly, but then again I used cake flour and buttered non-stick pans (as I always do when making cakes, as well as jumbo eggs instead of large). My cake was very moist and flavorfull. I too made 2x the frosting/filling but only used 1.5 boxes of sugar. THIS WAS PLENTY! Two pounds would be too too sweet IMHO. I have been told to make it again and don't change a thing.

I was happy to see that the reviewer below had the same problem I did with the this cake being crumbly. I've made it about ten times and love it, and have learned to grease the pans, then add a wax round, then grease that, then flour the whole thing! the edges don't stick any more, but they really do crumble. I try to brush them gently and then use a crumb coating of frosting. I use about 1.5 times the amount of frosting as well. This is an outstanding cake--I've had rave reviews every time I've served it and it's great for a big crowd, since it is sizeable.

This is a wonderful cake, and I will definately make it again. I wanted to add some footnotes while they are fresh in my mind. The cake is very crumbly and falls apart easily. The first two layers (I only have two 9" rounds so I had to do this in two batches) fell apart coming out of the pan. This cake needs a little more than butter and flour, it needs to have the bottom of the pan lined in wax paper. I did that for round three and it came out perfectly. When I was icing the cake, again it was crumbly. I ended up using two batches of icing, one for sealing the crumbs and the second for effect. I didn't use all of the second. It's too tall for the dome on my cake dish -- I'm going to have to drag my tupperware cake keeper out of the back of the pantry. All in all an impressive looking cake. And since it ws crumbly -- I got to taste test before serving. Yum.

VERY GOOD. Following suggestions, we used 1 1/2 cups sugar, 2 cups unsalted butter, 1 1/4 cup buttermilk and baked in two nine-inch cake pans, then cut in halves for a four-layer cake. We doused each layer with Kahlua (and wished we'd used more) and inserted very thin slices of banana. In one layer, we used lemon curd - a mistake perhaps, very slippery, causing cake to slip (requiring skewers to stabilize). We're not big on cream-cheese icing (even when using fresh cream cheese as we did) and next time would use a butter cream: this is WAY too rich, even with lemon zest and extract, and WAY too much (had 2 cups leftover) and WAY too drippy. Still, people raved and my most discriminating foodie ate TWO pieces!

This recipe is perfect... I have made it twice now and both times doubled the frosting. Also if you want to really spice this cake up, I suggest putting the left-over icing on top of an individual slice and sprinkling the slice with brandy or cognac and then heating the whole thing up a little bit- it's sooo decadent! I get many requests to make this again. It also makes a HUGE CAKE!.. Enjoy!

Italian cream cake has always been one of my favorites, and this recipe does not disappoint. I have made it several times and everyone loves it. It is so big that it is almost unmanageable.

This is one of the most requested cakes I make for family and customers. I use 1 C butter and 1 C Crisco..otherwise I follow the directions as is. I don't understand the suggestions to decrease the amount of sugar...a cake is supposed to be sweet and this does not make an overly sweet cake. I've been making this recipe for a few years now and highly recommend it! Tip: Also, it helps to have a kitchen scale to measure out the batter into the 3 pans evenly.

I have a variation of this recipe which results in a much lighter version. I only use 1/3 cup of shortening, 4 eggs not 5, and 1 3/4 cup flour. I usually only use 3/4 cup of buttermilk. This is a delicious cake, perfect for Spring, and pretty too.

"Decadent", a keeper in my dessert repertoire! I too cut the sugar to 1.5cups and used butter instead of margarine.

Thank you to all the comments and suggestions of the other cooks, it gives great insight.

This is the first Italian Cream Cake I've ever made. A friend made them all the time and they were wonderful, so I had a standard to go by. Per the suggestion of other reviewers, I made the following changes: Used 1 3/4 c. sugar, and 2 sticks of butter -- no margarine or shortening. I think I used some extra coconut -- about 1 1/4 c. Next time I'll use the whole 2 c. sugar. One of my eggs had a double yolk, which made up for the lo-fat buttermilk (I couldn't find whole fat). I made it as 2 9" layers as it didn't look like there was enough for 3 layers. Next time I'll try 8" pans and hope for 3 layers. I doubled the frosting -- though not the confectioner's sugar --only used about 1 1/2 boxes. The frosting was fabulous -- but I had at least 2/3 cup left over -- but then I only had two layers. I think with the full 2 cups of sugar, this would be a 4-fork cake. That's what I'm expecting next time! My guests raved over it nevertheless.

I've made this cake for several years...it's the most requested cake I've ever made. Over time, I've tried different variations, some successful, some not. One great change was to use hazelnuts instead of pecans and add a little hazelnut flavoring (the kind used to flavor coffee drinks) in both the batter and the frosting (in place of vanilla). I have also toasted a small amount of coconut to sprinkle on the iced cake. I've also tried toasted pine nuts, which lends a little more sophisticated taste to a very rich cake. This cake is a great keeper in the fridge...if it sticks around that long!

Most of my guests really enjoyed this cake. The others,me included, found it toooo rich. It was fun to make and really looked pretty decorated with fresh flowers from my garden. The reviewers who said the recipe had too much shortening were right on the money. It does need to be reduced for lighter results. The birthday girl loved it, and that was all that mattered.

I am a husband who loves to cook. I made this for a church dinner and everyone loved it so much that I did not even get a piece. I am now getting requests for special occasions. I have never seen a cake get such rave reviews from so many. I did add a little less sugar.

My friends beg me NOT to make this recipe because we could eat the whole thing. It takes time, but it is a huge cake and it is very delicious.

The next time I make this cake, I will measure a cup of pecans and THEN chop them, instead of measuring a cup of already-chopped pecans, so there won't be soooo much. It was very, very good, but a little too "pecanish" for my taste. I would also double the icing.

I was almost embarrassed at the attention over this cake. I made it for my sister's wedding shower. Doubled the recipe for 2 12" and 2 9" heart shaped pans. For one of the 9" cakes, I left out the nuts and coconut for those who don't/can't eat them. For the plain cake, I split it and put a little vanilla custard between the layers. I did toast the nuts, reduced the sugar and used all unsalted butter, made extra icing..I am so grateful for those suggestions! Thanks! Next time I make it, I think I will substitute 1/3 of the butter with applesauce since it was soooo rich. I knew I would be in a time crunch, so I made the cake layers two weeks ahead, wrapped them tightly and froze them. I let them defrost in the fridge the night before I frosted them(the day before the shower). All I had to do was frost them and pipe a little icing around the edges. Just before the shower, I put fresh roses on top of the cake...palest green, pink and cream rosebuds with a few leaves. Sprinkled opalescent (sp?)cake glitter on top. Just beautiful. One lady asked my sister if I was a professional baker and was I doing the wedding cakes... my sister blurted "Lord No! She's a CPA!"

Flavor was wonderful. First cake was a disaster. 1 1/2 cups of shorening is too much, makes the cake too heavy. 1/2 cup is fine. Cake burned at 375 so I baked the second at 350, much better. Double the icing! Second cake was a 4 fork recipe.

I made this cake for Easter and it was delicious! I took others' advice and used only 1 3/4 sugar in the cake and substituted butter for the margarine in both the cake and frosting. Like other people said in their reviews, several people told me they liked it even though they normally dont like coconut. It was moist, rich and sweet.I will definitely make it again!

If you think this cake is a little on the sweet side, try brushing the layers with light rum on both sides before assembling it. To me, that seemed to cut down on the sweetness. Plus I just love cakes with spirits in them.

I made this cake for an engagement party and it received rave reviews. I substituted butter for the margarine and cut the sugar in the cake to 1 3/4 cups. I think you could use 2 cups without it being too sweet. I sprinkled decorating coconut on top. I'm glad that I did. A guest at the party told me that she was allergic to coconut so this served as a forwarning. Several guests asked for the recipe. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for several coconut lovers and they all loved it. I didn't make any changes except for using unsalted butter instead of margarine. I will certainly be making it again.

I am not a fan of shortening or margarine but used both based on other reviews. Blech! The batter was tasteless and I had to make this twice because the first time the cake fell apart. The second time I used butter for everything (cake and frosting). The batter had much more flavor and it baked beautifully. Due to the first mishap, I ended up with a four-layer cake for a baby shower. It looked and tasted great. I'll definitely keep this in my file--and I'll make a four-layer cake from now on.

Just served it at a dinner party. Everyone seemed to like it. I did not mix the pecans into the batter, I chose to decorate the side of the cake with them after the frosting went on. I also put coconut on top. I used 8 inch pans and still had to drop the cooking time by 5 minutes. I also substituted butter, can not bring myself to use margarine. Will definately make again.

I served this cake at a bridal shower and women were coming up to me and saying they hated coconut and had two pieces of the cake. I recommend using less sugar, as one of the reviewers suggested, but believe it or not, the margarine is better than butter in this cake!

Very moist, tasty cake. Watch the layers closely when baking as I had to remove them at 25 minutes.

I too replaced the margarine with butter but otherwise left it alone. It was fantastic, but for me it only made 3 8" layers - and just barely that!

I'm a pastry chef in an upscale Italian restaurant. I love this cake! The only change: unsalted butter and no margarine. Big hit with everyone who tried it: I served it with toffee sauce, coconut tuiles and coconut marshmallow. YUM!

Made this recipe with a friend who wanted to learn more about baking. She was convinced that I am a wonderful cook.:) The cake was great. We also used butter instead of margarine and I baked the cake in four pans instead of three, shortened the baking time slightly and doubled the frosting recipe.

As a wedding cake the remarks were that it was the best cake they had ever eaten.

The cake was scrumptious, but having made it twice and altering the recipe the second time to remove the shortening and margarine (total of 2 cups) and replacing with 1 cup unsalted butter and an extra 1/4 cup of buttermilk, plus replacing the margarine in the frosting to butter, made a big difference in overall flavor and texture. WONDERFUL!

This cake is perfect!!! My only suggestions: replace the margarine with butter, especially in the frosting. It was still great frosting, but I can't help thinking it would have been better with butter. I also don't understand why everyone insists on cutting back on the sugar. The cake was scrumptious as is - but then again, I'm part Italian, so maybe I have a different sweet tooth!

I made this cake for a small dinner party and everyone went nuts. However, I did make a few alterations. I substitued unsalted butter for the margarine, cut way back on the sugar in both the cake and the frosting, and sprinkled the top of the frosted cake with coconut. This cake also keeps really well. It's so rich it took us a week to eat, but the last piece was as good as the first.

I made this at Christmas and it was WONDERFUL. I will definitely be making this again and again. VERY moist with subtle flavor. Wonderful.

I have not made this recipe yet, but one of my friends did and just loved it. I would love to make it too, but I have a couple of questions first. I am allergic to cow's milk. Is there anything I could substitute for the buttermilk and the cream cheese. I am having a time cooking after finding out about my allergies. I use soy milk, rice milk and goat's milk (in desserts/candy). Does anyone know of anything I can substitute and use to make this dessert or will just plain goat's milk work for the buttermilk. The substitue for cream cheese has me stumped! All responses will be appreciated. Thank you.

Has anyone substituted butter for the margerine in the cake and in the frosting? I just can't bring myself to use margerine...Thanks!

I just baked this cake to rave reviews. Even the people who do not normally like coconut loved this cake. I would definitely recommend reducing the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and I will be reducing the amount of sugar in the frosting the next time I bake this cake.

I have made and sold desserts semi-professionally for many years. This is one of the best Italian Cream cakes I have had anywhere. I have a friend who insists on it for his birthday and any special occassion.

I made this recipe for a family gathering. Everyone raved about it. My husband says it's one of the most delicious cakes he has ever eaten. I even saw my mother-in-law going back for seconds! This is a keeper.

Fabulously moist! It was a huge hit. I'd go ahead and use all the sugar it calls for though! Why skimp on cake? You eat it for the pure sin of it anyway. :-)

One of my favorites. I first used this for a wedding cake and people keep requesting it for their own special occasions. It's moist, great flavor, and yes people who don't like coconut love this cake. Two cups of sugar isn't overwhelming and increases the moistness of the cake, but you can certainly cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups and have a tasty moist cake.

THIS IS FABULOUS! THIS IS SO POPULAR THAT I HAVE CATERED IT FOR FRIENDS. I ALSO CONCUR ON 1 1/2 CUPS OF SUGAR.

Cake was great as per the recipe. Italians have a very refined sweet tooth, use two cups of sugar.

I've tried several recipes for ICC and this is by far the best. I tried it with 1.5 c. of sugar and it was just fine. Thanks to the other reviewer for the suggestion.

The cake is moist and nice, but I would use only 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2 cups.
