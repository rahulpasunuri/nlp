Weeknight dinner and we all savored the flavors. The chicken marinade is easy and quick and the chicken cooked nicely in the Foreman grill. Good recipe to use those mangoes on sale. We will enjoy this several more times before the summer is over. We too used romaine along with some baby lettuce. Did the job, nicely.

Since mangoes were on sale at the grocery store and we are not regulars at eating them I looked for meals with mangoes. My husband and i thought this was wonderful. Loved the citrus with the mango and the chicken we thought was just right. Our greens were romaine and that worked ot fine. This is a nice weeknight dinner and will definitely be on the menu repeatedly...as long as we can get the mangoes!

4 forks for the individual components. I tried to use pre-cooked chicken, which ruined the chicken because it ended up being very mushy, so we had to get creative. I used regular, non-flavored black beans from a can instead, and threw away all of the chicken (and my hard work!. I toasted a sma)ll whole wheat tortilla on the gas stovetop (do not light on fire, just crisp it). The salad dressing is so simple and so awesome. And the mango salsa is out of this world. Both would be delicious on their own, and it all worked wonderfully together! Next time I may make the chicken (start with raw chicken, like I should have), though the beans were a worthy substitute, and much quicker.

This has been my favorite summer salad recipe for 10 years. I definitely use low sodium soy sauce. I've also prepared it with green leaf lettuce. I usually make extra salsa - it is my favorite part!

This was good. The chicken could've used a little extra kick, and I'll experiment to see what that kick should be. Meanwhile, though, it was a little too salty. With all the soy sauce in the marinade, I'll be more careful to go easy on the salt next time, or maybe even use low-salt soy sauce.
