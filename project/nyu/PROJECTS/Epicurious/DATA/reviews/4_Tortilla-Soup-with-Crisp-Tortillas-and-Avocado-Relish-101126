Amazingly easy and delightfully tasty. I subbed veggie stock to accomodate my husband's vegetarianism, added a seeded super hot chili to the puree, and opted to thicken the soup with corn starch instead of tortillas out of sheer laziness (and maybe to cut some calories). I loved garnishing the soup with the fried tortillas, but I might season them a bit next time. I didn't make the relish because I didn't have most of the ingredients handy, but would love to try this recipe again with it.

Fantastic! Made a few modifications based on what I had on hand, can't wait until I have everything! The avocado is crucial -yum. Used canned tomato with chiles: drained and broiled it created nice flavor. My husband and I averaged about half an avocado per bowl. Didn't bother with the relish. Tried frying strips of both white corn and yellow corn tortillas. We liked the yellow best.

This was great, but I did substitute quite a lot. I used 3 New Mexico chilis, sauteed the onion and garlic, 1 can fire-roasted Muir Glen tomatoes. Did not make guacamole relish but served chunks of avocado in lime juice, ricotta salata, tortilla strips and lime sections as garnishes. Also added some chicken parts to broth, then took out and shredded into soup to serve.

Marvelous! Very authentic and absolutely delicious. The tortilla strips and chips were easier to make than I'd have guessed. Guests all licked their bowls clean. Added some chunks of mozzarella to give it a little extra salt and dairy. Will definitely make this again.

This is a delicious soup, but I have to say it's not a light summery soup. It's actually quite thick and closer to what I have had as Sopa Tarasca in central Michoacan, Mexico. That said, it is a delicious fall soup. The quality of avocados added is critical. Good avocados and plenty of lime juice are key. And don't forget to fry your own tortilla strips. Makes all the difference.

This tortilla soup is FABULOUS!!!!! We are spice lovers so I added an additional large guajillo chile. I agree with other reviews that the ground fried tortillas make a HUGE difference in this recipe. After the soup thickened, I pureed it in the blender to eliminate the bits of tortillas. The result was a beautiful, silky smooth, tasty soup! I combined some fat-free sour cream & lime juice to drizzle over the soup and my husband raved! This is a definite keeper!

Excellent result! As for process, I had to throw out the first attempt of broiling the tortillas as someone suggested in a review. They were burned to a crisp in less than a minute. I did not dry toast the chiles and I don't think it was needed. The veggies can not be broiled 2-inches from heat for 20 minutes - more like 5 or they will be burned. Between the crispy tortillas and the relish this is the best Tortilla Soup. I added shredded rotisserie chicken that I had in the freezer to 'hearty' it up a bit.

The avocado relish was fabulous. I would make it again just to eat this and it would be great to serve along side chips. The soup was time consuming and next time I will make a portion of it the day before-perhaps frying the tortilla chips and cleaning the peppers.

So flavorful! I added corn, butternut squash and chicken to the soup for some added protein and veggies. My husband LOVED it! I added come cojita cheese to the top as well. Scrumptious.

I have made this soup many times and it is my husband's favorite. Every time I use whatever I have on hand that is close to the original recipe, but no matter the modifications it always turns out amazing. One addition that has stuck is the addition of corn towards the end. It is time consuming, but worth every minute.

Rating: 4
Very good. I made a few modifications. I added cumin to the final mix, left out any added salt (the broth added more than enough). I couldn't find corriander sprigs or ancho chiles so I just added a 3rd guajillo chili. I added a shredded rotisserie chicken breast. I baked instead of fried the tortillas. Still, a really great tasting soup.

This is an incredibly rich and complex soup. Lots of steps but not so bad if you make some of it the day before. The avocado relish makes this dish really shine as does the home fried tortillas. That fresh corn taste is such a big part of this soup that it would be a shame to miss out on that by using corn chips. I bought freshly made tortillas from a mexican store and then fried them. I think this made the soup even more special. I used a can of muir glen fire roasted tomatoes because the fresh ones at my store were horrible. I poached four bonesless skinless chicken thighs in the soup and shredded with a fork. Add two ears of corn, shucked and tossed the cobs into the soup as well. Remove before servingobviously. I had to sub new mexico chillis for the guajillo and ancho but I tossed a few poblanos, a jalapeno and a couple of serannos in with the broiled veggies. This is an incredibly rich and complex. I couldn't help but guild the lily a bit and mixed up some "crema", a little mayo, sour cream and lots of lime. A drizzle of this gave it such a refreshing acidity. Hehe AND I sprinkled a little cotija cheese on top too. You would have thought that this would have sent it over the top and maybe it did but it was really really tasty. Excellent recipe.

Great recipe! I forgot to toast the chilies and I used vegetable stock; otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. The soup is great as-is or with a little added sour cream for richness. The relish is delicious and is nice served with chips as an appetizer on its own. Be sure to use coarse, freshly ground black pepper for best flavor!

I made this exceptional soup for a dinner for 9 women. I did make a few changes. Instead of the relish, I added just cut up avocados, I used a few handfuls of store bought white tortilla chips in the soup, purchased a roasted chicken and shredded it into the soup. I then added a spoonful of smokey salsa into each bowl along with avocado, some baked tortilla strips, and fresh cilantro. It was amazing. I made the base part of the soup the day before and only had to add the stock and other ingredients before the guests arrived. Made it easy and wonderful!

This is a really lovely Tortilla Soup. I could not find the guajillo chilies easily, but it was fine w just the ancho. Fry your own tortillas - it's really tasty & easy to do. It's good w sour cream, monterey jack or with chicken too.

I apologize for rating this 3 forks because I don't follow every little thing,otherwise it would be 4 forks. I thought I had rated this a year ago but check and didn't see it so sorry (again) if someone finds it. I have made this several times and broil the vegies with a little olive oil, including fresh peppers (whatever I can find). Then puree them straight ahead no pealing or fuss. Add to the stock and bring to a boil. Follow the recipe, making the homemade tortillas is essential and easy. I always make extra strips because they are half eaten before we have soup. I use a stick blender to thicken the soup after the tortilla's have cooked for 30 minutes or so. Its really very easy and the homemade tortillas take much less time than you'd think. My husband and teens LOVE this soup.

Rating: 4
I made this exactly as directed, except I used 2 fresh anaheim (I think?) peppers instead of the two dried gaujillos. I roasted the fresh peppers with the other veggies, as others suggested. I thought it was excellent, and while it was not an after work dinner, it was also not laborious. Great for a Sunday when one has work to do but can also mind the broiler/stove. I would not normally add the corn, beans, etc. that others have added. Cut up chicken would be fine, but I enjoyed the purity of the tomato, chicken stock, and pepper flavors. We had this as a very light dinner, but it would also be an excellent first course or side.

this soup was great... for me. however, it didn't survive well for my low-salt other half. he claimed to still like it but my tasting spoon does not lie. i prepared it with some alterations- " i was unable to find the guajillo and ancho chilies, so i used one chipotle. i added it to the vegetables after broiling, and puréed them together. i'm a weakling for heat when it comes to soups so it provided just the right amount of bite. " i used canned whole tomatoes as we are not in tomato season " the whole purpose of me making the soup was to get rid of some tortilla chips, so i used those " no salt... ANYWHERE. this soup wasn't as hard as made out to be, especially with these alterations. i would make it for company certainly, served as an appetizer to some enchiladas or quesadillas!

This recipe is delicious! I added some chicken that I diced (next time I'll go even smaller) and cooked it in the soup pot before adding everything else. Instead of the relish, I just topped it with diced avocado, queso fresco, and a squeeze of lime. I didn't puree the veggies and peppers because I tend to like some chunks as another reviewer noted. Next time, I will puree the peppers, but leave the other veggies as is. The dried chilies really don't take much effort and are definitely worth it. I also had one jalapeno on hand from last week, so I threw that in with the other broiled veggies. I skipped the tortilla quarters too, and the soup was fine with just the strips. The time wasn't too bad either - maybe 35-40 minutes before the final simmering step if you work quickly.

I pureed cilantro with the veggies. And topped the soup with raw diced tomato, onion and more cilantro.

like the other reviews mentioned, this was a lot of work, and I'm not so sure it was worth the effort. I followed the recipe exactly, and wasn't that happy with the flavor. It was a little to smokey and you couldn't really taste the tomato, just the chili. I added shredded chicken, a can of cream corn, a small can of tomatos and chilis, and a can of white beans, then garnished with shredded cheese and cilantro. My additions made the soup much better!

Great Flag of Texas, people, this is a fiesta of flavors! Even with a few substitutions, it was still amazing. First, no guajillos at the store, so I used chipotles. They're quite a bit hotter, so used only 1/3 of the chile puree. Otherwise it would be too spicy for even my pepper belly! The smoky chile flavor is outstanding, but use gloves and the vent hood to avoid breathing the fumes. Due to my SO's allergies, had to use flour tortillas instead of corn. Soup didn't really thicken and needed 1 Tbsp brown sugar for balance, perhaps due to the flour tortillas. Used fresh made chicken stock, added shredded chicken, a dollop of sour cream and squeeze of lime before serving. The relish flavors just sparkle and are essential. My mouth is still a-tingle. Yum!

This was really fun and easy to make...although I didn't fry the tortillas. I just used tostadas from the store. I also served it with condiment platters with radish, avacado, lime wedges, crema, queso fresco and shredded chicken so my guests could customize their bowls. Very earthy and fun dinner party food!

I have made this soup twice now. Once using commercial tortilla chips and once making my own. What a difference! The flavor is so much richer. Definately worth the time to make your own. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. It's a keeper.

If you enjoy cooking, this soup is fun to make, if you don't then it might be too much work. I couldn't find the dried chilies so I got fresh pablono's, anehiam, and jalapeneo chilies(sp?), brolied them with everything, including some corn. This mixture came out good and worked very well. So reviewers comments suggest lack of flavor, in the begining stages the flavor is minimal, after the simmering process the flavors really come together. I also added Ancho chili powder. I like a little more stuff in my soups so I also added chicken, and some white beans (they were onhand). Next time I'll add black beans and zucini. Fantastic soup! I will make this again.

Love the recipe--with some revisions- replaced dried chilies with fresh (broiled with the vegetables) 1 pablano, 1 aneheim, 1 serrano. Reduced the broth by two cups, added cooked chicken and broiled corn (post blender). sprayed tortillas with oil & baked at 400 for 5- 10 minutes. Used cilantro, chopped avo and lime rather than dressing: freezes well

Oh so yummy! I made this soup for the first time yesterday. I ended up adding chicken to the soup, and my 7 year old ate 2 big bowls!!! Next time I think I'll bake the tortillas before adding to the soup and use packaged crushed tortilla chips on top. That might save me some time! Really good though!

Exceptional soup. I did the following to save time: Used one can of Ro-tel Mexican mix (with lime and cilantro) instead of chilies in soup recipe. Used pre-made guacamole for relish, and just added the chilies, onion and lime juice to it. Used store-bought tortilla chips instead of making my own. Added a dollop of sour cream with each bowl. YUM! Quick, easy and absolutely delicious!! This one's going in the rotation for sure.

Outstanding, good enough for company soup. I served it with Grilled Montery Jack and Corn Quesadillas (from this site) for an above-average version of grilled cheese and soup - my guests nearly licked their bowls clean. I followed the recipe nearly verbatim, including using the guajillo and ancho chilies and frying my own white corn tortillas. For those who loved this recipe using Rotel, wait till you taste it with these chilies - yum. I also followed the recommendations of others by adding about 1 1/2 cups of fresh sweet corn to the roasting pan and would definitely do that again - the little bit of sweet added a nice dimension to the smokey spice of the soup. I also added a dash of cumin and used simply diced avocado in lime juice, pepper jack cheese, chopped cilantro and the delicious tortilla strips at the bottom of the bowl. Which brings me to my only reason for posting this review: it appeared that most people either baked the tortillas or used chips in place of frying their own. I'll grant you this is not a quick, throw-together kind of soup even skipping this step, but the fried tortillas were so good and seemed to add so much to the dish that I wanted to be sure to add my vote for following this part of the recipe, if you have the time.

I made this for a Halloween block party, tripled the recipe and it was devoured before I could get a second taste. I used a combination of fresh and canned tomatoes, diced green chilies and 2 cans of Rotel mexican mix(good recommendation from another cook!)and shredded poached chicken. I made my usual guacamole and had cotija cheese, lime and cilantro for toppers. I also made the Crispy pork with Avocado Salsa, which was gone in minutes as well. The recipe for this soup in now a hot topic in my town thanks to epicurious!

SO GOOD!!!! I changed it a bit...I did not make the avacado relish. I just cut up avacado and put it on top as a garnish with the lime squeeze. Also, Instead of the peppers (trying to be kid friendly), I used a can of Rotel- mexican mix with lime and cilantro. It was so easy and good. It was eaten quickly. My daughter keeps asking for more. Don't let the receipe scare you. I did try it with cheese, but it was better w/o.. make it for a crowd by double or tripling the recipe and you will be a HIT!!!!

OHMYGOSH...this recipe rocks! I did not use the food processor because I wanted it chunky and it turned out great. Also added black beans and broiled some corn which I cut off the cob along with the rest of the veggies. Don't forget to discard the really charred part of the tomato skin before adding it to the soup base. I used store bought white corn tortilla chips and I don't know why you would go to the trouble to make your own because these did just fine. Didn't make the relish, but topped the dish instead with diced avacado, mexican crumbly cheese, chips, fresh cilantro and a lime wedge. It turned out absolutely fantastic!!!

YUM! I love this soup! I have already made it twice, once for a party where it was a huge hit. I did poach some chicken in the stock and shred it and add it back to the soup before serving. I added a few handfuls of cilantro as the veggies pureed. Also, I did not make the relish, but did serve the soup with diced avocados and shredded cheddar along with the tortilla strips.

At first, I was scared to try this but don't be - it doesn't have to be so time/labor intensive. The relish is OK = can definitely be skipped. Tha's what takes the most time. Just serve diced avocado on the side. I took the suggestion of baking the tortillas, rather than frying. Saves time and calories (although I have added back 1-2 tbsp olive oil for flavor). I often add chicken. Black beans are great in it, too. I actually make the Spicy Black Bean Soup and mix them together. SOOOOO GOOD!!

Very good - the smoky flavor from the roasted veggies is a nice touch. I made several changes that worked out well: * substituted 1 lime wedge, 2T avocado chunks, 5 tortilla strips, 1/2T chopped cilatro, and 1T mexican white cheese for avocado relish *I sprayed my tortilla strips with canola oil then broiled them for about 10 minutes rather than deep fry *Added a pinch of cumin to the soup *Replaced chicken stock with veggie stock I'll definitely make this one again. I think the addition of black beans would also work nicely.

A delicious soup with or without the avocado relish. If without, a dollop of sour cream for each bowl is very nice. I think a little lime juice is almost essential. This is a time-consuming recipe, not something to be thrown together after work.

This is fantastic. Consider toasting an extra ancho chile then slicing it into matchstick thin slices to use as a garnish. Don't forget the lime wedges -- it brightens the soup at the end. Try a little crumbled queso anejo to finish it, as well. This is a delicious dish even if you skip the relish and add some avocado slices at the end.

Great soup. I made a couple changes. I made stock from a couple chicken breasts and added the shredded meat to the soup. Also, I used whatever chiles I could find and roasted them with the other veggies rather than pan-toasting them. I also added an ear of fresh corn. I only used 2-3 tomatoes rather than a whole pound. Lastly, i topped the soup with some monterey jack cheese and a little sour cream. It took a while to make but was well worth it!

I don't mess with frying the tortillas. Cut them and line them on 2 baking sheets and broil until golden and crisp. Healthier, easier and I can't tell the difference in taste. I also used a green pasilla (roasted too) instead of dried ancho.

This soup is now a regular in my repertoire. It is labor intensive, so instead of the relish, I simply add fresh chunks of avocado before serving, and of course, in a pinch for time, I buy tortilla strips from a local taqueria, where they're made by hand (just not mine).

A fabulous recipe just as it is! My homemade chicken stock had a some chicken bits in it and it was just enough. The avocado relish and the crisp strips of tortilla are just right for the wonderful base of the chicken stock and tomato/chili puree. A bit time-consuming but well worth the effort. For me, this is perfect the way it is. We loved it!

Simply amazing! As a lover of spicy food and soups in general, this is a real treat. It takes a few hours to prepare, but it's well worth making if you have the time. I like to make extra and have it with chicken as a filling lunch during the work week. One note of caution: as you cook the chilis, don't let the steam touch your skin, especially your eyes and face as they'll burn for days.

Delicious! I loved it, especially after adding some extra sauteed chicken and onions to the pot. I also cheated and used taco shells, which worked fine, and saved a lot of trouble/mess. Next time I'll add squash and maybe some shredded jack cheese. That, with the chicken, makes it a full meal. With the cheater shells, the recipe is really not as complicated as it sounds -- TRY IT! YOU'LL LOVE IT! Wait 'til you smell that pureed roasted tomato/chili/onion/garlic. . . HEAVEN!! (Salsa base. . .?) Warning: Use the rubber gloves! Also, avoid breathing in the fumes coming up from the pan when searing the chilis. . . WOW!! Accidentally got a lung-full and was coughing for a while.

I really love this soup and make it regularly. I got tired of all the tortilla frying though so in the last couple of batches I've used white corn taco shells that I sent through the food processor. Those worked just fine. I usually use chunks of avocado rather than the relish. The puree also makes a great base for an enchilada sauce and you can turn the leftover soup into an amazing barbeque sauce (with some brown sugar, onions, white wine, etc). I cooked a brisket in it recently that was out of this world.

This is a great tortilla soup. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added roasted red peppers. Also, I garnished it with sour cream (I think cheese would be good too). Very good. One note: the recipe calls for 2 ancho chiles (about 1 oz); I had a 1 oz package of dried ancho chiles, which amounted to about 10, not 2. I added 3, whihc was a little spicy. Nice flavor, but those that don't want that much spice should stick with 2.

This is a great soup.....I used Pacilla Chilies for the Ancho, added 1-1/2 cups corn (roasted it with the other vegies), added 2 extra garlic cloves, added about 1/2 cup chopped cilantro when pureeing the vegies, and added two extra tortillas when making quarters. I also added 1 large can of cooked chicken to make it a complet meal. To top it off, fresh Cilantro, Chopped Avacado, lots of tortilla strips and limes to squeeze over the top!!
