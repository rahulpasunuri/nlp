I have made this several times. We like it very much. The better the chicken broth, the better the results. Used more cheese and nuts.

Very good vegetarian risotto! I put more nuts and asparagus and added fresh thyme. Garlic definitely gives a nice twist to the asparagus!

I really enjoyed this recipe. As some had suggested, I used more cheese, and chopped up my asparagus. I tend to take shortcuts and didn't bother chopping up the walnuts (I just bought a bag of "pieces" in the baking aisle). I added some sauteed chicken, though, truth be told, the dish didn't really need it.

Nice risotto, but not sensational. Cut the asparagus on the diagonal and mixed in, added some butter at the end along with slightly more cheese and walnuts. A mixed green salad with dried cranberries and a glass of white wine made a nice meal. Will probably make again, but there are many risottos out there that are orgasmic. Try Giada's brown butter lobster risotto...to die for

Really good. Very rich considering there's no butter. Definitely toast the walnuts.

delicious, satisfying and healthy. roasted asparagus, garlic and toasted nuts are flavorful. i used a full onion, a huge handful of parsley, 5-6 cups of stock, and a full handful of parm plus garnish. i added a sprinkling of dried thyme, and would consider using 3/4-1 cup of white wine, and possibly adding mushrooms or meat. it made 4 x 2-scoop servings.

Delicious, fast, and easy. I add about 1/4 lb slivered prosciutto for a terrific and satisfying main dish.

Very easy risotto and I do so love the taste of roasted asparagus!! I added some garlic shrimp to make it a more substantial main coarse. Yummy.

Very good - like others I cut up the asparagus and incorporated it into the risotto before serving and added a bit more parmasan and nuts. Made it as a main course for myself and side-dish with chicken for my meat-eating family. Everyone enjoyed it.

A very good and dependable risotto recipe, but I agree with whomever marveled at the 4-person serving suggestion...this barely scraped 3 as a main. I added far more walnuts than the recipe called for, about 1 cup. Also, the recipe doesn't outline how to toast the walnuts - (heat carefully in a dry pan over med-high heat, turning). I also added flat-leaf parsely at the end of the cooking, and let the whole thing sit, covered, for about five minutes (removed from heat). I cooked this up for my boyfriend's mom (eek!!) and she loved it.

Thought this was really good & really easy. The only thing I changed was to not roast the asparagus quite as long - 10 minutes was plenty (for small asparagus).

Changed nothing, and it was excellent. Instead of a first course, we had this as a one-dish meal for two, with some leftover risotto.

I loved this risotto! I made it for a friend who was definitely wowed. She thought it must be so bad for you because it tastes so rich.

This risotto was outstanding. It was creamy and the texture really held up. I did add a little extra parm. cheese and used low sodium broth. Toasting the walnuts really made a difference. This is a new favorite.

I've tried quite a few risotto recipes from this website in the last year, but this is one of the only ones worth making again. Loved the walnuts and roasted asparagus. Followed the other reviewers advice and chopped the asparagus up into bite sized pieces and mixed into the risotto.

This is one of my favorite recipes for a side dish. I have made it many times. I do need more broth than the recipe states though (more like 5-6 cups.) I also used pecans instead of walnuts as a moments inattention resulted in burnt walnuts once and it was still delicious.

I used our very popular white asparagus and added all of it, chopped after roasting, into the risotto at the end. Also added a bit more walnut and cheese and served with homemade ciabatta and a lovely field salad -- very nice!

Although this was not as good as my all time favorite risotto - the yellow pepper risotto on this site, it was still very good. Instead of serving the risotto on all the asparagus, I served it on only a few spears and chopped the rest up and threw it in the risotto, which I thought was good. Walnuts add an intersting flavor. Needs more cheese I thought. Overall, very good.

I was dying for an asparagus risotto, after having bought some nice asparagus at ridiculous, out-of-season prices. As usual, I made a couple of changes... I used porcini broth (cubes) instead of chicken to keep it vegetarian. Porcini added a really nice flavor, as the other reviewer noted, but the cubes were a bit salty - my fault, not the recipe. At the end, added a bit of cream (noted that from another asparagus risotto recipe on this site) to tone down the saltiness before adding the parmesan. Served over asparagus in a fan shape, with more walnuts scattered on top - it made a nice presentation, since the risotto would have looked very uninspiring on its own. Next time, I will add more water to the boullion and probably try chopping some of the asparagus, because the risotto really tasted best with bites of asparagus. Still, a very good vegetarian main dish, though the "4" servings referred to surely didn't include hungry people eating this as a one-course meal!

I chopped the asparagus and stirred it into the risotto, otherwise no changes. I loved this risotto! My family didn't, oh well, all the more for me!

Very satisfying blend of flavors. I do, however, agree with the Boston cook that presentation was tricky. Slicing the asparagus into smaller pieces sounds like a good idea. Use a good wine so you'll have an automatic tasty rest-of-the-bottle accompaniment for dinner!

Absolutely wonderful! This is one of the few recipes that I didn't modify at all (except that I served the risotto with the asparagus on the side). Made this for Mother's Day - got compliments even from the picky eaters. If you take into account that I *really* don't like rice, all this raving is pretty serious. Try this!

Excellent recipe. I've made it several times and it's always a huge success. The walnuts add wonderful flavor and texture.

This is a great recipe...though I added MORE CHEESE! The wine really POPs as a nice flavor. It's great to vary this recipe with pecans.

Great risotto! I even tried it substituting with white truffle oil, pistachios and asiago cheese for some variety. Everyone loved it!

I've made this dish several times. It's delicious. The only change I make is that I grill the asparagus instead of baking it. I usually serve it as a side dish with fish. I've gotten rave reviews from my guests.

This is easy to make and tastes fantastic. I could eat roasted asparagus every day! The only change I sometimes make is adding a shake or two of hot pepper flakes to make it a little spicier.

This is really a great dish as a main course or a side. We're serving it tonight as a matter of fact. A great dinner party piece.

This was pretty good, especially for my first risotto. I liked that it was fairly healthy, and the flavor combination was really great. I did not like, however, that it made an absolute TON of food, and the leftover reheated risotto was not nearly as good as when fresh. I'd also suggest either chopping up the asparagus and stirring it into the risotto at the very end, or just serving it on the side. Having the asparagus under the risotto proved to be a logistical nightmare. Still, a tasty first effort.

I served this dish to an Italian friend who said that he had never eaten such tasty risotto as this one and asked for the recipe. What better recommendation would you like? I used 5 cups of broth(making my own with bouillon), used 1/3 cup of Romano cheese, added a pinch of saffron and freshly grated black pepper; substitutted pistachios for walnuts as I do not like them; substituted broccoli for asparagus, using 2 Tbls. olive oil. It was simply deliciosa!

Great sidedish for simply grilled fish (salmon), excellent risotto. I used more onion and left it in larger pieces, and 3 large cloves of garlic with the asparagus, which I cut on the diagonal into 2-inch pieces before roasting. When the risotto was done, I stirred in the garlicky asparagus along with the walnuts and cheese. Really nice blend of flavors--one of my favorite risottos!

one of my husband & I's favorites & he typically isn't much interested in meatless meals. while the risotto is not forgiving on cooking times, the asparagus definitely has some flexibility.

Tasty, but I had a problem, which was probably my fault since it was my first time making risotto. My other dishes took longer than planned to cook through, so I kept this on low heat (while stirring) for an additional 15-20 mins. The result was a dense, sticky risotto.

What a decadent wonderful dish! Presentation is excellent. This would make a wonderful appetizer or a divine vegetarian main dish. I will definitely make this one again.
