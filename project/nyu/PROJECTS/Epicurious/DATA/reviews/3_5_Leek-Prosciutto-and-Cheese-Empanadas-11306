These were very good. The proportions were way off. I would double the stuffing to have enough for one pastry sheet.

This is a keeper. Endless possibilites -- my next will be Caribbean-style. Forget the "damp baking sheet;" oil it. I've been making empanadas for decades, but never thought of using puff pastry, which saves lots of time. Rolling the pastry a little thinner and rerolling the scraps at least doubles the number of empanadas. I use two sheets, increase the leeks to 2 cups, the proscuitto to five slices, and have added different fresh herbs each time. I omit the added salt and will use a Nevisian hot sauce in place of pepper next time. Everyone who has tasted them has asked for the recipe.

I really liked this recipe, but I did add garlic, extra prosciutto, cheese & leeks, and a dash of Italian Seasoning. Everyone at the party gobbled them up and my 2-year-old nephew ADORED them!

I didn't have a 4" cutter so I just divided the pastry into quarters. I guess that was too much because there was barely enough filling once the pastry puffed out - it just rattled around in there. However if I had used any more, I would not have been able to close the pastry over it. Also a small egg would be more than sufficient as I threw more than half of it away when done brushing them generously. I did use thin sliced ham and regular cheddar, finely chopped. Probably more leeks than called for. Anyway, twice as much filling probably would have raised the rating to two forks. My kids LOVED the empty pastry, of course.

Well, this was an interesting recipe but it really surpassed my expectations. What I found was that the filling needed some other flavors to complement the leek which was a little overpowering. I added some sliced olive and some extra cheese and it was great. The best way to cut the dough I found was to cut into four squares and then fold it into triangles.

These were great...but I made a couple of major changes. First of all, I used a LOT more prosciutto (my boyfriend loves it). Also, rather than pasty dough, I bought corn-based empanada sheets, cut them in half, made minis, and fried them in olive and vegetable oil, the sprinkled them with seasoned salt. Everyone loved them.

I have found I am not an expert with the pastry dough. I couldn't quite get the empanada shape so mine turned into purses. I thought the filling was way too salty. The salt from the prosciutto overpowered the whole thing. It tasted ok but I didn't fall in love.

I thought these were tasty but not extraordinary.I made mini's and thought that I needed a lot more filling. I would double the recipe if I were to make them again which I probably won't.

I've made these twice and have been happy both times. I make them mini-sized for appetizers and get about 30-40 in a batch. Best to add more of everything, proscuitto, cheese and leek. They are very flavorful.

I did these as well as a 3 inch round - but I wasn't overly impressed - lacking flavour. No doubt in my mind they are great as described or even in a crustade.

I made it for a suuper group and everyone loved it. I made them 3 inch circles so they would be easier to pass. Definatly worth making again!

These were marvelous. I cut my pastry into squares-- no point in wasting dough. I also divided my filling into 5 batches to play with it. First batch: original-great. Second batch: added English mustard for kick-very good; third batch: added dried apricots-really, really, good; fourth batch: added dill-awesome! Fifth batch: added fennel-divine! Of course, now I have to make it again with different cheeses! And to think this all started with mud pies ????

Thought these were good, but needed more zip. I'm not sure I would make them again without adjusting the recipe some. The guests enjoyed them though, so I don't regret trying them!

Really good! I made 30 or so of these, using a water glass for the puff pastry and upping the amounts for the filling very unscientifically. (you really can't mess this up) I made them the night before, baked them during the party, took them out, made one lap around the room and they were gone! Alas.

Excellent! Made them the night before a holiday party and baked them that night. People couldn't get enough of them.

Excellent. Made these with roasted red peppers instead of proscuitto and they came out great!

I took Vancouver's lead and made them smaller. Easy and impressed the guests. I rerolled the leftover pastry and got 1/3 more empanadas out of it, and still had some leftover filling. Next time I'll add something to give these a little more zip, though.

Friends couldn't believe I had made these from scratch. They were easy and delicious.One friend said he had just been to a dinner party where empanadas were served and thougth these were better.

My guests loved them. Very easy.

Fantastic! I tripled the recipe and use a 2.5" cutter to make bite sized appetizers for a party. They were gone in no time. I've had 3 guests ask me to email them the recipe.

Very easy and tasty. I've made this twice already and have been asked for the recipe both times.

Crisp and flaky with a delicious filling.Also very easy to prepare. The baking sheet should probably be greased as the bottoms stuck even though I moistened it.

I have made variations of this recipe over and over. Although it is incredibly easy to prepare, as well as being a do-ahead dish, guests ooh and aah over it. The mystique of puff pastry, perhaps. Go figure. I reinvent the filling every time I make it, depending on my mood. Mexican, Asian, Italian, etc. Serving a sauce to complement is also fun.
