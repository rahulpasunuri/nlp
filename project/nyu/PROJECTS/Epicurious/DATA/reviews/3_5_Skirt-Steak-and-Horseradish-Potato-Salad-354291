Wow - what a presentation, what a taste, how simple!!!!! Don't be afraid of the horseradish - it adds flavorful body and plays well with the garlic and shallots to yield a potato salad that truly worthy. The steak is great but you can switch it up with butterflied leg of lamb and probably any other meat. I couldn't find sugar snap peas so I thawed frozen peas and sprinkled them in. I didn't have white wine vinegar so I mixed white balsamic glaze with rice wine vinegar and it was just as perfect. Its excellent for a one dish buffet dinner and get ready for the oohs and aahs

This was delicious and simple to prepare. I also substituted blanched green beans for the snap peas and I grilled sirloin steaks instead of the skirt steak.

I only made the potato salad portion of this for a Labor Day party. Had 2 men! ask me for the recipe! (one was a chef to boot) Made pretty much as is, but substituted blanched fresh green beans for snap peas. Worked great. Also threw in some dried dill for color, but don't know if it even needed it. Great thing is, it can sit out for a long time since there is no mayo or sour cream. Oh- one guest did'nt even guess the predominant flavor is horsradish, so don't be scared to try it!

Fabulous! Great flavor! Like others, used flank steak, regular green beans (blanched) and red potatoes because that was what I had on hand. Used the stated amount of shallots, but agree the quantity can be reduced if desired.

If I was to make this again, I think I would cut out the snap peas. They were (I think) an odd addition. As of yet, I dont have an idea of a substitution. This is a good dinner salad for taking out on the boat. Its a full meal and my kids like all the bits and pieces of it pre dressing.

I threw this together last-minute with the following subs based on what I had on hand: red wine vinegar (not white), green onion in place of shallots, red potatoes for Yukons, filet for skirt steak, and mixed greens. And it was still delish!

Took advice from others and cut the amount of shallots. Used hanger steak (grilled on a bed of coals) and arugula for the greens. Gobbled up by company--simply delicious!!!

This was awesome! I used leftover grilled steak from the previous night. At the advise of other reviewers, I also used only one shallot but added two more after as I found the shallot really adds a bit of kick that was otherwise lacking. Next time I will make extra dressing ~ deelish! =)

Delicious and easy. The sweetness of the potatoes plays off against the sharpness of the dressing wonderfully. Do decrease the amount of shallots. though -- one large shallot is plenty. We also use flank steak instead of skirt (skirt is too tough), and use regular salad greens instead of watercress (which is hard to find). Arugula might work well.

Salad was delicious but agree with prior comments about shallots - definitely halve the quantity - it's too much as written. Also, we found it was not enough dressing so I would double that next time. We got great skirt steak from Fairway and were v. pleased with it.

Really a delicious salad. I used only 1.5 shallots and any more would have been way too much. I doubled the salad dressing amounts. I also used romaine and mixed spring greens instead of watercress. Will make this again.

Okay this is yummy! Served it on spinach (awesome) and used filet. Didn't use all the shallots and still has loads of flavour. I wouldn't eat this before heading out to a party, stays with you but its worth it!

The flavor of the shallots was just too over powering. I would only make this again if I halfed the amount of shallots.

I made this salad using flank steak for company and it was very succesful.

This is a really delicious recipe. I used flank steak instead but otherwise, followed directions exactly.

I made this dish as a play on traditional potato salad. I love steak salad, and thought "it a perfect marriage." The dressing really is divine. The potatoes really take a away the final dish. I suggest making them thinner or just replace them with wild rice pilaf. I prefer sirloin, strip, or filet in any salad due to the fact that I make steak for a non-steak lover... I suggest a better cut.

Made the salad without the arugula to accompany filet mignon steaks. Used baby red potatoes and left skin on. Tossed hot potatoes with the dressing so that they would absorb the flavors. I t was a huge hit. Very easy to make too.

This salad is very tasty but needs some modification. Skirt steak is not a very tender cut; perhaps if it were marinated it would be better. Otherwise, I would substitute sirloin steak. Also, the amount of dressing is WAY too little for all the foods that need to be dressed. I would double the liquid ingredients. But the overall taste and variety of the components is excellent.

a great summer entree... the kind of big salad that doesn't leave you wanting a steak afterward! great for an easy meal yet elegant enough for guests. i'm not keen on horseradish, so i replaced it with whole grain dijon mustard and used one bunch watercress and one bunch spinach. yum!

We love this salad! A light meat and potatoes meal - awesome. Enjoyable by high society and rednecks alike. Enjoy.

This salad was great!! I made this salad and brought it to the Polo tailgate and it was a big hit (especially for the guys). Of course I did not follow it exactly (but almost). I grilled a sirloin steak instead of the skirt steak and used asparagus instead of the snap peas. It travels well, in 3 containers, one for the veggies, one for the steak and one for the lettuce. I simply tossed it all together when I got there!! I will definitely make this again!!
