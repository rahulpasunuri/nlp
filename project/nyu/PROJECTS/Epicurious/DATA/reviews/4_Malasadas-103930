I can't vouch for the authenticity as I have never actually had malasadas made by anyone else, much less in Hawaii (spent a week in Maui and completely forgot to seek them out). However, I *can* tell you that this recipe was straightforward and easy to execute (if you are familiar with making yeast based dough), and resulted in the best doughnuts I have ever had, either store bought or homemade. As the significant other of a cop, that's saying something. (kidding)

My husband and I were lucky enough to try the malasadas from Tex's Drive In while on vacation in Hawaii. They were so delicious! The results of this recipe are very close to the original. The dough came together really well and was very easy to work with. I made pastry cream and filled each one. I took them to a party and everyone who tried them raved. They disappeared quickly as many people went back for seconds.

I made this for Shrove Tuesday instead of pancakes. It took a little while for the dough to come together, but once it did, it was a thing of beauty. The end result was OUTSTANDING! I dredged some in granulated sugar (husband's fave), some in powdered sugar (13-year-old's fave), and some in a lemon/powdered sugar glaze (my fave). A real treat! Thank you Tex Drive In!!!

I just came back from the Big Island, where I had the pleasure of eating one of Tex's malasadas fresh from the fryer. I am happy to report that this recipe makes a PERFECT Tex malasada at home! Light, pillowy, vanilla-scented, and so much better than any other kind of doughnut. You can also make a small slit using a knife and fill them with pastry cream or jam after rolling in the sugar. Absolutely delicious!
