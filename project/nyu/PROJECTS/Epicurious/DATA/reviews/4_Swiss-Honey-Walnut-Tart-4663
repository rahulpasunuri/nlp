The recipe itself was pretty good... I ended up adding some apples that I cooked in brown sugar and butter to cut into the sweetness of the filling- which did help the flavor somewhat. The tart ended up leaking the filling all over the pan, even though i spent a long time sealing the edges... overall i'd most likely end up trying a different walnut tart. This was good, but not amazing.

I made this for Thanksgiving (10 people) and everyone loved it. I also added a tiny bit of almond extract and it made it taste a little like a candy bar. The Filo is tricky- if you can get past that , it's worth it!

This dessert was served to a group of friends and everyone was wild about it. It is very easy to make and the finished product is so that you would think that it came from a pastry shop. Be prepared to share this one with all of your friends.
