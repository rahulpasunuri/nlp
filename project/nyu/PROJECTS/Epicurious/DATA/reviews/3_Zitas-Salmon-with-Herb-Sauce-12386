We made the breadcrumb coating exactly as described in the recipe, using multi-grain bread for the fresh breadcrumbs, and wild salmon. Excellent. We didn't make the herb sauce.

I served this at a dinner party Christmas Eve. The fish was delicious - the bread crumb coating was flavorful, and the fish was perfectly cooked. Though I was not wild about the Herb Sauce, everyone else loved it. A definite keeper.
