Reading reviews for the Greek Lamb Burger on this site, I noticed that several people mentioned making these potatoes as a side dish for the lamb. I was skeptical -- lime mayo with roasted potatoes? -- but decided to give them a try. All I can say is wow! What a delicious flavor combo! I even used low fat mayo and buttermilk with no loss of taste. Highly recommended.

Very good. I accidently put the cumin in the mayo sauce and it was a happy accident. The cumin balanced everything very nicely. I did notice that when I printed the recipe out the lime juice was missing in the ingrediants. To insure the potatoes didn't stick I placed some hot oil in the heated pan and put back in the oven for another 2 minutes. It prevented sticking and helped insure a wonderful bottom crust. Easy, different last minute side dish.

Real easy and super delicous. Most of the time I just make the potatoes and skip the lime mayonnaise.

Delicious! Also great with the addition of 1/2 tsp lemon pepper to potatoes and using lemon (+ lemon pepper) instead of limes in the mayo dip. Scrumptious.

Scrumptious. The first time, I made the recipe according to the instructions. The second, I used Yukon gold potatoes using salt, pepper and olive oil. Both versions were good, but we leaned toward the second. The cilantro-lime mayonnaise really makes this dish.

The roasted potatoes were simple to make. I couldn't find any fresh cilantro, so I used rosemary instead. I eliminated the lime zest. The dip tasted great. There were no leftovers.

Made these to accompany a Greek Lamb Burger and they went perfectly, definitely will be making these again with more meals and on there own!

Made this one with the roasted mojito chicken and it went over huge! Easy and tasty.

Fabulous! Added juice of the limes I used for the zest. Served at pool party w adults and children present. Great comments back from all ages served.

Yum! To speed up roasting the potatoes you can par-cook them in the microwave until soft and then slice them up, toss them in the seasonings and then broil until crispy. You can also make your own mayo if feeling really ambitious...

To cut down on the fat, I substituted non-fat plain yogurt for the sour cream. I also added some lime juice -- the recipe mentions lime juice in the instructions, but not in the ingredient list so I had to guess (it was probably about a tablespoon).

The salt and lime juice are not listed but dont forget them. They make a difference. This is a permenant part of my summer menu.

Delicious! This recipe is so easy and foolproof--I served this at a party alongside a salad and vegetarian tacos and everyone loved it (in fact the cilantro-lime mayo was great on the tacos as well). I used both regular baking potatoes & sweet potatoes, and it was a nice mix. I also discovered at the last minute that I was out of cumin so I just used some taco seasoning that I had on hand and it worked out great (though I would still like to try the recipe as written). I think this is one of those recipes that's pretty difficult to mess up!

This was quick and easy. My husband definitely enjoyed them. Don't skip the mayo...it is delicious!

This was easy, and tasty though I kept them in the oven too long so be careful. This is a great side that can accompany many entrees. I used only 2 med-large baking potatoes, and included 1/2 tsp. salt with the cumin and oregano and 2 tblsp olive oil. I squeezed half a lime into the mayo in addition to the zest. I would try a quarter of lime the next time and more cilanto.

Yum. Not a huge potato fan, but the fries were delish, and the sauce is wonderful on everything. I do add a good squeeze of lime juice to it as well (the directions seemed a little iff-y on that), but I think it makes a big difference. It's great on fish tacos, too!

Gosh darn this is fabulous! The lime in the dip makes this seem so light and refreshing. Mine cooked to a rich crunch in only 20 minutes. For half of them I used a seasoning (like Old Bay) and they are equally as yummy. I also dusted them before the oven with some smoked paprika. I'll go back to this recipe again!

I'd also like to add that it took about 40 min (no more) to cook, and I didn't bother flipping the potatoes.

Quick, easy, and delicious! The dip is fantastic... I'd go a little easier on the salt on the potato wedges next time.

Made this last night to go with ribs. I cooked the potatoes longer to make them crispier and agree you could add more spices (and cut down on the oil). I used more lime zest and cilantro in the dressing, which helped. A nice easy weeknight side.

Wow! These potatoes were fabulous and the dipping sauce 2 DIE 4! Couple of things... The instructions call for 3/4 tsp salt in the potatoes but its not listed in the ingredients. Also, i like my potatoes toasty brown so I ended up baking them for about 80 minutes and they were crispy perfect.

This is easy enough to make on a weeknight and tasty enough for entertaining. I made these to accompany a steak for my husband and salmon for me...yum! I used the juice from one lime and all of the zest from the same lime and it worked perfectly (to avoid wasting the lime). Although, I thought this was perfect as is, I think I will double the cumin and oregano next time. I think they were both a little overpowered by the salt. I didn't bother with turning the potatoes and they turned out fine. Enjoy!

This was excellent indeed and very versatile. Had fish already thawed so used it in place of chicken and made less coating (same proportions), coated only the tops, baked in 10 min...SUPERB! And the cilantro-lime mayo (made with light sour cream and mayo) was a great accompaniment! This was an excellent meal with a spinach salad and one my husband requests that we repeat. Nice fresh flavor. I also used limed tortilla chips which went nicely. Potatoes were great, too, they baked in only 30 min.

excellent and easy to make. went real well with buffalo wings. as to the dipping sauce.. really good and make a great topping for roast beef as well. to the chef who wrote the first review.. the lime flavor comes from the 2 tsp of zest not the juice.

Recipe is incomplete. There is no quantity listed for juice in the mayonnaise!
