The first time we used San Marzano tomatoes in their own puree and did not drain. The soup was AMAZING. (We also added ground beef to add some protein.) The second time we used regular tomatoes and did drain, and used canned beans. It was amazing what a difference the tomatoes (and beans) made. I will make this recipe again and again, but only if I have San Marzanos.

Simply perfect. I added a 1/4 cup of basil pesto and some grated Parm Reg. If it's too thick, add more chx stock. It's that simple.

I made a vegetarian version of this startign the vegetables in olive oil, and it was wonderful. I used vegetable stock in which I also soaked some dried mushrooms and a nice big hunk of parmesan rind. I also added the zucchini and green beans halfway thorugh. This is the best vegetable soup I have ever made, though this is in part because all the vegetables, including the tomatoes were garden fresh. And so easy.

I have been making this soup for years- it is absolutely delicious! I use turkey bacon and omit the potatoes and pasta but otherwise follow to a "T" and it is amazing. It is best to make it a few days ahead as the flavor is even better once it's had time to sit for a while. It's amazing to think that just veggies, turkey bacon and broth can taste this good but it really does!

This is a great recipe. My family loved it and since I doubled the recipe I have plenty of leftovers. Blending some of the white beans gave the soup a nice thick texture and an almost creamy feel. I used Morningstar vegetarian Italian sausage instead of the pancetta so didn't follow the recipe to a T but made no other modifications besides maybe using some additional broth than what was called for.

I don't like to throw away food so I forced myself to eat some of this soup. My family didn't care for it either. I follow the recipe to the letter except for the beans, I used a can. I don't think using dried beans would have improved the taste of this soup. I don't understand how this recipe got such high rating. It is nothing special. I've had much better tasting minestrone than this. Disappointing.

Rating: 0
This was an exceptionally delicious recipe. I used 2 carrots, and 2 celery ribs - didn't have kale, so used chard instead. It was still delicious... also did not have a can of whole-pak or readycut tomatoes so used about 8 fresh romas cut up with about 2 heaping tbsps. of tomato paste. I made my own stock with turkey parts and chicken broth as the base. What a difference that makes in a recipe. I deboned the turkey necks and used the meat in the soup as well. This is a superb recipe... with or without the freshly grated parmesan.

Rating: 0
Excellent recipe. I actually prefer ordinary green cabbage instead of Savoy for its stronger flavour component. I noticed several reviewers left out the kale or substituted spinach--I highly recommend you give the kale a try (substituting spinach is like using iceberg lettuce for arugula in a recipe). Heck, I live in the Great White North and if I use (and like)kale then you can too.

Rating: 4
Great soup! I've made this at least a dozeb times and received rave reviews each time. I also substitute cannelini beans for the North White Beans, sometimes add spinach in place of kale or add a handful extra, and try to add a rind of parmesan. I like to take about 25% of soup to blend in blender and then add back to pot. This changes it from a traditional minestrone texture, but it makes oh so hardy!! Serve with toasted garlic bread for lunch or dinner.

Rating: 4
I am vegetarian so I used veggie stock and left out the pancetta and it was just what I was looking for. I too threw in a parn regiano rind as I learned watching Giada. The only thing I would do differently next time is add the green beans and zucchini during the last 15 minutes of cooking so they stayed a little greener. And there will be a next time!

My family's favorite! I tweak this recipe a bit, use a can of cannellini beans. I use bacon, as it's a bit cheaper. No potatoes, but love the Ditalini noodles(small circles)added after the soup has boiled for an hour. I substitute spinach for the Kale or cabbage. I also put the rind of a parmigiano-reggiano block of cheese(left large for identifying purposes)which lends a wonderful taste, especially the second day. Serve with (the same)grated cheese and a Rosemary sourdough bread.

Great the first night and for leftovers too. I recommend having some extra stock on hand to add - I added an extra cup while making it. I used part of a sweet-tasting green cabbage instead of Savoy cabbage and it was fine.

Great soup - read the majority of reviews and considered leaving out the pancetta but glad I didn't. I did leave out the kale as others did (not sure what it tastes like or if it would ruin the soup), the savoy cabbage is excellent; used a can of Northern White Beans drained, and left whole. Definitely double the broth - I used 64 oz. I also made a cheesecloth bouquet of fresh thyme, basil, parsley and sage as they were ready to expire and hated not to use them (the reason I was making soup in the first place). Absolutely excellent - top with some fresh parm. Next time I'll add small elbows macaroni ... or maybe not ... YUM!

Great recipe...you can play around with the vegetables, purée or not purée the beans, put don't skip out on the pancetta! I've added pesto as well for some extra flavor. Easy on the salt; plenty in the pancetta and the parmesan. Definite keeper for our family.

I suppose I dont' really need to add to the commotion: this soup is excellent. Regarding seasoning, I did add one green chili for sport, but otherwise chose to follow the recipe.

great recipe. decided a few hours ago that I wanted to try minestrone and ended up with delicious soup that my husband loved too. I used canned white beans, a little parmesan, bacon and mild italian sausage and spinach instead of cabbage and kale. I also used italian style diced tomatoes already seasoned with oregano, basil and garlic. I even forgot to use the olive oil (just sauteed everything in the fat rendered from the meat) and added it when I started simmering (heated about 1/4 cup in a saucepan before adding). It still turned out great. will definitely become a winter staple.

Have made this soup several times now and have enjoyed it each time. I would normally give this a four forks rating but like some others I have found the end product somewhat bland as written without adding other ingredients to pick it up. I have added basil and oregano to liven it up but even that fell a little short. The last time I made this I felt I needed to add some vinegar to bring some life to it and that appeared to help a bit. Next time, I will try some Tabasco or something similar to bring a bit of a kick to it. Overall, though, this soup is a keeper and will continue to be made in my kitchen.

I made this recipe almost exactly as given. The only differences were that I used chicken broth to cook the beans after soaking overnight as the remainder cooked. Then added them for about 1 hour of additional cooking with the soup complete. I also made almost the same recipe using beef chuck roast (2 lbs.) instead of pancetta. It makes a fantastic vegetable beef soup as well.

It might be easy to pass over a recipe for Minestrone. Your eyes glaze over as you experience flashbacks of banquet hall buffets or cans of Campbell's soup. However, this is a different story. I followed the recipe as if I were in a test kitchen, deviating not one iota (unusual for me). This is a very hearty, substantial main course meal that relies on good fresh ingredients for it's success. I was nervous about using so much olive oil but the recipe makes so much soup that it isn't a problem. Would not change a thing.

Fabulous soup - rave reviews every time I make it. Can be modified endlessly, although I try to use the savoy cabbage whenever possible. For a milder taste, I use summer squash instead of zucchini, and fresh tomatoes instead of canned (I get "seconds" at the farmers market; great for soup). Canned beans make life alot easier.

I think of Minestrone as the Clark Kent of soups; able to cure a common cold or lighten a world weary heart. I was happy enough with the recipe as written but something was missing for me and I went back to 2 of my fave Italian Restaurants to find what it was. It's the broth. It's the tangy yet savory quality of the broth that urges one forward to the next bite and ultimately to the rest of ones' day. The soup is nurturing because it's clearish and because it's so easy to eat. I bumped up the pancetta to 1/3 a pound to give the broth a more straightforward character that the rind and the pureed beans obscured. I did not puree the beans because it clouds the broth and makes it too thick for me. I had tried the rind of Reggiano as other reviewers recommended but dispensed with it on my second approach because it took away the brightness of the broth. I had bumped up the vegetables in the first round which was a mistake, I brought them back to the amounts ordered which increased the broth. I added 6 3/4 cup of stock, the juice from the Tomatoes as well as the liquid in the can of beans. I also added 2 times the garlic and 2 shallots and sauteed them with the onions before adding the rest of the vegetables. The mise en place for this soup is not particularly labor intensive, I enjoy trying to get all the vegetables the same size. I reduced the potato to 1 small one because there were more beans present since they were not pureed and I added 3/4 cup of cooked small shell pasta. The dessert to this soup, without question, is the banana bread with chocolate chips and walnuts.

Rating: 4
Delicious! Definitely a recipe for keeps that you can modify based on whatever you have on hand. I made this recipe sans beans, potatoes or kale, but with a 1/2 cup cooked pasta thrown in near the end of cooking. I love the fact that no seasonings are necessary.

The best minestrone soup that I've ever made - more like restaurant minestrone than a variation on vegetable soup (which is what mine usually tastes like). A few alterations: more like 2-3 cups of cabbage; used 2-3 cups of spinach instead of kale; and added an extra cup or two of chicken broth.

Rating: 4
I used bacon, canned [kidney and pinto] beans, and beefed up the vegetables - and THIS SOUP ROCKS. I love how healthy it is, full of vitamins and DELICIOUS, and also how it made SO MUCH! I used the biggest pot I have, and it was filled to the brim. At this point, I've eaten the soup all week and finally had some room to add in several cups of pasta and beef broth to eat (and freeze) even more. I'd never made minestrone before and was a little apprehensive, but this soup is unstoppable!!!

This soup is delicious and satisfying...and an efficient way to use random veggies on hand before they expire. I used a bit of leftover applewood smoked ham and just 2 slices of black pepper bacon which added to the broths flavor. Only had a cup of cabbage, I have also used spinach in the past and it was tasty. Homegrown tomatoes into the brew. I also used kidney, as well as white beans...nice variety. This is an excellent soup any time of year.

A lot of chopping. I am slow so I started early, but the results were worth it. Made enough for 3 dinners for 4 people. Substituted spinach for kale and added some turkey smoked sausage with the prosciutto. Was surprised it didn't need any additional spices. I didn't even add salt!

Agree with most other reviews - this is soup is fantastic. An excellent hearty Minestrone. Empty bowls in our house. A few add on thoughts: 1. There's a lot to this recipe, but it certainly doesn't take 3+ hours to prep. 2. I cooked it all day, and it really didn't thicken for a few hours after adding the puree - recomend cooking longer than recipe calls for. 3. Following other suggestions, I subbed turkey bacon. This turned out well, but I used 8 ounces of bacon...I should have used much less.

My boyfriend and roommate just finished eating this dish. My boyfriend loves veggies and my roommate is the pickiest man on the face of the earth.. they absolutely LOVED IT!! I agree with them..it was delicious and full of flavor. Some shortcuts I used: -Use canned beans and use the juice -After you open the canned tomatoes, use your kitchen shears to coarsley chop/cut the tomatoes IN THE CAN, then drain the juice. (Less Messy!) -I added small shape pasta, cooked separately, then added to the soup. YUM! Since the pasta will quickly absorb the minestrone liquid, I diluted the soup by stirring in chicken broth. -Give yourself plenty of time to make this dish...the prep work takes a large amount of time. Will definitely add this recipe to my "cold- weather" recipes!!

Made this time with very lean good bacon instead of pancetta. Really missed the flavor! Instead of kale & green beans used chard & extra zucchini(much later in the cooking). Still delicious & better than all others, but non-vegetarians, please use pancetta. To Crunchy Beans: if you used dried-I have shared your experience in years past. For soups I use well rinsed & drained canned. So much easier & NO crunchy beans. Also, every cook decides how much extra liquid may be needed & when. This is why we cook.

Hmmm -- Chrunchy beans... Anyway, I alwas use a pressure cooker with beans. Other than that, I skipped the bacon and potatoes and added some raw pasta in the last few minutes of cooking. Good recipe but don't be afraid to add more liquid if needed. A cup of dry white wine helps.

Have made this soup many times - both with meat and vegetarian. Always excellent. Prep not so bad with large very sharp knife for cabbage/kale.

I use baby new potatoes with skin for more vitamins, but with all the healthy ingredients, it hardly needs modifying. Yummm!

I would not make this soup again. I make tons of soup, this is the least user-friendly recipe I have ever seen! First of all, there wasn't enough liquid in the directions. There wasn't enough flavor so I added the juice from the tomatoes. Lastly, the beans weren't nearly cooked enough after 15 minutes, they were still crunchy. I followed the recipe exactly, with the times and everything. I wasn't impressed. This soup needs some work.

A very close friend of mine in his early 50's grew up in an Italian immigrant household, with mom & grandma in the kitchen every day making food "from back home". I made this minestrone on a cold Sunday night and invited my friend over for some soup & a movie. When he walked in and smelled the minestrone, he got very choked up because he said it smelled EXACTLY like his house did as a kid, with the perpetual soup (or sauce) pot simmering away. Needless to say, the soup tasted out-of-this-world! It really took my friend back to a special time in his childhood, and I'm glad I could help do that for him. Thanks for an outstanding recipe! ô¿ô

With a few, minor modifications, this is a truly great minestrone. First, and foremost, add a healthy chunk of parmesan reggiano rind to the first simmer (remove before serving). Secondly, add cooked ditalini(1-2 cups cooked) to the soup during the last 15 minutes of cooking (I always add another cup+ of chicken broth to the first simmer to accommodate the pasta.) Do NOT add uncooked pasta to the soup or it will absorb all the soup liquid. Finally, if you don't have pancetta, don't make this soup--bacon just doesn't cut it.

I used this recipe as a base, then created my own rendition. Used finely chopped beef flap meat to make it heartier. Omitted the pancetta. Seared beef in olive oil then added the onion, garlic, celery, carrots, and potatoes. Sauteed for a few minutes and seasoned lightly with salt and freshly ground pepper. Added 14oz. can of diced tomatoes, and beef stock. Shortly afterwards added a 4" piece of parmesan rind, chopped kale, italian green beans, zucchini, cannelini beans, and apprx. .5c. of small pasta shells. Simmered for 15 mins. then added 1/3c. of basil chiffonade. Remove cheese rind. Topped with grated parmesan, and served with a crusty kalamata olive, and assiago cheese bread, and a spicy Shiraz. Prep probably takes less time for me since I am a food service professional. Having your mise en place is important for certain preparations, but I would say to not feel that making soup has to be so precise and exact. A handful of this and that according to the amount of stock, season well, and don't overcook. Be creative and have fun!

Boy, is this ever good! It does take a LONG time to prep (started chopping at 3pm for a 6pm meal) but surprisingly worth it in the end. What a great way to take your vitamins! Skipped the pancetta for the vegetarian in the family, used canned, rinsed canneloni beans, added extra tomatoes with juice, and collards which were delicious in it. Looking forward to having leftovers for lunch today. Would add more carrots next time. Super healthy and delicious. Thought I would miss the pasta but didn't at all.

WoW! Excellent soup! First, let me warn everybody that this recipe takes a long time in prep. I started cooking the onions in the oil and thought I'd just chop and dice veggies as I went along. Wrong-O! I had to take the pot off the heat because it took me an hour and 45 minutes to chop all the veggies. I gave some of this soup to 2 people and they loved it. I did use the kale and I liked the flavor and texture of the kale in the soup. I added a can of kidney beans at the end and we all really enjoyed that addition. I will definitely make this soup again and next time I will add more of the canned northern beans. I did like the pureed beans added to the broth because it added substance to the soup. Oh, and I left out any meat and used vegetable broth and it was a wonderful vegetarian treat.

Made this soup today and am very impressed. I omitted the bacon to make it vegetarian and replaced the potatoes with 1/2 cup of small macaroni which i added with the beans. My local produce market did not have any Kale so I replaced it with spinach which turned out quite well. I also put the end of my parmesan cheese into the broth to add some extra flavor. I used cannellini beans which only need a 4 hour soak so i put them in the water at noon and after simmering for 45mins they were plenty soft.

This was very good, although I did not care for the kale- next time I will use spinach. I think that the pancetta is a must- it really enhances the flavor of the broth. Some changes I made were: I threw in a leek since I had one in the fridge, I substituted a yellow squash for one of the zucchini for color, and I used canned kidney beans since I had them already. Also, I threw in a half cup of ditalini pasta during the last 15 minutes, because I think that good minestrone soup needs pasta. Like many of the previous reviewers mentioned, you will need to add a lot more broth if you don't want it too stewy- I think I at least doubled the amount.

Excellent vegetarian version without pancetta. Used 1 15 ounce can canelli beans and added cooked small pasta (3/4 cup dried). Used spinach instead of kale and didn't drain tomatoes. All-in-all, a real winner for the family. Will make again and again.

"Best minestrone I've ever had," said my husband! Not bad for my first attempt! I used escrole instead of cabbage & kale, and added the sauce in the can of tomatoes. I also added Ditalini macaroni to the soup because that's the way hubby likes it. YUMMY! Even my in-laws want the recipe! Definitely make this recipe - you won't be disappointed.

This is the best minestrone I have made. It was just as good, if not better, than a good restaurant's minestrone. I still can't believe it! I like a beefy minestrone, so I browned about a pound of boneless beef shortribs with a carrot, celery stalk, yellow onion. Added water to cover & simmered until the meat was completely tender. Removed the fat the next day & strained the broth. I also picked through the beef and added that to the soup. I used two cans of kidney beans(forgot to buy the canellini ones), well drained & rinsed. One can in the soup and one cooked with 3-4 whole garlic pieces. I mashed that and added at the end. I didn't add the tomatoes(didn't want) or green beans(forgot, again!), I did add about 1/2 cup macaroni. I doubled the receipe. FANTASTIC! A little grated parmesan on the top and some good Italian bread. What more could you want on a cold winter's day?

I love this minestrone recipe? This is my 3rd time making this soup and I always get thumbs-up. I do add a few fresh basil leaves and some small shell pasta (just my preference). I left out the kale the last two times I made this soup and it is still fantastic.

Don't know whether my opinion really counts, since I'm an experienced cook who had never made minestrone and was looking for the basic flavor idea. Used turkey broth, beef buillion, red beans, white beans, tubetti, spinach, savoy, purple potatoes, no meat. Diced and chopped (pureed nothing), then added 3 oz. of pesto, lots of pepper. Colorful and delicious.

Ok, so I didn't follow the recipe EXACTLY. I used kidney beans instead of white, shredded frozen zuchinni instead of slicing fresh and had no green beans. But you know what? This is AWESOME! (What will it be like when I follow directions explicitly?!!!)

Rating: 4
This was yummy! I added the juice from the diced tomatoes, and also added some more stock (2 cups I think). This was such a heary meal with salad on the side, my meat eating boyfriend LOVED it. Luckily I made extra for freezing. (I dont see the need to use dried beans. Canned worked great--rinsed of course)

I don't cook very often, but this soup recipe is magnificent as written. I have made it several times, the kale makes the dish. And happily, it makes a generous amount, because it freezes very well. One of the standby in my house.

Read through many of the posts and took several of the suggestions (thank you!), including using canned beans (white northern), savoy cabbage and spinach. Used 1/2 lb. sweet italian turkey sausage (the only thing I had on hand), no-salt diced tomatoes (a staple for me), and the relatively new Swanson organic chicken broth (lower sodium). I don't cook 'low salt' because of health reasons or anything like that - just think it tastes better and fresher. Added dried basil and added the zucchini and green beans s little later to keep their color and shape. Also added cooked small macaroni. Added more broth/water to taste and included all of the liquid from the 2 cans of tomatoes. Before I added the beans, I drained/rinsed them and pureed about a half can. Will leave them whole next time. Did not need to any additional salt at all (the salt from the sausage and broth was enough I guess). Husband and 19-month old picky toddler enjoyed this. Will make again.

Just made the soup today and will be having it tonight for dinner. Omitted the bacon and added spinach instead of kale. Didn't puree the beans either. I think I would add the zucchini and the green beans before serving instead of letting them simmer with the rest of the ingredients for an hour. They turned a little greyish and mushy. I prefer them bright green and with a little bite to them. Overall, a good soup.

This recipe was fabulous and smelled wonderful while cooking. A lot of slicing and dicing but well worth the time.

Fab-u-lous! I added more of the veggies called for, substituted spinich for kale and used regular cabbage. I used canned veggie broth and one can of white beans one of kidney...fresh parm. cheese when it's done on top and a dollop of pesto...it's wonderful. If you add more pasta than a cup it becomes this wonderful veggie pasta sauce and not soup at all...Great vegitarian meal on it's own..just add some good bread.

Delicious soup. I used quite a bit more stock than the recipe called for (I wanted it soupy instead of more "stewy") and had to substitute spinach for kale, which I couldn't get. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 4
Yes, it takes time to cut and prepare and cook but it's worth every minute. I used bacon instead of pancetta, spinach instead of kale, added some small elbow macaroni and significantly more liquid, some of which was beef broth. Used canned great northern beans and lizuid and didn't puree. Also additional salt and pepper. My husband, loved it. Good thing, I made a double batch.

Rating: 3
Agree that there is not enough liquid for this recipe. Had to add a LOT more stock and water. Pancetta/bacon is not appropriate for a true minestrone so leave out. Spend the extra money and use the Savoy cabbage-milder and better tasting. Use part beef and part chicken stock for richer flavor. Using just chicken stock doesn't seem to cut it. Didn't puree beans either. Used canned white beans and worked fine also used part canned kidney beans. Much quicker than starting from dried beans.

Rating: 4
This soup is wonderful! My Italian husband declared it the best soup I've ever made (and I cook ALOT). I made the following changes: used dried cannelini beans; used Niman bacon - SMOKY! - and omitted olive oil; omitted green beans and potatoes. Used Muir Glen Organic Fire Roasted Chopped Tomatoes, NOT drained. 3 cups chicken stock. Didn't bother pureeing beans, just dumped into pot, liquid and all. Awesome minestrone! about 3 hours from quick soaking beans to table.

Delicious, despite some shortcuts. I used good bacon instead of pancetta (can't get it here), about 2 cups of regular green cabbage instead of savoy (ditto), and canned white beans. Also forgot to get green beans, but it didn't seem to matter. Served it with rosemary foccacia and a green salad for a winter dinner. Would also be good with ditalini or other small pasta added.

This was a great thick soup that got a little thicker as it sat in the frig. I had it with lasagna and garlic bread but it would make a meal in itself with salad. I may make it with spinach the next time as the prior reviewer suggested.

Great soup! I made this for an italian dinner party and recieved rave reviews from my guests.

Rating: 3
Wow, so many reviews! My husband really liked this Minestrone, although we agree that it's different than the "traditional" Minestrone we've had before. I used bacon because the Pancetta was $15/lb at the grocery store! I took the advise of others and added an extra cup of chicken broth (next time I'll add a total of two extra cups), and in the last 15 min, I threw in a can of Northern beans, a can of garbanzo beans, and three handfuls of small shell pasta. Also, next time I would reduce the amounts of Kale & Cabbage (and maybe even change to Kale and Spinach)

Rating: 3
Great recipe. You can add or omit whatever you want and still have a great minestrone, but I think the kale makes this a very different dish.

Rating: 3
I made it for some friends and everyone raved. I did not use any kale because I was unable to find any at the grocery store. We did not miss it. The soup was very good and low-fat.

Rating: 3
I used thick cut bacon, but would prefer pancetta next time. I substituted escarole for kale. And I used savoy cabbage... Overall, I liked this recipe very much, but I had to double the chicken broth to get a reasonably soupy consistency. Minestrone is supposed ot have some broth, and when mad as instructed, this comes out too thick. Just make sure to have some extra broth on hand to adjust it to your taste in the end.

This is a great soup , excellant to use up items like frozen celery tops you have frozen so the celery fits in frig veggy bin . I used smoked bacon hock instead of pancetta , stripped the meat from the bone after it has simmered in the soup . also used a small artichoke [ the ones that grow underground] its quite a stong flavour but seems to form a symmetry with the garlic to form a new flavour . I have tried various beans but found black eye beans best - they do not have tough skins although the ones you put through the kitchen wizz looks like brown mud . You need to take care with salt as the canned tomaotes, bacon hock and stock cubes are quite salty - I found none was needed , Ground black pepper added when you are sweating off the onions etc is the way to go . A great winter soup !

Just made this tonight and served to a very picky friend...WOW! I did make a few changes, however. Used applewood smoked bacon in lieu of pancetta (delicious). Also, used vegetable broth in place of chicken broth, since this is a vegetable based soup. I used spinach in place of the kale. Since I like my vegetables with a little bit of crunch, I added the zucchini and green beans (fresh) toward the end. Also, used canned white beans rather than cooking from scratch. In a soup with so many ingredients, you really can't taste the difference. Also, threw in a bay leaf along with basil and oregano for flavor. The ultimate finishing touch is to add a dollop of pesto to the bowl, along with fresh grated parmesan. Who needs the bruschetta....we had a fresh loaf of ciabatta, dipped it in olive oil, and THEN the soup. Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow! Made 6 quarts. Wonderful, wonderful soup...and great website. Thanks, from a passionate cook.

Absolutely an unbelievable soup. I'm giving it 4 forks for its versatility and scrumptiousness. Obviously, substitutions work very well--I used canned canellini beans, substituted a smoked ham shank in place of the pancetta, and added cubed acorn squash in place of half of the potatoes. It keeps wonderfully for about 5 days in the 'fridge, and can be frozen as well with decent result. It does make a very thick "stew" so if you prefer a thinner minestrone, I would either decrease the cooking time so the potatoes don't break down, skip pureeing the beans, or add a bit of wine or broth to thin.

Rating: 4
this recipe is a good point to start from. you can add or subtract whatever vegetables you want *note the "cook from Orland Park"-- changed the whole recipe totally--lol. I personally left out the kale and spinach, but added a large head of escarole shredded and and a little cooked pasta. was a perfect supper with a nice grilled cheese on the side.

This is indeed an awesome soup. I did a bit of substitution based upon what was in my cupboard. Skipped the green beans (never had minestrone w/green beans? huh) threw in frozen chopped spinach in the end and substituted bacon for pancetta. Also added elbow macaroni. Perfect!

Rating: 4
This is my favorite soup I've ever made!!! Got rave reviews from husband and my picky non-veggie-eating sister even had some. After reviewing multiple minestrone recipes for ingredients I know I like, I made some adjustments and ended up with >30 ingredients and barely had a pot big enough (8 qt), but all the chopping was well worth it. I can't wait to make this again (with a bigger pot!). Used two 15-oz canned beans (one pureed) - maybe next time will add even one add'l can. Upped to .4 lb pancetta, and doubled the celery, onions & potatoes. Substituted bok choy for the cabbage, and also added 3 leeks, 3 turnips, 1/2 yam (leftover) - all chopped. Added 2/3 c. dry red wine, about 1-1/2 lb. sweet turkey sausage (out of casings, pan-fried and patted with paper towels to de-grease), 8-10 good splashes Tabasco, and spices: rosemary, basil, oregano, thyme - all to taste. Yes, with all these ingredients I needed much more water. Nixed the chicken broth altogether, and in place used minimum 10 C. water with 2 T. chicken base (Better Than Bouillon is awesome if you can find it) and 3+ T. beef base. I always seem to add more base than is directed on the package. Finally, added 4 oz. small pasta (ditalini - sp?). Skimmed some of the "froth" and fat from the top while it was cooking. Absolutely freaking fantastic.

Great soup; easy. I substituted a bag of mixed frozen veggies for the green beans and spinach for the kale/cabbage. I, too, used canned tomatoes and included their juice. I also added a couple of tablespoons of toasted fennel seeds and a handful of both chopped italian parsley and fresh basil at the end. Good recipe for dinner one night with enough to freeze for a no-cook dinner down the road.

This is my new favoite soup. We skip pureeing the beans to reduce cleanup time, and have found that using Slavic style smoked pork loin adds greater complexity to the dish.

This was a PHENOMENAL, hearty, wholesome soup, although I'm not sure it is an authentic "minestrone!" I first made it strictly following the recipe. The next time I cut down on the work by using canned white beans, canned diced tomatoes (drained), and frozen cut green beans (couldn't find organic fresh). There was no discernable difference in the outcome, and it was much less time consuming. I usually make the "light minestrone" recipe on this site, but it requires much more work and is not nearly as substantial as this soup. Pureeing the beans is what gives it the wonderfully creamy texture!

I really liked this soup! I am not a good cook and it turned out great. I used canned beans and blended up one can to thicken the soup. I also put in more Italian Season.

I made this dish vegetarian, without the pancetta, so I think I should have added more seasoning to help the flavor a little bit. The kale was way too much and I would cut down on that next time and also add much more broth or tomatoes as I prefer minestrone with a little more soup to it as opposed to a mound of vegetables with a bit of liquid. Despite not being totally happy with the dish, when I get the urge again, I will try this recipe with some changes.

Rating: 4
Very satisfying & delicious. I made a vegetarian version skipping the pancetta and substituting vegetable stock for the chicken stock. I also felt the soup needed some seasoning and added 2 tsp of italian seasoning and a dash of tobasco.I also added an additional 1-2 cups of stock because it was so thick.This makes a LARGE pot of soup and I will definitely make it again & again.

I have made this recipe several times now, and each time I change it a little. This time I added some black pepper, crushed red pepper, italian seasoning, and some diced tomatoes with juice. The recipe comes out better each time.

These were my additions and omissions.....no beans or kale. I added an extra can of tomato sauce and extra garlic. I also added yellow squash for colour which was nice. I used Italian sweet sausage instead of the panchetta, which was a nice treat. After simmering I added 3 cps of cooked pasta, which in my opinion makes it minestrone. However, this addition really soaks up the sauce. So if you go this route add much more liquid, AS THE OTHER COOKS BEFORE, IT DOES BECOME STEW LIKE.......ADD MORE BROTH, TOMATO SAUCE SOMETHING!!!!! The flavor is wonderfull but I also added parsley, basil, thyme, and oregano.....and mine needed salt.....ENJOY!!!!

Fabulous! Next time I will cut down on the cooking time for the veggies as I, too, like them more crisp. Also added tomatoes with garlic and basil, and a scattering of bay leaves to the simmering soup. Lovely with the bread and a simple salad - followed by the Biscotti Parfait recipe you can find on this site - however, see my note on substitutions for that recipe!!!

I thought this was great. This was the first time I have ever made this soup and it came out better than most restaurants. I am Italian and my boyfriend is everything but.

I loved this recipe. Some changes I made: I left the beans whole, used one half bermuda, one half white onion, used lean pepper encrusted bacon, used all the bean stock, added one cup of Zinfandel, 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper, a good amount of fresh ground pepper. Also I used crushed tomatoes with roasted garlic and Italian spices. Made enough soup for three days!

I'm a soup lover, and this is definitely a keeper. I served it to neighbors on a cold night, with the bruschetta recipe recommended and a tossed green salad with fruit and homemade dressing. Everyone had seconds. The bruschetta ia EASY and delicious. Used Canadian bacon for the soup, which worked wonderfully. Also ended up adding all of the bean stock, and an entire large can of College Inn chicken broth -- would have been too thick for me otherwise. And it's beautiful, too!

This was by far the best Minestrone I've had. It was rich and hearty. The recipe needed alot more bean stock to turn it from stew to soup. I also added some basil, thyme, and rosemary. And since I like my vegetables on the crisp side, I cut back on the simmering time. I would definitely recommend this recipe.

I have made this twice and everyone has loved it! Some ideas for substitutions: I made it with extra garlic, added about 1 tsp. crushed red pepper, and about 3/4 cup red wine. I used the Italian spiced crushed tomatoes and regular bacon. Didn't need to use any of the olive oil with the bacon drippings. Also, I used Chinese long beans instead of green beans for their nutty taste. Oh, and canned white beans worked just fine. This is a wonderful recipe. And it also freezes very well.

I was craving minestrone soup, but not the recipes I've tried in the past. This is by far the best minestrone I've ever had. Tried it out on several friends, and they all want the recipe! I added some small macaroni shells, thyme and fresh basil. I diced up a pound of smoked sausage, browned it and add that, too. Also added more liquid than the recipe calls for. And it's still thick and rich. With crusty garlic bread and a nice merlot, it made a perfect dinner for a cold Alaskan night........

I made this for my strictly vegetarian and vegetable-selective teen-aged daughter. It was a hit even with the "strange" vegetables.
