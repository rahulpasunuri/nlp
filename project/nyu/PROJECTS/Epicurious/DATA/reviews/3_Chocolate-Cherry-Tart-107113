Huge disappointment. The filling is a gelatinous goo that loses the cherry taste completely and just tastes like sweetened corn syrup. The only saving grace is the crust, which would make a good base for a peanut butter pie or some other filling that would stand up well to a thick chocolate crust.

Made this for a Christmas tea, and it got decent if not raving reviews. Assembly was fairly straightforward, though it is definitely a two-day affair. I agree with Manchester that the cherry flavor didn't come through strong enough, but next time I'll put the leftover kirsch mixture into a small pitcher and pour a little on top of each slice. I also agree with other reviewers that the tart only needs 45-50 minutes instead of a full hour.

Substituting for corn syrup is not as straightforward as mixing sugar with liquid. Although that method would give you the appropriate quantity of sweetness and moisture, the qualities of the sugar are different. I haven't made the recipe without corn syrup, so I'm not sure, but in many cases, leaving out the corn syrup can lead to crystallization. If you must do without it, I would try a cane syrup (Steen's or Lyle's Golden), honey, or some sort of invert syrup (like trimoline--not easy to find retail). Or you could make your own invert syrup--simple syrup with acid added. Mix 2 parts sugar and one part water with a pinch of cream of tartar or juice of half a lemon and boil gently for approximately 20 minutes.

I served this tart for Christmas and was a bit disappointed. The tart was very chocolatey, but I thought not sweet or rich enough, lacking a strong enough cherry taste. I found it to be a bit dry too, although I did take other reviewers advice and cooked it 10 minutes less than the stated cooking time.

Very easy to make and enjoyed by my guests. However, mine seperated like in a pecan pie - don't know what that's about. Should the chocolate be melted before mixing in?

Fantastic dessert- very elegant and very easy to make. I wouldn't really change a thing about this- although I made it in an 11" tart pan and it was plenty. People have asked for the recipe and it's perfect for the holidays.

My wife's absolute favorite homemade desert. I found tart cherries work, too.

2 cups corn syrup equals 1 cup sugar plus 1/4 cup additional liquid. I would therefore presume that you could calculate the substitution for the smaller amount called for in this recipe (sorry, you get to do the math!) You could also try honey, which is similar in sweetening power to the sugar (slightly sweeter), and eliminates the issue of liquid vs. dry sweetener. If the issue is a corn allergy, check with your local health food store. They are often wonderful resources for this kind of substitutions. Good luck!

Very, very good ! I did cut down on the butter in the crust because I thought 2 sticks these days is a little over indulgent!

Absolutely decadent and delicious. A big hit at my recent potluck. I found Bing cherries at Trader Joe's. Follow the recipe exactly and especially let the Cherry syrup soak overnite. Keep eye on it baking--don't overbake. Taste better on the moist side.

Have made this twice now and our dinner party guests have definitely enjoye it. Be sure to check it after 45 minutes of baking. It can get too dry and you want a moist center. Dried bing cherries are hard to find here so I substituted tart ones the last time. Did not seem to make much of a difference.
