This is an exceptional tempura recipe. The batter was light and very crispy. I followed another reviewers suggestion and sat the batter down in an ice bath. Delicious!

Delicious! Be sure to read the tips in the description above the recipe. These are really important and probably should have been included in the recipe directions. I used sparkling mineral water and had to substitute most of the baking powder with baking soda (ran out of powder). I also chilled the bowl, flour and sesame oil before adding the water. I think this made a difference in making the batter light and crispy. I've seen another recipe that calls for half wheat and half rice flour and might try that next time. If you're making alot, I would suggest mixing half the batter ingredients first and then mixing the second half just before you're ready. The batter definitely changes after it sits and warms, and the cooking process takes some time. Maybe putting the batter in an ice water bath would also help. Used salmon instead of shrimp, oyster mushrooms instead of shiitake, and sweet potato instead of lotus root. Also added broccoli. Made the sauce with soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar and grated ginger.

I followed this recipe meticulously and the batter did not cling to the shrimp and vegetables. It all tasted fine, but it lacked that wonderful coating that's the reason for eating tempura.

made this last night for my sister- in-law's bday. she and her family had just been to Vegas and had asparagus tempura at a restaurant there. This recipe was a huge hit with everyone including the kids and all said it was BETTER than what they had in Vegas. I made my own dipping sauce with some mayo, hot chili oil, sesame oil, rice wine vinegar, ground ginger, soy sauce and chipotle chili powder. yummmmm.

I used the batter to tempura lotus root. It was very good. Will use the batter recipe again.
