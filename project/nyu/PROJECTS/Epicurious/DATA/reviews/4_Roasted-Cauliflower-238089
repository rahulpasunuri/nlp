We loved this! Super yummy golden caramelized florets! I used good quality olive oil and sea salt, roasted for 25 at 400( my oven runs hot) Give it try it really is easy and delicious!

Simple, quick and easy to make. From a head of Cauliflower to great dish in no time. This will make you think differently of Cauliflower forever.

I used Cheddar cauliflower, which is nice because it retains the bright yellow-orange color when cooked. It take about 45 minutes and about halfway through, i added a half dozen cloves of fresh garlic, slightly smashed. The garlic carmelized nicely along with the rest. One head does really shrink so I would double the amount of cauliflower next time. Delicious and well received by my dinner companions.

Mine took 55 minutes to be well roasted/ slightly charred. I always roast 3 heads of cauliflower when I make this recipe - it's good both hot and cold!

Yummy and simple. Ended up roasting about 40-45 min. until nicely browned crispy edges.

My Kids (9 and 12) ate the entire pan! They said it was as good as french fries and that says it all for me.

Well, this was incredibly easy, but from the rave reviews I was expecting more flavour (had not roasted cauliflower before...). It was tasty, but the taste is not due to any magic from the recipe but the natural flavour of plain oil cooked cauliflower! I would only make it again because it's quicker than other recipes I've tried (i.e. less work). But I would definitely try adding some herbs or something.

I'm not getting what everyone else is. I didn't find this that wonderful, but it was still fine for a quick weekday side dish.

Love this! Sometimes I'll roast it longer and it'll start to caramelize (however I usually add a touch more olive oil and I do stir quite often). My two year old also loves it!

All the enthusiastic reviews made me try this recipe. Big disappointment ensued! The cauliflower didn't taste sweet at all and the whole house now smells like cooking cauliflower. I followed the recipe faithfully. I will go back to steaming the cauliflower and dressing it with buttered bread crumbs, that really tastes good!

Wow. Cauliflower never tasted so good! We were fighting over them! I actually added 4 carrots since the one head didn't look like enough for 4 and I'm glad I did because they really shrink when roasting. Make lots! They're like potato chips (with no guilt) ;) This will be a staple in my house :)

I love this - a new food to obsess on. I added some fresh ground pepper at the beginning and it got nice and spicy because the florets shrank so much. Nice fresh from the oven or at room temperature. A splash of lemon at the end adds nice brightness.

Roasted Cauliflower really is a great alternative to the steamed cauliflower. Great flavor. Like previously noted, you can change the flavore with diff seasonings. My husband commeted, "if we had a restaurant we would serve this. It's not that common..."

love love love cauliflower this way. I've also made adding paprika and it is delicious either way. A head of cauliflower shrinks up so much, I could easily make two and still have no leftovers!

Rating: 4
This was excellent! And oh so easy. It's also very adaptable to your own taste -- you can spice it up any way you want. I've steamed cauliflower for years, and there's no comparison to roasting. It was more flavorful, and the the texture was good. After reading various reviews (and various recipes elsewhere), I minced a whole head of garlic to toss in, because we love garlic in this household. I also sprinkled in grated cheese in the last 10 minutes of cooking. And I did NOT use any salt, because we have health issues here. And still delicious.

Rating: 4
Delicious, and oh so easy. On a similar note, a friend told me about roasted brussel sprouts which she said tasted like gourmet potato chips...she's right!! They are incredibly tasty, and all you have to do is toss them with a little olive oil and salt. If you like this recipe, you will love roasted brussel sprouts.

I added Tumeric because of the health benefits,a bit of garlic powder & curry powder. I could not stop eating it. I used less salt because of the additional spices I added.

Absolutely delicious! My favorite restaurant in LA, Gjelina's Makes the most delicious roasted cauliflower dish. Up until now I would have to spend upwards of 15 dollars just for a side of this but now I can eat it whenever I want!

I grew up eating my mother's overcooked, waterlogged, flavorless boiled cauliflower and never would have believed that roasting could turn this vegetable into something so delicious. I've made this for family members who say they hate cauliflower -- until they try a piece! One bite and no matter how much I've made, it's never enough! I've been asked to make a big, big tray of this for Thanksgiving dinner. I do roast it a little longer than the recipe states, as we like it pretty browned and crusty.

Very good as is, but we also love it with malt vinegar sprinkled on while still warm...yum!

Good, good, good. Nice flavor and easy to make. I did add a handful of 'homemade' raisins (grapes that I air dried into raisins) and some good pecorino romana cheese. Will definitely make again. I served the cauliflower with B.A. Sicilian Tuna.

Delicious! Truly like candy; we couldn't stop eating it! (my wife and I ate a whole head before, during, and after the main course!) Since a previous review mentioned adding shallots, and I had about 2T of leftover shallots from last night, I added them as well. Wonderful!

Cauliflower at a high heat is a good idea. I've been experimenting with spice mixtures to kick this dish up a notch, so far I like a turmeric/fresh black pepper/sesame/kosher salt blend. It comes out looking interesting. I'm tempted to try fresh ginger as well.

when your 10 year old says ... "uh mom, isn't there any more?" ... it's a good sign that it was a hit. Used a bit more olive oil, and sliced the head. When done, sprinkled 1/2 with kosher salt and 1/2 with grated parmesan. YUM!

Have made this for years. My husband would not eat cauliflower and now requests this vegetable. Crunchy, carmelized, sweet - it's really good.

Great way to do cauliflower. Like others, I added shallots to the mix. While I would definitely do this again and it was a good dish, it doesn't get the coveted four forks because, let's face it, it's cauliflower tossed in olive oil - more creativity is needed for the four forks. But that is not to say that the dish isn't great and you shouldn't do it - you should.

I made this with fresh and delicate cauliflower from my CSA. Delicious. Easy. You have to make this!

This really gets eaten! Try to keep the chunks as uniform in size as you can. I used gray salt and served this with crabcakes and a salad of arugula with orange slices, avocado, and red onion. A hit!

This recipe has become a family staple ever since I first prepared it. Everyone loves it! I always make sure to serve it straight from the oven- otherwise it can become soggy. My only suggestion is to use smaller pieces than the recipe suggests; the little pieces cook faster and also tend to get a sweeter, crispier taste. Oh- and make lots! This gets eaten seriously fast!

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! Almost burned my fingers grabbing the smallest bits off the cookie sheet! Did need another tablespoon or so of oil so that it wouldn't stick, but otherwise it's perfect the way it is.

This is one of my favorite ways to serve cauliflower. The fresher it is, the sweeter the flavor. Try it with the orange and purple varieties --roasting deepens the colors, gorgeous and delicious!

You can also slice the caulifower into 1 inch thick slices and roast it that way. Just great!

Fantastic recipe; what could be easier. To feed four you'll need a few heads, though. Sea salt flakes are key, rather than tablesalt.

Follow other reviewers comments and add onions/shallots! I tossed the caulilflower with oil/salt directly in a 9x13 glass casserole dish, sprinkled about 1cup of sliced shallots on top. Amazing. Added a little sea salt after it was removed from the oven. Delicious as is. The next day I tried it with some grated parmesan-reggiano, which does add some extra nutty/creaminess. It is fantastic with or without the cheese, for me, it would depend on what I was serving the cauliflower with.

I love roast caulflower all winter. I pulled up this recipe for the first time today as I couldn't remember what temp for the oven and how much oil.

I make this dish frequently, and sometimes I kick it up a bit by sprinkling on freshly grated Parmiggiano-Reggiano cheese during the last 10 minutes of roasting. The caramelized sweetness of the cauliflower, crowned with the tart nuttiness of the cheese, is divine.

This is the best and easiest cauliflower dish I've ever had. I like cauliflower under almost any circumstance, but this takes it to whole new level. Use a metal cookie sheet. Mine browned beautifully. Make it just as the directions say. 30 minutes in my convection oven at 450 was perfect. I can't wait to make it again.

This was easy and so delicious -- the roasting changes the cauliflower in a completely unexpected way -- it's like alchemy! I added a lot of garlic, in thick slices, to the roasting pan about halfway through. I'd suggest using a large head of cauliflower, however -- my husband and I finished off the whole dish ourselves. This afternoon I'm going to add this dish to multigrain penne, a la the cauliflower/linguine recipe on Epicurious, as suggested by another reviewer.

Very simple and great! After roasting, I drizzled honey over the cauliflower - not a lot - just enough to get a drop on each flower. I was serving with Indian food so I added crushed coriander and the honey added a nice and very slight touch of sweet. My guests loved it and remarked how great the honey enhanced an otherwise boring veggie.

I used to think that cauliflower was God's first attempt at broccoli (i.e. he got it wrong), but after trying this recipe, I'm a convert. I've made it twice exactly as descried, and it's pure heaven.

Absolutely delightful. Thank you Gourmet for introducing me this winter to the deliciousness of two vegetables I thought I hated: this recipe, with its melting sweetness and crunchy saltiness all at once, and Ruth Reichl's recipe for brussels sprouts and bacon at the end of "Garlic and Sapphires," which I ended up making every month!
