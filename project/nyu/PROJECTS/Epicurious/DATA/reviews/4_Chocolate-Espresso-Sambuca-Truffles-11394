These chocolate truffles are fantastic. Like some of the other cooks, my only problem was in rolling them. Found this suggestion on another site and thought I'd share it: Try cooling to "pudding consistency" then piping (with 14" pastry bag and 1/2" round tip) or scooping (with melon baller) in 1" mounds onto wax paper. Cover with plastic wrap, refrigerate, then roll into balls and coating. I haven't tried this yet, but plan to soon. One other tip: don't worry about making balls perfectly round at first- working them too much makes them melt and get messy. Better to roll and coat them quickly, then reroll and coat them after they sit for a while. If all else fails, the mini-muffin foils work well too (mixture can be reheated in double boiler to pouring consistency- I did find this out first hand).

Excellent, though a bit tricky for novice choclatiers. They turned out superb, but not without some last minute recoveries. Here were my mistakes (from which I hope you can learn from): 1) Covering the cooling mixture required sealing the plastic wrap against the chocolate mixture. Otherwise the exterior hardens substantially vs. the softer mix below, and they become difficult to roll. 2) Cool them for no more than 3 hours. After two and a half, mine were the perfect hardness for rolling. If you refrigerate overnight, you can simply leave the mixture on the counter and warm to room temperature. 3) If you prefer something else besides espresso or zambucca, you must substitute another liquid or flavouring (I used kahlua). I omitted both of them in one batch, and the mixture ended up rock hard and unrollable. I found another recipe for plain truffles. 4) Do make the effort to find real heavy creme. Whipping creme is too full of other ingredients, and does not produce as good a result as real heavy or double creme. I used 48%mf english double creme which I found in the local (large chain) grocery store.

I substituted Kahlua instead of Sambuca, since I don't like anise. They came out very nice. One tip: it's much easier to just pour the melted mixture into candy cups (those little foil things that look like baby muffin papers). Top each with a coffee bean and chill. It's quick, looks great and there's no mess. I know, it's not really a truffle then, but it's really good.

I made these for my book group. They didn't turn out the way they were supposed to, instead came out like sticky fudge. They were delicious!

I have made truffles before, but always used a mold to make it less time consuming. However, these didn't turn out of the molds very well so i had to roll them. I chilled them overnight in the fridge, let them soften for about 45 minutes at room temperature, scooped them out with a melon baller and rolled them with a mixture of cocoa and icing sugar. They were so easy to roll and turned out beautifully. I also substituted the espresso and sambuca with 3 Tsp of Amaretto in one batch and Baileys in another. This is my new truffles recipe from now on!

This is hands down the best truffle recipe on the site. I use this recipe each year for my truffle "base", substituting anything and everything for the espresso powder and sambuca. I've even used fresh raspberry juice to raves. You can also substitute white and milk chocolates, tho the finished product won't be quite as firm (or luscious in my opinion). If you're looking for a finished product that doesn't require refridgeration, this is the one!

I consider myself a decent baker and candymaker, but this was a disaster. I left the mix in the frig for 3 hours as the recipe states and it was hard as a rick. I made a huge mess trying to roll the truffles into balls. I didn't think the flavor was anything wonderful, esp not compared to the huge mess.

I'm a Chef on Cape Cod and these are perfect! I used powdered suger though for the coating.

To die for! These were absolutely the best homemade chocolates I or anyone in my chocoholic family had ever tasted. And I didn't even add liquour, as I had to make them grandmother-friendly. I used Ghirardelli bitersweet chocolate and 3 tablespoons fresh super strong espresso (the first squirts to come out of my stovetop maker). Next time I will add another flavor, but even so they were delicious. One thing, though: after chilling, my mixture was rock hard. I had to let it warm for a couple hours before I could scoop and shape it, so don't let it get too cold before forming.

These were extraordinary! I got tons of compliments! I used Bailey's instead of the Sambuca, and this worked out well. The most difficult part of preparing these was rolling them into balls. I refrigerated it overnight before rolling them, and the mixture was very hard. Of course my hands just melted them and made a sticky mess. I ended up placing a spoonful of the mixture in a square of plastic wrap and then rolling them into shape. It was time-consuming, but the end product was delicious. I agree that cocoa powder could be improved upon. I think chopped hazelnuts would be delicious.

I liked the inside of the truffle, but the unsweetened cocoa on the outside was not pleasant. I would suggest using some other type of coating.

I liked these except for the cocoa powder on the outside. I guess I prefer the chocolate coated ones. The inside is really good, and my husband loves them too.

These were stupendous! I have made several variations for bday presents - such as chopped almonds with almond extract, orange extract and orange rind, a coffee bean in the center.

These were wonderful! I made 4 batches of them at Christmas and by New Years they were gone! Instead of the espresso and Sambuca I used 3 tbsp of grand marinier, amaretto, etc. per batch.

I made these little goodies for my wine club members along with several other items. They were a huge hit! I've had special requests to make them as Valentine's gifts, too. If you've never had fresh chocolate truffles, you owe it to yourself to try these. Just wait until the chocolate is very firm and dust your palms with cocoa powder to make rolling them easier. I'll be making these again for a catering this week!

The recipe is so simple and the result so amazing - one batch is not enough! The flavour is truly "gourmet". The texture is exactly what you would want. I did dip these in dark chocolate and top each with a coffee bean. I called them my "Special Coffee" truffles and they were the first off the plate! When the mixture is hot, the flavours "come out" as the mixture cools. Be patient.

I agree, these are wonderful!!! If you run into problems shaping the truffles because the chocolate is too hard, let the mixture come down to room temperature a little. Also, you can whip up the chocolate in a KitchenAid mixer to make it soft and fluffy after it has been refrigerated. I roll the truffles on chocolate sprinkles. Whatever you do, I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe.
