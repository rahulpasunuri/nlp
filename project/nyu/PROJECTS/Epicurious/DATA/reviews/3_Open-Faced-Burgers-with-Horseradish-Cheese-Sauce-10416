My husband & I are on a low-carb diet...so, I'm always looking for some low-carb recipes that will also satisfy our culinary tastes. I have made this recipe several times with only a couple of slight revisions. I always keep 4 different kinds of peppercorns on hand (green, black,pink & white)...with a kitchen mallet, I pound them and then encrust the burger with the mixture...my husband then grills the burgers. For those of you who are looking for low-carb, this recipe is only 5.9 carbs (plus the carbs in the bun)...I use a low-carb bun from the health food store.

My wife,Godzilla, said "Not bad", and ate all of her burger. This response is not enough to make this again.

I made this for my 14 yr old step son, who is used to my attempts at more gourmet-type recipes...I figured he must be craving something like a hamburger by now...and he liked this pretty well, but agreed with me that it needed more zip. I would add more horseradish, more jalepeno, and more garlic. The suggestion of buttered Italian bread sounded good too. I might even sautee some chopped onion and add it to the sauce...or maybe the hamburger meat.

I made as printed and loved it. I did toast the rolls a little too long, but that was my fault. Really good. Served with waffle fries and a salad.

Great recipe! We are definitely going to try this one again...but with some subtle changes: Instead of the rolls, we're using thick sliced lightly buttered grilled Italian bread. Other ingredients are great..no changes needed. Horeseradish definitely gives a zip to the flavors.
