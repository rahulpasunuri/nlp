Made it exactly as directed and tossed over pink kidney beans, elbow pasta, can of sold white tuna and chopped scallions. Exceptional! This will definitely become my dressing for all salads!

Works fine with Splenda instead of sugar, but I would not recommend eliminating the sweet component for the bean salad.

Very tasty and versatile. I used it on a variation of the bean salad but I think it would go well on all types of salad.

Simple and just right. Used it on a cherry tomato and cumcumber salad and it was wonderful. Very versatile I would think.

Very nice vinaigrette - all round favorite. I would highly recommend others to try this recipe if looking for a classic dressing. Also, don't forget the sugar, it does make a big diference in rounding out the flavor.

Worked perfectly with a simple romaine salad tossed with a few veggies. Tried it for the first time with in-laws over for dinner and it was a success! It's now our house dressing.

Quick and easy and just tangy enough for a lentil and rice salad.
