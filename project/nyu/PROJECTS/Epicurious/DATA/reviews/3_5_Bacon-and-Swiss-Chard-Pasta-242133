I was tempted to alter this, make it more like carbonara. I'm glad I didn't! It was delicious as written. My only additions were 2 cloves of garlic and a small yellow onion (I only had a small red onion, not enough for 6 c.).

Made with mustard greens--outstanding flavor and texture. Mustard greens gave it a wonderful, slightly bitter edge.

So simple and easily modifiable. I wouldn't stress over exact quantities. However much chard you have and one or one a part of another onion will be fine. Same with the bacon. Or prosciutto. Or turkey bacon. But definitely add a nice amount of garlic (I used 2 large cloves for 1 bunch of chard) and add a pinch or two of red pepper flakes. As previously mentioned, really good balsamic makes it sing. And even with really great olive oil, you don't need to use quite so much. Keeper and repeater for sure!

I'm trying to figure out how 1 large onion makes 6 cups, and 2 bunches of Swiss chard makes 12 cups.

I tried this last night because I needed a quick, healthy meal and I always have chard in the fridge, used soy bacon instead (vegetarian) and whole grain linguine, came out really well, also added more balsamic vinegar, twice as much. good recipe

Delicious...but tried a new way. Equally meaty but pseudo-vegan. This coming from a committed carnivore! Enjoy! http://onehotdish.blogspot.com/2012/04/rainbow-bright-on-rainy-day-seurat-in.html

Normally I read the reviews prior to preparing the recipe. For some reason I did not this time. I prepared as is; definitely would add garlic and pepper flakes. These additions will send the meal over the top. So tasty and easy! i used campanelle pasta, husband said pappardelle. Oh, and I had a handful of golden raisins I needed to use up - so I threw those in. Coincidently, in the May 2008 Bon Appetit, right next to this recipe is a mango-radicchio caprese with basil vinaigrette that is WONDERFUL! MAKE IT!

We love chard but usually end up using it in a soup or frittata. This was really tasty and quick. I did add some red pepper flakes as suggested, but it would have been very flavorful even without.

Used prociutto instead of bacon which worked very well. Also, I added crushed garlic and red pepper flakes as other reviewers suggested. This dinner was well received by my family including teenagers. I will definitely make it again.

Easy recipe that yields delicious results for so few ingredients. I had some Swiss Chard that needed using up and happened to have the rest of the ingredients as well. For such a simple recipe, it really is delicious. I did add a few halved cherry and grape tomatoes that needed using up, and a light sprinkling of red pepper flakes, but otherwise followed the recipe. Will definitely make this the next time i have Swiss chard in my CSA.

Simply delicious. I would add more chard and garlic like mentioned here. The balsamic vinegar just goes so well with the red onions for a sweet zing to it. Making it again very soon..

wonderful flavors, the bacon and balsamic vinegar really give this exceptional flavor. Will make again and again!

Very delicious and easy to prepare. Suggestions: use the best olive oil and balsamic vinegar you can find, use plenty of bacon, use more swiss chard. I used fettucine since I wanted more substance. Great quick late night meal

Very easy & good. My husband loved it as he likes things on the sweet side. (Balsamic is his favorite vinegar.) And bacon! What can you say? It's a highlight-ingredient in many flavorful recipes. I love swiss chard! It stores great and it's good for you. Changes: added fresh ripe tomatoes, garlic, and hot pepper flakes. I used farfalle, (small bow-shaped pasta). This is a great basic recipe that can be tweaked easily.

This was really good. I'll make it again. Next time I'll use some of reviewers ideas.

Got some swiss chard from our CSA and threw it out before because we didn't know what to do with it. Found this recipe and it is awesome! The bacon and cheese hides the true flavor of chard but we still get the health benefits. No substitutions but many of the ones mentioned sound awesome. Would definitely make it again!

Simple ingredients and cooking instructions. The results were terrific! I used half the pasta (8 oz) because I wanted lots of the chard-onion-bacon sauce.

Rating: 4
Terrific. I used a mix of Swiss chard, beet greens and lettuce because that's what I had in my garden. Used 1 1/2 cups Parmesan and decreased olive oil to 1 TBSP. If not using super-fresh greens, I will add garlic as suggested by many here, but with really wonderful greens, it's nice to let their flavor come through unmasked by garlic.

I substituted smoked pork tenderloin for the bacon with great results. Too simple to be this good.

Fine recipe to use the rainbow chard in the CSA basket this week. I chopped the stalks and added at the same time as the shallot (my substitute for red onion) to make add color to the dish, and as others, I added some garlic for additional flavor and let it cook in the minute before adding the chard leaves. Delicious.

Rating: 4
Excellent. I used ingredients on hand and served over basmati rice instead of pasta. Forget the onion and parm cheese, use plenty of garlic! Sprinkle the finished dish with large chunks feta cheese. With the combination of smoky bacon and tangy fresh feta, no other seasoning was necessary, not even S & P. Very good quality balsamic vinegar is a must. (mine was brought back from Italy) Be sure to include the red stalks of chard cut into small pieces. . . . A nice change from all the pasta and vegetable dishes.

I made this as a quick dinner option, and I like to sneak greens in for the hubby whenever I can. I made a few adjustments though...I chopped the onion into large pieces and removed half before I added the other ingredients because I am not a big onion fan. To compensate I used three cloves of chopped garlic to kick up the spice. I also used pepper crusted bacon, which also added some extra kick. All in all a good standby for a quick dinner!

Excellent... the boyfriend HATES vegetables, especially new ones, and he loved this. I used a large shallot in place of the onion, and followed everything else to a T. Will definitely make again!

I replaced the red onion with lots of garlic (6-7 cloves - I am kind of a garlic nut) and I ditched the balsamic vinegar. I used whole wheat pasta and threw in chunks of feta along with halved uncooked cherry tomatoes, which cook just enough when added to the hot pasta. Also gave it some kick with red pepper flakes. Delicious!

We added a bit more balsamic and liked it better. We also squeezed a lemon over the top after serving and it gave it a bit more added depth.

Made a few substitutions, so I didn't have to go shopping :) Used brown rice rotini pasta, proscuitto, and shredded asiago cheese. Had baby swiss chard, so short cook time was fine. Loved the depth of flavor, even with such a short cooking time. Also, added a can of cannellini beans to increase the protein. What an awesome, fast lunch!

This is my go to recipe when I have any kind of greens, which I get often from my CSA. My husband loves this dish and I basically always follow the recipe, except sometimes I substitute leeks or shallots for the onions if that's what I have on hand. I also like to add chili flakes, or fresh peppers if I have them, and garlic. I'm celiac and use gluten free spaghetti but it still turns out great!

Very easy and delicious. I used whole wheat penne and added garlic as well as crushed red pepper. Will definitely make again. Yum

I also added garlic, and subbed pancetta for the bacon. We are trying to eat more whole grains, so I used whole wheat penne. I also had a handful of grape tomatoes which I tossed in at the end. Served with roasted parsnips.

I added one fat chopped clove of garlic after sauteing the onions for a few minutes. Also, put in a bit more balsamic vinegar. Delicious!

This was a yummy easy recipe. I used spinach linguine and substituted fresh spinach instead of chard. I also sprinkled feta instead of Parmesan at the end and added some chopped heirloom tomatoes on top of the pasta. The presentation of the red and yellow tomatoes, green pasta and white feta was rather pretty, though next time I'll use more spinach and bacon for the amount of pasta I made.

I went looking for a fast recipe to use all the Swiss Chard that was picked from the garden today and decided on this one because I already had all the ingredients.This dish was so delicious and lovely with the splash of Balsamic! Perfect and will definately be made again!

I made this for my family last night and they all raved about the dish. They thought that none of the flavors outweighed each other and it created a solid combination. We used Swiss Chard straight from the garden and I used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic. I'm looking forward to eating the leftovers for lunch today!

We've made this recipe three or four times. I think it's delicious. Make sure to use fresh swiss chard, and I usually use a little less pasta than the recipe calls for so as to enjoy the greens.

This was a hit, but needed a bit of fire. Had to add some red pepper flakes. I don't eat bacon, but my family loved this. I added spicy prawns to my own dish and it was great. Used fresh greens from the Farmer's Market.

This dish is simple and quick, perfect for a weekday meal. I follow the recipe closely, though I'm big on veggies so I tend to use less pasta and bacon but more onion and the stems of the chard, too. I wonder if reviewers who find the flavor bland are perhaps cutting corners with cheap Parmesan or sub-par balsamic? (I'm not at all a food snob, but the difference is quite noticeable, esp. when those flavors make up such a big part of the dish.)

This is a simple weekday meal, not a fancy meal I would serve to guests. It took me less than 1/2 hour to make. I only had turkey bacon so I used that, and since there isn't a lot of fat, I added some olive oil. Ham would probably work well too. Also I used rotilli pasta which held the flavors better than spaghetti or linguini would. I chopped the bacon first and then cooked it a while, then added the onion and then the chard all in the same pot at the same time so the flavors blended pretty nicely. I didn't add the extra olive oil at the end, seemed unnecessary. Also, for variety, you could substitute smoked gouda for the parmesan and add fresh, chopped tomatoes at the end.

This is a good basic recipe - as is needed just a little help - but it is basically a solid combo of flavors. Feel free to kick up either the vegetable or meaty flavors to your taste. You could substitute italian sausage instead of the bacon and make it a little more substantial (take it out of the casing, crumble, and fry it a it gets a little crisp). Salt and pepper to finish it off should take care of any reports of it being bland - add to the swiss chard when cooking that down. finish with cracked pepper on top. saw it in the magazine and have made it several times.

The flavor was okay when it was fresh, not great. The chard does not hold up for leftovers, so I wouldn't plan on that.

I substituted bacon with hot Italian sausage, added some salty black olives (chopped) and red pepper flakes. Very nice fall/winter dish.

Try "Fusilli with Collards, Bacon and Garlic" on this site. You can substitute Swiss Chard. Read the reviews. I thought this "Bacon and Swiss Chard Pasta" recipe was one I had previously made, but reading the reviews, I realized that it wasn't and was happy to find the "Fusilli with Collards, Bacon and Garlic" again.

I like all of the ingredients in this dish and I will admit I didn't follow the recipe exactly I added granulated garlic and onion but I think next time I make it I will probably add more veggies. We normally eat healthy food with a lot of flavor. I just didn't find the flavor I was looking for. I would say it is worth a try, it isn't terrible.

Rating: 3
Very nice. I made it just as instructed and it looked just like the picture. I thought the linguine worked better than the penne I would have used. Make sure to add enough salt when you adjust it at the end. Some red pepper flakes might be nice too. Otherwise, a keeper.

Next time, I'll toss some of the Parmesan with the pasta, since it makes a very strong first impression when it's so thick on the top. The combination is very good after you get below that.

I thought this was pretty good. I was using rainbow chard from the fram share so I through in some of the beautfiul stems, chopped. I also added a small shallot and a few few cloves of garlic. Also, more Parmiggiano.

There are recipes you makes where the subtlety of flavor is exciting, understated and enjoyable. This isn't one of those recipes. It's just plain bland. I agree with other reviewers that it needs a zip. . .of something. Personally, a squeeze of lemon, adequate salt, some capers and some thyme did the trick. As written it's blah

Wonderful! My husband and I both loved this dish. We used whole wheat linguine and around 4 tablespoons of balsamic instead of just the 1. We give it 3 forks because it takes a bit long for a quick weeknight meal.

This was perfectly adequate for a quick meal. I used savoy cabbage rather than the chard b/c of family preference so I sauteed cabbage with the onions. Onions were lovely and sweet, but I forgot to add the pasta liquid, oops!It was all good, and everyone cleaned their plates.

This was even better than I expected. I made it with varigated gastronomiche (little rolled pastas) and spinach, because I had no chard on hand. I used garlic infused extra- virgin olive oil and sweet yellow onion. My bacon was uncured and I baked and chopped it ahead of time. This would be flattered by a bed of arugula. Delicious!

Rating: 4
This is quite easy and has surprisingly complex flavors, but I suspect the quality of the bacon and chard is important (I used Niman Ranch bacon and rainbow chard). We served it over Trader Joe's whole wheat pasta. An earthy pinot noir with good fruit flavors was a great complement to the pasta.

Excellent for an easy weeknight meal.
