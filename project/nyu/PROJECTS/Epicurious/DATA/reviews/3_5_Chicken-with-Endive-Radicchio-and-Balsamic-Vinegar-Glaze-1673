Dinner was delicious! My husband, 14 month old and 5 year old loved it ~ definitely a keeper recipe. I did make some revisions to the recipe, instead of radicchio, I used spinach and I only used 1 large endive and it turned out that it was plenty. To top it off I used some pinenuts that I had in the freezer for some extra crunch ~ definitely a great bonus. Everything else I followed to a tee ~ a great meal that even kiddos will eat and a great presentation for guests.

We love this recipe. It's not only simple and tasty. It presents itself nicely. I love using Radicchio and Chicory or Endive.

I've made this a few times, and it's always delicious, just as written.

One of my favorites, especially in Fall. Very easy to make and always delicious. As for presentation, well.... It's a tad monochromatic, which is fine if you like earthtones.

Have made this several times and each time it was wonderful - some work but well worth it. Even my teenage kids loved it and the presentation was wonderful. Too bad the readers don't agree.

This dish was okay. I could not find radicchio, so I substituted brocolli rabe. They were too greasy tasting with the sauce. I had left over chicken and used it the next night in a grilled chicken salad and the chicken flavors were great.
