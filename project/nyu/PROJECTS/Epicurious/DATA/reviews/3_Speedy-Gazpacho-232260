While it may not be quite authentic it certainly is tasty. I bought a hot salsa which, after chilling made it a little too hot so I would recommend mild and then spice it up to your personal taste. In addition, I would recommend adding a little garlic, some olive oil and a little parm to make it taste just a little closer to its Spanish heritage. All in, all, I'll say I went to spain in July and still couldn't wait to make Gazpacho when I got home!

Liquified salsa. That's what this tastes like. If you are a fan of tex-mex this is probably the recipe for you, but not if you are looking for an authentic spanish taste.

After a mad race to get a kitchen remodel finished the day before guests arrived, this 'speedy' recipe was just what the doctor ordered. Our friends from the Netherlands (who also holiday in Spain each year) loved the 'fire-roasted' aspect of this dish. True, it may not be the "authentic" version of gazpacho, but it was a big hit as the "New Mexico" version. I jazzed it up a bit by mixing the tomato juice half and half with spicy V-8 juice (a cup of each), so I guess I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Hope that doesn't mean I'm not qualified to rate it.

I gave it an honest chance. It was good, and if you have to have Gazpacho 3 times a week, then go ahead and pull out the jars and cans this recipe calls for. However, if you are like me, and see a nice gazpacho as a once in awhile summer treat - I say go ahead, invest a little more time, and have the real thing. I'm all for time saving steps, short cut and tricks in cooking, but the above recipe is a bit like making pesto from dried herbs - sure, you can do it, but why would you?

This is a great recipe. The flavor is outstanding for the amount of time and number of ingredients used. I served it garnished with shrimp bits and chopped avocado; it is a perfect summer side dish.

For all those who knocked this recipe let me remind you the title is "Speedy Gazpacho". For speedy I think it is darn good.

This recipe has provoked so many different responses! It is wonderful to see American ingenuity at play when given a recipe. I will try this recipe and give it my own twist: some good extra virgin olive oil such as 1888, garlic, and vinegar. Keep up the good work providing a forum for creative cooking.

Cheating, way cheating. This recipe is no better than adding some cut fresh veggies to spaghetti sauce. Quit cutting corners!! The real thing is not but 10 minutes more time!

This is an delicious recipe. Our heat index has been in the 110 range and this soup is very refreshing. As for me, to have something this easy and tasty, I was in heaven. My family loved it.

I loved it fresh for dinner with just some lovely crusty bread (no butter needed). I take soup every day for lunch as well and wonder if I could freeze it in portions and just defrost and eat. Anyone have any ideas?

I agree that is a good recipe though I have to say I like the real Gazpacho recipe much better. What I don't understand is, real gazpacho doesn't take long to make, and it's all fresh veggies...I've been doing it since I was 13 or 14 years old, 3 times a week during the summer, and it's just so easy and fast! 1 green pepper, 1 red pepper, 1 cucumber, 1/2 or 1 onion, 1 garlic clove, 6-7 ripe tomatoes. Wash, peel cucumber, cut all in big pieces add in blender with 2 or 3 cups of water, depending on thickness desired, add salt, pepper (or tabasco), extra virgin olive oil and sherry vinegar to taste (sometimes I add basil too). Some people add bread in it but I think it's healthier without it... enjoy!! (you can serve it with croutons)Serve it really cold. By the way, I am from Spain :)

Fresh and easy. Like the real gazpacho better, but this one's ok and will probably make it again.

True. This is not an "authentic" gazpacho- but the recipe never claimed to be true Spanish gazpacho. I agree with NH- I also feed people for 10-12 hours a day. We need to eat too! It's been pretty hot and humid here for the last few days, and some cold, nourishing soup has been a very nice respite. I don't care about it's pedigree. Eat what you like. Ignore what you don't like. And be happy.

I'm wondering if the reviewers saying this isn't real gazpacho have actually made it. It tastes as good or better than the authentic recipes using fresh tomoatoes. It's our favorite yet.

Thank you, "A Cook from New Haven, CT" for some common sense comments! I cook for a living, and having something that's fast and easy to prepare for dinner on a hot summer night is wonderful! This is a fun dish to prepare as well as eat...particularly after you've been on your feet for 9-10 hours feeding others! I love to cook and lean toward the slow cooking movement, but sometimes it just isn't possible. Focus on flavor and lighten up a bit. Throw a dollop of sour cream on this and serve with a crusty bread. What could be simpler or more refreshing on a hot, muggy night?

Gazpacho ???? sorry, but this is a can soup. Real `spanish gazpacho is made with natural red tomatoes, red or green pepper, cucumber, garlic, olive oil, sherry vinegar and salt, and must be served very cold. Please try the recipe with this ingredients....

I added avacado bits along with prawns to this and it made a good first course for a summer meal. Its easy and quick!

Okay, I have to put my two cents in. To the gourmet purists out there who feel compelled to make negative comments on a recipe based on the fact that it's easy to make and uses prepared foods I say DON'T KNOCK IT TILL YOU TRY IT please. The people who actually tried this recipe all appear to like it quite a lot. You might notice this recipe comes from the "every night cooking" section of the magazine. I think everyone who reads this magazine (and website) appreciate good food. Not everyone (including me) have hours to prepare it all the time, so it can be nice to have healthy, delicious recipes that are quick and easy. Comment on the authenticity of the recipe if you like -- not all of us care if real Spaniards would use cilantro -- but for those of you who do, that's fine too -- you can omit it. Now I think I'LL go try this recipe soon, and let you know how it actually TASTES.

Gazpacho??? I think not... Salsa Soup. It looks like it came from a Cambells grocery store recipe can label, not a gourmet magazine. True Spanish cuisine would not have cilantro... and where are the fresh ripe tomatoes? The V8 works well, I have to agree.

I agree that this isn't gazpacho. Gazpacho is supposed to be fresh -tasting and I fail to see how you can achieve that with fire-roasted this and that. I've made a similar cold soup using cucumbers, tomatoes, V8, green peppers, Vidalias, and red wine (not vinegar) for years. The "marrying" period is essential, whatever you put in. The cilantro was the final insult.

If you add some melted jack cheese sauce and arrange some nachos on top i bet it'll be dee-li-cious! c'mon people, this isn't gazpacho

I have already made this recipe twice adding a freash jalepino the second time. My husband liked it just as well as the gazpacho I have been making for years rom peeled fresh tomatoes

Easy, and delicious. My company loved it and could not believe it was such a snap to make.

This was simply delightful!! Very simple and it rivaled our homemade recipe! I used 1 Can of Cambell's tomato juice and 2/3 of a can of Spicy V8 for the rest...if your salsa isnt too spicy, this adds a nice touch of spice...it was excellent, and I will definitely make it again!

Smooth texture, very tasty because of the cilantro and fresh store-purchased salsa. Not quite Barcelona or Madrid style, but quick and very easy to assemble. Freezes well, also.
