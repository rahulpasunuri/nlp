I would have given it a 3.5 if possible. This recipe was good and simple. I was in a bit of a time crunch so I made the custard and placed the individual cups in a deep pan with ice cubes in the refrigerator to cool it quickly. After about 2 hours I sprinkled the sugar on top, used the broiler method to caramelize the sugar (I don't own a torch, yet), and after about 2 minutes removed the cups and returned them to the ice bath. I was able to have the creme brulee ready to go in 3.5 hours. Really a delight!

This is a nice idea, but the recipe needed tweaking. It was TOO "eggy" and not "gingery" enough for me. In round 2, I used 4 cups of cream and 9 yolks, and added another 1/2 amount of ginger. Also (evryone's oven cooks differently), I decreased the cooking time by about 8-10 minutes. This one was silky and fragrant....YUM!

This is tasty, but I found it too sweet and too eggy. I like the addition of the ginger. If I were to make this again, I would stick to a more traditional creme brulee base recipe and infuse it with ginger.

This was a delight. Simple to make and oh-so-silky. Do try this and you will dazzle someone.

Took previous reviews advice and used more ginger. Also added candied ginger on top, just before serving. So easy to make and such an elegant dessert.

This was very mediocre. Ginger flavor is far too subtle and did not like the consistency.

Absolutely fantastic! I am a creme bruleeaholic and this is one of my new favorites. Made as written only mine took almost 2 hours to cook. My torch kept going out. Does that happen to anyone else?

I made this recipe for the first time for Easter dinner. It turned out wonderfully! I would definitely recommend using only 3/4 cup sugar for the recipe, because I went part way between that and 1 cup, and it was a tad too sweet. I put the ramekins in the broiler to caramelize the sugar, and it ended up with an uneven layer of small spots of unmelted sugar and other spots of almost burned sugar. It still tasted great. A torch is definitely a must. Also, I am at an elevation above 5,000 feet, so this recipe took a lot longer to cook, as expected.

Could this have possibly been any easier or more delicious?? I have never made creme brulee before, and I am stunned at how simple it was. I thought that with such ease of preparation, it could not possibly turn out correctly, but the end result was a creamy, delectable phenomenon that is worthy of more than four stars. For the sugar topping, I used some vanilla sugar (sugar that has been stored with a vanilla bean), and it smelled like cotton candy when it was "burning." Unbelievable.Following the suggestion of another reviewer, I let everyone at my dinner party torch his or her own creme brulee. We marked each one and refrigerated them for thirty minutes or so... We all had fun doing it, and the dessert made an already fabulous meal go out with a bang.

I don't think I've ever given a 4 before (how can something be "beyond compare"?), but here it is. I made exactly as written. I think the dishes I used were too deep (borrowed them), as it took much longer to bake, but it was incredible. Creme brulee is my favorite, yet I'd never made it before. I will certainly make it again, and this will see our table frequently. Wonderful flavor, texture, everything.

This dessert was delicious and all of my friends, including those who don't like ginger, agree. After the first time, I lessened the sugar a little because it was a little too sweet for my tastes.

I have made this sinful dessert numerous times and it has never failed me. I can not believe how simple it is. I think that browning the sugar crust with a torch is a must. I found the custard too sweet so reduced the sugar to 3/4 of a cup and it was perfect. I have browned the sugar and served immediately with perfect results.

This was my first time making cream brulee at home. I thought the flavor was wonderful. I sprinkled a few raspberries into the ramakins before pouring in the custard and thought that the combinations went really well together. I too used the broiler to carmelize the sugar tops, and I think I had the sugar sprinkled on too heavily. Next time I would lightly sugar the tops for the carmelization, and make it a little darker. These were wonderful!!!

This was a super dessert. It is very easy, and only a little time consuming. The only hard part is browning the sugar on top. I used the broiler and it turned out okay. Next time I'll use the torch.

Our wine tasting group loved this subtle and elegant dessert. I also added a vanilla bean, split and scraped as described in the ginger-and-vanilla-bean recipe elsewhere on this site. We had each guest use the blowtorch on his or her own ramekin (I serve creme brulee right after torching, not chilling the carmelized sugar) - it's amusing how people display their personalities when they have flames in their hands!

My friend, Cindy, made this for my birthday dinner party at her home! What a friend! It was delicious and I had to find out where she got the recipe. She was all too ready to tell me "Epicurious!"

An absolutely delicious creme brulee! A friend made it for us as a "gift" and my husband and I raved about it. It is a recipe that will on in my special menus file!
