Excellent! This recipe was delicious, I used ground cinnamon (the cinnamon sticks here are tasteless) and sauteed half an onion before adding the chick peas. I also added 2 tsp black mustard seeds. Will definitely make this again.

Excellente ! The smell reminded me of natural foods stores. I would have had better results if I had remembered that olive oil does not like to be cooked at high temps. My wife really liked it, and she does not suffer my occasional bad results well. I used fresh squeezed orange juice, and ground spices. I overdid the cinnamon; it would have done better with less. A good recipe.

This was good when I made it according to instructions. But the second time I used ground spices and it was much better! Heated ground cinnamon in the oil and fried the chick peas for several minutes, then added ground coriander, lemon juice, salt, pepper and a little more oil right into the skillet. Didn't actually measure anything, just keep tasting!

Great recipe, ease and fast. Sauteing (spelling?) the chick peas in the flavored olive oil absolutely transforms them. The outside gets crispy and the inside gets soft, delectable. They even taste a little bit like "tater tots." I had no luck with the cinnamon sticks heated in the olive oil, next time I will just thrown in some freshly ground cinnamon. Similarly, I didn't think the cilantro added much. Next time I think I will add a touch of freshly ground cilantro seeds. I ended up using freshly squeezed orange juice instead of fresh lemon juice because that was all that I had, it was terrific. So I would recommend using ground spices, cinnamon and cilantro seeds, plus a spritz of freshly squeezed orange juice. Amazing results. I would serve as a snack at a party or as a side dish. Will definitely make this again. so easy.

I've made this one over and over again for years. Makes a great summer lunch or side dish. Fresh cilantro and lots of lemon...mmm...

Liked this recipe--really easy to make and tastes delicious. We used it as a side with squash fritters and they complemented well. It's listed as a main course but I wouldn't use it as one. And we didn't even use fresh coriander, but it was still delish!
