I made this, substituting macadamias for the hazelnuts and tarragon for the thyme, as it's what I had on hand. Very tasty, and different from the usual curried turkey salad that I make.

Fantastic recipe. I've made this many times. I also do several variations. My favorite variation is to use pasta in place of the salad mix. About a pound of cooked penne or shell pasta works best but almost any will do. I also increase the amount of the manonnaise. For a bit more zest, use a salad dressing such as "Miracle Whip". I've had many complements on this recipe. If you use pasta it makes it very usable for picnics where lettuce would wilt. I've also used almonds as well as pecans. I think most nuts would work great. I've also added a couple oz of toasted pine nuts. Yummmmy!!

I've made this a few times since it first appeared. Ham did not work as a very good subsitute one time. Smoked turkey or chicken is best. Hazelnuts are slightly sweet and I think that pecans may be the best substitute even though, I have also subbed with almonds before. I agree that the dressing is generous, and only add what lightly covers the lettuce. Dried cherries sounds tempting as suggested for a good sub when fresh cherries are awful. This becomes a fresh tasting, pleasant salad.

This salad is absolutely delicious - I've actually had guests fight over who got to have the last portion. I made a few changes the second time I made it: substituted macadamia nuts for hazelnuts (YUM), and used dried cherries instead of fresh (pitting is too tedious) - about half as many will do, because they're more intense. I also cut the dressing for the greens in half.

I made this recipe for a group of 200 ladies. I left out the salad part of the recipe and used the filling to make tea sandwiches. It was very good, and I will make it again.

I was surprised that the low fat mayo worked so well! I substituted toasted sliced almonds for the hazelnuts and served it over romaine. A definate keeper. The guy who thought it tasted like dessert must have used canned cherries or did something wrong. It was ok on bread but works better on greens.

A wonderfully delicious salad! I forgoed the baby green part altogether and took the advice of another cook and added pine nuts and toasted almonds in leu of hazelnuts - very yummy! I only used about half of the mayo it called for - that was plenty. And it pays to get a good quality turkey as well.

I agree with the first two reviewers--I think this dish is terrific, and so did my foodie friends. You do need a taste for sweet and savory together, I guess. Will definitely make it again, especially if I can convince someone else to pit the cherries! (Having that little tool to do it is some help, but not enough.)

I should have thought this one through before I decided to make it. Basically, turkey, celery, and onion with dessert mixed in. Very plain and uninteresting. Exactly how it sounds.

My girlfriend and I made this recipe last night. I have to say it was one of the best salads I've ever had. We replaced the hazelnuts with pine nuts and toasted almonds, and added a small amout of Garganzola cheese on top. I would recommend it to anyone.

I AM A CATERER AND HAVE PREPARED THIS DELICIOUS DISH FOR 200 PEOPLE AT A FUNCTION I HAD LAST YEAR, I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY COMPLIMENTS THAT I RECIVED THAT EVENING, THE SMOKED TURKEY FLAVOR WITH THE CHERRIES, CELERY AND HAZELNUTS CREATE A FLAVOR THAT IS SIMPLY DELICIOUS, I DO MOST OF MY ENTERTAINING DURING THE SUMMER SEASON AND EVERYTHING I SERVE IS USUALLY ROOM TEMP OR COOL, I NEVER SERVE HOT FOOD, THIS ONE IS A WINNER
