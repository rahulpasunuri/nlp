I make it often. Cut way back on the sugar and butter in the crust. Otherwise follow the recipe. Delicious, refreshing and beautiful to look at. Great after a large and spicy meal.

Easy and light after a big meal. Only substitution was a tequila-lime sorbet for the lime, but it didn't make much difference in taste. The crust was super-tasty and I may try it again with a simple fruit and whipped cream filling.
