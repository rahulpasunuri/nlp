Instead of "prosciutto" I used bacon bits; instead of "store-bought alfredo sauce" I used a packet of Knorr alfredo sauce mix, lasagne noodles and a can of diced tomatoes, all of which I got from the local Food Bank! The fresh basil I grew on my patio, and the "Mixed Roasted Vegetables" was a can of green beans, strained (also from Food Bank), sliced button mushrooms, and some frozen broccoli I stir-fried with a little minced garlic. I don't cook, nor do I profess to know how to cook. I have to eat. I come here to get recipes, because they're free and I'm broke. Food is food, and reviews are meant for that - to review the recipe and offer viable adaptations to other cooking-type-wannabes. Times are tough, people, get over yourselves. This is a great recipe and can be adapted in a million ways. Decent chefs, even those from Milahhhhhn, rolling over in their cast-iron skillets, indeed have too much time on their hands to be making snobbish comments about this fantastic recipe! I love it!

Good! Yummy for sure. However, I did not have the little dishes for it, so I made it in a 9.5/13 pyrex dish so i had to modify it a bit. I wouldn't use canned tomatoes again. Even with the other flavors they still just tasted like canned tomatoes. The only thing I wonder about then is what to use for liquid for the noodles...

For a non-traditional Thanksgiving dinner, this delicious lasagna was our main course. Being three high schoolers, we didn't want to attempt a turkey. However, we did make some changes to this recipe. Firstly, saute half of the vegetables and roast the other half. This will add a bit of a crunch to the final product - a nice texture in comparision to the rest of the dish. We used carrots, onion, zuccini, peppers and mushrooms. Secondly, bake the lasagna at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes. Thirdly, use an alfredo sauce with cheese flavors (we recommend Trader Joe's) as there is no actual cheese in the recipe. After consumption, you'll feel noticably more healthy in comparison with regular cheese-laden lasagna. Lastly, we quadrupled the recipe in order to create this dish in one piece, rather than a seperate portion for each person. Lastly, we added another layer of noodle and diced tomatoes on top. Our guests (and parents) were truly impressed.

just glanced at the recipe for an idea, then made easy version with barilla marinara sauce, threw in cut up prosciutto, a little red wine, red pepper flakes to cut the sweetness of the jarred sauce, and a dollop of lowfat cream cheese that i mixed in to make it creamy. Mixed in the pasta and laid roasted zuchinni (with salt and pepper) over the top. Good, easy, quick.

This recipe was just fine. It is a nice alternative to a tomato sauce based lasagna. You do have to tweak it, and yes, a homemade alfredo is preferable, but not necessary. As for the previous negative "chefs" reviews, you are the kind of people that make those who don't cook think that they CAN'T cook-nice going! so glad that you are using your talents to help others.

Enjoyable recipe! Certainly a great base to begin from. I made this for the first time 3 years ago for dinner guests and they still mention that "alfredo lasagna" I made.

Excellent! I roasted the vegetables with olive oil & fresh thyme. Quick, easy & good presentation.

Epicurious offers only three recipes for "Alfredo Sauce," all from Bon Appetite, all saying to buy a prepared Alfredo Sauce. WHY? It's one of the easiest sauces to make fresh yourself.

I haven't had the opportunity to make this recipe yet. After reading the previous reviews I felt compelled to comment.This site is a guide for making great meals. Choose what elements of the recipe you want to include. Any great cook never follows a recipe verbatim unless it is a baked good. We put our own signature to the dish. Lighten up Lori from Milan and the rest of you gastro-snobs!

This recipe was wonderful, and it tasted great, and that's what really counts in the end. Also, because of the previous reviews I feel that I should mention that processed tomatoes are higher in lycopene(a cancer fighter)than fresh tomatoes.

I would encourage the cook from Michigan NOT to let reviewers who, quite obviously, have "no life" to discourage her from this website. They list some wonderful recipes and I certainly would not let someone with "no life" discourage me from viewing it. Quite obviously these people are extremely unhappy people within themselves and my guess is.....they complain about everything! Just consider the "source" and write it off to a VERY unhappy person and be grateful she's not your neighbor or a relative! WHOA!

Now I remember why I stopped visiting this website. If the biggest concern in your life is a lasagna recipe, consider yourself lucky. If you were invited to a dinner party where this dish was served, would speak to the host/hostess the way you speak to the other members of this website? Life is far too short to spend time with pretentious people whose most admirable quality is that they can make lasagna from scratch. I can, and do, make lasagna and most other meals from scratch, but I don't look down on anyone who chooses to use bottled sauces and convenience foods. I am happy to be in the company of those I care about regardless of the meal. I'll take good friends over home cooked food anyday!

Wow, all I was doing was looking for an interesting lasagna recipe and got caught up in the gossip column and the wrestling pit...so interesting were the "reviews" that I never got a chance to read the recipe!!!!Lori or Jeanne? You sure do know how to get people excited!!! Maybe not about recipes but....

Just so everyone knows-- this recipe came from a special on PRE-PACKAGED GOURMET!!! It was all about using the quickest, pre-prepared ingredients. For whatever offense has been taken by the cooking snobs who peruse this website, recognize that before you bemoan the plebeian quality of a recipe, you should seek out its purpose in being published. Personally, I would never cook it because it isn't healthy in any respect. Criticize that. Don't criticize Gourmet for offering some interesting suggestions to those who have no time to cook.

I havent made this recipe but felt compelled to write when I read the reviews. Meow guys-too judgemental. I work all day and have kids all night. I do not ever go to McDonalds and such so I appreciate a relatively healthy, quick recipe (although I too would make my own alfredo sauce while the noodles cook)I think using roasted veggies from Whole Foods... is a great idea.

Lighten up people! Take into consideration the source of the recipe: "30 Minute Meals." This means you cut corners -- buy some prepared food and incorporate it into an otherwise home cooked meal. This dish is fine for a quick meal, especialy when you have no idea what to cook and have the listed ingredients on hand. To the 'expert reviewers' on this site who tend to be a bit unforgiving -- open up a nice bottle of wine and stop trying so hard!

My firend Andy Krause told me about this review so I had to see it for myself. Hey Jeanne, did you try the recipe or do you just like to hear the sound of yourself typing on the computer. I knew Jean when she lived in the states and lets just say that our crew was more than happy when she married that old geezer and moved to Italy. Before she became a housewife, this girl ate nothing but frozen food or take out from McDonald's. Sorry to see that her stay in "the boot" hasn't softened her any...the recipe isn't any good, fresh or prepared, don't waste your time. Jeanns changed her name before she moved to Italy, she used to be Lori Kaplan. Read all the reviews people, this is like a little soap opera. Jeanne, do I have stories...

I have not used this recipe and will not because I have the luxury of time and choose to make from scratch but wanted to apologize to the Italians for Jeanne from Milan. Not all Americans make pre-packaged food and not all Americans are pretentious know-it-alls like Jeanne.

OK, all I have to say is that clearly people have lost their imagination! What ever happend to recipes being a guideline not a rule book. If you want to add fresh tomatoes then guess what? Add them!!! That is all I have to say about that.

I haven't tried this yet but that's immaterial. The individual in Milan who took offense at the use of canned tomatoes must have access to tasty, ripe tomatoes throughout the year. Many of us living in colder parts of the globe are not so lucky. Canned tomatoes have always been considered a better alternative with which to achieve flavorful results than to use mushy, flavorless, pink tomatoes found during the winter. When I say always, I mean to cooks,such as Marcella Hazan, Julia della Croce, and the late Peter Kump, from whose cooking school in N.Y. I graduated.

As for me I though this recipe was easy enough for a full time college student working two jobs. Which is exactly what I am! I don't have time to sit around and wait for lasagna to cook and since the recipe is relatively simple there is no way in hell i could screw it up! Thankyou and don't listen to pretentious know it alls! Keep posting easy, simple and inexpensive recipies for us poor college kids!

When I want a mediocre, uninspiring packaged recipe like this, I look to Woman's World Magazine, or it's mediocre equivalents. This site is normally very good and I recommend it often as I find it challenging and a source of good taste,neither of which can be found in a package. This has been an inspirational site, please keep it that way. No thanks to this recipe.

This recipe reflects an American lifestyle...prepackaged and premixed items, microwave oven, no-cook lasagna, etc. A former New Yorker now living in Milan, I have always been interested in healthy recipes and fresh, natural ingredients. In Italy, we are very lucky to be able to find these items easily at local markets. My suggestion to American cooks is that they first go into the store and inspect carefully the food that is offered. Search for the freshest, seasonal foods and then plan your menu around that. (Think globally but cook locally!) I know, however, that this kind of time spent on cooking and shopping seems absurd to the American lifestyle but think of the benefits to your health! Why not come for a visit and see for yourself how dishes can be seasonal, healthy, and delicious at the same time. Look into the SLOW FOOD MOVEMENT!

I can't believe that people can get so worked up over a recipe. I know Lori and she really is from Milan. And I agree with her.

Okay, big deal: i made my own alfredo sauce. Doesn't take much talent or know how to do that... and the recipe was magnificent, everyone asked for seconds and no one could believe it was so easy.... To the two rather pretentious characters who were "offended" etc: WE ARE NOT IMPRESSED (Milan? i doubt it... lol)

As soon as I saw: purchased Alfredo Sauce I was immediately repulsed by this recipe and wouldn't bother with it AT ALL! I look to this website for authentic, homemade, GOOD food without that kind of short cut. Thanks, but no thanks.

I loved this recipe, however I couldn't find the canned alfredo sauce so I diced six ounces of pancetta and sautee'd it adding diced shallots and added a cup of heavy cream reduced it about a third and squeezed about a half-stick butter, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and a grating of nutmeg finished with a whipped egg yolk and large handful of parmesian cheese. I was too cheap to buy the roasted vegies store prepared so I did them myself on the barbeque over mesquite

I felt that this was a reasonably good recipe, despite the shortcuts. Rather than buy already roasted vegetables, I made my own.

As opposed to earlier reviewers, I was fairly impressed that a decent lasagna could be prepared that quickly. The combination of ingredients (and I should point out that I have an excellent deli here)seemed to counter some of the inevitable shortfalls of purchased goods. As to comments on canned tomatoes, deli vegies, and no boil noodles... Lets just say that some of us dont live in Italy and dont have access to fresh tomatoes and vegies. Last I checked, even when I make my own noodles, I still dont boil them for lasagne. About the only variation I would reccomend is making your own Alfredo Sauce. It does not add significantly to the time factor (about 3-4 min?) and it can really act as the primary flavor of this dish. Not too bad.

I am offended by this recipe. I am all for quick dinners but PURCHASED sauce, CANNED tomatoes, NO BOIL noodles, and DELI vegetables! C'mon!!!!! I would think that Bon Appetit could think up something better and fresher. I cannot believe that this recipe could be any good.
