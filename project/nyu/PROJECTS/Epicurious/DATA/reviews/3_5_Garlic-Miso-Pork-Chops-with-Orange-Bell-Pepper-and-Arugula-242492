A possible work-around for the burning miso is: spread the garlic and miso on one side of the chop. Brown the chop on the unslathered side, medium heat, about 5 minutes. Broil the chop until done, 5-10 minutes depending on the thickness of your chop and the miso is browned. The arugula-orange pepper salad is fine, but I didn't really what is added to the dish besides color. But my arugula was not as peppery as it will be in the spring and summer.

I skipped the bell pepper / arugula salad (the wife handles the salads) but this was quite good regardless. Like others, I also suggest one clove of pressed garlic per side of chop. I tried the oven trick, and about half of the miso still burned. However, when the skillet came out of the oven (10 minutes at 400), I used more of the [cheap] marsala I substituted for the dry sherry to gently (so as not to dislodge the really burned bits) to deglaze the pan. After passing through a sieve, made a perfect finishing sauce.

Garlic and miso are great flavors for pork chops. I would do what everyone else is doing--a few minutes on med/high heat for each side, then into the oven for 10 minutes or so w/ a little water or stock in the pan--maybe with a flip at the end while it rests to caramelize the other side. Miso tastes great browned, so don't worry if it gets a little burnt-looking. Instead of sherry, used mirin. And served over rice w/ fresh scallions and some kimchi instead of the salad. Very very good and easy.

We loved this recipe! Followed the advice of a prior reviewer and seared the chops (miso side up), and then threw them in the oven (400) with some chicken broth in the bottom of the pan until done. Terrific flavor. Only criticism was that it was a touch salty ...

This recipe was very good. But as far as the preparation. I tried cooking the porkchops on low heat, but the miso started to burn. So the rest of the batch I just seared in the pan and then put the porkchops in a baking pan with some broth ( to keep more moisture in) and a few rosemary springs. Then I baked at 350 till they were done. Everyone loved it. I would make this again.I changed this recipe a little. I didnt use the peppers or the sherry.

This was a delicious recipe, despite my changing a few items. I used brown rice miso, 5 cloves of garlic and used a cut of pork which had a few lines of fat through the meat (pork loin?). I followed the advice of prior reviewers and cooked the chops on low heat, 12 minutes on each side and covered the pan to retain moisture. I had no problem at all with burning and the chops tasted delicious and my guests absolutely loved them. The salad was also divine, and I added sesame seeds, a few pine nuts and a dash of sesame oil, which complemented the chops well. I also served roasted sweet potates and the whole meal was a hit! I reheated the left over chops and sweet potatoes the next day in the oven and it tasted even better then. I would definitely make this again!

I just made this and it is delicious! I followed the advice of previous reviewers and cooked the pork chops on low-medium heat for about 12 minutes per side. The miso did not burn and the pork chop was perfectly tender.

I just made this and all that miso paste totally burned in the pan. I made these on my iron skillet. I had to take all the pork chops off before they were fully cooked, scrape all the miso off them, wash my pan, and then put them back in the pan to cook them the rest of the way. I haven't tried them yet (still cooking) but for that hassle I wouldn't make them again!!!!

Great combination of flavors, very simple preparation. However, you need to monitor it constantly to avoid burning the miso. The miso I used did not adhere to the pork itself so that in some instances it slide right off and began to burn in the pan. I would recommend going with a low temperature - definitely going to give it another go.

Made this for dinner tonight, and loved it!! Because I was cooking for a crowd, I didn't stick to exact measurements. Was a little scared of the Miso burning, but It didn't!! Woohoo for Me!!

It was easy and quick to make and, as an added bonus, it got rave reviews from the husband. Looking at the other reviews about the miso paste burning, I used only 1 heaped tablespoon of the miso paste and only cooked it at the low end of medium-high heat. The finished product looked just like the picture.

I thought this recipe was amazing. The miso did get black (and I had to cook the chops longer than stated) but they didn't taste burnt at all. I added goat cheese to the salad and made roasted sweet potatoes as a side and got rave reviews from all! I will definitely make this again.

After reading the reviews about the miso burning in the pan. I threw them on the grill and they were great! The miso did not burn.

I thought I'd rate this one fork as, yes, the miso burnt right away, and after the 10 minutes suggested cooking time the chops were still rare. But, I just cooked them ten more minutes and everyone loved the flavors and even the burnt miso. My son especially loved the burnt miso and said they were the best chops he's had. The chops were moist, the flavors overall were very good and the arugula bell pepper salad was attractive (I used umeboshi vinegar). It was also very quick and easy to make. I had to use way more garlic than the recipe called for - one clove for each pork chop side. So the meal itself was a hit -- but it sure didn't look like it on the way there.

Someone was asleep at the wheel when they wrote this recipe, because these pork chops were an absolute mess, and by the time I scraped the burnt miso crust off the chops the total time spent on this dish was closer to an hour. After only 4 minutes the first cooked side miso crust was completely black. Flipped the chops hoping to salvage the second side. That sides crust was completely stuck to the pan after 90 seconds. Then I scraped all the black miso off the chops, re-spread the miso onto the chops, loaded up the pan with butter, re-cooked the chops about 90 seconds per side to get some semblance of what the miso crust should look like and then put them in a 450 degree oven for 10 more minutes to finish cooking. What an ordeal. I will say that the flavor was very good, so this recipe probably deserves to be re-visited at some point, but theres no way Id cook it according to their instructions. http://www.abadeeba.com/Site/Yummo/Entries/2008/5/15_Garlic_Miso_Pork_Chops_w_Pepper_%26_Arugula.html

Flavors were good, but you simply cannot follow the instructions in this recipe. After only a few minutes the miso was burnt black. You need a lot more oil or butter in the pan than instructed. You're better off using doubling the oil in the pan, keep the heat at medium, sear for only 2 minutes each side (careful it doesn't burn) and throw it in a 450 oven to finish cooking, about 15 to 20 minutes. Good luck.
