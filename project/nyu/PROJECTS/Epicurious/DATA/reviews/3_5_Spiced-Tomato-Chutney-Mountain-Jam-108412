This came out great and was a hit! After reading the reviews I doubled the recipe and there was plenty of left overs. I used this for a dipping sauce for naan bread and topping for basmati rice - delicious. Also, I used the left overs on top crackers and cream cheese (like someone suggested). For a smoother texture, I blended the tomatoes (so it wasn't so chunky).

I had such high hopes for this after reading the rave reviews. This is absolutely terrible. The amount of acid in this makes it totally inedible. Disgusting.

If you plan on making this dish I would suggest using canned tomatoes rather than fresh ones. There are so many other flavors the flavor of an excellent fresh tomato is lost. I don't like this recipe for scrambled eggs, however it is really delicious on sandwhiches or with roast pork or chicken.

Great . Either fresh or canned tomatoes will work well. I was a bit disappointed about the amount, considering the cooking time.Next time I will make a double batch. I put what I made in sterilizied jars and I'm sure that it will keep for a few months at least,considering the amount of sugar and vinegar.I used frozen tomatoes from my garden and this worked perfectly, but I would not freeze the end result.

Made it and it's great! Used it on crackers spread with cream cheese then the chutney. Big hit! Still wondering how freezing will work?

Wonderful! With the first batch, all but about a tablespoon was gone before the week long waiting period was up. Batch number two was a double recipe, of which also only a little bit remained by the end of the week. That having been said, it DOES get even better if you can hold your horsies.

This far surpassed my expectations. I used my home-grown tomatoes, but it should be excellent with canned tomatoes, as well. I doubt it will last in the refrigerator one week. We keep taking little tastes.
