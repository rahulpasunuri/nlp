This salad is quite bland. I made it last nite and am still doctoring it. 60 seconds is not NEARLY long enough to cook the squid, mine was raw inside and I cooked it even longer, until the water came back to boil. I actually picked out the rings and re-fried them this morning & I added a fistful of basil and some oregano, more salt and pepper, still bland.

Great recipe, which sparkled with a few tweaks, mainly doubling the garlic and adding a tsp or more of red pepper flakes. i also sliced the olives and grape tomatoes in half and made sure to let the whole thing marinate for 8 hours, which allowed all the flavors and juices to mingle wonderfully. I doubled the recipe, with equal amounts of squid and cooked cocktail shrimp. It was a big bit at a potluck and every last morsel was consumed!

I thought this was good, but not great. I was really hoping the flavor would sparkle, given the citrus and onion, but it didn't quite get there. A big difference for me however would be to grill the calamari, I LOVE a caramalized, grilled flavor and if that were part of this recipe I think this could have been exceptional.

Quite delightful! The important thing, of course, is that the squid is not overcooked. The olives are an especially delicious addition.

A favorite of mine, sooooo good and fun to change up with different sea food like shrimp.

Great recipe and easy to make. Just be careful not to overcook the squid. I doubled the amount of garlic and added some red pepper flakes to the dressing.

soooooo yummy!!! i made it for the 1st time last year for xmas eve and it was so easy and deeelish! i used a sweet vidalia onion instead of red onion and made extra dressing and reserved it, but only needed a little bit by the time it was served.

I love love love this and have added it to my list of staples. The first time I made it, I was like "OMG WOW OM NOM NOM". And it is indeed lovely to play around with. But you can go overboard - in my second (triple) batch I made the mistake of using tons of bell peppers. Bad idea! It got soggy and weak and six days later I'm giving up and starting over. Still adoring the original version though.

Outstanding! I added mussels which I steamed in vermouth and chilled overnight to the recipe, shrimp and bay scallops would work to. The fun of this recipe? It's great as is, or it can be tweeked to suit your mood! This is a keeper for sure.

Make sure and let this set at least 15 minutes or the calamari will not have been flavored by the dressing. I added garlic chili sauce to the dressing and included jicama and yellow peppers. It was very fresh and very easy.

Nice recipe. I think it could use another clove of garlic in addition to the red pepper flakes.

I have been looking for a tasty calamari salad for some time now and this one is a keeper. I added anchovy stuffed olives to the recipe and chopped pepperoncini peppers to give it extra zing. It was delicious! It is a perfect starter to any meal and great summer salad. My family loved it!

This stuff is out of this world...I followed the recipe verbatim, but added hot pepper flakes to make it even more interesting...what a treat!!!

I have made this many times. I've added shrimp and scallops which make it even better. Also, some bell peppers make a nice addition. I love it as a nice, light summer dinner.

A friend served this as a course for her traditional Italian feast on Christmas eve and I had to have the recipe. I followed the recipe except that I used 1 lb of calamari instead of 1 1/2 lb ... only because that's what my sweetheart brought home from the store. I liked having the extra vegetables in the end. I would like to try this with a mix of calamari, scallops and shrimp sometime.

Delightful, light starter. I went light on the onion because my onion was strong. Next time I would add a dash of crushed red pepper. Served with a white pizza as a first course. Everyone loved it!

Very easy to make. I added thinly sliced red chilies for some heat and add some chopped celery leaves as well. It was gobbled up and was the first dish to go at the potluck I brought it to.

A word of caution! This is addictive! I omit most of the parsley and go much lighter on the olive oil. This is just fantastic! Easy to make.

You must let it sit for a while and cool in the refrigerator. It's good but it's missing something, maybe feta cheese. Not sure what, maybe a little chili powder. Don't know, it just needs a little something. Overall it's nice.

I Loved this :-) As a relativly new cook, I found this exicting enough and easy enough to make with both my wife and three boys asking for seconds, I added a little feta for flavour and letting it sit was a very good idea... Making it again tonight for my mum's birthday.

This salad was good but a little on the bland side. Maybe because I doubled the recipe???? Had to spice it up a bit with dried red pepper flakes and more of the dressing. My guests enjoyed it very much.

I followed the recipe as written, but used a 2.2 lb block of defrosted frozen squid. The flavors really sing out. I'm using this for one of the fish courses for an Italian Christmas eve dinner, but I'm sure it will be used in summer as well.

Wow. Add me to the chorus of fans for this recipe. Perfect as listed, but I also look forward to some of the others cook's recommendaitons, such as adding shrimp and/or feta cheese. A great way to have calamari.

What a wonderful way to make a little calimari go a long way and to bypass the usual Greek-type salads! We grilled the calamari steaks two minutes over charcoal and mesquite. Then I followed the recipe exactly, except for using cilantro instead of fresh parsley. I cut the calamari into strips and soaked them in the lemon juice marinade. I think feta would be a wonderful addition. I served this with spinach-feta-dill stuffed grilled chicken breasts and a lemony Roma potato salad. The combination was delicious and healthful. One fourth served two perfectly.

Great, easy recipe. A nice side dish to bring to a party instead of the usual pasta salad. I sauteed the calamari for 1 min instead of boiling, but make sure to drain any rendered liquid. This is so simple and delicious that it will go into our regular repertoire.

We make this recipe all the time but we batter and deep fry the calamari for 75 seconds, add feta cheese and drizzle with a balsamic vinagrette instead of the red wine vinagrette. This is especially good if you use the more delicate greens and don't substitute hardier ones such as kale etc.

I served this as part of a Feast of the 7 Fishes celebration - a Big Hit! I made it the night before, and it really helped blend the flavors. Also, squid only needed 30-40 seconds of cooking.

This is really great-- and super easy. I'm going to add it to my repertoire of everyday dinners & make it all the time.

I made this for my wife along with a beef tenderloin covered with a port, shallots,cranberry and gorganzola. What a great dinner. This recipe is easy to make and taste great. Be careful with the time on the calimari...it's easy to overcook. Mine took 2 minutes but I used calimari steaks and not the fresh squid which is much thinner.

This is a very nice and refeshing salad that takes only minutes to make. If you want to impress your guests before your main course, this will give you some breathing room.... Add more garlic though, and perhaps some mint like I did.

I have made this dish twice in the past 3 weeks. It is delicious and very easy. The only thing I did differently was to add 2 more cloves of garlic and a 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to jazz it up a bit. Otherwise it is really good.

Definite keeper! Easy and full of flavor. I did add shrimp to make it more of a seafood salad. First time I ever cleaned/prepared squid, its a breeze. Cannot wait to make this again.
