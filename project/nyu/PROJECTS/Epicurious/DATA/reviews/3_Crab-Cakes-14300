Just what I (and my family) wanted in a crab cake. I did have a little mushiness problem (despite reducing the mayo from 1/2 c to a generous 1/4 c.). and increasing the breadcrumbs to a heaping 1/3 c. Next time, I'll also drain the onion/celery after sauteing them and cut back a bit more on the mayo. Flavors were perfect, however.

My favorite crab cake recipe - with a few minor changes. Better than the recipes that contain an egg. First I use crushed Saltine crackers instead of bread crumbs. My mom used to live in Baltimore and always used Saltines when she made crab cakes. Also needs a teaspoon of dry mustard or dijon. Next I make these into close to a ball shape. They keep their shape with no problems. And you can never add too much Old Bay!

old bay can also be found at your fish counter at your local store. It's usually in front by the glass, just ask at the counter. crab cakes were a little mushy, I added more bread crumbs

This is a comment only for "Toronto" below. You can find Old Bay on the lower level of the St. Lawrence Market at any of the little gourmet-grocery type stalls. Also at Bruno's, Pusateri's, and Loblaws. Good Luck!

I guess this isn't a terribly popular dish, but I'm going to re-review it anyway. I made it again this weekend, made some changes, & it was fabulous. I substituted sour cream for the mayo (& used it sparingly) & was generous with the Old Bay. I also used canned crab (last time I used fresh) & believe it or not, it was better. Somehow it all held together better. Great!

Very tasty. Good crab/bread crumb ratio. Very good served with a salsa or remoulade.

This recipe made the crab cakes way to mushy. Even after keeping them in the fridge for 4 hours they were totally soft and hard to turn over in the skillet. The taste was ok, but didn't look very pretty.

I happen to be allergic to shellfish, so believe it or not, I make this recipe with canned tuna. I also bake it rather than fry. It really is delicious. I use panko bread crumbs...

This was very quick and easy to make, but I thought the crab cakes were too mushy. I will probably use less mayo if I make these again.

I thought these were a little too mushy. Maybe I would use less mayo next time. Served these with Basil Aioli for my guests. They raved. I thought they were OK.

In Canada, Old Bay seasoning can be found at any Superstore/Supervalu or at Sobey's by the seafood counter.I like this recipe using crab flavored Pollock (sorry purists!)but I find that I really have to watch the amount of mayo or it tends to be too moist and won't hold its shape even after chilling. I love these broiled with a lovely Californian Fume Blanc!

Easy to prepare, you can't miss...guests over for my brunch last Sunday raved & raved! If you can't find Old Bay seasoning, there are recipes for it all over the internet.

I used Deltaville VA's recipe and it was delish. Thank you!

These were absolutely wonderful. Two of my guests said they were the best crab cakes they had ever eaten. I did not add the celery. Didn't want to take away from the crab flavor.

I live on Stingray Point on the Chesapeake Bay. I put crab pots off the dock to get crabs - I know how to make real crab cakes. When people add vegetables and stuff - onions, peppers, celery - they ruin crab cakes. Making crab cakes is simple: get 1 # of lump crab meat, add an egg or a couple of tablespoons of mayo, a little white bread soaked in milk OR some cracker crumbs to bind the crab, a touch of Worcestershire and/or mustard. Refrigerate the cakes for an hour or more so they hold together when you (1) deep fry them or (2) broil them. Serve w tartar sauce and/or lemon. A real crabcake is the essence of crab.

Do not add jalepenp peppers this is not a tex-mex recipe!

I cut back on the mayo, substituted jalepeno and a mix of diced orange and green peppers for the celery. I fried the cakes in oil and topped them with a simple fruit salsa and they were wonderful. When I stuck to the recipe, the cakes came out a bit wet and bland.

OK as a basic recipe but I've substituted red bell pepper for the celery and a finely chopped jajapeno for the tabasco and it's much better that way. Also I'm very careful not to mush up the crabmeat too much, it's lovely finding the big lumps of crab that way. :)

i served these with a pesto mayonaise (1 TB pesto stirred into a cup mayo) My husband is very picky about his crabcakes said they were restaurant quality.

I liked this as a basic recipe for crab cakes, however, 1/4 cup of onion and celery are enough and less bread crumbs (or none)worked out best for me. Of course you will need to add more crab, and nothing is wrong with that. Also use 1/4 cup of mayo instead of the 1/2 cup recommended. I also use very small amounts of other spices (to my taste) like garlic, salt and pepper. Fresh chives and a great mustard based sauce help complete the flavor that I desired.

I was disappointed in the consistency of the crabcakes. I was further surprised that other reviews did not reflect this. I would recommend using less mayo and draining more of the butter off of the initial onion/celery mixture. I would also appreciate any recommendations for improving the consistency. The flavor, although not as bold as I would have like it, was pleasing to others who tried it.

This was wonderful and easy to make. It didn't require a lot of utensils to make either which resulted in very easy clean up. I did use more Old Bay and Tobasco, about 1 TBS each. Excellent recipe. Do try it!!

i believe that the concept of just tossing a few liked ingredients together and hoping the result is a fabulous dish..etc. is a little too silly.

I used to live in Charlottesville and have since moved. I have missed the food at South Street and this is the best recipe I have found yet. Wonderful. However, I would use a little more crab and spice.

Old Bay seasoning is made by McCormick & Co., Inc. in Maryland. It contains celery salt, mustard, red pepper, black pepper, bay leaves, cloves, allspice, ginger, mace, cardamom, cinnamon, and paprika. Try a seafood store or fish market.

I have made a similar recipe and was going to try this one, but have no idea of what kind of spice that is! We don't have it in our local stores. Please tell me what is in it so that I can try to formulate a similar one.

I prefer broiled crab cakes to fried, so I changed a few ingredients: only a small amount of butter to saute the onion and celery, no bread crumbs, and only 1/3 cup mayo with 1Tbsp fresh lemon juice. The other ingredients were perfect, except I used a bit more tabasco. I put the crab mixture in individual baking dishes and broiled until bubbly. The dish was even more delicious, eaten cold, the next day.

Thoroughly enjoyed the crab cakes with an added twist. I deleted the parsley and replaced it with Cilantro and aded a 1/4 tp of red hot chili peppers. Just enough to give it a So. Ca taste not enough to dislike. JT
