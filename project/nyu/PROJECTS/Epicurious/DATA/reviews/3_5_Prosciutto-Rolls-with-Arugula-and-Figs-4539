I have made these on several occasions, using dried figs, fresh figs and dated. Everyone loves the unusual flavor combination. My tip was buying presliced prosciutto (costco has great prices), just make sure it has a piece of wax paper between each slice. The paper aids in rolling. I also used my fingers to spread the goat cheese. My only complaint is that in my opinion, they cannot be made too far in advance, because the arugula tends to wilt. They taste fine, but they look fab freshly made.

Love these! Simple flavors work beautifully together.

This is one of my favorite party foods. We first tried this at a friend's home during the holidays when she had received a whole prosiutto and we had to find things to do with it. This recipe was in the current Bon Appetit (1997) and we have made it ever since. It is also great without the figs which I mostly do.

Made these for a cocktail appetizer but, for ease of assembly and handling, layered ingredients on lavosh bread. Rolled and chilled and later sliced into pinwheels. Perhaps not as 'elegantly gourmet' of a presentation but easily made ahead and wonderfully delicious! The proscuitto can be paper thin if wrapped within the bread. The goat cheese mixture with the lemon and zest is fabulous and leftovers were enjoyed as a cracker/sandwich spread. Most definately a keeper. Many guests raved and asked for the recipe.

I love this and so do my friends! It's easy, unique and the flavor combinations are wonderful. Highly recommended.

though all these flavors are great together, the texture of these was absolutely awful. they were very gummy because of the figs, goat cheese and prosciutto.

Incredible. One useful tip for rolling the prosciutto is to put the figs and arugula only on 1/2 of the prosciutto. This permits tighter rolling and less chunky-looking rolls.

I LOVED this. So fresh and flavorful and Easter-y. We used some other kind of dried figs, and it came out great. I had the deli cut the proscuitto "thin, but not paper thin" and that did the trick. One bag of arugula from trader joe's was more than enough - couldn't find any bunches.

This was a huge disappointment. The texture of the rolls was too gummy with the dried figs, goat cheese, and prosciutto. They were unpleasant to chew!

Great summer appetizer. Used fresh figs. I agree, need to make sure proscuitto is not too thin. This was a hit at a dinner party.

This was a snap to make, and absolutely delicious! I used pre-packaged proscuitto which was too thin, so next time I'll get it from the deli counter. The combination of ingredients is marvelous, and it looks great too.

Great recipe. It was a bit hard to work with the prosciutto but once you rolled it you could not tell if it broke. They went very fast and everyone loved them. I had to substitute fresh figs and the taste was great!

This appetizer did not turn out as outstanding as I hoped. Some of the guests at the Christmas party really seemed to like it but some did not care for it much. Some of the prosciutto slices had ripes which made them difficult to roll and the filling kept falling out. I liked the different flavors but I will not make it for a crowd again.

I made this twice in one week for two different groups. It was a major hit. I had the butcher slice the prosciutto just a little thicker and it was perfect -- really not at all hard to make. I will definitely make it again.

Well... I used the fresh figs as several people suggested. I also had just the right thickness of prosciutto di parma and nuked some Humbolt Fog goatcheese for a few seconds. The rolls were not that messy to create and did look wonderful, although mine were quite large. But to my taste the fresh figs gave an overpowering sweetness to the whole thing that was not offset by the saltiness of the prosciutto. I might try this again with no fruit filler or a different, less saccharine one - pomegranate seeds?

Easy and definitely a keeper! I used fresh black mission figs that are in the farmers market now. Will make more tonight.....perfect appetizer.

I make this for most dinner parties and Thanksgiving etc - delicious except I leave out the arugula which makes me gag. I think it is even more fabulous with fresh figs, as suggested below.

Have made w/both fresh and dried figs - found I liked the fresh figs the best. I agree that you need thicker PROSCIUTTO - I used some from Costco with 3 slices per roll. Also used Humbolt Fog goat cheese which made them even better than w/regular goat cheese from the store. A truly wonderful appetizer!

I made this recipe for three parties I attended and it was a hit each time. I had the prosciutto cut in thicker slices and it was a little more difficult to eat. I would go thinner with the prosciutto.

I've made this recipe several times, always to rave reviews and I've passed the recipe on to several people. I put the chevre in the microwave for about 20 seconds to make it easier to spread without ripping the prosciutto. I cut them in half to make them go farther. I find them easier to eat if I cut the figs into small pieces rather than in half. A very tasty and elegant appetizer

Rating: 3
Great flavors, my guests loved them. The prosciutto definitely needs to be sliced thicker than normal. I skipped the lemon and olive oil and used fresh figs. I spread the goat cheese with my fingers! They were clean! It was easier than using a knife.

This appetizer is delicious, has great "wow" appeal and is easy to prepare. Using a very spreadable goat cheese is half the battle. We like fresh figs, when available, rather than dried. Their flavor and texture are perfect in this. A keeper!

This taste great without figs which is the only way I have ever prepared it. It is extremely impressive looking tastes great and is easy if not a little time consuming.

Followed the instructions exactly. Very pretty sitting on a white platter with the pink pruscuitto and arugula peaking out of the top like flowers in a vase. Serve standing upright versus laying down. I served at a party and they were gobbled up in minutes. This is a keeper recipe for events where you want to show off your culinary skills. Hints: heat for 10 seconds the goat cheese in micro; slice prosciutto thicker than normal; slice figs thinly versus quarters; serve with a fresh light wine like a pino grigio.

Wonderful combination. The sweet and salty and cheese work together so well. I used black-edged ham for the prosciutto and it worked better. I used baby spinach for the arugula.

Rating: 3
A good appetizer. I found that keeping the knife wet with hot water helped to spread the goat cheese. I would recommend not buying packaged prosciutto, have the deli cut thicker slices for you. Also it will keep in the fridge for 3 days if covered with a damp paper towel and sealed in an air-tight container.

A bit labor-intensive, but great flavors and a nice presenation. A big hit at the wine and champagne tasting...BUT, even with the proscuitto sliced a little thicker than normal, I had problems with it tearing when spreading the goat cheese - I had better luck by spreading the cheese with my hands rather than a knife - made for a lot of hand-washing, but it worked out well.

The saltyness of the proscuiotto and the cheese are are well balanced with the sweetness of the mission figs and the peppery taste of the arugala. I left out the oil and the lemon mixture because I felt the lemon would over power the other tastes. I tried this out on my girlfriends and their husbands. I had rave reviews. I will be using it as an appetizer on Christmas Eve

Most of my 35 guests liked these, and a few loved them. I had really high hopes for these though... And while they were good, they didn't quite live up to my expectations. I used high quality ingredients, but the flavors didn't play off each other as boldly as I had hoped. Also, the lemon flavor was stronger than expected. Not quite the bang for the buck I had hoped for consdiering the cost of good prosciutto. A couple of notes: 1) Buy 50% more prosciutto & goat cheese, otherwise you'll have leftover oil/lemon mixture, arugala, and sliced figs. 2) Double-check the size and thickness while the deli guy slices the prosciutto. Sometimes they get lazy part-way through the slicing.

Now a family-wide favorite, coast-to-coast. Christmas just wouldn't be the same without this exquisite flavored, beautiful starter.

I had a cocktail party and these were the last things I had made after 9 straight hours of cooking, so they are probably, in actuality less exhausting to make than I remember. I thought they were good. Some people thought they were really great but the other reviewer was correct about this "not being for a meat-and-potatoes crowd". It was very attractive-looking, and very rich-tasting.

These were great, and a big hit with the guests. When I make them again I will chop the figs into smaller pieces and perhaps cut the prosciutto into strips that are narrower than the 2 1/2 inch strips I used.

Rating: 4
Delicious combination of salty, sweet, sour, peppery, but inadequate instructions. Don't need even half of the oil mixture, don't need "4 large bunches" of arugula, need plenty of time to assemble, and if the proscuiutto tears, roll as tight as you can and insert a colorful toothpick. Finally, not for the meat & potatoes crowd!

I've made it three times now...always get raves when I take it to a party!

These are amazing! I will absolutely make them again. The combination of flavors was wonderful. I took them to a small get together and they went over very well. You need to be sure to have your meat counter slice the prosciutto thicker than they normally would. Also, I warmed the goat cheese up a little bit in the microwave and it was very easy to spread.

I received great reviews on these. The flavor of the salty procuitto and the tartness of the goats cheese with the sweetness of the figs was a symphony in our mouths. Presentation wasn't that bad either. Yes, you must slice the ham thicker than you would normally, but I have no problem serving these delicious roll-ups again at my next Italian themed dinner party.

We loved all the listed ingredients and couldn't wait to make this for Christmas Eve--what a disaster. I agree the last review, too hard to roll, messy and the taste was sooooo boring. The price we paid for these expensive items and we ended up throwing the majority away. We made people try, but not one person went back for a second. Wouldn't do again even any other way!

Either my prosciutto was sliced too thin or my rolling skills were less than stellar, but I ended up having to use two slices of proscutto to roll the darn things, and cheese squirted out everywhere, making it look like really fatty meat. It was an expensive appetizer that turned out to be a disaster asthetically. It tasted good, but hardly anyone touched them without my prodding.

The combination of flavors simply bursts in your mouth. Everyone requested the recipe at a recent dinner party. We had a few left over and they were even better the next day. I also like the fact that it is a beautiful presentation and very unusual.

I served these at a Christmas party and everyone raved. The one problem: the prosciutto is very salty so everyone begs for water afterward. Only serve if you've got a good supply of drinks on hand!

Delicious, easy recipe to start a meal. Can also be varied/simplified to suit ingredients/time available. At different times I have used ricotta instead of goats cheese, watercress instead of arugola, and omitted the dressing.
