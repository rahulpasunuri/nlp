Very easy and yummy recipe to make. I suggest at least 1 tsp of salt if not 1.5 tsp. Also to get rid of the lumpiness of the custard mix, pour the mixture into a blender and it will get rid of all the lumpiness and make everything super smooth.

This was the first homemade ice cream my hubby and I made in our new ice cream maker. The flavor is ok, but honestly, too sweet and rich. I love custards and am a big fan of sweets, so I do not say this easily! However, I am surprised to read the reviews of people using even more cream or eggs than called or, or adding other toppings to counter-act the richness. I'd just prefer it was less rich or there was another counteracting flavor in the recipe. Overall, it was not well balanced.

OMG, this ice cream (actually frozen custard) is out of this world! It sent quivers throughout my body. Like many others, I doubled the salt (total of 1 tsp) and also substituted 5 yolks for 3 full eggs. I am a picky foodie, but this just became my favorite ice cream. It is rich, but I found that the addition of roasted pecans balances the richness and also provides the perfect crunch texture. It stays soft in the freezer which is also a bonus for homemade ice cream. Be careful when cooking the sugar to make the caramel. Black pans will make the melted sugar look darker than it is. This is NOT a bland ice cream, so reviewers that thought it was bland did not cook the sugar long enough to turn it into caramel. Just don't cook too long and burn it. I highly recommend that you go make this ice cream right now...go...do it...what are you waiting for?...seriously, do it.

This ice cream is DIVINE! It is as good as the Talenti Sea Salt Caramel Gelato that I buy at Whole Foods, which is my absolute favorite frozen dessert. The texture is amazing and there is no need to let it thaw before dipping your spoon into the container when pulling it from the freezer  this ice cream stays perfectly soft when frozen. I used regular sea salt instead of Maldon, since that was hard to find. I also misunderstood the directions and let the base freeze in the freezer instead of chill in the fridge for 3-6 hours. I let my frozen base thaw just a bit before putting it in the ice cream maker and my ice cream was ready to eat straight out of the machine. Judging from other reviews, it seems like my mistake was the key to getting my ice cream to firm up easily.

Amazing!! I used 1/4 cup less sugar, sub'd skim milk/half and half for part of the heavy cream, used more salt. This ice cream is amazing. I had made another Salted Caramel Ice Cream from another site, but this one is hands down the best and the easiest!

This is my family's favorite ice cream. I have made this recipe many, many times. Getting caramel to exactly the right point is tricky business. I recommend a white enamel lined cast iron skillet - makes it so much easier to see what's going on with the sugar.

I splurged and bought the ice cream maker attachment for my stand mixer (which face it, is also a splurge for a single person), and have spent the entire summer making a ridiculous amount of ice cream in a ridiculous array of flavours. This one by far is everyone's favourite. I have made it at least half a dozen times. It is great on its own, complements most baked goods (mmm apple pie) and is obscenely good with candied pecans. I use all 10% cream instead of the mixture of cream/milk, and have upped the salt amount by a bit, and am now using the custard (love that it is whole eggs!) as my base for other ice cream flavours.

Rating: 4
Probably the most eye-rolling good thing I've ever made from this site. I've made this a few times now, and here are my lessons learned: (1) varying the dairy (proportions of cream and milk) is scarcely noticeable as long as the total amount is respected; (2) because of the high sugar content, the mixture needs to be chilled to ice- cold before adding to a home ice-cream maker or it won't get thick; (3) yes, you do have to strain the custard; and (4) *this is key*: making caramel requires good light and nerves of steel. Make sure you have your cream right next to the pot and ready to pour. In the 30 seconds it takes to open a cream carton your caramel can go from perfect to burnt - but to get the best flavour it needs to be almost too dark. Salt will counteract the emerging bitterness of a darker caramel. (Any reviewers who found this bland used a too-light caramel.)

My previous review was only 1 fork for being tasteless. I tried it a 2nd time and cooked the caramel longer to get stronger taste. Unfortunately, burnt the caramel. Tried a 3rd time and voila ... perfect blend of caramel and salt. DEFINITELY will make it again.

i know ice cream. there is no better ice cream on earth. ive made it & served it several times & everyone who tastes it say it's the best ice cream they've ever had. the depth of flavors, & the thick creamy texture cannot be matched. i add an extra 1/4 tsp of salt to the recipe & top with baby banana, candied pecans & hand whipped cream.

Made this for 2nd time and it was even better than the 1st. I realize now that first time I had slightly burned the caramel, was very careful this time to watch it and cook it slowly and it turned out perfect. Also increased salt to 1 tsp (must use Maldon salt flakes), and used 5 egg yolks instead of 3 whole eggs (egg white is unusual in ice cream). Served as a macaron sandwich with my own home made espresso flavored macarons. Delicious.

Rating: 4
Excellent ice cream! Made as directed but increased salt to 1 teaspoon as others had recommended. Had no problems with caramel seizing. The custard, despite slowly tempering the eggs, still began to curdle. Grabbed the whisk and used it to finish the process -- turned out perfect. Did strain the custard. Will make again and try using smoked maldon salt which we sprinkled over the top.

Rating: 2
The flavor of this ice cream is AMAZING! It's smooth and silky! So why only 2 forks? Well...it's way too rich, 1 spoonfull was about my limit. I think swapping the whole milk for the cream amount would help or perhaps using half and half to cut the cream. There isn't enough salt as written, you must double it. My biggest complaint: after 6 hours in the freezer it still wasn't that cold or frozen- I like my ice cream cold!! And finally, too much sugar! You could easily skip the final 1/4 cup of sugar and it would be plenty sweet.

Rating: 4
Holy cow, this is soooooo good. As soon as I tasted it, I started making a second batch because I knew it wouldn't last long! TIPS: 1) Cook the caramel on low heat so it doesn't burn 2) Double the salt. 3) Don't worry if the caramel siezes...it will melt eventually 4) cook the custard slowly so it doesn't curdle. 5) Hide some in the back of the freezer so you can have some just for yourself--you'll be surprised how quickly this disappears!

I guess I'm the only person who thinks this ice cream is bland. I followed the recipe to the tee. I even used 3 whole eggs even tho I questioned whether that was a misprint and should have been 3 egg yolks. I've made caramel before and lots of custard-based ice creams so I didn't have any problems with either. I added a bit more Maldon salt based on everyone's comments. The caramel itself tasted great ... but once I mixed it with the custard base, I could barely detect the salt or, frankly, much flavor at all. Yes, it's very smooth and silky texture-wise, but I won't bother making it again. I'll go back to my favorite corn gelato (on this site) for my go-to ice cream.

Flavor and texture are amazing! It was slow to chill, set up in the ice cream maker, and for the final freeze. First time making a dry caramel so that was fun to try. Used the Ice Cream bowl for my Kitchen Aid mixture and wished I had made a double batch as it would have easily fit! And next time I will make it the day before I want to serve it! The time guidelines were way low unless you have a blast chiller and professional grade ice cream maker in my opinion!

Just be careful with the caramel, it can burn very quickly. I used 1 tsp of Maldon salt. Excellent!

The ice cream is spectacular. Let's just start with that. After reading many of the reviews I made a couple of decisions that changed the process a bit. 1) Temper the eggs to cut down on the "scrambled' effect in the custard. 2) Add more milk (2%) to cut the richness. I also found that the suggestions to warm the cream were critical to decreasing the amount of caramel that seized. A warning: if you think the stirring process will be quick you are wrong. It took me about 40 minutes to stir the hardened caramel back into the warm cream - I kept the burner on very low during the process to aid the melting. I'd give this a four but it was very involved - much more than I thought. I would have expected it to take 30 minutes to make the custard and caramel but I ended up spending more like an hour and 15 minutes from start to chill. Leave the mixture in the fridge for a few hours (at least four) before you even try to freeze. It also firms up nicely if you give it an overnight before you pair it with warm brownies for desert. We used the layered brownies with white-chocolate caramel recipe from this site.

After having salted carmel ice cream at Magic Fountain ice cream in Riverhead, NY on my way back from the Hamptons ... I decided it was one of the best things I have eaten. I have always skipped making it because the recipe was so time consuming! I had some extra time and insomnia tonight, so I made it. The taste of this ice cream is great!!! Like many other reviewers mention, the salt level is waaaaaay too little in the recipe. I tried doubling it to a teaspoon and found myself adding another teaspoon and a few pinches for good measure and the taste was perfect! I have never made carmel or custard before. The carmel came out great on the first try. I thought I burned it a little at initial taste, but it mellowed once it cooled off. The hardest part that I was unable to get right was the custard. Mine came out lumpy each time. I went through a whole dozen eggs! Finally, on the third attempt at non-lumpy custard (used low heat and light stirring instead of medium the last time) the egg still scrambled in the milk mixture. A little less than the first time but still had lumps in it. As a result, my ice cream is not the prettiest and has a slight eggy taste, but is very close to what I remembered. Maybe next time, I will use an instant custard instead of trying to make it myself. I googled everything I could think of for the 2nd or 3rd batch but still got the lumpiness. Anyone know how to cut the eggs out of this recipe??? Great taste though! It said it made 1 quart, so I doubled the recipe and after some of the liquids simmered out during cooking, it fit in my 1.5 quart cuisenart ice cream maker perfectly.

It is worth making if you are a little unsre of a salted icecream...you'll love it!! It is not overly salty, jsut not overly sweet. DELICIOUS!!!!

I've made this recipe twice, and both times this recipe has produced simply beautiful ice cream. The texture and flavor are perfect, don't change a thing. Note: Don't freak out when the liquidized sugar binds up after you pour the cream in. It will dissolve with patient stirring.

I love this recipe, but have streamlined it. I put a cup of sugar in a 4 cup pyrex bowl with 1 TBs of water, mixed well. Microwave on high for 6 min., do not stir. Pour in 1 1/4 cps. of half and half, 2 tsp. of salt and a 1 tsp. of vanilla. The caramel will seize up, but just let it set and melt in the liquid. In another micro wave proof bowl, mix together 1/4 cup sugar, the three eggs and 2 cups of half and half, micro on high for 6 min., whisking half way through. Combine the caramel with the custard and chill. The whole process takes about 15 min.

I'm going to descent from some of the reviews here. I'll give it 4 forks but with one modification. I made this twice; once exactly as written and once substituting half-and-half for cream in the caramel sauce. The second batch turned out much more well balanced and sacrificed no taste. The first batch was far to rich. I also used a full teaspoon of sea salt both times. Otherwise, this will be an ongoing staple.

I followed the recipe almost exactly except changing the creme and milk ratio from 2.25: 1 to 1.5:1.75 and I used 2% milk instead of whole milk. The ice cream came out phenomenal. I agree with other reviewers that maybe you should increase the salt in order to really taste it, but I think just a bit of sea salt really added the complexity of the flavor instead of just tasting salty. You can always sprinkle a bit sea salt on top during presentation.

I make this all the time.... it is incredible. To streamline, I make the caramel and then add the other ingredients to the same pot and cook the custard with the caramel.

The ice-cream is wonderful. Perhaps my salt is just really really mild, but I end up using about 1 1/2 tsp because there is no discernbile salt taste with only 1/2 tsp. The ice-cream stays soft and never crystallizes and I have made is many times. Great with homemade hot fudge sauce!

Here's a tip for making the caramel: do it in the microwave. Combine the sugar with 1/4 cup water - just enought to wet the sugar - in a 4 cup Pyrex measuring cup and microwave it on high until it turns golden. Take it out when it is a couple of shades lighter than you want, as it will continue to darken. Wear gloves to protect your hands from the steam and add the cream, stirring, a little at a time. It will boil furiously. Continue adding cream and stirring until the sugar dissolves. If there's a little left on the spoon, use this spoon when stirring the custard - that will take care of the rest of it. Another tip: if you, like I, am a devotee of coffee ice cream, caramelizing half or all the sugar in the recipe will give it tremendous depth of flavor - much better than all white sugar would have ever done. We are huge ice cream fans and make ice creams year round; these are two of our faves.

Delicious! I made this ice cream for my dad's birthday and he said it was the best homemade ice cream he's ever had. It was so smooth and creamy. I was worried that I would burn the caramel or curdle the custard, but I followed the recipe to a t and everything worked perfectly!

Decadent is truly the only word for this ice cream. I had the same problem of the custard curdling almost immediately, and it never did stick to the wooden spoon, but I went ahead and mixed it in without straining through the sieve, then quickly gave the mixture a spin in my blender before chilling. The final product was smooth as silk and perfect! As it is so rich, I served one scoop alongside a scoop of good vanilla to cut the sweetness a tad as the caramel is so rich. My guests did an awful lot of moaning...I guess it was a hit!

I am in love with this ice cream. I didn't have any fancy Maldon salt, so I used David's kosher flake sea salt. It turned out perfect... I even messed up on the custard (my pet peeve) but strained it through a cheesecloth and saved it - it had just barely started to boil so it wasn't too curdled. Oh my this ice cream is soooo heavenly; the perfect combination of sweet and salty. I didn't have any trouble getting the sugar to melt, as other reviewers have stated - I used a heavy, non-stick stainless skillet and followed the instructions and, much to my delight, it turned into beautiful deep amber caramel. YUM. I will be making this again and again.

This is a staple for my ice cream making adventures. After making it once it was very easy to repeat. I used half 'n half instead of milk and shaved down the measurements of the heavy cream (2 cups half 'n half and 1 cup heavy cream). It came out divine!

Totally moan-inducing indulgence! I wouldn't add anything; just enjoy the smooth richness and crème brulée flavour! I only made one change, which was to add a couple spoonsful of water to the sugar to be caramelized (I've had better luck with this than the dry method.)

I tried salted caramel ice cream for the first time in Paris a few years ago-- it was a total epiphany! When I saw this recipe I knew I had to make it. I served this last night at a dinner party and I have to say, I agree with many of the posts-- Best.Ice cream.Ever. I didn't add anything to it, but next time I will try out some of the suggested enhancements-- I think Skor bar chunks could take this right off the map for awesomeness!

I made this twice and it was a HUGE hit with both crowds!! I had trouble with finding the right heat for the dry caramel... I kept burning it before all the sugar dissolved (and when I reduced the heat, it wouldn't melt). I found more success when I reduce the heat (slightly) just after the sugar starts to melt. Also, I liked how it tasted when I added more salt, but remember that the more salt you add, the longer the ice cream takes to set up in the freezer. It helps to chill the custard in the fridge overnight before freezing it in the machine (and develops the flavors nicely too!) It is divine topped with the Candied Bacon recipe from this site. :)

The flavor of this ice cream is so amazing. And the texture is lovely and smooth as well.

It's gone straight into my "keeper recipe" folder.

Excellent ice cream! I made 3/4s of the caramel, so it wouldn't be exceedingly sweet. Next time I might stop the caramel at a medium amber, because the sugar continues to cook after being removed from the heat - unless I shock it in an ice bath. Heating the cream before adding it to the sugar greatly reduces the splattering. Also, whipping half the sugar to the milk/cream mixture and the other half to the eggs will help reduce the chances of cooking the eggs, when tempering them. If the eggs go over 180'F they begin to curdle so I made sure to keep an eye on the temperature. Normally I make ice cream with just yolks, so this recipe was a nice surprise. Great flavor combination!

this ice cream is INCREDIBLE! the flavor is so intense but simple, you really cannot go wrong. I changed the proportions of milk to cream so that it was a bit lighter, but the texture was still some of the best I;ve achieved in ice cream.

I also added a few flakes of that maldon salt on top and VOILA!

@Boston 7/31, it seems that pouring the eggs into the hot or warm cream without tempering would result in more eggy sediment, not less?

Really great flavor! I made slight modifications. I used kosher salt because I didn't have sea salt. Also, I only used egg yolks. I didn't mix in the remaining sugar into the milk, but rather the egg yolks. Then, I slowly poured the egg/sugar mixture into the simmering cream off the heat. Once all incorporated, I moved it back to the stove top to reach 170 degrees. This resulted in no egg bits that required straining. I took the mixture to my boyfriends lab and used it as one of 4 liquid nitrogen ice cream flavors. It retained its creamy texture and was a hit. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was delicious in a gelato sort of way, very rich. But I wish the recipe was more specific on the custard part. I cooked the custard until it clung to the wood spoon, and was just starting to bubble at the edges, then had to push it through a sieve with lots of eggy type solids left behind. I wish I knew what I was looking for on this part,and that I did it correctly. I doubled the recipe, and added double salt after reading comments here. I used fleur de sel, since I didn't have flaked salt. But it doesn't seem to matter what salt you use, because the salt melts into the caramel? My caramel bubbled into a boil while I was looking for containers to freeze it in for friends, and I worried it was burnt. But this recipe seems fool proof, and it turned out great. My freezer, a Rival electric that uses ice and rock salt, ran only 20 minutes and the resulting cream was pretty firm, unlike the recipe suggestion that is would be "quite soft." Only my second batch of ice cream, but it was very good, and I split a double recipe among 3 families.

I wanted to love this ice cream, and the texture was divine, but I thought the flavor was a little bland. I even added a little extra salt after reading the reviews, but still had to add a sprinkle at serving time to tell it was there at all. And the caramel flavor was also not very pronounced - but I've never made caramel before, maybe I should have cooked the sugar a little longer before adding the cream? It was amber colored, but maybe it needed to be darker for a really caramel flavor.

I've made this delicious ice cream twice now! My advice for anyone who makes this is not to get worried if the caramel gets hard and lumpy after adding the cream. Stir slowly with a wooden spoon and in no time the ball of caramel will incorporate itself into the mixture. This ice cream is so delicious that I found myself licking the bowl after eating it. Salted caramel ice cream is a must-try.

Heavenly texture and taste. I used maldon sea salt, adding about an 1/8 tsp extra. I used the egg yolks only, not the whole eggs. When I tasted the custard, it seemed way too bitter, and I was afraid that I had cooked my caramel too long, but it became sweeter as it cooled, and was completely sweet enough once it was frozen as ice cream.

Count me among the folks who swoon over this decadent dessert. I, too, heat the cream and have no problem with the caramel melting. I'm making it for the third time today to take to a potluck party of prideful cooks and ice cream fanatics and am going to take copies of the recipe because I know it will be requested. In my ice cream maker (Cuisinart), some of the caramel settles to the bottom. No problem - I just swirl it in as I spoon it into the container in which I ripen the ice cream and call it salted caramel swirl. Bonus!

This is decadent. Some thoughts now that I've made it plus some of the other comments here: this is a dry caramel, and it takes time to truly melt. Even with warmed cream, it will still sieze, but it does melt back down. Mine did turn out darker than the picture, and I only yielded a pint and half, so I may double in the future. I may try a wet caramel next time. With that said, this is exceptional. Sinful, sultry, evil, delicious all at once. I made this for a gift basket. Next time, I will make it for a dinner group and serve with a sprinkling of flaked sea salt on top.

I wanted to make this because I adore the salter caramel ice cream at Bi-Rite Creamery in San Francisco. This ice cream is pretty amazing and not too difficult to make with the ice cream maker, etc. It tastes just like Bi-Rite's. I didn't find it too sweet at all - it was actually almost bitter from the salt - in a good way. I served it with apple pie and it was great. I didn't have cheesecloth and it turned out perfectly smooth.

Delicious as is, but I tried adding some peanuts at the end of the churning, and it was to die for. The crunch was a perfect complement to the creaminess of the ice cream. I also found the recipe very forgiving...you can always pull out pieces of hardened sugar or scrambled eggs, no need for a sieve. For non-special occasions I may try some of the recommendations for lower calorie options.

Wow - this is SO good! My partner said it felt sinful eating it. Reminded us of the gelato you find in Italy - great creamy texture. This is a recipe I will play with to try and cut down on the cream while not losing the texture. I would give this 5 forks!

Oh My Goodness. I have made a lot of ice cream and gelato in my time, but this is one of the best. I had no problems with the caramel or the custard. I did double the sea salt to 1 teaspoon based on others' reviews. Plan to serve with brownies but really it needs no accompaniment. Could also imagine with an apple dessert as others have suggested or with an espresso poured over.

It's my first time making ice cream, but what success! This was AMAZING. Silky, deeply caramel, rich and decadent. I had some trouble with the caramel but lots of patient stirring helped (I crushed up the remaining chunks of sugar and added it as a crunchy topping). We could not wait for the icecream to firm up and had some in a rather liquid pudding texture! (Like flan, said my partner!) The recipe makes an icecream that is a little too sweet for my preference, so next time I'll use a tad more salt to cut thru the sweetness and use about half the caramel; the extra caramel can serve as a topping for those with a sweeter tooth. Fantastic recipe!

Wow. Like the others, I can't get over the texture of this ice cream. Very much like gelato- so velvety smooth. Per some other suggestions, I heated the cream before pouring it into the carmel. I'm not sure it helped, because it took a loooong time to melt the carmel back down into liquid after it initially seized up. That said, it did eventually melt and I did not need to use a sieve. I did pick out one little chunk that didn't melt down. I used a low heat on the custard until I got impatient and then turned it up to high, whisking the whole time. It never did get to 175 degrees on the thermometer, but coated the spoon. It got a little bit "textured"- not quite like scrambled eggs- but I didn't bother to strain it. Cooled the custard and the carmel in ice baths, combined them afterwards, chilled a little more, and into the ice cream canister they went. In 30 minutes it was done. Even without the straining through a sieve, the texture is amazing. I will add about 1/4- 1/2 more salt next time. Since I couldn't find "flaky" sea salt ANYWHERE in my little town, I used regular fine sea salt and ground it finer using a morter and pestle. PERFECTION. I'm serving it tomorrow with an apple crumble. Ooohh. :)

There were a couple times I thought I was in trouble making this. First, it initially seemed I had made rock candy instead of caramel. If you keep melting it, though, it will eventually smooth out fine. Secondly, I cooked the custard a little too much and had to discard some egg. Neither problem had any effect on the ice cream as far as I can tell. This is a serious dessert. I wouldn't hesitate to call it the most tempting I've ever made. It calls you back. It demands.

Just as good as my favorite burnt caramel ice cream from Toscanini's (Cambridge, MA)! I am amazed that I can make this at home. I was worried about making the caramel, but it turned out that the custard was the part I messed up -- I wasn't paying attention while it was heating and didn't stir. It basically turned into pudding. But after forcing it through a sieve and discarding some of the solids, it was fine. I substituted 2% milk, which I had on hand, for all the whole milk and 1/4 cup of the cream. It still tasted rich and creamy, so I would do this again to cut down on some of the fat.

Very rich ice cream, served with the Vanilla Peach Pie from this site. Next time I would heat the heavy cream up before pouring into the hot caramel. The cold cream turned the caramel into a rock and it look a LONG TIME to get the carmel to dissolve back into the cream, I ended out taking a big chunk out and calling it good enough!

This was my first attempt at home made ice cream. Followed the receipe exactly and had no issues. The ice cream is absolutely divine. It made a little more than a pint - but that is ok because it is exceptionally rich, perhaps the most rich ice cream I've ever tasted. Will definitely be making again - soon!

The best homemade icecream I have ever made. No crystals, just pure silk. The caramel did sieze up and while I was able to get most of it to redissolve, there were a few chunks that were resistant. I used a colander to remove any of the lumps. The custard turned out perfectly. It came up to temp VERY fast, so use your thermometer to check after a few whisks.

This ice cream is amazing! I added a bit more sea salt (an additional 3/4 tsp) as I prefer salty to sweet and it worked great. This was my first foray into ice cream making and this may be the only ice cream I ever eat.

This is so ridiculously good that I have made 5 batches in the past 10 days. The trickiest part for me is adding the cream to the caramel without it all seizing up; reheating the cream-caramel mixture to melt the lumps tends to overly darken the caramel and create bitter/burnt off notes. I found that heating up the cream and adding it very slowly to the caramel while stirring vigorously to be helpful

Yes, this recipe is everything everyone has stated. Fabulous, spoon licking, indulgent and sinful. I did experience problems with it freezing, and like others returned it to the fridge for several hours and tried again. Boy was it worth it. I'm going to make it again in a few weeks since we are entering apple season in the Pacific North West and this just screams to serve with a hot apple pie. My old seasonal favorite ice cream (pumpkin) has now been replaced with this one.

Okay, my husband LICKED the empty ice cream bowl...we ate some soft serve consistency from the ice cream maker last night, will have some with a firmer texture tonight. Served with purchased paper-thin ginger cookies. Had no trouble with procedure - did omit the final 1/4 cup sugar and cooked the custard in the pan with the caramel. Worked fine for me - just took my time - no scrambled eggs, nothing to run through the strainer - just perfect, silky, creamy CARAMEL to die for!!! Make it - you won't be sorry!!!

oh my. one word to describe this ice cream? "naughty." Deep caramel flavor and ultra-creamy texture. I guess it's a bit more labor intensive than some ice cream recipes, and who wants to spend all that time over the stove during the dog days of summer? BUT the results are worth it.

A simple recipe for an ice cream that wows guests. So thick, so creamy. I served this with an apple pie to finish off a late summer dinner. So good, I didn't want to share!

So delicious!!!!! I had the same trouble with the conversion process as an earlier reviewer and suspected my bowl (kitchenaid ice cream attachment) wasn't sufficiently cold. After 1 hour - nothing, the mix was still liquid. So, I poured the liquid back into a bowl, stuck it in the fridge, put my ice cream bowl into the freezer and set it to its coldest setting. Left it overnight. About 14 hours later, the liquid was fine, the bowl was absolutely frozen, and I had ice cream in 15 minutes. Two lessons - make sure your equipment is adequately cold and the ice cream mix can withstand the abuse of trying more than once.

I must admit that I had to do the custard over once since the first time I made scrambled eggs. The next time I cooked it more slowly and it turned out perfectly. We loved this.

I have made a lot of ice cream and a decent amount of caramel ice cream and this one is the best. I actually used a different method for the caramel making process the second time and thought it came out creamier. Basically the same ingredients but using water to get to that first amber stage. I found it harder to get the caramel to go back to liquid stage with this dry version and not sure why. I use the receipe in the first tom douglas cookbook, Seattle Kitchen, for the caramel.

Very decadent with a lovely texture. It's just a little too sweet for me, and I didn't even add all of the caramel. Next time I'll try it with half the caramel and see what happens.

I'm a homemade ice cream novice, and even I could do this one! The texture is amazing, the taste divine. I too had to make the custard twice because I had the flame too hot... but it was worth it. It beats any ice cream I've ever had!

HOLY COW! I've been eating home made ice cream my entire life. I've been making home made ice cream my entire adult life..about 32 years...and this is absolutely the most amazing one of all. The texture is untouchable! If you make one recipe this year...make this one.

I'm not sure what it is about this recipe that makes the texture so perfect (Less eggs? Adding caramel separately?), but I want all of my ice creams to end up this delicious. It was so good that while I was eating it, I thought to myself, "I'm going to have to write my first review on Epicurious for this".

This was so, so good. My 7 year old just said that if I ever make ice cream again, this is the one to make. He's right. I did cook the egg mixture too fast and had to strain a lot of scrambled eggs out but the final product is amazing.

I can't give any forks at this point, because the ice cream won't freeze. It tastes amazing, and with a friend's extra set of hands to help me, the custard and caramel was easy to make. But its been in the ice-cream maker for almost 4 hours and isn't freezing. I am going to try just putting it in the freezer and then stirring it ever so often because otherwise It will be impossible to eat at all.

I have never written a review...until now. Unbelieveably delicious and sensuous. Warning: highly addictive. Even when I though I had cooked the custard maybe a little too much, it worked out exquisitely. Very impressive summer dessert.

Made this for dessert last night. The process of making the caramel separately was new to me -- I usually use a Claudia Fleming recipe in which you make the caramel (with water), add the milk and cream and use that to warm the eggs, etc. I'm not sure the extra pan (for the caramel was necessary), but the result was very creamy. I could have used a bit more salt, though; it was pretty sweet. Overall, great texture and worth doing again.

A little too sweet for me but, the deep caramel flavor is intense. I chilled both the caramel and custard separately in a double bowl of ice water and then put into ice cream maker. This cut the chilling period down to about 20 minutes. After 30 minutes in the ice cream maker, ice cream was thick enough to put into freezer for about 2 hours. I'll try next time with less sugar.

Holy cow. This is delicious. It's like eating spoonfuls of really delicious caramel. It definitely needs the salt. In fact, I might almost add a little more than 1/2 teaspoon. But not much. My only beef is that the recipe isn't written very well. I haven't made custard in a year or so, and forgot that the burner needs to be VERY LOW after tempering the egg, otherwise you'll end up with a saucepot full of scrambled eggs. I tried to rush it and had to scrap it and start over. I just forgot that you can't rush this. Had the recipe pointed out what temperature to use, I probably wouldn't have done that. I'd just be concerned for folks who have never done it before and might make the same mistake.

Ice cream to die for. I did have to make the caramel twice, as the first time I ended up with a crystallized mess because I stirred it too much. The 2nd time was better, but when I added the cream it all froze into a lump of caramel. Took a lot of stirring to get most of it dissolved and I strained out the rest. Other than those issues, the texture is perfect and the saltiness just right.

This ice cream was absolutely amazing. I can't recommend it enough. When I was making the custard, it seemed to boil before it reached 170, but the end product was still fantastic.

This ice cream is exceptional. I now realize that it's the reason I've been allowing my ice cream maker to occupy so much space in my kitchen cupboards all of these years: it's delicious, it looks fantastic, and the texture is wonderful. Even my husband, who gets uncomfortable with any ice cream that strays from straight vanilla or chocolate, and who generally spurns the whole idea of fork ratings (there's too much fork inflation for him) gave it a four fork rating. I did make two changes, however - I used only one cup of cream (and substituted half and half for the remainder) and it was still luscious, and I undid any calorie savings by adding chopped 70% chocolate at the end of the churning. Fabulous.

This is delicious. One of the more unusual flavors of ice cream I've attempted and it was terrific. Try it served with chocolate pound cake or just sprinkled with toasted almonds.

Fabulous! The custard can be a bit tricky to time, and I think the significant amount of time to cool between stages should be stated up-front in the recipe. I served this with broiled nectarine halves (honey & lemon) and crushed gingersnaps. It was insane and met rave reviews!

This is definitely one of the best ice creams I have ever had. Perfectly creamy and smooth, wonderful flavor. I think I'll be making a second batch before too long.
