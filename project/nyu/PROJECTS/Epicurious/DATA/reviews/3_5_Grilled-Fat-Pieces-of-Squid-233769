Got some big, thick calamari and just threw them on the grill as is, and was careful not to overcook. That's the key to good calamari, and the great thing is because they cook so fast this is a very quick recipe. The sauce is amazing. Added another 1/2 lime, additional soy and a little more honey. Could have needed the extras as was out of sambal and used some Trinidadian pepper sauce instead and even by using 2T instead of 3, it was intense and I love heat.

The sauce is fantastic - we made it again to pour over shrimp and rice! The cooking times are for large thick squid.

Good, although a bit much work for what you get. I will definitely make this again, but will probably broil vs. grill/grill pan. Also, you do NOT need 2 minutes per side. I went with the recipe and the squid was overcooked. Probably cut the time in half. Agree that the sauce is awesome!

The sauce was wonderful. However, the squid my father-in-law caught was too salty so we ate the sauce with rice. I will try it again with fish or more squid (not from the father-in-law).

Way too much trouble for what it is. Scoring the squid was a big pain. Sauce was good, though. I might use it for something else.

Wonderful. I made the squid in a cast iron pan for 30-60 seconds (until they start curling). Then poured the squid and broth in a bowl, added sauce and enjoyed the Thai calmari soup

This is wonderful. I used calamari steaks (Trader Joe's frozen fish section). They were thick...just under 1/2"...so I grilled them on my George Foreman Grill for about 2 minutes and used the sauce as a dipping sauce. Awesome!! As you can tell from the ingredients, the sauce is HOT but it's a wonderful combination of sweetness and heat. I served with steamed jasmine rice (recipe on this site) and stir-fried vegetables. Dinner was on the table in 15 minutes and it looked elegant.
