Very tasty, with a wonderful texture. Agreed that the recipe needs to double the vinaigrette ingredient measures. I served the vinaigrette over spaghetti pasta. I could not find fresh marjoram (both Farm Boy and Metro [in Ottawa] have stopped carrying this), so I used dried leaves with a single tablespoon measure (instead of 2.5 tbsp fresh), and this worked very well. Will definitely make this again!

I thought this was a great, simple to make weeknight dinner. I added orange peel and a little bit of crushed red pepper to the breading, which provided a little depth to the flavor. I also squeezed some lemon over it when serving, which brightened it up nicely.

Mmmmmmmmmmmm! This was tasty, and incredibly quick and easy. Was quickly gobbled up by three teenage boys.

Very easy and delicious! I used herbes de Provence (no marjoram in the pantry) and it worked just fine. I probably didn't use enough parmesan but it didn't matter. I served it with roasted fingerling potatoes with white truffle oil and we ate every bite. As other reviewers have noted, you really do not need as much of the panko coating, and do double the amount of vinaigrette. It's a somewhat subtle meal but really very good.

This is great ! I, too, baked it and it turned out perfect ! I have made it several times..it's easy and delicious.

Tasty; I put it on top of pasta and then smothered it in sauce. That's just how I always ate it as a kid. My one note: make sure you don't use too much oil, or the crust will be kind of drippy and taste more like fast food than it should.

Wonderful. Definitely double the vinaigrette.

Instead of pan-frying, I opted to bake the chicken in 375F for 30-45 minutes. They came out pretty decent.

Wonderful flavors if you can get the chicken to a slightly crispy crust but still moist inside. To do so, I use the smallest free range breasts I can find, then cut horizontally, creating very thin cutlets. I also keep the panko and cheese separate, first applying the panko, then dip in egg, then cover with cheese into hot oil. Instead of olive oil, I use a good peanut oil which has a higher burn point; it's best to flash fry these. If possible, go straight to the plate. Keeping warm in low temp oven or covered with foil loses crispy outer. Finally, double the oil and vinegar at the end and add a tablespoon plus teaspoon of a good French dijon such as Maille. Use lots of arugula in your baby greens mix with a crusty baguette and this dish can be very satisfying.

Great weeknight meal. Quick, easy, flavorful.

I only made the chicken to put on top of mushroom risotto - parmesan theme, you know. Was really good and dead easy. I realized I didn't have any breadcrumbs so I made a piece of well done white toast and fine-grated it. Worked like a charm and using the grater means I don't dirty up a blender or food processor.

Rather than serving over greens, I topped the parmesan chicken with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese and broiled for a few minutes, and served with penne & sauce and asparagus. Big hit!

Fussy hard to please husband and daughter loved this dish! Of course I did too and that's what really matters:) It was very simple and quick -- good for a weeknight meal. I served with a crusty bread, roasted new potatoes and steamed cauliflower. Nummy.

I made a wonderful variation. I used the 'panko' mixture (except I used Progresso bread crumbs) and cooked it and then I sprayed a 9x13 pan with Pam, added the cooked chicken breasts, poured tomato sauce (1 can tomato sauce, garlic and Italian seasoning to taste) and loaded with Mozzarella and baked in a 350 oven until heated and cheese melted. It was divine. Flattening the chicken breasts is key.

Not bad, but nothing to scream about. I wouldn't serve this to guests unless it was a very impromptu gathering. As another reviewer said, no "wow" effect here.

Excellent recipe. I made this for my best friend and her husband and they wanted seconds. I need to figure out how to double the recipe so that I can cook it for my whole family.

excellent! Made this for big Xmas dinner and these went faster than the Beef Wellington or the Pasta with Lobster! Everyone raved. Couldn't find Panko, so used regular breadcrumbs-can't wait to try with Panko, as they're supposedly larger and flakier--yum!

this recipe is very simple and comes out better than most quick-fry chicken recipes i have tried. instead of frying the 1/2-breasts, i cut them into strips and laid them across the greens, maintaining more manageable portions.

Really easy to make + satisfying.. served with garlic roasted red potatoes.

Excellent, and easy to make, and nicely accompanied by garlic-basil mashed potatoes. I did have to cook the chicken longer than was prescribed, however.

This was a really nice meal. Good for a weeknight, but also for a casual get-together. I made the chicken and accompanied it with the suggested broccoli and then basil-garlic mashed potatoes, instead of roasted potatoes. It complimented the chicken well. For the white wine vinegar, I suggest a high quality kind because it really gives the baby greens a kick. I'd definetely make it again, everyone liked it.

This recipe was delicious! Instead of baby greens I used baby spinach. I only wish i would have doubled the vinegarette recipe.

I only made the chicken portion of the recipe, as I was using it for chicken parmigiana. It was wonderful. I found that my chicken needed a tad longer to cook, though - maybe I didn't pound it thin enough.

This is a simple, flavorful recipe that can be combined with many side dishes. The kids loved it.

This was a great dish and very easy to make! I only wish I'd read the review from Chicago (or receipe more clearly) and made sure to reduce the heat b/f adding the vinegar & oil - big mess!!!

This was very easy and straightforward. Very nice paired with parmesan couscous.

Easy and delicious weekday meal. Very important to reduce heat to medium and cool skillet slightly before making the vinaigrette, since there is only a small amount of vinegar and olive oil being added to the skillet. I took the serving suggestion and made steamed broccoli and roasted potatoes to go with this.

Wow! Chicken was moist and the parmesan cheese/breadcrumb crust was very tasty! I served the suggested roasted potatoes and steamed brocolli- a great weeknight meal!

This recipe great and easy to make. My boyfriend loved it, and I now make it with out the baby greens as a great chicken dish.

This is easy to make and very tasty. It's an intersting mix of comfort food (the breaded chicken) and spa cuisine (baby greens & vinaigrette). I served it with roasted baby red potatoes and steamed broccoli, just as suggested. The whole meal took about 2 hrs to prepare, including one hour just to boil and roast the potatoes. If you leave out the spuds it could easily be prepared in one hour or less.
