This is a favorite for the kids. I made a few changes to an already great recipe. I add a tablespoon or 2 of cinnamon to the dry ingredients. I add a tablespoon of Vanilla to the wet ingredients. I also add zest from two or three oranges, and a teaspoon or two of orange extract. For the flour, I go two cups white, 2.5 - 3 cups wheat and half a cup or so of Ground flax seed. I substitute Craisins for the raisins. I use only 1 cup of white sugar and 1.5 cups of brown. I only cook for around 15 minutes, and yes, I do end up with a cookie dough center, but I think that's what keeps the kids coming back. We actually pass these off as dessert. As they aren't baked through, store them in the fridge. For the wet ingredients, order matters. Put the buttermilk in after everything else is mixed well; your butter wont give you problems that way. On the raisin bran, I dont crush the flakes, so the contribution to the recipe is minimal. Im often tempted to just omit them. Should I be crushing them? As you might guess from my changes, this is not an exacting recipe. I eyeball most everything with no adverse consequences. If baked immediately, the Grapenuts will be crunchy. If you wait a day, they will disappear. Enjoy!

I have used this recipe ~ or one very similar ... for years and it is undoubtedly one of my family's favorites. I love the simplicity of making it ahead of time and serving up a batch of fresh warm muffins in a moments notice ... a few times over a 10 day period. Great company breakfast addition with fruit and yogurt. I omit the raisins and add 1 cup chopped pecans or walnuts, 2 cups chopped dates (these are a must, they literally melt inside the muffin) and 2 heaping cups of fresh blueberries. Delicious!

GOOD RECIPE!

These are very good but very heavy. I've made them a few times but the recipe also yeilds a lot that tend to sit in the freezer too long. I use it for when I may have a gang for breakfast, which is not that often.

Good recipe, but I shouldn't have listened to other reviewers who suggested fulling muffin tin cups to the top; I ended up with a muffin explosion in the pan, and had to take them out mid-baking to scoop excess batter from the cups. What a mess! Stick to the recipe, and they'll turn out great.

I loved this recipe. I also doubled the amount or raisins and added cinnamon and 2 granny smith apples. I also added maple syrup and agave nectar as I had no vanilla as others recommended. I used 3 cups of unbleached white whole wheat flour.

To Native Tree... Buttermilk has less fat percentage than 2% milk.

I've made this recipe 3 times now. Ready for the more healthy version? I used whole wheat flour for all the flour,Kashi go-lean for the bran cereal,raisin nut bran for the raisin bran, 2% milk (shaken) instead of the buttermilk, and splenda's brown sugar blend for the brown sugar. I added 1 teaspoon vanilla and cinnamon, twice the raisins, and 2 granny smith apples chopped into chunks.Didn't require any adjustments in cooking time.Fill the muffin cup up to the very top and then some...they are very dense and do not rise very much at all.These things are great.

A hearty dense muffin with things to chew on. Love it! Have no idea how anyone can make more than 30 muffins with this recipe.(Maybe muffin tops?) If u make large size muffins, cook at least 10-12 minutes longer. Each muffin yields about 4 raisins. Add more

a wonderful muffin recipe for breakfast. muffins come out moist and dense. to make them more healthy, i sub all flour for whole oat flour. sub bran cereal for oat bran. sub butter for equal amounts of unsweetened applesauce. sub granulated sugar for turbinado sugar. when baking, add 5 extra minutes and fill muffin cup because they dont rise very much. the full recipe produces 48 normal-sized muffins. with those modifications there is 1.5g fat, 26g carb, 3.5g protein, and 7.5% dietary fiber per muffin. dark rum makes an interesting substitute for vanilla, add to taste.

Good but not great bran muffin recipe. Definitely benefitted by some vanilla extract and cinnamon, as suggested by other reviewers. Use standard -- not non-stick -- muffin tin. The muffins tend to burn on the bottoms in a non-stick pan. Rises very little. If you want a standard size muffin, make sure you fill your tins up to the rim. Requires about 10 minutes more cooking time than the recipe calls for.

This recipe was absolutely the best. I agree it needs more raisins and I added extra dried orange cranberries along with some chopped walnuts. Also, vanilla and cinnamon are needed. Other than those few additions, it will replace all my other bran muffin recipes. I also loved the four cereals in the recipe. Yummy!

Scrumptious little muffins! I added 3 teaspoons of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (suggested in a previous review) and love it! Perfect breakfast too, if you are pregnant - these muffins have a heaping dose of Folic Acid! These remind me of muffins that my mother used to make during Christmas. Will definetly make again!

Great for the freezer! I had one for breakfast everyday for 3 weeks!

These are great. Did anyone have trouble keeping the cooled melted butter from coagulating when you added it to the buttermilk mixture?

I just pulled the first muffin tray out of the oven, and these are yummy! I added extra raisins, as one cup did not seem like enough for that gigantic amount of batter. I also added a splash of vanilla and dash of cinnamon, as suggested. Two other things: first, this makes an enormous amount of batter. Be prepared with a huge mixing bowl or perhaps cut the recipe in half. But at 1/3 C batter per muffin, I think it will make about 36 muffins as a full recipe. Secondly, I had to cook mine way more than 17-20 minutes. They were still wet and gooey at 25, and my oven is pretty standard. I checked early due to the "dry" comments of others and kept checking and checking until maybe 40 mminutes had gone by. I wonder what I did differently than the others...So just check early and often, I guess.

I love this recipe. I have made this recipe many times already. I added 3 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1 tsp. ground cloves, 2 tsp. vanilla extract, and substituted cranraisins for the raisins. My friends say this is the best bran muffin recipe they have ever tasted. Moist and delicious! The only thing is that I can only get 30 muffins from this recipe--not 60, but that is OK! I'll just have to make it more often.

These muffins are very good hot right out of the oven. I think next batch I will add some blueberries or pinapple juice to add some different flavors in them. We added a little bit of applesauce to keep it moist.

This is a first. We did not enjoy these as they were very dry and a little like eating cardboard, with not much flavor to give them merit. there are many other good muffin recipes and you won't be stuck with boxes of cereal left over. Sorry.

I've been looking for a muffin recipe that would hold me over until lunchtime, and this may be it. These muffins had great flavor, but were a little dry. Next time I'll try a bit more buttermilk and stay on the lower end of the baking time. I'll definately make then again, though.

These muffins are very light, despite all the ingredients which would lend you to expect them to be quite dense. They are wonderful! These will become a mainstay in my household and replace the boring Raisin Bran muffin recipe we used in the past. Definitely try them & don't change a thing...the recipe is perfect as is.
