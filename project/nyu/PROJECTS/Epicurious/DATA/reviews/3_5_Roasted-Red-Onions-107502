Excellent with Prime Rib. I halved the recipe and it turned out fine. Use a non-stick pan/baking sheet so the onions can crisp.

This was a delicious accompaniment to a standing rib roast I made for Christmas. We had leftovers which were delicious when stirred into mashed potatoes the next day.

Made this as an easy side dish to accompany many other sides. Was a very nice addition. I used Red Onions which gave it a nice sweetness.

When I read the post that said the onion odor lingered I thought - no problem, I love onions. Well, the smell permeated every room (even ones with doors shut!!) and stayed around for days. But loved the flavor of this dish. Next time I'll wait til I can open windows. Also will try harder to find smaller onions. I used ones that were very large (all I could find) and they lost their shape and were very unattractive on the plate.

Wow! Of the four recipes that I made for our Christmas dinner, this one got the best feedback. Who would have thought that roasted red onions would be so tasty? This is an easy recipe that, although it takes a long time to prepare, the fact that you can cook it up to a day before serving makes it a "must" in my book. Yum.

OH, how wonderful this beef is - I made this for my first Christmas dinner, and we are still talking about it. I've even had requests for this Easter dinner! This has to be the best entree that I've ever made. Beautiful!

Loved the onions! Make this for Christmas dinner, and it went perfectly with the Beef Tenderloin. A great accompaniment. ONE CAUTION: I mistakenly followed the directions without thinking and burned the onions. I roasted them the first 20 minutes, switched the pan for 15 (not 20) minutes and when it was time to turn them, found them a bit charred. Next time, I'll roast for 20 minutes then turn them. Wonderful flavor. Very easy. Make sure you don't include/cook the thin, papery outside onion layer...it gets too crisp.

Excellent accompaniment for a holiday rib roast! I added shallots and garlic, and the combination was superb. Next time I will decrease the butter a bit. I served the roasted onions surrounded by roasted green beans and carrots seasoned with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, oregano and thyme. It made for a lovely presentation and the flavors complemented one another nicely.

Delicious and Easy! Just learned something last night for all of those who have yet to hear the secret: Chew gum while cutting onions to avoid crying! It totally worked! I feel like so many doors have just opened for me...I used to avoid cooking with onions due to being incredibly sensitive to them...Amazing!

These onions were great. I made them for Christmas Eve dinner and everyone loved them. A really easy side dish if you love onions.

The one thing about this recipe is that the home will have the lingering aroma of onion for some time. If you love onions yoou'll be in heaven if not well more does not need to be said. The covering of the onions allows for carmelization with out actual burning and drying out. Wonderful taste.
