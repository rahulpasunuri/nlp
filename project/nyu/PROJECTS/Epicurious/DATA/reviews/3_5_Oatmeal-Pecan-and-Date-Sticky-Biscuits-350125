These were delicious. I would definitely make them again. I didn't think they were too sweet as the biscuit dough balanced out the sweetness of the syrup.

These are very good, definitely not as horrifyingly sweet as they look, though I would cut down the sugar next time. I admit I would prefer a yeast dough and next time will try the oatmeal dough we usually use for cinnamon rolls.

I loved these. Yes, they are sweet - but the biscuit dough is not as sweet as a typical sweet roll is, so they aren't completely over-the-top. I think the dates are really good in here - but just dice them small if you have people who don't think they like dates! They won't recognize them. The syrup topping ended up being VERY sticky. I will try making these the night before next time - it was time consuming to get them on the table for breakfast on Thanksgiving.

I used instant biscuit mix which was easier, and worked well, and used raisins instead of dates. These are a good, fast fill in for a pecan roll.

Delicious. Very rich, and very sweet. I would recommend dicing the dates very finely and reducing the sugar to a couple of Tbsp in the date-sugar-cinnamon mixture (which calls for 1/3 cup), as they were totally over-the-top sweet as written - the dates are very sweet and the syrup is intensely so. But not in a bad way. In a delicious way. Maybe just a bit too much...

Excellent - I used substituted light brown sugar for half of the dark brown sugar and used chopped pecans instead of dates in the filling. This cooked in 30 minutes. I made this the night before and brought to room temp before baking.
