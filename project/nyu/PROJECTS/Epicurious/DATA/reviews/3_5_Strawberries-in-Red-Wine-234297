Saw Jose Andres make this today. Rather than lemon juice he grated lemon zest over and dusted with black pepper

These were really quite good. I used a fruity Zinfandel and the entire 1/2 cup of sugar and they tasted great. Next time will add some raspberries and a dollop of whipped cream.

I made these in an effort to jazz up ordinary strawberries and make them more appealing as a dessert. This recipe did not dissapoint - there were no leftovers and everyone raved about the wonderful flavor.

I have made this twice, the first time for last-minute dinner guests using the VERY ripe strawberries that were not going to survive another day in my fridge. The results were wonderful and I couldn't wait to make it again. Both times I followed the recipe exactly and using an inexpensive Zinfandel. I wouldn't change a thing, except maybe to add peaches next time as one reviewer suggested. This one goes in my permanent repertoire!

Wonderful tasting, simple and gourmet. I don't think anyone could ask for more. My guests were more than impressed - they asked me for the recipe. I gave it to them and they really couldn't believe it - in fact they didn't even think there was wine in there at all. For that effect, I do think that the 1/2 cup sugar is necessary - though I added it to more like 3/4 cup wine. I added some fresh basil leaves (though, I suppose you could also add a few mint leaves too) and let it all marinate - the wine section only - for a few hours. I had all the strawberries washed and cut, and so when the guests arrived I just plopped them into the marinate. I served it over some traditional thick Greek yoghurt and it was FANTASTIC. Definately making this one again.

I agree with the cook from N.C.--1/2 cup of sugar is WAY too sweet. 1/4 or even less is more than enough if you want to be able to taste the berries. My family is from Spain, and this is a very common summer dessert there, usually served with nata (fresh whipped cream).

This is so easy and festive! Everyone loves it! I also add peaches when they are in season.

A quick, light, and sophisticated dessert when strawberries are in abundance. Looks particularly pretty served in chilled wine or martini glasses. 1/2 cup sugar sounds very sweet. I rarely use more than a few tablespoons (1/4 cup or less) even for slightly tart berries. But I guess that's why the "to taste" is in the recipe. Anyway, this is a Spring and Summer staple around our house, either plain, or on yogurt, ice cream, pound or angel food cake, etc.
