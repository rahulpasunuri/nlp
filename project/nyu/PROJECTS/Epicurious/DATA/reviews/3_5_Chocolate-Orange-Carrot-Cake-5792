This is not a carrot cake. This is a chocolate cake. I thought, mistakenly, that this would be more carroty and even though I substituted the coconut with carrot it wasn't. Its not a bad recipe though and the cake came out moist. (I substituted mandarin juice for the canned stuff)

note to self and any others.... this should not be made in one tin (I didn't have two). However mashing the part of the cake that didn't remove nicely from the tin into the hole and covering in icing seems to have done the trick! I also halved the coconut and used fresh orange juice not frozen concentrate. And fresh orange pulp instead of tinned fruit. Has a very strong mix of flavours which are already a favourite.

Ive been making this cake for a number of years and continue to get requests for it. I have always excluded the fruit chunks from this one and think it helps to maintain the moisture. Also, for sake of the frosting, youre best using a butter and creamcheese (1:2 parts respectively) with grand man for flavor and an additional 40oz quality white chocolate melted.

A really lovely cake. I added an extra cup of carrots, used fresh clementines, and used grand marnier in the icing, rather than orange concentrate, and it came out with a very nice flavor. Next time, I'll probably double the amount of oranges in the cake, because I couldn't really taste them; I might also add some grand marnier to cake itself.

Just OK. Chunks of mandarin were weird. Not a particularly moist cake either

This didn't knock my socks off on first tasting, but it was even better with age (2d old leftovers in the fridge), was phenomenal. I think the ganache-like frosting MAKES this. I listened to others' advice and eliminated the coconut and upped the amt of carrot by 1c. VERY NICE.

I made this cake for an office birthday and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. My coworker's husband declared it his new birthday cake. The only change I made was to use butter instead of the non dairy margerine. I would like to post a photo of the cake; it would have helped me know what to expect, as the "frosting" is more of a ganache than a spread.

One of the best chocolate cakes that ive ever made...the cake by itself had a complex taste...but the icing was amaaazing.its had the orange flavour that was pronounced..the nxt time i make it,i would omit the coconut,add some more mandarin oranges and perhaps some orange extract..the icing doesnt need any changes..its PERFECT!!!

Besides tasting great, is very easy to make, my teenage girls made it without a problem, and they know basic cooking. Made it 4 times in 2 weeks. Each time it turned out better.

I agree with starrdragon in every respect. I'd like to add, it is simple to make and the frosting sets perfectly. If I make it again, I might use some orange marmalade or something similar in the filling. For my taste the orange accent was not strong enough.

Also used 3 C of carrots, no coconut. Used fresh clementines instead of mandarine oranges. People raved over this cake, and all wanted the recipe!

Ditto on the 3 cups carrots and no coconut. I am not overly fond of oranges, so used lemon zest and 1/2 cup of lemon marmalade mixed in to the batter (mix well). The icing turned out great with double the sugar and two TBS fresh lemon juice + two TBS coconut rum. A complex, rich, and very satisfying cake.

I made this cake with the 3 cups of carrots, 1 cup unsalted butter, and cointreau in the frosting, for a carrot cake enthusiast and her response was "this is the best cake EVER" I thought the frosting was a little too light for the cake and while I would make this again I would make the cake lighter rather than the frosting thicker. this cake is excellent!

I made this cake for a birthday and it was a hit. The carrots and coconut add a wonderful texture and keep the cake moist and delicious. At the same time, the cake has a rich chocolate flavor that should satisfy the pickiest of chocolate eaters. Some notes on the ingredients - like other reviewers, I used 3 cups of carrots. Also, 2 1/2 cups of chocolate chips yielded too much frosting, so I had a lot left over - it may be worth cutting down to 2 cups.

I make a cake for my husband's birthday every year and he says, "This is the best cake I've ever put in my mouth!" I think that's an exaggeration, but it IS a very good cake. It's dense and moist at the same time. It tastes chocolately and complex; doesn't take like carrot cake, but still has the carrot cake texture. The frosting is perfect -- rich, but not overly sweet. You should try it! It's a unique cake. Here's what I did differently, thanks to the advice of previous posters: 3 cups of carrots (instead of 2) Regular unsalted butter (instead of margarine) Cointreau (instead of oranje juice concentrate) Shaved white chocolate (instead of oranges) for decoration ...and I used Ghirardelli chocoalte chips Enjoy!

Wonderful cake! I used a can of drained crushed pineapple instead of the mandarins, and agree that the texture is complex, but think it is great. It freezes well, too.

Good cake, just I would not call it a carrot cake. Tastes like a fluffy, but not fudgy brownie.

As another reader said, not having temperatures in Centrigrade can be a big problem. I put this in at 175 on the top shelf and had a major problem -I could smell the smoke coming out of the ovenb after 20 minutes - it was obviously totally uncooked at the bottom and buring on top! (and I thought this roughly translated in F). After covering with foil and totally turning the oven temp down, it then took over an hour. I also had a major problem getting it out of the tin -it broke and left large lumps on the bottom.The taste was however good. I didnt put in the coconut so this was probably less sweet than the recipe but was fine. The carrot totally disappeared so a good way of getting carrot into children.

Unusual, rich, and delicious cake. The frosting was a bit runny when I started to frost the cake, but I let it sit and it got to the right consistency quickly. My husband has announced that this is his birthday cake from now on.

I made this recipe as written except used a cream cheese frosting with a orange zest on top instead of the chococlate. It was fantastic as well as beautiful and everyone said they wouldn't change a thing! I think crushed pineapple in place of the mandarin oranges would be fine as the flavor doesn't come through so much as it adds moisture and texture.

I especially liked the frosting for this cake. I think the cake itself could definitely use more orange flavor. Interesting texture, not too rich. Overall very good.

Wow, if you're sick of those "healthy" tasting carrot cakes (though we know what a misconception that is), here's a twist on one! Very, very yummy...and plenty chocolately without being too sweet. I was a little concerned when my "batter" was actually crumbly rather than thick. I don't know what caused this to happen as I followed the directions/measurements exatly. At any rate, I added probably 1/4 - 1/2 cup of milk to get to the "thick batter" stage and continued on my way. I also went with the more "classic" frosting of cream cheese/butter/confectioner's sugar. I added a couple of tbsp of orange juice concentrate to give it some color and orange flavor. I imagine that orange zest or extract would punch it up even more.

Rating: 2
I thought it was pretty dense not at all reminiscent of a cake. The texture was complex (it even looked complex). What I thought most odd was that it didn't smell at all while it was baking -- other than, maybe, of oil. The frosting tasted great and had a very reliable consistency. I made 4 cakes for a party (including this one) and this one was the least sampled. I might make it again, in case I did something wrong, b/c the combination sure seems like it should work out.

My husband loves carrot cake. I love chocolate. This is the perfect birthday cake to please us both. I used cream cheese frosting instead with a hint of orange extract in the batter. He had a huge slice last night and finished it off just two days after his b-day!

A good departure from your usual carrot cake! Chocolate and orange are one of my all time favorite combinations so this cake was a big hit with all. The moist,dense chewy texture was very pleasing. Some adjustments that I made was to omit the coconut, (not my fave) and add 1c. of crushed pineapple to the batter. To accentuate more of the orange flavor I used 1 t. of orange extract in the batter. I opted to use 4 ozs. each of butter and cream cheese and 1 heaping tablespoon of Grand Marnier for the chocolate frosting. It's was very spreadable and easy to work with. Topped with white chocolate shavings. Allow the cake come up to room temp before serving.

I LOVED this cake! The combination of chocolate and orange make this cake incredible!! I opted not to make the frosting and it was still delicious. I did however put 1 tsp of baking soda instead of 2 (by mistake), and it came out like a rich brownie!!! YUMMY!!!

I made this cake (the first I've made in 24 !!!! years) for a combination Christmas gathering/birthday party for a group of women who are discerning and demanding about both their chocolate and their carrot cake. They loved this. I changed nothing, except put in 1/4 c. less sugar, used unsweetened coconut and used butter/cream cheese (1/2 c. each) for the icing. And Cointreau instead of OJ. OK, so that's quite a few changes. But this is a GREAT CAKE.

I was hoping for the best of the best after reading everyone's reviews. I made the recipe exactly as stated even with the pareve margerine, and I always use butter. I did make it in a 9 x 13 pan. No one seemed impressed. It was just very different. I guess you have to be someone who likes chocolate and oranges together. I might try sometime with the chocolate cream cheese from Joy of Cooking as suggested by others. Maybe that would make a difference. Just being honest.

Yum! This is a great cake - although I didn't exactly follow the recipe, I 'vegan-ized' it (substituted out the eggs). No one could guess what the 'secret ingredient' was. No problems with the super-thick batter. Think I'll add more carrot next time.

Rating: 4
Previous reviewers are right, this is a chocoholics cake, with some redeeming values. I took various suggestions: 3 cups of grated carrots, added 1 cup chopped pecans, used 2 T Gran Marnier instead of the orange juice in the frosting, and used 2/3 cup of powdered sugar and 1 stick butter and 5 oz cream cheese in the frosting. I had only 1 1/2 inch deep cake pans, and it worked "OK". 2 inch would be better, but not a big deal as it only went over a little bit. I have a powerful Kitchenaid mixer so the batter was not a problem for me.

Rating: 4
This cake rocks. If you want to be the hero, bake this. Few comments: all the talk about the batter being thick is accurate (my beater was fine though). The frosting was great, especially if you like the orange/chocolate combination. Next time I plan to use Ghiradelli chocolate and increase the amount of cocunut by 1/2 cup. Don't think I would add walnuts, another texture just isn't necessary. To sum up, this is the best cake I've ever made.

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST...VERY MOIST AND FLAVORFUL! I highly recommend the recipe's original frosting. The first time I made it as a bunny cake and used cream cheese frosting (sprinkled with coconut for fur) - not good. This time I made it with the chocolate-orange frosting and it was INCREDIBLE. FYI: It came out perfect with 3 cups of carrot as in a similar recipe, and regular unsalted butter for frosting.

Substituted one cup whole wheat pastry flour for the all purpose flour, used two cups sugar instead of 2 1/4, used unsweetened coconut and used fresh mandarine oranges instead of canned to make the recipe a little healthier - was very happy with the results (and omitted the frosting entirely).

A most unusual carrot and/or chocolate cake!If you like the combination of chocolate and oranges, you'll find this delicious! My variation on icing: 2 8oz pkgs cream cheese, 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1 med. jar orange marmalade. It would be yummy with chocolate cream cheese icing, as well.

Cake was moist. Don't be afraid of the thick batter - it loosens with the coconut, carrots, and oranges. Was disapointed with the frosting. The orange juice overpowered the other flafors in the cake. I'd leave it out or choose another frosting. It also took much longer than 40 min to bake, fyi.

Easy to make, though a heavy duty mixer is very helpful. I made this for the first time for a dinner party and everyone loved it. The cake has a great combination of flavors and is super moist. I mis-read the recipe and put in two cups of coconut. It was delicious. Used chocolate cream cheese frosting and thought it was a perfect complement.

This is one of my favorite cakes. I have made it at least twice, and got great reviews for it. The second time I even got a prize at a cooking contest among a group of friends. True, it is very hard on your mixer, I nearly burned out mine. It's not an easy recipe, but well worth the effort. The orange flavor is fabulous.

Rating: 4
I took the advice of not burning out my mixer and did it all by hand. I used the hugest bowl I had and it was still too small! I oiled my cake pans instead of using spray and the cake stuck horribly, and also cracked apart. But that was the only problem. This cake was black with chocolate. The best thing about it was the texture -- unlike anything I had ever had -- the closest description is like a macaroon - moist, crumbly, due to the coconut. Very intriguing! I was afraid to use the orange juice concentrate due to past reviews and used Triple Sec which was what I had - but there was little orange flavor at all -- but it was still great. For the frosting I used half neufchatel and half sweet butter. The frosting was the other fantastic thing about this cake. I would definitely not call this cake easy! It's time consuming, but it is very special...incredibly yummy.

Made this for a co-worker's 50th birthday party...it was easy but I thought it wasn't anything to brag about...the cake was very heavy and rich...however I did get lots of raves and the recipe asked for...but have had much better carrot cake recipes and probably won't make this one again.

It is a wonderful cake. To avoid the thickness problem do not use an electric mixer you will get a better results with a wooden spoon. Instead of the orange juice try Grand Marnier and use the best quality choclate you have available. It is Amazing!

I made this cake on the spur of the moment, I didn't have tin mandarins, so I used fresh ones. As one cook said, be prepared with the thickness of the batter. If I had a concrete mixer I would have used it. The flavour of the cake was unbelievable, the texture like fudge and the chocolate frosting was just magic - leave out the orange juice, it didn't need it. I will definetely make this again.

I've made many cakes, and this is my all time favorite! The texture is wonderfully complex and the cake is moist and chocolatey. I opted to make a chocolate cream cheese frosting (forget the oj) and added freshly grated orange rind...you won't be disappointed!! Be sure to use the best quality chocolate you can find, Valhrona cocoa powder and chocolate are a worthwhile splurge, and makes all the difference.

This was an incredibly lucious cake, but when they say thick prepare yourself!-we blew the motor on our mixer. I think the icing was rich(we used the cream cheese someone suggested) I would lighten it a little and perhaps use a liquor to flavor it instead of oj. Altogether wonderful though and would make it again

This cake I baked for my fortieth birthday was a big hit. I substituted the magarine for cream cheese.I used 2-10 ounce cans divided to make 11 ounces of canned mandarins for the batter and I dried the rest rest to use to decorate the cake. Decadent chocolate and orange combination!

Is very, very rich. For chocoholics, make it just the way the recipe says. The second time around I cut the cocoa to 1/2 cp and added some walnuts. I used cream cheese instead of butter and regular orange juice for the frosting. I think it's better this way, but diehard chocoholics (you know who you are) may disagree.

The texture of this cake is wonderful, it's really dense and chocolatey. The cake seems pretty fool proof. It bakes level, so it looks nice when frosted. I used half butter and half cream cheese instead of the margarine in the frosting, and increased the powdered sugar to 1 cup. When making this again, I will omit the orange juice concentrate from the frosting because the flavor seemed strange. Maybe orange oil or zest would give a better flavor, or better yet, some Gran Marnier.

What an amazing cake! I am no pastry chef, but this recipe was easy, tastes amazing, and will stun yourself and your party guests. I like to add twice as many mandarin oranges. I also discovered by my impatience to wait for the frosting to set that the cake was even more delicious with the warm orange-chocolate sauce (i.e., the unset frosting).

I made this cake for company and I still receive compliments weeks after the party. What I like most about this cake is the interplay between ingredients - the moist chocolate, the chewy carrots and coconut, the yummy, smooth and intense orange-chocolate icing. The recipe is special, but it isn't exotic or overly difficult to produce.
