it was ok. weird combo of flavors. i saved the pepperoncinis and bacon for an unrelated omelette, good that way.

As previous reviews indicated, this is a great weekday recipe. Different, easy and tasty. Will definitely make this one again. Adjust the spicyness by adding extra peperoncini.

This recipe is perfect for a mid-week meal. Simple to make and very tasty- serve with good crusty bread and a crisp green salad.

This is a great recipe! The pepperocini was a fabulous touch to give it that extra kick and slightly unusual flavor. Easy to make too! Will definitely make again.

Enjoyed this dish,different than other pasta dishes. Not sure if I really liked the pepperoncini much, may just use red chili pepper flakes next time instead. Great with lots of parmesan. My husband liked it better the next day.

My husband and I loved this dish. It has a hearty bite to it. Serve with plenty of parmesan cheese. The next time I make it I will add shrimp for a more filling meal.

Sure did look like a good recipe. Other than the heat from the peppers, it was just like what Mom used to make for a quick meal. Brought back memories. Make again? If I need a quick meal, guess I would. But it's not one I'd HAVE to make again.

Did not care for at all, easy to prepare but did not enjoy at all.

What a marvelous easy pasta dish to put together. Nice bite to the sauce and the bacon gives it a tasty crunch. A real keeper, and so basic in taste and texture, unlike a lot of pasta dishes.

Great recipe. I realized at the last minute that I didn't have 2 cans of diced tomatoes, so I used 1 can of plain diced tomatoes and 1 can of diced tomatoes with roasted garlic. I went ahead and used the 4 cloves of garlic that the recipe called for anyway but didn't use particularly large ones. The result was really good. I'll definitely make it again. By the way, I think that this recipe makes way more than 4 servings...

Great dish for a summer evening and quick. Cooking the bacon and linguine took the longest - which wasn't that long. Will make again. With the colder weather approaching, next time I may try adding some grilled Italina sausages to the pot as I blend the flavors. I think that will give it more of a hearty flair.

The bacon added a nice flavor to the sauce and the pepperoncini added a nice zest to the sauce.

Wonderful, straight forward flavors that blend well together. Will definitely make this again! KIMBER

A real crowd pleaser! I made this recipe just for myself and my husband (as a trial), and we loved it. Then I made it for friends (with kids) during our recent vacation together, and everyone enjoyed it. Perhaps too spicy for small kids (5 and under), but my 10-year-old ate it all.

Great dish. Very light and refreshing. I didn't have a red onion but a yellow one worked great.

I always like to try out new dishes on my company. I did make the sauce the day before and rewarmed it, it tasted great. I just added the cheese before I put it over the linguine. There isn't a thing I would change.

This dish was extremely tasty. Most pasta dishes I make need additional spices to satisfy my tastebuds, but this one needed nothing! Very easy to make and a definate crowd pleaser.

Very good. A excellent "something different" receipe. I think next time I will add a little more bacon. I threw in a few "extra" peperoncini because we all love them. Definetly sticks to your ribs. Fresh parmesan next time as well. I will definetly cook this dish again!

my family loved this recipe!!!The peperoncini adds just a bit of spiciness. Maybe not for younger kids.
