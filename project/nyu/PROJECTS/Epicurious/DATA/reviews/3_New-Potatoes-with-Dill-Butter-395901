The main thing I liked about this dish was that it was simple. It was tasty as well, but it was not anything special. It made a nice addition to dinner. One thing I must mention, though, is when it comes time to mix the just boiled potatoes with the dill butter things can become a bit frustrating. Basically they don't mix, so what I would recommend doing is, as the recipe says, add a tablespoon of water. Then, maybe an additional teaspoon. After that you should cut up the potato, otherwise, the dill butter will not adhere to the potatoes and it just sits at the bottom.

I would prefer to steam the potatoes. Boiling could make the delicate skins peel off.

Just a comment. I started out thinking, "Why would one need a recipe for dill-butter new potatoes?" and came away saying, "Wow, that's a new technique, and I never thought about adding caraway seeds." Good job, Bon Appetit. I'll give it a try.

I have been preparing potatoes with butter and dill and they are always very nice, especially with guests. Do also try adding 1/2 of a teaspoon of lemon juice, plus a few tablespoons of natural fat free yogurt (do not melt it) and less butter. It makes a nice, quick sauce.
