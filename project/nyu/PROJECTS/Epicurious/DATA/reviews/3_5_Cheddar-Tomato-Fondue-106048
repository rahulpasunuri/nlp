This was very tasty. I followed the other reviewers' suggestions, and served it with French bread cubes, broccoli florets and boiled shrimp. Everyone loved it! I did add two dashes of hot sauce, and a tad more garlic and wine. We like our food well spiced!

I needed to add more wine as a finish to improve consistency and thin it out. Taste was great and the kids ate it with lightly steamed veggies. All good :)

I disagree with most of the comments...the more I ate, the less I liked it. The texture was off, and the taste was lacking. I wouldn't make this recipe again.

I have made this a few times, and it was enjoyed by everyone, even the males who are "Meat and Potatoes" lovers. Christmas Eve, I had Gruyere on hand and substituted it for the Cheddar, and it was fabulous - no burning, not as stringy - maybe that's why the more traditional recipes work. They really loved it this time!

Made this for a holiday party, and it turned out quite tasty. The only pitfall is that after I stuck a sterno under it, it started to burn--but that's my own fault. I'd definitely make again, without using a sterno. Per other reviewers, I added more garlic. A good, sharp cheddar is key--the packaged shredded stuff will not work for this.

Served it on Thanksgiving as a last minute extra app. and people really liked it. Sill, I prefer classic fondue.

I had 19 guests for a Fondue/Tupperware Party!! Unbelievable!! We had 3 types of fondues, I got one bite of this one, by scrapping the bottom. It needed exta wine, more garlic, and 2 dashes of Tabascoe Sauce. Mu husband and I just had it for Sun. dinner with boiled red potatoes, califlower, brocolli, grape tomatoes, and Como bread. Great!!!!!!!!

I didn't love this recipe. It wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked it to be. Perhaps I'll take a look at some of the embelishments that others used with this fondue and see if I like those, but all in all... it didn't wow me.

Very easy to make. Served with shrimp, bread and broccoli, my family loved it!

This recipe is absolutely delicious and so easy to make. My boyfriend and I make it for a casual dinner on Sundays and have also made it for parties with friends. Everyone raves about it. We like to serve with bread, broccoli, apples and pears.

This fondue was fantastic & was a great alternative to the usual Swiss-Gruyere style fondue. My guests & I loved every bite & it was wonderful with a big salad & French bread. I used a Black Wax Canadian Cheddar (white) and it turned out beautifully. Huge recommendation!

Fabulous, easy comfort food! Made it for Christmas supper, and will serve it New Year's Eve as well! Yummmm....

This is a nice change from the traditional- I think it worked great with bread and veggies. Adding beer makes a welsh rabbit really (as some mentioned below) but I think it is great as is. I left in the garlic for more punch. Great on a snow day!

Excellent with french bread or similar. Not a success with vegetables. The heat had to be low & steady else it burned or became lumpy very quickly.

Instead of Cheddar, I used 1/2 goat cheese and 1/2 emmenthal swiss with a fantastic outcome.

My guests could not stop eating this, good thing I doubled the recipe! I served with bread cubes and fried wonton wrappers. Excellent and so easy! A definite keeper.

I made this for a party of 20. I used a jar of chopped sundried tomatoes instead of canned, and used beer instead of wine. Everyone raved it was the best they've ever had! Super easy!

This recipe was really tasty. Which surprised me despite the previous good reviews. It doesn't sound like what I usually like. The tomato addition seemed odd. But the end result was really tasty. I was prepared to add more wine if it was too thick but didn't need to. The consistency was perfect as is. I added a few dashes of Tabasco...well because I do that to just about everything. Other than that and mincing the garlic I followed the recipe. Quick, easy and really tasty. I served it with french bread cubes, pears and apples.

As everyone else has said, easy and good. Maximum results for minimal effort. I added more wine for consistency and felt that made up for the lack of a stronger flavor like kirsch. Used extra-sharp cheddar to give it extra flavor and a bit of pepper to taste. Also, I minced the garlic and left it in. Delicious!

Very good, but I made a few small changes... I smashed the garlic well and left it in. I added extra wine, because I thought it was too thick. We added some crumbled crispy bacon (YUM). Served it with bread chunks, steamed broccoli and cauliflower.

We served this with steamed broccoli and cauliflower florets. Yummy.

I just tried this fondue recipe today. I thought it was okay but way too clumpy. I followed the recipe as directed. If I make this again I will use more wine and stir in some kirsch as others have commented. I'm more fond of fondues that start with a basic white sauce then add the cheese.

very simple but yummy. A hit at our party. The herb croutons were gone in a flash with this one!

I got nothing but rave reviews from everyone at the party that I took this dish to. Not only was it delicious, but so simple to make. I did everything right in the fondue pot and it only took 15 minutes!! Loved it!!

Yum, yum! I loved this! Couldn't be better. I'll make it again and again!

I loved it!!! I liked it so much that I ate fondue the whole week (also, because I bought to much cheese and didn't want it waste away..) The first time I made the fondue I tried half of the recipe and I measured and mixed everything cautiously...by the fifth day of making fondue I mixed the ingredients to my taste...and it worked out pretty good. I used a bit more of wine...it gave it a great kick!!!

I made this for a casual dinner at home with my husband. Although we thought it was OK, it's just too blah for an entire dinner. This would be best as an appetizer or on a buffet.

Very good and very easy. I used sharp cheddar. Will make it again soon.
