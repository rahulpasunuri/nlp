Delightful, like sipping corn on the cob. We skipped the sour cream but used fresh lemon basil as a garni - that was a good idea - and served it at room temperature. A perfect first course for an August dinner in New England.

This soup is outstanding made exactly as written, but to my taste it was even more flavorful when served slightly warm, instead of fully chilled.

I thought this recipe was delicious. It has excellent corn flavor. Didn't think it was "bland" at all.

Followed recipe exactly and it turned out very bland. I added 1+ tsp soy sauce and 1/2 tsp. sesame oil to give it more depth and an asian twist. The soup turned out quite nice but my try to tweak further next time.

I thought this was delicious! True "essence of corn" soup; no jalapeno or curry required. Tastes like summer!

Actually, not even okay. Even with returning all the solids to the soup -- instead of throwing them out -- this was insipid. A lot of work for a disappointing result.

What was not to like about this? I just served it as an app for dinner and it was great! My kids and guests were calling it 'corn off the cob' soup. It's a great base for experimenting.

We loved this soup, but I added chopped jalapeno and some chipotle powder to the pot. I finished it with 3 T. of half and half, since I didn't have sour cream. Spicy and yummy.
