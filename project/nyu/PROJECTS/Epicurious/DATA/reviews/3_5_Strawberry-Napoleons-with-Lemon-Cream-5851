The lemon cream was very good. However I found it a bit sweet so I added more whipped cream to the mix to even out the sweetness & tartness. I also cut back the sugar when making the strawberry syrup. The natural sweetness of the fruit was enough ( I added only 1 Tablespoon). Lastly I added lemon rind to the cream mixture. Definite keeper with a few modifications.

I've made this dish many times and it is AMAZING!!! Although it is a bit time consuming, the results are well worth the effort. Just make sure to watch the phylo dough, it can burn easily. YUMMY! The lemon cream is so tasty with the strawberries! My mouth is watering already!

I made some modifications to this. I forgot to take the phyllo dough out of the freezer in time so I made individual tart shells (pie dough molded around the bottoms of a muffin pan and baked). I filled each baked tart shell with the lemon cream and fresh sliced strawberries. The lemon cream set up beautifully especially when allowed to set overnight. The only issue I had was the lemon cream was almost too overpowering in its lemon flavor. I would definitely cut back on the lemonade concentrate next time.

This one is amazing!! I love the lemon with the berry's. I even piped the extra lemon into strawberrys and served them on the side.

This recipe is a decent answer to a light summer dessert. Be forewarned that the dish will certainly make a mess of the kitchen, but your quests will enjoy it. You my wish to add lemond rind to the custard, refrain from using butter and sugar on the pastry dough, and reduce the sugar used in cooking down the berries.

My husband made this for a fourth of July cookout at our daughter's home. It was a great success. We are making it again for Easter, but are adding raspberries and blueberries also.

My daughter and I made this for easter the year it was first printed. It was our first attemppt at phyllo dough- which was less than perfect. The lemon cream however was soo wonderful, every time I want a lemony desert this is the first dessert to come to mind. We love this recipe, it has become a permant item in our recipe box with only one change, we use puff pastry instead of the phyllo- not for tast difference but for ease. I think for children involved the phyllo is too delicate to work with

I made this for a gourmet club and it was a bit hit, with a beautiful presentation. It was fairly time consuming, but worth it.

This was very good, but I thought that it was quite time consuming. I used purchased phyllo dough and had a tough time with it (but that was probably just me. My husband absolutely loved them though and I thought they were good. They keep very well also.
