This is one of my brother's and my all-time favorite cookie recipes. It's become a Christmas tradition in a family that already had a dozen different family tradition Christmas desserts. Somewhat difficult to make only because we can't ever fit an entire batch into our food processor (I do it in two or three batches), but once the dough is made... yum. For Christmas we use a star shape cookie cutter and sprinkle with red and green sugard.

I do not have a food processor so it took awhile to hand cut in the butter. I had to add a few Tablespoons of water to make the dough stick together. I really like ginger so if I made it again I would add more ginger.
