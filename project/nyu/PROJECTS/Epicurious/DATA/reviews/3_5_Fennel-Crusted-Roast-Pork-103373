This is a rather basic recipe for roast pork loin with gravy with no complexity, in my opinion. I'd rather have had the onions, balsamic vinegar, and fennel in the sauce. As is, the recipe has a very 50's style to me and is not worth the effort.

This is a fantastic recipe -- easy, quick, impressive and delicious. I've made this three times, and it's been flawless each time. Go by the meat's temperature to gauge doneness, and it'll be perfect. Pair with pinot noir, and serve with fennel risotto from this site as well as sauteed green beans with a touch of lemon.

Made this for small Christmas dinner (with wild mushromm gratineed potatoes and green beans with caramelized shallots from this site) -- a big hit! I don't think I sufficiently crushed my fennel seed, but even so, a nice note to the pork. Sauce is delicious -- don't omit the butter! Def make this again.

I made this dish according to the recipe. My family and I thought that this was exceptionally tasty. The fennel was strong to the nose, but really it blended right into the flavor. I am looking forward to making this again.

This dish is fantastic, I love the fennel taste, and it was not strong at all (and I'm not even a fan of licorice). The onions were very good too, I roasted them separately in a toaster oven but served them together, and it was a great hit.

Very simple, but very tasty (especially the pan sauce, to which I added one clove of garlic). I made sure to pull the roast out at 145 degrees, as recommended by another reviewer, and it was perfectly cooked. Served the onions with sauteed collards and roasted beets, which made a lovely warm 'salad' (the sweetness of the onions and beets contrasted beautifully with the slight bitterness of the greens).

Wonderful! We brined the tenderloin for several hours beforehand (a solution of 1/4 cup coarse salt, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 4 cups water, two teaspoons fennel, 2 bay leaves, and a teaspoon of black peppercorns, brought to boiling to disolve, then cooled to room temperature.) We also coated the outside of the tenderloin with a 1/4 cup dijon mustard over the fennel. Our only criticism was that it seemed a bit salty. Perhaps because we chose to brine it, we should have eliminated the salt from the spice rub. Otherwise, it was perfectly done, moist and very flavorful. Agree with the suggestion to simply bake the onions with the pork; 15 mins. didn't seem long enough. Also suggest removing from oven when pork is at 145 degrees.

A great, simple, elegant and tasty meal. My husband loved it, and he's not a big fan of pork. The fennel is not at all overpowering. In a word: Great!

With some reservations, because I don't like licorice, I made the entire menue for the fennel-crusted roast pork. This included the Roasted-Beet Salad and the "Confetti" Couscous, all on this site. Each recipe was wonderful. There was no strong licorice flavor in using the fennel seeds and the fennel bulb, and we loved how everything went together. The first time through on any Gourmet recipe I never change a thing because I feel the recipes have been thoroughly tested and I would never know what the food editor had in mind if I started making my own additions. For these 3 recipes I wouldn't change a thing. The only problem I had was in reducing the broth. At the end of 15 minutes on my stove it was nowhere near being reduced to 1/2 cup. Next time I'll use a larger pan and boil it to get it down to 1/2 cup. We thought this was a great menu and I'll make it again for company.

Wonderful! My family really loved this dish. The fennel taste was superb.

I altered this recipe only slightly (unusual for me), and was very disappointed in the results. I ground up the fennel, added a bit of rosemary, then salt and black peppercorns for the rub. I roasted the loin carefully, basting with the broth. It still came out dry, and the rub had a bitter, medicinal taste. I think any diners who are not fennel fans would be very turned off by this dish, so I caution future cooks before serving it to conservative eaters/guests.

I made this roast last night and it was wonderful. I used a boneless pork loin roast of about 3 lbs. I have a feeling the recipe is actually for a tenderloin roast (due to the small size and short cooking time). I served it with fennel and boursin risotto to which I added asparagus and the flavors worked very well together. A definate "keeper".

What a wonderful but elegant dish to serve to the family or to company. It is very simple to make but the flavor is so rich. A suggestion to keep the onions intact... do remove the root completely. Yes, it takes a few minutes to do the onions but they add so to the flavor.

This is a simple elegant dish, very impressive. I will make this again, with the following changes. The whole onion business was bothersome and did not work well. Possibly, I cut them too small because they did not stay intact..also the suggested timing is silly..It makes more sense to bake the onions along with the pork (the oven temp. can remain at 425 for both) I might try it with pearl onions, but I really think that it is an unecessary step. The pork is wonderful! I needed more fennel rub than the recipe called for, but other than that and adding a little onion powder to the sauce I didn't (and will not) change a thing. My husband and I both really enjoyed this and think it would make a wonderful 'company' meal. One added delight to this meal is the wonderful aroma of fennel that fills the house as you bake. Really quite lovely..try this one..but forget the onions.
