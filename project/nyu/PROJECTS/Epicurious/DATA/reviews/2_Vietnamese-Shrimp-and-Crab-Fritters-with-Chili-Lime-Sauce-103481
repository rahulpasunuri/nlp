Sounded good... ended up falling apart in the oil it was horrible! I added an egg and saltine crackers and made fish cakes. What a huge disappointment. Do NOT make! It was a waste of good ingredients.

I am regretting that I did not read the comments on this recipe before I made it. It was watery and when dropped into the hot oil, proceeded to spatter all over me. I added some flour to it (since I didn't have breadcrumbs) and started over again. The taste was not at all impressive. Very sour - too much lime juice. I served it to a guest, and was very embarrased.

This is NOT a Vietnamese recipe and appears to be some editor's (Bon Appetit) idea of an Asian fritter. Vietnamese do not use egg white or bell pepper in their fritters. They would process the fish and shrimp together to a paste like consistency and omit the crab. Fish sauce is Nuoc Mam not Nam Pla and turns into Nuoc Cham when you add water,sugar,lime juice,garlic and chili paste.You would dip the fritters wrapped in lettuce leaves in this. Nam Pla is Thai fish sauce and since this is the only Asian ingredient besides ginger and sesame oil in this recipe, this should be listed as a Thai fritter,not Vietnamese. The chili lime sauce recipe is Nuoc Cham with carrot added, a common modification but with carrot is used mainly for dipping egg rolls and Banh Xeo. Try Banh Xeo instead for a good Vietnamese recipe(Like an open faced omlet with shrimp, pork and bean sprouts)Roll in lettuce and mint leaves and dip in Nuoc Cham...You can see from the comments from LA and Ann Arbor that the Vietnamese take exception to corrupted recipes bearing no resemblance to traditional cooking bearing their name. This is something served in the home or on a street corner and not traditional cuisine. Vietnamese cooks in America tend to adjust their recipies to our tastes and rarely serve truly authentic dishes so the fact that Vietnamese serve something here does not make it a Vietnamese dish.

Being Vietnamese, I can understand the Cook from LA's confusion....this seems more like street-food, if anything, not a typical Vietnamese dish. Who knows, maybe it's a Vietnamese-American invention.

I would like to know why the person below said this wasn't vietnamese. Two Vietnamese restaurants in my town serve something very similar to these. The owners and chefs are Vietnamese.

The mixture was so watery than when one was dropped in the hot oil it just turned into a soup like mixture. We ended up adding two beaten eggs and bread crumbs to the rest and had fish cakes for dinner.
