For high altitude cooks, you will have to add more liquid and expect to let the pot simmer for longer as well. Our jambalaya took 50 minutes of simmering and two additional cups of liquid (we used one cup broth one cup water) and then it was fantastic! Spicy but in that good way.

This was really good. I subbed in bacon for half of the sausage and it worked out wonderfully! This makes enough to feed an army. My roommmate and I both had 2 bowls full for dinner and there's going to be enough to feed me for the rest of the week.

I've made this recipe before with leftover rice and it has been very good. But when I tried to do it as it is suggested in the recipe, there wasn't enough liquid to cover the rice. It ended up being a hot mess of super soggy and super crunchy rice.

Didn't have green bells so I used poblanos from the garden. Also sub'd deer sausage, and chicken breast. Yee haw-yummie! Oh! AND i used pumpkin pie spice cuz I didn't have cloves, didn't wanna go to the store. He-he! It was great. Keeper.

I made this recipe exactly -- no changes. Midway through the cooking, I split it in two - 2 pans on the stove now. In the end, one pot served 9 people. It was awesome, very tasty! If I want to serve 8 - 10 people, I will cut this in half next time, but not change anything else.

Great jambalaya, although the green peppers ended up a little bit soggy (i like mine a little crisper), and the chicken was slightly tough, but it could've just been me overcooking it. Overall i would definitely make it again. Delicious and not too difficult to make!

Rating: 3
For a simple, quick and easy jambalaya, the flavors worked well together and my family was generally pleased. I used brown rice, added chopped tomatoes and used beef broth instead of chicken, which all seemed to work perfectly fine, but I think there was too much rice as compared to the other ingredients. The heat was just enough to make it interesting for those of us who like heat, but wasn't too hot for the wimps in the family... I think I'd add more cayenne if I could do it over again. I would definitely make this again if I was short on time and needed to feed the whole crew, but I'm going to keep looking to see if there are better recipes out there.

I love this recipe and plan on making it for Fat Tuesday. The only thing is the cayenne pepper I have is really spicy, so 3/4 teaspoon was too much the last time. It made it difficult too eat. Thanks for the tips for the rice. Although I don't mind mushy rice.

Really good and super easy. I served it for a group of 6 and we all could have had seconds- it makes a LOT. I followed the suggestion from another review to rinse rice three times before I added it and had no problem with mushy rice. I sub. dried parsely b/c that's all I had and it was ok in a pinch. It wasn't spicy at all, but did have good flavor. I'll add more cayenne next time.

Made this recipe for about 80 guests and it was absolutely perfect. The layered flavors where incredible and my guests raved about it. One suggestion- rinse the rice about 3x before cooking, it keeps the rice from gumming up. I also used roasted chicken form Costco, which made this a much easier recipe to prepare. I added it in when combining together. I then put it in the oven for 1 hour at 350F and it came out great. In the oven the sausages will float to the top. You can either leave it alone or mix in before serving.

I used spicy sausage and chicken breasts and thighs. Flavor- wise, I thought this was great. Yes, my rice was mushy, but so flavorful! Maybe next time I'll try brown rice and beer. My only complaint- there is NO WAY this feeds 8 people- 8 lumberjacks maybe. I can't believe how much is left over.

I don't know what went wrong, but this recipe was such a disappointment! I followed the advice of other reviewers and added stout beer as well as brown rice, and somehow the flavors just didn't turn out right! I pretty much followed the recipe to a T, but it was bland & boring-- such a disappointment since I was serving it to a crowd! I'll keep searching for another recipe =(

Rating: 4
Great recipe. The recipe is fairly easy to follow, and more importantly, easy to execute. Like other people, I used 3 cups of broth, a cup of dark beer, and two cups worth of diced tomatoes. The recipe, as written, made a large amount of food, as others have mentioned. But, my family tries to make leftovers as often as possible, so the portions were fine. The recipe produced enough food for two meals, and perhaps someone's lunch too. In terms of heat, I found the jambalaya plenty spicy. Any more heat and it would have overwhelmed the dish.

2 1/2 forks...nice for weeknight meal,halved recipe, used boneless skinless chicken breasts cut in chunks, needs a little more "veggie" action for us, lil too spicy for my hubby, and needed a stronger broth to make just a little better. overall though great for weeknight...

I have made this recipe many times with white rice and always got mushy rice. Made it in my pressure cooker with long grain brown rice and it came out perfectly even though I had to "cook down" some of the excess liquid. Used a dark beer for the first time as other cooks suggested - wow - what a flavor boost. Also prefer using boneless chicken thighs and a spicy sausage. Slice and brown the sausage to render out some fat. Remove the fat and continue with the recipe.

I can't believe I've never reviewed this recipe. I've been making it for 10 years. It is what my husband requests if I ask him what he wants for dinner. Completely delicious. I've changed the recipe occasionally over the years and used andouille sausage or turkey kielbasa. It's perfect as is, though.

Halved this recipe and added 1/2 pound of shrimp at the very end. Also substituted italian turkey sausage and brown rice to make it healthier. As the turkey sausage was uncooked, I removed the casing and added it when the recipe called for. Absolutely delicious, guilt-free and easy - will absolutely make again.

This was a pretty good recipe- made an insane amount of food, be aware that you need an extra large pot to make everything. Make sure you use all of the broth required, my rice turned out a little crunchy at the end so cook it for all the time possible. Otherwise good recipe for a large group of people.

To add to my other review - I add shrimp too!

Rating: 4
This is a household favourite. I put it whatever colour of peppers I have around (red, yellow, orange). Also, we are not fans of cloves so I leave them out. Boneless skinless chicken works best. Also, because we like spicy, I double the cayenne and use hot Italian sausage. My husband and I have both been to New Orleans and we agree this is just as good as any we have had there. One thing I disagree with is adding tomatoes to Jambalaya. There are so many other wonderful flavours.

I halved the recipe, used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, venison sausage and guesstimated the spices. It turned out good save for the mushy rice. I'd make it again but with a lot less liquid. Otherwise it was tasty but it does need salt and pepper. S&P the chicken before frying add a little when you add the broth... Some folks might want some after it's done, too.

Rating: 4
In a word delicious! After trying jambalaya in a dozen or so fairly expensive restaurants I decided to try and make it myself. And I have to say this is the best I have ever had. Followed the recipe as written except that I just use a bunch of thighs instead of the whole chicken. Have added shrimp and that is great as well. I have never had the mushy rice problem or the uneven cooking. Leftovers microwave well, do not reheat on the stove top, this will give you mushy rice.

Rating: 4
This recipe brought me back to New Orleans. I also added Guinness, celery, tomatoes and more Guinness (ha ha). I did not cut the recipe in half and had enough for at least 8 people. One thing I did notice was that the rice does not cook evenly, so after the cooking time was up, I dropped a bunch of shrimp on top, some cajun seasoning, more beer and stuck it in a 350 degree oven for 15 min. It did the trick. As today is Mardi Gras, "LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL!!!"

Easy and delicious. I used brown rice, a package of drumsticks, a package of boneless chicken breasts (which I halved, added a can of diced tomatoes and used a tablespoon of creole seasoning in place of the spices. The rice does get mushy, but that's ok. Kids loved it.

Rating: 3
Very enjoyable recipe all around: fun prep, easy to cook, great tasting. I followed most of the reviewers tips: halve the recipe except the spices, add two stalks celery, omit the cloves, add a pinch of oregano, use 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes with jalapeno plus 8 fl. oz. Guiness Extra Stout plus 1 cup broth for liquid, substitute 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes for the cayenne. I used a 4-pack of chicken thighs bone-in but skinned and trimmed of fat. Also 8 to 10 shrimp cut into three chunks each, plus 3 or 4 thick asparagus stalks snapped into chunks, plus 5 or 6 sliced green onions --- these last three added on top at the end, for about 5 minutes. Used basmati rice and did NOT stir, as someone suggested (for me, that makes the rice mushy). Also added one large jalapeno --seeded, trimmed & chopped -- to the celery, onion, bell pepper & parsley mix. I used 1 tsp each of New Mexico mild chili and an India chili. Will probably cut back red pepper flakes by a smidge next time; but after thinking uh-oh at first taste, the heat was fine and did not distract from the lovely blend of flavors. Hat tip to the reviewer who suggested asparagus: I'll double that next time. I heated the liquids in the microwave to near boiling before adding, which is a tip from my favorite Spanish rice recipe. Initial cook time was 20 minutes, then a scant 5 more for the shrimp & veggie toppings, then remove from heat and let sit for 10 minutes. Served this for two while watching a movie; it was so good, we each made two trips back to the kitchen! Roughly one-third was left over.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. I followed the advised modifications - double the spices and garlic, 3 stalks of celery and used turkey kielbasa and 4 large chicken breasts to help reduce the fat content. I also used brown rice and realized I needed a little extra liquid as a result. Therefore, next time I'll use 2 cans of broth, one large can of crushed tomatoes (I prefer the texture to diced for this) and 1 cup of Amber Ale. Stirring periodically is also key to avoiding some crunchy rice. Also, I didn't have chili powder so I had to use part of a packet of chili mix! Still - very, very good! Even my 21 month old baby loved it! Enjoy...

GREAT DISH! Like others, I tweaked the recipe a bit by cutting the recipe in half for the chicken, sausage, rice and bell peppers but used the regular amount of spices. I also followed the suggestions of others and used 1 cup of Guinness beer, 1 can of diced tomatoes (juice inc) and 1 cup of chicken broth. I also added half a pound of shrimp and 2 stalks of celery. My husband said it was a definite keeper! Tons of leftovers even after cutting the recipe in half so we can't wait to eat the rest!

Rating: 3
Wow, whatta great recipe! Easy to prepare, and absolutely delicious. I skimmed all the reviews, but no one else mentioned brown rice, which is what I used; I also had leftover chicken breasts and hot (turkey) Italian sausage to use up. Given my ingredients, I had to tackle things somewhat differently: I did the rice pilaf-style, cooking it with some of the onions, garlic and peppers, but also the seasonings, beer and canned diced tomatoes. The rice alone was so delicious, I'll be making it that way again as a side! In a separate pot, I cooked more onion and peppers, plus celery, and added the cut-up chicken and sausage along with a can of stewed tomatoes. Following others' advice, I cut the recipe in half but kept the seasonings generous. We both had seconds, and will probably fight for the leftovers.:-)

Followed the others suggestions and had a hit *cut recipe in half *use chicken breast cut in strips and marinate in cajun spices *andouille sausage instead of kielbasa *omit cloves *add 1/2 t oregano *use 2 C chicken broth, 1-6 oz can of tomato paste and 1 C beer for liquids

I had some boneless, skinless chicken thighs in the freezer so I just used those. I seasoned them with Creole seasoning, browned them, and then chopped them up. I recommend using andouille sausage for a nice cajun kick. Also, based on the other reviews, I cut the rice down to one cup, and the broth down to about 3 1/2 cups....it was excellent (even with cutting back on the rice there were plenty of leftovers). We had it with crusty bread and a green salad. My three kids HATED it -- but I would definitely make it again!

Rating: 3
I also made the changes listed below (beer and tomato), and was very happy. I used a couple different kinds of sausage, because that was what I had, but definitely recommend chorizo. Also, I used chicken breast, which I shredded and marinated in olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper and cayenne pepper, and it came it out REALLY well (my boyfriend and cousin kept eating pieces while I was browning it and the sausage, etc.). I expected more people for dinner, and so made the full amount. My boyfriend and cousin ate the WHOLE thing in one night. So, yeah, it went over well. I would seriously recommend marinating shredded chicken.

Great recipe! Halved the recipe (would still probably feed 5-6 with a salad and bread) and made the following substitutions: added 2 stalks celery, used chorizo cause it's what I had, followed other reviewer's suggestions and used only 1 cup stock, then 1 cup beer and a can of diced tomatoes, with juice. Also used a pack of 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, which I first sprinkled with creole seasoning, dried thyme and olive oil. Left out the cloves, and couldn't find the cayenne so used a heaping half teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Yum, yum, yum! Will certainly make this one again.

This was a great recipe. My boyfriend and I kind of just grabbed stuff out of the fridge and made this, and it tasted great.

Great recipe! I was going to use this recipe as is but after comparing about 15 jamblaya recipes and reading the reviews I modified this recipe because so many of the other recipes used tomatoes, celery and cubed chicken. I halved the recipe for 2 and yes, there were lots of great leftovers. I coated the chicken pieces with Emeril's Essence before sauteeing. I did not cube the chicken but did take the skin off and next time I'll use only thighs and legs because they're more flavorful and moist. I added 3 stalks of celery, one 14oz. can of diced tomatoes w/chilies, doubled the garlic and used 1 cup of broth and one 12 oz. Shiner Bock beer for the liquid. I cooked for 20 minutes then added 12 medium shrimp and 1 bunch of sliced green onions and cooked for about 5 minutes more. The result was excellent! I served this with a simple green salad and baguette as the BA 2/97 article suggested.

I took a lot of advice off this site for making this dish, and it turned out so good! I agree that it would feed 8 line backers, not regular-size folk! Here's what I did: marinated 2 pounds of skinless/boneless chix breasts with olive oil, chili powder, and thyme. Salt and peppered chix and then in very hot olive oil, I browned the chicken on both sides, then removed and sliced. With the onions and green peppers, I added 2 celery stalks, chopped. Peeled and deviened 1 pound of large shrimp and then made shrimp stock with the shells (set aside peeled shrimp to use later in dish). Instead of 6 cups of chix broth, used 3 cups broth, 1 cup of shrimp stock, 1 cup guiness beer, 1 can petite diced tomatoes (and their liquid). It did get a little "mushy," but I still thought it was extra, extra good. Chicken was cooked through when the rice was done. At the very end, I threw in the reserved large shrimp and stirred to cook. Everyone loved it. Eating the leftovers for lunch for the next couple of days and not at all bummed about that!

Was looking for a recipe to feed 4 couples, and, boy, was this a hit! Following others' advice, I substituted a can of beer for 12 oz. broth and added 3 stalks of chopped celery. I used 4 chicken breasts and 6 chicken thighs with bones and skin rather than a whole cut chicken, and I bought fresh andouille sausage from the gourmet grocery and pre-cooked it the night before. I think it added a lot. Also, my cooking times were a little longer at every step. Could not wait for lunch today to eat leftovers and there's still more left for tomorrow's lunch.

I made this after Thanksgiving (What to do with the left-over turkey?). I followed the advice of some other reviewers and added some celery. Also 1 cup of beer and a can of diced tomatoes in place of 2 c of broth. I threw in some hunks of turkey along with the chicken and kielbasa. This recipe was easy. The jambalaya was good enough to rate praise from my husband, who is the world's pickiest eater. Next time I'd add shrimp. This recipe does make a lot, but we were happy to have leftovers, and it disappeared fast.

I followed some of the reviewers' suggestions: I used only 4 cups of chicken broth, and added 1 cup of beer (Guiness) and 1 can of undrained diced tomatoes. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, instead of a whole chicken, and turkey kielbasa. This was the 1st time I've made jambalaya and I thought it turned out great! The flavors really blended together well, and I liked the combination of the spices. The only thing I would do differently next time is to add more tomatoes -- I wanted a stronger tomato flavor in this. This recipe does make a lot, but we are happy having a lot of leftovers!

I love this recipe, my only changes were I added celery, a large bunch, this adds tremendous flavor and cooks down alot. I also did not use the cloves or cayene or thyme! I get alot of flavor from the chili powder, I also add Frank's red hot sauce while cooking and serve it out on the table as well. I also let the rice sit in the mixture before adding the water, this helps the rice absorb alot more flavor!! This is a wonderful recipe!!! I am not one big on changing a recipe, but these changes really added a lot, I hope they are helpful!!YUM!!

OK, it does make a lot. Don't worry, NONE of it will go to waste becuase it is excellent. Someone suggested adding beer in place of some of the chicken broth and that works great. Might as well, since you will probably want to have a couple of bottle on hand to drink with this wonderful dish.

This recepie was really delicious. I didn't have any cloves, but it still came out great. I added a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles. However, i neglected to drain it and the rice came out a little mushy. I definately will remember to reduce some of the chicken broth next time, as well as more spice and perhaps a can of tomato paste, too. This made a *HUGE* amount of food....even for a household that likes leftovers, I think my fiancee and I will not be able to finish it all. excellent recepie, though.

Excellent. Made this for my family, with a few minor changes. I used 2 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Sliced into strips and marinated in 3tbs olive oil, 2 tsp chili powder, and 1 tsp thyme. Browned the chicken strips then set aside until rice was almost done. Added the chicken at the end to heat it up without drying it out. The chicken breast was easier and healthier than using whole chicken pieces, and the marinating made it just as flavorful. I also substituted one can of crushed tomatoes for an equal amount of chicken broth. Yummy!

Husband made this for us tonight, and I took over about 3/4 of the way through because he had to take a call. Added 1 can diced toms, more garlic and onion powder, oregano, beer and marsala wine (it was what I had). I had decided (without reading the whole recipe first because he kept it hidden while cooking) that I wanted it over pasta, so cooked pasta half way then added to mix with 1 c chx broth and 1 c beef broth (for 1/2 recipe). When I tell yout this is awesome I mean it! Thanks to cooks who said to add more spices, esp oregano, and toms and beer- I foresee this in a crockpot for a party in the future with homemade french bread!! Wonderful!!!

Easy to make, this recipe turned out great with a little "doctoring up". Following suggestions from the other reviews, I used boneless skinless breasts (used 1.5 lbs. but could have used a bit more). This recipe is heavy on sausage. I also added 1 cup of chopped celery and reduced green pepper by 1 cup and substituted 1/2 cups each of red and yellow bell peppers for color. Also reduced broth by 2 cups and added 2 cans of Cajun style stewed tomatoes with liquid. This resulted in a dryer recipe, so I will either add Tomato sauce or more broth next time. Also added a bit more Cayenne. All in all, a great "one pot" meal.

This is really good. I halved it, and it was still more than enough to feed 4 people. I did use kielbasa. I have a Polish boyfriend who is on the constant lookout for any Polish ingredient, and I made this dish for him once when I was in the doghouse. It worked. It smelled so good when it was cooking, I had a hard time not opening the pot's lid to stick my face in it! The next day I wanted to eat more of it, but someone had already gone through and picked out all the kielbasa pieces.

This is an easy recipe with nice flavor. I used low-fat turkey kielbasa. (I tried it with regular kielbasa, and it came out too greasy.) I also used chicken thighs instead of a whole chickenm and added more cayenne for an extra kick. My boyfriend loves it!

I guess it's a two and a half star. I started out by sprinkling skinless chicken thighs with some cajun seasoning. Browned everything and added a cup of celery and some chopped cilantro. I recommend reducing rice to two cups, and liquids (beer and broth) to four plus one can of diced tomatoes. Be liberal with the spices, salt and pepper well, and a dash of oregano is a good idea. Easy and fast to make, one dirty pot, makes a lot, goes great with beer, and it's quite economical. Perfect for a big crowd.

This is an excellent recipe. Be forewarned, however, as it is enough to feed an army. I would suggest adding 25-50% more of the spices than the recipe calls for. Okra is also a nice traditional southern addition. Like some others, I've used low-fat sausage and it still tastes wonderful!

This recipe is a good starting point if you're unfamiliar with Jambalaya, but definately needs some fine tuning. First of all, beware that this makes a HUGE amount of food. I cut it in half and still had enough to feed 6 with side dishes and 4 for a all in one meal. I used skinless bone in chicken thighs with the kielbasa. Also, I added a couple ribs of diced celery, a 12 oz. can of chopped tomatoes that were well drained, and an 8 oz can of tomato sauce. Oregano is a nice added flavor. I like to cut back on total liquids to avoid a mushy pasty dish, so instead of the typical 2:1 rice ratio, I did 1.5:1(including tomato juices and sauce).

Excellent recipe! I have made this a few times now, and always reieve compliments. Yes, it is a large amount of food, but I was raised in a family that always had leftovers (good for lunch the next day). Two quick tips: (1)Use boneless/skinless chicken breasts to decrease the fat. (2)Marniate the chicken for a couple hours first, using the same spices listed in the recipe. Simply sear the chicken on high for a minute or so on each side, then allow them to finish cooking in the liquid. Very tasty and not overcooked. I also like the idea of using red and yellow peppers along with the green to make the presentation a bit more colorful.

Great easy Jambalaya recipe. In addition to the suggestions from A Cook on 04/22/01, try adding a couple of chopped celery stalks.

Easy, quick prep, delicious... great leftovers! Definitely a crowd-pleaser - I'd like to add other things next time, like shrimp - this dish can only improve!

I've made this one several times with a few adaptations. It is huge so unless you are like us and love great leftovers cut it in half. I use 3lb. of boneless skinless breast and thighs. Brown the sausage in a separate skillet while sautéing the onion & garlic in the olive oil, then brown the chicken in the same skillet. We like spicy so I increase the caynne to 1 tsp. and I add a can of diced tomatoes in juice (it isn't too much liquid for the full amt. of rice but if halving you may need to decrease the liquid. I also use part red and yellow bell peppers for better flavor and color. I also add them and the parsley at the same time as the rice to help retain some color and texutre. The combo of chili pdwr,thyme and clove is fantastic. 30 min is plenty of time for the rice-more and it will be overcooked and mushy. One of my favorite Epicurious recipes.

I served this at an informal dinner party and everybody raved. However, next time I'll use half the rice and a little less spice.

Delicious!

Another keeper! I omitted the cloves which didn't appeal to me and used skinless chicken breasts. For our family of four, I cut the recipe in half and it still made a ton. But after the three guys all had seconds, only one serving was left - which the two kids fought over the next a.m. for breakfast!

Too much rice and overdone chicken. Rice tasted ok but chicken was tasteless and overcooked. Maybe it will taste better as a soup tomorrow.

This dish went over pretty well at our house. I liked it so much, I sent some over to a friend and she called right away to say how delicious it was. I did use boneless skinless chicken breast, and then followed the recipe accordingly. The kids thought it was great, just a little too spicy for them. My husband ate a few bowls in one sitting. We will probably make this again, just a little less spice next time.

I made this for a Mardi Gras party and it was a huge hit - a few people said it was the best they'd ever had! I substitued boneless chicken breasts, which I marinated in cajun sauce and olive oil, sauteed, and then stirred in at the very end. I also substitued 16 oz. canned tomato sauce for one cup chicken broth, and I used jerk flavored spicy sausage. When it was done cooking it was a bit bland, but after a hefty dose of salt and pepper was perfect. Pretty spicy!

I just about fell over when I made this the first time -- it is that good. It does get a bit greasy, so I increase the amount of rice somewhat. Skinless chicken of any type also works well (as does shrimp), and halving the recipe still makes enough for a crowd. I can't say enough good things about it and was happy to see that others felt the same way!

I expected more after all the rave reviews. Perhaps I messed something up. It is good, but not great. It does make a ton. Now I have it for lunch until it's gone. There are other recipes on this site that are much better.

My whole family loved this recipe and it makes a ton!

This is an extremely delicious recipe that even my picky kids and husband enjoyed. I substituted legs and thighs, skinned, to lessen fat. I also used a bit more chili powder and didn't add cayenne.

I have recently become interested in jambalaya and have tried several recipes. While I think this is good, I'm not sure that I'd make it again. I found the clove flavor to be odd and a bit overwhelming.

This is a great dish. I would make it again. It also good for a large group of people. I substitued 2 cups of beer for the broth and added some shrimp.

YUMMY!! I suggest maybe using boneless skinless chicken breast (marinated) or the meat from the thighs. Other than that, wonderful dish - even my kids love it!

Very good recipe, and easy for a dinner party or many people (or for a couple of days' worth of dinners...) I reduced the amount of cayenne pepper (the first time I made it, it was much too spicy, even for someone who is half Indian!) Also, I replaced one third of the chicken broth with pureed tomatoes. Yum.

It was great, but I recommend draining the fat after browning the chicken. The chicken fat combined with the fat in the sausage makes it a little oily. A couple of jalapenos gave it a little kick, and a cup of celery added a little bit of texture.

This recipe is perfect when 1 cup of wine, 1/2 cup of beer, and 1 and 1/2 cups of pureed tomato is part of the 6 cups of liquid. Very good!

This is a favorite that I have re=used time and again ... must admit though, that I've cut the fat content by using boneless, skinless thighs (not breasts since the meat dries out too much) ... quick, easy and satisfying!
