This is a perfectly good pastry recipe. I agree with the other reviewers that one must be mindful when adding the water, not overwork and chill. I don't have a food processor, so I cut the shortening in with a knife.

Quiche is pretty hard to mess up. I used this recipe as a guide, but made modifications based on what I had. I used half & half instead of cream & milk. I made a few different fillings right in the shells, and then poured the custard over each. I, too, used wheat flour b/c it was all my friends had at their house. Your dough will shrink away from the pan b/c it has so much more gluten than AP flour. I just rolled out the dough and flopped it into brownie pans. I prebaked the shells, and although they shrank back, I poured the custard over the whole thing & once it baked & set, no one was the wiser. If you use non-stick brownie pans, the slices come right out. A great solution for too many eggs; sudden guests; no time to cook.

Exceptional pastry recipe. My quiche got rave reviews. To the reviewer who "got goo", anytime you are told to "add 5 - 6 tablespoons of water", you should realize that the water must be added gradually and that you might not use all the water. I live in humid south Florida so I never use all the water recommended in pastry recipes.

Gooooooooo. I make pastry crust regularly (Apple Galette, November 2006, this site, for one) and have no problem whatsoever with it, so I don't know what happened with this. My gut told me that 5 to 6 Tablespoons was too much liquid - I even doublechecked the recipe to make sure it wasn't teaspoons. I got,,,,gooooo. Recommend that if you have a pastry crust recipe that you like, use that one.

I used this recipe for a lemon tart and found it easy to make. I just pressed it into the tart pan. It was very light and flaky. Will add a little sugar to it when using it for dessert rather than a quiche the next time.

Easy -- I just made two adjustments: subbed out 1/4 cup with whole wheat flour and added a dash of wheat germ (my new thing for added crunch). Love the food processor. It did shrink when I prebaked it, so note to self is don't overtrim.

This was super-easy made in the food processor. I used it with a quiche Lorraine filling, and it was perfect. It had great texture and substance while letting the flavors of the quiche filling shine through. I would definitely use this recipe again.

This is a very good basic recipe and it is very easy to work with. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and found it a little lacking in flavor; as others have. The second time I added a tsp. of salt and a Tbls. of sugar and it was perfect.

yes this pastry crust is wonderful. dont over finger it. but fingered just enough, it is just right. no dough likes to be over fingered.

This pie crust is totally devoid of taste.

Comes out great if you follow directions, don't finger much, then rest and freeze. Light, buttery, and flaky.

As a person who has sworn off homemade crust because of the inevitable hassle and unsatisfactory results, I can safely say I am reformed after using this recipe! Resting and freezing are key.

To Newport RI, Why did you rate 2 forks? If you didn't like it at all, it should not have ANY!!! Have you read the rating instructions? Duh!

I was not happy with this crust at all. I thought it was relatively tasteless, and found myself thinking it was like having a cold - you bite and chew and swallow but it's like having cardboard in your mouth. That having been said, the guests did help themselves to seconds (maybe it was the filling?). I gave them the leftovers to take home - otherwise I would have thrown them out!

Terrific quiche! The best I've ever tasted and so simple to make. I made it for a Breakfast Tea I was having for my girlfriends. They all said it was absolutely delicious and ate every bite. I made the bacon and onion variation of the recipe and added a layer of spinach, 8 c. baby spinach squeezed dry, sauteed in olive oil. This is definitely a recipe I will make for years to come!

I have used this recipe over and over again for many different recipes calling for a basic pastry. It is virtually fool proof and delicious every time. I make sure that all the ingredients are very cold and handle the dough as little as possible. I typically double the recipe and make two pies or quiches. Once the dough has rested on the countertop, it rolls out beautifully. Just make sure that you chill it very well before baking. It holds its shape and is flaky...perfect!

The recipe was enough for the quiche and a little turnover. It was beautifully flaky and rolled out easily.

If you're using a pulse to mix the flour and butter, and again to mix the dough, how can you have the machine running when you add the water?
