Like other reviewers said, this was weird. I tried it with sour cream and it was still all wrong.

Pretty weird. I subbed sour cream for the yogurt and it was still a little weird.

If it was not for the sour cream suggestion, when I made it a second time, I would have rated this as the worst ever. Use the previuos suggestion.

This dish is easy, healthy and wonderful. I also served it with baked salmon, and a friend even served it with eggs, hollandaise-style. A great dish for either company or a quick weeknight dinner.

I followed the suggestion to use sour cream - worth it!! The dill sauce might even work well with a meaty perhaps even grilled fish.

I liked this; my husband really liked it. I tasted the sauce before spooning it on the chicken, and I really liked it. I used no-fat yogurt, and I thought it came out really well. Then, when I tried it with the chicken, I liked it less. Oh well. I still think I'll make it again.

Taking a cue from some of the other reviews, I used all sour cream instead of yogurt and everyone including myself, loved the dish. Also sprinkled some of the fresh dill on the chicken before baking. I will definitely be making this dish again!

The first time I made the sauce I served it on broiled salmon. It was great! Add extra dill and a squirt of lemon juice. Make sure to use full-fat or low-fat yogurt. The second time I accidentally bought fat-free yogurt and it came out bland and soapy. A scoop of sour cream saved it but it was much better with the lowfat yogurt.

This was strange, and not in a good way.

I wasn't crazy about this sauce. Although I did only use the Dijon mustard. I think I just don't like the flavor combination of mustard & dill. But, if I did, I would strain the yogurt through a cheesecloth for a 1/2 hour to an hour to make it thicker.

What a great dish. Very light and also nice to not have to turn on the stove during this heat wave. The sauce is great--we had plenty left over so had it on a salad for lunch the next day.

Didn't have any yogurt so substituted 1/2 low fat sour cream and 1/4 cup low fat mayo - very tasty! Fresh dill is a must. It was great on toasted cheese sandwiches the next day too.

This sauce is absolutely excellent and couldn't possibly be easier to make! I prefer to increase the honey just a tad. Next time, I want to try the sauce on a more delicate food, such as fish or poached chicken. I think the sauce was slightly overshadowed by the charred/grilled flavor of the chicken.

This was pretty good, and pretty simple. Using chicken cutlets was a great idea - so much easier than breasts to grill evenly, and quickly! To make the sauce, I think I used syrup instead of honey, and when I opened the spice cabinet, there was a nip of Jack Daniels staring me in the face, so I used a Tbs. of that. Not a sauce for the kids, as it was never heated! I had to use light sour cream instead of yogurt. It wasn't sweet enough, so I added a Tbs of apricot preserves. I used the sauce as a grilling marinade, and also used a little more on the plate. I think the cutlets made the dish, and the saud was tasty.

Three-and-a-half forks is probably more accurate. Very quick and easy to put together. I did fool around with the recipe a little, though. Before grilling, I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper, then brushed on the 2 tbsp. mustard and a little honey, together with the olive oil. (This was in addition to the mustard and honey in the yogurt sauce.) I think it enhanced the flavor. I'd like to try this one with grilled salmon sometime.

I just made the dipping sauce portion of this recipe and it was FANTASTIC! Since the main ingredient is yogurt it had a very nice light consistency--not heavy like a mayonnaise or cream base. Absolutely delicious-my guests loved it and I'll be making this dip for chicken and fish for a long time!
