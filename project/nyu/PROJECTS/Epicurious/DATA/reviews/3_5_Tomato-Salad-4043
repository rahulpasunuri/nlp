Simple and tasty. Great with farm fresh tomatoes.

My fiance and I recently took a trip to Italy, and at nearly every restaurant we had to order this dish, called "insalata di pomodori" or "insalata caprese." In Italy, the tomatoes would be topped with basil and high quality (and oh my god, ineffably delicious) Buffalo mozzarella. (It's really too bad that I am a lowly student, or I'd be buying it up like crazy in the gourmet grocery store... if you can afford it, it's worth the pinch to your wallet). I also like some coarsely ground black pepper on mine.

Macerate a few cloves of garlic, let stand in a few tablespoons of vinegar (I prefer red wine, as recommended by Marcella Hazan) and salt. Drizzle this over the tomatoes (strain out the garlic), drizzle with your best olive oil, fresh pepper and a bit of torn basil..............

Tomatoes with oil and vinegar - who'd a thunkit? Yes - it is delicious - but I'm glad I didn't find this in a cookbook or I'd be a bit peeved that I paid for this recipe.

Wow, I've been making this for years. Had no idea it actually had a name. Tomatoes are about my favorite thing in the world so for me this a better snack than potato chips anytime. Deffinatly try it.

I LOVE recipes like this, ones that are so easy that you wonder, "why haven't I made this before?" Fantastic flavor! Goes great with penne/mushroom pesto.

Like a few people said before me, you can add fresh herbs and it makes this recipe even better. I added fresh tarragon, basil, oregano, thyme, marjoram, and rosemary from my garden. (I really dig herbs.) This recipe REALLY goes well with fish on the grill.

Very good. Simple and tasty. It cracks me up when critics say how good it is but you could add this or this and so on. I'm sure whomever presented this recipe is well aware of what other ingredients might be added. We have so many great chefs out there. Don't we?

This can be improved by adding fresh or dry basil if fresh isn't available and slicing a small onion.If you like garlic add a clove or two as well. Mix all together several minutes before serving for flavors to meld. Make sure you have plenty of fresh italian bread. Now that's a an Italian tomato salad

This is extremely simple and extremely delicious! You can whip it up in a second. It is a great dish to prepare in summer time because it is very light.
