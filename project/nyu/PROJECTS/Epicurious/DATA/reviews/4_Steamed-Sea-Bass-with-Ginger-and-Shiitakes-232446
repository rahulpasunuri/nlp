Absolutely delish! The sesame oil brought out the flavour of the seabass. It tasted as good as I'd had in Hong Kong! The one change I'd make is to halve the amount of ginger as it overpowers the beautiful melange of flavours. Can't wait to eat it again!

This dish is absolutely delish! So flavorful. Nice to know from prior reviewer that halibut works well, too. A great company meal. Served with jasmine rice and snap peas. Will definitely repeat!

When I made this I only had some of the ingredients, so mine did not include shiitakes or cilantro. To substitute, I dropped garlic in the steamer with the fish. I also grated the ginger (instead of slicing) and coated the tops of each filet before steaming. The fish came out SPECTACULARLY. Simple preparation and huge flavor. While steaming, all flavors fully infused into the fish. I will be making this (with the full recipe next time) many more times.

This is an authentic dish, my parents make this quite often at home. I'm so glad that I found this recipe, because I didn't realized that this dish is so easy to prepare. I made this the other night, and turned out great. I will definitely make this again.

I found a beautiful fresh sea bass at the fish market this morning; about a pound. Followed the instructions and as a side dish, couscous with pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries, finely chopped. Steamed artichokes. This was a delightful meal and I will absolutely make this dish again and again!

Absolutely loved it and so did the whole family. I will definitely make this for guests.

This is a must try dish. No need to practice, even for company; the recipe is fool proof. I served the Chilean sea bass over Lundberg Japone black rice (boiled with just water and a little ginger) and arranged snow peas around the fish. My guests oohed and aahed when they saw their plates.

Made this with carrots on top of the sea bass. Put extra ginger in the water while steaming. Heated the oil and put cilantro and onions in at the last moment, then poured that on top of fish when serving. I'm so pleased with the flavor and ease. Fish only took 12 minutes to cook, so prepwork was important. Quick and easy to the table. Family loved it.

Both my kids (10 and 12) LOVED this, as did our guests. This is an easy to make, and easy to please recipe.

I made this for a New Year's Eve dinner party to rave reviews; it was a nice light (late) meal after too many appetizers. I served it with green beans and Thai fragrant rice that I lightly seasoned with toasted black sesame seeds and a splash of rice vinegar. The only change I made to the recipe was the cilantro - my husband doesn't care for it, so I left it out. It was a wonderful dinner that I will definitely make again.

My husband and I loved this recipe and will definitely make it again. I couldn't get sea bass that day so we used fresh halibut. It is easy, tasty, healthy... I added carrots and red peppers to the steamer. Next time we will use snap peas. Fab.

I placed the fish on bok choy too. This recipe is easy and very good!

This dish was delicate and rich all at the same time, resulting in a wonderfully warm and satisfying epicurean experience. All the flavors were impeccably balanced and complimentary of each other. I have made this recipe with great success without cilantro, I didnt miss it, but the dish is good with it. I like to pair the fish with carrots, which I add to the steamer right away and snow peas, which I add to the steamer during the last three minutes of cooking. I recommend serving over black rice, the contrast is lovely and black rice is delicious.

If I could give it 5 forks, I would. Hubby said it was the best fish he has ever had. And he has had fish at some very good restaurants.

This has quickly become my favorite fish recipe - foolproof and easy. I recommend putting some ginger in the water under the steamer as well for greater flavor.

Easy, pretty, delicious and low calorie. Hooray! I used halibut. I was initially iffy on steamed fish, but I am now a believer. Definitely steam for less time than directed. (maybe 10 minutes). If you have a ten ounce piece it will be cooked perfectly at 12 minutes. You might want to include black sesame seeds or put them on a side dish. It would be a nice touch. I followed the recipe to the letter.

Excellent and tasted like it was from a 4 star restaurant! It was also easy - - I made this and 2 sides in under 30 minutes. For sides, I steamed sushi rice wtih black sesmae seeds and mixed in some rice wine vingigar at the end. Also added a sliced red bell pepper into the steamer when only about 5 minutes left. The fish was buttery and very flavorful! I highly recommend sticking to the sea bass --it is pricey but well worth it!

This has been a family favorite for at least 25 years...it is served at our table about 3 times a month. A suggestion..we often place the fish on a bed of snow peas or bok choy to steam together for a full meal in 10-12 minutes cooking time.

This is so tasty and easy! I have made it three times now and one thing I did differently last night was I made a soy reduction and drizzled on the plate first and then placed the sea bass on it. This prevented the juices from running all over the plate. Also we serve it with couscous with a little cumin and zucchini instead of aromatic rice.

Whoa, this is smoking! Restaurant Quality recipe. If you do not like this recipe I would suggest that you not order it in any high end restaurants that still offer seabass. It is right on the money.

Just a question -- is the "regular" sesame oil called for here the Asian (toasted) kind?

Rating: 3
This is tasty and easy. I adapted it to make it even easier by sprinkling the fish with the salt and peppers, topping with ginger, then sprinkling with soy sauce and sesame oil once it was placed on the parchment paper. Steamed the whole thing and skipped the rest of the steps. This yields a less complex flavor but was nice nonetheless and a good alternative if you don't have the rest of the ingredients on hand, like me!

Great recipe, easy and fairly quick. Recommend serving on a bed of rice (as suggested previously). One thing that will make a big difference, especially for those that don't care for REALLY strong flavors...rather than top the fish with the cilantro and onions then drizzle with hot oil...heat the oil, then toss the cilantro and onions into the hot oil at the last second and top the fish with that. Also, for me, 15 mins in the steamer is a bit much, I'd go 10-12.

very easy, and very good. i used tilapia, which was plenty flavorful with the ginger etc. go easy on the soy sauce.

Correction, it was not overpowering!

Absolutely foolproof! This recipe takes no time to put together. I was looking to duplicate a steamed sea bass entree that I had enjoyed at a 5 star restaurant over the weekend and loved it so much that I searched for a similar recipe to make at home. Not only was this recipe awesome, but it was better than the $42 entree I enjoyed on Saturday night. It is extremely easy and elegant. Sea bass can be a bit rich, but prepared in this way, it was rich and overpowering. I used dried porcini mushrooms as I did not have shitake on hand, added some of the poaching liquid from the mushrooms to the broth, and spooned brown aromatic rice around the fish in the shallow bowls I used to serve the fish. I will make this recipe over and over again.
