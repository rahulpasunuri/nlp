I used Chipotle pepper mayo, seasoning & Tabasco sauce to add a kick! It is a Creole dip : ) Plus, I refrigerated it over night, so the flavors could create a wonderful melange!

Not my favorite..wouldn't make again.

The peppers in this dip give it a nice warm spiciness and a bright orange color. I may have used a heavier hand on the cayenne, but not so much that it overpowered the delicate taste of the crab (fresh dungeness). I found this a quite tasty dip that I would definitely make again.

Somewhat disappointing. I used backfin crabmeat (Special) which may have contributed to the no so appealing appearance and the dip lacked zip even with the cayenne. Shallots might help with the flavor.
