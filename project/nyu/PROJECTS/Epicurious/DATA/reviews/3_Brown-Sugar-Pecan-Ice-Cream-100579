I too would cut down on the pecans, and crank up the sugar. Using one cup will make you crave a sweet topping to round it out.

I thought this recipe was wonderful! We made it for the 4th of July, and my kids were in awe. They had never made home made ice cream before. As adults we loved it as well. It froze relatively quickly, and has wonderful flavor. When I make it again, I won't use quite as many pecans, maybe just a cup and a half, and I'll add a little more vanilla. I love pecans, but they overpowered the ice cream flavor of this dish. Wonderful stuff!
