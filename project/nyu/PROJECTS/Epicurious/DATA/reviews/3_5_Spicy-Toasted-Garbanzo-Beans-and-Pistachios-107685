I made this for our Southwesrn Gourmet. I drained then 'dried' the beans in a 400º oven for about 10-15 minutes and let them cool. Then I tossed them with 2 tablespoons of oil and spices. I only used 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper and it was plenty. I put them in the 400º oven for about 40 minutes to get them crunchy; then followed the rest of the recipe. People seems to like them especially my husband.

Love these chickpeas! So tasty, spicy and yummy. They're in my permanent recipe file. Only change was that I didn't have any corn oil so I used vegetable, and will try olive oil next time.

This is a great snack! I will defintiely make this again! First of all, I cut this recipe in half but kept all the cooking times and temps--I ended up with really crispy chickpeas! Also I washed, dried, and baked the chickpeas at 400 on parchment paper for 15 minutes prior to starting the recipe. Some changes I made: I used almonds instead of pistachios, olive oil instead of corn oil, and cut the whole recipe in half to make with just one can of chickpeas. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the oil. Also, I omitted the thyme leaves and it was still yum!

My beans turned out a little more tender than crispy, so next time I'll try rolling them over a dishtowel and baking them a little longer before adding the nuts and thyme. As they were, this was a very tasty snack but I thought it needed a little something sweet to counter the salty spice. I added golden raisins with excellent results, and I think dried cranberries would probably work well here too. That said, this makes an excellent starter for a trail mix!

I love this recipe because I am a beanaholic and I'm always looking for creative ways to serve beans. This is a winner, the pistachios are the best part. The great thing about this recipe is it's a no brainer, and you can play creative chef without ruining it (ie. try it with curry, garlic, dried parsley, etc. for different flavor combinations). Also a suggestion? I tend to make these beans and then add them to a salad of cucumbers, roasted tomatoes and feta tossed with balsamic and oil. People can't believe I take the time to 'roast' beans as part of a salad and it always turns out DELICIOUS!

we loved this recipe! would have given it 3 forks had i not modified it with the omission of the pistachios and thyme. the beans must clearly be RINSED and drained. i guess the author omitted this step. i did take other cooks advice to dehyrate the garbanzos for 15-20 minutes before adding the spice. these turned out crunchy, crispy and delicious. a great snack! we will have some on hand for cocktail hour at all times. i do agree with adding about 1 1/2 tsp to 2 tsp salt since some will not adhere to the beans. make a slurry of the oil (decrease to 2-3 tbsp.) with the spices before tossing with the dehydrated beans. we will try other spice combinations as well including ranch and parmesan cheese with rosemary.

Roasted rinsed beans for 20 min. first, then tossed with spices and 3 tlb. of safflower oil. Nextime I will use more salt and less cayenne than recipe called for. I might try a sweet version using almonds, sugar, cinn., nutmeg, etc. next time. That might be great with a dessert wine!

I had high hopes for a healthy snack...it may be healthy, but neither I nor my husband found it at all tasty. I did decrease the oil as suggested, but actually increased the cayenne. Crunchy, but boring.

Very tasty mix however I couldn't get my chick peas to be crispy. I rinsed them and dried them in the oven for 20 minutes, then proceeded with the recipe. Instead of getting crispy, they just kept getting more dry in the oven.

it is not too often that i find a dish that is unique, with a taste that is beyond the ordinary. this was one. to take care of the chickpea and crunchiness issue: rinse the chickpeas well once drained from the can. then put them in a salad spinner if you have one, then as previous reviews state, put a dish towel on the pan and toss the chick peas on that to get out moisture. then at 400 roast the chick peas solo (no spice or oil) for 20 minutes (i put them on parchment paper which minimized charring), then oil/spice them and put them back in and proceed with recipe. People loved this at a party.

I was nervous about trying this due to the mixed reviews, but we are sharing the holiday with people who are healthy-eating vegetarians, so I wanted something they might enjoy. They are wonderful. I took the advice of a reviewer who suggested drying the chick peas on a cookie sheet in the oven before oiling them and after 25 minutes, they are crunchy! I don't have any fresh thyme left, so I may skip that step, but still these are a winner!

Wow! These are so easy to prepare and pack a punch of flavor! I basically followed the recipe but this one lends itself well to creativity e.g., different spices or nuts might be used. Make more than you think you need, these will go fast.

This recipe is a real winner! I make it all of the time for my family. Try adding 3/4 cup of Fresh or Frozen Peas (thaw first). It adds a wonderful sweet note to the spicy flavour of this snack.

This is an excellent, easy-to-make, tasty dish. You can adjust the spices and make it even spicier--YUM. A good, nutritious snack food too as they are wonderful at room temp. You can serve on the buffet table at parties as a finger food.

Not sure I'd make this again. It's quite a bit of work shelling the pistachios and the wow factor just wasn't there. I'll have to see what my husband thinks of the recipe.

I made this once and it was terrific but then lost the recipe. Happy to find it on line. I also needed to cook the chickpeas longer and will try the tips from other reviewers. If you have a Trader Joe's they have shelled raw pistachios that makes the recipe very easy. I'll make it early for my holiday guests and hide it from my husband so they'll be some for our party.

I made this for Thanksgiving, following the recipe to the letter. My guests ate it up -- so much so that there were no leftovers. I love garbanzo beans, and this recipe makes them taste even better than they do naturally. Finding unsalted nuts was a bit of a problem (and once I did, shelling them was a pain), but it was worth the end product.

Rating: 4
Outstanding. I think if you use reduced salt chickpeas it may help avoid the problem of their not getting crispy enough quickly enough. I had no problem with cooking times once I drained and blotted that kind. And everyone loved them -- it's the kind of recipe where no one believes you really made it and they all suspect you've got a container somewhere that you bought elsewhere!

I needed an extra munchie for a girls night, and I'm so glad I found this! I halved the recipe because the cans of chickpeas I buy are 19 oz. I'm really glad with how it turned out, but next time, I will leave the chickpeas in longer (or turn the temp. up) so they get crispy quicker. I left it in longer after adding the pistachios and the skin on the nuts almost blackened. The spicing was just right and it didn't take long before the bowl was empty!

Excellent party snack. Warning, totally addictive. I rinsed and dryed the beans before toasting in the oven. I watched them carefully to ensure that they got crisp but not burnt. I think the spucing was just about right, not too strong. The only problem is overeating, they are marvelous. There is a consolation, pistachios are wonderfully nutritious and the beans are chock full of healthy fiber so as snacks goes these are much better calorie for calorie than common snakcs like pretzels and potatoe chips, just have to maintain some "snacking control."

These are terrific. I did follow other reviews & patted the beans dry with cloth plus roasted them for just under 30 minutes. Used cashews instead of pistachios and they were a huge hit at our Christmas Party!

Rating: 2
This is a nice snack to go along with other hors d'oeuvres and is a unique twist on a bowl of nuts. I did about half nuts, half beans. The seasonings are great. I left the mixture in the cooling oven for about an extra 45 minutes, which made the beans all shrivel up and look really unappetizing, but it made them nice and crunchy, kind of like wasabi peas. I might do it again that way by choice, as they were still tasty the next day. Another reviewer advised me that these don't keep, but perhaps if they're baked/dried longer, they do fine.

This recipe is tops!!! I first tried them at a friend's appetizer party. LOVED THEM!!! I've made them countless times since. A perfect snack. Something like spicy mixed nuts, but oh so much better. I suggest after draining the beans to line the bowl with paper towels before oiling & spicing up, add beans & shake around a bit, remove the paper towels, then oil & spice up. The result will be much crisper, faster. I've changed up the recipe by using a little less oil (they still get golden, and crisp, and results in a less greasy feeling on the fingers while eating) and adding cashews and pine nuts instead of the pistachios. I'm a bit too lazy or pressed for time to shell them, and sometimes I don't grocery shop where shelled pistachios are available. The combo of cashews and pinenuts are a wonderful alternative. I've tried it with chopped almonds, but I don't care for them as much. I also put the nuts in the same bowl I oil & spice the beans, stir around a bit to lightly coat them in the remaing oil and spices left in the bowl. I think it adds a little something extra to the nuts. I love this recipe, and hope you will too.

the second time I made this recipe I rinsed the beans and then placed them on the cookie sheet in the oven for 5 minutes. This dried them thoroughly and I proceeded with the recipe. Really made a difference.

This was a great appetizer. It was gobbled up ! I cooked the beans at 450 for the time suggested plus another 8 minutes or so in order to get them crisp.

very nice. they didn't end up very crisp though, even though I cooked them longer than suggested. I think next time I'll try some of the tips some others have suggestd (rinse and dry the beans, and use less oil). I cut the amount of Cayenne in half since most people I know don't like too much heat in their pre-dinner snacks (distracts from the wine too much!). Goes great with a German Riesling Kabinett or Spatlese though, the sweetness cuts the heat.

I've made it twice and it came perfect both times, may friends loved it and my family also. I served with an aperetiv (perfect!) or just as a snack. I suggest to reduce the oil and it would be less sticky for your fingers.

Tried this last night - I thought it was tasty, but I'm not sure how much my husband liked it. I used olive oil, almonds instead of pistachios, and added garlic powder. They weren't what I would consider "crispy" but they weren't soggy either. Great snack - and I'm probably going to use them on salads too.

Hi all. I didn't make this yet, but plan to very soon, it sounds great! BUT, I have a question, what did everyone serve it with? I saw one with a steak, as a side dish. I actually pictured it more like a bowl of nuts kind of thing, with a cocktail... What do you all think? I'd appreciate your suggestions.

The hardest part of the recipe was shelling the pistachios. Otherwise, it was easy, and delicious--spicey! I made as directed, and mine was definitely not soggy--nice and crispy. Great sidedish for a nice, juicy steak.

I have made it two ways. First as a roasted vegetable hot from the oven instead of potatoes. I left a little of the juice from the beans and added more herbs including Rosemary, Sage, Majoram about 1/4 total. Very delicious. I also made it drier and the second time with it I reduced the oil to an 1/8 of a cup which helped make it crisper.

Yes, I rinsed them, and, I forgot to say before, I dried them before tossing with the oil and seasonings. I'm sure that helped to make them crisp.

Quick snack with a nice flavor. I added more cayenne pepper and pistachios. But even though I baked the beans for an extra 8-10 minutes, they still were a bit soft and soggy. Next time I'll increase the oven temperature.

Very good and very easy appetizer. For more spice, I added 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper. The garbanzo beans were not as crispy as the recipe states they would get (they were more on the chewy side) but the flavor was great and unique.
