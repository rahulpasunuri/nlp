This recipe is delicious, and I appreciated the reviews. I discovered after I started making it that I was out of whole almonds, and didn't have either coriander or cumin seeds. I used hazelnuts, and 1 tsp. ground coriander- cumin in place, and omited the cilantro (because I didn't have any, and I don't really like it). The results both tasted and smelled wonderful - we will definitely make it again!

Interesting recipe...I had some leftover raw fennel from Christmas dinner crudites, so I was looking for something to do with it. I ended up only using 1 garlic clove and 1/2 onion to make it more Sicilian (they don't use this much garlic.) The recipe didn't look like it would come together, and I had to add a little water to braise the fennel otherwise it was browning and not cooking thru correctly. I added the coriander seeds with the fennel to make sure they soften and become edible. I also gently simmered way beyond 2 minutes after adding the final ingredients before it tasted correct. In the end, a nice and interesting recipe. I ate it with a puttanesca pasta (only anchovies, tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, no capers or olives). The combo was delicious, very Sicilian. Will definitely make the fennel again.

Delicious as written, but I've also made it substituting Swiss chard for the fennel and adding a bit of sherry vinegar.

Everything was great except for the coriander seeds which gave a soapy flavor every time I bit into one. I omitted the cilantro. Will definitely make again without the coriander seeds.

Making again, first for family, next for new guests. Very good, but the fennel was expensive.

Made this twice this week for guests! First time, I used cumin seed instead of coriander seeds (mistake)--second time, used both. I loved it best the first time! Coriander seemed too strong to me, and turned this lovely dish orange-ish. To die for--fresh, and something different. Also, it's better a bit under-cooked vs. over cooked.

A bit overly complicated in terms of flavors to be elegant. I would remove the cilantro/chervil at the end (it really doesn't need it). I substituted 'crasins' for the raisins because of the color and they were a great match with the coriander. I also reduced the quantity of garlic which tended to overwhelm the fennel..

This was very easy to put together, but I didn't find it as delicious as others. I found that while it smelled delicious, the taste was fairly bland. I did follow the recipe exactly and I'm guessing it's just not my kind of thing.

This is an amazing recipe! We did toast the coriander seed to bring out the flavor, but other than that it is wonderful - the flavors and textures are very rich and delicious.

Made as the recipe suggested, but used ground coriander and added a little red wine to give it some color. Served with rockfish and it was good - even my very picky BF liked it!

I just finished eating a half recipe together with some unseasoned quinoa and it was a delightful, and tasty vegan lunch. Will keep this recipe.

I think this recipe excellent for its wonderful, interesting, diverse flavors. Once the prep work is done, the cooking is very quick! It was so good I quickly made it a 2nd time.

Mine wasn't as pretty as the picture either, but it sure was delicious. I made it in the afternoon, refrigerated it, and brought it back to room temperature for dinner. My husband described it as a little jewel box.

This was spectacular. I couldn't find my saffron so I used turmeric in its place just for the color. The taste was great so I don't think we missed that much. My husband and I just about ate the whole thing!

This is a truly great dish. My wife raved over it. She wants me to make it for visitors.

Great taste and easy to make. I made 2x but doesn't look as 'beautiful' as picture -- much paler & slightly grey. Coriander prominent -- adjust to your preference.

WOW. Any recipe that includes "10 garlic cloves" has my immediate attention, but this is really exceptional.

Really delicious; unusual and easy - good leftovers too!

Outstanding combination. Easy, quick and extremely delicious. No changes necessary, be sure to use all the garlic as it brings out the taste of the fennel.
