Because of the changes, I'll refrain from rating the recipe...like others, I thought this recipe had potential. Other reviews prompted me to make several "test cupcakes", so I could figure out how to make these work. The trick is this: as weird as it seems, breadcrumbs are essential to making it work. I used panko, and spiced it myself with cayenne, salt, and pepper. I lined the cupcake tin with them, put some on top, AND mixed about a quarter cup into the mac n' cheese, right before baking. Using this method, they worked like a charm. In terms of spices -- I used mustard powder instead of the mustard, and added cayenne pepper and a touch of nutmeg. With these changes, I now could easily make them again with no trouble.

Just took them out of the oven. I fried up some pancetta and capers and added them to the mix when I combined the sauce with the macaroni. I also added a bit of cheese to the topping of breadcrumbs. If I make this again and I think I will. I would make more of the cheese sauce mixture as I think that would help them stay together better. I would also add more shredded cheese in addition to the cheese sauce. I'd also use olive oil to coat the muffin tins. I think this recipe has great potential.

This recipe was mostly a flop. I followed the directions to a T, yet my cupcakes stuck in the pan, and when I was able to get some of them out they didn't hold their shape at all. The taste was just okay. Very disappointed.

I look for fun ways to teach math and measuring. I was skeptical about this recipe, but it was a) incredibly easy to make, and b) a HUGE hit! Who knew math could be so delicious!

I made these for my son's birthday party and they were a fantastic hit with both the kids and the adults. I omitted the mustard and instead of straight cheddar I used a mix of cheddar, jack, and parm. Delicious!!

I, too, was skeptical about this--mostly because I didn't think that the mac&cheeses would hold their shapes once out of the cupcake pan. But it worked! Pretty good. With some tweaking, this could really be a hit at some post-ironic american/bbq joint. It will at least be a hit at the next "white trash" party to which I'm invited. ;-) I'll experiment with the cheeses and perhaps even add some sour cream. (ps. i concur: if the recipe sucks so bad, let's hear a reason why.)

-maryberryjuice why did you go into this recipe thinking it was a bad idea? Why is it a bad recipe? I feel if you insist on mentioning that it was so terrible you should probably add reasoning behind it. I found it delightful and fun, and I do like chives ( i feel they are a personal preference)

Great idea. fun finger food for a brunch or a party and the variations are endless I cannot imagine why anyone could not love this

Huh. I'm surprised it's getting such poor reviews--except for the chives (ick) it sounds almost exactly like the recipe my mom always made. I also think the cupcake-sized servings would be terrific for food portioning and freezing for single people.

this recipe is terrible. don't make it. i went in thinking it would probably be a bad idea and was 100% correct. I am experienced in the kitchen, trust me, this recipe is no good.

This is a great appetizer for a party. I used mini muffin tins so they would be the perfect bite size morsel. Grated fresh parmesean cheese on top before putting them in the oven instead of the breadcrumbs. Made one batch as was and second batch I added pre-diced proscuitto. Guests raved about 'em!

I made this last night for a party and put the Mac and Cheese in cupcake wrappers, not very convenient. I would probably only make this in a large dish if I were to do it again. Tasted great, just not easy to eat.

What is the purpose of cooking it in muffin pans?
