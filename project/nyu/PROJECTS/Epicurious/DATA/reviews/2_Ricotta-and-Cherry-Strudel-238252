I changed it around vastly - used filo dough and 8 ounces of cheese, which made still a little too much filling, with 4 oz sugar, the vanilla and 1 egg yolk. I used a pound of already sweetened cherries so added just a half cup of sugar, drained the liquid, did not add it back, and added a little cornstarch to the rest of the ingredients, so the filling wouldn't be too runny. It came out very well.

I made this with the dough recipie provided (which came out fine). Foolproof my butt - maybe if you do nothing but strudels for the next month you'll get it down, otherwise this is anything but a first-try selection. Way too much cheese mixture, you wind up throwing a lot out or over-stuffing the thing. It's just a beast to try and comes out tasking OK, but not a showstopper.

I just made this recipe using phyllo dough. I cut the recipe in half (used two eggs) and used canned cherries as I could not get fresh. It was difficult to roll and I could not tuck in the ends, so I just stuffed some extra phyllo pieces in the end and baked it. It came out beautifully and did not leak out the ends at all. The recipe was very easy to make, just time consuming with the overnight draining of the ricotta. Sauce was great and the roll sliced easily. Am making it again for Father's day as it serves so well at room temp.

This recipe is complicated, time- consuming and turned out bland and unattractive. I used the fillo dough option and the whole thing fell apart as I tried to transfer it to the pan. There's way too much filling for the amount of crust (I ended up throwing out several cups of the cheese mixture. There is no explanation about what to do with the sauce!! I served it on top after it was baked. I will NEVER make this again!
