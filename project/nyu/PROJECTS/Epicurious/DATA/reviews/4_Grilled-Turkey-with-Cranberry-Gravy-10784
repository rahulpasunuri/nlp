Tasty and easy; love the use of lemons. Did this one on the gas grill, without the wood chips. Propped up the turkey on carrots & celery, poured apple cider around it (rather than water) and added some onions. Oh yeah, and I stuffed some butter under the skin. Great flavor. The gravy was a hit, too. I didn't have time for it to reduce, so I did the roux then pulled about two cups of liquid from the turkey pan, put in only about 1/3 of the cranberry puree (used the rest as a cold relish) and boiled it up. Family was happy with the subtle flavors; I was pleased with the richness.

We made this and it was excellent. But we'll return to smoking our turkeys.

I followed this recipe when it first came out, and it was awesome. I'm looking forward to going home to Massachusetts this Thanksgiving to prepare it there. You really cannot go wrong, the results are fabulous. The stuffing and sweet potato recipes that accompany are top-notch too!

My husband and I grilled our first turkey in November, 95 - based on this recipe. He thought I was nuts and would ruin the bird. We have never looked back and my turkey roaster has sat in the attic ever since. Sometimes we use flavored chips and sometimes oranges and apples.... anyway we make it, the bird comes out wonderfully! We use a Kingsford oval charcoal grill - a big oval thing - with a 20-22lb. bird.

I've never liked the usual holiday Turkey - they're usually dry and just not so great. This Turkey, however, was absolutely fabulous. My entire family, some of whom are very picky, loved it!
