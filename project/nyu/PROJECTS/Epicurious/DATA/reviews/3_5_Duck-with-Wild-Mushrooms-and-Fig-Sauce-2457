I was so disappointed with this dish. First off, if you follow the cooking directions for the duck, the meat would be raw. Secondly, the sauce was overpowering. Thirdly, way too many mushrooms! Lastly, it took forever to cook.

Good, but a lot more trouble and not as good as 'Duck with Port- Cherry Sauce' on this site. Also, the method for cooking the duck in the cherry-port recipe is fullproof. (10 minutes of the fat side, 5 minutes on the reverse.)

I actually just needed the fig sauce recipe as I was roasting a whole duck. I used Nouveau Beaujolais(just to use it up) and it actually added to the earthy sweetness of the sauce. It was great and we will make it again and again-

Incredible mix of flavours. Use fresh figs instead to make the sauce. You can improve it by painting the ducks breasts with honey and sprinkling ground coriander, and when taken out of the oven add the duck juices to the mushrooms and reduce at high heat.

i highly recommend this dish- i cut out the caramelized figs and didn't miss them. also, the fig sauce definitely does not thicken despite what the recipe says- i added a spoonful of fig preserve and a teaspoon of constarch at the end and the sauce had a perfect consistency.

Wonderful! We made this for New Year's Eve dinner, served with Roasted fingerling and small new potatoes, string beans and green salad, and it was a real hit. Very good and easy for a dinner party - you can make most of it ahead, and then just pan cook the breasts at the last minute before plating and serving. One suggestion for the reduction sauce - Like other reviewers, I found it did not thicken despite reducing to almost gone. I tried it twice, once with a cabernet, and then with a merlot. I even added some brown sugar to one batch, and honey to the next without success. But then, the second time, rather than just straining the solids, I ran the whole thing through my food mill (that I use for making apple sauce). Then I took the resulting "fig sauce", which still had all the seeds, and pressed it by hand through a small strainer using the back of a spoon. The result was pure gold - a thick, rich and delicious sauce. In fact so thick I ended up adding back some wine and cooking it a little more. So next time I make it (and there will be a next time), I will reduce it by about half or so only before doing my food mill-strainer thing.

Very nice dish. I modify it to grill the duck breasts outside which works just fine. Easy to make at the last minute as long as you make the sauce ahead of time.

Great dish. I made the sauce ahead of time and the flavor really intensified. I used shitake and button mushrooms (husband loved it!) My only gripe is my duck never really crisped up as much as I wanted. I even put it in a very hot oven for about 15 minutes until it was medium rare. Hmmmm, now what to do with the duck fat...

This is fabulous, even when you don't exactly follow directions. I used 1/2 port and 1/2 red wine. Also sauteed shallots in butter and added them to sauce. DId not get thick . . . I mixed in some sauce with the mushrooms and finished chicken breasts in pan with mushrooms. Figs add a nice touch, although if you want to save time, no need to caramelize them. YUM!

Wow. This is impressive. I did not exactly follow the recipe. I used about 7 glazed and roasted figs, which have alot more sugar than this recipe, and two tablesppons of unsweetened Italian fig juice. I had to reduce for one hour. I also used a mix of chanterelles and black trumpets. For the duck, score the skin to prevent curling. Also, duck releases so much fat it is not necessary to add oil to the pan. Just put it skin side down. Served with small potatoes roasted in duck fat with rosemary and cippolinis. It was like something off a 4 star restaurant menu. I also did not do the honeyed figs on the side, as per others recommendations. Served with an Amarone.

To be honest I didn't use duck or figs for this recipe. I used dates instead of figs, chicken thighs instead of duck and I neglected the carmelized portion entirely. However, the sauce was fantastic and the chicken, first fryed then put into the oven for twenty minutes, was moist with a crispy skin. I made the mushroom portion as directed and the whole thing was a great success. I would definately make it again (hopefully with figs next time).

What an elegant dish: the flavours linger on the palate, mmmmhhhh. Yes, the fig dish can be left out,it is far too sweet. The fig sauce needs more time to reduce -I left it on low for an hour 1/2 or a bit more. The duck breast, once seared on both sides, I placed in a 400 oven for 20 min, skin side down - it rendered more fat and it cooked a bit longer. The recipe gives very pinkish rare meat otherwise. Truly wonderful combination of flavours. Try it- you will love it.

Ginger and mushrooms is an inspired combination. a v. good recipe, but I wouldn't bother with the caramelised figs - they're a bit grotty.

This was a delicious recipe. The only thing was the fig sauce never thickened enough. I reduced it for over an hour, and finally stopped because I was afraid it would disappear altogether! It was rich and tasty, but not as thick as I would have liked. I doubled the ginger in the mushrooms and they were fabulous!

Pretty outstanding and made for a great presentation and elegant Christmas dinner; great way to treat and impress the parents. Now using it to impress the girlfriend.

Excellent dish.The sauce really makes it. Try using honey in the reduction, it gives it alittle sweetness.Also if you make the sauce a day ahead leave the figs and the cinnamin in the sauce the whole time. you get an extra intense flavor. The camel figs don't do a thing for this dish. I definetily would make it again

This was pretty tasty, but skip the caramelized figs-they do not add a thing. Also, the sauce takes longer than 30 minutes to thicken. The mushrooms are delicious! That is the part you may need more of. I am keeping this recipe for the mushroom part alone.

Oh man, was this good! Because I like all of my meat well done, I had to cook it longer with precaution not to overcook the duck. I served a friend of mine the leftovers. She loved it so much; I thought she was in ecstacy.

This is really a delicious recipe!! I did however cook the mushrooms to brown for a more intense flavor and added a bit of cornstarch to the sauce for thickening. This was my trial run--now for the gourmet dinner club!!

I made this recipe last night and it was delicious. I used a good merlot for the sauce, but next time would try a cabernat, since I thought the sauce might be better if it was a little less sweet. I increased the cooking time of the duck breasts since we prefer it cooked closer to well done than medium rare. Now that I've practiced, next time I plan to make it for company. Thanks for the terrific recipe.

I made this for guests over the weekend, and it got a wonderful reception! I took my cues from the cook in Boston and left the figs in the sauce overnight for additional flavor, which made a remarkable difference. I found that by the time the sauce reduced to the desired consistency, there really just wasn't enough of it so I ended up making a second batch. I also added fig balsalmic vinegar to the mushrooms (again, thanks to the tip from another reviewer), which proved to be a great complement. Incredible dinner - just perfect for entertaining.

This dish was great; very flavorful. Careful with the wine, ours made the sauce a bit too sweet for our taste.

This was a perfect dish for a dinner party and was truly delicious. The sauce was perfect with the duck. I made the sauce the night before, but left the figs in the sauce overnight. This increased the flavor of the sauce. I then removed the figs - pressing all the juices from the figs into the sauce and reheated. Great with the mushrooms. I also added a little fig balsamic vinegar to the mushrooms for a little extra flavor. Try the asparagus and parmesean puddings (BA 5/00) as a side dish. Great!

An impressive main dish; perfect for a dinner party. Will definitely make again. My only caution: I doubled the recipe and had trouble getting the sauce to thicken.

I made this dish with dried dates instead of figs and it was amazing! I found that I needed to make more sauce than was called for. Also, the mushrooms were a bit bland as an accompaniment, especially compared with the rich and complex flavors of the duck, sauce, and dates. Overall a sophisticated and impressive dish!

We made this dish for a group of 8 and they looooved it! The fig sauce was sweet and a perfect compliment to the duck breasts. The wild mushrooms offered an elegant touch. We're offering it again alongside the Thanksgiving turkey!

I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. It's a fair amount of work and the duck is messy to cook, so I'd only make it for special occasions, but the flavor is superb and the presentation is ultra-elegant.
