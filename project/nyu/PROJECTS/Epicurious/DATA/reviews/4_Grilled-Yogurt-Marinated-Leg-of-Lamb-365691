Made as written, the flavor was wonderful, however, after 24 hours of marinating, the outside of the meat was "mushy". Everyone loved it and had seconds. I'll be transforming the leftovers into a curry dish. I'd make it again but not marinate as long.

Positively delicious! Served with the Bon Appetit salad recommended by another poster. Also a 30-year-old baked rice recipe, which is easy and good. And grilled asparagus. I almost tripled the sauce recipe; next time, I'll just double it.

Great taste. I just had a bit of problem grilling, because of the thickness of the meat. Next Time I would cut in half for more consistency in doneness. Made it for Easter and everyone loved it.

I've had grilled lamb for years for Easter dinner, but thought I'd give this recipe a try. WOW. The spices and yogurt added so much to the lamb and having the extra sauce on the side was fantastic. Don't forget to grill the lemons. They are not only a pretty garnish, but brightened the lamb as well. Servered with grilled asparagus and roasted potatoes with garlic and rosemary. Memorable meal.

As an avowed lamb hater I originally made this for my husband...but I have to say it converted me to a lamb lover! It was fabulous! I agree with previous posts about trimming fat and allowing it to marinade for as long as possible-we did 24 hours. Also agree about making a lot of sauce...ground my own Tabil blend with the accompanying recipie. This will be a keeper made for many spring and summer nights to come.

I agree with other 4 forkers over here. This is a winner recipe! Guests loved it and were asking for the more. Pair it with Greek red wine if you can. Make LOTS of sauce, it goes fast and you will want more. If you start with a nice fresh cut of lamb then you can trim all or most of the fat to avoid flare-ups. Also, the longer you marinate the better, so prepare it the day before cooking if you can. If you have a hard time finding Tabil spice, make your own... Tabil Seasoning Tunisian/Turkish seasoning. Use ground spices: 1 tablespoon coriander seed 1 teaspoon caraway seed 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/8 teaspoon curry powder

Pro: OUTSTANDING Con: Because it tasted so great by itself we didn't use the extra yogurt to dip it in afterward, so I was left with a lot of it.

This is honestly one of the best recipes ever. Only thing I did differently was use lamb loin chops (1 per person) instead of a butterflied leg. Held the fat on the loin together with a skewer as the yogurt kind broke it down. You MUST include the grilled the lemons! This is incredible.

Made this for a Moroccan Dinner Party with a Toasted Quinoa Pilaf, and roasted root veggies. Got rave reviews. I grilled to get a nice char, then finished it by roasting it to the correct temp. Flavorful. Make sure you get the mediterranean(not greek) yogurt for a less thick consistency. The sauce is crucial.

For those that don't like Lamb, it's because they haven't tried THIS recipe. Normally I make my own adjustments, but this one is PERFECT!! We marinaded for a full 18 hours before grilling to rare-med rare and had it with the Mint-Cucumber-Tomato salad that was in Bon Appetit! Grill some flatbreads, serve with Mint Tea (use Fresh mint if you can)and you have a great meal. Next we're trying these on Kebabs!!

Absolutely delicious, will be my go-to recipe for lamb. Used local Cardrona Merino lamb (from Central Otago, New Zealand) and it was wonderfully tender and flavoursome. I must admit that I did up the chilli in the Tabil spice blend, purely for personal preference. I also added 1 tbsp fresh mint, chopped, to the yoghurt sauce.

I made this for a slightly different Sunday lunch, and it was wonderful! The lamb was so moist and full of flavour, and the timings worked out perfectly for the right amount of pink. Living in England we don't really get the weather for cooking outside often enough, so couldn't use a grill, but we cooked it directly on the rack in the oven (Gas mark 7/220 celsius, 450f) for about half an hour and and it worked perfectly. Served with wild rice and a beetroot salad it was a perfect 'summer' sunday lunch! Planning to make it next week too!

WOW. I used lamb loin chops instead, and though it might have been the incredible quality of meat from my butcher shop, this recipe was damn AMAZING. The yogurt really tenderized the lamb overnight. We pretty much scraped off a good portion of the marinade before we set them on the grill...I feared flare ups and charring, and everything turned out wonderfully.

Wow. This marinade resulted in the first ever lamb recipe that Mr has been enthusiastic about! I didn't grill; I instead used a bone-in shoulder roast, marinated for 24 hrs and then plunked in the oven @ 450 for 30 then 275 for another 2-2.5 hrs. Served it with the spiced yogurt sauce & killer cuke+tom+feta recipe that was in this month's BA mag. Aw yeah.

This was excellent. The Tabil Spice Blend was so good w/the yogurt and perfect with the lamb. I used a bone-in leg instead of butterflying but followed the directions otherwise. It could not have been more simple or more delicious. I'll def make this again.
