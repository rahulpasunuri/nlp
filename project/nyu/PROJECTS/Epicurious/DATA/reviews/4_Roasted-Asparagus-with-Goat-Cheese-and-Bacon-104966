WOW...I'm not sure what more I can say...just WOW. I allowed the flavors to meld before placing this dish on the table and it was simply amazing. I will definitely serve this many more times and I'm sure I will receive the same "WOW" reaction every time.

Good recipe but nothing different-bacon, asparagus, and cheese...

Loved the flavor. 500 degrees for 7 minutes was too long -- over-cooked the asparagus a bit, which were definitely "medium" sized. Next time I'd go for 5 minutes instead.

Simple and delicious! I only gave it 3 stars because I didn't include the bacon, so technically don't know what the full recipe tastes like, but even without it it was fantastic. A definite keeper.

Wow. Fantastic. And I used turkey bacon. Can't wait to serve this at Easter dinner!

Wonderful side dish! I took the suggestion from a previous viewer and added chopped roasted hazelnuts and pancetta instead of bacon. Didn't use as much goat cheese as listed. Served at room temperature at a pot luck dinner.

This dish is awesome! Easy, and tastes fantastic. Next time, I might throw in some walnuts, maybe hazelnuts to add a little texture. It would also be fantastic with pancetta.

This was easy to make and the flavors worked together great! I'll definitely make this again.

I made this dish last night to accompany our steak and it was delicious. I made it as written but next time I will take the advice of another cook and drizzle a balsamic reduction over it instead of the olive oil. I made it an hour ahead and served it at room temp. but next time I might try it warm, as soon as the asparagus comes out of the oven. You can't go wrong with this recipe. Fast, easy and delicious.

Truly a great recipe, and super easy to make! Have made this a number of times and always get requests for the recipe. I normally grill the asparagus, rather than roasting in the oven - but either way is delicious.... enjoy!

Didn't have goat cheese so I substituted fresh parmesan and added some minced garlic, Yummy-- and easy to make

This is the second time I've made this recipe. The flavors come together as both smoky and bright. Incredibly easy dish that would be great for any meal...I'm thinking of throwing a poached egg on top for an all-in-one breakfast dish...Delicious!

Easy and delicious. Used "jumbo" asparagus from the farmers market and turned it into a light "supper." Because jumbo asparagus have a tough outer skin (but juicy & delicious inside), I peeled them first. Tossed with a bit of fresh thyme along with the olive oil in the roasting pan. Finished with some chopped parsley - YUM!! Will definitely make this again.

Fulfilled our requirements for a "keeper" - it's delicious, easy, and can be made ahead! We've used goat cheese as suggested, but once we used Havarti because that's all we had in the refrigerator, and it worked well too.

I make this every Christmas to go with our standing rib roast. Easy, flavorful and tasty!

This was excellent. The only thing I changed was I used just the 2 Tbs of olive oil to coat the asparagus and then left the rest off. There was plenty of oil left after roasting.

because i was cooking other things, i oven roasted at 375 and 450 for about 4 mins each and just watched them. i was having a large brunch, so i doubled the recipe. i was shocked when this was one of the first things to disappear! the presentation was beautiful and christmasy and the taste was fantastic. i will for sure make again.

Incredible! A showstopper without any effort. Made this for a baby shower and there were NO leftovers. Everyone raved about this one!

Doubled the recipe with about 6 oz goat cheese. You won't need more, and should probably use less than 2x bacon. The result is outstanding... got rave reviews!

Rating: 4
Excellent dish! I made for Mother's Day brunch. I tripled the recipe with no probem. I used about 8-9 ozs. of goat cheese crumbled and I used the pre-cooked bacon they have available nowadays. I just grilled it indoors on a stove grill without any mess.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely one of the best recipes I've ever found on epicurious.com. Follow the recipe exactly. Make sure to cook the asparagus to crisp/tender. I used a citrus stripper for the lemon peel and had perfect curls of peel without bitter pith. Make this. You won't be disappointed.

i make this every year at thanksgiving or xmas and everyone loves it! I use garlic crumbled feta cheese instead of goat and i stick everything in the oven at the end so the chesse melts a bit. yummy

I made this for the second time, for a baby shower for thirty people. It got rave reviews and several people asked for the recipe... I used about half the cheese and bacon for economic reasons, but it was still plenty.

Rating: 3
Quite flavorful but maybe a bit too much cheese. I wouldn't let it cool off too much it really needs to be served immediately.

I made this recipe and the only change I made was adding sea salt with herbs (Sale Alle Erbe della Marlunghe) before grilling. I have family members that ask me to remake this dish at every gathering.

Rating: 3
I agree with the previous reviewer on swapping lemon juice for balsamic--nice twist. However, I think champagne (or sparkling wine) is an appropriate pairing. I served this on Easter Sunday, accompanied by a honey baked ham and (rich) potato dish. The effervescent wine we served cut through the goat cheese and potato dish nicely. The asparagus remained very crisp when cooked at the high temp. It was delicious! I will absolutely serve this again.

Rating: 2
Its good, nothing spectacular; it makes for a decent side dish. I used chevre, although I imagine a good feta would perform equally well. I'd make the following suggestions: 1.) Use a well-aged balsamic vinegar instead of the lemon juice and zest 2.) In lieu of the bacon, either wrap the asparagus in prosciutto and then grill, or use pancetta. 3) Champagne is an odd pairing. An approriate wine would have enough acidicty to match the lemon (or balsamic vinegar), and yet sufficient body to stand up to the bacon. A young Syrah or GSM would be excellent. If opting for a white, Sauvignon Blanc matches the cheese and asparagus flavors well, and it may be able to handle the bacon.

Rating: 4
Making this dish was a bit disastrous for me; I set off my smoke detector, used too creamy a goat cheese so it all melted into a sauce over the asparagus instead of staying in crumbles like described, and made several other errors in cooking, preparation and presentation, but it was still some of the best asparagus I have ever had. I will definitely make this one again, hopefully soon.

I know I shouldn't review without preparing but, thanks to reviews posted (plus KNOW I'll like it), plan to serve as appetizer for dinner party in two weeks .. thanks, everyone!

Made this for Easter but did not use the bacon or the goat cheese as they were used in other dishes. Did not miss them; everyone loved this preparation of asparagus. Different and easy to prepare.

Popped this in the oven while my roast was resting on Christmas Day. A very easy side to make quickly or ahead of time. Thinner asparagus was all that was available, so it only needed 4-5 minutes in the oven. Tasty and simple!

I made this once with the bacon and once without and it was delicious both ways. I especially love the goat cheese and lemon taste together. Very very good...definitely a fun way to enjoy asparagus

Rating: 3
Very elegant and yummy. I used way less bacon and prefer to grilled asparagus over roasted, although both ways are good. Also, while I prefer most stuff from scratch, I really like Lawry's Lemon Pepper Seasoning when roasting or grilling veggies.

Fast and easy. Most were eaten and the rest held up fairly well in the refrigerator as leftovers. I think these would be better served fresh out of the broiler, though, not room temperature.

Great as is! Turn up the YUM factor with a drizzle of reduced Balsamic vinegar and up the bacon to a high end pancetta! Lovin it!

This is one of the best recipes I have ever tried on Bon Appetit (and I've tried a lot)! I now take this to pot lucks, serve to guests in my home, and ALWAYS get rave reviews! Plus it is so simple! The goat cheese and bacon combination are excellent! Just be careful that when you roast the asparagus in the oven, you don't set the smoke alarm off as I usually do!

This was my contribution to brunch for a bunch of "foodie" friends and everyone loved it. I used turkey bacon to cut down on the fat and it worked really well. I made it a second time for a vegetarian friend and left out the bacon altogher, with equally stunning results.

I love this recipe so much I have made it twice in two days! Once for a group of six women and once for my husband and myself. The first night I made 50 asparagus hoping for extra but I didn't have a single spear remaining. I LOVE that you can do it ahead and it has to be the easiest recipe ever!

I served it at Easter, too...Yummmmmy! I did a little time-saving and bought "pre-crumbled" goat cheese. It was around the same price for regular goat cheese, and tasted great. I think the addition of the lemon juice really wakes up the flavor of the entire dish, too. It also helps to use sea salt when salting the asparagus at the beginning.

This dish seemed kind of blah to me...maybe the cheese I used wasn't tangy enough. It was too soft to really crumble.

This is a great dish for a brunch buffet. It is a snap to prepare, can sit awhile at room temperature and is delicious. I used herbed chevre and substituted pancetta for bacon. I sprinkled the cheese and pancetta in a horizontal line near the base of the asparagus stocks. With the lemon zest sprinkled over the top of the spears...man oh man...IT WAS GORGEOUS!
