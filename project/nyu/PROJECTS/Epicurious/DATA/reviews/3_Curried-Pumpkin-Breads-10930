Good idea, bad reality. This bread was bland and texture was strange. Didn't pair well with anything but butter. Grossness: pulling apart pieces of the bread revealed Mucus-like strings.

From the great mix of ingredients, I was expecting more flavor from the bread. In spite of all the curry powder, onions, butter, and cumin, it remains a bit bland. Good with butter, though, and probably good with any meal that would go well with corn bread, like bbq, chili, or southwestern cuisine. Next time, I'd probably add more onion or maybe even raisins. As other reviewers mentioned, the bread is dense and doesn't quite make 2 regular loaves. Alter the recipe by 1.5...

Loved it and my friends did too. I subsituted fresh pumkin (baked/pureed) and plain yoghurt diluted with alittle bit of water for the buttermilk.

When I came across this recipe, I had to make it. I was getting a couple recipes for mini-breads to give as birthday gifts. My boss loves curry & is always up for trying new things out that I make, so I thought I'd try this out. Not sure what the difference is, but I used some curry seasoning that I already had, in place of the curry powder. I also didn't use the cuminseed. Basically, the bread is good. I think the curry is a little overpowering & needs a bit more sweetness, but I do like it. Add some more butter on it when it's warm, you will find it addicting. Really makes the kitchen smell wonderful. Will try this recipe again!

I brought this work to bread for a celebration brunch. My adventurous co-workers liked it. If your crowd enjoys Indian food, this will be a hit. Some people (very dull midwesterners who think cream of mushroom is soup is fancy!!) hated the curry & pumpkin combination. I would add extra cumin the next time to live it up a bit more.

Very good bread with an original taste, though very dense. It was easy to make and my guests liked it a lot.

I like this bread so much that I made it again to bring to dinner at a friend's house tonight. (I make it in a large pan, instead of little loaf pans). Everyone loved it & it always comes out great. It's a great accompaniment to soup & chili. I'd like to lower the fat in it - next time, I'll try using extra lowfat buttermilk & a little honey as sweetener (in place of the sugar) to displace some of the butter. I'll also substitute 6 egg whites for the 3 whole eggs. But I'll keep making it. It's a winner!

I loved this savory innovation on pumpkin bread. I have 2 adopted Asian Indian kids, and it was a hit. Only tip would be that it doesn't really make 2 full-size loaves; try make 1.5 times recipe.

It was a good idea that just didn't quite work for us. We found the curry flavor too strong.
