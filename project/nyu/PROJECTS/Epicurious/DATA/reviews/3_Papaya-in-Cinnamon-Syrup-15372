I'm also not a fan of papaya but this method brings out the fruit's sweetness and tones down its strange peppery taste. The cinnamon pairs particularly well.

My husband brought me a giant papaya and I didn't know what to do with it because I don't really like papaya. This recipe is sooo easy and it's very good over pound cake. Lovely dessert!
