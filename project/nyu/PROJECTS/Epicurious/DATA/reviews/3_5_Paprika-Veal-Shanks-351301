I couldn't find ossobuco to save my life and wasn't patient enough to order it from a butcher. So I used a pork shoulder and made what I'd call a pork paprikash instead. I used sweet red Hungarian peppers and paprika, and snipped in fresh dill to the sauce at the end of the cooking. This is absolutely delicious, and I'll be making it again come fall.

This recipe was exceptional. I used hungarian wax peppers from a friends garden, substituted an elk roast for the Veal and used a deep cast iron skillet instead of the roasting pan. This is a keeper!

I made this once, and attended a dinner where it was served using non- sweet peppers and regular paprika. My take: use the recommended peppers or other sweet peppers, and be sure to use Hungarian Sweet paprika, the dish is simply not the same without them. Delish!

won't rate this, since I changed it a lot. But wouldn't buy super price-y veal shanks. Used boneless pork roast I had in freezer. Made half recipe. Served with roasted buckwheat groats (also on hand). It was great.

This was excellent. Very easy directions and easy to prepare. I made a couple of substitutions/additions. I added about twice as much Hungarian paprika, a little less peppers (hungarian wax), and a little less sour cream. I also added some sliced cremini mushroom during the last hour of cooking. It tasted just like my mother in law's recipe. (Which is what I was going for, since she passed away a few years ago and we all loved her recipe.) I also served over buttered spaetzle. What a treat!

Very good, very easy. Andy Blue, you have negative comments. First you say the sauce was acidic. However, you admitted that you used twice the amount of tomatoes than the recipe called for. Are you surprised you now have an acidic sauce? And then you complained that you had so much sauce. Well, you said you used twice the amount of ingredients, like what do you expect?

Outstanding recipe. Had eight fro dinner and they were screaming about good this was. The extra sauce days later was fantastic over white rice. Do not hesitate.

These were absolutely fabulous. Followed the recipe as written except for substituting a mix of red bell peppers and anaheim peppers for the cubanelles which I couldn't find. The veal was meltingly tender and the sauce complemented perfectly. Use the best paprika you can find-- a lot of the cheap stuff is just red powder and the paprika really makes the sauce.

Followed the recipe exactly, great depth of flavors. The sauce didn't thicken as well as I would have liked, but could have added more flour and boiled down if I had the patience. Fantastic winter dish, will definately make this one again.

This dish came out very well, although I made some substitutions. My supermarket didn't have veal shanks so I bought beef shanks, meaty beef neck bones, boneless beef chuck steak, and veal steak. I didn't have a 14 oz can of plum tomatoes so I used an entire 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes so as to avoid leftover tomatoes. I deglazed with riesling but the mixture tasted very acidic so I didn't add it to my dish. This dish also took me a LOT longer to prepare than the time given in the recipe (5 hrs vs. 3- 1/2 hrs), and the active time was longer. You end up with a LARGE amount of sauce, but it is very yummy and can be used with other dishes. The sauce is a deep red. My version may not be authentic but it tasted very good and I will definitely make this dish again.
