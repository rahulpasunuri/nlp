After just coming back from Italy, thought I would try this recipe. I followed it exactly and it came out perfect. Tastes just like the Zabaglione we had in Rome. Poured it over fresh fruit. A wonderful light desert!

Delicious and easy! I opted to make ahead and serve chilled over mixed fresh berries. The zabaglione was such a hit that I should have made double what I did. Will definitely make again soon.

Absolutely wonderful! Made this for tonight's dinner party. This was my first attempt at zabaglione and as such had cheesecake and sorbet as a back up. No need. Easy, but elegant rich, cool summer dessert when paired with fresh raspberries and blackberries. This is on my top 10 dessert list.

GREAT recipe. I used this to make zabaglione at home for the first time, after having it out and loving it. There were so many different variations, but I'm glad I chose this one. It came out perfect, and was very easy. To make it even more delicious, I crumbled vanilla meringue cookies at the bottom of the dish, put the zabaglione over, topped with strawberries in a bit of aged balsamic and black pepper, and garnished with whipped cream and more crumbled meringue. Everyone thought it was impressive, but it was really simple to make so it'll become a go-to dessert recipe.

This was my first attempt at zabaglione, following extra yolks left over from making Seven Layers and having a couple problems. Wow! Yum! And I don't like amaretto. Extremely easy, didn't even put it on anything, just in cups with a spoon. Everyone devoured it.

This was a huge hit with mixed berries, layered in tall wine glasses. Beautiful & delicious & quick! I increased the recipe by 1/3 to get enough for 6 people. It became very thick when chilled, so I thinned it with a little milk. I think I will try it with regular instead of whipping cream the next time.

The Zabaglione came out perfect for the bread pudding I made. It was a great compliment to the dessert and was the only dessert out of 4 to completely dissapear at a party I took it to! Everyone enjoyed it. I used my grandmothers homemade portuguese anise (whiskey) instead of the armaretto. It was delicious!
