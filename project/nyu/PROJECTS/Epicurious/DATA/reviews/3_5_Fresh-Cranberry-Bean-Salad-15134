So simple and so good. I added garlic and substituted fresh oregano from my garden for the parsley.

This recipe is a bit hard to rate since I intended to use it only as a loose guide anyway for the cranberry beans. Knew I wanted a bit more heft to the dish to allow it to be a main or side featuring more of my farm share produce. Sautéd a couple carrots and summer squash, added a couple garlic cloves and a red onion, then a few cups of baby kale and braised with about 1/4 cup red wine. Added the beans cooked as described in the recipe. Instead of lemon juice, used apple cider vinegar. Then added hot garlic olive oil, a bit more regular olive oil, topped with parmesan flakes, fresh ground black pepper and a light sprinkle of sea salt. Topped with parsley or celery greens. Could be a hearty main dish for two, but served as a side with Quorn cutlets for a meat-free meal.

Have been making this for years. Found that adding a few garlic cloves to the beans while cooking and then mashing them with the lemon juice and EVOO adds a little more dimension. Sometimes I also add thinly sliced radicchio (about 1/2 small head) to the hot/warm beans and top with parmesan flakes, fresh ground black pepper and a light sprinkle of sea salt always brings rave reviews. Great served with grilled veal or pork chops.

Cranberry beans turned up at the local Hispanic market yesterday and I snapped them up. The lemon/parsley vinaigrette worked perfectly with the mild cranberry beans. They would be great served on a bed or greens or even with some quinoa or another grain as a quick, weeknight meal.

Delicious in its simplicity. I went light on the olive oil and added a couple cloves of smashed garlic to the cooking liquid, but other than that, the version I made was basically the same. Simple, but its charm lies in the simplicity and and freshness. I used parsley, by the way, although I'm sure the basil would have been smashing too.

Great--simple, satisfying, and easy-to-prepare. I used the minimum amount of lemon, and I agree with the previous reviewer--best while still a bit wams, though certainly good when cool, too.

Delightful salad. After a visit to the local farmer's market, I was looking for a different way to prepare October beans. Absolutely delicious, wouldn't change a thing about it. Three forks when made and served while still warm. Note: You'll need about 3 lbs. unshelled beans to equal 1 1/2 cups shelled.
