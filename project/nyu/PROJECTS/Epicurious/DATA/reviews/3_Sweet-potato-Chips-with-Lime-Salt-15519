These were amaing. My guests wolfed them down. I blanched the sweet potato slices first to ensure a crispier chip. Will definitely make again

Really yummy. The lime with the sweet potato is exceptional. We cut thin rounds instead of strips.

Nice, tactful remarks from the New Jersey reviewer...manners not your forte, dear? This goes quite well with crisp a Mexican beer (Sol, Corona or the Puerto Rican Medalla) and other light appetizers.

I've not made this particular recipe, however at a restaurant here in town called Trio, we have an appetizer: Fried Sweet Potato Chips Topped With Melted Stilton Blue Cheese. It is divine and our most popular appetizer. Try it!

Tried the recipe with a deep fryer. (Light Soy Oil)I would recomend fry blanching first to get the potato crisp. Not mentioned in the recipe. Flavor is great. I served it with a Grilled Portobello and Arugala Burger. I heated them up in a hot oven before service.

Served these chips to a group of six recently and EVERYONE raved about them! They were delicious. You simply mix the lime zest with the salt and sprinkle it on. They had GREAT flavor. ENJOY!

you would want the lime zest as the recipe indicates mixed with the salt to sprinle on the hot chips. you know, like a salted potato chip! duh

have not yet made this but am inclined to think that the juice of the limes is to be mixed with the salt.
