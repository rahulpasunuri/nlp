The pastry shell is wonderful. Very flaky and delicious. The filling, however, was way too sweet for me. If I were to make this again, I would halve the amount of sugar.

This is a beautiful dessert to look at and to eat! Serve with ice cream or warm English Custard. I've made many times and enjoy sharing 'what can you do with quince?' with others.
