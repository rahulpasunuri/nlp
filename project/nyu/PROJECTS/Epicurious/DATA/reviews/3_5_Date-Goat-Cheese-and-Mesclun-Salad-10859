I made this simple salad for a dinner party and all seven guests raved about it. This will become a winter favorite.

Flavors are perfect together. The only change I made was arugula and balsamic instead of red wine vinegar.

Very good and quick and easy for weekday meals. I had leaf lettuce in the fridge, so I used that, but in the future I'll use the mesclun... I can see how the flavours would go well together. I also left the dates bigger... I like the chewy texture.

A really nice easy salad. Very good when having company as a light salad.

Simple, quick to prepare, delicious. Instead of the vinaigrette listed I made the tangerine/walnut oil dressing from "Salad of Fall Greens with Persimmons and Hazelnuts" from this site. I used pomegranate vinegar instead of the balsamic and passed around fresh pomegranate seeds to sprinkle on top, the pom stuff courtesy of Trader Joe. My guests loved it! Even with soup before and the knowledge of many dishes to come everyone had seconds of salad.

This is one of the best salads, and very easy to prepare. Make sure you get fresh dates.

I cooked all day to make an elaborate meal, and threw this salad together at the last minute. I added hazelnuts for crunch, which went very well with the sweet dressing and tangy goat cheese. Everybody raved about this salad, more than any other dish, and I even made lobster bisque. Delicious!

Simple - make this for your guests and they will inhale it. The dressing - well - we're cooking here so go for what you like. More less whatever - but whatever you do - do not skimp on the good stuff!

There is too much oil in the dressing. If I made this again, I would use about half the amount called for. The salad was good, but the dressing was just ok.

Heavenly!! I practically inhaled this salad, and can't wait to make it again for friends and family. I love the goat cheese (used Yellow Rose Chevre)- but remember, a little goes a long way. And I agree with a previous reviewer about using less olive oil. You can't go wrong with this salad! So easy and impressive.

Love it, love it, love it! This is such a different salad, and it's just wonderful. The sweetness of the dates, the mildness of the goat cheese, the tanginess of the dressing...Yuuuummm! Some changes: I did not use as much oil as the dressing recipe called for. In fact, I think too much oil would take over the other ingredients of the salad. Also, I would advise not to make the dressing ahead of time. I found leftovers didn't taste as great after some time spent in the fridge.

I now use 'light' olive oil. The virgin, or extra virgin incorporates too many dominate flavours and scents.

Outstanding salad. One of our guests says he "hates" eating salad. His wife called the next day for this recipe. What better compliment!
