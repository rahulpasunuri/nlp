Used any thick yogurt (liberte, greek-style, etc) plain and added the honey to taste, and cinnamon. Let sit at least an hour. Yummy! Can also add vanilla yourself. Less overpowering. Or strain the yogurt. The texture of the yogurt you use will determine the end result.

I used plain greek yogurt instead of vanilla, but followed the recipe other than that. I felt like the dip turned out very thin and almost watery. Very disappointing. I'm thinking about whipping in some cream cheese...

I just made this dip for a plate of cut fruit for a gathering. It was so good people asked for the recipe. I made it without honey, because one of the people there is diabetic. I substituted non-sugar sweetner. It was excellent. I used thick plain yogurt, added vanilla extract, and the cinnamon as given.

quite sweet, but nice. I might make it again because it was so simple

Loved this! I used plain organic yogurt lower in fat. I switched the portions up too. Only used 1.5 cups of yogurt, 1/4 cup honey, 1 tsp cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla extract. It's awesome with fruit and even as a topping over crepes with fruit! I could probably decrease the honey even more.

I found this recipe when looking for a way to use 2 leftover bananas. I used Greek yogurt. Add the ingredients carefully to taste. I used the dip as a base, added sliced bananas, whipped cream and dusted with chocolate powder.

I served this with a quiche for mother's day brunch and it was excellent. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used plain, Greek yogurt. It was just sweet enough and paired particularly well with apples, peaches and blackberries. Yum!

just like the last reviewer, I used greek plain yogurt and it was fabulous. even my six year old loved it. For those that thought it was too sweet, I think using plain yogurt vs vanilla will make all the difference in this recipe.

I've used this recipe a number of times and it's always a big hit. I use the heavier Greek yogurt which you can get in reduced or low fat from Trader Joe's.

I took this to our wine club party with strawberries, red grapes and blackberries and it was a hit -actually it was the only food that was totally gone! I used Light n'Fit yogurt which I think was a little bit thinner but it tasted great. Also it really does need to sit in the fridge for at least an hour for the cinnamon flavor to really catch on.

I saw this recipe in Bon Appetit in the 80's. It was made with plain no-fat yogurt. I prefer that version.

sickeningly sweet! Try using original yogurt and cutting back the honey.

I haven't tried this dip so I can't rate it, but I noticed in a lot of the reviews that people took this to a party and then complained that it went untouched. I have yet to go to a party where a fruit dip was a hit. There is usually so much food at big parties that the last thing someone is going to go for is a fruit dip. At least that's the last thing I go for.

This was too sweet -- I would have preferred just the yogurt alone without the honey. Nothing special.

I love using this recipe as a brunch "appetizer" item for guests to enjoy while sipping mimosas. I use bite sized pieces of cantalope, honeydew and strawberries with a scattering of blueberries, served with lots of funky toothpicks for spearing and dipping. It's addicting!

I was very disappointed with this dip. I served it at a party, and it remained untouched. I tried it and liked the fruit better plain than with the dip. The dip was too cinnamony, and not that good. I will definitely not make it again. I agree with the one reviewer that said it tastes better with the less sweet fruit (e.g., mango). On a positive note - it was very easy to make - it took less than 5 minutes.

We just had this with apples and pears for dessert, and were pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was. It is so easy to make and so healthy compared to most desserts! I will definitely make this again, and again, and again...

Delicious! My only recommendation is to use a yogurt with a thick consistency. I tried it with low fat yogurt and it was very runny. I kept it in the refrigerator overnight thinking that it would thicken up but it didn't. I ended up pitching the first batch and making it again with full fat yogurt and it was much better. VERY TASTY!

I made this for work, and have had many, many requests for it since. It was a huge hit! Goes very well with pineapple, strawberries, bananas, etc.

This is always a hit, but a little bit sweet for my taste. I often make it with plain yogurt and just add vanilla extract for additional flavor.

I'm in the minority on this recipe. I made it for a large party and it was untouched. I had more success with a (much, much less healthy!) cream cheese dip.

This was such a light and delicious dessert for a hot evening. I only had fresh pineapple instead of a mixture of fruits. I will definatly be keeping this recipe on hand as my standard fruit dip.

Very easy and delicious. I like to serve this dip with fruit and either shortbread or vanilla flavored cookies.

Very sweet. Personally, I'll use it again only if the fruit is not sweet enough to eat unadorned. But it made a delicious addition to our oatmeal the next morning, and I think it would be a good topping for pancakes or waffles.

This made a huge amount of dip. The only thing I would change would be to add more cinnamon. I will try it again when Michigan's produce looks better than it does right now! It was refreshing and creamy.

So simple and so good!! I combined black plums, kiwi, peaches and red grapes. There was more than enough of the dip. I'll use this recipe again.

I tried this recipe out yesterday. I wanted a light dinner, so I made a fruit salad with blueberries, canteloupe, blackberries, raspberries, and fresh pinepapple. I made the dip with a little extra cinnamon. This was such a delicious dinner. The honey yogurt dip was so much better than I thought it'd be! I'm planning on bringing it to my stepsister's for Easter next weekend!

This was a great, simple recipe. I served it with slices of Jimica, sweet potato, carrots, pear, strawberries, grapes, and celery. Worked very well with these sweet veggies! Wonderful picnic lunch with cheese, sausage, bread and wine!

I used a little less honey because I was afraid it may be too sweet. I made this for brunch for a group of friends, and it was a hit! Delicious!

It was better than I anticipated it to be. Also I think that it makes twice the amount that you need. I had a huge platter of fruit but I didn't even use half of the dip. It was kind of a waste.

Try adding about a tablespoon of orange juice concentrate to the dip. Makes a creamy dip with a slight citrus tang. YUM!

Delicious and easy! I served this at a baby shower and no one even knew it was yogurt!
