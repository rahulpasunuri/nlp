I made this recipe and also added 1 clove of garlic and a good handful of finely chopped cilantro. In addition, I only added 1 teaspoon of salt. I took it to the farm market (we participate in Middletown, NY) and people asked if I SOLD this!!! We did the best business that day!!! A little 'doctoring' and this recipe is a winner!

The taste is very bland - pretty much just salty tomatoes. I added a clove of garlic and a couple of sprigs of cilantro which made this into a more authentic and flavorful salsa. If you like your salsa the least bit spicy, also add some finely chopped jalapeno or hot sauce. Otherwise, if you like your salsa as mild as can be, this recipe plus some garlic and cilantro should make this into the perfect salsa for you. Additionally, I thought the 2 teaspoons of salt this recipe calls for would make it overly salty. I used about 2/3 of that amount and it was just about perfect.

A pleasant, fresh taste. The salt is important.
