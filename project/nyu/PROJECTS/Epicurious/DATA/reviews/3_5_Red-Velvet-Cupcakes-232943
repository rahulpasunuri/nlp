I have a couple issues with this recipe. Fist of all, it's written terribly. Why is the flour listed first when you don't need it until much later in the process? And why is the water listed in between the food coloring and cocoa? While I'm on the topic, the amount of food coloring is WAY too much. I used half the amount and I can taste it in the cupcake. It was also a little dry. The only thing I liked about this cupcake was the density. I doubt I will make this again.

Good flavor, but incredibly dense! Not sure I would make again - I like my cupcakes to be a bit lighter.

I won't rate this recipe because I made some serious modifications. First, since I was making it to take to my grandparents, I used sugar/splenda baking blend. It was the first time I used the stuff and it made them VERY sweet. Definitely use less when using that stuff. Second modification, I used sour cream instead of buttermilk. Third, I upped the cocoa by half and cut some of the red food coloring. Overall the texture is great. I made them yesterday and am frosting them today and they are extremely moist and tender. I am going to use a super cheesy cream cheese frosting to hopefully help cut the sweetness of the cake and keep the sugar lower.

This was everything a cupcake should be:moist, tender, and sweet. Great taste. I used an orange frosting on top, and this recipe is now a keeper!

I'd been looking for the perfect red velvet cupcake recipe and found it here. I wanted one that uses buttermilk and one that called for regular flour, not cake flour. I baked them for 15 minutes and they turned out moist and delicious with a beautiful crumb. I used Ina Garten's cream cheese frosting and it was superb. Even my husband, who gave up sugar and flour years ago was tempted by these.

I made this for a family gathering and the cupcakes were a hit! I added 1 extra tablespoon of cocoa powder and only used about 3/4 of an ounce of food coloring and the turned out perfect. I did make cupcakes out of this and the cake was moist, flavorful and plenty red in color. This is definitely one of my new favorite recipes!

The cupcakes were good. I did find that the food coloring was a bit much, so I used a gel paste based red and the color turned out very rich.

I too was underwhelmed. I figured that since the proportion of good reviews was larger than the "meh" reviews, I'd give it a shot. The cake was moist, but quite dense, and tasted basically like cake mix with a bit of cocoa in it. I had to make some adjustments due to availability of some of the ingredients (we live in the UK and I haven't been able to buy buttermilk so I used a combination of cream, milk, and vinegar as a buttermilk substitute). I used store-bought natural food colouring, and it resulted in a reddish brownish rather than the deep red of red velvet. I had to bake it for 30 mins at 350F - not sure why. I don't know all of these are reasons why mine came out a bit dense and almost too moist for my liking. There was a nice crumb but packed too tight. The one redeeming quality about trying this recipe was that I paired it with a mascarpone cream cheese frosting, which was AMAZING (cream together 250g mascarpone, 30g butter and add icing sugar until it's the right consistency.)

This was a good cupcake. Tangy with a little chocolate taste and not too sweet. I substituted reduced beet juice for the red food coloring, which didn't work. The cupcakes are muddy brown vs. red, but delicious, so who cares? I also used cake flour vs all purpose.

I grew up in Michigan and had no dea what red velvet was... however, marrying into the military has opened my eyes to many regional classics around the country and the world. I followed this recipe and eversince's advice (2 tsp of vanilla and slightly undercooking them a day ahead of time) and baked the world's greatest batch of red velvet cupcakes ever! I plan on making them again soon for my son's first birthday!

This is the same recipe my mother has used however we always have it with a creamy fluffy vanilla roux based cooked frosting. But otherwise a true southern recipe. I do think that Red Velvet is an acquired taste however be warned once you have acquired it, it will never leave you! I've been amazed with the popularity of red velvet in the past year when it was my mothers "specialty" when I was 10 yrs old,, now 48. But please Ya'll, don't mess with success of a tried and true southern delicasy!I'm not sure about people who review a recipe when they don't follow the recipe ?? the Chemistry is what makes redvelvet unique, it shouldn't taste like chocolate cake!

Have made these many times now, and get many requests from friends for these cupcakes. Hate to sound cocky, but many say these are better than the best red velvet at the local big name bakeries! A couple of notes: this recipe makes two dozen standard-size cupcakes. Let the batter sit so the ingredients can marry before putting it into the tins to bake (I make the batter, then put the liners into the tins and clean up a bit so the batter can rest). Add an extra teaspoon of vanilla. Under-bake them a bit for the moistest result: put them in, set a timer for six minutes, rotate the tins between racks and turn them, repeat, and then start testing them with a wooden tester every minute or two. The cupcakes are at their best and are most moist the next day, so bake them the day before, store them in an airtight container (not in the fridge), then ice and serve the next day. They look best in aluminum cupcake cups, or in doubled paper cups (when you use a single paper cup, it soaks up grease from the cupcakes and gets transparent and unappetizing to look at).

This is my go-to red velvet cupcake recipe. It's very dense and perfect with cream cheese frosting. I half the red food coloring and bake it for the full time.

Rating: 3
Made the recipe as is except that I cut back the red food coloring to .5 oz as others have done. Cake was plenty red! I was expecting something a little different with this Southern classic, and the taste was! Not too rich or sweet, fun color and coupled with a simple buttercream made it a perfect valentines treat!

Nothing to write home about. I used less than half the food coloring and it was fine. I think I'll try using raspberries instead of food coloring to get some extra flavor next time.

Great results--I iced with a cream cheese frosting. Would have given 4 forks, but I think the recipe itself is too complicated. I sifted the flour, salt, and cocoa together (I added an extra tbsp cocoa and subtracted a tbsp of flour). I mixed the water,food color, buttermilk, and vanilla together (1 ounce food color is plenty, just add an extra 1 ounce of water). Then I alternated wet and dry to mix it all together. I still added the vinegar and soda at the end--not sure if it makes a difference, but my experience tells me not to mess with the leavening.

The quintessential cupcake, right? I'm actually not a huge fan of red velvet, so my review might be skewed. The cupcakes were moist and soft and still held their own against the lavender and Earl Grey ones. I would make them again, but red velvet (the idea of, not so much this recipe) is about as basic to me as vanilla and chocolate.

I made these cupcakes last week with good results. The only changes were to use 1.5 T red food coloring and apple cider vinegar. The cupcakes were a little dry, but I frosted them with vanilla buttercream frosting so everyone raved about them. The red color was pretty.

Very average on flavor. Nothing special with this recipe.

These are pretty yummy. I used cake flour and only .5oz of food coloring plus 1.5 oz of water and they were a very nice red color. I used a vanilla cream cheese icing.

This cake was underwhelming. I followed the suggestion of adding 1/4 cup of cocoa. And it still came out 'menh'. It's not that is tastes terrible but that there's no there there. And I used food colouring paste, which didn't have the desired results. It's a reddish brown, more light brown. The one good thing is that this cake is tender and light, even with AP flour. I don't know if the flavour will develop with time, we'll see. But I definitely won't make this again.

ps: no need to make the paste as outlined; I put the cocoa with flour/salt and coloring with egg mixture as another cook suggested. :)

My wife wanted something sweet so I surprised her with these cupcakes; delicious and will definitely make again. Used only 1 oz. red coloring as suggested, which was plenty. Used dark cocoa, real butter & plain lowfat yogurt instead of buttermilk. Filled cups 2/3 full-made 27 perfect sized cakes. Bake time=20 minutes. Simple butter/cream cheese icing. As good as any red velvet cake I have had before! She loved them!

These were a huge hit. I only used 1 oz. of red food coloring, but other than that followed the recipe & thought they were great. For the frosting, I used the recipe from "triple-layer carrot cake with cream cheese frosting" (and halfed the powdered sugar in the frosting).

It was great. I made it with the kids at camp and they really enjoyed it, but I think the staff enjoyed it the most! It took an extra 5 minutes to bake than stated in the recipe and I would have liked to try it with butter but we only had margarine on hand. Great recipe!

I used homemade buttermilk and the recipe came out fine. Alittle sweet for me but the family loved them

Took closer to 30 minutes to bake @ 350 degrees. Substituted sour cream for the buttermilk as another user suggested, though did NOT substitute shortening, because I love butter that much. Cupcakes came out divine: moist, flavorful and delicious! (Also added an extra half a tablespoon of cocoa powder.) Only added a 1/4 cup of dry ingredients at a time to mix this time: My cakes always come out too dense for my taste, but these were just right! Hooray!

These weren't bad, fairly bland, not really as flavourful as I would have liked. Apart from being red it would be hard to distinguish them from a cake mix cupcake. Underwhelming.

Having eaten red velvet cupcakes from Buttercup bakery in Manhattan (they're to die for), I was a bit skeptical when making this recipe. Decided to make it anyways.. worst case scenario, toss them out and call it a loss. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding an additional tablespoon of cocoa powder and made some cream cheese frosting. I made them in a mini cupcake pan and baked for approx 10 min at same temp. Upon first eating them that day they were a bit pasty in my mouth but everyone else liked it. Gave it a day to dry out a bit (sounds weird) but tasted pretty good! Would totally make it again.

I was hesitant on making these because of the not so good reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and the only problem I had was the cooking temp and time. After 20 minutes at 350, they were not cooked. I raised the temp to 375 and cooked them for another 10 minutes and they were perfect. I iced them with a butter cream frosting. They were excellent. I think I will go and have another!!!

this recipe is pretty bad if you make it as is but...when i made it i did not make cupcakes i made regular cake all you have to do is mix all the ingredients together in one bowl then poor into a 9 by 9 cake pan and cook 5 extra minutes trust me this is the way to do it !!!!! this was better then any other cake iv ever had

These turned out very greasy and too airy for my taste. They looked pretty, but I'd use another recipe to get a better flavor and more dense texture.

Made this recipe exactly as directed with one exception -- I accidentally only bought one ounce of red food coloring, so I substituted an ounce of water for the missing liquid and wondered if they'd be red enough. Well I shouldn't have worried -- these babies turned out beet red. I can't even imagine what they would have looked like if I'd used the full 2 oz! On their own, the cupcakes are a bit plain, but paired with the vanilla cream cheese frosting recipe from this site they were heavenly. (I did make many changes to that recipe though after reading other reviewers' suggestions-- see my review there.)My husband, who usually doesn't like sweets, couldn't get enough of these cupcakes.

Followed the advice of one reviewer, and used three quarters shortening, the rest butter. Also replaced the buttermilk with sour cream (but was running low on sour cream and had to replace part with whipping cream); added a bit of extra vinegar to make up for the loss of the tartness the buttermilk would have provided. Added an additional tablespoon of cocoa powder. To cap it off, added 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne with the dry ingredients; chocolate, vanilla and cayenne in combination are supposed to be an aphrodisiac! Try it yourself and have fun testing the outcome. Anyway, got raves on these cupcakes, even from die-hard Red Velvet devotees. Several people asked what the very subtle, warm aftertaste was; of course it was the cayenne, which, in this amount, didn't make the cakes spicy, but provided an intriguing finish. Frosted them with vanilla-cream cheese icing, the recipe for which is on this site.

I have been baking red velvet cakes professionally for a number of years. I use basically the same recipe above with the following alterations: shortening instead of butter (more tender crumb) sour cream instead of buttermilk (richer and moister) mix the baking soda with the dry and mix the vinegar with the wet or cream with the butter/sugar. Watch carefully so it doesn't overbake. You should have a very flavorful, moist red velvet cake.

The cake turned out well (I made a one-layer cake, rather than cupcakes). However, it was not very flavorful at all. I was disappointed. Tasted like bland yellow cake dyed red.

These cupcakes were very moist and tasty! I made them with vanilla frosting and they got rave reviews. I will definitely make them again - maybe for valentine's day - they are VERY red!

The instructions to create a paste out of the food coloring and cocoa wound up being messy and unnecessary. Add the food coloring along with the eggs, and sift the cocoa in along with the flour and salt.
