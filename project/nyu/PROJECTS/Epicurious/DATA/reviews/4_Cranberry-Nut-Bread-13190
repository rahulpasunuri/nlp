Excellent! This is a 'KEEPER' - altered the recipe with help here - THANKS ALL! - gave one to a neighbor as Christmas gift, she loved it! Hints - Alterations I used 8 oz dried cranberries, soaked them in o.j. for maybe 45 min to 1 hr. in o.j. just to cover. When ready, I used the juice with the berries and used the add'l three- fourths cup of o.j. I cut the sugar by 3 Tbsps., use the full orange zest. Next time I will use the Grand Mariner. I used salted butter ((Oh the horror!)) used maybe one-fourth tsp of the salt, one-third cup of sour cream, increased nuts to one- half cup. Preheat oven to 350F degrees but turned it down to 325F after putting into over. Also had to play with the timing bcuz I used four small loaf pans, not the large loaf pan. It was very tasty!

This was a very nice "quick bread". the butter made it much lighter than with oil I cut back on the sugar also which also made it lighter (-3 tbsp)

Very nice, my husband loved this. It was so wet at first that I worried it wouldn't bake properly and, the first time I tested it, it was totally brown on top and totally raw inside. I kicked the temperature down quite a bit and, 20 minutes later, it was perfect. Since I use an oven thermometer, I would conclude that you're better off cooking this bread longer at lower heat to get it done properly.

This was AMAZING! I used a little bit more cranberries than called for and cooked for 1 hr. Also left out nuts. Turned out perfectly, complements all around.

I used 2C cranberries (whole) and upped the nuts. Batter was so laden and heavy that it didn't rise properly. Even so, the bread was delicious. Next time I'll back off a bit on the extra berries and nuts.

Thanks to all the foodies who reviewed this and helped me to make a great bread. Added an extra egg, 1/3 cp light sour cream. ALL the zest from 1 large deep colored orange, 1 tsp orange oil, doubled cranberries (coarsely chp) and doubled walnuts. Baked 1 hour. Easy, moist, not at all crumbly. Looked and smelled great. Will probably use Grand Marnier instead of orange oil, but was making for a friend who cannot have alcohol

I have a large sour cherry tree and decided that a cranberry nut bread recipe could serve as the basic, with a few modifications. This recipe proved perfect. Changes made: Used pitted whole sour cherries in place of cranberries. Used slivered almonds in place of walnuts. And to make it more healthy, used canola oil instead of butter. Of course, I no longer needed to make a crumb of the flour, which actually made the process faster. Like others had found, it baked more quickly than the recipe claimed, mine was done in one hour. I plan to use it again, with a few more adjustments. Next time I'll use a bit less sugar as I found the bread too sweet, even with very sour cherries!

Rating: 3
really unique method for a quick bread. i've made a lot and I have never seen one like this where you make a crumb of the flour and butter instead of beating the butter. very tasty. the only cautionary note is that it certainly does not need to bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes. I baked it for 55 minutes and it was completely done.

Rating: 4
Loved this bread! In order to make it healthier, I used 1 cup of whole wheat and 1 cup regular flour. I also only added 1/2 stick of butter to the flour and then added 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce to the egg/orange juice mixture. Definitely add more cranberries. I added 1 1/2 cups and easily chopped them in the food processor. This will be my "go to" recipe for cranberry bread!

Rating: 4
Fabulous! I added 1/3 cup sour cream to make it less crumbly. Doubled the cranberries. When it was first out of the oven I spooned a glaze over it so it soaked in. to make soaking glaze: 1/2 cup was fresh squeezed orange juice, 1 TBSP Grand Marnier and 1/2 cup powdered sugar. cool on racks.

Rating: 3
This was very good, I did make some changes as suggested: added 1/3 c sour cream, double cranberries and didn't chop them, which I will do in the future. It's just a lot of tart per bite with them whole. Oh and I added vanilla, around 1 T. I will for sure make it again!

Wow... this is the best cranberry walnut bread I've ever made! I've been trying recipes out these past few weeks and this is definately the winner! The idea of crumbing the butter into the flour/sugar mixture is genius! After it was done baking I just had to try it out, the crunchy crust looked too good! The bread came out extremely light and fluffy, exactly what I was looking for. I wasn't able to add the orange zest, but I'm sure that'll kick it up. This recipe is a keeper!

I used this recipe last Thanksgiving and, although it tasted great, the center sank instead of being flat or slightly domed. I make several quick breads every Thanksgiving and this is the only variety I have this problem with - not just this recipe, cranberry orange nut bread in general. Any ideas?

Rating: 4
Doubled the recipe without any problems. I was going to bring this to BF's family's Thanksgiving so was using the smaller disposable loaf pans. I was able to make three loaves. Baking time was reduced to 1 hour but I thought that may have been too long as the loaves appeared dry. But I tested one this morning and it was moist and really good. I used the zest of two oranges and the juice which turned out to be only a cup. I made up with 1/2 cup of apple juice. No other modifications. Lovely recipe.

I make this every year - it's always a big hit. I use tangerine juice and zest instead of orange and pecans instead of walnuts.

This recipe was great. I doubled it and used slightly smaller loaf pans so I got four loaves. I cooked them for about 50 minutes since they were smaller and they came out great. I upped the walnuts to 1 cup. I used all the zest from a large navel orange as well as the fresh juice from the orange. Perfect for freezing or giving.

This recipe made good (not great) muffins. I think I'll add more orange zest next time. Despite using 1 T of zest, it didn't have as much orange flavor as I would like. Maybe some cinnamon would be nice? Not sure what, but it needs something else. The texture was great, though. I'll definitely use this base for other kinds of bread/muffins.

This was great! I used dried cranberries and pecans as substitutes. If I were to use the dried fruit again I would cut the sugar back to 3/4c. Very moist and full of flavour. Looking forward to making it using fresh/frozen cranberries.

Loved it! The whole family devoured it. I made it in the evening, as muffins, they were so good, we ate them all for desert! I erroneously put two cups of cranberries (the whole small bag). I did not bother to cut them and it was great this way. I was also liberal with the zest and orange juice. For sugars, I cut the white sugar in half, added brown sugar and 1/4 cup of molasses. I think this has become my new base for muffins. You can do anything with a start like this. :)

This bread was okay- very moist and had a nice texture- my main complaint was that the orange flavor was too subtle. It just tasted like a generic sweet bread w/ cranberries. I did use dried orange zest from Penzey's, so next time I'll use a generous amount of fresh. I also substituted half the butter with applesauce, use dried cranbrries and cut the sugar a bit (maybe 1/4 cup?), and I think those changes worked.

Watch the cooking time. Mine burned before an hour was up.

What I liked about this recipe is that it wasn't overly sweet. In the future I'll use dried cranberries. Cutting up all the fresh cranberries was the most time consuming part of the recipe. I also skipped the nuts because I was making other quick breads for the holidays with nuts. A great standard recipe to keep on hand - especially around Christmas-time.

Very easy to double, triple (ie multiply) this recipe. I chopped the walnuts & cranberries in the food processor, respectively. Quick! As others recommended I made these modifications: increased egg amount; added lemon juice; added lemon extract; added more orange peel. I made small loaves to give away so cooking time greatly reduced. Very flavorful and prettily flecked. ALSO made this gluten- free substituting the flour, leavening with a Pamela's Baking Mix type mix (homemade). Came out great!

This is an excellent recipe as is or with variations. I usually up the cranberries to 1 1/2 cups as a previous reviewer suggested. I've made it with 1/4 cup butter + 1/4 cup applesauce with great results. I've also made it using powdered egg substitute instead of the egg and 1/4 cup shortening and 1/4 cup applesauce instead of the butter to accomodate my daughter's egg and dairy allergies also with very good results!

I've made this recipe twice. The first time I followed the instructions, with the exception of using pecans instead of walnuts. It came out really well. The second time, I took other reviewers' advice and substituted 1/4 c. unssweetened applesauce for half the butter. There wasn't a marked change in texture or flavor, and I think this is a great substitution. I added the applesauce when I had finished incorporating everything except the liquid and cranberries/nuts. I also upped the amount of cranberries the second time to about a cup and a half. I think the recipe calls for too few. The bread did need about half an hour to cool but I did not have any trouble cutting through it. All in all, an easy and delicious bread!

This one's a keeper! I made this into muffins with a few minor changes - I used 3/4 c. dried cranberries, plumped up with some hot water. Used salted butter (normally all I have on hand) so just a pinch of kosher salt worked fine. Reduced baking time to about 25 min. and got 12 delicious muffins. Very moist and flavorful!

Based on previous reviews I made the following changes to the recipe: increased orange zest to zest of one whole orange, increased eggs to 2, doubled cranberries to 2 cups, doubled walnuts to 2/3 cups, added 1/3 cup sour cream, juice of 1/2 lemon, 1 tsp orange oil and decreased orange juice to 1/2 cup. With these changes, it was delicious and very moist!

Ditto on fantastic! Baked it this morning (as a trial for holiday gifts) and it's all gone; even my 7 year old loved it. I followed the recipe with the following additions: 1/4 cup sour cream and zest of an entire orange and a lemon, also doubled the cranberries and the nuts (pecans). Baked it in 2 8" loaf pans for one hour. Great crust (the reviewer with the muffin idea is on the right track) and moist even if still a little crumbly. But I love the taste and will make this again and again. A definite keeper.

I made two loaves of this bread with some minor adjustments based on the complaints found in previous reviews: in both loaves I used 2 eggs instead of 1. Then in one loaf I followed the recipe exactly and in the other I halved the butter and substituted 1/4 c. unsweetened applesauce. I could hardly tell the difference between the two and did not find the one with the full amount of butter to be greasy or unusually crumbly. This is definitely one I plan to make again!

Rating: 4
This was fantastic. I also used orange and lemon juice as recommended, along with the sour cream. Made for a delicious, very moist result. I upped the cranberries a bit but next time would double them... could definitely handle more fruit. Can't wait to make this again.

I made this last night and most of it is already consumed! A few tweaks suggested by previous reviewers helped: I used 1/2 cup freshly-squeezed OJ and 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, plus the zest from both fruits. Once the batter was nearly mixed, I added about 1/4 cup or so sour cream to address the crumbly texture noted by previous reviewers. The recipe will tolerate more fruit and nuts than is called for: we used 1/2 cup more cranberries and a heaping 1/3 cup chopped pecans. In a word - fantastic! The sweet-tart combo was nicely balanced. We all like the browned edges a lot, so my next attempt will be muffins, where more surface will be exposed to the pan.

This bread is just okay. I made some changes to make it healthier. Instead of butter, 1/4 cup yogurt and 1/4 cup oil. I also used extra cranberries. It ended up tasting kind of bitter, which I don't like. It only took about 50 minutes to bake, so be careful and watch it in the oven. The recipe says bake for 1 1/4 hours, but I've never made a quick bread that takes that long. Probably won't make this again without some major changes.

I always think it is funny when people review a recipe and then say that they made it completely different, and here I am about to do it... I love this bread and I have to share a very tasty variation on this one.. instead of orange juice I used 2/3 c meyer lemon juice and instead of zest I added 1 Tbsp finely chopped rosemary(stolen hidden ingredient from a coffee shop in SF)! To make it more moist I cut the sugar by a third and added 1/2c. vanilla yogurt, and 1/2 tsp vanilla, I also use whole wheat flour and a third less butter, no nuts and extra cranberries 'cause I love them so...

I have made this cranberry loaf every year since it appeared in Gourmet in 1991 it is a family favorite that they can't be without come the holidays. I could not find my old worn copy this year and logged on with fingers crossed that it would be on the site. Since I have found it I thought I'd add that this loaf is best if it cools completely, I actually refrigerate it for a few hours before I slice it with a sharp thin blade then let it come to room temp. I always sprinkle the top with a tablespoon each of cream and sugar, mmmm the best sweet crunchiest of toppings.

I made it just as the recipe was stated - although it was crumbly it was delicious!!!!! - I made two smaller loaves and they got rave reviews over Thanksgiving (one loaf I sprinkled the brown sugar - I will stick with that next time - i liked the added crunchy sweetness) - I may try the applesauce next time to see if the bread won't crumble as much but my mom said that these kinds of breads were designed that way - they were called refrigerator breads - I also will add more nuts and berries next time

I admit I didn't make the recipe as listed, and followed the advice of the previous reviewer and added 1/4 sour cream to make it more moist and less crumbly, plus added more orange zest because I love it so much.

I made this recipe in mini loaf pans. It was so easy and delicious and the mini loaves made great gifts.

Just lovely! I used all the butter, a little more than half a bag of cranberries, and omitted the nuts. Putting it in the freezer was hard to do, but it did help make it less crumbly. If anything I would have used a tad less sugar, depending on how sweet your orange juice is. Definitely a diet-busting recipe.

I made this recipe with one minor change (after reading some of the other reviews): I substituted half of the butter with apple sauce. I then made one loaf with one egg (as the recipe calls for) and another loaf with two eggs (as some of the other reviews mentioned). Both came out beautifully, the only difference being that the loaf made with two eggs was denser and slightly more moist. Both received rave reviews, though I think I will continue to use two eggs when I make this - and I definitely will - in the future.

The first time I had this bread was in a Star Bucks cafe. It was simply delicious. So I came home and looked for the recipe. I definetly believe that my verson was "off the hook." That means that mine was just as good or better. I replaced the white flour with whole wheat flour, increased the orange zest by 1 teaspoon and left the rest of the recipe the same. The increase in fibre and the richness of the flavor of the whole wheat expanded the good experience in eating. Thxs

Love this bread! Doubled amount of orange zest, used 2 cups cranberries, 1 cup chopped pecans. I like the buttery flavor and don't think it's overpowering, so I went for the gusto and used the amount of butter called for.

This bread was absolutely delicious and fun to make! I used frozen butter, chopped up, and cut it into the flour using a food processor (not the pastry knife). This was quick and easy and came out beautifully. Then, I just followed the recipe as written. Delicious. I did find that it only took an hour but, of course, that might have something to do with oven tempurature variability or the altitude or the alignment of the planets or missing time resulting from an unplanned UFO abduction. I'll definitely make it again -- probably make a bunch of loaves as Christmas gifts.

This is a great recipe! Following the advice of other reviewers, I increased the orange zest to 2 tsp, the walnuts to 2/3 c. and the cranberries to 1 1/2 c.

Somewhere in the last move I lost my copy of my mother's cranberry-orange nut bread recipe, which was a family favorite. Fortunately I found this one, which looked pretty close. I have made 3 loaves in the last 3 days (Xmas party gifts and finally one for us) and everyone loves this bread! Optimal cooking time in my oven was 57 min. I increased walnuts to 1 C and cranberries to ~2 C. It is very tender bread, so try to let it cool all the way before cutting :-)

This was a wonderful recipe! The sweetness is just right and the tartness of the cranberries is fabulous. I increased it to a tablespoon of fresh orange zest and increased the nuts to 1/2 cup. I also chopped walnuts and put them on top of the batter after it was poured into the pan. The nuts toasted during baking and turned out wonderfully! Will definitely make again for the Holidays!

Great fall recipe. Excellent texture and taste. Watch the time. I think 1 1/4 hours is a bit long. Will make this again. Love the combo of cranberries and oranges.

Melt in your mouth delicious! I used chopped toasted pecans instead of walnuts and increased amount to 1/2 cup. My husband went back for seconds and was thinking of a third helping after a large meal.

I had to make this recipe substituting orange zest for lemon zest and almonds instead of walnuts. It was delicious, the kids loved it!
