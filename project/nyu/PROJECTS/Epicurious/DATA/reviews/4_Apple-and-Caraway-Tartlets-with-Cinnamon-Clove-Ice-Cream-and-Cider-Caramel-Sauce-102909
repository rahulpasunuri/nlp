i made this for thanksgiving. it turned out wonderful. my mom said she liked these better than her own apple pie! it was a lot of work however. that was fine for me b/c i was only in charge of dessert for thankgiving. my grandmother especially enjoyed the homemade icecream. it was very creamy. the caramel sauce took a lot longer for me to reduce, but was delicious. i was timid about adding the caraway seeds b/c they have such a strong sharp taste, but i thought it paired nicely with the tartness of the cider sauce. i loved the individual tartlets, but one tartlet was way too much for me to eat.

Delicious and they look great also! I left out the caraway and I boiled the sauce a bit longer to make it more caramely. I served them with the Maple-Butter Pecan Ice Cream from this site. Fabulous dessert!

I served this as dessert after an Indian buffet. I did add the caraway seeds, and made the recipe into one 9' tart. I made the crust and filling the night before, then assembled and baked in the afternoon, and let it stand at room temperature. I didn't want to have to deal with ice cream on the buffet, so I served it with whipped cream flavored with the cinnamon and ground glove (and a bit of powdered sugar)suggested for the ice cream, and the cider sauce. It was delicious and guests loved it. I tripled the recipe to serve 35 people (3 tarts - 12 slices each).

Everyone loved this recipie but w/ a few changes. I did not add the caraway to the crust (tried once w/ the caraway and thought it was awful). Decreased apple cider from 4c to 3c. The cinnamon clove ice-cream was wonderful. Making individual tartlets was a nice presentation but next time I would save some work and make one large tart.
