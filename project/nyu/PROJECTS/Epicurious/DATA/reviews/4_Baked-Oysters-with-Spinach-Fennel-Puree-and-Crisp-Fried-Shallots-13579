I usually make Oysters Bienville for New Years Eve, but my husband let me try a new recipe for once. He loved it!

Very nice! Purée (very green!) has a great taste that is not too overwhelming and very fragrant! Made exactly as is. It was my first time cooking oysters and found these to be good (gobbled them up quicker than hubby) and very presentable. Might try the rockefeller recipe next time but will surey make these again!
