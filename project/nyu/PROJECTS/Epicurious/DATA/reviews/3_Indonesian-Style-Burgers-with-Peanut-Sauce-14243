Great burgers with outstanding flavor. The ginger in the meat and the peanut sauce really made this a great recipe.

Tasty & easy burger for the bbq. Not real indonesian but has the fusion of indo-western taste. Nice new take on the traditional burger. Friends loved it.

I've given this recipe four forks based upon the following revision: Instead of burgers I use the ingredients to make wraps. Here's how: brown the ground beef, drain if necessary; stir in the remaining ingredients (I usually reduce the sour cream to 2 TBSP). Simmer until mixture is heated thoroughly. Spoon onto large lettuce leaves and serve.

Probably the best burger I've ever had. Peanut sauce is a bit too sweet with regular peanut butter. I recommend using Arrowhead Mills sugar-free which is made from 100% nuts and sesame seeds I believe - very tasty! Otherwise, we made it as recipe calls for. Very flavorful (and reminiscent of flavors we've had in Bali whether they're authentic or not.)

Folks, lighten up about the "Indonesian" part. This is a great idea on how to do something different with burgers. Somebody might throw some Sauerkraut on a burger and call it "German", or dry roasted onions and call it "Danish"....... This is great and easy and cheap and everyone I made it for liked it. Yes, try it.

Hey, this was yummy! If you like hamburgers, peanut butter, and Asian flavors, give it a shot.

My husband and I have made these burgers several times, and we think they are a great break from hamburgers. We love the tangy peanut sauce and they're so easy and great to make for company, as the sauce is served on the side.

I have made these burgers a number of times and my husband and I think they are great. It is nice to take a break from ordinary burgers. I don't care where they came from -- I think they are tasty!

I agree with Ithaca. Nothing Indonesian about this recipe. But if it is good then, good luck.

Indonesian food is one of the best I've known. Using 'Indonesia' name for something like this, that no one seems to like is like giving Indonesian food a bad name. Be responsible, I know this is not Indonesian food.

So boring! Burgers just tasted salty from the soy sauce. I couldn't even taste the cilantro. The burgers with blue cheese in the middle are much better!

this recipe sounded promising, possibly due to the combination of peanut butter, ginger and soy sause. however , it did absolutely nothing for me , or my partner. the burger itself was...well, okay. the sause itself is what should have made this outstanding, but failed. perhaps i'll feel inspired to improve this , but with all the other wonderrful recipes from epicurious, why should i bother??

My husband liked this recipe ok, but I liked it less. The sauce was quite good but the burger less so. We used low fat ground beef, so that might be why. I think this sauce would be tasty on a grilled chicken sandwhich and may try that.

Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! At first you think peanut butter with a hamburger? But it was delicious! My picky eight year old couldn't get enough and my husband. . .said they were to die for.
