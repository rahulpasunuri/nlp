Fantastic! Half of the chocolate chips I substitute with Heath or Score bits and it makes a fantastic cookie!

I also think these weren't super special in comparison to regular chocolate chip cookies - that's pretty much what they are, but I guess the name "Bartell" mislead me a bit. In any case, they are good...I did have to make the recipe without milk - with margarine instead of butter (I used soy butter) to make them without lactose, and they came out good, altho a bit dry...

I agree with the other reviewer that Toll House is about as good (if you add pecans) but these look a lot better. I think they would be good with ice cream because they don't taste too sugary. Have a big glass of milk nearby!

These cookies are not much different than your typical Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookie -- what's the fuss about? I won't bother doing these again, it's just as easy to get the recipe off of the bag of chips.

really a chocolate lovers cookie. i found making mini cookies with this recipe was a better idea than a regular sized cookie. a little goes a long way with this cookie.

This got rave reviews from my co-workers when I brought them in for the Christmas holidays. I made two batches, and they went quickly! They are even better-tasting a day or two later! Everyone loved them! Can't miss!

This recipe was a hit at an adult birthday party. Kids are generally finicky eaters & don't like nuts, but that leaves more cookies for the grown-ups!

Don't let anyone tell you kids don't like this cookie! It was a great hit with the whole family and friends of all ages. An attractive and easy cookie that makes about 40 with the following recipie. I would definitely make this again!

I liked these cookies. Not a good kids recipe with the pecans, but friends love them and left no survivors.

Great when hot, but very rich. There are better cookies out there to get fat off of.
