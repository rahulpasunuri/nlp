Was searching for a garlic aioli to pair with some heirloom tomato gazpacho. Aioli was good but I cut the amounts down by a third to make a more manageable amount. Couldn't vouch for the tortillas, but all the other reviews look terrible.

This is recipe is a poor representation of the dish served at Amada. The tortilla is tasteless and flat, and the aioli is ridiculously garlicky (and I like garlic). Finally, the aioli recipe makes about enough for a dozen tortillas.

The ailoi was great, but next time, I will cut the potatoes into very thin slices and let them lie flat. I also might try a slightly hotter oven--mine was still a bit runny in the middle after ten minujtes.

I liked both the tortilla and the saffron aioli. It reminded me of a Tapas a local restaurant in North Scottsdale serves...however, my egg showed some as where there's seems to be a more seamless integration of potato to egg mixture...but still overall a good side. Reheated well for breakfast the next day.

The tortilla was fantastic- I didn't bother with the saffron aioli, instead I served it on a baguette with mahonesa. I made it back home in the US for easter and my family loved it!

The saffron aioli is ok but the tortilla is absolute rubbish. The recipe "tortilla espanola" in this site is much more like the real thing. It did not make 4 servings but that was ok, since it wasn't too successful a dish.
