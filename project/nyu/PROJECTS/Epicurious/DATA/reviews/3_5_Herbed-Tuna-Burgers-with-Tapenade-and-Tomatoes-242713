Waste of good tuna. Made exactly as directed. Boring tuna, but great sauce. I'll make the sauce again with chicken or pork ribs, loin or tenderloin, but never again with tuna.

This is one of my favorite recipes. Its so full of flavor and so eaily done. I just love it. Sometimes I use sun dried tomatoes as a garnish rather then regular tomatoes for an extra kick. Bold Flavor and very healthy! I made them on a griddle pan.

Great recipe! added other fresh herbs; oregano, thyme, dill. Used a cast iron grill pan which worked perfectly...made a nice crust. Used a garlic-lemon mayo instead of the tapenade

Everyone loved it. We grilled the burger in a fish basket so they stayed together perfectly.

We loved this recipe; the tapenade is essential. We had no problem grilling the burgers:the tuna was cut in 1/4 inch dice and the patties formed into plastic wrap a good 2 hours before we grilled them. No sweat!

flavor was fabulous! I don't think I diced the tuna finely enough because the texture was a bit odd and they were difficult to keep together on the grill. I will definately try these again but next time I will dice much finer and see if they warrant 4 forks (I think they will).

This is amazing. Used Ahi sashimi grade tuna - made it twice - so easy- nothing but rave reviews
