This was a disaster!! I didn't read the posted comments until now, four days after I baked the cake. The batter was so thick, it was not done in 30 minutes, then the outer ridges burned while the middle baked to doneness. The layers fell apart when I cut them. The filling never thickened and I had chocolate bits amidst the white slop of the sour cream and whipping cream. What a disaster! It was the worst looking cake I've ever made, it didn't taste good, it was a waste of good ingredients and 2 1/2 hours of my time. I'll never make it again!!

Delicious, moist chocolate cake - made into cupcakes and used a vanilla frosting.

This cake was nice and moist but not very chocolatey. This could be due to the fact that I made it with a different milk-chocolate frosting. Perhaps the filling and frosting would make the difference.

Great cake, but couldn't agree more with the comments about the filling, which turned out to be true. Even following the tips from other cooks, I still found that making the icing solid enough to be usable was a challenge. With the addition of a lot more icing sugar, it worked out ok, but I then ended up throwing out about half of it as I then had far too much icing for the cake. The cake was delicious and I will definitely make it again but perhaps with a standard butter/sugar/cocoa icing instead of the suggested recipe.

This cake was excellent. The review by the cook from Atlanta Georgia was very helpful. I will definately follow all her tips and I will be making this again. I think I will try a raspberry filling with the same frosting.

I only made the cake and it was so yummy. I made my own almond butter cream frosting. This cake is easy to make and very tastey. It borders on rich but not too rich...just right.

This recipe is a bit problematic but here are my suggestions to make it work: definitely go with the cream cheese instead of the sour creme for the filling, do NOT attempt to cut your cake into 4 layers but just go with the more traditional and less frustrating 2, skip the glaze because guess what? when melted chocolate gets hard it gets very very hard and difficult to cut through - use the extra filling for the top, if you follow these steps you will save yourself hours of frustration and end up with a very tasty cake. Good luck.

I made just the cake, not the frosting. It is delicious just as is or with powdered sugar on the top. It is so rich! Will do again for a coffee or tea.

Wish I had read the reviews before I made this cake. Thought the frosting/filling had too much wet ingredients, but though I could beat it to firmness. Made the cake for a birthday and could not use the frosting. So we ate the cake plain and it was melt in your mouth good. I'll make the cake again and I will tackle the frosting when it is not for an occasion. Also this is a great recipe for a sheet cake. Will make again and again!

According to many of my friends this is the most excellent chocolate cake! The problem lies with the instructions the ingrediants ARE CORRECT. The cake and the glaze are fine the difficulty comes with the filling - do not follow the filling instructions. 1ST whip the heavy cream, 2ND whip remaining ingrediants (s.cream, melted cooled choc., vanilla, pwdr sugar), 3RD fold the whipped cream into the choc mixture and wala you have the perfect filling. Very simple. I also found for the filling that the sour cream and melted choc need to be room temp. It dosent take long for the choc to cool and it will take a while for it to harden again. As you read other frustrations, I too had frustrations. First it was the room temp of choc, sour cream etc. Secondly, the first two times I made the cake I also switched the amounts of sour cream and pwdr sugar, but knew that Gourmet did not make errors and checked the orginal magazine recipe and it too printed 2 c. sour cream and 1 c. pwdr sugar thus I braved the 3rd try. The first cake was a hit even though the filling had choc small bits. The second was also a hit with the bit too sweet filling (twice the pwdr sugar) and not enough to cover the outside of the cake - again too appealing of presenation. But this third time was a charm. One last reccomendation - freeze the cake layers, even if it is just overnight. Let them thaw a room temp and then cut them in half. Freezing the cake layers should be done with any cake as it adds additional moistness. Good luck - there is not a better chocolate cake. My friends are now asking me to bake their birthday cakes. In this day in age - that is amazing as most people naturally rely on store made cakes! And the best part for experienced bakers is that this is a challenge.

The receipe needed so much modification not to be so soupy that it didn't justify the effort required.

I wish I had read the reviews first. I am an experienced baker, but this cake's filling came out way too soupy. The cake is in the frig and I'm hoping it firms up before tonight's party. It does not look nice -- all the sour cream filling is oozing out the sides. Hubby is out getting more chocolate to shave so I can stick it on the sides of the cake in hopes of improving the appearance. I'm also going to buy another dessert. I would try it again using much less sour cream or the cream cheese as others have suggested. The filling is just too soft to hold the cake together. --- Update: after a few hours in the fridge, the cake firmed up. The glaze hardened and we had to use an electric knife to slice it, but it drew rave reviews for taste. I would make it again but follow tips: beat whipped cream first, fold in less sour cream; let it chill before using the filling and chill the entire cake for a few hours before serving. It didn't look very good, but it tasted very good.

I was worried that this would be a disaster after reading the other comments, but if you have space in your fridge and a few hours it comes out fine. I used one cup of cream cheese instead of sour cream because it holds up better, the sour cream was way too runny, even when I used 2 cups of powdered sugar and one of sour cream. I refridgerated the icing for one hour before frosting the cake and then I refridgerated the cake for 3 hours before serving. Everyone thought it was great! Also, always make sure the melted chocolate and the cream is at room temp. when you mix them or your icing will come out with freckles and taste like sour cream instead of chocolate!

My husband made this for me for my birthday and it looked lovely and tasted lovely, with his genius improvisation. However, please read these tips before you make this recipe or it will all end up in tears: I believe that whoever submitted this must have had really fat fingers, because there must be a typo for the filling, which will indeed come out a runny, soupy mess if you follow it, even if you cut back on the liquid. And it will ruin your lovely cake if you try in vain to use it. However, this 'filling' (better called sauce) tastes really good and our solution was to store it in a bowl and literally SPOON it over our individual cake slices, rather than try to fill the whole cake with it. Another thing I wanted to mention that newer bakers might panic over - the cake will come out very dense. Dont worry. It needs to be dense so you can cut it in half. If you dont like really dense cake then buy four pans instead of two and fill them half way with batter from a moist cake recipe. If all else fails, Betty Crocker is only ever a few steps away.

I wish there was a photo of the cake before I made it. I was surprised to see the filling/frosting came out looking like cookies and cream ice cream, but it still tasted great!

Hope no other cook tries to make the glaze as shown here. Big error! Two cups of sour cream and 1 cup of heavy cream combined with only 1 cup of sugar equals a SOUPY disaster.

The glaze didn't work even with the suggested changes from the other reviews. I tried a second time by first whipping the cream to soft peaks but it still didn't work. The third time I whipped the cream in a dispensor (with a charger) and gently folding in the ingredients, still no go!!

I made this recipe to take with me to Thanksgiving dinner last year. I received a request in "May" to make it again this year.

A smooth, creamy, delicious treat. My only complaint would be that the icing is slightly sour due to the amount of sour cream in it. It is surprisingly simple to make. I will definetely use this recipe again.

This recipe is awful, and the end result was disappointing - After assembling and frosting the cake, I got a garbage bag, and tossed it. The frosting never thickened, and was too runny to hold the 4 cake layers together. Even though I followed someone's advice to reverse the amounts of sour cream and sugar, it was still runny, and it became way TOO SWEET! YUK!

I made this for my chocolate loving family at Easter. I found the cake rather dry and made the frosting without the corrections. The frosting was not firm and I had to hold the layers together with toothpicks to prevent the layers from sliding off. The chocolate curdled but the frosting was very good. The directions were poor and incorrect and I doubt I would make this again. The taste of the sour cream and heavy cream was interesting and I did enjoy that. The recipe should have specified what the consistency of the frosting should be after beating. It was hard to tell when to stop beating.

This is a very good cake, but when I make it again, it will only be for an occasion in which the whole cake will be eaten at once -- a dinner party, potluck, big birthday party, whatever. It's a lot of trouble and hard to store (must be refrigerated since its frosting consists of heavy cream and sour cream). I took the advice of the cook who first rated this recipe -- I reversed the amounts of sour cream and confectioner's sugar in the frosting (good advice -- thank you!). The frosting was still not very stiff, but once I got the cake put together and well refrigerated, it was fine. Very tasty, very special, cake -- and very chocolatey and rich!

This recipe was wonderful but has a big error. The frosting it calls for 2 cups sour cream and 1 cup confectioner's sugar. Reverse the amounts!!! On my second try for the frosting it was wonderful. Tip: let the creams get to room temperature and the chocolate cool off before combining, otherwise the chocolate curdles.
