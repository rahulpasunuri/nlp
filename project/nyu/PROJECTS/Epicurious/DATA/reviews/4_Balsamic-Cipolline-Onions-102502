Very good. Watch the salt. I used a boxed beef stock. After it cooked down, it became a little too salty. I will def make it again with low sodium stock or less stock.

Not bad. Better than canned. U would make it again for Thanksgiving but not for every day.

Part of the appeal of the recipe is the small onions - both the texture and the fact that the flavor cooks through. I wouldn't recommend making this with larger onions. Also, the initial simmering step is intended to help peel the onions. It's best to drain the onions and place them in an ice bath immediately afterwards to prevent them from cooking at this stage. Then, slice off the root end and pop off the skins. I also take an extra step and make an X mark on the root end with an knife, it helps prevent the layers from telescoping when you cook them. These are especially delicious with a simple steak as a side dish, where they really show off their flavor.

I went to Whole Foods to buy the onions and they were the size of hockey pucks. They were difficult to prepare and just didn't taste all that good -- we might just as well have been eating regular large onions. If I make this dish again (which I guess should, given all the rave reviews), I will use the smaller sized cippolines that we're all used to.

great dish added rosemary (removed half way through cooking) and honey, extra balsamic and cooked it a lot longer, loved how tender the onions got, mmm

These little Cipolline onions are the BOMB! I used fig balsamic vinegar and did not overcook them, although tender onions, carmelized are not mushy but rather heavenly! ENOY!

I believe that there are 3 truths in the food world-garlic, good beef, and onions. My husband and I love onions in most forms and fashion, especially carmelized to accompany good meat. Using the cipolline here is key(when you can get them)-and they were perfect with grilled steaks. Our friends raved-such a restaurant quality accompaniment with the grilled steaks. Will keep this one for sure.

Great side dish. I make these for almost every holiday. The key is to use a good balsamic and at least double the recipe because they dissapear very quickly.

Followe recipe to the letter. Yuck! Mushy onions! I think the recipe makes them cook too long. Maybe this is the problem. I thought it was going to be so good, too! Disappointed.

I made this with baby vidalia onions. It was excellent. I might have used a bit more balsamic vinaigre than specified in the recipe.
