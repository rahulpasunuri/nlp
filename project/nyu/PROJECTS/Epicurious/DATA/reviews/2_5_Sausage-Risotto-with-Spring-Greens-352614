I didn't follow the recipe to a "T" either. I cut the rice in half, used 3 garlic cloves, and to keep it on the healthier side, 4 spicy italian chicken sausage, only 1 Tbsp of butter and just a sprinkling of parmesan. For a bit of extra flavor, I also didn't boil the mustard greens, but lightly sauteed them in a bit of chicken broth and EVOO. My husband had thirds. The verdict? Delicious, and easy, too.

Well...I didn't follow the recipe, but what resulted was pretty tasty and did not need salt. My changes: Arugula instead of chard Omitted onion 5 garlic cloves instead of 1 2 additional italian sausages 1 chopped tomato pinch of red pepper flakes

My husband made this night before last. First, it yields WAY more than 6 first-course servings. Second, it was definitely missing something. He used good, mild Italian sausage and Swiss chard...didn't really do much, although the texture was enjoyable. Probably won't try modifying and stick with other favorite risotto recipes moving forward.

After reading other reviews, decided to add more garlic (4 cloves) and a little red pepper flakes and fennel seeds to the mix. Used swiss chard and sauteed the stems with the garlic and onions; just steamed the leaves on top of the rice at the end of the cooking process. Also, I used my homemade chicken stock, which I think is must when doing risotto; it just adds so much more flavor! I think next time I would only use a portion of the greens as they don't hold up well in the leftovers, and there are a lot of leftovers with this dish when only serving 2 people. Added feta to leftovers and that was good too.

I used spinach in the risotto and sweet italian sausage, because that was what I had on hand. It was really good. It is filling enough for a first course. The sausage was tasty enough that I did not have to add parmesan cheese like I normally do for risotto.

I used spicy sausage and it was really good. It's a lot of food - way too much for 4 main course dishes.

This risotto is mellow yet blah. Maybe spicy sausage would be better.
