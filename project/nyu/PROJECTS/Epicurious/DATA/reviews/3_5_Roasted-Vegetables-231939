Love this recipe!! My kids loved it to! I reduced the leeks and added more sweet potato though. I have already made it twice and will make it many times in the future.

I added a whole mess of other veggies, orange and purple cauliflower, radishes, butternut squash, carrots...mix in a little honey. Just before serving simmer down a little balsamic vinegar and dress.

I made this for a dinner with some girl friends. It was very easy to make. I didn't have the bay leaf, so I just skipped it and I had to cut the cooking time by about 10 mins. Otherwise, it turned out good, nothing special. It had a very unobtrusive taste. I'd make it again as a simple side to an otherwise spicy or very flavorful main course.

Try this recipe using diced red and yellow beets, 1/2 diced sweet onion, olive oil, bay leaves, and the garlic separately. It's easy delcious!

This is a delicious and healthy recipe. I added the cauliflower and eggplant as well. Don't forget to flavor with salt and pepper after roasting. It is nice with the sweetness of the vegtables after they are cooked. I have sent this recipe to every guest at my table. Everyone loves it. Enjoy!

I was forced to substitute marjoram for thyme and rutabaga for the turnip, but the dish still turned out very well. The roasting makes the vegetables sweet. I only gave it three forks because, well, it's pretty good and easy to make. I just wouldn't call the flavor "excellent."

Tasted great! I'd roast them a bit longer next time.

I set the oven to 420 and added pieces of cauliflower and eggplant and it was lovely
