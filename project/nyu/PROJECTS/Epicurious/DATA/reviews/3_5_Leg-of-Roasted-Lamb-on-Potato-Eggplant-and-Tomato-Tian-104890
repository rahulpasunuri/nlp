I made this dish for Easter dinner. I have to confess I am quite partial to the rosemary-garlic motif for roasting a leg of lamb; this recipe with the lemon-oregano? -- meh. Good enough (3 stars), nothing wrong with it, but I will probably not make it again. However, the "tian" (never heard that word before) was AMAZING and I will definitely make THAT again! -- like another reviewer, I peeled the eggplant, used new potatoes sliced 1/4", and tossed the veggies with 1 tble of olive oil before roasting. Roasted at 400 initially then reduced to 350 per the recipe. The tian would adapt to any number of roast meats; the essence of the meat infuses the vegetables, which caramelize beautifully.

This recipe is bizarre. For example, can anyone tell me how they fit 5 pounds of vegetables into a 3- quart casserole? Next: there is no temperature given for the initial roasting of the vegetables, but then the recipe states that you turn DOWN the temperature to 350. Down from what??? In spite of this, it was good. Agree that it's not a "company" dish, but easy enough for family -- after all the peeling and slicing however.

A great supereasy recipe. First time cooked per recipe for some guests. Everone LOVED it. The tian is great, I added lots of garlic. Second time I had only one fresh tomato, so I added a can of stewed tomatoes instead. Also had some zuccini that needed to be used and a bell pepper. And a white onion, sliced and quatered. It seems like a lot of vegetables to begin with, but they do cook down. Tian was a large part of this dishes appeal, so I now make more of it. This dish is great because the prep is easy and fast, it cookes by itself and as long as you don't overcook the meat is guaranteed to be tasty. It is not all mushy like a pot roast, it slices nicely and looks nice golden brown. I used Montreal Steak season instead of the salt/pepper. Perhaps it is nothing to rave about to some, but paired with an elegant salad, some potatoes or rice (or yeah, i omitted the potatoes in the recipe), a little mint sauce and a good wine it makes a very nice meal for company and family alike.

This was a good satisfying dish. In the end the flavor is more than the sum of it's parts. My vegetables did cook down more than the picture shows but they were still delicious. It is like a dressed up pot roast as one other reviewer said but I like pot roast.

This is one of those times when I just don't get what the fuss is about. This is fine. Easy to prepare, tasty enough. But nothing special. Just homey comforting food. Nothing wrong with that, but nothing to rave about either. If you're looking for something to wow someone -- this won't do it. If you just want a simple one-course meal for your family, this recipe is a good enough chioce.

This was a very good recipe. I really enjoyed it and so did my husband. I did modify it a little bit, however. I added red wine and olive oil, and I eliminated the tomoatoes. I roasted it at 450 for about 30 minutes and then lowered the heat and covered it and cooked it another 2.5 hours (my leg of lamb was about 7 lbs, and to tell you the truth I should have cooked it longer). I served it with orzo...very nice.

I was disappointed in this dish, I followed everything to a tee but the vegetables came out too mushy, the tomatoes overpowered the taste of the vegetables and my husband and I just didn't enjoy it. I will not be making this again.

The recipe came out wonderful. It was very easy to prepare and cook. I used an already boned leg, so I cooked it for only 15 minutes before turnig down the temperature. I also made sure to add close to 2 cups of wine and 5 tablespoons of oil before cooking the veggies. This kept everything much more moist than when I made it the first time to recipe exactly.

While this dish was very good, it was more in the category of 'comfort food' than something I'd consider really special. Kind of a lamb pot roast.

Rating: 2
The Lamb tasted delicious, and was soooo tender. I added the cup of Pinot Noir wine as suggested by another reviewer. The vegetables were not what I liked. All the vegetables were overpowered by the tomato, which is not what I like. If you like a tangy tomato flavour go for. The lamb was WONDERFUL, almost worth using the veggies to flavour it and discard.

I have made this dish 3 times and it is always a sucess. I would double the vegatable tian as it cooks down a lot over 2 to 3 hours.

A truly delicious dish! I roasted the vegetables at 400 and added a mixture of about 1 cup Pinot Noir and a Tablespoon of olive oil in addition to oiling the bottom of the pan. I also sliced the potatoes at about 3/8 inch and peeled the eggplant. I roasted a leg portion of about 1/2 the size, so I started at 400 and lowered the temp to 350 after 15 minutes. The lamb was tender and juicy with great flavor and the vegetables were delicious too.

Delicious! The lamb was quite good (though a tad dry -- perhaps because I forgot the lemon juice?), but the tian was oustanding. I served this at a dinner for four, and the vegetables disappeared. Next time I will double the tian. I added a bit of white wine and a little olive oil to before baking, to avoid overbrowning; I also sliced the potatoes 1/4 inch, not 3/4 inch thick, and they were nicely done.

I am looking forward to making this. Does anyone know how many it will serve? Thanks!

I'm afraid I can't review this precise recipe as my internet connection died just as I was about to start preparing the beautiful NZ leg of lamb my friends had procured... Generally, I hate it when people say 'This was a great recipe... I changed most of it, but it was great', so I'm hesitant to do the same, but the *method* works fantastically. OK, I forgot the onions and the lemon juice, and threw in a cup or two of red wine when I started roasting the lamb, so the flavours wouldn't have been the same, but the lamb was roasted to perfection; succulent, tender and beautifully spiked with garlic, and having all the potatoes and veggies in the same pot made cooking and cleanup blissfully simple. I used an earthenware lasagne dish as the cooking vessel, and took it straight to the table and it looked beautiful; the red wine had given the lamb a wonderful deep red gloss, and I sprinkled fresh oregano leaves over everything when I took it out of the oven. The only adverse comment I would make is that the potatoes weren't *quite* done; either I need to slice them thinner or par-boil them first. Inspiring; I won't hesitate to do the same again! (With or without variations... ;)

My husband and I live above 6500 feet and fresh garden vegies are out of the question until we can afford to build a greenhouse. We took a short 4 day trip to the ocean. On the way back we stopped at a farmers market and bought so many vegies that even our neighbors were beginning to duck when they saw us coming with yet more vegies! I came in here searching for eggplant recipes and ran into this 'Tian'(?) recipe. We roast a leg of lamb maybe once a year, so my comment is about the 'Tian' (?) recipe. I made it as a side for pepper steak and it was wonderful. I used the leftovers the next night and made a frittata and served it with a green salad. The only thing I changed was that I added some zucchini and yellow squash, plus a little more garlic than the recipe called for, plus some fresh herbs. It was great!

I'm a professional caterer in Boston, and I have to say that this is one of the most succulent dishes I have ever made from this site. I added a little white wine to keep the veggies moist (I used a larger leg). I would serve this to any of my clients, as well as to my fabulously picky mother!

My wife and I are lamb lovers and this is truly a delectible dish. Such wonderful flavors and a unique main course that would be a hit for any dinner party or Sunday supper.

My daughter-in-law made this for Easter Dinner. It was so delicious I decided to try it with a smaller piece of meat. I made it with a loin of pork. I used rosemary to flavor the pork, but I used both rosemary and oregano for the tian. Naturally I adjusted the cooking time to suit pork (using a meat thermometer is best). Scrumptios. It won great praise from my neighbor who I invited to dine with us.

At what oven temperature should the tian be roasted for the 30 minutes before the lamb is added, and the temp. reduced to 350? Thanks.

Very simple and easy recipe that was a hit with guests not usually lamb lovers! Great meal - allows the cook time to enjoy guests.

I made this for Easter,however, not realizing I wanted the bone in the butcher boned & tied it. The lamb turned out delicious & tender, as did the vegetables. I cooked it rare,135 degrees.The only question I had was where did the basting juice come from? The recipe did not give any added liquid other than the lemon juice. I had to add water & it still did not yield much basting juice. I might add a little red wine next time.

This dish was delicious and easy to prepare. I added 6 crushed dried pequin peppers (hot!) to the tian, which added just the right amount of zing.

We made this dish for our family Easter dinner and it met with rave reviews. There are enough vegetables to feed 6 veggie lovers twice, so next time I might reduce them by 1/3--although we're all glad to have the leftovers! We tossed the veggies with 2 Tbs olive oil and increased the salt some as well. Also added some fresh lemon thyme. All in all, though, a very delicious dish and a nice change from the usual roasted leg of lamb.

I have no idea what a "tian" is, the word not appearing in my dictionary, but the dish was delicious nonetheless. I had to refer to my hard copy of Gourmet to get the oven temperature. It said to roast the vegs at 425 for 30 minutes, add the lamb, roast for another 30 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350 for the duration. I cooked only a half-leg of lamb, and it was pretty much done after a half-hour at 425, but it was really unevenly cooked, with parts overdone and parts still too rare. The next time I make this, I am going to roast the vegs at 350 (some of them burned at 425), and I'll raise the temp to 425 for the first ten minutes the lamb is in the oven, then bring it back to 350.

you forgot to include the oven temp
