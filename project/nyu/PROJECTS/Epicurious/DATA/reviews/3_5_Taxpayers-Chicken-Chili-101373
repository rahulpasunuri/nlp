Perfect in every way. I bought chicken breasts that were already roasted at Bristol Farms (grocery) and then shredded them. I also added more of the spices and garlic. This is in regular rotation at our home.

Great tasting chili. I did make some adjustments for what I had on hand. Used anaheim chilis instead of jalapeno, used white kidney beans and added an extra can of black beans. Added two tbls of brown sugar per previous reviewers. Didn't have any coriander so left it out. And I only had one onion, so I added onion powder to make up for the lost flavor. I skipped the first step and just added frozen, skinless chicken breasts to the pot after adding the chicken broth. I fished them about after a couple of hours and shredded them. Tasted great, super easy! Made corn bread muffins to accompany.

So much better than white chicken chili. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts (6) that i boiled till almost done. Added to pot after beans were in for fifteen minutes to finish cooking. Didnt have kidney beans so used a can of small white beans and a can of chick peas. Served over brown rice, with tortilla chips for the kids!! Delicious.

I also was looking for a chicken chili that was not a white chili and this is it. I did notice the slight bitterness but I added some cinnamon and cocoa powder, which I always put in my chili and that helped. I liked the bean ratio but everyone has different ideas about chili. You have to modify the seasonings to your own taste but this came very close on its own in my view.

Great recipe. I make it every year for the Super Bowl if I'm hosting the party.

I made half the recipe, baked and shredded 3 large chicken breasts the night before. Made the sauce ahead too. Missing 14 oz of tomatoes, so substituted a jar of mild Pace picante sauce. everyone thought it was delicious!

I made this according to directions but found it was a little bitter (not sure if this is the amt. of chili powder or the beer)? I used bud light. So I followed some of the suggestions of other cooks below by adding 1 1/2 T. of the adobo sauce from a can of chilis in adobo sauce and 2 T. brown sugar. That seemed to smooth out the flavor, provided more depth, and added a little more heat. Nice!

I read some former reviews and adapted accordingly. Here are my adaptations: 4 med. cooking onions; LOTS of garlic (I used 4 cloves + 1 clove elephant garlic); added sea salt and 2 chipotle chiles (from 7.5-oz jar; cut into 6 pieces each) plus 1 Tbsp of the adobe sauce; heavy handed on herbs (5 Tbsp cumin, 3 Tbsp oregano; 4 tsp coriander; extra 1 Tbsp chili powder...also added 1 Tbsp light brown sugar). We like beans, so I doubled beans to 4 cans. From prep time to moving into crock pot took about 3 hours. At that stage, I transfered the ingredients to my crock pot and cooked on low setting for an addt'l 6 hours. Served w/sour cream, cheese & salsa. YUMMY! Felt more like a winter meal to me. DEFINITELY A KEEPER!

Delicious! Can be heavy on the spices if you use fresh and grind them. Added fine ground cornmeal for added thickness!

This is a wonderful chili. We make it every time we have a big crowd, and it's loved all around! It's delicious served with grated cheddar and finely chopped green onions.

When I added the chicken and beans, it was thick like oatmeal. I had to add extra stock and seasonings, but afterward it was very tasty.

I've been making this for years, and I never modify it--except to make a double batch! It gets better after it sits in the fridge for a day or so. My husband begs me to make this all the time. Don't skip the toppings, either--sour cream and cheese make this especially delicious.

Excellent recipe, have made it many times and it never fails. If you want an extra kick use extra hot chili powder

Unlike many people out there I don't like white chicken chili; at least not the ones I've had so far. But this we all liked and it is a bit different from my own beef chili that I thought it would be worth a go. I'm so glad I did.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. We loved it. My husband asked me to make it again. One change, I added chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, because I love that flavor. Also, as mentioned in earlier reviews, it's definately better as a filling because it is not soup-y like beef chili, so I ended up making a nacho platter. The next day I used it wrapped in tortillas.

This has been a staple in our family for years. It's incredibly delicious (don't skip the toppings!) and it stores like a dream. It's even better as leftovers, when the flavors have blended. I always make a double batch and freeze individual portions. This is my go-to chili recipe.

This recipe is appealing even to those who don't like or can't tolerate too much seasoning. While I prefer spicy foods, I often cook for older friends and relatives who must eat a milder diet. I cut down a little on some of the seasonings for this recipe, and it was still a big hit.

Absolutely delicious! Shredding the chicken took longer than anticipated, but well worth the effort. Also, we used Corona as our beer. Yummy!

This chili is wonderful and loaded with flavor. I used cheapo flash-frozen skinless, boneless chicken breasts which I browned in a small amount of canola oil, 2 onions instead of 3 and whole coriander seeds ground in a mortar and pestle (I was out of the powder). I also used three 15 oz. cans of cannelini beans instead of what was recommended. It was very flavorful, and even better the next day on tostadas. This is a keeper.

Great recipe! I used a combination of bone-in and skinless/boneless breasts - the boneless were a little dry, and didn't save that much time. Everyone loved this recipe--for the first time, they're looking forward to leftovers!

I found this chili to be rather one-dimensional and flat, so I added 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons chocolate chips, about 3 tablespoons butter, and a pinch of ground cloves. This gave it a wonderful sweet dimension to counteract the hotness. Turned out delicious and I'll definitely do it again.

My family loved this chili. I cheated and used a roast chicken from the grocery store, which tasted great. A little spicey for our taste, so I added a little brown sugar to cool it down. Also used an amber ale which worked nicely.

I used a whole roasted chicken cut up into pieces, regular ole' Coors light and ommited the oregano b/c I was out. Used some black beans in addition. It was great! Hubby liked it. The earlier poster was right about using leftovers in tacos or any texmex dish! Great idea!

This is a good recipe. Unfortunately and as always, my family said they liked it, but liked my chili better. One of these days, I will find one that they like better! Mine is quite similar and I use at least 3 bottles of beer. I use a standard American beer; this is chili, not a fondue. You do not need or want ale; my guess is that strongly flavored beer would be too much. I thought it was good, very definitely needed garnishes, a good sharp cheddar and light sour cream worked well. However as I ate it I kept thinking that it would make a better filling than a chili. Saved the leftovers for an enchilada meal.

FABULOUS! I made two small changes in this wonderful recipe: I added a chipolte chili & used just black beans. I will definitely make this for guests!

One of our vey favorite recipes--I make it all the time. I always halve the recipe to make it for two people, and that provides the perfect amount of leftovers--this stuff gets even better after a day in the fridge. i recommend using full-sodium chicken broth so that the recipe is pleasantly seasoned.

Wonderful! Added 1 Anaheim chile per recipe, heavy on the garlic. Second time I used pork, cooked until tender enough to be pulled apart instead of chicken. Got rave reviews from 17 guys on a ski trip!!

Not only tasty, but easy--a real bonus. Made it with light and dark meat from one whole supermarket rotisserie chicken, Magic Hat Humble Patience beer (an Irish red ale), one can of black beans + one can of small white beans, and an extra jalapeno for a bit more kick. Served with Chevy's sweet corn tomalito (a copycat recipe) and coconut flan for dessert. Will definitely make this for guests or to take somewhere, but agree that serving 10-12 would be a stretch--maybe 8.

Wonderful, easy to make chili! I used cannelini beans and black beans also, and I used 2 teaspoons of chipolte pepper powder in with the other spices. Using skinless boneless breasts makes it even easier to make. We will be making this again for sure.

I took this chili to work for a tailgate party. I used three cans of cannelini beans (white kidney beans) and one can of black beans. I made it the night before -- took it to work and warmed it in the crockpot all morning. Everyone RAVED!!

I cut the onions and garlic. Also, I didn't add any jalepnos. My family loved it. The flavor was very good, though the texture was a little odd. The onions were "squishy, icky," as described by my five year old. He'll just have to live with it.

After a little tweaking, this turned out great!! I added more peppers (Jalapeno, Serrano and Anaheim), and used black beans instead of Kidney beans. The beer and the chicken broth gave it a really rich flavor.

I am always in search of the perfect chili recipe, but this one will not survive. It was sour tasted too much like beer. Plus, I had to add so much tomato paste to make it palatable, that my husband asked, "Why did you double it?" Maybe it was the beer I used (Hefeweizen).

Left work early due to snowy conditions and started the sauce late afternoon. My meat- eating teenager rolled in around 7:00 PM and fussed at the idea of chicken chili, saying "chili without beef is like pizza without pepperoni" and asked that I make him a meat version. As I was still at the sauce stage, I separated some out for him and tossed in some ground beef and he was happy. Though later in the eveing after savoring this delicious meal with a lovely glass of chardonnay, I saw him slip into the kitchen and begin sampling the chicken chili right from the pot. After several hearty slurps he turned to me and said "This is delicious. We should make this again." Which I intend to do for a holiday party that I have coming up. Wonderful flavors. Also, I used boneless, skinless breasts. Fabulous.

I've had lots of chili, and this is my all time favorite. I used st pauli girl dark for the beer, and only one huge onion pureed all to h.I detest kidney beans, so used red beans. I also didn't have a jalapeno, so I used a few teaspoonfuls of panola jalapeno pepper hot sauce. I love this stuff and so does my husband.Try it.

This chili was good as an easy alternative to regular chili, and I served it to guests who seemed to really like it. I didn't find it hard to make. I cooked the chili the night before I served it for Sunday lunch and I didn't add the chicken until right before I served it. I used six boneless chicken breasts which was plenty of chicken. Before I put the chicken in, I thought that the spices might overwhelm people, but either the overnight sitting or adding the chicken toned them down. Actually, my husband thought I should have put the chicken in earlier to give the pieces themselves more flavor. I also used Pete's Winter Brew as the beer, and only used two large onions. I served eight people with it, three folks had seconds, and I had one bowl left. Definitely serve it with sour cream and cheese.

This a very good recipe. I used Pam instead of Vegtable Oil. I found I did not need all the chicken. I microwaved it and shredded it by hand the day before. It is so... good.
