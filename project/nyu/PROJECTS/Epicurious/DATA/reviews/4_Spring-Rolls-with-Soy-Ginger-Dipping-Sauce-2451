These were awesome. A fair amount of work to prepare, but well worth it for the result. Wrapping them takes a while (especially because I doubled the recipe), so it's best if you have a helper. I made these ahead for a party and fried them there -- next time would have had 2 fry pans going at the same time to speed up the frying/draining/cooling process.

The spring rolls were great, but I've tasted better dipping sauces. I will certainly make this again -- everyone loved them.

It was only ok. They were very bland and boring. I still ate them but probably won't make them again. The basics are ok, but you have to add some more flavors to the mix.

It was delicious and a big hit at a dinner party. They were hard to roll; if not rolled properly they will spill their contents in the oil. But after a few practice runs, they came out wonderfully.

I deep fried the spring rolls in a turkey fryer I picked up for Thanksgiving and they turned out great. The sauce however is the highlight. I will find many uses for it!

my egg rolls turned out soggy and not-reheatable instead of delicious and crunchy like at restaurants. although, i may have messed something up. that I am unaware of.

would definitely make the rolls again, but will try a different sauce next time. do not think you are just going to whip these together though. that is unless you used to work at the golden dragon.

Delicious, easy to make. Only problem was I had half of the mixture left after my egg rolls were filled; I guess I understuffed them. For a better dipping sauce use one of the Vietnamese ones on this site.

This is the best eggroll recipe I've found....I've made them twice for myself already...they freeze and reheat very well. Am bringing some to my boyfriend to get his opinion.

This was the easiest spring/egg roll recipe I have ever tried and was the tastiest. I used some leftover salad size shrimp and it was fantastic. The best part was it passed the "hubby" test. He told me to file this recipe in my "keeper" notebook. I will be making this again very soon.

My review is for the dipping sauce only which I made for some bought vegetarian spring rolls. I'm glad I chose this recipe because it's so easy to make a very small amount by simply doubling the amount of soy sauce for whatever amount of mirin and rice vinegar used. I added a small pinch of the hon-dashi because I had it on hand, but I don't think it's necessary. I plan to keep this recipe handy for all sorts of dipping purposes.

Made this with the smoked turkey and it was a big hit. The recipe made 18 large spring rolls and it was relatively easy to do. The dipping sauce adds great flavor to the rolls.

Outstanding! My mom and I made these as an appetizer for a chinese feast and these were a HUGE hit. They did take a bit of time and I thought the sauce was a little bit bland (I added a bit more sesame oil for a nuttier, warmer flavor).

This was so good!! It was time consuming to chop everything but well worth the effort. Everyone loved it!

First time for making spring rolls. A little time consuming, but was a big favorite at the party. Need to learn how to cook and handle the noodles, they were the most difficult. Will make them many times more. Will freeze OK.

Excellent "egg rolls"...my husband doesnt usually like spring or egg rolls but thought these to be MUCH better than anything he's ever had. I used 1/2 chicken and 1/2 ground pork...cooked and then processed fine. They were good!!!!

This is a great dish with lots of flavor. I have even made it low fat by using cooking spray and it is still delish!

I made this for a skeptical group but they all loved it and asked for the recipe. I strayed a little from the recipe but I would definitely make it again

This was a delicious addition to the Pan-seared ahi recipe. This served as a wonderful appetizer and my dinner guests really enjoyed this. My only complaint would be the deep frying segment of this meal. I really felt quite guilty about all of the fat involved. Well, on a happier note, this was truly a delectable and enjoyable treat. The sauce was especially beautiful and I would not hesitate to make this wonderful dish again.

This is a great standard by which I calibrated my taste buds. Although it isn't a quick make, to me, it's elegent while simple and unpretentious. I'll cherish this experience. Thank you Epicurious.

This was a great recipe and very easy. I improvised on the sauce and added chili paste to make it a bit spicy.
