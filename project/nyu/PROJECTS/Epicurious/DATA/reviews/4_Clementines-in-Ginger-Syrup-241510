I've made this the last 2 years, soon as mandarins come into season here. I soak the slices overnight and they are truly exceptional. I like to serve with wedges of almond cake and Greek yogurt drizzled with the ginger syrup.

I've made this six times. Goes GREAT with chocolate gateaux or tiramisu - and espresso. Double the ginger, double the star anise and double the cardamom. Heck, double the clementines! I've got another batch in the fridge ready for guests tomorrow night.

Echo the raves here. I used leftover syrup for mint tea.

I made this for a party with our backyard Florida oranges. It was delicious, a hit with party guests and their kids. The pomegranate seeds were a nice touch. However this syrup was way more than enough for the amount of fruit it calls for. We cut up a pineapple and soaked it as well and we still had more syrup left over for the fridge. This is a good syrup for any fruit with tartness. It was easy to make and filled my kitchen with a nice exotic aroma.

I made this for a dinner party. Made exactly to the recipe using both clementines and blood oranges. To my surprise, it was a huge hit with everyone. (I had the impression a lot of people didn't like anise). I have a batch brewing now that omits the anise and adds cinnanomon and cloves just for comparison but I haven't tried it yet. A beautiful and refreshing dish.

I wouldn't omit the star anise. I think the combined aromas of ginger and anise are absolutely wonderful, sort of antidepressant, really. :) In fact, having strained the syrup and placed it in the fridge, I put the spices back in the pan instead of discarding them and added some water, then brought it to a boil, then turned it off but let it stand on the stove for a while as I sat in the kitchen, reading. You see, I wanted to let the spicy steam linger in my kitchen. As to the syrup, I have some left. I marinated a mix of clementine, blood orange and pink grapefruit slices a couple of hours in the mix and found it very refreshing! Uplifting, even!

Got rave reviews from friends, even those not fond of Clementines. I omitted the anise. Ginger is the overriding taste. The cardamom was lost. I think this dish would benefit by overnight soaking in the ginger sauce. The feeling among my friends is the sauce would go well with other fruit.
