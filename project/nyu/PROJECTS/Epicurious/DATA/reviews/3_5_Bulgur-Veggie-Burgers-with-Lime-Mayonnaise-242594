Made this for dinner tonight - very tasty. I didn't have the full amount of bulgur so I added quinoa to make up the difference and it turned out great! Substituted mint for the cilantro since that was in the fridge and used kidney beans. I made the mixture earlier in the day, but formed smaller patties and kept it refrigerated until dinner time. They held their shape without any problem. I used a nonstick skillet to pan fry and brushed oil on the patties as directed. Will definitely make these again.

I thought this was recipe was really good and very forgiving. I didn't have onion so I used a leek, didn't have cilantro so I simply omitted it (I think it would be a nice addition though). This was for a quick meal so I skipped the refrigeration and put mounds of the mixture into a nonstick skillet. At first they were globs and I was nervous they wouldn't firm up (maybe if they were cool) but once they browned on one side they were easily flipable, and after browning on the other side held their shape. Love the lime mayo! Will be making this again and again. The husband thought it was great too.

Even with all the ingredients, this was actually really easy to make. I don't have a food processor, so I just used my blender and it took a bit of creativity, but I think the best way is to first put all the ingredients EXCEPT for the bulgur/bean mix into the blender and pulse those. Then add the bulgur and mix and pulse until it is a satisfying consistency. These didn't fall apart as other reviewers lamented. I didn't touch my burgers once they were in the pan, only turning them halfway through the cooking time. Make sure your pan is super hot and your burgers and chilled thoroughly. Good Middle-Eastern taste, but this was more like falafel than a veggie burger...

Very good, my best veggie so far. a little hard to cook without falling apart, but not impossible. will try adding the egg as mentioned by other reviewer.love the mayo. did not leave out any of the ingredients, added fresh spinach and tomato onto open face burger.yumm!! thank you!

In addition to my previous comment, I added an egg and the ingredients held together really well (prevent the falling apart problem mentioned by other reviewers). I am not vegetarian but I LOVE this recipe. So much taste with the spices and lemon zest.

These turned out amazing but with a few additions. I added grated carrot and zucchini and used chickpeas instead of pinto beans. The limo mayo is delicious, i served them on whole wheat toast with tomato and avocado slices and a little hot sauce. Definitely making again and again!

Loved this. Great combination of spices with the cilantro and the lime mayo. They were a little on the mushy side, but made for a great sandwish. Simmilar to Deborah Madison's recipe but a lot lighter - this will probably be my go-to veggie burger recipe.

Rating: 3
This was my first homemade veggie burger, and as a first, the taste was excellent. I substituted black beans for the pinto, exed the nuts, and maybe used too much bulgur because my patties were mushy on the pan (pan fried them). They had a nice crust but I wish these were more firm and dense in texture. Will definitely make again with some changes.

A tasty, filling veggie burger. Nice texture to the patty because of the walnuts.

Rating: 3
We really liked these -- they reminded us of felafel. However, they didn't stay together very well. I'm not sure if I pulsed them too much in the food processor or what, but I chilled them for over and hour and they were still kind of falling apart. I cooked them in a cast iron skillet -- I would have liked to cook them on my grill pan but I was afraid they would fall apart. Otherwise, served open face w/ lettuce, tomato, lime mayo (made instead with greek yogurt), and they were very tasty.

LOVED this! I read most of the reviews and made the following changes: used black beans instead of pinto, used a sweet onion, had no walnuts so used pistaschos and some cashews (yum!!!) and put it on my whole wheat honey bread with a bunch of spinach under and on top. I was really wanting an avocado for the side or top and some mixed greens. I did NOT add egg or breadcrumbs. I grilled it on my Cuisinart griddler/panini grill so I didn't have to flip it and when it fell apart I could just strunch it up back together. Very nice when the outside was crisp. I doubled the recipe and froze a few patties and am hoping they will freeze well. I agree - do NOT skip the lime mayo - perfect touch to give some coolness with the punch of the spices. SO GREAT. Not meaty, so go another direction if you want it to FEEL meaty. My fav veggie burger ever by FAR.

I hate to darken the well of good reviews with these black remarks, but I did not find this veggie burger remarkable at all. If you are looking for that veggie burger to meet your long sought after veggie burger desires, this is not the recipe for you. Its just okay, the bulgur wheat is nice but it doesn't stick together sufficiently and the flavor is utterly lacking. I vacillated between two forks and three, I would say its a 2.5 culinary affair at most.

This was very tasty, and I enjoyed the lime mayo. I used cashew almonds instead of walnuts... turned out fine. I will say however, that this recipe makes more than 4 servings. This patties are very, very filling. For me and my friends, this recipes was enough for six.

Delicious veggie burgers! Used oats instead of the pinto beans only because DH doesn't like beans. Added the oats right after the bulgur cooked. Great recipe!

One of the better veggie burgers I have tried. I would suggest replacing the regular soy sauce with dark soy, it really enriches the flavor. Would definitely recommend this recipe.

I've given this a rave review before, and have made it tons of times, but for the first time I didn't add an egg, breadcrumbs, or any other such binder to get them to hold together better. I just followed the recipe exactly and cooked in a skillet with plenty of oil, using a big flat metal spatula to flip them. Well, my fears of the burgers falling apart in the past were unwarranted because it totally worked, and I think it tasted even better without those additions.

Rating: 4
Love this recipe. It does fall apart rather easily but 1) the longer refrigerated, the firmer it stays and 2) you can always think of it as a veggie sloppy joe. Hubby and I each had one patty for dinner...I cooked the other two and put them in the fridge. They were PERFECT as a filling for stuffed peppers the next day. Crumbled them into hollowed and seasoned bell peppers (with some cherry tomatoes mixed in and crumbled feta on top), put 1/3 cup water in the bottom of the dish, baked covered at 350 for 1 hour, removed foil and baked for 10 minutes more. Best stuffed peppers ever and also the easiest, since the filling was completely made in advance. A new staple for us.

these were super duper awesome. it was supposed to serve four, but i gobbled down two on my own... lime mayonnaise is a must i substitute parsley for the cilantro, but otherwise, made the recipe as is. broiled the burgers for about 12 minutes on 400 degrees, added the bread to the oven for the last two to toast i'm not a veghead but i LOVED these. definitely a keeper.

Wow, what a great veggie burger, best I have ever made! I read the reviews and left out the salt, the soy sauce provided enough salt. I used mixed beans instead of pinto beans, which worked great. I also used parsley instead of cilantro, because I have non-cilantro fans in my house. I added egg and panko to make sure the burgers held together well, and they did. Happy to have come across this healthy burger!

Great flavor! The burgers are hearty and you will not miss meat! I did have some trouble keeping them together but found that baking them worked well. I think that the paste would be excellent uncooked in a tortilla served as a bean burrito. I will definitely try that next time.

Will my life-long quest to find a good veggie burger end here? I don't know... But this recipe provided me with a well deserved pause... I added a handful of oatmeal and an egg, made 6 patties (instead of 4), put them in the fridge on wax paper for an afternoon and just cooked them on the stove in a little oil. Really good!

This recipe is good & Ill make it again as a fast meal but there are better. Im always looking for a recipe to rival what I accidentally made several years ago. I had cleaned out my grain bin drawer of all the small bits (1/4 cup or less) of rice, bulgur, barley, etc and misc beans; through it all into a pot with sea salt, garlic, onion, cayenne and lots of water; took nearly 2 hours to completely cook. What I got was wonderful drizzled with good olive oil but the leftovers? I finally added an egg, dried breadcrumbs & oil olive for richness to about 1-1/2 cups of it, formed into patties and fried in olive oil. Yum!!! I guess my lesson is that quick is no substitute for long & slow.

Unlike many other reviewers who said the burgers did not hold toggether well, I found quite the opposite to be true. Indeed my friend and I who I made these were for were most impressed by how well they held together; and as long-term vegeterians and keen cooks we have had quite a number of such burgers between us! I did, however, make some adjustments to the recipe; I only used a cup of nuts as that was all I had; and mixed walnuts and hazelnuts! I added half a cup of breadcrumbs and used red kidney beans instead! I recall reviews about making sure your ingredients are dry; but my bulgur, beans etc were slightly moist upon blending! I also chilled them for an hour; The result; beautifully textured, nutty and flavoursome burgers that stayed perfectly together throughout both our meals! The best Veggie Burgers I've had in a long time; If i do say so myself!!!

Rating: 4
After reading all of the reviews about keeping it together. I cooked the bulgar until all of the moisture was completely absorbed, beat and egg and added only half of it, and added 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs. The burger held together great in the pan and on the grill. I'm not a vegetarian and this is probably my favorite recipe on this site so far.

Rating: 4
Def crumbly and def not a burger, but def 4 forks for incredible flavor and texture. Thank you lauraakirk from SF--I wanted to use barley and black beans (on hand) and you confirmed the substitutions. I have a feeling many grain/bean combos would work here. Don't skip the lime mayo or toast. Cooked stove top in a cast iron--fell apart just a bit, so be careful but it's not impossible to keep the patties together. Chilled for ~45 min until we were ready to eat. So, so yummy and healthy and def a keeper! Did not miss the meat and we love hamburgers!

Rating: 4
I gave this recipe three forks last summer, but now I'm giving it four. You can make individual patties and freeze them and just pull one out and cook from frozen in your smallest non-stick frying pan. Cook on higher heat with a bit of olive oil, and try not to turn too many times. When you get that dark brown crust on both sides, you know it's done, SUPER good. They are tender and not for the grill.

Off the hook crazy good! Threw in some panko crumbs to hold it together. Cooked them on the stovetop. Lime mayo is a nice accoutrement. I used reduced-fat mayo. I could give up meat for these things!

The end result reminded me of a falafel that fell apart. Following some of the other reviews, I added bread crumbs (to half the recipe), and that half of the burgers held together a little better, but still not great. I would also add less salt next time. The soy sauce packs a lot of salt, so I'd add less of that or the actual salt. In the end, adding lettuce, tomato, and condiments to the burger in my pita cut the saltiness, but still I'd include less salt next time.

I liked these, but my carnivorous husband did not. Texture-wise, I chilled them one hour in fridge, then formed patties and chilled again, for at least 15 minutes. I used a cast-iron skillet as needed to cook inside the house and pre- heated it well. So, the patties did not fall apart and were very, very tender and moist. One tip is that I cooked the bulgur until all liquid was absorbed and it was even a bit sticky, possibly 20 minutes on slightly higher heat than called for. I only turned them one time and they held together well and browned well in the skillet with a bit of olive oil. The mayo was good, but next time, I would use Hellman's instead of Miracle Whip, which was a bit too sweet for this application, even though I increased the fresh lime juice to two tsp. I am not fond of salmonella, and did not have time to cook eggs for homemade mayo. I served open-face on squares of homemade focaccia.

I've been trying to find a recipe to make veggie burgers from scratch. Morning Star Farms, and Bocca Burgurs from the supermarket are pricey for just a bunch of grains {$3.99 pkg.-4 thin burgers} . I've been Looking for a more economical alternative. I made this recipe for my husband and I last night. We both agreed that the 'burgers' had a wonderful flavor but that the inside texture is not burger like at all, its very mushy. At the beginning of the recipe the descriptions says that this recipe is not trying to imitate meat. It couldn't be more true. Unfortunately I hadn't read the description until after I made these. I had just assumed from the title of the recipe 'Veggie Burger' that it would be like one. If you don't mind the mushiness of mashed potatoes or hot breakfast cereal this is a good 'burger', and I use the term loosely. I say that because the flavor was terrific, and so was the flavor of the lime mayo. I will continue to try other Veggie Burger recipes in hope of finding one that is more burger like in texture.

Rating: 4
I followed this recipe exactly. Interestingly, I didn't have much of a problem with the patties holding together at first, but once they were cooked they did become pretty fragile/crumbly. I wouldn't try and put these on a bun - I think the recipe's suggestion to serve them open faced on toast was right on. Some of the reviews mention that the burgers are soft or mushy - homemade veggie burgers are almost always like this, even if they are fully cooked. They often squish out of the bun if you actually try to eat them as a "burger". I almost never use buns for veggie burgers anymore - just something to keep in mind if you are disappointed that the texture didn't turn out like a regular burger. I had these on 9 grain toast with the lime mayonnaise, sliced tomato, and sliced avocado. They were great - I'll definitely make them again!

These were so tasty! I have to admit I wasn't expecting much with 'bulgur' in the name - but they are seasoned PERFECTLY and everyone loved them! Just to reiterate: make sure all of your ingredients are as DRY as possible before blending (cilantro, beans, etc). Mine came out a bit mushy, but I think it was my own fault. Refrigerating is not a step you can skip - you need it to firm them up (next time I'll leave them in there for 30 min to 1 hr). I will DEFINITELY be making this again and again! Great served with the jicama salad on SimplyRecipes.

I have been searching for a good veggie burger to bring along to summer barbecues for many years, and I've finally found it! I've made this recipe a few times, with pinto and then black beans, and both versions are incredible! I found this recipe to be extremely easy and quick, and the patties stayed together wonderfully! FINALLY a veggie burger that stands up to the grill!

Had to use black beans and barley (on hand) as substitutions, and this knocked our socks off! LOVE it- great meatiness, full flavor! Next time, I'm doubling the recipe and freezing 1/2 in patties to have on hand. We served it between wholegrain bread slices, spread with the lime mayo on one side and guacamole on the other. Glorious.

I am 12 years old and love to cook... kind of weird maybe, but it is fun- and I cook only from scratch. I made these bugers and they were a huge hit. I made the change of putting blackbeans instead of pinto, skipped the mayo, and cooked red pepper and celery along with the onions and bulgar. The bugers cooked well, and are now huge favorites with everyone.

Rating: 4
These were fantastic--they tasted a lot like falafel without the fried crust. I found that the bulghur needed 2 cups of water to soften all the way. (The recipe should specify fine grain bulghur, as mine was medium to coarse.) After processing the mixture in the food processor, I put it into a bowl and chilled the entire thing for 2 hours. It was then very easy to shape into patties. Preheat the grill pan well before adding the oil and the burgers won't stick or fall apart. Don't be tempted to forego the lime mayo--it really makes this dish! If you're vegan, you can find acceptable versions of vegan mayo at Whole Foods.

I was a little disappointed the first time I tried to make these, because I had the same trouble with them falling apart that everyone else did. But I mixed in some beaten egg, let them rest a little bit, then pan-fried them and served them in a whole wheat pita with romaine, smoked cheese, and spicy mustard. They were wonderful.

These are pretty tasty for veggie burgers! However, I would suggest coating the burgers with bread crumbs and also letting them chill in the fridge for at least an hour before cooking. I cooked mine on the stove top and didn't have too much trouble with them falling apart. The patties freeze really well too, which is really nice. Oh yea and its makes 4 massive patties...I think next time I will try making more than 4.

Used a ridged grill pan (minus 20 here today) and there was no issue with falling apart burgers. Served them exactly the same way as did the reviewer just below. These are WAY better than the dry and weird tasting veggie burgers we are usually served. YUMMY!

I have made these several times. They are some of the best veggie burgers I've eaten. My sons both love them too. I have served them w/out toast and added sliced tomatoes and avacado slices w/ the lime mayo. Make sure the bulgar is cooked dry and the beans are dry as well. Otherwise the mixture is too wet and is hard to keep in patties.

This has become a go-to recipe for me, even though there are many ingredients, which is a crucial variable in planning weeknight dinners. I've used almonds when I didn't have walnuts and it worked out fine, although I did like the walnut version better. If you like these try the veggie burgers at 101cookbooks.com - the chickpea ones are unexpectedly great.

amazing flavor. true that they were difficult to cook (pan), but the flavor more than makes up for the messy looks. Will try adding breadcrumbs next time to try to keep them from falling apart.

Excellent! I did a double batch, used white beans instead of pinto, and froze most of the patties. They're great pan-fried, or even just baked.

These are great ! I too took other reviewers advice and made a few changes. I cooked the bulgur until the water was all gone, didn't have cilantro so I used parsley, used black beans since that was what I had on hand. I added lime zest and lime juice to the burger mixture, and added whole wheat flour and added 1 beaten egg to the mixture to get the right consistency. Otherwise you can't form them in to burgers. Chill them for at least 30 minutes before forming. I coated them with olive oil before browning ....I cooked them stove top since I don't have a grill. The lime mayo is excellent ! This is definitely a keeper...I'm sure my vegetarian grandson and granddaughter will love them. Delicious !!!

these were fine. no worse, probably better, than most such concoctions. i'm a pretty good home cook (and i worked in restaurants for years), and i gotta agree with a commentator here -- ain't no way this is a 20 minute prep time. just add up the minutes for dicing the onions and cooking them with the bulgur. that said, it was on the table in well under an hour with all the fixings and a clean kitchen. keeping the mix DRY is key--cook the bulgur until the water's absorbed then fry in the residual oil until the bulgur is golden. i also treated these like croquettes, dipping them in flour-egg-crumb (methode anglaise).

This turned out great. By far the best veggie burger I've ever had. I used black eyed peas instead of pintos and brown rice instead of bulgur, everything else was the same.

Served in a warm pita with just tomato slices. Definitely deserving of 4 stars.

I think Andrea must be on meth if she can make this recipe in 20 minutes of prep time. Chopping onions and the mayo prep alone is 20 minutes! I don't know how this recipe would be possible without bread crumbs. I too used the quinoa since the store didn't have bulgur. I subbed basil for cilantro since http://www.ihatecilantro.com/ . I think next time, I'm going to try it with cajun seasoning... another possibility would be to sub in some curry paste and lemon grass for a thai flavor.

If you bother, follow everyone else's suggestion, less water, more breadcrumbs, more chill time, coarser bulgar etc. As-is I ended up with something the texture of dog food. Tried to salvage by coating in breadcrumbs, etc. but no dice. Faux sloppy-joe at best. Wasted time and effort. Would probably taste better had I seen the reviews first but so turned off at this point I won't bother with it again. Stick with meat.

I followed this recipe to a T, and the burgers were delicious. I think there are 3 keys to making this recipe a hit. First, the lime mayo dressing is wonderful, and I'm not a mayo fan. Second, cook bulgur until no moisture remains at bottom of pot. Too much liquid leads to a soggy burger. Lastly, chill burgers well before cooking them. Otherwise they are difficult to handle. Enjoy!

I substituted quinoa for the bulgar because I am in the midst of a quinoa obsession. They came out very tasty but a little sticky. Will add some flour or bread crumbs next time as suggested by other reviewers. They really don't need any added salt so I will leave it out entirely next time. added some left-over cilantro and soy sauce to the mayo (I use Smart Balance) along with the lime and that was fabulous on its own. So good it will become a staple on my condiment shelf.

These were delicious! The first time I made them, the mixture was so "liquidy" that it was difficult to form patties, so I added a little bit of whole wheat flour to remedy that. The second time I made them I added less water to the bulgar, I think this depends on what kind of bulgar you buy and how coarse the bulgar is.

These reminded me of falafels but they were different enough that I will definitely make them again. I followed the recipe exactly but did refrigerate them for a couple of hours. They held together very well during cooking. I'm not a mayonnaise fan so made the lime "mayo" with sour cream instead and it really made the burger.

I altered the recipe slightly, doubled it, and grilled the burgers. They were good, not amazing, I plan to make them on a regular basis in the future. After reading reviews I decided to add 1 egg and 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to the mixture (4 servings). This REALLY changes the consistency of the mixture and you can pureé the entire thing much more finely. After forming the patties (which were fairly large) I dropped them in a bowl of bread crumbs so they wouldn't be so sticky. I then chilled them overnight and then froze them, letting them thaw about 15-25 minutes in the open before I put them on the grill. Despite all the reviews these burgers stayed together amazingly on the grill sheet, they were even more cohesive than some hamburgers I've eaten. If I were doing this recipe again I would probably add some of the lime zest to the patty mixture and a touch of cinnamon maybe 1/2 a teaspoon to a teaspoon, depending on how adventurous I was feeling. Also, tweaking the sauce is a very good idea, I added some chipotle for flavor and paprika for color next time I'll probably add chives and someone suggested sriracha sauce. Anyway, good recipe, not perfect, but definitely going to make it again.

I made mine in a pan and didn't have any crumbling. I made mine exactly as the recipe stated and actually refrigerated mine for over an hour (instead of just 10 minutes), so I think that helped keep them from crumbling because my burgers were very firm.

The lime mayo is a great addition and I will make that again for other sandwiches in the future as well.

So many times when making recipes, I find that the serving # didn't seem right. So I made these burgers like I would normally make burgers, a little on the thin side. Not so good with this recipe. We enjoyed the taste, they were just so hard to keep together. I baked them (400) on a non- stick pan with a bit of evoo and didn't flip them. Let them cool a touch after I could tell they were done then served. Overall, they were good, I would just add a note - don't try to stretch this recipe - it truely makes 4.

oh dear. Something went terribly wrong! I followed the recipe exactly. The burgers never firmed up in the pan... they just became warm mush. The only thing I did differently was to leave the patties in the fridge overnight before cooking. Could that have done it? Any thoughts are welcome. I really liked the flavor so I'd love to be successful at this.

I was amazed at how good these were. I added about a half of a serrano chile to the mix, and then added a tiny bit of chipotle to the mayo. We used a grill-top sheet with small perforations, oiled it, refrigerated the patties for a good half-hour before cooking, and had no trouble with falling apart. Also cooked them for quite a bit longer than the recipe calls for. We also used half fat-free plain yogurt instead of all mayo, and served them in pitas. I'm not a fan of mayo on burgers but that mixture was great, as were the pitas!

Follow the recipe exactly, and you'll be very pleased. These are excellent! However... I did tinker with the lime mayo by adding the zest of 1/4 lime (instead of just 1/4 tsp), which gave it a better balance of "lime" and "sour".

These are great. I used a lot of previous reviewer's suggestions. I did not use a food processor at all. Just chop the onions fine rather than coarse, and use a pastry cutter to mash the beans and walnuts before mixing together with everything else. I added the avocado on top and also a little melted cheddar when I flipped them. I also froze them, uncooked, and thawed prior to cooking and they turned out just great.Having several of these in the freezer makes for a quick and delicious meal.

I amended this recipe, as I do with many, not only on this site, but from magazines etc. Used chick peas, additional oil(for the creaminess of pinto beans) deleted cilantro and used basil. Does it make it the same recipe? I think so it's a bulgur burger. It's great 3 and a half forks.

These are absolutely delicious. I read the other reviews and added extra beans - used red kidney beans (a large can) and everything else was by the recipe. The burgers held together well and were extremely tasty. Even the meat-eating teenagers loved them.

I would have given this three forks, but the egg and breadcrumbs are a must--even with them I wouldn't try it on a grill, and I dredged the patties in additional breadcrumbs to assist with holding them together. For that reason, I took a fork off. However, I will definitely use this as a base for veggie burgers in the future. They could use just a little more flavor, but the texture and grain/protein ratio were fantastic and just what I want in a veggie burger. I think a little more spice and they would be amazing. There is a black bean burger on this site that is also great, and is more flavorful, but these had a better texture.

While these burgers were a bit "loose" or lacking in body, they were really one of the best versions of veggie burger I have tried. Love the spice and taste. I made them stove top but will try them on the BBQ grill next time. Perhaps more beans will make for a better consistency and a less fragile burger. Will try that next time as well.

Made these exactly as written and they turned out great. Very yummy and healthy -- we would definitely make them again.

These taste great! Having said that I only give them 3 stars because of a few things. I added an egg and some torn up bread (maybe 1 cup?) as a binder because from the look of them there was no way they would stay together as written. That helped, and they stayed in one piece while cooking them in a pan. However, I feel certain they would fall apart if you cooked them on the grill (with or without my added binder). For those cooking in a pan, be patient. I cooked over medium high heat for at least 6 minutes on each side. That way you only have to turn them once, and they are less likely to fall apart. Also, four servings? My mix made 5 GIANT burgers - I could have easily gotten 8 normal sized burgers from this recipe. However, great tasting veggie burger, and I certainly will make them again.

These were quite good and would have been 4 forks if they didn't fall apart so easily! When we ate them they kind of just squished out of the bun. I don't have a grill pan so we made them on the stove. Served also with avocado on top.

I made this for a picnic and didn't have a food processor. I used a pastry cutter to mash up the beans and nuts and even though they were chunky, they were fabulous. I also added extra cumin, coriander, soy sauce to taste, a touch of salt, a clove of pressed garlic and the secret ingredient...the juice of about one lime or to taste. YUM!

Made a lovely girl's lunch item with some rose on the deck! We subbed roasted pumpkin seeds for the walnuts and topped with sauteed mushrooms, had a watercress salad on the side and made extra lime mayo to dip some oven fries in-divine! These will be made en-masse and vacu-sealed for later use.

Delicious! Made them on a grill pan. Somewhat crumbly and difficult to flip, but solved with the addition of a 1/2 C bread crumbs and an egg to the mix before forming patties.

We absolutely loved this dish. We substituted ground coriander for the cumin; but, other than that we made the recipe as suggested.

Excellent. Definitely a favorite veggie burger.

This was delicious and very easy. I added a little more cumin because i love it and didn't change anything else except i did put it in a whole grain pita from whole foods instead because its a bit crumbly if you don't handle correctly on the grill. i'm surprised they didn't put it in a pita as well in the recipe. in any event, very healthy, easy and delish!
