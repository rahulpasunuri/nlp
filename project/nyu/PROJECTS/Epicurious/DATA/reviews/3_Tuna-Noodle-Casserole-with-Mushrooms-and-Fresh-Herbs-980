So if you make a tuna casserole but don't use this recipe, it will be fine. That's what I got from the comments. Having made it, I would agree.

Pretty Good for Tuna Casserole.

I've been making this recipe for years with variations on the theme, and I love it. Tonight I think I finally got my best combination: - I used whole grain, cholesterol free egg noodles, sauteed the mushrooms separately from the veggies (and I added 1/2 red bell pepper chopped plus 1 serrano chopped fine). I also only use 4.5 tablespoons butter and the rest olive oil (the 4 tbsp in the bechamel, the .5 in the pan with olive oil for the veggies). Once the mushrooms brown, add a splash of sherry, and add a little Old Bay to the bechamel. Increased the amount of liquid to 3.5 cups (a combination of 1.5% milk, light cream, and skim -without increased amount of liquid the casserole is too dry). Lastly, used Panko bread crumbs with white cheddar and italian parsley with a drizzle of olive oil on the top. By far the best combination.

Use Kosher salt liberally...this accounts for most of the blandness of this recipe. I used dried rosemary and thyme, and this resulted in a rather stuffing-like flavor. Might try different spices next time...garlic, bay leaf, white wine? Otherwise, it's a good, basic recipe for do-it-yourself tuna casserole.

Very disappointing, considering the ingredients. We followed the recipe to the letter, as written. Beautiful and fragrant out of the oven, but bland to the taste. We were hoping for a sophisticated twist on a favorite childhood comfort dish on a cold winter night, but this wasnt it. From the other reviews, it sounds as if the recipe works if you customize it with additional ingredients.

This was really tasty. However, in order for it to serve 4 as a main I had to triple the amount of noodles. I also substituted 1 1/2 cups of skim milk instead - the sauce still came out nice and creamy. Will make again.

As written, the dish may not have a lot of flavor. I add chopped garlic, shallots (or scallions), and white wine. I also like a dash of worcestershire sauce and tabasco.

I was so embarrassed when I brought this to a neighborhood gathering. It was so lame. It barely had any flavor and it was mushy and bland. For the amount of effort I put into making it and the cost of all the extra special ingredients it was very disappointing.

My husband and I really enjoyed this sophisticated casserole. The buttery bread crumbs (I used panko) really made the dish. The best part is the inexpensive ingredients that you are very likely to have on hand.

This is four forks for tuna noodle casserole, but I think it's a great recipe. I doubled it for a potluck dinner and there was plenty. Based on reviews, I added green peas and a diced red pepper for color. I used half button and half baby portobello (shitakes are VERY expensive), and also a lot of fresh rosemary and thyme from the garden. My contribution was to add 2 dried red Thai peppers, seeds and all, minced. This added a little kick and really added a lot to the flavor. I also used margarine and soy milk to address dairy allergy and it worked well. Also, I did not brown the bread crumbs, just sprinkled panko on top and let the oven brown them. Try the hot pepper -- I think it makes a huge difference. Enjoy.

Afternote: I also added 1/2 cup of frozen peas to the vegetables below before I threw them in the saute pan. Soooo good- but really if you want a quick meal save this delicious recipe for guests- they really will kiss the cook!

I love this recipe- will make it again. read over all the other reviews and tweaked it according to what others said as I figured the people who didn't like it either didn't season it enough or didn't use the recommended ingrediants. 1) a) make the sauce according to the recipe- add 1 can undiluted cream of mushroom soup b) add 2-3 Tablespoons fresh rosemary, 1 Tablespoon ground dried sage, 1/2 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes and a dah of cayanne to the sauce while its hot and let them meld a minute 2) use 2 Cups Portabellas, 3/4 cup green onions, 1 diced shallot, AND............ (continued in next review)

Rating: 4
season well with salt and pepper as you saute them according to the recipe. (do not add any extra salt and pepper to the sauce until you mix in the vegetables and taste it then- remembering that noodles will take away some of the seasoning 3) 3 cans chunk white albacore tuna- chunked and flaked into the sauce then mix in the noodles. 3) topped with 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar and 8 crushed (but not finely) Vegatable crackers 4)pan sprayed lasagna dish 5) baked 25 minutes - you will use every pot in the kitchen but it is worth it- a HUGE meal for 2- would be perfect for 4-6.If your looking for a quick evening dinner- save this one for guests- they will love you for it! Better than momma's! YUUUUUMMMMMM!!!!!

With an empty refrigerator I scavenged around. I used dried shitake mushrooms and found a can of unsweetened evaporated milk but only 1 1/2 cups. After rehydrating the shitakes I used some of the shitake flavored water and added it to the sauce. Turned out great - not fishy at all and a nice shitake flavor.

This was yummy! I used yellow onion, kale & peas in addition to the mushrooms (no celery or green onion in the house). I grated some fresh parm in between the casserole and bread crumbs. I also used 2 cans of tuna...

Made the recipe with the changes suggested from the cook in Boston. Consistancy was good, I definitely wouldn't want it any dryer. But I felt it was lacking some flavour still. Next time, I am going to try adding some cheddar cheese and a pinch of dry mustard.

I have made this several times now and it's very good. TOTALLY agree on the bread crumbs. You need maybe half of what's called for in the recipe. I don't like shiitake mushrooms much, so I just mix other varieties.

I WILL make it again but with some changes. The flavor was very good but it was so DRY. WAY TOO MANY beadcrumbs and it really needed more fluid. Next time, I will decrease the breadcrumbs to 1/2 cup. I'm not sure how I will increase the creamy-ness but it definitely needs something.

I agree that it is a drier version of tuna casserole but that is preferred at my house. I added a cup of peas which was a good decision since they provided a nice color contrast.

I don't get all these neuvo food snobs and their tireless reviews. This IS really good. My picky 16 year old had 3rds. My neighbor couldn't believe how good it is. He said I should've sent in a pic. of it too!! No need to "tweak" if you follow directions. Maybe it's the fresh herbs and the fresh bread crumbs? Thanks for this, it's a definate keeper.

This recipe seems never to have seen a test kitchen. It has too much flour, too many noodles and too many bread crumbs. If you want a heavy, dry tuna noodle casserole, make it as directed. If,however, you prefer a creamy, light one, decrease the flour to 2 TBS, increase the milk to 3 cups, use 6 ounces of noodles and reduce the bread crumbs to three quarters of a cup. You don't need quite as much butter as indicated either. With all these revisions, it's four forks!

Rating: 3
This recipe is great. I cut out the shiitake mushrooms (don't like em) and added a ton of button mushrooms. Doubled the fresh herbs, and added 1 cup cheddar cheese to the mix. If you're pressed for time and don't want to do the breadcrumbs, just sprinkle some cheese over the top and pop it in the oven. I'm thinking I might try adding slivered almonds to my next batch, just for a little extra crunch.

Rating: 3
I have made this dish many, many times since it was first published in 1995 and everyone I have served it to loves it. Whenever I want comfort food, I turn to this dish; it's also a favorite for apres-ski. You can make the whole thing ahead up to its final baking; refrigerate overnight; then pop in the oven (if cold when you put it in the oven, just add a little more time for the final baking). My only changes from the original recipe are: 1) I use 2 tsp each of dried herbs (not 1 tsp); 2) I use 1 lb of fresh tuna instead of canned, and broil it, then cool it and flake it; 3) I use panko breadcrumbs ... gives a nice crunchy top; 4) I use more mushrooms: a 4-oz pkg of shiitakes, and an 8-oz pkg of button mushrooms. I also recommend that you use plain old dried egg noodles (like Prince or Mueller or Pennsylvania Dutch) ... don't try to get fancy with fresh pasta. I find that this dish easily serves 6 (even tho it says 4).

Rating: 3
This recipe is a nice twist on an old standby. I like to use a third kind of mushroom, however, and I like more of them (3 cups.) I also think it's better to sautee the mushrooms on their own first until they're a deep golden brown color (more flavor) then add the onions and celery. The celery and onions release too much water, which keeps the mushrooms from browning well. Finally, it needs more salt.

Rating: 3
This is the best of the tuna noodle recipes in my current cooking project of "Church Potluck Rehabilitated." The shiitakes are definitely worth the expense and making the classic white sauce is worth the trouble. Subtract the rosemary and add 1 cup cheddar to the sauce and you have the classic version. If using rosemary, add some parmesan to bread crumbs. 375 degress makes the topping better. DEFINITELY use the vacuum packs of tuna for much more flavor, and 1/3 cup diced red bell pepper sauteed with the onions, etc. rounds out the flavors. This is the rural Ohio of my youth revisited and redeemed!

Rating: 3
All and all not bad. It's not a startle the tongue kind of dish but rather a comfy cold weather stick to the ribs kind of dish. I reduced the butter and used 2% milk, added peas & used shitake and cremini mushrooms. I also used onions with the green onions and added sherry and about a half cup of asiago cheese. I didn't have bread crumbs so I just sprinkled some matzoh meal on top which added some crunch. My 8 year old grudgingly admitted it was pretty good.

I used chicken. I also used slightly more fresh herbs. Very nice, simple dish!

A good base with potential though it wasn't as creamy as I anticipated. I spilt more pasta in the pot when I was cooking it, messing up the proportions a bit. Next time, I'd like to increase the sauce and be a little more cautious in pouring in the pasta.

I added a little stock to this white sauce rather than using milk, for a bit of flavor. Also, this casserole is great with no tuna or with chicken. It's a good baseline recipe, and any veges you might have on hand would be nice mixed in.

My family really liked this recipe and I have since replaced my other tuna casseroe recipe with this one. Until (or if) I find one better, I will continue to make this recipe. My 2 and 4 year olds also like it so long as I pick out the mushrooms before serving it to them.

All the underage eaters in my household independently said this was really good. It is true that this is not a knock your socks off recipe, but then I don't think it is meant to be. But it is definitely comfort food. I forgot the rosemary, and didn't have mushrooms (I wonder if the kids would have eaten it with mushrooms). Peas were an excellent addition. It's definitely a nice supper for a cold winter's night. I sauted the vegies first, put them in a large bowl, and used the same saute pan to make the white sauce. So, together with the pot to boil the noodles, this recipe used only 2 pans/pots, and one bowl- not an inordinate amount of washing up to do. I also double it, so I would have some to put in the freezer.

It was easy, fast and very good. We left out the mushrooms to make it more kid friendly, and it came out great. It was a nice updated version with the fresh herbs.

I've made this recipe a couple of times and really enjoy it. I cut the butter in half each time it's called for to reduce calories and add 1/2 c. peas and a generous dose of salt and pepper.

I thought this recipe was so-so. It was bland and dry. Instead of using celery, I substituted peas instead. I didn't use shitake mushrooms, I used white button mushrooms in its place. The sad part was, I liked Tuna Helper better than this. Will not make this again.

Excellent comfort food on a night when we needed comfort! Used all button mushrooms instead of shiitake, and drizzled milk over the top halfway through baking as it looked a little dry. I also added a little cheese--personally I think this is rich enough w/o cheese, but it was requested by my guests. The cream sauce is a great twist on regular tuna noodle casserole. The whole thing was gone by this morning, and I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
A very tasty casserole! I made this with leftover baked albacore, and used (as previously suggested) lowfat cream of celery soup + 1 soup can of 2% milk in place of the cream sauce. After you saute the vegetables, you can add the soup, milk, and flaked tuna directly into the saute pan (saving one bowl, at least!) Used white mushrooms only, and sliced sourdough bread for the crumb topping. Definitely needs plenty of fresh ground black pepper! I don't think this dish needs cheese to be good (and it's rare I'd say that) but I would have liked to add the traditional green peas (my husband the pea-hater was thrilled I didn't!) All in all a very nice recipe that I will definitely make again.

Rating: 3
This is a great, updated version of a childhood favorite. I've made it with both tuna and chicken and enjoyed both. Instead of making the white sauce, I just use a can of whatever kind of cream soup I have on hand--mushroom, chicken, or celery--and whisk in one can of whole milk. It saves time and cuts out some of the butter. I also add red pepper or green peas for some bright color. I've not tried shitake mushrooms in it yet--just regular button. The fresh herbs are what pulls it all together for me and makes it more memorable than mom's.

Found this recipe worked well with a "few" substitutions: Used only 6T. of butter, and sauteed the green onions, celery and 2t. dried thyme in it , then added the flour, cooked about 1 minute, then added homemade chicken stock instead of milk ; added 1c. grated sharp white cheddar cheese after sauce thickened. Didn't use mushrooms or rosemary as did not have them on hand. Also added to the sauce red pepper flakes, and a drop or two of tobasco. Used bucatini pasta as did not have egg noodles. Left out the bread crumb topping, sprinkled 1/2c. grated sharp white cheddar on top the last 15 minutes of baking. Let stand for at least 10 minutes after removing from oven to let pasta finish absorbing the sauce. Cleanup not too bad as I sauteed the vegetables in the butter for the sauce and left out the breadcrumbs, flaked the tuna directly into the sauce from the can and mixed everything together in the pot used to cook the pasta. Next time I'll try it with the mushrooms.

I modified this a lot based on others comments- the result was excellent. It does take a long time to make and uses a lot of dishes - nonetheless a WOW as I did it. I used half and half not homo.

I would do all of the above exactly the same.Close to company fare.

I had been looking for a considerable length of time for a Tuna Casserole recipe. I've tried several and not liked the results. It's sounds like a simple thing to look for; more difficult to find. This is the second time I've made it and the family enjoyed it very much. I also read where Tuna Casserole is a "comfort food" and wasn't aware of that. That title sure fit the my first attempts at making it; a very cold winter day and I was looking for just the right dish. Thanks so much I enjoy surfing the recipes; sometimes I spend so much time looking I don't have the time to make them. Have a great day. Sincerely A. shupe

With modifications, which I can sum up without your having to read below, this recipe earns a solid three forks. I omitted the celery entirely, added half an onion along with the scallions as well as peas and grated cheddar, plus an egg to fluff it up a bit. Sprinkled it with parmesan and the sourdough breadcrumbs with garlic and onion salt (happened to be out of garlic -- a rare occurrence). Very nice comfort food.

I agree with a lot of the other cooks: the sauce is bland and needs HELP, ie sharp cheddar. I didn't have any so I used grated romano and some blue cheese.

After having this recipe sit around for a while, and not reading any of the reviews, I tried it. It was bland all right. I added peas because I love them, especially in a casserole. This recipe does have potential. I will make it again, but add sharp cheese (like cheddar) to the white sauce and maybe parmesan/romano to the bread crumb topping. Please note, and no one else mentioned this, that it takes 4 dishes to make this completely. One each for... the sauce, the veggies, the toasted bread crumbs and finally the baking dish. Quite a clean up for a casserole dish.

I made a mistake and used prepared, flavored bread crumbs instead of fresh. Next time I make it, I won't skimp on the little bit of extra labor. Other than that, it was delicious.

A good base to start from recipe wise - I followed the advise of a previous reviwer and added parmesan cheese - this upped the tasty quotient quite a bit - I also gave it a healthy dose of fresh ground black pepper.

Though I didn't rate this very high, I think it has a lot of potential. It didn't turn out quite as well as I expected. There wasn't enough sauce, and was very bland. We had to douse it with a lot of salt and pepper during dinner! I used whole milk, and I think maybe that thickened the sauce too much during baking. Does any one have suggestions on 1) the sauce problem, 2)how to "spice" it, and 3) how to reduce the fat. Your suggestions will be greatly appreciated!! I didn't care too much for the bread crumbs either, any suggestions on alternative toppings?

I used flaked salmon instead of the tuna and got rave reviews. It is a wonderful make-ahead dish, and another way to use salmon which we have an abundance of here in alaska. I have also added fresh grated cheese to the topping, and it was even richer tasting.
