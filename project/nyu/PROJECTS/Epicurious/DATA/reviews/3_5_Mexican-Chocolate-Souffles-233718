Excellent and easy. I couldn't find Mexican chocolate so I used good German chocolate. I used bittersweet (70% cocoa) but would use something a little sweeter next time (maybe half bittersweet and half milk chocolate). Per so many recommendations from reviewers, I cooked it 24 min. and I wish I'd done it for just about 20 as it was a little bit on the dry side.

This was very good and simple for a first time souffle baker. The whipped cream was excellent on top melting into the warm souffle. I wouldn't skimp on adding that. HOWEVER: 18 minutes in the oven was not enough. Leave them in until the centers puff. I had the filled ramekins ready and waiting in the fridge before the guests arrived and turned the oven on while sitting down to dinner. Timing worked out perfectly.

Easy to make and looked beautiful. However, I would add a little sugar next time; the flavor was too bittersweet for me and my guests.

This was very easy and equally delicious. I made the souffles about 2 hours before my guests came but did not put them into the oven until after dinner. They rose perfectly and were a big hit! It made 3/4 cup souffles.

This came together quickly and was a hit with the dinner guests. It took closer to 25 minutes for proper set, and it made twelve 3/4c souffles.

I LOVED This - very easy and it was the perfect texture for me, not gooey. It worked MUCH better in ramekins than in custard cups. Everyone I've served it to has raved.

Decadent & rich, but I will cook it a little longer till center is set. With the center softly set it was more like an ooze cake than a souffle
