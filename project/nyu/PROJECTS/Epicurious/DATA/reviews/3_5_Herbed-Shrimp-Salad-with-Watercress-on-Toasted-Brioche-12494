Tasty with tarragon, as well as some sliced avocado; try lightly toasting the bread for a bit more character. I prefer 'Shrimp Sandwiches with Tarragon-Caper Mayonnaise', also from this site.

This shrimp salad is fabulous...I'm not putting it on a sandwich - I'm putting in on baby spinach....cause that's what I have in the frig...otherwise I think any kind of salad greens would be nice.

This is wonderful. The watercress is a nice flavor and texture, rather than plain romaine, or frisee, or even iceberg. The herbs are delicous, and I even used frozen shrimp! Will most certainly make for guests.

you can substitute watercress with fresh parsley and also add some finely chopped green pepper and I added some seasoned salt. Before I added the seasoned salt it was quit flat. I made may alterations to taste and I loved it.
