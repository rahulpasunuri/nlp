I can't believe that this recipe got only 3 1/2 stars. It is easy to make and delicious! I have been baking this cookie every Christmas since I first found it in Bon Appetit, in 1996.

I make this exclusively at Christmas. Men love it!

I made seven dozen of these cookies a few years ago for a cookie exchange and they won 1st prize. By cutting them into the wedges and drizzling the chocolate in a "zig zag", they inadvertenly ended up looking like Christmas trees. Everyone loved the look and the taste. I'm going to make them for the holidays this year!

I thought these were fair at best. Followed the recipe to the letter. Baked half in a removable bottom pan, then did rest in a glass 8x8 to see if they would be better (they were, somewhat) Cookies seemed to have a bitter aftertaste so I skipped the coffee in the drizzle and just used semisweet chocolate-that helped the flavor balance. Oh well, won't make again but at least they were easy.

merely okay- not anything special- even in a bunch of hazelnut espresso lovers. I'm not forking because the other reviews rave so much I suspect a minor change I made maybe really affected the outcome.. I put it in a too- big pan, so the cookies were thinner and therefore not as tender as they maybe would've been otherwise. I'll probably give them one more try- but they'll need quite a drastic improvement before I can add a voice to the raves.

I made this for an easy dessert for a large group. They inhaled it! Everyone loved it. I only was able to taste one or two cookies, and they were great. I was so sad that they were all gone by the end of the night! Will definitely make again.

Delizioso! One bite with coffee or espresso and you think you're sitting in the Piazza Navona! Very sophisticated, not too sweet treat. Instead of semi-sweet chips I used the extreme dark chocolate chips from The Baker's Catalogue and loved the depth it gave the flavor of the hazelnuts. But the recipe for the icing makes way too much; I had half left over as I did not want to ice each cookie! Don't wait for the sauce to cool as it will be hard to drizzle it. As one person suggested, next time I will bake in a rectangular pan, cut into squares and then dip into the sauce; this will be easier than cutting the wedges and make a nice presentation. Be sure to bake this long enough so that the consistency is that of shortbread, not chewy as the problem one reviewer described.

Wow. I made these for a large group and there was a stampede to get the recipe. This is one impressive cookie. Be careful not to under-cook them. I recently served them as dessert with homemade tangerine ice cream. It was a great combination, and a big hit. Highly recommended.

I made these thinking they sounded good and also based on the positive reviews... but I have to disagree. A lot of work skinning the nuts :-( and not very tasty - kind of bitter. If you like that type of "treat" do yourself a favor and at least use milk chocolate (without the espresso powder or less of it) as a topping.

I put the batter all in one pan. I had to bake it a little longer because of this. It is really good. I found it a little difficult to drizzle the chocolate sauce on there but used a fork. I cut it into larger pieces then what was suggested. It was all gone at our family Christmas dinner.

I made these cookies years ago when the recipe originally appeared in Bon Appetit. They were my father's favorite Christmas cookie that year and I am making them again now for his upcoming visit. They have an excellent "gown up" taste which complements many "old favorites" that are sweeter.

easy and delicious. These were the first to go at a family gathereing recently. I agree that the chocolate drizzle is not drizzly...I just spread it haphazardly over each wedge. YUM!

These could not possibly be any better. The combination of hazelnut and espresso is unbeatable (even though I used instant coffee powder). For once, a recipe that needs no modification! P.S.

This is one of the best cookie recipes I've made. I added alittle extra espresso powder to mine. I stored them in the freezer, but they are disappearing fast. I don't think there will be any left by Christmas!

Molto bene!! Excellent!! The espresso and hazelnut combination is divine!! (I even used instant regular coffee). I also froze these and they tasted just as fresh when defrosted as out of the oven! They look great on a dessert tray!!

These have become a much-requested item for PTA events. I use half almonds and half pecans if I don't have hazelnuts, and they are great.

This shortbread is wonderful. Not only does it smell wonderful while it's baking; it tates divine. I patted the dough into an 8x8 square pan and then cut the shortbread into 24 bars. You won't be disappointed!!!!!

By accident I baked this double recipe in one pan. Now I do that every time, bake it a little longer - it's perfect. This has become a Christmas standard that friends and family watch for!

I had high hopes for this recipe as I adore hazelnuts, espresso and shortbread, and the unbaked dough was indeed scrumptious, but I ended up disappointed with the finished product. I'm an experienced baker and followed the instructions carefully but mine came out very chewy, not "short" at all. The following day they were still somewhat chewy but a lot harder, too. They were very easy to make and while the cookies weren't bad, they definitely were not what I know as shortbread.

I don't usually hover around the oven waiting for baking to be done - but I did with these! Unbelievably yummy! I found it a bit difficult to cut it into 24 tiny pieces, so with the second, I cut it into about 18. A bit easier for me to get them out of the pan.

I'm lucky the dough made it into the oven - Yummy! I substituted fresh ground espresso for the instant and had no problem. The only issue I had was it was difficult to "drizzle" the mocha sauce because of it's thickness...it was more like splatters of mocha, but it tasted great. It'll be a hit at the Holiday party!

This recipe is so simple to make, and definitely a hit to the dessert menu!! My party of twelve all raved about them!! This is definitely an easy but elegant addition.
