The first time I made this recipe (with boneless chicken breast) I found it complicated but the results were good. I have since made it a number of times and tweak the spices according to who is doing the eating! Since we do not eat shellfish I make this with chicken and my family LOVES it. Puncture some of the okra to adjust thickening. Sometimes I add green beans and other veggies.

I found this dish very disappointing-- not enough coconut taste for me and despite the myriad of ingredients, a bit bland. IF I made it again, I'd eliminate the chicken broth and substitute coconut milk. I'd also use a lot more salt and pepper.

So I modified this recipe a fair amount. Thanks to the modifications, it was REALLY quick and easy, and it turned out pretty well. I made coconut tofu to replace the scallops. That's a decent alternative if you don't want fish or shellfish, but I'm sure that the fish adds A LOT of flavor to this dish. Also used vegetable broth instead of chicken. I didn't bother boiling the tomatoes. I just cut quartered them and cut them lengthwise. Also didn't bother seeding them. The okra I used was frozen and precut. I microwaved it prior to putting it in the simmering liquid. It's fast, tasty, and healthy. I'll definitely make it again.

I happened to have all the ingredients on hand for this dish and decided, it was such a strange and interesting combo, to give it a go. It turned out really well! I used one whole jalapeno, and it was spicy enough, but in a good way. The sauce is quite exceptional and surprisingly easy. I am sure you could use different fish, or canned tomatoes and it would be fine. overall lovely blend of flavors and textures!

This sauce was amazing. I used heirloom green tomatoes, and Tilapia instead of scallops. I had no okra. Also, I used red onion. Loved it!

This dish was very disappointing - lots of work for nothing special.

Sorry-I forgot to add that I added a LOT more curry than the recipe called for as we like our food nice and spicy. I also put in an entire jalapeno.

I thought this recipe was delicious. I used mahi mahi instead of scallops and canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh. I do not have a blender where I am right now so I sauteed the onions, jalapenos, garlic and ginger then added the rest of the ingredients as per the instructions. Then I added chunks of fish and it was delicious! Nice and spicy. I served it over couscous and my husband loved it.

The sauce was not thick enough, and not flavorful enough for us (could have used more curry). I did replace the okra with green beans as suggested by another rater, and that worked well. All and all though, a marginal dish.

I felt the sauce overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the scallop. The sauce is excellent, however, the scallop should have been the highlight. I might try sauce with chicken.

This was an outstanding dish, and easier to make than it sounds like at first. The three teaspoons of jalapeno was too much for our taste--one to two would probably do the trick. You might also wait to add the okra and tomatoes (especially) later in the cooking process. Ours got somewhat mushy, maybe because we had huge scallops that required significant time to cook. Would definitely make it again!

Yummy sauce. I made some basic substitutions and the dish was still fabulous! Since I'm not crazy about Okra, I only used 1/4 pound and added green beans instead. I also tried it with tofu instead of scallops - delicious. Next time I will try with chicken.

I usually double the sauce when making recipes on this site, but found that this recipe has more than enough sauce on its own. I recommend following it as written (although I would double the tomato next time). I used frozen sliced okra and it was perfect.

quite good. my weeknight version: frozen scallops, 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 can light coconut milk, fresh okra. blanch the okra, sear scallops, simmer everything for as long as it takes the rice to finish cooking.

Why is it that even so-called "gourmet" Western recipes for Indian food call for curry powder. Indian cooks don't use curry powder; they have too much respect for their cooking.

Great Indian flavor and the okra made it unusual, however the next time I would cut them in half before putting them in the 2nd time to make them more bite size. I ddin't have any jalapenos at home, but I stuck a chipotle pepper (in adobo sauce) in the food processor and it came out great.
