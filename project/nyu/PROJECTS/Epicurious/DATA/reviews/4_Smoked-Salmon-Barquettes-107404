This was quick and easy to throw together, though that's probably because I skipped making the barquettes and simply served the salmon salad on wasabi rice crackers as a passed hors d'oeuvre... It was very tasty and popular!

Save even more time by purchasing the tiny ready to serve party tarlet cups. I made the filling exactly as is though added a touch of garlic seasoning and a rinsed caper on top. I had probably about 32 tarlets and everyone liked them!

I didn't have time to make the pastry shells. I just brought the filling and crackers to a party. It was a huge hit (even without the pastry shells). Since I was using it to spread on crackers I added a little cream cheese to make it go farther. It was great with the cream cheese and great as is. I WILL make this again.

every time I prepare this dish, I'm asked for the recipe! I also simplify by using mini water wafers rather than the barquettes.

Made these for a special birthday and everyone loved them. I also used small, pre made pastry shells to save time, just toasted and cooled before filling. Added small cut chive pieces on top for garnish. I think next time I might add a VERY small amount of dijon or wasabe paste for an added kick and leave out the salt. The smoked salmon brings enough salt to this recipe.

I used the filling part of the recipe and served with endive; great for hors d'heuvres and you can make filling in advance. I left out the butter and used reduced fat sour cream

I made this easy - I bought little pastry shells from my local gourmet store and filled them with the filling. lovely appetizer!

I made this for my mentor Chef, and it was lovely. I used my cookie cutter to cut out small rounds of puff pastry which added some height to the appetizer. I also added some ricotta for extra body, and instead of roe, the ususal caper with a thin slice of salmon for garnish. Can't wait to have guests over again so I can eat these little delights!

I made this on Christmas Eve, and it was such a hit that I doubled it for New Year's Eve. I admit that I used endive leaves instead of the pastry barquettes, in the interest of time and adding veggies to the offering. Delicious, and so easy!

This is the kind of company recipe I adore: tiny, with mega flavor! I have trouble making pastry, so I used pre-made mini phyllo shells. Elegant, and freed up time to work on more elaborate recipes.

Pretty little salmon boats. I liked that componnets of this recipe could be made in advance. We used the holiday feast menu as a Carnavale Party menu and everything was a big hit.
