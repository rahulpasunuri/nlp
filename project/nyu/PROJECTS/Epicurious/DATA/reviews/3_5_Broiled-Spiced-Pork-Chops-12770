My family loves this recipe. I used an empty seasoning shaker to make the rub in bulk. Its easy, quick, and almost no prep time required. Guests were impressed and thought they were eating gormet!

I love this recipe! I make it for my family atleast once a month! Not just for chops either. This rub tastes great on most any pork cut. I have taken the spices and mixed them together on a larger scale and put it in an empty spice jar labeled pork rub. THat way I just pull it out sprinkle it on and cook it. . .done! Great for the after work dinner guests.

Be careful with the broiling - my oven practically burned the pork chops in 4 minutes. They were cooked through by the time I pulled them out to flip them.

Followed the directions to the letter and ended up with a pork chop that tasted like a Christmas cookie. *?!?!?!?* My husband, thankfully, was kind enough not to say anything and politely ate his in silence. Definitely not to my liking and I'll never make it again.

A keeper. Quick and my picky family liked it. No extra fat is a plus for a pork chop recipe. Served with couscous.

I thought the original recipe was good but I made a few modifications. I didn't have any ground cloves so I stuck a few whole ones in each chop instead. I found a can of pineapple chunks in the pantry and tossed a few in with the chops and basted with the juice. Next time I will add some brown sugar to the rub for a yummy caramelized crunch.

My favorite kind of dish, quick, easy, and delicious. Picky kid liked it, too. The dish went well with Sweet and Sour Sauted Apples!

Pretty good recipe. The spices made the house smell yummy on a cold and dreary evening. I broiled the chops in a oven-proof skillet and then sauted some Granny Smith apples slices in the pork drippings, along with some brown sugar, butter and apple jack(apple brandy). I threw in some dried cranberries for color. Next time I might add some broth for more sauce. It's a keeper.

The spice rub was delicious, and I combined this recipe with two others by brining the chops for 3 hours in salt, brown sugar, cinnamon and a quartered orange, as well as sauteed apples and dried cranberries in butter and brown sugar with the chops' drippings as an accompaniment. It was out of this world - an excellent winter dish.

This was different and delicious. My husband loved it as did my kids, one of which is a very picky eater. Will definitely make again. Always nice to have a new recipe for pork chops.

I didn't think the pork had much flavor even though I rubbed a lot of the spices into it. Prefer barbequed chops with the store-bought sauce...just as easy to make but with more taste.

I have had this recipy in my "box" for 5 years now. It is my favorate pork chop recipe to date. If you don't have ground cloves. . . Crush whole cloves! It brings out the flavor of them all the more! I hardly ever cook pork any other way! This is also great on boneless skinless chicken breasts!

This recipe was a pleasant surprise. The ingredients for this recipe seemed unusual at first, and while it was cooking we all felt like we were baking christmas treats. However this meal was delicious. We have already made this again.

We grilled these on an outdoor grill and they were terrific and distinctive. The listed repice amounts are absurdly small. We made four trimmed boneless porkchops (6 oz ea.?) and had to literally quadruple the recipe to get full coverage with the spice rub.

My husband and I both thought this was really good. The house smelled wonderful and this was very quick and easy to prepare! I did add a tiny bit of ginger, just for kicks and it worked well.

My family did not like this recipe, we all thought the chops did not have enough flavor.

I needed a quick pork chop recipe, and this fit the bill. I didn't have any ground cloves, so I used a pinch of ground ginger instead, and it was great. My husband LOVED it! I served it with sauteed diced red potatoes (in olive oil & a little butter, with salt & pepper) & a green salad. I will definitely make this dish again.

Extremely tasty. Have made twice in two weeks already.

Very tasty, although my girlfriend liked this much more than I did. The spices add a flavor I'd never had with pork chops before and they were quite a nice surprise.

Very good and easy, a little dry though.

A great quick dinner. My husband is not a big pork chop fan, and he raved. Even the kids asked for seconds. Would also be great on the grill. A real must for busy moms.

My boyfriend and I thought that this was really good. I've never been a big fan of breaded or floured chops. And could it be easier to prepare? Perfect for a quick dinner. I served with rice pilaf.

Very simple and tastey. I also recommend serving with mango chutney, which complements the spices.

I'm from northwest Ohio where they fry the porkchops until they oink and run away. This recipe is easy to make and very tasty. The spices bring out flavors that I haven't found in Pork Chops before. Couldn't recommend it more highly!

A wonderfully tasty recipe that was very easy to make. Great for a quick dinner that doesn't come freeze-dried from a box.

This has got to be ne of the easiest meat dishes I have ever made. It was quick, it was inexpensive, and the mixes of spice seems to lend itself well to either doubling or substitute similar spices and still brings out the distinct flavors of the spices it's been mixed with.

Wasn't crazy about it at first but after a few mouthfuls, it grew on me. It was nice to have a piece of meat without a heavy sauce on it. Plus, the ingredients are always on hand.

It was an unusual flavor, but I was disappointed in the dish.

This is especially good with warm mango chutney spooned over them.
