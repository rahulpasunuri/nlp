chicken stayed moist and garlic was a nice addition, but overall lacking in flavor.

It was just okay for me. I thought the sauce was "watery".

Delicious and easy. I cooked the garlic with the skins on and then put the sauce through a strainer--easily done and the pulp thickened the sauce. I wonder if the author didn't forget to put this step in. A food mill would work too.

Firstly, the photo is not indicative of what you'll get if you follow the recipe. There is no way you'll get that all over golden brown color and you'll have to peel the garlic which just seems silly. I brined my chicken first, peeled the garlic and used half of the recommended amount. I added a little chicken stock to the sauce before simmering and broiled the chicken after simmering to get a better color. Also added some slow roasted tomatoes for color and flavor. Good taste ugly presentation without extra work. http://www.flickr.com/photos/missmarnie/3950758896/

Very good. I cut it up the next day and put it in Pasta. Does anyone know exactly why you're not supposed to peel the skin off the garlic? It may be nice not to have stray peel on the chicken/ in the sauce

Used peeled garlic, one cup of wine (oops, I was out), three cups of chicken stock (I wanted to double the sauce for the roasted garlic mashed potatoes), used dry thyme (again, oops, this was last minute), cooked it all in my dutch oven and stuck it in the oven, covered, at 325 for an hour. The only way to mess this one up is to not season the chicken pre-browning well enough. This is going to be a weekly dish at our home.

I've tried this twice, peeling the garlic both times. The first time I used chicken with skin and bones, and the dish was a bit greasy. Another problem I had was that, despite using the suggested amount of olive oil, the skin stuck to the pan (I even tried it with 2 different pans with the same result), so I had the greasiness without the attractive brown skin. The second time I used bonesless skinless chicken breasts and the result was much better, although I probably shouldn't have added them back for the full 20 minutes of cooking time because it was a little dry. After 20 minutes, the sauce had reduced to only 2 Tbsp. of very flavorful sauce. Don't think I'd make it for company, though.

This recipe was great. I used chicken thighs and peeled the garlic, added onion and mushroom, added way more liquid and braised in the oven covered at 325 degrees for a few hours. To finish it I crisped the skin under the broiler, separated the vegetables, poured the sauce into a grease separator, strained and reduced the sauce and added everything back into the pot. I served it with sauteed chard, lentils, and wild rice and it was fantastic.

We don't use much thyme in my house, so I substituted in cilantro, and used half as much garlic. It was delicious, but I'll definitely use the recommended amount of garlic next time, and add chicken broth because the sauce was in high demand.

My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe, and it's not particularly tough. I managed to make it difficult by trying to cook two other things at the same time, but on its own, it's a pretty easy dish. The wine flavor really comes through as compared to other similar dishes I've made.

Rating: 4
I don't usually give 4 forks unless the recipe is truly exceptional, but this recipe deserves it because it is so simple and delicious, and the ultimate comfort food. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs as well as legs, and seasoned well with S & P. I added about 1/2 cup chicken broth because I served this with Smashed Potatoes (on this site) and wanted a sauce for them. Instead of cooking on the stove top, I braised the chicken in the oven on 325 for 1 1/2 hrs. It was incredibly tender, the garlic was divine (spread on rosemary sourdough bread like butter!) and not overpowering at all. My husband and 3 small kids (under 4) all loved it.

Rating: 4
So easy and so delicious. I originally found this as a "based on" recipe, which halved the chicken and garlic but kept the amount of wine the same. Spinach or asparagus and mashed red potatoes round out the plate.

Absolutely fantastic. I made it as is the first time (but peeled the garlic first as per another review) and cooked down the sauce a bit, but there was so much fighting over the sauce that next time I doubled it and added some chicken stock. This had the added benefit of removing the need to move the chicken pieces around. Now I make it using only bone-in chicken thighs (I remove the skin to keep it from getting too oily). I served it on a bed of mashed potatoes with a spinach salad.

Though easy and a nice taste, I dhought that the sauce needed a little more flavor to make it an excellent recipe- next time may add lemon and a bit a cream.

I give this dish 4 forks because not only is it truly delicious, but it is profoundly simple, as another reviewer noted. My husband made it last night and I just ate some leftovers for lunch. So good! Do everything they say the first time you make it, and then adjust to your liking, because though personal tastes may enjoy a little tweaking, it really tastes great as is and deserves to be tried that way first. My tweaks: More liquid. We both missed a little more sauce, and so I would increase the wine and throw in a little chicken broth, perhaps adding a little salt to this, just to make up for the extra liquid. My husband declared "this is a leg dish" and I agree--perhaps with more liquid the breast pieces would moisten up, but I think that whole legs make the best dish. Also, this is a huge recipe! We made half of it, and have leftovers for a dinner and a lunch. I think a family of 4 would have at least one round of leftovers, half a recipe will feed a couple for two days. We ate it with mashed red potatoes and spinach, just like th picture, and I think mashed potatoes are the best starch to go with. Asparagus, sauteed chard or various other greens would do nicely for vegetable matter. Enjoy!

Thought this was great. Made half the recipe. Used Goya extra virgin olive oil. Browned the chicken well, and it had just the right browned appearance when the dish was finished. Drained the chicken on paper towels and added only a dash of olive oil before adding the garlic cloves. Peeled the garlic cloves, using the full amount. When the garlic cloves were nicely brown, soaked up a little olive oil with a paper towel, because some on this site had complained the dish was too greasy. Because I made half the recipe, the chicken was not crowded in the pan, and I did not need to move the chicken pieces from top to bottom; I simply turned them over every 5 minutes or so. Used VERY ordinary white wine. After removing the chicken, I cooked the liquids down slightly before pouring over the chicken. Delicious, especially the sauce with the garlic cloves, which were soft and yummy.

Rating: 4
Got rave reviews from very particular friends. I modified slightly by adding some chicken stock to cover the chicken while it cooked in the pot. At the end, I put the chicken in a baking pan and put it under the broiler for a few minutes to bring up the color. Also, I reduced the sauce so it was slightly thicker, poured it over the chicken after the broiling and then reheated all before serving. Incredible flavor. Garlic is not overpowering. Good recipe for dark meat chicken.

Easy and delicious! Choose your wine carefully, it makes a difference. I use a Spanish Fino from Montilla. The garlic is terrific with a warm baguette.

I used chicken thighs and, not being a white wine fan, 1/2 portion of chicken stock with 1/2 portion of red wine. For a lazy side dish, I layered thick-sliced Yukon Gold spuds over the chicken & braised it all in the oven (told you I was lazy!)Turned the broiler on for a few minutes to brown the potatoes. It was lovely & garlicky with some crusty bread & a glass of wine.

For a dish that is profoundly simple, this was amazingly good. Whole chicken with skin adds essential texture and substance to the sauce. The sauce would not have been as flavorful and could see how the recipe could be bland if boneless, skinless chicken were used.

After reducing the sauce, I added butter, cream, lemon juice & fresh parsley. I will definitely make this again.

This is one of our favorite rustic dishes. I make it with thighs only and add a little rendered bacon or pancetta after the chicken has cooked. It's great served with the White Bean Puree that can also be found on this site.

With onions and mushrooms added this became quite treat! Additional liquid given off by the vegetables meant a little more patience while the sauce reduced, but once done it was an elemental and satisfying dish. Followed the recipe more or less verbatim except for the veggies which went in just after the garlic. Didn't achieve as rich a colour as in the photos, but then food stylists have all the tricks, right?

Rating: 4
Loved this recipe. I did peel the garlic and reduced the sauce a little after I took the chicken out of the pan. Also, to make it more healthy, right before serving I pulled the skin off and put the "sauce" in a cup to skim off the fat. It was delicious! Great with parmesan mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.

This dish tasted nice, but it was so greasy. Combined with the peel and eat garlic, it proved to be a multiple napkin meal. If I were to make this again (which I wouldn't) I would prepeel the garlic and use boneless chicken (with skin).

I loved this and so did my husband. I adjusted the recipe for 1 1/2 chickens and it was so juicy and flavorful. After it was done, I transfered it into a 9 x 13 pyrex serving dish and just broiled the top a bit to crispin the skin. I added a few fresh sprigs of thyme and spooned some roasted carrots and sweet potatoes around it and it was a beautiful dish to serve to company. I also made it using rosemary instead of thyme for a different flavor.

I'm a garlic lover, so we made this as written. There's a change in the works, however. What's up with having to pick out the garlic skins? That's really not very appetizing for a "company" situation. Why not just use less garlic (peeled) to start with?

Although quick and easy and pleasant, I would not make this dish again. I didn't adjust the recipe in any manner - it's just bland. Too many other fab recipes out there to waste 5 heads of garlic and 2 cups of wine on this one.

I couldn't get over that with such a quick recipe I got the sweet flavour and the texture of roasted garlic. My husband's comment was - why haven't you made this before? Make it again!

Made this for the first time tonight, but, as usual, I modified it to simplify it. Only had about 1-3/4 lbs. of bone-in chicken breasts that I skinned and de-fatted (as much as possible). Placed the breasts in a small casserole dish. Then I sauteed 1 head of garlic cloves (peeled and smashed) in a little olive oil until nicely browned. Added 3/4 cup of wine, a bay leaf, and 1/4 tsp. dried thyme, and brought the mixture to a boil. Poured it over the breasts in the casserole dish and baked the whole thing about 40 minutes, covered, at 400 degrees (turned the chicken over once during the baking time). This was SO simple, and it omitted standing over the chicken to change it from top to bottom in the pot every 5 minutes. It was DELICIOUS, even though it didn't look like the picture, but who cares??? The juice that is leftover is wonderful, and I can't wait to use it as broth in another recipe. Served this with leftover "Mashed Potatoes with Green Onions and Parmesan" (on this site) and a 10 oz. box of very unimaginative Green Giant Teriyaki Vegetables. It was a meal TO DIE FOR, and SUPER SIMPLE!!!

I served it with mashed potatoes,green beans and a mixed salad with a light orange dressing. I did add a little flour to the pan before adding the wine.

Solid three-fork rating for this recipe. I would make it again, but would not necessarily want to serve it to guests that I wanted to impress. I peeled the garlic and added sautéed mushrooms which we enjoyed. Next time, I would do as another reviewer suggested and coarsely chop the garlic instead of leaving the garlic whole. This dish was really good the next day as leftovers, but still a solid three-fork rating in my opinion.

I gave this two forks as written, but after making it, I think it could be substantially improved by thickening the sauce with a mixture of cornstarch and broth, adding artichokes and sliced muchrooms, and peeling the garlic cloves.

I read the recipe wrong and used 5 cloves of garlic thinking I was being extravagant since I was only cooking 3 pieces of chicken. Good thing too since I had no where near 5 heads of garlic. I also peeled the cloves because I didn't understand how I was supposed to eat garlic with it's skin still on. Threw in chicken broth to make it a little richer. I might try it next time without this addition, but I'll definitely keep peeling the garlic. No interfering skin and the cloves ended up meltingly soft and mellow. Chicken was good too.

My husband made this last night and we loved it. The flavors were definitely subtle but in no way boring, unless you consider comfort food boring.

I made this dish for a dinner party of 12, with the catalan spinach and olive oil mashed potato recipes, and it was a hit. I did get a bit nervous about the initial intensity of the wine, and added a bit of chicken stock, but if I made it again, I would trust the recipe. I also used about 1/3 the total amount of garlic, but peeled. This didn't keep with the spirit if the recipe, but it came out beautifully.

Rating: 3
This dish was amazing! I did wonder if this recipe may be a little bland, from looking at the ingredients. I remedied this by adding a diced chorizo (Spanish sausage) as well as a leek (just the white and light green parts) at the time of sautéeing the garlic. I cooked it all at low heat for about 15 minutes to soften the garlic, and then added the chicken. I also tossed in a handful of sliced baby carrots to add color and flavor. This dish turned out amazingly: rich broth, golden brown, tender, and sooo flavorful. Don't be shy with the thyme either. Perfect comfort food with mashed potatoes and that spinach.

To the cook from Studio City; A good rule of thumb is to use a similar wine (but of lower pedigree) for cooking a dish than for accompanying the dish. For example, if you would serve a white burgundy with this dish, you would use a white burgundy to cook with. You could also use a closely similar wine but this can be a bit confusing unless your wine background is substantial. By sticking with using the same varietal and viticultural area, you are pretty well assured that the flavors and style will be complementary.

Rating: 3
A wonderfully flavorful meal with relatively low impact to the kitchen (only one pot). The chicken took much longer to finish for me than the recipe indicated (added about 15 minutes), but it was worth the wait. I served it with grains and roasted baby brussel sprouts, which was perfect -- added a bit of smokyness which was a nice accent.

I made it today substituting virgin rapeseed oil for virgin olive oil, which does not stand the cooking temperature. There is no idea in wasting virgin olive oil, which loses its aroma at high temperatures - virgin olive oil should only be used in salads and other cold dishes. Virgin rapeseed oil, on the contrary, stands well the high temperature and gives an interesting nutty aroma to the dish. I have eaten enough of chaffy oatmeal porridge in my childhood, so I peeled the garlic. I happened to have an extra half of a lemon and added it to the casserole, and also thickened the sauce with cornstarch. I used cheap Italian white wine (Soave) and do not recommend aromatic grape varieties such as Sauvignon Blanc for this kind of cooking.

The sauce was amazing, though the chicken seemed a bit weak. Maybe a bit more salt? We also couldn't figure out why one would leave the garlic skins on - they fall off and get in the way of the great sauce. We'd peel them next time.

I have not made this recipe but have a question of others. Do you have a rule-of-thumb when choosing a wine for cooking?

That being said, I heartily agree with those who liked/loved the dish. Simplicity is its own gift and reward. The only thing I did differently was cut the chickens into 6's, thigh and leg connected. The next time I'm going to add some bay leaves to the jus for the fun of it.....which is what cooking is all about, isn't it?

Hey disturbed cook from san fransisco "never braise boneless skinless blah blah blah YUCK"... I did just what you consider reprehensible, and "why bother", and mine probably turned out better than yours... very tender and juicy. Perhaps you don't know as much as you like to think you do (or at least stop trying to sound like you know it all). Please just critic YOURSELF and how YOUR version ended up instead of putting down others. FYI for those of you who are sceptical about making this without skins or bones... what worked for ME, was to add two tablespoons of butter and approx 1/2cup (give or take a couple tablespoons)chicken broth after the initial browning. If you quickly brown the chicken at a high enough temp, it will NOT dry out. I was liberal with the salt and pepper on the breasts prior to browning, and I added kosher salt toward the end of the whole process. Delicious, even the second day! Worked for me!

True confession - I have not made this recipe, but I wanted to share my best chicken recipe, which is similar, but much easier. Using a casserole dish, coat the bottom with equal parts lemon juice and olive oil (I probably use 1/4 ~ 1/2 cup of each). In that mix, put 1-2 head of peeled garlic cloves and any herbs you like. Lay chicken pieces over the top (I've used leg quarters, breasts, anything works) and cover the whole casserole with foil. Bake at 400 for 1 hour, and at the end, remove the foil to allow the chicken to brown and the skin to crisp. Your chicken will be juicy and tender and delicious, and it's so easy to roast some potatoes with oil and garlic and rosemary at the same time. Yum!

Reading the other reviews I was somewhat distrubed. None of these people followed the recipe. Never braise boneless, skinless chicken in a dish like this, it will come out dry, chewy and flavorless. YUCK. Why bother.

I adjusted this recipe for a more healthy approach by using boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I also peeled and coarsely chopped the garlic prior to cooking and added crimini (brown) mushrooms cut into fourths. To bring up the flavor, I added a third of a cup of non-fat chicken stock. Also need to adjust cooking time of chicken due to lack of bones & skin. Served over a bed of steamed arugula w/ dried red pepper flakes and black pepper sprinkled on top. Very quick, very easy for the busy woman!

The best!! I made it a few weeks ago with the sides (Catalan spinach & mashed potatoes w/ olive oil). Used chicken leg quarters & a whole bottle of Jacob's Creek Chardonnay I'd been DYING to get rid of. I could not bear to save any. I only used about 2 heads of garlic for 4 leg quarters. I would definitely suggest using more wine like I did and reducing the sauce if necessary after removing the chicken. I loved the sauce and it was great to have a lot of it--we used it all. I felt that the flavors came together amazingly well and the whole meal was perfect with the Ribera del Duero. I never expected it to be so addictive but I am craving it again today and I plan to pick up the ingredients on the way home! I will put in a bit more garlic this time and peel the cloves, maybe without crushing them. I don't think they'll dissolve in 20 minutes (actually I didn't time it but I cooked until tender), but we'll see. I didn't like the fact that you have to locate all the skins and put them aside--I sucked a few down accidentally. I would much prefer to be able to freely mash them into the potatoes or let them mingle with the spinach in one big, happy mess. I am a big fan of red-meat braises & coq au vin and I didn't expect much from this dish (no bacon, no mirepoix, what??), but it delivered all the flavor components I look for in a long-cooked dish. I tried it because I was totally intrigued by the idea of mashed potatoes with a fine olive oil, and boy, is it ever a gorgeous combination! I would definitely serve this for company. It is a communal, feel-good meal.

This was easy and fast to prepare; sauce very nice on mashed potatoes. However, I was not crazy about the garlic and I LOVE garlic. The cloves were softish but not quite cooked through and I think next time I would brown them longer and at a lower heat. Overall, nice for a quick weeknight dinner but not company fare.
