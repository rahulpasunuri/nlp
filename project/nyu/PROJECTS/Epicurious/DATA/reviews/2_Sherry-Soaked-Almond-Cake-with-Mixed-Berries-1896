Hmmmm..... My family really didn't like this one. Generally followed the recipe; I highly recommend using a food processor for the almond paste; then transfer to a bowl, gradually add the butter, and proceed with the recipe. There is WAY too much soaking liquid for the cake to absorb, AND it just didn't seem to add to the flavor of the cake. I wound up adding more sugar to the syrup, reducing the sherry further, and adding a little rum -- that helped a lot. This is a relatively easy cake to make, and a nice use for almonds and almond paste, but you have to be in the mood for it. Maybe as part of a dessert buffet?

I made this cake for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it, although there seemed to be more sherry concentrate than the cake could absorb. I skipped the mixed berries and, instead, lined plates with rasperry puree, topping the cake with sweetened whipped cream. Rave reviews.
