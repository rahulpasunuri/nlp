Very refreshing after a heavy thanksgiving dinner. Family enjoyed it. It's a sorbet, not an ice cream.

I love this recipe. I tried three versions: 1) as is 2) Used Splenda instead of sugar (1.5 cups) and 3) added Vanilla Vodka (a small bottle). The one with Vanilla Vodka was the best and the consistency was perfect. Not real hard (like the Splenda one) and not too soft as you might imagine with vodka added. The vanilla bean makes all scrumptuous. I thought the as is was the best, but once you had it with the vodka, it was hands down better. The Splenda was great for dieters, but it was very hard. I will make this again, with the vodka. :-)

the worst favor of ice cream I have ever had!

Perfect addition to our Thanksgiving menu. I've never worked with vanilla bean before, such a wonderful & robust flavor that seemed to fill the entire house. Next time, I will cut back on the sugar. This recipe will be a holiday tradition!

This recipe turned out great! After I read the reviews, I didn't fill the 2c of sugar all the way so it wouldn't be too sugary. But the flavor turned out very balanced and an overall success  I wasn't overpowered by sweetness or tartness. I liked the creamier, softer texture, unlike some sorbets. Also loved how it came out a little frothy. Everyone loved it; I will be making it again. Great recipe to try!

This was an interesting experiment. Made it for a sunday dinner and served with a brownie. I thought it was a nice balance of flavors, but not everyone else did. I froze the leftovers and have been using it up in smoothies or adding a few spoonfuls to add some interest to orange juice. It's great that way. I also saved the pulp (seemed like such a waste) and dried it. It made a great snack while it lasted.

Like many others, this seemed like a perfect palate cleanser after a holiday meal. Not so much--too intense for all but a couple of my guests. We ended up tossing out the leftovers.

The family loved this! Great balance between the tangy cranberry and the soft vanilla. I thought it was a little too sweet. Next time I make this I'll cut back on the sugar a bit.

So refreshing and pure. This is a great desert if you need something light and healthful to go with the rich dinner.

Made this for Thanksgiving -- it was a hit with all. I used a Mexican vanilla bean from Penzeys and think it was too strong -- will use a milder bean next time, perhaps half a bean. Will make again for sure!

Made this for Thanksgiving and loved it. Great creamy texture, not too icy, and the vanilla balanced the tanginess of the cranberry.

Made this recipe exactly as written. Used fresh berries with one whole vanilla bean. Flavor was fabulous, texture was perfect. Served a very small scoop to each guest immediately after dinner. Held back the pies for an hour or so. Will definitely make again.

I was disappointed with the resulting texture of the sorbet. I made one batch at home in a Cuisinart and another in a professional ice cream spinner. It was too soft for my tastes. Next time I may cut down on the sugar/cranberry ratio. Also did not use quite as much lemon juice as was called for because I tasted too much lemon. That said, everyone who tasted it at home raved about it...those who tasted it in the professional kitchen, not so much.

I served this sorbet at the end of a Thanksgiving main course, right before the pie to help put a punctuation mark on the meal. The tanginess of the cranberries in the sorbet really helped to create a translation between the main dishes and the desserts. This recipe calls for a whole vanilla bean, I'm going to try with half that. The vanilla was almost overpowering the cranberries, at least to me.

I made this as a first course for Thanksgiving to "cleanse the palate". It was delicious, but would not freeze! First it wouldn't freeze in my ice cream maker so I put it in the freezer overnight. The next morning, it was still liquid! I served it as a "cold cranberry soup".

Made this for Thanksgiving dessert alongside the apple galette from this site and it was an awesome combination! Yum. This was my first time using KitchenAid ice cream maker attachment, followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect and easy.

I just made this following the recipe exactly. Next time I will use less vanilla, I used a whole bean and the vanilla flavor was too strong. However, this sorbet is very refreshing.

I have made this twice now. First time with frozen berries and "suagr in the raw" (I ran out of regular sugar). This time with fresh berries and granulated sugar. Each has a distinctively different flavor...but I think the fresh berries adds to the tartness which is needed to offset the sweetness. It did give me the idea of playing with the types of sugar used in other recipes for sorbet. The Hawaiian turbinado sugar gave it an almost honey-like taste before. Only 3 forks because neither attempt set up as tightly as other sorbet recipes I've tried. I will play with the ratios in the future. So taste is fabulous, but texture needs improvement.

Yum, Yum...and YUM! This is a great kickoff to start the holiday season on light note. I didn't use the full amount of sugar - probably somewhere between 1 1/2 & 1 3/4 cups. Plenty sweet enough and really delish.

I have not made either recipe, but for those of you who liked this, there is a cranberry-vanilla coffeecake on this site (Gourmet Dec. 2008)

You could make it like a granita, freezing it in your freezer and stirring every so often. Search "granita" recipes on this site, and you'll find more detailed directions.

everyone is saying that this recipe is good, but don't get me wrong when I say this: I DON'T HAVE AN ICE CREAM MAKER! and so, is there any other way to make this?

Delicious! The combination is unexpected yet perfect. Love the tartness of the cranberry which is tempered by the sweetness of the vanilla. Perfect, light dessert!

WOW! Simple and wonderful, very pretty, as well. I used Splenda instead of sugar, this is a virtually fat free and calorie free dessert that is a Fall winner.
