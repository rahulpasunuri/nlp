We use fig paste and mozzarella cheese and one less egg than recommended. Good, salty taste - great for fall and winter comfort food.

Used fig jam instead of the quince jam & had to usee prosciutto. I think it's very important to only use a very very thin layer of both the jam & the dijon. Either could overpower the flavors. I liked the flavors, but this isn't something I'll make again.

This may be the worst lunch I ever made! I wish I had read the reviews! There was no serrano ham, I had to go with the prociutto, and I did use the manchego cheese, which cost the moon, plus the quince jam, which has very little taste where much was required--and it was horrible! Bad salty and nasty sweet. However, if one made changes such as those suggested by the other reviews, making it quite a different recipe, of course, the technique of dipping it in egg and frying it up in butter is catchy.

This was a decent sandwich. We made it with sourdough bread - but skipped on the Manchego cheese and used swiss instead. The sweet and salty taste is its strong point. I've made it three times and would make it again!

I had high hopes for this sandwich... it's a fancy grilled cheese and ham sandwich. The only good thing about it is that it's easy to make. However, I did not like the way it tasted... Sweet and salty, yuck. Plus, it was quite expensive... the manchego cheese cost me $10!
