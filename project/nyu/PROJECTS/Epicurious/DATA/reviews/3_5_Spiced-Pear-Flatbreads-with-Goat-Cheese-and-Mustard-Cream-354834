I can't give this recipe four forks because I only made the original recipe once, and thought it was just ok. However, I use this flatbread recipe constantly and throw all sorts of good toppings on. The flatbread, itself, recipe is incredible! On a stone it bubbles up, it's soft, chewy, perfection!

I thought this was fantastic. I did not make the dough but used package Naan as the crust. I've served this to guests and they loved it. I used blue cheese and goat cheese. Also, if you're in the area go to Woodberry Kitchen. It's a great place to dine.

I've made this several times already - it's quite addictive! The first time I used Gorgonzola for the cheese, but 'cheated' by using a store-bought Rosemary & Sea Salt Focaccia (sliced in half horizontally) instead of making the flatbread. (Place on flat pan, in hot oven or under broiler, just until everything is hot & cheese is melted.) Divine! ALL of the elements & flavours blend perfectly, and the arugula adds a perfect peppery-crunch to the soft, spiced pears. I served the mustard cream on the side - the perfect finish as the 'icing-on-the-cake', if you will - so each person could drizzle on however much they wanted. (BTW, there was exactly the right amount of mustard cream, as the focaccia can take a fair amount of it!) Since then I've made it several times, with different 'spins' on it, though I haven't changed the focaccia base; it's excellent! Try it with a bit of aged Cheddar grated over the pears, along with the blue cheese. Try adding a few thinly sliced red onions with the arugula, or perhaps your favourite salad dressing in lieu of olive oil (I use pear & blue cheese vinaigrette). And, just before serving sprinkle some roughly chopped, toasted pecans over the top. LOVE it! Thank you Chef Spike!

I made this for my family the other day, but I didn't have whole wheat flour, so I just used more all purpose flour. I also couldn't find the blue goat cheese so used regular goat. My grocery store was out of arugula, so I omitted that as well. It was just ok. I'm just kidding ... kinda. I did make all those substitutes, but I was one of the girls present when the first reviewer made this pizza and it was awesome! I made it again, just last week for another group of friends, without all the substitutes and again ... it was awesome! p.s. I doubled the sauce, assuming I'd keep the leftovers and use it the next day, but we used just about all of it. Go figure???

I have made this receipe twice (using trader joes pizza dough because I was short on time) and they were a big hit. The pear with pepper and the creamy goat cheese are a fabulous combo on a crispy pizza base. The mustard cream is delightful, but I agree with the other cooks who say that it makes way too much. Cut the mustard cream down to about 1/3 and you will still have leftovers. This is in the repetoire from now on.

This recipe was delicious and unique. The dough was very easy to make,and the combination of different flours gave it a very rustic, somewhat hearty texture and flavor. I was a little concerned with how sticky it was at first, but it turned out great and was very easy to handle. I didn't brush and sprinkle each slice of pear with the pepper, but just placed them on the flatbread and drizzled oil and sprinkled pepper over. Goat blue cheese is pretty hard to come by, so I substituted Blue D'Auvergne(basic cow's milk blue from France) and some goat gouda. The mustard cream was great as well! It did make a little too much, which I used on sandwiches the next day.

I wasn't wowed by this recipe. The flavors were just okay and I felt like there was a lot of waiting time considering this is just a flatbread. The mustard cream recipe makes about 10 times what you would actually need for 4 flatbreads and was not good enough to merit keeping around for a sandwich or something. Not bad, just not a keeper

These were outstanding - made them for 6 girlfriends as an appetizer and there wasn't a bite left. Watch the yeast in this recipe, however. I had to re-make the flatbreads using a full packet of the yeast, which is 1/4 ounce (not 1/4 teaspoon).
