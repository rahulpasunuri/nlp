Believe what all the other reviewers say. The chocolate gets hard so fast you can't mix it with the other ingredients. Don't make it.

argh, what a waste of 2 lbs of chocolate! i too wish i had read the reviews before trying this recipe. i tried twice to melt the chocolate and it seized both times. i have successfully melted chocolate before and have no idea why it seized both times. the butter quantity? i would not recommend this recipe to anyone.

This recipe made me feel like a complete idiot. I am a decent cook and should have paid attention to the other reviews - everything was going fine until the chocolate turned hard. We panicked - added more butter (didn't help), and eventually added milk to thin it out some. Now I have disgusting looking lumps of chocolate covered stuff that won't set up and hold together. SO frustrating.

I am known around the office as a good baker but I did not have good luck with this recipe at all. I made two separate batches and on both, the chocolate completely seized up, just like MissizSherman mentioned. I had to add several more tablespoons of butter to get it somewhat useable. I was very disappointed and will not make this recipe again.

I am known as a good baker around the office but I made two batches of these and both times, the chocolate seized up. It was very frustrating to make. I will look for another recipe similar to this one but will never make these again. The clumps I ended up with are edible but not up to my normal standards.

I made these with blanched slivered almonds, which I toasted, instead of peanuts, and would try them next time with mini pretzel sticks instead of the noodles to try to cut out the rather impressive amount of partially hydrogenated oils. Taste-wise, these are great. But -- did anyone else find their chocolate turned into a big hard ball instead of actually melting? I'm a fairly seasoned cook, and I didn't know what to make of this!

These could not be any easier. I will try them next time with milk chocolate chips. These would be great to make with children, too!

Just like my mom used to make for us when we were kids. I made 2 batches, 1 with nuts, 1 w/o. My mom used to substutute butterscotch morsels for chocolate ones, too. Yummy...

I make a recipe very similar to this one but use chocolate or butterscotch chips (or both), peanut butter, chow mein or rice noodles, and mini marshmallows. They are always a huge hit!

Big hit last night at a picnic, though they weren't quite so set-up as they'd be in cooler weather. I used an 11.5 oz. bag of 'double chocolate' chips and a 5 oz. can of chow mein noodles. Couldn't be easier to make, a favorite consideration of mine.

I remember my grandmother making these, then my mother, and I made them for my children and my daughter makes them for my grandchildren. It is such an easy recipe that my five year old grandson makes them, too. How old is this recipe?

I grew up on these. We called them "chocolate covered worms." Silly, but fun and delicious. Fine without the peanuts, too. Make a great ice cream topper, too.
