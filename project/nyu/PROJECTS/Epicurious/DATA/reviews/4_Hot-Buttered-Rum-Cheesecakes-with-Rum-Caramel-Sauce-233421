This is a GREAT idea for cheesecake. I made a number of changes, but was so glad to get my inspiration from this recipe. I used 1/2 the crust recipe, but the full cake recipe to bake in a 10" springform. I baked in a water bath for 1 hour 15 minutes, and the top was perfectly smooth and lovely, so I skipped the sour cream topping and just drizzled with the caramel sauce which is SO delicious. For the sauce, I used 1 cinnamon stick rather than grated. Will definitely make this again - especially at the holidays.

I am planning to make this as one cake and mathematically you should use 2/3 of the original recipe. I'll report back on how it works!

I made this as one large cheesecake, and it was really easy. To the cook from Portland, you could also try lining the pan with 2 or 3 layers of tin foil - I do that with all of my cheesecakes because I never want to clean butter out of the bottom of my oven again! The carmel rum sauce is also excellent, although it took me a while to get all of the undissolved clumps of cinnamon worked out.

Made these for Thanksgiving and they were so, so good. I altered the recipe a bit because I thought the 4 1/2 cheesecakes would be too big for one person. I bought a mini cheesecake pan (amazon.com) with removable bottoms and halved the recipe. It made about 18 mini cheesecakes. (Had some crust and sour cream topping left over.) These were a HUGE success and have a really wonderful flavor.

I halved the recipe and it worked for an 8 inch pie pan. I also made half cheese cream and half tofu--I do this with all cheesecake recipes. It turned out delicious and I think we can use the extra sauce over ice cream! Maybe next time, milk could be used in place of the whipping cream.

I also made these as gifts so haven't tasted them, but I must say there is way too much butter in the crust. Good thing I had them on a pan when I baked them as the butter all ran out of the pans and I had at least 1/2 cup of melted butter there. If I make them again I will use just half of the butter they say. Also, I made mine in pans that were a little bigger and ended up with 6 instead of 10 but still loved the idea of the cakes and sauce and the box presentation. Hope the people I gave them too will enjoy them.

Wow! This cheesecake is amazing. I made is as multiple gifts per the recipe and they turned out great. Very easy and oh so tasty! Glad to know that I can half it to make as a regular cheesecake because I really want to make this again! It was so creamy and moist and the rum flavor was excellent. All my receipients loved it! Only trouble i had was w/ the crust and it didn't want to stay together but I made it work. The gingersnap crust is the best!

I haven't actually been able to taste this recipe because I made them for gifts . . . but I must say . . .it was very easy and the presentation (with putting the mini cheesecakes in boxes and the sauce in beautful glass jars with corks) is stunning. Everything smells declicious, and I am sure it will taste just as good!

Divide the recipe in half and it should make one regular size cheesecake. I think the point of 10 springform pans is that you'll be giving them as gifts. Personally, I don't have the kitchen space for such an endeavor! I'll definitely try the recipe though - sounds yummy!

I'm going to try this cheesecake in a 10" springform pan and halve both the crust recipe and topping recipe. I'll report back on how it works!

This sounds wonderful, but how many people have ten 4 1/2 inch springforms? Could someone with more experience with cheesecakes than I suggest some alterations to make one large cheesecake?
