Based on other reviews and other strawberry sorbets I've made, I added 2 Tbls. balsamic vinegar and about 1 teaspoon of crushed black pepper. You taste the strawberry first, then the orange, and there is a black pepper finish. The balsamic vinegar adds to the complexity of the flavor. I think it would be very good without the added ingredients.

Excellent, intense flavor just like a sorbet should have.

So easy! Made it for a picnic (and it actually stayed frozen). Everyone loved it! Couldn't believe that I actually made it. Very enjoyable and very simple. Definitely recommend it.

Wow, served this one a few times now before the main. I added some balsamic and fresh ground black pepper to taste, gives it a tad more gourmet flare.mmmmmmmm

Certainly a recipe to keep in your recipe box !!! Made it for dessert after a rather firey Thai Green Curry & it was perfect for cooling off the guests. Don't be put out by all the whisking as it chills, if you are in the kitchen doing other things, just remember to make this first, then as you prepare the rest of the meal, you'll be around anyway. Nice not to have the egg white in a sorbet, and nice because you don't need an icecream maker !!! Try it, you'll love it !!!

Made this as a dessert for a BBQ last week and it was delicious! Perfect to have during the summer.

Made this with freshly-picked strawberries and it was incredible. My mom said it was the best sorbet she has ever tasted. The texture, however, was icier than i expected (i used an ice-cream maker).

This is a good dessert to serve that is light and very refreshing after a meal. I followed the suggestion of replacing 2 tablespoons of water with lemon juice. You do need to plan to be around to stir the mixture every 3 hours. The recipe says it keeps up to 3 days. I had made a double recipe and it kept well for 7 days.

I have made this sorbet for numerous brunches and it gets rave reviews, although I have made a few adjustments. Sometimes I substitute 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice for 2 tablespoons of water, and I put in a lemon peel in the sugar syrup. This cuts the sweetness of the sugar and the intensity of raspberries. Sometimes I put in a vanilla bean in the sugar syrup (when my husband does not throw it out by mistake!) I like not having to mess with an ice-cream maker. Great!

This sorbet is very light and perfect for a summer evening meal. The only thing I don't like is the timing, but you can leave it in the freezer after re-processing and then take out 30 minutes or so before serving. One substitution: I used lemon peel instead of orange (didn't have an orange on hand), and it was great... a substitution I'll probably make when I prepare this again.
