This is really an excellent salad and the hardest part is cooking the bacon. Any blue cheese on hand will work, as will pancetta or ham. I usually have gorgonzola on hand, instead of stilton, and it makes no diffenrence. As easy as it is to make, it is a real treat for a dinner party, because it is so unexpected. I make this all the time, when I can find fat, fresh endive.

This salad was great and easy to make. Didn't have endive so substituted romaine; also used bleu cheese instead of stilton. I would eliminate the parsley the next time I make this salad. This salad would make a main dish salad with the addition of chopped chicken, chopped cucumbers, chopped tomatoes, etc.

I would make this again but with other greens not just endive and more cheese and bacon.
