I do not believe the lamb chops pictured are a kosher cut. These chops do not resemble the shoulder lamb chops or "baby" lamb chops that are available at my kosher butcher. Since this recipe was under the Passover section, it would seem prudent to have the meat be kosher or at the very least, kosher cut & style.

OMG What a great recipe. Made this with just 2-1"thick chops and did not change anything else. Licked the plate and we could have gone through a 1/2 loaf of crusty bread for the remainder of the sauce. I read some of the reviews and scratch my head a little. We found no flavors over powering and they all complimented each other. Guess my palate is not sensitive enough. Plan to make this again soon. I would give this 5 forks!!

I made this exactly as the recipe said and found the sauce far too sweet for our taste.Also,the cardamom was overpowering.The sauce in Rack of Lamb with dried cherries and green peppercorn is much nicer.

Absolutely delicious!! We literally licked our fingers :) I had to substitute some ingredients due to availability, for example I used dry cranberries instead of cherries, red wine instead of port, and onion+garlic instead of shallots. All of the previous was due to availability. Pairing with the parsnip puree was absolutely perfect. I also complemented with a spinach salad. Definite keeper!!

Love, love, love this recipe! Quick and delicious. Probably would finish the meat in the oven but otherwise wonderful

We have tried this recipe twice once with lamb and once with duck breast. Loved it both time. First time we did the recipe exactly as written. The second time with some minor substitutions; increased the shallot to 1/2 cup and interchanged the cherry jam with blackberry jelly. The latter complemented the port nicely. Definitely a keeper.

I guess I have a different fork standard than most. To me, four forks is knock your socks off delish, serve it to company. Considering the cost of lamb and good Port nowadays, this was, at best, a decent meal for my wife and I on Sunday. I won't bother to try it again.

i thought this was a great dish. i made it with red wine instead of port and the red wine doesn't hold up as well to the cardamom so i would just cut the amount of cardamom a bit and it came out great.

Made this for the first time last night (never cooked lamb before) - it was delicious and easy to make. The sauce was very good, not too sweet - and the mint was a nice compliment to the sauce.

This dish was just wonderful and every easy to make. I will certainly make it again.

I always gripe about people who substitute for ingredients and complain about the results. In this one, I subbed a portofino, plum jam, and cloves. It was killer. We licked the plates. I can only dream of what it might be with the correct ingredients!

This is the kind of basic recipe that one can play with and substitute whatever is on hand. I didn't have dried sour cherries (I also think dried cranberries would work!) - but I do think the sour cherry jam and port are the key ingredients. Cardamom added a special flavor. No mint for us, thank you - I never understood the use of mint with lamb. When we lived in France our cousin would tease us "Americans who eat jam with their meat!" In this case, I agreed.

This is a wonderfully tasty and easy dish to prepare. I have adapted this to use with chicken or beef and it is still wonderful.

This recipe was awesome! I too added two tablespoons of butter to the sauce to make it creamier. It was fantastic! That is what I will serve at our next dinner party, the presentation was exquisite!

Very tasty and very simple! I recommend using 3/4 tsp cardamom and a bit of extra shallot. If you pack the cherries, 1/2 c is too many - be sure to only loosely pack.

Another keeper. What a combination of flavors. I am glad I didn't sprinkle mint when serving - it over powered the other flavors. I seared the chops on medium-high heat and then baked them at 475 degrees for 12 minutes. When the chops were done, the sauce was done. I saved the sauce to try tomorrow with chicken breasts.

I used 2 T mint jelly instead of the cherry jam and omitted the dry cherries. Used the thick lamb chops from Costco. Sprinkled fresh mint on top before serving. It was excellent and very easy.

My wife and I loved it. I couldn't get Tart cherries so I substituted it with dried Cranberries and it was still fantastic!

This was terrific. I don't love sweet sauces but this one is great. I added some garlic and would increase the acidity to cut some of the sweetness in the future. Everyone loved it however.

I love easy mouth watering recipes and this one is equally both! I would suggest a white basmati rice with this because the flavors almost have an Indian influence.

to keep my meat/fish warm while I cook my sauce, I cover it with foil and pop it in the oven. I preheat the oven to about 80C when I know I have to set aside the meat. Just becareful when removing your plate, WEAR OVEN GLOVES!!

This is an excellent way to enjoy lamb chops. Served with wild rice and steamed fresh green beans, it makes a delightful and sophisticated meal.

Absolutely delicious. Made side salad with dried cherries and pecans with a cherry balsamic vinaigrette. Used Big Paws cherry balsamic, too. Got lucky, because the wine had a note of cherry. I then made a huge batch of the sauce separately and froze it in small batches. We'll see how the sauce goes with other meats.

this recipe sounds DELICIOUS!! (i have not yet cooked it) However...i like my meat served hot. if you transfer the chop to a plate and THEN cook the sauce, the chop will be sitting; getting cold. I, personally, would suggest starting the sauce as the meat is cooking, so the chop does not get cold. having the ingredients for the sauce already prepped will save you a lot of time(you can even do it the night before or the day of. simply prep evrything and place in seperate containers. refrigerate and cover the premeasured ingretrients that should be covered and have the others ready on the counter. it's all about timing! (and a nice, hot, chop! :)

The best recipe I have ever used from Epi! The blend of flavors was divine--the mint is a must with the tart cherries. My husband raved about this simple but elegant recipe for a week. This will also make a marvelous dish for a small dinner party.

I love lamb chops, especially tender loin chops. This recipe seemed to be designed to mask the taste of good lamb rather than enhance it with a collection of ingredients not usually found in the usual kitchen. I followed it exactly and then discarded the recipe. Perhaps this heavy sauce would be far better with a leg of lamb or perhaps roast duck.

Rating: 4
This was really, really good. I made it with pork tenderloin, that I browned and then finished in the oven before proceeding with the sauce. A definite "do-again" in our house.

really good, the flavor combos are right on. My only complaint: I had thick chops, and they were so rare, my instincts told me better but as I am often accused of over cooking meat i followed the recipe. next time i will buy smaller chops or finish them off in the oven.

This recipe makes me wish it was kosher to use swear words on this site...it was that good. Both my fiancee and I thought it was tremendous, something we would have been happy paying $30+ for at a restaurant. I paired it up with a curry rice that complemented it perfectly. Next time, I'll make it just as described except possibly even triple the sauce, it was so amazingly good with the curry rice that I wish I had more!

I made this recipe with two racks of lamb which I browned in a sauté pan before finishing them off in a 400º oven. I doubled the sauce ingredients and used the sauté pan I browned the racks in. I cut the racks into double chops after they rested. My guests could not stop exclaiming how delicious this dish was.

I agree this was a wonderful Easter dinner for two. I followed the recipe almost exactly but was surprised to find myself with no cardamom at the last minute and substituted some allspice and cinnamon. I used top quality (Bonne Maman) cherry jam and port so I think it worked OK. We couldn't let any of the leftover sauce go to waste and since it was just the two of us mopped it up with bread!

This was very good but not spectacular. I couldn't find lamb chops that big and I thought it was a little too sweet.

This was amazingly good, and simple to prepare. I used a nice Cabernet (which we also drank with dinner) b/c we did not have any Port and it was delicious just the same. The sauce is heavenly; thick, rich, velvety and delicious. I would definitely prepare this again.

I agree - this is a wonderful, easy and elegant dish. I doubled the sauce since I made it for 6 guests and we reduced it in about 10 minutes. Don't forget the mint!

wow!! so good, so fast, perfect meal!! i can't imagine any other garnish other than the mint. forget the parsley. go for the mint. had to add a bit of wondra (sauce thickener) for the right consistency. but wow! what a meal!

This was excellent. It had all the appearances of being fancy and gourmet, but was surprisingly easy. The cardamom offsets the sweetness of the cherries in a wonderful way. Definitely will make again.

Incredibly delicious, this was the perfect Easter dinner for two. The sauce is extraordinarily flavorful. I loved the zip of the balsamic vinegar, the sweetness of the jam, and the lingering tastes of mint and cardamom. This one is a keeper. I can't wait to try it with pork (as another reviewer suggested) or even to baste a capon on the grill this summer.

This one is a keeper! Easy and elegant with a wonderful rich fruity sauce. I cracked open cardamon pods and and crushed the seeds. Great taste.

Received rave reviews for minimal effort. I couldn't find cherry jam, and used preserves instead. I added 2 TB. butter to richen the sauce, and let it reduce about 15 min. So easy and so good. I saved the extra sauce, this would work great with pork, and you can easily tweak by using cranberries, currants, beef broth for meat, etc. I will definitely make again!

This is one of those super easy recipes that will wow your guests. I ran out of time and sped up the cooking of the sauce and, while I can see why it would have been even better if the sauce had cooked longer, it was still exceptional. The fresh mint is key, with the cardamom it gives that extra mysterious flavor. I served it with soft polenta with mascarpone, a perfect match.
