also I forgot to mention, which cake flour brand is the best, because I usually use all purpose flour. Also the cake flour brand should be easy for me to find in California. Thanks!

I am planning to make this one of the flavors for a baby shower cake. But I first want to make a small sample batch. Can anyone tell me the conversion changes to the recipe to make a small cake?

previous review is supposed to say "2/3 inches" from top re. how much batter in pans

Made for friend's wedding the month that Bon Appetit published this in 99. Made again this month as a *surprise* for her 10th anniversary! Subbed white choc in cake. FAR BETTER than semisweet unless you're a chocoholic. Batter: fill pans to about 2/3 from top. Doesnt rise as much as other cakes. Cake flour: weighs 3.7oz / cup Use preserves vs jam as recipe says (jam soaks into cake more) Icing: needs lots time to come to room temp (worked to soften in microwave on low) Cutting cake into layers: still dont know best way, but it didnt matter that much that they were crooked bc of thick fillings w/ uneven raspberries Set timer less than expected& over baking dries out cake!!! Definitely line pans w/ wax paper; spray even wax paper or choc will stick to pan. Fondant: can roll out in advance if its breaking when rolling out, it will definitely tear when placed on cake  should be soft like playdo Keep flipping and rotating when rolling out Rolling: dont do single strokes, but quick back and forth

I made this for a friends wedding in June '08, with a trial run before. I needed to serve more than 50, so doubled the recipe. This posed some logistical issues with pan selection, but learned a lot in the process. Using 3" pans with the larger diameters requires a special "ring" that you insert in the center to insure the middle of the cake bakes. I only made one layer in each tier (to help preserve my sanity!) and used strawberry, as the groom doesn't like raspberry. The white chocolate icing was quite a challenge. I found the cream cheese seized caused the white chocolate to sieze unless I kept it out overnight; personally, I thought this icing was delish, but several wedding guests disagreed! I also made and frosted the tiers about a week ahead of time and rolled out the fondant and decorated the day of. For a novice baker, it really turned out nicely.

This was a lot of fun to make, it took two of us, one to run the mixer and one to add the ingredients. It did turn out crumbly though, I think the chocolate bits made it hard to cut smoothly. Also, the white chocolate for the frosting becomes hard at room temperature, not soft enough to mix. We ended up with white chocolate chunk frosting which tasted good but the texture was lumpy.

Got rave reviews. Few tips: Make sure chocolate pieces are very small or it will sink to the bottom. Even chocolate chips,which I used, need to be cut up a bit. Unless you have bigger than the standard 2" pans, its hard to cut into three layers so I just cut into two and about halfed the filling recipe. Also I skipped the fondant and just added powdered sugar to the frosting to give it more stability. Didn't have fresh raspberries so used frozen, about 2 12oz bags will do. Not a crumb was left!

I made the cake for a friends wedding and it was a huge hit. I have made it several time, both full cakes and cupcakes. I altered the recipe a little bit, using pureed raspberries in place of the jam. It adds a nice tart contract to the richer frosting. I also strain the puree to remove the seeds.

I forgot to mention that I did not use fondant. I just don't care for the taste. However, after you frost the cake, let the frosting set up in the refrigerator for a few hours, it will then be easy to smooth out any bumps, etc. with a warm spatula. My frosting was so smooth, many thought it was fondant.

Rating: 4
I highly recommend this cake with the following notes...1)Make this cake in winter or for cool indoor room 2)Chop bittersweet chocolate into small pieces. If too large, they will sink to bottom of baking pan. 3)Keep cake in fridge until needed as frosting gets soft quickly-even at room temperature 4)Be sure that the white chocolate is thoroughly melted and don't let it cool down too long as it will leave "flakes" in your frosting. I never received so many Ooohs and Ahhs over a cake. It was beautiful and delicious. I will definitely make it again.

I made this cake for friends marriage vow renewal ceremony on their 25th anniversary and the friends and guests all raved about it. I cut the chocolate for the cake batter more finely than the recipe calls for, so that the chocolate was in small bits instead of larger chunks. The cake part is incredible, sort of like a sophisticated chocolate chip cookie cake. I made only 1/3 of the frosting in deference to the age and heart conditions of the guests. I omitted the fondant because it seemed like way too much work. Instead of dividing each of the 3 tiers/cakes into three parts and spreading raspberry preserves AND frosting on each of the thirds as the recipe calls for, I cut each tier/cake in half and spread raspberry preserves (thickly) in the middle of each tier, put the halves back together and refrigerated until ready to assemble the cake. I also refrigerated the frosting after I made it. Shortly before the ceremony, I assembled the three tiers, frosted and decorated the cake with roses from my garden. The resulting cake, with alternating layers of raspberry filling and frosting, was beautiful and by far the best cake I have ever eaten, and everybody else thought so, too. The directions are excellent and the suggestions of reviewers were invaluable.

I am trying to see if I can make my own wedding cake and this is the first recipe I have tried and it is sensational. It is very moist and instead of raspberries I used strawberries and it was great. I can't praise this cake enough. Loved it and would definately make it again. Just a bit less chocolate chunks next time though.

I recently made this cake as a practice run for a wedding. The cake tasted good but it was very crumbly. I had a hard time serving the cake without it falling apart. Does anyone know what I might have done wrong ?

I made this cake for my "picnic in the park" wedding. The cake is ok, but the frosting is amazing. I made a few changes, like leaving out the chocolate chunks (my mom doesn't like them) and substituting strawberries for raspberries. I put fondant, which tastes better with a little vanilla extract, on the layer cake. Then, to save time, I made three dozen cupcakes and topped them with the leftover frosting. People haven't stopped requesting them!

PLEASE LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES! First, use UNsalted butter in the frosting. (I know, I know...) Second, if the white chocolate cools to the point where it's firm and not fluid anymore, RE-MELT it! I added a small amount that was firm and instead of incorporating, it cooled even more when it hit the frosting mix and became little tiny flecks of white chocolate. An unpleasant texture in the frosting. I don't like so much butter in my frostings, even buttercream frostings. I won't make the frosting again, but the cake was a very nice texture and flavor.

I made this at Christmas as test run for my daughter's wedding this April. The layers were a bit on the dense and skinny side, but it was a hit. I used some of the left over fondant to make some roses, one petal at a time. Really not that hard if you just have a real rose in front of you and take your time. Any tips on getting a higher and slightly lighter texture would be appreciated. Cheers.

I've made this as a 9" layer cake, with the frosting (not the fondant) and it turned out well. The four fork rating is for the white chocolate buttercream. It tasted wonderful, and was really easy to work with.

You MUST try this cake! After reading all the reviews I made the cake (cutting the recipe in half) for a wedding shower a few days ago. People couldn't stop eating the cake. I even took left overs to another party afterwards and everyone there raved as well. My boyfriend keeps sneaking into the refrigerator to eat it and he doesn't even like sweets that much. I made a smaller, 3-tier cake...no fondant since I didn't have time and although it looks beautiful it doesn't taste great. I bought extra raspberries and put them around the edges of each layer and on top. I also left the frosting white. I'd make the cake a day before (just don't frost the outside of it until right before you want to serve it) because the flavors mesh better after a day. Tip: If you only use half the recipe, you'll still need 2 jars of raspberry preserves. I only made a 1/3 of the frosting and still had a lot left over. This is probably the best cake I've ever made, hands down.

I made a double recipe of this cake for my sister's wedding. Absolutely amazing. Rave reviews from all (even the men, who usually prefer non-chocolate). I made a tiered version rather than stacked, and it supported itself admirably. I only used 1.25 recipes worth of frosting (although I did coat with fondant). This frosting is exceptionally soft, and will melt if in a car with no AC... however I decorated the entire cake when it was 100 degrees, and once the fondant was on it was fine. Soft to the touch, but the fondant prevented the base layer from melting off the cake. I would (and did) serve the raspberry filling on the side if you are going to set the cake up outdoors or in a hot room.

I had never made such a complicated recipe and decided to go all out by making this for a birthday cake. I followed all the directions but changed the sizes of the layers to 11", 8", and 5" inch layers. The cake batter was delicious and made a great cake. I really liked the frosting also. However, I didn't read the directions at the end where it said to frost the entire cake and then apply the fondant. So my cake came out looking a little funny, but was delicious and got rave reviews from everyone who ate it. And yes, I do think this cake serves 50, I had tons left over. I would definitely reccomend this recipe if you're up for a time consuming but fun challenge that is worth the result.

I made this cake for a house blessing of our new home. The guests raved! It was beautiful and easy with such great, detailed instructions. I followed the recipe as written except I used wooden skewers pushed all the way through all tiers for stability and I did not use fondant. It was not missed. I will make this again sometime, maybe cutting the recipe in half. Don't be intimidated. This was my first attempt at a project this large and it went fine. If you would like to see a picture of my cake, please email me.

I made the 12" tier of this cake for a party that I had and everyone raved. The tier can be made by halving the recipe. To any one who has made this cake in it's entirety, does it really only feed 50 people?

The "cake" in this recipe is fantastic and different from typical cakes! I did use other reviewers tips, including sifting three times.

I made this cake in 1999 for a friends wedding and for my own wedding the next year. This past year I made it again for the same friends baby shower. Those guests who had attended the wedding in 1999 recognized the cake immediately and rushed to get another piece. I think remembering something you ate 3 years ago is a real testament to this recipe. I agree, that the fondant is more for show than taste. The trick I used for my own wedding was to only make the top tier (the one that was cut for pictures) out of real cake and covered all tiers (both cake and styrofoam)with fondant. I made other cakes using only the cream cheese icing. The cakes without the fondant were the ones that were given to the kitchen staff for cutting and serving to guests.

I'm surprised to see all the rave reviews. I made this cake and found it to be absolutely dry and horrible tasting. Even my husband had to admit it was a flop. I'm usually a scratch baker, but I used mixes and they were incredibly moist and everybody loved them. The frosting is tasty for sure but the fondant is for looks ONLY (yuck)!

Made this excellent cake for my brother-in-law's wedding. The falling cake story worried me a bit, so I used a meringue buttercream under the fondant. F.Y.I. The Cake Bible has a great fondant recipe for those who want to make their own. The fondant does stand up to travelling (which I did with this cake in August - 3 hrs in the trunk of my car!) I brushed the cake with simple syrup, and it was incredibly moist and delicious. Try serving with raspberry puree and/or chocolate sauce.

This cake was THE best cake I have ever eaten! I am making this cake for my sister's wedding and of course I did a test run first. I took the cake to work and everyone DEVOURED every crumb of it! The only change I would make is to add a layer of ganache to the preserves, raspberries and frosting between the layers. We felt it needed more chocolate and, rather than add more chocolate chunks to the cake, we decided on the ganache--more bang for the buck! We also used the frosting on the entire cake instead of using the fondant. The fondant is simply not good enough for this luscious creation. Kudos!!!

I made a much-enlarged variation of this cake for my own wedding, which I also covered with fondant and decorated per a photo that my wife found in a "Martha Stewart Weddings" magazine. My cake served 150, so I made this recipe twice over, along with another multiplied cake recipe to produce 4 tiers (14,12,9,6). Also, I used sliced strawberries instead of raspberries, I just like them better and it is June. I had to freeze the cakes for one week, and I think that dried them a bit, but the unfrozen test cake was moist and delicious. I think that this frosting recipe is very servicable, but it was too cream-cheesy for me, so I used swiss meringue buttercream instead after trying the cream cheese on the test cake. It's all about making the cakes level! If you can't do that, keep practicing until you can, or get a separator plate set. This cake held superbly for over one day at room temperature.

I made this cake for my grandmother's 90th birthday party, and it was a hit! The cake was delicious, but to me, I felt with the choclate chunks and crunch of the fresh raspberry seeds, there was a little bit more texture than desirable. As for the fondant, I am not very fond of the flavor of it, so I made an icing from cream, powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla tinted to a shade of rose pink. It was easier than I thought it would be to imitate the smoothness of the fondant by icing it smoothly, chilling it, and going over it with a hot knife. I was not as successful as I would have liked to be with the "dots"--I should have lightly dotted the surface with a toothpick to determine where each dot would go for better symmetry. This recipe is a winner, though!

I made this for my sis'25th wedding anniversary and it was a HUGE hit. I agree and concur completely with the person who said to refrigerate then assemble right before the function. It was 80 degrees and the cake was sliding around. We had to take it apart, refrigerate and reassemble. However, all that said, it was so delicious that I'm making a scaled down version for my friend's 40th birthday.

Follow the directions very carefully. I did not put the straws in the top layer and it fell--yes fell. The fondant liquified (southern humidity) and the top layer slipped off. I added many flowers to the remaining layers and it looked ok. The cake and filing are very good. I suggest cutting the chocolate smaller than 1/4 for batter. I also recommend not assembling until 2-3 hours prior to the event. I think everyone was impressed that I even tried to make the cake.

This cake tastes great! Rather than adding the chocolate to the batter, I grated it and sprinkled it on between the preserves and the real raspberries. What a hit. However, I found the cake aprt difficult as it didn't rise enough for 3 layers to be cut. The fondant was hard to work with, but I topped it with fresh tulips and it was beautiful.

I made this cake for a friend's birthday. He proclaimed that it was the best cake he had ever eaten, and the rest of the guests agreed. The cake itself has a wonderfully tender, light texture and a delicate crumb, but manages to hold its own against the heavy cream cheese frosting (which is not overly sweet) and tart raspberries and jam. I chose to leave out the fondant, which I find cloyingly sweet; instead, I finished the cake using a knife dipped in hot water (and wiped dry) to spread the frosting as smooth as glass. A ring of raspberries that had been dipped individually in melted raspberry jam encircled the the edge of the cake--the result was a simple yet elegant cake.

Delicious and beautiful cake. I made one third of the recipe, which was the perfect size for a nine inch birthday cake. Even after dividing the recipe by three, I only made half the frosting and that was enough. To save having to slice through the cake, bake in three separate nine-inch round pans for 40 minutes. The cake tastes best served cold so keep refrigerated until serving.

I am 16 years old and I completed this recipie very well. The taste was amazing and it was beautiful. The only problem was that there was so much frosting, I am making a second for another wedding. I had no trouble cutting the three layers with a 12 inch knife.

I made this cake for my good friend's graduation party and everybody loved it! It was so rich and the flavors really compliment each other. I skipped decorating the cake with the frosting and decorated around the bottom of the three layers with fresh roses in a variety of colors. I would definitely make this again!

I am a professional cake decorator and found this cake excellent. Tip use cake dowels or 1\4 in wood ones cut to length. Another tip you can bake the cake in contour pans (also found at craft stores) this pan is for doing fondent type cakes. The edges are curved so the fondent goes on smooth. once again great cake.

The guests unanimously rated this cake as the best they had ever tasted, and I agree. It was so spectacular to look at that we replaced the floral centrepiece on the grand piano with the cake! It was a challenge to cut the layers into 3 slices, and, if you're not up to the task of cutting a 1 1/2-inch high, 12-inch wide cake (with chocolate lumps) into 1/2 inch slices, I recommend the special layer-cutting tool that you can find at specialty stores. The three layers is worth the trouble! Also, it is hard to believe that the cake will absorb so much raspberry preserve and raspberries without disintegrating, but it does, and they really complement the chocolate and balance the richness of the truly-delicious frosting. Lastly, buy large sheets of parchment to roll out the fondant, and leave the fondant on the parchment to roll up on a rolling pin and drape over the cake, then pull off the parchment. Makes a smooth surface, and saves having the fondant stick to itself on the rolling pin.

Exceptional cake and frosting--without the fondant! We decorated it with sugared daisies and pansies from the garden. The wedding guests raved about it and many have asked for recipe. The cake did not raise high enough to cut three layers easily, even with an added egg white. There seemed to be much too much frosting, even for three layers. But it was very special and we will make it again for smaller numbers.

Was a great hit at my bridal shower. One hint I got from a friend turned out to be a great help. Some people do not care for the fondant, so to cater to their tastes we first frosted the cake with a butter cream frosting and then covered with the fondant. That way theu could eat around the fondant. Was great!

My friend made this cake for my wedding 11 days ago. She worked on it all week before the wedding and it turned out excellent!!! She had made a "practice" cake about a year ago by halving the recipe and that turned out good, but the full recipe was beyond compare. It will probably serve more than 50 as it is very very rich! I would definitely recommend this cake, my friend had never had any wedding cake experience and even had people ask for her card at the wedding. My caterer commented that it was the best cake she has had. Great job Erin!!!

The cakes came out to thin to be cut into three layers. So I just cut the cake into two layers. I would appreciate comments from other cooks on what could have caused. I must say that instead of weighing the flour and measuring by the pound, I converted I pound of cake flour for 4.5 cups of cake flour. Is that conversion accurate? Also the cake did not come out with a flat top but there was no mention in the recipe about levelling the cake. I will like to make it again and answers to the above questions will definitely be appreciated.

I made this cake for a wedding shower in July and people are still telling me what a fabulous cake it was! Even guests who are not usually big cake eaters were having seconds!

The fondant was alittle hard to work with for my first time, but the cake was delicious. There was much too much of the cream cheese/white chocolate cream ( I used the leftovers to make white chocolate cheesecake ). Unfortunately, fresh raspberries were unavailable and I used frozen. I should have thawed and dried them better. Overall, the cake tasted great and looked great. I made it for my daughters first birthday and it was a great hit with the many guests. And this cake goes well with champagne.

The cake was excellent! I am a fresh pasta manufacturer so the fondant was not as much a problem to work with as I had expected. The one major note I would pass along is to keep it cold up to the point of presentation. The frosting was so soft at room temp. that the whole cake slumped even with the straws in side. Everybody at party enjoyed it.

I made this cake for our son's wedding, decorated it with silk flowers and it was a big hit. Our son's father-in-law ate 2 pieces and doesn't like cake. The fondant was a challenge as this was the first time I used it. The combination of flavors is wonderful.

I made this cake for a wedding shower on June 5. I called the bakery in Santa Rosa to chat with the chef. I wanted to make the cake without the fondant covering. I got great advice from Debby, the sister of the pastry chef who designed the recipe. The preparation was straight forward, relatively easy and came out perfect. I added the step of sifting the flour and dry ingredients three times...a tip I picked up from another source. The taste was sensational. The combination of flavors with the raspberries and white chocolate buttercream was incredible. Everyone raved. I would comment that the buttercream was a little difficult to work with, since I had to pipe it; it had a tendancy to melt when exposed to your hand heat. Also, the buttercream recipe makes almost twice as much as you need for the entire cake. I will make it again for the "back up" wedding cake I am doing this week but I will use 1/2 recipe of buttercream. Also I used Williams Sonoma's "Raspberry Ecstasy" instead of preserves. I will do this one again for sure.

A bit difficult for the first timer, but WELL WORTH IT!! The frosting was the BIGGEST HIT...people couldn't get enough! The fondant made the cake look beautiful, however, it was a challenge to work with. I have truly learned a lot with this recipe.....and look forward to the next time! ENJOY!
