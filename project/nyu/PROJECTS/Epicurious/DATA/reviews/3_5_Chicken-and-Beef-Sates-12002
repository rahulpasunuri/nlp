This was easy and delish! Also sub'd coconut milk for heavy cream, used all chicken and served with spicy peanut sauce. Would be great over salad or use leftovers (if there are any!) in a chicken salad!

I lived in Malaysia for 6 years where sate (or satay) is practically the national dish. This recipe is more like the sate you find there than any other I have found. Our whole family loves it!

I made a few changes to recipe by adding pineapple and peach slice to the skewer. Otherwise it was great .Thanks Boo Boo

I agree with earlier reviewers who thought this was bland. For all of the spices in the marinade, we felt this recipe lacked flavor. I won't make it again.

Awesome....this is the recipe I've been looking for!!! ( with a couple of changes). I used all chicken in about 2" length (bite size). Before putting the chicken on the skewer, I put on a pineapple chunk then a trimmed "Prik Ty" (Thai hot pepper). They are very hot, but when eaten together, the taste of curry chicken, the sweetness of the pineapple and the spicy pepper blend perfectly. If you do not like spicy food, omit the pepper or you'll be sorry!. If you like spicy food, make it now!!. If you've ever been to Thailand and have eaten "Thai BBQ" from a street vendor.....you'll experience a million dollars worth of memories at the cost of about $10

The individual that was disappointed must have done something wrong. I had this as a main dish served with chicken rice and our group of 6 thought it was excellent. I marinated it in the refrigerator longer than called for. Good recipe.

I made this dish for a cocktail party and was quite disappointed. Beware of a marinade that doesn't contain any type of acid. Without it, the flavor really doesn't penetrate the meat. I think the same results could have been achieved by coating the beef and chicken with a can of prepared curry sauce.

"Addictive" is the word my guests used most to describe this recipe. A huge hit! I used 6-7 pounds chicken breast, cut into bite size pieces and skewered on toothpicks, for an appetizer party. Substituted 14oz can coconut milk for the cream, used 1 large onion, and multiplied all spices by 3. Served with a spicy peanut sauce. (I like to always use natural peanut butter in my peanut sauce... gives a much better flavor!) I will be making this over and over again.

Yummy! I marinated it overnight...A little secret ( if the beef is a little tough marinate over night in papaya leaves) well that is for those of us who have access to them!! It somehow tenderizes the meat!! Enjoy!

I highly recommend this recipe (although I only used it on chicken). It came out very very tasty for only a short time for marinating. It was unfortunate, however, to discard such a great tasting marinade (I quadrupled the recipe so there really was quite a bit of it to toss). The only change I made was to add some hot curry paste to the marinade which gave it a little bit of heat.

A very easy dish to prepare and I didn't have to wait long for the meat to marinade in order to get the flavor. The marinade does not look appealing at first or even while the meat was cooking, but don't be fooled -- the outcome was delicious. I made the peanut sauce from another Gourmet's Sate recipe and added steamed white rice. A very nice dinner for 2.
