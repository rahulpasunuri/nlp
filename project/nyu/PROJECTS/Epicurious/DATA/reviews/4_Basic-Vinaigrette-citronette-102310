After I learned the basic proportions for this vinaigrette I began to substitute fresh lemon juice for the vinagar and added about a teaspoon of dijon mustard, now it's my favorite.

This is a extrmely versitile addition to any fresh salad.. For a little added twist I have added the juice of fresh garlic cloves crushed.. Just enough to enhance the taste but not to much to ruin the simplicity... have a wonderful healthy day...
