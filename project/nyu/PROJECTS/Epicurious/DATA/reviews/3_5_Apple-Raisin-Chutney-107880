OMG this is possibly the WORST thing I have ever made. What a waste of time and money. I was so excited to try it, but the vinegar is so over powering, the sauce didn't thicken, and I would never, ever serve this. Thank God I made it in advance of Christmas Eve dinner. It's going in the trash!

I made this again last night with a few tweaks and it was fantastic. I used 5 large granny smith apples, 3/4 cup dried cranberries, 1/4 cup orange cranberries, 1 cup Spectrum organic apple cider vinegar, 1/4 cup white balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup Spectrum organic brown rice vinegar. I mixed 1 cup sugar with the vinegar heated till dissolved, brought to a boil and added 1/2 cup Splenda. It then cooked for about 30 minutes and reduced to 1 cup, I added another couple of TBS. each of the balsamic and brown rice vinegar to bring it up to 1 1/2 cups. I then added the other ingredients changing the pepper to 1 tsp. hunan red chili sauce. It was outstanding. It did not taste as good while it was still warm, but so good once it had been chilled for a few hours. I brought it to room temp before serving. A great complement to the pork and the corn.

I did not have Granny Smith apples or raisins so I used an assorted mixture of apples (Empire, Macs, Romes, etc.) and dried cranberries. Since those apples are sweeter than Grannys, I used less sugar but kept the same ratio of vinegar - 1 1/2 c. sugar and 1 1/2 c. vinegar. Did not have apple cider vinegar & substituted w/ a mixture of white balsamic and rice vinegars with excellent results - will use the same ingredients next time too because this came out absolutely perfect - everyone raved! I have to admit I was a little leery of putting the pepper flakes in an applesauce type dish but it gave it just the right spicy kick and was wonderful with the pork roast.

I had some problems making this, but in the end it was wonderful, tangy and sweet. I tried subbing 1 cup of Splenda for the sugar and it never thickened. It did reduce, so I ended up adding more vinegar and 1/4 cup of sugar and still could not get it to thicken. I gave up and added the fruit (I used apples and dried cranberries). I also did not have enough granny smiths so I added a Gala. Despite the fact that the vinegar had reduced to 1 cup without thickening, the final result was great. Sweet first with a tart kick at the end. Perfect with the pork and the corn. I will make it again, using some sugar with the vinegar at first and then the Splenda.

This was wonderful! Very easy and flavorful, with a nice kick from the pepper. I might add chopped crystallized ginger next time, as the ginger flavor pretty much got lost. It would go well with chicken, also. A definite keeper.

I don't like to use all the sugar. I used less and it was still to much. Next time I will use splenda to taste. No sugar. A little light corn syrup to thicken. I added other fruit such as flavored cranberries, grapes, peaches, and an onion. When it cooks the natural juices of the fruit make it sweet. Also added cranberry liquor and onion powder. It went well with the pork.

This is wonderful served with pork. I made this 3 days before serving, so that I'd have one less dish to make on Easter. Great taste. I will cut down on the sugar a bit next time and cook for 15-20 minutes longer.

I cut this recipe in half, for just two of us, and it turned out very well. Served it with a pork loin, and my husband loved it. I did add more red pepper flakes than called for,and the leftovers really felt the heat more. It's a great little relish to serve with any type of pork, easy to make and very tasty!

The adults I've served this to enjoyed it very much, but it is a bit spicy for most kids. Since the grownups like the amount of heat, I've learned to offer applesauce for young diners as an easy alternative. We like this very much with pork tenderloin and creamed corn, but I don't always make the mint marinade for the pork. Thyme, salt, pepper, mustard, and oil works well and doesn't require fresh herbs in winter. The corn is ok but Jim Copes frozen creamy corn is just as good and EASY!

I agree, too sweet even though I cut 1/2 cup of sugar to begin with. I also used chunks of fresh ginger and cayenne pepper instead of flakes. To rescue it, I poured off the syrup, added 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice and boiled the syrup down again, then put it back. Has a little kick. Next time I will use only half the sugar and add the lemon juice into begin with.

We really like the taste of the chutney and always make it with a pork temderloin

Mmmmmmmmmmmm! So easy and so delicious. We served this with pork tenderloin. Didn't do anything fancy to the tenderloin--just loaded it up with good, old fashioned salt and pepper--and then used the chutney to give it some delicious zing. Was worried that the crushed red pepper would make it too hot, but it gave it just the right tang. Loved this and will definitely make it again.

The chutney is way too sweet. I would cut the sugar at least in half.

This was absolutely delicious. Very easy to make and would be wonderful with any type of meat, not just the pork. The combination of the pork, creamed corn and chutney were sensational.
