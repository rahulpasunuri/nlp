This was good but bland as written. The addition of cumin made this a tasty snack.

I love this dip with a few small changes. I eat it often for lunch with veges. It's low fat, low sodium, and has a lot of flavor. I use a 28oz can of whole peeled tomatoes packed in juice. I reserve the juice and oven roast the tomatoes. I blend all the roasted tomatoes with the other ingredients plus a pinch of cayenne, and a bit more garlic, vinegar and juice.

This was okay, not great. Used it with chips, not veggies.

I thought this dip was too thick for vegetables. It doesn't cling to food like a mayonnaise dip does. I think I will try the "dip" spread on toasted french bread drizzled with rosemary olive oil.
