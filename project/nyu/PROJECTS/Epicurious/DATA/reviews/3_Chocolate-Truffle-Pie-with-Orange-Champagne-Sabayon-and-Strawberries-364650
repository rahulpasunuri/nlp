I could not disagree more with the reviewer from Atlanta. This dessert does not taste of the vanilla extract, and is a perfect dessert for Passover. I'm always on the lookout for new things for Pesach, and this is a winner. The pie is very dense, so a small serving is desired. As comfortable as I am with making sabayons, I went a little crazy and made a strawberry foam with my cream whipper to accompany the pie. Each plate got a sliced, unsweetened strawberry, plus a squirt of the foam. Made for a very elegant presentation.

This recipe caught my eye because it sounded so yummy. But it was a let down. I will admit that I used flour instead of matzo cake meal because they didnt have this at my grocery store. I am not sure what would have been different had I used matzo cake meal. But the "pie" turned out tasting exactly like brownies. Think about eating brownies with strawberries and champagne...it didn't compliment each other at all. I called my grandmother, who spent her entire life as a gourmet pastry and dessert chef, she read the ingredients once over and said that the ingredient list seemed very unbalanced. Also, with one tablespoon of vanilla extract, you could taste it when eating the cake. not good at all. Made for great brownies tho (if you can get past the vanilla extract flavor).

Excellent! More a cake than a pie. Replace matzo cake meal by regular flour (used a scant 1/4 cup). Delicious with strawberries and the sabayon. This is a keeper.

Fairly easy to make. Very rich, very delicious, worth the time and effort.
