My husband, who is no fan of vegetables, turned to me as he finished his bowl of chili and said "Wow! This chili was actually great." Per previous reviewers' suggestions, I increased the chili powder to 3 tablespoons and the cumin to 1 tablespoon. I also simmered the chili for about 40 minutes after adding the squash to allow it to thicken. Delicious.

Very nice, very simple, very quick. Even my boyfriend, who doesn't like chard OR squash, ate it and enjoyed it. Definitely a keeper. I didn't change much, slightly different proportions since I was just cooking for two.

I've made this many times for potlucks and quick lunches. I substitute chicken broth for the veg. broth, sauté jalapeno with onions and garlic, and add 1/2 cup fresh squeezed orange juice, which I add to all my chili recipes - yum!

One of our favorite family recipes. Easy and delicious. I've made it again and again. The toppings of cilantro, red onions, and cheese look so pretty at the end!

Really good and, aside from a lot of chopping/dicing, very simple. Perfect for a cool, fall night. I used kale, as my supermarket didn't have chard and, per the suggestion of a few reviewers, added a pinch or so of cinnamon.

Rating: 4
I'm not usually the type to change a recipe and then review the original but my choice of greens offered at my supermarket was mustard or brussels sprouts! I opted for the brussles sprouts and sliced them very thin. The recipe was delicious. My only critique is this is a recipe that's best served right away. If you hold it or reheat it the pretty, contrasting colors of the beans, squash and greens all kind of meld together like some gray sludge--still tasty, though!

Accidentally omitted the cumin, added a pinch of cinnamon and subbed spinach for the chard - delicious.

I changed a few things: i used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth; used fire roasted tomatoes instead of regular diced; added cinnamon; added a roasted poblano pepper; added a dash or two of cayenne; added salt. And then I simmered it for about 45 mins to an hour before adding the swiss chard. It was excellent!

Rating: 2
I liked this and thought it was good, but like other reviewers I felt it needed a bit of help. I'm not a vegetarian, so I substituted the veg broth for low sodium chicken broth to get some richness. I also upped the chili power to 3 tbsp and cumin to 3 tsp. It still needed some umph, so I added about an 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes. The other change is to cook it longer prior to adding the chard. The dish just isn't rich enough otherwise -- I had to simmer it for about an hour covered before I got the rich consistency I was looking for. Also, I used no salt added black beans and diced tomato to give me a bit of control over the sodium content. I used 3 tbsp of soy sauce which added some flavor depth and gave the chili a darker color, which was nice.

I rarely rate these recipes but felt the need to on this one. It's absolutely fantastic. Perfect use of my butternut squash and swiss chard. I used chicken stock instead of vegetable and I also used more of it (about 32 oz.) I also added a serrano chili to the sautee of onions. I added a hint of cinnamon and some red pepper chili flakes at the end. In order to make it a bit thicker and more robust i simmered it for about 35 min before adding the chard. Wow, we LOVED it! This recipe is a keeper for sure!

Delicious and easy! My husband and 3 school-age boys have second helpings. It's so dense that they don't even miss the ground meat of a regular chili. Making it for the 3rd time tonight. I might add some minced jalapeno to bring up the heat-it is a mild dish.

Rating: 4
This was much better than expected. I followed it mostly, but made some substitutions as needed to use what I had on hand. For the record, I don't usually like chili, and I have never tried to make it before. But this was very satisfying and delicious. Ok. My subs: 1/2 large acorn squash for butternut, equal part strained tomatoes for diced, baby spinach for chard. I added a bit of salt and served with grated monterey jack cheese. It was too spicy for my 3 year old son, but hit the spot for daddy and me.

Rating: 4
This is a pretty easy, delicious, and hearty meal. I think with all recipes you should play with the seasoning to your liking, so if you think it's bland just spice it up! I put in a cinnamon stick, used roasted and ground cumin seeds, minced a serrano pepper in with the garlic and onion, and used a homemade vegetable stock and it was great. Keep in mind that butternut squashes are a pain to cut up and may take a while, but other than that it's a rather simple recipe.

Rating: 4
We loved this chili! My husband was a little dubious when he saw the ingredients going in, but he was a big fan of the results. I cooked my own black beans instead of using canned and replaced the canned tomatoes with 3 diced tomatoes (skin and all). I also served it with brown rice, although I think it would be filling enough without it.

Rating: 2
I would say that this recipe was ok. I was intrigued by all the positive reviews so I tried it, but squash and tomatoes and beans? Not exactly my cup of tea. Especially since I actually like the taste of butternut squash - that flavor was totally lost in the dish. Probably won't make again, but I'm glad I tried it. I also substituted kale for chard and thought it added a nice flavor.

Rating: 4
Whoa! I'd give this recipe 5 forks if I could! I added spinach instead of chard. Used an entire squash, 2 cans of beans,and only 1 can of tomato. Added a bit more veggie broth. All my ingredients were no- sodium, so I added just a pinch of salt and black pepper. So hearty, I was able to eat it as the main course and was stuffed with just one bowl! You'll never miss the meat. Amazing as-is but can easily be adjusted to taste.

I love this chili. It's healthy, it tastes good, and it gives me yet another great way to use fresh Michigan swiss chard. I doubled the garlic, added a green pepper and fresh Michigan corn (last of the season--boohoo) and used only two cans of beans. I forgot to add my jalepeno, as planned, so I just put in a few dashes of tabasco sauce at the end to give it a little heat. Topped it with some chopped raw onion and a tablespoon of lowfat sour cream. Wished I had some cilantro. I'm dieting, and this gave me a bowlful of hearty chili for only about 300 calories, as well as a great nutrition score. I'm lovin' it!

Rating: 4
This is simply delicious, I can not understand some of the reviews saying that it is bland, I figure it must be people who like to put in unusual ingredients such as chocolate and cinnamon. Granted it needs a little more salt but otherwise I made this as is with the 3 cans of beans and as long as you cook it for at least 30 mins to thicken the broth you will not be disappointed! Even my son loved it and he doesn't like veges!

Rating: 4
I agree with those who said this was a bit bland. So I added 1 tbsp of worchestershire sauce, and 1 tbsp of dijon mustard (got these ingredients from another great chili recipe I have) and it really makes a difference. My husband and I both love this chili and make it once a week!

Delicious! This would be wonderful in the fall, but it's also good now (late summer). I used 2 cans of black beans instead of 3, as mentioned by another reviewer. I didn't think it tasted bland at all, and I used the recommended measurements for seasonings. Great vegan option.

This is a great recipe. Easy and quick to make. I bet it will be better tomorrow!! yields are obviously off (3 cans of beans). I would say it serves 8. Only needed addition: sea salt! Some asiago cheese on top is a nice compliment to this dish. Next time we are going to try it with cannellini beans and ground turkey....

Amazing! Def needs salt and pepper and I added a bit of red pepper flakes to add more heat without the salt. Also added a bit more broth (32 ounces total). The sour cream and cheddar cheese is a must. My new favorite recipe on Epicurious!

A nice departure from your average chili. Lately I've been in love with swiss chard and this is a nice way to prepare it. I definitely encourage serving it with the suggested toppings. Yummy!

OH my my! Put this together on a flash and what a surprising taste. Fresh and light you will get your daily dose of veggies and like it. Plus a bit of proton from the black beans. I think your kids will even want a second bowl. Yes I did use my own turkey stock from the freezer but otherwise followed recipe. Will be making some fresh tortilla chips to serve with. So go ahead and grab that bunch of Swiss chard and now you will know what to do with it. Enjoy!

gosh. this is to "A Cook from San Francisco on 01/14/11" - CHILL. If you've been around this site for awhile, you'll realize the value in the review is in your fellow cooks' experiences with the recipe at hand. For a recipe with 136 reviews, I'm not surprised that there are more than a few changes. Try starting at the beginning of the reviews if you want an "honest opinion" - it will be easier on your blood pressure as well as ours. Happy cooking. Love you all. You are a fine lot.

I stand absolutely corrected! The recipe does call for the much-needed seasoning. It's also an easy recipe to play with and a tough one to mess up. (Still, the serving sizes are way out of whack.)

Two forks for the actual recipe, not the potential finished product, which is a three forker. I plan to make this today after a friend made it for a dinner party. She raved about how easy it was, and we all raved that it was so tasty...once it was salted & peppered (not mentioned in recipe). There is obviously NO WAY this serves FOUR. For starters, THREE cans of beans are called for. I believe my friend made it for the party (of 7) and had generous leftovers. Just sayin'...a little obvious math editing should be part of the recipe.

Every time I make this I'm surprised by how good it is, regardless of what proportion of vegetables I use. I tend to use spinach because I usually have some around and if I have a can, I use the diced tomatoes with green chilies. I also add one or two tablespoons of Thai Chili Sauce.

3 1/2 forks really. Made it exactly as written except sauteed a little of my husband's homemade sausage with the onions and garlic (I know, I know, don't yell at me and tell me I changed the recipe from vegetarian to not vegetarian!) and I used fire roasted tomatoes. It was nice to look at, and it was delicious. Served with a little sour cream.

Hello. I have not made this recipe and based on all of the reviews, it looks like nobody else has made this either. Seriously, "A cook from Tacoma", this is a BLACK BEAN, BUTTERNUT SQUASH & CARD recipe, not GROUND BEEF, REFRIED BEANS, SALSA & KALE recipe. This website drives me crazy because everyone just goes on about how they completely changed a recipe and it was so great. Please do not review a recipe if you did not make that recipe. It would help those of us out who want an honest opinion!

This turned out great despite my realizing halfway through that I was short a few ingredients. I ended up using mostly beef stock. Also, I had little less than one tablespoon chili powder, so I used a tablespoon cajun spice and about 3/4 teaspoon ancho chili powder. Topped with chopped red onion, fresh cilantro, and queso fresco. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 4
Super delicious and so easy. I would rate it 3 1/2 forks if I could. I decided on four because I thought the ease of making it and its nutritional value put it above just a 3-fork rating. This is a great vegan recipe to have on hand for a weeknight meal. I made it with 3 tbsp. chili powder and 3 tsp. cumin, as previous reviewers suggested. It was spiced well for my family's taste. Also, I simmered it for almost 1/2 hour before I added the swiss chard. This thickened it up quite well and the flavors had more time to meld. I will definitely make it again. It was very colorful and smelled wonderful.

Was looking for a quick and easy chili recipe and this was it. Modified it a bit, but turned out well. Added cooked ground beef and a can of refried beans as suggested. Also used a container of fresh salsa instead of the canned tomatoes and left out the chard since my grocery store was out of it. A quarter teaspoon of smoked chipotle powder gave it just the right amount of zip. Served it over rice with some Monterey jack cheese and cilantro. It totally hit the spot on a cold almost winter day.

Kid tested, parent approved. This was very tasty (though we put our 15 month old's portion in a little veggie bouillon broth before giving it to her as it was a little spicy) and a great use of our CSA greens. Very aesthetically pleasing as well, which I think was helped by one chickpea can as we only had two cans of black beans on hand. Topped with Yancy's Fancy Buffalo sauce cheese--super yummy!

Rating: 4
So easy and delicious! I only had half an onion, used a chicken bouillon cube mixed with half water and half beer instead of veggie broth, and substituted kale for the swiss chard. This was hearty and satisfying, not to mention the healthiest thing I've made all fall.

I took the advice of many others and added 2 tsp of brown sugar and some cinnamon. I also threw in some red peppers and radishes that I needed to use up. FYI: Radishes really sweeten up when stewed. Delish recipe. As I cook for myself and a varyingly absent adult child, this recipe allows me to freeze individual servings for lunches and future usage. YUM!

Great unusual 'chili'. I was skeptical of the squash, even though I like butternut squash. I made with kale instead of swiss chard, as some reviewer's suggested. I would go back to swiss chard next time, as the kale over-powers the dish (much more pungent than chard, and takes longer to cook). The taste was great, and it's really a pretty dish with vibrant colors! Great use of fall veggie abundance.

Rating: 0
I didn't have swiss chard but really wanted to make this to use my squash. Even without the greens, it was wonderful. I used pinto, kidney and black beans. Only change I would make would be to puree 1/4 to 1/3 and recombine before serving. I think that would have made it even better.

This was really good. But like a nerd, I forgot to get some of the required spices and my boyfriend grinded up some of the spices that are in chili powder, and it was really good, we made our own, homemade chili powder! haha. But this is definitely a yummy recipe.

This chili is truly exceptional! I made a few changes: I added 1 lb. boneless chicken breasts (cut into chunks), 1 14-oz. can fire-roasted diced tomatoes (it was all I had on hand), 1 cup of celery slices, some tumeric powder, and red kale instead of Swiss Chard (which I'm allergic to). I wasn't sure what I'd think of butternut squash with the black beans in a chili. But it was amazing! My daughter said it was the best soup she'd ever eaten, and I agree! We both ate half of the recipe, and it will truly be one of our favorite dinners to make. I highly recommend it to everyone! I've never had a chili I've enjoyed more!

The husband made this tonight and even though I'm not a huge fan of swiss chard- this was GREAT. I was thinking that no meat would be a downer but didn't miss it at all. The blend of sweet squash and salty beans was perfectly balanced..the squash added a rich lusciousness that was unexpected. Will definitely do this again. Mega keeper!

Made this with 3 tablespoons of chili powder and 3 teaspoons cumin as reviews suggested and I added some chipotle chilis with adobo too. I didn't have tomatoes so I used some salsa instead. I let it simmer for a long time and it thickened nicely although the leaves lost some of their color. It turned out amazing, everyone had seconds and thirds until it was all gone. Definitely will make it again!

Three and a half forks, really. This was wonderfully delicious, not just delicious. A DEFINITE repeat. I increased the spices as other reviews suggested (and added cinnamon - yum!), and found the heat just a little bit TOO hot. To combat that, I added more of lots of other things - more squash, more swiss chard, more stock (that ended up boiling down quite a bit). I added one tablespoon of brown sugar as well, and the soup / stew / chili - whatever this is - was PERFECT. The extra squash I actually threw in the oven and roasted for twenty minutes before adding it to the soup, and I think it imparted a great sweet roasted flavor. This is now on permanent recipe rotation for us :)

Wow, that's good. Just the answer for the first cold spell of the season. I substituted the tomatoes with a can of fire roasted tomatoes for a smoky, spicy touch.

Happy to be 100th reviewer, which clearly speaks well for the appeal of this chili! Along with great flavor, the speediness and good nutrition make this a GREAT chili! Like so many reviewers, I was inspired to make ingredient adjustments due to availablity and lack: Added lb.ground turkey/1 can o beans (not 3), Dean/Deluca hot curry blend - because I love it, and frozen chopped spinach, though would have LOVED chard or kale (snowing shut-in, so happy to have pulled it off). Gotta go - told neighbor and she is coming over to try it!

Yum. This was delicious. I would use kale instead of chard next time for a bit more green flavor. I used a large can of diced tomatoes. I also overspiced it based on other reviewers, adding extra chili, cayenne, and a chipotle in adobo. I had to add some pureed pumpkin to mellow the heat a bit, which worked to thicken the chili up nicely. Good and healthy comfort food.

I loved this recipe! I did make a few substitutions based on what I hand on hand. I used kabocha and kale instead of butternut and swiss chard. I also used beef broth instead of veggie as I thought it would give it a richer flavor. I followed others recommendation and added 3 chipoltle chilis in adobo sauce when I added the tomatoes and increased the spices to 3tbs of chili powder and 1tbs of cumin (also added a dash of cayenne as I like heat). This chili is healthy, filling, and oh so savory and delicious. Don't skip the garnishes (reduced fat sour cream, diced red onion, and cilantro) as they really kick it up a notch.

Very good and tastes better with age. I made this with old ground cumin (less flavor) and kale instead of the swiss chard because the store didn't have any. Although the butternut squash may not absorb the flavor, I boiled it before peeling and dicing to make it easier. I'll definitely top with cilantro next time.

This is delish, I was so happy to see a recipe that called for everything I had and wanted to use up and it turned out so, so good. I did vamp up the spices quite a bit and in face used garam masala with the chili powder (no cumin on it's own) so mine is fairly spicy also added celery and carrots to the onion and garlic. Cilantro and onion a must, I skipped the cheese but did top with a bit of plain yogurt. Would be great with rice, but since the diet police say try not to eat so much starch, I didn't make any. This one is a keeper.

I wasn't quite sure how these ingredients would meld, but since the reviews were generally positive, I went for it. I had a moment, when I threw in the black beans and tomatoes, where I thought, "Oh, no, this is going to be awful." I couldn't have been more wrong! A surprising but wonderful combination of flavors. I doubled the butternut squash because I had it, and would maybe even put a little more in next time. I used spinach, and it really added a lot, as well as a handful of cilantro and 1.5 chipotle chillies in adobo (i'll up it to 2 next time).

Just made this for dinner this evening and my husband and I both loved it. I don't think my children (7 and 4) would have ever considered eating this, so I made them grilled cheese. Too bad for them... I didn't have three cans of black beans, so I made it with one can of black beans and two cans of white beans. I only had just under a tsp. of chili powder, so I used a can of diced tomatoes that had green chilis in it. My hubs still thought it needed more heat...I thought it was perfect. I used chicken broth instead of veg. broth. I dressed it in the bowl with a drizzle of high-end EVOO. Will make sure next time we have some fresh, crust rolls on hand to wipe out the bowls! I will absolutely place this one in the "keeper" file and forward it to my foodie friends.

I think this recipe is a really great one for the "standard" black bean chili. I made the mistake of using frozen butternut squash which of course lent no flavor to the dish. I'm sure it would be great with fresh b.n. squash. Overall, good sturdy recipe, hard to mess up.

Really good, although more than 4 servings! I played around with the ingredients a little, used acorn squash, spinach and low-sodium beef broth and added cinnamon like some other folks recommended. For color, I used 1 can black beans, 1 can kidney, 1 can of corn and 1/2 cup diced low-sodium ham. Topped with chopped green onions, reduced fat cheddar and a sprinkle of crushed corn chips. A very versatile recipe.

It's delicious! I also added some cinnamon and chipotle peppers in adobo sauce like others suggested ( a bit, it's very hot). Smells soo good too. My kids (5 & 7) kept taking more and raving about it. Can't beat that, especially considering all the vegetables in it. A sure keeper.

Excellent! We used pre-cut root veggies from Trader Joes and added cinnamon and a little cayenne pepper as suggested. Next time I will chop swiss chard a little more. Chard needs more than teh 4 minutes mentioned in the recipe to soften up. Makes a lot! We'll freeze some.

Fabulous! Good as is or use 1/2 chicken broth, extra cumin and chile powder. We pureed 1/3 of the chile prior to swiss chard to thicken. We minimized the cooking time of the squash and found that it cooked through while sitting.

Excellent dish. I added chipotle and cinnamon as suggested in other reviews. I also added some leftover grilled chicken.

A quick & easy weeknight staple. Also makes great leftovers. I double the chard and eat as a main dish, topped with white cheddar and low-fat sour cream. I love spice, so I add about a 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. cayenne while simmering for depth of flavor. The recipe allows you to play around quite a bit with ingredients - I've made this with acorn squash and kale and it was excellent.

I boosted the spice in this quite a bit - used 1.5 tablespoons each of chipotle powder, ancho powder, and hot chili powder, and added some green chiles. (Obviously, we like things spicy.) It was tasty, but it made *way* more than four servings. Still, the leftovers are good!

This was a huge hit at my Halloween Dinner Party. I made this twice. I would suggest using slightly less broth than they ask to if you're putting in the entire can of tomatoes with juices.

Healthful & satisfying. No need to make changes--good as is. Try topping with a dollop of sour cream. I removed the stems & center ribs from the chard leaves, then sliced ribs/stems on bias 1/4 inch--this can then be added along with the onions. I've substituted chicken broth or stock for the veg broth--I keep a jar of "Organic Better Than Bouillon Chicken Base" in my fridge; Bring 2 1/2 cups water to boil (a pyrex measure in microwave works well), then stir 2 1/2 teaspoons of the chicken base into the boiling water.

This was excellent--I added 2 cans of tomatoes, a heaping spoonful of tomato paste, 2 chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, and used turnip greens. Don't be shy with the chili powder, cumin, and tomatoes, and this will be anything but dull!

I thought this was sortof good-blah. I had to use acorn squash and kale - but I wouldn't think that should dramatically change it? Topped with sharp cheddar it was passable but prob. won't make again.

this was really good. i didn't make it quite as written; i only had 1 can of beans, though i would have liked more. guess i'll have to try it again with the full amount. i used an extra can of tomatoes and the liquid from the can of beans in place of the broth. served with cornbread and a salad, was a great meal!

What a disappointment! So much doctoring after the fact, and I still could not salvage this mess, even to call it "edible." It was bland, watery, and lacked anything that could be considered in the slightest to be redemptive. Yuck!

If this is chili, where the heck are the peppers? Add green red and yellow peppers and jalapenos and you are good. A little more cumin and some beer make it a very good veggie chili.

This was delicious. I deviated from the recipe only in adding a chopped canned chipotle.

Rating: 1
For this recipe, all you do is dump some cans of beans and a can of tomatoes in a pot and add some veggies. And that's what it tastes like. I like the flavor and texture of the squash a lot, but the dish as a whole is bland. It's supposed to be vegetarian, I guess, but if I ever make it again I'll be sure to start with chopped bacon.

Delicious! As mentioned by other reviewers, this was quick and easy to put together, and very satisfying. The next time I make it I'll use chard--I used spinach this time because I had some on hand.

I made this as a weeknight meal and it was very easy. I added some chipotle peppers and used chicken stock instead of vegggie stock and it worked well. I also used sweet potato instead of squash as mentioned by some others and I really liked it. Will try with squash next time. Leftovers freeze well.

I did not expect this dish to be so tasty. It is wonderful because, not only does it taste good, it is very healthy. I cook the butternut squash cubes about 5 minutes longer than the recipe instructs.

What a creative and unique chili recipe! It was a hit at the chili cookout -- and it's meat free too. I used all kosher & organic ingredients, which I think makes a difference. I did change the recipe slightly... I added an extra can of beans, some jalapenos (wow, what a kick!), an entire butternut squash, extra onion, and extra garlic. I topped with freshly grated cheddar cheese :) Delicious!

Huh. I must be missing something. I made this as written with the exception of substituting spinach for Swiss chard. Very boring. There are much better black bean chili and soup recipes out there.

This recipe was great with just a few changes. I added a couple of zucchini and also used two cans of diced tomatoes with onion and green pepper. Following the advice of other reviewers, I used spinach instead of swiss chard. I added some chopped cilantro at the end. And finally, I would definitely recommend at least doubling the amount of chili powder if you are at all into spice. It's great with shredded cheddar on top! All in all, a great healthy vegetarian soup recipe.

This wasn't bad, but it definately wasn't that great either. For the amount of effort I put into this, the results, well, kind of sucked and the leftovers went un-eaten. First off, (and I'll admit, my cooking skills aren't advanced) it was so hard to cut the squash into chunks! There has to be an easier way I don't know yet! But, my main complaint was that this took way longer than the recipe claimed to cook. It was all right in the end, but neither my boyfriend nor I are vegetarians, so as a main course, it left us wanting more. I think this would be better as a side dish.

Yum. A fabulous one-pot meal for a chilly January night in Minnesota. Even my it's-not-a-meal-unless-there's-meat husband liked it.

I loved this chili! After reading other reviews and wondering what they meant about adding more flavor, I realized that I'm not an exact measurer (the center of my palm, in my opinion = a tablespoon). Here's hoping that I can make it again the same way because it was perfect. I made one teensy adjustment and substituted a large handful chopped cilantro at the end instead of the chard. I also didn't notice the time it took to cook and just let it simmer for awhile. DELICIOUS!!

This dish was easy and very well-received. I made it for me and my boyfriend and then ended up feeding it to two additional friends - everyone raved about how good it was (and they weren't just being nice). As suggested by another reviewer, I used an extra can of tomatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe. Just be warned, this makes more than 4 servings! With the extra can of tomatoes, I ended up with 8 full servings.

A really delicious and very healthy weeknight meal. I made it with Sweet potatoes instead of squash and used chicken stock. Also added chipotle pepper which really adds a great flavour. Served with whole grain rolls and garnishes mentioned. Very filling and satisfying.

Worth trying, but seemed to lack a bit of flavor, so play with it. I will follow the new comment and add more chili and tomato puree. I'll also cook for longer next time, as the squash was pretty hard.

I upped the spices a bit. I like it more tomato-y, so I added a larger can of diced tomatoes and a sm.can of tomato paste. I found the squash kind of distracting, I'll cut the pieces smaller and add them later next time. made it in a crock, it was definitely better after simmering an extra hour.

Really a terrific veg entree. Two minor adjustments-- after 10 minutes of simmering the squash, I added two zucchini. I also didn't have chard but substituted broccoli rabe. Rave reviews from my two foody friends... and even better the next day!

This is fantastic. I cut the chili powder just a little bit (1.5 Tbs) and I used chipotle powder since that was what I had - the smokiness was delicious. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious, cheap, easy, quick, healthy. What's not to love? I make it all the time, and it is positively addicting once you start eating it. I'm a vegan, and this chili has a very satisfying texture, even without meat.

I made this for my father-in-law because he is trying to lower his cholesterol levels. He and my husband are both big meat-eaters and they loved it, as did my mother-in-law and I. Comments included: "the best vegetarian chili I've ever had" and "it's very meaty tasting". I served it with chopped fresh cilantro, fat-free sour cream and low-fat shredded Mexican cheese blend for toppings. The reason I'm giving this recipe 3 forks instead of 4 is that it just wasn't spicy enough for us, but that's easily remedied. Next time I make it, I'll add fresh jalapenos and I might try kale instead of Swiss chard, just to experiment.

Eliminated the swiss chard since I don't like it. Added 1 teaspoon of garam masala and a handful of chopped cilantro. Cooked the chili for about 1 1/2 hours and then refrigerated for 2 days. Chili was good that day but even better the 3rd day. This will be a vegetarian staple in our house.

Delicious and easy! I didn't have cumin, but the flavor didn't seem to suffer from the lack of it. I used Muir Glen fire-roasted tomatoes and added about 1/4 tsp of cayenne for some heat. My boyfriend (a meat eater) and I (a vegetarian) both loved this chili. We topped it with a spoonful of nonfat plain yogurt and some fresh cilantro. Will definitely make again.

Great, easy, filling. Added a bit of cayenne to give it some kick, and used a bit more stock (chicken) because it was starting to get too dry. Definitely microwaved the squash for 5 minutes before trying to peel, way easier. Served with a side of sugar snap peas and brussels sprouts.

I also added a few fresh pizza peppers for just a little extra pop. To top it off, I garnished the soup with a little sprinkle of feta cheese on top, and served it with fresh-baked, lightly-salted tortilla chips. This is one of those soups where a little goes a long way in your stomach, so even though it says 4 entree servings, you can easily make it 8, especially with tortilla chips.

This is THE best vegetarian chili I have ever tasted. I used acorn squash instead of butternut (I cooked it on HI in the microwave for 5 min. to make it easier to peel and chop) and it was a perfect choice. I added a handful of chopped cilantro toward the end of cooking, added a can of chick peas and cannelini beans and used a can of diced tomatoes seasoned with chipotle which added the perfect amount of heat. I also added a cup of frozen corn and only used one can of the vegetable broth cuz we like our chili thick. i served it with an assortment of crusty breads, corn muffins and warmed flour tortillas. Every bit of chili was gone. I'll be making this recipe alot.

Delicious. I love this recipe. It's really simple to double the recipe also. I did not have swiss chard on hand, instead I will put baby spinach in each individual bowl (so it won't turn to mush in the pot). I thought the dish could use some more spice, next time I'll add some chipotles in adobo sauce. The butternut squash adds a perfect texture. When I reheat the leftovers tomorrow, I will add shredded chicken from a rotisserie, i think it'll be the perfect addition. Also, I hate chopping butternut squash. I have found it's much easier if I put the entire butternut whole in the microwave for up to 10 minutes depending on the size, it makes it a million times easier to peel and cut.

I've made this dish several times now, and I love it more each time. I've been a vegetarian for 13 years, so I'm always looking for new recipes. This is one I'll hang on to. I susbtituted sweet potato for the squash, and I would reccommend adding the swiss chard only to the portions that you're serving immediately. It tends to turn an unappetizing brown when refridgerated in the chili

This recipe was Excellent! Tasty and super easy and quick. I recommend washing the beans off and using no salt added tomatoes to keep the salt down. The broth adds enough. Also don't over cook or you will lose chunky texture of the squash. Don't even tell people it is vegetarian it is so good they won't ask.

I have never been the least bit interested in a vegetarian (vegan?)chili recipe, but I tried this because (1) I'm on a veggie kick and (2) the good reviews. What a surprise. It is absolutely delicious. I just ate my first bowl right out of the pot and all the ingredient flavors are still separate. I think this may actually be the preferable state with this dish because I don't see how it could be better. We will see how it tastes the next day. Made as written, but: added 1 t. of chipotle powder and 1 t. of ancho powder; doubled the garlic; used Muir Glen fire-roasted tomatoes; topped with extra-sharp white cheddar. In my opinion, this would feed six rather than four.

This was a terrific vegetarian chili dish -- I loved the addition of squash and chard, particularly for the nutrient value. I enhanced the dish by adding a half can of beer, some chipotle sauce from Whole Foods and a cup of goya tomato sauce to help thicken the chili after the addition of the beer. Served over brown rice with sides of red onion, cilantro, avocado, cheddar and non-fat sour cream. A good healthy mid-week dinner with lots of leftovers for the freezer.

This was really interesting, healthful and tasty! Instead of 3 cans of beans I used 2; I bought the pre-chopped squash from Trader Joe's (easy!), used baby spinach instead of Chard (store was out of it) and, since I discovered at the last minute that I was out of canned tomatoes, I used about 2 Tbs. tomato paste. It drives me nuts to see reviews that aren't based on the actual recipe, but I'm anxious to make this again w/ the addition of canned tomatoes and chard. As it was, we really enjoyed the end result. It was a terrific and easy weeknight dinner!

Came out great. As with all chile/soup recipes, quantities are approximate. Add what you like or what you need to create the consistency/taste you desire. As with all vegetarian recipes, much improved with the addition of chicken, sausage, or GASP!, beef.
