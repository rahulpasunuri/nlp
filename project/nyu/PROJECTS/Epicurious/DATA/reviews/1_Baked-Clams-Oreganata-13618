we make these often, but without the peppers. Needs more oregano too, but we used beer to moisten and a little lemon juice. Much improved!

Can lose the peppers, and way way way too dry. On second try, I drissled the clams with half a bottle of clam juice then sprayed a liberal amount of olive oil over each clam. (also a good smattering of chopped garlic) It came out much better, actually pretty good, but I've definately had better. better luck next time

I found the clams to be too dry. When I order them out, there is always some type of juice on the serving dish, which my family usually dips Italian bread in.

As an Italian man who has been trying to recreate his grandmother's recipe for 30 years, (came close enough too!) I strongly recommend leaving out the peppers, and adding about a bottle of clam juice, or a combination of the liquid that comes out of the clams themselves and the bottled kind. This came out way too dry for my taste.

I love clams oregenata, but the dish takes quite awhile to make and this version of the recipe unfortunately turned out a very dry and not entirely cooked set of clams. If I tried the recipe again I'd bake the clams 7 minutes longer and use white wine with the bread crumb mixture.
