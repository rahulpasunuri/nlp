Delicious - I did lime as suggested by others, but be careful--- a little goes a long way. I also added 1/4 cup water right away and wish I would have waited until I saw the consistency. I really didn't need the water so the dip was a little too loose. I will make this again! Great for my vegan friends:)

This dip was a hit at my last dinner party. I remained faithful to the recipe not changing anything. One caveat: I would not cook the potatoes in the mircrowave. It's faster but you don't get the carmelization that you get baking it in the oven.

Everyone loved that dip and ate it before all other available dips. I did, however add the juice of 1/2 lime for .75lbs of yams. Didn't have any scallions but put in 1 clove of garlic for my much smaller quantity. I also used fresh bell pepper.

I thought this was one of the worst dips I'd ever made. It was akin to bean dip in texture but the taste was so blah - sweet goo - that I threw it down the garbage disposal before even offering it to anyone. And I am very adverse to throwing anything out.

Everyone who tried this just loved it. My friend who hates sweet potatoes was converted. It was easy-easy to make. I recommend using a fresh halapeno pepper, and fresh roasted red peppers.

used marie sharp's pepper sauce (a few shakes) vs. pepper. also substituted lime juice for balsamic vinegar. fresh cilantro is a must. we try to use this as a dip but mostly we eat it with a spoon.
