Nice Panna Cotta. I didn't get to use cherries, but used fruit in season. (marinated blood orange goes great with chocolate) This is a recipe that is very forgiving and one that you can make better by tasting as you go instead of blindly following the recipe. For instance: If you don't like it so rich you can use half & half or all milk (just don't let it boil if you don't use cream) Adding a little more sugar or adding brown sugar can help folks who think it was bland. You can add a bit more chocolate as well. The quality and sugar content of your chocolate will make make a difference. I used 80% chocolate and used brown sugar and tasted it to see if it needed more. Sugar like salt brings out flavor, but it is an individual thing. Taste it before you put it in the fridge. Finally, You don't have to un-mold them. I put my panna cotta in wine glasses and in verines and just put the sauce in the glass on top when I served it.

I would not make this to impress anyone, but it is a nice simple chocolately ending to a meal that you can make up real quickly. I used regular sized muffin tins to mold and it took about 4 hours to set in the fridge.

I made this as a desert to an all Italian Thanksgiving dinner I made a few years ago. The panna cotta was great and the sauce was also fantastic. I used fresh cherries (which were hard to find in November). I followed the recipe to a "T". Use the recommended chocolate in the recipe. I can't see how it could have come out being "bland" as one reviewer mentioned. I found it to be the opposite. The panna cotta was extremely rich--half was almost enough. I had come back to this recipe because I wanted to impress a special chocolate lover in my life.

Way over-rated. Made for 13 people & was underwhelemd by the panna cotta. The sauce was only okay...

I wanted to be "wowed", but wasn't. I made this for 13 people for a dinner party & thought it was just okay. It was rather dull - flavor was bland, despite using high- quality extra dark chocolate. The sauce was good, not great...

This recipe was a HUGE hit, even with my boyfriend who's very finicky about his chocolate. I modified the panna cotta quite a bit by using 2 TBS agar agar flakes instead of gelatine, one cup buttermilk instead of milk, only 1/3 cup sugar and used 8 oz. of Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate chips. I mixed all of the ingredients together, brought them to a boil, then simmered them for 20 minutes to completely dissolve the agar agar. Everyone was amazed that seaweed could taste so good! It had a very smooth texture akin to a creamy souffle and was very chocolatey without being overly sweet.

If I were just rating the panna cotta, I would give it 2 forks. However, the cherry sauce is fantastic! The combination of fresh cherries, port, and vinegar is really delicious...and made the panna cotta a worthwhile dessert!

This dish has become my signature dessert. I make it everytime we have special company over, and its always a smash hit. I love it for entertaining because not only is it a show stopper, most of it can be made the day before. I make the sauce before guests arrvie for dinner, let it sit at room temp, then rewarm just before serving. I tried fresh cherries once and didn't notice a difference from frozen, so I always use frozen. Fantabulous!

Fantastic, but soooooo rich. 3/4 cup of this stuff per person is way too much. I made it for Valentine's Day (dividing the recipe by 3 to get 2 servings) and I barely got through half of what was on my plate. I used Valhrona dark chocolate for the panna cotta, and it was perfect. I only had frozen cherries, and the sauce needed a little extra acid at the end for balance.

I have made this desert twice with outstanding results! Make sure you use a good port and have a glass along with!

This is a wonderful recipe! The port reduction is a perfect match for cherries and chocolate. I can't wait to make it again!

This dessert was incredible! The Panna Cottas were velvety smooth, and the cherry sauce was divine. I used frozen (sweet) cherries, and they were great in the sauce. I also used bittersweet Callebaut chocolate, which was a nice contrast to the sweet cherries. This was a perfectly decadent Valentine's Day dessert, and easy to make. Wonderful with Port!

Everyone loved this recipe, however it was very rich and half of the searving would have been more than enough, though no one stopped there! The sauce was to die for and would be wonderful on many other dishes, even ice cream!!

Made this for a cooking club. Excellent! I had never had panna cotta before and it is easy to make and very creamy. The cherry sauce took this recipe over the top. Wonderful combination of flavors.

Don't waste the calories. For this sort of indulgance I want a show stopper, and this wasn't it. It wasn't bad, but a dark chocolate pudding would have been as satisfying, with a lot less artery-clogging fat. The sauce was good, but lacked complexity, and combined with the panna cotta it made the whole thing too sweet. I'd definitely use the sauce with something more bitter--perhaps a flourless dark chocolate cake --and I'd add a little spice, the barest hint of nutmeg, maybe, to make the sauce more intriguing.

Serving size needs scaled down. It was a mousse like consistancy and the first half was really enjoyable but all of my guest felt they should have quit half way through because it was quite rich. I substitued the cherries for peaches and the sauce is a winner, as a topping for other desserts, I will make the sauce again.

My sister in law made this; it's divine. She used strawberries rather than cherries. I count the days before making it myself.

This recipie was very easy to make and practically fool proof. Removing the panna cottas from the souffle cups required a little coaxing but that was the most difficult part. I make desserts at a high class country club. This desert was easy to make in bulk and the members loved it.

Decadence on wheels. A real winner!!

This was very quick and easy to make and my family loved it. Wondered whether to use pie cherries or bing cherries. I used bing cherries and I think that was a good choice. Would like to try the receipe using all whole milk and no cream just to cut some calories and cholesterol.

Wonder if it would be more mature with chocolate being over 70% pure, maybe a puertofino from Domori. any thoughts?

If you do not have the time to make the panna cotta, using a chocolate flan recipe also works well with the cherries.

this was soooo delicious!

This is a must-make. The Panna Cotta is outstanding on its own but try it with the cherries for an extraordinary dessert. I have made this several times using fresh cherries but it is just as good with the frozen variety. I also experimented with placing the Panna Cotta mixture in small plastic cups and putting them in the freezer. YUMMY--makes for some serious competition for those premium ice creams found in the supermarket.
