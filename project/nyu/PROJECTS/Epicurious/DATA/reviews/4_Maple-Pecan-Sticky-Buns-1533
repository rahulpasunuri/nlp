I really enjoyed the subtlety of the citrus flavour. The brightness help offset the rich sticky glaze. As well, the oats gave the dough a slightly rustic look and was a welcome textural change. This is a good recipe to try if you want something different from a traditional sticky bun. However, if you do want a more classic sticky bun, try the 'Ultimate Sticky Buns' recipe on this site. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Ultimate-Sticky-Buns-106413

I first reviewed these in 2001 from Montreal. These sticky buns are still labor intensive, still wonderful, still worth it. I make them a few times a year, but it has become tradition that we have them for breakfast on my son's birthday. I turn them out of the baking pans onto a wax-paper lined jelly roll pan and move to a nice platter once they've cooled a bit. They're easier to handle like this, and the wax paper keeps the syrup on the buns where it belongs!!

I've been making this recipe since I found it in 1996. It has turned into our Christmas morning tradition and everyone loves them,!! I also make a batch a few days early and hand them out warm to our neighbors. It's such an easy recipe that you put together the night before and then bake the next morning ~~ yummy!!

These sticky buns are beyond fabulous! Warm from the oven, they are just about the best thing I have ever eaten--well worth the effort and expense.

Toothachingly sweet, not all sorts of exciting.

I've tried other sticky bun recipes but always come back to this one. It has no equal. Yesterday, I mixed golden raisins and dried cranberries with the pecans in the filling. Delicious AND beautiful! These also work in miniature (2 dozen) if you're watching calorie consumption.

I have been making this recipe since the original issue in 96. Made it over Memorial Day for a brunch. Started the process a little later (should do the first proof the prior night). The guests waited two hours to get their hands on them. Consistently the most popular (and time consuming) brunch item I've made. But everyone seems to love them so! P.S. don't skimp! Once they cool a little you get that nice, sticky, almost candy like consistency. Irresistible!

yuck. dry, labor-intensive, unappetizing. followed the instructions exactly, but got a bunch of bland biscuits filled with pecans and sugar. what a waste.

I made a half recipe using a basic bread machine sticky bun recipe for the dough, as well as slightly increasing the pecan and raisin amounts. It was fantastic and very easy. I'll definitely be making this many more times.

WOW are these good! I am not a baker but I found the dough very easy to prepare. I didnt finely chop the filling as I like it chunky and it worked great. Freezes great too. SOOOO delicious, careful if youre on a diet, they are addictive!

Too easy, and very good. I froze the unbaked dough and let it thaw in the fridge overnight, and the buns came out perfectly. I'd add more big pieces of pecans to the sauce. Be careful when you turn out the baked product; I used a china platter and the heat cracked it.

DELICIOUS! The second time, instead of the suggested dough, I made some basic dough in the bread machine.... BIG time and work saver. Some bread machine recipe books have a recipe for sticky buns or something similar. Either way, the sauce is what totally makes this recipe what it is: Amazing. Made it for fathers day along with fruit salad and strawberry smoothies... I probably could even have gotten away without a gift! Very good with hazlenuts.

This was my first time making sticky buns and I have to admit that these were wonderful! The only thing I would change would be to cut down on the syrup because it was a little too sweet, even for a dessert junkie like me.

These are yummy! Easy to make. The texture of the bread is very light and the lemon peel adds a nice zing. Next time I make it, though, I will use about a 1/3 of the syrup with the filling instead of the melted butter as the recipe makes more than needed to abundantly coat the bottom of the pans.

Labor intensive, but so worth it. Everyone at work raved and gobbled them up. Just today a co worker asked when I was going to make them again! A recipe to impress.

i love this recipie. it is my second time making it and all my staff simply said it is the best stickey buns they ever had. however instead of doning 1 dozen i made enouth dough to serve 4 dozen. if a 13 year old baker can make it (which i just happen to be) then i bet anyone can science it is so easy. i cant wait to let my customers try it <@:).

A great recipe. I like raisins, so I will use at least 1 cup in the future. Also, I used only 4 cups, to keep it from getting too heavy. Instead of putting two large cake pans in the refrigerator, I let the dough rise in the bowl overnight in the refrigerator, and let it warm the next morning, but not to room temperature. This made the dough a snap to roll out, without the problem of activating the gluten. I was in a hurry, so I let the second rising last only 30 minutes, but the results were still great.

Was a bit hesitant when I started out because the preparation process was so long but this turned out fantastic - if you have all day to spend preparing and baking them. I used walnuts, cut down the maple syrup to 3/4 cup and reduced all the other sugars by about 1/4 cup. Was still sweet enough and is not for the calorie conscious. Also used low-fat milk because there was nothing else at home.

Great!! I put all filling ingredients in saucepan and cooked them together till butter melted. I cut dough in half after letting it rise and made 2 rolls - cut one into 15 buns and one into 16. They're plenty big.

I loved this stuff but needed more cheesey poofs

These where great and I don't have a clue when it comes to breads. I did take longer to proof coming out of the fridge and if your not a nut fan like me cut back on the pecans. Almost to over powering, next time I'll use half and not bother with the ones on the bottom of the pan. Make 14-16 smaller ones because these are huge.

I made these for Easter brunch and they were a huge hit. These are time consuming, but worth the trouble. Rave reviews from everyone!

Outrageous!!! They're rich, sweet-- an absolute culinary masterpiece. They taste great and look too good to eat. I bake them at 350 and shave about 5 minutes off the recommended baking time. I make sixteen smaller ones instead of a dozen, so we feel less guilty about eating two. My 7-year old told the owner of our neighborhood bakery (who makes a decent sticky bun of his own), "yours are good, but Mommy's are better." They're a lot of work, and worth every step.

Oh my God! These are so good. A bit of an effort but well worth it. We made it for my husband for Father's Day and it was such a treat.

Although long and involved, this recipe is perfect for me - foolproof! I found the baking time to be a little too much, however. Next time I'll reduce it by 10 minutes. These are best straight out of the freezer.

Excellent! Just had a batch for our family reunion...what a hit. Now the children want to help.

I made this recipe before the internet and thought it was so incredibly delicious. I'm glad I can save it on the internet now and find it easily. I don't remember anyones comments on it because I think I ate the whole thing myself. Robin

I have been making this dish for about 2 years.It is always a hit.It was tough finding a dough recipe with substance.I always make extra filling though and keep it in the fridge so as to speed things along.
