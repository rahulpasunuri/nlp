Great recipe, but we find the fennel a little too strong, so we leave it out. We basically go to the farmers market, buy what looks good and roast!

This is one of our favorites. However, after numerous tries, I have found that a non-stick flat roasting tray works as well for me as parchment and is far easier (with no burned paper!) We use what ever vegetables are in season and at the farmers market, but par-cook in microwave the harder root vegetables like carrots. Oh and I don't like fennel so we leave it out!

I wouldn't say that the method truly does "replicate a pan-fried finish" but I still liked this recipe. It is unapologetically a healthy dish. I once added more oil during cooking but it didn't improve the flavor or texture.

This recipe is super easy to make. It's an easy side dish to make and substitutions can only improve it.

Very delicious. It looked like a whole lot of vegetables when I mixed it in the bowl, but once they are roasted, they are very light. I had to make multiple batches, since you can't really overlap the veges in the pan. Also, I found 15 mins was sufficient time for the veges to brown.

This was very good. But the parchment paper turned brittle and burned on the corners. When I tried to seperate the paper from the vegetables, pieces of parchment flaked off. I didn't really mind eating a flake or two of parchment - the fiber's probably right up there. But if I try this again I might try a modified technique.

I love this concept, using parchment for roasting in the oven. I had no fennel or peppers in my fridge, so I left those out. I used my food processor to slice everything, which made it very fast to prepare. One added bonus: I used up the last of the leftovers by using one cup of the vegetables microwaved with a cup of chicken broth - fast and very tasty soup!
