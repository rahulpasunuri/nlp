Terrible. I ate two bites and gave the rest to the dog (who loved it).

These burgers are delicious! We've made these twice now, and I must say, the quality of the sun-dried tomatoes make a big difference in flavor. I have to use gluten-free buns, but the full flavors of the cheddar annd the sun-dried tomatoes make me forget about the whole-grain bread flavor I may be missing. we'll be making these again!

this was great! the burgers came out nice and juicy with minimal effort. i made a few changes to the recipe. i substituted guyere for the cheddar as that is what i had on hand and it was still full of flavor. i also did not make the mayo spread and served the burgers on whole wheat toast. will definitely make this again.

Great recipe. The sun-dried tomato mayonnaise is what makes these burgers special. I substituted toasted 12-grain bread instead of a bun, and thought that it was very good.

I've made a recipe like this for a very long time with lots of alterations depending on what I have in the fridge. One of my favorites is to use dill havarti inside the burgers. It adds that extra burst of flavor some may be missing. If you only have ground turkey breast, add a little extra oil to the shallots and mix that in with the meat; it helps keep it moist and tasty.

This burger and the mayo was very good. My mom didn't know it was turkey and my husband ate it cold and thought it was good.

I'd suggest making double of the scallion mixture, adding garlic is good too! I also stuffed it w/ grilled onions(but as a warning, the burger itself will be huge). Using onion kaiser rolls was delicious too. Obviously, I'm a garlic and onion fan. =) I'd also add more cheese too(perhaps just put it on top of the burger). It was great that this burger was great w/o other condiments, just fresh tomatos and lettuce! Def doing this recipe again!!

this recipe is perfect when cooking for large group. you can make ahead of time and freeze. I preferred not standing by the grill when my guests arrived. Put them in the oven when my guests arrived (on broil last few min.) and they were ready after cocktails/appetizers. they were positively delicious and my guests could'nt stop raving.

Good recipe, nothing to write home about, but nice for a change. They Mayo was really good, I will use a suggestion from another viewer and add some basil to the mayo.

The important item to use in this recipe is use the extra-sharp cheddar cheese. Some previous reviewers complained that the taste was bland. It isn't if you use the correct amount and type of cheese called for in the recipe. The sund-dried tomato mayo was an excellent addition to the burger.

We've made this several times now. It's important to pay attention to the type of ground turkey meat: do not use breast meat only, as it's too dry. It's also important to use good quality sundried tomatoes if you choose to make the mayonnaise. We've used Rothschild's jarred Emerald Dill with success. I've never enjoyed a turkey burger and didn't think I ever would until I tried this recipe and after making this I don't bother to order TBs when dining out --- they all fall short of this recipe.

This was an excellent meal, I made this as the main course for my wife and I and a few of our friends. I am 22 years old and previous to this experience have never myself cooked more than mac and cheese. I made this dish with new potatoes steamed, and served a good red with it. Dinner lasted till midnight and I came off looking like a five star chef, everyone loved it and I didn't bother to mention it was no problem to prepare. Took a first time cook one hour and came out amazing. Thank you to whoever put this recipe up!

I'm rating only the mayo since I didn't make the burgers - the mayo was EXCELLENT. I also added some chopped fresh basil to it and would recommend that. Don't know about the recipe for the turkey burgers though - it reads a little bland. I generally make the recipe for the turkey burgers with coleslaw off of this site (just the burgers, not the law). It's very very good, flavourful, and the meat comes out extremely moist and silky. And to the reviewer from Canada - wow, you make me SO embarassed to be a Canadian! Your comments were totally unprovoked and frankly, unjustified. Why do you even care if someone wants to use American cheese? I don't see how that makes anyone "white trash"... you're a really horrible person!

I've made this dish many times and it always comes out great! The only changes I make are using 1/2 shallots and 1/2 garlic and grilling the burgers on an outside grill.

Great turkey burger recipe. Pairs wonderfully with the sundried tomato mayo. Husband loved it and he's usually not a huge fan of turkey burgers. This one changed his mind.

Great beef substitute. My family's favorite. I have yet to find a shallot that fills 1/4 cup in the UK - I use local shallots - about 1/3-1/2 cup chopped. I also grate the cheese(I use a local Brit cheddar) and just mix it into the turkey. I fry the burgers for about five minutes, then finish them in a 350 (190 C) oven.

This was absolutely tasty! I am not a hamburger fan so when I saw "turkey" burger, I was all about it! I thought it was just as tasty as the real thing, but without all that nasty grissle! Go epicurious.com!

It was really good! I made it with Ground Chicken instead! Just make sure that it is cooked all the way through.

I would recommend to add the sundried tomatoes finely chopped to the meat instead of the mayonaise...

This recipe works equally well with chicken, pork and lamb to give everyone a break from beef burgers. I took the suggestion of toasting the buns, there is something about toasting buns that adds to the overall flavor of the burger.

Along with the shallots I also sauted a whole red onion and two or three garlic cloves with a little oil. I also grilled the buns with butter and then rubbed them with a cut garlic clove. I've made these burgers three times and I've had nothing but great reviews. For those who aren't into beef, these are a GREAT substitute.

I thought this was just plain disgusting. My husband felt this was a burger only turkey burger lovers could endure. Will NOT do again! The pairing of the sun-dried tomato mayonaise with the extra sharp cheese didn't work.

Pretty good for turkey burgers!

Easy yes but tasteless. PLease go and try the goat cheese stuffed turkey burgers with roasted red pepper relish instead...Those are sublime...These are sub par....

WOW! I made these one night (without the mayo) and they were good all by themselves. I added some garlic with the shallots and used white pepper instead of the normal black pepper & salt...SUPER GOOD!

I thought this was really good - nice idea to put the cheese inside. Just make sure you don't overcook the burgers because the cheese will begin to bubble and ooze out. The only changes I made were to use American cheese slices and my George Foreman grill.

This is a great basic recipe for turkey burgers! All I did differently was to use a Foreman grill and add some grilled onions to the sandwich. Yum! This "burger" is not dry like some I have made. Will definitely make this again.

I WOULD REOMEND THIS REIPE TO ANY ONE I LOVE TURKEY ANY WAY IT IS FIXED
