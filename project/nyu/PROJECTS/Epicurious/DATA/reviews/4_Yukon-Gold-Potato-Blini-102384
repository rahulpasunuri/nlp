Deliciousness! Super easy, and the recipe is pretty forgiving. I didn't have a scale, so I just guessed and added cream to the right consistency and they were perfect. Definitely spices up mashed potatoes. I served them with Swedish meatballs and gravy and they were simply divine. For sure this recipe will go in the "keepers" folder of my recipe box.

Nearly every New Year's Eve I serve buckwheat blini with caviar. In 2005 I tried this potato recipe. Like other reviewers, I riced the cooked potatoes. The blini are tasty, but my guests and I found them a bit too rich (a.k.a. filling). Next year, I'll return to the lighter buckwheat blini.

So easy, so perfect. I made these to go with some home made gravadlax, and they were an absolute hit. We don't get Yukon Gold in England (at least not near me) so I used King Edward instead - a nice floury, fluffy type - with great success. We'll be having these again.

Fantastic! Beautiful, light, delicious. Made these as a dinner side. Now have big plans for use as an appetizer base with all toppings suggested by reviewers.

OH...MY...GOODNESS. Spectacular. Delicate. Bite-size heaven, topped with a hint of creme fraiche and a dollop of Sevruga. Blissful perfection. Definitely put the Yukon Golds through a ricer for billowy clowds of deliciousness. Everyone went batty for these blinis.

These blini are incredible! They were easy to prepare. I used a ricer to mash the potatoes and it worked great. You should use 1-1/2 tablespoons of batter for each blini, not teaspoons as reccommended. I topped them with nova lox, creme fraiche, good quality caviar and minced chives.

A variation of this recipe appears in print and on the web. Basically, you use regular cream. After a little experimenting you'll have delightful little potato cakes that you can put just about anything on. It is really all that much different than mashed potatoes? In honesty, no. But in terms of presentation and style, yes! Learn this recipe, because it is simple and can be easily incorporated into many dishes.

Simply outstanding. I expected no less from The French Laundry. Make these exactly as the recipe suggests and you can't go wrong. I served the Blinis with good smoked salmon, asian pickled red onions (thinly sliced onions marinated 24 hrs in seasoned rice wine vinegar), creme fraiche, and capers. One cocktail-party guest tried this and said I was a "food-god." I just followed the recipe!
