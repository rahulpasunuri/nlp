Excellent. I made it exactly as written, ignoring the suggestions below to use balsamic instead of white vinegar. I'm glad I did -- the nice bright flavor of white vinegar really works here. When I make this again, which I definitely will, I'll make two important changes to the technique: (1) I'll skin the tomatoes (easy; you've already got a pot of water boiling) -- as written, you end up with 1/4 inch wide stringy bits of tomato skin in the finished dish. (I may also add a 4th tomato.) (2) I'll add the parsley to the tomatoes and onions just before removing the skillet from the heat, so that it wilts a bit.

This is very good and quite simple to prepare. I used Israeli cous cous instead of orzo because I had it on hand. Other than that, made as written. I think this could be easily adapted to other veggies, like zucchini, and other herbs, like basil. Will definitely make this again.

A good,safe side. Would make again for a potluck but probably not for a meal.

Really enjoyed the dish. I had different beans in the garden (larger, with beans forming inside) and used a trader Joe's grain mix, mostly israeli couscous. The feta and olives give the dish great flavor and should not be omitted.

We really enjoyed this but I made some changes. First, I used it as a salad. I cooked the orzo and blanched the beans. I added the onions and garlic raw. Used cherry tomato halves, feta, chives and parlsley. Dressed the salad with olive oil and balsamic. Nicoise olives would be great using oregano or dill. I served this with grilled salmon. Had the leftover salad for lunch today and it only got tastier.

I mixed orzo with some Israeli couscous and added sauteed shrimp. I forgot the vinegar, which was fine. Added a splash of lemon olive oil at the end and mixed some basil in with the parsley. very good and would make again

Great recipe; used brown rice instead of orzo; added more feta than called for to use what we had on hand, which worked out well; we will make this recipe again2

Excellent! I followed others' suggestions and substituted the white-wine vinegar for balsamic and the parsley for basil. I also didn't cook the tomatoes -- just added them raw. I highly recommend these substitutions! It was great cold and will be great for lunch tomorrow, as well!

This was great. I tweaked in a few ways, too, some suggested by others: Used a combo of green & wax beans, used israeli couscous instead of orzo (and more of it - 1 1/2 cups), added the tomatoes cold, subbed balsamic (1 1/2 T) and subbed basil for the parsley. Used tomato/basil feta. YUM!

Pretty easy to make, although I did make some changes. I used a combo of green beans and wax beans, added part of a half pepper to the garlic and onion, used oregano instead of parsley, used balsamic (as per others suggestions), and used whole wheat penne instead of orzo. I think I will make again, maybe with more hot pepper. The feta is key; don't omit it! Tasted nice, healthy and fresh. Good way to use green beans in a way that isn't a side dish-

Very simple and yummy! I added halved kalamata olives and used basil instead of parsley. We enjoyed it as a one-dish meal.

Rating: 2
Very simple, versatile side dish for just about anything and certainly a stand alone picnic/party salad. Probably lends itself to endless variations. Keep the green beans crunchy to maintain texture. And add salt--quite bland without. Boil orzo in veggie, chicken or some flavored broth.

I would recommend cooking the green beans a little longer than recommended and cutting back a little on the onions. Very easy, very good otherwise.

I made this recipe with Orzo the first time, it was very good. The second time around, I ran out of Orzo, so I used shell pasta, shell pasta is even better! It added more substance to the dish and is less soggy. Both times, I added some chopped fresh shiitake mushrooms (since I had some) to the onion and garlic saute, delicious, it went so well with it. I didn't cook the tomatoes for very long, to keep it from getting mushy - I added to the saute, then took the whole pan off the heat right away. I boiled the green beans longer than the recipe calls for. I added less feta cheese than it calls for. Oh, I also added some chili peppers because we like it spicy. Delicious!

This was excellent! This could actually be a one-dish meal....especially during Lent. Very easy to make and satisfying.

Thought this was very tasty and attractive too, we used grape tomatoes and balsamic vinegar. Served with fish and it was wonderful

A very tasty dish. I didn't have orzo so used a tiny seed shaped pasta which was fine. I also cooked the beans in with the tomatoes (to save pots and pans) to the degree of doneness we like. I used white balsamic but will try regular next time. I put the cooked pasta in the bottom of the serving bowl, the bean/tomato mixture next, topped it all with the feta and basil leaves. Attractive and delicious.

lacklustre. maybe i should have used balsamic.

YUMMY! Has a warm wonderful comfort food quality with a upscale taste. I used French feta and it was perfect combination of flavors. Great if you entertain and have vegetarians to feed. As Sedona is a small town with terrible restaurants, we do a lot of potlucks. This is a perfect dish for that. I might add a few toasted pine nuts next time. I too cooked the green beans a little longer than suggested. Try it, you'll like it!

Like previous reviewers, I think the balsamic vnegar pairs better with the feta. Also, recommend cooking beans so they are just soft not crunchy.

Simple, healthy & very tasty. Used balsamic instead of white vinegar, and cherry tomatoes. While this dish tastes great, I have to say it ended up looking a lot like goulash. Will try to pretty it up a bit next time.

Yum. My boyfriend and I made this to go with our Tday dinner and it was so simple and delicious. Next time, I'm going to add more green beans and less feta. Feta is so tasty, it actually tastes better when it's less pronounced.

Delicious!My family loved it!I used frozen green beans and cooked them 3 minutes,I also used only 6 oz.of feta cheese.Definately a keeper!

I made this dish because I had the ingredients on hand, and was amazed at how delicious it was. A great recipe for summer beans and tomatoes.

This was a wonderful dish! I added basil, and used fresh wax beans in addition to the green beans. Not only did the extra color add to the presentation, but a nice subtle flavor enhancement as well. A keeper for sure!

Yum! (I cooked the green beans for much longer than 1 minute -- thanks to my grandfather's frequent tastings and the comments of other cooks.)

Rating: 2
I didn't care for the green beans in this dish. Their flavor and crunch seemed to dominate the other ingredients too much and seemed out of place in this dish. I liked this much better after I picked out the beans. I may try this again and replace the green beans with something that will complement the other ingredients better.

Rating: 3
I wish I had read everyones reviews about cooking the green beans longer b/c I also didn't like them as crunchy. However, the meal is awesome! I will be able to eat on it for a few days (since I cooked it for myself). So easy and quick. Also, I used fresh basil instead of parsley and thew in an extra clove of garlic. Delicious!

My husband and I both loved this dish! We love meatless meals and this was very filling. Next time I make this I will not cook the tomatoes as long, just enough to warm them. Enjoy!

This is excellent. I also did not cook my tomatoes and instead of white wine vinegar I used seasoned rice vinegar. I can't wait to make this for company at a cookout.

Great summer BBQ side dish. Made things easy for myself by using a thawed 10 oz. box of frozen french cut green beans. Like my tomates raw, if being used for a cold salad. Followed another reviewer's lead, and used halved grape tomatoes.

Rating: 4
We loved this! It serves 4, however, not 2. And I used 1/2 cup feta instead of 1 cup. I also used grape tomatoes because the reg. ones taste awful here this time of year. I also cooked the beans for 3 min. - they were still crispy.

This dish is great, with lots of flavor! The only change I will make next time is to cook the beans about a minute longer -- I don't like them so crunchy.

Iuse couscous instead of orzo, very good. and I don't like cooked tomatos so I didn't cook them. I also used tomato basil feta lota of flavor.

I loved this light dish. The only change I made was to use about 1/4 cup chopped mint leaves instead of the parsley. It really made it special. (I also used a sundried tomato feta)

Wonderful recipe - I used peppercorn and sundried tomato feta cheese for a little extra flavor.
