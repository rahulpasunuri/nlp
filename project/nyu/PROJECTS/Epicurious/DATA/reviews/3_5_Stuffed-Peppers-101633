This was the first time I've ever made stuffed peppers....read the reviews and followed the recipe except replaced zucchini with cooked wild rice, used chicken sausage which I browned with onions and garlic and added 2 small cans of italian style tomato sauce ... and used the food processor for the stuffing...this was SOO GOOD!! Not greasy and there is nothing left...this is a keeper...

This is good with some tweaking. I added some ground beef and used spicy turkey sausage. I browned the sausage and beef together first and set the meat and juice aside. I added the remaining ingredients as listed and added crumbled feta. I would recommend next time blanching the peppers so they are very tender when the cooking time is complete, i did only bake for 50 mins since i pre cooked the meat. I added some garlic salt and red peppers flakes to the mixture as well. It was delicious.

This was a good recipe for stuffed peppers. I followed the recipe loosely as I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand. I browned ground beef, added seasoning--pepper, salt, oregano, garlic and Italian seasoning. Then I added some cooked rice leftover from last night's meal, fresh breadcrumbs and the egg. I also stirred in a half cup of shredded cheese and some jarred Whole Foods pasta sauce. I put the peppers in boiling water for about 1-2 minutes to cut down on the baking time. Baked the peppers for 30 minutes and everyone (including the kids) loved the meal. I realize I totally changed the flavors of the dish, but that shows how versatile this recipe is. I will make this again!

I love stuffed peppers. This is a good recipe. I also made a Greek version that only about 200 calories a pepper. So good and so filling. We eat them once a week. Posted here ellebeaugrease.blogspot.com

Very tasty. Took the advice of other reviewers - mixed in orzo (subst 1/2 of zucchini), added spice - garlic, basil, fennel seeds, and crushed red pepper - to ground chicken (instead of sausages). Cooked chicken before stuffing. Added both Parmesan cheese and Monterrey jack cheese to stuffing. Left out egg by accident. Stuffed baby peppers, zucchini, and baby squashes. Yum!

I made a vegetarian version of this as a side for dinner with a picky friend of mine (who eats meat), and he loved it. Baked in 15 minutes. I halved the recipe and used 10-12 Morning Star breakfast sausage links instead of real sausage, cut out the salt, used one whole egg for the half recipe, and used halved, firm tomatoes instead of peppers. The tomatoes don't require blanching, and bakes fast on a rack at the top of the oven, without turning the tomatoes to mush. Really great flavor -- meaty but still not too heavy, and the spices give it a subtle something.

I am very glad I read other reviews and made some modifications. My husband (meat & potatoes guy) & I both enjoyed our modified dish! My modifications: I omitted the zucchini and substituted Orzo. I followed other reviewers' recommendations and browned the Italian sausage in a skillet prior to adding to stuffing mixture. I cut oven baking time in half (30 mins rather than 1 hr). Rather than plain bread crumbs, I used Italian seasoned (if you do this you may want to cut back somewhat on additional seasonings). I topped the stuffed peppers with crumbled feta cheese and Roasted Garlic tomato sauce (added sauce to bottom of baking dish as well). I think the sauce addition was very necessary. It likely would have been dry and slightly bland without the sauce. Next time I intend to try goat cheese instead of feta and I think it will be perfect. Definitely improvise and tailor this recipe to your tastes and it will turn out wonderful. Makes a nice presentation as well!

Turned out great, and the amount of stuffing matched the volume of the peppers, which always seems to be a problem with 'stuffed' recipes. I like the zucchini replacing rice/grain that I typically use. It melts away more into the sausage. I used a sweet chicken sausage, which turned out well, but would use a mild-med spicy sausage next time.

I love this site because the option is there to follow the recipe exactly or to cull through the reviews and modify it to your own palate...often I use the original recipe but tweak it to my own preferences, so to the naysayers out there: isn't that the joy of cooking,learning and experimenting? That said: I don't waste food and use up ingredients so my stuffing consisted of crumbled dark rye bread crumbs, sweet onion, shredded zucchini, (which I let stand with salt first and squeezed the excess water out of), leftover brown and wild rice, fresh parsley, one large garlic clove, I egg, and a two chorizo sausage which I had previously cooked off..seasoned with red pepper flakes, salt and pepper and parmesan...spread a little fire-roasted tomato sauce in the pan and drizzled it sparingly on top before baking. PERFECT!

This is not what we thought it would be! I made this according to the recipe along with rice and a salad and my boyfriend and I thought it taisted off. Maybe the addition of the egg? maybe not enough bread crumbs? I dont know what it was but this won't make it another round in our house!

Out of necessity I made this with adjustments... very quick and yummy. I used yellow squash and let it sit in a colander with salt after grating. I squeezed out the liquid before mixing with other ingredients. I used extra breadcrumbs, a bit of olive oil, pre-cooked spicy kielbasa cut into quarters and low-fat feta cheese. I made 1/2 the recipe (2 peppers). I microwaved them for a couple minutes then cooked in a toaster oven on 450 for just under 20 minutes.

These were good but they needed more salt. There just wasn't much going on flavor-wise.

This is an absolutely delicious recipe. I used hot italian turkey sausage instead and browned the meat first, therefore not requiring as long to bake and the peppers stayed slightly crisper which I like. Otherwise, no changes and I didn't notice excess liquid. Even my meat-and-potatoes husband loves this one.

Rating: 4
Very good. I made it as written with 2 minor changes: 1) I ladeled a little bit of tomato sauce (Lidia Bastianich's recipe from this site) in the bottom only of the baking dish before putting the peppers in, and 2) I browned the sausage in a pan, drained it and then ran it through the food processor to break up the chunks before mixing with the rest of the stuffing ingredients - this gives a very nice, light texture to the filling. I baked it covered with foil for the first 1/2 of the cooking time to make sure the peppers would get done & it didn't dry out (because the sausage was already cooked.) I served it on a bed of fresh corn last night & got good reviews from my guests.

This recipe turned out pretty well, but I think it has a lot to do w/ the sausage you use--make sure to use a brand you know you'll like. A tip to get rid of some of the excess liquid: mix the shredded zucchini with the salt in a colander and let sit for half an hour or so--this extracted a lot of liquid when I tried it (squeeze out extra before adding to mixture).

Instead of port, used ground veal/beef. added: 1/2 cup freshly shredded manchego 1/2 cup freshly grated romano to the pan: 1/4 cup EVOO 4 tbsp. Sicilian Gravy (also drizzled on top of peppers) 3/4 cup water Also, Pepper tops were reserved and placed on top minus the stem. A wedge of red onion inserted into pepper top hole. Served with hot Sicilian Gravy. A Delicious basic recipe that can be altered many ways to suit the taste. A great starting point.

I made some major changes, but the result was great. I kept the zucchini, red onion, parsley and rosemary. I used ground turkey and added poultry seasoning, some garlic poweder and red pepper flakes the egg and breadcrumbs. I did not drain the zucchini or poke holes in the peppers. I baked it at 375 for 55 minutes and it turned out moist and delicious.

Rating: 2
This dish was okay. I followed the recipe as is minus the egg and used ground beef instead of sausage. As other reviewers have suggested, I poked holes in the bottom of the peppers to allow it to drain. Next time I think I will cook the peppers a bit before baking in order to soften them. Also perhaps adding some diced tomatoes and browning the meat with a little garlic beforehand will improve it.

Rating: 3
After reading the other reviews, I squeezed the shredded zucchini to reduce the amount of water, used turkey Italian sausage (which I cooked ahead of time), and added cooked barley. Also tossed in a little leftover tomato sauce. It was delicious. It's a great recipe to use as a guide and then make your own changes.

These are the best-stuffed peppers I have ever had. I used two zucchinis and didn't think there was too much moisture at all, but I used my cusinart to shred the zucchini and the texture was PERFECT!! I also used the cusinart to make whole-wheat breadcrumbs and used chicken sausage - light and healthy.

Amazing, with these changes: Sweet italian turkey sausage, Baby spinach - half bag chopped, Tube ritz crackers- crushed, Finely mintzed red onion, dried rosemary(1 tbsp), italian seasoning(1 tbsp), black pepper(1 tsp), 1.5 c italian cheese mix, Half can campbell's tomato soup (to top, pour on just before baking). Only used 3.5 red peppers.Topped with campbell's tomato soup before baking. Not too soggy, not too dry. Perfect after an hour. Also, prepared night before. Could be made and frozen, I imagine. Note: I think that zucchini in this recipe is a terrible idea... TOO much water.

Rating: 2
This recipe was just ok. I used half sweet and half spicy Italian sausage meat. I felt the stuffing was too meaty and not bready enough. If I made again I would use homemade breadcrumbs and replace some of the meat with breadcrumbs. One suggestion for the zucchini - you have to squeeze all the moisture out of it after you grate it. Just take handfuls and squeeze out the water. This goes for anything with grated zucchini. I poked holes in the bottom of the peppers as suggested. Was tasty, but not exceptional. I cut up the leftovers and put it in pasta with tomato sauce, which was very good.

I was disappointed by this recipe. I watched over the peppers, placed holes in them to drain and tilted out the excess water that developed. But still the taste was off. My kids would not eat them, my husband liked them as left overs

I really didn't like this at all, however I did make a huge change. I had ground turkey on hand so I seasoned it with italian sausage seasoning (herbs, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, fennel seeds), which, by itself, tasted quite good. I prepared the rest of the recipe exactly as written and it seemed like it was going to be delicious, but it was really quite gross. The flavor was just totally off. I really don't think that it would have been much better if I had used prepared italian sausage whether turkey or pork. In fact, that would probably make it too rich. Unfortunately, I'm not going to make this one again.

Loved the moistness of the end result. I used turkey sausage that I cooked first as well as cooking the onions and zucchini mixture. Added just a bit of grated fresh parmesan to the mix as printed. Coated the peppers with an olive oil and balsamic mixture and roasted on the grill before I filled them. I still put in the oven for the stated time and temperature with a topping of parmesan cheese. They were the most flavorful and moist stuffed peppers I ever made. Will definitely make more often than just once a year the old rice and ground beef way.

After reading all the previous reviews, my husband and I altered the recipe a little and came up with some winning results. Since the zucchini is high in water content, we susbstituted broccoli florets in one batch and drained recipe cut tomatoes in another. We used Polish sausage and it gave the mixture a real nice beefy flavor. We didn't have any croutons so we substitited cooked basmati rice. We also mixed in parmesean cheese and then sprinkled a little on top right before popping in the oven. I had lots of Italian parsley in the garden so we diced some up and used it for flavoring instead of onion. W*O*W! We ended up with a bunch of stuffed peppers and they were even more delicious as leftovers. Would definitely make this again. Turned out perfect both times.

I used ground beef instead of sausage. Everyone at my Mexican lunch party loved it. The zucchini makes it very light tasting and non-greasy. Unfortunately it also makes it a bit watery. If making with beef it needs a little more salt and perhaps a few red pepper flakes to give it a little kick. Otherwise this is another winner!!!

I used half bell peppers and half poblanos because that is what I had in my fall garden. I also used grey squash from a local Hispanic market and eggbeaters in place of the eggs. It turned out very good. I sprayed the peppers with olive oil cooking spray instead of using real olive oil to cut calories, and I sprinkled liberally with shredded parmesan, as suggested by other reviewers. A nice recipe and a nice way to use garden produce.

i may be relatively new to the kitchen, but this was my greatest success so far. it was wonderful, flavorful, light. i made a few small changes to the recipe which turned out surprisingly well. i used ground turkey instead of sausage. before mixing with the other ingredients, i browned the turkey with just one clove of garlic, as a previous user suggested. great. second, i sprinkled some olive oil on the pepper halves before putting them in the oven. this worked great for keeping the moisture in. and finally, i added a little shaved pecerino on top of the peppers right before i served. put it all on a bed of sauteed spinach. it was excellent.

I liked this and I would make it again, but I think it needs a sauce for moisture. I had a little too much topping left over, so I hollowed out a remaining zucchini and filled that, which worked fine. Next time I'll make a simple marinara or something to go with it.

This was a huge hit with everyone that ate it. I made a double portion, and I used a mix of venison Italian sausage and pork mild and pork spicy Italian sausages. I also made an asiago cheese cream sauce to pour over them, and that really added the perfect touch to me. I'll definitely make these again.

I took the other reviewers' advise and browned the sausage. After it cooled a bit, I pulsed it a few times in the food processor to make a finer consistency. This made mixing the remaining ingredients very easy. Stuffed each pepper half, topped with a little bit of marinara sauce and freshly shaved asiago cheese. Excellent!

Fast and easy to make. Definitely needs some modifications. Stuffing was too high density for my taste--like one large lump of sausage. Next time I would add more zucchini and onion, to try to alter the texture. I would also follow the suggestion of using turkey sausage to cut the grease and overpowering sausage flavor. Poking the pepper is a must, to drain the liquid. I hadn't seen the suggestion and ended up having liquid flooding the plates.

A combination of ground turkey and Italian sausage made this unctuous enough to satisfy but far less greasy than 100% pork sausage. My husband thinks he hates stuffed peppers, but he loved these. I, too, served on a bed of steamed spinach (great color), along with some roasted cauliflower and a slice of olive bread. Another keeper.

A good standby winter dish. I too used hot italian sausage - a nice touch is to roast the peppers on the top of the range (until blackened then put in paper bag - then scrape method) that gives them even more of a sweet taste and enhances this dish. I like the idea about poking a few holes in the bottom too. great dish

These were delicious, and it sure looked like Christmas at our house!! (Served them on top of beds of wilted spinach--very pretty.) I pre-cooked the sausage to get rid of as much grease as possible, added extra zucchini, used dried parsley and rosemary, and canned Italian bread crumbs. Omitted the salt. Added some extra sharp cheddar cheese on the top of each one during the last few minutes of baking. They turned out extremely juicy (not greasy), as most of the zucchini and onion disintegrated. Next time I would chop the onion less fine, and chop (rather than grate) the zucchini into about 1/2-inch dice, and also add a bit of pre-cooked rice to absorb the juices. Very, very yummy, esp. the red bell peppers. (I don't think I will ever stuff green peppers again!!!)

Many reviewers have mentioned the fat in the dish. The sausage should be crumbled and cooked enough to render fat before it is incorporated into the stuffing mixture. The cook can render all the fat or just some of it. I believe that pre-cooking the sausage is standard--I have found the direction to do so in, for example, Williams-Sonoma recipe for stuffed pepppers, and in recipes from Marcella Hazan among others. The set of reviews here shares the general flaw of review sets on this site: many are not about the recipe, but about a variation decided upon before actually trying the recipe. The reviews from people who have actually followed the recipe or have enough cooking experience to anticipate what's wrong or weak before following it are the most helpful.

My boyfriend and I just happened to make an approximation of this recipe with just what I had on hand, and I looked up "stuffed peppers" to be sure of the cooking time. I found this recipe, which is pretty close to what we did. We used onion, garlic, mushrooms, eggs, bread crumbs and sweet Italian sausage (organic, from our local farmer's market), and added some leftover spaghetti sauce and worcestershire. We sauteed the onion, garlic and mushrooms in olive oil with a little red wine before mixing them in to the meat. We topped the peppers with a dollop of the spaghetti sauce and freshly grated Parmesan. They turned out great. Just be sure to follow the advice of others and poke those holes in the bottoms for the fat to drain.

This sounded like a good low-carb stuffed pepper recipe with zuchinni instead of rice. But I made it with 1 lb. of turkey breakfast sausage in an attempt to make it even lighter, and it was only OK. As one reviewer noted, using a good sausage is probably key. With only 1 lb. of sausage instead of the 1.5 called for, the stuffing filled the eight half peppers perfectly. And it cooked fine in one hour as written. I did put a hole in the bottom of each half but not much came out.

I think this a nice change of pace from the usual stuffed pepper recipe of ground beef and rice. I've made this version a few times and have come up with a recipe that works for me (lower calorie, more veggies, but still tasty). I stuff the peppers with spicy turkey sausage, cubed/deskinned eggplant, shredded zucchini, egg beaters, bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, 1 can of chopped tomatoes, parsley, onion, pepper, salt, garlic, and other italian seasonings. I cook the peppers in a pool of tomato sauce and then pour the sauce over each pepper before serving. Like the other reviewers, I poked holes in the bottom of each pepper (this really helps to drain the water). My husband and his friends love this meal and we are always excited to eat the leftovers for lunch.

This a a great recipe for stuffed peppers - since this recipe appeared in 1999 it has become a standard in our house - especially this time of year when peppers are abundant at the market. I have also used this recipe to cook the peppers on the bbq (on foil) which isn't as easy but doesn't heat up the kitchen. Whip up some mashed potatoes and a mesclun salad and enjoy a great meal!

At the market yesterday the cubanelle peppers looked delicious. So I bought them and then sought out a way to prepare them. I didn't use rosemary or sweet Italian sausage (the grocery didn't have it!) Therefore I substituted a sage laced one - it was great!

Delicious. I prepared the peppers almost as above, including some leftover cooked rice. I couldn't imagine stuffed peppers without a sauce so I baked them in a pan with Italian-style stewed tomatoes. The sauce did end up very oily from the sausage. Next time I will partially bake them, remove the grease, then add the stewed tomatoes and see how well that works.

I make this often but with lean turkey sausage with hot Italian seasoning. There is no problem with any excess grease. Also I add 1/4 teaspoon or so of hot pepper flakes and serve with a tomato sauce that I make on stove top from a can of chopped tomatoes and I add some basil. Just before serving I drizzle a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil over each pepper. Do check with a thermometer - it doesn't always take an hour and overcooking causes dryness. Reheats great with the tomato sauce in the microwave.

Rating: 2
I had the opposite problem from everyone else in that the peppers turned out very dry. Maybe it's because I used low-fat turkey sausage which produced almost no grease. Even so, the flavor was pretty bland. If I ever did make these again, I'd use full fat greasy sausage and/or add a tomato sauce of some kind. All in all, I wasn't impressed.

I would definately make this recipe again. It is incredibly easy--especially since you don't have to cook the meat before stuffing. Once stuffed, you can just walk away for an hour! I added a bit of parmesan cheese, and topped with a little bit of shredded cheddar. Otherwise, made the recipe exactly as listed. I took the advice of other reviewers and poked a few holes in the bottom. When cooked, there seemed to be a bit of oil/water (from zucchini) in the peppers. All I had to do was press down slightly with a fork, and all the moisture oozed out of the holes. I therefore had absolutely no problem with it being greasy--and I really dislike greasy food. It was perfect! I served it as a main dish, with nice crusty bread and a salad. Despite it's long cooking time, I like it for a weeknight meal because of the simplicity. From shredding the zucchini to stuffing the peppers, it only took me about 10 minutes. I just popped it in the oven, poured a glass of wine, and waited for the hubby to come home!!

Very good versatile recipe. I used rice instead of zucchini as I didn't have any zucchini on hand. I also used fresh basil and parsley, garlic, parmesan cheese, shallots instead of red onion and extra bread crumbs to absorb the oil. I think it would be better with tomato sauce at the bottom of the pan and maybe some pignolia nuts.

Ok, reading the reviews I made some modifications. First, to cut down on the grease use a pound of sausage and increase the zucchini and the bread crumbs. Also instead of red onion use green onion. And please, invest in good sausage it make a BIG difference.

Like many others before me, I put my own twist on this version of a family favorite. I did cook the sausage and zucchini (and garlic) first, but the meat was too chunky, so I put it through the grinder and into a sieve over a bowl. This took care of the greasy problem. Then I happened to have almost a cup of ricotta cheese in the frig. so I tossed that in and I ALWAYS put corn kernals (about a cup for this recipe)in Stuffed Bell Peppers.

I also poked a couple of small holes in the bottom of each pepper with a wooden skewer and placed the peppers on a broiling pan so the fat would drain away. I served with Fregola (Sardonian pasta) and a delicate tomato-basil sauce. I will definitely make these again.

I cut the recipe in half and made a few changes suggusted by previous reviewers (added mushrooms, topped with italian diced tomatoes and mozzarella, and subtracted the rosemary). The dish was delicious and the half batch of stuffing easily filled 6 half green peppers. Next time I plan on using the red peppers called for in the recipe and cutting down on the sausage and added more onion and garlic. When served over rice with a nice side salad, an over all excellent meal that I will definitely make again.

I used banana peppers from a friend's garden and used hot italian sausage so I didn't add the rosemary and also some grated parmesan...I loved the idea of grating a zucchini into the meat mixture as we had lots of that from the garden as well. I thought these turned out great. I covered the bottom of the baking dish with some tomato sauce which was great spooning over them after they were baked. The sauce definitely had some of the pepper flavor, which by the way, the peppers really mellowed after baking. I had no leftovers and everyone raved about this dish.

This dish was excellent! I halved the entire recipe except for the bread crumbs and egg. Instead of rosemary, I used about 3/4 tsp dried italian seasoning and added a garlic clove, minced. Also, we had Asiago cheese on hand which I freshly grated and I topped each pepper with same. My fiance devoured them. (Previous reviewers mentioned a grease problem--there was really hardly any grease in my batch.)

This recipe was very easy, tastes great, and also looks beautiful on the plate. I added some basil, used dried parsley because I didn't have any fresh on hand, and sprinkled a little parmesan on top. I was a little horrified with the amount of fat, even though I used low-fat sausage. Next time I may try to duplicate the sausage taste with ground turkey and spices.

Not the best thing I've ever tasted, but good. Next time I will pick and choose from among the suggestions listed here; adding garlic, cheese and tomato sauce are terrific ideas as is poking holes in the bottom of the peppers to drain the fat. I thought of that but was afraid they'd fall apart. Served with Pea Soup w/Tarragon; a recipe that I found at this site as well. Pretty as a picture and tasty!

A tasty dish with green peppers too. Kept well for future reheating. I'd definitely make this again.

I used just what I had in the house, so I variated from the recipe somewhat. I used ground turkey instead of sausage and I didn't use the zucchini. I also added tomato sauce and tomatoes on top of the peppers and added mozzarella chesse. It was delicious! I used one green pepper and one red pepper and stuffed the entire mixture in them. I served them over white rice. I think next time I will deleate the rosemary because I'm not a huge fan of it. Overall, it was good and I'd make it again. Very filling as well.

I used spicy turkey sausage instead of traditional sausage and added 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese. Everyone loved it.

Very easy and great for dinner parties. I've received nothing but rave reviews! (Next time will take advice of cook from Bethesda and poke holes in bottom to drain fat.)

Received rave reviews about this dish. Would make again.

This recipe was really good. I added mushrooms and parmesan cheese. I didn't add the full amount of bread crumbs and it still was wonderful. It's a nice change from the regular rice, beef and tomato stuffing.

Tasty alternative to the typical stuffed pepper. I liked to use a really spicy sausage in this mixture and it really makes the pepper come alive!

The peppers were delicious. Lovely presentation, too. I changed the recipe a bit by doubling the bread crumbs and adding fresh mushrooms (chopped) and plenty of parmesan cheese. Next time, I'll cut down on the sausage, and I'll keep it in the oven for more than an hour.

Simple, yet very good. Very provincial. A great change from the ubiqutious burger stuffed pepper in tomato sauce. The potential high fat content had me worried, but the recipe can be worked to render away most of the excess fat. It is a great base recipe to tinker with too. For those of us who garden, it is great to find a delicious recipe that uses both peppers and zuchini!

I forgot I didn't rate this. OMG It is wonderful! I usually hate bell peppers cooked, unless in stir fry, and I REALLY don't like zuccini, but I made this for a change for my husband, and oh my goodness, I loved it.....he loved it even MORE! I apparently printed it and gave it to a friend, THEY loved it, and never gave me the paper back, so I had to come back and find it to make again for tomorrow! lol We used green the last time, I'll probably try the red tonite for a that beautiful red color, and sweet taste! Thanks!

I used turkey sausage and took Bethesda's advice for poking holes in the peppers so the fat could drain. Next time I make them, I'll try a little tomato sauce & mozz cheese on top.

This is one of my favorite recipes. The whole family loves it and is easy to prepare. I use lower fat turkey italian sausage and add a little lowfat cheese to the mixture before baking. We enjoy this as a main course with a garden salad and a basic risotto to round out the meal.

I prepared this with one pound of very lean, ground sirlion (brown and drained) instead of the sausage. I took it to a gourmet dinner with a French theme and it was heavenly. The red peppers tasted roasted instead of baked. Try it!

Very good. Taking the advice of previous reviewers, I added garlic and herbs. Also, I used whole, small peppers. Then I poked 2-3 holes in the bottoms, and cooked on a broiler pan so that the fat/grease could drain through. Finally, topped with a sprinkling of cheese during last few minutes.

I thought this recipe was easy to make and tasted good. I found the peppers to be a little greasy because of the fat from the sausage, but perhaps I did something wrong. My husband liked them a lot, but I probably wouldn't make it again due to the residual fat after baking.

I made this dish exactly how this recipe SAID to and it was divine! It tastes fantastic and the smell of rosemary through the house makes you glad that you're ALIVE.

No need to parboil the peppers first. I was concerned, but they were juicy, sweet and soft but firm enough to hold the deicious stuffing. All of us came back for more.

My family doesn't care too much for the rosemary so I deleted that and added a sprinkle of cajun spice on the top. It was excellent!

Very easy to make and delicious. In a separate saucepan I heated two cans of whole tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce to spoon over the peppers. Yummy!

Nice easy green pepper recipe. I used green peppers (because I had them from the garden) and added garlic.

I personally don't like peppers, but I made it for hubby for his birthday and he thought it was delicious. It is very colorful too, which makes a nice presentation.

This was one of those dishes that I made just because the picture in the magazine looked so good. Everyone at dinner that evening loved it and went back for seconds.

This was a very easy and quick recipe. The stuffing would also be very good in zucchini boats or stuffed mushrooms. Great summer recipe for all of you zucchini growers! This was also a very pretty dish to serve. It's a keeper.

This receipe said that it served 8 as an appetizer (as listed in the index). My wife and I made the full receipe, using 1/2 of it for a main course. It was great with a simple veggie and salad. The remainder of the receipe was fabulous in lunches.
