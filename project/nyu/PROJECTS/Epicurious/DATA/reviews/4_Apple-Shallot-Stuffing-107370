I reviewed this a few years ago, but I had some additional comments. This is an absolutely fabulous recipe, but you really need to season it up. Put more allspice/nutmeg/salt/pepper than the recipe calls for. I didn't have marjoram, so I used a bit of fresh thyme, which was lovely. The lemon zest is a nice touch. I put a bit more chicken stock since it seemed a little dry as I was stirring. Overall, wonderful recipe. Just don't hesitate to add more spices.

This is unbelievably good, and a really flexible recipe. I made a lot of substitutions, because I didn't have several of the exact ingredients on hand but really wanted to make a stuffing to fill some acorn squash halves. I used whole wheat sandwich bread (with crusts), Gala apples, raisins in place of currants, vegetable stock in place of both the chicken stock and apple cider, and leeks in place of shallots. And it was still incredibly good. Swearing-in-the-kitchen-after-I-tasted-it good. If you like apples, shallots/leeks and butter, you will enjoy this stuffing.

Excellent! Apple cider is hard to come by in Italy, so I used apple juice to reconstitute the cranberries (instead of currents). I also added some celery and cut back a bit on the shallots. Tasted great!! Even the Italians liked it!

I followed the recipe as written and used it to stuff a turkey. Before it went into the bird, the stuffing had a strange unpleasant taste. We suspect either the marjoram or the lemon. I went ahead and put as much stuffing as I could into the bird, and baked the extra in a dish. The stuffing that came out of the bird was delicious with no funny notes, but the stuffing that baked separately retained the odd flavor of the raw stuffing and was awful. I might make it again, but not with marjoram or lemon.

Wonderful! We were a little too hasty in taking it out of the oven, so it was a tad too moist for us. Otherwise, delicious. Unusual recipe.

Fabulous! Made this with crown roast of pork for Christmas dinner and it was quite a hit. Stuffed the center of the roast and baked the rest in a buttered casserole per instructions. Would not change a thing.

My family loves this stuffing. I substitute golden raisins for the currants but, other than that, follow the recipe. I have made this several times for family and friends and always gotten rave reviews.

I thought this was quite good. I would have liked the apple flavor to be more pronounced, but everything had a good balance. I soaked the currents in Calvados (apple brandy) but I don't think much of that flavor came through either. Maybe if I had used tarter apples, like granny smith, it would help (I used Braeburns). In any case, this was delicious. It was a good change from the sage flavored dressings, but still mild and simple enough to please the unadventurous grandmas in my crowd. I would certainly recommend this recipe. I made 1 1/2 times what the recipe called for, and it filled 2 9x13 pans. Our Thanksgiving of 13 people didn't even finish one pan worth, and it was our only starchy side dish, so I'd say it makes A LOT.

Did the cook who thought it tasted like sauerkraut use cider vinegar as opposed to apple cider? I can't see why the ingredients as they are would have ended up tasting so...sour.

This is one of the best stuffing recipes I have found. Everyone loved it!

Rarely give four forks but this one truly deserves it. By far, my family and I agree that this is the best stuffing ever. The currants really make a difference. If this recipe is made ocrrectly, there is no way anyone would "hate it". Try this and you will be pleased.

Everyone hated it, they said it tasted like sauerkraut, they wanted me to make stovetop. Gravy didn't even help to disguise the flavor. I was very disappointed in this recipe and would never make it again!!!Only if I were making a Ruben.

Yet another hit!!! This stuffing will be on my table again next year!!!

I rarely use the four-fork rating, but as stuffing goes, this was absolutely incredible. I made this recipe for the vegetarians attending our Thanksgiving dinner, but much to my suprise, it was a huge hit with everyone. I did make a few substitutions, but generally followed the recipe as directed. I used challah instead of whole-wheat bread and homemade roasted vegetable stock instead of giblet stock. (I also ended up needing quite a bit more stock than the recipe called for, but I prefer to serve dressing a bit on the moist side.) I also substituted dried cranberries for the currants. The cranberries gave the dish a beautiful splash of color, and I prefer their flavor to that of currants. The overall dish was absolutely fabulous, and I will definitely make it again!
