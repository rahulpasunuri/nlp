I've been making this since it first appeared in the magazine in 2002. Doesn't need any adjustments, great & easy weeknight meal that the adults & kids love.

Absolute comfort food for a cold night and easy enough for weeknight cooking. My whole family -- including 2 small children -- loves this dish. We do it a few times every winter and it's always good.

The flavor was very blah, possibly because I used dried sage instead of fresh and non-cream sherry. Also, the sourdough bread made the turkey taste like it was spoiled. Overall, way too labor intensive for so-so results.

The gravy was really good, although I had to wisk it over high heat for quite some time to get it to the right consistency.

This was better than I expected. I bought turkey scallops, then looked for a new recipe. Had all the ingredients, including fresh sage from the garden. Seemed logical. Had some leftover cornbread that had to be used, so served over that instead of sourdough. Excellent and easy.

Turkey Scallops is short for turkey scallopini which is a thin cut of breast meat.

Super easy, delicious comfort food. I used fresh sage and bought a boneless turkey breast and cut the scallops myself. I served this with the watercress salad with warm vinaigrette also on this site. My kids loved it! A definite repeater.

This is a great meal for a hurry up night,with class. (Works well with chicken breast also) With a salad is a perfect meal; Kids like it to--I serve them applesauce and they are quite content.

This is a very simple dish that comes out great every time you make it. CA doesn't have that bad of weather but any time it is cold out this recipe is on the table. Yummy

I made this on a hectic weeknight and it was great. My two young boys dont care for sandwiches so I served it over egg noodles and they LOVED it! This recipe is a keeper for sure.

We thought this was great! But we serve it over rice pilaf, and with a green salad.

I recommend a rosemary sourdough with this recipe; and the use of fresh herbs is a must. This dish is now a "house favorite."

This is nothing spectacular, but is really very quick and easy to make for a weeknight meal. We added some provolone cheese and served it over rye/pumpernickle bread.

Excellent for a weeknight meal. Did not have cream Sherry so I used regular Sherry and a bit of heavy cream. The sourdough bread is a must; really adds a unique flavor to the dish. My husband and I both enjoyed this.

I made this for dinner for my husband and I. It was just fine for a weeknight meal. Nothing special but easy and quick. I served it with the watercress salad as recommended. I used less butter and a lot more green onions. If you want the sauce thicker use less chicken broth or thicken it.
