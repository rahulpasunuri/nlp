This is wonderful and decadent! I go a little overboard by doubling up on the streusel topping. I've also substituted Blueberries with strawberries and it was just as successful. 5 stars!

If you haven't made this yet, please do! Love it I make it every summer with raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. For the almonds in the topping I use a cup.

I decided it was time to learn how to make a pie crust. As a beginner pie maker, I found this recipe appealing. Only one crust to worry about! The pie turned out wonderfully. Mines not as pretty as the picture, but tastes great all the same. I used about 3 cups fresh raspberries and 2 cups fresh blueberries. I did use the full cup of sugar and was very glad that I did. The filling was definitely tart (in a good way), not sweet. Like others, I kept an eye on the crust and covered the whole thing with foil. I think I covered mine about 20 minutes in& The filling bubbled up quite a bit during baking, so I was glad that I didnt use my little metal 9-inch pie pan. This recipe definitely requires a deeper pan.

The last time I made a fresh raspberry pie it was a soggy mess but other reviews encouraged me to try again and I am SO glad I did! Made this for a patio dessert with friends and it was PERFECT. The consistency of the filling was just right (I used all fresh berries and just slightly less sugar)and the crust was great (a little crispy using a ceramic pie plate and next time I would give it 5 - 10 minutes less time). Ground the whole almonds in a coffee grinder and cut in the rest of the ingredients with a pastry blender as I don't have a processor. I will definitely be making this all summer!

After all the rave reviews, I was really disappointed in my raspberry pie. As suggested by many, I cut the sugar in half, added a few more berries and 1 more tablespoon of tapioca. The pie was too tart (and I like tart) and too solid - not at all juicy. The berries were fresh and delicious, so I'm thinking they weren't the problem. I also wasn't crazy about the streusel topping. This was too much work for this kind of result. I won't make it again.

I'm not a pie baker....but this was the best I've had! I have made it several times now with rave reviews. I used raspberries, blueberries and blackberries (a little more than 5 cups), cut the sugar in half and added about 1 Tablespoon of tapioca. AMAZING!!! You won't be disappointed.

This turned out perfect. I think I've finally found my go-to berry pie recipe. I did use store bought crust so I can't comment on that part, but the filling was perfect. I used thawed frozen berries and reserved the juice, and it worked fine. You won't be disappointed with this recipe!

Amazing. . . Amazing. . Amazing. I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I did use less sugar. Per some reviews which was great advice. And since sugar is a thickener I added one extra tablespoon of tapioca. One of my favorites. . . and crust was amazing.

I used mostly ollalieberries (a sweet blackberry). I made it without the bottom crust and it was great with vanilla bean ice cream. a little too sweet maybe - I'll use less sugar next time.

Great berry pie recipe. I didn't add the sugar since it just didn't seem to need it. Used 1/4c applesauce and some fresh orange juice instead (from one orange). Came out plenty sweet. Recipe is also easier to make (and healthier) if you skip the bottom crust. Still tastes great.

Rating: 4
Excellent. I wanted to use some strawberries, blueberries, and cherries that were hanging around my fridge. I was short on granulated/quick tapioca so I took the pearls and ground them in a coffee grinder and it worked fine. I used less sugar in the filling (3/4C) because my fruit was sweet and ripe. I'm glad I did because the pie was still pretty sweet. I added a pinch of fleur de sel to the fruit. It was PERFECT!

even though this pie took a decent amount of prep work, it turned out to be one of the best pies i've ever made. i did not use fresh berries, instead used frozen and it came out fantastic. got lots of compliments on the pie when i took it to share with co-workers! yum!

If you use tapioca make sure and let them sit properly or they will be waaaaay too crunchy. I don't know if I will use the tapioca next time. But the flavors in this dish is extremely wonderful.

The best of crust recipes! I use this crust for all of my pies and get rave reviews!

This is a great recipe and very adaptable. I used a store-bought pie crust, which was fine (no doubt homemade would have been better). I used 2 cups blueberries, 2 cups raspberries and 1 cup blackberries. I added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of additional tapioca because my raspberries and blackberries were a bit overripe; this worked very well. My topping was slightly soggy, but I think this was because I ground it too fine--watch that! The interesting thing about this pie is that I thought it was so-so at first, but after two days the flavor improved tremendously, to the point that it was picked out by friends as the winner over another fresh-baked fruit cobbler.

Rating: 3
I thought this recipe called for way too much sugar. I used about 1/2 the amount (for topping and filling) and it tasted great. Also, when making the topping I recommend blending the dry ingredients first before adding the butter, allowing the almonds to get chopped first.

Rating: 4
made this for a wedding shower and it was a hit! used a combination of strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries. there's a reason for the tall standing crust - i used a somewhat shorter dish than normal and my filling exuberantly baked over the top! next time i'll use a taller pie dish.

Rating: 3
I used half raspberries and half blackberries. I also cheated and used a frozen deep dish pie crust. I covered the pie with foil halfway through baking and the top came out perfect. The next time I make this, I'll add a little more tapioca. I used 1/4 c., but the raspberries were very ripe and juicy, so they really broke down. And I was so excited to try it that I probably cut into a little too early. The pie felt cool, but that first slice was really runny. It was firmer the next day. And since this combo was tart, it tasted great with vanilla ice cream.

I have made this a couple of times this summer. It is a new family favorite! Must cool befor serving or too runny.

One more thing I forgot to mention: streusel toppings on fruit pies are the best. The streusel absorbs those great juices and the top of the pie looks professional.

Blueberry pies taste even better if you add the tiniest pinch of ground cloves - just enough to give the pie a flavor that is different but utterly delicious. But don't overdo the cloves!

This recipe is wonderful. I have made it many times since published in Bon Appetit. It is a summer favorite at our house. I have always used 2 cups of blueberries and a combination of raspberries and blackberries for the rest. Using a deep dish pie pan I have not had over- runs in the oven. I make the recipe exactly as written and have never received anything but raves and almost always someone wants the recipe.

Rating: 4
How delicious. Everyone in my family loved this pie. A note to Mindy Adams from Tampa.... when the recipe calls for tapioca it does not mean tapioca pudding. Tapioca are little bead like things that thicken fruit pies. Using vanailla pudding would not thicken up your pie. Next time buy a box of tapioca and try that.

Rating: 4
I've been making this pie since the recipe first come out in 2002. It is the best and has turned into my signature pie in the summer. I use blueberries, raspberries and blackberries. Strawberries are too sweet and get mushy. Make it exactly as written and you can't go wrong. Don't overcook it and the berries won't turn into jam.

Rating: 4
this is my first pie EVER, i know, baby's first pie. and everybody loved it to peices. this recipe is absolutely fantastic. i didnt have almonds around so i use walnuts and hazelnuts in my topping instead and my topping still burned even though i turned the oven down to 350 and covered the pie, but that didnt stop it from being delicious. im actually making another one today, love it!

Rating: 2
I did not care for the taste of the pie- it tasted like strawberry jam. I used 1/3 cup tapioca as another poster suggested and not the 1/4 required by the recipe. There was too much tapioca and it soaked up any and all juice, which is why it tasted like jam to me. Next time I will use only the 1/4 cup required. I like the fruit pie fairly juicy, almost runny... I also added lemon zest to the filling.

Rating: 4
I cheated and used a frozen, ready-made crust. I also used vanilla pudding instead of tapioca. And I did fill it too much and it spilled over. The taste was out-of-this- world, but the filling was super runny. It would be perfect served in a bowl a la mode.

I made two of these last naight for a dinner party and almost everyone came back for seconds. It tasted excellent!!! I added cinnamon to the topping and to the filling. I used a mix of berries - half of them frozen. I also used 1/3 cup of tapioca and cut back on the almonds and added extra oats. It did take a long time, but is was way worth it! I absolutly loved the streusel topping and will probably use it on other pies. It was so good that I am going to make another one tonight... Very good recipe!

I did not love this pie, although the guests seemed to like it. I found it tasted too much like a thick jam and like another reviewer I thought the streusel topping tasted better unbaked right out of the food processor.

Great pie! I made a strawberry-rhubarb-blueberry mix (with more sugar, of course). I liked the crust, much better than store-bought. I also added cinnamon to the topping, and cinnamon and grated orange rind to the filling. Scrumptious, maybe the best pie I've ever had, and I love pies and make them often.

This turned out really well and was very easy to make. Have failed at other fruit pies but this filling was pretty perfect. I did turn the oven down to 350 for the last 15 minutes and next time will cover crust and streusel before they burn (which they both did) also added cinnamon and nutmeg to topping. Very good will make again for sure.

This turne out great. I have never had success with fruit pies but this one was a hit at dinner. I used store bought crust which was fine but next time I would cover the crust and only uncover it for the last 15-20 minutes and also start covering the streusel for the las 15 minutes too since that slightly burned..and that was turning the oven down to 350 after 40 minutes. All in all very tasty and easy. Will definitely make again.

i absolutly love love love this recipe. i found it when it came out in 2002 and have been making it since. it's a big hit and i get many requests for the pie. the only thing i've changed is strawberries for the blueberries. also, i've found doubling up on the topping is pretty tasty, like a big crumbly oatmeal cookie on top.

This is my new favorite pie recipe! I confess, I haven't tried the crust but the pie & topping are terrific! The pie sets up JUST RIGHT & the topping is delish! I've made it with the mixed berries and with just blue berries; fresh fruit or frozen, & it's always been great.

I have been making this pie for three years (having seen it in Bon Appetit many years ago) and it has never failed to disappoint. I use purchased pie does to cut down on the time to prepare as there is considerable waiting time between the various steps. You may add other berries but just be sure you have some raspberries or blackberries as they provide a great deal of juice that make this so wonderful.

This pie beat out the usual annual favorite at Thanksgiving last year in a group of foodies. And then delighted my mother at Christmas. I'm not one of those people who goes crazy over pies, but I thought this was sublime (if I do say so myself). Since berries are so rarified and expensive in the winter, I used about 2/3 frozen organic berries. It seemed just as fabulous. I don't think I scrimped on any other ingredients though...

Rating: 4
Awesome pie! But I did make some changes. First of all there was so much pie dough that I had enough for a top crust. I didn't want to waste it so I used that instead of the streusel topping. I also used two bags of Trader Joe's frozen "Very Cherry Berry Mix". I increased the tapioca to 1/3 cup and used balsamic vinegar because I didn't have any fresh lemon juice. Baked it in a deep dish pie plate and had no over-spill. The crust is wonderful, very light and flaky. I'll be making this again and again.

Rating: 3
45 minutes, but that was fine; probably let the extra juices from thawing soak up a bit. After the suggested cooling time, the pie was perfectly thick and cuttable without running, something many pie recipes I've made fail on. Streusel was nothing exciting, though...I liked the taste better when I sampled some from the blender than after baking. I would only make the streusel again if I felt too lazy to do the top crust, and with a Tenderflake crust like I used for the bottom, how lazy do you have to be? The filling was very good though. Obviously I can't review the crust recipe :-)

Overall, a delicious tasting pie. Used fresh organic blueberries, rasberries and blackberries from the farmers market. I've always topped pies this way, much easier than rolling out a perfect top crust and tastier too. I'll probably keep using tapioca in pies, but go back to my regular crust recipe.

After the rave reviews, I was a little disappointed. It was a tasty pie, but nothing spectacular. I would make it again but double the crust recipe and do a top crust, as the crust was the best part of the pie! (the streusel did not thrill me). I increased the tapioca to 1/2 cup as recommended by other reviewers. I used 6 cups of berries in a 10" deep dish pie plate, which was just the right size for the recipe--no spilling over. I will add a bit more sugar--was a little tart for my taste.

This pie was delicious! I will definitely be making it again. I cheated with the Pillsbury crusts like a few other reviewers. However, I used both of the crusts as a bottom crust. The result was a sturdy and flaky crust! I did not have any run over problems because I used a deep pie pan. I can't wait to make this again!

I would have to agree that although this pie was wonderful overall, I think that the topping (specifically the almonds), took away from the berry flavor. I love almonds and I love berries but I wonder if there are just too many almonds in this recipe. Next time I will use more oats and fewer almonds. Also, I took the advice of some others and used slightly more tapioca to increase the thickness of the fillng. The pie itself was outstanding though.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! not too sweet, not too tart. My in-laws are pie eaters, so I sneaked a peek around the plates at Easter. Every bite was gone, with many compliments. I had a bit of trouble with the crust falling apart, so I did some patching. It turned out great anyway. Believe it or not, i used a bag of frozen mixed berries from Costco (I thawed and drained in a collander), then threw in some fresh berries (strawberries) as well. I couldn't tell the difference, and it was a lot cheaper this time of year.

I've rarely had such a mess on my hands -- but it was a delicious mess! If I'd only used a deeper pie pan.... It's true that it takes a good while from start to finish, but only because of the long 'waits' between steps. The actual hands-on time wasn't bad at all. Unlike most people, I thought the topping sort of detracted from both the looks and the taste, even though I generally like streusel. But the filling and crust were both superb.

I used equal amounts of fresh blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries. It looked just like the picture. I followed amounts as given, and used a generous porcelain 9-inch plate which is slightly deeper than a Pyrex 9-inch plate. There was almost no spillage, but you could add 1T. more of the tapioca if you want no runniness at all. I do recommend prebaking the pie crust and keeping the fluted edges covered in a foil ring during all the prebaking (see Rombauer/1997 for the procedure in the "Prebaked Flaky Pie Crust" recipe). Then bake the pie as directed. The final crust was thoroughly cooked and slightly crunchy. Also, 2/3 of the crust recipe was adequate for my generous pie plate. I used the remaing 1/3 to line two 4-inch pie tins and popped them in the freezer for another day. A little vanilla ice cream on the side made this pie dessert just about perfect. It took more time than an "everyday pie," however.

I was challenged to make this recipe. I was invited to attend a dinner party and had to pick from various Bon Appetit recipes. I chose this one. I never bake or make any kind of desserts. I only cook what I call "real food"! So, I took the challenge. The only thing I didn't do was the crust, and I know real "foodies" would laugh at me, but I had a very busy day and I've never made crust before. The Pillsbury crust was fine, by the way. Anyway, the filling and topping weren't difficult, and here's the best part - IT TASTED FANTASTIC! Received raves from everyone. Was served with vanilla ice cream. Yum, Yum, Yum! While you're at it, make two. They'll disappear!

I am not much of a pie baker, but had to try this pie. It was UNBELIEVEABLE! Made for two separate dinner parties and everyone raved (they even raved about the crust which never happens for one of my pies). I used 8 cups of berries (rasp, black & blue) and 1 1/2 times the remainting ingredients for the filling in order to fill the pie (tall sides). The top seems like a lot when you're putting it on, but it's not too much. If you haven't tried this one, you really need to!

Wonderful. I regularly bake double crusted fruit pies and was looking for something a little different. The struesel topping browned up beautifully and was a deliciously crunchy contrast to the fruit. My favorite filling - about 80% blueberry and 20% rasberry; the latter adds a nice bite to the smoothness of the blueberries.

Excellent results -- perfect for lush summer fruit. Next time will return to my standard short crust which is less fussy. I used (and nearly double the specified amount for a deep-dish pie) strawberries, blueberries and blackberries and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup -- allowing the rich flavors of the fruit to emerge without unnecessary sweetness. Also found the streusel volume overwhelming and used less than half, maybe even a third. This will certainly become a summer regular --

I was a little intimidated by the looks of this recipe- topping, crust, filling- and i'd never used my food processor before. It was easy and completely delicious! It is a time-consuming recipe; to have for the evening it should be started in the early afternoon. I used fresh cherries, blueberries, and raspberries in a 9 inch dish and rolled the dough thin but there was extra dough. We only cooled it for 2 hours and ate it slightly warm; a little runny but delish!

I had only blueberries and used a 10" pie dish. I think 5 cups of blueberries would have been too many for a 9" dish. Also I had to bake the pie 15 minutes longer for the berries to bubble. The pie tasted great, so this must have been O.K. There is a lot of dough for a single crust pie so you end up with a thick crust but it tasted great. Also the thickening was just right.

The only fruit I had on hand was fresh cherries instead of the mixed berries suggested. It was absolutly fabulous. I made the crust, topping and pitted the cherries the day before. Assembled and baked the following day in the early morning to beat the heat. I omitted the lemon juice and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and used 1/4 cup of pie filling enhancer (can be found through the King Arthur Flour catalogue). It is a combination of sugar, instant clearjel, and asorbic acid. The streusel was a delicious crunch on top of the cherries. Will make this again prehaps in individual tart shells for a more elegant presentation.
