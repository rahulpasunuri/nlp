Not exactly the same thing, but I used Trader Joes artichoke salsa and it was a good change from traditional pizza sauce.

This was a good basic every-night-cooking dish. It was tasty and easy but I wouldn't serve it to company. I cut the oil down to 1 teaspoon and used reduced-fat sharp cheddar cheese to make it a smidge healthier.

I never thought this would work. But boy was I wrong...Arizona has never been closer to La Bella Italia!

This was delicious. I added some grilled slice chicken breast to the top before sprinkling on the cheese. I also used a boboli crust. Came out really good and I got rave reviews.

This pizza was quick, easy, and unusual. I used Desert Pepper Trading Company's "Roasted Tomato Chipotle Corn Salsa," and the corn was a particularly nice touch. The taste depends a lot on the salsa, so finding a good one seems key. I didn't much like the purchased crust, which I hadn't tried previously, but used because it was quick. I think I'd go back to my "standard" homemade pizza crust.
