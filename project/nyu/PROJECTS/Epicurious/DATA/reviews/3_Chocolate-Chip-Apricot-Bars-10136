I was looking for something to use up dried apricots - and this received decent reviews (it was eaten) but I wasn't thrilled. Based on the other reviews I added some cocoa powder to the flour mixture. It still needed something - vanilla powder maybe (so as not to add a wet ingredient). Also - the streusal fell right off...but it was pretty tasty overall.

I made this on a Friday and by Saturday they were all gone! I am definitely planning on making it again. I added more chocolate chips because we love chocolate!

The apricot filling was great, but the crumb topping and bottom were uninspiring and not too chocolatey. I am tempted to insert the filling between layers of brownies!

This was very easy to make but we found the results pretty uninspiring. There are plenty of better bar cookie recipes out there. I won't bother with this recipe again.

A great treat, I like to slightly overbake and get the fruit filling to carmelize a little. These can be cut into small bites as it is very rich. Both chocolate and fruit lovers will find something to enjoy here.

It was very easy to make and a big hit. I loved the balance of sweet and tart.
