I've been making this for several summers now. Perfect for picnics (no mayo!) and I usually make these on ciabatta = zero sog factor. There seems to be a bit too much salt in the spread for me (which says a lot - i love my salt!) so I usually start out with just a bit, then add more to taste (I usually also add a bit more heat, be it cayenne or chili powder or sriracha.) Other than that, the spread is a great alternative providing a nice creamy zip from the lemon/pepper combo. Oh, and I second (or is it third by now?) the vine ripened tomato comment. Overall a great summer sandwich with the bonus of being picnic friendly!

delicious, but I tried smoked salmon rather than turkey bacon...put less cayenne when using the salom and added a bit of Hellman's lite to the spread...yummy and yes, the tomatoes have to be vine ripened.

This was delicious and easy to make. I didn't mess with the recipe at all, and the spread was tasty and not too spicy. With turkey bacon it turns out great too. I've made this sandwich many times now, and it pleases everyone from senior citizens to a picky 11-year-old. So this is a great summer standby in my house.

Absolutely delicious! I brought them to a picnic and the avocado spread was thick enough that it kept the bread from getting soggy even after several hours in a cooler.

Excellent! And I did not find the spice to be a problem at all. It was very mild but I loved it! Equivalent to Taco Bell's "medium" hot sauce (in other words, not spicy at all.)

Not too spicy at all. Great with real bacon. Way better than mayo.

Try Roma tomatoes, they have less pulp. Also I have my own avocado tree in my back yard so we eat them often. Also try sliced turkey with cranberry sauce for dressing. I leave out the cayenne pepper. Jim

I also disagree with some of the reviews. I rather liked the avocado spread. It added zing to my sandwich, and was definetley better than mayo.

I am going to have to whole-heartedly disagree with the previous reviews. I love this blt, and have been eating it every summer since I first found it in my self magazine. I love spiciness, so I double the cayenne myself. If you like spice, this recipe is great. Sometimes I like to make it with turkey bacon, which is equally tasty. Just like any other BLT i would only recommend eating this when you have access to truly vine ripened tomatoes. There's nothing better than a tomato that smells like dirt!

Time for the horrible modification of the recipe: Leave the cayenne pepper out of the spread, it will destroy the woonderful (and expensive) flavor of the avocado. Also, and this is very important, halve the oil and add a tablespoon of low fat mayo, just this little bit will add a tang that doesn't add much fat but all the flavor in the world.

I can't pass judgment on the BLT, because the quality of that depends solely on the quality of ingredients used. I will say, though, that the avocado spread -- while an admirable attempt at a healthier condiment than mayo -- was a disappointment because it calls for WAAAAAAY too much cayenne pepper. I would cut the cayenne measurement in half, or maybe even just put in a quarter teaspoon depending on your tastes, and then it might be palatable. But still not as good as just plain slices of avocado on the sandwich. With mayo.
