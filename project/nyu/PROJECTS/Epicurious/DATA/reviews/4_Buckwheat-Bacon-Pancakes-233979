Buckwheat pancakes have been my favorite since I was young, and this is my go-to recipe. Since I rarely have buttermilk on hand,I freeze it in cup+ increments. It quickly reheats in the microwave at 50% power, stirring midway for about 6 minutes. I prefer my Canadian bacon on the side, but the combination of buckwheat and lean bacon is perfect.

Yum! These were very good. I substituted spelt for the all- purpose flour, melted butter for the vegie oil and blueberries for the bacon. I put in a whole bunch of blueberries. Yes, I agree...use pure maple syrup. When I am not cooking for my vegetarian daughter, I'll try it with the Canadian bacon. Well, maybe not as I loved them with the blueberries.

Kid approved! I made this to per the recipe except I used ham steak for the Canadian bacon and brown sugar instead of white. My 12 month old LOVED them, and they absolutely must be served with real maple syrup. I made extra to freeze.

I made this, using thin-sliced Polish smoked bacon instead. The results were fantastic. I have to admit, I didn't have high expectations, but was decidedly proved wrong. The recipe is dead-simple and will surprise your guests.

I've been trying to improve the healthiness of my recipes, and I chose this recipe to upgrade to buckwheat pancakes. I substituted whole wheat flour for the AP flour, and used 5 tablespoons of dry buttermilk (and added 1-1/4 water). It was exactly what I wanted, and very tasty. My husband and 12-year-old son both gave it a thumbs up, although my husband wants me to try adding vanilla next time. I also served the Canadian Bacon on the side, instead of adding to batter.
