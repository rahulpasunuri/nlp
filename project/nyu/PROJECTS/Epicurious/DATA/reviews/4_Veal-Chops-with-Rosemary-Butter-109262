INSANELY simple way to wow your dinner guests. I followed the recipe to the letter EXCEPT that I seared for 2 min per side, then moved the whole cast iron pan to a 450 oven for a few -- herbs did not char, and cooked to perfection.

This is delicious. I only marinated everything for about 20 minutes, and used smaller amounts of dried herbs, because this was a last minute decision and I didn't have fresh herbs, bnut it was really good none the less.

I too marinated it overnight and it was terrific. strong rosemary flavor. My chops were thick so i did 2-3 minutes per side on the stove then put in the oven at 450 (where potatoes were cooking) for 10-15 minutes. came out very juicy.

This was wonderful. The only change I would make is to the cooking time: 4 minutes per side was NOT too long for a 1 inch chop. Also, I quadrupled the amount of chicken broth and wine for the deglazing of the pan. (we like a lot of sauce, even with the compound butter.) The deglazed sauce packs a heck of a lot of flavor without alot of calories.

OMG! Fantastic. I put it in a ziplock baggie to marinate for a day & a half. Sooooo tender. My b/f said it was one of the best meals he'd ever had. That's a huge compliment!

Loved this recipe but found that 2 mins. per side was not nearly enough time; 4 mins. per side for 1" thick chops came out just pink. Placing on warm platter a must!

This one is a winner every time.

Love this every time. Served for 8 by searing in one pan and removing to warm platter and 300 oven before done. Then proceeded with sauce when ready to serve and addedded juice from platter when sauce finished. Reduced again and stirred in a bit of the cold compound butter with less on top. Guests raved.

This is by far the easiest and most delicious veal chop recipe I have ever made! With a little prep ahead of time, I was able to put this together with very little trouble. Fresh rosemary and thyme are a must.

Good. It is not fabulous but fairly easy and tasty.
