This is a favorite! My changes: I use a bottle of stout beer and a cup of beef stock for the braising liquid instead of water and use espresso strength coffee instead of regular. I use 1/2 the amount of garlic just for our taste. I sometimes add hominy or corn, green chilies, Mexican cheese, chopped cilantro, cumin, etc. to the polenta. I have substituted various dried chilies when ancho is not available. The taste is similar but would vary in heat (spicy) intensity.

This recipe had great depth of flavor and is definitely worth making again. One of those recipes which We will continue to tweek and will become a classic in our food repertoire. We halved recipe and found we needed to increase the liquid (coffee) and maple syrup (doubled). Perfect with sweet potato mash.

This recipe is a go-to of mine. It's deep in flavor and not very spicy. I have yet to meet someone who doesn't like it. It's awesome for a dinner party because you can make it a day or so ahead and rewarm it. As a matter of fact, we think it's even better if you do let it sit for a day. Awesome.

This dish is surprisingly not very spicy. I do make sure to go only slightly lighter on the peppers, for the children, but no complaints yet! And no leftovers either! This is definitely my very favorite Short Rib recipe. The flavors are subtle, yet well-balanced and satisfying. I serve this with a goat cheese & sweet potato mash, or just straight mashed potatoes.

I wish I wore gloves when cooking the sauce...they were hot! However, after the dish cooked, the flavor was good. There was a lot of fat though...definitely recommend cooking at least one day in advance.

Meh. Added extra coffee, lime juice and maple syrup per other reviews, otherwise followed reciped. Meat was very very tender but the sauce was definitely not that flavorful. Will not make again.

Thought I had rated this before - should have! I have been making since 2003 and it's always a winner! Such deep flavors! What more could you ask for - It's easy - perfect for company and great for a winter weekend dinner (the flavors fill the house - ummm). I try not to deviate, but don't worry about being so exact anymore. I do add Ancho Chili Powder - 4T, instead of soaking the chilies (easier to find the powder). Someone mentioned using broth instead of the liquid from soaking the chilies - trying that this time. Hope you enjoy as much as we do!

I combined this recipe with my favorite short rib recipe: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/13/dining/131mrex.html and the results were fantastic -the main thing that I did differently was swapping red wine for the lime juice and maple syrup. The techniques for the sauce were great and the cooking technique is great too. at 3.25 hours, the short ribs were perfect, and the prep was delightfully hands off once they ribs were in the oven.

No forks because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used 2 1/2 pounds of chunks of lean stew meat and reduced the water to 1 cup. I made the whole thing on the stove in a Dutch oven, and after about an hour and a half the meat was tender, but I had to leave the cover off of the pot to let the sauce reduce some more. The result: very easy, very tasty! The flavor of the sauce was nicely balanced - I wasn't sure whether it was a plus or minus that nobody could tell it had lime, maple syrup, or coffee in it.

Seven years later, still absolutely de-lish! First made this recipe on January 1, 2003. Tonight again followed the recipe as written. It was great meal for a cold, snowy night. As I noted seven years ago, if you don't like spicy foods or you easily get heartburn, this recipe might not be for you. The spices infuse the meat with a warming heat that doesn't overpower the tongue or throat but wonderfully showcases the ancho chili/coffee flavors. Me, I love it. I just can't believe it took me seven years to make it again. It's now on my winter recipe rotation! Love it.

Rating: 4
Would give it 3.5 forks if I could - very good recipe. Used a slow cooker in place of oven roasting, served over rice and black beans. Great flavor, ours turned out quite greasy but I blame the meat. Will try again with a leaner cut perhaps, and will definitely use broth in place of water for more flavor.

Rating: 4
Just great ... subbed pasilla chiles as out of anchos and reduced chipoltes down to 1 tblsp as guests aren't keen on too much spice. Easy to ramp up the heat by adding more chipoltes later. Out of real maple syrup so subbed 1 tblsp pancake syrup (I know, horrors but I was traveling and no syrup to be found!) and 2 tblsp dk brown sugar to compensate (dash of molasses, treacle, etc would work too). Cooked in a crock pot on high for 1st hour then reduced to low for 3-5 hours. I am a professional chef so love recipes like this that can serve as a base for fiddling with...you could add cinnamon, cumin, chocolate, raisins, ground nuts for a more mole type dish..or tomato paste and espresso for another version..possibilities are endless. Great with polenta, a mustard turnip/potato mash, a bean puree or even herbed potato cakes...Everyone loves ...Also very good served with a wet cornbread or spoonbread..As other reviewer noted, a lime crema is just the ticket with this.

While it's a bit time consuming, it's a great dish to make in advance. I used more coffee, more lime juice, more maple syrup, more chipotle in adobo sauce, more garlic, more onion, and an extra sprinkle of chili powder. I also had a couple of dried guajillo peppers in the pantry so I soaked those as well and added to the sauce. As long as you keep the pot tightly covered, there's plenty of sauce. Great dish for a dinner party.

These were fantastic. Beautiful, deep flavor, just spicy enough. My wife and daughter demanded that I add it to my "regular" file. The cook from Petaluma who gave it one fork is not bright: chipotle is MUCH stronger than ancho, so it's not suprising she found the dish too spicy. The liquid issue she complains about is easily solved by checking the pot every once in a while and adding stock as needed.

I made this for guests and got RAVE reviews!! I added 1/2 onion, 3 carrots, and 2 celery stalks to the processor and extra beef broth while cooking which gave us left over sauce which we used with pasta. I also added 1-2T powdered espresso for a stronger, but not overpowering, coffee flavor. It was absolutely wonderful and I'll make these again.

Move over traditional short ribs . . .these are even better. Some ingredients may be hard to find, but the search is well worth it. Cooking is my passion, but this recipe is a cinch. I served them over wide egg noodles instead of polenta and it was delish!

This and the pumpkin seed crusted rack of lamb with the chipotle sauce are my two favorite recipes on Epicurious. They are great for dinner parties and always get rave reviews. I sometimes can't get ancho chiles so if I don't have enough, I will sub in some pasilla or guajillo because they are roughly the same spiciness but you don't get the same flavor as ancho. It's worth the effort to search out anchos for this dish.

Rating: 4
Amazing! I'm not a super- experienced cook but this dish turned out great! This dish might be fairly spicy for those who aren't used to peppers but I live in Texas so not too much of a shock to my palate. I may use fewer peppers when I make it for friends who can't do spicy. I roasted my own poblanos/anchos and the dish still turned out well. The leftovers were even better the next day after the meat absorbed more of the flavor from the liquid.

Rating: 4
This was incredible! I braised the short ribs in a French oven for a few hours. I didn't have enough anchos, so I used some chile negro and some New Mexicos in addition to one or two anchos. Good balance between spicy and sweet. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 1
Disaster, subbed in dried chipotles for the anchos, used 6 boneless short ribs and used a covered dutch oven. After 3 hours there wasn't enough liquid left and the sauce was charred at the edges. Meat was tender though. Tasted terrible. Super spicy (i usually enjoy medium salsa) and bitter. Definitely don't use the chile water. I love short ribs so this was very disappointing. Polenta was good at least.

I was inspired to try this recipe because I love a similar recipe by Mark Bittman from the NY Times (less/different peppers, more coffee, red wine). After trying it straight once, I made some modifications that I found on the whole favorable: used a slow cooker on medium for six hours and fully immersed the meat, added a cup of red wine, dry pan toasted the peppers before soaking, subbed a Guajillo pepper (contra the cook from San Antonio del Mar, these are usually less sweet and spicier than Anchos, though YMMV), and doubled the garlic and the syrup. Reduced the sauce on the stove after cooking and then added it back overnight to separate and remove the fat. In the end, I preferred the subtlety of the Bittman recipe to either variant of this recipe, but this is still great and Ill probably make it again, in part because the leftover sauce can be used as a great accent to lots of other dishes. I second the recommendation to put a dollop of sour cream (with or without lime juice/zest added) on the side, to cut the heat, vary the tasting experience, and add to the visual appeal of the presentation. Goes great with mashed potatoes or polenta. Fresh cilantro is a good choice for color, sautéed Portobello (garlic and oil) adds a third flavor/texture that I liked. My last batch I split into half short ribs and half pork spareribs (in cuts of three). Though the beef has the more interesting look/texture, pork works quite well with the flavors here, maybe even better, and is a great alternative for those who are trying to save money or dont eat beef.

Rating: 4
Rather than possibly accentuating spiciness/bitterness with the ancho water, a bottle of Mackeson ale nicely bridges the piquancy of the adobo and the sweetness of the maple syrup quite nicely.

Rating: 3
This delicious dish is worthy of four forks with a few modifications. After burning the ribs in a roasting pan at 350 the first time, I braised them in a covered dutch oven at 300. Add water to the sauce if necessary to fully immerse the ribs. When the ribs are cooked (and succulent!), remove them from the sauce and cover with foil. Then boil the sauce 10-15 minutes to thicken. I also found that 4 lbs of short ribs is the right amount of meat for this much sauce. If you triple the maple syrup and lime juice, they are barely perceptible (instead of totally lost) under the pungent chiles, and the resulting flavor is complex and well-balanced.

Rating: 4
Wow. This is now one of my favorite comfort-food dishes. It was super easy to make, looks mouth-watering, and smells & tastes delicious. This is perfect for dinner parties b/c you can make it a day or two ahead - and it tastes even better when you do. The only thing I do differently is that I add reduced beef broth to the braising liquid, instead of the ancho-water. I also use a larger dutch oven, so there's more surface area, which allows me to make more sauce (I love the sauce) without covering the ribs.

Rating: 0
This recipe is fantastic! I have used it many times. I love short ribs and try different recipes all the time, but this is by far my favorite. They are best if made a day ahead of time and allowed to sit. The extra fat solidifies and is easier to remove before rewarming and serving. The recipe is deceptive when reading - it is not difficult at all and I follow it to the letter. Don't bother with other sides - the polenta is a perfect match.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe several times. The best advice I can give is to definately test the water you soaked the anchos in, and discard if bitter. This has always tasted great and is not too spicy for quantities called for.

I served this dish last night for a get together with my in-laws. In a word, it was delicious! Everyone raved about it! No one found it to be too spicy at all, but of course I think that it all depends on the ancho chiles you get (perhaps some older ones lose their potency), and on how carefully you remove all of the seeds and ribs from the chiles. I did remove every seed and the ribs too, and our dish came out with and ever-so-slight kick. I did make the dish two days in advance as recommended, and perhaps that mellowed the flavors as well. Also, one reviewer recommended serving the dish with sour cream to counteract any spiciness, and I would actually take that one step further: I made lime crema by mixing 1 1/2 c. sour cream with 1 T lime zest and 2T fresh lime juice, and it was a perfect foil for the richness of the dish. I would recommend serving it with the lime crema regardless of whether you think the spiciness needs to be cut.

Rating: 4
I've made this several times, usually for special company. It's wonderful every time. It's not too hot, unless you have an extremely low tolerance for spiciness, and never bitter, if you follow the instructions. I make it exactly as written, because it's so good I can't imagine any alteration that would make it better. In case you have guests who can't tolerate some spiciness, you can serve sour cream on the side to take away the heat. It's perfect with polenta, but also great with mashed potatoes.

Rating: 4
I have cooked this dish several times, always with perfect results. The flavor is rich and complex and goes great with a big red wine like a malbec. I cannot imagine what the reviewers who talk about burning or excessive "heat" are talking about: ancho chiles and a couple of chipotles with this quantity of meat are NOT hot, and it will not dry out if you simply cover it. I recommend a cheesy polenta with sharp cheddar to accompany it and endorse the suggestion of cooking ahead to intensify flavor and allow skimming of fat.

Rating: 4
I've made this a couple of times with a few modifications. 1) I lightly flour the ribs before I brown them. 2) I would use 3 ancho chiles - 4 is just a bit on the hot side for me but still savory. 3) I add a can of beef broth and discard the ancho water. I recently experimented with using a different cut of meat to make it for a pot-luck type of event so that it wouldn't cost a fortune to serve 10+ people. I used chuck rib roast and cut the roast into 2 inch chunks and the end result was fall-apart meat like a pot roast would be. Still wonderful. The first time I prepared it, I did put it in the oven to braise but this last time, I just braised it on the stove. If you do on the stove, keep an eye on the amount of liquid. I did have to add a cup of water towards the end so that the sauce didn't burn.

This is so decadent and rich and deep. really wonderful. Definilty need a dutch oven, my Le Cruset speeded the job up to a mere hour and 1/2 ... being in a hurry and I kicked the temp up to 400 for the last 40 min--couldn't tell at all, meat still melted off the bones. Wonderful with the polenta and mustard greens. Definite do again, tho next time I will take the learned advice of the cook from San Antonio del Mar... I love the sauce but I do think the flavors could be combined to a more subtle, slighly less bitter effect.

Rating: 3
I have made this many times and found the secret to turn it from really good to really great. First make it two to three tablespoons of lime juice, the second is to add in one single tablespoon of tomato paste. The tomato really adds just the right touch. It's important to make sure you get your seasonings right too - salt really does it's job here. Try it and let me know.

Made this tonight per the recipe, and it was excellent. It didn't blow me away (I thought it might), but it was solidly good. Do PLEASE make far enough in advance to thoroughly de-fat the braising liquid/sauce. Those ribs render a lot of fat. Also, don't be scared if the raw braising liquid is awfully hot from the chipotles; it all mellows out very nicely after 3-1/2 hrs.

Grocery store did not have anchos, so made do with two pasillas and two dried chipotles that we had in the pantry. Per another review's suggestions, we added cumin, cinnamon, and cloves to the blended mixture. Started dinner late, so we pressure cooked it in water w/splash of wine and broth. Then, popped it in the oven for 45 minutes with everything else like the recipe directed. Very tasty when served with polenta and wilted swiss chard!

I first had this dish on a business trip, well the sauce anyway, at Annie's in Houston, over filet mignon, and loved it. I was really excited to run across it in the magazine, so of course I made it, and found a new favorite dinner party recipe. It is absolutely fabulous! I don't know what the other reviewers are saying about it being so spicy, I follow the directions exactly and it's always mildly spicy but hardly overwhelming, and I'm not someone who likes a lot of heat. It just has this amazing depth of flavor and the short ribs melt off the bone. I use country style short ribs and cook it in a Le Creuset dutch oven, which I guess keeps it from burning as some people's had, as the lid fits tightly. I've never had mine burn. I sometimes serve it with polenta or grits, and sometimes with creamy mashed potatoes. It's always a winner at parties.

Holy cow, this was so hot I couldn't eat it, though hubby had no such trouble. Of course, he makes his own hot sauce using cayenne peppers so is more accustomed to the heat than I am. I may try it again using 1 ancho and 1 chipolte as it smelled so good as it was cooking. I figure I can always add more chipolte to the mix if it is not spicy enough.

I LOVE this dish. So easy so delicious. I haven't had a problem with burning, but I kept an eye on it. The last time I made it, I used a slow cooker instead of the oven, and this may be the only way to make them now!! Threw the ingredients in in the AM, had delicious dinner in the PM. Could not have been easier, and I most liked the layering of flavors that this recipe provides. It's a surprise (pleasant) with every bite. I only serve this with polenta. Guests always rave. Oven polenta makes this even more easy!!

Oops, sorry - it doesn't clearly state to add more liquid (that was a different recipe) but it does say that the liquid should come half-way up the pan. Too big of a pan will result in more rapid evaporation. Cooking always involves thinking and improvisation and attention. Besides, short ribs ain't cheap!

This recipe rocks. I had neighbors knock on my door to find out what I was cooking. I made it in a 5 quart saute pan but a dutch oven or braiser would be fine too. I'm not sure how the others managed to burn this as the recipe clearly states to add liquid if the ribs become too dry. My next attempt is to convert the recipe for my pressure cooker and enjoy these ribs in 35 minutes instead of 3 hours!

Rating: 2
I, too, was rewarded with a burned mess (I recently calibrated the thermostat on my oven, so I know that wasn't the problem). One reason I think it may have burned was the size of my roasting pan. I had to put two sheets of foil on it to cover, which left a gap for moisture to escape. I wonder how this recipe would be, baked in a dutch oven? Overall I think it probably has potential once you get past the drying out problem.

This recipe was very easy to follow. You didnt event need a knife to cut the meat..it fell right off the bone.

Made this three days ahead of a dinner party. Worried about it being too hot but it was just right--noticeably warm but not uncomfortable. Very complex flavors and incredibly tender ribs.

I have made this recipe twice, once with short ribs and once with flanken ribs. I like the flanken ribs better! It only took 1 1/2 hours at 325 degrees in my roasting pan.

This is a great short rib recipe. I was a little nervous about the heat from the chilis as I planned to serve some very nice wine for a tasting. But it was superb. Lots of flavor with a gentle glow/burn. Based on a recommendation here I did use only 2 ancho chilis and 2 pasilla.

We thought this was a wonderful recipe. The beef was falling apart tender and the bitterness of the anchos softened during the cooking time. We also followed Rick Bayless' method of toasting the chiles in a dry skillet and rehydrating in warm tap water. This added some nice smokiness to the dish.

The previous cook had lots of suggestions. My comments would be, this is a mediocre recipe, at best. They were very tender, but lacking. I think a phenomenal chef like Robert Del Grande would be ashamed to have his name referenced to with this recipe. Waited for two days before eating having expectations. I don't normally try recipes unless everyone rates them in the upper 80%. Won't again.

This recipe needed additional chiles. The ancho chile is very bitter and needs to be offset by another, sweeter chile. I reduce the number of anchos to 3, added 2 guajillo chiles, 2 more garlic cloves, a pinch of cumin, 2 cloves and about a one-inch piece of mexican cinnamon to the other items to be blended. I ommitted the lime juice, its acidity would tend to clash with the chiles in my experience. I did NOT use the soaking liquid from the chiles, the ancho makes it far too bitter. If you want to use soaking liquid in the braise, then soak the guajillos separately from the anchos. I used dried chipotles instead of canned because they're available here. The adobo clashes with the other ingredients and dried chipotles have a much stronger smoky flavor. I used a little beef broth instead of the soaking liquid or water. Also, I simmered them, tightly covered, in a dutch oven on top of the stove instead of the oven, the results were the same as baking and more traditionally Mexican. A lot of Mexicans don't even have ovens. I've been studying Mexican cuisine for years, this is a fairly typical dish with the exception of the addition of the maple syrup, here most would use piloncillo instead. I used the maple syrup, I liked the taste. If you can't find Guajillo chiles in your area, you can substitute New Mexico or California chiles with almost the same result. Another hint for those who don't want a lot of heat: soak your chiles in water with about 3 TB of vinegar added, that will cut the spiciness of the chiles, though any recipe with chipotle in it is going to be spicy by nature.

Tasty enough, but I didn't *love* it. The sauce had a bit of a strange taste-- I think I was just expecting something else. As someone else mentioned, this has all my favorite flavors, but something about the dish just didn't click with me. I followed the suggestion to braise two days ahead, and the ribs were certainly tender. I don't think this is something I'll repeat-- there are too many short rib recipes to try before settling on one I don't adore.

I used a beef chuck roast instead. After I blended the chiles, garlic, onions, etc., (I poured the coffee in too - to blend easier) I just poured it over the browned roast and cooked for 3 hours. I loved it. My husband isn't sure. I only used half of the liquid and boiled then saved the other half in a mason jar. There was plenty of sauce using only half. My method was simpler and I bet just as tasty. Next time, I'm gonna throw in some potatoes and carrots.

I didn't have an onion, so I omitted it. Instead, I threw a carrot in the pan while cooking it. Served it over couscous which was nice and light.

Absolutely de-lish! Followed the recipe except I only cooked 2 pounds of short ribs (only 2 of us). It only took about 2-1/2 hours to cook 2 pounds to the falling-off-the-bone tenderness point. It was a wonderful meal for a cold, drizzly rainy night. If you don't like spicy food or easily get heartburn, this might not be for you. The spices infuse the meat with a warming heat that doesn't overpower the tongue or throat but wonderfully showcase the ancho chili/coffee flavors. I served it over garlic mashed parsnip-potatoes and with black-eyed peas for our 2003 New Year's day dinner. My husband loved it and said it was a "keeper." I look forward to serving it to company who share our love for spicy foods.
