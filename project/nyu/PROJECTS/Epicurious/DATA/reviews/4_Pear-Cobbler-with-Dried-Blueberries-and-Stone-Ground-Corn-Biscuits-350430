Having received 10 lbs. of pears as a gift, this recipe was a godsend. Made it for the first time, but with some substitutions. Used half apple/white grape juice and half real pear brandy for the cup of liquid. Omitted the nutmeg ( I like it more with peaches or spinach) and added 3/4 tsp of almond extract and a few shakes of ginger then used chopped candied ginger instead of the blueberries using only 4oz so as not to overwhelm the pears. Came out great.

I only use the biscuits, they are divine! The filling is what ever is in season ... usually with added frozen wild blueberries that add juice, color and flavor. Great with vanilla ice cream, but my lighter alternative is plain non-fat Greek yogurt.

I give this four stars, because with just a little tinkering it can be awesome. The use of pears and dried fruit in the filling is very harmonious, and by incorporating corn meal into the biscuits this becomes a unique and delicious dessert. The final result, when topped with ice cream, is both sweet and salty, hot and cold, crunchy and smooth, and fruity and cakey. This coalescence of opposites is what we cobbler addicts look for in a dessert. On to the mods I made. First, six pounds of pears is A LOT. I used 4 lbs, and had pears piled to the sky in my dish. Secondly, you might consider doubling the biscuit recipe. I like a 50/50 blend of cake and fruit in a finished cobbler. Third, bump all the spices up a notch, and if you like, add a little more sugar to the pears. As written, the filling is a little bland. And finally, feel free to use frozen blueberries and/or craisins in the filling. I did both, which really helped the filling work. This may seem like a lot of modifications. Perhaps, but I found them to make the dessert spectacular. A real treat any time of year.

EASY AND YUMMY! WORTH THE BISCUITS ALONE!

Hit of our company party with a few changes that were mostly convenience rather than my great ideas. Used Bartletts as they were the only local pears available at the market. Used juie from four fresh limes rather than lemon and used a cornbread mix as it was Saturday morning and I just didn't feel like making from scratch. Didn't bother peeling the pears as I like the texture. Did use the dried blueberries and they add a great flavor. Our gathering was only about 1/2 what was anticipated due to weather but of those there the only one who didn't chow down was a vegan. Asked four times for the recipe. I'd say that's pretty good.

Definitly good. The biscuits are to die for. Save the biscuit recipe for different dishes. I didn't have dries blue berries so I used frozen. A decent substitute. I also did not roll the biscuits and the cut into biscuit shape. Too much labor for just a cozy after dinner dessert for the family. Instead I just hand formed the biscuits into discs. Much easier. I used a 9x9 inch dish instead of a 9x13. We don't need that much dessert at our house! Although I kept the biscuit recipe the same. I was glad I did because these biscuits are to die for. The pears make for a nice fall dish using the pears in our orchard.

These biscuits are to die for. My picky boyfriend gives it 10/10. I used fresh wild blueberries and cut the extra butter on top of the fruit.

The cornbread biscuits make the most delicious shortbread EVER EVER EVER!!! Because they are slightly dry (but with a lovely buttery tenderness), they soak up the pear/apple/lemon juices beautifully. I'm saving the recipe because I will probably adopt the biscuits as my shortbread of choice. As for the fruit, the recipe was okay. I would leave out the blueberries and add more lemon and cut the liquid. I might also try using instant tapioca as a thickener instead of cornstarch. It will be interesting to see how it tastes on the second day.

For once, I made a recipe pretty much as written (although we only had 4 pounds of pears) and it was fabulous. No sugar added and none was needed. I'd recommend splitting the prep as I too found it time consuming to core and peel the pears by hand. One of those apple corer/wedgers as mentioned would come in very handy here.

This was an excellent recipe. I used three different types of native pears and added 2 small apples. It was easy, looked great, and leftovers made a good breakfast. I also added 2 tablespoons of sugar. Trader Joe's sells the dried blueberries for a reasonable price.

This recipe is absolutely delicious and surprisingly easy to make. We used Bosch pears, which were really flavorful, along with plenty of dried blueberries. We added the extra sugar, but I don't think it was really necessary, especially once you serve it up with ice cream. The corn biscuits were nicely textured and naturally sweet, which complimented the fruit nicely. Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner loved it, and I will definitely be making it again soon. Hint: Using a hand-held apple corer/slicer on the pears after we peeled them made everything extremely quick and easy.

This was not a good recipe. The filling did not have very much flavor even with the addition of more sugar. The biscuits were very dry and a little too corn meal tasting. I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and nobody was a fan. So in short I would never make this again and you should not waste your time.

We fell into a surplus of pears this season, and this seemed like a good use of them. It was a simple recipe, although peeling and coring the pears was a bit time consuming. The filling and biscuits can be made ahead and kept chilled unassembled until ready to use. I recommend using a couple tablespoons of sugar. I also substituted dried cherries for the blueberries, it seemed to make more sense to me. It is pretty tasty all-in-all, I liked the dryness and crunchiness of the biscuits with the filling. You must serve it warm with ice cream!
