Great recipe. I tried the steak and also thick(1.25 inch)boneless pork chops. However, I note that some reviewers are put off by the heavy cream in the sauce. I substituted 2% evaporated milk and you could even use evaporated skim milk. I regularly substitute evaporated milk for whole cream in recipes with satisfactory results (just remember that it is a little sweeter). In a pinch, I have even used plain yogurt thinned with a bit of milk

This recipe is one our favorites! Hint: gently cook cracked pepper in 1 tbsp olive oil for 10 to 15 minutes over low heat (just so oil bubbles) this removes the heat but retains the flavour of the pepper. Cool and add 1/2 tsp salt. Pat each side of steak with a good crust of peppers and wrap in plastic wrap for at least 1 hour before cooking. My hubby barbques the steak while I make the sauce and we slice the steak in thin strips and cover with a bit of sauce. Really nice!

It was fun trying steak with a cream sauce, but this isn't a recipe I'd make again. While it was tasty enough, it wasn't out of this world and a sauce that rich should be incredible. But it wasn't bad.

This is a great recipe& easy, elegant with excellent taste& given a small change or so. First, dont be afraid to knock off a few of the peppercorns just before serving for those who dont love pepper as much as I do. Second, add 1/8 tsp of the sea salt and 1 tbsp of flour just before you add in the bourbon (we used Makers Mark). Next, STRAIN the sauce before pouring over the steak. This makes a huge difference and allows you to press in the true flavour of the seasonings. Last, and this is pure preference, rub a fresh bay leaf over the warm meat just before pouring the sauce then garnish with a little dried parsley for an extra special touch.

I really hated the sauce....I ended up throwing it away :(

I've recently began getting more and more enjoyment out of cooking, and have found it very enjoyable. I found this recipe simply because I love the flavors present in bourbon, and wanted to try cooking with it, which I have never done. I used Jim Beam, just as the reviewer below. I love the moderately harsh flavors for mixing as compared to a more premium bourbon that I would drink straight. And I assumed the same would be true for cooking. I think if I make bourbon recipes a regular in my kitchen I may even pick up a bottle of the less refined 4-year variety to get a little more bite. Someone correct me if my assumptions are wrong, thanks :) I too thought the sauce was a little bland. On my next attempt I'm going to use more bourbon and stock, with less cream and reduce the cream a little more. But overall the flavors were amazing.

Excellent Dish Followed other advice about heat add red dried chiles to peppercorn rub. Used home-made stock. The trick to get a thick sauce is simple, boil baby boil, reduce the stock more then called for and reduce the cream. Put your steak on a holding plate covered with foil or in a warming oven. Finish sauce by added juices on the plate to the sauce.

Delicious. Added a pinch of red pepper flakes to the sauce with the broth to counter others' comments of blandness, which added just the right amount of heat. Absolutely scrumptious - we soaked up every last bit of the sauce.

So I was a bit skeptical after reading the reviews, but decided to use this recipe anyway... I substituted chicken broth for the beef broth, a yellow onion for the shallots, and half-and-half for the cream, because these ingredients were what was "on hand." Using the relative proportions, I proceeded with the basic recipe instructions. I didn't have expectations of a boldly-flavored sauce, and was rewarded with a lovely blend of onion, bourbon, butter and cream over barbequed pepper-encrusted top sirloin. Dear Husband and I enjoyed this with a rich Wente Riva Ranch Reserve 2004 Chardonnay - it seemed a decent pairing with the sauce instead of a Zin, Pinot Noir or Merlot. It was a remarkable blend - and yes, this sauce is a keeper.

We quite liked this as a different way to cook steak and it might revisit my kitchen in future, but I have several other steak recipes that I much prefer.

I agree with the other reviews that the sauce is bland. I used red onion instead of shallot and fat free half and half instead of cream, but don't think that is why the sauce was bland. It is too delicately flavored for beef.

I made this tonight for my family for Valentine's day. It was delicious. The sauce didn't thicken as much as I would have liked, but the flavor was terrific.

A nice recipe, and mostly done with stuff you'd have on hand anyway. The sauce doesn't really do the beef justice, though, being quite bland. I'm a spice fiend, too -- and this leaves a pleasant hot tingle after the meal that screams for something cold and light and sweet -- perhaps a strongly flavored sorbet to end? Next time, I may stir in a bit of demi-glace to punch up the sauce, and grill the steak over coals, adding to the overall flavor of the dish.

Fantastic! The sauce offsets the pepper for a delicious flavor.

I want to say I was reluctant to try this recipe because of the lack of reviews...but I would have missed out on one great steak. I used Jim Beam...which was almost nutty in flavor. It reminded me some of a marsala cream sauce. You kind of look at the ingredients and say how is that supposed to be great...but somehow it works. When my wife and I just mmm'nd and aww'd all meal. We wished we had some breadsticks to finish up the rest of the sauce. Wonderful!
