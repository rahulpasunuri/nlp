Made as written, and a total waste of the chocolate, PB, and ice cream underneath. Would have been fine, except for the last step of adding water. The end result: the ingredients of this recipe are better than the combined efforts.

I can't believe more people haven't tried this! I made mine with all dark chocolate, but other than that, I kept it the same. The consistency is great and a real treat for chocolate/peanut butter lovers. I used mine more as a warm topping for chocolate cake, but I bet it would be great with ice cream.
