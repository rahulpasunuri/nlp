We all loved this dish! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, so was concerned that they might dry out...but they were moist and flavorful! On the gas grill, I put two burners on high and the middle one off. After a brief stint over the high burner to give grill marks, I moved the chicken to the "off" area so it would finish cooking with indirect heat (kept lid closed, and adjusted the burners occasionally to keep heat between 350-400). I used an instant-read thermometer and cooked till the thickest part of each piece was 160 degrees. Once a piece hit 160, I took it off the grill and covered it with foil. For serving, I drizzled the "drizzle" lightly over the chicken on the platter. About halfway through eating my chicken, I gave it another drizzle because the oil was so good - I could have easily drizzled it on my potato and green beans, too! I will definitely make this again!!

I've made this twice in the last month. It is awesome! A lot of flavor, even as a cold left over. Very moist. I roasts to a beautiful deep brown.

Variated and used this recipe for grilled breasts.So few ingredients to make chicken breasts taste special. My go-to grilled chicken recipe now!

An easy dish to grill on a hot summer night. I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter, and served with Grilled Lemons, Baby Artichokes and Eggplant as suggested. The grilled chicken and veggies made for a very satisfying meal-and best of all, I didn't heat up my kitchen on a 100+ degree day!

The chicken recipe was easy, fast, and delicious. I used cilantro instead of parsley and it tasted great. I followed the cooking instructions to a tee and it turned out perfectly; I put the lemons on the grill after I took the chicken off. They were charred after 2 minutes. I served with saffron tumeric rice and roasted broccoli so that plate was colorful.

I used the marinade as written with boneless breasts and it was wonderful! Even my son loved this and he seldom says anything about recipes I try!

So easy and sooo tasty. Would recommend the recipe to anyone wanting a quick delicious chicken recipe. The drizzle would go great with fish and veal.

This was delicious. I think that I ate all of the skin off the chicken myself. I don't generally like lemon, but in this case, the lemon was not overwhelming. I had read about indirect grilling before, but for some reason hadn't tried it. Oh wow! I will be using it more frequently from now on. The meat was tender and juicy, and I didn't even brine the chicken (the marinade will not act as a tenderizer)! Next time I'll flip it over earlier, though, because whatever part is on top is the part that browns, and I would have preferred that the breasts be more browned. Also, the whole chicken took about 30 minutes less than what the recipe calls for. I'm sure it depends largely on your grill and how much water is in your chicken. Try this!! It's a great way to get a cheap, tasty chicken meal without heating up your kitchen. One more thing: I would definitely suggest not just tying the legs together but trussing the whole chicken. Check out Thomas Keller's chicken recipe on this site.

Grilled up three chickens for 10 people. Stuffed half a lemon and some fresh rosemary sprigs into the cavity. This was easy and everyone raved. The leftovers are good as well.

wow! just made this chicken and it was fabulous! I have never written a review and i don't even especially like chicken, so this one was so good that i thought I should write something. I didn't put the drizzle on but had it on the side for people to dip - yum. I was quite surprised that even the breast meat was quite moist - after squeezing the lemons for their juice, i put them in the cavity overnight to marinate but took them out when I went to BBQ b/c I thought it might make the chicken cook longer.

Perfect grilled chicken, don't change a thing. Whole or in pieces, works both ways.

This was really tasty. I followed it to the letter. As I had a pretty big crowd, I also ended up doubling the marinade and drizzle...using one batch on the chicken and the second batch on skirt steak. It was terrific on both!

I made this for my husband and son, but I used chicken pieces instead of while chickens. My husband is not a huge chicken fan but he raved about this meal! I loved the Mediterranean drizzle, just the right lemony flavor. This will be a regular on my grille this summer!

This was such an easy recipe and the flavor was amazing!! The hardest part of this recipe was letting it sit after cooking but it was very worth it because it melted in our mouths.

I made this for my book club this past summer and it was fantastic. I swore I wouldn't roast a whole chicken in the oven again. Now it is too cold to cook outside so I marinated the chicken as noted in the recipe and cooked it in the oven. It was still good, but nothing like cooking it on a charcoal grill. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

this is okay, just nothing special

very tasty indeed. LOVED getting roasted chicken without heating the kitchen. Would have liked the skin crispier though - will need to work on that next time. The "drizzle" was superfluous - didn't add much, will skip that next time.

This was pretty good. My wife likes fairly plain food...nothing with too much zip. This really hit the spot. The flavor is subtle but good. Most real Italian food is much different then "American" Italian food. This recipe really lets the ingredients speak for themselves. I cooked this over charcoal, along with some zucchini and eggplant rubbed with olive oil and fresh ground sea salt and ground pepper. All in all it was a very good dinner

fantastic. cooked two chickens for three families, everyone loved it!! Served with the grilled eggplant, baby artichokes and lemon halves and it was perfect. It's my "special" entertaining summer meal, and easy enough just for my family. Chicken was done in just under an hour, otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.

used the marinade on chicken breasts and served with a basil aioli (bon appetit,july 2008). Delicious!

I also put a 1/2 of a lemon in the cavity of the chicken before putting it on the grill, it really gives the chicken a nice lemon essence.

This was unbelievably good! And so simple to make. The chicken comes out juicy and permeated with the flavors of garlic and lemon. One note only - don't put salt and pepper on the table! If you have folks who salt first, they'll be sorry.

We've made this twice now in the last several weeks and it's probably THE best grilled chicken ever. We barbecued it on our Weber over mesquite and the aromas made the neighbors jealous. I made a beautiful Tuscan salad to serve with it, opened a lovely Chardonnay and we were licking our plates. You won't be disappointed in this one!

This was delicious and pretty simple to make. I forgot the drizzle and it ws still delicious. With a little planning this makes a great meal for company.

Great simple recipe - I didn't even use the drizzle, just grilled the chicken and served with a simple pasta side. My only alteration to the recipe was to butterfly the chicken, which resulted in a nice crispy brown skin and more even cooking. Overall a keeper!

made four chickens july 4 and they were a big hit. made it again this weekend and will be makinbg it tomorrow for the in-laws. this is a wonderful recipe, especially for a crowd. had to extend the cooking time once i flipped it, but it was no problem. make it--you and your guests will be happy and leftovers will be a joy.

This is a great dish for a crowd. I used the 2 chickens & it served 5 people. I would double it to 4 chickens for 10 guests. My suggestion is to marinade the chickens for a minimum of 4 hours. I could not imagine a 1 hour marinade. The flavours were excellent. We also upped the temperture on my Weber gas grill which did the trick. My concern was at the stated temperature, the meat cooked too slow to get the meat up to the required poultry temp. So, meantime, I'll check my grill & see if its an operator problem. Go for the recipe. It's a keeper.

As other reviewers stated, the drizzle sauce is excellent and makes the dish. Leftover chicken and sauce - if there is any - can be served with romaine lettuce and parmesan cheese as a take on caesar salad.

this was wonderful! We marinated it overnight and the flavors were so good. We have never used the indirect cooking method before, but it resulted in such juicy chicken that we will definitely be doing it again. We had 2 whole chickens (bell and evans, the best!) for 7 people, and had no left overs. The grilled veggies were good too, and the meditarranean drizzle made the dish. I added asparagus to it.

Made this last night with small local chickens. Delicious -- nice and juicy and flavorful. Stuffed cavities with half a lemon and some rosemary. Great with grilled veggies and pesto pasta.

If you BAKE this with the marinade it forms a wonderful sauce with the chicken drippings. Can add the drizzle to the sauce also.

Oh my, was this wonderful! We made this last night on our Weber,using mesquite charcoal. We split the chickens and followed the recipe to a "T"...did not grill quite as long. 45 minutes, then flipped and cooked for another 15. They were juicy, flavorful and just amazing. We're looking forward to having leftovers tonight. Make this...you won't be disappointed!

This was extremely scrumptious. The marinade was wonderfully aromatic and very nice on the palate. The Mediterranean drizzle made the dish really come alive. Definitely will make this many more times!

Found the flavor too strong. Not worth the effort to marinate. Only change made was adding grated lemon rind as I do whenever using fresh citrus.

I'm still tasting the chicken from dinner- 3 hours later!!! Delicious- the drizzle sauce really makes it pop!!! I don't have a good track record on the grill, but I split the chicken, and it cooked up great!!! I'll make this again and again- awesome!!!

Made this for some guests a few days ago. They said it was the best chicken they ever had. I have to admit it was pretty darn good. I used chicken halves and reduced the total cooking time to one hour.

this is an excellent chicken dish. the only additional thing i add is some rosemary. i use some dried in the marinade, or if i have fresh, stuff the inside of the chicken with a few stems prior to grilling, and it is delish! you can also add some lemon halves to the inside as well and it will permeate the meat. use caution when indirect grilling to keep the meat moist and flavorful. if you are a little nervous, and the meat is well marinaded, you can halve the chickens and then grill indirectly as well. also works well in the rotisserie or just roasted in the oven. yummy any which way and every time!

OMG, this is so amazing!! The lemon "drizzle" was so good for something so simple! I found the artichokes to be a little on the tough side, but the chicken was cooked perfectly per the gas grilling directions. I will make this again and again this summer!!!

I did it with chicken halves - the grilled lemons make the dish. Perfect summer meal with a cold wheat beer and more lemon!
