I made this recipe just as written n(except for using my own poached chicken) and it was delicious. Even my teenaged sons loved it.

I gave this four forks because it isn't often I find such a great tasting dish that makes use of such inexpensive ingredients, and is so quick and easy to pull together. I followed the recipe exactly, and served it to my husband, along with a dry white wine and slices of crusty white bread. We both loved it. I expect this to become frequent fare at our dinner table.

Light, fresh and delicious. I have made it many times, for family and guests, and everyone has really liked it. Served with freshly-made focaccia and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc on a hot summer evening. Perfect!

Very good, but nothing special. Easy and tasty, but the sauce is a little too mayonaisse-y. I thinned it with some milk, per the previous reviewer's comments.

Awesome dish and soooo easy. Even my teenage son loved it! I roasted the chicken on the grill and then served over the greens w/ the chilled tarragon-caper sauce. I used extra tarragon and there were no leftovers.

Delicious! My husband loved the sauce. Great for a quick weeknight dinner.

This was very good - nothing spectacular, but good. My only criticism is that the dressing was too thick. I should have simply thinned it with milk...it kind of plopped on the chicken. I had an open jar of peppadews, so used them instead of the roasted peppers. Very simple dinner.

This is one of my favorite week night recipes, I make it more than any other. I add some dried basil and oregano to olive oil, then brush over chicken breasts. In winter I use my indoor grill to grill them, in summer I grill them outside along with roasting my own pepper. Tarragon is one of my favorite herbs, I absolutely love the dressing. Fantabulous!

Love this recipe! Have made it many, many times because it's so easy and is one of my husband's favourite meals. The recipe works very well with leftover salmon, too. I also add a boiled, quartered egg for some extra protein and colour. Great for low-carbers.

This was very easy to make. The sauce was wonderful, but I made it a few hours before and put it in the fridge to let the flavors come together. Went great with a bottle of dry white wine. "Try it. You'll like it."

Nice dish with very nice flavor. "Sauce" is a little thick and I would like better either warm or thinner as a salad dressing. Fairly simple and can be made quickly.

Since I first saw this recipe a few months ago, I have made it a dozen times. I used 2 tsp. dried tarragon instead of fresh. I mixed everything together for the dressing and it was outstanding. My husband didn't care for it (the dressing) but I make it for me. He's getting persnickety in his old age. I have a big bottle of capers I bought on line and love new recipes which call for capers so I can use them.

I usually fiddle around with recipes a little...this one I didn't. I grilled the chicken on my Big Green Egg, and followed the recipe to the letter. The light smokey flavor from the grill complemented the dish nicely.

Very simple recipe. It says, "I know you're tire after work and want a fairly guilt-free meal, so come cook me."

To the reviewer from Gotham on 9/3, one could add that a difficult task for the average cook is to prepare a noteworthy meal everyday, that fits into budget and time constrants. The magazine you recommend is for the trade and presents quite difficult recipes to the average cook. But on your behalf, the articles are wonderful and informative. This simple chicken salad is excellent for the novice cook to the experinced chef (who may suffer from exhaustion after work!) I am not a soccer mom, just like to eat well and simply, and this fit the bill nicely.

We liked this a lot. I roasted the chicken along with red peppers so that it wasn't a completely cold salad. Dressing was yummy.

Very, very good. Made it last night for dinner and my boyfriend declared it to be perfect. Couldn't find fresh tarragon, so used dried and did not notice the difference. Seasoned chicken with salt, pepper and some dried tarragon then poached. Also added cubes of fresh mozzeralla.

This was fantastic and easy to make. Definetely filing and great for quick dinners for unexpected guests.

Gotta agree with the cook on 9/1. Completely original recipes are pretty rare at this level of cuisine. For the past few years, Gourmet and BA seem to be geared more towards the dilletants and soccer-moms. I recommend Art Culinaire for more innovative cuisine.

To the cook who wondered how anyone could be making this all the time when the recipe just came out in print: How new do you think all recipes are? They are all just variations of innovations of good cooks. :)

This was wonderful, fast and easy! I used sautéed, sliced chicken, then added sliced avocado, cubes of fresh mozzarella, sliced olives, fresh tomatoes and al denté green beans to the basic recipe and my family loved it. And it looked beautiful on the plates. Will definitely make it again.

To the cook on 08/18/2003 - how can you say you make this all the time, when the receipe just came out in the magazine?

A nice light summer meal! Based on earlier reviews, we added shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the finished product, and dried tarragon to the chicken during cooking. I was out of vinegar, so we substituted lemon juice. Worked great! Tried one more sort of odd addition: baked pixie-crinkle french fries. It's a weird regional thing around here, but works well with this.

My husband was balking at the thought of salad for dinner- but this dish won him over!! Spruced up the salad by adding kalamata olives, sliced cucumbers, scallions, and cubes of fresh mozzarella. Sprinkled some dried tarragon on the chicken with s&p before grilling and it came out fabulous. Easy and filling for a summer supper.

Fabulous salad and beautiful presentation. Ease of preparation using market roasted chicken is a big plus. Super for us low-carbers! If you like the taste of tarragon, you'll love this one.

A great low carb meal. My husband stuffed his chicken and greens in pita bread. We were both in heaven.
