This is a fantastically simple recipe which relies on having great, quality ingredients. This recipe will be bland if you reduce the amount of shallots or use a poor quality cheese. With the right ingredients, it is simply delicious. You can use half the amount of butter and a 1:1 ratio of milk to high quality stock for the same results. I also use this as a base recipe for a creamy vegetable lasagna. Just add any vegetables you want between the layers -- kale, squash, sundried tomatoes, mushrooms -- and it becomes a very healthy vegetarian dish. Since there's no cheese its not loaded with fat.

I made this for a birthday dinner last Saturday. The only change I made was to add some sauteed mushrooms in the layers. It was very good.

This was delish! I agree with other reviewers though that it needs some vegetables between the layers. Next time I may try mushrooms or spinach. I will be making this again for Easter Sunday!

My non-vegetarian, meat and potatoes spouse loves this, especially when baby spinach is inserted between the lasagna sheets.

Great, but very rich! It goes well with a green side like broccoli however.

We made this after my 10-year old son suggested combining macaroni and cheese and lasagna--this seemed close! We added a variety of cheeses to the bechamel while it was cooling, which added a lot of flavor. Since there were only three of us, we made a small recipe and baked it in a bread loaf pan lined with baker's parchment--this made serving it and clean up a lot easier!

Quite delicious! The egg added a lovely texture in my opinion. I halved the recipe and used a dry white wine (all I had on hand) and added steamed spinach to the layers. For those who considered this recipe bland, I suspect that good parmesan was not used - it's presence makes the meal. Next time I'll make it with the marsala. Yum!

Just as there are those that love eggs in their macaroni and cheese and those that don't, I personally, did not care for the texture that eggs gave to this finished dish. This, however, is quite special when made with Pecorino Romano instead of Parm, half the wine, (I used Zinfandel), twice the salt and no eggs in the sauce. If you want the taste of the eggs without the eggy texture, just hard boil the eggs, chop and sprinkle between layers. option.

My whole family loves this recipe. I vamped it up a bit by adding 4-6 Tbs olive oil and cutting the butter by 1/2. I then added 1 whole finely chopped leek and several chopped mushrooms. I then sauteed all the above until cooked thoroughly. Drained the oil from the leek mixture & added back to pan, added flour to the oil & continued with the remainder of the recipe. For variation I added sliced plum tomatoes between the layers. This gives it some nice color while not overpowering the cream sauce. To lower the fat content, I used 1% milk and the sauce still thickened nicely. Enjoy!

You definitely need to double the filling. It needs to be spiced up a bit. I added tarragon, but it wasn't enough.

This was delicious, and a big hit with my kids who normally dislike lasagne. I did add some hot italian sausage and fresh baby spinach.

I made this with skim milk instead of whole and left out the marsala. I also substituted vegetable broth for chicken. I added fresh portobello mushrooms to the sauce and then topped it with more covered with reggiano...It smelled so great cooking!!! Tasted amazing....

I've made this recipe many times; often when in Umbria for Italian friends. Those who find it bland and uninteresting are apparently not obeying the first law of cooking. Taste, taste, taste. The besciamella sauce must be tasted for for richness of flavor and seasoning prior to putting the lasagne together. If the end result is bland it's the cook not the recipe that's at fault. As others have mentioned this is a truly Italian pasta recipe where the pasta is the star. Up until now it's been a universal success for me (also with 'real' Italians.

I liked the simplicity of this pasta, it stood well as as a side dish to any type of protein. Next time, I will omit the marsala, try using white wine instead and add more Parmasean. I think it could do with some garlic as well.

I made it exactly as written, but layered sauteed wild mushrooms on one side of it. Left the other half plain, according to the recipe (for one member of the family who doesn't like mushrooms). Having tried both sides, I can say the mushrooms made it much more delicious and interesting. Kind of bland without them. I used fresh lasagne sheets and did not precook them. Very nice.

I, too, added some proscuitto--just layered it in. Excellent addition. This is a very nice, easy variation on the usual lasagne. Got rave reviews all around at my table. Nice for those who don't like too much cheese (I love cheese, but I know some people don't.) I could also see sauteed mushrooms as a nice addition. But I wouldn't add too much, really. It's simplicity itself, and good that way.

I substituted mushroom broth for chicken broth. You know, the strong, dark water you get after soaking dried morels and porcinis. Substituted 2% milk for whole, cause it's what I had and there is all that butter. Served with sliced roasted pimentos in olive oil & garlic. Wowie.

I have made this twice, it is great. I have added shredded mozzeralla, not a lot but a bit. I also added a garlic clove last time with the shallots. Use the barilla flat no cook lasagna noodles as they work best.

I also doctored up the ingredients, by having a layer of shredded rotisserie chicken surrounded by a couple layers of frozen spinach/ricotta/egg mixture. Like other users, I also used Whole Foods' fresh pasta sheets (uncooked, but assembled 3 hrs before baking.) The layers didn't hold together as well as I had hoped (perhaps adding more egg to the layers would help, or draining the spinach more), but the taste was very good. One note regarding the sauce: when I tasted it by itself, the Marsala gave it an odd flavor. Once baked, it wasn't detectable. I'm not sure it's a necessary ingredient for the sauce. All in all, I would love to experiment and make this dish again.

REALLY good! I added some mushrooms in between the layers and used low-rent no boil noodles and it was awesome!

I had a similar dish at a farmhouse restaurant in Chianti two years ago. It is delicious. IMO, it's a good first course -- small bites with wonderful flavors. Save the prosciutto, mushrooms, etc., for other dishes. This is a great way to start a meal. Also, fresh pasta sheets from Whole Foods are easy and I find them preferable to the dry lasagne sheets. I've made it three times now, always to positive reviews.

An unexpected delight and a new twist on a classic favorite! It's worth the effort to make your own lasagne sheets to go with the delicate sauce. A drizzle of warm use truffle oil adds a new dimension of flavor to this dish.

I made this for guests the other night and it was a hit. There was only one piece was left when we were finished. Even my picky seven and four year old demanded seconds. I made some adjustments to the original recipe. Like many others, I used prosciutto. I also put fresh butter saute'd mushrooms in the sauce, added fresh leaf spinach in between the layers, used fresh romano and Monterey Jack cheeses (in addition to fresh parm ). The last addition I made was instead of using 1/4 cup of the sauce in between layers, I used about a cup and a half. Overall, we all loved it and I would definitely make it again.

I made this for guests the other night and all but one piece was eaten. It was really good. Even my picky four and seven year old asked for seconds! Like many others, I used prosciutto slices in between the layers. In addition to the original recipe, I altered mine by adding fresh mushrooms saute'd in butter, romano and shredded Monterey Jack Cheese and fresh leaf spinach - all in between each layer of noodle. When the recipe called for 1/4 cup of sauce, that wasn't enough for me and I ended up scooping in about a cup and a half in between eah layer. Enjoy!

Made recipe at 1.5 times ingredients to use a larger pan. Included sauteed cultivated mushrooms and shredded roast chicken on alternating layers along with the balsamella parmagiano. I believe that prosciutto would work well, as others have reported. My family felt that these additions made the dish better as I had previously served the recipe as written.

I made this recipe almost exactly as listed except that I added some extra cheese on top. Baked up really nice and golden. I really liked the simplicity, however if I make this again I think I'll add some prosciutto as others had suggested.

This was very good and not too difficult to make either. It does take some time though so keep that in mind. I served it with a pork loin on the side but would consider maybe layering some prosciutto in the lasagna next time. http://megan-deliciousdishings.blogspot.com/2008/11/white-lasagne-with-parmigiano.html

It puffed up brilliantly and tasted wonderful. I made it with vegetable stock and put some baby spinach and sautéed mushrooms between a couple of the layers. I agree that the sauce is little on the blander side though - so maybe try using a more robust cheese?

...I really didn't think this one was all that special... I was expecting more flavor from this, but it seemed to amount to little more than a few lasagne noodles with what tasted like leftover alfredo sauce. A waste of fat grams, if you ask me...There might be hope for it if other things like chicken were added...I'm kind of disappointed that I have to eat this for the rest of the week now...

The masala was so overwhelming that it ruined the dish for me. Next time I will leave it out.

Wonderfully simple and surprisingly satisfying weeknight dish. I made this as written, but subbed "No-chicken" veggie broth to make it truly vegetarian for my veggie husband. The smell alone as its baking is worth the (fairly minimal) effort - its particularly nice that the ingredients are those I typically have on hand. Puffed up beautifully and tasted delish, even as leftovers. It's certainly tempting to add something between the layers - fresh herbs, spinach, etc. but the simplicity of this dish is so nice I think I'll resist and continue to serve veggies on the side. Roasted asparagus sounds ideal, but simple fresh peas were great last night. Enjoy!

This white lasagne is absolutely divine. Beware: it is extremely rich and decadent, but pure and simple as well. I served it with the asparagus, pea, and basil salad. This will certainly replace any other white lasagne recipe that I have!

The recipe as written is a great base. I added chopped rotisserie chicken, blanched spinach and sliced mushrooms between the layers. My only complaint is that the Marsala was undectable, but that could be because I used a grocery-store quality cooking Marsala. The low-sodium chicken broth I used came through rather strongly so maybe next time I'll increase the Marsala & decrease the broth. I'm sure fresh chicken stock would have a milder flavor and quality Marsala would have a stronger flavor.

I was a little apprehensive that this dish might taste very heavy, but I was definitely pleasantly surprised. I added some leftover roast chicken between the layers and the dish does need it for contrast, and for some added depth. I also breadcrumbed the pan I cooked it in and added breadcrumbs to the parmesan topping. I will definitely make it again because it has all the benefits of comfort food without being heavy. A nice twist on this for a dinner party would be to make individual ramekin servings.

My family thought this was great. It didn't turn out flat - it "puffed up" over the edge of my pan and browned beautifully. I added some fresh parsley between layers too (thanks for the idea) and in the future, crab or prosciutto sound good too. My only variation was that I ran out of whole milk, so I had to use about 3/4 cup fat-free milk to get the correct volume. But it didn't seem to adversely affect the dish. Served it with the asparagus/peas/basil side, which is now one of my favorite vegetable dishes! Bottom line: nice alternative to traditional lasagne and easier to make as well!

Mine too came out pretty flat and was a bit disappointing. I also added prosciutto, but apparently not enough because we couldn't taste the flavor. I grabbed a bottle of sherry instead of the marsala and wonder how much that affected the flavor. I've made a very labor intensive wild mushroom lasagne before that was fabulous... so will add dried porcini and fresh mushrooms next time to boost the flavor. I will say the lasagne smelled divine while it was cooking.

I was a bit disappointed too as mine came out pretty flat too. I grabbed the bottle of sherry instead of the marsala and wonder how different it would have tasted using the marsala. I'll give it another shot to see. It did however, smell divine while it was cooking. I also added the prosciutto though the flavor didn't come through. I'll use more next time. I've made a very labor intensive wild mushroom lasagne with a white sauce before that was fabulous. Might add a mixture of sauteed fresh mushrooms and dried porcini next time for amp up the flavor.

Decent, but not worth making again. The lasagna came out pretty flat, so it looked like a pancake. Not particularly appetizing looking. I'd say this recipe is so-so.

I made two versions of this, one with chicken and sausage for my carnivorous hubby and one with spinach for me. The sauce is the best part, but it does need a little something else between the layers (thus the meat & veggies). Was great with the additions: sauteed the spinach in oo & garlic for mine, shredded a rotisserie chicken and cooked hot italian sausage for his.

did not make as written. i ALWAYS have to adjust recipes to what i have on hand and love and need. used yellow onion, not shallot. added minced garlic. used fresh grated parm and romano. used generic lasagna noodles. no boil are 2xs the price and i have not boiled my MUST COOK lasagna noodles in years. you can't tell the difference. added fresh ground chicken and will also add blanched spinach next time. i imagine the original recipe is super, but it is awfully rich and lacks the protein and nutritional value we opt for. i love to improve on something everyone finds wonderful.

We made this exactly as the recipe is written and it was delicious! I used fresh lasagna sheets from our local farmers' market. If I would make a change, it would be to use home-made pasta made according to Lidia Bastianich's notation to use soft or low-protein flour, such as White Lily. Having made pasta before to this specification, the silken texture would suit this rich smooth sauce perfectly!
