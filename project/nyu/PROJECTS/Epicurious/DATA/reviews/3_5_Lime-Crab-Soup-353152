Was unaware it was suppose to be a cold soup until after purchasing the ingrediants and reading the reviews.... search for Spicy Lime Crab Soup

followed the recipe exactly, but was disappointed with the results. The flavors just never melded. Won't be making this again.

I will eat almost anything and I thought this soup was gross. My husband, on the other hand, liked it. He didn't LOVE it. Just liked it. He said it was WAY too limey and he loves lime. I cut the recipe (after reading other reviews) to the juice of two limes and a tiny bit of lime zest (not even a whole lime)... and still he said too limey. I almost think the lime should be added at the end. Oh... and I tried it cold and it wasn't good, so I heated it (again after reading the other reviews). It was just okay.

I have made this recipe twice and we love it. For a summer recipe, I loved the fact that you do not have to cook anything. The second time I used a whole chipolte chili (seeded) and it really had some kick. I made it for my book club and everyone asked for the recipe. It is unique!

I agree that the recipe was incomplete. The base should be really pureed! Not clear about what should be cooke. I cooked the corn altho I thought you could use frozen cooked corn instead. Will try it again without quite so much lime juice. I also agree the avocado should be in slices. The crabmeat should not be overpowered by the lime. I'm going to try it warmed also.

The flavors were lovely with the corn, crab, avocado and chipotle. However, I did have to do some monkeying around to get a recipe I liked though. I believe its supposed to be cold and I decided to make it warm instead as I'm not a fan of cold soups. I made a standard cream soup base with a flour roux, milk and broth and added the pureed corn and chipotle and heated. Then I ladled into bowls and added the toppings. It ended up being more of a bisque, but still tasty.

sounded like it would be good. failed to notice the recipe was no-cook before purchasing the ingredients. didn't impress me too much. i'm not really against cold soups but this REALLY didn't do it for me. sick to my stomach. cheeseburger please.

Every recipe has someone's "taste" in it and some of this fit mine. Too much ancho for me but I liked most of the pairings. I will make it again and make a few changes but isn't that what we do to most recipes? Adapt it to our taste? I will find "my" version and make it for my customers this summer.

recipe calls for far too much chile chilpotle. Ground chili ancho is the recommended for seasoning.A bisque should be delicate not over powering the seafood. Your guests should be able to savour the soup. Chicken stock? No, fish stock. Also, one should never use cumin seeds, they sell ground cumin, use it. Add the avocado in strips just before serving. What's with the chopped coriander? Obviously written by someone with absolutely no knowledge of la cocina mexicana trying to put in every mexican food cliche there is. If you wish to serve chile chilpotle, then put it on the table in a dish. I served seafood bisque every Friday in my restaurant, "Sombreros" and it sold out every night. Retired Mexican chef.

I think the confusion is that the recipe doesn't state that this is s cold soup, but it is. There is nothing unsafe about not cooking this soup, as mentioned below. Broth has already been cooked as well as the crab and is perfectly safe to eat.

I made this soup because I love all the ingredients involved: lime, avocado, crab, cilantro, chipolte peppers. But I agree with the previous reviewer; the lime and zest is WAY too overpowering. I will try one zest and two limes next time. I also recommend to puree the soup for quite a while to break down the corn kernels. I did not previously cook anything, and although it may be nice warmed, it was also refreshing cold. The crab mixture was very good!

I have not tried this yet, but I am also confused by the absence of cooking. I am going to give it a go and let you know.

Like the previous reviews state, this recipe is incomplete. Not sure who reviews these before they are posted, but you are not a food person. For starters the recipe does not call for cooking the broth. Not a food safe method. Second, the zest and juice of 4 limes is overkill, completely overpowers the other ingredients. I halved the zest and it was still to much. I would recommend the zest of one lime/juice of two and replacing some of the chicken stock with whipping cream or half and half. The broth will not hold the corn hulls in suspension.

I definitely would prepare in advance. After blending the ingredients indicated, cover and chill for a minimum of one hour. Fill chilled bowls and garnish with crab meat, etc.as recipe suggests.

Fresh, light and delicious chilled. Serve with warm tortilla chips for a lovely contrast.

This sounds luscious but when and what do you heat? It goes from blender to bowl and the rest is added to the bowl. Is it meant to be served cold? That would be really yucky, it seems to me.

Should this be served heated, chilled, or at room temperature? Seems as though these instructions were overlooked.
