My husband and I are broccoli lovers but both of us found this unpalatable. Definitely will not make this again.

Really good. I doubled the dressing recipe to really get good coverage. You don't need nearly so much oil either. I cut it in half and added roasted red peppers.

Lovely and flavorful. I realized at the last minute that I had no sherry vinegar, so I substituted a tablespoon of seasoned rice vinegar and a half-tablespoon of Harvey's Bristol Cream. I also sauteed the croutons in MUCH less oil than indicated, then poured the excess into my shake-bottle and added fresh oil to the amount needed to balance the vinegar mixture. That avoided the extra oiliness without sacrificing flavor, and the croutons were also quite crisp. I also used a 7-grain bread for the croutons, which added interesting depth to the flavors.

I made the dressing using only 3 T of olive oil and left out the croutons. Otherwise, the recipe was followed as written. Very nice way to serve broccoli. Next time I would consider adding some chopped roasted red peppers.

Delicious, even without the croutons. Perhaps a bit too salty, but a great dressing.

I thought the dressing was delicious, though maybe a bit too oily.

I served this at a barbecue and everyone loved it.
