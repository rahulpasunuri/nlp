My go-to apple crisp recipe for years. Quick, easy, tasty. Add 1- 1.5 C of chopped fresh cranberries to apple mixture. Grannys and Fujis both work well. The recipe provides more of the crumbled topping than I can use in a 3 Qt. rectangular dish. There may be a better recipe out there.. but why? This wins.

Try adding cranberries to this... the bright flavor of the cranberries is just right for this amount of sugar and cinnamon. I have been making it this way for years.

This is a great crowd pleaser. Went apple picking and needed to use the apples up. Save time ... don't toast the walnuts. Just place them on top. Shhhh, I had to hide some of this batch in the freezer, that is how good it is.

I substituted oat flour and organic cane sugar and found the topping to be much lighter and tastier. This is a wonderful recipe.

I am eating this as I type. It is perfect. The classic apple crisp without any unnecessary frills. I used a mix of Fuji, Granny Smith, and Braeburn apples. One of the apples did get a little mushy (I think it was the Braeburns) but it gave it a nice mix of textures/flavors. I did forget to add the walnuts to the crumble, so I just sprinkled them on top and then needed to cover with foil part way through so the walnuts didn't burn. When I make it again I will follow the recipe exactly; it doesn't need any alterations. Yum!

If I made this a second time, I'd use Granny Smiths. The Galas didn't have enough flavor or texture.

Fantastic flavor from a great recipe and fantastic apples from the farmer's market. I had the same problem as a few others with the crust - it wasn't evenly crispy. I think next time I'll add more butter.. or make sure it's spread out more evenly.

Yummy especially with the apples from my father-in-law's tree!

I forgot to rate! Also, does anyone have any experience with making this in advance (the day before)? Do the apples turn brown?

I made two batches of this to sell at a coffee house and it was a huge hit. I have to make three batches next time! I added the finely grated zest of a lemon (one lemon for each batch) to my apples (gala) and got lots of compliments on the wonderful apple flavor. Also, added a bit of nutmeg to the topping. I used my stand mixer to mix the topping. It was quick and easy.

The second time I made this recipe I put the crisps into (12) individual ramekins. That was an easy way to serve for a crowd. All the hostress had to do was top the crisps with the ice cream and serve.

This crisp turned out great! I assembled this early in the day and put it in the fridge - baked it after dinner and it came out great - I did need more cooking time than suggested, but I think the apples were probably a pretty firm variety - I was at a family member's house so I don't know what kind they were.

It was pretty dry and not as flavorful as other crisps I've made

This is an absolutely delicious, satisfying apple crisp. However, the ratio of topping to apples is a little heavy on the topping. I would add more apples. Since the granulated sugar was missing from the ingredients list, I added only a couple of tablespoons of sugar to the apples--they were perfect with the very sweet topping (though I also reduced the brown sugar by 1/8 cup). Make sure you have some ice cream or whipped cream on hand!

You forgot to add the granulated sugar...it is 1/2 cup to roll the apples and lemon juice with...it makes all the differance in the world...the brown sugar is for the crisp part and should be mixed with the flour and the butter and spices

I keep making this and everytime I get the recipe out I forget that it doesn't give the amount of granulated sugar to add to the apples. I guess I "wing" it everytime. This time I used 1/2 cup of granulated and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and I always cut up more apples than the recipe calls for. I like a really thick layer of apples and they do cook down. Anyway, it always turns out fantastic and I wouldn't change a thing. For the few times per year I consume this it's well worth the calories and fat. I'll work it off with a little more intense workout tomorrow.

Addictive. Due to everyone's barking about the fat content I made a modified version of the topping with 2 sticks of butter, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1 cup of flour, 1 scant cup of oats, pecans instead of walnuts (I had them on hand), and spices. Was a freakload of topping - more than enough to appease even those most craving of topping. Healthier too. Was really incredibly good (and fyi, the modified topping I made would make a good cookie too.)

This is a winter staple at my house. I make them in ramekins for my husband and I so they are easy to re-heat. Add a little cheddar cheese when serving, and heaven!!!

I followed the recipe to the letter however it did not turn out. The topping did not cook well. It was too dry and not very tasty. Luckily my family is not picky and still ate it!

To those of you who noted the omission of the amount of sugar to be added to the apples...I actually have a clipping of the published recipe from the magazine. It specifies " 4 1/2 tablespoons of granulated sugar, or to taste" - probably about right, taking into account the amount of sugar in the topping. This recipe is very close to another good recipe, Old-Fashioned Apple Crisp (in Ina Garten's Barefoot Contessa Parties cookbook), less the nuts.

The instructions ask for granulated sugar, yet in the ingredients part, no sugar is mentioned. I added 1 1/2 cups sugar to the apple mixture, and it was fine.

Hey St. Louis.... You are on the wrong website! This is for GOURMET RECIPES. If you want something less fattening go find a recipe on weight watcher's site!! By the way, No one is forcing you to eat it!

This is THE BEST apple crisp I have ever made, and I have made lots in the past, I made mine with Granny Smith apples, the texture and taste is perfect, and the top bakes out just perfectly...try this apple crisp!

This is pretty good but needs more cinnamon and perhaps some nutmeg. I used very flavorful Jonagold apples and that is what saved the recipe as it is. I also used a 7x11" baking pan, as a 10"ie plate would have overflowed.

This is the one.Perfect.I wouldn't change a thing, but the calvados idea intrigues me.....

Rating: 3
I love this recipe and have been making it for a couple years now and am about to make it again for my father's birthday (he's an apple crisp fanatic and this is his favorite). I do add a bit of Calvados (if I have some) to the apples and usually skip the last sugar and flour addition and just mix a little of the crisp mixture with the apples. I also bake it in a large ceramic bowl rather than a baking dish (that way you can fit all of the apples in). As far as the top not being crispy enough, maybe the baking time is a bit short - mine is always crispy, but I have to increase the time in the oven anyway because of the bowl. Yum!

I used 3/4 c. of sugar to the apples and all my guests raved. The topping wasn't as crispy as the apple crisp at Lou's Salty Sea in Deerfield but it was a great hit anyway you eat it!

I also had trouble fitting that many apples in the specified size dish so my first advice would be to use less apples. I used a variety of tart baking apples and only added about 2 tblsp. of sugar to the apples. I liked the tartness since the topping is so sweet already. Also, 45 minutes was about 10 minutes too long for the wedge size of apples; so either cut your apples thicker or watch your time in the oven after about 30 minutes. I had my doubts about using my fingertips to mix the topping thinking it would all just glob up with the warmth of my hands but it didn't. I used pecans instead because that's all I had and I didn't toat them because I figured they'd "toast" enough in the oven. Good call, I think. Next time I might add a little cinnamon to the apples as well. Overall, a good basic recipe.

I don't want to dampen the enthusiasm of those who loved this recipe, but I found it mediocre at best. The "crisp" topping was not nearly crisp enough for my taste, and the filling was nothing special. Because the amount of sugar was omitted, I sweetened the apples as I would for a pie, taking into account the sweetness of the apples I was using. I also added a bit of nutmeg, but the filling was still quite bland and dry. I think 3 tablespoons of lemon juice is too much for the quantity of apples, and perhaps the flour should have been halved as well. Finally, I used exactly the quantity of apples specified, but I could barely fit them into a 9x13x2" pan. To each his/her own, when it comes to fruit crisps, but this one left me disappointed.

Just think if the "cook" from St Louis criticizes this recipe what she must be saying about all the other wonderful desserts - wow! This is a wonderful recipe which we eat in moderation - simple, huh?

I would definitely make this again!!! It's the best I have ever made. It was easy and most delicious! I was out to find the Ultimate Apple Crisp recipe and this is a KEEPER. I must also add my 2 cents to St. Louis. You should not criticize, If you are doing Weight Watchers, What are you doing on this site anyways, in the dessert section no less??? Weight Watchers has their own cookbooks with yummy and tasteful desserts. I have also done WW.

Thanks to all the food-police comments. Looking for a sinful crisp recipe and given the hoopla, I think this may be it! Anything with this much reaction must be decadent indeed.

This crisp was awesome! So what about all the butter; that's what dessert is all about. It's not like you have a steady diet of it. Best apple crisp I've made. I even froze it for later and warmed it in the oven.

I really have to say something to all you "cooks" who feel it necessary to reduce the calorie content or complain about it if you don't reduce it. It is a dessert! Not an Atkins boxed special. Im happy to say im 5'3 and 97 pounds and I love to eat dessert, without making it low fat every night. Oh, by the way Jax, that isn't how you spell truly. Thank you

I saved this recipe in January 2004 in my Epicurious recipe box and printed a copy as well. When I couldn't find my printed copy in July 2004, I printed a new copy and then found the original. I discovered the recipe's ingredients and amounts and instrcutions had totally changed and realized this recipe has the same name of the previously run recipe and replaced it. I haven't made the 2nd version...but was so pleased with the 1st version I will probably stick with it. I'm happy I had the original copy. But, beware of possible loss of favorite recipes!

Half the time I look for recipes I will follow it word for word. With desserts I try and redo recipes to be more low carb compliant. This is a great recipe that I have used more or less for many years. Today I used splenda and stevia in place of sugar and used half the flour and Atkins baking mix for the other half. It's not truely low carb but alot better than regular flour and sugar. My family wanted to try it before I got it in the oven because it smelled so good! Blessings Shelly

Excuse me but I have never felt so prompted to add my 2 cents as I did after seeing comments from the cook from St. Louis. We are all adults here and are solely responsible for what we eat. To blame the website is completely ignorant - no I will not even give that much credit since that means one does not know better. I live in a part of the world where women eat livestock feed to look fat which translates to wealth and importance. This recipe gives the reader ingredients and amounts - you do the math. If you can't, I suggest you move on.

This recipe is missing the granulated sugar amount. I made the Crisp using Gala and Granny Smith apples and one half cup of sugar. It was just perfect. Depending on the tartness of the apples, I would say use one half to one cup granulated sugar tossed with the apples. You will not be disappointed!

To the "cook" from St. Louis, MO, I have to ask: What the hell are you doing even reading recipes relative to such a subject? Most of us do not indulge in such a treat daily. Moderation is the key. To everyone else, enjoy occasionally.

This dessert was the perfect ending to a hearty Christmas dinner! I forgot to butter the baking dish and it still turned out perfectly. The guests were elbowing each other to get seconds. I served the crisp warm with freshly whipped heavy cream (not the kind from a can). It also tasted great reheated the next day. This one is a definite success!

Of course this recipe is BRILLIANT and gets 100% ratings. Why? Yes naturally the BUTTER..all 3/4 cups of it. We all know the easy secret to gourmet cooking is BUTTER...now the healthy challenge begins....how to make it equally delicious with less fat....probably impossible....I challenge everyone to try and let us know your results.

Of course this is good!! All the butter! And sugar! And huge portion size! If you can afford 700 calories and 34 grams of fat - that's without whipped or ice cream - go for it. I love Gourmet/Bon Appetit and though 5'8" and 125 pounds got/stay that way with Weight Watchers. I've learned to regularly enjoy rich desserts rather than 'depriving' myself. But printing recipes like this without nutrition information is unconscionable. Thank you, Gourmet, for your contribution to our national obesity crisis.

Really, really, really great! A nice fall dessert that was enjoyed by all (and makes the house smell great while cooking). I used about 2 Tblspns of granualted sugar with the apples, since the recipe did not specify an amount, and it came out perfect. Also added some cinnamon to the apples. Will definately make again over the holidays.

I was delighted with the recipe from ease of preparation to the terrific taste. There is plenty of "crisp" to cover the dish. I covered the dish with foil after 20 minutes to prevent burning, so watch it. All I'd add next time would be cinnamon and nutmeg to the fruit mixture. It got great raves from guests. We had the leftovers for breakfast. Even cheap apples worked great. Thanks, Gourmet magazine.
