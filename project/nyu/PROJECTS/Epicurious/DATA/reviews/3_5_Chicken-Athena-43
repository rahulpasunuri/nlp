I wanted to give this 3.5 stars, as another reviewer had also wished . . . because this dish is superb (if not quite the 4-star "exceptional"). I used both aniseed and ouzo -- but was surprised at how ultimately subtle the licorice flavoring was. VERY good -- and makes great leftovers. Cooking Notes: I used the typical boneless/skinless chicken breasts and just cooked them in the tomato mixture for about 10 minutes before going on to next stages of recipe. Also, reducing the sauce took about 5 minutes longer than indicated.

Great weeknight dinner. Did not have the aniseseed, and the recipe was fine without. We served this over angelhair pasta and it was delish.

I liked the simplicity of the dish for a weeknight dinner. I made a couple of adjustments (out of necessity) and the dish worked well. I used chicken thighs to great success. I only had a 14 oz can of diced tomoates, so I used it, but at the end before serving, I sprinked a cup of grape tomatoes on top and broiled the chicken until crisped up and the tomatoes had popped. It freshed up the dish nicely---I'd stick with this method because the sauce was light and not too canned tomato-like. I topped off with the goat cheese and some minced fresh parsley and served over orzo. I made orzo according to package instructions, but after I drained it I added salt, pepper, fresh parsley and 2 T of cream.

Delicious! And I didn't even have an liquorice liquor, so I just used white wine instead. I think I prefer a more subtle anise flavor anyways, so this worked out well.

A delicious meal and so easy to prepare. The kitchen had a lovely liquorice scent all evening!

This recipe is a definite "keeper". Easy and delicious.I add a bit more Ouzo and a few more olives.

Actually, I'd give it 3.5 forks if I could. I love the ingredients in this dish and it turned out exactly as I hoped. Great! Not too hard to make and really yummy. This goes in my recipe box. The ouzo and the anise give it a really interesting flavor and if it's possible to use too much feta, I'll never believe it.

I didn't have any ouzo or aniseed, so I thought using staranise would solve that problem. It was a bit of a disappointment but I'm definitely going to try it again with the right ingredients because I know this is something special. I served it with Feta and Mint Rice which was a nice accompaniment.

This dish was full of such rich flavor. It took a little longer to cook, but the result was great. I will definitely make again.

Have made this twice and loved it each time.

Popular with every member of the family when I made it. I doubled the recipe and let the chicken cook quite a bit longer - as I don't like rare chicken. The Sauce also took twice as long to reduce. Next time I'll use more Ouzo as one couldn't taste it - think the feta overpowers it. I'd also use more olives as there weren't many for all the chicken.

Good and easy. I cooked it longer than the recipe recommended. Good leftover too.

the recipe was simple and quick and a good use for the pernod i wanted to use up. I added an onion to saute with the garlic and poured cooked orzo in at the end. It was great with 4 large skinless chicken breasts split in two.

I did this chicken for a buffet dinner party of foodies and got heaps of compliments. The next time I will double the Ouzo, however. Pretty darn good the next day as well-maybe even better but alas the company was gone!

I cut back on the aniseed and added 3/4 c. slivered red onion and more olives. I cooked a pound of penne and added it to the whole dish at the end since there is plenty of great sauce. My husband went nuts. It was so easy and would be great for guests.

A great company dish. If you like the taste of licorice and you like chicken you will love this dish! Actually it is a great blend of flavors and the feta tops it off very well.

Made this last night, and I was disappointed. The anise flavor was a bit too strong. Maybe the combination of the anise seed and the ouzo. It was like black jelly bean chicken. Just my honest opinion and the first four fork recipe I made that wasn't well received.

I used 8 skinned chicken thighs (kept warm in oven) and because I already had Sambuca liquor, which is also anise, this is what I used in place of Ouzo, etc. Worked great. Will definitely be a dish for dinner parties.

The aniseed/ouzo make this dish very distinctive. I've made it three times and it was a big hit each time.

Of all the Epicurious recipes I have prepared, this one is by far the yummiest!! I will make it again and again! The orzo, tossed with a good virgin olive oil and some fresh black pepper is a great accompaniment.

A delicious dish, easy to make! Definitely make again and add to my personal recipes.

Very Very good! We have served it to various friends and they all loved it - even those who "don't like anise liqueur". The flavor of the Pernod doesn't overpower at all, but just adds to the overall fantastic flavor. Be sure to serve it with the orzo.

Delicious and easy to make. With practice, you will be able to deliver this to the table in half an hour. Also very low in fat - a weekday dinner that tastes like real cuisine. Next time I'm going to add some fennel and serve it with french bread and roasted garlic.....
