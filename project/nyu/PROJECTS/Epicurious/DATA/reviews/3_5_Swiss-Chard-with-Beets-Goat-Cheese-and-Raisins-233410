Amazing recipe. Added the beet greens to the swiss chard. Omitted the jalapenos and lime juice. Presents beautifully and adds color to holiday table. This recipe is keeper and certainly one that will be passed down through the generations. Thanks Epicurious!

I wish I would have used feta cheese as some others have suggested. Also, did not parboil the chard leaves. I just added them a little sooner to the stalks and it was just fine. Saved a step and a pot to clean!

This was an outstanding recipe mirroring an exclusive restaurant meal....minor changes made: substituted mango salsa (1 cup)- the tomatoes called for would have had,in my opinion, made the dish less palatable, dark raisens, and herbed goat cheese.....with the abundance of these vegetables in the garden, this will be made frequently - thank you!!!!

I drizzled it with truffle oil, which was really delicious! I may try it without the raisins though and used tomato paste instead of tomatoes, which gave it a perfect consistency.

I used fresh tomatoes, and it was still a tad soupy. I would use more beets next time. Great tasty way to use up chard. The raisins are nice and it's good cold the next day.

Wonderful flavors. I didn`t use tomatoes (allergy). I added toasted pine nuts and everyone loved it!

simplified, it was great! diced beets before roasting with olive oil at 425 til soft. meanwhile, sauteed garlic then added chopped beet greens and chopped, de-ribbed kale (that's what we had). softened raisins in hot water til plump. salted greens. mixed it all well and topped generously with goat cheese. mm, delicious!!

The flavor, it floored me it was so good. We used beet greens in stead of the Swiss chard, and sauteed the greens before adding the toms, not boiled.

Gorgeous. A lot of work - but spectacular. I think I would like the feta - thought it could use a little salt and the feta would provide that. All you need is some meat or fish and a starch and you have a beautiful meal. Definitely chill the goat cheese before crumbling! Nice holiday dish.

Made this for Christmas dinner--wanted something more interesting than simple green beans, etc. I thought it was wonderful; lots of flavors, each one of them great. I loved the slightly spicy kick from the pepper as balanced by the sweetness of the raisins. I didn't use a jalapeno (I got nervous when the sign at the supermarket warned me to use gloves), so I got a regular old green hot pepper (can't remember which kind, but was described as "medium to hot"). It was plenty hot for me, and I used half the amount prescribed. Also, since I cut the recipe in half, I used one can of tomatoes and a single roma. The biggest surprise with this dish was my bf's response: I expected him to hate it (green stuff? with beets?!) but I got a thumbs up from him. "I like it... it doesn't taste like salad!" So, it's a winner in my book. Although, I'm not sure it needed the goat cheese (which I typically love). I'll try it with feta tomorrow...

Wonderful. Used an abundance of rainbow chard, but cut back the tinned tomato suggested in the recipe, opted for a mix of tinned and fresh tomato so it wasn't as liquid heavy. I forgot to add the lime juice, but did add cinnamon, fleur de sel, fresh basil and crushed Moroccan olives. Lovely and beautiful to serve.

An odd mix of ingredients but a wonderful combination of flavors. A similar recipe called for a bit of smoked paprika (not too much!) which I added and thought was good. End result IS soupy; use slotted soup or even a colander when transferring to platter. If you're not having 10 + for dinner, halve the recipe. And use fresh tomatoes if you're making it in summer!

Not a fan of this at ALL. It tasted peculiar yet bland...very strange.

CSA share had Chard and beets with greens this week. Used it all. Also used the canned tomatoes with chilis in them...other than that made it JUST as written. It was INCREDIBLE! My husband and I went back for large seconds and are looking forward to leftovers.

I decided to try this recipe since I had somechard growing in the garden as wellasbeets. Thecombination of flavors is excellent. The goar cheese ended up melting into the whole dish, but really added a nice creaminess. I amplannningonmaking it as a side dish for the July 4th. We had it cold at lunch the next day and it seemed the flavors were even etter!

We liked this lots. I'm not a particularly big fan of beets or chard, but my husband is so I made it for him and it was really good. Lots of work, though.

We love this recipe. Makes a huge amount. Can use canned (for convenience) or yellow beets, too. Very colorful and great for our vegetarian friends.

This tasted great, but came out rather soupy. I recommend really draining the tomatoes. Other than that, a great dish. Oh, and I used dried currants instead of raisins...yummy.

I was ready for my guests to either love or hate this dish, as the reviews indicated. Everyone loved it, and I was asked for the recipe.

Yuch. That's all I can say.

I used about 2/3 of the beets and 1/3 of the chard. Also used a sweet white onion and cut the garlic, tomatoes and lime down. I used currants instead of golden raisens. So really I used the recipe as a guideline more than a recipe. It had a good taste, my hubby who usually doesn' t care for beets said he liked the dish and would enjoy it again. I was only so so on it.

GREAT! I boiled my beets becasue I didn't have the oven available. Great. LOve the goat cheese, and I used more then called. Makes a lot, so yo will probably have leftovers. I added the cheese to individual plates so it would melt when heating up the leftovers.

A really great recipe. Colorful, delicious and good for you! I used a bit more raisins and pine nuts (toasted - because I love them) and only one can of tomatoes. I skipped the lime juice or the jalepenos.

I'm not a beet fan OR a swiss chard fan but I LOVED this dish. I have a neighbor who is very generous with his gardens bounty and I didn't have the heart to say "yuck"! It makes a ton of food - I halved it and there was enough for eight. Didn't need much oil, so I would say it is quite healthy.

Ick! I don't know what I did wrong, but mine certainly looked nothing like the picture. Tomatoes and beets? It looked bad tasted the same. Perhaps delicious without the beets? Sorry... This is my first official Epicurious loser.

Yes yes on the feta! A wonderful "substitute" for goat cheese. Also, for those of you who happen to come home starving and wanting to eat before 2 hours later, I HIGHLY recommend baking the beets the night before and having them ready to go when you come home to prepare the chard fresh the next day. Also, this worked delightfully inside little pita pockets. Delicious!

this is by far the most flavorful vegetable dish I have ever prepared. Don't be intimidated by the number of ingredients - it is completely worth a little prep effort for the satisfaction you will get from your guest's amazement. The only alteration I made was to substitute toasted pepitas (pumpkin seeds) for the pine nuts because of nut allergies.

This was very good, I would skip blanching the beet leaves though, totally unneccessary! Just rinse and cook in the pan

This is the second time I've made this dish, and I find the flavors stupendous!!! I belong to a CSA farm, and needed a recipe that included beets, green onions, and chard- Voila! I include kale and the beet greens along with the chard/stems. I used salsa in place of the diced tomatos and the flavor was fine. I followed another reviewer and used feta instead of goat cheese. This is a stellar recipe for seasonal produce and I plan to share this with my CSA members.

Used my own discretion with portions. A lot less chard. Substituted feta for goat cheese. Dried cherries for raisins. Good at room temp. Great the next day warmed up on couscous. Not a home run with husband but then, not much I cook is! (He's the chef in the house.)

I agree that the stated amount of chard is overkill - I used about 2 average sized bumches plus the greens from the beets, going down to 3/4 C raisins - that made enough for 6-8 servings. I added some crumbled blue to the goat cheese since blue goes so very well with beets. I did not have the pine nuts or jalepenos - that was fine. Added a pinch of hot pepper flakes. Added all of the raisins in for the cooking as they are sweeter that way. One of the best chard recipes I have tried!

Made this for guests and it was FANTASTIC! Got rave reviews. Will definitely make again. I served the dish at room temperature and added the pine nuts, 2 TB raisins and goat cheese just before serving. Delicious and gorgeous to look at. One caveat--4 lbs of chard makes a HUGE amount--much more than 12 servings. Next time I will cut the recipe in half.

I made this for Christmas dinner. It was wonderful! However, I put a little extra lime juice in it & it was too much. The second day, it was outstandingly delicious!! If it had tasted like that the first day, I would have given it 4 stars. In fact, when I make it again, I will make it a day ahead since the flavors blend beautifully. It truly can be served warm, room temperature or cold, which makes it very versitile, especially for a large dinner where everyone is bringing a different course (as we were Christmas). The only other thing I would change would be to keep the goat cheese refrigerated until you actually crumble on the top so that it will crumble instead of be creamy blobs; maybe a different goat cheese would have a drier texture. Would probably work w/a mild feta as well. Had an outstanding flavor anyway.
