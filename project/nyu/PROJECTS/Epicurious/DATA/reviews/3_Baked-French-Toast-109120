I followed the recipe exactly as written and the results were not good. It came out as slices of soggy toast baked into a dish of sweet scrambled eggs. Like another reviewer, I turned the entire mass upside down onto another tray and baked for another 40 minutes just to make it edible. There are better french toast and better bread pudding recipes listed on this website.

An added note: I used 1 1/2 Tablespoons of the Vanilla Bean Paste (a recommendation from another reviewer) and I do think that made a big difference in the flavor...Also used it in the whipped cream...

My boyfriend asked me to make him French Toast for breakfast this morning, and I wanted to make him something a little more special than just plain ol' French Toast...I found this recipe and made it with Cinnamon Raisin Bread (his favorite), added Apple Pie spice and used Vanilla Bean Paste instead of regular extract. I topped it with real Maple Syrup, freshly-made whipped cream, and blackberries...it was delicious! I baked it at the 425 degrees in a convection oven and it puffed up perfectly, had the ultimate balance between bread and custard...(I used 12 slices of bread, dried in the oven as it preheated, since I didn't have day-old bread to use.) I was able to slice up the leftovers into individual servings, so he can bring them with him to work next week. This is definitely a keeper-recipe. He has already asked me to make it for company, and to make it for his little granddaughter when she comes to visit. I'm not sure how this didn't work out for some of the other reviewers. I know that the oven temperature is key, so maybe double check the temps and use the convection feature if you have one.

NASTY! I usually have good results when I read the other reviews...Not this time. Cooked @ 1 hour still soggy. It was like well done sweet scrambled eggs on the bottom. Yuck.

Very yummy. I did make some mods, though. Added cinnamon, nutmeg and a little fresh orange zest. Assembled the night before and baked in the morning. Also baked a little longer than recommended, to get a nice crunch on top and take care of the soggies. We loved it.

I used sandwich bread and forgot to add the sugar until after it baked. This was still delicious. I think this is a regular weekday breakfast from now on.

This is a good, simple recipe for baked french toast. I added a couple of teaspoons of cinnamon and a half teaspoon of nutmeg. I also used one cup of half and half and two cups of 1% milk to no ill effect.

Really delicious and very easy. I used a loaf of french bread and it was puffed and golden when it came out of the oven. Everyone loved it.

Made this for a quickie brunch and loved how beautifully it baked - puffed almost like a souffle. Lots of oohs and aahs but to be truthful... this is a bread pudding recipe if I ever saw one!

Are you guys kidding? This is absolutely terrific, with only the addition of nutmeg, which in my opinion is key, and/or cinnamon. I also use powdered vanilla as opposed to the extract, which I don't like. I serve it with sliced strawberries, creme anglaise (or at least cream with sugar and powdered vanilla) and good-quality maple syrup. Other good fruits are bananas, peaches, berries of any kind, and of course any mixture of the above. Divine.

I didn't really care for this. All the custard sunk to the bottom, and I ended up having to flip it (as one huge french toast mass) to really get it cooked. It definitely takes longer than 30 min to cook. I also did not like the extra sugar-it makes the french toast cloyingly sweet. My boyfriend declared he liked it, but he would probably eat cardboard if I put butter and syrup on it.

This was great! I used Cinnamon Twist bread from Semifreddi's. It was easy and good! I'm going to remember this one for Christmas and substitute the sugar & milk for eggnog. Enjoy!

This recipe was very easy to make, can feed about 4-5 people, and most of all was DELICIOUS. Tasted great! Make sure you cook it long enough to make the French Toast non-soggy.

This basic recipe lends itself to endless variations. It works with skim milk, brown sugar instead of white, a couple of pinches of cinnamon or nutmeg in the custard, blueberries sprinkled on top before baking, a large round country loaf, and overnight soaking. With skim milk it's virtually fat free.

I made this for my husband for Father's Day and we both loved it! It was easy and delicious. I am making it again for a family brunch this weekend.

As is, this recipe is a good base, but hardly palatable - the vanilla flavor is barely present. Next time I will warm the milk with a split, scraped vanilla bean before adding the eggs. I would also recommend adding any of the following: golden raisins, currants, dried cherries, blueberries or orange zest to the custard base, or cinnamon/nutmeg. Otherwise you simply end up with a flavorless bread pudding. Yuck.

This doesn't look like it will work-- little pieces of bread swimming around in a big pan, lots of liquid -- but it DOES, especially if you put it together the night before, using the baguette left over from dinner. For variation, throw in a few blueberries, frozen or fresh, just before baking.

Generally, it is a better idea to rate the recipe AFTER you've made it.

This was a big, big hit for a weekend breakfast. Easy to make and tasted great. We used a good quality baguette.

This was ok. It basically tasted exactly like french toast (we put maple syrup on ours). I added a good sprinkle of cinnamon to the top before letting it sit for 30 minutes. I also used a much smaller dish than what was recommended. I think this would be a nice addition to a brunch buffet table, where you would be able to select a couple of things. I would not want to eat this as the main dish. (P.S. my kids absolutely loved this, of course!)
