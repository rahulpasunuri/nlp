i roasted my garlic with the eggplant - very good. and i cut the vinegar in 1/2. i added a little flat leaf parsley and definitely used less than 1/2 of the oil. not restaurant quality but pretty yummy!

I mashed the garlic in a mortar with sea salt, and omitted the walnuts as this recipe is often made without. Next time will roast the garlic alongside the eggplant for milder flavor. Delicious on the toasted pita accompanied by a Greek salad for a great vegetarian summer supper.
