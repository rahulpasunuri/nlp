I won't rate the recipe as is because I tweaked it a fair amount. I used 1/4 c of vermouth and about a 1/3 c of OJ and reduced it by at least half. I then added about 1-2 teaspoons of orange zest with a pinch of onion powder. Then melted in gradually about 6-8 T butter. I used it on gilled lobster and it was delicious.

I did not make that recipe but being quite familiar with the beurre blanc technique, I can see that the very important reduction step has been skipped in the recipe. The liquid should be reduced by at least 3/4 before whipping in the butter.

? to Cook from Washington. Where did you come up with 6 cups of liquid when the total between the vermouth and oj equals 3/4c? Must having been sipping the vermouth while reading the recipe!!!

This recipe is PREPOSTEROUS, and was obviously never prepared by the editor prior to publication. To actually make it work, cut the vermouth IN HALF, and double the amount of orange zest. Then, boil the liquid to reduce by at least half. 3T of butter will NEVER turn 6 cups of liquid into anything remotely resembling Hollandaise sauce. Be sure to serve on blazing hot plates, otherwise it will cool to room temperature in 60 seconds.

All the ingredients sounded so good in this recipe. Niether my husband or I liked it. It was a disappointment. Perhaps I did something wrong. The sauce was not the rich, tasty flavor I thought it should be. It was also a little thin. I won't try it again.

I thought it was terrible! The orange zest amounts were not enough, it wasn't savory enough, and the suggested vermouth quantity was overpowering. I'm definitely not making this again.

I doubled the recipe (serves 4)and additionally used old bay seasoning while simmering the shells. This recipe rates on top along with my scampi.
