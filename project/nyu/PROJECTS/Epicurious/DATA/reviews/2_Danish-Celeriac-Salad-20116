I didn't try this because I so love celeriac in a traditional vinaigrette! Just make sure to cut the celeriac in very thin julienne strips.

Very interesting. I had it along with soup. I would recommend, as suggested having it with meats or a larger variety of foods, it's not something you would want as THE main salad, as I did. I made the following changes...I grated the celeriac and added a small amount of white vinegar to give it some zing, as well as some dried tarragon. Give it a try!
