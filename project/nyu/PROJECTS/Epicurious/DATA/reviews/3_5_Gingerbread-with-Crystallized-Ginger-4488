I have been making this for years and look forward to fall and holidays so I can make it. The cake is quite moist and the flavor has a kick. I've never had to adjust anything, although I'm going to try adding the chopped crystallized ginger on top the next time.

I baked this in three mini loaves (for 32 minutes) and they turned out beautifully. I did replace the pear nectar with 1/2 cup of unsweetened apple sauce, and mixed about 2/3 of the crystallized ginger into the batter with the remainder sprinkled on top as suggested by others. Very tasty, not too sweet, good gingerbread.

An annual favourite to return to every winter. The recipe is a good one _ I doubled it without problems. Two modifications that may be of interest: 1. Use applesauce and add nectar to make thick liquid. Keeps the cake moist. 2. Scatter the chopped ginger across the surface of the batter (did this because I had forgotten to add it before pouring into the pan). It stays afloat and adds a visual element.

I thought this was a very nice gingerbread cake, but I modified the recipe to make it into a breakfast muffin. I decreased the both sugars (dark brown and molasses) by 3x, then added lots of chopped apples to the batter. Also, doubled the amount of crystallized ginger and omitted the pear nectar. Ended up with a not-too-sweet and very nice combination of gingerbread cake and apple muffin. Highly recommended!

My cake "fell" despite careful effort. Still, I served it to friends, and they loved it. I will try it one more time.

Really good! Super easy to make and delicious to eat. I substituted plain old apple sauce for the pear nectar and instead of mixing the candied ginger in, I chopped it and sprinkled over the top before baking. This made a totally yummy topping, and made whipped cream (and all those calories) unnecessary. Yum!

Excellent recipe!! Thanks to Denver, CO (21MAR00) for the suggestion to sprinkle additional ginger on the top. It was wonderful. I didn't have pear nectar so substituted fresh, unsweetened apple juice.

Tihs was the worst tasting gingerbread I have ever tasted. The crystallized ginger just sunk to the bottom and was way too strong when you bit into a chunk.

Despite prior reviews, I left the sugar alone, since I like sweet gingerbread. I didn't have any pear nectar, so I diced an apple to make 1/2 cup, and then filled in the "spaces" around the apple pieces in the measuring cup with water. Only change I'll make is to increase the amount of crystallized ginger. This was great!

I used half the sugar based on previous reviews. Scrumptious!

This is the best gingerbread I have had. We have this issue of Bon Appetit, and I have been making this since 1997. I look forward to the fall and winter just to use this recipe. This time instead of going through back issues, I found it on line.

it didn't turn out to be as big a cake as 16 servings but it was good. Wouldn't hurt to punch up the spices a bit more either, but good over all.

Very nice - light and cakey but not dry gingerbread - I'm sure it would still be good w/out the candied ginger or even with a lot more ginger. I used oj instead of pear nectar since so many reviews thought it was too sweet.

This is a superb gingerbread. The balance of sweet and spicy was just right although I used homemade pear nectar which was not as sweet as store bought. The crystalized ginger creates yummy surprises with a little bite. I served it with a bittersweet chocolate sauce, vanilla ice cream and pear compote. Everyone devoured it. Yum!!

I thought this gingerbread was cloyingly sweet. Next time I make it I will cut out the brown sugar.

It's a good cake but next time I'll do it I'll cut on the spices. It's a bit too strong for me.

I've been making this wonderful recipe ever since I received the magazine it was printed in. It is a family favorite. I have changed one thing-I use 1/2 cup crystallized ginger total and mix in 1/4 cup with the batter and sprinkle the top with the additional 1/4 cup (since the ginger that is mixed into the batter sinks to the bottom). It makes a nicer presentation, and I love the extra ginger! Serve this warm and everyone will want seconds. If you need to find crystallized ginger, check out www.penzeys.com , a wonderful source for fresh spices etc. They have wonderful products!

This is the best gingerbread I have ever had! It is so flavorful, an explosion of sweet ginger! The bits of crystallized ginger make it a jewel of a treat!

Wonderful! The cake turned out extremely flavorful and moist. During baking, the cristallized ginger melts and dissovles into the cake. It gives it a great flavor.
