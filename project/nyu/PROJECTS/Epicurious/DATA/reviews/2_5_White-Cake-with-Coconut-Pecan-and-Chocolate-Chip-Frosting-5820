I'm so glad I didn't look at the fork rating. I was looking for a white cake recipe with ingredients I had on hand. I liked the content list. I made the cake with my 12 year old daughter. It was easy and it was absolutely one of the best white cakes I have ever tasted. The texture was light, perfect sized hollow bits throughout--crumbly and moist and perfect for frosting or putting in an ice cream bomb as we did. It was positively terrific-I will make this recipe over and over again. Maybe the previous bakers had self rising flour that was inferior or past its date.

I tried to lighten the cake with cake flour and leaveners after I read the first review claiming the cake was dense. The cake was still very dense, a waste of my time and ingredients. Anyone have a great recipe for white cake?

Did not like the texture of the cake. Seemed to come out a bit dry. I'll stick to German Chocolate cake, thanks!
