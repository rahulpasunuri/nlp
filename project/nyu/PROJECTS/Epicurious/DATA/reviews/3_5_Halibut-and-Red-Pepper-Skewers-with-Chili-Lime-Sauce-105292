I made the sauce as directed. Made skewers with red peppers, onions and added zucchini, but left the halibut to grill as one piece. Brushed both with sauce before grilling. Halibut and veg's were great, especially the onions! I agree with others that the sauce had too much sugar. I will make it again, but instead of sugar will use honey. The honey will be a better binding agent and not as sweet. Also, will cut the sauce recipe in half.

This is a fantastic, light recipe. Great for warm summer nights. I used red onion instead of green onion and had great result. The dipping sauce is yummy!

Definately for those who enjoy sweet sauces. Easy and quick to make. Fairly simple flavors, but not that typical for fish, so adds a slightly interesting touch. Would agree with another reviewer that the skewers are a bad idea. I cooked both halibut and swordfish steaks separately on the grill with grilled whole green onions and larger red pepper pieces. Worth making given the ease, especially for a larger group. Worked well with the "corn and haricots verts in lime shallot butter" recipe.

this is pretty good. very healthy. next time i would cut down on sugar - a little too sweet (i added extra olive oil to cut sweetness). however, you only need a tiny bit of sauce. anyway, not the greatest dish i've ever eaten, but very easy and very healthy. great dinner for the 108 degree weather we had here yesterday!!! served with tomato/blue cheese salad recipe from BA (now that was delicious!)

Whatever you do, don't make the skewers. Halibut is a flaky white fish and unless you treat the skewers with the greatest care, the fish will fall apart and you'll leave half of it on (or in) the grill. Just throw the fish fillet on the grill. The dressing is pretty good, though.

While I agree this was super easy to prepare, and light & refreshing in taste, the dish was just ok. I credit that to the fact we were eating halibut. I did not skewer the fish, grilled with a little sauce, then added sauce when served. I went heavy on the cilantro and doubled the serrano but the lime juice was still too overpowering. Easy, refreshing, but nothing to write home about.

I must have done something wrong because I thought the sauce was bland with a slight sugary taste. Will not make this again.

Perfect blend of sweet, spicy and tartness. Didn't make the skewers -- just grilled halibut steaks and drizzled the sauce over it. Very good and very easy.

I made this dish for my pregnant wife who was craving fish but wanted something "different". She absolutely loved it, as did I! I will make definitely make this again and again. The only thing I did different is use real maple syrup instead of sugar and it was delicious.

This was good, very fresh tasting and very simple with minimal prep. However, I found the sauce to be just a tad bit too oily for my tastes. This has such a light, fresh flavor that hardly any oil is necessary - I think next time I'll use about half as much as what's called for. Was a snap to prepare and clean up, and went well with a simple rice pilaf on the side. Will definitely make again.

If only they had half fork ratings - it really merits a 3.5, not a 3. I used wahoo from our last fishing trip instead of halibut. The sauce complemented it very well, and it was awfully easy to make. Just right for impromptu bbq nights!

Everyone loved the lime sauce. Very light and refreshing. I had extra and was also making chicken so I just added soy sauce and made it into a marinade for the chicken. Delicious

sauce is too sweet, halibut is such a delicate fish, I thought it was overwhelmed by the sauce, (even though I reduced the amount of sugar by one third.) note, my guests did enjoy it, maybe I am too picky...

we ommitted the skewers, onion, and red pepper and just grilled the fish. we marinated it first in olive oil, a bit of white vinegar, salt & pepper. the fish was de-lish and the sauce very tastey. we even added some left over sauce to a cheese sandwich later in the evening!

This was a wonderful, fresh change on making halibut. I loved how fresh and light it tasted. The sauce was great. I had a little left over and made halibut tacos for lunch. They were incredible as well.

Delicious and easy! You can even add other vegies in addition to the peppers and onions - I added mushrooms. I think doubling the serrano peppers would be OK - wasn't that hot...good stand a bit more heat!

Wow! Even my picky daughters who always forget they like fish wanted seconds! This was easy and surprisingly fresh and tasty! Great finish to a hot, busy soccer weekend.

Outstanding! Strong citrus flavor, but very light and refreshing. I made this with fresh cod and substituted jalapenos for the serrano chilis. I also added some mushrooms and cherry tomatoes to the kebabs.

Very good flavor and very easy. I didn't marinate like some suggested and still found it full of flavor. Served with South-of-the Boarder Coleslaw with Cilantro and Jalapeno found on this site.

i loved this and the guests loved it even more. instead of serving this recipe as a sauce, i tripled it and used it as a marinade with swordfish and shrimp. the fresh lime juice is delicious and fresh.

I will definitely make this recipe again. The combination of ingredients is perfect. It is in my top 5 fish recipes.

I thought the ingredients were ordinary but glad I tried it. It was great! Nice and light and tasty. I didn't have serranos on hand so substituted cayanne pepper(3/4 - 1 tsp). I also doubled the sauce and marnitated the fish in half of it as all others suggested.

This was very good and we even had guests drop by who loved it! I marinated the fish in the sauce and then made some more to serve with dinner. I was out of chilis so I just used cayanne pepper and it was very good. Everyone agreed that it was a dish we would make again!

An incredibly fast and easy week-day recipe. My husband raved about it. I followed the advice of earlier reviews and marinated the fish in the sauce in addition to serving the sauce on the side. It was fantastic! A keeper.

Exceptional! The chili-lime sauce is incredible. Served the sauce on the side as directed and it was delicious. As a change, I will use it as a marinade next time as other cooks mentioned. I think it would be great with chicken also. Used purple onions instead of green onions - still made a lovely presentation, but likely not as colorful as the green onions would have been. Since it is so tasty and easy to make, this dish will definitely be part of our regular dinner menu.

4 forks...delicious and easy. I used halibut, chilean sea bass and scallops on the skewers...doubled the sauce as somebody suggested and used half to marinate the fish for about an hour. The rest of the sauce was drizzled over the skewers just before serving instead of being served on the side. Cooking time on our grill was considerably longer than six minutes so be sure to check carefully for doneness. Served it with rice pilaf and a salad of mixed greens with tomatoes and crumbled feta cheese. I only wish I'd made more so I'd had some leftovers!

Unbelievably tasty for the amount of work involved. I used Mahi as well as Halibut and added some purple onion. I doubled the sauce and used half to marinate the fish for an hour. I highly recommend!!

I love this sauce because it's somewhat sweet with a refreshing bite -- 4 forks! The skewered food, however, is plain food, grilled -- 3 forks. To bring the skewers up to 4 forks, I'm going to try marinating the halibut in lime juice or the chili-lime sauce as other reviewers suggested. BTW, there is too much olive oil in the sauce, and you only need half the green onions. Finally, the skewers look very pretty with the bright green, white, and red!

I've never given any recipe in Epicurious a ratingof four forks until this!! Wow. A cook's dream...easy, fast, and ever so delicious. As usual I made this for the first time and served it to my unsuspecting victims...er...dinner guests and they all raved. What a hit.

My Dad brought back 70 pounds of fresh halibut from Alaska, so I thought I'd give it a try...I marinated the halibut for about an hour in the lime sauce and also substituted chicken for some of the halibut for those opposed to fish. Both were great although not as spicy as I thought they would be. Wrapped the leftovers in tortillas with some tomatillo sauce and a squirt of lime juice, which was also great. I'll use more pepper next time...and there will definitely be a next time.

This was fast, easy and fabulous. I was afraid of the spiciness of the chiles for my kids so I marinated the fish for an hour and then grilled it. The kids (and adults) loved it. Next time I would make a larger quantity per person. It went pretty fast. My guests were dipping bread and pouring the sauce on the cous-cous at the end of the meal!

This was excellent, I actually marinated the halibut cubes in some of the cilantro lime sauce for about an hour prior to grilling. It was fabulous! Fresh, very moist and flavorful.
