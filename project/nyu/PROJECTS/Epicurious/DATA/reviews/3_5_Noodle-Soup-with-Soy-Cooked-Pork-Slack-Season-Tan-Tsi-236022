Meh. Niurou mian (beef noodle soup) would be a better, more savory and healthier option, I think. Drain the pork fat after sauteeing with onions and mushrooms. Double the shitake, halve the pork belly..and remove the skin. Pork has to be closer to crispy. Use linguine if you don't have Asian noodles.

OMG, the recipe description is correct, this is addicting! I have made this SEVERAL times now and it's good on everything! Make the topping! put it on rice, put it on rice noodles, put in on wheat noodles, eat it out of a bowl with just a flourish of garnish (i.e., the bean sprouts, a few fresh herbs! it so easy to make, it doesn't matter that it cooks a while, do it while your puttering around doing something else, it cooks itself. Freezes beautifully. Love, love this recipe, made exactly as written (I used bay as I didn't have the licorice root). Enjoy!

Used this recipe as a guide for the leftovers that we had. Used left over roast pork loin, slivered, the reduction time was far less with the precooked pork, there was no need to add the water and cook for an hour. Used veg. oil instead of peanut oil, substituted plain sugar for the rock sugar, and red wine vinegar for the black vinegar...the result was great, tasted like those great soups that you only seem to be able to get in the restaurant, definitely a keeper.

This is a great dish for a cold day! The pork topping has a dark sweetness that the cilantro brightens; a nice balance.
