I made this recipe as part of a large spread of miniature food for my mother's 6oth birthday "modern tea party" bash. Made them three weeks ahead and froze. WONDERFUL! I love making a batch to have in the freezer for unexpected visitors or a nice dinner with a fresh salad. Would not change a thing.

I have made this twice now, per the recipe and everyone has raved. Quick tip, instead of all that rolling out adn cutting, I shaped the dough in a long rope and cut into 32 pieces, then mashed into small flat rounds with my fingers. Worked great! We are still enjoying the lovely roasted peppers in other dishes. They keep well so they are a great do-ahead dish for parties.

Fabulous! When time is short roll the dough into a rectangle and place in a jelly roll pan. Add toppings and bake for 12 - 15 minutes in oven at 375? F. When ready cut into squares and serve. Great hot or cool.

The dish is satisfactory. It takes quite some time to prepare, from the dough to the vegetables marinating for 3 hours. I don't think it was worth it! Another appetizer I made was much quicker, and was much better received by my guests!

This recipe can be made ahead of time. It can even be frozen and just rewarmed. It was absolutely fabulous. The flavors were bold and bright. I added a little bit of balsamic vinegar to the red peppers. Wonderful vegetarian appetizer. Exquisite!
