Fab mixture of lemon and lamb. I get tired of the old rosemary and lamb combo. I didn't have time to marinate so I just drizzled the olive oil over, rubbed the spices and garlic in and put under my broiler. It was delicious.

Made for a dinner party. Super easy, absolutely delicious. Guests went for seconds and also gnawed on the bone. Used lamb chops.

Super recipe. We had limited notice for the prep so used some rather generic ingredients for the marinade. Marinated the loin chops for about two hours and grilled them up with onion and green pepper kebabs on the side. Served with the Skordalia and my wife "fell in love with me all over again" Will definitely be using this recipe again.

We did not care for this marinade at all. We couldn't decide if it was the lemon, the dried oregano or both but it gave the lamb a really bitter strong flavor that completely overpowered the lamb.

This is great! I marinated some portobello's with the same garlic-y lemon-y deliciousness. Popped the meat, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and onions on the skewer and served with the "skordalia". Will use this marinade again soon!

Loved this recipe. Added mushrooms as well as the pepper and onion, then served the kebab on a bed of romaine with olives and feta with some fresh marinade as a dressing. So good! Ended up marinading the lamb for three days due to inclement weather, and wow. Looking forward to making this again on my new grill.

I made this with lamb loin and only marinaded for two hours. It was good, but very heavy on the lemon, and I think could have used more salt. Next time I will probably try marinading for longer and using fresh, instead of dried, oregano. But, definitely worth trying if you have the time to marinade overnight as suggested! Simple ingredients, which most of us have regularly stocked, which I really liked! I still think the best lamb recipe on here is the Grilled Marinated Lamb Chops with Balsamic Cherry Tomatoes, the marinade is divine and my guests always rave!

Recipe was easy and turned out well. Used boneless leg of lamg and grilled outside. Would definitely make again

Amazing. This has become my favorite dinner party entree. I cube the lamb, marinate for hours in the fridge and then put the meat and marinade in a pan under the broiler for 9 min. What comes out is divine---and there is plenty of cooked marinade to use as a table side sauce for the meat and rice, if you choose to serve rice. Also good with cous cous!

Lemon, garlic, olive oil, and herbs -- what's not to love? Comes together quickly and gives the lamb a simple but delicious flavor. I was short on time during my maiden voyage and only marinated my shoulder chops for an hour. They were still delicious.

I thought the marinating kind of made the lamb look unappealing and the lemon juice seemed to affect the texture a bit. Flavor was good after getting past the texture of the meat.

Delicious -- I added some fresh,chopped rosemary to the marinade. Probably best if you marinate overnight, but still succulent and tasty after six hours. Definitely benefits from grilling, and be sure to whip up some skordalia to accompany the lamb. I will make it again.

This recipe was amazing. I marinated a butterflied leg of lamb for just shy of 24 hours, then took it to a friends house and put it on the grill. It was perfect and a huge hit on the appetizer table, sliced for crackers and rolls. People who did not like lamb loved it. Those who had never tried lamb were immediate converts. We have been asked to serve this again and we will!

This was a wonderful addition to my recipe box. I added fresh thai basil and used dried oregano. The rack of lamb was cut into chops and "soaked" in the marinade for 45 minutes. We didn't have a grill, but we used an electric skillet--1 1/2 minutes per side. YUM!

Rating: 4
this rack of lamb was extraordinarily delicious, and quite easy to prepare. i marinated the meat overnight, using about 1- 1/2 lemons instead of 2. skewers in one direction helped the turning process a lot. this is a dish i will gladly prepare again. my guests literally went back for thirds and fourths!

This was amazing--I loved it! I used fresh oregano from my garden and grilled the lamb chops. They didn't marinate very long-- maybe an hour to an hour and a half. I liked the slightly tart lemon with the garlic and oregano. Definitely a keeper!

We butterflied the lamb and marinated for 2 hours as suggested..the onto the BBQ. Quite possibly the most amazing lamb I've ever had, and I'm a big fan of the roasted potato!! Easy to make...but if you BBQ..clean your grill right away!!

In complete agreement w/ note from "Greek Community" - you MUST use Greek oregano (rigani)- out here I find it at our local Italian Deli (because we don't have a Greek one - sigh). It comes intact on the branch (Krinos brand). I'm sure you can find it on the internet as well. Or my preferred method, stuff my suitcase full of the stuff every time I leave the mother country!!!! Got a "special" screening at customs one year when they discovered my plastic baggies full of mysterious green herbs. Had to explain to customs officials how wonderful Greek oregano is, and that I cook a lot, hence the quantity. Yes folks, it is that good. That said, this is the quintessential, authentic Greek marinade for lamb (as well as most other meats). And again, in agreement w/ "Greek Community" - the addition of pomegranate juice is awesome - although, perhaps not as authentic. Low acidity for those saying lemon is too acidic. And, depending on the cut you use, marinate accordingly (in my opinion, the longer the better). I'm 100% Greek - I have watched 3 generations prepare lamb (over "there" and "here") - and this is the way to do it. One more note - the name of this dish "Barba Yianni" - as much as I know, the title "barba" is one given in the village to the old village "cronies"... Yianni is just the Greek name for John. Barba actually means "bearded" - as in perhaps, the bearded wise old man... So at any rate, I'm sure Wise Old John knows his lamb....

This recipe worked beautifully. I only had one lemon and it was enough. My guests raved about it and I intend to make it many more times.

This is the best marinade for lamb I've ever used. You could cut down the lemon juice just a bit, but everything else was perfect. I used lamb chops and marinated them overnight. They came out to be soft and juicy. Thanks for the great recipe.

I have not made the kebobs, but have made this simple and fast marinade with chops and rack of lamb. I always grill it. I make this for company, its just so tasty that its always a hit. I generally make double the recipe to cover all the meat, and I rarely put in all the lemon. (I don't usually have enough on hand) Now I buy huge containers of Oregano - so that I am always able to make the marinade without much notice.

Good and easy. First time making kebabs. Used sirloin chops because that's what was available at the store today, and removed bones, fat and gristle. I used 1:1 ratio of oil to lemon juice because some of my family don't care for tart tasting food. They all loved it this!

It was just OK - used a boneless leg of lamb and marinated for about 6 hours. Didn't wow me. I had company and no one was clamoring for seconds.

very nice and easy to make. I had 6 people for dinner and made the kebabs. First rate.

This is not the best recipe for Greek lambchops. There is too much lemon. 1:1 is a good ratio of oil to lemon in Greek cooking. A great light, traditional salad dressing is simply equal parts extra-virgin olive oil and fresh lemon juice, seasoned to taste with with salt, pepper, and oregano, then shaken or whisked to mix. You can make the dressing a little thicker and more saturated in flavor by refrigeratted before serving. I only use fresh garlic, freshly ground pepper, and Greek oregano. Greek Oregano is a wild Marjoram from Greece. I would never use Mexican oregano or basil, their flavors are bitter and not appropriate for Greek cooking. If Greek Oregano (Rigani) is not available, Marjoram or Spice Hunter's Mediterranean Oregano will lend the closest flavors. For large pieces of meat, cut the garlic into slivers and place in slits cut into the lamb, squeeze lemons over, and sprinle with spices. With a Greek husband, I have learned a lot about lamb. The tradition of basting lamb is Pomegranite Molasses can be updated by marinating Lamb is fresh Pomegranate juice. The Pomegranate adds a wonderful subtle flavor and is not too sweet. The juice is not very acidic, so it can be used for longer marinades.

I served this as a kebab and the main dish in a Greek dinner I made for friends. It was very flavorful andI received lots of compliments. For 6 large kebabs, I used 3# boneless lamb.

My Greek family's been making this dish for years. The longer you marinate the better. A leg of lamb will usually marinate 2 days. And make sure it's well done!!

Whan I made this I was in a hurry. It may be helpful to know that marinating for only 25 minutes turned out a superior tasting dish. I suppose too long in the marinade would create a lamb ceviche---that is, pickled, too-dry meat. While we were eating all that was heard were mmmms, oooohs, and ahhhs. The munching on the bones also lasted too short a time. I will be making this again and again!

The flavor of this marinade is outstanding. We made kabobs and marinated the cut up lamb for 24 hrs., which was a little long for the small pieces as it masked the flavor of the lamb. I think 6 hours for the small pieces would be generous. Otherwise we followed the recipe exactly, using fresh oregano. Will definetly make again.

This has just become my favorite lamb recipe! Marinated a butterflied l.o.l. for 8 hours. Added the minced zest from both lemons to the marinade, and used fresh oregano from the garden. Tender and delicious. Accompanied it with other Greek-inspired recipes from this site. Truly outstanding.

I marinated overnight and found that the lemon made the lamb go "blotting papery"...too much acid...maybe my lemons were too big....might try again with less lemon or shorter marinade time...

The marinade was so simple, I will surely make this again. I think its especially easy for entertaining. I added cucumber to the yoghurt sauce to make it a side dish instead of a topping for the lamb. The lamb doesn't really need the yoghurt sauce, its so tasty on its own!

I don't generally like lamb, but bought some accidentally during a Costco meat-buying frenzy. Not knowing how to prepare it, I tried this recipe, the first recipe that came up. I was shocked how good lamb can be! I only had a 1/2 the amount of oregano called for and made up the difference with Italian seasoning. I will be trying this marinade on other meats too.

I made kabobs for a dinner party and I must admit that I have never liked lamb, but this dish has me hooked. I added fresh mint and Dean and Deluca's lamb rub with rosemary and lavendar in addition to what is listed . It was so yummy!! everyone wanted the recipe! I plan on making this again and again!

I served this as kabobs - it was excellent with homemade tzitiki sauce - yummy! I put some tinfoil on my BBQ and sprayed it lightly with "Pam" before cooking - no sticking, no flare up!

Very tasty. The addition of the oil in the marinade did cause some flare-up while grilling. I marinaded the boneless leg of lamb overnight and it was delicious. Next time I would decrease the amount of oil.
