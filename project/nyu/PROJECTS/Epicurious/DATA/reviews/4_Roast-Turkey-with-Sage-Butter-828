I first made this recipe ten years ago. I've tried other 4-fork recipes over the years, but I keep coming back to this one. The turkey comes out looking like it belongs on the cover of a magazine, and the taste is wonderful and moist. The only change I've made is that I use extra broth for basting and gravy. This recipe is absolutely wonderful!

I have been making this turkey--EVERY YEAR--since it hit Bon Appetit in 1995. In fact, tomorrow, July 10th, 2010, we are making this turkey for a 'Thanksgiving in July' party. I do thicken the gravy, but otherwise this recipe is outstanding. Simple and lots and lots of oohs and ahhs every Thanksgiving. Cheers!

Well, this was just terrific. I was a little worried, as the butter did have a strong aroma of sage before the bird was roasted, and I was thinking that if you don't like sage, this wouldn't be for you. However, it really couldn't be better. It was a smash hit. I followed the recipe exactly, although I did add a little flour to thicken the gravy at the end. Really delicious, and would make again in a heart beat.

My finace followed the recipe exactly except for the bay leaf. It reached 180 degrees in 3 hours in the roaster oven and he immediately pulled it out. The turkey literally fell off the bone, he could carve it with a butter knife. The sage was delicate and drippings made a tasty gravy. Between the basting and the steaming quality of a turkey roaster the turkey couldn't get any moister.

This is my first review to post on epicurious but I am always using their recipes. This turkey was the best turkey I had ever roasted! It was a sensational hit at our dinner party! My turkey was only 12.4 lbs and took a little over 3 hrs to roast. I took the turkey out at 177 degrees and it was absolutely juicy. I did baste it more often then every 1/2 hr because I noticed the turkey was producing a lot of juice. I also added more stock at the end when making the gravy to dilute it and the gravy turned out just scrumptious. I highly recommend this recipe. This is a keeper!

This will be the 5th Thanksgiving I will make this delicious recipe. It's by far the best turkey I have made- the whole extended family really enjoys it, and the gravy is both wonderful and simple. Has anyone tried to brine this with cider for example? What about adding a little POM pomegranite juice to the brine? I have never brined before, but want to try it to take this great bird recipe completely over the top.

This is our 11th Thanksgiving of making this turkey. We love it. If the turkey breast is getting to brown, over done or dry; try covering it with double layer of cheesecloth 1/2 to 2/3 of the baking time and keep it basted. Also, we find it takes 4 to 4 1/2 hrs for a 12 to 14 lb bird. For wine, a good Oregon pinot noir, peferably with about 5 yrs of age or more, is just a perfect pairing.

This was my first turkey and it was really good! The dressing that goes with it was also excellent.

Our first turkey here and it was very flavorful. Ours came out a bit dry, but don't think it's recipe's fault- left it in a little longer so skin would get nice n brown/crispy, may have overcooked? Or would it matter that boyfriend basted every 30 mins but mostly just w/ turkey's own juices, instead of with the 1/3c broth recipe called for? Gravy is yummy, boyfriend added flour to thicken a little, very nice. With the amount of sage in the butter and the leaves in the cavity, I thought the sage flavor would be more pronounced, but it was still good. Gravy He used a lot less & basted instead w/ its own juices.

The first turkey I've ever cooked-- and my guests loved it. Easy, delicious, and certain to be served for Thanksgiving from now on. The gravy was good, too.

Actually I would give 4 forks to this one, but this garners 3 forks from my other half who normally wouldn't tolerate turkey. I think this is the best turkey I have ever made, rich & flavorful.

First Thanksgiving ever and this turkey turned out great. I found a recipe for sourdough sage stuffing and it went along really well with this bird. My parents and husband both raved about how increadibly moist and flavorful this turkey turned out. My only mistake is that since I don't eat pork, I used turkey bacon and accidently used too much and made it too salty. Though my husband and father didn't seem to mind. I think my mother and I are just sensitive to salt. It didn't cook to the same crispness as normal bacon I suppose, so I used a little bit more to compensate. Didn't matter in the end, I'm still going to cook this recipe again next year. This time I'll invite his family over, too. Then I'll really know what people think. Oh, just as an extra note - I used the orange flavored sweet potatoes with the oatmeal cookie crust which I found on this site to serve along side and everyone loved it (including my three-year old!)

Can only comment on the turkey, as I did not make the stuffing or gravy recipe. But, the turkey came out really moist and flavorful. I have made this before and will probably make it again. It always comes out delicious!

Excellent taste, unique flavor, and pretty to look at. Extra work is involved but it produces a moist turkey and the most scrumptious gravy. Recommend doubling gravy. Yum!

I purchase my first magazine for Thanksgiving. I was to prepare Thanksgiving for the first time. There it was...the perfect turkey receipe. It is now my tradition, and I am sure that my future grandchildren will brag that Grandma makes the best turkey. For now, it is my children who do the bragging. This is the BEST TURKEY EVER!

I don't eat turkey, however, I have served this recipe at five holidays to different sets of friends and family and have received rave reviews everytime. My boyfriend tells all of his friends that I make the best turkey in the world. As I'm told, it is extremely moist and flavorful. The smell in the kitchen is amazing. Thanks Epicurious!

Since 1995 I have never made another turkey. This beat any I had ever made. The smell is incompaorable and the turkey is so moist.

Every year since 1995, less one. It is a great recipe, never dry, but I double the gravy so there is enough to pass with the potatoes. As with earlier reviewers, I use the butter during the year on chicken and I always end up cooking my bird longer than the recipes says.

Have made this for the last 3 Thanksgivings, also use the butter for chicken during the year, was amazing. Have given this recipe to many, even my mother who will not use herbs on the Thanksgiving turkey!

Beatiful bird. Curious as to why the recipe says it will take 3 measly hours to cook. My turkey was only a few pounds more, and it was perfect at no less than eight.

I made this last year, along with the stuffing, and most of the other dishes listed in the suggsted menu. Everyone raved about it for weeks, and have asked for it again this year. its relatively easy and absolutely delicious. Try this recipe...and try the stuffing, too, as they go great together!

There is a whole meal that goes with this turkey recipe. My family has made portions of the meal for years. Check out teh Corn and wild rice soup, bread stuffing with mushrooms, potatoe gratin with mustard and cheddar cheese, green beans wi roasted onions (my personal favorite), baked butternut squash with apples and maple syrup

I have also been making this turkey since 1995. It was my first thanksgiving as the hostess as well as the first turkey I had ever prepared. I made this year as well and it turned out to be the best one yet! Very moist and flavorful

I made this for the first time this Thanksgiving. The turkey was incredibly moist; the flavor was wonderful. I used turkey bacon and can't imagine that the overall flavor was compromised. I also added chicken broth to the roasting pan as the turkey cooked (in addition to the gravy-making process). It was the best gravy I ever made! The turkey won rave reviews from my guests. I just wish I had bought a bigger turkey (not enough leftovers!)

I highly recommend this and the stuffing, potatoes and green beans that go with this menu. I have saved this issue for 7 years and have made the menu every year since 1995. Glad to see it on the internet - I don't have to be so worried about losing my issue!!

Try this one! I have also made this turkey every year since it was on the 1995 cover, its now our family tradition. Best ever! After the first year I've left out the bacon, personal preference, and it is still wonderful. It makes the best pan gravy. However, I agree with previous post that extra butter in gravy is not necessary.

Not only does this recipe make the most delicious and moist turkey you've ever put in your mouth, it is also a most beautiful sight. If you've ever wanted a bird that looks like the ones that you see on the front covers of Bon Appetit during Thanksgiving and Christmas, THIS IS IT! Enjoy

Everyone found this recipe to be very flavorful and tasty. I used margarine and turkey bacon instead of butter and pork bacon and do not believe that the substitution negatively impacted the taste of the dish. I did include a couple of stalks of celery and a large sliced onion. This recipe is super tasty and perfect for the "Bread Stuffing with Mushrooms and Bacon", which can be found on Epicurious.

I have made this turkey the past 2 holiday seasons. It is fabulous! The gravy is literally self-making from the wonderful sage/butter mixture. I make this with a dried fruit stuffing which is an excellent compliment of sweet to the bacon saltiness. One complaint - the basting. This year I am brining my turkey and not basting at all - just putting my chicken broth and sage/butter mixture in at the beginning - I feel I will end up with the same result. (I'll let you know).

I made this dish the year before last. My father in law stated it was the best turkey he'd ever tasted. I tried a different recipe last year, and was disappointed. So we're back to this one again. I make the stuffing, green beans and pumpkin roll from the menu. It has become the Thanksgiving tradition at our house.

I have made this for our family Thanksgiving every year since 1995. It is always requested and makes me feel sorry for those who are looking for a non-Turkey Thanksgiving dish. They are really missing out. Make the BREAD STUFFING WITH MUSHROOMS AND BACON to go with it. They compliment each other. I have also used the sage butter to roast chicken with great results.
