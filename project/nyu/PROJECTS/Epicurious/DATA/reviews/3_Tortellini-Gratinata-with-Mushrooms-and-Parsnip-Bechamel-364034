Although this recipe is laborious to make, it was an absolute hit in our house. Delish! I plan on making it again tomorrow. I use a lot of garlic in my food so the last time I made it I used an entire garlic bulb (about 10 to 12 garlic cloves).

I was very excited to make this dish, and was worried about my family not liking it, however it ended up all the fussy eaters loved it and I wasn't very impressed. I did add Italian sausage to it, but besides that didn't change anything. I really couldn't put my finger on what I didn't like about it though, maybe a little bland?

I love mushroom and parsnips, but this was just not enough flavor for me. I thought is was OK and wanted to try it because it was such a different combination of ingredients. The bechamel does take longer than 5 minutes as another reviewer stated. If I make again, I would use meat in the dish in some way. Perhaps meat ravioli. I against anything vegetarian but, if felt, it just needed something else that I can't pinpoint.

My husband hates mushrooms, so I chopped them finely and made a duxelle to toss with the tortellini--that worked fine as a disguise, and in the recipe. Next time I think I'll add spinach with the mushrooms; this recipe calls out for something green. I used an ordinary gorgonzola and light cream (had no milk). My only complaint was the half hour to cook down the bechamel rather than the five minutes suggested. Everyone loved it.

Everyone really liked this, including the kids! Had a tasty creamy sauce. I altered it a quite a bit tho, trying to lighten it up: *Used 1.5 cups skim milk & 1 c. half and half instead of whole milk *Used scant 1/2 cup Parmesan plus some to grate on top at end *Used regular portobello mushrooms cut into bite sized chunks *Added 4 small zucchini cut into bite sized chunks to saute with mushrooms *Used 4 garlic cloves *Used about 2 teaspoons dried Rosemary, crumbled *Used 17.6oz/500g radiatori pasta instead of cheese tortellini
