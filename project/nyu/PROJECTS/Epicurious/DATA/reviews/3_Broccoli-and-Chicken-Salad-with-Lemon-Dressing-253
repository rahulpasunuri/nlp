This recipe attracted me because it sounded healthy and had vegetables. But after reading most of the reviews I figured that the dressing would need more than what it was asking. So I followed the recipe but added to the dressing: 1 diced tomato, balsamic vinaigrette, some cayenne pepper, paprika, and seasoned pepper. It came out great and my husband loved it. It's easy to make and will definitely be making it soon.

Quite tasty! Added a sweet red pepper, lightly sauteed the onions, and added Hoisin sauce (1.5 tsp?) as suggested by a few others. Might try fresh rosemary next time instead of thyme. But it's definitely a keeper and especially great since I have most of the ingredients from my garden right now.

There is something missing in this recipe and I don't know what it is, which is a shame because everything about it is good - except the missing 'pizzazz'.

My husband and I really liked this salad. I used store-bought roast chicken breast with the skin removed. I added a bit more dressing, and topped it with a dusting of feta cheese crumbles. This is definitely a keeper

This dish needs alot of work. The overall concept is great but lacking in flavor. I also marinate my chicken overnight for more flavor and I am looking for suggestions on how to jazz up the dressing.

I wanted to like this recipe, but the dressing was bland, bland, bland!

Followed recipe exactly; broccoli overdone, potatoes mushy, dressing quite bland. I thought this an unfortunate combo..I threw out the leftovers. Really disappointing.

Used the hoisin/honey marinade for the chicken, as suggested by another reviewer - think it might not have been so good without it. Will definitely make again. Colourful & healthy.

Deeeelish! I gave the chicken umph by marinating it in the same ingredients used for the dressing. I also added sugar snap peas during the last minute of steaming the other veggies and a little balsamic to the dressing. This will become one of my standards year round!

Absolutely delightful! We've tried this with BBQ, Roasted, Hoisin/Honey, even fajita chicken, it's always terriffic. At different times, we've also added fresh pea pods, celery root, fennel, pearl onions, and even olives. We even tried purple potatoes once. Now that was fun! R.I.: if you want to try the recipe using that yucky, pathetic chicken substitute, fine. But don't trash the recipe when it doesn't work.

This was a neat alternative taste for chicken! I BBQed the chicken and veggies which made a great summer meal. I would cut back on the cumin and garlic in the dressing next time around.

I found the flavours in this recipe to be totally unbalanced; far too much lemon for me, and very little depth of flavour. It wasn't horrible, and it was certainly better the next day, but overall not really worth the time, effort or expense of chicken (about the most expensive meat to buy organically, at least round here...)

My substitutions were yellow onion and veggie chicken. Anyway, I thought the colors and proportions were somehow off. Next time, I'd add less "chicken" and more broccoli and carrots.

We really liked this salad -- it was a great way to use up leftover chicken and potatoes from the night before.

We liked the combination of ingredients and the flavor of the dressing, but thought there should be more broccoli and more chicken, given the amount of carrots and potatoes. The second time I made it, I added another cup of broccoli, another cup of chicken, and then increased the amount of dressing accordingly.

I never would have thought to mix chicken and potatoes in the same salad. On a lark I put the two together and the search yielded this recipe! It was delicious; just enough "bite" with the lemon dressing. Seems like a good summer "potluck" picnic dish and I'll make it for just such an occasion later this month.

I made this recipe exactly as written and thought it was absolutely delicious--very light & flavorful. I will definitely make this again. It's a perfect summer salad.

I made this exactly as written and thought it was very good. It was perfect for a hot summer day--filling but not too heavy. I will definitely make again and try some of the other readers suggestions.

Kudos to Kyla for turning this recipe into a 4! I just happened to have bean sprouts in my frigfor the first time in four years since I live in Russia and they are hard to find. I added them, brushed with the lemon and hoisin (also a 'difficult to find' ingredient, and voila!

This recieved a four rating with the addition of a few things. I added steamed beansprouts, and marinated the vegetables in a little balsamic vinegar and lemon juice before putting everything together. I also roasted a bunch of garlic and added to the salad along with brushing the chicken with honey, hoison sauce and lemon juice before broiling, as mentioned. Very nice for a light summer meal.

I have made this a number of times, and it has been popular each time. A couple of additions I made were to substitute spring onions for the red onion, 4 cloves of roast garlic instead of the fresh, and I brushed the chicken with a mixture of 3 tsp honey, 1 tbs hoisin sauce and a drizzle of sesame oil. Don't however, do what I did once and substitute lime for lemon juice.....much too tart!

Tasty dish - easy to make - nutritional too. My family loved it.

Roasted Chicken can be slightly dry - poach it instead-easily done in microwave. I would stop cooking and set color of carrots and broccoli by quickly chilling them in icewater. Little more effort but worth it. I personally prefer roasted garlic but whatever pleases you.
