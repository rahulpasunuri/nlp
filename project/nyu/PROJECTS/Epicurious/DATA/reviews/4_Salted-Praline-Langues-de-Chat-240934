Beautiful and absolutely delicious, these turned out even better looking than the photo online! Pipe them evenly in parallel lines on parchment (not Silpats, they are super-buttery and they will slide around if you try w/o parchment). Don't worry that the praline won't stick - it will melt all over them beautifully. I tied them back-to back in bundles with thin ribbon to put in holiday cookie boxes. They are indestructible as you move them around. The taste - salty & sweet, buttery and crisp, with a crunch AND some softness is just divine. Langues Du Chat - J'taime.

i make "gourmet" cookies each year from some of their many christmas editions. I decided to try these ones this year. I'm so glad i did. they are the perfect blend of sweet and salty. Even the biscuit without the praline was good. I will try making these again soon... i'm sure!

I love the idea of this recipe, but for some reason I wound up with a puffy, chewy cooking, rather than a crunchy one. The batter flattened out considerably as it baked. I was true to the recipe, but I do not have a great batting average when it comes to baked goods, so I'm sure I must have taken a wrong turn at some point. As there is no lack of good, easy cookie recipes in the world, I don't think I'll be making these again, but they were worth the try.

I'm always looking for alternatives to the old I'm-sending-you-Christmas-Cookies standbys and this will be one of them from now on! Crisp, with just a hint of chewiness in the center, and more of an adult presentation than decorated cut-outs. The batch makes a LOT (especially since i made mine shorter to fit into tins easier) but do make sure they're skinnier then, some of mine ended up looking like chubby little ladyfingers (fkatnik hit it spot on). Oh, and I don't know if it's the type of salt I have (some pink flaked stuff from Australia), but I had to thow my first tray of these out - then be SUPER lighthanded with the salt from there on. But otherwise well worth it, and once you wrestle with the praline once or twice, it's super easy. :)

These were light and crispy. The trick is to pipe them thin so they look like tongues and not ladyfingers. They are relatively simple to make and they make a lot- good for holiday cookie exchange par-tays. Technically they are called Langues du Chat (not de). I am at altitude (5800' and the recipe needed no adjustments. Will keep this in my binder.

I baked these cookies exactly as indicated to gift as part of my New Year's treat boxes. They got rave reviews. I would suggest making the praline half at a time instead of all at once. Sugar can go from golden to burnt in an instant so I always find it easier to work with smaller batches.

This is an outstanding cookie and a nice change from the usual Christmas cookie. It will definely become part of my repertoire.

These were delicious! The only problem I experienced was that the cookies really spread out when they baked. They never "puffed up". So I might add a bit more flour next time or cut out one (or even two) of the egg whites. But still delicious and easy!
