Fantastic. Looked really pretty on the plate too.

So easy and delicious. I had never roasted broccoli before! I cut them into regular pieces and only roasted them for about 15 minutes. I ADORE cheese, but agree with the reviews: I used about 1/2 cup of parmesan (what I had on hand) and it was a little too much (I had used two regular sized bunches of broccoli)

Excellent! Easy. Brings out the best broccoli flavor. I used much less cheese and would cut further. Use about 2 tbsp. cheese and this turns into a healthy way veggie side dish for any time the oven's on anyway.

This is a simple and delicious way to enjoy broccoli. I also cut in half (and should have reduced further) the amount of cheese and substituted parmesan cheese for the asiago cheese.

Rating: 4
I agree with the others that the amount of cheese is way too much. I've used as little as 1/4 cup and found it plenty cheesy. I also use parmesan interchangeably with asiago.

This is tasty, but we made the mistake of mixing the asiago into the broccoli in the same pan it roasted in, rather than transferring to a bowl. Since the pan was so hot, the cheese just kind of melted and stuck to the pan, spatula, etc, not to the broccoli. So follow the instructions! Luckily we had a little leftover cheese and sprinkled that on top. I thought that small amount--maybe 1/4 cup--was plenty, so I'd reduce the cheese called for.

I am a great fan of roasted vegetables. I do many variations of roasted broccoli, but I had some asiago in the fridge I needed to use so this was recipe was a natural choice. I found that a cup of cheese was WAY too much for the amount of broccoli I had (one albeit small bunch). I used my convection roast setting on my oven for the broccoli and it came out stellar..crispy and browned. I squeezed a little lemon over the finished product. It's not my favorite roasted broccoli dish but good. Will do it again whenever I have asiago but will probably add some sliced garlic and maybe some pine nuts.

I was looking for something different to do with a head of broccoli. This wasn't it. Although I followed the directions exactly, the end product was tough and burnt- tasting. The cheese did nothing to help the dish. I love roasted vegetables, but this just didn't work. In the future, I would either flash steam the broccoli first, or roast smaller pieces (rather than stalks). My husband actually liked it, but I was disappointed.

I thought that there was too much cheese for this amount of broccoli. I would cut it in half if I was to make it again.

Delicious! Followed the suggestions to add crushed garlic and leave the broccoli stems a little longer. Loved the contrast between the slightly sharp Asiago and the earthy broccoli. I will definitely make this again!

Yummmm. I added some minced garlic and red pepper flakes. Simple and good.

This was fantastic. Make sure to leave about 3-4 inches on each stalk. Again, not a huge broccoli fan, but the roasting brings out a sweetness. In addition to adding walnuts and Pleasent Ridge reserve cheese (an awesome cheese from Wisconsin),I added about 8 roughly torn peppadew peppers to the roasting. Just when you started to tire of the broccoli, your senses would be assaulted by a burst of sweet cherry peppers. YUM!

I made it earlier this week and loved it. Making it again tonight. Easy to do when you are already using the oven. The broccoli does shrink some what so you have to make much more than you would if steaming etc. But the flavour is concentrated and delicious.

Great way to prepare broccoli, so easy & tasty. I added walnuts and some of the cheese (parmesan)to the broccoli before baking.

Rating: 4
This was great - so much better than steamed broccoli, and not that much more work. I combined broccoli and cauliflower, added a few cloves of crushed garlic to the olive oil, and used grated parmesan cheese - it worked out fine. I might try adding pinenuts next time, and I saw another recipe that called for good-quality olives - all good ideas.

This was a quick and delicious and easy. I should have added garlic but it was tasty nonetheless. I only had gruyere and it worked. I cut the broccoli from large stalks to make sure they didn't dry out. I will definitely make it again. It reminded me of broccoli that was served at Capital Grille.

Not necessarily amazing, but a very tasty simple way to fix broccoli.

It came out PERFECTLY the *second* time! The first time I cut the broccoli too small and thus the baking time was waaaay too long. It came out very dark brown and crispy - which was still edible but weird. The *second* time, my broccoli stalks were about 3- 4 inches long, with a 2-3 inch crown and a stem about 1/2 inch wide. At this size, 25 mins at 450 was about right. I took the advice of several others and added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and some chopped nuts (pecans) to to the oil before I tossed. I also decided to try sprinkling some of the Asiago on top prior to baking. To avoid a stuck-on mess, I baked it all on parchment. Consequently the cheese and nuts crisped up and browned so they were crunchy and wonderful! The larger broccoli browned but didn't get too dark. The garlic really brought out the flavor, and the mixture of crunch and tender crisp broccoli was amazing! The whole thing got 4-fork reviews from both my husband and I. I was never a broccoli fan, but NOW I AM!!!

This was very good. I added a minced teaspoon of fresh garlic that was in a little EV olive oil to the broccoli after it was put on to the baking sheet. The texture was perfect. A little crisp but still tender enough.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I typically don't make alot of veggies, but this has become e frequent visitor to my plate. I wont steam broccoli anymore or make it any other way. Still need to try with some cayenne or red pepper flakes. Even my pick girlfriend loved it!

This is the only way we eat broccoli now. My husband and I can polish off an entire serving between the two of us, and I've never been much of a broccoli fan before. We usually only do 1/2 the amount of cheese it calls for. We love Asiago, and the flavor works great, but the full amount is a bit too cheesy and rich for our tastes.

This was tasty but the presentation was lacking. I served it on a buffet as part of an Italian Christmas menu including Turkey with Pancetta-Sage butter also from this site. Still an easy and quick alternative to green beans.

i followed some of other's advice and added cayenne pepper as well as large-chunk crank pepper as well as lots of garlic. i used a hard irish cheese because that's what i had. it was a huge hit.

I use to cook my broccoli ,sliced, in the grill (500F) tossed with olive oil , garlic and little salt for around 15/18 min. It tastes very good just like that. I will try next time with cheese.It sounds delicious!

This was outstanding. I copied others and added a few shakes of red pepper flakes and diced garlic. I watched it in the oven until the broccoli started to brown so not sure how long I had it in. Next time I would copy another's suggestion and after tossing the broccoli in the cheese, I'll pop it back in the oven for a couple of minutes. This was fabulous and extremely easy to make. I will make this regularly from now on.

i found that i did not need to roast the broccoli as long as recommended; i also added some red pepper flakes to the cheese. We all loved it! I will make this super-easy, delicious recipe again--probably for Thanksgiving.

This was requested again tonight by my not-fond- of-broccoli family. This is the tastiest simply-broccoli dish out there. Hands down.

I have been making this recipe since it appeared in the March issue and it has become my absolute favorite way to eat broccoli. If I don't have Asiago on hand, I toss it with parmesan at the end instead. Roasting really brings out a depth and earthiness to the broccoli. Yum.

Rating: 4
OK, I'll admit I changed it a little: I took the advice of others and cooked it at a lower temp (400) for less time (15 min). I also sprinkled on a little red pepper flakes for a little spice (I could do more, but my wife likes just a little). And...I used the flakes of Asiago that come prepared in a tub... I sprinkled them on prior to baking. Having said that, it was excellent and as someone else said, the teenagers loved it!!

I improved this recipe by adding several cloves of garlic to the oil marinade and roasted the garlic with the broccoli. This is a natural accompaniement. Yummy!

This will definitely not be a kekeper or made a second time. After roasting and adding cheese, it still isn't a very nice looking dish.

Rating: 4
Okay, this dish is wonderful! I've made it twice. But, you must be sure to not make the pieces too big or too small. Cut the broccoli into small spears about 1/2 inch wide at the stem. Roast at 450 for 20 minutes. You can sub Pecorino Romano or Parmesan.

This was just okay! The broccoli was slightly browned but dry and you could hardly taste the asiago. Very disappointing.

I didn't find this nearly as delightful as previous reviewers. I also cut the cooking time a bit but still ended up with very browned bits of broccoli and a generally very dry dish.

Brilliant! The roasting makes for a very nice texture on the broccoli. Per others' advice, I roasted at 375 for about 20 minutes, and it worked out wonderfully. A really nice and different way to make broccoli.

I can't believe I never thought of cooking broccoli like this before - could not find Asiago so I used good quality Parmesan and it was still great - finally got my partner to eat more than one mouthful.

who knew broccoli was so good?! i baked at 375 for 10 minutes. i like my veggies to still resemble veggies!! the only way i'll do broccoli from now on - really brings out it's flavor.

Anytime a fussy, broccoli hating teenager reaches for seconds, you know you have a great recipe. I've been dousing broccoli in heavy cheese sauces for years trying to get it into my son. Who would have thought that something so easy as grated asiago tossed in at the end would do. Simply wonderful and very easy!

This is fabulous broccoli! I served this last night (with the Fettuccine with Sausage, Sage, and Crispy Garlic from this site). It was easy, fast and exceedingly tender and delicious. It took only 20 minutes to roast perfectly and I didnt change a thing. My husband, who eats broccoli because its healthy but really doesnt care for it, exclaimed over the flavor and asked that I serve it this way from now on. Our 20- something son, never a vegetable lover of any sort, not only polished his plate, but finished off the broccoli in a second helping! He too raved over it and said that this is something he wants again! Needless to say, this is slated to become a standard in our house.

I would NEVER again make this as written. I have no idea how it could be so highly rated!!! I cut the crowns in quarters, as directed, and after roasting them for 25+ minutes, they were still tough, and there was NO way to toss them with the cheese!!! The picture shows little pieces of broccoli sprinkled with the cheese--which is NOT what the recipe says. I'll figure out how to make it right on my own!!!

This is a great dish. It couldn't be any easier, and all of the flavors come together to make a simple vegetable dish memorable.

Absolutely delicious and could not be easier. 1 cup of Asiago is a little too much and overpowers the dish - you could get away with 1/2 cup and it would be perfect.

I agree. Do not cook this more than 15 minutes at 450 degrees. I think if you could cook it for 25 minutes, if the oven was at 375 degrees.

This was great. Do not cook it for the full 25 min., or at least check it at 12min. Very tasty and easy.
