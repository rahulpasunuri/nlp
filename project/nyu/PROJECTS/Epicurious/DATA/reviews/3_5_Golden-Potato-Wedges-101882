I use organic potatoes and spread olive oil and thyme generously along with a sprinkle of salt, garlic salt and adobo. Cook for about 45 min and it comes out amazing.

This couldn't be easier, and they came out great. The perfect side for many dishes.

Yummy potatoes but without all the fat! I added garlic and served w/ hamburgers. The whole family loved them!

Very easy and they tasted almost like the fries you get that are filled with fat! I used Yukon gold, but will try other kinds of potatoes for sure!

I've been making potatoes this way for more than 30 years. In our house we call them 'Hungarian potatoes' because I sprinkle them lightly with sweet Hungarian paprika before they go in the oven. This adds both flavour and colour. As other readers pointed out, russets are the best potatoes to use here.

Wonderful recipe - easy, fast and delicious! I also used russet potatoes and found them better than the yukon golds. Will definitely make these many more times.

Definitely a keeper. Very simple, and yet yummy. I made with red potatoes (all I had) and it turned out great. I used seasoned salt and black pepper on mine.

This is a long-standing recipe around my house. We sprinkle them with garlic powder and onion salt for extra flavor. They go great with burgers, BBQ, oven-fried chicken - good all-purpose, comfort food!

Wow, quick, easy. Will make these again, and again.

I loved these potatoes as did my very fussy children. HOWEVER, the cooking time was more like 35-40 minutes instead of the 60 mins. in the recipe. Perhaps my potatoes were a bit smaller than the size in the recipe, but just watch them when you make this great recipe.

This worked beautifully, and the wedges came out just the way we like them.. Crispy outside, soft inside. I made this with Russets, and added some chopped fresh rosemary and basil to the oil for a little extra flavor.
