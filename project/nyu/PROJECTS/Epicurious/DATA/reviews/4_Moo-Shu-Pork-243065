Great recipe! Used bamboo shoots instead of cucumber and left out the wood ears as we were out. Served with flour tortillas to avoid the extra work and slathered with hoisin sauce for a more typical moo-shu flavor. All in all, very tasty!

Ok, but not great. It's quite a bit of work to make all the wrappers, and the result is somewhat goopy and not particularly flavorful. (Followed the recipe except omitted black mushrooms, which I couldn't find.)

This recipe is amazing. I will preface my review by saying that until I made this I have never had Moo-Shu so I can't compare to how authentic it is. but honestly I don't care. It is a bit time consuming to make. If you do it all in one shot it took me 2 hours from beginning to sitting down to eat. With that said. Ive already made it twice. I followed everything to the letter except for the black mushrooms- couldn't find them at my supermarket.I used baby bella and shitaake instead. This has become a family favorite already written down in our family recipe book. The dough that the recipe has you make is enough for 2 recipes. So I froze half and used it a couple of months later with no problem

I don't eat moo-shu, but my husband enjoys it and we no longer eat chinese out because we can't control the oil. I made this for him and he said -- as others have noted -- "better than anything he had before!" I substituted japanese sake for the rice wine and omitted the chinese black mushrooms (because I don't know where to find it). I also substituted hoisin for the oyster sauce, and included a couple of tsps of minced ginger with the pork marinade. Note that the 1 tsp of sesame oil and two eggs is repeated in the recipe (at the bottom of each section), but you only make it once. For the two eggs, I substituted one egg and one white; I'll try two whites next time. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a tee and it was easy (once you have the ingredients prepped and ready to go) and, as noted, very good. My husband said the cucumbers were a particularly "refreshing addition." I did make the pancakes although I'm going to try some high quality wheat tortillas next time and steam them lightly in the microwave, which I've seen recommended on other sites.

This was wonderful and authentic tasting. The pancakes are a lot of work, and probably not worthwhile unless you are really hankering for the full moo-shu experience. I used beef instead of pork, and subbed hoisin for oyster sauce because I keep kosher. I left off the sugar in the stir-fry sauce because the hoisin is already sweet, but I think that change kept it more true to the original recipe. I also used a package of coleslaw mix instead of the napa cabbage-- it was super easy and cheaper. This is my favorite chinese dish, and I am delighted to be able to make it for myself and without the buckets of oil usually found in chinese take-out.

This was amazing! Worth the effort and mess your kitchen will be when its over. Restaurant quality-- actually, my husband said it tasted better than our local restaurant's. Followed recipe exactly except skipped the cucumber and used another type of dried mushrooms just because i couldn't find ones called for by recipe. Yields way more than four servings, in my opinion.

This was my first time making Moo-Shu and this recipe was great. I stuck to the recipe's ingrediants but made my own adjustments.I added extra garlic, grated alot of fresh ginger, used sesame oil instead of peanut, let the veggies saute first before adding the ham to soften them (especially the cucumber), minced the mushrooms in a food processor, added an extra egg and used about 1lb.of ham. It's delicious! Admittedly,I've never been good at kneading dough but it was well worth it. Easy, quick, aromatic & fun! Try this recipe, use all the ingrediants & adjust accordingly. You will love it!

This was good and I would make it again. The ginger seasoning is mild, so the kids liked it. The pancakes were easier than I would have thought - my 7 year old rolled them out. I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so used regular mushrooms,ground turkey in place of the pork and sesame oil in place of peanut oil.

This was good, but I wasn't wowed. I accidentally bought "regular" cabbage, and it was way too tough, and the mushrooms (I could only find fresh wood ear and dried shitake) were a bit overpowering. I would have I also thought the proportions seemed a little off. For that much cabbage and mushroom, I would have wanted more pork and/or eggs. The pancakes, though, were great. Not as difficult to make as I thought they would be, and much, much tastier than the ones I get with take out (which I never even eat.) I only made half the recipe, which seemed like plenty. Overall, I think with a few modifications, I will love this.

Very good -- one suggestion. Remove meat after it's cooked and cook vegetables alone. Cook them till they release their liquid and then let the liquid cook down until the vegs become dry. Then add back the meat, sauce and eggs. Do this so the meat doesn't overcook as it boils in the thrown off veg liquid.

This was awesome! I skipped the cucumber, used fresh black fungus instead of dried, and put hoisin in the pancakes with the moo-shu. As some others I also julienned the ingredients for the stir-fry as they do in most restaurants. Surprisingly good recipe, I need to find more like this one!

I had a smallish pork tenderloin that needed to be cooked. While it's not really fair to rate a recipe with a bunch of substitutions, it came out great so I am anyway! :D I didn't have the dried black mushrooms, scallions, cabbage or cuke. I also cut way back on the oil trying to cut out calories. I also used mirin. I had brussel sprouts so finely sliced them to replace the cabbage. Added juiliened carrots and celery and chopped onion. Everything else was per the recipe. It was really good. Next time maybe more eggs and maybe a touch of heat.

This was excellent! Far better than I have had in most restaurants. The only thing I did differently was to use two already cooked pork chops in place of the pork butt. I simply chopped it finely and sauteed as called for, but for less time. We served it the next day to my parents, having set aside some pancakes uncooked the night before.

This is extremely good; actually better than take-out because it doesn't add bamboo shoots. The only alteration I made was to use zucchini instead of the cukes, because I was concerned about how the cukes would fare as leftovers (and I wanted to freeze the leftovers for work lunches.) I also added a squeeze of hoisin sauce to each pancake-full because it adds that extra something.

This recipe is fabulous! We make Moo-Shu Pork about once every six weeks, and had always used the "other" Epicurious recipe -- which by the way -- is good but not the delight this one is. Trial one followed the recipe exactly. Two of us ate 4 servings! Second try, used Zuchini, green and red peppers instead of cabbage and cucumber. Also great. We have always used our own pancake recipe which includes green onions (pulsed in a food processor) -- really crepes made with a crepe maker, but the recipe provided works well -- think about using your pasta maker rather than a rolling pin. Also, do no longer know where the idea came from, but we also serve crisp lettuce leaves to wrap the Moo-Shu Pork in. A pancake with filling, followed by crisp lettuce encasing Moo-Shu Pork is great. With lettuce, this is probably some other dish, but try it anyway. Remove the other Moo-Shu Pork from your recipe box. This is the one to use.

mmm... this was great and tasted way better than my local chinese spot. I will admit, I took a few ingredient detours and I don't think the recipe suffered too much. I didn't make the pancakes and substituted flour tortillas instead. I also added a small bag of pre-shredded cabbage instead of cutting it up fresh cabbage because i had one in the fridge. I used regular button mushroom and the Chinese mushrooms instead of shitake-- again, I had button in the fridge (and fortunately the dried ones in the cupboard, to me, they are essential). I also used ground beef but that doesn't really count as it is mentioned in the intro- and I wouldn't do that again. I prefer the taste of pork in these. But, for all these changes it really was super! mmm! Can't wait to make it again!

Absolutely the best EVER! Followed the directions to the "T" and nothing went wrong. The key to this recipe is to have everything ready in separate bowls before you start. I ended up purchasing frozen Moo-Shu pancakes from Hong Kong Market a few miles down the road. Can't wait to make another recipe from the 80 dish series. FUN!

I have a question. I always assumed the pancakes in moo shu were made with rice flour? Is that not true? Or does it not matter?

I love and would make the following changes added chili garlic sauce before serving, and I would buy flour tortilla's to save a little oil them up with the sesame oil and peanut oil and pan fry them.

Wow - great recipe! Found this in video section and loved the explanations by Chef Cheng and how she made this look so easy. My husband and I both loved the perfectly balanced flavors - he said better than our local restaurant! The chef filled in gaps in the recipe (things you can't detail enough in a recipe) and allowed me to be comfortable with this new recipe and a couple of changes I had to make (couldn't find the wine and white wine all we had) - it turned out great. Don't know if I could have done the pancakes without her demo - these have challenges but were wonderful. Chef Cheng is a great teacher - will now try her other recipes. This recipe and video demos have made me a fan of Epicurious.

I liked this recipe but I shredded all the ingredients so that they would fit in the pancake better. That's how the Chinese place in my hometown does it. Everything rolls up nicely that way and you have less sauce running out the end and down your arm when you go to eat them. The pancakes take a few tries to get going right but once you get the feel for them, they come out just as good as the ones from the restaurant - maybe better as they have more flavor. It looked like a lot of food when we got done making it but it was enough for two and two more portions for lunch the next day.

Really good! I don't eat pork so I replaced this with TVP soaked in the marinade. I couldn't find the shaoshing rice wine, so I used Mirin, which was just fine. My husband was very skeptical at first watching me make the pancakes, but they do indeed come apart when steamed for a few secs. I think the recipe failed to mention, that putting the lid on the wok really helps. I'll make this again!

the simplicity of the recipe & the combination of flavors will make it an all time favorite!!! p.s. all the ingredients are accesible!

quite good. Although, I substituted green peppers for cukes. The peppers had a distinctive taste. I think I'll try it again as written with cukes. Or DH suggested water chestnuts or sprouts too.

This was absolutely rockin. There's definitely an art to the pancakes though: I found them challenging. I was worried about using too much sesame oil between the pancakes, but should have used more because many stuck together & ripped when seperating (I also rolled them too thin & they broke easily as a result). The amount of dough that it makes is enough for 30 pancakes - far more than you need for the recipe. I made 1/3 as much dough which seemed like an appropriate amount. Delicious recipe. Maybe the best tasting moo shu pork I've ever had.

Excellent, although we bought moo-shu wrappers instead of making these. Make sure to use Shaosing rice wine, as it's different from most rice wine you'd get at a megamart. We'll definitely make this again.
