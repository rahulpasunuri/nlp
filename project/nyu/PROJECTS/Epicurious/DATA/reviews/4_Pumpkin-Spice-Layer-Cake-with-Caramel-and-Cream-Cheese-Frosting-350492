I think this recipe is missing a bit of salt. Salt always enhances the flavor of sweets. I doubled the spices, but I think the missing salt is why it tends to taste bland. Wish I would have thought of it BEFORE I put the batter in the pans. The frosting is great! It was still a delicious cake. No compliants from my guests!

I found the cake to be incredibly bland even with doubling the spices. Not much pumpkin flavor, not much spice flavor. I did like that the cake wasn't overly sweet though. I really liked the frosting though! Adding cinnamon (as someone else here suggested) was a wonderful idea!

This cake is excellent. Those who reviewed it poorly most likely overbeat the dry ingrediants. You have to gently fold in and not overmix. Everyone who ate it raved about how delicious it was. I made exactly as written and used the Creamy Brown Sugar Frosting recipe from this site.

The cake was great and moist! The pumpkin or spices were not too overpowering. I did mess up the frosting a bit, but I saved it by skipping the caramel and adding cinnamon and vanilla to the butter/cream cheese/powered sugar mix. I am definitely making this cake again.

The cake itself was horribly bland even after a doubling of spices as suggested by others. The frosting, on the other hand, was yummylicious. The entire product was good only because of the frosting so I'll skip the cake and just keep the frosting recipe. For the frosting, I found that 1.25 cups of powdered sugar was good enough. I made 1.5 times the caramel (with granulated sugar) but I might just double it next time.

Terrible. Coarse textured cake. Bland flavor. There is NO pumpkin flavor at all. The best part was the icing. It was a very easy cake to make but the results were subpar. I don't quite understand the high reviews. I followed the recipe exactly. Everything went smoothly -- until the eating part. Good Luck with this one folks, I am removing it from my box.

This cake was delicious as is. It won super reviews at our church Thanksgiving dinner. However, I will next time fix the icing first and let it chill, by the time the cake is done and cooled the icing will be ready. Plan ahead and lay out your butter and cream cheese a hour before you plan to begin. I have made the icing three times. I found that I add the cream as soon as the sugar melts and it does not burn. Be sure and have the ingredients for the carmel premeasured and set out close, for once the sugar melts things move quickly.

Wow... so good! I honestly thought as I was making it and when I pulled the cake out of the oven that it wasn't going to be good, but I was wrong. Once it cools down and combined with the frosting, its a perfect fall cake. Doubling the spices is a must! Except the orange peel, which can be overwhelming. Also, make sure to not burn the caramel. I did two batches and there was a big difference between them, I cooked the first one a few minutes too long. Will definitely make again!

I was hoping for something more moist and pumpkin-y, but this was much more like a spice cake. Also the texture was a bit coarse, not surprising perhaps due the quickbread-method. I'll look for something with more pumpkin next time.

This was a hit at the dinner party. It stole the show from the rest of the dinner! I doubled the spices as suggested by reviewers and reduced the sugar in the frosting by a smidge. The frost is delicious and perfectly complements the cake flavor.

I made the frosting to use on a yellow cake (my husband's favorite birthday cake combination is yellow cake with caramel frosting--7 years in I am still working to find the right recipes for both). I follwed the other reviewers' suggestions to double the caramel. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T. The flavor was fantastic and intense. My husband liked it but thought it was super rich. I may lighten up some of the dairy ingredients next time. The icing was still fairly loose/ liquidy after chilling. I bet this would be amzing with the pumpkin cake.

I am VERY picky about the quality of my cakes, and I found this to be an exceptional cake. The textures and flavors of this cake are wonderful. Like others, I burnt my first batch of caramel, so watch very carefully as you make it! This caramel is a very finicky recipe, and changes from not done to too far done in a matter of seconds. Otherwise the recipe is very easy and straightforward.

I rarely review recipes, but I have to say that this one is AWESOME! be sure you taste the caramel before putting it into the frosting because I burned the first batch of caramel sauce and am so glad I tasted it before mixing it in. I re-made the caramel sauce and mixed it together with the creamcheese frosting and it was SO good!! The cake it so moist and has a great flavor! It is just an incredible cake!!

Truly delectable. Cannot praise this cake enough! I took the other reviewers' advice and doubled the amount of spices. I can't imagine how bland the cake would have been if I hadn't! The frosting was just perfect and really melded perfectly with the flavors of the cake. I did manage to find candied orange peel but we were so excited to dig in to the cake that we forgot to add it! Hardly missed it, though I am sure it would be good. I think this is a cake for all seasons, and it is quite easy to make. Even when I ruined the first batch of caramel it was not difficult to make another. If you haven't ever made caramel before, a couple words of advice: be patient and don't leave the stove!

Really exquisite. I enjoyed the flavors in the cake very much. The sugar content in the frosting, however, is ridiculous! I tasted the frosting after adding only half of the sugar and stopped there! I don't know who can tolerate a whole box of confectioners sugar in this frosting because it was delicious and perfectly sweet with much less. Otherwise, great recipe!

I made this recipe as cupcakes for a friend's birthday, who loves all things pumpkin and they turned out really well. In fact, they were gone rather quickly. Out of laziness, I actually used store-bought cream cheese frosting and everyone thought it was homemade.

This pumpkin cake turned out just like the photo. A good crumb and the orange flavor really complimented the pumpkin well and freshened the cake. I also increased the caramel slightly and added a bit less sugar to compensate. A nice change from the usual cream cheese frosting. Overall, a fabulous recipe!

WOW WOw.. It was the hit of the party last night. Not one piece left!! However I did make some minor changes.. Added 1 1/2 cups of semi sweet choc chips to the cake batter.. For the frosting I increased the caramel sauce by 50%... Can't say enough about it and this is coming from a Chocolate cake lover..

This was really easy to do. I doubled the spices in the cake but still found it bland. The frosting, however is quite spectacular and really helped to puch up the flavor.The frosting was a bit runnier than anticipated, but worked well under fondant icing. Next time, I'll triple the spice to see if that does it.

I ended up only using 1 cup sugar and doubled the spices in the cake and added a cup of walnuts and 1/2c raisins. Cut the sugar since the frosting sounded really sweet. The addition of walnuts and raisins made the difference. The cake could have stood on its own without the frosting. Frosting was great. Very neat how the powdered sugar melts. Takes a little bit of time. Makes a ton of frosting. Only used half. Mine was not as white as in the photos. More of a toffee color (which I sort of liked anyway). Great cake and fun to make!!!

I only made the frosting -- it's delicious with a pronounced caramel flavor. Like a previous reviewer, I used granulated sugar to make the caramel, then powdered sugar to continue. Definitely adds time to the standard cream cheese frosting recipe, but the difference is worth it.

I just used this recipe for the frosting. I made it for a Caramel Apple Spice cake I made. Inspired by Starbucks Caramel Apple Spice drink. It was great. I think a bit sweet but that means the cake needs to be a bit less sweet. It was also very soft but to achieve the right amount of caramel flavor I made a double batch of the caramel and used one and a third. The rest I added to a thick simple syrup to use for a caramel drizzle between layers. It turned out really well. Now, I am interested in making this entire recipe sometime next fall.

This recipe was seriously simple and got RAVE reviews. I didn't have cardamon or candied orange peel and it was fine. Also, I used 8 inch rounds. It took a little longer to cook, but turned out fabulous. Also, I wasn't sure how much icing to put between the layers and may have underdone it a little. Next time I'll be more generous! The orange zest was a great subtle flavor.

Rating: 4
This recipe was really delicious and a definite keeper! Be sure to use all of the frosting, adding a thick layer of frosting between the layers, as the cake itself is not particularly sweet and the frosting is heavenly. Next time that I make this frosting, I will caramelize more of the sugar for an even stronger caramel flavor--it was so tasty!! I used two 8" pans with 2" high sides and it was fine--I like really tall cakes. It needed an extra 10 minutes or so in the oven.

This recipe was a huge hit! It's been requested that I make it again and again for the holidays. I doubled the spices (except cardamom, I'm not a huge fan) as others recommended and it was perfectly spiced. The frosting was the best part and I found the recipe as written to make the right amount of frosting (I know others thought it was too little).

This was mediocre. The cake itself was a bit bland (though I did increase the spice amounts as others suggested and this seemed to help a bit). The frosting was sticky-sweet and overall just not an interesting contrast of flavors and/or consistencies.

Fabulous cake! It was the first one I've ever made (not out of a box!). I did use caramel topping instead of making my own, as other users recommended, and it turned out great. Made both the day before and refrigerated--iced the day of (1/2 hr before serving). The icing does come out a little runny. I made the candied orange peel--very easy and really made the the difference between an OK cake and a great one. My guests were very impressed and I've been asked to make it again for Xmas eve. A great recipe-especially for first time bakers!

I am not a baker but this turned out beautifully for me. I followed the recipe but amped up the spices after reading the reviews. When I make this again (and I will!) I will add salt to the batter - I thought it needed it. The frosting was so tasty and much easier than I feared! Make sure you let it set in the fridge for a while, mine was a perfect frosting consistency after ~2 hours. Delicious and pretty!

I made this cake for Thanksgiving and it was excellent and everyone LOVED it. Now when I tell people about it who haven't even had it before, they want the recipe. I thought at first the powdered sugar wasn't going to melt but it did beautifully. Everything was great. I am going to make it again this week and I will try more spice in the cake this time since someone mentioned it. I love this cake!

I thought this was really easy to put together. I made it with my 2 year old for dinner this weekend. Ease of assembly earns the recipe 4 forks. However I have 3 complaints: First, I don't think the "spice" in the "pumpkin spice" was assertive enough. I would add more spices next time. Second, the confectioner's sugar does not melt the same way regular sugar does and I think that regular white sugar should have been used for the caramel instead. Third, the frosting was kind of runny. All in all, I would make it again because of the ease of assembly, but would alter the recipe to improve the taste. The three fork rating comes from my husband; I might have given it two forks.

This was a delicious cake. Following the recipe directions, I made my own caramel, and the frosting came out darker than in the pictures. Mom loved it so much, she wanted JUST the frosting recipe! I thought the frosting was VERY sweet - if I made it again, I might use a bit less powdered sugar with the cream cheese/butter. Despite all of the spices that went into the cake, it wasn't very "spicy." The candied orange peel we found was chunks - not nearly as pretty as the picture. In any case, this cake was very popular - even after a HUGE turkey dinner - the ultimate compliment!

Rating: 4
I highly recommend this cake. The layers were moist and flavorful and the caramel frosting was the perfect complement. The candied orange peel looked pretty on top too. I made the cake layers and frosting the day before Thanksgiving and assembled the cake after dinner while everyone was recovering from stuffing themselves. I let the frosting sit out about 20 mins (after pulling it from the fridge) until it reached the perfect spreading consistency. I was worried there wouldn't be enough frosting, but there was plenty. It's super sweet, so a little goes a long way. I will make this again!

Holy cow this was good. I went all over looking for candied orange peel to no avail, so we just added a little orange extract to the frosting and it was absolutely perfect. As others, I used a "top end" store-bought caramel sauce and really cut down on the prep time. The cake is incredibly moist and got rave reviews from everyone. DELICIOUS!

I started making this cake at 3pm and served it by 8pm. It was very easy to make and very delicious. The icing was exceptional and did not have the problem of it being too thin. I actually sliced each cake in half and iced inbetween layers and still had enough to cover the cake. I will definitely make again.

The cake itself was tasty but a bit boring - the real winner here was the frosting, which was absolutely delicious. Next time I'll make 1.5 times the amount of frosting, as the cake could have used more frosting between the layers.

Wonderful cake!! Easy to make, I did not have 9" rounds and used a 9x13" pan and spread the frosting on top, simple and easy. The carmel did clump a bit, so add the cream slowly. I put the frosting in the fridge for about 15 minutes before trying to spread

A delicious, moist, substantial cake! Frosting was wonderful. Like another reviewer, I used caramel sauce from a jar due to time constraints and it was fine. Wonderful cake for Fall, the caramel made the frosting a rich beige color and with the beautiful pumpkin cake it was just lovely. I made it for our family Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.

Excellent cake and even better frosting. Served as part of a TG dinner and guests said it was great. The frosting made the cake. I think the few people who did not try the cake was because I said it was a Pumpkin Spice cake. I think you like/love pumpkin or you don't. Again, those that had the cake loved it. Will make again for sure. The only change I might make in the recipe is decorating the cake itself...perhaps put chopped walnuts or pecans on the top and sides of the frosted cake. And also...you must make the frosting the night before so that it sets.

This is a great cake. My mother who is not usually a desert fan raved about the frosting. My toddler also could not stop saying "Mmmm...Good." I thought the cake got done a little fast. I took it out after 25 minutes. I was worried the caramel was too "burnt" tasting but the sugar in the frosting balanced it out. This is a new Thanksgiving tradition at our house.

Very nice cake! I used pumpkin pie spice to save time, and followed the frosting recipe pretty closely -- awesome icing!!! I didn't have problems with it being to soft, but I always make icing with room temperature butter and cold cream cheese. And you can always add powdered sugar to stiffen it up.

This was so good! The cake itself is not much more difficult than making something out of a box. The frosting is a bit more time consuming, but not by much and the rewards are great. By itself, the cake tasted fine, nothing life-changing. With the frosting, it's delicious. With the frosting and a bit of candied orange zest - phenomenal! I made everything exactly as written. The cake was done in less than 30 minutes (more like 25), but that may be because I live in a higher altitude and the weather is a bit dry right now. Enjoy!

this was a very nice cake. the cake layers were super easy to make and very flavorful and moist. the icing was delicious. i do disagree with one step in the instructions however. the instructions suggest using a nonstick pan to make the caramel. i did this the first time and had poor results (caramel clumped and hardened). i had to make the caramel over. you need a heavy pan that heats evenly. i used a stainless all-clad the second time (didn't seem to matter that it wasn't nonstick) the other key step was to whisk the cream in very slowly to the caramelized sugar.

I know you have seen this before but.... I made this for a friends birthday party and everyone raved! Aside from the fact that hardly anyone makes cakes from scratch anymore so no one's expectations are very high - this really was a great, moist, flavorful cake. The cardamon adds a subtly of flavor that other spice cake recipes I've used lack so be sure not to omit it. Buy a small jar of it from Penzy's spices. It is worth the $4.50 or so. I used 3 9"layer pans and just piled the icing between the layers - leaving the sides bare. It looked as great as it tasted. The other reviewer was right about the caramel. If you are short on time use a good bottled caramel sauce from the store. I've made it both ways and couldn't tell the difference.

This cake was wonderful and the frosting amazing. I got great reviews, even from people who told me they normally dont like pumpkin. On the frosting, I did let the sugar get pretty dark before adding the cream and I was worried I may have let it get too dark, but the deeper flavor was balanced well by the cream cheese. Also, I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned. Since I had to puree the pumpkin in the blender, I just went ahead and mixed all the wet ingredients in the blender (still adding eggs one at a time)  then just whisking together quickly in a bowl with the dry ingredients.

I was somewhat reluctant to bake a cake for dessert, but my company really enjoyed this one! I followed the directions exactly. When I took the cake from the oven I was certain it was going to be tasteless and dry. Boy, was I wrong! I levelled the layers and found a moist cake with a great flavor (with and without the frosting!) I was only able to find chopped candied orange peel, rather than the delicate strips, but it worked out fine. I also added crushed walnuts as a border around the top of the cake. I would definitely make this again. Easy with great results!

Boy this cake looked and sounded so unique and good and other reviewers raved, so I made it. And....it just wasn't that good, at all. I don't know what all the talk was about. The cake has so many great spices in the recipe and the end result was BLAND. I followed everything exactly and even remade the caramel (because it burned having followed the recipe exactly). The frosting set, it had a hint of caramel flavor and atop the moist (bland) pumpkin cake, it still wasn't very good. Everyone else seemed to like the cake ok, but no rave reviews. I think their sweet tooth got in the way of an honest critique. Don't go in with great expectations the way I did. You will be disappointed. There has got to be a better recipe out there.

This cake was a definite success! I had all the spices except for cardamom, but when I found the only bottle they had of it the grocery store was $16, I decided to do without. There were plenty of other spices in it and I don't feel I lost out on anything. I was a little unsure of how the frosting was going to turn out, as I've never made caramel before. I had no issues with spreadability (although my frosting was decidedly more orange than the photo). All in all...it was a delicious cake and would make it again!!

Thank you for this wonderful cake recipe! The only modifications I made included adding 1/2 tsp. salt to the cake. I did not make the caramel sauce but chose to use already prepared caramel sauce and it was delicious; I used about 1/3 cup or so. The orange rind and candied orange rind make this cake extra special. I could not find candied orange rind at my local grocery store, so I used a recipe found on this web site for Pots de Creme with candied orange rind. Wonderful! By all means, try this recipe!

this cake is to die for. moist and delicious, just perfect. i baked it for 29 minutes which might just be a fluke in my oven. i did cheat all over the place: instead of making my own caramel sauce, which i am perfectly capable of doing, i used bottled caramel sauce--about 1/3 cup. worked perfect. and it didn't need to chill for 2 hours, maybe only 1 hour. also, i used purchased candied orange peel which wasn't so pretty as the homemade and maybe didn't add so much to the presentation. the pumpkin spice cake in the 12/02 bon appetite was prettier--and yes, i made my own caramel sauce for that one. but this cake tasted great and the icing, even with the store- bought caramel, was a definite hit with everyone who ate it.

This cake is delicious and rather simple to make too...including the homemade caramel. I made exactly as written (minus the decorative candied orange peel). My husband doesn't really like pumpkin, but he said the frosting was possibly the best frosting he has ever had. I had no issues with the stiffness of the frosting and didn't even refrigerate it as long as prescribed - didn't have the patience. The only change I'd make next time is to leave out the grated orange zest from the cake. I'd like a little more of the pumpkin flavor to come through. Got rave reviews from everyone at work and the in- laws (except for the one person who doesn't like orange flavor). Gorgeous and tasty!

Made this cake for friends visiting for the weekend. It was a big hit!!! I used 2 teas. of pumpkin pie spice instead of buying all the spices. I used a 1/2 cup of Carmel topping instead of making the carmel. I did refrigerate for 2 hours and was a little runny but I believe it is because of the humidty, living in the low country. It happens any time I frost a cake. I would use the carmel topping again. I don't think you will miss using the substitutions

Made the cake and frosting for Canadian Thanksgiving dinner (along with a salted turkey and the carmelized apple pecan tart!). Delicious taste, but the icing did not firm up enough - one of those looks not so good but tastes wonderful recipes. I will make the cake again, but will use a different cream cheese icing resipe.
