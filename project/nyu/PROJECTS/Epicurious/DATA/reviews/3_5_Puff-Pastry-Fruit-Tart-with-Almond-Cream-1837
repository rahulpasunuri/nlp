Great way to make use of fruits before they expire. Yes, use the powdered sugar on the pastry and add a 1/4 teaspoon of rum and more cream to the almond paste to thin it out. I also chose to put the entire pastry back in the oven after adding the fruit, and jam glaze to soften the fruits a bit. This was a hit and took minimal effort / prep time.

I used individual- sized pie crusts instead of the puff pastry for a good variation on the original recipe. I also add a bit more cream to the almond paste to offset the strong almond taste.

I made this tart with peaches and blackberries. Per a previous reviewer's suggestion, I sprinkled the pastry edges with sugar to sweeten it a little. I also rolled the dough out directly onto a Silpat, to ease transfer to the baking sheet. A very good result for minimal efforts.

unfortunately this recipe leaves out instrux on the key step in which you transport what is a slippery, egg-glazed piece of raw dough from "work surface" to ... where? and how? it's a major pain in the a**

Just OK. Everyone liked it but no one raved. I think that the problem was that the crust wasn't sweet at all. A dusting of powdered sugar might solve that. I also cut down on the almond paste for the filling as suggested by others.

Fabulous. I used sour cherries and the contrast between the sweet and tart worked very well.

Good, but the best fruit tart I make that EVERYONE loves is easier and tastes better. Roll out puff pastry into 10" square, cut out four 5" rounds. Place on baking sheet, crimp edges up a bit. Peel/core 2 Golden Delicious apples & cut into thin strips. Place on pastry rounds in ovelapping circles. Sprinkle with 2 TB. (total) brown sugar & dot w/butter. Bake @ 375 about 20 min.; place on plates, place scoop of vanilla ice cream to one edge of tart, drizzle with caramel sauce. Absolutely delicious, light and easy!

interesting flavor, only recommended if you seriously enjoy almond marzipan.

I can't believe how incredibly EASY it was to make this spectacular looking and delicious tasting dessert. Very impressive for a party or a brunch. Ginger in the glaze added a special touch- not overwhelming at all. I am sure I will now keep this recipe in my repetoire for many more years to come.

To the cook from Freehold NJ, you don't need to put this in a tart pan, but if you have a square one i suppose you could, the puff pastry dough holds it shape on its own. i've made a similar tart like this for years, but with regular pate brisee (pie crust), however the puff pastry puts a nice spin on it. i left the ginger out completely...i just didn't want to chance adding that particular flavor, it's delicious, and pure without it. you can make your own "almond cream" (frangipane) simply and easily and i prefer to do it as i find the store bought frangipane to be hard and difficult to work with at times. to make your own you need only a few easy ingredients (for an 11" tart): 3/4 cup almonds, ground fine in food processor, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 large egg, 1 tsp almond extract, 1 T. flavored liqeur like amaretto or frangelico...grind the almonds in food processor, add sugar, egg, flavorings and flour and that's it! delicious and sublime!

I feel silly asking this, but do you just place the puff pastry on a cookie sheet? Or can you bake it in a tart pan?

This is one of the best fruit tarts I have ever had! My guests devoured it and begged for more! If you cant find the almond paste (like me)just whip vanilla extract and a litte honey with the whipping cream. It turned out perfect. I have made it twice now.

I expected this to be ambrosia of the gods after reading the raves! It was good, but I thought the ginger in the glaze was overpowering and detracted from the fresh fruit. I will make it again, with just a pinch of ginger, or maybe vanilla instead.

My "foodie" friends raved about this. People unfamiliar with puff pastry might consult package directions. Like another reviewer, I added extra cream to the almond paste and made two tarts, and there was plenty of almond flavor. One tart fed about seven of us. So much better than the local bakery!

What a wonderfully easy and impressive dessert! Topped with fresh strawberries, kiwi, and raspberries. My guest thought I labored over it! Next time, I am going to try a more subtle approach to the almond filling. Instead of almond paste, I will make the filling from the French Apple Tart, which uses finely ground slivered almonds, cream, and sugar with hint of vanilla & lemon. Results are much more delicate and custard-like. In either case, if you're looking for a homemade EASY dessert..this is the one!

I tried this for a party and it was a hit. It baked beautifully and looked great. I actually was able to make two pastries using the entire 7 oz. can (I just added a little bit of extra cream and spread it thinly.)I used fresh raspberries and kiwis and alternated two rows of each. Great for company!

I made this last night. It was a big hit! I used the Kiwi's, banana's, and strawberries on top. We thought it would taste good with all strawberries and add whipped cream on top.
