Are you kiddin' me? SUCH a wonderful dish. Initially, I was a bit intimidated (I had never prepared duck), but everything turned out just fine. I served this alongside a basic risotto with a hint of orange and cinnamon to rave reviews. I would say I was quite pleased with myself, but really I was just pleased with this 1994 Gourmet recipe. The rich flavors of the duck and risotto paired nicely with a red burgundy. I'd make this again for company or a special meal.

The recipe was pretty good. I think dried apricots should be chopped and added with the carrots etc. I also think a cinnamon stick in the marinade portion (not cooking portion) would be a good addition. I served it all with some couscous. YUM!

I don't understand the raves on the onions and pears - they were ok, but nothing spectacular. Maybe the reviewers had never roasted pears or onions before? You really have to brush the onions with oil, or the tops will burn. As my son said, "They tasted like onions and pears." No big rave. The duck was tasty and the sauce excellent, but it will depend entirely on the quality of the wine, so making it with Two-buck-Chuck won't cut it. I'd make the duck again.

Really great dish. I follwed the recipe as is, but after the braising there was no need to reduce the sauce as it was already less than 2 cups, so in fact I had to add some water. I did make a duck a day in advance and it was excellent.

Perfect for doing ahead and the pears & onions combination was spectacular. I doubled the recipe and put the duck legs in the slow cooker - the meat fell off the bone. I also used the recipe with 2 chicken marylands for 2 of my dinner party guests that don't eat duck. I was a bit doubtful about putting the carrots/onions mixture back in the sauce but it was excellent.

Forget the duck! The onion and pear side dish is great. I used cippolini onions and bosc pears. Instead of 2 tsp honey, I used 1 tsp, and two tbs of maple syrup and juice of a whole lemon.

An absolutely spectacular dish. Would not change a thing. Especially liked the roasted pears and onions. I plan to use this side dish again with other main courses.

Agree with previous reviewer on using oil with the butter to hinder burning. I embellished the recipe by using 8 legs, doubling the amount of seasoning in the marinade, and marinating overnight, chilled (the legs absorbed much of the wine). I then followed the recipe, but added more liquid/wine to cover legs, and adjusted seasonings in the reduced, thickened braising liquid. Very tasty reduction, provided you taste and adjust seasonings. My wine tasting group thought it excellent fare for the Pinot Noir's we were sampling.

I have made the onions/pears dish twice; my guests loved it both times. Served with braised lamb shanks once and braised short ribs the second. The only change I made was to add oil with the butter as the latter tends to burn.

The roasted pears and onions were perfect, and will be part of my repertoire from now on. The duck in wine just didn't do it--I followed the recipe scrupulously, but it didn't really come together. Too much wine, perhaps, or maybe one should run the whole thing through a blender to get a smoother flavour.
