Used this with a triple berry pie and with a chocolate pecan tort and it was delicious with each. Had trouble rolling one disk but I think it was user error. With second disk I made sure work surface was well floured, rolled half-way out, flipped, rolled remainder, and transferred to pie plate without a problem. Even with the first disk I made repairs before filling and no one was the wiser.

2 of us tried this recipe independently, and it just didn't come together for either of us. It was dry and mealy. If it was just me, I'd assume user error. But the other had the same problem. That said, I still think that the proportions appear right.
