I bought all the ice creams and sorbets out of convenience. It was super easy. It just takes time to freeze all the layers. Going with this layering concept you could change all the flavors and come up with something else entirely, but this combination was yummy. Mango ice cream alone wasn't great, but layered in here it was perfect.

We liked this very much. It's a beautiful, refreshing summer dessert. The raspberry sorbet is fantastic, and the layered colors are gorgeous. I'd definitely make again.

This dessert was beautiful and received big accolades. It was a little more difficult than the recipe led me to believe it would be. Freezing 10 minutes between layers was a must, not just an option as stated in the recipe. Be sure to make the raspberry sorbet a day or two in advance and give yourself plenty of time for assembling so that you have the 8 hours of freezing before serving. I made the whole thing in one day which was a bit taxing. Take advantage of the fact the entire dessert can be assembled days in advance. Also, to get the colors just right, I used Hagaan Daaz mango ice cream, Sorbetto Mango sorbet, and of course, made the raspberry in my ice cream maker. There are some kinds of mango sorbet that are the same color as the raspberry so watch out or the dessert won't have the same flair. Also, my pan was the exact dimensions but I didn't have room for the final layer of raspberry. It was still beautiful with one layer of raspberry in the center. I garnished with mint and fresh raspberries and a white Pirouline-style cookie diagonal across the slice. Beautiful presentation!!!
