Ensure that your persimmons are ripe otherwise you will get a strange taste that stays in your mouth. This makes a large batch, I threw a tangerine - with skin - into the Cuisinart and added it to this because I felt the flavor was lacking a little. Tasted exceptional after that.

I made this but market was out of basil & used a different species of Persimmon. Salsa was still delish! Next time will use the fuyu persimmons because the other kind were kind of slimey textured. I will make this again especially in the summertime. I would also substitue mango for the Persimmon.

We absolutely loved this salsa! The only change we made was more serrano and we left the seeds in because we love spicy food. The first night we served it over pork medallions as suggested by another reviewer. Then, we had so much pork leftover, we threw it in the crockpot with a bit of el pato jalapeno salsa (simple canned salsa with no preservatives that's good in these situations!) and made tacos of the pulled pork served with the persimmon salsa and sour cream on corn tortillas the next night. Tasted great both ways. The combination of flavors is so delicious and the salsa itself is beautiful. Looking forward to figuring out new ways to enjoy this!

At first I was disappointed that the consistency wasn't much like salsa. However, I took this salsa to a party and it was a big hit. I left it on a table and and came back later to find several people eating it and speculating on what was in it. Very interesting mix of flavors.

What a great way to use Fuyu persimmons! My husband made this recipe, but omitted the ginger and mint, and it was still great. Next time, I'm going to try this with the ginger and mint. We also did not have fresh chilis, so we used chili powder.

This was great. I made it as written but with frozen mint and one thai chili. It went well with pan fried pork medallions and rocket and tomato salad.

At first taste I wasn't sure about the ginger but then the flavors just blended so very nicely. My husband made it to the recipe and we'd surely make it again. If you don't like it hot, reduce the amount of serranos. But we like it hot!

Great combination of flavors.
