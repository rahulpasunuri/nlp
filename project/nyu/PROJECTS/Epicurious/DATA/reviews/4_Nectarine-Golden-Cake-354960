Delicious without being too sweet - works well as a brunch dish. We prefer peaches rather than nectarines.

4 forks because it's easy, fast, and yet fancy enough for company. To those who say theirs didn't rise much -- I'd suggest making sure your baking powder is less than 6 months open. I used nectarines and some blackberries; I don't suggest nectarines alone because the flavor isn't that striking (though my fruit was August-perfect). I can see where lots of stone fruits and berries would work well. A little vanilla frozen yogurt on the side was a great addition.

This is one of the tastiest and easiest cakes I've ever made! I am going to make it again and again and plan to use other fruits, too! A no-brainer!!

This is my go-to summer dessert. Easy and delicious. I bake mine in a pie plate when we are at the cabin, and it turns out fine with a foil tent for the last few minutes of baking to keep the thinner edges from getting too dark.

So simple, but delicious. I had a small handful of tart cherries from our tree, so used those as the fruit (supplemented with a half a peach, chopped, when I discovered there weren't quite enough cherries). Sprinkled with a bit extra sugar since cherries are more tart than nectarines. The fruit ended up submerged into the cake providing a surprise in each bite. I would definitely make again, substituting whatever is around. The cake's texture is not like a typical butter cake, more like a financier would be without the ground almonds. Delightfully buttery and crumbly, not dry, with a lovely firm crust around the edge that was almost the best part (my 9 y.o. son did not like the crust, however). Just a very nice summer treat that was easily as good the next day for breakfast.

Stick of butter is 4 oz. ( 8 tablespoons) here in the lower 48.

Does anyone know the measurement of a 'stick' of butter? We have a few sizes in Canada.

Have been saving this recipe to try for ages... just made it for the first time as a little house-warming gift for a friend and just saw the kids removed several slices! SO I had to try it - absolutely delicious! Incredibly light crumb, beautiful rustic presentation but looks like it came from a bakery. A must add to anyone's recipe box. Quite sure as other reviewers have noted, almost any ripe summer fruit would be equally divine the basic recipe is so good.

This is so easy to make, and lovely to look at. It would work for any type of occasion, from weeknight dessert with the family to a casual dinner party. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

I have made this cake at least 5 times in the past few months since discovering the recipe. Everyone asks if I bought it at a bakery! It is so simple to make, and absolutely delicious. I have used both nectarines and peaches and to add color Id dropped a few blackberries or frozen raspberries on top before baking. For a more exotic flavor crush a few cardamom seeds and mix into the batter. This batter is very dense. For a lighter, fluffier cake Ive added 1-2 tablespoons of sour cream. This is a very flexible base recipe, you cant go wrong!

for "a cook in ontario" I did not peel them,I don't think it's needed. This is an excellent and super easy cake! I reccomend it highly for a quick light dessert.

A question.....it does not state in the recipe, but do you peel the nectarines?

i've made this cake a number of times - plums, pluots, nectarines, they all work really well. i'm making it tonight with cherrys and very excited to taste it! it is so simple, quick, and delicious!

This is a lovely, not-too-sweet treat. Served it with whipped cream ... they came back for seconds.

I made this last Friday and everyone loved it so much I made another one with blueberries folded into the batter and then put nectarines on top, I also tried it with half muscovado sugar and half brown sugar and it gave it a slight caramel taste - absolutely yummy. I think the recipe works with any stoned fruits. I shall try plums and raspberries next week. :) SUPER!

This recipe was very easy and delicious. My grocery store had no fresh nectarines or peaches so I had to use frozen peaches but they worked perfectly. It was very well received at the Young At Heart luncheon I took it to at my church. I can't wait to try it again with the fresh nectarines!

Easy, simple and good. Made exactly as in recipe and once with pears and brown sugar during the fall. A keeper to change with the fruit in season.

I have to say it: This was a piece of cake. Seriously. This was so easy to make. It doesn't rise a lot but it still is quite showy. Excellent plain but I could see serving it with whipped cream, marscapone or ice cream. The sugar topping is a must. Excellent touch. Could work well with other fruits too. I'd love to try it with a Pluot when they're back in season. Totally company worthy.

This cake was delightfully simple to make and came out of the oven perfect and delicious. I really have no more to ask from a recipe!

Easy to make, nice flavor. Would probably use peaches next time, for more sweetness. The best part is the browned, chewy edge. Family finished it off before breakfast. Used a 10 inch pan, and still worked out fine with same cooking time and temp.

While I am an experienced cook, I am a novice baker. This cake looked and tasted just fantastic. Not too sweet and the cake puffs up and around whatever design you lay the nectarine slices in, so presentation is lovely. I think I "rounded" my 1/4 teaspoon of salt too much. Would recommend just a standard 1/4 t. Subbed amaretto for almond extract with good results.

I loved this cake--not only because of the wonderful flavor but because of how easy it is to prepare, espcially for those of us who are baking-challenged. BUT--I've made this twice now and both times the cake did not rise above the fruit as it's supposed to. Any ideas what I may be doing wrong?

Good cake. Not real sweet so if you like a sweeter coffee cake be sure to make more of the sugar and nutmeg mixture to sprinkle on top.

This is not at all what I expected; I won't be making this again. It's hard to produce a great peach flavor in baked goods, and this recipe simply makes that apparent.

YUM ! This cake is fabulous and so easy. I made it for my husband to take to work and we ate half of it before he could leave. The only change I made was that I cut the nectarines into chunks.

I made a few minor changes after reading the recipes and reviews, and I thought I turned out delicious. Yes, it is a coarse style of cake, but just as it should be, here. I had pluots, not nectarines, so used about 4 of those, and made sure to tuck them into the batter. I topped with ~1.5T coarse raw sugar mixed with 0.5t of mace. I stirred another 0.5t of mace into the flour. Cake was done around 40min. Yum!

This was just ok. Defintely simple to make, but I thought the cake portion was a little dry. Next time might drizzle a little juice over it while hot.

I made this last night and served it barely warm with a dollop of french vanilla ice cream on the side. It was delicious! I plan on making this again using mangos instead of nectarines. IMHO my cake looked better than the photo in Gourmet. This is a very simple recipe that I fully recommend.

This was really delicious, somewhere between a traditional almond tart (frangipane) and a sweet biscuit. It is important to use the best fruit you can find. I thought I could hide some of my smaller, more bitter nectarines in here; that all the sugar and flavorings would compensate. Just the opposite! Even with the occasional bite of bitter nectarine, this was still delicious.

Very good, so simple and easy. My cake browned a bit more than I would have liked so I would just make sure you check on the progress while baking.

This recipe first appeared in the NYT in 1989 as The Plum Torte by Marian Burros. I have been making it with French plums, apples and fresh cranberries, peaches, and apricots for years.

Rating: 3
Tasty and very simple to make. I agree with a previous reviewer that it is almost better for breakfast (with coffee or tea) than after a meal. I am glad I arranged the nectarine slices carefully, however, as the batter did not puff up to cover them: it was a lovely effect. Next time I will try it with whipped cream or ice cream.

As usual, Gourmet arrives in mail and I immediately browse thru - N for nectarines caught my eye. Delighted to learn it only used 2 nectarines since was all that remained in my market basket! This recipe is quick and easy and delicious! I have shared the cake and the recipe - Thank you!

This was easy to prepare and quite good. It wasn't too sweet and certainly not that rich but a nice little desert (or breakfast as we had the following morning with our coffee) to have with a scoop of tart, honey ice cream. Every bite had a slice of nectarine. It was wonderful.

What a wonderful recipe. I used butter substitute and Splenda baking mix and this came out incredibly tasty. Also, as I really don't care for nutmeg, I used cardamom instead and made fresh whipped cream to put on top. Great, great taste!

This was delicious! The recipe was so easy that I had the courage to convert it to a gluten-free recipe (my first attempt doing this) and my family loved it.

Wow this was good! Really fast and easy to make too. I made it as written, although I used less than two nectarines. My nectarines were quite large (about 8 oz each) and that was too much fruit for the top. Two small or one to one and a half large seems right to me. I think this will be a great recipe to improvise with also. I'm looking forward to trying it with different fruit, and maybe nuts too.
