Loved the idea, but the chocolate coating was way too hard to break into with a spoon.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but as an ice cream maker, I would recommend higher fat ice creams (like haagen daaz at 16% fat) as it will not melt as quickly as a ben & Jerry's (13% fat I think) or cheaper brands that will melt more quickly.

has anyone tried forming them in a bowl over an ice bath instead of working in the freezer?

It is a good treat to serve to kids at the poolside delight.The trick is to blast freeze the icecream and dip in melted and this would cause the chocolate to set immediately.serve it as ice-cream lollipops.

I have not tried this recipe yet....but it sounds fantastic! I am just wondering if anyone could tell me though....has anyone tried placing the ice cream balls on a cooling rack on top of a cookied sheet and then pouring the chocolate over the balls to coat them? Seems to me this would save alot of time and would make the process alot easier. The chocolate dripping through could be saved and used for something else.

I made these with the new Nestle Chocolatier 62% Cacoa morsels. OH MY GOD... absolutely amazing!

The comments were very helpful, this recipe is worth the hassle. I used it for a charity dinner for eight and my guests loved them. I used Haggen Daz Raspberry with pistachios and Vanilla Bean with chopped Almonds. I also used a giant bar of Trader Joe's Belguim Bittersweet Chocolate $3.95 each for 17.5 ounces and one bar of Valrhona bitersweet choclate $3.25 for 3.5 ounces...broke them up in pieces and finey chopped in my food processor, before putting in double boiler. I forgot the vegetable oil, but it did not seem to affect the outcome. Keep the warm bath on your counter & replace double boiler bowl if the lukewarm melted chocolate stops sticking to your icecream. Each ball was wonderful and worth the hassel!

This is a real taste treat, but tricky to execute. (1) Ice cream must be dense; (2) you must work inside the freezer so they won't defrost while you're working; (3) you should place them in frozen pie tins or on a small frozen cookie sheet before dipping in chocolate so that they won't melt while you're dipping; (4) the chocolate must be the right temperature or it won't stick to the ice cream if too cold and will melt the ice cream if too warm. Plan ahead and work fast, fast, fast. Once you get it right, the taste and texture of these little delights is a terrific surprise. Can't wait to serve them at my dinner party.

While I am sure this recipe would have been wonderful, the description claiming it was "easy" is far from true. The chocolate refused to stick to the ice cream after the second truffle and made such a mess that even the ingredients were a waste. The tips posted by other users may have saved this dessert from becoming a fiasco, but hadn't read them all. Beware-- this one is certainly not easy.

I made these for a party and they were a huge hit and didn't last long. Everyone was asking about how to make them. I found that working with smaller batches of chocolate was easier and less of a waste as the chocolate tends to get heavy and thick and does not stick to the ice cream. The other tip is to have a metal tray or pie plate in the freezer first, then use it to place your ice cream as you scoop, the shape holds up and less risk of melting.

I decided to try these for a recent dinner party and found that they were well worth the effort. My guests were impressed and the truffles turned out great. A few observations: It was very humid when I tried to scoop the ice cream into balls but I found clearing out and working directly IN the freezer was a huge help. I also found that Ben & Jerry's vanilla melted alot faster than Haagen Dazs' choclate and coffee - next time I will use all Haagen Dazs and will try strawberry! In the end they were worth the effort - A very nice change.

My freezer was not cold enough and my skills not advanced enough to pull this one off. As the first dozen balls began to melt and slide, and the coatings were holding tight to the chocolate that was on the parchment rather than the ice cream, I pulled out an extra chocolate cookie pie crust (meant for another dessert) and dumped the mess in there. I finished it with a drizzle of the remaining chocolate and nuts. Although it was not this recipie for sure, it was enjoyed by my guests and I thought the save worth mentioning in case others had the same problems.

After reading the comments, I decided to try to make this easier....I used much larger ice cream balls and put them in muffin tins I had in the freezer one by one. The next morning, I coated them one at a time...took one from the freezer; coated and returned it to the muffin tin before I took the next. Works like a dream. You will make fewer (that will be faster and less messy), and I rather like the larger size (mine were a little larger than golf balls).

Okay, this one is challenging, but worth it. People are very impressed when you bring these out. My advice: Freeze the cookie sheet, the spoon, every utensil you use. Don't let the ice cream touch your hands if you can help it, it will melt immediately. If you like white chocolate, try that because the consistency is much easier to work with--it doesn't get hard as quickly. I used strawberry ice cream with the white chocolate and it really was no problem. I used dark chocolate with coffee ice cream and almonds--much more difficult, but absolutely delicious. Make it in small batches. Once the chocolate hardens, it's almost impossible to reuse; heat a little up at a time and work with that. I also used a teaspoon scoop, it was plenty big enough for bite-size treats. Just give yourself a lot of time (and be patient) to make these. It has been over a week since the party and we are still eating the leftovers. They keep for a long time so make them as far in advance as you need to. People will appreciate your effort--anyone can buy store-bought frozen treats. Treat people to something special. (Also, regarding the first reviewer: don't blame a good recipe for some guy not calling you again...maybe you have other problems than your ice cream?)

I agree with other reviewers the recipe is time consuming however, this recipe isn't about making something quick & easy. Without sounding 100% crazy, it is similar to creating art, you don't just rush through it, you work with it. I thought the truffles tasted really nice but, creating them did require time & patience. My guests loved the treats and could tell we put time & love into making them. Sure, you can buy similar items at a store but they are not the same as homemade. I'll make again but will make it during a time when I am not rushed for anything.

I always use a little paraffin wax in my chocolate when I dip fresh strawberries. It works. I should try the cocoa butter though. And make sure you melt the chocolate in a double boiler.

Clearly this is a perfect dessert for someplace cold in the summer--not in my hometown of New Orleans! No matter how quickly I worked I could not get more than six balls of ice cream scooped before they were melting and sliding down the pan. I tried using a cold cookie sheet and working over a bed of ice but still with no success. Maybe I'll try this recipe again--in January!

If you're concerned about using vegetable oil, you can substitute cocoa butter (but probably need to go to a specialty food store for it). The extra fat thins out the chocolate making dipping easier.

The recipe stated it was easy. Perhaps easy, but very messy. I agree with one reviewer--the chocolate got hard and the ice cream melted before I could get it into the freezer. The taste was very good, however. I think a better idea would be to serve ice cream balls & serve the condiments over them.

Making a second time. First time the chocolate thickened. Second the ice cream began to melt. I used the concept to added nuts then chocolate to a small papercup added a raspberry, ice cream and topped with nuts and chocolate then froze for 30 mins zummy

Has anyone tried the dip without the vegetable oil? It sounds fabulous except for that part. :-p

This is a great idea for a great looking, yummy dessert. And to "Beautiful from Texas", I just have to say is that recipes are somewhat like boyfriends. The amount of love, attention, care you put into it is often directly proportionate to what you get out of it. Also, the quality of the ingredients matters too, so perhaps you've been shopping in the wrong markets.

I started making sorbets and ice cream for ACF Culinary competitions 10 years ago. We had to have the ice cream done in just a couple hours so I started using dry ice and a cooler with some baking racks inside to complete the dessert in time for plate up. To eliminate the mess, use dry ice to freeze the ice cream balls before you coat them and then return them to the dry ice for a half hour. You may have to dip the ice cream in the chocolate a second time to get the nut coating to stick.

This a great idea to serve to someone you are wanting to impress. Make sure you put the ice cream in the right place and not open the door until you are ready to used them.

My guests really loved this dessert. The chocolate coating made the ice cream taste delicious. It was very easy to make and gave the appearance of being decadent.

Not only were my dinner guests impressed with this dessert, it was fun to make too. I will make it again--varying ice cream flavors and coatings.

These were wonderful. Although you had to freeze them the night before, I didn't find them all that time consuming -- comparable to making a cake or cheesecake. They were a nice change from the ordinary. I used two different ice creams: macadamia nut, and strawberry. Dipped both in dark chocolate. They were lovely.

First of all , all of you pathetic souls, that rate your love life on this recipe, need to get a life. Yes, it's messy, and time consuming, but isn't everything??? It's delicious, and refreshing, and may take more time than another boring dessert, but it's good, and worth the work. So, bon appetit!!! 2004- still rescue-ing animals :o)

Tried this for a big dinner party and they were very good, but they were a lot of work. The ice cream started to melt when I put it in the chocolate and it got pretty messy. Maybe I'll try again with higher quality (more dense)ice cream.

Maybe your so-called cooking skills don't have anything to do with your date being a flop and your love life sucking... Regardless, as stated before, this is a very easy recipe - but speed is crutial! I would also recommend using a finer ice cream like haagen dazs because it doesn't seem to melt as quickly. American ice cream (bryers, blue bell, etc) have lots of air whipped into it, so the ice cream isn't as dense, causing it to melt faster. I would maybe suggest making a simple vanilla anglaise, chill it and put a small amount onto a little plate, then put the ice cream truffles on top. Not necessarily the fanciest of desserts, but I'm sure it would be a good treat on a hot summer's day.

First of all, there is no way to mess this up if you follow the directions... I used ice creams other than what were listed and coordinated the toppings to reflect it (walnut fudge ice cream with dark chocolate 'dip' and chopped walnuts, chocolate brownie overload with white chocolate and walnuts). It was SO easy, it just took a little time and patience.

You know what? Here i was all excited to make what seemed like a great recipe, but it was a total flop. I made it for my new boyfriend(trying to impress him). Let's just say I haven't seen or heard from him in 3 weeks. And now my ex is dating this gorgeous model! I can't beleive it. Why do all these things happen to me!!!? I mean I'm beautiful and skinny, I just really dont understand. Well anyways, this recipe sucks. Tata for now =)
