I have made this two or three times now and everyone loves it. The crust is wonderfully flaky and the curd looks beautiful. Mine did not pull away or crack. As many reviews already suggested, I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and it was perfect. I serve it with unsweetened whipped cream. De-lish!

I have made this tart for years now,each time with great success and wonderful reviews. I am out of town and wanted to make this and was searching for the recipe and discovered that I never reviewed this one. I have made this tart at least 10 times and always as printed. To a person, everyone has loved it. I rarely have leftovers for more than a few hours. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed.

I love this recipe. I make it often when I need an elegant, tasty, refreshing dessert. I usually add an extra two tablespoons of milk to the crust and refrigerate for just 20 minutes or so before rolling. I always cut sugar to a scant 1 cup or heaping 3/4c. Served with whipped cream, this pie is always a hit.

A baked custard is always going to shrink- if you are disturbed by it, regular lemon curd is not that difficult. I'll give this another try with Meyer lemon, no orange.

Forgot to add that I reduced the sugar like everyone suggested, and it was perfect.

Has got to be one of the easiest tarts with the most taste rewards I've ever made. I made two at the same time (since they were easy and I have a lemon and an orange tree). Took one to work where it was gobbled up and tried to take the other one. My boyfriend stopped me and nearly at the whole thing himself, and he doesn't really care for sweet things. Will be using this as my go-to quickie dessert.

I had to add a third fork to my previous review of this recipe. I refrigerated the tart and enjoyed it a little more when its ice cold. It's still overly sweet for me, but not as bad as I originally thought in my first review of this recipe. The filling has a very nice texture and the slight orange flavor along with the lemon flavor is nice. I may go back on what I originally said and try this recipe again with LESS SUGAR. It may be worth trying to tweak it to my taste. It was super easy to make and holds up well in the fridge. I made candied lemon peel cut in fine julien slices and decorated around the perimeter of the tart. The peel added some nice extra flavor, texture, and an elegant look.

Toothacheingly sweet, way too sweet even though I have a great big sweet tooth. I didn't like the texture of the zest in the filling. Kids would like this due to the extreme sweetness. I won't be making this again, it's not for me.

Great recipe. I've cut the sugar down to 1 cup as suggested. Mine did not pull away from the crust. Had it with vanilla ice cream and the next day with cream. Fantastic!

fabulous. i cut the sugar down to 1 c. instead of 1.5 and it was just right: sweet and tangy.

I LOVED this recipe. The one problem I had is that by the next day the curd was pulling away from the crust. Does anyone know how to correct this?

I thought this was very good. IT was like a lemon curd tart. I used slightly less sugar than called for, and it was fine. The crust turned out great.

I'd make this tart again to try the previous suggestion of less sugar. I found it filling-jarringly sweet. But high points for ease of making.

The sweetness overpowered the citrus tang in my opinion. I would reduce the sugar by at least 1/3 next time or serve it with fresh raspberries to cut the sweetness. Also, to cut time, I used a store-bought crust that worked wonderfully. The presentation after dinner was beautiful so I will certainly try this again.

Baking does not come easily to me, which is why this recipe was a joy---it was so easy for me, and sooo delicious. The combination of fresh-squeezed orange and lemon juices-along with the zest-was totally outstanding. The crust was easy to make and delicious. I will be making this all the time.
