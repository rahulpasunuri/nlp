Hi, I read the previous reviews and applied a couple of methods I've used for another slaw recipe- they seemed to address the acidity and "raw flavor" issues: First, I tossed the veggies with 1/2 cup brown sugar- this starts them softening. Then I followed the recipe for the slaw liquid- but then just brought it to a boil and poured it over the veggies and tossed. Refrigerate for an hour and it really is tasty- the flavors are melded and it's got a little sweetness. (I did add a couple of drops of tabasco at the end for a spicy kick, too)

OK, granted, I messed with the recipe a little. I used celery salt instead of celery seeds (I decreased regular salt), and used chardonnay vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. Also used plain old green cabbage and plain paprika. But this turned out very, very acidic, like a relish. Not bad, just not something I enjoy eating! I think adding more sugar may help, but I'll stick with sauteeing collards!

This is my new keeper recipe for coleslaw after seeing B. Smith prepare it with Michael Lomanaco on Epicurious TV. My recommendations? If possible make this dish up to a day ahead to really soften the collards and the cabbage and to allow the flavors of the dressing to meld with the veggies. If you can't find Napa cabbage--as I couldn't the day I went to the store--savoy cabbage made a fine substitute because the leaves have texture to hold the dressing. Regular green cabbage would probably do fine, but the savoy really held the dressing nicely. Also, as I made this for my Christmas party, I wanted some red so I added in radicchio though red cabbage was also an option. At first I didn't care for the dressing so I sweetened it up a bit with brown sugar and honey. (That's just my taste because I don't like my dressings to be too acidic.) All in all a fabulous slaw and a great way to prepare collards besides the traditional saute/steam/boil. Thanks B.!
