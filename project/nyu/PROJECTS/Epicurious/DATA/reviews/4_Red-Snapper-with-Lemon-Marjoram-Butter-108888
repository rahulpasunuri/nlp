I enjoyed this recipi yet I was unable to locate freash red snapper so I used Halibut in its place (first time eating halibut).It was a very light and uniquie taste I will definately try this recipe again.

Enjoyed this recipe, was quick and easy, very flavorful. However we definitely did not need as much marjoram butter as the recipe called for, just used a dab! We made this with roasted garlic fingerling potatoes and green beans with pine nuts.

I am fully satisfied and somewhat in love with myself. Just so you know.

absolutely fantastic... i combined this recipe with "roasted potatoes with garlic, lemon and oregano" and roasted tomatoes from the "spicy roast chicken with tomatoes and marjoram" recipe (just as a previous reviewer had suggested)... the combination proved to delicious, fresh, light, and memorable... i will most certainly make this again...

This was good and sooo easy. It is now apart of my recipe file.

I made this for my wife and I for our anniversary, with some sugar snap peas and red rice, very tasty, and easy. We couldn't get red snapper, so used black halibut instead. I have a feeling the fish wasn't as fresh as it could be (funny that, we live on an island nation, and struggle to get fresh fish!), so that detracted from what was otherwise quite nice. I would try this again, but make sure you use good ingredients as there's not much to make up for it if you don't.

Easy, but looks and tastes restaurant quality. Juice your own lemon.

This is so easy and tasty indeed. Had no fresh marjoram, so used fresh oregano as the recipe suggests. Will do that again. Some baked / broiled / roasted tomatoes would be a great side dish.

Excellent flavour and simple to make. One of the few times we've enjoyed this type of fish.

A great, basic recipe for most types of fish.

QUICK AND EASY RECIPE. I USED HALIBUT INSTEAD OF RED SNAPPER, AND WILL MAKE THIS MANY MORE TIMES.(I MISTAKENLY REVIEWED ANOTHER RECIPE FOR THIS ONE)

Tastes great...easy to make. And I can't cook anything! Cut way back on the butter, though...don't need the fat. Was still great!

I made this last week during a fishing trip to the Florida Keys. The fishing wasn't great, but this recipe certainly was. I made it exactly as called for. The combination of very fresh fish and the lemon marjoram butter was sensational.

Good and easy

This recipe was very easy to follow, quick to make, and popular with everyone, even the baby. We got the fish very fresh, had it filleted for us (keeping the other bits for stock), and cooked it the same day.

Salted vs. Unsalted Butter. When a recipe calls for unsalted butter but also has salt as an ingredient it is because you cannot control the amount of salt in salted butter. By using unsalted butter you can season the dish to your taste. However, if you only have salted butter, no problem, just be very careful before adding any more salt.

I have a question about unsalted butter vs. salted butter. Since this recipe calls for using unsalted but then adds salt, can one use salted butter and omit salt for same result?

Now that I am in Florida, and the snapper is good. I liked this receipe. But there is a difference. When I lived in Ca. I tried many receipes from Fl. and La. and the red snapper is not the same in Ca. Substitue another really good fish. It makes a difference.

I'm not sure if I qualify to rate this because I used only what I had on hand (with two small children and a newborn...you gotta improvise sometimes!). I used king salmon instead of the snapper, and I didn't have a lemon for the zest, so i had to do without. I just used bottled lemon juice (gasp). This recipe was refreshingly simple, delicate and delicious. I usually go all out for family meals and am a "Bon Appetit" addict, but with the kids and holidays, I appreciate simpler prep & quick meals. I love the flavor of fresh marjoram, and next time I make this I will probably add an extra teaspoon, and maybe broil each filet with a sprig and some kosher salt sprinkled atop, unless someone would recommend otherwise (broiling might burn the herb?). I look forward to making this again with listed ingredients. I served this with equally easy asparagus, and orzo with minced shallots, carrots and broccoli, s&p. Thank goodness for healthy, quick and delicious dinners!

I tried this for a dinner party last night over red kale, with acorn squash stuffed with wild rice/cranberries/hazelnuts. I couldn't find fresh marjoram, so I substituted oregano as suggested. It was so easy (it cooked in the time it took to switch wines), fresh tasting, and beautiful on the plate. My guests were thrilled, and the leftovers today - I made tons- made a great sandwich.

Difference between east coast and west coast red snapper? I would like to have this explained. In California, what is called red snapper is a rock fish and doesn't have skin.
