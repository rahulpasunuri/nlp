You are absolutely right about the need for onion and bacon. They are in every authentic recipe. I have been making these wonderful omelets for nearly forty years and love them!

You bet there's something missing! I've never made or eaten in a restaurant a Hangtown Fry that didn't have bacon and onions of some sort. Usually I use green onions - white part & green through out the mixture. As is, this is very bland. With the addition of these other flavors this can be a delicious treat. Dipping in flour & saltines & pre frying lightly is a must but you need to have a light touch or the oysters get too dry. Without the pre frying the oysters put out too much juice & the eggs are mushy. Add the bacon & onions & it should taste much, much better.

Don't know if it's just me but it seemed like this wasn't a great match. Maybe some other stuff in the omelet would have made it better but oysters alone seemed overpowering to me.
