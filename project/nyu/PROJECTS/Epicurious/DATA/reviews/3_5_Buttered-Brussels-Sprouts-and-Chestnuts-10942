My fiance and I had never really had chestnuts before. I found that while they were an interesting contrast to the brussells sprouts, I would probably try with almonds next time. Overall very simple to make and I will make again with different nuts.

I really liked this recipe. I used slivered almonds and added garlic. After the sprouts were steamed I sliced them all in half and placed them faced down in the pan to get them a little brown and crispy. Before making this recipe my husband said he did not like brussels sprouts but he didn't leave a single one on his plate.

This was excellent and unexpected - a keeper for sure.

Delicious! I first sauteed chopped onions & garlic in oil & butter until well browned, then added the Brussels sprouts (the bigger of which I cut in half) and sauteed it all with more oil & butter until they were all well browned. I like them all to be nicely sauteed, so I think they're better all cut in half.

I really liked this. The sprouts needed to be steamed quite a bit more than 7-10 minutes. I used some light cream toward the end and it made a really nice sauce. I'd definitely make this again

This tasted good and I would make it again for a special occasion such as Thanksgiving. Plain Brussels sprouts are just as good, thoughIt's very important to keep the frying of the nuts and sprouts down to 1 single minute, though.

Very good. Instead of chestnuts I used pinenuts. I would probably steam the brussels sprouts for about 10 minutes next time.
