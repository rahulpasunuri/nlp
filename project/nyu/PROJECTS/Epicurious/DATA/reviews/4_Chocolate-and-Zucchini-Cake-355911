Was done gluten free and with half the sugar and it was excellent! I brought it to work and all my colleagues were raving about it!

Great cake! I reduced the sugar a bit with no noticeable change in taste. I even made it with gluten free flour and it was great. Walnuts were omitted once b/c my kids won't eat them. It did require more baking time than suggested, about 10 minutes.

I made this cake after reading the reviews and I'm glad I did. I added Greek yogurt to 3 of the cakes and 3 over ripe banana's to a fourth. I subbed peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips in the one I added banana's to. I also divided one and baked it in two loaf pans as another reviewer advised. I would definitely make it again.

So good! Doubled the recipe so I could take one to a grieving friend and have one for my family. Used whole wheat pastry flour and added 1/2 cup plain greek yogurt. Baked in bundt pans. I am pretty sure I will be making it again today to serve friends who are stopping by.

I would absolutely make this again. I needed something healthier for my kid to bring to school than donuts or cupcakes. This snuck in some veggies and the kids did not notice. I will try it again and use whole wheat flour and applesauce to make it a little more healthy. I did add some greek yogurt to the batch as it was rather dry and it gave it a nice flavor.

This is truly an exceptional cake--moist, chocolatey and not too sweet. I didn't have instant coffee so used a heaping teaspoon of finely ground espresso instead and it just bumped up the chocolate flavor perfectly. Am making again (I have a lot of zuke in the garden) but will bake in 2 loaf pans and freeze one.

Satisflyingly chocolate. I increased instant coffee to 1.5 tsp. Also found it FREEZES WELL IN SLICES (2 slices per plastic sandwich size ziploc bag.) It's fudgier when thawed.

I replaced the oil/butter with Greek yogurt instead, to make it slightly healthier. I also used milk chocolate rather than bittersweet chocolate which I'm glad I did because the cake doesn't quite have the chocolate intensity I was expecting. Still a great use of zucchini and a tasty treat.

I made this recipe twice in three days. The first time I used the oil, and it gave the cake a "packet mix" taste. Though it was consumed quickly by my workmates and family. The second time I used the butter and found that it was much nicer. I used yellow zucchini, and would be quite interested to see the difference if I used green.

this was amazingly good.. I had fresh zucchini from the garden and didn't know what to do with it. This is a great solution. Don't stint on the salt

Just Okay! I really wanted to love this cake especially since it's laden with chocoalte, but it didn't live up to my expectations. It was dry and not quite sweet enough to be an all time favorite. I'm willing to give the recipe one more shot but with a little tinkering. Next time I will make it with a mix of cake flour and all purpose flour, add some butter for creaminess and add some sour cream for moistness. Hopefully, that will produce a cake that will be a little more than mediocre.

This is excellent--very moist and chocolatey. I just put a little powdered sugar on top and it was perfect.

Because I am diabetic but also a chocolate lover and have an abundance of zucchini I thought I would try to make this a bit "friendlier" so I made just a few substitutions which make it less of a guilt trip to eat. I used 1/2 C unsweetened applesauce instead of butter or oil, 1 C whole wheat flour and 1 C all-purpose; 1/4 C brown sugar and 1/4 C Splenda sugar blend* instead of 1 C packed brown sugar; 1/2 C chocolate chips. I baked it in a bundt pan for about 40-45 minutes and put a chocolate glaze on when cool. It was really delicious. Even my husband who is not diabetic thought it was moist, chocolaty and sweet enough! (*make sure to use the right kind of Splenda sugar blend for baking.) Enjoy ...

A sweet variation on zucchini, perfect for when the garden supplies more than you're expecting! This cake was a treat... I used my favorite bittersweet chocolate bar, cut up into small chunks as the chocolate chips and I made the cake with butter and baked it as a bundt cake - gorgeous!

I made this cake and used a bit less sugar. I made the lemon cream cheese frosting (with only 1/3 cup of icing sugar) to go with it and then I drenched the bottom lawyer and the very top with a partridgeberry chocolate sauce (just partridgeberries and semi-sweet chocolate. It was very rich and quite delicious. I am making it again right now!

Yummy. Next time will bake only 35 min. Baked for 40 and could use less time. I used canola oil rather than butter. Very chocolatey...everyone loved it.
