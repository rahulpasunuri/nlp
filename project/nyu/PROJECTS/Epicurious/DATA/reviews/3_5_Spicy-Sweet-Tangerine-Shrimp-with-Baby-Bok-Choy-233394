Tasty weeknight dinner! I did not have three of the ingredients, so I made substitutions. Instead of tangerine concentrate, I used OJ concentrate. Instead of Asian sweet chili sauce, I used Hunts chili sauce, Asian hot chili sauce, and honey. Then instead of oyster sauce, I used half fish sauce and half soy sauce. Like others suggested, I steamed the baby bok choy.

Used regular bok choy instead baby bok choy. Did not make sauce -- 1/2" of water does not cook down in 1 minute! Omitted tangerine peel. Used regular OJ instead of frozen orange-tangerine concentrate & garlic-chili sauce instead of sweet chili sauce. Cut down chili sauce from 1/3 cup to a tablespoon + a bit, but was still too spicy. Doubled the amount of green onions. Cut shrimp into bite sized pieces prior to cooking, served over rice with peanuts on top. Quite good. Liked taste of bok choy, though it was a bit mushy.

Yummy!! I used plain orange juice and forgot the tangerine peel, also couldn't find oyster sauce, but the taste was wonderful anyway. I agree that the bok choy "glaze" was a waste of time, and in the future will probably prepare greens in a separate pan at the same time as the shrimp so that they are both warm for serving. I think it would be great with half scallops, chicken, or tofu. Kids loved it =)

Very easy, very good, served with udon noodles. I did hold back on the siriacha to hold down the heat.

This turned out really good! I took advice from another review and substituted white distilled vinegar for rice vinegar, and oyster sauce for low sodium soy. I didn't have any tangerines so I used a blood orange for the peel which gave the sauce a really nice flavor. Also, I am not the biggest fan of spicy food so I didn't add the sweet chili sauce. This was surprisingly simple and iI will make it again often.

EAST & FAST. Somehow I forgot the sesame oil and used olive oil instead...cooking while distracted...but it stil came out great! (Maybe a litle too sweet...I can see how another reviwer said it was mass-market tasting...but it still TASTES good!)

I didn't have oj but I did have some tangerine marmalade that I used instead. Which I thought worked fine. My bok choy was way to wet and soggy. Maybe I cooked it too long?

delicious, healthy, not hard to make, did I say delicious?

Too sweet, not enough spice. Tasted artificial (and I used good ingredients), like something from Panda Express.

My son loved this recipe so much that he requested I prepare it the next day! I am glad I purchased double the amount of shrimp!

My husband found this recipe while browsing old magazines, and wanted to try it (it is not a recipe that I would have picked out). We made it just as the recipe instructed (which is quite unusual for me). It was easy and super delicious! I cut some wonton wrappers into strips and fried them in oil for a cruchy side. Will most certainly make this again.

I have made this twice in the last few weeks. Orange-tangerine juice concentrate is not available in the grocery stores here. The first time I squeezed tangerines and reduced the juice mixed with orange juice concentrate and that worked well. More recently I can't get tangerines either so just used OJ concentrate and orange peel. The dish was spicey with 1/3 c of chili sauce so I used half as much the second time and the other flavors came through much better. I like spicey food, but this recipe was better with only 1/6 cup of chili sauce. I also braised the bok choy in just a little water the second time for just 5 min. and then drizzled with sesame oil and it was perfect. This is a quick, easy recipe that is good enough for guests and looks lovely on the plate with jasmine rice.

I know: rate the recipe, not what you did to it, but this is the recipe I wanted to make and I had few of the ingredients. With my best layed plans, I made an amazing dish: reduced OJ for concentrate-soy for oyster sauce-rice vinegar for white wine-ground ginger for fresh-salmon for shrimp. OK, I had the bok choy and the chili sauce and made it exactly. I think my subs were fair and have to imagine that the intended dish is just as great. Easy and amazing.

Loved the sauce and the shrimp. Served it with rice and couldn't get enough of the rice with extra sauce, Yum! The bok Choy was watery from having been cooked in water. Next time will steam the bok choy and drizzle with sesame oil. Agree with other reviewer that bok choy "sauce" was a waste and took too long.

Just made the shrimp and served them cold as Super Bowl finger food -- worked perfectly, yum!

I was so optimistic about this disk since I love shrimp and I love tangerine. The "sauce" for the bok choy is a waste of time. It took forever for it to cook down, by which time the bok choy was very cold. As far as the shrimp goes, the flavors didn't have sufficient time to develop. A bit disappointed.

I am a novice cook with a gourmet girlfriend. I fixed this shrimp dish last night and we both loved it. The bok choy had a great smoky flavor and the shrimp had just the right combination of sweetness and spice. Plus the colors looked great on the plate. It was very easy to make and I will definitely cook this again.

This dish was absolutely delicious and SO easy to make. I liked the spiciness but my family thought it too hot. Next time I may cut the chili sauce. Also, I used fresh tangerine juice instead of the concentrate and zested the rind. It had just enough sweetness. I would definitely make this again.
