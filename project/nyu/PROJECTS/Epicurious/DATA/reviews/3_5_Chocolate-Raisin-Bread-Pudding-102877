YUM! This is my favorite bread pudding - and that is saying alot since I ALWAYS order it if offered. I serve this with creme anglaise, but it is fine with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. I think the chocolate sauce mentioned is a bit too much.

Last year Thanksgiving was a hit. Everyone was full and yet they ate more when this was served. Easy and fun. Substituted craisins for raisins and topped it with an Irish Creme sauce that actually improved the next day. Can't miss desert. Might want to leave the bread out all day or overnight. Works better with slightly stale bread. The butter rum coffee from Kona Coffee and Tea was an added bonus.

Hmmm...this recipe did not expunge my dislike of bread pudding. Added cinnamon & sugar topping which enhanced depth of flavor. Raisins and chocolate chips were little tasty surprises througought, would add more if there was a next time. Frangelico, Baileys or Rum would be a nice addition to this recipe.

Easy, tasty and the house smelled wonderful. Took the raisins and used cherry flavored craisins and it was delicious. Glad this recipe is still on the books. A must for family dinners from now on!

Whenever I have leftovers of my home-made walnut bread (no raisins), I whip up this dish - everyone loves it so far - in fact, I usually double the recipe and freeze a loaf for later use! I use more chocolate than is called for and I also use semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the chocolate called for. Serve warm, with cold cream poured on top and cocoa sifted over the cream.

I really liked this one, yummy and easy to make for a casual dinner. I served it just with vanilla ice cream and everybody loved it.

Most excellent! Moist, firm and oh-so chocolatey. I don't understand why but the golden raisins really work. I serve this with whipped cream flavored with a dash of kahlua- gets rave reviews.

So I made this to please chocolate lovers and bread pudding eaters and just managed to have a dessert that left them all cold. It just isn't interesting - too much bread, not very complex flavors. All the reviews were so good but I was quite disappointed. It needs major help - perhaps raisins soaked in alcohol or less bread or some spices. I will admit it was popular with the 3 year old crowd but probably because it was sweet bland mush.

So far three people have called this the best dessert they've ever had! It's really that good, and quite easy. I halved the recipe and made it in an 8 x 8 x 2 inch dish, I have also made it in individual ramekins (and cut the cooking time to about 25 minutes). Both came out great. And being a chocolate purist, I omitted the raisins.

The answer for people who love both chocolate and bread pudding! This was very easy to make, and it turned out well. I didn't get a custard on top after baking it, but it was very tasty. A little whipped cream on top made it perfect!

Since 01.23.00 this recipe still comes up as Corn mashed potatoes. Why don't you fix it - I still want Corn mashed potatoes!!!!!!!!!!

The report on 01 23 00, was right; the recipe does file as 'corn mashed potatoes'. Ha!, It really should be fixed. It looks great though, so I will try it. Is it as good as Caesars?

Very tasty & loads of chocolate - yum yum. Although - I did follow the recipe and directions to the tee - when I baked it, it did not come out with a custard on top. We all loved it nonetheless.

I'm sure this will be marvelous, although when I transferred the recipe to my recipe file, it comes up as Corn Mashed Potatoes. You might want to correct same. Thank you.

This is REALLY, REALLY good and so easy. You do not need the chocolate sauce or whipped cream, it is good as is or with a little table cream poured over. Will definately make again.
