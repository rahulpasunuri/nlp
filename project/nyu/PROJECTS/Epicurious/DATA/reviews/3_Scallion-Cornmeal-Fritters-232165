So easy! Following the suggestion of other reviewers, I used more scallion than called for. Also, I substituted rice milk and it was delicious; I don't think anyone would ever know I made the substitution. I also put a pinch or two of sugar in to give it a bit more hush-puppy-style flavor. Next time, I might experiment with other veggies and even spices, say cumin and garlic for example.

This recipe is so easy! I used regular onions too and I added 1/2 a clove of garlic and my father LOVED them!

Easy and delicious. I've made the recipe once as given and once I substituted the scallions with chopped onion. I preferred the onion, actually.

We thought this was fabulous, but the recipe as is I would probably have given 3 forks. When I read the negative review below I decided to increase the amount of scallion to half a cup. My husband loved them so much he demanded to take ALL the leftovers to work for his lunch tomorrow. I also thought these would be even better, if that is possible with some cheese in them, especially either mozzarella or goat cheese.

Very bland and not-so-interesting although I agree it was a snap to make.

Easy, easy, and delicious reheated in the oven the next day. Great accompaniment.
