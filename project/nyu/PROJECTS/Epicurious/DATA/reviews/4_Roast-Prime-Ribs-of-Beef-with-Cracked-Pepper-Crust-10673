While I use a different recipe for preparing a rib roast, his has been my "go to" recipe for the sauce for the past 25 years. The sauce is first-rate, and I usually use some of the wine I'm serving with the roast to tie the flavors together.

Great easy recipe. The flavor of the prime rib is wonderful and the sauce is delicious. This will definitely be a keeper.

Excellent and easy recipe for Christmas dinner! My family loved it and made me promise to make it every year. The sauce is lovely but to give it an extra kick I used French Dijon mustard with horseradish. We also made Yorkshire Pudding as an accompaniment. Delicious!

I started making this recipe for Christmas dinner when it was first published. My family looks forward to it every year and says it is the best prime rib anywhere!

We don't eat beef too often so when we do we want it to be worth it. This beef recipe is worth it.

This recipe was great! I did add powdered white pepper & a teaspoon & a half of liquid smoke to a 17lb roast

the recipe has become a family tradition. I don't do the shallots around it, but the roasting process and sauce are easy and outstanding. It taught be the French Roast process.

Since this my first time making a prime rib roast I realized it is very simple to make, just the basics salt and cracked pepper. The wine sauce was too much! Didn't really need it, best to make and serve immediately, make to serve....will try other recipes.

Not sure what all the fuss is about this recipe. I do a lot of cooking and particularly with red meat, there are much better recipes than this. It was not bad, but I will look for another.

I fondly remember making this 15 years ago when it first appeared in Gourmet. It's become an annual event not to be missed!

This recipe was absolutely fabulous! We followed the recipe to the letter except we BBQ'd the Prime Rib. We have a 55 gallon drum BBQ. Briquets were used on one side only and the roast sat in a roasting pan on the other side. we replaced the briquets only once. The pan drippings were fantastic in the sauce!! This was a big hit that we will make a tradition!

I'm not really much of a beef lover, but, I have to say this was the most delicious roast beef that I have had. I made this last night for our Christmas dinner and I thought the kids were going to lick their plates! It was definitely the sauce that really made the dish outstanding. Everyone went back for seconds and then thirds! I had originally planned on making the usual ham for Christmas dinner but ended up with a prime rib of beef because I didn't like what I was finding at the store as far as cuts of ham went. Now, I'm so glad that I made the prime rib. I will definitely make this again and I know that my children will probably "demand" it next Christmas! Sipry

Great recipe. Be sure you have a good cut of beef. Don't forget the great sauce (red wine sauce).

I have made this recipe for years. I'm glad to have found it in epicurious since my copy of the recipe (from 1985 Gourmet) has seen better days. I make this usually once a year, and it has become a tradition in our family. Wonderful crust, spicy and delicious. The sauce compliments it well.

Recommend removing from oven when interior temperature reaches 123 degrees and waiting the full 30 minutes before carving. Pepper crust is lovely as is the sauce
