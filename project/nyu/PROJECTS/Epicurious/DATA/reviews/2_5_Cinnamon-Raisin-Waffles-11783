We make this recipe almost every weekend with sweet rice flour (since I don't eat wheat) and it comes out great! We also an extra half cup of liquid and coconut flakes and some almond extract. It's been a real guest pleaser.

Big time mistake on this recipe! The liquid is missing and makes such a huge difference. The melter butter & 1 egg is for sure not enough liquid. So I added 1/3-1/4 cup of skim milk(must be room temperature) and the problem was solved. Perhaps also to add a bit of more flavour, you can add a bit of good quality vanilla extract. Overall good results for from my family.

Recipe repair! The liquid was clearly left out of the recipe. Here's a fix: stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, ¼ tsp. baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and raisins. Whisk together 1 cup buttermilk, the egg, and melted butter. Stir together until they just form a batter, and bake. Mixing the cinnamon and raisins with the dry ingredients will get you better distribution of both (the flour-coated raisins won't stick together). Use any small or diced dried fruit. Add up to 2 more tablespoons butter if you want your waffles to really crisp up in the waffle iron.

Find a different waffle recipe and add the raisins and cinnamon to it. Problem solved.

This is the heaviest waffle batter I've ever made and, as a result, the waffles were too dense. Like other reviewers have noted, it seems to be missing milk or buttermilk.

Didn't try this yet, but the absence of liquid has to be an error. I'll try milk to give it the right consistency.

It seemed that something important was missing..like some kind of liquid! I added buttermilk until it looked to be the right consistancy for waffles, and THEN they were very good, as is, this is an awful recipe.

I thought these waffles were heavy, dense, and fairly dry. I wouldn't make them again.

Bake until quite hard as it will taste like a raisin cinnimon cookie. Super waffle !
