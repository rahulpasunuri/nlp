Rich dark-chocolately, tender cookies. We've made them again & again. The directions complicate the simple process of cutting out a 2 circles of dough, making the 2nd circle into a donut or wreath shape. Stack the wreath on the circle & fill the hole with chopped candy- canes.Small candy- canes are definately easier to chop.Take care when tasting hot melted candy. I first made these with a group of little girls for a cookie party. It was a hit once we understood the process. I've made them in heart shapes for Valentines day and Birthdays.

I found the directions complicated the first time I baked these yummy dark chocoltely and tender cookies. Read the instructions carefully before starting. The cook is simply describing the process to sandwich a ring of dough over a circle of dough to make a wreath. Centers are cut out of the ring to form a hole for the candy- cane pieces. Small candy-canes are much easier to chop. Be careful to cool before tasting...melted candy canes are painfully hot! We have also made these using 2 sizes of heart shaped cookie cutters for Valentines day and birthdays.

This is a great recipe that my kids love. I've been making them since they came out in the magazine and they have become a family tradition!I would recommend adding more chopped candy canes, as they do shrink while cooking. Also, avoid overcooking as it really ruins the cookie. They are very easy to make, just a bit time consuming, but make an attractive gift!

The recipe made a TON of cookies but was a TON of work and not really that impressive. More work than its worth and definitely wouldnt pack well.

These were rich chocolate cookies. I loved them. My husband wasn't that keen on them. Too chocolatey for him. Despite how long the directions are, they're very easy to make. The hardest part of this entire recipe was chopping those candy canes. I couldn't find the small thin candy canes, so I had to use the regular sized ones.

Loved these cookies....they are easier to make if you chill the dough for about an hour before rolling it out. I have also changed the filling to chopped toffee bars.

This was an eyecatcher in the magazine when I first received it in 1997. My children loved making them, and eating them. They are ten and under. It is very manageable to do with them. They are done in stages, which helps to fit them into the busy holiday season. I have not thought of ways to re-interpert them for other seasons of the year. bon apetit!!

This recipe was a lot of work for a little reward.Its hard to watch the candy canes to take them out of the oven at just the right time. I wound up with a pink mess. And then the candy canes harden back up so warn people about their teeth.
