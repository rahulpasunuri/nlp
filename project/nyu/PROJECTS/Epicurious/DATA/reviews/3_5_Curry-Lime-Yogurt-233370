Delicious, and so easy! I made this using "Greek Gods" 2% Greek yogurt, which is a traditional very thick Greek-style yogurt, and served it on top of Curried Sweet Potato Latkes (recipe on Epicurious). This was so easy and quick to make, and had such a great flavor, I'm brainstorming other things we could just toss it onto all the time. Yogurt is healthier than sour cream, too, so this would make a good sub for some things you might normally use that for (like the latkes).

This worked really well with fat-free yogurt, so don't be afraid to give it a shot! It was delicious, and handy for people who are diabetic AND on a low-fat diet.

This recipe is always a hit at my house and also at parties. Beware though, make them small, because people eat these up! It's a simple recipe and very easy to make. I recommend that you use curry powder and lots more spices. They're delicious!

Make it the day before to really let the flavors develop. Don't be afraid to add the lime juice. Great with the Indian pancakes. I'm imagining it on grilled chicken, lamb chops, fish, veggies...

Really great, easy to make, totally worked with low fat, could go with so many things - beans, lentils, pita sandwiches, fresh veggies. Used a little more lime and curry than it called for.
