This recipe may be a bit overrated. Something about it just doesn't cohere. The salsa is lovely, and every bite you can get with a peach certainly helps. But again, something about the recipe just doesn't rise to the typical gourmet "ah" found on this site. I prefer the adobo-rubbed giant pork chop elsewhere on Epicurious.

The salsa alone is deserving of 4 forks. I used bone-in country style ribs instead of thick chops(much less expensive per lb. and just as tasty). I might cut back slightly on the amount of cumin seeds next time- I expected much of it to fall off during grilling, but it stuck quite nicely. As the recipe stated the pork is just as good cold the next day, so will make at least 1 1/2 of salsa next time. Just make sure not to overcook the chops/ribs!!!

I followed the recipe as written - a little spicy for my taste but my husband loved it as is. I'll definitely make it again, but scale back a tad on the cumin as well as the chipotles. But great flavor - a keeper.

Made the rub and the salsa exactly as written, with canned peaches because fresh ones aren't in ready supply during a Chicago winter! So easy, huge return on time invested for the flavor you get. Husband and son loved it so much we made it the next week, this time with steaks, minus the salsa, and the butternut squash/leek risotto recipe also on Epi. The cumin and the squash are a great combination.

This recipe was incredible! A huge hit at our recent BBQ. Great for company. The adobe chilies were definitely on the hot side & would need to be adjusted for milder palates, but the salsa is very flavorful and pairs well with the cumin rub.

Exceptional recipe. Instead of cooking on the grill, I did the chops inside. Started with a stove top saute and finished them in the oven. Spectacular; both the pork and the salsa. go for it!!

This recipe is amazing and we already have more plans for the peach salsa (chicken, tilapia, pureed into a sauce). I followed the recipe exactly, except for the cumin seeds (I didn't have any and used half as many caraway seeds instead). The was a lot of heat from the peppers, but it balanced so nice with the sweet peaches and fresh cilantro. Delicious!

Excellent - the salsa complemented the chops well. I omitted the cilantro (hubby doesn't like). The combo of the cumin flavored chop w/ the smokiness & sweetness of the salsa was superb. Definitely a keeper.

I go rave reviews from my DP on this meal. I made some significant variations from the recipe, including using fresh sweet cherries rather than peaches. The salsa was still fantastic. Added some fresh thyme, used lemon juice instead of lime, used jalepeno in place of chipotle peppers, and skipped the cilantro altogether because we didn't have any. Still a great combination of flavors. The cumin on the pork chops really works well with the salsa. Can't wait to make this again!

Wow! This was an amazing dish. My wife, who isn't much of a pork lover, absolutely loved it as well. I would have to say the best part is the salsa mix though, it just adds so much to the chop. I added a little more chipotle, only because we enjoy spicy foods, and I don't think it caused any disruption to the salsa what so ever. I made rice and pinto beans as the side and everything went together so well. I will definitely be making this meal again and again!

The salsa was fragrant but we found that the chipotle chilies overpowered the sweetness of the peaches and other ingredients. We enjoy some heat and typically don't scale back on suggested quantity. It was disappointing.

The cumin coated pork goes extremely well with the citrusy peach salsa. :D

This recipe is so good and very easy. I didn't have peaches, so I used nectarines and a half a mango instead. I only used 1 tablespoon of chipotle chiles because I didn't want it to be too spicy. We served it to guests and everyone loved it. Will definitely make it again.

Great weeknight meal - tasty, quick, and easy. I gave it 4 forks because the work to flavor ratio - very little work, very good flavor. Good enough for casual entertaining with additional side dishes and a bottle of wine.

The pork was delicious; the salsa less so.

Excellent! I made as written and it was very good. I may cook the pork less next time but it had a great flavor!

We've made this twice in the past week - with delicious peaches at this time of year it's the best pork chop I've ever had, and so simple for a delicious weeknight meal.

YUUUUUMMMMM!! Really tasty and the salsa was superb (and easy!!).

This was a phenomenal dish. The chops were mouth watering and the salsa was a perfect pairing. I used mangos instead of peaches and they worked great. The combination of the sweetness of the mango and the heat of the chipotles had my wife raving.

Quite easy and quick. As noted by other reviewers, fresh peaches are hard to come by in Boston in April, so I am mortified to admit that I used peaches in light syrup that were rinsed. Athough not ideal, it was actually surprisingly good. I also cut back by 1/2 on the chipotle as I found it to be a overwhelming to the peach flavor.

Easy and delicious! I too pan seared and roasted with excellent results.

Winter Options- Peaches can be hard to find in the winter and nectarines or mangos work great, also added 1 tablespoon sugar to the salsa which helped accent the fruit flavors. I've also prepared the the pork chops by pan searing both sides then roasting on a rack at 350 till they reach temp. Very juicy and flavorful. No left overs grilled or roasted!

This recipe is fantastic , the combination of flavors are sublime.I made extra salsa , pureed some and used as a marinade for chicken with the remainder of the "whole salsa"on the side. Best when peaches are in season and full of flavor. I can hardly wait for next peach season.

Outrageous flavors! Fresh peaches right off our tree - my husband slightly overcooked the chops (be careful), but they were still fabulous with the salsa. Washington Hills "Rainier White" wine was the perfect compliment! One of those perfect pairings. I'm making this again for company - soon!

Just a salsa review here. The salsa was easy to make and very good, however, I used half the amount of chipoltle peppers and even that was spicy. Would be great with mango too!

I grilled the peaches during the last few minutes of the pork chops cooking and just cut them up and served in slices with the pork chops. Very delish!

This was unbelievably delicious. I made it exactly, and the cumin, pork, and peach salsa flavors were a perfect and exciting combination of flavors. It was also very beatiful on the plate when garnished with extra sprigs of cilantro. Whatever you do, don't change anything about this recipe, it was absolute perfection and I plan to make it again and again. (The cold leftovers were also very delicous.)

Don't substitute ground cumin for cracked cumin seeds. And I'd suggest using at least 3T chipotle peppers in the salsa.
