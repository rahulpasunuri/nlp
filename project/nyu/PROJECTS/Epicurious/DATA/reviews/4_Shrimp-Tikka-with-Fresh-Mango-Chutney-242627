This is one of my favorite shrimp dishes! I made exactly as it says and am happy with it.

Great recipe! You should have a bit more mango than cucumber. And tone down the spice a bit -- I probably added too much jalapeno.

This is absolutely delicious! Add extra of the flavors you like or less of those you don't. Perfect the way it is. I bet chicken would be terrific substitute for shrimp. The chutney - I'm allergic to mango but substituted papaya - a great replacement - watermelon I also envision as well. Yum! I am a foodie too!

Awesome. Followed recipe completely. The fresh mango chutney is superb.

So yummy and intense! I didn't puree the sauce and once the shrimp were almost cooked I threw in some cooked quinoa to soak up all the extra sauce. Really yummy and light.

This did take a bit longer to prep than expected but was delicious... wished I'd bought more shrimp. The chutney is very tasty too and added another dimension but seemed like it was missing something as there was no liquid to it. Will make again and again!

This was really good and all the guests liked both the chutney and shrimp. We sauteed it on the stovetop rather than the grill and it was fine.

Outstanding. Anyone who claims otherwise has no taste buds.

Delish!! Marinade is very effective, don't marinate the shrimp longer than 30 minutes or it changes the texture of the shrimp. Used more spices after reading other reviews, worked out well. Will serve it chilled next time as a nice summer dish.

I often cook Indian food and I'm usually successful. But this recipe was bland and boring. After all the effort, it was like eating plain shrimp. I wish I hadn't ruined my wild caught Gulf shrimp with this recipe!

Wonderful marinade. Made it for a half-pound of shrimp and a half- pound chicken cutlet. We alternated the shrimp and chicken on our skewers. I was not terribly enthused with the chutney, though, which I'd describe more like a side salad. Made with basmati rice and dark chocolate-pistachio crisps, both from this site and both excellent.

very good! the marinade doesnt look like it's enough but worked fine w/ 2 lb shrimp. we could not find garam masala in our large store but i found plenty of recipes online for this mixture. we served on brown rice w/ a caesar salad. i see comments from other viewers regarding kick/spice factor--i found the instructions ("1 inch") not too helpful to me and just adjusted to taste before putting on shrimp and that worked well.

I thought the marinade could have been a bit spicier/complex but was rather on the bland side. The chutney was more popular than the shrimp. If I made this again, I would probably double all the spices in the marinade and make less chutney cause the proportions were off.

Great flavor but needs more heat. Added 1/4 tsp of red pepper and it was much better. The mango chutney was incredibly easy and delicious.

I am not a big shrimp eater. I made the mango chutney for Thai lettuce wraps. It was an amazing compliment.

Made this last night and everyone really liked it. Chutney was nice and hot and fresh. Served it with sushi rice. Great quick dinner.

I love this recipe! Easy to prepare and super delicious.

This was great for a weeknight when I happened to have a mango. However, did not have fresh jalapeno and used dried from Penzey's which is a good substitute when needed. Marinated only 15 mins. and wouldn't change that. Also I quickly cooked cooked the shrimp on the stove due to a monsoon outside with the grill. Yum. Will definitely make again.

Made this tonight for my wife, we both loved it. Did have to make some subs due to missing ingredients. No tumeric or nutmeg. Used cumin in the shrimp marinade and some chili powder for more kick. Also, just combined the marinade ingredients but did not blend. Still turned out absolutely delicious. I skewered the shrimp with zuchini in between and the combination worked great (with the salsa as written and some white rice).

Excellent! I steamed the shrimp as I do not have a grill but it worked very well. I will definitely make the shrimp and the chutney again.

I only made the shrimp. It was good but not really what my boyfriend was expecting. In my opinion, I prefer my shrimp plain. We eat Indian food once a week so we were a little disappointed.

Goes great with eggs. I ended up having this recipe a variety of ways, and I found that I liked it best as a breakfast burrito.

Very good. This recipe went together quickly and was very fresh tasting with a nice kick. Served with basmati rice.

I made this with chicken for a crowd instead of shrimp and it was absolutely fantastic! I'd love to use shrimp next time to compare.

Excellant! The chutney worked well with the shrimp and the basmati rice. My wife loved it too and went back for seconds.

Made this for company..it's excellent. Be sure to make the chutney. Served with plain basmati rice.

Oh man. It appears that I bought the last truly hot jalapeno pepper available in the United States, and so my shrimp were almost unbearably hot. This will probably not happen to you, and so you should make this recipe exactly as it is written. IT IS SO DELICIOUS. SO delicious. And so incredibly easy! This recipe will take you about twenty minutes to make and everyone will love you. The BuzzBox has spoken, and spoken truly; this is one of the best Epicurious recipes I've made, even though my lips are still faintly numb. Oh yeah, the mango chutney is delicious too.

Hands down - one of the best Grilled Shrimp Recipes I've ever prepared - My family inhaled them! I doubled the marinade to use again with chicken later in the week. Mango Chutney was perfect with it, and a little Basmati Rice. We are planning to make this then next time we entertain, smells fabulous on the grill!!!

Rating: 3
Chutney was well matched with this. I think it was the perfect compliment for the shrimp. One caution: the mango I used was a bit too soft, would make sure to use a firmer one next time so it holds up in the chutney better and take on the mushy texture mine had.

We loved this, especially with the chutney. I did not think there was enough marinade, but it worked out fine and was a good balance of spice. Very easy recipe suitable for company.

This is one of the best recipes I've found on this site. The flavors are incredible. To make it more of a meal, I quickly boiled the marinade and poured it and the shrimp over rice. Fantastic!

The shrimp takes on a wonderful flavor from the marinade. We all loved this recipe and will make it many times.

I made this for Father's Day and got rave reviews from the Dads in my family. The chutney gives the grilled shrimp a refreshing kick. Will make this again and again.

An excellent recipe. The chutney compliments the great taste of the shrimp. Easy to make.

This was delicious, easy to make, and as my husband said "a keeper"! Kids liked it too!

Great recipe! I will make this again and again. To balance the heat, I omitted the jalapeno from the chutney but used 1 whole (deseeded) jalapeno and 1/2 deseeded Habanero in the marinade. It was delightfully spicy and the chutney was cooling.

definitely would make this again. i actually made it with chicken bc my husband does not like seafood - it worked out very well. I used 2 chicken boneless breasts and left the rest of the ingredients the same. I made the marinade and chutney mid-morning so when I was ready to make dinner it was very simple. I also made it on my indoor cuisineart griddler / panini maker and it worked great. chicken was tender and flavorful. chutney was a bit hot for my taste (i used a full jalepeno) - next time i would use 1/2 of one for a kick. my husband loved the dish too

One must double the amount of the marinade--not its strength-- to have sufficient impact on the shrimp. And I marinated it much longer to wonderful effect. This is the best recipe I've used in 9 months! James

Really liked the flavours. I gave it three forks because I wanted it a bit spicier. I think next time I will throw some curry powder and curry leaves to turn up the spice. I doubled the recipe and that was just enough.

Great recipe - I marinated 30 mins as instructed and the flavors were great! I doubled the jalapeno on the chutney and grilled on high heat for 2 minutes each side for a slightly charred effect

I really enjoyed the flavor of the marinade, would work well with chicken or salmon. I forgot the cucumber in the chutney and didn't have any jalapenos so I used bird chilis instead but it came out tasting fresh and spicy.

Great recipe, good as it gets.

Outstanding and simple. I doubled the marinade because I also wanted to use it on some chicken. The double recipe was perfect for the 2 lb of shrimp. So I made more for the boneless chicken thighs. Superb flavors. If you opt for this on chicken, you probably want to salt the chicken on the grill.
