this salad was super amazing! i used garam masala instead of chaat.I agree that you should be careful about over-salting at the end. this was the best part of the indian-inspired dinner i made tonight! it would make a really impressive thing to take to a dinner party.

This salad has been a big hit at several gatherings. I made this salad for a date...a man who was born and raised in India. He walked in and said immediately that it smelled like his mother's kitchen. We devoured every morsel. After dinner, he asked me to email the recipe to him.

Awesome and simple. Careful not too overcook okra, it's great and crispy at a little less than golden brown. Also it's easier to cut the okra into 1/3 inch rounds and the size complements the rough chop of the onion and tomato. Can fry in much less oil too. Made my out chaat masala with garam masala and amchoor and asefidita. YUM...served all on a small bed of greens.

awesome salad,first time eating okra and loved it. I would suggest a little less lemon and salt at the end to taste. The chaat masala is very salty and you can easily over salt. I drizzled a little olive oil.really good!!

This is superb. I made this last year for a get-together, and now everyone insists that I bring it for all covered-dish functions (I love sneaking ethnic foods in on my friends). I make it just like the recipe--flouring the okra is unnecessary.

A very original way of eating okra. I recommend this recipe!!

Simply amazing- you don't have to like okra to love this dish. Very bright Indian flavors without the heaviness that I usually associate with Indian cuisine. I julienned the okra, and per another reviewer's suggestion, I lightly coated it with flour before frying it in vegetable oil. I made my own chaat masala from here- http://www.recipezaar.com/111581

I found this recipe this evening and just had to try it! I LOVE OKRA and had some left over from the garden that I had froze. In my rush, I forgot which seasonings the recipe called for so I ended up winging it and came up with a fabulous and light version of this salad. I still had some sweet onions so I chopped one up, added the chopped tomato, then a little salt, pepper, lime juice and a dash of China Blue's ginger sauce. I've never fried okra without using some sort of breading so I lightly coated my slices of okra with a little seasoned flour to ensure it would be crispy and placed the fried slices on top of the tomato and onion mixture. WOW! My fiance and I devoured the salad! Next time I will follow the recipe so I can find out what we missed but I will keep my version on hand to use again!

The crispy okra is mighty good, but the lemon juice and shat masala is just too tart.

I am addicted to this salad...if one can be addicted to okra salad. It's so easy, fresh, and delicious.

This was superb...I hate ocra, but was having the lamb (also very yummy) and wanted to give the ocra a try. It was a lovely combination! I made my own Garam Masala....none of our stores had it.

Being from Trinidad and being 4th generation from Indian decent,I enjoy Indian dishes. When I saw this recipe I had to try it, if you love okra like I do, you will enjoy this.
