This is a great base for a wonderful winter soup but the seasonings need a big help. I added a couple teaspoons of vegi bouillon, a splash of dry cherry and extra cumin and salt. Keep tasting it until is meets your expectations.

at 14.7 grams of protein per cup of cooked beans, this recipe has 73.5 grams of protein. not sure why you would need to add more.

Used Guajillo chiles. They provided a fruity flavor, but needed a little Cholula hot sauce to spice up the soup before serving. Nice for a first course. Would add some protein if I made it again to make it more of a meal.

Do not substitute the beans. Unless, of course, you think refried beans would taste good in creamy soup form.
