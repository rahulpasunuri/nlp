I love this salad. I use brown basmati rice, and it perfectly complements the delicacy of the salad. Perfect for summer, also for Meatless Mondays.

Very easy and very tasty. I subbed brown rice, apple cider vinegar, and leeks, since that's what I had in the kitchen. I only had about 1/2 or 1/3 the amount of fennel seeds on hand, and don't think I'd use the full amount even if I had it. The orange compliments and softens the fennel; this salad had a mild, fresh flavor. Highly recommended.

I would also cut a bit on the fennel. A variation I liked was to saute onions instead of chive and cook them with the fennel before mixing

I agree that this is a delicious, light side for summer. I had leftover fennel and this was great with our grilled steak. I didn't use quite as much fennel as the recipe calls for, and it was just about right - I may cut back a tad on the fennel seeds next time. This is a keeper rice recipe.

I'm always nervous making something that hasn't been reviewed, but I took a chance on this and it was excellent. A nice, light, summery side dish. I served it with the Grilled Pork Chops with Garlic Lime Sauce from this site and thought they went together really well.
