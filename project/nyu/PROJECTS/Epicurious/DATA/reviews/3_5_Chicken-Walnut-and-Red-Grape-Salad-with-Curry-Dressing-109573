My family thought this was delicious! I used a mild curry powder and a roasted chicken from the store so it was made in 15-20 minutes! I found it only served 3 for dinner, though. A definite keeper!

My son requested this salad again recently, so we made it tonight. He says it's really easy to make and tastes totally excellent (I agree with him :). This makes a great dinner for warm evenings with crusty bread and plenty of lettuce.

This was a really good salad. I used Penzeys Hot Curry. It had some kick. I added celery, and went with less ginger than on the recipe. Also, I couldnt find mango chutney, used a raspberry chutney instead. Really Tasty!!!

Very yummy. I'm vegetarian and actually substituted the chicken with tofu. Made lettuce "tacos" with it! Half the ginger.

Ok, I don't know what the fuss was all about. Seems like a waste of chicken if you ask me.

Great recipe. You can put pretty much anything in there! I used fresh strawberries.

Great recipe as is but organic grapes are smaller and don't need to be halved.I added celery and a bit more chuney. Raisins would be a nice sweet touch as well....

This is a keeper!!! Wonderful!! Took many of the suggestions given by prior reviewers. Poached the chicken, used Penzys hot curry, added chives and celery with the scallions. The rest as stated.

I love, love, love this recipe! It's so easy and it's great for hot summer days when hot food is out of the question. Modifications made: Nixed the ginger & the chutney, quadrupled the curry, doubled the walnuts and was very generous with the grapes.

Doubled the recipe for a pot-luck. I used Penzey's Tandoori seasoning-both as a rub on chicken breasts before grilling and in the dressing. My husband thought the red grapes were a bit odd for chicken salad,so in a repeat I may just use them as a garnish. No light mayo in our house-so used the good full fat stuff and nonfat yougurt!!!

This was very good but the ginger was a bit overpowering--next time I would only use a half teaspoon.

This chicken salad was very good but next time I would halve the amount of fresh ginger as it was a bit overpowering.

Will use less curry next time - maybe 1.5 tsp. Very good - I used slivered almonds because I didn't have walnuts. Will definitely make this again.

I bought a rotisserie chicken from Costco for this, and made 2 half-size batches chicken salad, the first using grapes and pecans, the second using dried apricots and cashews. A very nice, healthy dish.

I just made this for a girls' weekend and everyone--even the ones I thought wouldn't touch it--raved. I used pecans instead of walnuts, less green onions, and more yogurt than mayo. Excellent!

Best chicken salad I've ever had. Subbed hazelnuts for the walnuts, used hot chutney, and added a touch of cayenne pepper (love the spice!), next time I'll add cucumbers for a bit more of a cool crunch.

This was a winner. Per other recommendations: I added slivered almonds, grapes and used half-and-half instead of cream- all were fantastic suggestions. I doubled the sauce and the extra was fantastic a few days later with crushed peanuts and scallions over angel hair. Yum.

Loved it! I made the recipe as is with no modification and it was wonderful. Served it in a pita. I'll definitely be making this again.

Oh, yum! I could not find mango chutney and didn't have time to make my own so I used mango preserves and added a touch more madras curry...turned out wonderful. I ate it right way, can't wait to try it tomorrow stuffed in a pita after it's had a chance to develop overnight.

Oh, wow, is this ever good! I doubled the sauce recipe, with the exception of the curry, and I'm glad I did. I used 1 teaspoon Penzey's Hot Curry and one teaspoon Penzey's Sweet Curry and it was perfect. Since curry has cumulative heat, it would have been much too hot had I used all hot curry, and we love spicy. The only other changes I made were to sub ginger-garlic paste for the chopped fresh ginger, pecans for the walnuts, and golden raisins for the grapes, as my husband doesn't like them. Served in whole wheat pita, this makes a wonderful hot weather meal. Definitely a keeper!

Extra good! I doubled the curry powder and used hot mango chutney, since we like it a little spicey. Even then, it wasn't too hot. I prefer pecans to walnuts, also. I'll be making this one regularly!

Quick and delicious. Forgot to cook the chicken the night before, so I threw boneless breasts in the Foreman grill (7 mins), cubed them when done & put them in the fridge while we had martinis and an appetizer. The chicken was ready to mix with the the rest of the ingred. by the time we finished our drinks. "Frosted" the grapes for the garnish by dipping in sugar & tucked some mint leaves w/the garnish. Very pretty. Perfect dish for alfresco dining; it's sure to become a "regular" menu item at our house.

This is a never fail recipe. As others note, you can add anything (pecans, cucumbers, red onions, mango, etc) and you can play with the mayo/yogurt combo. I never add orange juice (which I think makes it a little watery), but increase the curry powder and mango chutney. By the way, there's a mango chutney by Silver Palate (with huge chunks of mango in it) that is amazing in this dish. We eat it all summer long!

This was very tasty, I added a bit of fresh mango, used salted pecans, fresh chives instead of green onions. And very easy using rotissery chicken meat.

I needed a quick dish to make ahead for a group. Everyone wanted me to give them the recipe! I added some cayenne pepper for a little heat and substituted pecans for walnuts. I also used some red onions for color. This is a very pretty salad as well as yummy!

This a a great Indian-like twist on a chicken salad recipe. Really delicious! I used Penzey's Hot Curry and found it plenty spicy enough without having to add extra (which I usually do with most recipes). My husband hates raw onions in anything, so I omitted the green onions and added a sliced up stalk of celery instead for some green color and some crunch. My husband and I both thought the subsitution worked well. We ate the leftovers as a chicken salad sandwich the next day and it was even more delicious than the first night. A definite keeper!

We truly enjoyed this recipe. I did change it a litle in that I found doubling the amount of curry powder and chutney really kicked the recipe into high gear.

I think this is a great light chicken salad recipe. It has a great balance of sweet, spicy, and salty. Chicken salads are often so heavy, and this one has a lot of flavor and is still light. Great recipe.

Previous critique said it was "very nice". That pretty much sums it up. It was okay. Which is less than "very nice". Would I make it again? Only if I was up against the wall & had everything in the kitchen. Goodness! I sure do miss the pasta! Best part of my meal was toasted sourdough bread, smeared with garlic & olive oil! Sorry Southbeach or Atkins--whatever! :)

Very nice. I didn't have mango chutney or plain yogurt on hand so used peach yogurt in place of them. Can't imagine it would made that much difference. This is an easy, light summer meal.

I'm vegetarian, and I like to adopt different recipies to be vegetarian; this dish was my most recent challenge. I added celery, used butter-lettuce to place it on, and instead of chicken, I took a pack of Veat--vegetarian chicken-like meat. It's sweet and tender, and made a perfect match with the salad's flavors--without adding any cholesterol or more fat. I just microwaved the veat for a few minutes 'til cooked, then cooled it before mixing it in. Yum!

As a heads up, if you like this, you will *love* "Chicken pasta salad in creamy curry dressing." One of my all-time epicurious favorites. Follow the reader tips though...

We loved this, too--the combination was just right, spice, texture, flavors. I had had a chicken curry salad at a deli the month before and was craving it again--this was better, I'd say. Great over greens, for dinner on a hot night.

Don't know what the issue is with the "picture" -- mine turned out looking exactly like the picture (minus the bread). Followed the recipe as written and it was WONDERFUL! I love curry and this was a great combo of flavors and textures, with the grapes and the walnuts. VERY yummy.

Everyone loved this salad! I added celery which gave it an interesing texture and used pecans which are less bitter than walnuts.

I want to know what the picture is of, as it is clearly not the chicken salad. Yum!

I was nervous about making this recipe because it sounded a little weird, but yum! Definitely one to make again and again. I made the following changes based on what I had in the house: West Indian curry powder & chutney, dried ginger for the fresh and some extra red onion because I like the crunch. I also added about a 1/4 teaspoon of honey, to make up for the spiciness of this chutney compared to regular chutney. Then I added a tablespoon more yogurt, because I think I used too much chicken. The results are really outstanding - sweet, spicy and creamy.

It didn't turn out looking quite the same as the picture, I'm not sure why.......
