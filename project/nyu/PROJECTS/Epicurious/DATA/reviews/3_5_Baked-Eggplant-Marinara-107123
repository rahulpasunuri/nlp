It is great. For me, I'm trying to cut back on meats and add more vegetarian dishes to my diet and this fits perfectly. Used slices of BelGioioso mozzarella cheese (Thanks Errico) on top and skipped the ricotta since that is all I had.

This is great! Healthy, fast and delicious! My vegetarian friends and my carnivorous husband love this recipe. I make it all the time.

I am lactose intolerant and so used (sheep) pecorino romano (sp?) and goat mozzarella. Left off the ricotta. Used panko. Made my own marinara following the Gourmet 2004 recipe (as advised by others) but see my notes on that. Added a lot of stuff to the sauce, but it was fabulous. This dish was delicious and I am not that fond of eggplant, but I will make it again soon.

This was good, but not fantastic. I love eggplant, but I think the layers of cheese and sauce overwhelmed the eggplant flavor. I also like my eggplant softer, so I think I will adjust the cooking time when I make it next. I thought the baking time didn't quite get the mozarella to the doneness that I prefer, so I broiled it for less than a minute at the end.

This was very good and really easy to prepare. A great way to prepare eggplant. I will for sure be making it again and will add the basil as suggested by others.

Excellent. Real Italian flavors. The ricotta is unneeded; use more mozzarella. I substituted unsalted cracker crumbs for the bread crumbs. Also, why on earth would anyone reading these reviews use "purchased marinara sauce", when it is so easy to make your own and is so much better than the supermarket stuff. See "Basic Tomato Sauce" in Epicurious, using the additions commented on by "A Cook from Austin, TX on 02/10/03". Serve with linguini or similar.

This is a good weeknight dish. I made as written, but noticed it would be easy to change: you can skip the ricotta, the mozarella, or both. You could add another vegetable atop the eggplant, such as roasted red pepper. I think next time I will skip the mozarella and instead of a plain marinara sauce, use a chunky, one instead with mushrooms or some other vegetable. Will definitely make again!

This was very good. I served it with roast chix and my husband says he could have made a meal off the eggplant alone. Only one change to the recipe--I didn't have ricotta cheese so just added more mozarella and parmesan cheeses. I'll definitely make this one again!

My husband and I aren't big eggplant eaters so this recipe was a nice surprise. Followed the recipe as written (always try to the first time!) and it turned out nicely. The only downfall was with only the two of us, there were a lot of leftovers and microwaving them the next day made the eggplant rather mushy. After that, we warmed leftovers in the toaster oven (about 350) to much better results.

This is an excellent dish for the family or for company. I skip the ricotta, top the fried eggplant with sliced fresh basil, then marinara (try Newman's Own Mushroom Marinara), then a mixture of mozzarella, cheddar and crumbled goat cheese. Yum. The kids like it too.

This isn't an amazing and original recipe, but it's great for a home cooked meal in an Italian family. Its classic comfort food, and is a good dish if you want to cook together with someone (one person preparing the eggplants for frying while another fries them), which I think is nice because there aren't many recipes really good for a team (and its a joy to cook a nice meal with your significant other)... Basically, I wouldnt recomend this recipe to impress your friends, but I would certainly recommend it for a nice family meal.

Always a hit. Serve this whenever I make chicken parm, for the vegetarians, but it's also always popular with the meat-eaters.

Slamming. edited review 04/11/04: I upped my review to "4 forks" from 3. This recipe is a consistent winner. Great for satisfying vegetarians and omnivours alike. So tasty... Also, for those who might think this dish sounds a little heavy, I have made this recipe 4 or 5 times now and I have skipped the ricotta every time. Seemed like overkill.

I used fresh whole-milk ricotta in this recipe- I think it made a big difference. I would make this again, but thought it was a bit heavy, so it'd have to be on special occasions.

Y-U-M!!! I love eggplant and am tireing of eggplant parm & rollatini. I made this recipe last night - it is SO easy and delicious. I ran out of fresh ground bread crumbs for one eggplant round and used store bought on the one - it really makes a difference! Use the fresh bread crumbs. I may make this for a party I'll be having this summer - it was so easy!

My beau is from the midwest so steak and potatoes are IT. Until I made this for him, he had never had a meatless entree! He actually liked it and even asked me to make it again! Really easy to dish up.

I usually cook eggplant for my husband and than eat it reluctantly as I have never cared for it, until I made this dish. It was fantastic! Would make it over and over again.

This stuff was awesome! My boyfriend was really leery about the idea of eggplant when I told him about this. He ate it all and so did I. Yummy, yummy, yummy.

Yahoo! When both kids and adults like something it deserves a whole new category beyond forks! Easy, tasty and even fun for kids to make. They look like little pizzas. The recipe is very easy to adjust amounts. I also added a bit of feta to the ricotta. Enjoy!

Though I must confess I used purchased french bread crumbs the dish was wonderful. We will enjoy it again, I'm certain.

"4 Forks?? Hell yeah!" says my fiance with enthusiasm after eating this dish. This is a GREAT way to prepare eggplant- and I also prepared chicken in the same manner alongside it, so we could get some more protein. Delectable.

This recipe was so delicious and easy to make. My meat-eating family didn't even care that they were eating a vegetarian meal - it was so tasty! I'm a new vegetarian and this recipe makes a great meal for those days when I crave something that's as filling as an ol' "meat & potatoes" kind of meal.

this is one of the best egg plant recipies that I have found yet

The recipe didn't call for salting and draining the eggplant, but I had already started that process so went ahead with it. The eggplant was great..not soggy and the breading was nice and crisp. This is a good dish for an appetizer or an entree.

This was excellent! My 2 year old, who is a very picky eater, loved it! He usually never eats "seconds," but with this he did. This dish is also easy and quick to prepare.

This is a good, tasty, vegetarian dish, but not very 'kid friendly'.

Very tasty and simple to make! I used larger eggplants; and it seemed to work out fairly well, although I probably should have increased the number of eggs to 3 or 4 so that they coated more evenly. Added a pizza/pasta spice mix for that extra seasoning.

Delicioso! I made a few changes. I added onion powder, garlic powder and ground cayenne pepper to the rounds while I was adding the salt and pepper. I also added minced garlic and itialian seasoning to the bread crumbs. I couldn't get enough. I will definatly make this again.

Being a big eggplant fan I was anxious to try this recipe and was not disappointed! Simple and tasty, i followed another reviewers' suggestion to add fresh basil. Had some leftovers, so added pesto and additional mozzarella to eggplant rounds. Very nice!

I found this recipe to be quite easy to make and very satisfying. I used baby eggplant so as to have small medalions, it looked as good as it tasted.

This was delicious! I sprinkled fresh, thinly-sliced basil leaves on each eggplant round before putting on the sauce. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.

We prepared this dish exactly to recipe specs and it was good. Flavors actually blended a little too perfect for our palates. We will definitely try this again but next time plan to use maybe a lasagna sauce to give it more zip. Serve with tossed salad, crusty french bread and red wine for a perfect meal.
