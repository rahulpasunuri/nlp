Even my Thai food hating husband liked this one. I used a curry paste from our local oriental market - Maesri is the brand and it was perfect. My changes were that I sauteed the chicken, then added the ginger and red bell pepper. I only used 1/2 cup of stock and 1/4 cup of fresh basil. I did increase the amount of broccoli and I still could've added more veggies.

Rating: 3
Even though the recipe calls for pasta, I decided to go more traditional and use rice. It was quite good for being at home Thai food. Be careful though, the recipe calls for 2 tablespoons of of Thai red curry paste, but I would say that unless you generally like to order at least a 5 on the spicey scale in an actual Thai restaurant, you may want to use less.

Not impressed. This smelled much better than it tasted. Here are the suggested adjustments: 1) Make sure your curry has the right amount of heat you're after - mine was weak, so 2TBS did not add much spice 2) Also ensure your coconut milk has richness and flavor 3) Be careful not to add all the pasta, as there may not be enough sauce for your liking. Rather than mix it all together, place the desired amount of sauce on your pasta when serving. 4) Double the broccoli - it's the only ingredient that soaks up the sauce, and adds a ton of texture, health, and flavor. 5) Don't wimp out on the cornstarch - enough is needed to thicken the sauce so it will stick to the noodles. Not a great recipe overall, but the individual flavors are lovely.

This was really tasty and easy to prepare. I had to make a few adjustments. I decreased the red curry paste to 1 Tbl + 1 tsp to get to the desired heat level. I also used ground ginger and dried basil as we did not have any on hand. Like some other reviewers, I added sugar to taste until it balanced all the other flavors. We served this over penne and really enjoyed the unique flavor and how quickly it came together. I will definitely make this again!

I just made this tonight, and it came out wonderful. Did not have a problem with it being too spicy- used mild curry paste and sweetened coconut milk, so this may have helped. Actually, it was not spicy enough for my husband's taste, so he added Sriracha but I liked it without the added spice. I agree it needs more veggies, so will add more to it next time- there is enough sauce for it!

Made this last night for three adults and two children. Our two boys were delighted when the food was placed in front of them and asked for seconds. I used purple basil and also red/yellow peppers - the colour was lovely. There was enough left for 1 lunch - too bad I didn't get it. I did add a bit more chicken/peppers and broccoli - we love vegies. Lots of sauce - a little loose, but we spooned it over our servings. Enjoy.... :)

Used regular coconut milk because that's what I had in the house. Added lots more vegies- 2 broccoli crowns, 1 1/2 large sweet peppers, and 2 zuccinis. Since I know that my curry paste is VERY hot, I only used 1 tablespoon, and that was enough of a kick. Also added a touch of honey, since Thai curries I've eaten in restaurants have a sweetness to them, and this one doesn't. Still didn't taste a little sweet.

Rating: 4
Excellent...spicy but not too hot. Will definitely make this again. I made a few minor changes: 1) I substituted whole wheat pasta (linguine) for the regular pasta. The richer, grainy flavor held up well to the spicy sauce. 2) I added more veggies; two medium red bell peppers instead of one, and about a pound of broccoli crowns instead of the very skimpy 5 ounces called for in the recipe. I think I might even try adding more/different vegetables the next time. The sauce was a little thin...I'll probably add a little more cornstarch next time. This makes a very large amount of food. The recipe says it serves 4-6, but I think it's a very generous 6 servings. Anyway, it's a great recipe, and it can be easily adapted to a variety of ingredients. Highly recommended!

Absolutely delicious! Many people had complained that it was too spicy, but I didn't find that at all. Maybe my curry paste was milder than that of other reviewers. Either way, it was a very flavorful, easy and delicious meal that I will continue to make for years to come!

I don't care what any of you say, this dish is GREAT. So flavorful and was so popular at a party I went to that I had to chime in. I used regular coconut milk, instead of unsweetened, and I used chicken boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts and it was really, really good. The 2 T of curry paste added just the right amount of heat.

Rating: 1
Agree completely with those who say it's all heat and no flavor. I'm not even sure that reducing the amount of the curry paste will redeem this dish. I'm finding that when I make a recipe with very mixed reviews - half pro and half con - I tend to agree with the cons.

Rating: 3
Two tablespoons of red curry is a bit too spicy so I added a little brown sugar to tone it down. Otherwise- delicious and I will make again. Next time I'll try sauteeing the chicken seperately to get it a little crunchy- it comes out very soft cooked in the liquid. Would also be good w/ green curry.

Rating: 3
I'm not averse to improvisation but I don't think this recipe needs it. The curry tasted perfect and very much like the curry at my favorite Thai restaurant. I love spicy food and found the 2 tablespoons of curry paste just right, but I could see that it would be too hot for many people. I used Thai basil that I have growing and that gave it a real authenticity of flavor. I might try it with rice or rice noodles next time.

I've made this dish a number of times and find it terrific! I buy Thai red curry paste from the Asian supermarket, and only need a scant 1Tablespoon. Other than that I make no changes to the recipe except to add more veggies if the mood strikes. We LOVE it!

Rating: 1
This dish did not work out too well for me. I used regular coconut milk as other cooks suggested. I don't know if it would have been better if I had used light coconut milk, but the cocnut flavor was too strong. I also felt that the red curry paste was hot but lacked any flavor.

Loved this recipe, but next time will definately use a little less curry paste. Boyfriend raved about it!

Thank you, Norfolk, MA for your suggested modifications. I started by sauteeing diced yellow AND green onion in about 2 T. of oil, then added the minced garlic and ginger and sauteed for 1 minute. To this, I added the curry paste (used the whole packet of Thai Kitchen Red Curry Base) and sauteed to release the essential oils. From there, I followed the recipe, but added more veggies (sugar snap peas, baby corn, straw mushrooms, etc.) and served it over jasmine rice. I also added more lime juice to taste and some chili-garlic sauce (about 2 T.) I had no problem with the consistency and everyone LOVED it. It definitely had a kick, but was not blow-your-head-off hot. This is a definite keeper!

Rating: 3
Love this recipe -- very tasty, very spicy (I use the lesser amount of red curry paste, and it's plenty hot). If the sauce seems too thin, regular (i.e. not "lite")coconut milk will correct that, although you gain calories and lose authenticity (which doesn't mean it isn't great!).

Rating: 2
I was disappointed with this recipe. I followed other's advice & added garlic & peanut butter, but still the taste didn't come through enough. I also found the curry to be quite thin...I overdosed on constarch to get consistency down. I'll try it again using more garlic, peanut butter, onions, etc.

I loved this dish, but it was way too spicy for my kids! I only added 2 teaspoons of red curry paste--wow that stuff is lethal! No problem, though, because my husband and I finished it off as leftovers! Yum!

Delicious. Even my 4 year old and 10 month old loved this dish. Based on earlier reviews, I added only about 2.5 teaspoons of curry paste for the kids, and the dish had just a little heat. I also added more veggies - snap peas, carrots and some mushrooms. Easy and great!!

Holy smokes, Batman - this dish is HOT!!! We thought it was very good but will only add 1 Tbsp. of red curry paste next time. I wonder if it's a typo - maybe it should read 2 tsp. of curry instead of 2 Tbs?

I rate this 4 including all the modifications I made to the recipe--I followed the advice given by the other reviewers and added 1 T. peanut butter, and 2 T. minced garlic. I didn't have parsley so I used cilantro. I didn't have green onions so I used a small green pepper. I also added 2 T. garlic chili pepper sauce (My family loves fire). I also added 2 handfuls of peapods. I didn't use the linguini... instead we just had it with rice. For the curry paste I used 1 packet of Taste of Thai Red Curry Paste. It tasted yummy and everyone was happy.

Rating: 1
This recipe was nothing special by itself. It needs something besides regular pasta, this doesn't fit well with the thai flavors. Also, using Thai Kitchen curry paste makes the dish VERY hot so beware. I used green beans instead of brocoli and that was nice but it's very easy to over cook breast chunks. Basically this was a dish I fed to my housemates who didn't know any better...they did like it though.

Rating: 3
I followed the advice of previous cooks and was liberal with garlic, ginger, Thai hot pepper sauce and curry paste - and it was scorching hot. I wouldn't advise adding more than the recommended curry paste, and would add the hot pepper sauce at the very end after tasting. Also added zucchini and red pepper - it was a hit with my husband.

Rating: 3
I added garlic & peaunt butter to this dish(surprising, yes! But very good!)...it needed a little something extra and I think the peanut butter gave it that Thai peanutty taste! And I added lots of vegetables- baby corn, mushrooms, carrots, etc. It made for a wonderful dish!

This is a good basic recipe that begs for improvisation: I have added fresh blanched english peas, edamame, bias cut fennel stalks, asparagus, julienne chili peppers, cherry tomatoes, roasted peanuts, Thai chili-garlic sauce, extra garlic and ginger and experimented with green curry as well and have found the results exceedingly satisfying. Also, I found it best to add fish sauce to taste as the amount specified was not enough in my book. Be creative and work with what's in season is my motto!

This is a very good Thai curry recipe. I agree that the brand of curry you use will dictate how much you use. I used Thai Kitchen red curry and the amount called for was too hot for my husband. Served with Udon noodles.

This is a nice & easy dish to make. I have now made it three times, and each time everyone really liked it - getting better every time! The brand of cyrry paste really matters! The first time I used the recommended 2 Tbsp, which was too little, and next time I put in the rest of the little jar of the same curry paste to make it hot enough (4-5 Tbsp). Last time I used a different brand, and 2 Tbsp was more on the spicy side! A few times I didn't have fresh ginger, basil, or green onions on hand, but I added dried basil early, and it came out fine. Also, I have added a bit of peanut sauce each time, and served some on the side. Makes it even hotter!

I made this last night for my sister and my family. My sister loved it and didn't feel it was too spicy. The rest of my family thought it was on the spicy side.

I thought this was very good! We substituted cilantro for basil which I believe added some flavor. I would say, it needs something sweet. Like the sweat peanut stuff they put on top of Pad Thai. Not sure what that is though...

Very good - although the sauce is a little thin (I even used real coconut milk, not lowfat). I added yellow and red jalapeno instead of red bell pepper. I have to say that my favorite curry recipe of all time is still the Red Curry with Salmon and Bok Choy!

Excellent! Using only 1 T. of curry paste was perfect, even my teenage daughter enjoyed it. I used cilantro instead of basil, and added 1 1/2 T. brown sugar to unsweetened milk. The heat seemed to have dissipated somewhat the next day, so I added a splash of chili-garlic sauce, with a fresh squeeze of lime and crushed peanuts. The sauce was a little thin for the pasta, and will try it over jasmine rice next time.

This dish burned by lips (and I like spicy food) - - the 2 T. of red curry paste was just too much. I plan to try it again w/ a 1-2 t. of paste and more broccoli.

I like spicy food, but this pushes my limit. Otherwise, an excellent, easy, and impressive dish. I too would use more broccoli the next time. For the benefit of other reviewers, the "red pepper" is a sweet vegetable, not hot. The heat comes from the Thai red curry paste only.

This recipe is very simple to make and tasty to eat. I used 1 teas. of chili paste and lemon grass and 1 Tblsp. brown sugar. I made the sauce more like the one in Salmon with Thai Curry and Bok Choy. I used 1 lb. chicken and 1/2 lb. pork loin and doubled the broccoli. It is great over rice.

I used the Thai Kitchen Red Curry Paste, and I suspect two tablespoons could be too much for gentle palates. However, all my "victims" thought it was spicy, but just right. I'd probably try the recipe over rice next time, and dabble with additional veggies (mushrooms, pea pods, etc.). Overall, a nice change of pace, and quick enough for a working mom to make on a weeknight.

Rating: 3
Wonderful! Though I agree with other reviewers that it helps to be a lover of spicy food (which I am)... If you want to cut down on the heat, use less curry paste, not less red bell pepper. The bell pepper adds more of a fresh/sweet taste than spicy.

I too cut the red pepper in half and it was still rather hot but very good. All of my guests loved it and several asked for the recipe.

Do not use light coconut milk to make this recipe, unless you are a) going to cut back on the amount of red curry or b)a lover of incredibly spicy food! We make this dish often; the flavors are delicious and it makes for a lot of leftovers (we actually think it's better the next day).

I made this recipe for some friends who also like spicey food. I used sweetened coconut milk and cut back the paste to 1 Tbsp. which was plenty! It was very,very tastey and I will definately make it again!

Too spicy??? I made some changes. I sauteed grated ginger, the white parts of the scallion, minced red chili pepper, garlic in Pam before adding the chile paste and coconut. Added chicken next and removed when cooked. Added thes rest of ingredients per recipe including some mint along with basil. When done I tossed with bean thread noodles, extra chopped basil, mint, and scallion greens. It was spicy, but not too hot for me. I enjoyed this one!

YUCK!!!!! The amount of ginger is overwhelming, the amout of curry paste is rediculous and inedible, it was so so so hot. This dish had nothing that even remotely reminded me of a good thai dish, and I will be promptly removing it from my recipe box. What a waste of time and money this one was :(

I was terribly sick of chicken dishes, so I decided to try this with catfish instead. It worked wonderfully! The catfish was firm enough to hold together during the cooking and made it a little more interesting than your average chicken dish. I also served it over jasmine rice instead of the pasta, and I probably would cut back on the red curry paste next time.

great taste. I used only 1 tab curry paste. will use a little more next time. Will definitely thicken the sauce more next time as it spashed over everywhere when serving. Tasted even better the next day as the noodles absorbed the sauce.

A good dish using Thai flavors, and I found it tastes even better the next day after the flavors have had a chance to sit with each other. I followed the advice of the others and served it with rice instead of pasta. I agree, I think that works better. I would recommend cutting back the green onions to a half cup, tho.

I made a vegetarian version with extra-firm tofu and vegetable broth. Left out the broccoli because my boyfriend doesn't like it, but added extra peppers and some pineapple. served it with jasmine rice, not pasta, and sliced cucumbers dressed with rice vinegar. The pineapple was a great addition--some sweet with the heat. Next time, I too will cut back a bit on the Thai Kitchen red curry paste.

This was delish! Simple to make, complex taste. I would follow other suggestions to increase the amount of vegetables, including your own favorites such as bean sprouts and mushrooms. Like Phat Thai, it's even better with crushed peanuts on top. Panang curry paste adds the right amount of heat with a unique curry taste and try using cilantro mixed with a small amount of mint leaves instead of the basil. A definite keeper...

This was a great dish!! I added thin strips of steak instead of chicken,and peapods and cilantro.I don't know if I was using another kind of thai red curry paste but it only had a hint of heat.

I must have bought really hot curry paste, because I found this had quite the kick. To have someone saying that they would make it hotter made my eyes water.

I used shell noodles to catch all the lovely juices and since I love cilantro, will probably try that next time.

Our family likes spicy food too, but I don't know where the other reviewer got their curry paste--this ended up being so hot that no one could eat it except me!
