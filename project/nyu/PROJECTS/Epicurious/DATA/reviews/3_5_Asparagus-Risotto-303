This is the second time I make this recipe. There are so many similar recipes on this site and elsewhere but I find this one is the truest to what we made in Italy. It's simple and if you follow the recipe as written, you can't mess up, it produces perfectly textured risotto every time. Of course, make sure you use the best arborio you can find.

Delicious. Like many others, I decreased the amount of butter by about half. Even my meat-aholic boyfriend was a huge fan!

Rating: 4
This recipe is one of our absolute favorites. Like some of the other reviewers, I cut the butter way down to probably 1.5 TBS and I also often throw in green peas and some cut green beans to make it into a green veggie risotto. Everyone loves it!

Great! Followed other suggestions and added lemon zest and grilled the aaparagus.

After reading the other reviews I added a bit of lemon zest with the cheese which I thought went well with the asparagus. It would probably be good either way though.

Wow!!! after reading a number of reviews I made this for company.. it was easy and VERY tasty. My only changes were to cut the butter down as most of the reviewers suggested and I added about a half a teaspoon of grated lemon peel with the cheese.... will make this again..SOON!

Great dish, only change I made was reducing the butter to 1 tbsp from 6 tbsp... and even that 1 probably wasn't necessary. Will definitely be making again.

This is a simple recipe that I chose because I happened to have all the ingredients except fresh parmesan cheese. I substituted it with pecorino romano and it was spectacular. We didn't even need to add salt and pepper. I will definitely be making this again on those nights when you want something good but you don't have much to work with.

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM-----Heaven on earth! I had some imported arborio rice on hand as well as lovely fresh asparagus....my favorite vegetable. This came out perfectly as directed in 20 minutes. For the first timer to risotto, I would suggest turning up the heat a little bit....slightly higher than medium works best, for me that's #6. Risotto should be pretty much "rolling" at all times.

Rating: 3
Amazing results but there is no way that it takes 20 minutes to cook this risotto. I needed at least 40 minutes to get this risotto to the texture that I wanted. Keeping that in mind, though, I would definitely make this again.

I really enjoyed this risotto. I halved the recipe to make as a side for my husband and I. I had enough left over for snacking on arancini the next day. The only change I made was that I only used the top 3 inches of the asparagus and cut into 1 inch pieces. I also squeezed a little fresh lemon juice on the asparagus after draining. Used a riesling for the wine, it turned out nicely.

Rating: 4
We made this recipe as published (with the small exception of 1 tsp of lemon zest). It is one of the best risottos I have tasted. Wonderful rich flavors with the fresh spring asparagus. As a main course, it does feed 4, probably 8 as a side. I think the cautions re butter are overstated. Will make again and again and again. No wonder it has been around since 1995!

Rating: 4
This was really lovely. As has been suggested, I used only half the butter. I also added a little lemon juice (which made a big difference) and some salt and pepper. One could leave out the Parmesan, but I wouldn't recommend it. As for wine, as Epicurious suggests, white Bordeaux is the way to go; however, don't be afraid to try a white Bordeaux-style (Sauvignon Blanc/Semillon) blend from elsewhere, as long as it's good. I drank a lovely one from Canada, Jackson-Triggs Meritage Grand Reserve, and it was an exquisite pairing!

This is great! I'm allergic to dairy and kept the butter out. my husband and son poured Parmesan at the table. Very easy to make and delicious!

maybe it was because this was my first time making risotto of any kind but I wasn't super impressed. the asparagus came out great though. I was hoping this would turn out creamier than it did. I'll try it again in case it was just the result of my being a risotto virgen.

Rating: 3
Nice recipe with simple ingredients. I made it non-dairy by substituting olive oil for butter and serving the cheese on the side. I think in the future I'll add black olives if I make it non-dairy so to maintain some of the salt lost when removing the parmesan.

I love this recipe. I blanch the asparagus in the broth not water and I add shrimp which I also cook in the broth before adding to the rice.

Definitely serves wat more than four people. This was good, but very very rich. I only stirred in half the butter in the final step, and I still felt like there was too much. Te flavor is nice, though.

Very disappointing. A waste of good asparagus and parmesan. A lot of work for something so blah. FYI: Says serves 4, more like 10.

Rating: 3
I intended to halve this recipe and did so, but still used 3TBPS of butter and 3 oz of cheese(accidentally) Despite that, it still turned out well, though a little cheesy and probably not the healthiest preparation. I'm also a vegetarian so used vegetable broth and that worked fine.

Rating: 3
This is a staple of mine -- it's a great basic risotto and you can add any other vegetable or ingredient besides asparagus if you like. Also, I only use half the butter, I don't think 6TB is necessary.

Rating: 2
Maybe I should not give this a fork rating as I cut the butter in half, but I see that others did with excellent results. I also added crispy prosciutto at the end which added a salty contrast to an otherwise rather bland risotto. This one just wasn't my favorite.

I love asparagus and risotto and enjoyed the combo of both in this dish. Even my sig.other enjoyed it and he gets tired of asparagus. Very good with grilled meat.

Rating: 4
For those who thought this recipe was slightly bland for risotto, I found the following adaptations to result in a fabulous and slightly complex tasting final product: Started by sauteing some carrot matchsticks w/onions in olive oil, then added a generous splash of balsamic vinegar and the white wine just before adding the rice. Also mixed in a little minced garlic about half way through the cooking process. With these changes (and I entirely left out the 6 tablespoons of butter) I ended up with a very tastey, creamy asparagus risotto that was enjoyed by all.

Rating: 3
Very yummy. Not a very sophisticated tasting risotto, in that a lot of the taste comes from the parmesan cheese. Its not a complex flavor. But the parmesan and asparagus complemented each other very nicely. Served it with a grilled chicken breast topped with a balsamic reduction.

I made this in the pressure cooker. After 4 minutes on high pressure, release and add asparagus and stir for two or three minutes until creamy in texture. I omitted the butter for a lower fat version. This was excellent!

delicious. i used beef stock, just because i didn't have chicken. but still it tasted very good. i also put asparagus 15 minutes before the rice was done. i like it better this way as it blends the flavor to risotto and becomes softer. i also used only 2 TB of butter and it turned out great. i would definitely make it again!

Good risotto to pair with a more complicated entree. Cut amount of broth (also used veggie) and substituted some of the reserved water from blanched asparagus. Also used extra dry vermouth instead of wine.

Be sure to heed the 'NO SALT' part of the chicken broth in the recipe. I anticipated that it would be salt with my regular broth, so cut it in half, and the recipe turned out great! I also cut the butter down to 3T. We loved the recipe.

I found this recipe to add to my book club's Tuscan dinner menu; it has become MY FAVORITE DISH in the world I think. I've made it 8-10 times so far, with no end in sight. I was a first-time risotto cook and everything worked beautifully. Used medium grain rice and loved it. I keep thinking I'll branch out anad add different things, but so far I can't seem to get past the asparagus!

I loved this recipie. I had a similar dish in a restaurant recently, and I think next time I would try to do it as the restaurant did, with a creamy sauce base. Next time, instead of the 6 T butter, I would add a cream sauce, then the cheese. Give it a try!

Rating: 4
This dish is fantastic -- definitely a restaurant-style dish (and it was my first time cooking risotto). I cut the recipe in half, however living in Colorado at this altitude, I used more than half of the chicken broth, about 3-4 cups. I also increased the cooking time to 35 min. In addition, I added thinly sliced grilled beef tenderloin. With a good glass of wine this dish is a huge hit!

I had this at an evening baby showing dinner and then made it a few nights later for our family. I made it w/ the Marsala Chicken w/ Mushrooms and the entire meal was delicious. My husband and 19 month old son loved it. I have since emailed both recipes to many of my friends.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. The flavor is so fantastic I can't wait to try it on company. I halved the recipe and it was still a lot for 2 people as an accompaniment. I think a full recipe would easily serve 8. I added half of a (chopped) red bell pepper for color and additional flavor and used half each of fresh parmesan and Asiago because that's what I had on hand. Also used reduced fat butter. I cut the asparagus into 1" pieces and next time may add more asparagus. I used all the broth and it took 20 minutes. Really simple.

Rating: 4
This was really wonderful. Thanks to previous reviewers advice, I didn't use all 5 cups of broth, and instead used some of the water used to cook the asparagus. The asparagus may need a slightly longer cooking time, although as it sat in the hot risotto on the table, it did seem to get less crunchy. Possibly don't need as much cheese as called for. All in all, heavenly.

Rating: 3
Great recipe for a first time risotto maker! I'd cut the asparagus amount to half a pound though. Also, I alternated between the chicken broth and using the water the asparagus cooked in, to give it a little bit more of an asparagus flavor, and saving on the amount of broth needed.

Delicious. Take the advice of SF and cut the parmesan cheese in half. For slightly firm risotto, the 20 minutes listed was almost 5 minutes too long.

Wonderful risotto recipe. I use leeks instead of onion for a more springy feel. Also cust back on the butter and use 1/2 recommended quantity of cheese by using parmigano reggiano.

Super! I put half the butter required and melted it with the olive oil before sauteing the onions (6 tablespoons at the end just seemed like overkill). I also added "just thawed" frozem peas with the asparagus and gruyere cheese mixed in with the parmasan. Absolutely great.

I made this with Salmon and a mushroom sauce. It was given good reviews, except that the risotto was toooo flavorful. This often happen when I make risotto with fish and I would recommend in this case not adding as much of the cheese, but instead adding enough to your taste.

risotto is a fun word to say. yet again another fine dish. I would recomend only using 4 cups of chicken broth. it was a little watery. We enjoyed it, and we will make it again and again. we did not know how to blanch asparagus so please email us and tell what we did wrong.

I made this the other night and it was terrific. I added chopped portobello mushrooms. I had to add additional chicken broth and I ended up adding a little half and half. It also took 30 minutes to cook rather than 20. It made enough for two of the four people eating it to have seconds and we still had leftovers for two the next day. I will definitely make it again and may try new ingredients in it.

I really enjoy this dish. I substitute part vegetable broth for one or two cups of the liquid. Letting the dish stand for 3-5 minutes removed from the heat before serving improves the texture. A very nice recipe.
