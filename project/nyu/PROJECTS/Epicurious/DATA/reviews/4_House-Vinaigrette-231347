very simple and creamy. (remember to season the salad with salt and pepper, since the base recipe does not call for any!)

Absolutely the best vinaigrette! I'm wishing I had found it sooner.

Gorgeous simplicity. I make this dressing at least once a week.

Perfect as is. For a change of pace, you can also use sherry vinegar, or add shallots, or chives, etc.

This is a fabulous classic dressing. Like the other reviewer, I use it with Bibb Lettuce salad on this site. Simple yet it never fails to impress.

This was very simple to prepare and it's a great base dressing. Note that you need to add salt, pepper, and any other desired seasonings when using this vinaigrette (see Bibb lettuce salad recipe for an example).
