Very good! The wine did reduce and it took maybe 10 minutes instead of 8. I made sure to use a heavy saucepan and that it was simmering nicely. I have also made the other horseradish sauce from this site and I like this one better. Both good but there is a richer flavor here. I don't like really strong horseradish and this recipe isn't heavy on it. Just add a bit more if you really love strong horseradish.

Excellent! I have made this several times to serve with beef. I also increased the horseradish by a little bit. Also, put in some good quality fresh ground pepper. As for the amt of wine-one cup will reduce and give you very good flavor. Keep the one cup of wine as is. Finally-- make this ahead and let this sit in the fridge for a day or two.

I have been making this recipe for many years to serve as an accompaniment to sliced beef tenderloin and rolls at parties. It is delicious-- very flavorful and the wine reduction adds nice depth. I think the recipe is correct as written re: the 1 cup of wine. Some cooks below were suspecting an error. Keep in mind that the reduction needs to be concentrated enough to flavor a full cup of sour cream, which is fairly bland.

This was a perfect compliment to the Roast Prime Rib Au Poivre that I made. It was easy to make and the guests loved it. Next time I might add a bit more chives and thyme.

Perfect creamy horseradish sauce!! Except for the error in the recipe regarding the amount of wine (use only 1/4 cup as suggested by previous reviewers!!!) this created a delicious compliment to my prime rib. I added a bit extra of the horseradish for more bite and had plenty leftover to use on sandwiches.

I suspect this recipe has an error in it. It says to reduce a cup of wine along with 2 tablespoons of other ingredients to 2 tablespoons in about 8 minutes. That is not possible. It took about 45 minutes which leads me to believe the cup of wine should have been a quarter cup. It was a waste of good wine. The end result was good but not worth the trouble it took. A simpler recipe without the herbs would have been fine.

this is delicious!! i doubled the recipe, ended up with WAY too much but ended up using the remainder on baked salmon later in the week--Excellent!!!

The ratio of horseradish to sour cream was too great for us so I simply reduced the horseradish and did everything else the same. We liked it very much--it accompanied the prime rib we served at Christmas.

Wonderful. Make day before to "marry" flavors.

An excellent, easy sauce - perhaps too much horseradish. I liked it with salmon fillet.

The shallots and white wine give this simple sauce a complexity that is delightful, especially when combined with the fresh herbs. In the past I have just combined horseradish with sour cream, but this method is a big improvement - delicious with roast beef!
