I made this recipe and combined it with the Pumpkin Brulee Pie recipe for the crispy topping and it was absolutely DELICIOUS!!! Everyone loved it. Just a little whipped cream is all that it required for the perfect dessert! Will definitely make this again, very soon.

I felt this recipe, while not terrible, was flawed in a few spots. First, I found that 55 minutes cooking time was not enough; I had to add about 20 minutes on top of that. Second, I didn't see any advantage to blind baking the crust. That initial 30 minutes plus the 55+ needed for the pie will lead to overdone crust no matter what, and yes, I used a shield the entire time. Finally, I felt this pie could have been a bit sweeter. I appreciated the slightly tangy note and richness the sour cream provided but I would still add an extra, say, 1/4 cup of sugar if I made it again. Very nice texture, though.

Excellent flavor. It made quite a lot of filling for the 9" crust, so I baked it longer than the recipe indicated. It took a while for the center to set. Everyone raved.

I use a different crust, butthis filling is delicious and my family loves this for Thanksgiving when they want a classic type pumpkin pie. The Sour Cream cuts the edge of the sweetness of the standard pumpkin pie.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this pie ended up in the trash..something that has NEVER happened with a pie of mine before! Everyone agreed this was boring, boring, boring. I will NOT make this again.

This was delicious. I used low fat sour cream (if I can save a few grams of fat here and there, why not?)and it worked out beautifully. I could really taste the sour cream in the pie and that gave it the distinctive flavor. It was both light and rich. I didn't skimp on the whipped cream topping though! This recipe is a real find.

Made and served on Thanksgiving. Used a crust from Gourmet 12/99(vg), and a walnut topping.Pie was "tangy" tasting,that day probably from sour cream, but tastes fine today. Very creamy texture. Not sure if I'd make again, or use my own.

The pie was good-rather "fluffy" texture as compared to the usual pumpkin pie. I made the pumpkin cheesecake pie with cornmeal crust last week which I found much better to my liking.

Great for Thanksgiving.

I have made this recipe numerous times, to rave reviews. The lighter texture of this pie makes it a super ending to hearty holiday meals.

Interesting alternative to your run of the mill pumpkin pie!
