The best easiest breakfast recipe I have found. Reminds me of custard sticky buns all rolled into one. This is my favorite because I can do it the night before and it still amazing two hours after coming out of the oven. We like to wait for the carmel to set before serving (about 20 min) I normally serve with whipped cream that has very little sugar and fresh berries. I will serve with cranberry sauce in the fall. I have left out the grand mariner and I use whatever bread I have on hand. How can you go wrong with these ingredients.

One of my favorite recipes, we have been making this since it was published in 1998. This recipes is the most requested brunch item in our house. Rave reviews from anyone who tastes this delicious dish. Do yourself a favor...make this dish ASAP and serve it with bacon.

Far too eggy and sweet for me. Next time I will cut back on eggs and sugar. It came out very soggy too, so I might try firmer bread next time and leave the crusts on.

Hi Elisa I certainly don't think you need to double the time. But I'd allow a little extra time. You can check it as it cooks. For me, when all the liquid in the pan I'm using has solidified it's ready to go. By the way, this is awesome topped with fresh strawberries mixed with a little sugar and Grand Marnier!

help! I want to make a huge tray of this french toast for a post wedding brunch. Do I have to allot more time to cook a bigger tray? I am thinking of using a 20 x 30 inch tray. Will 30 min still be enough or should I double the time??

I've made this several times. It is excellent as-is, but I also just use plain sliced whole wheat bread with great results. I use two-slices thick, and often put jam or other fillings between teh slices. I have used milk instead of half-and-half and the result is still fabulous. I often use orange zest in lieu of grand marnier and it always is wonderful. I don't find the dish needs to sit overnight - an hour or two is plenty for all the custard to be absorbed.

Ok Im givving this 5 stars , But iam am warning those who dont like a lot of attention ..dont make this ,, I have made it for 3 events and Im almost embarrassed with the remarks oh she is amazing did you taste the french toast? who made the french toast? always the hit , I might just make eggs next time to not be a superstar! its easy and amazing Make your momma proud and make this I use texas toast or thick sliced french toast bread I double the recipe and use an 11x16 aluminum pan. easy:}

I have been making this dish for years and it is always a favorite. In fact the reason I am here is because another friend asked for the recipe! I didn't read any of the other reviews, but when I make it I, up the Grand Marnier to 1 T, add another egg and use french bread since it makes perfect portion sizes. Love it!

I make this recipe frequently and it's one of our favorites. I typically just whip it up in the morning using King's Hawaiian Bread. That bread is so soft that you wouldn't want to soak it overnight (it would just dissolve into mush). So I just make the "brulee", add it to the pan, place my bread slices on top, whip up the egg mixture, pour it over the top, and put it straight in the oven. Works great every time and I can have breakfast on the table in under an hour (the longest time is the cooking time!). I have a couple of variations I like to use with it. One is to cut up thin slices of banana and line my pan with the banana slices before I add the "brulee" mixture. Then I just add in the bread and egg mixture and bake. When I take them out, I flip over the slices and serve the brulee side up with the pieces of banana stuck to the top. Yummy! We also make this with "drunken strawberries" in the spring (fresh strawberries tossed with sugar and a generous splash of grand marnier). Delicious! I bet the other reviewers idea of apple would be great too! Just saute up apple slices in butter until they are semi-soft, line the pan with them, pour in the brulee mixture, add the bread and eggs, and bake. There are a lot of variations you can do with this recipe. It's also great served with a nice fruit salad.

I have tried quite a few french toast casserole recipes, and this one is simply the best. Everyone raves when I make it. I use a long loaf of french bread and it works fine. An important tip is to make sure you bake it long enough so that the top puffs and starts to brown, otherwise it will be mushy.

Delicious! Served this french toast for Christmas breakfast - rave reviews from the family! Was definitely rich, sweet -almost dessert like and an awesome treat for a special occassion. I left out the corn syrup b/c I didn't have any - didn't seem to affect it at all. I did flip the french toast over at the end of the cooking time and broiled the top gooey sugary side so it had a crisp top like creme brulee. Yummy!

This is our favorite special occasion and when we dont want to do crepe Sunday breakfast. I substitute drambuie or frangelico and sometimes even khalua for the grand marnier.

Very good breakfast dish. It is sweet (the name of the recipe should be your first clue). I would suggest serving it with something not sweet to round out the meal such as bacon or sausage.

My family loved this and the BONUS was that I didn't make it the night ahead plus baked it right after putting it together and it was still perfect. Spooned the egg mixture over tops of each bread a couple times before baking, so it could soak up more of it. Baked about 10 min. extra, till bread was browning nicely and middle was done. Doubled the Grand Marnier....SIMPLY DELICIOUS!

Is this recipe lacking anything without the crunch of creme brulee? I was wondering if broiling sugar after the french toast was done would be a plus or a waste of time.

This recipe was the first time I made an overnight french toast recipe. It was easy to make and very tasty. I would recommend this recipe.

Made this for Christmas Eve breakfast and it was wonderful. I didn't have the grand marnier so substituted orange juice and zest. Also added a vanilla bean since I had them on hand. Could easily replace some of the half and half with milk and will do that again next time (there certainly will be a next time!). For the review that said the brown sugar hardened on the bottom of the pan, I was concerned about that but it didn't happen. I've made toffee many times, however, and those are key ingredients: butter, brown sugar and corn syrup. Be sure not to boil the mixture and be sure the dish is in the middle of the oven and not too close to the heat source. Can't imagine why else that would happen. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

This one gets rave reviews! Goes great with a salty breakfast egg bake. I like to make this one with things already in my cupboard. I use salted butter, regular syrup in place of corn syrup, sourdough bakery bread or wheat or raisin, mexican vanilla, and amaretto in place of the grand marnier for a hint of a buttery almond flavor. I've shared this recipe with so many people & they love how easy it is to make a delicious one of a kind dish!

so great! halved it but then had a slightly bigger pan than I thought, so I used 3 eggs and 1 cup half and half. discovered we didn't have grand marnier so used amaretto. wouldn't have thought the end result would be as terrific as it was! can't wait to make the full recipe for more guests next time.

You kind of have to be a fan of bread pudding to like this. The contrast between the crisp, golden brown top crust and the very creamy inside is lovely. I added a touch more half and half and didn't have any problems with dryness. Used Portuguese bread, which was a great choice. Also used blackberry liquer instead of Grand Mariner. In retrospect, though it tasted great, I think it made it taste more like a dessert than a breakfast dish.

Rating: 4
Just another rave review. I used regular butter and FF half&half with excellent results. I halved the recipe and had none of the problems mentioned, sticking, overly sweet, etc. The result was a nicely browned and puffed French toast. One thing I may do in the future is cut the bread 1 1/2" thick and leave the crusts on.

Rating: 4
I've made this half a dozen times, and have this caveat - if you are going to double the amount of bread - then MORE than double the rest of the recipe. Go to 2.5 for the bottom, and at least that for the egg mixture. A huge hit, and always requested by overnight guests - making it together the night before is always fun.

Rating: 3
Tasted Good, but the carmel creme Brulle bottom hardened very quickly and was difficult to eat after sitting for only 10 minutes. I did not grease the pan? Perhaps that would help. I'll try to grease the pan and perhaps pour that sugar 1/2 way through baking next time.

regular french toast will never be the same after this. outstanding. i have made it twice and the second time i needed a bit more, so i split the sugar mixture with 2/3 in the 13x9 and 1/3 in a small pie dish, made 1.5x the egg mixture and split that by 2/3 and 1/3 and it still came out great. i highly recommend making it the night before and letting it marinate in the fridge.

This was so good. I didn't need as much as the recipe made so I used a 6" round of sourdough bread, 3 eggs and cut the other ingredients in half. I also used fat free 1/2 & 1/2. I baked in a 9" square pan. It came out great.

In fact, half and half is not half milk and half cream. It is closer to 10-12% milk fat. Cream has about 30-40% milkfat. If you mix half whole milk (5% fat) and half cream (say yours has 30% milk fat) you will have a mixture about 17.5% milk fat. You can use just 1/3 cream and 2/3 milk.

I have made this twice in the past 2 weeks and everyone loved it. I made a few adjustments, as we all do. I used Hawaiian Sweet Rolls. The package holds 12 but really it takes 15 to fill up a 9 x 13 pan. I skipped the corn syrup-too sweet. I halved the butter, just too much (and I love butter). Once you have all the ingredients in the pan you need to push down the rolls or bread so that they really soak up all those lovely ingredients. Then just bake it in the morning. Very good!

I did not like this recipe. It was way too sweet, had an unappealing color, and all I could taste was brown sugar. Waste of good Grand Marnier.

This is a delicious and rich breakfast item that comes together easily with a little planning. I did make a few adjustments: used challah as suggested in some of the other reviews, did not add the corn syrup (and did not miss it at all), used salted butter and added a pinch of salt to the brown sugar mixture, and added a bit more Grand Marnier and some orange zest to the egg. mixture. I think it is important to let the bread get a bit stale, put the bread in over the still hot sugar mixture, pack the bread tightly into the pan so it really soaks up the egg mixture, make sure to let it come to room temperature before baking, and bake it til the top is browned. It was sweet and rich and worth making for special occasions.

I used a whole loaf of challah which I allowed to sit out overnight on the counter to dry out. I added one extra egg and reduced half and half by a 1/4 cup as suggested by others. Used recommended amount of Grand Marnier but plan to triple the next time. Perfect dish for weekend guests and so easy. Everyone emailed and requested the recipe. Serve with apple sausage breakfast links.

I prefer these cut into smaller pieces and served as part of a brunch. For me, it's too sweet as a main course. I've used many kinds of bread, including Challah, bagette, and Texas Toast and it's always great. An extra egg is helpful if your bread is particularly soft.

Rating: 0
For a full loaf of challah, crusts on and sliced about 1" thick, I made 1 1/2x both the custard base and the caramel base, doubled grand marnier and vanilla, and substitutied maple syrup (med. amber) for corn syrup, and used a total of 7 eggs. Set up and let soak overnight. Baked as directed in two pans: 7X11 and 9x13. Let cool for 5 minutes then inverted onto oven proof dish and popped under broiler for 5 minutes. PERFECT. Not soggy, not too sweet, not too dry, just PERFECTION. Raves from all and demands for recipe.

Along with everyone else, I completely agree the taste of this is fabulous. I took the advice of others, and used the Challah bread which was perfect..

Threw this together at 4pm on Christmas Eve just before running out the door. It made Christmas morning breakfast a breeze. I used a loaf of Brioche bread from Trader Joe's and used a larger than listed pan (a 16x13 porcelain roasting pan). I doubled the custard recipe, 1 & 1/2 the bread, and doubled the caramel/sugar base, though in hindsight the caramel base could have been 1 & 1/2 the recipe and been perfect. Also, I replaced the Grand Marnier with it's less expensive cousin, Triple Sec. Everyone loved the flavor and consistency. It's very rich and everyone had just one piece (except for my french toast loving dad who had 3). It's a great make ahead dish and you don't need butter, syrup or preserves to top it...it's all baked within.

This is basically pain perdue, a french dish made to put stale bread to use. It's delicious, like a cross between bread pudding and french toast. I've made it many times. Delicious and always a crowd pleaser. I top it with macerated sliced strawberries.

I made this for Father's Day for my husband. He likened it to bread pudding. It was good, but not quite as good as I'd hoped based on the reviews. I used country French bread.

Honestly, the BEST baked french toast, EVER! A family friend of mine made it for brunch one time so I called her for the recipe b/c I loved it so much, that I wanted to make it for Mother's Day. Easy to make (I actually came home from a wedding that night (drunk) and prepared the "creme brulee" mixture so it could soak overnight)! I only used Challah bread, it's the best for French Toast. If that is not available, I would recommend brioche. I didn't use the Grand Marnier and added some cinnamon. I also poured pure Maple Syrup on top of casserole with 5 min left of baking. Of course, everyone loved it and it was a HUGE HIT! I would also recommend toping it with pecans right before baking!

Decadent and delicious! I made this for brunch for my friends today and it was a big hit. After reading other reviews, I doubled the butter/brown sugar base and added an exta egg. I used really good challah and cut it about 1 1/2 inches thicki and then into quarters to squeeze in the pan. After I put the syrup in, I laid a layer of thinly sliced granny smith apples before adding the bread squares. After the first thirty minutes, I turned up the oven to 375. This was unbelievable.

This is a new family favorite! I've made it a few times and it seems like the key is to get the bread in as tightly as possible (cutting slices to make it fit well). I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and you couldn't tell the difference. It is sweet, rich and completely satisfying!!!

Rating: 4
I have found that by adding one more egg and reducing the half and half to 1/2 cup that there is no sogginess to the french toast. In fact, I bake it covered and only uncover the last 5 minutes. Delicious

Allow me to be the 420th to review this. Really, the dish as is would be a three forker, but I see great possibilities with this recipe. I used a week-old challah loaf and after reading about 300 reviews, the most prevalent one was that the baking could not rid the sogginess. Being that my bread was plenty crusty, I heeded that idea, and poured over the egg/milk mixture 5 minutes before baking. It was fantastic, although still a little too soft for my taste. For those who don't have a broiler, I heavily recommend a torch if you want the crispness, otherwise, you'll get some at the edges and a pretty sticky sticky-bun -like toast. But imagine if you carmelized thin apple slices or almond silvers with the sugar/butter mixture - divine.

One more thing. I also use honey instead of corn syrup. I cut the amount roughly in half. Seems to do the trick.

Rating: 4
This always gets rave reviews. I usually use a bagette. I cut the pieces and leave them out for awhile so they get a little stale. I find that makes the final product less mushy. I use Frangelico instead or GM. Other than that I make it as is.

Great recipe! Made it last night, left it in the fridge and put it in the oven this morning... so easy. I used half real eggs and half fake eggs (the low-cal carton ones,)and fat-free half and half, and it turned out great. Like others, I substituted maple syrup for the corn syrup. I brought the syrup to the table to pass around, which made it so yummy!! Definitely use Challah bread - it makes the recipe.

I made this as is, using challah which always makes the best French toast. While I liked it, I didn't love it, having had better made both on top of the stove and in the oven. Found the title very misleading as "Creme Brulee" typically is made with heavy cream and egg yolks with a crispy topping.

What an easy and delicious special-occasion breakfast/brunch dish. It's all done the night before, to be baked in the a.m. It looks great coming out of the oven, and the crowd oohs and ahs, even more when they taste it. I doubled the recipe, to serve a crowd of 11, and so made it in two dishes. The smaller dish, with the bread squeezed closer together, came out better, both in puffy appearance and taste. I used excellent, somewhat dense, bakery challah, with crusts on, sliced thick, and it was a huge hit. This also would be easy to bring along to someone else's home, to be popped in the oven and baked there.

I had such high hopes for this recipe and I was disappointed. None of my guests finished theirs, probably because it was just too mushy and sweet. The grand ma flavor wasn't strong enough and it seemed like more of a bread pudding than anything else. If I want a make-ahead brunch solution I'll stck to sausage and grits casserole.

This is the absolute best French Toast I have ever had. This recipe also ranks as the easiest one I've ever followed. I used challah and double the vanilla, since I didn't have Grand Marnier. There is no need for extras (syrup, butter, sugar, etc.). Yum!!!

Challa bread really is the best way to go for this. This is the perfect sweet component for any brunch. All of the assembly is done the day before so you just have to stick it in the oven. This makes brunch "Easy Like Sunday Morning!"

I made this dish for my wife on our anniversary over a year ago. She still can't stop talking about it. In fact, she's talked about it so much that our friends have requested that we host a brunch at our house where this dish is a must. I guess she liked it. However, because of the richness of this dish, I'm only allowed to prepare it no more than twice a year and only on special occaisions.

This has become a requirement prior to opening presents on Christmas morning.

This is an annual requirement at the Christmas brunch we have every year in my neighborhood. I have been warned that no one will allow me into the designated brunch house unless they can see that i have made this once again. I always add thin sliced apple and pecans then the butter mixture. And i always make them in single serving ramikins (sp?) which is a really good idea if you don't want to make an entire pan and a great tip if you want control over how each portion will come out too. My kids tell me i rock every time this gets made at my house!

Rating: 3
Made the recipe but with croissants instead of challah, b/c the local market ran out. It was very decadent, though not custardy enough b/c the croissants seem to have soaked up a lot more liquid than anticipated by the recipe. Next time I will add more of the custard mixture, which will probably make it puff up more and have a softer texture.

How do I add another fork to the rating? I've made this so many times, and each time such a hit. Even those without the wonderful sweet tooth like this. I've just prepared it for our quilters' Christmas party. They've heard me speak of it so often, it was demanded! Brioche used, and roughly chopped almonds in the butter mix. It's one of my all time favourite recipes.

When there are 379 reviews of a recipe with a 90% remake on it, it has to be great!!! I have made this 5 times now and each time, it is totally demolished and I have to pass the recipe out. It is the star of any brunch----but I always serve it with a glazed ham or sliced room temp filet, with a green salad and a fruit offering to help off set the sweetness. This is truly a recipe for the ages, one to hand on to your daughters, and the one that you will be remembered for long after you are gone!! Try it, you'll love it!!

We found this to be far too sweet - really a dessert, not breakfast. I also would not recommend flipping and broiling at the end (as recommended in other reviews) as it made the top far too hard and chewy. It is NOT like the crisp top of creme brulee! I couldn't even finish one piece, but if you like super sweet stuff - go for it.

I have made this for several years, once for 70 people. If made correctly, it is heaven and everyone will want the recipe. Key is to saturate the bread. I sometimes have to double the liquid ingredients depending on how much the type of bread absorbs. I use a heavy bagette with crust on and slice a nice fat consistent slice. One has to have the bread sliced and ready to press into the brulee coating as soon as you put it the pan, before it cools. The bread must absorb the brown sugar mixture immediately. I sub OJ for the GM. Make sure you bring the French Toast to room temp before putting it in the oven and it is only done when it puffs. I want to go make it now just thinking about it.

One of the best dishes I have ever made--people rave about it and beg for the recipe. I follow the directions as they appear, no changes.

Rating: 3
This dish is a good idea, but doesn't really deliver as written. A- Creme Brulee is not made with half & half, it is made with cream, so this is not as rich as it implies. B- The egg:milk ratio is all wrong. As written, the milk is all soaked up by the bread overnight, and no amount of cooking is going to firm that back up (short of breaking a tooth), especially with the crusts removed. C- Corn syrup is not an ingredient that I choose to eat. I subbed 1 Tbs Honey and 1 Tbs Molasses to accomplish a similar texture. My final recipe (after experimenting several times with this) wound up with almost an entire loaf of sourdough cubed (with crusts), and twice the number of eggs, along with 1/2 a cup of pecans on the bottom, and another 1/2 cup mixed with the bread (keeping the rest of the recipe the same). This made more of a sticky bun bread pudding, but it was quite delicious.

A keeper for sure - had some trouble flipping the toast to broil the underside, as recommended by other reviews. Stuck to the pan and sorta ripped. Appearances didn't matter though, served it for my 16 yr old son's friends & they GOBBLED it up!

Yum! I really liked this. I've tried other baked/stuffed french toast recipes and found them too sweet. I made it just as the recipe states and it was a big hit.

Don't tell anyone, but I think I might eat a leftover piece for dinner tonight!

This was one heck of a crowd pleaser! I was bored and strolling recipes at 2 in the morning and I saw this one and noticed you had to make it in advanced. So that is just what I did. I used orange zest instead of grand marnier considering I don't have any, and it was still very delicious. I didn't feel the dish was sweet enough and I didn't want to use old fashion maple syrup so I made a sweet strawberry compote made of mostly sugar and over ripe strawberries. I put about a tablespoon of milk and a tablespoon of corn syrup, along with a squeeze of fresh orange. I put it in a pan on the stove and brought it up to boil and let it thicken. The strawberry compote really complimented the dish very nicely.

Rating: 4
I followed other suggestions listed and used challah bread with crusts intact, 2% milk instead of half and half, orange juice instead of Grand Marnier (since I don't have it in the house) and flipped the toast after baking and broiled until caramelized. This was so delicious! Our guests were impressed! Served with blueberries and bacon. Also, I think this is a pretty decadent breakfast, so the 2% milk helps a little in cutting the fat without hurting the taste.

I've been eyeing this recipe for a couple of years and finally decided to make it yesterday for my family. It was wonderful. I took some of the other reviewers' suggestions and used challah bread (with crusts left on), cream instead of half and half, and orange zest instead of Grand Marnier. I was concerned this dish was going to be too sweet, but we all agreed it was just right. I plan on making this again when we have family and friends over for brunch.

I used challah bread and cut the crusts off half the slices so I could compare. It is definitely bette WITH the crusts (in my opinion) because they get crispy and taste great. Also tried flipping and broiling brown sugar for a few minutes - that made it 10 times better. This is an easy dish to make, especially preparing the night before. It's delicious - my 8-month pregnant wife just devoured 3 pieces and she's not a big eater. The suggestion to have a salty companion (bacon, eggs,etc.) is a good one. This dish is very sweet and very rich.

I loved this french toast but as my honey and I are on very restricted diets I had to tone it down some. I used fat free half and half, egg substitue, and decreased the amts. of butter and brown sugar. I added more Grand Marnier and cinnamon and nutmeg. Cooked it at 400 in a glass dish, for 40 min. Wasn't soggy at all. No one else was dieting, but everyone loved it! Served it with fresh fruit salad and bacon. We ate it all!

Rating: 3
I made the recipe as-is, with exception to doubling the Grand Marnier amount. Next time, I would use a Tablespoon of Grand Marnier, as with 2 teaspoons I couldn't even detect the slightest orange flavor. I wouldn't bother doubling the brown sugar amount, as many have suggested. It is definitely sweet and gooey enough with the amount given in the recipe. Also, as this sits out, the sugar/syrup mixture sets and becomes hard. Rough on the teeth, but still delicious!

This is amazing!! I've used both challah and Hawaiian sweet bread and like the challah more. Make the slices nice and thick. My husband, who usually doesn't like sweet stuff for breakfast loved this! So easy to prepare and I've already had 3 people ask me for the recipe. Will try with fat free half and half next time.

I guess this was a huge hit for last mother's Day (2003) because all the Mom's and Grandma's have asked me to make it again for this Mother's Day (2004). I am going to follow the suggestions and double the brown sugar and flip it over and place under a broiler.

Oh-My-God this is so good. Actually it's outstanding. I have made it twice - the first time using the recipe and the second doubling the brown sugar, corn syrup, and butter.

Fantastic special occasion breakfast food. It is very sweet, so a small portion is in order. Therefore, I serve it with something else such as an egg/sausage breakfast casserole or scrambled eggs and bacon. The french toast is more of an accent and the sweet/salty combo works well. It also reheats well, taking individual potions wrapped in foil and placed in toaster oven.

I made this with a rather stale, sliced baguette and it was amazing! It was a slightly crispy on top, with a fabulously tender, creme brulee-flavored bottom.

Misread the directions and didn't mix in brown sugar with the butter at first, didn't even HAVE brown sugar, so I added white sugar to the egg mixture and poured it over top. Placed baguette slices in the pan too tightly, so I flipped them all over before baking to make sure they soaked up enough egg mixture. All these changes, and it was STILL delicious. I especially liked the crusts on the baguettes.

A mushy disaster for Easter morning!! The recipe was waaaaay to sweet - more like eating a very mushy sticky bun. Would not recommend it to anyone except maybe for a child, but even then it was so mushy I don't think a child would touch it!

Fatastic! I made this for the first time for my "Mommie - Baby" play group and the moms loved it! It was so easy to put together the night before and I baked it the next morning. I will make this again. Tip: use stonewear to bake this dish in. Since the stonewear stays warm it keeps the bottom layer nice and gooey. Not hard and stickey.

As a previous cook said, this recipe is practically fool-proof. I substituted orange oil for the Grand Marnier, and a loaf of Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Bread for the round country bread. Also, added a bit of cin and cardamon to the egg mixture. Excellent!! The three of us finished the entire dish n one sitting. Note: it does puff up quite a bit in the oven, but don't freak out- it will settle as soon as you cut into it.

Rating: 3
Practically goof-proof! While cooking the syrup, I accidentally got distracted watching "A Christmas Story" and cooked the syrup to almost the hard-ball stage; then added too much whipping cream while Ralphie was shooting his eye out. Never-the-less I added a couple extra splashes of Grand Marnier for good luck and popped it in the oven the next morning. My husband loved it, but I thought it was too custardy (hmmm, I wonder if it was anything I did???). However, the next day it was too die for! I'll be making it again - just to see how it is per the directions. Oh, I used Challah.

This is by far one of the best breakfast casserole dishes!! I have been making this absolutely, heavenly dish for a few years now. Every time I serve this I receive rave reviews from every single person who tastes it. It is fantastic because you prepare it ahead of time and simply bake it the next day for breakfast or brunch. People think you slaved over this gourmet dish for hours. One of my favorite recipes from this website!!! Thanks again!!

This french toast is sensational! You couldn't ask for a more perfect brunch dish - very easy to make and I like the fact that it bakes in the oven. I didn't have any Grand Marnier, so I substituted a quarter teaspoon of orange extract. Yum.

I made this (last night) for brunch this morning and it was quite a hit! I used a french baguette with the crust left on and the texture was just right. I was a little worried when I finished the prep work because the bread seemed to be drowning in the egg mixture, but after chilling overnight and then baking, it turned out perfect! (Sigh of relief!) Easiest breakfast that I've ever made and wonderful taste!

This is the best entertaining breakfast you can serve. You prepare it all before the guests arrive and the next day, you get up, put it in the oven -- and serve with NO EFFORT. I leave the crusts on the bread and it still fabulous and I also skip the GM liquor. You don't need it if you don't want it... Plus, I have always gotten rave reviews!

I make this french toast for every family brunch and they all look forward to it. Recently, I made it for a football game tailgate party and all of our friends raaaved about how delicious it is. What I love about it, is how easy it is to make. I use a french baguette, because the pieces are smaller,and it seems to work better for a brunch. I've used the challah bread before, as well, and that tastes delicious, too.

I made this for brunch for a group of friends and not only did they love it, but it was super easy since I made it the night before and popped it in the oven while I made the rest of the food. I used day-old croissants that I split in 2, and instead of Grand Marnier (a couple guests hate any alcohol whatsoever) I grated some zest into the egg mixture. It was really delicious.

Very good french toast recipe and a breeze to make. I took it for a brunch potluck at work where it was quickly gobbled up.

This one's worth five forks!! My husband loves this recipe. He took the leftovers to work and they gobbled it up just as it was. I add nutmeg and cinnamon to the half-and-half mixture, and I use 2-3 teaspoons of vanilla instead of the Grand Marnier. I also tried it with the Hawaiian sweet bread. It's delicious if you can take the sweetness! I have an extremely sweet tooth, so I'm on cloud nine when I eat this. I did try doubling the brown sugar mixture--although it was delicious in taste, the extra syrup overwhelmed the custard--which is my favorite part. You can also add some chopped pecans to the brown sugar mixture. I would definitely make this one again and again!!

Everyone loved it (including me, and I don't have a sweet tooth); great presentation; easy, easy, easy! What a combo! I doubled the custard and left out about a third of the syrup.

This was great! I prepared it last night and made it for the kids and I this Mom's Day morning. I used sourdough and heavy whipping cream, as sourdough is our favorite for French Toast and whipping cream gives it a thicker custard texture. I also broiled it the last 2 minutes of the baking time, which gave it a nice crust. Cutting smaller pieces of bread to fill in the "open spaces" allowed the bread to "fluff up" a bit better. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 2
It was OK, easy to make the night before. Very nice to enjoy our company and not worry about making breakfast. But...it was only OK, perhaps the bread I used (Italian - all I could find the night before), was not quite right for this dish. My husband liked it, I thought it was OK. Might give this dish a second chance.

I make something very much like this for our B&B although I just use whole wheat Wonder and haven't tried the Grand Marnier (I will now though) but people love it. We top it with a dollop of sour cream and strawberry Preserves (smucker's less sugar type is fine). It's certainly easy and a good make-ahead dish.

Rating: 4
This is a favorite dish I've made over and over, always to raves! I did modify it, however. I use raisin bread, crust on. If it's pre-sliced, I layer the whole loaf in there (except the ends). Also, I omit the corn syrup, and double the custard. And when I serve it, I flip the pieces over to get the yummy syrupy stuff on top. I usually serve it with herbed scrambled eggs and fresh berries on the side. Always a winner!

I made this for Easter brunch for my husband and my parents. Everyone loved it and I couldn't believe how easy it was.

I made this last easter & my whole family inlcuding my Mom requested it again this year. I use a large lasagne pan, make one recipe of the sticky stuff, then use 2 layers of sliced sweet bread for the top and two recipes of egg mixture. It makes a nice high, fluffy base and the sweet topping is wonderful without overwhelming the custardy/bread base.

Have made this repeatedly to raves. I use French bread, and as with any "lost bread", it's better if you slice the bread the night before so it dries out a bit. Up the vanilla and Grand Marinier just a little and add some orange zest. Flip slices over to serve and drizle some carmel on the plate. Not necessary to let it sit over night but do give it time to soak up, as you would with bread pudding.

I made this dish for Sunday brunch over the weekend; what a hit! I am certain that I saw tongue prints on the dishes.

A friend of mine suggested I make this for Christmas morning breakfast and I thought it was amazing!I used Challah but agree on doubling the sauce recipe next time. A good idea to invert it onto a plate when it comes out of the oven so the syrup coats the bread more evenly. This is a winner!

Served this as one of the choices for a Christmas Brunch for 30. I left out the syrup, used Challah bread, and left the crusts on. I used an oversized 10X13 glass dish and almost doubled the sauce. I turned it upside down as soon as it came out of the oven. It was wonderful.

I've made this several times and my family adores it. For Christmas morning this year I made it with a round loaf of Cinnaburst bread from our local bakery. It's a dense white bread with cinnamon-sugar bits scattered throughout -- great stuff! I squeeze full slices of bread into the pan and then fill the spaces with cubes of bread so that the entire pan is covered. This time I made it with fat-free half-and-half, because that's what was in the fridge, and it was wonderful. Flipped it out onto a baking sheet to serve and everyone was happy, happy, happy to borrow a phrase from Emeril!

I don't know what happened down in Florida, but up here this dish was great! Easy and good tasting. I was surprised how filling it is!

I'll serve this again and again just as the recipe is written.

Yuck--After reading the reviews I was excited to make this dish. The brown sugar made a sticky gross - mess. Many people took servings of this dish, but most of it ended up coming back with the dirty plate. Make real fried french toast-don't waste time and money with this one.

This was very, very good. I took it to a Sunday School Christmas Brunch, and it wasn't gobbled up, but I think that was becuase there was a ton of food and the presentation isn't superb. My husband and I loved it. Those that did eat it made a point of telling me how much they liked it, and I was asked for recipie. Next time, I think I will use cinammon swirl bread and find a way to dress up the top...powdered sugar, berries...something. I used one loaf of callah bread...wasn't enough, so I had to put in a 11X7 pan, which worked out great. Oh..I almost forgot... I used rum instead of Grand Marnier and it was heavenly! Next time, I'll add more.

Very rich and delicious! I made the mistake of not reading ahead the first time I made it and was caught unawares by the "Chill 8 hours" part of it . . . had to provide our guests something else for brunch that day. Ooops!

I have finally found the ultimate french toast recipe! I used a french baguette as the recipe also suggests and it turned out great. The creme brulee is so tasty and impressive, your guests will think you spent HOURS on the preparation. 15 minutes of prep time the night before and it's ready to go in the oven the next morning. I too served upside down but thought it looked better the other way. Try decorating with berries!

Soggy? I found this dish to be quite delicious and definitely resembled creme brulee. I think the cooks who ended up with soggy french toast need to invest in an oven thermometer and also make sure that they cut the bread to the correct thickness. I found that Challah bread is the best bread to use for this recipe.

This recipe was amazing. I made it without the Grand Marnier and didn't miss it at all. The egg mixture makes a wonderful and decadent flan-like custard and the toast just melts in your mouth.

We've made this dish twice now. It is So easy-just a few minutes effort the night before and in the a.m., pop it in the oven. This is a genuine B&B recipe or so it seems.

LOVED it! The caramel sauce was scrumptious! I took the advice of another reviewer and turned it out immediately after being removed from the oven -- excellent choice.

I made this for a big brunch. It was the hit of the party. I've given out this url to a lot of people. I didn't use the Grand Marnier--didn't have any on hand and didn't want to buy a bottle just for a teaspoon. (Plus I don't think a teaspoon would affect the flavor much--if I was going to use it I'd reduce the amount of half and half and put in a good 1/4 cup or more of Grand Marnier so it could really be tasted.) Also I used Challah bread and it was fantastic in it.

I made this recipe for Mother's Day brunch and it was a big hit with everyone. I used a baguette and left the crusts on, and it was absolutely fabulous. I served them straight from the oven, and when you turn them upside-down they look just beautiful. Sort of like a cross between french toast and carmel rolls. I doubled the recipe, but instead of the ten eggs I would have used, I used seven. I was afraid of it being too "custardy". I'd do it just the same way again. I served it with the sausage-potato breakfast casserole, and they complimented each other very nicely.

I made this recipe over the weekend for house guests. Used my own baked (bread machine) raisin challah. Also substituted non-fat half and half and used egg substitute for two of the five eggs. It was delicious!!! Only modification I would make would be to increase the amount of Grand Marnier.

I have to say that this was the best French Toast that I have ever tasted. I used fresh french bread with the crusts still on it instead. I loved the texture and rich custard flavor that the bread took on. The "Cream Brulee" crust was definatly the winning point with me. This was very easy to make. I can't wait to pass this recipe on to my mom.

This is one of those recipes that makes people think your a good cook. Extremely easy and elegant. I have made this for every single Holiday when I know I'm spending most of the day in the kitchen. I prepare this the night before and when the family comes down to breakfast it's already cooking. It smells so good and my children are building memories of mom puttering around the kitchen Holiday mornings preparing a special breakfast just for them. I have passed out this one recipe to more people than any other recipe I own. Definitely one to be passed down as a family tradition.

At the risk of turning the wrath this site generates my way I will wade in with my variation. Used fat free cream [LandOLakes makes it]1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp Cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. Alspice, and 2 tablespoons of Triple Sec. I was in a time crunch when I made this so cut the bread[I too vote for raisin Challah]in big chunks and let it soak in the egg mixture while I made the brown sugar stuff for the bottom of the pan. Worked fine and we loved it. It was even great the next day heated up. It is sweet and needs nothing but fresh fruit. We used strawberries but can't wait for fresh peaches and blueberries macerated in Amaretto.

I thought this recipe was wonderful!! It is very rich (just like Creme Brulee!) so I served it with fresh strawberries, and cafe au lait. I might use one less egg next time though, it had a slight 'egg-y' flavor, and a tsp. more Grand Marnier. Yum!

I took this to an Easter Brunch and everyone loved it. I have already had several requests for the recipe.

I made this over the weekend expecting to be bowled over based upon the previous reviews, but neither my husband nor I was overwhelmed. It was good but certainly not outstanding relative to many other recipes I've tried. Based upon the reference to creme brulee, I expected the topping to be firm and crispy rather than soggy as it turned out. It was certainly edible but definitely disappointing. There are so many other better recipes out there that I won't bother with this one again.

Made this recipie for Easter brunch and it was a huge hit! I used egg Challah bread that I purchased from a gourmet market (Bristol Farms)and it was excellent. I baked the bread with crushed pecans on top and prior to serving I lightly dusted powdered sugar over it, which was a nice effect. Next time I will experiment with the raisin walnut challah bread the market also carries. I can't wait to make this again. It was so easy!

This recipe is simple and impressive! I crave the flavor of the rich egg soaked bread (I agree challah is the best). Your guests will want the recipe!

I first made this recipe for my husband's family to break the fast on Yom Kipper, a Jewish holiday whereby dairy dishes are served at dinnertime. It was such an overwhelming hit, I added it to my Christmas breakfast menu as well. Since then it's become an annual tradition at both holiday meals, and everyone who's tried it has asked for the recipe! I use Challah (my own) and cut off the crust. Simply delicious!

This is a great dish for company. It's so handy to make it the day before. I've made it several times and have never had a "soggy" problem. I use grocery store french bread and slice it very think; I even slice off the crusts. I've also added raisins. It's great with a side of bacon and fruit salad!

I've made this a couple of times with french bread and thick white bread. The more dense the bread, the better. The french bread turned out very mushy, but still had good flavor.

Suggestion for everyone complaining about bread being soggy, use challah bread and leave the crust on. Made this three times already and the greatest thing is you prepare it the night before so just pop in the oven first thing in the morning before your guests arrive! I'm always asked to make this whenever I host a brunch!

My brunch guests all raved about this recipe, but I personally thought it was so-so. I followed the directions to the letter, but my toast ended up a little on the soggy side. I have to agree with the reviewer who said she couldn't see how this can be labeled "creme brulee." I won't be making this again.

Very easy and convenient when you have overnight guests. Wonderful flavor! I will add cinnamon to the brown sugar/syrup mixture next time!

It's the type of bread you use that makes the difference. I used a really good Challah from the bakery and the results are entirely different than using regular bread. It makes for a more creamy texture. That along with the grand marnier, YUM!

It takes a big stretch of the imagination to label this "creme brule", with implications of creamy custard. Family and guests felt it was nothing more than basic overnight french toast, and not something to rave about.

Rating: 2
It tasted just ok, no big deal. Easy to make, looks good, but the flavour is not so amazing as I thought it would be, considering all the rave reviews. Id much rather follow my traditional french toast recipe, and serve them with maple syrup. And it does not tastes at all like real creme brulee, actually.

THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLY DEEEELICIOUS! THROUGH IN SOME GOLDEN RAISINS, SLIGHTLY CRUSHED PECANS WHICH ADDED EVEN EXTRA FLAVOR AND ADDED SOME CINNAMON SUGAR ON TOP DURING THE LAST FIVE MINS OF BAKING -- IT'S A GREAT DISH TO MAKE THE NIGHT BEFORE WHEN YOU HAVE OVERNIGHT COMPANY. I USED PLAIN OLD WHITE SANDWICH BREAD WHICH TOOK NOTHING AWAY FROM THIS DIVINE RECIPE. I ALSO FRIED UP SOME BACON TO ACCOMPANY IT AND IT WAS A SUPER HIT. RICH, INDEED, BUT WORTH EVERY CALORIE. NOTE: FREEZES WELL. AFTER FREEZING, POP IT INTO THE OVEN FROZEN (DO NOT THAW) AND YOU HAVE YET ANOTHER FABU BREAKFAST/BRUNCH!!!!

Rating: 4
This recipe is great: Easy-to-make, can be prepared ahead, and most delicious! I recommend turning the baking dish upside down onto a cookie sheet before serving. This allows all the syrup to seep into the bread, and then you can soak the dish while everyone is eating. I also recommend using a tougher bread, like Rustic Italian, for great texture. I will definitely make this one again!

Rating: 4
I made this for a family brunch and it is delicious. You have to make sure your bread is firm so it doesn't get too soggy. Also, some of the sauce stayed in the bottom of the pan, so mine wasn't overly sweet as some people have said. However, I was able to scoop some sauce out and drizzled it on top for those that like more sweetness.

Rating: 3
This turned out wonderfully. It is rich and rather sweet, but I think it works very well as long as that is the effect that you are going for. I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazingly easy to put together - it took about ten minutes the night before and a little bit longer than the recipe called for in the oven.

I've made this twice now, but the first time, my husband put it in the oven by mistake the evening I made it, so it baked for a while covered, and then finished in the morning as instructed. My kids thought it was fantastic, so I repeated it (as written!). The kids didn't like it as much, pronouncing it too "mushy" and "eggy". I think it's OK, and would do for a plan ahead kind of meal, but it's not spectacular. Maybe with the apples mentioned by other reviewers, and baking longer to firm up the bread a little (and yes, I did leave the crusts on)

I knew this needed some spice, so I sprinkled on nutmeg and cinnamon before baking. I used French bread and left the crust on. I believe this made it less soggy. My friends liked it and asked for the recipe. (One made the recipe above and then called because she was disappointed.) I think it was too sweet, so next time I will reduce the corn sweetener a bit and possibly replace it with orange juice.

Mine was definitely not soggy. I used Italian Pugliese and it had a nice crisp top and the bread remained chewy. I used 1/2 cup whipping cream and cup of non-fat milk. (no 1/2 & 1/2 on hand)and I omitted the corn syrup. It did not taste exceptionally "rich" either. I enjoyed this recipe but it was a bit sweet. I think Cinnamon and nuts or apples for next time would be nice to cut the pure sugar flavor--or I would reduce the caramel amount. I would not think of this for a substitute for french toast (misses the grilled flavor) but as a nice custard flovored sticky bun treat. It is very! nice to be able to prepare the night before. I would also make this my only sweet dish. Fresh fruit and salty bacon compliment nicely.

I first served this for New Year's Day breakfast, and we all loved it. To the Atlanta cook who got a eggy, custardy layer on the bottom, my suggestion is that you make sure the butter-sugar layer is still warm when you add the bread, so that the bread soaks up the layer, then let it cool, so it sets. I left out the corn syrup. It certainly doesn't need the extra sweetness.

This was absolutely worth making! The flavor was wonderful and very rich - you didn't even have to add syrup. I would make sure to leave the bread out a few days so that it dries well. Will defintely make again!

I must have done something wrong. Instead of a caramelized, "brulee" layer on the bottom, I ended up with an extremely eggy, custardy layer on the bottom. It tasted okay but not great.

This dish was very well received by friends (all demanded the recipe) and was easy to make. I made a few changes: I used Challah bread and left the crusts on. I used evaporated milk instead of cream, and replaced the Grand Marnier with Almond extract and a little almond coffee-flavoring syrup. Finally, I added some cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon to the egg mixture. I made it on a Friday morning and served Saturday morning and it baked up beautifully. I used more than six slices so maybe that is why it was not as soppy. It was crispy and delicious.

Rating: 4
I usually don't rate recipes a four, but here is why I did. This is possibly the easiest thing to prepare ahead for a brunch and your company will adore it. It looks really liquidy but it sops it right up in the oven. I used store bought challah. Be sure to get those pans into the sink for a soak because the brulee part on the bottom of the pan is like molten lava and when it starts to solidify it is not fooling around and may become a perminent fixture on the bottom of your pyrex. make homemade whip cream with a bit of grand marnietr and perhaps a bit of orance peel. Syrup is superfuous.

Dan and Cathy from Las Vegas: Great brunch idea to impress family and friends! Try it with egg bread instead of challah...And Amaretto instead of Grand Marnier...Tastes Great. I also put 1/4 tsp of cinnamon with butter/brown sugar/corn syrup mixture. Since the egg bread was sliced at 1/2 inch, I put down six pieces of bread...then 1/2 the egg mixture on top...then another six pieces and the rest of the egg mixture. It really puffed up high and tasted great!

This is a GREAT do ahead recipe. Perhaps the previous reviewer used bread that was not coarse enough to absorb the egg mixture. It takes 20 minutes to set up. I also add 1/4t of cinnamon to the brown sugar mix. My company, and my husband always raved about this french toast.

Good flavor, but way too soggy. I think next time, I'll make the soaking time much shorter - say, an hour tops. Not great for the make-ahead aspect of the recipe, but maybe it will turn out better that way.

I have made this recipe about 5 times since March of this year. Each time I make it, everyone raves. The best result has been with baguette bread and leaving the crust on. It gives it a wonderful texture and it looks beautiful on the buffet. It comes out really crisp on the top in a convection oven or a baking stone. Pecans give it a nice touch. I will make this everytime we have anybody over. I even make it for my mom when she has company too. It is incredibly easy and worth every bite. We never have any leftovers.

I've made several minor changes that have made this a hit for us, including reducing the calorie and fat factor (it still tastes really rich and satisfying). I use 2/3 stick butter, 2/3 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup maple syrup, and some cinnamon for the caramel; lay a layer of thinly-sliced (1/8-inch) apples between the caramel and the bread (I use challah with the crusts); and evaporated skim milk and egg substitute for the custard. The caramelized apples are perfect--like a tarte tatin for breakfast!

I LOVED this recipe! I changed a few things though. I left the crust on, omitted the corn syrup, and substituted the half & half for melted vanilla ice cream. I cooked it differently as well. Instead of only baking, I just dipped the bread into the egg mix & grilled in a skillet first, then spread the brown sugar & butter on both sides of the bread & baked until crispy. It tasted like praline french toast and was outstanding. My roommate & I almost died! I will definitely make this again. I recommend hot maple syrup & powdered sugar on top! Yummy!

Maybe I did something wrong, but I didn't really like this. It wasn't bad, just not great. I found it too sweet and I missed the toasted/fried taste that you get when you make regular french toast by cooking it on a griddle. On the other hand, my husband liked it a lot.

I used a baguette and left the crusts on, and only let it soak for a couple of hours. I also had to make my own corn syrup by boiling a TBSP of water with about four TBSNs of sugar (I didn't really measure that well, I just added more sugar if it looked too watery)! The result was incredible! I like the fact that the bread was not mushy, but still had wonderful texture because it did not soak for too long. I also substituted Amaretto for the Grand Mariner, but couldn't really taste it. The left-overs are sooo good! It is wonderful as a desert, and I will certainly make this again!

Rating: 3
I've made this recipe twice now. Challah bread without a doubt produces a better end result. The "round" bread tended to flatten out after some initial cooling. Leaving the bread ends intact adds structure to each slice and provides more complexity to the over all flavor. I would like to experiment a little more with the brown sugar bottom - I find it to be a little too chewy (adding chopped nuts is a nice touch).

Rating: 4
You need to try this one to appreciate why it is such a popular recipe in the "constant comment" category. True, while very decadent and chock full of ingredients that are high in fat, for that special occasion or holiday, it is worth putting the diet aside for a day. Great for brunches. Also, a special treat for Christmas morning. Indulge, and enjoy.

I thought this was delicious. It was very easy to make, despite having to prepare it ahead of time, I was very good. I don't know what people were saying about the bread being soggy, we used a loaf of french bread and the top was perfectly toasted to a lovely golden brown. It is very sweet though, so servingss need to be small. I would also cut make on the caramel in the bottom, it was a little too much.

As a 50+ year old male, my only Culinary endeavor prior to embarking on the Creme Brulee French Toast was "Oh, that's how you boil water!". Despite not being able to find "Round Bread", whatever that is, I substituted French Bread. Looked pretty ugly until the final baking stages. (Drove my wife crazy with "Would you look and tell me if it looks done yet?"). But got Rave reviews from the 5 folks in my extended and rather finicky family. And, going back later to see how the left-overs tasted cold, I found my kids had already finished it off. Will make it again as soon as I can figure out whether "round" is a shape or a type of bread.

Thought this was poor. Even though I used more bread than the recipe called for and baked it in the oven longer than the recommended time, it was soggy in texture and unappealing.

This has become my favorite brunch recipe! I have subsituted orange juice (1/4 cup) for the Grand Marnier with no noticeable difference. Most of my guests ask me to share the recipe with them. Challah is wonderful to use instead of the french bread.

I wasn't as "wowed" as I expected to be, but that may have been my fault-- I left the crusts on and my homemade challah was slightly burnt on the bottom. Also, again this could be my challah skills, I didn't feel that the eggs soaked into the bread the way i would have liked. But I was lazy about putting it away and had some at room temp and hour later (instead of from the oven) and that *was* everything I'd hoped, couldn't get enough of it. So, I suspect it is an amazing recipe and I intend to make it again this weekend-- with good bread this time. We used orange rind instead of Grand Marnier and that was fine.

My husband and I thought this was delicious. So simple to make and came out wonderfully. I used regular french bread (with crusts) and replace the half-n-half with 1/2 cup skim milk and 1 cup evaporated skim milk and it was still delicious. Can't wait to make it for company.

I thought this recipe would be too sweet (and was therefore concerned about what to serve with it) but it was perfect. I tried to cut some of the fat and calories by taking out three of the yokes, replacing half of the half and half with skim milk, and using light butter. It still cooked and tasted great. I served it with fresh berries and pureed some of the berries for a tart sauce. Next time I might reduce the brown sugar sauce to about 3/4 of what the recipe calls for. It was good, but there was more than enough of it.

I have a sweet tooth and am fine with rich food, but even for me, this was too sweet and decadent. The caramel stuck to my teeth and seemed too buttery. And the taste just wasn't that fantastic.

Next time, I'll make my usual french toast (french bread soaked in eggs, half & half, vanilla and cinnamon-sugar) this way.

I have made this a couple of times now, cutting a round half-inch slice from the centre of the loaf of bread and using an 8" or 9" cake pan.

yum! Very sweet and a huge hit with everyone for Easter brunch. We had four adults and two toddlers at the table but there wasn't nearly enough, even with a huge fruit salad on the side. Maybe we're just big eaters. (oink oink) Next time, I'll double the recipe, but only add a couple more eggs.

This dish is fun to make. I prepare it for my sister when she visits, and my son insists on having it when he has guests overnight.

This is one of the best baked french toast recipes I have encountered. I served it for Easter brunch and my guests raved. It is also great to be able to prepare it a day ahead and just pop it in the oven. I didn't see the need to bring it to room temperature first, and it came out great. Tip: I made a double batch and baked one in a glass dish and one in ceramic and the latter was creamier and more golden and attractive.

Made this for a sunday brunch -- the consensus among my friends and family was that this was the best french toast they'd ever had. I'd probably increase the amount of Grand Marnier next time, since its flavor was almost indiscernable after baking, but I have to say that the recipe is perfect just as it is. I like the idea of trying different breads and liquors -- maybe I'll try Frangelico next time. Yum!

I've made this a number of times and have always substituted any bread that appealed to me at the moment - from pear and hazelnut to pecan and raisin bread. Frequently don't bother to take off the crusts and still is wonderful. Have also added nuts to the brown sugar mixture in the bottom of the pan. I love the fact that it is put together the night before and everyone thinks it's great.

It's just plain delicious!!!! I've lightened up the recipe by replacing cream with condensed skim milk. It has become a mainstay whenever we have guests from out of town. So easy to make and just pop in the oven in the morning, then back to bed for 1/2 hour before rousing every one up!! (they think I've been up for hours preparing hee hee)

I've made this dish a few times and have always had success with it, from taste to texture. I like the idea of trying it with Kahlua as a reviewer suggested down below! I like substituting maple syrup for the corn syrup. I love the convenience of preparing this the night before.

I loved this recipe. Recently served it to a book club brunch. Got rave reviews, except two women who said they felt queasy after eating it. I think it was the mimosas and sausage. My guests left with me instead of the recipe.

This recipe is phenomenal - I have been serving it to guests and family since its publication in Gourmet in 1998, and all who have tried it left my house with the recipe in hand. I have cut the sugar a tiny bit, to suit my tastes, and made it with a lighter cream, with good results. In all the times I've made it, never has it turned out with an unappealing texture. My sister always requests it when she comes visiting!

Is everyone crazy? I made this recipe exactly as written, and: 1) it was not sweet at all. not caramel-y, not like creme brulee, not sweet!; 2) I agree, it was way too eggy, with weird almost custard/almost scrambled eggs in the corners; 3) it tasted exactly like regular, griddle-made french toast! I might make this again, but not in a hurry. And only make this if you want plain old french toast but want to use the oven. Boring!

If you don't like extremely sweet frech toast stay away from this one. Even though I followed the recipe to the letter, I found that the bread did not soak up all of the egg mixture and the remaining egg mixture baked around each piece of the creme brulee french toast in a manner similar to scrambled eggs - making it very unattractive. Don't make the same mistake I did - ensure you have almost no extra egg mixture in the pan before placing the dish in the oven.

Both my guests and I thought the Creme Brulee French Toast was exceptional. What was left over I froze and was able to enjoy at a later date. Thank you epicurious for sharing this recipe.

This dish was delicious! I made it for a brunch and both adults and children loved it. Easy to make and great because you make it the day before. My only complaint was the syrup was a little too sweet. Although my son loved it as he thought it was a caramel sauce. Another plus was that leftovers reheat well in the microwave the next day.

I found this french toast to be too eggy for my taste - and I had already reduced the number of eggs to four. The topping is a redeeming feature but still does not convince me to make this again.

This is actually easier to make than "standard" French toast. Very sweet, rich, and HEAVY. One slice is enough (almost more than enough) for anyone. I made this for my four roommates who are each picky in different ways, and this was the first recipe they have all asked for! Quick, easy, and delicious. Making it the night before is an added plus- you just pop it into the oven while you shower and it's ready when you are.

My husband and I did not like this recipe. The bread was far too soggy and sweet.

What a wonderful dish! Easy and Delicious! You don't need to eat with Syrup - it makes its own. This is definately a keeper. I made this dish using a homemade Country White Bread.

My husband and I loved it. He is one who thinks he doesn't like French toast. Simplicity itself to prepare, and that make-ahead aspect is so wonderful in the morning - just bake and eat. Next time, I'll try some of the Review suggestions, such as substituting maple syrup, Frangelico, and using pecans (my personal favorite.) I thought I might try a berry syrup, too, using the Grand Marnier with it, or some fruity liqueur. This is a recipe for which one feels like the Very Rich partaking of elegant fare for a leisurely breakfast (especially with Very Good tea or coffee.) Bravo!

I was amazed at how rich and custard-like the bread became overnight in the egg mixture. The brown sugar mixture made a wonderful "syrup" once it was baked and turned over onto a plate. I used a loaf of homemade challah to do this recipe, and that would be my suggestion for a bread choice in this recipe. If you need a challah recipe, check out Nick Malgieri's in "How to Bake"-it's awesome! I'll be doing this recipe for a large function next week for a brunch. I'm sure everyone will love it!

I also omitted the corn syrup and still found it too sweet for me. Substituted whip cream because my half and half went bad. Still tasted good.Used challah bread and was great.

I've made this dish several times, all with wonderful reviews. I sliced the bread two inches thick and used maple syrup instead of corn syrup. Next time I will try fat free half and half, since this is not a diet dish. Everyone who tastes this wants the recipe, I wish I could take credit for coming up with this easy one!

I made this for CHristmas day brunch, and also for a holiday brunch later in the season...It went over SOOO well, especially with my husband, who is a VERY picky eater! I am determined to find a small enough baking pan and cut the recipe down to feed two on a typical sunday AM. Oh, also, I substituded the maple syrup, AND used Frangelico instead of Grand Marnier. Very Yummy....

I made this dish for the first day of 2000 and it was a huge hit! It was so yummy, I couldn't believe it. And the most amazing thing is that it really does taste like Creme Brulee. I particularly liked the fact that you can make it in advance, so that you don't have to deal with the kitchen being a mess. You can basically stick it in the oven and enjoy your guests while it cooks.

Very easy, tastes like easy-to-make sticky buns. Used challah bread with the crusts. Based on reviewer feedback I used a little less brown sugar, and real maple syrup in place of corn syrup. Also added finely chopped peacans (just a sprinkle). I tried fat free Land O'Lakes half and half which was fine in this recipe, you could not tell. Served for New Years Brunch with Vegetable Cheese Strata and both were big hits, although the Strata was the crowds favorite. Most guests asked for this recipe. If this had been my only hot entree than I could see how it would have been too sweet for my guests, but since it was the 2cd hot item, it worked out fine.

I LOVED this recipe! We had it on Christmas morning and felt decadent! I used molasses instead of the corn syrup and egg nog instead of the half-and-half...it gave it a very Christmas-y flavor. It is rich...so don't plan on using syrup with it. A very special breakfast that will become a Christmas tradition in our family!

This was wonderfully elegant for a Christmas morning breakfast. And since I prepared it the day before it was wonderful to simply pop it in the oven during the hectic morning activity of gift opening. I also substituted maple syrup for corn syrup and thought the flavor was very rich.

I made this dish for our Santa breakfast at school and I received many compliments and requests for the recipe. It was very easy to prepare. I did overbake it by only a few minutes, which resulted in some burning of the edges, which I cut around. Once it gets near done, it will burn quickly, so watch carefully! It was delicious and I will definitely make it again.

Overall, it was an easy recipe. However, it is definately too sweet (due to corn syrup) and generally not a traditional style French Toast...

Definitely would make this recipe again. I used maple syrup instead of the corn syrup and a little more Grand Manier than the recipe calls for. This is the best french toast I have eaten and I have made it three times already for my family. Perfect for brunch or a hungry bunch of kids.

I've made this dish many times - it's always a hit. My husband & the kids LOVE it! During the Christmas season, I make it with eggnog and sprinkle it with cinnamon/nutmeg before baking. I solve the too sweet problem by substituting premium maple syrup for the corn syrup. KEB

Fabulous! I just served it for brunch-made one batch with raisin bread and the other with challah. Everyone raved. I didn't have any Grand Marnier--so I added almond extract--which was perfect. Next time, I may add nuts. This one is going into the family favorites cookbook!

extremely rich, and tastes just like the name describes. No need for syrup or other toppings. This one is a keeper, and great for guests (assemble the night before and cook in the morning).
