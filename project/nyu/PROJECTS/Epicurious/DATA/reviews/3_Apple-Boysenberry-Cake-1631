This was an amzing dish, but leave out the almonds!

The cake took hours to prepare and the directions were a little vague in parts. The description says that the texture of the cake is like a pudding. Not sure where I went wrong, but mine was dry and crumbly and the flavor and texture of the toasted almonds overpowered the fruit.

You must use Kosher l' Pesach whipping cream, not non-dairy creamer which is made from edible vegetable oil, not likely OK for Pesach
