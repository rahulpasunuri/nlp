I made this with some leftover bread that was a bit dry - should have upped custard by 50%. Sauce was key. People raved!

I should start by noting I am not a dessert person. I was having dinner guests and this recipe intrigued me. It's simplicity cannot be denied and the outcome will have your guests going back for seconds and thirds. Do not think twice if you want accolades for not a lot of work. I used croissants as reviewed by others.

i made this with leftover bread from thanksgiving. my oven dried it out fast but it was still delicious. i followed there recipe as is but didn't make the cream sauce. instead i served it with caramel sauce from a pear and caramel epicurious recipe.i will make this again as it is very easy and rich.

This is delicious, but I would change a few things: cut chocolate in half (all dark 70% b/c it over powers the flavors), up the milk by 1/4 to 1/2 cup in bread, use a semi-sweet egg bread or similar bread, & add 1/2 to 1 cup raisins. Sauce is perfect as is; don't double b/c it is very rich. Definitely use Irish Cream liqueur! Enjoy!

I used brioche instead of french bread, and it is DELICIOUS. I just use one or two loaves of the Trader Joe's brioche instead of all 10 cups of bread, and it is wonderful!

Made this bread pudding just yesterday as I had a lot of baguette left over from a dinner. The taste was simply divine & it is definitely a keeper. But just as the other readers have mentioned the quantity of bread is just too much & the custard way too little. So next time I will be doing it with just 6 cups of bread & increase the whole milk to 1 1/2 cups for the custard.

I made this awhile ago and can't stop thinking about it...it was so delicious. I am recouperating from 2 hip replacements and dreaming about making it again when I am recovered. I wasn't crazy about the sauce so I made a custard sauce (floating island). That might be too much custard for some but everyone at my party loved it...I served both sauces and the custard sauce was devoured.....the other sauce, not so much. yummmmmm...wish I could make it tomorrow. I might try the challa bread and different dark chocolates instead of the white chocolate.

Easy and delicious. Instead of French bread, I used a chocolate cherry bread from a local artisanal bakery and Lindt 70% dark chocolate - NO white chocolate. People who normally don't even like bread pudding LOVE this. The sauce is definitely worth the extra time.

This is hands down my husband's favorite dessert. To be honest, I had misplaced the original receipe. I actually made it straight from the magazine the first time. Well, my hubby kept asking for it - FOR YEARS folks. Yes, it's that good. Finally, I had an epiphany - join this site because I knew if anyone had it, they would. I was so excited when my hunch paid off and I saw this little beauty. Seriously, try this dessert. It will impress everyone!! My hubby is super picky, trust me.

Fantastic recipe! I used a beautiful egg bread I found at the grocery store and the texture was perfect. I think next time I might substitute milk chocolate for the white chocolate and see how that turns out, since I've never been a fan of white chocolate. Even so, I still thought this bread pudding was phenomenal, as did everyone else who ate it... and there were some bread pudding snobs in the crowd, for sure!

I consider myself a bread pudding connoisseur and this recipe is to die for! The French bread gave it a nice chewier texture, although I recommend soaking for a little longer (maybe an hour or so). However I followed the recipe and the rest does not need modification. Absolutely decadent!

OMG, OMG OMG....Seriously that's all I can say! I fell in love with this dessert literally for a month straight this was my dessert of choice! It is excellent and easy to make. I usually don't use the sauce and just make the bread pudding itself. I also halve the recipe and use semi-sweet chocolate instead of bittersweet, add a dash of cinnamon and usually only use one whole egg. Try this, trust me it's worth it!

This is the first bread pudding I have made that didn't taste like French toast!! Restaurant quality good. Super easy to make. We just used white chocolate chips, nothing fancy just grocery store brand. The sauce is excellent - don't skip it. Followed the recipe exactly and had no problems. My husband said he wants this instead of a birthday cake this year -- that is high praise from him! A winner!!!

OMG - amazing recipe. I have made it twice - once with Challa as recommended by other reviewers and a second time with sweet Hawaiian bread. I used 12 oz to start and ended up adding another 4 ounces of Hawaiian bread. It was much lighter, fluffier and unbelievably delicious the second time around. The Challa bread was also yummy, just a denser texture. Otherwise, I followed the recipe pretty closely. Be aware of the skim on the sauce when cooling, so to prevent, cover directly with plastic wrap, no airspace betwen the sauce and the plastic. This should help. Making it again tonight!

Weve made this recipe 3 times. Heres what weve learned. The best results were when we chose a deep pan and placed it into a water bath. Each time the bread texture was not mushy and not chewy (as in overdone chewy), but just right. We never tried croissants or challah as mentioned by other reviewers but just a crusty white loaf (not artisanal, like with big holes in it). In short, I think the ingredients are excellent but the technique can be improved upon. When we made a half a recipe, we used a 4.5 springform pan. When we made a whole recipe, we used a 9.5 springform pan. We wrapped the outside of the springform pan in foil (to be certain the water didnt permeate the pudding). We placed the springform pan inside another baking dish and poured boiling water halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Caveat  the water and foil discolored the outside of the springform pan and there may have been some residue in the baking dish that I had to scrub off so choose dishware you dont intend to use for table presentation now, or later.

The bread pudding was exceptional (I too used croissants and added a little extra cream and egg). And the sauce--which was the selling point when I first read the recipe--may also have been exceptional, but I ended up with bailey' irish cream pudding instead of a pourable sauce to add to the bread pudding. When I was boiling the sauce, it never seemed to get thicker on the stove--so I added a little extra cornstarch and boiled it some more (oops). The sauce started to become lumpy, so I took it off the stove and strained it, but it was clearly not going to work at that point. Oh well..instead I made a warm Grand Manier Caramel sauce and some whipped cream to go with the bread pudding..both toppings were fantastic on top of the warm bread pudding, just out of the oven...now I just need to figure out what I'm going to do with my bailey's concoction..

Rating: 4
This was outstanding! I buttered the baking dish which gave a nice toasty-buttery edge rather than using spray. I also "soaked" for a little over an hour. Otherwise stuck to the recipe. The sauce is great, though next time I'll try to get the skin that forms off rather than stirring in and ending up with little gooey bits (that actually tasted pretty good). Everyone devoured this dessert.

I made this for a group last weekend for a Christmas party and it was a huge hit! Used kahlua insead of baileys as that's a preference of mine, more dark chocolate than white, soaked overnight and used challah bread. Didn't think that it would be moist enough but it certainly was. Rave reviews from guests. Reheated well too!

Turned out delicious. I loosely covered the top of the dish for the later half of the baking time to prevent over burning the top. Superbly decadent so not for anyone looking for a healthy dish!! I had two servings and excessive sauce. Am planning to bring this to an upcoming holiday party.

Extremely easy and very versatile. Used vanilla instead of the Irish Cream Liqeur. Still wonderful. Great for someone who wants a show stopping dessert without the work. I use more cream/milk than called for because I like a more pudding- like bread pudding. But, there's really no wrong way to make this.

I made this last wk for an office St. Patrick's Day party and it was a huge hit! I used croissants and served it warm w/ the Baileys Irish Cream Sauce. I placed it in the oven just as the party began and it smelled wonderfulthe aroma drifting all the way out the door, down the hallway and into the elevators. As people were busy chatting and eating other foods, every now and then Id hear someone say dreamily, "Wow, what smells so good?!" When it emerged from the oven, one guy couldnt wait for it to cool and just stood next to the counter stealing bites from it w/ his a fork. Another partier made it the next night for a dinner party and two other co-workers asked for the recipe. It was a little risky making it for the first time for other people, but&well&its bread, heavy cream and sugar--how bad can it be?!

Perfect! Low effort, high reward, seemingly impossible to screw up. Made at the last minute, put in a lidded pyrex, took to a dinner party and baked there. Served with cinnamon-butter pecans. The texture was divine, nice and chewy and crusty, and gooey. So yummy (not much of a white choc flavor, but what can you say....). The sauce was good, but tradional and not really needed. Might try something else next time for kicks. Used a crusty/dense semonlina-french loaf and was very happy!

FANTASTIC. EASY. DELICIOUS. Got rave reviews...my guests were excited for dessert just from the wonderful smell coming from the oven, and they didn't even know what was in there. The sauce is like silk, and accessorizes the bread pudding perfectly. The combo of white and bittersweet chocolate with that silky sauce...amazing! This one's a keeper.

Rating: 4
Wow what a hit! I def followed everyone's directions. I used challah for the bread (already sweet & soft) so you don't have to use as much sugar that's called in this receipe. Instead of chocolate chips - I would used chocolate shavings next time. The chips made it look cheap. Again - way too much sugar is in this receipe. You can probably do without the last bit of 2 tblspoons of sugar. I did add an extra egg & took away some of the bread. Problem with that was not enough bread to fill the baking dish :) Better on my waist line though!

Rating: 2
Not fabulous. The flavors were good. The proportions, however, are lacking. The best part about the recipe is the Irish Cream sauce... very good, very flavorful. Next time I make bread pudding I will use the sauce but make many changes to the pudding. The custard proportions are WAY off. Needs more eggs and cream. I used 6 eggs and one extra cup of cream and I think it could have even used more. I would also use day-old cinnamon buns or croissants as other reviewers used rather than French bread (I used stale rolls this time because it was what I had). Not a terrible recipe, just didn't blow me or my family away.

I made this yesterday for a dinner party and it was fantastic beyond words. I used Portugese sweet bread and all cream instead of using any whole milk. I baked it in a water bath. And I warmed the custard sauce prior to serving it and served the bread pudding warm as well. Everyone was so impressed. It was by far the best dessert I've ever had. The Portugese sweet bread gives the pudding a smooth and creamy texture. Don't pass this one up.

I've never been big on bread pudding, so I'd never made it, but my boyfriend loves it so I thought I'd try. Due to other reviews that said it was dry, I added 1 more cup of cream and one more egg, and I used all dark chocolate. It turned out perfect. It was crusty on the top and gooey and warm on the inside. I used amaretto and half-&-half in the sauce b/c that's what I had, and it was wonderful. He went from refusing dessert b/c he was too full from dinner to having three servings of this bread pudding. I was commanded to make it again.

Let me begin by saying I do not like chocolate. At all. I ate this fabulous dessert. Twice. This bread pudding is the best ever. I read ALL the reviews and made a few changes/substitutions.

I will make this again, again and again. It was unreal...

This was awesome! I used mexican bolillo bread I hand whipped the egg mixture. I let the bread soak for only 20 minutes. I used a mixture of dark and milk chocolate since i'm not a fan of white. It came out perfectly! About doubled in size when it was in the oven then shrunk down a bit when it came out. The sauce is wonderful, don't leave that out if you make this recipe. I am already planning on making it again soon.

this is my FIL's favorite treat now, he asks for it every year for his birthday. the sauce has a reputation of its own, everyone LOVES it . you will find yourself licking the bowl I strongly suggest making doubling what is called for.Also, this is a good pudding with cheap chocolate, it is a great one with great chocolate, worth the extra money. It is drier than most bread puddings, but I prefer it this way.

After reading the reviews I made this recipe with (weighed-12 oz) croissants. I soaked for 2 hours then cooked. I put into a glass casserole dish which I think helped keep it moister than if it was spread out in a 13 inch rect pan. It turned out great!! Friends loved it, I used slightly more Bailey's in the sauce with more cornstarch to thicken it, It still didn't have enough "Bailey';s flavor-next time I will use extra cornstarch in the cooking of the sauce then thin at the end with Bailey's to give it more Bailey's taste and "punch". Good company recipe.

Absolutely amazing. I used abut 12 cups of stale homemade French bread. I ended up using a 12 oz. can of evaporated milk poured over the top as it looked a little dry to me. I prefer my pudding a little more like custard. I used bittersweet chocolate and think that was probably best since I don't like overly sweet desserts. I used Ghiradelli brand for both chocolates. This dessert is elegant, rich and incredibly easy. This is a recipe that I will turn to whenever I want to impress guests without much effort.

This is one of the all-time great desserts! So easy and so delicious! I didn't have Irish cram liquer, so I used brandy instead, with apparently no loss of flavor. When looking for the brandy, I came across a bottle of Amaretto, and I might just use that next time, to see what a little almond flavor does....hmmmmm. Just be ready if you make this bread pudding -- I had people fighting over the leftovers, begging me for the recipe, and asking when they could come over for more!

I've been making this since I first saw the recipe in the RSVP column. My family stalks me over this. However, instead of bread I use croissants. I cube them up and lightly toast them in the oven before tossing them with the chocolate and custard mix. I also reduce the soaking time to no more than 1/2 hour. It comes out moist without being soggy and it is much lighter than when using a heavy bread or brioche.

I served this at a dinner party and received gasps. My fiance says it's the best dessert he's EVER had. Because of his tastes, I had almost replaced the white chocolate with more dark, but he loved the recipe as is.

This is wonderful! Our grocery store did not carry brioche (as recommended by other cooks), so I used Hawaiian Sweet Bread instead, and it worked great. Don't skimp on the chocolate -- use a good quality imported brand, it's definitely worth the extra cost. I would also suggest using chopped chocolate instead of chips as previously suggested, since the irregular pieces made each bite a unique experience. The few minutes it takes to chop it is worth it. This was even great the next day warmed in the microwave - everyone loved it!!

I used brioche rather than french bread. The recommended 12 ounces was too much when I added the bread to the cream cream/chocolate mixture, so I carefully scooped out the excess bread - I'd estimate 9 ounces would be sufficient. The result was a wonderfully moist pudding with masses of semi-melted chocolate. Highl recommended

Rating: 4
I used a fresh brioche (whipped up in my new bread machine!) and white and semi-sweet chocolate chips to avoid the mess of chopping chocolate. I also thought that 14 cups of bread is too much for the amount of liquid in the custard; I added about 1 1/2 cups of whole mild while soaking. It was fantastic!

This is a Great dessert. For those of you who are expecting a moist bread pudding, put those ideas out of your head before you become disappointed. My mother and sister hate most bread puddings, but because this was drier, were able to absolutely enjoy it. Most importantly, make it with the Irish Cream sauce. It adds moisture where some think it is lacking, as well as tastes absolutely heavenly.

This was excellent, and earned raves from many in the "I don't usually like bread pudding" camp. It looked a little dry, so I added a bit more milk (maybe 1/3 cup) and kept it covered for the first 30 mins. of baking. It still is much less custardy than some bread puddings, but I thought that was one of its strengths -- it had a great almost chewy texture with the ciabatta I used. I'm not a big fan of Irish cream liqueur, so I did not make the sauce, but rather served it with good vanilla ice cream.

This bread pudding is outstanding! I added extra chocolate (mainly because I was too lazy to carefully weigh 6 ounces). The Irish Cream Sauce is necessary to ease the richness of the chocolates. I agree that the bread should soak longer than the recommended 30 minutes. Next time I make it I will let it stand in the refrigerator for several hours or add more milk. If you want to make a desert that people will want seconds of; this is it!

Made this for Christmas dinner dessert and although it was very good, it was too heavy and rich following that big meal. I really should have known better and made something light, tangy and palate cleansing instead. Like others, I decreased the amount of bread, added an extra egg and an additional 1/2 cup of cream and it turned out very creamy/custardy, not dry at all. Used Swiss Lindt chocolate - a trio of milk, dark and white with great success. Made it the night before and kept in the fridge overnight - I think that is the key to success if you are wanting a creamy/moist pudding. The Irish Cream sauce is excellent, but I prefer it warmed rather than cold - too thick right from the fridge. If you like bread pudding, this is a very good recipe.

Delicious and popular. I've made it twice to very good reviews. Do keep an eye on the sauce when it's boiling...it tends to bubble in a menacing way and unless you're using a very large sauce pan you may be in danger of it boiling over if you don't fiddle with the heat. Also, extra soaking time only helps the finished product, and definitely measure the bread in ounces rather than cups.

This is an amazing dessert. I've made it three times now, once for an office party and twice for family functions and I've received tons of compliments and recipe requests every time. It's incredibly easy yet tastes really yummy and gourmet. I would highly recommend this recipe. It's a keeper in my book.

I am not a chocolate fan but I've made this 3 times because my family is crazy for it. For me, the sauce makes the dish. However, the second time I made the pudding I used Mexican chocolate from Ibarra and I thought it was sensational. The third time I made it, I had only regular chocolate in the house so I added 2 tsps. of cinnammon, 1/2 c. crushed almonds, a pinch of chile powder. Again wonderful. Truly best served warm. And I mix it 3 hours before I bake it and let it soak in the refrigerator so that it can cook during dinner.

This was Awesome--Many rave reviews! I used white bread instead of french bread--I think it gives a smoother texture. This is definitely added to the "keeper" pile!!!!

Excellent dish! I would definitely make sauce ahead of time next time, it took more time, the rest was a breeze. so yummy warm with the cold sauce on top. My kids loved it. Not dry at all, and even great the next day.

I have not made this recipe. I suspect that the problem with dryness some readers report is attributable to measuring the bread rather than weighing it. The recipe for chocolate breading pudding on this same site (2 below) also calls for 12 ounces of bread but says that is about 6 cups. A far cry from the 14 called for here.

I thought this recipe would be the answer for my christmas dinner dessert. However, after trying the recipe, I felt the dish was dry and really missed something. Maybe a person could add more moisture and more oomph to the sauce.

This dessert is so delicious, that I have made it several times already! I even substituted half and half for the heavy cream in the pudding (but not in the sauce). It is delightfully rich and scrumptious! One time I didn't have the Irish cream, and used brandy. It was slightly different, but every bit as good!

Definitely a winner, served to guests, one of which was a chocoholic - nothing but rave reviews, all wanted this recipe. Some modifications, used Cuban bread, added pecans for a crunch & increased the amount of cream/half & half used to make more moist & doubled the Baileys in the Sauuuuuce!

It was awesome! It was a little to bready though. I only used 12 cups of bread and it was still to much. The irish cream sauce is the best part. It would be great over ice cream.

I really liked the taste of this dish. I didn't think there was enough liquid for the bread, so I added another 2 cups of cream and let the bread soak for 3 hours before baking. When I started the cream sauce, I realised I didn't have cornstarch, so I made a basic creme anglaise and added the Baileys. The guests at the party all loved the how the flavors worked together.

I did this recipe for a group of my friends that are all great cooks. They immediately asked for the reicpe and where I got it from. I found it very easy to do.

I'm not sure why the reviewer below had a dry result. I was concerned that it would be dry and not enough custard for me but I followed the recipe (just like my Mom says you should always do the first time) at it was fantastic. I thought I was going to have to arm wrestle my best friend to take the leftover home! And the extra sauce made a great topping for the pumpkin pie when the whipped cream ran out.

It was a little dry....The sauce was great, I would use it for something else in the future. I prefer more custard-type puddings.

I tried for the first time yesterday and took to a pot luck Thanksgiving dinner, with many pies, etc. for competition. I barely got a taste! the pan was scraped clean. It was not difficult to make, and was truly outstanding.

This dessert was so easy to make and everyone loved it. I used Ghirardelli White Chocolate and Semit-sweet Chocolate to save time. Next time I cut the recipe in half. It makes a lot of bread pudding. The Irish Cream sauce the best part of this dessert.

I've also been to Carmen Anthony's in Woodbury, Ct. and had this dessert there. Wonderful!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews. I also made it the day before and heated it just before serving.

This bread pudding was outstanding! My guests were licking the bowl - next time I will double up the recipe. Everybody loved it! I made it a day in advance and baked it before serving - my friends and family all wanted the recipe.

This dish was outstanding! I might try making it a bit less rich by cutting the amount of chocolate.

Just finished the last piece! It was very good but, in my opinion, too "bready" and too rich. Served it at a dinner party and two guests didn't finish their relatively small serving. The concept is great, however, so I think I'll play with the recipe to get something lighter, more custardy. Perhaps the reverse - an Irish cream bread pudding with a chocolate sauce.

This recipe was easy and WONDERFUL! I served it at a dinner party and my friend who loves bread pudding says she has dreamt about this! My twelve- year-old son loved it, too...I put ice cream on the side of his, instead of the Irish Cream Sauce. Make sure you serve it right out of the oven! I used Valrhona (spelling?) bittersweet chocolate...expensive, but worth it.

I have never been overly fond of bread pudding, but my husband loves it. I saw this recipe and thought I would make it when we were having some good friends for dinner. It was a HUGE hit- and even the finicky children enjoyed it. I used Ghiradelli`s chips in place of the chopped chocolates and it worked out wonderfully. We will absolutely be making this again!
