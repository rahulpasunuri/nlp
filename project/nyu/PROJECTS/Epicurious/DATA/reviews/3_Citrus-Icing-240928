A runny icing--definitely not a frosting. I used more than an additional cup of sugar and some butter to try to firm it up, and went ahead and frosted the cake, thinking it would set up once on the cake. (I had never used dry egg whites before. I put it in the refrigerator to help things along. When I returned, I found a bare cake in a yellow puddle. Urgh! This is the first time a recipe has ever been a complete failure for me. Should that have been 4 TABLESPOONs of dried whites? In terms of texture and flavor, this was a disaster.

Excellent, though, in a pinch, I had to use prepared juices, rather than fresh-squeezed. Really great with the chocolate roll-out cookies found here: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Chocolate-Roll-Out-Cookies-240668

This icing came out great and was quick, easy and very refreshing. If you can't find "powdered egg whites" you can use 2 fresh egg whites in exchange of the 4 tsp of powdered egg whites (called for in the recipe), just cut back on the orange juice. If you use real egg whites, I suggest using orange juice CONCENTRATE about 1/4 cup and 2 fresh egg whites so you still get the orange taste in the icing. Powdered egg white are just pasteurized dried egg whites. Some grocery stores sell it in the area where they sell baking items or evaporated milk. Or a specialty store selling things for baking, cake decorating or health food store (some people use egg whites to add protein to milkshakes). You can order "just whites" brand too here... http://www.vitacost.com/Just-Whites?csrc=PPCADWLT-just_whites&mtp=sHsnDZx5u|pcrid|6194805851&refcd=GO000000111045175s_Just_Whites&tsacr=GO6194805851

I went around to a few different grocery stores looking for powdered egg whites, but everyone I asked looked at me like I'd just exited a UFO. However, I was able to find a powdered egg substitute (note: egg, not egg white). Does anyone know: will it make an important difference if I use standard powdered egg replacer instead of powdered egg whites?
