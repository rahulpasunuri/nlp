Very simple and tastes wonderful. I wouldn't bother pealing the potatoes or use red ones if you like too. I have also done this would boiling the potatoes at all and just putting them on the grill in a foil package for 20-30 min.

I didn't get the potatoes done enough, so I had to microwave them to get them done enough. Next time, I will cook the potatoes for more (20+ minutues).

Simple, straight forward flavors and incredibly easy to make. Leave the skins on! Served this with the Rib Eye Steaks w/ Bernaise Butter and the flavors did not conflict... Delicious dinner! KIMBER

Simple, basic recipe. I liked it. Good for days when you don't have the time to cook for long. Smells good cooking too.

Fairly simple and easy to do. I wasn't sure if the rosemary would be too over powering for the potatoes but it wasn't. Goes well with steak and chicken.
