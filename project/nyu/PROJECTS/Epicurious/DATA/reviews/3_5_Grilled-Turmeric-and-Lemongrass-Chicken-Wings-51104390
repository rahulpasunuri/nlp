Made these for Superbowl - big hit. I used a tube of lemongrass paste instead of fresh as it's easier. I used the water and put in more lime juice in place of the tamarind juice concentrate (I mean, really?) and it was fine. Simmered the reserved marinade for the dip, then gave the leftover dip to the hostess who continued to rave about the flavor when she used it on grilled chicken. I'd add a little more heat next time - that's why 3 not 4 stars.

Underwhelmed with the flavors. Will not make again.

I made these today, after marinating overnight. I thought they turned out great. For my tastes, I'd add another tbls. of fish sauce for salt, and don't forget the lime at the end, it makes a big difference. I like spice, and for me this needed a little more. I used 3 thai chilies and 1 Serrano and it wasn't enough for me.

I used this to marinate a one-pound pork tenderloin and it was delish! I totally missed the water in the recipe, so it definitely doesn't need it. You don't need a lot of marinade for overnight soak so long as you use full fat coconut milk because it becomes thick in refrig and really coats it. I used about 1/4 cup to marinate and put the rest aside to use as dipping sauce. (I'm always leery about using marinade even with the step of boiling.) I used a teaspoon of dried lemongrass (from Penzey's, which is a must if you cook thai a lot) and it added a brilliant fresh flavor. I also used about 1/2 tsp of tamarind paste and it added the perfect pungency. I agree that a bit of sweetness would kick it up and I'll probably add some honey next time, which will be soon because this is a keeper! Oh, and to cook the pork, I sear it in a skillet on stove and then put in 425 oven until meat thermometer reads 140. That leaves a bit on pink in middle but I've always cooked pork tenderloin to that temperature and never had a problem. If I use honey next time, I probably won't sear on high because it will burn (I've made that mistake before)! I highly recommend this one if you like these thai/indian flavors.

As a change from our usual lemongrass marinade, I tried this on 3 lbs of boneless chicken thighs. My Vitamix made short work of pureeing everything without having to pre-chop...including the lemongrass. Made quite a lot of marinade; I left out the water and did not use the reduced marinade as a sauce. It was quite good, but not outstanding enough to switch me over from my favorite from Mai Pham's cookbook.

Finished marinading and cooked on the charcoal grill. OMG so yum!! Since I had to substitute lemon verbena for the lemongrass, I taste tested the marinade before I put the chicken in it, and for my preferences, I wanted some sweetness so I added some honey to taste. Marinated 24 hours, and I cooked down the marinade but used it all up to baste the wings on the grill. I don't think you need to save any of it to dip. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

for A Cook from Ontario - I didn't have any lemongrass, but I substituted leaves from my lemon verbena plant instead. They both have the same wonderful lemon scent. Mine are still marinating, so I can't say yet how they turned out!

... for by A Cook from Kenora, Ontario CDN on 07/26/12 You can pick one of these tubes up in the produce section of many markets. http://www.gourmetgarden.com/ca/

To a cook from Ontario: Does your supermarket carry the plastic squeeze tubes of various herbs? Krogers has them here in the Produce section. Lemongrass is there, as well as mint, basil, and other herbs. Sometimes they have fresh lemongrass, but they always have the tubes.

I live in a small "City" in Northwestern Ontario and rarely have access to lemongrass. Is there a suitable substitute?

Followed the recipe as written but used a mixture of wings and boneless breasts and they both turned out fine. Did not have the tamarind juice so used the lime juice substitution. We loved the taste of the marinade and will be making again.Served with the charred corn salad.
