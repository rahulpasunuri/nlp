3 1/2 forks. Yummy change of pace for lima bean lovers. Looks great on the plate! I used more cayenne than the recipe called for and it was super. I also skipped the sieve step. The puree was plenty velvety without the extra trouble. FYI, the leftover puree makes a great spread for toasted, rustic bread.

Every time I make this dish, I am hounded for the recipe. Amazing!

This was a flavorful and colorful accompaniment to our Easter dinner. Our meat course was lamb chop and veal roast, with this pretty green puree between the two. Great texture, and extremely easy. There are probably many ways one could change it: add herbs,etc. , but we followed the recipe this first time, and enjoyed it. The only suggestion I would offer is to add the half-and-half slowly so that you control the consistency.
