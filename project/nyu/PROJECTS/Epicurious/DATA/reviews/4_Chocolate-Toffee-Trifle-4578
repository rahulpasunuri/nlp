I can't believe anyone would say this cake recipe is dry??? It is SO moist and delicious, it's completely decadent. In any case, this is one of my favourite simple holiday treats. Considering doing a cream/mascarpone mix tomorrow when I get it ready for Christmas Eve - yum!

Made this for the first time yesterday for a holiday potluck. An absolute hit! Followed others' advice here and used a really good brownie mix instead. In my case I used the Trader Joe's Truffle Brownie mix. Undercook it a bit so it's moist and softer. Also used the Trader Joe's Chocolate Covered English Toffee; put them all in a thick ziploc and smashed it to small chunks with a meat tenderizer. Used heavy whipping cream and added no sugar; it really would have been way too sweet. Washed a pint of fresh raspberries and dried them well in a clean dishtowel. Added one layer of these in the middle, and then decorated the top, along with a bunch of shaved dark chocolate. Makes the whole thing look amazing! This recipe is definitely a holiday keeper! Quite simple, very few ingredients, quick to make/chill, and everyone just loves it. Looks fantastic on your holiday table!

Easy, quick, and a crowd pleaser. If you bake the ghiradelli brownies ahead it's a snap to assemble. Was the most popular item on a dessert buffet at Thanksgiving. Kids love it but it looks special enough for adults, too. I drizzled a little godiva liquer between the layers. Don't know how well it keeps because it was all gone!

This was delicious! Everyone who tried it loved it. I was concerned that the cake might not turn out that well because the proportions in the recipe seemed quite strange, but it was excellent and very moist. I'm not sure it would work well for a normal layer cake, but it was perfect for this trifle. Highly recommend.

Everyone I've made this for (including myself) LOVES this recipe. I add strawberries and raspberries as well. I use about 3 pints of each - most of which are chopped in and added with the heath bar layer, then I reserve some to decorate the top. Really a delicious dessert and serves a lot of people!

OMG! this is delicious. Enjoyed by kids and adults. As I whipped the cream, I realized there was no sugar added to it and was worried that this might make it taste funny. Not to worry- YOU DON'T NEED TO ADD SUGAR TO THE WHIPPED CREAM! In fact, I think it would be waaay to sweet if you used sweetened whipped cream. This was the perfect blend of chocolate, toffee and cream. I used the brownie mix as other reviewers noted because I was short on time, but it was delicious and super easy!

Like so many, we decided to use freshly baked brownies (from a dark chocolate mix) instead of the cake suggested in the recipe. I added vanilla and sugar to the whipping cream. This was such an easy and impressive dessert and perfect for a Christmas dinner - especially if you have a trifle bowl. I made this with my teenage daughters and we all chipped in to assemble. Highly recommend.

Every time I make this recipe it's eaten in an instant. My picky 10 year old nephew asks for it every holiday. Even my sister who doesn't like chocolate asks for this recipe.

Thanks to the cook from Toronto for the suggestion to buy the Ghiradelli brownie mix instead of making the cake. The first time I made this, I was so unimpressed with the dry and tasteless cake recipe, I didn't make the recipe again for two years. When I looked up the recipe again out of curiosity and read the brownie suggestion I decided to give it another go, and loved it. Made this for a child's birthday, and everyone swooned! It looks impressive in the trifle dish, and it really does look like it took all day to make.

I made this for my family on Christmas. The cake is definitely worth making, and a sprinkle of Kahlua on each layer is definitely a good addition. I thought there was a bit much of the whipped cream, however, for a full serving. Perhaps lessen it a bit to balance the proportion. s

Like the cook from Chicago, I never make the cake part of this recipe. (seems a bit dry to me). Instead, I buy a box of good brownie mix (Ghiradelli is great) and use that. It takes five minutes of prep time to get the brownies in the oven, and is so much easier than baking a cake from scratch that will just be crumbled up anyway. Once the brownies are baked, it's another five minutes to assemble the dessert, and it will look like you've slaved for hours! You'll fool everyone!!!

I have made this several times and it is always a big hit. When short for time I make a pan of brownies instead of the cake recipe listed. The brownies are moist and chocolaty, and provide a nice base for the layers of whipped cream and toffee. I also add chocolate syrup (just a little) as mentioned by another reviewer. Super simple and very tasty!

In the midwest, this is what we call a "Punch Bowl" as this recipe is constructed in a punch bowl using a box cake mix, chocolate pudding, cool whip, Hershey's syrup, and Heath bits. It tastes fabulous, but the homemade way here is really the ultimate. Try amaretto to really enhance the flavor. Yum! Yum! And take the shortcuts if you're having guests with less sophisticated palettes. It's cloyingly sweet, but reminds me of home!

i absolutely loved this dish, as did everyone at christmas dinner 2004. next time i make it, i will set the cream a little longer (a pinch of cream of tarter goes far) and add a swirl of chocolate fudge sauce to each layer. also, be sure to have a tall enough dish, so you can layer it beautifully. the cake recipe included is the perfect consistency and flavor to balance out the sweet cream and toffee bits--extra toffee was also highly appreciated by my clan.

I made this as one of several Thanksgiving desserts and although people loved it I thought it definitely needed some kind of liquor to kick it up and moisten it. Since kids were going to be eating it I didn't add any liquor and found it to be a bit dry - more like cake with cream and toffee bits. It has potential though and looks very pretty layered in a glass trifle dish. I made the cake the day before and assembled it in the morning. On tasting the leftovers today I found that the toffee bits had dissolved so there was no longer the toffee crunch that I liked about it yesterday.

I made this for my book club and several people asked for the recipe. I made the cake which I thought was very moist and excellent. I was a little concerned that it sunk in the middle but really didn't matter since I crumbled it anyway. I added a little confectioner's sugar to the whipped cream and used Heath bits that you can buy in the baking section of the grocery store. I only refrigerated it for 5 hours before serving and it was wonderful. Can't wait to make it again!

Awesome dessert; and easy too! I made this recipe for my "girls dinner group" that is pushing 18 years. I added raspberries on top to cut the sweetness and EVERYONE had seconds. I used Heath bars (chopped) and it was a huge success!!

Made this for catering a Christmas party. Bought a plain chocolate sponge half sheet from a local bakery. Used a little powdered sugar in the cream to stabilize. Assembled in individual wine glasses with chunks of cake, Kahlua, piped in the cream using a plastic bag with tip cut off, then drizzled on chocolate sauce garnish. Used Enstrom's almond toffee crumbles from the factory in Grand Junction. They ship. www.enstrom.com. Great dessert with very little work and it's pretty inexpensive!

I really like the toffee flavor, but it is difficult to find chocolate covered toffee and the the toffee bits don't always softened up. Recently I found English Toffee flavored Heath Sundae Syrup and used that instead. I drizzled it lightly on the layers and it was fantastic.

This recipe was great! I made it for friends (it is a huge dessert) and I didn't get any seconds for myself. I made the cake part two days before and assembled the whole thing the day before. The cake part is VERY moist and would be good for other recipes too. Putting it together the day before really let the sugar from the cake and toffe soak into the whipping cream.

I would make this recipe again, but I will make sure to chop up the toffee more finely or substitute something else for it. I think it would be much better with macerated fruit since the toffee adds too much of a cloying sweetness and overwhelming crunch (I used Heath bars). I did not like that combination nor did my party guests. The cake and the whipped cream did taste great together, though. Very easy, but could be so much better. I'll try it with strawberries next time.

I made this for one of my desserts for a holiday dinner. It was pretty, but it was not one of my stellar efforts. I tried using more whipped cream, using the Kahlua, and using the Heath bars. I also added the raspberries. The combination of Kahlua and raspberries was not that good. It needs some refinement!

This was the only dessert that was completely devoured at Christmas dinner. Great recipe. Looks wonderful. I crumbled a bar of Cadbury's Flake on top and used Skor (Heath) bars for the chocolate covered toffee. I would probably not make the chocolate cake from scratch next time...it wasn't worth the effort.

I made this for a party and had many recipe requests. I also dribbled 1/4 cup of the Kaluha to the finished cake -- thought it seemed a little dry. Everyone loved it and it displays well. Go easy on the whipping cream you use on the 1st layer -- I almost didn't have enough for the top. Added fresh strawberries to the top, which were GREAT. Next time I'll add them to one of the layers in-between, too.

This is a very rich dessert. You can make it even better by drizziling a 1/4 cup of Kaulla (or other coffee liquior) onto the crumbled cake before layering!
