Perfectly wonderful desert. My husband had seconds. Just remember that the melting point for coconut oil is 76 degrees. Only low heat needed to melt the 2 tsp!

I love the gluten-free access this recipe has (I used quinoa flour), but I find the recipe amount is better for 10 muffin tin cups rather than 12. Otherwise they are too thin and crumbly. I used a liberal amount of coconut oil spray on the tin, I let them cool a LONG time, then I flipped it over and they popped right out with a little tapping. I put Coconut Bliss (non-dairy and sweetened with agave) ice cream in the cups for added moisture, then the fruit on top. That seems to help with the crumbly/dry problem. It's a fantastic recipe for the day-ahead aspect as well as the adaptive gluten-free/cane sugar-free/dairy free possibilities.

I made this recipe gulten free by using almond flour rather that whole wheat. It is a little tricky to get the nut cups to stick together and to get out of the muffin tins, but the flavor is amazing and I will definitely make it again. Love the agave syrup.
