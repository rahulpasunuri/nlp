I decided to make this recipe since I am a huge fan of this salad at Asia de Cuba, and have had it there at least 50 times over the years. As much as I love the dish, this recipe is woefully inadequate and does not replicate the flavors and texture of the real thing. First of all, the recipe omits bananas, which I am sure is served at the restaurant in NY. Furthermore, the texture of the salad is too mushy, even though I took care to drain everything. The process is so time consuming, and the taste of garlic overwhelmed the dressing. Lastly, the hearts of palm are very crunchy at the restaurant, and the canned ones that the recipe calls for are not. So I would say, this is definitely one dish that is worth the $ spent at the restaurant if you're in NY, LA, London, etc. After I block this rendition out of my mind, I plan on returning to Asia de Cuba to have this DIVINE salad.

This salad is delicious! Next time I would skip to canned hearts of palm, though -- or try fresh. Yum!

I have a restaurant in Southern New Jersey and have made this as a special at least a dozen times for my guests. It always gets rave reviews and is a snap to throw together. The fresh tastes and balance of sweet, spicy,and tangy have made it a frequently requested favorite. I often use the dressing for other seafood such as shrimp and tuna. Thanks for a great recipe.

I'm a caterer from brazil, and i've done this salad in about 5 dinners. everybody just loved it!!! I'ts a little sweet, a little spicy, very, very interesting. The only thing we have to be careful with is when you mix all ingredients the calamaris always want to stay below the rest because i'ts more heavy and people sometimes don't even see that there are calamaris in the salad. On the other hand, it's not possible to put it just when you're going to serve it, because the calamaris have to absorb the sauce, or they will not be that delicious.
