I wanted to like it, but I didn't. I used frozen artichokes too, no other substitutions. Maybe it was the lamb I bought? I thought it was way too fatty in the end, and I love lamb. I won't be making this again.

Very bland, even when added changes suggested by others: lemon zest, baby carrots, worchestershire sauce. Love lamb but still searching for a great stew recipe!

Very tasty. I made it with frozen artichokes, which was OK, but I oculd imagine that fresh artichokes would improve the recipe vastly. Don't forget to squeeze lemon on the final dish and salt during braising -- I thought the salt on the lamb initially would be enough, but it would have been improved by salting during cooking. I added carrots and fresh peas -- yum!

We did this dish an evening before - with much worry about effort versus payoff. Tonight was the finale (cooking and adding artichokes) with a wonderful result. We used lamb with bone stew meat from a local store but will be trying it with local farm raised next time. We used all our own herbs, our home grown leeks, garlic, artichokes, and garlic scapes. This was a great spring recipe. It got great review from our supper club.

Didnt have onion, didnt have enough lemon or parsley. It turned out great anyway. I used canned artichoke. Even my 14 yo said 'this meat's great!" Very tender...

We love lamb - lamb stew, shanks, chops, burgers, rack, leg. this recipe had such great reviews and promise that I audtioned a half-batch as a possible entree for our Passover seder. Following everything to a tee, and incorporating some of the suggestions by other reviewers, I was crestfallen at the lack of flavor and dry texture of some very expensive New Zealand boneless lamb. What a waste of time and effort. The leftovers went down the disposal.

An excellent dish. I used frozen artichoke hearts instead of baby chokes and it was great. Lots of flavor. I served with the mock risotto sugested in the print version and they went together well.

Really, really good! I added some peas and a little lemon juice at the end. Using frozen artichoke hearts from Trader Joes made this a very easy recipe.

Made this for a group of 8 last night - used about 4 1/2 lbs of lamb and bumped the rest of the ingredients up by about a third. I added a bouquet garni and some carrots based on the reviews. I also added a few drops of worcester sauce at the end to round out the flavor. I made the stew in the morning and let it sit in the refrigerator for about 6 hours. This made it easy to scoop some of the fat off the top. I added in the tinned artichokes (couldn't find fresh) whilst the stew was reheating and it turned out great. All the guests had seconds and no leftovers! We served it with potatoes roasted in duck fat and the pairing was superb. Will definitely add this to the rotation, especially for something relatively inexpensive to feed a group.

One of the best dishes ever...make this and you won't be disappointed.

Delicious! So, so very delicious. Cooked a double recipe for dinner for about a dozen people and they applauded afterwards. The flavor of the broth is liquid gold. As per others' suggestions, I doubled the lemon zest and added young carrots, and I think I might add some peas and asparagus near the end of the cooking time the next time I make this. I used fresh full grown artichokes (the store didn't carry baby artichokes). I didn't find them all that annoying to prep - there is a lot of time between when the lamb starts stewing and when the artichokes are needed, after all - but I might try out frozen artichokes if I'm making more than a double recipe since the fresh artichokes are a bit pricey. I needed about 1.5x as much broth as the recipe calls for.

This is so delicious! Used canned but unmarinated artichoke hearts cut into fourths and just let it heat for 10 minutes or so after adding them. I felt it needed just a little more acid at the end so I squeezed in 1/2 lemon, but otherwise it's amazing as written. I served it over brown/wild rice combo which was perfect. A keeper.

This was amazing. I accidentally bought some cuts of lamb which were mostly bone and little meat. Fortunately, the flavor came through nonetheless. I used a fair amount more broth/water than indicated so as to cover the whole dish while cooking. I only cooked it for about an hour as I was too impatient (and with little meat, I figured it didn't matter). I do think the baby artichokes are key, though I have access to reasonably priced ones so it worked out. I served this with pearl barley- definitely a good choice!

I've been making this for a couple of years with boneless leg of lamp and usually w/out the artichokes. I just double the leaks (I love leaks). It's a great cold weather recipe served over some cous cous. Adding some lemon juice just before serving especially if heating up from cold really adds a fresh zip of flavor.

Excellent flavor; I would make it again. All 8 guests had seconds. I added baby carrots as suggested by other reviewers. Next time I will use prepared artichokes, maybe frozen, as I did not think it was worth the trouble and expense to use fresh baby artichokes. It was very good served over couscous and the next day we ate the leftovers with polenta.

Incredibly good and a great showcase for the lamb and artichokes. I was a bit worried when making it, but upon tasting was amazed. Forewent the lemon and did rosemary and bay leaf instead. Great as leftovers as well.

Yum! This was delicious, and the flavor of the lamb really shone through. The only change I felt was important was to add a bit of red wine for acid and depth. To up the vegetable content, I also added carrots (about the same time as adding the broth) and peas (which should go in maybe 10 minutes before the end). The grocery didn't have lamb shoulder, so I used a leg, and it was incredibly tender. Also used frozen artichoke hearts instead of fresh baby artichokes. The 25 minutes cooking time was too long for them; next time I'll cook them maybe 10-15 minutes. As far as seasoning, on the advice of other reviewers I upped the lemon zest & thyme, added a bit of fresh lemon juice as well as rosemary and a bay leaf.

Terrific, as reviewed. I adjusted it as follows: added 2 cups of frozen peas added with the artichokes. That gave it more colour and made it more of a veggie dish. Used canned artichokes instead of fresh. Still great. Used twice the dried thyme and lemon zest than the recipe called for plus added juice of half a lemon added near the end of the cooking. Made for a very fresh taste. Served it over quinoa. Four of us devoured the pot! I'll make this again.

This is really very, very, good. I've tried it with fresh artichokes and canned and while the texture of the fresh is incomparable canned will do if you don't have time to prep artichokes.

I've made this recipe twice and with great results. First time, used fresh artichokes but replaced them the second time with canned artichokes. Worked just fine. Second time around I cooked it in the crockpot; +/- 6 hours on low. Didn't add the baby carrots in the stew but served them on the side with asparagus. Got great reviews from guests, even the children. And the mock risotto is a keeper as well.

This stew was so tasty and easy to make. I used frozen baby artichokes from Trader Joes and threw in a few carrots as recommended by other reviewers and it turned out beautifully. I can't wait to make this again. Perfect for a winter night and good for entertaining.

Basic recipe is a winner. I used the Costco boneless leg of lamb and fresh baby artichokes (but will try using frozen next time.) Made a few mod's.... I was skeptical about the lemon and used the thyme and fresh rosemary (no parsley, and no lemon except while doing the baby artichokes) and it was fantastic - more mediterranean in flavor. Served with mashed skin-on red potatoes. Everyone wanted the recipe!

Excellent and different with the addition of the lemon peel and artichokes. I did make it a little thicker with cornstarch and added whole petite carrots for show as well as sliced carrots for color because it was a bit bland looking. The Mock Risotto is a keeper too! Very easy and excellent on its own as well as a hearty base for the stew.

This was excellant ! Wonderful lemony taste, used fresh thyme. I wanted to thank the other reviewers who suggested canned artichokes, they worked perfectly fine.

OH MY GOSH!!! I quadrupled this and brought it to a party and it was devoured by all! Served with Tricolored Couscous. The only big change I made was to add a few bay leafs and some Rosemary and to use frozen artichokes instead. The color is pretty bland but with the colorful couscous, it didn't matter!

This was a very good recipe, however it was lacking in color. We also used canned artichokes which were fine and added some fresh carrots for color.

Very tastey and easy. I did not have fresh baby artichokes but canned worked well. The leeks were a great onion alternative and the dish was a lamb pleaser. It also kept well for leftovers!
