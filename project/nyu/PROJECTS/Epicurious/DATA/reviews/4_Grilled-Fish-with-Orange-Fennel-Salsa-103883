Delicious and adaptable! Was great on this March day and would be delectable in summer.

My wife is not a fan of orange anything, but I did change this to suit her... using mandarin orange segments (fresh) so that OJ didn't drip into the rest of the salsa. I also used about half the sugar, threw in red pepper flakes and added at least a tablespoon of nuoc man, fish sauce, which we love. Didn't add any salt because of that. Or pepper, already had the heat from the pepper flakes. The amount of ginger and other chopped up stuff isn't all that important. Just get it chopped and into the salsa. Very tasty on the fish! She skipped the OJ segments. No problem!

This was super easy and fast! It also tasted great and the presentation was very nice. Like other people said, I cooked it for 6 minutes on each side. I didn't make any changes to the recipe, it was perfect as is.

Deeelish! To the salsa, I added 1/2 a zucchini and 1/4 serrano for a little heat.

Very lovely dish with great flavors working together. Would have helped save time if I would have made the salsa ahead of time. I used perch which was super great on the grill. I also dipped my eggplant patties in the coating and grilled that too - wonderful!

Fantastic salsa; the rockfish was a little bland (although perked up by the salsa), so I'll probably try trout in future. I expected my husband (no fan of fruit in savory dishes) to balk at this one, but he really loved it, and it's allowed me to foist other fruit-centered salsas on him (e.g. nectarine salsa, also on this site).

This was so simple and so delicious! I always loved Cashion's when I lived in DC so I am not surprised. I used Indonesian Barramundi because Rockfish was not available and it was terrific. I added finely diced jalapeno to the salsa.

I didn't even use the salsa (just didn't have the ingredients) but the rockfish basted with the soy/olive oil and grilled was exceptional - the fish just melts in your mouth. I also basted zucchini cut in half length-wise with the same mixture and grilled it which was also delicious!

I used Halibut and it was a hit at a summer bbq. This recipe is a keeper

This was a great dinner party dish. The sea bass was delicious. I made the salsa in advance, which is a necessity for a party. The plate looked great.

Excellent! We loved it. The ingredients work beautifully together to make a most memorable dinner. I would highly recommend.

I thought the second time around that it wouldn't be as good. However, everyone wanted the recipe. It's great as a summer recipe, terrific for the bbq and very refreshing. Also the ingredients are virtually guaranteed to be in the cupboard.

I used red wine vinegar, no coriander, white onion and made with a salmon fishcake. OH.MY.GOD. It's so good I would have the portion I've saved for tomorrow! I'd never imagine orange and fennel tasting so good together with fish! Make it now!

We were very, very pleased with this recipe. I used rockfish which were swimming in the Chesapeake Bay the day-before-yesterday. The thick fillets required much more time on the grill than indicated here, about six minuted per side. It also bears mention that oranges have seeds, which are a pain to fish out of the salsa in preparation. I would have complained more about this annoyance, except for the taste of this dish. The highlights were the salsa's wonderful flavor and its perfect complement to the rockfish. My diners, aged ten to forty-five, loved this dish more than any fish I have ever served. Will certainly make this one again.

This was excellent. My husband called it a flavor explosion. We used Mahi. The soy, vinegar, salt, pepper & garlic on the grilled fish were perfect. Girlled the fish a total of 10 minutes. The salsa had a nice crunch with the fennel and the oranges and soy gave it a tangy sweetness. I used flat leaf parsley instead of cilantro and no red onion.

This was a delicious recipe. The flavors of the salsa were so fresh, healthy, but flavorful as well. I used swordfish instead, and made the full amount of salsa even though there were only two of us. There definitely weren't any leftovers. Perfect for a summer evening, with grilled corn and a deliciously chilled Viognier.

The salsa was aweseome. I made the base recipe but added 1/2 jalepeno, finely minced for a bit of added kick. I used fresh rockfish fillets, with skin on. (Here's a trick: to make the skin extra crispy during grilling, scrape it with a knife blade to squeeze as much water out of the skin as possible.) I also served it with the mashed celery potatoes, as recommended by another reviewer. Those were a big hit too.

this was wonderful. the flavor combinations were really delicious. we used some gorgeous chilean sea bass. although there were only two of us, but i made the salsa recipe for 4 as written and there was almost none left.

I made the relish exactly as stated. It was excellent. Very tasty. And very healthy... fennel and oranges have great antioxidant and nutritious qualities. I used grouper (the fish market didn't have rockfish today) which was delicious substitute!

I made this using striped seabass, I took the suggestion from another cook and added cucumber and jalapeno to the salsa it added spice and a crunchy texture. I would use the salsa with lots of other dishes,any mexican dish would benefit from this salsa. Make sure you use enough oranges!

I chose not to use rockfish as I like a fish with a little more substance. I used sushi grade Ahi and it seared it. This was a fantastic combination. As an appetizer I served a mixed green salad with avacado, grapefruit, and crab. I highly recommend this dish... great on the grill!

Used grilled mahi mahi (on sale). Added red pepper. cucumber, jalapeno, leek, napa cabbage to salsa for crunch, color, spice. Served on jasmine rice - excellent!

Very good and simple. Like many, I used Sea Bass. The salsa was fabulous, a bit nutty, a bit sweet. I had large, naval oranges, so I only used 2. Overall, a well-balanced fusion dish that is easy to prepare

This dish was served to mixed reviews. Mahi Mahi would be better served by an orange fennel sauce instead of a salsa.

I drained the orange sections, (drank the juice), reduced the vineger to my usual 4:1 oil to vinegar ratio, decreased the sugar, minced the fennel and onion, and used the fennel stalks as the roasting rack in the broiler to add flavor. Served this on a bed of celery mashed potatoes, http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=10941 also on this website, and garnished with cilantro. Looked like a beautiful restaurant dish. Really good.

This is one of the easiest dishes to prepare and it's flavors are incredible. I used halibut and it worked great. I think this is more of a summer dish, but we still loved it January in Chicago.

I thought the fish and salsa combo was really good. I used sea bass because rock fish isn't available in my area. I marinated the fish a little longer than the recipe directs, because my grill wasn't ready, and the results were delicious.

Deliciously refreshing. Used salmon and served with fennel/leek mashed potatoes. Guests were licking their plates!!

Our neighbor's father is a Captain of a fishing boat on the Cheasapeake Bay. They were kind enough to share some of his recent Rockfish catch. Talk about fresh! Prepared it with this recipe, which is delicious. Next time, I would not make the salsa as juicy. It ran into the other items on the plate. I would also bring the salsa to room temp before serving, because it cooled the fish too much.

My husband and I both loved this. I used petrale sole and it was delicious. It only took about 2 minutes per side. Salsa was great and quick and easy to throw together. My husband says it's a definite serve to guests type of meal. Will try with sea bass next.

This one is clearly a keeper. I used Chilean Sea Bass steaks. They were previously frozen, but you'd not have guessed. The salsa is delicious. Mine was a lot juicier than the one in the picture appears to be, but that was not detrimental to the flavor or appearance.

This is superb! I used rockfish and made the recipe as written, served with couscous and zucchini. I used the fennel and liked the crispness it added to the salsa. Make the salsa ahead of time, and the dish comes together easily.

I served this on New Year's eve as part of a 6 course dinner and it was overwhelmingly favorite course. We used sea bass and substituted the leeks for the fennel. Everyone agreed it was a superb recipe and one to be made many times in the future!!

A most definite winner. I used the sea bass and impressed both husband and friends. This is an easy recipe for entertaining. Making the salsa up ahead of time leaves just a few last minute preparations. You will problably want to bring the salsa up to room temperature before serving if it has been in the fridge.

My store's rockfish didn't look appetizing, so I also used Chilean sea bass. Delicious! Dish would be good served on a bed of couscous, orzo or rice to absorb some of the liquid from the salsa.

I used Halibut I was worred the fennel would be too strong but the soy and orange calmed the taste

Couldn't find fennel at the store, so I used leek instead.The rockfish was fresh caught in Seattle and the dish was delicious. I have alittle bit left over and I am going to try it on grilled chicken breasts.

I've never given 4 forks before. Used Chilean sea bass, which I've made a lot but never grilled before. This was absolutely wonderful. Subtle asian flavor. Rich but not heavy. Really easy to make. You get a lot of bang for your time on this recipe.

We caught fresh Rockfish in the outerbanks and used this recipie less the fennel bulbs, simply because we couldn't get any and it was incredible. We highly reccomend it!!!!
