I baked an extra 30-45 minutes until it reached 150 degrees. Used vanilla instead of almond extract. Excellent cheesecake! I'll make this one again!

This was a huge hit at a superbowl party. I did have to bake the cake 5-10 minutes longer than directed, but it turned out incredibly well. It was very moist and the texture was so silky-smooth, unlike many other low fat cheesecake recipes I've tasted. I will absolutely make this again!

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe!! :( Made it for company and decided not to serve it because it was SO bad... thank goodness for my quick, easy, delicious chocolate pudding recipe!!!!

the best dessert ever! very easy to make for even such an unexperienced cook as myself, and is not loaded with calories as majority of recipes. Although I reduced calories further by using almonds only for the crust. Also, to satisfy various likes, I use a form for 12 mini cheese-cakes - this way, your fantasy is the limit!

I was excited to make this for a dessert themed baby shower I hosted and was disappointed to say the least. It was a mushy mess, and was even cooked well past the suggested time. But I gave it one fork because it tasted great other than a crunchy texture through out. (maybe the bottom crust rOse during baking?) I will try again and maybe have better luck.

huge hit! I added some vanilla extract to the batter as well as the almond extract and used chocolate biscotti for the crust. we just finished it and my fiance is already asking me to make more!

This was so easy to make and so delicious! We had a small dinner party and all the guests loved it and were also delighted to know it was low fat. I served it with a raspberry sauce and it was just lovely!

Neufchatel is none other than 1/3 less fat cream cheese.

Despite the name, neufchatel is not a French but a Swiss cheese. For French people, a good substitute to cream cheese is Kir* or Saint M**ret. Some people also says that you can use the spreading cheese from the hard discounter L**l... Otherwise, since you live in Grenoble, maybe you can do a quick trip to Geneva during a week-end end bring back some Philadelphia...

I think Neufchâtel is equivalent to cream cheese. I plan to make this recipe but haven't yet.

I live in France. What's the best cream cheese substitute? Fromage Blanc?
