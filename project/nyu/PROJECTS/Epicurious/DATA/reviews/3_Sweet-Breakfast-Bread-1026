One word - underwhelmed. I want everything I serve at brunch to shine, and this bread is unremarkable. I am afraid it would serve as filler. But I suppose it is no surprise when you look at the list of ingredients. As one reviewer suggested, I added a tsp of vanilla. Other reviewer suggested adding nuts or dried fruit. Instead, I cut the sugar to 1/2 C and added a fistful of semi-sweet chocolate chip morsels. Still, the bread was very bland. It is moist, and the texture is nice. However, it leaves you like it is missing something. If I make this again, I would add a ton of dried cranberries.

I just made this for Sunday morning coffee hour! I did cut back on the sugar, but next time will take it down to 1/2 c. because my only criticism is that it was just too sweet, easily remedied. I added 2 tsp of cinnamon, which was perfect, 1 tsp of vanilla because I like vanilla, and 1 c. crushed walnuts. We thoroughly enjoyed the taste. We ate it warm with cream cheese. It has a very nice crunchy top and a very moist texture. It was very easy and I will definitely make it again. Something tells me it would be good with buttermilk in place of the milk...And by the way, just because something is sweet doesn't make it a cake and not a sweet bread. It's a good old baked-good!!

Who are we kidding here, this is not 'Bread.' It is cake. There is absolutely no need for a whole cup of sugar. I reduced it to 1/2 and it was still sweet. Add some raisins and cranberries, and some nutmeg. It's tasty and very nice served with a little butter and a slice of sharp cheddar on top. But not bread. Cake.

So easy, entire family loved it. Can't image not having every ingredient on hand. Great with yogurt and fruit for breakfast.

This was so easy and yummy!I was craving something sweet but didn't have a lot of ingredients on hand so I thought I'd try this and LOVED it. Added more spice,and vanilla as others suggested along with orange zest -definitely a keeper!

This was good but I added 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1/2 cup of raisins and some walnuts - definitely cut back the sugar especially if you add raisins or other fruit - it was really sweet. But moist, simple to make and came out very well. A bit greasy too but very yummy

Ugh- this recipe was pretty bad. It was chewy and just plain weird. I wouldn't recommend it.

This recipe is OK. It is nothing special and rather bland. However I think kids would like it because it is sweet and doesn't have anything they would find objectionable. Would only recommend this if you are looking for a very plain sweet treat.

good and easy..and appears to be a great base for experimentation. i used half splenda and half sugar. had been looking for an easy baking recipe with cheap ingredients to try sugar substitute. turned out fine, crumb might have been a little more coarse, and loaf didn't brown as much. a good try. other spices and ideas sound good too for another go. also, didnt take an hour to cook, more like 50 minutes.

Terrific. Quick & easy, I increased the cinnamon, added nutmeg & cut back on the sugar just a little bit.

Wonderful! I followed the reviewers suggestion of adding allspice and nutmeg, and really liked it. I also tried the other suggestion of adding vanilla and almond extract and didn't care for it as much. Very easy to make. Would definitely make this recipe again.

Nice and simple. I would make this for family on a spontaneous moment because the ingredients are so readily available. Nothing special, but it turned out tender and it has just the right amount of sweetness. Be careful not to overbake it. Make them guess the secret ingredient until they figure out there isn't one.

I changed this recipe slightly by adding vanilla (1 TBS) and almond extract (1/2 tsp.) I also used soy milk instead of cows milk. Very easy to make and quite good. Will definitely make this one again.

My friend and I make this every time I spend the night at her house. We also figured out how much easier it is to use a bread machine with it. Just put the dry ingredients in first and then the wet. It turns out the same. You can still sprinkle on the cinnamon sugar on it. Yet, put it on when it is still soft, or else the cinnamon sugar goes all over the counter and floor.

I've made this a few times already because It's very easy and everybody loves it. The people in my office request it now. I've added a dash of allspice and nutmeg to it and it comes out nice.
