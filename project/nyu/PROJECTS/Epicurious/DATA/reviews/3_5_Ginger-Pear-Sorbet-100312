After freezing as solid as possible; I put a serving size scoop into a small plastic bag and form into a pear shape. I flatten the bottom (so it can stand on its own) and re-freeze upright.Before serving I peel off baggie a few (really few) minutes before serving. I use a toothpick to make a hole in the top and insert a mint sprig. If the "pear" has creases from the plastic, as you unmold, you can smooth them out because of surface melting. Nice with spice/honey cake.

This was great - thanks to the reviewers who came before me. Doubled the recipe, but only used 1/4 C sugar. Used 3 T ginger, 2 t zested lime peel, and juice of 1 lime. Might reduce sugar a bit still - but a big hit & will make again. Mint garnish didn't work.

I made this sorbet several years ago, and have since "re-discovered" it. It's an easy, make-ahead, light dessert which is perfect after a big meal. I usually add a bit more ginger. We've never had left-overs when serving this to guests!

Want frozen baby food for dessert? Make this! YUCK! So bland, ginger favor was barely there, and when I added more it was to strong for the bland pear taste. Don't waste your time. It's not easy if it turns out to be a total waste of time.

This one was everybodies favorite-out of four sorbets I made for company. Nice bite with the ginger, but sweet and creamy. My best rating for this one-very easy to make.

To me, this was so fabulous - it doesn't get much better (unless chocolate is involved, but that's a different story). This was really rich and creamy & so easy to make. I cut down on the sugar by half and it was the perfect sweetness for me. I also doubled the ginger b/c I adore ginger. I garnished it with little pieces of crystallized ginger that I had left over. Mmmmm!

This is a sensational hit! Easy as can be and flavor that stops company mid bite to ask for the secret. I will make it over and over...and never tell how easy it is.

This was a great ending to our Thanksgiving day meal. Everyone loved it. And it is so easy!!!! I increased thee ginger and lemon and it tasted wonderful. Would reduce the sugar a lot, though. it's especially good garnished with mint sprigs.

This is so easy to make, I make it all the time now! I never got it to freeze as solid as I would like, but I think that's because my freezer just isn't very cold. At any rate, it tastes great even if it's still a little mushy, and it's perfect for those of us without an ice cream maker!

This sorbet was one of many I made for a dessert event. This was, byfar, one of the desserts most preffered by my guests. Even later, as the sorbet began to melt, this one was sipped as well as spooned up! I now get requests to bring it with me asmy contribution to a party. I'll kep this one in the freezer to always have ready.

This recipe was so successful at a barbecue that when I went to retrieve my container, I found one of the guests eating the last drops directly out of the bowl! I managed to make do with a blender instead of a food processor, although I did need to chop the frozen pear mixture rather finely first. I also reduced the sugar and doubled the ginger, which I might increase further the next time around. I'm keeping tubs of this in my freezer to last me the rest of the summer.

A sorbet recipe that doesn't require an ice cream maker? Great! I decreased sugar to 1T, doubled the ginger, and used the zest from 1 whole lemon, and it was just right. Refreshing, light, creamy, easy. I let it sit in the freezer for days and my Cuisinart handled it just fine.

Excellent! I would not change a thing. It's so easy that I am reluctant to give out the recipe - let everyone think that I spent much more time in preparing this refreshing dessert!

I served this as a palate refresher between courses, so I used only 1 teaspoon of sugar. I increased the lemon rind and squeezed in about a tablespoon of lemon juice. In addition, I substituted finely grated fresh ginger (to taste) for the candied version. I have always made sorbet in the usual 'ice cream maker' manner. So I was quite surprised at the perfect texture and consistency that was produced using this technique. I attribute this in part to the consistency of canned pears. It got rave reviews and everyone wanted the recipe. I was almost embarrassed to tell them how simple it was.

I'm not a dessert person, so I would opt not to make this again. Otherwise, it was a good dessert after a heavy meal. It's basically frozen pears, so if you would like a more complex taste, go with the extra ginger and the lemon juice. I did, and it was still mostly pear. The texture was nice, however, and although it at first seemed mushy when I took it out of the freezer at exactly 6 hours, the mushiness translated nicely to a sorbet consistency. My guests liked the dessert, but one also had regular ice cream afterwards.

What a refreshing and easy recipe! I received rave reviews at my gourmet dining club meeting. After reading past reviews, I did double the amount of crystallized ginger and added a couple of tablespoons of fresh lemon juice, pureed ingredients and made it in my ice cream maker for quick results. Turned out great!

This has become one of my favorite desserts to make because it's so easy, yet everyone always raves about it and thinks it was much harder to make than it actually was. It's flavorful and has a surprisingly creamy texture, and it's about as light and healthful as desserts go. Like the other cooks, I do increase the ginger (I'm basically addicted to crystallized ginger) and get rid of the sugar altogether; it's way too sweet otherwise. Also, I find it freezes too hard if it sits in the freezer for a while, so I try not to make it too far ahead.

Although this was very easy to make and the texture was very nice, the flavor was too bland and a bit flat -- too sweet; not enough tartness to balance it. It needs more ginger and most definitely needs some lemon juice, in addition to the rind. I'm going to make it again and add about a tablespoon of lemon juice (and possibly cut down a little on the sugar) and hope that will bring it up to three or four stars.

This is a fantastic recipe. Remarkably easy to prepare, flavorful, and light. Everyone we've served it to has enjoyed it and asked for the recipe. I usually make extra to have some on hand.

I nearly threw this one out when it didn't freeze solid...but, I threw it in the food processer anyway and the texture was just perfect. If the pears freeze solid but the liquid is a bit mushy, it is still ok. It could use a bit more ginger for a bit more bite.
