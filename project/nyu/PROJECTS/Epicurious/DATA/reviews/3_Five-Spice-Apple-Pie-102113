I cook many apple pies this time of year and I have to say this one was very good! I liked how the crust turned out, brushing it with the cream and sugar made it very flaky and crisp. High altitude included 2tbsp extra flour just to be safe. I was so nervous about the sauce for the apples, it seemed 15 minutes was too long, mine thickened in 5-6 adding almost a caramel coating on the apples that wasn't too sweet. The spice was just right, I was tempted to add cinnamon, but glad I didn't! I am going to make this pie again!

This is a wonderful recipe, yet the 5 spice is a bit too much. Good cooks can substitue for it though.

This pie has become a favorite to my friends and family,it´s delicious!!! the five spice powder it´s a must,if you can´t find,make your own with supermarket varieties (ginger,cinnamon.nutmeg and both anises)and I use about 5 large apples instead...also,I´m not a fan of Crisco,so I make a butter crust and it gets better.

I used about 3 1/2 lbs of apples, didn' peel them which just worked fine. Substituted ghee (clarified butter) for a great butter flavor ( don't like crisco). Overall, this was nice but not exactly memorable.

Time consuming but worth it. Makes a VERY GOOD pie. I did have the same problem as others, with too many apples and not enough crust. Next time I will make more crust and use a 10" pie pan.

Maybe it was just a bad recipe day, but this was a disaster! 5lbs. of apples was way too much, the crust wouldn't fit...I ended up deciding that I would just substitute some 5 spice powder instead of cinnamon in my tried and true version.

I'm not a big fan of apple pie but the five spices intrigued me. Before this, the only pies I'd ever made were pumpkin. I've also never made a crust from scratch before. My Thanksgiving guests loved the crust, the spices and raved about this, my first attempt at an apple pie.

My family really enjoyed this pie. I was looking for a recipe where you cook the apples on the stove to provide a good consistency for the filling -- this worked out very well. Rather than making more crust as suggested by Susan, I used fewer apples: about 3 1/2 lbs instead of 5 lbs. This also worked out very well. I made both filling and pastry a day ahead, which worked out great since both are to be cooled before baking anyway.

You will be invited back if you bring this pie to a friends home. This was the first apple pie that I have made where you cook the apples on the stove. I would suggest to anyone making it, to make more crust because the recipe does not cover the pie due to the amount of apples.
