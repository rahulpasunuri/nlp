This is a typical Jell-o recipe. As such it tastes like Jell-o. I prefer whipped cream from a spray can (Cabot) to whipped topping. Clearly, this is not a gourmet dessert - but Jell-o is definitely an American food icon.

So I was amazed to see the directions from the side of a Jell-O box typed up onto a recipe and placed on Epicurious. What a waste of server space! And prepared whipped topping?!? Then I noticed that the recipe is from Parade magazine - more reasons not to subscribe to that publication. Off to search for something more worth of fresh berries...

Incredible and simple recipe. Load them up with plenty of Raspberries and Blueberries and be the star. Perfect for hot lazy summer days.
