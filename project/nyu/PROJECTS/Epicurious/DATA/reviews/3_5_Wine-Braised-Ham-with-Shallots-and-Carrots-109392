Made this for Easter - turned out really wonderful! Someone mentioned mushy veggies - mine were almost undercooked. Didn't matter - great flavor and I'll definitely make it again.

I varied this recipe somewhat and it was exceptional. One reviewer commented that the vegies were mushy. That is an advantage if, instead of serving them on the side, you push through the carrots/ shallots through a seive (or food mill) into the sauce -- the carrots added gorgeous color and flavor. The wine-braising really makes this ham succulent and mild-tasting. Truly delicious.

While the Ham was quite fantastic, the resulting sauce was not very good tasting. I suspect it may have been the mustard/apricot combination. I personally prefer a sweeter glaze served with a sweet citrus/golden raisin/apricot sauce cooked until thickened with corn starch. Much better flavor.

This is very good. The sauce is not over powering but a nice compliment to the ham. The vegetable are nice and caramalized. Would make again.

A very different way with ham. The sauce was a big hit with the Easter crowd. I also did the mashed potatoes with tarragon and chives which also went over well. I will definitely do this one again.

I thought this was definitely a better way to do a ham rather than the standard brown-sugar-style. I found that using an old oval roaster of my grandmothers (that has a lid!) was much easier than trying to tent the ham with foil without touching the ham. The sauce is the best part.

I made this recipe for Easter. I thought the ham was so-so, but sauce was excellent. Ham isn't all that exciting to me anyway, but this dish was much better, updated version of plain ham. The sauce was very good. I don't usually make sauces with cream, but I lightened the cream to whipping cream and found it 'just right'. The vegetables were a little overcooked to my liking though. I would describe the sauce and flavors as light and delicate. This is not a full-flavored, robust dish, but quite good. I served it with roasted asparagus and mashed potatoes. I would make it for Easter again.
