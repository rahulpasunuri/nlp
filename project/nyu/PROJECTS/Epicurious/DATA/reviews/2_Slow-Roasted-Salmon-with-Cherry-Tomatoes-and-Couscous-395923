I thought it was good, but added a diced yellow+red pepper and red onion, a good dash of balsamic vinegar, and fried up some garlic till soft in the the olive oil. The presentation was more colorful, extra textures and fresh flavors.

With a few tweaks, this was fabulous! I always read reviews, so thanks to those who gave ideas. The couscous would have been bland without shallots and I also added sauteed mushrooms. I used the tomatoes separately, as the recipe called for (sauteed them lightly before) and also added more cherry tomatoes, asparagus, canned artichoke hearts and mushrooms to the roasting. INCREDIBLE! my boyfriend loved it and we are still eating it! I did, as someone suggested, turn the oven up to 350 degrees and it cooked in 25 minutes or less. OH! I made the yogurt sauce more like tsaziki (sp?) with the addition of more dill, garlic and cucunmber and it was great. Using it as a dip now for days!

I made this for friends while at the beach, used Copper River salmon. It was delightful. My friends are big salmon fans, they loved it! The dill and thyme made the house smell wonderful. The fish was moist, flaky and had a great flavor. I am making it again tomorrow for my friends birthday. I will try the sauce and couscous tomorrow as well.

I am upset that bon appetite would put a recipe on the cover that was so unimportant. I am a "foodie" and it worries me, frankly! Have had a lot of misses lately....rather go to epicurious.com for reliable recipes and comments I trust. Am doing better with the NY Times Wed dining in/out section of paper than the magazine I love. The recipe is fine at room temp or cold, the cous cous is just boring. As others have commented, I will use the yogurt sauce again but add a bit more pepper flakes.

I made this recipe for my book group and it was delicious. I skipped the couscous. The salmon was very tender and flavorful, and the yogurt sauce was very nice. This is a healthy and lovely recipe.

The only part I would do again are the roasted tomatoes. Next time I would grill the salmon, add some cucumber, mint and cayenne to the sauce and add some shallot to the couscous.

The roasted cherry tomato turned out Yum. Coucous was just ok. Should have added chopped shallot. This was my first time using za'atar and I am not a fan. It tasted like dried oregano. The sesame seeds in the mix had no chance against the strong sumac/oregano flavor.

The herbs under the fish did not contribute anything to flavor or even scent the kitchen during cooking. What a waste. The yogurt sauce was good, but needed something. Minced cucumber, maybe? The slow cooking method did not work for us. We had fresh wild king salmon, not sure if that affected the method. We ended up raising the temp to 400 to get the job done.

This was very disappointing. I did not use the za'atar which was optional, but the couscous definitely needed something more. The bed of herbs for the salmon did not seem to affect he taste of the salmon much - but it did smell nice while cooking. The yogurt sauce was great and I will use it again. We cook salmon frequently but I won't try this again
