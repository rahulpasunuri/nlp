LOVED this recipe. I'm rosemary obsessed and wonder why I never thought of this combination. I chopped up the rosemary leaves and used corriander seeds, whole pepper and course sea salt which I coursely ground using a mortar & pestle. The spice bits gave a wonderful kick to the nuts and the butter just smooths out the flavours.

Fantastic nut recipe! I used roasted/salted Marcona almonds from Costco and it worked great. Good mix of sweet/spicy (cut down the cayenne if you don't want a considerable kick). Yes, it did take a LONG time for the sugar to remelt, but well worth the effort as the crunch is perfect. Definitely keep stirring during the second cook time or the nuts will burn, especially if you use pre-roasted ones. This will be holiday gift-giving next year!

I tried this recipe without the pecans and just used regular almonds I had on hand. It turned out very well. I love the rosemary, and cayenne flavor. I agree it is very time consuming, all of the stirring and more stirring! I like the idea of candied almonds and the flavors, but will look for another recipe in the future to make these again.

Pretty good, but it was really time-consuming to make. Not to mention a lot of pot-washing. Other candied nut recipes I've made were easier and equally good, although the smoked almonds do add a tasty and unusual flavor for this kind of thing. Followed the recipe exactly except for using regular almonds in place of Marcona almonds. My only change would be to add salt with the other spices - if it's added at the end per the recipe, it doesn't stick. Despite the smoked almonds, it did need salt.
