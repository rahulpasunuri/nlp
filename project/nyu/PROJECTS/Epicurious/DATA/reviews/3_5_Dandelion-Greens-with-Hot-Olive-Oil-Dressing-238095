I wanted to try dandelion greens for the first time, as I had bought a bunch for our new pet tortoises. I didn't have sherry vinegar, so I used malt vinegar and a tiny splash of sherry. The dish was good but not great - maybe our greens were too old or bitter?

This is definitely a keeper recipe that is completely flexible with your pantry. I have also made this with pecans and cranberries and it was great. I agree with other reviewer to add more sugar if your greens are really bitter.

This was great! Due to last-minute decision to make this dish (from dandelions from my lawn), I had to use craisins instead of raisins and balsamic vinegar instead of sherry. It was fabulous. Love it. Makes me grateful for my weed-ridden lawn.

Wow - this was delicious! There were no left overs. I did leave out the almonds due to allergies and it was still great!

Using red wine vinegar and pine nuts was delicious. My greens were especially bitter so I increased the sugar by an extra teaspoon. Great!

Very tasty. The warm oil, the nuts and the raisins balance out the bitterness of the greens, leaving just enough tang.

YUM! Never had dandelion greens before. Knew they had a rep for being bitter but the sherry vinegar and the dried cranberries I subbed for the raisins tamed that. Absolutely delicious!

So delicious!! I wasn't sure what to do with the dandelion greens I picked up from my local farmer's market. Initially, I didn't think I'd like them because they were so bitter, however the sherry vinegar, raisins and sugar balanced out the bitterness perfectly. (I used dried cranberries, by the way, as I didn't have any raisins.) This recipe is going into heavy rotation!

Very good recipe for dandelion greens. The warm dressing did not make the greens seem bitter. I also like the fact that this is not bacon-based, as most of the dressings for dandelion greens are. I substituted dried tart cherries for the raisins. Very tasty.

excellent! Used chopped dried apricots in place of raisins. A chef guest explained -- get the almonds just about right BEFORE adding garlic, so as not to burn the garlic.

This was delicious! Great balance of the bitter greens, sweet raisins (I had currants), sugar, and the tangy vinegar, and nutty almonds. Yum yum!!

This is a great recipe for dandelion greens. We get these from our CSA and if it weren't for this recipe I don't think we would eat them.

I thought this was a great recipe! It came together quickly and was a great way to add some sweetness to the bitter greens. I also added some feta cheese and garlic-bread- croutons, and it was delicious! I will definitely make this again.

I saw dandelion greens at the grocery store and decided to give them a try. Without the dressing, they tasted quite bitter, and I was worried the bitterness will persist in the salad, but I could not taste it at all. On the contrary, I found the salad very sweet because of the raisins. Next time I will use less than the recipe calls for. I agree with the previous reviewer that it is hard to brown the almonds without burning the garlic.

I really like this, but the greens are quite bitter, so it's not for everyone. Also, you really have to be careful to brown the almonds but not burn the garlic, so it's kind of a tough recipe in some ways.

Flavorful and easy dressing, I only used one clove of garlic and added some sliced pear to the salad. I've used baby arugula and baby spinach as well with equally good results.
