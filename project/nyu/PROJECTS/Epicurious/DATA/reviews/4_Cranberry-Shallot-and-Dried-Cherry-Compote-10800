I love this recipe...I make it every year. it is the perfect accompaniment to turkey although it would also be great with pork. Follow the recipe exactly and you won't be disappointed. It's one of the things that makes Thanksgiving dinner special.

Eh. I followed this recipe to the letter, which I almost never do. It was good, but not great. It really needs something else, maybe an herb or something (walnuts for texture/dimension?) to put it into the realm of greatness.

Definately great after 2 days in the fridge. It's perfect after that on turkey!

Having experimented with numerous relish and compotes that were good but not exciting, I discovered this one. Fabulous! It received rave reviews not only this Thanksgiving but last night as an accompaniment to brisket & latkes. The only change I made was instead of using water, I added more white wine with the cranberries. I had some inexpensive white wine and it worked perfectly.

This is the very best cranberry sauce. I too have made it every year since it appeared and every year it's a hit. I consider it a necessity for Thanksgiving.

My mother just this year "passed the torch" to me for Thanksgiving dinners so this was my first one, and to my relief it was a total success! This was the first time our family has had anything but the standard cranberry sauce, and it was a hit. My new father-in-law is the chef at Gibson's in Chicago, he was here for Thanksgiving and I swear he had four helpings of this side dish. It will be a Thanksgiving staple in my house from now on.

We have made this wonderful cranberry recipe at Thanksgiving every year since it appeared in Gourmet in 1995. It is my favourite item in our Thanksgiving menu. When I can't get the dried sour cherries, I substitute dried sweet cherries and cut the sugar just a little with good results. Try to get small shallots!

This has become a Thanksgiving favorite! It's so tart and wonderful, a great side dish.

This is by far the BEST cranberry recipe ever! I will make this for many holidays to come.

This disk has become part of the Thanksgiving tradition in our house. It takes cranberry to a new, interesting, level.

Although dried cherries are a little on the pricy side it is worth making this dish. The tang of the cranberries with the slight sweetness of the cherries offset by the taste of the shallots will this a Thanksgiving hit - even for those with more "traditional" tastes.
