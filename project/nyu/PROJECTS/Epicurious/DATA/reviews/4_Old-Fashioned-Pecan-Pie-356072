I have made this pie twice, and accidentally improved on the recipe by using dark brown sugar instead of light brown. I substituted the dark because I was out of light, and I was astonished at the difference in flavor. I also check this pie at 45 minutes, as I think it gets too brown if it bakes any longer in my oven. I use broken pecans rather than halves for two reasons: the broken nuts are less expensive, and it is easier to cut through the top of the pie. This is now efinitive recipe for pecan pie.

I don't like pecan pie, but I realized Thanksgiving morning that it's my father-in-law's favorite! I looked this recipe up online and decided to give it a try. I already had several crusts made up, so I used one of those instead of the included pastry recipe. This pie was super easy to make, and everyone loved it! It's already been requested for next year.

Made this for DH's birthday last weekend (my second time using this recipe) and it was even better than I remembered it. I left out the zest but otherwise followed exactly. Very, very good. He claimed it the best pie he's ever had! I used the butter pie crust recipe as well, which turned out very flaky and delicious because I managed not to overprocess it for once.

I made this pie over Thanksgiving. The first one was gone in a matter of minutes. I had to make another one for the next day. Easy and great.

I absolutely love this pie!!!! I make it for every special occasion (i.e thanksgiving, birthdays, etc.) and sometimes just for fun and its pure deliciosity. An absolute must-make!!!!!

My Thanksgiving guests raved about this pie. They left the pumpkin pies untouched and came back for seconds of the pecan pie. And they talked about it for days after. How's that for an endorsement?

For whatever reason, I have made better pecan pies in the past with other recipes. The consistency of this one wasn`t my favorite. What I will take away from this recipe, however, is the idea of adding orange zest. I will absolutely do that from now on. Great addition.

Incredibly easy to make and SO delicious. I was short on time so I used a pre-made pie crust and it was perfection.

First time I've ever made pecan pie and it turned out great! I admit I used pre-made dough (still new to the pie making process and wanted to focus on the filling first). Also used toasted chopped pecans for filling and added toasted pecan halves on top in a circle (looks pretty!). I had rave reviews from the two biggest pecan pie lovers at the dinner. Made the day before and allowed to set overnight. It was perfectly set. Might follow another reviewer's suggestion of using bourbon next time but honestly, this was a lovely pie (also, didn't have any of the problems some had with too much filling - mine was the perfect amount).

This was BY FAR the best pecan pie ever! The orange zest added a brightness to the filling that was awesome. The filling set up perfectly and the crust was nice and light. This will be a staple on my holiday menu from now on!

This pie is easy to make and delicious... Classic I suppose... but lacked that special something to make it a 4 fork-er. Also the consistency didn't quite achieve the hard gel I like. I might try a Maple or Bourbon variety next time. It's VERY SWEET. I served with home made vanilla whipped cream.

I forgot to mention that I added more pecans. I actually have a 10-inch deep dish pie plate and am sure I used at least an extra cup of pecan halves.

Made this and it was OUTSTANDING! I did not have the citrus on hand, so I skipped it. I know, blasphemous... BUT HAVE MERCY, it was good!

This was very tasty and I will make it again. Some of my guests complained that there was too much goop and not enough pecans, but I think they're crazy! I wasn't sure what "set" meant...I left it in 10 minutes longer because it still seemed liquidy. But when it cooled it was solid enough. So for a pie like this it may be that set does not mean firm. My only problem (not the recipe's) was that I ended up with a somewhat crumbly pie crust. I have been having trouble w/ crusts lately...it's like I lost my touch. I did a little reading and I may be overmixing. I'm using a food processor. So next time I'm going try and stop at pea size, and incorporate the water outside the food processor. If you have any advice, let me know.

I'm not sure why they call this the Old-Fashioned Pecan Pie, but delicious it is! The base for the filling is a bit darker than usual and the addition of the orange zest gives a nice unexpected surprise at first bite. Keep the recipe as it is and enjoy! (I'm feeling guilty now, so I have to admit I used a store-bought pie crust, Shhhh!)

Wow! This pie is a winner. I made it for Christmas dinner and it was a hit. I reduced the brown sugar by 1/4 cup. The orange zest really makes this pie outstanding.

Wow! Everyone loved this pie. All the flavors really stood out. The vanilla works really well with the orange and the pecans. I cheated and used pre-made pie crusts as I needed the pies done quickly. If you decide to cheat as I did, I doubled the recipe and should have used a deep dish 9" crusts as I filled two regular crusts to the very top and had a lot of filling to spare

Fantastic recipe! Using the brown sugar in lieu of standard granulated sugar (recommended by some recipies) makes a BIG difference. I agree that the orange zest adds just the punch it needs. I did add a tablespoon of corn starch and it set wonderfully.

The best pecan pie I've made. Do not be tempted to skip the orange zest - that's what makes this recipe so delicious!

The half nuts do make it a little difficult to cut the pie, but we liked the really nutty flavor. The custard is really nice. The whole pie went very quickly after a big dinner. We didn't have ice cream or whipped cream.

Deeeeelish and super easy to make. I cheated and used Pillsbury pie crust. Have made three of them this holiday season and there are NEVER any leftovers!! A dollop of homemade whipped cream (gonna try coffee liqueur whipped cream next!) - excellent!

Probably the best pecan I've ever had. The tint of orange peel is fantastic.

We made this pie for the first time Thanksgiving 2010. It was outstanding and quite simple. We loved the addition of the orange zest - it cut some of the over sweet taste that typical pecan pie can have. Make sure to make the pie the day before serving so that the pie has time to set. I would recommend warming the pie before serving and putting a small scoop of vanilla ice cream on the top of each slice. It's hard to keep my fork out of the rest of the pie now that Thanksgiving is over!

I accidentally put in less brown sugar than called for (3/4 cup, same amount as the syrup - I misread the recipe), skipped the orange zest, subbed bourbon for most of the vanilla, and added a bit more salt - this was the first pecan pie I ever made and the best I've ever had. They are usually too sweet for me, but with the mistake on the sugar amount, this was just perfect!! I plan to make this as little bite-size tarts (I use a mini- muffin pan and a biscuit cutter for the pastry) for holiday parties this season. Yum!

Very good and easy. My cousin made it for Thanksgiving after I found the recipe since she really wanted one for the day. It was my first Pecan slice of pie and this will not be my last. Excellent taste, texture, quality.

The filling was more like a caramel with nuts stuck in it. Definitely not soft enough. Did I do something wrong? Will try it again in a tart shell. The whole pie presentation just does not work for me with such a rich filling. Also, I felt leaving all the nuts whole was too crunchy for me, next time I will crush half of the nuts. Cutting sugar might be a good idea too. Overall, a good pie, but the pumpkin pie went right away at a party, while this one was lingering on the counter, go figure.

Great recipe! I'd never made pecan pie before, and this was so easy. I cut the brown sugar by 1/4 cup (it just seemed like a LOT of sweetness to me....) and added a drop of almond extract. Turned out perfectly!

Excellent Pie! I made it exactly as directed and everyone loved it. The hint of orange really made the difference. Typically pecan pies can be a bit rich. The orange flavor cut that down a bit so we could all enjoy the pie without ice-cream.

I've always struggled with pecan pie - too runny, too hard, just not right. This one was perfect. Didn't do the zest - just a bit of vanilla. It's the perfect proportion of syrup, sugar, butter, and eggs for the optimal texture. It served up pretty as a picture.

This pie was awesome! The easiest pie I ever made and very good. Everyone loved it. I didn't put the zest in, but I followed the recipe exact. I didn't have time to make my own crust, so I just used a pre-made one. It was still really good. Most people eat pecan pie in the fall, and for me it's a year round pie. It's so good, I can't just have it once a year!

Fabulous and classic! Didn't use orange zest because I didn't have any. Used 1/2 cup light corn syrup and 1/4 cup dark corn syrup. Other than that, made it as written using the suggested pastry dough. The filling was rich, but not too sweet. The best pecan pie I've had in a very long time.

I made this pie for Christmas dinner this year and it got rave reviews. My brother-in-law, who is from the South and knows his pecan pie, said this was the "best pecan pie" he's ever had. I made a butter pie crust dough (Bon Appetit Nov. 2003), which will now be my "go to" pie dough. I also used 1/2 cups of light corn syrup and 1/4 dark corn syrup to boost the richness. I toasted the pecans first and used 1/2 - 3/4 tsp Grand Marnier instead of the zest. The flavor was amazing!

I am pecan pie convert because of this recipe. I used my own dough, omitted the zest because I didn't have any, and definitely protected the edges of the crust. Am going to make another right now...

unlike another reviewer i should have covered the outside crust, it was too brown causing me to cut short the cooking time which made it a little runny. the taste was excellent.

Made this this the day before Thanksgiving and it turned out well. I used about 1/2 teaspoon Grand Marnier instead of the zest and thought it worked well. Also used 1/2 dark and 1/2 lite corn syrup. Made my own crust and served with homemade whipped cream. Seemed pretty popular with the guests and is one of the better pecan pie recipes I have tried.

Beautiful pie! I used Pillsbury deep dish crust, dark Karo syrup and omitted the zest. I did create a crust guard out of aluminum foil. It is delicious and so easy to make!

The smell of this pie while it's baking is divine! I couldn't wait to get it out of the oven. Not only is it delicious, but it bakes up giving an excellent presentation. I suggest using the Butter Pie Crust Dough recipe for the pastry dough. I didn't think I'd like the orange zest, so I left it out.

P.S.: the upside: my mother and I have been baking pecan pies for years, and this one was THE most beautiful pecan pie we've ever seen. Bake it to impress (but like I said, just make sure to serve the day after)! I baked it to the maximum time recommended, using a deep dish freezer pie crust from the store and did not put aluminum foil on the exposed crust to protect it from burning.

1.) This is best the day after baking.It needs time to set. 2.) I used Trader Joe's organic deep dark brown sugar, and the pie as a result was extra molasses-y. I'll use light brown next time. 3.) make sure to use Karo corn syrup, not an off brand. 4.) Go light on or omit the zest. I tend to like zest, but for this particular old fashioned pecan pie, it does better with 1/4 tsp or without.
