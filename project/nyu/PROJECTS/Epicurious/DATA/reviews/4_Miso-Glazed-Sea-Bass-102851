I made this recipe for the first time and prepared it with Sea Bass and Sable (Black Cod) simultaneously. I marinated it for 6 hours, because my fish was super thick. I also utilized Splenda brown sugar with half the calories. The recipe came out amazing and it was so easy! I will definitely try this again with other white fish as the sea bass is $28 lb. The Sable fish is about $14 a lb and just as good.

I have made this marinade dozens of times, and it is a always delicious and easy. I often substitute rice vinegar for the sake and it comes out just delicious. I use to marinate tofu, chicken or fish which I then pan fry and then simmer the marinade (sometimes add a pinch of flour) to serve as a sauce. I serve over rice with whatever fresh herbs I have on hand (chive, basil, parsley, etc.) Excellent recipe and a winner in my home for many years!

I love this recipe and make it a few times a month. Super easy to put together the marinade and then very fast to cook. If I don't have sake on hand I substitute rice wine vinegar. You can use this marinade on tofu, fish, or chicken. I usually reserve the marinade for sauce - I cook it on high heat while mixing in about 1 tsp of cornstarch to thicken it. Makes a great dipping sauce especially for the tofu version. Serve with rice and a green vegetable and you're done!

I would recommend marinating for longer than 2 hours. Our sea bass was was very thick and the marinade didnt really absorb into the fish. May reccomend reserving some of the marinade prior to putting the fish in and cooking off for a light drizzle when serving. Good but not as good as I was expecting.

Prepared with Sea Bass and Atlantic Salmon simultaneously, and would give an edge to the Bass for buttery-miso excellence. Had the Salmon been by itself with nothing to compare to, it would have been exceptional in its own right. Served this to family, but will definitely put into the "entertaining" rotation. Saw someone say they reduced the sauce and I might try reserving 1/4 of the sauce before the fish goes in, reducing it way down, and then very lightly drizzling fish once it is on the plate. Served with Baby Bok Choy and Jasmine Rise.

I am not going to rate this because I just used the glaze. I cooked it on the stove to get it syrupy and then used it over salmon made with the "Crispy-Skin Fish" from this sight. It was INSANE. It tastes like salmon skin roll sushi gone totally mad and perfect. Try it.

Literally one of the best recipes on this site. Yes, chilean sea bass is not the most sustainable fish you can eat, though whole foods sells a sustainable one. yes, it's eye-bleedingly expensive. for both reasons, it's not something you should eat every day, but for a special occasion, this is AWESOME. the only note is watch very carefully under the broiler  because of the sugar, it can burn easily, and it certainly would be a bummer to burn $60 worth of fish. and for the love god, do NOT use vinegar as a sub! the whole flavor profile would be thrown off by that.

This recipe is wonderful! I had never cooked with Sake or Miso before and was so pleased with the dish. It is better than I've had at restaurants. This is a very special dish.

WOW! I used salmon, only because I couldn't get fresh sea bass. Apparently sea bass is now an endangered fish. I chose salmon because we love it as sashimi. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. Very easy to prepare. Definitely this is a keeper.

My local supermarket is xenophobic and did not have Mirin, so I substituted Seasoned Rice Vinegar. I also used reduced salt soya sauce,cilantro in place of the green onions and fresh basil, red miso paste, and added a 1-1/2 inch cube of peeled finely grated ginger. We had halibut instead of sea bass. As a garnish I had toasted sesame seeds and sprinkled them liberally before serving. The dish had a subtle earthiness that my family enjoyed. We would have it again.

Love this recipe. It's very easy and you would pay lots of money at a nice restaurant. I do leave the basil out tho. Goes well with a Baby Bock Choy-Shitake Stirfry or sometimes I cook Crab Fried Rice with this. Yummy

I will keep this recipe and use it for less expensive fish, say sable fish or rock cod. I used beautiful fresh Monterey Bay sea bass that was too thick to broil, so I baked it. I have to say that it was not particularly succulent, and would be better with an oily fish. Am slightly saddened that I used $27 worth of fresh caught sea bass. Be sure and garnish with the green onions and basil to add an extra dimension. I served it with a tomato salad, baby bok choy with shitake mushrooms, and coconut mashed yams. Very nice, but I wanted to really knock the socks off my visiting son and that didn't happen. Skip using the marinade later as a sauce, it becomes too intense. Recipe is still a keeper though.

Rating: 2
I had really high hopes for this dish based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I followed the recipe to the letter. The fish was cooked to perfection - flaky and moist - but did not care for the sauce. I cooked the fish with only the marinade clinging to the fish after a 1-hour marinade. I reduced the marinade and put only a small amount on the fish when served as it did not look very appetizing. I'll go back to the Martha Stewart recipe for Miso Glazed Cod (can substitute any similar fish). It was even worse as leftovers - $42 for 4 6-oz. filets! I really wanted like this!

I used a white miso because that was what I had on hand (only variance from the recipe), but it was still fantastic! Husband LOVES this dish every time I make it. I can't believe what a stroke of brilliance the chef must have had to create something so tasty, yet so incredibly simple. Amazing!! Another note, cook the fish just until it starts to caramelize at the corners. Visually, that's how you know it's done (if the thickness of the fish differs from the recipe, etc.). My favourite fish recipe!

Delicious recipe. I have made this marinade as directed for sea bass, cod, chicken and tofu. I usually marinate for a couple of hours and then pan saute in the marinade. It comes out great - the sugar caramelizes a bit. I have also done it with broiling for fish and it is delicious. If you don't have sake, you can sub in 1/2 rice vinegar + 1/2 white wine vinegar.

this recipe was fabulous! I order Chilean Sea Bass everytime its on a menu of the restaurant that we are at. The best was at Tao in Vegas. I am sooo glad that I chose this recipe in my search of many Miso glazed. It was as good, if not better, than any restaurant that I have ever had it at, and my family was very nicely suprised, as was I! The glaze was perfect. I served it with a wonderful brown rice and a salad with ginger dressing to compliment. A bit expensive, but worth every bite. I will definitely be making this again soon.

Rating: 2
I was disappointed. I expected the sauce to be light and delectable- it wasn't. It was heavy and salty (and I used light soy sauce). Maybe the Miso wasn't the light yellow? I couldn't find miso labled light yellow - So I chose by the color.

This is one of my favorite fish recipes. I followed it to a T. I used Chilean sea bass, and it just melted in my mouth. I had to cook it a bit longer, maybe 2 extra minutes and put it on a lower shelf for those last minutes. I think my fish was probably an inch thick or so. I also flipped it and cooked it for probably another 2 minutes

I made this last night, it was exceptional! My broiler isn't working; however, so I made it in a pan with just a little oil. Then I put the rest of the marinade in the pan and let it reduce. It was fantastic with white rice.

I loved this one. It is really easy to make and is delicious as well as healthy. I didnot add basil as I thought that it would distract from the other flavors. Also, I used the combination of mediterranian sea bass and thinner parts of cod. Since they were both pretty thin I decided to quickly fry them on the skillet (4 min total time) rather than broil. I also reduced the marinade a bit to sprinkle over the fish when it was done and the whole thing came out REALLY nice!

One of the best fish recipes I have ever made! I didn't have sake so I substituted it with white wine. I used Chilean Sea Bass, which is yummy to begin with and it came out absolutely fantastic! It tasted like something you would pay 30-40 bucks for at a restaurant. I only marinated it for 1 hour, not sure how the flavor profile would have changed if it was marinated for full 6 hours. Its expensive, but this dish is definitely good enough to wow people with.

this was delicious..the fish was moist and cooked perfectly. no overcooked toughness here-- succulent and delicious. i didn't have any sake so i substituted some white wine and i reduced the sugar to 1.5 tablespoons, as i don't love my fish super sweet. i also only marinated for 45 mins and it was plenty! so easy-- but it tastes like it was much more time consuming!

Serious Fish Recipe.... I prepared it once before with Sea Bass, and it was the best fish recipe I have ever made. I used to work at one of the top restaurants in the country, and admitedly, this recipe is of equal or better quality than what you would get for +20 a plate. Keep it up ya'll

I'm not rating this because.... we bought what we thought was good sea bass ($19.99/lb). They have called it California and Mexican sea bass. I followed the recipe including 5-6 hours of marinating and the fish was overcooked, dry and awful. We will not buy that kind again. After all the great reviews I was looking forward to this preparation. I will try it again with either Chilean or halibut because the flavor of the marinade was great.

LaurelTouby, I don't see any place where it states "Chilean" Sea Bass in the recipe. We get it, it's over fished, move on. It could have read Corvina or Blue tail. While I too thought it was a little sweet, I have to give it 4 stars to off set your one star rating all because you miss read it.

The marinade is fine balance between- making it "too salty" and making it "too sweet". As for the reduced marinade that a couple of cooks recommended here: Reduce the marinade, if you have to, on very very low heat like you are warming it. The heat does something to the brown sugar in the marinade and it transformes into some dark bittersweetsalty that tastes like tar. Well chosen sides are just as required as the garnish for this dish.

This recipe would be fantastic if it weren't encouraging people to use a highly endangered fish. Folks, we've over-fished Chilean Sea Bass (aka Toothfish), so may I respectfully suggest an alternative? Farmed Stripe Bass, or Tilapia are better.

I actually made this dish for a dinner party for 20. I broiled the fish in the afternoon until nicely browned and rewarmed in the oven, I believe at 350, for 5 mins before serving. Stayed moist and wonderful and the hard work was finished before the guests arrived.

This is by far the best recipe for Sea Bass. Several restaurants in SF serve this dish and this version is every bit as good. Works well with halibut, but spring for the Sea Bass for the best result. Have used this for many dinner parties and it gets raves every time. Even from non- fish lovers.

I didn't change a thing but used Black Cod..I couldn't sear the fish first as many suggested (timing for dinner party of six) but it was still the best fish I've ever made.

One of my favorites and an absolutely simple dish to make. I always marinate for at least 6 hours, only substitution I make is using 2/3 cup of "sushi chef mirin sweetened sake" rather than the 1/3 sake and 1/3 mirin since thats what I have on hand. And I prefer to use Black Cod. I've been to all the top restaurants; Nobu, Morimoto, Tao...this dish is right up there with them.

This was a fantastic dish. I made it to rave reviews for my father's birthday. I seared the fish in a frying pan prior to finishing in the oven. The fish was so flaky yet tender. I reduced the marinade and used it in drips around the plate for presentation. Delish!

This dish was absolutely terrific. Grand Central Market only had the darker Miso and it worked beautifully. I served with a moroccan rice. The fish was very delicate and the miso flavor was delightful. A few tips; be careful not to burn the top of the fish at only 6in away - keep an eye on it because the crispness is nice - 5 minutes w/o foil and an add'l 3 min with was the trick for my oven. I marinated for about 2 hrs - I bet longer would make for even a richer flavor. This is very very good and worth the extra cost of the sea bass.

It really tastes like Aqua! Wow. I concur with earlier comments to: halve sugar, pan sear both sides prior to broiling, marinate at least 3-4 hours.

What a great recipe! I took the advice of others and grilled in the pan for a couple of minutes prior to broiling. For the miso glaze, instead of 3 tablespoons of brown sugar, I just added one of regular sugar (mirin is pretty sweet on its own).Would recommend that the sea bass marinate for at least three to four hours, then you don't need to add any sauce to the finished dish. The basil and scallions were the perfect toppings. This was a huge crowd pleasing recipe!!

Rating: 4
Amazingly good and so easy to make, especially since you can prepare it hours ahead of time and just broil when you're ready for dinner. I didn't use the mirin and used frozen basa fillets (similar enough to sea bass for this recipe,) which are available very inexpensively from Publix. Some of the best fish I've ever had.

from the reviews I've expected a winner, but this one was just ok, nothing like Nobu as others were claiming. not enough flavor in my opinion. marinated for 2.5 hours - maybe doing it for longer would have helped

I make this dish all the time; it is our favorite fish recipe. Today the fish market was out of sea bass, but I substituted sablefish and it was just as good as the sea bass always is! Very nice, almost buttery texture. I only had a couple of hours to marinade it but it was still excellent.

After nreading the reviews of this recipe, I was looking forward to trying it. The result was most disappointing, however. The taste of the glaze was very so-so, even though I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I splurge on sea bass, I will go back to a recipe that produces a much tastier result.

Delicious!!! I used Chilean Sea Bass, which was very tasty (though difficult to find,) and marinated for only two hours; next time I'd definitely marinate longer for stronger flavor. Everyone loved this dish, and it reminded me of the Black Cod with Miso at Nobu :) I served with Wasabi Mashed Potatoes from this site, which I wasn't crazy about--next time will probably try shrimp dumplings or soba noodles. The marinade would probably work well with chicken, or any other white fish, like cod or haddock.

YUM! YUM! This dish has star power for entertaining and so simple. Sea bass is pricey at $19.99/lb., but worth it. I grilled the sea bass on a cedar plank. The flavor was head spinning good. Cedar planks can be purchased @ BBQ stores. Soak the plank for 1 to 2 hours in water. I heated my gas grill until good and hot. Turned it down to medium high and placed the sea bass on top of the plank and grilled approximately 25 minutes with grill lid down. The plank will start to burn, crackle, and smoke. It should not catch fire. Time will vary depending upon sea bass thickness. I watched carefully so not to over cook. Mine turned out perfectly caramelized and crisp on the outside and silky inside. Place the crackling hot plank on a serving platter slice into portions and serve. The plank offers a beautiful presentation at the table, keeps the fish very hot and no clean up. Furthermore, you can offer your guests the first course while the fish is cooking and move straight to the hot yummy sea bass without any fuss and muss. This is a keeper recipe. My friends could not believe the flavor and gobbled it up. I am so in love.

This is DELICIOUS! My guests and my picky husband said it was better than any fish they had at a restaurant!

Fantastic! I'm also a regular patron at Nobu, but now I wish that their version was made with sea bass instead of cod! I used a mix of light Japanese and dark Korean miso and a good quality sake - it tasted exactly as I'd hoped. Not being someone who uses the broiler too often, I opted to take other reviewers' suggestion to sear one side on the stove first, then flipped over and stuck the entire pan into the oven at 400 degrees till just done. Do NOT skip the basil and the green onion topping - they add an essential freshness and bite to the dish. Also boiled the sauce down a bit, then tossed out about 1/3 and replaced the fluid amount with mirin, added another tablespoon of sugar and simmered for a minute - tossed some wilted spinach with it and it was excellent. Beautiful enough for company and easy enough to make for yourself on a weekday!

My fish was pretty thin, so I only marinated it for about two hours. I followed the advice of the other cooks who sauteed the fish first, then finished it in a 400 degree oven for about four minutes. It was awesome. I served it with jasmine rice, and the braised bok choy off Epicurious.

Can't believe I found this superb recipe. I ordered this at the Las Vegas Aqua (there's an Aqua in LA as well) and enjoyed it immensely with the lobster consomme. Had a merlot with it.

This glaze was yummy, but possibly a little too heavy for the fish I used (halibut). I'd definitely try it again on salmon, or even chicken I think. I really liked the nutty essence it gave the fish, although my girlfriend found it too powerful for her taste. Also, I used a George Foreman grill, as it was way too hot to turn on the oven and perhaps that cooking method made a difference too. But it's very easy if you have all the ingredients on hand.

This is a fantastic marinade. I used fresh tillapia, and marinated it for 2 hours. Because tillapia is thinner than sea bass, I cooked it under a broiler to make sure the marinade would carmelize properly without overcooking. The fish came tender and rich, and I'll definitely make this again.

Didn't have sake on hand and used dark miso and only a splash of soy sauce b/c I didn't want it too salty. It was delicious. I used convection oven so it formed a nice crust on it. Very lite and delicious but you can't really go wrong with chilean sea bass.

This dish is PERFECTION and never fails to impress your most gourmet guests. However, having done this many times, I follow a better, restaurant-style foolproof cooking method. Brown on one side in 1 tbls vegetable oil, then put the non-stick pan in a 400 degree oven for 7 minutes. Perfect, never burned, no sweating it out. And....no extra sauce. Don't forget the garnish...figures heavily into the flavor.

I broiled orange roughy because it was the freshest fish at the market, but I will try sea bass next time. I served it with a "White Bean Puree" (off of foodtv.com website) and some wilted spinach. My wife and I both I enjoyed this recipe, and we will definitely make it again. In any case, I have a few comments: 1) It's less salty and more sweet than I expected based on the recipe. 2) I followed the advice of another reviewer and put some marinade reduction on the fish after broiling... I will *NOT* do this again. It's a sickening sweet flavor with the extra sauce spooned on, and I only put a teaspoon or two per serving. 3) I broiled and itwas great, but I think grilling might be a little better if the fish holds up.

YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS FISH! That person who didn't like it did something wrong or has no taste. I had a Japanese dinner party and served this as the main course. Guests were literally licking their plates! I followed some of the earlier advice by using red miso instead of yellow (I made two batches of marinade, using the two misos for comparison and found the red just gave a stronger flavor). I grilled the fish instead of broiling and I boiled the leftover marinade and then spooned it over the fish before serving. It was easy, everyone was impressed, and I am making it for dinner again tomorrow night. Yum! Yum! I promise you won't be disappointed.

My favourit Recipe! I usually broil the fish for 4 minutes and then transfer to a 350 oven for about 8 more minutes. I could honestly eat this twice a week and never get sick of it.

I made this dish to convince my boyfriend to not leave the relationship, and it almost worked...., we were both amazed at how good it was...it was better than our first dinner together at a famous NYC restaurant...which was also Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass. I miss him, but now, I will always have the sea bass.

It took 30 minutes or more to cook the fish, and we still didn't like it. Make something else.

Fantastic recipe - we are huge fans of the miso crusted cod at Nobu in NYC and now I can make it at home!

This is SO easy to make yet SO delicious. Guaranteed to impress your dinner guests and yourself! We've also made it with fresh halibut. One tip: after marinating, take the marinade and bring to a boil on the stove for a couple minutes. Then, once you remove the fish from the oven, spoon on a little bit of the sauce.

Absolutley the best!! We have miso sea bass at a fancy restaurant in Las Vegas quite often ($40 per plate!) this recipe was much tastier. (and saves me $$. Very easy, I boiled the juices and used as sauce also. YUMMY!!

This dish was awesome! My dinner guests all loved the fish and were amazed at how well the marinade infused into the fish. Definitely a keeper.

Truthfully we didn't care for this recipe much. It was edible but the sweetness in the marinade overwhelmed the fish. I used the prescribed measurements but reduced the brown sugar to 1T. and it was still too sweet. Maybe less mirin would have helped. I also cooked outdoors on the grill. Will try the leftovers today to see if the flavors calmed down. If not, into the trash and $$$ down the drain. Won't make again.

Delicious!!! I highly recommend marinating the sea bass for as long as you can. This recipe didn't involve too much preparation time. Quick results for such a great dish.

I've made this with ch.sea.bass and salmon over, and over, and over again. The only modification is to OMIT the sake. It dilutes the glaze too much (watered down). ONE OF MY FAVORITE EYE POPPING RECIPES!

I had a similar dish called Gindara (made with Cod) in a local Japanese restaurant and loved it so we decided to give this recipe a try. It is fantastic! I didn't have green onions and basil when I made this, but it was still wonderful. I took the advice of another reviewer and boiled the marinade. It was a nice sauce for the fish and white Nishiki rice I served with it. I also served miso soup and goma-ae spinach salad. Perfect! I did need to cook the fish for about 8 minutes. I'm going to try this with cod too...

Definately a winner! We tried using miso soup in a bed of japanese noodles topped with fresh spinach blanched in the miso - topped with the sea bass and garnished with the basil and green onion. Fantastic.

A wonderful blend of flavors. The first time I made this, though, I followed the suggestions of those who used 2 instead of 3 tablespoons of brown sugar (I don't like things too sweet). I think this was a mistake. TOO salty. It is much better increased to 2-1/2 to 3 tablespoons of brown sugar. The basil and scallions as garnish are critical, though chives will do. I used black sea bass--excellent!

This was surprisingly easy to make once I found all of the ingredients. I served it with wasabi mashed potatoes, also on this website

This was my first try at sea bass and after I managed the price - expensive - I was impressed with the ease and with the interesting texture and taste of this fish. Almost like crab, but fishy. It was good, a nice change, easy, and different. Would give it a three and a half if you had halves.

Excellent flavor but sea bass definitely needs about 8 minutes to cook(use caution though, glaze burns easily)and no more than 2 tblspn brown sugar.Cooking sea bass at home in non-industrial ovens can come out a bit slimy-will try next time with halibut or swordfish. Prepare and boil extra marinade, place sauce on a warmed plate and top with this website's wasabi mashed potatoes (double the wasabi and add a few chopped chives). Top potatoes with the fish and a bit more sauce for a great presentation. Serve with steamed sugar snap peas and carrots on the side. Yummy.

I made this receipe for a dinner party. It was wonderful. I followed the ideas from other reviews and boiled the leftover marinade for the guest to drizzle over the fish. I also only used 2 TBS. of brown sugar and cooked the fish for 7 minutes. I think this would work great with diver scallops and will try it next.

Easy to make once you find the hard to find ingredients in the marinade. Delicious flavor, although I had to cook the sea bass a bit longer than 6 minutes. Excellent with the wasabi mashed potatos.

This is an excellent recipe. I entertain a lot and have made this several times and each time it was a very big hit. I am making it again Sunday night.I serve it with fresh mango salsa.

Fabulous! My local market didn't have yellow miso, so I used a darker type instead, and it came out wonderfully! We are a big fan of Aqua's version of this dish, so we'll be trying to make shrimp dumplings next to accompany the sea bass....

I've made this recipe four times in about a month and I never follow recipes. This is a winner. It's easy and the flavors are great. Definitely make extra marinade or boil the leftover; you'll want to use it for the side dishes. FYI: The longer you marinate the fish the better. A definite winner and great for a dinner party.

This is a great and easy recipe. We served the grilled shark, which we marinated for half an hour, with the wasabi mashed potatoes from the other miso fish recipe on this site, March 1999. The sauce is excellent heated, served with the fish and potatoes. I don't think you need both mirin and sake and I think that it's a tad sweet, maybe 2 Tbls.of br. sugar. It definitely benefits from the basil and green onion.

fabulous and so easy to make! marinate for several hours, boil the marinade and serve over the bass. just perfect!

We've made this twice and both times it has been fabulous! We grilled this instead of broiled and the fish picks up the flavor if marinated longer.

I tried thsi recipe at home before, with a few changes moving it to my menu. It has amazing taste, and fills the pallet with an array of flavours. I found that it works equally well with West Coast Salmon, Dolphin Fish or Yellowfin Tuna. Chef. A.P. Gonsalves] En Estilo Catering Barbados

This recipe was FABULOUS!!!! I would suggest you marinate the fish for no less than 3-4 hours and grill it instead of bake, if possible. Enjoy!:)

Excellent for any occasion!! I made it for a small dinner party and it wowed everyone. Basil definitely made the dish. I served it with rice but would like to try some udon next time. A definite keeper for my last-minute entertaining needs - what an easy way to make any hostess look good!

Wow from me too! This may be one of the tastiest fish dishes I've made. My broiler was on the fritz so I pan fried it quickly on high heat, the sauce carmelized and was even more tasty. The basil really makes the dish. I served it over basil rice noodles with snap peas and carrots on the side - gorgeous!

Wow! This recipe is going under the "Favorites" in my file. I would not change a thing. I intend to use this for a dinner party soon -- you could make the sauce in the morning before work (in about 5 minutes), let the fish marinate during the day and have a fabulous dinner ready in very little time when you got home. For presentation purposes, I served the fish in a shallow bowl over brown basmati.

I originally had this at Aqua in Las Vegas and it instantly became my favorite fish dish. The recipe is simple and perfect so don't bother with changing it. Also, light miso is a must. The darker fermented miso would over power the dish.
