The Tarator is what MAKES this dish! It was excellent and would be good with other mild and firm fleshed fish

I was really hoping that the flour would make the fish crispy on the outside. But it wasn't even though I sauteed it till it was very brown. Also I think there is too much bread in the tarator sauce. It seemed gluey. I might make the sauce again but use alot less bread.

I am Turkish and I am a very experienced cook. I have NEVER heard of tarator being made with hazelnuts or pinenuts. Tarator is made with walnuts....

The reviewer from Potomac MD claims traditionally tarator is made with Pinenuts. I 'd like to correct that and say I have never had a Tarator made with pine nuts. I also would not recommend cooks to make do with whatever nut is available as a true tarator is either made with Walnuts or Almonds. I am sorry that one of the reviewers tried this recipe based on Potomac's erronous posting and did not get a good result. The Epicurious recipe itself claims traditional tarator is made with hazelnuts. I'd hate to correct our gracious hosts but that is also incorrect. Turkish cooks implement hazelnuts in dessert recipes. Today in restaurants most tarator is made with walnuts. People associate tarator sauce with Fried Mussels (black bi-valves of the Turkish Mediterranean coast) but that doesn't mean you wouldn't try it with other fish. I made a batch of beer battered fried shrimp and served it along a nice thick Turkish Tarator sauce and it was heavenly. If you try the sauce with your fried fish, I recommend serving a nice, cold beer along with it.

i used pine nuts in the sauce per the comment about being traditional...it was pretty bland. the fish turned out good, but will definately more than double the amount of paprika and red pepper next time.

My husband says we should just figure out a way to package and sell the tarator, and we'll be set for life! He loves my cooking as a general rule, but he really raved about this recipe, and the leftover sauce (I kept it on the thickish side) was indeed a wonderful garlicky dip for the pita.

This is so simple and sooooo good. The almond tarator is absolutely delicious and whips up in just minutes. We doubled the paprika and crushed red pepper for the sea bass coating, and it was still very mild.

Tarator sauce is traditionally made with pine nuts and not hazelnuts, though regional cooks may use whatever nut is available. The fish in this recipe is "fried," and not "sauteed." Try the sauce with fried calamari, since it is served only with fish and vegetables that are deep-fried, and not cooked any other way.

no mention of quantity of almonds to be used
