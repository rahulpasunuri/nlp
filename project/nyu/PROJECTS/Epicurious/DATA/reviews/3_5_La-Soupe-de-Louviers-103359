Prepared as written, but used 2qts water instead of 1 to cover the vegetable line. I wouldn't call this "quick to make." It took me nearly 2hrs to do all the chopping by hand. Perhaps if you're clever and have technology and/or human help, it would be a different story. In terms of flavor, it's just what you might deduce from the ingredients: extremely mild vegetable flavor with a huge kick of thyme and some sweet/tingly nutmeg. I wouldn't exactly call it exciting. That said, it's strangely satisfying both in terms of palate and satiation... strangely addictive...

The perfect recipe to use up a bunch of our CSA vegetables! It was pretty good exactly as written; I thought it could have used a bit more spice but my husband loved it as-is. I threw a fennel bulb and, since we're hemorrhaging vegetables here, substituted bok choy for cabbage, on someone else's recommendation.

Prepared as directed it is lack luster.

Deliciously divine! I substituted bok choy for the savoy cabbage and used a combination of potatoes and sweet potatoes. No need for stock as it's spiced to perfection; although, fresh thyme is a must!

One of the best soups I've ever made. No broth needed, just the veggies, water, and seasonings. A dash of olive oil and some shaved Parmesan on top are a nice finishing touch.

Delicious and delightful - I added 3 strips of bacon and about 2 tablespoons of Better Than Bouillion chicken stock. So flavorful and delicious!

This is a simple but utterly beautiful soup. I think using meat broth takes away the simplicity of it -- the pure essence of these simple plain veggies. I did not have carrots and I used kohlrabi instead. No butter no nothing -- just a little olive oil, thyme and veggies. OK I did add a clove of garlic to the onion. Did not have fresh thyme so used dried (horrors!) - still it was divine. A beautiful thing.

This is a keeper recipe - a soup I prepare in rotation with other soups. I use a combination of vegetable stock and dry wine and instead of water.

Definately needs chicken broth instead of water. Also, I couldn't find fresh thyme but I wish I had, the dry stuff didn't cut it. I would try it again I think but I would have to modify it

I used chicken broth rather than water and also added 3 chopped tomatoes and 1 tablespoon of sugar.

Needed a recipe to use three lonely turnips left in the vegetable drawer from another occasion. Used chicken broth as recommended by other reviewer and also substituted dry thyme for the same reason. I think it would be better with fresh. It was eaten but not raved about. Needed some more flavor even with all of the veggies, herbs and spice.

Just made for lunch today. Used 48 oz. low-fat chicken broth in place of water. My thyme is under the snow so used dried instead. Excellent! Would make a nice chicken soup - maybe next time I will add chicken breasts to boil in the broth.
