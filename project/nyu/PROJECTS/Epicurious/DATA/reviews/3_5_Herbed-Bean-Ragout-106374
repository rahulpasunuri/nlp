This is a wonderful winter accompanyment to fish and meat dishes. I serve it with the Salmon wrapped in proscuitto normally. I like to add a fennel bulb, diced, along with the celery for added flavor.

While I was cooking the aroma smelled wonderful, but when I began to eat, I was surprised by the lack of flavor. Followed this recipe word for word and it simply didn't have enough presence to motivate me to make it again.

I've made this several times with a variety of grilled and pan-seared fish and its simply delicious. I didn't find it too time consuming and well worth any effort.

This was absolutely delicious. The recipe is time-consuming but well worth it. Even my mother-in-law agreed. Will definately make again.

I am a vegetarian and made this as a main dish for dinner and served it with some crusty italian bread. It was excellent. Next time I make it, I would double the green beans and half the edaname.

I made this to accompany the Proscuitto-Wrapped Salmon and the meal was delicious and easy. I made the bean ragout the day before I need it, but added the haricot verts and edamame right before serving so they would be crisp.
