Finally a raw dessert recipe that delivers! This is so good as is, and I have also made it with more coconut/less cacao & rolled the truffles in shredded coconut for an amazing almond-joy like result, YUMMMMM!!!! Make these, you will be glad you did.

These are so good. I used maple syrup instead of agave and dehydrated these for a bit more than 24 hrs. I keep them in the fridge and pack them as snacks. The raw cacao IS very stimulating, so heed the warnings! I've also made the blonde version subbing almond meal/flour for the cacao and those are very good as well, though of course denser.

This is so delicious and chocolatey! I followed the directions as written, using raw cocoa powder (didn't sift it however). I used a little less than the 2 cups of cocoa powder it calls for because it was very rich, as the other reviewers mentioned.

This was so delicious and chocolatey! Very easy to make. This was also my first experience with coconut oil and it was really yummy! I look forward to using it in more recipes (see the New York Times article today about coconut oil). I used raw cocoa powder, unsifted, and about 1/4 cup less than called for.

Delicious! This was my first experience with coconut oil and using only raw ingredients and I thought it was spectacular. I only had 1 1/4 cups cocoa powder, so I used 1 cup in the recipe and used the remaining 1/4 cup to coat the outside. I increased the shredded coconut to 1 1/2 cups to compensate for the lack of cocoa powder. The result was sweet without an overwhelming cocoa flavor (which other reviewers mentioned). I plan to make another batch using these same propotions as my boyfriend has eaten almost all of them in the past 2 days.

I have lost almost 30 pounds in 4 months with the raw food diet. And my weakness is chocolate. Enter these truffles. Not only are they super easy to make, they are to-die-for. I must warn that they are very rich. But, I didn't follow the recipes exactly. For half of the agave nectar, I used amaretto flavored agave. And I was short about 1/8 a cup of cocoa powder. So, I used powdered espresso for the remaining amount. I gave them to about 8 people and of those 8 people, only 1 said it was too rich. So, overall a huge success. And, since they are truffles, I mind not the richness. They are worth every minute!

I used about a tablespoon extra of vanilla and rolled the truffles in cinnamon sugar. They were absolutely delicious! Had some trouble with the blending part, will probably use a food processor or just whisk it next time.

I really loved these, and they were super easy. Some of the people who tried them at a party thought they were too rich-- you definitely have to be a chocolate fiend as the taste is pure cocoa! I loved that they weren't sugary sweet though, like storebought truffles. I didn't have agave syrup and it's hard to find in switzerland, so I used the same amt of honey and they were still great. Also, I rolled half in more coconut for a white/black look in the box.
