I made the recipe as written, and it is AWESOME! Flavorful, moist and rich. This is well worth the effort. I can't wait to make it again!

I was really dissapointed by this recipe. It was very dry and tasteless, even with all that bacon in it! all I can say it that it wasn't worth the effort and I threw it away right after Thanksgiving, not even bothering with it for leftovers.

this is a very good recipe. I am a vegetarian, so in place of real bacon, I used "stripples" and "Bac-o's". It was GREAT!! will definitely make this again.
