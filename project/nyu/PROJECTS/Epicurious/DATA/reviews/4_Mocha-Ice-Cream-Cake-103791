A friend made this for my birthday and we all loved it, including my husband who "doesn't like ice cream cake" -- or ice cream, for that matter. She baked a brownie crust for the bottom. I had already bought the chocolate cookies for the crust, so I made the brownie bottom and used the cookies and melted butter mixture to line the sides of the pan. Great! For the brownie base: Preheat oven to 325. Line 9 spring form pan with foil & coat with non-stick spray. Whisk together 1/3 c flour, 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/4 baking powder & pinch of salt; Melt 6 T of butter, remove from heat and whisk in 1/3 c unsweetened cocoa powder, 3/4 c sugar, 1 lg egg (when cool) & 1/2 t vanilla, then whisk together with dry ingredients. Spread over bottom of pan and cook 10-15 min. Do not over-cook. Cover and freeze. Proceed with next steps.

Tasty, tasty! I added a little Kahlua to the whipped cream as well. Only tricky thing (well, I found it tricky because I've never handled ice cream before) is that you can't let the ice cream soften and melt too much before putting it in the pan, otherwise it'll get a little icey... which is what happened with mine. Oh well, next time!

Made this for a friend's birthday and everyone adored it. Couple of notes: I would definitely double the chocolate wafer cookie layer, as more crust would be better. I increased the recipe about 30%, but that still wasn't enough for my liking. If you want to reduce calories/fat, I think you could get away with reducing the cream layer by 1/3 as I had a much thicker layer of that than shown in the picture. It would be beautiful with chocolate curls, but not having the right chocolate on hand, I just added some chocolate covered beans and sifted powdered sugar on top for decoration. Overall, people rated it as one of their favorite desserts. Myself, I'd still take a pound cake or other type of dessert any day over this. But literally every other person thought it was one of the best desserts they'd tasted. So definitely a crowd pleaser.

Last week I went to a Christmas party - the hosts love ice cream and coffee, so I searched on here for a recipe that incorporated their favorite flavors and textures. This recipe is so simple, but looks impressive and tastes extremely rich. (In a good way...) True Confession? I've made 3 of these cakes in 1 week. This is my Christmas 2009 dish! Love it.

Delicious! Served it at 1000 a.m. and all the coffee lovers were loving it. I did use the left-over chocolate cookies for the topping instead of the chocolate curls! I will use this again.

Unbelievably good. If you're looking for a great dessert do this one. Not too strong yet complex enough to want to know what is in it. The whipped topping is amazing and just creamy good. So glad I made this and got rave reviews.

Can't get any easier than this cake and it looked great too. It helps to do the ice cream portion a day ahead,it stayed firm for cutting. I substituted chcolate chips for the coffee beans as reccomended by one reviewer because several folks told me about the caffeine jolt you get from eating the beans. The chcolate chips worked out fine.I will make this again and again. It was a big hit.

This disappeared quickly...good thing, because it would have melted if people had not eaten it so fast! This was ridiculously easy to make, and I look forward to making it with other kinds of ice cream. I too used Oreos for the crust and increased them ever so slightly. Amounts really don't matter too much here.

I made this for the first time for my kid's birthday party last week. Wow, heaven! I was afraid that it was going to be ruined as I wasn't concentrating and didn't follow the recipe 100%. In the end it came out great. I made homemade coffee ice cream (Ben and Jerry's cookbook). For some reason it wouldn't freeze in the ice cream maker so I gave up and put it in the freezer, mixing every so often. I didn't use the coffee beans because I cannot find them in my area. I used Oreos for the base and didn't finely grind them up but the crust was out of this world. As I only have a smaller springform pan, I used half of the amount of whipped cream, powdered sugar and cocoa powder and it worked out perfectly. I removed it from the pan, smoothed it out and returned it to the freezer before the party began. It melts very quickly, and I found that I didn't need to let it soften before cutting. It looked very nice and i'll be making it again - next time with bought ice cream! I think that it would look nice with a little piped whipped cream on top as well.

This was excellent. Thought I'd try a homemade Carvel ice cream cake (You'll know what I mean if you live in the Northeast) and this beat it by 1000% The only adjustment I would make is to the frosting. Cut the sugar by half and the cocoa the same or a bit less. Excellent for a party and can be made in advance!!

I agree--double the crust. Otherwise, it's WAY too thin! I used Edy's Espresso Chip ice cream and used chocolate covered coffee beans as decoration on top instead. Yes, the chocolate covered coffee beans ARE expensive. Much cheaper to make them yourself. Just melt some chocolate and coat some coffee beans. Very easy!

Im sure that Oreos and any other cookie would work fine for the crust on this, but I used the wafer cookies and since it was like an ice cream cone it went well with the ice cream. The cocoa powder mixture is to die for. This cake was amazing and got rave reviews, I will make it again and soon.

Very, very tasty. Rave reviews every time. To save time I use Starbuck's Java Chip ice cream.

Chocolate covered coffee beans are expensive. You can substitute with chocolate chips. Sprinkles on top or more chips make it festive. Great for teen parties (and for adults too).

I wanted something that was a little more elegant so I doubled the cookie crust and used half on the bottom, half between the ice cream and the whipped cream. On top, I spread a chocolate ganache laced with kaluha, and decorated with more chocolate coffee beans around the edges. It was a huge hit!

two thumbs up! I made it in my niece's birthday. Everybody loves it. My other nieces starts to place their orders.

Two people who don't like coffee loved this dessert. I agree with increasing the cookies for the crust. 6oz will cover it, but a thicker crust had more impact on this dessert.

I've made this recipe several times over the past few years and always get asked for the recipe !!!

This was good and easy. I would make it again in a pinch, since it was so easy, but it's not the dessert I would make if I wanted to blow people away. But a good stand-by.

This dessert was an amazing hit!! People loved it and wanted the recipe. I should have made two cakes since there was only one sliver left. You must be a chocolate and coffee lover to enjoy this delicious cake. For those reviews that said you need more chocolate cookies this was not true. We had an wonderful crust with the proportions listed in the recipe.

This is a great summer desert. You just can't ask for anything more. I used choc vanilla wafer crumbs increased the choc covered coffee beans to 1/2 c. I thought this was perfect encourage others to try this you won't be disappointed.

Excellent! Everybody loved this cake and I got rave reviews from the guests. I, too, used the oreo cookie crumbs. The ice cream I used was Nestle's Mocha Flake (it was a great compliment to the cake). Oh, and for all the Canadian people out there, you can find the coffee beans at bulk barn.

A really easy dessert, and was a great hit at the party I made it for. I used Oreo cookie crumbs but they didn't seem to stick well together, so I then added too much butter. This made the crust too hard. I also skipped the espresso beans becuase I didn't have them. Still delicious though!

This cake was delicious, easy and beautiful. The combination of the textures (crunchy crust, chuncky yet smooth ice cream, and the silky whipped topping) was very pleasing, and the layers looked wonderful from the side view. Though you have to make the recipe in three different steps, none of them is too time consuming. My guests gave this cake rave reviews (except for a couple of people who don't care for coffee). My only problem was that I served this cake for an open house and was not able to keep the cake from melting on the sides. If anyone has any suggests for how to serve this cake for an event where it will be sitting out for a period of time, let me know.

This was a great cake and very easy to make. I couldn't find chocolate wafers so I used chocolate teddy grahams. I also doubled the crust.

Wonderful recipe, I made it for my husbands birthday. It was a BIG HIT, everyone went nuts over it. The chocolate whipping cream was sooooo smooth and yummy. I used oreo crumbs, also doubled the crumb mixture. Since I served this at night so I cut out the coffee beans(I wanted to make sure we slept that night). Everyone wanted a copy.

Excellent!!! I brought this in for a christmas party at my office and everyone loved it!! At first I thought I would have to use some more of the chocolate wafer cookies to cover the bottom of the pan, but it turned out to be enough, but the next time I may use some more cookies. I also used chocolate crembrulee coffee beans, which gave it a nice flavor. I used a combination of white and dark chocolate bars to garnish the cake with, for a nice presentation.

I really enjoyed the nice, smooth consistency of this cake. I would certainly make this again!

Wow! What a terrific dessert, and it's almost too simple The chopped coffee beans really do something great for the ice cream. I decorated the top with the remaining beans as well as the chocolate shavings and had a hard time convincing everyone that I didn't buy it. It's a keeper!

I also increased the amount of crust, and used Oreo crumbs instead of chocolate wafers. I've made this recipe with a number of different ice creams, all with great results. The chocolate whip cream is amazing!

This recipe was great. Next time I would double the crumb mixture because I barely had enough to cover the bottom of the pan.

I made this for my sister's birthday and everyone at the party loved it (including my husband, who doesn't like anything coffee). It was not very difficult to make and looked great when served.

This was easy and delicious. It can be made a few days in advance which can really help when preparing for a party. The crust was a little tough to get out of the pan. Next time I might try a different ice cream.

Excellent-- tastes like something you picked up at Baskin Robbins. I decorated the cake with the chocolate espresso beans, layed out in a concentric circle in lieu of the chocolate curls. Beautiful and delicious.

This was easy, delicious and rich! People raved about this dessert! Instead of using the chocolate covered coffee beans, I added a little bit of freshly ground coffee, worked and tasted great.

I made this for a friend's birthday cake. Instead of using coffee ice cream and buying the coffee beans, I substituted expresso chip ice cream. Everyone loved it. Absolutely delicious. I let it sit at room temp. for 10 minutes and it got too soft. I would slice it sooner. Definitely would make again!

Easy to make, lovely to present, rave reviews from guests and the ability to make ahead an added bonus.

Very nice. But for some reason, every grocery store within a 50 mile radius of my house didn't carry the coffee ice cream. I substituted chocolate-- a mistake. The flavors just weren't very complex, what with the chocolate ice cream and chocolate flavored whipped cream topping. In hindsight, I realize I should've used vanilla if unable to obtain the coffee ice cream-- it would've made for a much more interesting pie. However, the people at the barbecue at which I brought this raved, so I can't complain too much. [Other than the fact that I didn't realize we'd be eating outside-- HELLO, ice cream cake on a hot July day is not a good idea :)] I'll make this again when I am better prepared!
