Excellent and simple. I added garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs to the roasting pan and used balsamic.

This was fabulous. I used balsamic vinegar and my guests kept going back for more until the plate looked like they had licked it clean. It was a great compliment to the grilled steaks we had.

I use spinach and a little butter instead of vinegar, very easy and good

Man, was this good! Made as directed-had made something similar years ago that called for haricot verts that were steamed and chilled-sort of a potato salad-I liked this better. Had with a rotisseried turkey breast with fig glaze and salad. Yum

Great all in one starch and veggie. Love to serve it for a dinner party with filet mignon steaks and mushroom wine sauce.

This recipe will be a staple at our house, too. I doubled the amount of cider vinegar -- next time will double everything!

This is now a staple of ours - I wouldn't have it as a main dish, but it's a great side dish. This is very nice using balsemic (sp?) rather than cider vinaiger

This does need something. I added thyme which helped. The cider vinegar lacked in flavoring for this dish.

Such a an easy and simple way to combine starch and veggies for a quick meal. A little feta or goat cheese perks it up too.

This was delicious and easy to prepare. I added a touch of nutmeg to the spinach.

Easy to prepare and simple flavors. Needed something more for my taste. Pretty dull.

This was very good! I did a mixture of both greens. Great flavor.
