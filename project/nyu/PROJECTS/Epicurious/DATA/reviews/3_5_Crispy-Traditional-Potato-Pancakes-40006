Worked well, and I used the extra egg and matzoh meal. The best kitchen tool I've used for getting the moisture out of potatoes before frying is a ricer. One good squeeze (per maybe 1/3 c. potato)and they crisp perfectly.

The key is to dry, dry, dry the potatoes! Take the time and use the potato starch. Add cinnamon to your apple sauce. An awesome and simple dish that goes well with lots of candles at this time of year.

I sub'd chives for scallions and the pancakes still had a good amount of onion. I'd use spring onions instead of onion if they are in season. I used 1/4 cup to measure instead of 2T. These were the perfect size. I served 3 per person. You'll have to push the water out repeatedly. You could make the potato mix the day before (squeezing out the water 1 time before storing, again as a batch when removing from the fridge, and again before putting them into the pan.)We used leftover mixture the next night and they were great. I found the 1/4 measure to be a great way to push the last of the water out of the small batch that would be 1 pancake. I put the finished product into a 190F oven to keep warm. It helped crisp them even more. Really yummy.

DELICIOUS. WILL DEFINITELY MAKE THEM EVERY HANUKA. SERVED THEM WITH SOUR CREAM OR COTTAGE CHEESE.

I added an extra egg and matzo meal, as the recipe suggests, for a lightly fluffier (but still crisp) latkes. Straight out of the oil, these were absolutely delicious. I made them ahead of time and froze them as the author suggests, but they just don't crisp properly when reheated in the oven. I'll make them again, but not for a large dinner party.

We also added an extra egg. Didn't soak the potato for lack of time, but still really good. We also liked the amount of onion called for and would even consider adding more....

Perfection. I read the reviews and took everyone's advice: Add an egg and flour, squeeze out excess liquid, substitute scallions with chives, and soak peeled potatoes in cold water before grating. My pancakes were much bigger than the recipe suggests. I made 8 pancakes not 2 dozen. Bigger is better.

I went with the "fluffy" variation, adding an extra egg and some all purpose flour in place of matzo meal. My family enjoyed them overall, but proclaimed them "too oniony." If I make them again, I'll probably swap out a lot of the onions and replace them with something milder, like chives. I took other readers' advice and soaked the grated potatoes in very cold water, and these held together nicely and got a good, crisp surface.

I have made this recipe for many years in a row, always with raves...the key to making latkes in general (as my grandma will attest) is to put the newly grated potato into ice water while you prepare the remainder of ingredients. As the recipe suggests, you must really squeeze all of the water out of the potatoes before incorporating. Keep squeezing the liquid out with a wooden spoon even as you are making each pancake. Keeping the mixture slightly wet, but not dripping, is the secret to crispy perfect latkes!

this is the real deal. one must be gentle with these puppies, but oh are they worth it. bring on the horseradish, sour cream & apple sauce!

These fell apart!! I couldn't hold them together, very frustrating! I ended up with hash browns. They were tasty, but I really wanted the "pancake" appearance. Sorry for the bad review!

I have come across various recipes for potato pancakes that call for "coarse grating" - I am Polish and I was taught to make potato pancakes by using fine grating - mix this with a little flour, grated onion, and 1 egg, and fry like pancakes. This will give you a wonderful potato pancake. Use salt and pepper. You can top with pork or beef stew.

To DC: What's the difference? That is so little difference between the recipes as to be insignificant.

The best recipe--and I mean the best--appeared in Cooks Illustrated 5 years ago. The big difference: After grating the potatoes (either Yukon gold or russet), take half the shreds, return them to the food processor with quartered onion, and with the steel blade pulse until bits are about 1/8 inch. Then squeeze liquid from all potatoes through a sieve placed over a bowl. When as much liquid as possible is squeezed out, let that settle about a minute and then pour off watery top. What remains in the bowl is potato starch, which you then add to the potatoes, onion, egg, 2 T matzo meal (optional), salt and whatever else you add (I like them simple). I have made this again and again; perfection every time. I usually wind up doubling or trippling the recipe and everyone is always looking for more!

We had to add a little flour to hold the pancakes together, but everyone at the table loved this dish.

I had a craving for potato pancakes...so came here. There were only two of us so I just decided to adjust as needed. Cut as many potaoe's as I wanted. Added onion as I wanted...no scallions handy. Drained the spuds...Took me awhile to realise the starch resadue is not evident until you drain (slowly) the bowl. Mine were mushy but fried up well (I added a little flower because I thought they were not dense enoughg). Enjoyed. Went well with the three apple applesauce (I only used one type apple). Will do this again! An aside...I like my pancakes with mustard! Donna

I made this for my family on a rainy sunday morning in april. They came out crispy and tasty. We served them with an egg on top and a drizzle of garlic butter. give it a try, it was easy.

These came out pretty well. I grated the potatoes a few hours ahead of time and just kept them in a bowl of water in the refrigerator. They were great with the three apple applesauce!

The potato pancakes were thin and crispy and delicious! We served them with three apple applesauce. Can't wait to try the recipe again!

This was a very good reciepe for potato pancakes, it was like the one my father used to make when I was a little girl,didn't care much for them when I was real young, when I became a teenager I only remember having them a few times and really got to like the when my Father became ill and passed away, I especially like them with applesauce.

Delicious! We were looking for a recipe which did not need flour or matzo meal, due to allergies. This one was perfect! Yield varied depending on size of pancake. Can easily double, triple, etc. Will definitely make them again!

I found this to be a great recipe. Although they may tend to fall apart, I found repeatedly squeezing the extra uice out before putting a patty on the pan took care of most problems (along with not trying to flip too early). I served to a large group and everyone enjoyed.

So how much potato starch is needed? I can't imagine that Joan Nathan whose recipes are top notch would omit the potato starch in the list of ingredients!

We found the texture a bit coarse. For the next batch, I returned the grated potatoes to the processor bowl and gave them a few pulses with the metal blade. Much better.
