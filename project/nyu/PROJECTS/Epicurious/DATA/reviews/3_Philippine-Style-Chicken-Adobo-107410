I have made this recipe for years. It is easy and everyone here enjoys it. My sister asked for the recipe recently, and when I emailed it to her , I noticed that it was only rated 3 forks. Since this has been a staple for my family, and it gets positive reviews when we have guests, I felt I had to weigh in with a 4 rating.

Wonderful recipe. I've made it for anywhere from 2 to 16 people and it never fails to please. Easy to make and delicious.

I have made this recipe many, many times to much acclaim. I like to spice the marinade up by adding 1/8 to 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes and 1/4 tsp. whole black pepper slightly crushed.

Made the chicken very tender, but not a fan of the flavor. Teriyaki chicken is much better to us. Won't make again.

There is NO definite and exact Adobo recipe out there, even in the Philippines. Each family has their own version of this famous Filipino dish. There are also lots and lots of variations, from plain chicken, to chicken with pork, to just pork, everything but the kitchen sink (so to speak). Pretty much anything can be made into Adobo, even seafood and veggies. Cooking adobo is really something that's all up to you, if you want it a tad bit sweeter, add sugar (or in the Philippines, some use banana blossoms), if you want it with more sauce, double the recipe for the sauce, so that when it reduces, there's still a lot left. Some families here also add hard boiled eggs

I agree, some should relax a little. This is not a bad adobo recipe. To simplify the cooking method, and to be closer to Philippine-style adobo, combine all ingredients in one (1) pot and cook without cover until chicken is tender and liquid dries up without burning. Chicken should have rendered fat. You may cook it longer until the chicken pieces are fried to golden brown.

Everyone needs to relax a little. When they say "style" in the foodie biz, they mean NOT authentic but based off the original authentic style. Is this recipe authentic? Hell no. But is it a new and pretty tasty twist on adobo? Absolutely. I have a family recipe for adobo too, but I thought it was fun to try this new (admittedly labor intensive) method.

I have been making this since the recipe was printed in Gourmet. It has become a weekday staple because it is easy and quite good, but not really company fare. I don't leave the chicken at room temp and have never found the need to boil the marinade or broil after baking. How much simpler do you get than throwing 5 ingredients in a bag in the fridge and then a few hours later putting it in the oven? This is one of the recipes I gave my 12 year old son when I started to teach him to cook. I have never had "authentic" adobo, but find the many comments about that irrelevant. Do you like it or not? Have you even made it, or are you just reviewing it out of principle? And adobo actually means "seasoning or marinade", not frying.

While I was in the Philippines earlier this year,I went into The National Book Store in Manila,and I found a book simply called 'The Adobo Book',it features around 500 recipes,a lot of them are VERY different from the Adobo my wife cooks,the picture at the top of the page looks more like marinated fried chicken,maybe delicious (Sarap!),but NOT true Adobo,sorry!

Rating: 1
It is NOT authentic the picture doesn't even look like adobo. You don't bake adobo and you don't use cider vinegar...You can't even get that kind of vinegar in PI. If you don't know what your doing don't be so brazen as to call your recipe authentic.

Adobo is a no-muss no-fuss dish. this recipe has the same ingredients but the prep is over the top. To make 'real' Adobo - Brown chicken in a big pot then add the other ingrediants and cook till done. That's it. Also - and this is Very important - leaving raw meat out at room temperature for 45 minutes is dangerous. Leaving raw meat out at room temp. allows for bacteria growth (especially true for salmonella prone chicken). Never leave raw meat out unless you're actively prepping it.

This recipe does not do justice to the true Filipino Adobo. Read all the reviews for this recipe and you will know why. Adobo is the easiest chicken dish you can make. Dump everything in a pot and voila. No baking. No marinating. It's delicious IF done right! Best served with white rice or garlic rice

I didn't care for this one at all either. I am also a Filipina and am used to the traditional Filipino dish, where it is not baked.

Chicken adobo is incredible if made the right way. Use rice vinegar, soy sauce, water, bay leaves, garlic, and pepper, cook on the stovetop for either one hour then transfer to the crockpot, or just simmer longer. You can broil it at the end if you want but the longer stewing the better. No marinating. There are so many long responses because this is so good when done right.

I made it twice, first as written, and second marinating it overnight. It wasn't anything special at all.

I used some of the ideas from this recipe and then altered it with input from my Philippino friend. Try this and you will not be disappointed. It's such an easy and simple dish to make without all the fuss. First, don't use the oven use a crockpot if you have one and cook on low for 8 hours. I only used chicken, as a matter of fact I cut up a whole chicken and plopped it into the pot. The marinade: I used 3/4 cup rice vinegar, and 1/4 Soy sauce. I added crushed red pepper flakes (to taste), 8 garlic cloves, 2 large onions, 2 bay leaves. I mixed this together poured it over the chicken and marinated it in the fridge for 1 1/2 hr. After cooking it in the crockpot 8 hours you simply have an amazing dish. I've been eating this all week with varying side dishes, like roasted asparagus or steamed spinach. Finger lickin' good.

The way I make adobo is to brown the garlic and the chicken & pork, and then add equal parts soy sauce and white vinegar, bay leaves, black peppercorns and roughly 1-2 tablespoons of ground coffee. Definitely mix the pork with the chicken, and if available, dried banana or lily flower. I've tried many different adobos - you know, holidays with the extended family - but find that this way is best. The coffee counteracts some of the sour and adds a nice depth; the dried flower adds a touch of sweetness; the pork adds not only flavor, but some moisture too. Ma sarap! I also think it's funny that all the Filipinos/Filipinas have read this recipe and responded like a call to arms. But I suppose that's from calling something Philippine-Style. One of the best thing about Philippine cooking is that every family throws their own spin on things, and then passes it down. So perhaps some Philippine family makes the adobo like the recipe...but really, cider vinegar and no peppercorns? Hindi pa sarap.

Read the other reviews and I agree this is not an authentic filipino recipe. Nice try though: baking it cuts calories. A filipina myself - and, yes, there are other many variations as it depends on the region you're from - 'adobo' means 'frying', so you can't bake it. I grew up with my mom adding carrots, potatoes, and onions to stretch the chicken. Also, you can add pork with the chicken to create a wonderful mix of flavors - this is our way in the Visayas Region. You put in the bay leaves last to simmer and take it out before you serve, along with the peppercorns. I once put leeks in it and it was wonderful, adding color, texture, and the sweetness counter-balanced the vinegar (no cider vinegar, I agree with another critic), another reason why my mom added carrots! But, again, it's our Visaya version. I also put turnips and/or parsnips now and then instead of potatoes -- it's great! Vegetables naturally soak up the meat juices and seasonings.

The traditional dish, as stated below, is covered and cooked on the stove top and not in the oven. The Filipino version I was taught was to cover and cook the chicken over low heat in the garlic, Coconut vinegar (Silver Swan), and soy sauce (Datu Puti, which is the lowest in sodium and has added lemon blend-"Calamansi"). When the chicken is done (falling off the bone), cut up one whole yellow onion in large chunks and scatter over the top (adds sweet). Cover and continue cooking until the onions are very tender. Then remove the chicken and continue cooking the sauce to reduce it. Must serve over Jasmin rice. My Filipino friend calls this dish "Lazy Chicken" because it is so easy. I have added Peppercorns, and whole mushrooms with the onion, and wow is it great! It disappears at pot-lucks!

Rating: 1
First of all, this is not a recipe from an authentic Filipino cook. Filipinos rarely bake. To be made properly, adobo is slow cooked on the stovetop in a large pot. Secondly the average filipino doesn't even know cider vinegar exists. The best vinegar for this dish is Rice Vinegar. It needs more soy sauce & garlic. It also needs to marinate for about an hour in the fridge, then slow cook on the stovetop or in a crockpot if you own one. Our family likes it with pepper also. White and black pepper.

Rating: 2
Tried this out. The results are not as great as the the more traditional Filipino dish. The others here have said that adobo has as many variations as there are cooks, and that is true, but let me tell you: not a lot of Filipinos would bake adobo. That would be truly funny here! I would rather marinade it for an hour, add maybe thrice the amount of garlic (crushed, not minced), and use a wok instead of baking. Here's a good variation for adobo: use extra virgin olive oil. You'll see that the olive oil adds an continental touch to this dish.

our family likes a combination of chicken & pork; we also fry the meat when done & reduce the sauce. my kids love this traditional philipino dish!

Rating: 3
I am Filipina and this recipe comes very close to the real thing. Several of the reviewers say differently. Well, adobo is like chili in the Philippines. There are many variations of the recipe and there is always someone who thinks their recipe is the "correct one". My own adobo recipe has the same ingredients except mine has twice as much garlic and marinating for an hour. Also, most Filipinos pan fry (or broil) the chicken after cooking.

Rating: 2
No this isn't authentic adobo but it had an ok flavor but much more work than original adobo. Very easy use half your chicken with skin and bones (better flavor) and other half boneless skinless this makes it less oily. Put chicken in pot (no water)and spices of garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves (3 or 4), soy sauce and white vinegar. Cover and cook (about 45 min or 1 hr.) will make its own juice. Best with jasmine rice and steamed green beans. If you like it spicier add more pepper or more sour add more vinegar it personal peference. Its also great with pork made the same way.

I agree with the cook from Albany that this recipe is not authentic Filipino. Adobo is a quick and easy dish when prepared right. I put all ingredients in a pot (used white vinegar) and don't add water. After 20 min or so, the sauce will thicken and coat the chicken. Optional: you can fry the chicken separately til crispy.

Rating: 3
This recipe does adobo the wrong way. When done correctly, this dish is excellent. My wife's family is Filipino and I cook it the way they do...first off, forget the marinade, and use rice vinegar instead of cider. Combine all the ingredients in a medium saucepan and add enough water to just about cover the chicken, should be about 1 c. Bring to a boil then cover and simmer for about 40 min until chicken starts to pull off the bone. I've done it as long as an hour on real low heat and it's great. Either way, take the cover off after 30 min. Transfer chicken pieces to a hot, oiled frying pan and fry for 5-10 minutes to brown on all sides. While chicken is browning, increase heat under sauce to med. Strain sauce through wire mesh to remove garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves, and chicken skin, then pour sauce over rice and chicken on the plate. I use jasmine rice...NOT a sushi-style short-grain sticky rice. Regular rice soaks up the sauce and is delicious...sticky rice just makes a mess. Try making it this way if you liked the flavor before but weren't overly impressed.

Rating: 3
To the cook from Toronto: Perhaps you used previously frozen chicken? I think the "brown gunk" look tends to happen when the chicken is not fresh. For me, the best results with this dish is first stewing the chicken, and then finishing the chicken under the broiler. There is no need to marinate the chicken at all when you use this method.

Rating: 2
I obviously did something quite wrong with this recipe but I will give it a second chance. I think that I marinaded it too long (24 hours). The vinegar must have cooked the meat because it was an awful texture. I did this in the saute pan instead of the oven. The sauce separated with lots of brown gunk (almost like when you make chicken soup.... the stuff you skim off). The sauce never did thicken although I boiled it at the end. I did have to strain it before serving it. On the positive side, it had a very nice flavour just a very unappealing look. Sara Moulton from Gourmet made this dish on her TV show Sara's Secrets. She braised it instead of doing it in the oven. It should be on the Foodtv.com website soon. I'll check out the recipe and see where I went wrong.

Everyone loves this one. I'm always ashamed at how simple it really is. I found it unnecessary to broil at the end as the skin is usally crispy already. This recipe begs for sticky rice.

I love adobo and I think after this try I'd leave it to my Moms to make it for me. I used pork and white vinegar. Even though I love the sauce normally when I made it I had to throw out some of the sauce 'cuz I had just too much. My meat seemed to soak in too much of the vinegar. I used about 9 cloves of garlic. Maybe with practice I'll perfect this dish one day.

Rating: 4
Very,very GOOD! Must serve with rice and sauce. Use medium grain or calrose rice, not Long grain rice - It should be sticky. Double on the garlic and pepper and bay leaf - important to give you good adobo flavor. It's better to use a real dark soy sauce like swan (available in Asian stores)and apple cider vinegar to give you authentic adobo flavor.

Rating: 3
I have to agree with cpetersen that the garlic & peppercorns are quite necessary is order to get the authentic tropical taste. My father often prepares the Adobo using catfish (my favorite)instead of chicken or pork.

Rating: 3
as an avid filipina cook, this dish is good but would be better if you do the following revisions: use 1 head garlic (firmly chopped) and add 1 tsp of whole black peppercorns (crushed) and PLEASE serve with the followig side dishes: steamed white rice, sliced cucumber in white vinegar and black pepper, and sweet, ripe honey mangoes (as close to a manila mango, as possible, not the latin types) and i promise you'll be in tropical heaven!

Both the adults and kids loved this and it was really simple. I was worried 21/2 hours to marinate wasn't long enough. I was wrong. The vinegar really penetrates the meat fast. I used "light" soy sauce and white wine vinegar and added about 1 tsp. sugar and used extra bay leaves. Will try on pork at some point.

I made this chicken for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I used chicken breasts instead of the chicken legs because I prefer the white meat. I also marniated it overnight and it came out very flavorful. The sauce was so good that I saved the extra to pour over other dishes. As mentioned below: goes well with rice.

Made this last night for dinner and just ate the leftovers for lunch. I also used a whole chicken cut up. I liked this,but wasn't wowed. Don't think I would make again for just our family because there are always so many new chicken recipes to try and play around with. Would definately make for a crowd though since this recipe is easy and can be prepared ahead.

I made this dish last night and my family loved it! Instead of using just legs and thighs, I used a whole cut up chicken. I doubled the sauce recipe then baked the chicken as directed in the recipe. After baking the chicken I transferred the pieces to my Rotisserie oven for another 30 minutes. Even my daughter who does not care much for chicken loved it. I reduced the sauce to about half by simmering it while the chicken was in the rotisserie, and YUMMM! All of the sauce was eaten up as well as the chicken. I served the chicken with creamed potatoes and peas and the sauce was really tasty on the potatoes. We will have this again soon.

Rating: 4
I come from a Filipino family, and I was so excited to see this recipe on this site! I just wanted to share a few ideas. I never use legs and thighs for this dish..........I prefer wings. The delicous sauce really gets through the smaller pieces better. And the portion is better if you are doing this for a buffet type of thing. Pork ribs also work nicely. I have used breasts when trying to cut back on fat, but honestly, the wings are tastier. I agree with the person who said high quality soy sauce is a must. I also like more bay leaves and some pepper corns.....but that's just personal preference. Try this recipe....please;)

After reading all the rave reviews, I decided to try it even though I was skeptical. I marinated the chicken for 8 hours - thought that was a happy medium between the recipe and the reviewers who recommended overnight. My husband and I were not all that impressed - the taste was mildly interesting. We decided the marinade on skinless chicken breasts would be much better, as the thighs and legs wound up way to greasy for our taste.

I have not make this yet (but I will), but to the reviewer that used Kikkoman soy sauce....that's not soy sauce, that's colored salt water. Seek out an use a true Tamari style sauce...it makes a world of difference in flavor and substance. Kikkoman is for people that like really salty take-out rice.

I loved this dish...but I did make a couple of changes. I cooked the chicken on the stove top instead of baking it, and added a can of garbonzo beans. There is something about the combination that is delicious! I don't know how authentic it is, but I learnt that from a Philipppino friend.

First time I ever made a recipe on Epicurious where I didn't like a four forker. I followed the recipe exactly, used Heinz Cider vinegar and Kikkoman soy sauce. The chicken was, well chicken, I've used better marinades. The sauce was salty. I'm amending my review. Based on the other glowing reviews, I decided to try again. This time I used a mixture of balsamic and sushi flavored rice vinegar, hot pepper soya and added a tbl of shopped hot peppers to the marinade. I also increased te bay leaf (maybe mine are old). I then poured about a cup of white wine into the marinade and reduced over low heat. I realise that this is not authentic adobo but is was much tastier.

This dish is surprisingly good and so easy to make. My husband is not a big fan of chicken, but he loved it. I'll try it out again on the kids when they visit this weekend. As one reviewer said, broiling the chicken does keep it from being "soggy", something that appeals to me. And the sauce really adds to the dish.

I'm sorry to say I have no idea what chicken adobo is supposed to taste like, but my husband and I loved it. I marinated the chicken for more than 24 hours and I do admit the meat had little flavor by itself, but dipped in the marinade it was fantastic. Our kids don't always like what we like, so for them it was perfect because they ate the chicken plain and had no complaints.

Rating: 2
I too used chicken breasts instead of legs. I thicken the sauce with corn starch before basting with it. As it happens there was a cooking show on while my chicken was broiling. The cook added 2Tbsp of honey to the cider vinagar and soya sauce. I think the honey is exactly what the dish needed. I will add honey when I try this again.

I have to agree with the cook from NY this was really just so-so. I followed the recipe exactly for the ingredients and let it marinate overnight, actually close to 24 hours and found it had little or no taste. Maybe the leftovers tonite will surprise me but I'm highly doubtful. Was very disappointed as I'm always looking for new chicken recipes especially ones where the marinade does not have a lot of fat or oil in it

This has always been a good recipe! And everyone that I served this to love/enjoyed it(and no they're not justtrying to be nice by saying it's good)and always asked for the recipe. However, I cooked this in a stove top rather than in the oven/broiler as it's how it has always been cook in the Philippines ( as oven is a luxury appliance in the Philippines). It's probably the reason why the previous reviewer did not liked it, then again you can not please anyone. In any case, it's the kind of dish everyone I had served it to go for seconds and thirds and they just like having that sauce on the rice. I would add more garlic and black pepper, than what the recipe calls for. And maybe trim the skin of the chicken as that has a lot of fat.

I am Filipino, and I've eaten alot of adobo in my lifetime - this is not the authentic "stewed" adobo, actually I think this is better! The broiling gives it a nice texture and keeps it from being "soggy". Cider vinegar instead of white vinegar makes it less astringent. Sauteed greens (like Chinese Flowering Cabbage) makes a good accompaniment, along with a pot of white rice. Marinating overnight is a must. Guests loved it, no leftovers!!

After many failed Adobo recipes, this is a keeper. I did add a touch more soy sauce because I was afraid it would be too vinegary (as was my other failed attempts). Definitely marinade overnight. And make sure you skim the fat or use a fat separator for the sauce before eating it--I didn't and it was a bit too greasy.

Very, very, tasty.......I've tried chicken adobo every way from Sunday. This isn't an incredible recipe, but it is quite tasty, needless to say simple. But, this is one of those recipes that's like cooking an egg or making a baguette. Very simple, elemental ingredients, the trick is in the balance of them. Next time, I'm going to try a different kind of vinegar, (Datu Puti Brand) Palm Vinegar is a more traditional type to use for Chicken Adobo. Overall, I would make this recipe again.

The chicken turned out to be tender and juicy with a crispy skin. The marinade accompanied the rice and chicken perfectly. I served steamed zucchini and squash for the vegetable. Next time I will add some pepper flakes to add some heat to the dish. Altogether, an easy to make dinner that is a welcome change from fried chicken drumsticks.
