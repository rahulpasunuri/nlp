I carefully followed directions for six people, doubling the recipe, putting it in a 9x13 in pan, and planning to bake it for an hour. After 45 minutes it was overcooked and dry. Of course the asparagus was also way overcooked. If I make this again, I will add an additional egg, put the asparagus and last portion of cheese in toward the end--maybe 15-20 minutes before it's supposed to be done-- and expect that with the extra egg it will be done in 45 minutes. Despite how it came out the first time, my guests seemed to enjoy it. I found it a bit heavy and rich.

Awesome recipe! I recommend using about a dozen or 15 asparagus stalks.

This was delicious, creamy, and cheesy. The asparagus looks beautiful but adds only a visual element. I also cubed the bread and omitted the meat. The directions were a bit confusing with regard to number of people served - 2 - but "for a small crowd" - so I doubled it and it served 6 as part of a small brunch (one other dish and fruit salad).
