Instead of walnuts I used pecans (they aren't as bitter as walnuts). Delicious cake with a cup of tea.

Like others, I soon realized that the recipe made too much batter for one pan. I made this for my sister's birthday and incidentally started a small fire in her oven with overflow caramel, even after splitting it into 2 round pans. It made for a great story for my 2nd graders! I also made a chocolate ganache that we drizzled over at the end and I used pecans instead of walnuts. Everything's better with chocolate, right??!!

Not bad. I had some leakage so I had to accommodate for that and ended up making some extra caramel topping that I drizzled on top afterwards. Nice and moist, very yummy!

This turned out fabulous! I made a couple of small changes - I didn't have quite enough brown sugar, so for the topping, I used 2/3 brown sugar, and 1/3 palm sugar. For the cake, I just reduced the overall amount of sugar to about 3/4 cup (again, using brown and palm). After reading the reviews, I baked in a 9.5" springform pan, set on a foil-lined pizza pan. There was a tiny bit of leakage, but not too much and the net result was perfect. It looked pretty much like the picture (and the topping that stuck to the pan, I just scraped off and put on the cake while still warm and gooey. I baked the cake the night before, and just warmed it a bit in the oven (at 150F) so it would be gooey and delicious. Rave reviews all around and very easy to make. Score!

I made this cake for my uncle Lloyd's birthday and it worked out well. I used roasted pecans which most people prefer. I suggest using the whipped cream vs. the ice cream. Also while the cake was upside down cooling I drenched it in dark rum and lime juice. yum

Delicious. I always put it in TWO 8" cakes pans and it makes two good sized cakes. The caramel can bubble out of the cake tin though, so I am sure to line the bottom of my oven with tin foil.

I made this yesterday for a dinner with our neighbors and our next door neighbor thought is was the best dessert ever (he loves caramel). An 8" pan was way too small and the batter filled a 9" pan with 2" sides. Even though it was a nonstick pan, I sprayed it w/ nonstick spray and I had no problem with sticking. I think next time I will use pecans instead of the walnuts.

The cake is so moist and flavorful! I might make it without the topping next time: I followed the cooling and removal directions but the topping still stuck to the bottom of the pan. The cake has such a nice flavor that the topping really isn't necessary.

Rating: 3
Followed other reviews with a 9 inch spring form. Good idea. Best served warm, if the caramel cools too much its chewy. Quite tasty, though it's true, it is just glorified banana bread. But glory is glory, right? In the future, I think I'll try to make this as a coffee cake-type breakfast cake and probably HALVE the sugar -- it's very, very sweet. I wouldn't make it as it again, but I think it'd be worth tweaking and trying again.

Excellent recipe for the overriped bananas. My cake did not look as good as the the pciture for the recipe, but nontheless was very tasty. My husband said it's his favorite banana cake recipe now.

I'm not a huge fan of banana cake, but I had some bananas that were starting to get too ripe, so I tried this one. I was pleasantly surprised. The flavor reminds me of bananas foster, and it's wonderful served warm. I left out the dark rum because I didn't have any, and instead of making the cake "upside down", I made the cake in a cast iron skillet, then poured the caramel topping over the top immediately after removing it from the oven. Also, I left off the nuts because I didn't have any. This cake was a hit with my family and I would definitely make it again.

Rating: 0
I can tell you right now, that the cake in the photo for this recipe was not made the way the recipe states. This cake was baked without the caramel and nuts, most likely in a spring form pan, and the caramel and nuts were added after baking, allowed to cool and set. Delicious either way....but don't worry, they couldn't do it either ;)

I loved this cake. I used a 9 inch cake pan and cooked it for 45 minutes and it came out perfectly- just like the picture. I followed the directions about taking it out of the pan. I used nonfat vanilla yogurt instead of the sour cream because that was what I had, and toasted pecan pieces for the nuts. yum- will make again when I have overripe bananas!

I just finished baking this cake. It made the house smell SO good. Unfortunately, I used a bundt pan (to make it look more like a cake), and even though I buttered the pan very well, small pieces of the topping stuck to the pan after turning it out to the plate. I was able to re-assemble it and it doesn't look too bad, but maybe next time I will try the 9' cake pan. (The bits of cake I tasted were really delicious though. I plan on bringing this with me to Christmas Eve dinner.)

I made it in a 9" round, 2" high pan and the cake did rise a little bit above the rim. I put a cookie sheet covered with a silpat liner but nothing dripped out. I waited the 15 minutes and turned it over and some of the topping stuck to the bottom of the pan but it came off easily with a spatula and I was able to spread it back over the cake with little damage. The topping did harden up a bit the next day but was still "cutable." I used walnut pieces and next time I'll increase to a full cup for a little extra crunch. Very tasty.

I loved this cake and it's a big hit at our house. I've made it a few times now, and each time the carmel topping overflows over the top of the dish. I've tried different depths and a longer baking time, but it still happens each time. I will continue to make it, though, because it's so good.

Easy to make, impressive to see and absolutely delicious. Has a lighter taste than would seem likely. I used a square 8x8 and would recomend chopped walnuts instead of halves. Just right for a ladies lunceon, 12 servings easy. YUM YUM YUM

This is just the dessert for those with a fondness for sweet desserts. It was delicious, but I did have a couple of issues. When I turned the cake out of the pan after the 15-minute cooling period, the topping remained on the bottom of the pan when I lifted it away after the 5- minute wait! I was able to extricate it with a spatula and carefully spread it onto the bottom of the cake, but it was nerve- wracking to accomplish this without damaging the cake. The recipe directions stated, cool at least 15 minutes for the topping to set. Oh my, did it ever set! It was extremely difficult to cut through the topping without causing damage to the underlying cake and somehow I managed to reconstruct the servings. I did not have any issues with caramel overflow during baking. I have noticed a difference in the labeled vs. the actual size of baking pans of the common variety. Recently, I measured all of my cake pans and found some variation in the actual size. The professional cake pans that I have purchased from a baking supply store are a uniform size and the 8-inch pan that I used to bake this cake measured exactly 8 inches across the bottom and 2 inches in height. In contrast, the ones that I purchased from home good stores measured less. Perhaps that made the difference. The caramel issue has me stumped. The only thing I can think of is boiling it less than the specified one minute before pouring it into the pan. If anyone knows why the caramel stuck and became too chewy to cut through, please post your opinion because my DH loved this cake and I would like to make it again.

I love this cake, my boyfriend super loves this cake, but every single time I make it the caramel overflows from under and around the cake and smokes up my oven. Is this happening to anyone else?

I have made this several times now. I used a 9" springform and wrapped foil around and then put a cookie sheet under w/ a silpat and the little of the caramel that dropped was easy to clean. It does fall a little in the middle so I add some extra nuts that were stuck on the pan to the middle. The caramel is so easy to make and so good. This is such a nice variation something to make w/ my brown bananas.

No more banana bread, this is way better and just as easy. Almonds instead of walnuts in our house though, and I suggest 2tbs Pyrat rum. Very flavorful cake. Only for some reason everytime I make if I end up with caramel burning on my over floor. I suggest using something larger than even a 9inch pie plate.

This was wonderful! I also used a 9" pan and it came out just great. I also omitted rum and used pecans. Made this as dessert for Easter dinner and was a big hit. Consistency of topping was fine.

I made this cake in a 9" pan and had no problems with the topping boiling over. The cake was so moist and delicious but my topping never became caramel and ended up stuck to the bottom of the pan when I flipped it over. It scraped out pretty easily and made it look more like a coffee cake. Still delicious. I think I didn't cook it long enough on the stove as it was very granular. I'll definitely try it again. Everyone at the dinner party raved about it.

This should have been called the Banana Upside Down Mess Cake. It tastes wonderful, don't get me wrong. I've always loved a banana cake with caramel frosting. I used a 9 inch pan (it's what I have) and followed the recipe except that I used yogurt instead of sour cream in the cake batter. I had no spillage or leakage in the oven, probably because the caramel and nuts baked to the bottom of my pan (I did spray the pan). It will be a long time at the sink to get this pan clean! The cake fell rather unceremoniously out of the pan, broke in several places, and I scraped what nuts I could off the bottom of the pan and dropped them on the top. I salvaged the cake by making a second caramel sauce/icing to drizzle over the sticky nuts. It looks more like a coffee cake now. I can't say I'll do this one again, but it was a nice idea.

Amazing. Be sure to use a 2 inch deep pan to prevent overflow into your oven. I will definitely make this again. The cake is super moist.

Rating: 3
Very good! This would be a great cake to serve to guests. I did not have a 9-inch pan that was 3 inches high so I used my springform pan, which worked very well. The topping does get firmer the longer it sits, so I recommend eating this cake while it's still warm from the oven. If it's still around the next day, it's a bit of a challenge slicing through the topping to get an intact piece. Still yummy though!

After reading all the nixed reviews about some having the caramel boil over and others not, I put it into a tall cake pan and thought I'd be OK. Unfortunately, I ended up with a big mess in the bottom of my oven! The cake was wonderful and the caramel would have been good, so I will definitely do it again - with changes. I'll not cook the caramel as much first, and I'll use a bigger pan (plus something in the oven for drips). Overall very yummy!

I found that the sugar bubbled over so it should be put on a pan with parchment paper. Otherwise very nice.

I was nervous about trying this one because of some of the reviews but I am glad I decided to bite the bullet. A few things I did...I used a smaller PIE pan (that sort of cones toward the bottom) so it would hold the caramel better. I put the pan on a cookie sheet, as I always do when working with caramel in the oven. And last I HALVED the recipe. It turned out SO WONDERFUL, I'd make it again in a heart beat.It was delicious, full of flavor and super moist...even better the next day. I also didn't have any problems with the caramel being hard (a little chewy around the edges the next day, but not hard), when I cooked the sugars in the sauce pan I only let it SIMMER for a minute, not boil...don't know if that would make any difference but it worked perfectly for me. An A+++ in my book!

This was delicious! Thank you to all the reviewers who warned not to make this in an 8" pan; it would've been all over the oven. The 9" pan was still very full. I had a hard time figuring out how long to bake it. Toothpicks kept coming out wet, and I had to put tinfoil over the top or it would've been too brown, possibly even burned, because I put the foil on at least 20 minutes before it came out of the oven. I finally took it out the first time the toothpick came out cleanly, which was only a couple of minutes after the last test had still had batter on it, so I was worried it would be underdone, but I'd already extended the baking time about five times. Fortunately it was perfect - completely baked through, but still moist. We ate the cake warm, and the topping wasn't hard and wasn't gooey, it was perfect.

It is glorified banana bread, but it's really good. A fun way to change up the usual loaf version. Didn't change anything except using a 9 in. pan and lining the bottom with parchment paper to help with cake/caramel removal. Cook time and ingredients worked perfectly.

I am so disappointed with this recipe. The toppping was granular and tough. The cake boiled over the 8inch pan and I had to cook it almost 70 minutes to get the middle done but the sides were burnt. I was in charge of bringing the dessert to a party on Sat. but was too embarrassed to walk in with this disgusting looking mess I left it in the car and threw it out when I got home.

I hate to disrespect Bon Appetit on my first post, but, I don't think that they really tried and tested this recipe as they should have. As other writers have posted this hardly fits into a 8 inch pan and should never be put in one. The batter came clear to the top of the 8 inch pan, and as we as bakers know with baking powder and baking soda this cake is going to rise. This can not be fixed once the caramel is already in the pan and cooled. As I am writing this I smell something burning in the oven, as expected the cake has overflowed and is burning on the bottom of my oven. Is Bon Appetit going to come over and clean my oven? I am a current student (third semester) at the Cambridge School of Culinary Arts and I would certainly not get a passing grade on this recipe. I am very displeased with Bon Appetit to place a recipe with this very misguided information. Anyone who attempts this recipe PLEASE USE A 9 inch PAN!!!!!!!

Hmmm. This is an excellent moist banana bread but the topping just doesn't work for me. It is too sweet. My husband loves the topping but not the cake. By the way, I used an 8" aluminum cake pan that is 3" deep and it fit fine. In fact it baked in exactly 55 mins. I buy mine at a restaurant supply store for about $5.

Just made this - it DOES need a 9" pan - not 8" (it rises above the sides and the "topping" drips onto the oven). It cooked in 55 minutes for me as listed. the cake itself is perfect - moist - great flavour - but the topping is too thick - like taffy - and walnut pieces would be better than halves. thanks.

In reading the various reviews it seems as if the toothpick test may no longer work? I made a cream cheese banana nut bread last week and checked to see if it was done by using a toothpick. The toothpick came out clean but the bread was not done. Does anyone think it may have to do with bananas? The reason I ask is I'd like to make this recipe but don't want to have problems with the cake being undercooked and the topping (bottom) being overcooked. Thanks!!

My wife loved this cake, I did have one problem though. My topping wasn't very "gooey", instead it became kind of hard, not quite like hard candy, but not far off either. I'd say it was similar to the caramel coating on Cracker Jacks only thicker. I was hoping for more of a gooey topping or something closer to the topping of a pineapple upside down cake, as the topping I ended up with made it impossible to cut a decent looking slice. I followed the directions, is it possible my cooking time was a little too long? Any help/advice is appreciated. I'm looking forward to trying again soon.

The day I planned to make this cake by son ate the bananas I was planning to use, I had to substitute an 8-in chocolate layer instead. It was incredible.

If I could give this recipe more than four forks I would. It's awesome, the word "Gooey" used it the magazine is only one wonderful adjective to describe this yummy cake. The only thing I would reccomend like others is use at least a 9 inch pan. The 8 inch is not big enough and it runs over while baking. I dry toasted my walnut first and chopped them up some. Make sure and try this one.

This cake is the bomb!! I solved the 8-inch cake pan problem by using a 9-inch springform pan, with foil on the outside bottom of the pan to prevent any leaks - worked perfectly. I let the cake cool for 15 minutes, per the recipe, then removed the sides, put a plate on the bottom, and flipped it over. I waited five minutes, then gently removed the pan bottom. A few nuts came off with the pan, but they were easily spread back over the cake. I found that the cake needed the full 55 minutes in order to be done, but was still very moist (but not in a runny, underdone way). I also made a few ingredient substitutions, based on what I had on hand: I used light corn syrup instead of dark, pecans instead of walnuts, and bourbon instead of dark rum. I served it with plain, softly whipped cream. YUMMY!! I think next time I might try substituting sweet potato for the banana....

Absolutely must use a 9 inch pan. The cake was absolutely AWESOME! Problem was, the cake took longer than expected and the caramel bcame more...uhm..VERY chewy vs. gooey. And I also did the toothpick thing, came out clean but cake still wasn't done. I think it's the toothpicks they make today...Seriously! Had the same problem with plain old Jiffy Cornbread mix on top of Chipotle Tamale Pie, toothpick came out clean, but cornbread still wasn't done.

I think that the problem you may be having with the cake pan is to make sure that it is at least 2" deep. I have made this cake hundreds of times and never had one problem.

We altered this a little and it became our new family favorite. We only used 1/2 cup banana then added 1/2 cup applesauce. We also replaced the walnuts with pecans.

This is very tasty and easy to make. Definitely a good idea to use a baking sheet or a large piece of foil under the pan while in the oven. Also, I found that the 8 inch pan wasn't large enough to hold all the batter. I did use a handful more of the nuts than the recipe called for, but not so many that it would make that much difference. Next time I'll use a 9- inch pan.
