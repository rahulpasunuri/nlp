Cook ricen longer on all stages of the process. Otherwise pretty good.

This is a wonderful recipe. Yes, it takes a while...but it is a fantastic version of the traditional Spanish arroz con leche. To cut down on time/price, you can use vanilla extract instead of the beans.

The important thing to get the right thikness lies in the proportion of milk, rice and sugar. Honestly it's got me years to get it perfect, perfect for me that is. You may always turn the heat higher at the end if it's too soupy, and add a bit more sugar.

Overall it turned out well however it is a very time consuming recipe. Boiling down the milk mixture takes longer than half an hour. It also came out looking totally different than the picture.

I am not sure why the other reviewers disliked this recipe so much. I have made this twice and have absolutely loved it and received many many accolades from my guests. I follow the recipe exactly. The only shortcoming of the recipe directions is the time it indicates to cook down the milk mixture - it took me 1 hour to get it down to 2 3/4 cups. I also recommend using the Ceylon cinnamon if you can find it. It is delicious.

To the cook from Spain: Gracias! What is with the long grain rice? Rice pudding has probably several variations, but this one is a pretty bad one. I am also from Spain and love "arroz con leche". Your "arroz con leche" turned out very good.

terrible, was extremely soupy and did not thicken even when cooled. I will not make again
