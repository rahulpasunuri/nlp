This is very similar to my grandmother's mint sauce recipe. Incredible with lamb at Easter. Grandma's calls for 1/2c less mint, minced, and adds it at the sugar stage, not the general cooking stage. Also her general cooking stage was a bit shorter than 1/2hr (Might be the reason for the "grey color" and faded mint comment.) Also, instead of prepared mustard, hers calls for 1 oz of mustard seed, which provides a nice texture. Mustard seeds come out with a pickly flavor that pops apart in your mouth. Really a great recipe.

It a waste of mint. An ugly grey color, the mint flavor faded away in the cooking. The tomatoes vanished too. I threw the whole batch away. Flavor was okay.

I diced the onions, tomatoes and raisins, for additional texture, which I appreciated. The mint flavour is quite subtle, and perhaps could be increased.
