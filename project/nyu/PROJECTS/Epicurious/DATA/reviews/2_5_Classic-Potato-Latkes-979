This recipe is just perfect! Grease no longer splatters all over my kitchen, which is a big problem with other recipes. While the latkes are a little bland, they turn out perfectly crispy and meaty in the middle. I made them three times now, and they were great and consistent each time!

I've made this several times and find it to be a good standby for a classic latke. I always wind up adding nearly double the flour and generally wind up baking the latkes to finish them. Happy Hanukkah.

I have a wonderful hint for those who think the preparation time added to the cooking time is too much to do all at once. I make the batter up to 3 days ahead. The potatoes won't turn black if the batter is stored in the refrigerator in an air tight jar or plastic container. Just leave a bit of room at the top and completely cover with a layer of flour. When ready to cook, skim off and discard the flour. The flavor is wonderful because all the ingredients have time to blend together.

There is a very definite no-no in this recipe: Do not put those potatoes in a food processor unless you want to invent a new dish. Where have all the graters gone? Any supermarket has a perfectly acceptable one for about $3.00. They also do a fine job with cheese, zucchini (lovely in latkes) and many other things.

It's so much fun to read all of the passionate comments from the other cooks. "My mother made it this way!...My Aunt made it that way!...My way is better!..." This is what makes the old family ties work and make handing down recipes, through the family, so special. I hope we all know know that there is only ONE perfect recipe - the one your grandmother (or some other special family member) taught you. Latkes are no exception. Now let's talk about the perfect brisket.

Real latkes have hand grated potatoes, grated onions, eggs, matzoh meal and for super crisp results, strain grated potato and onion mixture in a fine mesh sieve. Collect the drained liquid. The liquid will seperate into water and potato starch. Spill off water and add potato starch back to mixture. Real latkes are never processed in a machine. Grate on the fine side of a box grater.

I disagree with the reviewer who says that latkes do not have onion. I have never, ever made latkes without them.

This is not a classic latke recipe. Classic latkes do not have onion in them. Not even close to my grandma's.

This is not a classic latke recipe...the potatoes should be grated by hand, and the flour should be replaced with matzoh meal. In a food processor, the potatoes become mushy. Also, soak the grated potatoes in cold salt water for about half an hour before adding the other ingredients and frying. That's a real latke.

You know, I have to disagree . . . they weren't quite my grandma's latkes, but they came out light and crispy--didn't have any trouble with gumminess from the flour, although I didn't add quite as much as called for. With sour cream and homeade applesauce, they were a great supper.

I agree! This was quite possibly the most disappointing latke recipe--my mother's are MUCH better. It really did taste like wet flour.

I'm with Louise...no flour or such in REAL potato pancakes. The egg/onion/potato proportions are good but do add l/2 cup of potato starch per 2 pounds. I've tried about 6 different recipes/styles, this is best. Also, 1" of peanut oil very hot will keep them greaseless. Finally, keep squeezing water out of potatoes as they sit while others are cooking to keep em crisp. Keep the starch that settles in the bottom, though!

My Nana taught me to grate the potatoes by hand, then rinse out the starch and then drain, shake and squeeze out the water. Then, add grated onion, eggs and matzoh meal, salt and pepper. Also, she said that if you try to fry them in just a bit of oil, they absorb too much of it, but if you use a lot (1" deep), they won't be greasy. And truly, my Nana was always right.

The proportions of potato, egg and onion are ok. What needs to be eliminated is the baking powder and flour. Both my grandmother and mother used POTATO STARCH- sold around Passover - as the drying ingredient. Use about 1/2 cup for this recipe and double accordingly. Matzo meal or regular flour is bad. With potato starch you get a crispy outside and a soft creamy inside.

I tried this and thought that it tasted to much like wet flour. I will try it again without the flour and baking power

Classic potato pancakes use matzo meal,not white flour,that makes them a little gummy.The baking soda is also not needed.Also you can add a little white vinegar to the potatoes after you shred them,this will keep them white for hours.When you squeeze the water out the vinegar taste goes with it.If you can't find matzo meal semolina flour is a good,crunchy substitute.

A friend and I undertook this one despite other users dissaisfaction and would do it again. It made tasty, perfect classic potato latkes!

This recipe doesn't really need the water squeezed out of it. If you add another small onion and another egg, they have a wonderful pancake quality to them. But I guess that would be a different recipe, wouldn't it?

This is a recipe that is okay, but I'm with the person that uses grated potatoes and onions and fries them in about 1/2 inch of oil. They are one of my favorites and are wonderful with either dinner or breakfast.

Get real! This isn't a recipe for food that should be fed to humans in the dead of winter. Potato pancakes should be BIG, made from SHREDDED potatoes (and if some knuckle skin gets grated off also, so much the better) and SHREDDED ONION as well. They should be deep fried in a kettle of hot oil (6 tablespoons? how about a dutch oven with 1/2 gallon of hot oil instead?) and they should be as big as a fist. After a day of playing hockey outside in subzero weather, nothing could be better than a meal of roast beast and BIG, BIG, BIG potato pancakes.
