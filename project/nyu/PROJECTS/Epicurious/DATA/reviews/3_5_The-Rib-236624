PERFECT. I did the 425 degrees, 15 mins per pound and it was absolutely delicious and perfect. All i did was put on salt & pepper.

I wasn't used to not seeing a recipe, so I used my own. Rub standing roast with 1 part rosemary, 1 part garlic powder, 2 parts salt, and 2 parts freshly ground black pepper. Seal in plastic wrap and let sit in refrigerator for 12 hours. I use a cookshack smoker and I smoke the roast at 250 degrees with sprigs of rosemary, garlic bulbs, and a small chunk of pecan wood. I use a remote thermometer and leave the roast in the smoker until the temp is 118 degrees. I then take the roast out and wrap it in double foil, and double towels and let it rest in a styrofoam cooler for 1/2 to 1 hr.During this time the meat temperature will rise from 118 to 130 or 135. After the rest period I will finish the roast on a hot grill or a 500 degeree plus oven on broil for about 5 to 8 minutes to crisp up the outside. mmmmm.....enjoy!

Lighten up lquinlivan! All she did was provide the method and you can season any way you like. Everyone who actually tried the recipe loved it. The whole point is any way you season it, in my case, with lots of salt, garlic and black pepper, you have a perfect meal as long as you follow the guidelines. She's giving you poetic license, which if you aren't very creative, you might not know what to do with it.

I have a new oven, and I think it may be set a bit low. That said, 15 min. per lb. plus 5 min only got my 3.5lb roast to 100 degrees internal temp. I added an extra 4 min per pound, and wound up with medium side of medium rare. In the future, I'm going with a straight 18 min/lb. like my mom always told me. The flavor was outstanding. I smeared with olive oil, salt, cayenne pepper (sparing), crushed garlic, and dried thyme.

I just made this for Christmas Eve dinner with the inlaws to rave reviews. I marinated the roast for just a couple hours in mustard with chopped fresh rosemary and thyme. I then opted to cook it at 425 degrees the whole time, per the recommendation, brushing melted butter over the roast every 20 minutes. While the meat was resting, I made a reduction sauce while deglazing with butter, cabernet sauvignon, beef stock, flour, water, salt and pepper. Yowza!

I marinate the roast in equal parts soy and worchester sauce, plus garlic and Italian spices for 3-4 hours. Placing a meat thermometer in the center, place the roast in a 450 degree oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off and don't open the door until the meat thermometer rises to desired temperature, depending upon your preference of rare to well done meat. I usually go for 130-135 because we like it rare. Go for 140 if you don't. This usually takes an additional hour, so if the meat thermometer hasn't reached 130, I have turned the oven back on to 325 and it takes just a few minutes to catch up. You will LOVE the flavors!
