Made the recipe as written except for the pie crust which tasted the same as the roll out one from the store-I thought it was very good but cold use a little more flavor-maybe 2 leeks and the addition of cheese as other reviewers stated.

This was delicious and easy! Very popular at the dinner party I went to last night- the tarragon was a hit.

Good recipe. I used cream freche, because I had some left over, a 13 inch flan pan pushed me to add an extra egg, and I added about 1/4 cup parmesan and it came out quite well. I also cut the asparagus into bite-size pieces as somebody suggested--not as elegant, but easier to eat. It was a bit time consuming to make--the long cooking and cooling time--but not difficult. It has a delicate flavour that really allows the asparagus to shine. I'll make it again.

I also agree it's a great recipe. Making the crust from scratch was worth the effort. I may also try it next time with a cup of gruyere added, as some other reviewers have successfully done. The custard turned out light and flavorful, with the tarragon adding a lovely subtle flavor. As I didn't have the right type of pan available, I used a 10" springform pan and still got excellent results.

This is an excellent recipe. I added a cup of gruyere cheese and it complemented the flavours wonderfully. Will definitely make this one again.

Don't skip the crust - it's worth making it. Very good recipe. I made it many times by now and it never disappoints. I like to use white pepper here.

Just to reinforce what everyone said, this is a great recipe. I made it for Easter dinner and got raves. I used a 9" tart pan so I cooked it for less time. But otherwise followed the recipe to the T.

I made so many modifications; I hate to taint the fork rating system. The purpose of my trying this recipe was to find a good crust for a savory tart. I made the crust using my food processor just as instructed with no modifications and it turned out wonderfully, flaky and really quite tasty. For the filling I changed the following (basically using what I had on hand) and would still give it a 4 fork rating: Fat free cream instead of heavy, egg beaters instead of eggs, red onions in place of leeks and I added some Gruyere cheese and decided what the heck, why not go for the quiche like seasonings: nutmeg and all spice. With these changes I would probably mot serve it to guests but for an every day kind of meal it was pretty tasty. Like any good recipe, this one can be modified quite easily.

I used a frozen crust because I didn't have the time to make the pastry. This was a delicious, creamy and wonderful variation to add to any Easter dinner. It was great cold and warm.

I used a frozen pastry crust to save time. The filling was so creamy, and I especially liked the combination of tarragon & asparagus.

I made this to go with Easter dinner and it was fabulous. I couldn't find a flan ring anywhere, so decided to make the crust in a pie tin and then, as suggested, just trimmed the top excess after I filled the tin. It was a very pretty centerpiece on my table for Easter.

I just made this for the first time and my husband and I loved it. Made some substitutions which worked out great. Used pillsbury pie crust. Substituted leek w/1 large vidalia onion carmelized in oil and a bit of white wine. Used 1tsp dry tarragon. Added about 7 pinches of fennel seeds to batter, which gave an excellent flavor (though mostly the ones sprinkled on top after pouring batter in seemed to stay most fragrant). Didn't bother slicing asparagus crosswise, but I did cut them into small pieces. Used a deep pie dish and then cut the excess dough down to the batter line. It was brown all over in just 18+25 mins. Just cooled it 10 mins before eating. Excellent! The custard tasted great, but it didn't hold together that well in cutting and didn't have much "body". I'll look for a mousakka-type bechamel to try next time.

This was VERY delicious. Delicate flavor. I used a store bought pie crust which made this a quick and easy recipe.

We loved it! The pastry even came out great, though I had to be careful not to tear it. The filling was nice and light. I used leeks and also added sauteed crimini mushrooms. Seasoned with thyme and herbs du provence, sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top. Tastes really good and looks great on a spring table!

Fantastic! I made this for Easter. The store was out of leeks so I substituted beautiful vidalia onions. I also made individual tarts so I doubled the crust and filling ingredients (to serve 8). I didn't need to double the cutard ingredients and I reduced the baking time slightly. This was a terrific recipe that even my husband - who likes neither asparagus nor custard - ate every last bit.

Very nice recipe. I cheated and used pre-made rolled pie crusts, which were just fine for a weeknight dinner. Don't care for tarragon, so substituted thyme, which was quite good. Also made mini-versions for Easter dinner, which were well-received. You can cut the asparagus before you cook it - saves time cooking.

It's showy and tasty. Everyone loved it with Easter dinner yesterday.

This is a great recipe that is easy to make and is sure to impress. The pastry is delicious and the custard is suprisingly light. I've added this to my brunch repetoire. After I put the custard in the oven, I had a little of the pastry and filling left over. With the extra, I made a cute little mini pie in a muffin tin.
