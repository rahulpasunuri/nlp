Loved it. Simple flavors are terrific when used with great ingredients. I may add some clam broth next time and another jalapeno. Definitely a keeper for me.

I thought this was a great soup. Other reviewers complained of little flavor, I disagree! Taking cues from other reviewers I up'd the garlic, chili powder and jalapeno (used 1/2 with seeds). If you do not like spice, you may want to cut back. I crushed 4 whole canned tomatoes when I added the corn broth and corn kernels and added 2 to the blender while pureeing. This gave it the nice reddish color you see in the photo and a nice additional flavor. I also added my salt (fluer del sel) throughout the cooking process which increased the flavors. I've had it 3 nights in a row for dinner.

okay, I'm giving this recipe 4 forks, but only with a huge addendum... it's really bland. brilliant, but bland. there are folks that will say that what I'm about to recommend will muddy the crab, but I'm going forward. I started making this soup three years ago, with three (or so) chilis in adobo sauce. I also don't think you need to make the tortilla strips from scratch, just find a good bite- y brand of organic corn chip that's a little thicker than the average fluffy chip. absolutely amazing soup. for those who like lotsa heat (as we do, I'm from Louisiana) through in a bunch of cayenne.

I just made this recipe to keep for a week night dinner. I made it from the leftover corn we had from dinner. Because the corn was already cooked, I didn't have any problem with the corn tasting "inedible." I haven't added the crab yet because I don't have any handy in the house. The corn chowder is fabulous without the crab, can't wait to taste the soup with it.

I don't know why the original reviewers were so negative. I made this soup tonight and loved it! I increased the cilantro, garlic, and jalapenos and it was wonderful!

Really good. As with most recipes that come from professionals, you have to tweak it for the home cook. Cook the mixture at least ten minutes before adding the crab. Uncooked corn is not digestible. Add more chili powder. Some half-and-half makes it superior. Hint: that's why everything tastes better in restaurants. They load on the butter and cream (and then advertise it as a "light entree"!) It's all in the marketing.

I don't know what others did wrong but this recipe turned out great. My cooks intuition told me not to used the water so I just subbed more chicken broth. You can pump up the spice ingredients if desired. The result was great and the crispy tortilla strips are a must.

This was an excellent recipe with a few major changes. I read all the reviews and took everyone's advice and made it last night. Very tasty! I used a LARGE bunch of cilantro, doubled the garlic and used 1/8 cup of mild New Mexico chili powder and 1/8 cup of medium New Mexico powder (not fond of ancho chili powder) and then followed the recipe. The extra chili powder gave it the rich red color without much heat. Also, added the juice of one whole lime instead of 1 teaspoon.

I have made this about three times since I got the magazine in the mail. It is very good and not at all bland if properly seasoned with salt and pepper. Also, more jalapeno could be added or ancho chile powder. My husband liked it and he loves spicy food! I will say that the picture is misleadingly red. You'd have to add a bit more chile powder to make the broth that red at that stage in the cooking --it looks like they are pouring in the corn puree. But that wouldn't be a bad idea! Still this is a good recipe.

We did enjoy this soup. However, I did doctor the recipe. I also noted the picture appeared that the broth was red so I added some fresh tomatoes. I also added some adobo sauce and used one jalapeno with seeds for more heat. We especially LOVED the tortilla strips linked to the recipe.

Really sounded good but ended up as spiced-up dishwater, waste of good ingredients especially expensive meat out here in Nevada. Don't waste your time or effort.

The picture has a red base but there are no tomatoes in the recipe! You can doctor the heck out of it (adding fresh pureed tomatoes, etc., but better find another recipe--and they do exist.

I was going to try this tonight because the idea of it sounded so yummy. After reading the comments and re-reading the ingredients I wonder if this recipe doesn't need a salt pork or good smokey bacon base to enhance the flavor. While sweet corn is delicious, this much corn without sufficient salt to enhance the flavor would be really boring and very sweet, especially with rich crab meat. I think I might also consider making the corn cob broth with milk instead of water, just for a little more depth. Thanks to all for the reviews.

Agreed. I used the best ingredients and the result was simply... bland. This is a waste of high-dollar crab meat and the beautiful sweet corn that is abundant right now. To add insult to injury, the leftovers are actually worse the next day. I wish one of us had posted our review earlier :)

Sounded wonderful - tasted like lousy crab water - I used the best possible chicken broth - fresh corn and crab - extra jalapeno peppers. Do yourselves a favor - don't try this! P.S. - We are ardent fans of both Gourmet and Bon Appetit, and to be fair, most recipes we've tried in the past 10 years have been very good to excellent, but once in a while, you run into a stinker.
