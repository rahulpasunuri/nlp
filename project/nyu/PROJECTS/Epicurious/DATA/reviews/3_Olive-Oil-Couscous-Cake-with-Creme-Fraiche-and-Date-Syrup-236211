Nice cake, but doesn't "wow" you. Definitely need to drizzle the date syrup and decorate with dates to make it look special. Best for capping off an authentic Moroccan meal or for a non- dairy dinner. That said, served it to a large crowd and everyone really liked it. Added 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 teaspoon of orange flower water.

I made some changes, so Purists, get off my back! That said, I added a tsp. of vanilla and cardamom the first time I made it. Then, for my second try, I subbed honey for sugar (1 c. sugar = 1/3 c. honey), making a few other changes to account for the moisture, then added 1/2 c. ground toasted walnuts. To die for! Really easy and very nice for a dairy and refined sugar free dessert.

Using the couscous gave this cake a nice texture. Its very light, but wasn't anything special.

The cake is fine - BUT there's a BIG difference between couscous and bulgur... I used semolina and, well, from what I can see they remained all crunchy and NOT cooked... I am laughing at myself but there should be more clarification. I'm going to have to redo the recipe ... grrr.

Wonderful cake that our guests loved. Recommend XX virgin oil and making your own date syrup. Sprinkle gold flakes on the cake for a really over the top presentation.

I thought the cake was too oily. The flavor was nice but the texture was a complete downer. I can move on to a new challenge.

Wonderful, easy and surprisingly light and airy! An absoulte keeper, guests raved. Unique ingredients. Only change was an addition of 1 tsp vanilla to the batter.
