This is wonderful! My guests couldn't get enough. I only made two changes: For the tapenade, I used all the ingredients recommended but only 1 T of vegetable oil. I marinated the steak for about 5 hours and did let it sit out for 1 hour before grilling. I did not make the tomatoes part of this recipe as I had lots of fresh basil and did tomatoes/mozzarella/basil as a side to the Steak/Tapenade.

I made this with skirt steak and it was great. (I didn't make the tomatoes because they weren't in season.) The tapenade was a bit too oily, but otherwise amazing, and I did include the minced anchovy. Also, the orange flavor was a bit too strong in the meat. This may have been because I let it marinate for a couple hours in the fridge, in addition to the hour at room temperature. I will definitely make this again, but with less oil in the tapenade and only one hour of marinating.

Good steak recipe -- nice change from our family's standard garlic, red wine, etc. Awesome tapenade recipe! Tasted great with the steak, but I have made the tapenade now multiple times for parties, and I often get asked for the recipe. Easy & delicious. For the tapenade, I always use the anchovy, always chop it all in the food processor, have never used extra olive oil -- the combo of the 1/3 cup olive oil & the vegetable oil is plenty to keep the tapenade nicely wet.

I made this recipe last night and everyone loved it. The only issue I had was with the tapenade. The list of ingredients called for 1/3 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup vegetable oil. The directions called for only the olive oil. I added both oils and ended up draining the tapenade.

This was excellent. Tossed the marinade ingredients into the blender, using the whole orange, minus the pith. Next time, I will probably replace the chili flakes with a habanero, but we like a little heat. Love tapenade, and this one came together with a few pulses in the blender. I marinated some tomatoes and mozz, using up some fresh herbs from the veggie drawer, to go with.

Are two tbl smoked paprika really necessary on a grilled steak?

This is a perfect recipe! I had relatives over for a summer grill out and this steak was a home run. I agree with the other reviews to marinade the steak for longer than 1 hour. The tapenade really was delicious so don't leave that out! It was also very pretty to plate with the tomatoes and greens. I used arugula instead of watercress and a prime sirloin instead of a flank. I can't wait to serve this again!

I tried this recipe (minus the tomatos; I made a tomato and mozzarella salad instead) with a good skirt steak and it was fantastic. The tapenade goes amazingly well with the steak. I'd recommend marinating for a little longer, as well as cooking at a lower heat, but overall this is a gem.

I made this recipe twice this week...once for the hub and the other for my sister and her family. I used a sirloin flap steak and it was very tender. I also grated the garlic and shallots into the marinade. I do not think that the tapenade is essential to the dish. I also used arugula instead of watercress. I will definitely be making this again.

What a delicious recipe! I marinated the steaks early in the morning and let them sit in the refrigerator all day. About an hour before grill time I took the steaks out and let them get to room temperature. The meat was tender and so flavorful. I will definitely make this recipe agin!
