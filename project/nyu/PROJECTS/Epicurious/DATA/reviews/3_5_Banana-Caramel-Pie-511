I was looking for a quick, simple everyday dessert and this one used both bananas and caramel which I had on hand and wanted to use up. I used a chocolate ready to bake crust and added a bit more caramel as suggested. I agree with the others, it doesn't impress, but it certainly satisfies!

This is an easy, tasty, family-style dessert. It's not a show-stopper, but it gives really good flavor for minimal effort. I've probably made it six times in the past couple of years, and will surely make it again

I feel that this recipe is just blah! It just didn't do a thing for me or my family. I should have spent a little more time and made a regular banana cream. It tasted OK, but I wouldn't make it again,and if I'm short on time I'll just grab something from the bakery.

This is a nice dessert if you need one in a hurry. Prep time is minimal. The flavor was good, but I would probably add a little more caramel next time. This isn't the type of dessert that will impress anyone, but it's not bad. I'd make it again if I needed something in a hurry.

My mother made this for a summertime cookout desert. It seemed that it would be heavy but we all found it to be surprisingly lite. I have made it multiple times myself and people never seem to be able to have just one piece.

While I did not have high expectations for this, I was very pleasantly surprised! I could not find a vanilla wafer crust, so I just used a graham cracker crust. It was very enjoyable, and a cinch to put together. My husband raved...he NEVER does that about dessert!
