Awesome recipe! Also very, very easy. I made it exactly as written, except for substituting leeks for the mushrooms, just because my husband doesn't like them. I assume it's even more delicious with the Shitakes. I loved that there wasn't as much chopping as most asian recipes. I also think it's worth using bone-in breasts and taking the meat off - it only took a few minutes - as they are far more flavorful than boneless.

Wonderful. Make sure you reduce the sauce enough as the Napa adds its own liquid. Used thighs and legs only. I made it ahead to the point of adding the Napa so that the vegetables would not be overcooked and prepared the last bit as my guests were being seated.

This makes a passably good soy braise, but the hoisin and chili sauce muddle the flavors compared to the wonderful braises my mom and grandmother used to make. I used chicken drumsticks and didn't bother to take the meat off the bones. I was also out of star anise, so I just used a good spoonful of five-spice instead. I had a gorgeous farmers market Napa cabbage, and its beautiful color and crunch are what really made the dish.

Loved this. Very different from the flavors I usually get from the Asian foods I cook, yet with ingredients I pretty much always have around. I used chicken thighs, and only one bunch onions, but otherwise followed recipe almost exactly. Next time, I might save time by not shredding the chicken, just serving atop. But even still, it was so much easier than many of the other Chinese food recipes I read.

This has been a forgotten item in my recipe box for years, so I tried it last night simply as a braised dish of chicken on the bone - no cabbage, no pulling the meat off the bone. Did it all in my oversized Cuisinart electric skillet. I used a 3-lb cut up kosher chicken, browned as directed, then sauteed Vidalia spring onions, shitakes (reconstituted from dried), ginger & garlic. Added just 2 cups chicken stock prepared from the mushroom-soaking liquid, 1/3 cup Hoisin, about 2 tsp sambal olek, and 1/2 tsp ground star anise. Once the chicken was done, removed and reduced the sauce to a lovely almost syrupy consistency, and returned the chicken to my pan to stay warm while finishing the rest of dinner. Served with brown rice and asparagus sauteed in butter & sesame seeds - looking forward to the leftovers tonight.

Good recipe, but the cooking time can be shortened considerably by following a more "Chinese" cooking method (which my family loves). (I studied Chinese cooking for 2 years.) First, use skinned, boneless chicken breasts cut into thin strips. Marinate them for 1/2 hour in a tablespoon of sweet wine and a teaspoon of cornstarch mixed with a teaspoon of cold water. Stir fry the chicken in the veggie oil and remove when cooked through. Add the ginger and garlic to the wok/pan and stir fry for 15 seconds. Add the shiitakes (cut in thin strips), baby bok choi leaves and green onions, stir- fried chicken strips, 2 tablespoons of hoisin sauce, handfull of cashews, star anise and 1 cup chicken broth and cook for 10 minutes open. Add 1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon cold water and stir in the wok till thickened. Add 1 tablespoon chili sauce and about a teaspoon of sesame oil. Remove star anise. Put on serving dish and sprinkle with remaining green onions. This is much faster and much more "Chinese".

This is very good. Used beef briskets and cooked it for 2 hours until the meat fell to pieces. A bit sweet. Added chilli flakes for spice. Will definitely make again.

Wonderful, full of flavor without being overwhelming. We will certainly be making this again and adding it to the family's recipe books, It's simply awesome. My husband went back for third's and as a personal trainer and fitness freak that says multitudes about this dish.

This was a great dish, so many different tastes. Even tastes great as leftovers. I would make this again for sure.

Made it for 2 and it was sweeter than we'd anticipated. 1 caveat--it does not reheat well.

Excellent. Simple and tasty. My 4 & 2 year-old kids both enjoyed this dish... Hoinsin flavouring is very appealing to most kids.

Incredible Recipe!!!!! Took slightly longer to prepare than I thought, but well worth it. Going to try it again with different meats. Oh, if you like really spicy, you need to add peppers or more chili sauce as the amount called for didn't even tingle.

We've made this dish several times now. Just terrific. We have the butcher cut up a whole D'Artatagnan chicken into 8 pieces. Serve it with brown rice. I get the star anise and sriracha hot sauce from the Asian market. They last a very very long time. Make the trip. It's worth it!

Great recipe, I used a pressure cooker for a quick week night meal and it worked great, just needed to reduce the liquid after cooking though. HINT: Asian grocery stores sell big bags of star anise for $2-$3, regular grocery stores charge an arm and a leg for spices. I have found many "bulk" spice deals at ethnic grocery stores. Check for them in your area, you can find great deals there!

After eating this dish I thought of how many people will never taste what we have tasted via this site's recipes. Star Anise, a licorice-like spice, MAKES this dish. I have made it with chicken and with beef and prefer the beef (boneless chuck roast, cut up in chunks, simmered until falling apart). No cabbage in the supermarket (remember the California strike?) so used bok choy instead. Soothing and fillling.

easy and yummy. Great Flavors, and wonder how 1/2 a cabbage makes 4+ cups....I dunno!

The cook below needs to learn how to, well, cook. Maybe that person should stick to mac and cheese. If you follow the directions to this recipe, you will get a lovely, tasty dish that most everyone will want seconds (and thirds) of.

This was nasty. I don't know why it received so many forks from everything. What a waste of time and star anise!

ahhhhh--epicurious, thank you for yet another exquisite recipe. This was absolutely delicious! I cooked it with basmati rice and I didn't have any hot sauce so I added 2 dried Chinese chili peppers towards the end for just enough heat...the star anise was worth driving around town for...found it in a natural food store for those of you who also don't have it readily available. Please try this recipe--it is awesome!

This recipe was fantastic...full of wonderful flavors and smells! As another cook suggested, I used boneless chicken breasts rather than going through the process of removing skin and bones later. I browned the chicken breasts, removed from pot and after totally cooking the rest of the dish added the chicken back to the pot for maybe the last 5 minutes of cooking to avoid drying it out. I also added about a tablespoon of sesame oil at the end which we all agreed made a wonderful taste difference. A friend of mine, even though she hates star anise, fell in love with this dish...she loved it so much she's making it herself this weekend! This is a definite make again dish......very, very flavorful and quite easy to make!!

This recipie is wonderful. My husband is a very picky eater, so I was a little worried he wouldn't like some of the exotic ingredients. But he absolutely loved it! He had two huge bowlsfull. It was very spicy and very flavorful--just the way we like things. And it made our kitchen smell just great!

I've been making this for ourselves and for company ever since it first appeared in BA. This is a super dish--the house smells great while you're cooking it, and it is quick to put together, hearty, and very tasty. I just use boneless skinless breasts cut into bite-size pieces from the start--make sure not to overcook, and it still stays juicy and good.

the only thing i would say is napa cabbage is a wonderful substitution to regular or baby bok choy...also, a sprinkling of cashews and sesame oil before serving add a little texture and flavor...
