I'm rating this recipe as a 3-star, because it needs some modifications to make it a 4. For the brine, it will make the shrimp WAY too salty if you use "large" (aka 31/35 count per pound) shrimp, and especially if you leave them in the brine for more than an hour. I used extra jumbo (16/20), brined for one hour, and rinsed them thoroughly and they turned out just right. AND you must be sure to put NO salt in the marinade. As for preparing the shrimp, when they say "open the shrimp" I am assuming they meant "butterfly", which allows more of the marinade to get in and around the shrimp. You really should leave the shells on, otherwise the marinade is lost and the shrimp gets too charred while grilling. For the marinade, I swapped black pepper for red pepper, and added dijon mustard, zest of lemon, basil and tarragon. You'll note a couple of these ingredients in the roasted garlic sauce, which is why I think it was OK to ditch the sauce altogether. The shrimp were so flavorful and moist while having a good bite they didn't really need anything additional. Oh, and I let them marinate longer than I wanted (~1 hour versus the 20 minutes I planned on), but it turned out great. I think that since there wasn't any lemon juice in the marinade, and just less-acidic wine, they didn't "cook" as much in the marinade. Served these at a party and people were eating them straight off the platter with their hands!

For the amount of total time it takes to make this dish, I'd expect the end result to be better. Not that these shrimp were bad, but 4 forks....no way.

this is a new and delicious way to prepare shrimp. Spending a quiet saturday evening at home and wanting something light, yet delicious. This seemed to fit the bill. The shrimp was really moist and held it's tenderness. The sauce was a different story. Although I didn't have all the ingredients (was out of capers, so I sub with just a bit of vinegar) we just didn't like it. We would use something maybe, creamier like an aioli next time.

Light, refreshing and delightful for a summer dish a little different just when you have lots of herbs to use up. Don't think it's good enough to buy all the fresh herbs in the winter months, but I will be making it again whem my own fresh herbs are in season.

This is by far the best method to grilling shrimp. It leaves the shrimp tender, juicy & delicious!

Unbelievably delicious!!! I peeled the shrimp and did not butterfly them. The double marinating was absorbed by the shrimp resulting in the best tasting grilled shrimp I have ever made. Served with orzo pasta tossed with a little of the sauce and grilled corn. Will make this for guests we are having to our summer home.

This recipe is awesome, truly one of my favorites on this site. For the brine I cut back on the salt and leave the shrimp in for an hour. They turn out tasting as rich as lobster.The sauce is incredible.So yummy you don't want to waste a drop of it.You must try this one!

Incredibly delicious! My husband compared the texture of the grilled shrimp to lobster (and he LOVES lobster!) There isn't a thing I'd change about this recipe, but would definitely recommend using very large or jumbo shrimp. I'll definitely make this again. It went really well with the Black Bean and Tomato Vinaigrette salad on this site.

I loved this recipe, but agree that it is salty. I reduced salt and rinsed shrimp very well, but was still a bit salty. Wondering if anyone's tried recipe deleting salt entirely? Also, as suggested, did not bother with sauce and added more garlic to marinade. Shrimp were unbelievably tender and moist, esp for being grilled. Even tho I peeled them before putting them in brine, the flavor was terrific! Agree jumbo shrimp -- think I used 12 - 14/llb -- work best. Will definitely make again, but may drop salt altogether.

This was a nice inspiration. I made it yesterday as an appetizer for our July 4th bbq, and it was a huge hit. I used fresh jalapenos instead of the dried red peppe. To simplify a bit, I did not do the sauce, so added garlic to the marinade, and that was great . It's really easy and really tasty!

Ihave to say that reading prior reviews made me want to try this recipe, wrong! It was very salty, almost inedible and the herb sauce was not at all tasty. Sorry to have wasted all that time roasting the garlic, only to not use it.

Tender, moist, and packed with flavor; a truly dynamite dish. The brine makes a huge difference (2.5 hrs) although I would've backed off on the salt a touch. I laid the shrimp over some natural rice and steamed asparagus all topped off with the garlic-herb sauce. My better half and I are all about a bit of 'zing' and this fit the bill. This will be on the "regular" list.

Rating: 4
The 3-hour brine procedure makes a big difference. The shrimp plump up and remain juicy throughout the grilling process. I did not bother with cutting the shrimp, in fact I removed the shell (except for the last rib and tail) before putting them in the brine. Easier to eat, and all of the flavour stays in the shrimp. This is a winner.

I make this recipe often for gatherings since it is time consuming but I really just use this one for the brine mixture. The sauce is fine, nothing great, but nice. But brining the shrimp make them more succulent right off the grill. Recommend the brine and then add your favorite oil-garlic-herb based marinade. Can't go wrong.

I was disappointed with this recipe b/c after all the reviews I was expecting to be blown away. It is a solid grilled shrimp recipe but nothing extraordinary. We grill shrimp at least once a week and I was hoping to add a new recipe to our lineup. For the amount of prep involved, the end result was not worth it. I honestly couldn't tell the difference with the brine (3 hrs.) Try the Grilled Sweet & Spicy Shrimp with Mint Dipping Sauce from this site - it is WONDERFUL!

it's the best shrimp recipe that I have used and to no credit of my own, it's become my signature dish. It's so good right off the grill that I never knew there was a roasted garlic and herb sauce.

Rating: 4
I have never had a dish so quickly devoured! I made a mistake and purchased shrimp already shelled but the results were the same as when I have made the recipe with the shells left on. I reduced the salt to 3 Tbs of Kosher and let them brine for an hour. Added an extra clove of garlic to the marinade. You must rinse the shrimp thoroughly to rid them of the salt. The shrimp are so wonderful grilled that I have never made the garlic-herb sauce.

Awesome shrimp! We all agreed that they tasted like lobster. Will be making again this weekend for guests.

This is an outstanding and easy recipe. Added a little fresh/minced ginger to the oil. I would suggest using 10/12 count or larger shrimp. The larger shrimp eliminate using a sissior to butterfly them. I just cut through the back side of each one with a sharp knife, like little lobsters. And the 2 pounds I made fed 4 people, not 1 1/2 lbs for 6 servings as the recipe indicates. They are so good you will want more!

This has to be one of my favorite shrimp recipes ever. It's always a winner at any barbeque and your friends will marvel at how good they are! I agree with all of the comments that the sauce is great, but is not really needed if you're trying to make the recipe more simple and easy. I did leave the shells on as is stated in the recipe, and it was some of the juiciest shrimp I've ever had.

I just made this recipe and both my boyfriend and I found it amazing. On the suggestion of the previous reviewers, I omitted the sauce - there's no need, the shrimp falls right off the shell and is moist and delicious. This is high-end restaurant quality and worth every minute of prep time.

Shrimp was awesome! I used rosemary flavored olive oil & added a little fresh rosemary and extra garlic to the marinade. Did not bother making the sauce-doesn't need it!

The worst thing about this, was my time I had to make it. We decided to make Grilled Shrimp with about an hour before dinner. Saw this recipe, and got the ingredients. My change up: I boiled the brine and prepared the shrimp and marinade. The marinade I changed crushed red peppers with some Cajun powder. Once the brine was at a rolling boil, I turned it off heat and added the shrimp. Let it sit in the brine for 10 minutes, drain(the shrimp may start to turn pink), then placed them in the marinade for 30-40 minutes. Then grilled. Even with my prep time being short, this shrimp turned out FANTASTIC. My next run at this will be to make it per the directions, time willing of course. Worst thing that my happen... I have two grilled shrimp recipies.

This recipe is fantastic. The best and most succulent grilled shrimp ever!!! I did take the advice of several other reviewers: the salt reduced to 3 tbl. makes the brown sugar "sweetness" perfect; I also add a little cayenne to the brine; like the Japanese cook I leave the shells and feet on the shrimp, as they TRULY should be left on for succulence and flavor - it doesn't matter if you carefully slit the back to the tail - these shrimp practically fall out of the shell after cooking, there is no struggle peeling, and in addition the bright pink shells, slightly charred, add beauty to the serving; and, they should be cooked open and flat on grill with flesh side down. My own changes are to use double the garlic in the marinade and substitute fresh basil for the parsley. The basil is much tastier and with the salt reduced, the basil mixes so well with that slight brown sugar after-taste. Finally, the Roasted Garlic sauce, while delicious, is unnecessary and confusing with these shrimp.

Fantastic! Brining makes all the difference. The shrimps were incredibly soft and tasty. The best shrimp I've made. As the previous reviewer said, I think it's important to rinse the shrimps. I rinsed thoroughly, but it was still a little bit salty. Still loved it because of great texture!

Well, in reviewing this recipe I realize that I drained the shrimp after brining but did not rinse them. I guess that is why they were SO SO salty. Could not tast the heat at all. Might try it again.

This is the BEST shrimp recipe I have ever used. Both the brine and the marinade are easy to make, although it does takes time to soak the shrimp in both. I usually serve this with rice Pilaf and grilled veggies. I have also used the marinade with scallops and chicken with great success.

Amazing what the brining will do to lock in flavours. I personally think that for the best taste, the shells (and legs for that matter) must stay on while marinateing and grilling. Here in Japan however, you would be laughed at for doing other wise Yes, a bit fiddley to eat but well worth it. With or without the accompanying sauce, you can't go wrong.

A very tasty recipe overall. I reduced the amount of salt in the brine to 3 tablespoons of coarse kosher salt. In addition I roasted 4 cloves of garlic and mashed them up in the marinade intead of minced garlic, and added a splash of lemon. A new favorite in our house.

Rating: 4
I too was somewhat confused about whether or not to leave the shells on for grilling, as I couldn't imagine them remaining intact while butterflying and opening the shirmp. I opted to remove them, and the shrimp was fantastic. Not sure I readily detected the effect of the brining procedure--ah, must explain the near-lobster tail tenderness. Not too salty at all. This delicate flavor doesn't even require the sauce, which I found better with the halibut I had grilled the previous evening...

Rating: 4
Delicious! We brine chicken & turkey all the time and it never occured to me to brine the shrimp. Based on some of the comments, I kept the quantity of salt the same but used coarse Kosher salt (usually called for in brining). It did not taste overly salty at all. I also added some shredded basil and a couple of pressed garlic to the brine mixture. I left the shells on and thread 4 shrimp on a wooden skewer and grilled. I served these on top of linguine with the roasted garlic herb sauce. Tasted great and was a beautiful way to present. (by the way, I would cut down in the amount of parsley used in the roasted garlic sauce and add a raw garlic for a little zip - otherwise it was flat).

We made this for St. Patrick's Day and for Easter. It was fantastic. It added the green we needed, too! Everybody raved. I removed the shells before marinating and grilling. So much easier to serve and eat that way. I spread the beautiful sauce on the botton of a tray, placed the grilled shrimp on top of the sauce, then stuck a bamboo tooth pick into each shrimp. There was plenty of left over sauce. I tossed steamed sugar snap peas with it a few days later and even had a enough to top some grilled fish. It was so yummy! Regarding the saltiness. I agree that the shrimp were too salty. Not inedible, but saltier than I would have liked. Nothing that a cold glass of wine or beer couldn't cure. However, I think the recipe was written in error when listing the salt. In all other brining recipes I have tried, we always used coarse salt. Coarse salt has less salt per volume than table salt. So, you need to adjust the recipe by either (1) using coarse salt or (2)if using table salt cut the amount of salt in half. The first time we made this, we skipped the brining step altogether and the dish was still fantastic.

I just served this as an appetizer at a dinner party. It was very easy and tasted great. I did not make the anchovy sauce to go with it but I took teh full shell off the shrimp and marinated the shrimp for several hours in the garlic/olive oil marinade and then put the shrimp under the broiler for 3 minutes+ on each side and served on a tray with toothpicks. They tasted great and everyone seemed to like them.

This was great shrimp. I actually peeled and deveined the shrimp leaving only the tail on, and the flavor was fantastic. I also gave it a little cayenne in the brining stage to pep it up a bit.

Definitely worth a try!

Phenomenal! I've made lots of grilled shrimp, but never with brining in advance - what a difference! Recipe was equally successful on a stove-top grill. Salsa is delicious and very versatile - a nice, but not mandatory compliment to the shrimp. Watch the capers/anchovies if you're salt-conscious. Great simple main course or starter for a crowd. Shrimp can go on skewers to ease cooking. Brining method a definite even with other marinates - Try it!

Ahem. If one reads the very first line, one knows that the shrimp are to be grilled with the shell on. Which adds more flavor. It is very simple to slit the shrimp down the back to remove the vein & still leave the shell intact. Piks are readily available for such tasks for $1.00 on up. By "open shrimp", they mean "butterflied". Cut, but not all the way through. Great recipe.

I am at a loss..........do you cook the shrimp with or without the shell? I agree with another post before me.......my shrimp is jumbo and cost me $18.99 per lb...........I am not going to use a recipe that can't decide to shell or not to shell prior to grilling!! I am sticking with another recipe for now!! thank you!

Way too salty and oily, the underlying flavors were good, but were overwhelmed by the saltiness of the brine. If I made it again I would cut back on the salt. Also, I'd cut way back on the oil, the shrimp was swimming in it.

Before I invest a lot of time and expensive shrimp in this recipe, I have a question: after cutting the shrimp down the back and removing the vein, pulling off the legs, etc. tell me what you mean by "open shrimp" and grill "flesh side down...on both sides". the flesh is on both sides of a shrimp! And by "open shrimp" are you saying grill the shrimp in the shell? or not? I have shelled and deveind a lot of shrimp but this part is very confusing.
