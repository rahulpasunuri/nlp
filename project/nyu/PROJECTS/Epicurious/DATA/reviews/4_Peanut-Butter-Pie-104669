Really good recipe though I use pre-made pie shells instead of baking my own and top the pies with crushed walnuts and a drizzle of chocolate syrup. Delicious!

Cool Whip, really? How foul! Is it really that difficult to whip up some fresh cream and forgo all the crap they put into the fake stuff? Hello! On the one hand, this site features farm to table recipes on their front page, but then has overly processed ingredients like Cool Whip - where is your common sense?

This pie was fabulous! I was living abroad the first time that I made it and couldn't get my hands on any coolwhip so I used homemade sweetened whipped cream instead. I did freeze it for a few as others have mentioned to help it set and it came out deliciously perfect!

Tasty, but doesn't set up well in the refrigerator. Might work better frozen, but I'm anti-pie freezing. It's fine, but I've had better peanut butter pies that weren't any more trouble.

Made it for a Peanut Butter lover---but everyone ended up loving it..its special

We enjoyed this but I thought it was too sweet. Used sweetened condensed milk (not even sure there is an unsweetened condensed milk). Next time I will omit the sugar.

I'm embarassed to say that I'm embarassed that I make this. What a food snob! But...it's just great, and it's my partner's absolute favorite treat. Just hide the Cool Whip in your cart like I do, lol. After making it enough times, I've changed the ingredients. I use Nabisco Famous Wafers (chocolate cookies) for the crust (save some for garnish), 1 cup peanut butter, 3/4 cup powdered sugar, full can of condensed milk, and 2 cream cheese. Fold in 3/4 of a large tub of Cool Whip, use the rest for the topping. Garnish with the remaining wafer crumbs. Rich, delicious...eat a small piece or you'll regret it!

LOVE IT! This is one of my favorite Epicurious recipes. My brother-in-law requested a peanut butter dessert for his birthday party and this was a huge hit! I bought 2 vanilla wafer pie crusts and lined the bottom of each with a melted Hershey's chocolate bar. I had no problem having enough filling for two pies. I used a little extra cool whip (1/2 cup more) for the filling. Once the pies were filled, I added cool whip on top and sprinkled mini chocolate chips along the edge. Then, I threw them in the freezer. Once we got to the party, I placed them on the counter to thaw in time for dessert (about 2-3 hours). Be careful, they can get too mushy which makes it difficult to cut. It'll taste great anyhow, a light peanut butter flavor and quick to make...what more could you ask for?!

Instead of making homemade crust I used the Keebler shortbread premade crust and it turned out just fine. Everyone loved this pie. I used 1 container of cool whip (8 oz.) and that was plenty. I coarsely crushed some unsalted peanuts and sprinkled them on top which I think helped counter the rich sweetness of this pie.

AWESOME and so EASY! I used a purchased oreo cookie crust, as chocolate and peanut butter just go together. Took it to a family gathering....everyone asked for the recipe. I had frozen this, but put it in the fridge about 2 hours before serving. It was a little too soft to cut easily. Next time I'll leave it in the freezer, as it doesn't freeze solid. Filling is just enough for one pie, not two. Best PB pie I've ever had!

Yummy! I've made many complicated, time-consuming desserts, and am amazed that this simple and relatively cheap dessert tastes so good! I made a few modifications: a graham cracker crust with brown sugar and semisweet chocolate chips ground in; I used a reduced fat chunky peanut butter that was great; to compensate for the increased sweetness of the RF peanut butter, I left out all of the sugar. The pie turned out perfectly, as the sweetened condensed milk added enough sugar. This was a dense and rich pie but absolutely delicious. Enjoyed by children and adults.

We love this frozen - a small piece is all you need. Very rich and delicious!

My husband is eternally searching for his version of dessert peanut butter perfection. After finishing the entire pie in less than 10 hours he says this pie comes close. The texture is soft and light. The flavor is subtle and mellow. I followed the directions explicitly.

My husband has been begging me to make him a peanut butter pie. I made this one last night and stuck it in the freezer for a couple of hours. It turned out delicious! I used less powdered sugar, light cool whip, light cream cheese, and all natural peanut butter with no sugar added, and it turned out creamy with just enough sweetness. I will definately add this to my recipe file.

I made a graham cracker crust because that's what I had on hand. I filled one shallow 9 inch pie with filling to spare but not enough for a second pie; I would make 1 deep dish next time. The flavor of this is really good but kept just in the fridge I find it a little loose. I'm going to freeze what hasn't been eaten and see what its like tomorrow.

My dad's favorite dessert is peanut butter pie, so for his birthday I found this recipe. He loved it, and so did everyone else at his birthday party. I had several men tell me that it was the best peanut butter pie they had ever had. I would definetly recommend it. I used sweetened condensed milk too, and I don't think it made it too sweet.

I have made this pie three times and everyone seems to love it. The recipe states that there is enough filling for two pies - maybe two very small pies. I only had enough filling for 1 pie. I cut down on the powdered sugar since I used sweetened condensed milk (that was all I could find) and I used real whipping cream. I also added a little more peanut butter than the recipe called for. Yum Yum

I haven't made this recipe yet...should I use SWEETENED condensed milk? I can't find regular condensed milk.

This was very tasty. I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust. I also have no idea how the filling would be enough for 2 pies. I made 2 crusts, but ended up using all the filling in one pie. I didn't add whipped cream or cool whip to the top, but next time I will. It definately needed it to cut the richness. I garnised w/ grated chocolate and salted peanuts. Next time will add chocolate syrup on top too.

I would definitely make this recipe again. It was easy and fast and turned out delicious. I used chocolate wafers for the crust and slightly more butter. It was a hit in my family!

I made this pie for my 5th grade class. It was easy to make. The filling was really smooth and the crust was very crunchy! My class loved this pie! You should try it! Cody age 11

a friend in my class made this pie. On top of the pie was a beautiful spider web of rich Hershey syrup!There was a huge fluffy cloud of whip cream yum!!I just took the first bite.MMMM!..my favorite!Peanut butter . I just love how its so rich and creamy.I taste the vanilla waffers, peanut butter, and whip cream with chocolate on top! Please make it and try it! Maggie M.- 5th grade. The peanut butter pie looks like a big circle withtan crust and white cream with a black spider web on top. It smells like carmel and peanut butter vanilla wafers. The texture was soft and crunchy. It taste like vanilla wafers. I gave your peanut butter pie 3 forks. I thought it was to rich with vanilla wafers. I would guess if you like rich and creamy pies you make this peanut butter dish.

Grab a fork and dig in! This pie is drizzled with a rich-gooey sauce which sits on a lovely whipped-cream topping. But I haven't gotten to the best part!A crunchy munchy crust, on the bottom.And squished in the middle ,creamy peanut butter filling!When I tasted this pie my taste buds went to paradise!! L.Trowbridge- age 11 YUM!!! If you ever need a recipe for Peanut Butter Pie,you'd be crazy if you didn't try this scrumpious recipe! It has a really creamy,beige middle,and a golden crisp crust. A classmate made this pie, and it was to die for.It tastes sort of like a Butterfinger Cream Pie. I'm looking forward to making this pie,and I am SO GLAD that our fifth grade class got to try it.It is most DEFINATLY four fork recipe!!!!!!!

I LOVE peanut butter pie and this one is the best out there! My crust was really crumbly, so I might add a bit more butter next time. Also, I would do about another half of the filling - didn't quite come up all the way on my pies. I had to fill in the rest of the pie with more whip creme, which kinda took away a lot of the flavor. Other than that - no changes. Just fabulous.

The only thing easier than making this recipe is eating it!! What a quick, delicious recipe. I used a chocolate crust for a little bit of a twist. I think that next time I may swirl it with chocolate pudding. YUM!

I would give this recipe 3 1/2 stars- it was really delicious. My husband is a "peanut butter pie aficionado" and loved this pie. The filling is really creamy and peanut buttery. The crust (nilla wafers) I was not so sure about- I liked it, but thought there may be a better option. My guests loved this recipe.

I'd also never heard of peanut butter pie till recently and imagined a heavy, gooey, overly sweetened pie - kind of like a mud pie. This recipe is NOTHING like that. It's to die for yummy and I had to really control myself from not eating the whole thing in one go. I used a graham wafer crust as I had had the crumbs on hand and I used Dream Whip as it was on sale. The result was light, creamy, smooth with a hint of nuttiness. A very good pie.

A very easy recipe that always has rave reviews. I've made it several times now and it's always a hit.

I had never even heard of peanut butter pie until about 6 months ago. Talk about a quick and easy recipe. This is great if you want a quick dessert without a lot of fuss. The recipe is easily halved if you only want one pie. I also like it with an oreo crust.
