Tried a million slaw recipes, most of them calling for more ingredients. This is THE slaw recipe. I make this for both Taco Tuesday and anytime we're grilling and I have some cabbage.

Very good and easy. I used a mix of light mayo and plain nonfat yogurt. I always use plain yogurt instead of sour cream and often instead of mayo.

Wow--astonishingly good. The perfect side dish for a Mexican dinner, and incredibly quick and easy. I fiddled with the proportions just a bit and used Sriracha hot sauce instead of Tabasco.

Incredibly easy to make. Used pre- packaged cabbage from Corrado's Market, less mayo than called for and a little more fresh lime juice. Will be making a lot of this this summer :-)
