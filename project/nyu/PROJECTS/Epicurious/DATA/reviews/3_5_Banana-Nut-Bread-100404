I'm reviewing John's recipe again. I love it! Moist and perfect. I've cooked it in 2 ovens and it's always good. I omit 1/4 of sugar, and add tiny splash of vanilla and a generous shake of cinnamon... I'm gonna go devour more of the leftovers now. NOM NOM NOM! Oh, one more thing - I've made this w/half wheat and half white flour... You'd never know it to taste it! Try it! YUM!!!!!!

This is John's Recipe that SHOULD be made into a separate post on this site or maybe replace this one from Bon Appetit. But here it is again so we never loose it. THANKS JOHN! Let me give you a GOOD recipe for banana bread. I've been searching for years for the perfect recipe and I think I have found it at a bed and breakfast in Louisville,Ky. BEST EVER BANANA BREAD 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup butter 3 very ripe bananas 2 eggs 1 1/4 cups flour 1/2 tsp salt 1 tsp baking soda 1 cup crushed walnuts Preheat oven to 350 degrees,Cream sugar and butter. Add bananas and eggs beaten. Sift flour,salt and baking soda 3 times. Blend and add to banana mixture. Pour patter into a 9x5 loaf pan. Bake for 55 min. Cool on rack. If this is not the tastiest and moistest bread you've ever eaten, I will eat your peels. by john from Franklin Ma on 07/11/04

OK I think I know what needs to be mentioned regarding this recipe. Most important: be sure the bananas are ripe and make sure you have a FULL CUP of MASHED, VERY RIPE bananas. I used five bananas before I had to filled a liquid cup measure after mashing them. Bananas that are not ripe enough will not reduce in volume when mashed and will not therefore impart that dense, moist banana bread texture to the finished loaf. Also, I discovered that banana bread loves the freezer! I froze half the loaf and ate it a week later and it was even tastier and more moist.

with several changes, this recipe is super tasty. It's a good basic recipe. Try this version -- you will be thrilled. 1. Increase bananas to 2.5 2. Reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup 3. Replace milk with Westsoy Vanilla Soymilk (sugar-free) 4. Increase vanilla to 2 teaspoons 5. Increase cinnamon to 1.5 teas 6. Replace 1 stick butter for shortening 7. Put pecans over top in a streusel, with flour, cinnamon, sugar and melted butter.

Very good, reminds me of the banana nut bread that my my great grandma would make. I do add cinnamon and nutmeg, reduce the sugar a little bit and use buttermilk instead of whole. Wonderful recipe.

I made john's recipe... again. I did add a little cinnamon and vanilla this time. It's the moistest banana bread recipe I've ever found. The only drawback is the sugar. It's just slightly too sweet for me. Perhaps I had extra sugary bananas, as they were so ripe when I tried to pick them up, they literally fell apart in my hands. I had to bring the bowl to them! I think next time I might cut down slightly on the sugar next time so that I get more of the natural banana sweetness.

I love this recipe. It's everything I would want banana bread to be. Moist, delicious, and full flavored. The texture is wonderful and the ends and sides have a delightful chew to them. I will definitely be making this again and again.

At last...a banana bread recipe that works! I use organic butter instead of shortening (a little healthier). I also substitute the pecans with walnuts, my personal preference. It cames out moist, soft, and tasty all the time!

I made "John's Recipe" and added vanilla and cinnamon. Very nice flavor- the vanilla really strengthens the banana and the cinnamon lifts it nicely. Caution - let it bake the full 55 minutes! I took it out at 50 minutes because it looked beautiful but the center fell and was way too mushy. Five more minutes and it would have been perfect!!

This is also a review for "John's recipe," submitted by dsonntag. Absolutely scrumptious! Omitted the nuts - not really a fan - but this banana bread truly validates the k.i.s.s. principle: keep it simple, stupid. Please make this!

I made this recipe as banana nut muffins and they were very good. I altered the recipe by using a half cup of canola oil instead of the solid shortening. I also added several tablespoons of milled flax seeds for a healthy ingredient. The muffins were delicious, with a crispy top.

I made this recipe by substituting the shortening with butter and did it with three bananas. Was just a touch moister than what I wanted so next time I will just use two and a half. Other than that, it was quite good and none was wasted.

After a couple of pans of 'banana bricks' I came across several mentions of a recipe tucked away in the reviews of this recipe (John of MA). John's recipe is very simple to prepare and produces an excellent banana bread - moist and flavorful. Like several other reviewers before me, I added a couple of ingredients: 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tsp cinnamon, an additional banana (all extra-ripe), a pinch of baking powder, just over a cup of crushed pecans and another 1/8 cup of flour. *Yummmm*

I feel rather like a copycat, however I must join in the many that have applauded John's recipe. I used really black bananas,(so frail I picked them up with a spatula)doubled the recipe, and added dark choc chips to one of the loaves. I agree with the others that prefer to toss the chips with flour 1st to distribute evenly.FYI, thick slices are really flavorful when toasted in an iron skillet. Thanks John, for sharing!

I had high expectations for this banana bread that were not fulfilled. While it came out very light, it definitely was not sweet enough. It also felt as if it was missing something. Maybe chocolate? I followed the recipe to a tee-maybe someone else who made the recipe may have some suggestions?

In reading the reviews I just had to try Johns recipe! It's terrific. As easy as can be and the ingredients are nothing fancy, just what you would have in the pantry. I did use a combo of half splenda, half sugar as I usually do in simple baking and it worked very well. I used two small loaf pans and baked for only 40 minutes. I nice crunchy outer crust with a really buttery sweet middle. It is my new banana bread recipe.

I know where John's recipe is from . I have an old junior league cookbook and this banana bread is in there called Kona Inn Banana Bread and I have made it several times too, it stays fresh for ages. The only difference is the Kona recipe is double the quantities and makes two loaves - you can freeze one - works perfectly. Riper bananas work best, makes the bread sweeter.

I was looking for another banana bread recipe to try, and I was intrigued looking at the raves for John's banana bread. Especially since the recipe seemed so familiar. So I went to my family cookbook, and sure enough, John's banana bread recipe is the SAME as the one my mother's been making for the past 30+ years, and she got that recipe from HER mother. I wonder where the recipe is out of? And yes, John's/my Mother's recipe is good. So I'll stick with my family recipe instead of trying a new one.

Intrigued by the reviews referring to John from MA's recipe rather than the actual "Banana-Nut Bread" recipe, I tried John's recipe (so that is the subject of my review). And it's GOOD. We added a cup of mini-chocolate chips instead of nuts. It was overly, indulgently chocolately and perfect in its gooey sweet excess. It was my first banana bread, so I don't know how other recipes compare, but do yourself the favor and consider scrolling through the comments to find and make John's recipe.

Today i was searching for the really good banana bread recipe I used in the past. THIS IS IT! It is excellent. It is forgiving and at times I have used /added: an extra banana, used 1/2 and 1/2 OR soy milk instead of milk, used butter instead of stortening. It also was tasty with added cinnimon, nutmeg and/or chocolate. (flour the chocolate pieces first). Give it a try!

Rating: 3
I too made John's recipe, and it worked out just beautifully -- and, like someone else said, it is very forgiving! I screwed up and put the bananas in the sugar before I'd creamed it with butter, but when the loaves came out you'd never know it. I even left it in a bit long -- and that seemed to just caramelize the tops! Delicious, moist, very banana-y, and not hard to make.

Given the responses below, I decided to do a taste test. Made this and John's recipe exactly as printed. This one first: very good, excellent banana flavor, just sweet enough, nice texture. Everyone liked it. Then compared it to John's. John's was clear winner: excellent banana flavor, richer color, just all around better. It was unanimous (2 adults, 1 7-yr old boy). This recipe gets 3 forks, John's gets 4.

Rating: 4
I absolutely love this recipe exactly as it is written! It has a wonderful texture, is not too sticky or gummy, more like bread and not cake. The sugar is just enough to enhance the bananas but not overbearingly sweet. I love it, and everyone who has eaten it (family and friends) loved it. I have made it dozens of times and I think it is the best Banana-Nut Bread recipe I have made over my many years.

Rating: 4
I feel a bit odd since my review and fork rating is for John's recipe. His banana bread is wonderful, a very big hit in my household. It is also flexible, as I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla paste and substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar for an equal amount of white sugar called for in John's recipe. I also used pecans since that is what I had on hand. At any rate, my apologies to those who are seeking a review of the epicurious recipe. And my gratitude to John for sharing his version!

I used unsalted butter instead of shortening, and slightly less sugar (scant cup per cup of banana); otherwise followed the recipe, doubled to use up four big, black bananas. I don't think this bread needs spices. The texture is perfect, the splash of vanilla is great. This is an extremely reliable formula for excellent banana-nut bread. I used pecans, which were delicious, but I don't think it matters what type of nuts you use, as long as you toast them (that part's important).

Excellent banana bread! Followed others' suggestions and added cinnamon and nutmeg and also replaced more than half of the shortening with butter. Tripled the recipe as I had eight bananas that were just at that oh-so-perfect point as well as a friend who was desperate for some banana bread (it's not something we get easily in Belgium!). He and my kids gave a triple thumbs up to this recipe, so it's now our No. 1 banana bread.

I am consistantly disappointed with banana breads, both ones that I make and others. They are usually too dry or lack any flavor at all. This recipe has restored my faith in banana bread. The ratio of ingredients is perfect for a moist flavorful slice of bread which melts on your tongue. I think the key to ensuring a lot of flavor is using almost black bananas and thoroughly toasting your nuts (I used walnuts) and not skimping on them. I did grate some nutmeg and cinnamon sticks into the dry ingredients. Only about a half teaspoon of cinnamon and a quarter of nutmeg. I didn't want to make the bread too spicy and compromise the banana flavor, but I wanted a little something in there. Anyway, this recipe produces a bread of perfect consistency

Rating: 3
I used 3 very ripe (black) bananas which was probably more like 1 1/4 cup mashed bananas and the flavor was still not overpowering. However, the crumb of the bread was just perfect; the best I've had in a banana bread. Therefore my advice would be to use a little more banana and make sure they are VERY ripe. Of course organic bananas might have had a more intense flavor. I also added about a half cup more nuts since I like more texture. All in all a very reliable and worthwhile recipe.

Rating: 4
I've tried four different banana bread recipes in the last year and this one was the best by far. It was so moist and just delicious...not too sweet, and very flavorful. I put in one extra banana along with half a cup of fresh cranberries. I substituted 1/4c butter for 1/4 shortening.

I have made this recipe about 10-15 times and it is always reliable and delicious. Most friends say it is as moist as a banana cake. My bread bakes a little over an hour, maybe 70 minutes.

For extra rich, moist bread I doubled the bananas and halved the milk. I soured the milk with a little lemon jiuce until it was like watery yogurt. I also added the zest from the same lemon. Everything else the same. Super rich bread and very bananery if that's a word.

I have made this bread at least 25 times; and, each time it comes out perfectly. From the beginning I substituted 1/2 butter for the shortening and use about 1 1/4 cup to 1 1/2 cup (usually 3 or 4)VERY ripe bananas. The baking time is a little off for my oven. It usually takes 1 hour and 20 minutes.

Based on others' recommendations, I sub'ed half white for brown sugar. I also added a banana, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Sorry to say I was still disappointd with this recipe.

This was the first time I tried this recipe, and I made a few adjustments.

It came out beautifully, my familly loved it and I would deffinetly make it again.

I'm always on the lookout for a good banana bread recipe. This one isn't the best I've ever tried (the best is made in an insert that fits into your Crock Pot, believe it or not), but it is extremely good. I tried adding 1 t cinnamon and 1/2 t nutmeg like some reviewers suggested, but next time I won't do that. I thought those spices took away from the banana taste. I also used 3 bananas and used butter instead of shortening. Be sure to toast the nuts as the recipe says. An easy recipe that produces a moist loaf. Yum!

Having several overly ripe bananas inspired me to make this bread. I normally don't get excited about banana bread, but I am glad I made this. I tweeked the recipe somewhat. I used 3 bananas instead of two, I added 1T cinnamin, half cup white sugar half cup brown sugar instead of all white sugar, and about 1 3/4 cup pecans (I am a huge pecan freak). What a fantastic first slice! Crispy crust. Not too sweet. Very moist. I am planning on having a big fat slice of this tomorrow morning for breakfast. Even my HUSBAND had a slice and he is very finicky. So by all means, go make this!

Very moist and rich. Definitely use 3 bananas instead of 2. I was making it with what I had in the house, so I didn't add the nuts, but I stirred in a teaspoon of cinnamon and half teaspoon of nutmeg. Also, I used half all-purpose flour and half cake flour since I was almost out of all-purpose. The texture came out very, very feathery and light - I like denser quick breads so I think I would make sure to use all-purpose exclusively next time.

This recipe is up to par with the excellence of Bon Appetit that I have come to trust. I would highly recommend it as your favorite or an addition to your collection, definitely worth trying. I also added extra banana, increasing to 1 1/2 cups, as well as other readers did, reducing the milk to a 1/3 cup. I replaced the shortening for butter and I used half white and half brown sugar, packed, in place of all white sugar. I added a tsp. of cinnamon for a little added flavor boost for the bananas that married nicely along with the vanilla. My loaf pans were not available, an 8" square Pyrex substituted nicely and produced great snack size slices. This seems to be a recipe you can play with a bit with what you have available and what strikes your fancy, using your judgement as a cook. It came out with great flavor, light, moist and fluffy. It has some of the density expected of a tea bread without being a brick. I'm trying to allow it to mellow for a day to bring out the flavors even more, but I don't think I will find out the results of that, it's disappearing too quickly, lol. One tip to ease preparation work, freeze your very ripe bananas, when defrosted, they are so easy to mash, hardly an effort at all. One chore done away with!

I've made this recipe twice now and it's come out fabulous both times. The first time I made it I doubled the recipe and used a bundt pan, turned it upside down and dusted it with powdered sugar.

This recipe was great. I substituted apple sauce with cinammon for the Crisco and accidentally left out the nuts, but it was fabulous. I only cooked it for about 45 minutes, in two 8 inch bread pans. I also used skim milk instead of whole. Next time I might even leave out some of the sugar since the apple sauce is sweet. I would definitely make this again!

This really is a very good recipe. The cake is light in color, flavorful and moist. I was tempted to use butter, but kept to the shortening (Crisco) in the recipe. Glad I did. I added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg and used a larger loaf pan. The 9" pan just wasn't big enough for the amount of batter. I'm sure that two smaller pans would also work.

I made this recipe today and my husband and I both loved it. I didn't have any nuts so I didn't use them. It was incredibly moist. I didn't make any changes to the recipe. This will definitely be my basic recipe for banana bread, as it is easily modified with nuts or raisins. Try it!

I made this banana bread because I had bananas that were ripe that I needed to use. I froze it and took it out to serve for breakfast one morning with a fresh fruit salad. I heated it again in the oven at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes to make the top crusty again. I had sprinkled the top with a cinnamon/sugar mixture and a few pecans. The bread was very good. I did not toast the nuts before putting them in the batter, and I think next time I will; the nuts were too soft within the bread -- the ones on top were fine. Thanks for the recipe, I will be making this many times again

I live in Italy and my Italian roommates just couldn't fathom the "American" concept of banana bread, cranberry bread, apple bread, etc... Made this for them last week and everyone loved it. They were arguing about saving enough for breakfast the next morning too. One even said it tasted "exotic." Had to substitute walnuts for pecans and a few other ingredients they don't have here, but it turned out great.

I made this for my Christmas care-packages this year and EVERYONE loved them. I turned to this recipe when I lost my family recipe (it was my granny's !). I would suggest a combination of both, just add some cloves, nutmeg and more banana. It will be the perfect combination of a cake-like bread, and the southern dense dark banana bread.

This was the worst banana bread I've ever tasted. It had far too few bananas and WAY too much shortening - it tasted and smelled of shortening with a wiff of banana. While not very dry, it was not nearly as moist as I would has liked. If you want a recipe that tastes of something other than crisco, look somewhere else.

I DOUBLED the recipe and substitued a 1/2 cup of unsalted butter and a 1/2 cup of applesauce for the shortening. I also substitued 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour of the total required all-purpose flour. I also added semi-sweet chips and walnuts, instead of the pecans. Cooking time remained the same. Very good!

Very moist with just the right amount of density. Next time I will triple the recipe!

I made several deadly mistakes here. I think I didn't cream the butter enough, and I used only-almost-ripe bananas, which gave a totally disastrous effect. I'm thinking of trying it again, but I am wondering what difference does it make by using baking powder here. I realize that most banana bread recipes uses only baking soda.

I've always used Emeril's banana bread recipe but I thought I would try this one b/c of the great reviews. But it turned out to be too moist for my liking.

I read the reviews of all the recipes that I plan to use from this website. The recipes seem to be springbroads for what is actually in the cubbard. I was determined to follow is recipe to the letter. Didn't happen!!!! I didn't have vanilla so used 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Sugar bowl was almost empty ... only 3/4 of a cup there. Couldn't find my loaf pan so used an 8 x 8 square cake pan and only bake for 55 minutes. I was sure that was the only changes I made until I took my banana "cake" out of the oven and sat it next to the cup of pecans that I had chopped and toasted. I turned out to be the best. I'll make it again ... exactly as the recipe states ... maybe!!

This was pleasingly quick and easy to make. I didn't have any pecans on hand, so I left them out, but it would have added some nice texture to the bread.

The bread ended up coming out a little heavy as a result.

An excellent, light, moist, tasty cake-like banana bread. Increased vanilla, sugar, added spices, 1:1 milk to cream, bananas were over-ripe. Doubled the batch. Subbed sunflower seeds for 1/2 the nuts. My pans are 9x5 and found this to be just right amount. Lovely outer crumb, soft moist insides. A keeper!

I liked this recipe a lot. My husband liked it too and he doesn't care for most banana breads. It came out lighter than I expected. I didn't bother with measuring a cup of banana, I just used two Medium bananas, and I used 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4 half -n- half, and ommitted the nuts. (Some co-workers can eat nuts)

Oh baby was this good! What's especially nice is how flexible this recipe is. I used 3 large bananas, which ended up being more than the recipe called for. I also used a mixture of 1/4 C applesauce and 1/4 C shortening, and 1/2 C sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar. I didn't have enough pecans, so I used mostly walnuts. My loaf pan went missing, so I used a bundt pan and baked it for 45 minutes. It looked kind of naked, so I made a little chocolate glaze and drizzled it over the top. Everyone loved it. A definite keeper!

This came out great! I made the bread into muffins (about 14 and baked them for about 30 minutes). Also, I used nonfat milk (all I had), added about 1/2 t. of cinnamon, and stuck true to the recipe in terms of the vegetable shortening. They were very very good!

Rating: 4
I loved this recipe and my husband was over the moon about it! It is much different than many recipies of its type, which call for whole wheat flour. I substituted unsalted butter for the shortening. I never cook with or eat hydrogenated oils due to the serious damage they can do to your health and shortening is definitely hydrogenated. As is my custom, I used a store bought loaf pan and found that the recipe was much too large for the pan. As a matter of fact, it ended up running over the sides of the pan. Next time, I will split the batter between two pans.

I've made this recipe twice and each time it was incredibly good. I used both 1% and 2% milk, I don't think it makes a difference which kind of milk you use. I also thought using shortening was a bit odd, so the first time I made it, I used butter, the second time I used margarine. The crumb and texture with the butter was better but the flavor was great both ways. Both times I made the recipe I doubled the amount of vanilla. I also used 1 Tsp. Chinese 5-Spice powder and 1/2 Tsp. Cinnamon, worked well and was not overpowering at all. This recipe is really worth trying at least once.

I've got to say this is great banana bread! I'm the only one in the family who likes nuts so I left them out.

Moist and tasty! And as an earlier reviewer remarked, there was none of that unpleasant baking powder aftertaste common to cakes and breads.

Make sure your bananas are repulsively ripe and verging on gooey!

This is a winner! Easy to make and wonderful flavor and texture. I live in Egypt where the bananas are plentyful, they grow very small but are sweet and usually over-ripened when you buy them. On my next batch I will cut back the sugar to compensate. I tried this with my Egyptian friends and they now want me to teach this one to them. The devoured this one in no time flat! I plan to bake this one often especially for afternoon tea time which is a custom here.

Wow! As an avid baker, I have tried dozens of banana breads and this is far-and-away the best. A nice dark exterior with a moist texture and a nice crumb. This bread is LIGHT, not dense- textured as many banana breads can be. I used the shortening and I think it worked great.

I SUBSTITUTED BUTTER FOR SHORTENING, 1% MILK FOR WHOLE MILK, AND HAZELNUTS FOR THE PECANS. THE BREAD CAME OUT GREAT. THE OVERALL INTEGRITY OF THE BREAD WAS QUITE MORE THAN I EXPECTED.

WHEN HE CAME HOME HE SAID : "HEY DAD, GREAT CAKE!"

A really great recipe - easy to make, moist with good texture, not heavy like some breads. This is the best banana bread I have made or even tasted. I prefer to leave out the nuts so that I can enjoy this lovely bread without interrupting the flavour. I found 60 minutes was a sufficient baking time. I will never again be sad when I see a carefully selected, unblemished yellow banana turning spotty. In fact, I buy more so that I'll have enough left over to double the recipe. Freezes well.

A very tasty, moist bread. I had to beat the ingredients with a wisk, as I don't have an electric beater right now. -Still turned out good. I only cooked the bread for an hour, though, and it was done. My taste buds aren't dancing, but they're very satisfied.

This was easier to make than I imagined- I do not have a lot of baking experience, either. It would be the perfect item to share outside the family, since it slices easily and with no crumbling. I used 2% milk since it was all I had, and it turned out just fine.

My family devoured the first loaf so fast, I thought I could never make a single loaf again. I made a double the second time and almost reached the max amount of batter for my mixer. This bread is MOIST. I took one reviewers suggestion of tasting the bananas first to see how sweet they were. We don't like sweet cakes, so I cut the sugar to 3/4c with sweet bananas. And I don't use vegeatble shortening, so I used butter. My only problem was keeping the bananas in the house long enough to ripen -- I had to buy 15 to have 5 ripen for the double recipe. This will be my new "house warming" gift when one is required.

This is THE BEST banana bread recipe I have made, and I have tried many. I used vegetable oil instead of shortening and added a pinch of cinnamon. It's great with buttermilk, too. The ingredients are very flexible and substitutable. I find it takes about an hour to bake, not 70 minutes.

Very good and easy. I think the milk must add some of the moistness which really helps. I stirred in the mashed bananas rather than beating them in and this worked well. I did have to cook my bread for 70 minutes (at 60 minutes the center was still batter). I guess the recommendation would be to check it at 60 minutes and determine whether or not it needs additional time.

I can't really see clogging my arteries for banana bread and so gave this a healthy "makeover"-- substituted canola oil for shortening, 1/2 cup egg substitute for two eggs, and wheat germ for pecans. I also substituted a teaspoon of cinnamon for the vanilla. The result took exactly one hour to bake to perfection (NOT 70 minutes!), and was a flavorful, moist cake-like quick bread, just right for breakfast or snacking. It took exactly two bananas to make a cup of mashed fruit. Also, beware that some of the comments below refer to another banana-nut bread recipe on this site (references to sour cream, butter, etc.)

Loved this recipe. I added 1 1/2 cups bananas and used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening. I also used white and brown sugar. This is the best banana nut recipe I've ever tried. Not dry at all. I can't get over the taste. Simply delicious. This is definately a keeper!!

I *loved* this banana nut bread, as did my boyfriend who has never tasted banana bread.

My first attempt at banana bread, I followed the recipe as closely as was possible. Preparation wasn't too complicated, and the end result was pretty good. I think I'll be trying other banana bread recipes, though... I found this one to be rather oily. I wasn't thrilled to use shortening.. but that's the health nut in me. Overall, the bread looked good and tasted like normal banana bread... I'm just going to keep searching for something a bit more healthy and stand-outish. Cheers!

AWESOME!!! I don't even LIKE banana bread, and I couldn't stop from going back for more! I used butter for the shortening; between that and the toasted pecans, this was deliciously rich without being heavy. I used a glass pan, so I ended up having to bake it longer (about 20 min. more) after I reduced the heat to 325. I am most definitely making this one again, and SOON!!! By the way, use really, really ripe (ugly) bananas - they are the sweetest.

This bread is great! Reminds me of my gmas bread. I used whole-wheat flour and increased bananas to 1 1/2 cups. I baked at 325 in a dark loaf pan - very moist. My 2 year old can't get enough - i make 2 batches and freeze one loaf.

This recipe was great! I substituted 2% milk instead of whole milk which made it a little less sweet. Goes great with afternoon coffee or tea.

This is a tastey treat!!! Everyone loved it. I used walnuts and totally mashed the bananas and it turned out great. Considering that it was the first I ever made, it was quite easy...

Quite Tasty! I used toasted sliced almonds instead because I didn't have pecans.

Everyone was right about this bread! The consistency is wonderful and the toasted pecans add just the right flavor and crunch. I followed one reader's advice and left the bananas not fully mashed, and was rewarded with the promised taste suprise.

Great recipe! For the past year I've been searching for a "keeper". This is it. I served it to weekend guests and got RAVES! This recipe is not too dry nor is it too moist...it's just right. Quite delicious.

Very easy and uses ingredients usually on hand. I cut the shortening in half and used butter. I also added about a Tablespoon of banana rum - a nice addition. It was a hit at my office!

This was definitely the best banana nut bread I've ever made, but I used about a half extra banana than the recipe called for to give it more flavor. And try not mashing the bananas too much for a tasty surprise.

This is a wonderful recipe and I definitely plan to make this bread again. I simplified the recipe by combining all the ingredients except flour and nuts in my blender, mixing them and then adding them to the flour together with the nuts. It turned out great.

I have made banana bread many times, but this recipe was so easy and so delicious. I found it to be super moist and easy to cut. My family loved it and I will make it again. I also divided a batch and a made 3 little loaves without any problems. You have got a WINNER.
