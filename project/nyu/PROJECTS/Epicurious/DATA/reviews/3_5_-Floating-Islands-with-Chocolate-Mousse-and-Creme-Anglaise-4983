Ughhhhhhhh! It was just OK. I hate when I get my hopes up. What I would have liked is more contrast in texture and MORE mousse. At least double the recipe!!! I cooked the meringues the rec. time and they came out slightly brown on top - but it was moist, not crunchy when cooled and provided too little contrast to the mousse. I used Vahlrona 56% chocolate, and would have liked a deeper chocolate taste and lighter texture personally! Also, the creme angaliase was DEVINE! but did not add much in my opinion to the overall recipe. I thought the components were better separate than together - sad really - but the "clouds" seemed to dilute the rich chocolate flavor. I added some mexican warmed chocolate sauce the second time I made it, but still was not totally elated. Just OK for me - a lot better chocolate recipes for an afternoons worth of effort and kitchens full of dishes.

Fabulous flavors and textures! The meringues were quite small (they shrank as they cooled) and there was about 1/3 too much mousse. I will make this dessert again and increase the size of the meringues. Excellent creme anglaise (you can avoid curdling problems by using an instant-read thermometer - cook the custard to 170 degrees and pull it off immediately).

Lovely recipe...added organic strawberry slices for garnish. I overcooked the creme anglaise - resulting in curdled egg custard - but saved it by using my immersion blender to whip it back to a smooth consistency.

I made this dessert for my family on Valentine's Day and they loved it. To get a bigger meringue cup I used 6oz stoneware ramekins instead of muffin tin and tripled meringe recipe to fill six ramekins. Placed ramekins in 13x9 glass container, filled with hot water to come half way up sides of ramekins,and baked for same time and oven temp. I doubled creme anglaise, but not chocolate mousse. Centers of meringues are easier to scoop out if merigunes have chilled. Althouh it may seem so, this is not a heavy or overly rich dessert. A perfect ending to a special meal.

A wonderful impressive dessert that can be made ahead (the night before) and assembled just prior to serving. My guests loved it and I have made it several times.

This is relly easy and immpressive. I made a few changes that I think really added to the recipe. I folded toasted slivered almonds into the meringue mix and I made a warm chocolate sauce instead of a creme anglaise and put a dollop of creme fraiche beside the islands just to cut on the sweetness of the meringue. My dinner guests were swooning!
