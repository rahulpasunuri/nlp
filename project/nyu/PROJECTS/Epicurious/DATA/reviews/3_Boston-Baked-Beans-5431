This recipe is just okay. I've tried several from various sources. My favorite is on the website Just Hungry (a great site in general.)

Beans were almost done in 4 hrs so I turned off the oven, left the beans in and in the morning they were ready. Adjusted to mustard and vinegar to 1/8 C and added 1/2C brown sugar (based on other reviews). I thought the brown sugar made it too sweet so adjusted it by adding 1/2C non-alcoholic beer. Delicious!!

this was very vinegary. omit the vinegar and use less dry mustard.

Make it easy on yourselves. Put everything in a pot after sorting and washing Great Northern beans (save the Pintos for chili. Add an extra 24 to 32 oz. of water. Put it all in the oven covered at 275 degrees F. before you go to bed. In the morning the "cooking gremlins" will have magically transformed all your ingredients into a tasty repast. Uncover and continue cooking 325 degrees F. until desired thickness is reached.

These beans were tasty. Compliments all around. I cooked them on the stovetop due to the lack of bean pot for the oven. They still turned out great. Next time, I will add more of the saucy ingredients to amp up the flavor, and maybe some chili powder or cayenne or chipotles. I had to add more water halfway through, but the beans were still done in 4 hours. Also, I used dijon mustard, because I couldn't find dry mustard, I don't think it is super crucial to use the dry mustard, but I will look for it next time.

Great balance of flavors. I followed it for the most part. Cooking dried beans is always a crapshoot. So often they turn out hard. When I see "cook for 4 hours" my reaction is: That just makes them mad. I'm not sure if it's true, but I have read that acids (vinegar, tomato) actually halt the cooking process. Here's what I do--after soaking the buggers overnight, clean, drain, get rid of the yuck. Into a crock pot with water to cover and the bay leaves, and cook until just about done. I've had this take 4 hours, I've had this take 8. Dried bags of supermarket beans may be fresh, most likely are old. I don't care what time is on the recipe. Cook them until they are cooked. Then add all of the goodness. The goodness. There's too much for only one pound of beans. I use just shy of two pounds. Saute bacon until crisp, add onions until cooked, add garlic until cooked. Toss the whole mess, less most of the grease, with all of the other ingredients in a mixing bowl, and add to the just about cooked beans. Cool it down. Next day, or whatever day, two hours in crock pot and, it's a beautiful thing. I like Great Northerns for this one.

I was a little paranoid after reading all the many reviews and seeing such a range of opinions. But I decided to make this anyway for a family BBQ this last Sunday. I also have a this er, what I'll call, a bean curse. All previous attempts to make bean dishes have failed. I even bought an expensive LeCruset bean pot many years ago thinking it was my pot. Anyway, I didn't end up using the bean pot, just my standard big, heavy iron pot. I didn't change the ingredients at all - not even the dry mustard. The result was a pretty good pot of baked beens - not outstanding, but good. I baked them for about 4.5 hours and the beans could have been softer, but I'm used to the baked beans you get from the deli - the beans are very, very soft. So these were probably just right. Anyway, If I make them again I will pour in one more cup of water and cook for 30 more minutes, just to get some more juices going. P.S. no one raved about this dish. My guests did eat it but no one raved. Is that because baked beans are not a rave inducing dish? I think that must be it ;)

Hello from An American Kitchen in Rio. As a native of California I have never had cravings for BBB, however, my Brazilian husband has fond memories from his trips north and of course he expected that his American wife could make them. I bless Epicurious.com every day. Possessing no bean pot and fearful of lead in the local cooking vessels, I made these on the stove top. I followed the advice of cooking the beans till they were slightly soft and then I added the ketchup and 1/4 cup of molasses. (I was so happy to find the ketchup at the market.) I cooked them at low heat at least 4 hours. OH! I also used 2 tablespoons of seeded Dijon type mustard because I could not find the dry mustand. Recipe was excellent and his pleasure during the meal was absolutely charming.

I've made this recipe for a couple of years now the way it was written with no complaints, only compliments Unless I don't cook the beans long enough. (about 5 hours)

This was my first attempt at Boston Baked Beans in a beanpot. A bit too much ketchup in it for my liking. I expected a bit more molasses and maple syrup to come through but to no avail. And 1/4 CUP of dry mustard?!! Most other recipes call for 1/2 or 1 teaspoon. Is this a typo? Only used 4 cups of water because that's all my beanpot would hold but the beans didn't dry out anyway. Rarely had to add water. Seems like 6 hours (plus some)of cooking would be recommended though to fully cook the beans.

I made this dish for a barbecue and it went down exceptionally well. No of the people at the barbecue had ever had Boston Baked beans before.

I used 1 pound beans (pinto) and halved the rest of the ingredients, with even a little less mustard (thanks for the advice!) - it came out well, and didn't take 12 hours to cook. It does have a certain "tang" to it, though. Next time I may use less cider, or use tomato sauce or paste instead of ketchup. It certainly satisfied my craving for real Boston Baked Beans, though.

I did these in a slow cooker overnight, then boiled the liquid down separately and poured over the beans just before serving. They were great. The beans turned out tender but not mushy, and the flavor was excellent.

The results are great and the cooking part is easy too. This also accommodates for recipe fiddling. Recommended changes to the basic recipe: reduce the mustard quantity in half, 8 cups of water is too much, 5 - 6 is enough to start; soak the beans for 24 hours, if possible. Successful additions include adding 1/2 cup of brown sugar and a ham bone, in addition to the bacon. These results were quite good too.

I used 3 cups white navy beans with 6 cups of water and cut the mustard to 1/3cup. The beans cooked in the time specified but because I cut the amount of water, I had to add some liquid. Instead of water I added some Coors Lite Beer. This recipe was easy to make and the results mmmmmmgood. Will definitely make it again.

I believe you can take some liberties with this recipe. For my taste there was waaayyy too much dried mustard. I'll reduce that baby down a bit next time. Also it needs a bit of a tart zing so I'll also add a little more vinegar and perhaps some yellow prepared mustard. It's a darned good basic bean recipe.

Rating: 3
Great, authentic recipe, unlike brown sugar varieties so common. I do prefer navy or great northern beans to the more earthy flavor of the pintos .

Rating: 2
I tried it with the BBQ sauce suggestion. I thought it was not as god - teh BBQ sauce has too many confusing flavors for this simple recipe. Use Ketchup or just tomato paste. Be careful with the fluid too - try just 6 cups instead of 8 and add if you need it. Substitute some stock for water too - half and half Cut down on the dry mustard - again 1/4 cup is too much for this simple fare.

The only deviation I made in the recipe was to drain off the excess bacon fat before adding the main ingredients. My wife and I both found this dish to be delicious. I cooked the beans for an additional 1/2 hour, because the sauce seemed too thin after 4 hours. As another reviewer stated, you really can't overcook this dish. The flavoring wasn't overpowering. It was a nice accompanyment to baby back ribs.

After omitting the bacon and splitting the cup of ketchup half-and-half with BBQ sauce, these beans still needed something. After cooking this recipe in a crockpot for six hours, it just wasn't right. I added 1/2 cup packed brown sugar and allowed to simmer the rest of the evening. After this last adjustment the beans were great!

Rating: 3
I made the recipe as written. My husband is "food fussy" and he thinks it is very good. I have been cooking for MANY years and give this recipe a thumbs up! I cannot stand "wimpy tasting" food. This has great flavor and texture. I plan to share it with my family and friends.

My search for a good Boston Baked Bean recipe is over. It's a classic BBB flavor and simple to prepare. I used yellow eye beans and they were terrific. I have to agree with some other reviewers that the proportions HAVE to be for 2 lbs of beans.

This is best by substituting BBQ sauce for the ketchup.

I used small navy beans and cut down on the mustard. The flavor was good, but the beans were not as soft as they should have been. We have hard water where we are, so next time I'll cook them a little longer

Utilizing suggestions of reviewers, I soaked 2 lbs. of beans for 24 hours. I also used canadian bacon. Beans cooked in approximately 4 hours. Everybody loved them.

I substituted navy beans for the pinto beans the second time I made this, and I though it was better with the navy beans. I also cut the dry mustard in half. Everyone loved it! Make sure the pot you use isn't too full, because this bubbles and splatters sticky sauce all over your oven if the pot is too full!

This is simply classic New England baked beans. I follow this recipe exactly and haven't had any problems. You really can't overcook this recipe. Sometimes, I pour off some of the bacon fat.

I've made this twice now and its really good. I cut back on the mustard based on other comments and used the method of preparing the beans more quickly as described in the Maple baked bean recipe on this site. Otherwise I followed the recipe.

These were very yummy, but I only gave it a three because the mustard was a little overpowering. (A lot overpowering to my daughter!) I used navy beans instead of kidney. Next time I will reduce the mustard and they should be great!

I've made these beans twice and both times they came out perfectly. The first time, I used turkey bacon and the second time I used Canadian bacon. Both were great substitutions. What a delicious recipe! They smell incredible when cooking too!

OMG!! Awesome with some changes (thx for the warnings). First, I used red kidney beans & used 3 1/2 cups of dried beans. Second, I followed the tip on boiling gently for 40 minutes just the beans, water & onions. It baked perfectly in just under 4 hours. The dry mustard, at 1/4 cup was perfect - this is by far the BEST I've ever eaten.

I would make these beans again, but would make two changes to the recipe. First, I would use less bacon and crumble what I did use very finely. I just thought that there was too much bacon in the finished dish and the bean/bacon texture difference was disconcerting. Second, I would use a bit less mustard. The mustard was the one taste that stood out from the other ingredients that had otherwise very nicely melded together. And yes, the beans take much longer to cook than the recipe indicates. Thanks to the other cooks out there for alerting me to this fact.

We got good reviews when we served this recipe at a cookout. I'm really glad I read the reviews, though, because the beans do take five (or even more) hours to cook. Also, I thought 1/4 CUP DRY mustard excessive! I used 1/4 cup prepared instead.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. It is way too tomato-y. I would not make this again.

The beans turned out tasty, but there was way too much liquid in them at the end of cooking. I agree with others that adding more beans to the recipe may help.

I didn't want to soak the beans overnight, so I used the Joy of Cooking recommendation of quick soaking. You cover the beans by 2 inches with boiling water and let stand for 1-2 hours, until they have doubled in size. I soaked them for 2 hrs and then boiled them on the stove for about 40 minutes with 8 c water and the chopped onions. Once I put them in the oven, it took about 4 1/2 hours. Made them a day before and they warmed up nicely. Definitely a keeper!

They take a lot of time to cook but, boy are they worth it! I soaked the beans for 24 hours; maybe that's why mine were tender after baking for 4 hours.

I doubled the beans as was suggested and they were delicious! I waited before I added the ketchup, salt, and vinegar so the beans would cook a little longer. Definitely a keeper recipe!

I soaked the beans for 13 hours. They had to cook for 5 hours in the oven. I baked them the day before. The day I served them, I let them simmer on the stove on low for a few hours. I added water to it, so it wouldn't be so thick. They turned out real good. Everyone loved them. They just take a long time to prep and cook, but the results were good. I would definetly make them again. The aroma was while baking was wonderful!!

I have made this recipe about 5 times and it has turned out fabulous each time. Reading all the poor reviews would really scare me if I hadn't already made this in the past. I beleive what the problem is is that the recipe must be for 2 lbs. of beans and not 1 lb. I have always made these with soldier or similar bean and used the am't of ingredients listed. The ingredients seem excessive for 1 lb. So I do not double them to make 2 lbs. The aroma as they are cooking is unbelievable and the finished product suberb.

Solution to hard beans: Beans should always be cooked until they begin to soften before other ingredients, especially molasses, salt or vinegar, are added or they will never soften. I have been debating making this recipe due to another reason. The 1/4 cup dry mustard sounds like too much to me. Is it correct?

I've been making baked beans for 46 yrs. and decided to try a new recipe. The worst beans I ever made! After 6 hrs the beans were still hard and had very little taste. Never again!

Although the recipe tasted very good it took forever to cook. I soaked the beans overnight and it still took 5 1/2 hours in the oven at 375 and 1 hour in the microwave to almost cook the dish. Next time I think I will boil the beans a little longer before adding the rest of the ingredients.

Rating: 4
This was a great dish! The best baked bean recipe I have ever had. You can't beat if for a BBQ. I agree with the others that 4 hrs is too short. I cooked mine for 5 hrs. They can be made early in the day and hot or even a little above room temp.

great recipe.....I cooked the beans in the crockpot the day before, then cooked them in the oven on low heat all the nest day. I also added a little bbq sauce for a little extra flavor......everybody loved them

The beans took longer to cook than the recipe suggested. The sauce was too thin at four hours, although the beans were tender. I transferred the beans to a crock pot with a slotted spoon, and reduced the sauce over the stove until thick and bubbly. I then added it back to the beans and let it simmer for an hour or two more. The beans were excellent after that. Very good served cold the next day.

okay for baked beans but unacceptable for a beancrock.

This was good but it didn't cook properly. I think the oven is too hot and would probably reduce the oven temperature to 300 so that it would simmer instead of boil, and I wouldn't have to keep adding water.

Great dish for summer picinics or to keep in the fridge at home. They keep for a few days with no change in texture or taste. Four hours may not be enough cooking time to make beans appropriately tender, but they are worth the wait. I shared the recipe with my mother, mother-in-law, sister and sister-in-law and they have been a hit at all of the respective events.
