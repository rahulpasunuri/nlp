I love this hummus with or without the parsley oil, pine nuts, and seeds on top. My variation (without the parsley oil): Added toasted and finely ground cumin seeds to the whole batch. Saved half as-is. Added chile powder, ancho chile powder, paprika, and chipotle chile powder to the rest - YUM!!!

This is one of my favorite appetizers to take to a party. My friends always request it. I have also made it with cilantro instead of parsley oil and actually prefer it over the parsley. The cilantro complements the cumin seeds and makes it even better. I definitely recommend this recipe.

I've made this a couple of times and it was soooooooo good -- the best hummus ever. In fact I now find it hard to tolerate store-bought hummus because in comparison it's so bland, so dry, so much less creamy. This recipe will get you a very tasty, creamy, delicious hummus. You'll have a hard time stopping yourself from eating ungodly amounts of it! One of my favorite parts of this recipe is the parsley oil and roast pine nuts on top. It really makes it.

Our all time favorite hummus recipe. Sometimes we leave out the pine nuts and parsley if we are feeling lazy...it's still delicious!

Good, but needs tweaking. I found my version to be lacking something - I don't know what, but I'll try it again. The garlic was overpowering; I think I like the idea of microwaving it first.

This has become my standby hummus recipe: it tastes great, and the green herb-infused oil and toasted pine nuts make a beautiful, interesting presentation. I've made it as-is numerous times, I've never thought it needed any adjustments.

yum! this is a great, intuitive recipe with a ton of room for experimentation. I didn't have any tahini, but i did have sesame seeds. I toasted them with the cumin seeds and then threw them in the cuisinart with some olive oil, garlic and the lemon juice- i added the paste to the chickpeas and tossed in some other spices (paprika, a touch of cayenne, black peper) a good pinch of salt and some fresh cilantro and parsely. also kept adding more olive oil and the reserve liquid from the beans until it was a good consistency-- that bean juice really rounds out the flavor and keeps it creamy. yum yum yum.

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe! For us, the garlic strength is perfect. Although I love the addition of cumin seeds and pine nuts, I usually don't bother with them on a daily basis. I just add ground cumin directly to the hummus. Our favorite hummus recipe by far.

Good but needs some adjustment. Agree with all of the reviewers that find the 4 cloves of raw garlic a little overwhelming (and I am a garlic lover). Next time I will heat them for a bit in the oil (microwave works great for this) to take the edge off. This is much faster and easier than making roasted garlic. I find tahini to be bitter and often cardboard flavored, so will plan to reduce or eliminate entirely) I tried hard to find good quality fresh stuff, so think it is just the nature of the product..(discovered 365 from Whole Foods that is great) The addition of the parsley was a great flavor and appearance addition. I also added a little adobo from chipotle chilies to spice it up as I was tasting for salt and lemon - it helped. With all this said it was a hit at the negiborhood pot luck (at least for the garlic brave) Almost identical to recipe from October of 1988!! combination of 1/3 cup tahini & 1/2 cup raw sesame seeds along with heating the garlic slight in the olive oil is great. Also added one clove of garlic to the oil for the parsley oil garnish and it was a nice touch.

This was great. I am an avid hummus-maker and the addition of pine nuts and cumin really topped it off. I toasted the pine nuts first, and added the cumin seeds at the last minute. I find they burn quickly and have a really unpleasant flavor. Also-it can be made by hand with just a potato masher. Cooking the beans from dry is helpful because you can cook them to a very soft consistency, but canned would work too.

Simply the BEST hummus. My guests were wowed. I will certainly make this again and again.

I made this for my birthday get-together earlier this year exactly as stated (maybe used more garlic though). Even though I've been cooking professionally for years, my family still asked where I bought it from! They all raved! Even a snooty cousin who doesn't cook, she loved it! She said it was restaurant/catering quality! (And this was after having to ask *what* it was) Can't wait to make it again for the next shindig.

the cumin-paprika oil of the pita toasts was really pretty drizzled on top of this. I used only one clove of garlic and the juice from the garbanzos instead of water. mmmm. the pita toasts were otherwise a bust, though.

Best hummus recipe I've found. I've made it twice and both times it was a BIG hit. This past Saturday I served it for a wedding (150 guests). Garnished with the parsley oil and pine nuts (no cumin available) and small edible flowers. We used plain pita but I'd like to try the spiced pita another time. Many asked for the recipe. Looking forward to making it again.

I agree with sabinka, it tasted awful. Not worth the effort.

Excellent! And I really liked the parsley oil drizzled on top.... interesting color, and slightly bitter flavor really livens up the hummus.

The one thing that I would add to these directions is to toast the cumin and pine nuts separately, since they have slightly different cooking times. But otherwise - this is delicious!

Best hummus recipe I've tried so far! One thing I've added that has been really good is a tablespoon or two of sun-dried tomato pesto. It adds a lot of flavor!

Served this at a book club meeting and it was devoured very quickly. It was definitely a big hit!

Excellent. The texture and flavor is so much better than store bought hummus (my usual). I didn't think the parsley oil was worth the effort and will just drizzle with olive oil next time. I think toasting the pine nuts on the stove is easier than the oven.

My guests loved this so much that I had to take it away so they could keep some room for the main course! It was perfect.

Our family spent years living in the Middle East and never had hummus this good! This receipe is easy and the hummus is smooth with none of the ingredients overwhelming the other. Excellent!

just coming back from the Middle East and eating HUMMUS for the first time, I just had to find a recipe for it and tried this one but added roasted peppers. I loved it, but plan to substitute roasted garlic for the raw garlic next time, as I found it quite overpowering.

Nice picnic fare. Since I didn't make the flavorful pita toasts, I used more toasted cumin and pine nuts, and substituted chives for the parsley in the oil -- worked really nicely.

Made this with fresh chick peas, but this did not help. It still tasted a little bit like cardboard. I may make this again, but next time I will add something! Anything! Also, it definitely needs more olive oil!

If you think it's good with canned garbanzo beans, use the stuff from scratch. (soak dried beans and use instead of canned stuff). There is a world of difference in the taste!

Very good. Next time I will add some roasted red peppers.

Tastes even better the second day! The motor on my blender started smoking after i had blended all but the pine nuts. The unexpected "chunky" hummus was actually quite good!

I discovered hummus at an Italian restaurant and found this recipe before I'd tried any others after trying others this is my favorite, we have this dish about 2x week, we tried baba ganoush at this same restaurant and I want to try now that eggplant ripening on the vine in my garden. I just have to let my eggplant grow, I'm so busy picking them and making broiled eggplant sandwiches, yum!

Back off the garlic and add 2/3 cup roasted red peppers.
