I mixed the finely chopped pistachios and cream together while I separated and whipped the eggs, which I think was a great choice: I got even more of that amazing pistachio flavor to seep in, and ran into no trouble whipping the cream with it already in there. It fits perfectly into a 9x13 pan, then I just sprinkled the coarsely chopped pistachios over the top. Looks and tastes great. Can't wait to try it once it's frozen. (Just stuck it in the freezer.)

As satisfying as this Pistachio Ice Cream (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Pistachio-Ice-Cream-5902) but so much easier to make.

OMG this is sooooo easy and so delicious! If you feel you can't cook, make this...watch a youtube video to see how to form the soft peaked whites and the stiff peaked whites and cream...Well worth my time shelling the nuts! I lined my freezing containers with plastic wrap for ease of unmoulding and I put candied cherries that I had left from Xmas in the bottom of the mould. I'm using up the egg yolks making egg yolk butter cookies to go with the semifreddo.

Based on other comments I made this with a cookie crust of Swedish orange ginger cookies (Anna's orange thins) and topped it with a chocolate ganache. Fantastic dessert.

Made this recipe last night for Father's Day. A few tips I have would be to line your dish with parchment paper so that unmolding it is not a hassle. I had quite a hard time trying to get it out of the pan, even after I had immersed it in a tub of hot water to loosen up the edges. I even tried running my knife around the edges, but the bottom still wouldn't unmold. I also took other reviewers' advice and added a drop of food colouring. I would recommend reserving the roughly chopped pistachios for sprinkling on top instead, as including them in the batter makes them lose their crunch. Although this recipe was tasty, I felt it was lacking that extra bit of crunch!

Good dessert and it really can't get much simpler. I think if I were to make it again, I'd use unsalted pistachios instead of salted. Also, the 4.5 hours suggested to freeze is spot on. I got impatient and pulled a couple servings out early and it wasn't frozen all the way through. It's just so much better when fully frozen.

The simplicity of ingredients and the fact that I made this 4 days ahead makes this a keeper. Most semifreddos(Try the Meyer Lemon one from this site-to die)will freeze for a long time if wrapped well. I lined a loaf pan and put a layer of roughly chopped nuts in the bottom before putting the custard in. Makes for a beautiful presentation when unmolded. Served with thin butter cookies and a drizzle of dark choc sauce. Yum.

This makes for a very impressive albeit easy dessert. Love making frozen desserts but dread the hassles with ice cream machine. Might experiment with a drop of food coloring as previously mentioned. Served with a decorative chocolate tuile cookie. Chocolate curls would be beautiful as well. Trader Joes has shelled pistachios.

This is fabulous. The first semifreddo I've made but definitely not the last. Beautiful, tasty, and refreshing. The longer it's frozen the more ice cream-like it will become, and less time makes it a unique half frozen (hence the name) mousse; either way, definitely freeze at least 8 hours. Makes a really simple and elegant dessert served with a butter cookie or shortbread. Haven't made this molded yet (i.e. in a loaf pan to invert and slice) but will next time I make this- maybe when the pistachio taint has lifted.

Spectacular! Added a couple of drops of green food coloring for a prettier presentation. Also served with a chocolate ganache (1 c. heavy cream heated and poured over 9 oz. chopped dark chocolate and 1 tablespoon rum). The ganache should be cooled slightly before using or allow it to cool in refrigerator for 1/2 hour and then whip for a fluffier result. By itself, the semifreddo would be a great icing for a dark chocolate cake.

I've made this for two dinner parties now and it was fantastic each time. Didn't change a thing about the recipe...it couldn't be easier and my guests all raved about it.

This is a fantastic recipe...my husband couldn't stop raving about it and he's not even a big fan of pistachios! I made some modifications, I baked a chocolate wafer and butter crust in a springform pan and covered it with the semifreddo...then, once frozen, I topped the semifreddo with a dark chocolate ganache and crushed pistachios...perfection!

very nice with chocolate cookies and can be made days in advance

I've made this about 3-4 times at different gatherings and each time it was a HUGE hit with the guests! My only dilemma is finding shelled pistachios so it takes time for me to shell each piece individually...urgh! The best tasting one I've made was when I substituted sugar with brown sugar...yummy!!!

I love this semifreddo. It's amazingly easy to make and absolutely delicious!

Oh my  I just finished making this semifreddo and it is unbelievable! You do not even need to freeze it. It would make a great topping for something you would normally put whip cream on. It is light and flavorable. Also, very easy even though you need to mess up your food processor and 2 bowls. I highly recommend it. It would also be a great base to add strawberries, chocolate or other flavorings instead of the nuts. Louise

Oh, my goodness. This was soooo good. I served it with the Pistachio, Lemon, and Vanilla Shortbread from the May 2004 Bon Appétit. Made a bit more than my 2 quart container could hold.

Very tasty and very easy. I was forced to leave the remainder behind for my hosts to enjoy. All you need is a chocolate crispy sweet to make it a well-balanced and impressive dessert. I made some chocolate pistachio biscotti.

Simply delicious! I will definitely be making this dessert again. Very easy to make and no need for an ice cream maker. I can see why this would pair nicely with any chocolate dessert.

I'm also a first-timer making semifreddo, and I've made this three times for friends--it has been a consistently big hit. Very easy to make, and more "special occasion" than ice cream or gelato...it's the 'ace' in my regular dessert rotation. Thanks to prcentauri for the suggestion of pairing it with a rich chocolate torte--definitely a winning match.

This was my first time making semifreddo. I made it exactly as in the recipe. My husband loves nuts, so I suprised him with this dessert for Valentine's Day. We both like ice cream and agreed that this was the best thing we have ever tasted (and we've eaten gelato all over Italy). I will make this again and again. Looking forward to trying this with hazelnuts and pecans.

This was the first time making semifreddo for me. It was a fairly easy process and I was so happy with the results (semifreddo was made as per recipe). It was an excellent dessert if you like pistacchio. When tasting the semifreddo you initially encounter a strong pistacchio flavor, which is followed by a delicious almond flavor. It was a big hit. I paired it with a very decadent and rich chocolate torte.
