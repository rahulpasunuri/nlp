The sauce & the chinese sausages were excellent way dress up a veggie stir fry, but I found that the two min of cooking in the last step was not nearly enough to thicken the sauce; will add less water then recommended next time.

Agree that this is a great use for lop cheung(my usual use is in fried rice). Only problem for us was the amount of ginger. I cut the amount in half and it was still more than we like, so will use just a teaspoon or so if making again.

easy as pie and tastes just as good.i was sceptical at first about the amount of corn starch but all in all the bold flavors of the ginger and soy really tamed the whole dish.i serve with coconut rice.

this is my favorite quick stir fry, but you CANNOT make it with anything but lop cheung  or you can, but it would be super-boring. i add some sesame chili oil for kick  you can make the whole thing in the time it takes for the rice to cook.

I thought this was great - very easy and could easily be made with chicken or beef. I added carrots for color and flavor and my family loved it. Enjoy

Delicious stir-fry with minimal prep. Few changes I made were to triple the sauce, sub'd shaohshing wine for the sherry, added diagonal cut carrots, sub'd chicken broth for water, then finished with sesame oil, added after taking pan off the heat. Served with steamed brown rice. Imagine that many asian greens, bean sprouts, deep-fried tofu and asparagus would be wonderful also. Healthy and quick to prepare and a colorful presentation.

Substituting Hsiao Hsing (Chinese rice wine) makes the recipe even better.

This is super easy--I tend to fudge with the ingredients if I don't have all on hand. The MAIN thing is to have the peas and Lup Cheong, though!

EASY to make! I agree, unique way to present lop cheong. I added another cup of water after putting in the cornstarch mixture for more gravy.
