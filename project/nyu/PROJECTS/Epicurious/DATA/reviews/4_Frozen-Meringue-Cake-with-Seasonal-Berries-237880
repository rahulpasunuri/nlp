This was a great hit. I followed someone's suggestion and ended with a pressed layer of meringues on the bottom, but before the meringues I also put in a layer of chopped dark chocolate 65-70%. With the fresh fruit, it was delightful!

I liked this recipe, my guests liked it and the only reason I'm giving it 3 forks is because it's nice, but not spectacular. A suggestion or two: Chop the meringues in big chunks -- they'll meld together anyhow and it gives a better texture. Pour some Cointreau over the mixed berries and let them macerate for 15 minutes before spooning over the meringue mess. It's a fine recipe on its own, however.

This dessert is so easy and yet looks very impressive when it comes to the table. I used a variety of seasonal berries and substituted grand marnier for the vanilla and added a little grand marnier to the whipping cream and berries. Delicious!

I used probably double the amount of meringues called for - so it was wonderfully crispy, with great contrasts of texture.

Excellent, very fast, and absolutely no leftovers. Used store-bought little meringues from Trader Joe's because I wanted something very quick. They are much sweeter than my homemade meringues, but the balance between this dessert and the berries was great. Looks like it was a lot more work than it was. You can vary the fruit, perhaps use choc chips or even mint flavor. A keeper.
