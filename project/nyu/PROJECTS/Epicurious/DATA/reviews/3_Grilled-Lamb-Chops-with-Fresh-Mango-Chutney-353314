The chops were fantastic! I marinated mine for about 5 hours which I think really allowed the meat to tenderize and soak up the yummy flavors. The mango chutney was ok but the ginger flavor was overpowered by the chili. I think the chops are great on their own.

It's pretty easy and good, but without the chutney, the chops are pretty bland. So much so that I kinda wonder whether you need bother with the yogurt marinade at all.

This was quick and easy and had great flavor. Really enjoyed it!
