Really? 15 min. active time? It took me at least 30 minutes between measuring, sifting together, whipping, beating, combining... Other than that, this is a pretty good basic recipe.

This was THE best banana bread I have ever made. The secret that I have discovered is the beating of the butter and sugar, for at least 5minutes on high to lighten the basis of the batter. Using whole milk didn't hurt and extra large eggs, all at room temp. I use the best flour, and didn't have cake flour, so it didn't make any difference. My man raved and wants me to start a new business.. He could sell it...... He said. Good recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe for banana nut bread. Pleasing to look at and even more delightful to taste. It makes a nice sized loaf with nice texture and flavor. I definitely will make again. Also liked the idea of freezing bananas when they get ripe for future use in this bread recipe. Thank you for a real treat!

I liked it, I ended up making them muffins... Makes a dozen and I put chocolate chips in there too. It ends up being 5 points for weight watchers.. I would like to find a way to cut back on the point value, so I think I'll fuss with it a little to find out how to make it less calories.

I have made this once before as directed, and only changed it this time because I thought I had all the right ingredients. It was great as stated though. My changes: 1%milk and lime instead of lemon, whole wheat and all purpose flour instead of cake, 1/3 white sugar, 1/3 dark brown, 3 bananas, pecans. Lots of changes - I hate it when people review a totally different recipe! Having said that, it was still good and the recipe is foolproof. Make what changes suit you.

This recipe sounds great on its own, but I made some changes. I did add in one TSP of cinnamon and 1 TSP of nutmeg, which gave it a little spice and did enhance the flavor. I also added one more banana, and one TSP of vanilla. It turned out perfect, this one is going in the recipe book!

I made a few changes to the recipe. Used 3 bananas instead of two and used Supra instead of sugar. I also used buttermilk instead of lemon curdled milk. Banana nut bread was very tasty, but I'm still looking for the banana nut bread my mom used to make, which was denser with more nuts and less of a cake texture.

Did it again ! Made this bland recipe forgetting I had done it a few times before and had been quite disappointed !! The bread is dense indeed but also very dry. Instead of adding this and that to try and improve it... why just we all move to another recipe !!??

this is our family favorite! it is dense, but that's what i like about it. i store it in the fridge after day one, and that seems to make it taste better on subsequent days. i use c.chips instead of nuts and add an extra banana to the batter when we have it (although it's fine as is). I love this sliced cold out of the fridge with peanut butter spread on top and a hot cup of good coffee. the perfect breakfast!

This bread was a lot of work and I followed the directions for the banana nut bread exactly. It looked just like the picture. It tasted okay but I was disappointed because it was very dense, not very moist and not sweet enough for my particular taste. I would use a little more sugar next time and maybe a little bit of oil of some kind to make it more moist. I am glad I wasn't making it for some event or occasion because I wouldn't have served it.

Wonderful recipe. Going with the theme of not wasting anything, I decided to use up the evaporated milk I mistook for condensed milk. The result is a deliciously moist, dense and rich banana nut bread that is hard to stay away from! Will experiment with adding spices next time.

Rating: 4
This recipe is indestructible! I beat in the flour/milk by hand since I had already put in the nuts by mistake. My oven was slow so took forever to rise even with the extra 1/4tsp powder- had to take it to the party and finish baking it there! Still came out moist and light. I did add an extra very ripe banana and a touch of vanilla. Great banana flavor that lingers. Could not ask for more!

Rating: 4
Excellent! At the request of my family I added chocolate chips instead of nuts. I used 3 bananas as other reviewers suggested. I also microwaved the butter too long to soften it and it melted completely, it still turned out great. One reviewer said it was too much like cake, I think it's more like cake than most banana breads but I like that it isn't heavy and too sweet.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic! I was looking for a basic banana bread recipe, and this one fits the bill. I made some substitutions due to what I had on hand: skim milk for whole, regular all-purpose flour for cake flour, and pecans instead of walnuts. I also added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and an extra banana. This made a big, fluffy beautiful looking loaf. For some reason, I have had trouble with banana bread in the past, always turning out too dense and heavy. This one was just right.

i love this recipe!! I've searched for a long time to find a good recipe for Banana bread and here it is. I used whole wheat flour(gotta be a good mommy)although I will try making it with the cake flour, sound good! I also added one extra banana and 1/2 tsp vanilla. I've made three loaves this week, and it's only my 11 month old and I. This one will be placed in my recipe book permanently!!

Reading this recipe, I recognized the sour-milk-and-soda foundation from recipes I inherited from my mother which are family favorites. This one turned out just as well. The use of cake flour makes a very delicate crumb. Like another reviewer I added some vanilla, which I may eliminate next time as it was fairly prominent even thought I only used 1 tsp. The banana flavour may be enough to carry this all by itself, with of course the walnuts.

Great - moist, light and a bit of tang from the citrus juice. I didn't have nuts, but put in coconut, and used lime instead of lemon juice. Will definitely make that one again - probably with lime, coconut and macadamia nut.

The bread turned out deliciously. I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the creamed butter and sugar mixture after adding the eggs. The key is to make sure to slowly add ingredients and blend completely. I also added a little less than 2/3 C sugar and it was perfect - not too sweet, yet sweet enough to bring out the banana flavor.

This is a really simple and good recipe (important for students) but I added dried cranberries which really adds some flavor.

I modified this recipe slightly, using 1/3 c buttermilk and 1/3 c whole milk, and i used about 1/2 Tbsp. lime juice instead of lemon. I used 3 ripe bananas (not black yet, but with tons of brown freckles). I also used 1/3 c granulated sugar, and 1/3 c brown sugar. Mostly, I made the substitutions because I had to work with what was on hand, but it turned out excellent! My family enjoyed it, it had a very nice taste. Only complaint was that it crumbled fairly easily when trying to cut it, but all our knives are dull anyhow. Was worth it for the amazing, soft texture! Cake flour in banana bread is a great idea - keeps it nice and light rather than heavy and dense...I hate that uncooked looking soggy heavy bottom layer in average banana bread.. this bread was great!! will make again for sure!!

This recipe was very good. The cake flour helped make it fluffy which was a nice change from some other recipes, I think next time I'll use an extra banana and 1/3 less nuts, personal preference. I also sprinkled the top with some brown sugar for a little added sweet crunch and it was very good.

I loved this recipe, and as you can see from my username, I love banana bread (with nuts). It's a classic recipe, the kind of banana bread my mom made when I was a kid. I used soy milk instead of whole milk, and regular flour instead of cake flour, but it turned out great anyway.

This was my first attempt at Banana Nut Bread. I happened to have 2 over ripe bananas left over, and decided to try it out. It turned out incredibly good.

I've made a lot of BNB and this is the BEST recipe I've found. There were a few minor adjustments that I personally found to enhance this one. I added a tsp of pure vanilla extract and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Don't be alarmed when you add the batter to your loaf pan and it is nearly to the rim. Will rise just right and be moist in the middle. Also - make sure you use extra ripe bananas.

This recipe yields the fluffiest, most delectable banana bread that I have ever made--and this is coming from an individual who has made many a quick bread in their lifetime! What creates the remarkable fluffiness about the bread in this recipe is the curdled milk. No other recipe for banana bread that I use requires it. This recipe is also fun to play around with: I like to add chopped hazelnuts, cinnamon, and, when I'm feeling indulgent, some bittersweet chocolate from time to time. I recommend this recipe to anyone of any baking calibre.

When I made this I had two black bananas, and I had never made banana bread before. This was the only recipe I found that didn't call for more bananas than I had. It was great! Better than I expected. Split between 4 adults and 4 children, it didn't last 5 minutes, and we were sad it was gone. The only changes I made were to add fresh bluberries, take out the nuts and I cooked it for about 20 minutes longer. I thought the blueberries might do it in, but they didn't!

This was a great banana bread. I didn't have lemon juice or buttermilk so substituted sour cream for the milk and lemon juice, added one additional banana and divided batter into two smaller loaf pans which were completely baked in one hour. Like one of the other reviewers found, exterior was crisp and brown, with tender, delicate interior.

Rating: 3
The flavor is very good. What makes this bread stand out is the softeness of the inside while the outside is very brown. This allows the bread to slice well. It is definately a keeper recipe. I made it just as the recipe indicated but had to bake longer than 1 hour. I used a convection bake oven and took 1 hour 20 minutes. We enjoyed this dessert!

Wonderful banana bread. i made it for my dad's birthday and it was great. i cooked it for an hour and a half at 400 and I don't know why it took so long because I followed the recipe to a t (except i didn't add lemon juice).. Great!

This is simply the best banana bread I have ever had. It took me a few tries to make it come out right though. The first time I made it, I tried to second-guess the recipe and double the bananas. The mix came out way too thin and would not cook. I do find that I can get away with using two largish bananas rather than two medium. I chop up half of one banana and puree the rest. Otherwise I follow the recipe to the letter. Cake flour is really a must. I tried it with regular flour and it was not nearly as good.

I was looking for a quick banana bread recipe to make for my mother inlaw. Without reading the reviews I put it all together. The only change I made was to use non-fat milk instead of whole milk. After I put the bread into the oven, I sat down to read the reviews. Boy did I get nervous. I thought it would be horrible. After taking it out of the oven and letting it cool, it was wonderful. Moist on the inside, a little crunchy on the outside. I'm sure that in a few days, after it cures wrapped in plastic wrap, it's gonna be fantastic. I would make this again.

I used this recipe to make 12 muffins, and I thought the muffins turned out quite nice. I only used two bananas because that was all I had. I also used 1/4 cup wheat flour because I ran out of all purpose. I also ran out of pecans and used a mix of walnuts and pecans, and 1% milk because that was what I had. While it wasn't a strong flavor, I thought it was easy to make even though it did use three bowls.

I really do not understand why there is so much praise for this recipe. This banana bread tasted very bland and lacked any real banana flavor.

Followed this recipe to the letter and had great results. A tip for the lazy cook : when banana's start to go spotty and dont seem appetizingas a hand fruit, toss them in the freezer whole and in the peel so they go black. Before using in a recipe , float them in a sinkful of warm water for 10 mins and then open the skins and squirt out the insides. They will be well ripened with highly developed sugars, and essentially premashed.

Don't over-do the bananas. I wouldn't use more than 3. I recently made it with four - it smelled great but never firmed up. I have made the regular recipe before and I think it tastes great as is. Bottom line, don't buy TOO many extra bananas at the grocery store in hopes of making banana bread!

I've made this twice. The first time, as written - it was pretty good, a little bland. The second time, I changed it by: adding 1t vanilla, reducing butter to 2/3 stick, and using 4 bananas. I also use buttermilk. It came out more banana-y and less greasy. Very yummy! Moved it up from 2 to 3 stars.

Feel free to use your fermented bananas. We use 4 small loaf pans and typically add few chocolate chips to 2 of them. Cooking time is reduced to about 40-45 minutes. Baking soda can be substitued with half a cup of yogurt (leave only 1/2 cup of milk) and an extra 1/4 tsp baking soda.

Don't omit the lemon juice. I have tried loads of banana breads, and curdled milk is the secret for success. Buttermilk doesn't do it, you have to add lemon juice or vinegar to the milk for the right consistancy and flavor.

I haven't made this recipe but I would recommend not to omit the lemon juice. Isn't some acid required to react with the baking soda to make the bread rise?

I omitted the lemon juice and added vanilla instead. I used three large bananas. I found the batter became a bit runny, so only used around 1/2 cup of milk. I didn't have cake flour, so I used sifted regular flower. I used a large rectangular pan instead of a cake round -- it would never have fit in a cake round. It was a pretty good recipe. Not jaw-dropping, but competent. I would add cinammon or nutmeg if I made it again.

Homo is short for homogenized which just means that the milk has been processed so that it doesn't separate (and remains homogenous). Whole milk is so named to distinguish it from lowfat or nonfat milk. Whole milk has no fat removed. You can have homogenized whole, lowfat or nonfat milk.

Guess I'm in the minority here, but I'm sticking to my old standby recipe from now on. I think the lemon in this recipe counteracts the banana flavor somehow.

I'm always looking for ways to use up bananas, we live aboard a sailboat in the Caribbean - so they are plentiful. But cooking aboard is a challenge & I often have to sustitute ingredients. I only had soy milk & I wasn't sure if it would work. When I added the lime (always have limes - not lemons, I was surprised it courdled. Added vanilla - can't imagine bb without. Only had baking powder so I doubled up (of course I was guessing on the measure anyway as my teaspoon had gone overboard long ago). Mixed everything up and tasted the batter. Mashed up a third banana and stirred in with the nuts. After all that it turned out great - a boatyard favorite!

This was a great tasting recipe... I thought about skimping and using skim milk and less butter, but decided not to and it was delicious.
