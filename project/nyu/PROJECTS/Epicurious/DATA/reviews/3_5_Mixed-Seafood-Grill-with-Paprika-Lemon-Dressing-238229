I've made this dish several times and it is always a winner with my fiance. Just make sure to cook the squid until they curn up on themselves otherwise they can be a little underdone and squishy. The flavors of the finishing sauce are vibrant and go well with the smokiness of the grill.

This is a great recipe that makes the most of the fresh seafood. The dressing is simple and does not overpower the fish. I used a mix of scallops, squid, and shrimp served with grilled veggies and grilled bread for dipping. I left the squid tubes whole, but next time will halve and score them bc the insides of larger ones stayed a little slimy. Also, I raised the temp of the grill to get better sear marks and allow for easier release off the grates. I've found with seafood it's best to slightly undercook and allow for carryover cooking.

This recipe is a staple for my summer grilling get-togethers. Always RAVE reviews. Prepared as written with substitutions in the type of seafood that's fresh and available. I think that if it happened to get a negative review, it might be because it was prepared incorrectly......? Try it. You'll love it.

I made this with just squid. The trick is to barely cook the squid and then pour the dressing over. It's fantastic. I served it with brown rice. My boyfriend liked it so much he asked me to make it for his birthday dinner. I'll serve it with an argula salad.

I just marinaded the seafood.. then read that It is a dressing not a marinade.. anyone else do that? Fingers crossed it turns out! I used colossal tiger shrimp, tuna that I cubed and diver scallops... all fresh from the sea so hopefully it will be good no matter what!

Made this recipe with monkfish, shrimp & calamari. EVERYONE loved the Monkfish on the grill with this marinade -- and they never had Monkfish before! Forget everything else. (If serving with za'atar on flatbread, use Naan (garlic flavor) bread on the grill with a good amount of olive oil so that lots of the za'atar will stick to the bread. The flatbread should be covered in za'atar -- 2 TBSP may not be enough.

We really liked this. Yes the dressing is simple but that's all good seafood needs. As others have noted, substitutions for the fish / seafood varieties work well. I think its the concept of the mixed grill that we liked.

Outstanding simple seafood dish - I also used orange roughy (cost) and scallops (personal preference). What I really liked was the simple variety and dressing. It's pretty similar to other grilled seafood but somehow just worked out exceptionally well.

Got rave reviews. I used Orange Roughy instead of flounder and large scallops cut in half instead of squid. The accompanying relish was more like a sauce, because I used canned roasted red peppers instead of roasting fresh, and I also used jarred jalapeno slices I chopped, but it was delicious also.

Not very impressed, this accompanying sauce was bland, tasting mostly of olive oil. The accompanying relish recipe is good, but overpowered the halibut, used octopus instead of squid which wasn't a good switch. Won't try again.
