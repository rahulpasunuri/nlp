I enjoyed these cupcakes, not too sweet, nice and moist. I used a whole cup of chocolate chips in the batter and it came out just right for 12 cupcakes, I had plenty of batter, and bake them for 20 min, had no problems. I added some peanut butter to the icing, and it was delish!

I made these yesterday evening. They were wonderefully moist and lovely! I used 1/3 cup peanut butter, but because mine was homemade, I used about 2 tablespoons more milk to compensaate for the driness of the peanut butter.I also used about 2 tablespoons less sugar than stipulated. I got 7 cupcakes out of this, so next time I will double the recipe, to get 12 bigger cupcakes.

This was delish! I made them for my mother's birthday party

These cupcakes are great! I made them in a muffin tin (the batter made about seven muffins). I added a tiny bit more peanut butter (about a tbsp more) and I had to add icing/confectioners sugar to the frosting to make it more... well, like frosting! But all in all they were really lovely.

Awesome with chunky pb, also substituted choc chips for piece of chocolate in the center of the cupcake...big winner.

These cupcakes were outstanding. The cupcake was reminiscent of a Reese's peanut butter cup. Mmm! And they were SO easy to make. I didn't make the frosting in this recipe, but used some leftover chocolate frosting with almond extract in it ("Chocolate Icing", Bon Appetit, March 1999). A perfect combination!

I baked these for the minimum time and they came out a little dry and the peanut butter taste was a bit faint. I'll try again and make some adjustments.

These are really good! I did not use double-acting baking powder though - I couldn't find it at my grocery store. Just used regular and they turned out fine. Anyone know what difference there is between double-acting and regular? Also, next time I might use creamy PB instead of chunky - the little peanut pieces were a little distracting in the moment. :) Lastly, I had a little trouble with the icing - it didn't whip up fluffy at all - it pretty much stayed like ganache. Perhaps I didn't whip it long enough? Either way, great cupcakes - not dry at all - would definitely recommend!

boy were these a disappointment!! Nearly inedible. I took in all of the advice and still they were rock hard and tasted terrible.

These were great! I suspect the people who said they came out dry over baked them because I cooked them for 20 minutes exactly and mine were perfect. The only thing I did differently was add another 1/2 cup of chips. I also used the caramel milk chocolate frosting that I had left over from another cake (do a search on this site for that frosting). YUMMM!

Very delicious and very easy. We doubled the recipe and used 2/3cup peanut butter and mini chocolate chips. Try a chocolate buttercream frosting and you will be in cupcake heaven. The doubled recipe made 20 nice-sized cupcakes.

These cupcakes are amazing! The batter is silky smooth and the texture of the cupcakes is very moist. The flavor is good, but a little more peanut butter would be welcomed. I frosted these with mocha frosting, sort of a mud pie cupcake. Delicious!

I absolutley loved these cupcakes! They were so moist and delicious. I couldn't keep them out of my mouth! I made one batch for my family at home, and my three kids devoured them in minutes! Well done!

I found these to have an excellent texture and were moist, but lacked of much flavor.

saw this in gourmet and couldn't pass up. they were very easy, and i also used a different frosting due to lack of supplies at home. I used powdered sugar w/ cocoa frosting, less time consuming. everyone loved these!

I just made these last night with my 4and half year old. We had a blast! They came out scrumptious, and my daughter loved the chunks of chocolate chips inside the cakes. One thing I did differently was to not scald the cream and chocolate for the frosting. Instead, I simply beat the cream with a tiny bit of vanilla and added 1/2tbls powdered sugar, and once whipped, threw in about 1/4C chocolate chips. We spread the whipped cream on each, and they were absolutely delicious!

I made these without the icing and a tad less sugar and they were scrumptious.

These cupcakes are so easy to make, and outrageously good! You can't eat just one! The frosting is messy, though. Best to let it set after frosting for a while, but even then, have lots of napkins ready!

I undercooked the recipe as some of the other reviewers suggested and they came out fantastic! They were not dry at all. I found them to be a perfect combination of peanut butter and chocolate flavors. For decoration, I sprinkled the tops with peanut butter baking chips.

I think these cupcakes are great. The people who thought they were dry maybe should bake them for a few fewer minutes. I live at high altitude so I used 1/4 tsp less baking powder and a little less sugar.

Keeping in mind that others had found these cupcakes to be too dry, I was cautious and mine turned out fine. I did two things different: 1) I added about 1/4 cup more chocolate chips to batter 2) to save on dishwashing I added chocolate chips to small saucepan containing scalded cream for icing. I cooked my cupcakes in a convection oven for 19 minutes.

I don't know what the other readers are talking about. I have made these twice and both times wound up with moist, yummy cupcakes. I did use slightly less sugar and about a third less chocolate chips in the batter, but that would not account for the difference. I urge you to try again.

Even though I sensed hesitation from most of the cooks who made these cupcakes, I went ahead because I had all the ingredients. Hearing that they were dry, I added more butter and a little less flour to no avail. If you can make a moist delicious cupcake from this recipe, you are a better baker than I!

unfortunately, I didn't make the cupcakes, but the icing was divine! So easy, too!!

whoa! 1 and 1/4 cups chocolate chips to 1/4 cup heavy cream? WON'T THAT BE RATHER GLUE-Y?????

These cupcakes had a very strange texture. They were dry and tasteless. Do not recommend.

I too found these a little dry and heavy (of course I accidentally over-baked them by about 5 minutes) but my kids love them anyways, I'll try it again and see if they come out better.

I keep hoping that baked goods made with peanut butter wont be dry, but once again I have been disappointed. I love the combo of chocolate and peanut butter, but it just doesn't make a good cake or cupcake, in my opinion. Too dry.

I was the lucky recipient of these cupcakes on Oscar night...they were the best combination of flavors imaginable, and the texture was just right - neither too light nor too heavy in the cake, and rich, real chocolate as icing. Loved 'em.
