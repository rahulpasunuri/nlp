This was the best soup I've ever made! My onions didn't grow well this year, so I used leeks and garlic instead. They're in the same family. I also didn't have any flour after making cookies earlier, so used spelt instead. Oh, and I didn't have any butter, so used some lard. I also didn't have any beef broth, but did have some left over turkey broth, so used that instead. When it came time for the cheese, I had only some American. It worked, and held down the over-floaty croutons nicely. I agree with the other reviews saying it needs some alcohol. I'd suggest adding it after it cools just a little though to keep from losing the kick. I used Jack Daniels. Mmmm.... My wife never knew what hit her! Highly recommended.

The onions take longer than 40 min to cook so add extra time for that. Using Gruyere is worth the expense - use it!

I made this recipe as a light lunch dish for a meeting with a colleague in my home-office. I used chicken instead of beef broth, as well as a different type of cheese. I also cooked the onions for a good 2 hours. Topped with toast rounds and cheese, it really made a filling business lunch without leaving either of us feeling stuffed or sluggish. If I were making it again for a non-business meal, I would definitely add wine and garlic to give it a bit stronger, more "adult" personality. I would definitely make it again; both in the original and in an adapted versions.

Very good, simple recipe. I used a variety of onions. I filled the bowls, topped with toasted bread and topped the toast with swiss cheese. I broiled it in the oven to get the cheese bubbly. Everyone loved it. The key is to slowly saute the onions. I cooked the onions for 4 hours before adding any wine or broth.

My husband said I was amazing with this recipe. Taking other reviewers opinions in mind--Cook the onions for MORE than 1 hour. (I broiled mine to hurry the process) To cut down on the cooking time, dice the onions!! Also used ALL sweet yellow onions--I would recommend AGAINST this; i felt it gave my soup a too sweet taste. Omitted ALL ALCOHOL--I am recovering and swear against it even with cooking. Used Cave Aged Gruyere. ALSO note, my husband is gluten free so I used gluten free beef broth. All in all, this was good. I will keep it on the menu so I can tweak it to my liking but it was missing something.

I've loved French onion soup since I was a small child. For this soup I used red onions, white onions, and yellow onions. I also added about a quarter cup minced garlic and a quarter cup minced shallots later on in the saute so they would retain more of their texture after the soup had come to a boil. As I incorporated the beef broth I added about a third of a cup of Sauvignon Blanc, it's hard to say as I poured it straight from the bottle. For the gratiné I chose to use Danish Havarti with a light smattering of sharp white cheddar. During the boil and simmer I added three drops of Italian Black Truffle infused olive oil, about a tablespoon of fresh ground pepper, a teaspoon of sea salt, and a pinch of marjoram. I added the gratiné and broiled. Delicious if I do say so myself, or perhaps that's the wine talking.

This soup is fine - nice and light and not nearly as buttery as Julia Child's recipe (though I used 3/4ths of a stick rather than the recommended 1/2 stick). As I was tasting the soup and set it to simmer, I realized the recipe was missing something big. A cup of good, dry, white wine. I added a cup as the soup was simmering but wish I'd had the foresight to add before I poured in the beef broth. With this change, I will make the soup again.

I love French onion soup. Every time I go to a diner I order it and nothing else. I really wanted to make it myself, so I tried this recipe, and it was excellent. I used sweet onions which gives it a really rich taste and my local grocery store didn't sell Grunyere cheese, so I used provolone instead, and it worked excellently.

This was my first time making onion soup, and also the first time I've ever eaten it. As such I feel I can only offer a limited review. I read all the reviews and added garlic, mustard, thyme, white wine and a bay leaf. Over all, I think the flavour was good, but it was more of a pot of well seasoned onions than a soup. I added more broth than the recipe called for and had hardly any. After a day in the fridge, it seems that the onions have absorbed whatever moisture was left. I'm now cooking up some steaks in the remaining onion mixture. While I definitely came away with some tips and tricks, I will undoubtedly be on the lookout for a new onion soup recipe.

French Onion Soup is an all-time favorite of mine. I make a few changes to this recipe: I'll add some garlic in with the onions. and for the stock, I usually use chicken. And as for the bread, I'll put it under the broiler first, because I like my bread crispy. And lots and lots of Gruyere. I'm in heaven after having some. And even though the outside temperature is in the 80s today, I want some right now!

Rating: 4
This is also very close to the recipe I have used for years. It takes time, but the key to good french onion soup is to really carmelize the onions. I usually spend about 2-3 hours depending on how many onions I use. It is well worth the wait. The onions become sweet and almost melt in your mouth. Sometimes I use half chicken and half beef stock. I always add brandy. For a little extra decadence, add some heavy cream or half & half just before serving. So good!

My favorite soup! Exactly like I've been making for years. I let the onions slowly caramelize for almost an hour on low heat while cooking the rest of the meal. In Paris, this was served with extra shredded cheese on the side and that's how I've come to prefer it. *Great with Rose wine*

I have been making this soup for years with rave reviews everytime. I have continuously been told that it is the best french onion soup that anyone has had. With this being said, I have additions. I add white wine about 1/4-1/2 Cup, I add more butter when finished to give it a richer flavor and garlic when I am initially carmelizing the onions. It is work, but the end result is worth it and this soup freezes very well.

"Better like bouillon" is the best kept secret in fine restaurants..(it is now available in most supermarkets..use beef flavor and some chicken flavor for this soup..for the vegetarian . use vegetable flavor. Also available in lobster. I use it in everything to make the best french sauces...also marsala wine is the perfect sweetness and depth of flavor for this soup. You can use the Better than bouillon with the canned beef stock to make for a more homemade flavor. Microwave the onions in glass with a lid and some water to get them started( a few minutes on medium power or until clear) then drain and transfer to the stovetop to cut down the cooking time and carmelize

Rating: 3
This soup was very good with modifications from prior reviewers -- good broth, add herbs, etc. To simplify I carmelized the onions (and some added garlic)by slicing them and cooking on low in a crockpot 8 hrs +/- with a light coating of olive oil. A few pieces of onion will get very brown, but otherwise this made the difference between having soup and not having soup due to time saved.

Rating: 4
I made a modified version of this recipe, and the result was outstanding. I used a mix of onions (2 sweet Mayan, 2 yellow, and 2 white) and three cloves of garlic. I roasted the onions and garlic for an hour, before slicing and cooking over the stove top (be prepared, slicing half-cooked, hot-to-the-touch onions is a messy process). After the baking, it took an additional 50 minutes to caramelize the onions in the soup pot. For the broth, I used 32 ounces of store-bought, organic beef stock (with a lower salt content); two 10 ounce cans of Campbell's beef broth (which deepened the color and flavor of the soup); and 1/4 cup of burgundy wine. I also dropped in one sprig each of fresh rosemary and thyme. I filled oven-safe bowls with the soup, placed the toasted French bread on top, covered the bread with a healthy layer of Gruyere, and toasted it under the broiler for a few moments, until brown. The end result was even better than I expected. I will certainly make this again. Thank you to all the previous reviewers for their great recommendations! Note: The addtion of the extra broth and wine made for a slightly brothier soup, which I prefer. Next time, I may add more.

Awesome recipe. Per previous users advice, I added thyme, rosemary (pinch of powdered), 1 clove garlic, small glug of sherry and red wine and a pinch of kosher salt. Very rich flavor. Used half canned broth and half homemade broth from prime rib.

I took advice from other reviews and added garlic, thyme, rosemary and sherry. I found when cooking the onions (I used sweet onions) they released a lot of liquid of their own. I drained that to facilitate the browning process and added that liquid to the broth. When I added the broth I used a pressure cooker and cooker it for 8 min. It was a delicious soup. I think that the pressure cooker really enhances flavors.

very good French onion soup, but it takes a long time. I took the advice from others and baked the onions and garlic for an hour before hand, cut up and carmalized them. It still took over an hour to carmalize them properly, and I should have done longer. if you have little time, be ware, otherwise, this is a wonderful recipe. I also added some red wine, and should have added some thyme, I will do so next time. the baking of the onions made the onions moer sweet than I thought mine would have been, as I used whatever onions I had around the house (basic yellow onions, and one white one). enjoy

As my husband is a vegetarian, I sustituted the beef bouillon with organic vegetable broth. I also used some red wine (Hungarian wine from Eger) and 1/2 cup of 10 year old port. Also, I added some crumbled Roquefort blue cheese with the gruyère on the toasted baguette slice which lovingly laid atop the delicious soup.

Not for the first timer - too much tweaking involved. Read the reviews, folks, and you will be happy. Sherry , garlic and red wine were my biggest departure from the norm - great ideas! (You'll never weasle out of the onion slicing, 1 hour browning thing.) Of course, gruyere- covered croutons make for much more civilized eating.

My daughter was bringing her boyfriend over and requested some home made onion soup. After reading all the reviews I decided to (1) roast a 3-assortment onions with 3 cloves garlic, (2) use 1 cup red wine and 1/2 cup brandy; (3) use low sodium beef broth and adjust salt to taste at the end; and (4) melt some gruyere on the toast before inserting on top of soup. After the 20-minute simmer I tasted for season adjustment and the soup lacked depth I was looking for. I added some Bonne Herbs (about 1 Tablespoon) and simmered for an additional 10 minutes. It was outstanding. Timing from slicing to serving 2+ hours. Great, rich flavor, one of the best. I do not think the roasting did anything and I will probably skip and go straight to caramelizing (also saves an hour). Next night I used croutons instead of a slice of bread and made for easier eating. Thanks to all for the suggestions.

I'm not going to rate this recipe as posted. As I have been experimenting with French onion soup for years, and this is my conclusions. Use yellow cooking onions instead of sweet. All alcohol used can be equally as delicious but different in taste. I also add dijon mustard to the onions, this gives the soup a little extra flavour. The stock of course, has to be of the highest quality.

Rating: 3
I combined the advice of previous reviewers and used 1. four kinds of onions (spanish, vidalia, white, and 1 red) 2. a 2:1 ratio of beef to chicken broth 3. red instead of white wine. I made also sure to use swiss gruyere where swiss cheese was called for. It was fantastic as a first course for company, as well as a meal on its own for me the next day. I would give it four forks but because I altered the written recipe, will not.

A basic soup recipe can inspire one to create something entirely different. The following recipe is the result of a few days of playing around in the kitchen (and even my difficult Parisian boyfriend liked it). Use homemade duck broth (rosemary, whole clove garlic - lots of it - marjoram and orange peel, and a sizeable splash of decent burgundy, as good cooking loves expensive wine)

I found this quite dissapointing, considering all the rave reviews. I used a combination of home made chicken and beef stock, so I know that wasn't the problem.

As most everyone else has said, this is an excellent basic recipe for french onion soup. It's so simple and tastes wonderful every time I have made it. And because of this basic nature it is very easy to doctor and put your own personal stamp on it. One of my favorites, in addition to adding some wine (red or white - have made it both ways) and oven roasting some vegetables, is for the croutes. I toast the bread in the oven after drizzling with a little olive oil at 200 - 250 for about an hour while the onions are caramelizing. Then after they are nicely toasted I rub them with a clove of garlic. Finally I float the croutes on the soup, cover with cheese, and pop the whole thing under the broiler until cheese is bubbly.

Usually, the first time I try a recipe I follow it to the letter, but the previous cook's comments (A Cook from Random Hall, Cambridge) were intriguing so I followed all suggestions (roasting onions and garlic first, adding red wine, etc.) and the result was amazing. My only tweak was to add half red wine and half dry sherry. I think one of the benefits of this site is that you can learn from those who tried the recipe before you. Thanks Cambridge!

I added 1 cup red cooking wine, and a few cloves of garlic, which made for an even richer flavor. Definitely go for a good cheese! I picked up this tip from one of the other french onion soup recipes on this site, and highly reccommend it: roast the onions and garlic (unpeeled and uncut) in the oven at 375F for an hour before sauteing. The onions become very sweet and carmelize more quickly and evenly. There were so many onions in this recipe that placing the bread at the bottom of the bowls didn't work; the onions held them down. Toast the bread with slices of gruyere on them in a toaster oven, pour the soup, push in the bread, and add even more chese on top. There is no such thing as too much good cheese.

Very good basic onion soup, except I added a cup of sweet white wine to enhance the flavor, as well as augmenting the beef broth with about 6 boullion cubes. It was better the second day, especially when you take the fat off the top before you reheat the soup. Turned out as good as it is in a good French bistro.

So easy to make and walk away! I cut the onions, threw them in with a whole stalks of celery and parsley, which I removed later. I went sparingly on the boullion (no canned broth) and added some SPIKE to compensate. I threw it all in, added some medeira wine and put the lid on. Before I left I threw the bread in the toaster. When I came back the toast was ready to be cheesed for the bowl and the soup was done. It took me 5 minutes of prep time on either end of simmering, and the soup was incredible! It may seem silly to say, but I wouldn't have thought to put the bread and cheese in FIRST, then pour the soup on top, because of the way it is presented in restaurants. Of course that makes sense! The soup goes to the bottom on its own.

Very good. It took 100 minutes, not 40, to get the onions golden, and I would've cooked them longer but I was very hungry. I used sweet onions. Maybe regular yellow onions would've been a better choice because the soup was a bit too sweet for my taste. My only change was to add 1/4 cup of dry sherry. Overally, delicious.

This makes a lovely onion soup. It is reasonably easy to prepare - at least once the onions are peeled. I used a mix of large Spanish and small cippoline. I also cooked the onions much longer than specified in the recipe - approx. 90 minutes to get them golden. Taking a cue from Julia Child, I did add some white wine with the beef broth (canned, low-salt) and a splash of brandy at the end. The gruyere toasts on top are a nice touch.

This is the quintessential onion soup recipe - prepared exactly as is. I made it last night for my fiance and he went crazy for it. I was afraid that it would be too salty with all the beef broth, but turns out that it wasn't salty enough! So add in the salt and pepper liberally at the end. Also, for those making this recipe for the first time, don't get nervous about all the raw onions you're cutting (a mandoline is ideal for this, FYI). I was wondering how I would get two huge bowls full into my regular spaghetti pot, but they reduce quickly -- so don't fret.

I made the soup using 3 12 oz cans vegetable broth, and 1 12 oz can beef broth. My guests raved and one mentioned that it was a winner because it was sweet, w/out the usual bite. I think the veg broth helped that. I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe in combination with a recipe from another gourmet magazine for our Gourmet Club. It was French night so what else could I make? To serve 8 people: use 6 pounds onions(they take way more than 40 minutes to carmelize, be patient), 6 14 ounce cans beef broth, also added sherry and a bouquet garni of bay leaf, juniper berries, thyme and parsley (as suggested by other magazine. You'll need 1 lb gruyere cheese. The soup was good and all enjoyed. Next time I would try adding the wine. Sweet onions were hard to come by this time of year, just used regular yellow onion, and a sprinkling of sugar to the mix.

The recipe was good, and I'll definitely make it again. For some reason, though, I found that there just wasn't enough broth when I was done, so the bread was almost resting on the bottom of the bowls. It might be a good idea to make a little more broth than you anticipate needing. BTW, the flavor was good, but I thought the broth was just a little bland - I found the following additions made it even better: 1/2 cup white wine (added before the broth) A couple dashes of sea salt A dash of sugar A dash of vinegar A small amount of fresh thyme

I let the soup sit in the fridge for at least 8 hours for the flavors to develop.

I followed the others and added more broth and I added sherry. It was delicious. Be sure to cook the onions until they caramelize to bring out the sweetness.

This soup was delicious! Be sure to add more broth and fewer onions as others have said. White wine is a great addition as well. Overall, it turned out to be everything I'd hoped for

Absolutely delicious! I used three cans of chicken broth, one can of beef broth, and one can of water. I also used a bit more onions than the recipe. My husband thought it was wonderful.

Use 1 less onion than called for and 2 quarts of broth. Add to that a generous 1/4 cup of white wine. I definitely would use a good gruyere for the true authentic french onion soup. I browned individual serving crocks under the broiler until nice and brown and bubbly. Make sure to slice the onions as thinly as possible.

Like others said, too many onions and not enough broth. Other than that, just great! I used fresh mozzarella [di Bufala] and Reggiano for the cheese topping instead of Gruyere/Swiss.

This soup had a nice flavor. There wasn't a lot of broth, a bit to thick. I would have preferred a clear broth.

I made this with a substitution and an addition: I added a package of mushrooms, and used Asiago instead of Gruyère. It reminds me of wonderful onion soup I had in a Strasbourg bistro. I'll make this again with dry sherry. Definitely another welcome addition to my ever-growing recipe box!

Excellent. Perhaps not the most exotic or complex soup, but for something so easy to make, it's outstanding. As others have noted, the key to this soup's success seems to the slow carmelization of the onions. (In reading over the recipe, my father said, "Honey, there must be some mistake: who cooks onions for 40 minutes?" I let the soup speak for itself, and after finishing his second bowl of soup, my dad decided that onions taste pretty good after 40 minutes of cooking). Again, as others have noted, white wine enriches the soup, as does extra butter. Enjoy!

FOUND RECIPE LITTLE BLAND FIRST TIME MADE. INCREASED AND ADDED THE FOLLOWING. INCREASED: 1/4TH CUP BUTTER, 1 TABLESPOON FLOUR. ADDED 1/2 CUP DRY SHERRY AND 1/2 CUP DRY WHITE WINE. USED WALLA WALLA SWEET ONIONS THIS TIME AND MAUI ONIONS FIRST TIME. FOUND THE WALLA WALLA BETTER OF THE TWO.

This soup is wonderful, tasty, sophisticated. I served it with a salad and dessert and had a fabulous supper. Appreciate other reviewers' hints about adding white wine; it makes all the difference.

I deeply carmelized my onions---used all sweet ones, added a smidge more butter----no white wine, added dry red...topped with toasted baguette bread---melted mozzarella and monterey jack.....oustanding!!!!!!!!!

This recipe always performs and rates highly among my family and guests. The suggestion of another rater to add white wine makes the soup even better and adds depth to the flavors. I believe that carmelizing the onions is another key to the superiority of this soup.

This soup is delicious, however, I would suggest (as I did the next time I made it) putting in 11/4 quart of broth and then adding 1/4 quart of a dry white wine...it enhances the taste of the soup significantly!! YUM :)

I found that I liked this recipe better than that of my favorite french restaurant. It's significantly less salty. I also added extra cheese. Delicious!

Easy to make. Very tasty.

this is a classic yet simple version of the dish. for a richer, more rounded flavor, i recommend adding a bit of cooking wine when sauteing the onions. makes a great (vegetarian) meal paired with a ceasar salad or roasted beets with goat cheese.

This is a very simple yet delicious french onion soup. It doesn't make as much as I thought it would. This recipe can only feed 2 hungry people. It's definitely one to try!
