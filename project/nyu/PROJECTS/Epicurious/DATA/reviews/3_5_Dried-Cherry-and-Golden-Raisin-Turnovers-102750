I had extra homemade puff pastry, so I made these and the chocolate orange turnovers on epi. I'm not a huge cherry fan, but these won over the two flavors! I liked the creaminess of the filling, and used dried sour-cherries so they weren't overly sweet. A keeper recipe

these are awesome! everyone raved about them. i'm going to make them smaller next time since, as is, these are pretty large.

These were good, but nothing too terribly special. Try perhaps 4 or 5 oz cream cheese and similarly adjusted amount of sugar to make them a bit jucier. Still, a good rainy day treat.

Because the recipe is so easy, I didn't think the turnovers would be that good. I was wrong! They're great: only drawback is that they are best when made just before serving...but don't let that stop you!

Yum and oh-so easy. I rolled out the puff pastry to allow for six squares instead of four, as I had guests. A keeper!
