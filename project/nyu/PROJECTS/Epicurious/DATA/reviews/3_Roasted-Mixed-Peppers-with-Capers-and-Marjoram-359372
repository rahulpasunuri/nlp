This is a great recipe to add a unique kick to your frozen salmon recipes. For example, you can make a salmon sandwich with this pepper medley as a topping -- sounds great right? We're gonna give it a try!

I thought this was a lot of work and not that great. The overall consistency is not very appealing, it is somewhat slimy. It is very attractive and impressive looking, just overall somewhat disapointing.

Excellent as a salad side or sandwich accompaniment.

Turned out great! Made sure to use red, yellow, and orange peppers with the green Anaheim chillies...gave the dish more color. I also added in chopped cilantro leaves, some cumin, and a little chili powder. Because of peeling 8 peppers the dish takes awhile to prepare, but once those are done and sliced it goes quickly after that. Definitely a dish worth trying. Can also be put on top of burgers, steaks, etc. Use your imagination.
