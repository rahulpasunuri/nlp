really yummy. made exactly as written except left veggies in big chunks bc that's the way we like it. May add slightly less balsamic at the end next time. Take MUCH longer than recipe says but it is worth the effort.

After chopping and cooking the food is done. It is a simple and rich dish. Pairs great with a fresh baguette. Also a healthy choice for all and vegetarian friendly. The tomato sauce makes it robust and complete; delicious.

Although chopping cooked veggies isn't fun, the taste was well worth the time. Wonderful recipe

Roast vegetables in smaller batches so that they don't steam. Roast peppers separately, skins didn't come off very well. I used less olive oil on the veggies. Consider serving chopped black calamata olives to sprinkle on top, also a dusting of parmesian might be interesting. Bake all in a quiche dish at end and use grating of cheese on top. Serve with crusty bread. Also, I used Herbes of Province instead of fresh herbs, and added them while the vegetables were simmering.

I believe that ratatouille is a dish from Nice, rather than the more general term Provence. I also believe that a "real" Nice ratatouille is made as follows. Ingredients. Eggplant, onions, ripe tomatoes, green/red peppers, zucchini, garlic, basil, (thyme and parsley), olive oil, flour, salt, pepper. The sauce consists of crushed tomatoes (peeled and de-seeded), garlic, thyme, parsley, basil, olive oil. Cook until concentrated. Remove parsley and thyme. Cut and fry separately each of the other vegetables, in separate (or cleaned) pans in olive oil and add to the sauce which is kept warm. The eggplant is sprinkled with flour which thickens the ratatouille a little. Mix well but not too vigorously. After resting remove any excess olive oil. Some notes. This dish is not suitable for putting over rice or pasta. It is eaten hot with a grilled meat such as lamb or chicken or fish, dishes that require no other sides. It can be eaten at room temperature, by itself as a starter and with a poached egg. It can be eaten cold right out of the fridge. It keeps well for several days in the fridge. Can be frozen. It will separate a little but recombines when heated gently. I don't believe that fennel bulb, wine, water or balsamic is used. I have made this version many times. It is time consuming but worth the effort. In the absence of ripe tomatoes canned whole tomatoes will work, after de-seeding under running water and without the can juices.

This is a good recipe, but only if you have better cooking skills than the author. The times for roasting are far off. Roasting garlic so that it is soft enough to squeeze out of the head takes much longer and a higher temperature than the half hour at 350 that the recipe recommends. Ditto roasting the colored peppers. The eggplant will not necessarily be done in a half hour, either. The fennel is a nice touch, but it is not necessary. I made my own adjustments, and it was fine. However, there are far better ways to make ratatouille.

excellent. It took a very long time, especially the garlic, but was well worth it!

Grilling the veggies adds a richness that is amazing. I used apple wood chips to pump up the smoke flavor. The bones of this recipe are strong...due to some ingredient surprises (the red peppers being soft and covered in mold, for example...) I made some winning substitutions. Green peppers and a couple of jalepenos in lieu of red peppers, summer squash instead of zuchini. A heaping tablespoon of sage went into the sauce (grabbed the wrong jar!) used much less salt, and didn't add peppers to the sauce and served over penne. Awesome!

Very good recipe. I must say it is pretty much failproof. The time spent on the sauce and roasting vegetables really makes the flavour in the end worth it. Huge hit with the adults; not really a kids dish. Amazing when sprinkled with parmesan cheese.

I've made this several times and it goes well over rice and pasta. It's time consuming, but worth it.

A wonderful, simple dish that is just perfect for a Good Friday observance of abstinence.

This was really good. It was simple to make, but it's extremely time- consuming. I roasted the vegetables and made the tomato sauce the evening before, then I chopped and simmered everything together right before it was served for lunch. Make sure you peel the peppers when they are still a little warm. Trying to peel a cold roasted pepper is not fun. This is really good over rice, and I think it would be tasty with some plain pasta. It's so flavorful and rich that I can't eat very much of it by itself. Oh, and you can eat it cold on crackers the next day like antipasto. The only change I would make is exchange the eggplant for a yellow squash. The eggplant got too smushy for my tastes. But, overall, a very, very good recipe.

Fantastic, have never really liked ratatouille but was making it for my husband as he loves it. I'm converted.

This recipe was laborious, and for all the effort not the best Ratatouille I've had.

This takes a really long time to make but it's worth it. I couldn't find fennel and it still turned out great.

This was my first time ever eating ratatouille. I must admit that I loved the Pixar movie and that was my true inspiration for wanting to try the dish! I followed the recipe and video almost exactly and it was delicious. I used a canned tomato sauce and it still turned out good. Yes, the garlic definitely needed more time, as noted by other reviewers, but it was worth the wait. That was my first time cooking garlic like that, but I'll certainly be using that method again. Also, the dish tasted even better the next day. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to substitute a different herb for the marjoram. Perhaps bay leaves or parsley. Marjoram just doesn't blend well on my pallet.

This was sublime. So good, in fact, I've made it twice in a week. These simple vegetables' dynamic flavors come alive completely during roasting and oiling. Excellent use for "cook them NOW" ripe sweet peppers, which are always sold at a substantial discount at my market. Thank you for a taste of summer in a winter's delight!

I completely botched this one and it still tasted wonderful. I guess I got overconfident with a successful sauce that I slacked on the vegetables! Watch your vegetables or they will turn to mush, and then the consistency will totally throw off the taste. And ditto on the garlic... it always needs over an hour. I stuck two heads in the oven while I was making the sauce and it turned out right. This went very well with a crusty french bread smeared with one of the garlic heads.

This takes a while to make but is definitely worth it. The garlic needs at least 45 minutes to turn into a paste- I had to keep it in the oven a little longer than everything else.

I made this with his instructions (from the video) exactly and it was excellent. Yesterday I was in a huge rush to get out the door and needed to be able to throw things into the slow cooker instead. So I substituted my own souped up version of a jar of bolognaise and that worked out fine. The original recipe is still better.
