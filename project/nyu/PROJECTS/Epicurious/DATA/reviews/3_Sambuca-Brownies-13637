I've made these brownies often, substituting the Sambuca with other liqueurs, and they have always turned out well.

Ooogie. These did not turn out well at all - consistency was way too runny/light, and I officially do not like the melted butter brownie method. The Sambuca does not work with these at all either. Easy to make, but they turn out unattractive and very bland, with texture that does not smack of a luscious brownie.

I use this recipe often, replacing the sambuca with a coffee flavoured liqueur and the pine nuts with chopped pecans. Always a hit.

This is an adult brownie that got a lot of compliments when I served it. It is cake-like, as described, but it looks and tastes elegant for a brownie.

Not like your typical brownie..interesting and quite yummy. After reading the other reviews, I doubled the Sambuca but still not much anise flavour.

I made these brownies because I had some Sambuca that I needed to use up, but I wouldn't buy it just to make them. They were very moist, but overall I thought the flavor was weak. The anise flavor is not very pronounced, and the brownies are not very chocolatey. The blurb above the recipe says they are very cake-like, which is an accurate description. They were more like a weak chocolate cake than like brownies. If you're having a chocolate craving, don't make these brownies. But if you want a light, subtle chocolate dessert, then you'll probably like it.

This is a fabulous brownie recipe. No longer have the gourmet but knew I had to locate the recipe. A definite for chocolate lovers who like something different

These brownies present beautifully. I cut them in fourths one way, then into eighths the other way. The cuts were perfect. No crumbling. They've been sitting, uncovered, on the kitchen counter for three days now, and are still as moist as they were when I took them out of the oven. The anise flavor was weak. I would add some anise extract the next time. I think this recipe would also work well with Grand Marnier.

This is a very quick recipe that gets rave reviews everytime I make them. I highly recommend them after a light dinner, and with a fresh strawberry on the side.
