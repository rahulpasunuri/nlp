These biscuits are dependable and so easy to make - excellent flavour, and the texture is like a biscuit with a bit of crunch to it. Great with chowder or any soup!

Texture is too dense for biscuits. If you want a cornmeal flavor bread to go with a meal, you are better off with traditional cornbread or corn muffins, than with this biscuit recipe.
