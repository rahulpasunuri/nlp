I made this to go with the Chocolate Cake recipe made with almond flour. I was surprised at how easy it was to make this frosting. And I thought that caramelizing the agave nectar a bit gave it more flavor. In the end, however, I figure i am not a fan of this type of frosting, which is no complaint about the recipe itself. I am sure the texture is perfect for what it is supposed to be, just not something I personally like. Also, half a bottle of agave nectar is an expensive way to make frosting.
