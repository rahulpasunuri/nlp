Brownies laced with fruit yield gooey cakey brownies. Ok to satisfy a craving, but not a recipe I would bake for or share with others. Also lacking basic directions. Next time I will make brownies and top with raspberries after baking.

Dropped my pyrex baking dish as I was getting ready to make this- so improvised and put into greased muffin tins...fingers crossed!

I saw that this was one of the top 10 brownie recipes on this site, so I had to try it. The first thing I noticed was the lack of technical instructions on the recipe. You need eggs at room temp, you need to cool the chocolate before you dump it in. You should beat the eggs/sugar for over 5 minutes until lighter in color. And the most important, you HAVE to add salt to counterbalance the sweet in all baking. I did all the changes and still find that this recipe is not a keeper, even though others with a less discerning palate seemed to enjoy them.

These brownies are not only fabulous, but beautiful as well. I made the recipe exactly as stated, except I baked mine in a 9x13" pan for about 40 minutes. When the raspberries release their juices it makes the most wonderful "gooey" chocolate brownies. What are you waiting for....these are amazing! (and very easy)

I was really confused by my first taste of this, I wasn't sure I liked it. The texture is a bit different, like a cross between cake and truffle. On the second day, I tried it again and have decided that I really do love it. I might like it to be a bit more truffle like actually, I suppose the texture depends a bit on the chocolate you use as they can vary so much in fat and sugar amounts. I used Lindt 85% cocoa, which has great dark taste, but think a chocolate with a little more fat might actually work better. Either way, this is incredibly decadent. I also felt it needed a little more raspberry taste and was glad that I macerated my leftover fruit with sugar and used it as a topping.

And I quote "Can I just tell u that whatever ur plans in life are.... you should drop them and become a pastry/desert/wtv baker/chef because u r FFFing amazing!!! BEST BROWNIES EVERRR OMG." True, they are more cakey than fudgey gooey brownies, but they elicit this kind of reaction. Keeper.

I made these last night and they were incredible! A few things to note: these took nearly and hour to bake and by that time the outside was overdone but the center was perfect with the consistency of a molten lava cake! Not sure how to make it bake consistently throughout but I will definitely make them again.

This recipe is a little wacky. They aren't really brownies, more like a truffly-cake. The flavor is fantastic (I used a raspberry infused dark chocolate in addition to the fresh raspberries). I will try this recipe again, but I am going to reduce the flour and use only two or three eggs to try to get a more chewy consistency. Also, the baking time is crucial. Mine came out slightly over-baked, and it was dry around the edges.

Maybe the best brownies I' ve ever had. Followed the recipe exactly with great success. I made them for a dinner party we were invited and everyone was thrilled. Very easy recipe to follow too. Definitely will make again.

Very good - followed recipe exactly using very ripe just picked raspberries - and baked in a 12 x 8 pan for 32 minutes - looked like too much batter for a 9 x 9. This easy recipe produced a "brownie" just short of 2 inches high. The texture was very cake-like, which was not surprising because of all of the flour. Of course the taste of chocolate and raspberry was superb and the bars looked lovely on the platter.

Terrific recipe . . . a definite keeper. Dark chocolate and rasberries are a perfect pairing. I used a smaller pan than recommended so the baking time had to be greatly increased. Next time, I'll go the other way and use a pan a little larger than suggested.

I've made this recipe half a dozen times already and absolutely adore it. Moist, but no too gooey, though I think I left them in the oven for close to 45minutes.

I don't get it - I've been baking my brownies for over an hour and they're still not done.

These are fantastic brownies. I reduced the butter to one stick, truly wonderful!

this recipe works better, much better, with 100 grams butter. the brownies are tru-ffle like and delicious with less than half the fat

simply *unbelievable* brownies. just like the other reviewer, i put some of the raspberries into the batter itself. the chocolate and raspberry flavors mingling together were absolutely delicious. i don't think i will ever make a different brownie recipe again...

Great brownies!! Very rich, be sure to have some very cold milk on hand. I used frozen rasberries and they worked great. The only thing I changed was I defrosted, then lightly mashed the rasberries and put them into the batter then topped the batter with more berries. It was a great way to cut the richness of all of the chocolate. I will definately be making these again.
