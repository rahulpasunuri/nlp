Wow! This was a hit at the oscars party I attended, they went fast. I think I might add some avocado next time.

Always a pleaser at parties. I've also made full-sized tostadas using these ingredients for dinner.

This is one of the most delicous, successful appetizers ever. I chop up the shrimp, once cooked and serve it in a bowl with the tostados around it for dipping. Absolutely necessary for the 4 fork rating is that I add about 2 or 3 TBL of extra virgin olive oil to it.

I had high hopes for this recipe. It looked great and I was able to some of it the day before. First, the homemade tortilla's were a waste of time. They tasted, as my husband said "like burnt popcorn". It was absolutely bland. All my guests agreed it needed "something". I added extra garlic, salt, jalapeno's and nothing worked. This was alot of work for nothing. If I'm going to spend the money on shrimp, I'll make garlic shrimp next time.
