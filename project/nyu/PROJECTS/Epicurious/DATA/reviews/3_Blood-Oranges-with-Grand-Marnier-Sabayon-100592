I added a bit more sugar to make it palatable for my son; the sweet sabayon was a nice contrast to the sour blood oranges. A very pretty, refreshing dessert.

A relatively healthy dessert that still tastes pretty good.

Ugh - about as bad a dessert as I've ever attempted. Don't bother with this one.

It is a really light dessert, fairly easy to make and nummy! I used it after a heavy cheese dish, and it offset it very well.
