I joined just to rate this recipe. Boy oh boy was this good. I used it on my pulled pork and it got rave reviews. This is definitely going into my recipe repertoire.

An excellent BBQ sauce. Used half the salt, and it was plenty salty. My guests were actually sneaking spoonfuls of the stuff. Will make again (and again) with more heat and less salt.
