Very quick, easy, and attractive side dish. Obviously not complex or even incredibly interesting flavours, but will complement other dishes nicely.

Just had these for dinner with the Chicken Paprikas, what a great combination. My husband and I loved them. The menu also included the Sweet and Sour Cabbage (BA 12/91) - Excellent dinner. This recipe brings egg noodles to a different level of flavor.

I served this disch with the ASIAN PORK TENDERLOIN FALLOM. It was a nice side dish but fairly bland. Maybe a garlic oil instead of butter would have added to the taste.

I served this with Chicken Paprikas, as suggested. Taste-wise I don't really see the point, although it is attractive. Its not really any trouble to make, but I doubt I'll bother to do it again.

I made this dish as a side to Chicken Paprikas (Bon Appetite, Dec '96) and it was a big hit with my guests. The poppy seeds are a nice addition.
