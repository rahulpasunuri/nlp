Oh, what a disappointment!!! This sounded so heavenly. It was all mushy and odd together though. The avocado mash was yummy, the roasted poblanos divine, but together it was a vinegary, soft, flavorless mess. WAY too time consuming for a mediocre result. The spices were totally indiscernable, I mean, I marinated for six hours, then 24, and it still tasted like vinegar - not nuanced at all. Also - the avocado filling turned brown after just 2 hours, not appealing.
