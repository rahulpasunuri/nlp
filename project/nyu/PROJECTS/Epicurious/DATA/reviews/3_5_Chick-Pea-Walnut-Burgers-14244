Every now & then I a CRAVE Chickpea Walnut burger...since 1997! Still a favorite.

Really good. Subtle flavor, so add more onion and spices if you like something with a lot of bang. Horseradish maybe. I added more chickpeas so I didn't have the crumbly problem...just experiment around with this and you can get a great consistency.

wow-very mixed reviews!? I thought the burger itself tasted great, but the good taste was lost in the bun...and a bit dry & crumbly. Could have used mayo or CHEESE (YUM), or just go bun-less. I like the idea of adding the cumin, curry and cayenne, but then let's be honest- it isn't the same recipe anymore.

I've been looking for a good veggie burger recipe and I've finally found it!! I didn't find it particularly crumbly like other reviewers. Loved the texture and agree with other reviewers that the walnuts should not be chopped too fine. Had to make a few modifications due to lack of ingredients but can't wait to make again as per the recipe. Here's what I did: I didn't have rosemary, fresh or dried and I noticed that the first person to review this recipe used tumeric, cumin, cayenne pepper and curry powder in place of the rosemary. While that reviewer sauteed the spices in, I just added them in dry in place of the fresh rosemary at that point in the recipe. I made sure to add a generous helping of each spice (moderate on the cayenne)since other reviewers commented that the recipe definitely needed generosity with the rosemary. Instead of a 19 oz. can of chick peas I used a 15 oz can. I made sure not to overprocess the chick peas, onions, spices and garlic. When it was time to add the bread crumbs I threw in a few handfuls of trimmed wheat bread crusts that I save in the freezer when making kid sandwiches for school. I also subbed dry parsely for fresh. Processed this till the bread was just chopped up and incorporated. At this point I moved the mixture to a bowl and it resembled the texture of ground beef mixed up for a meatloaf without the eggs. Then, like the recipe I only used one egg. Didn't have buns so served it on regular old honey wheat bread with crunchy romaine lettuce, onions, mayo, mustard and ketchup. I'm telling you, this was the bomb. It was easy to make and tasted delicious.

Hey that was pretty good! I read all the reviews so I was prepared for it to be a little crumbly, plus I've made these kinds of things before, and well, they are what they are (i.e. not hamburgers!). I think this would be solved by using pita pockets as a few people mentioned. I however had whole wheat English muffins which were nice in other ways. I followed the recipe pretty much as it was written except for adding a 2nd egg, and breading the patties in white flour before frying. Most important the flavor was very nice, attributable to, I think, the toasted walnuts. I added mayo, tomato and red onion slices. I think that next time I make them I might try even smaller patties.

These were really good. I used a bit more beans than the recipe called for and used two eggs, but the kids loved it! I personally would have preferred them to be a bit more cooked in the middle. Next time I'll make them even smaller.

Every once in a while I get a craving for these burgers which I've been making for years now. mmmGood!

Perfect! These have become one of the staple foods in our household and we are not vegetarians. I usually make twice the recipe and freeze the unused ones for later use. I do let them thaw before cooking though. The walnuts add a nice crunch. We don't buy commercially made veggie burgers any more.

No Forks! This was disgusting. Tasted wierd, would not hold together, threw it all out. Anybody got a Boca coupon?

Loved these. I have been making these for the last 2 years and everyone raves about them. The texture is fantastic. It is important not to puree everything too much if you don't want them mushy and make sure that you keep the walnuts in fairly large pieces. I add a cup of walnuts instead of 3/4 and fry them covered for much longer than the recepie suggests. This way they are cooked through and crispy on the outside. Just add a little mayo to your bun, some tomato and lettuce and you're good to go.

I must confess I changed this recipe quite a bit, due to the mixed reviews. My biggest change was to use raw chickpeas, soaked overnight and then ground. I also left out the breadcrumbs. These changes made the burgers a lot more like falafel, but with a different flavour. I think they also ensured more of a firm, grainy texture than the mushiness sometimes encountered in bean burgers. Even my meat-eating husband liked them and said they reminded him of chicken burgers. I thought they were even better the next day.

Ick. Not a good veggie burger. I made myself eat these, and I froze the rest. They were crumbly when I froze them which was a good enough excuse for me to throw them away.

This burger has become a staple of my diet. These freeze really well, too. I will never buy a box of Boca burgers ever again.

Disgusting! I have been cooking 5-6 dinners a week for 30 years, at least half vegetarian, and this is one of the worst meals I have ever made. I followed the recipe exactly. I made 8 burgers for 4 people , 2 and a half were eaten the rest went into yard waste, what a waste! Texture and taste were very unappealing.

Rating: 2
I like all the parts (ingredients) but the sum of them didn't add up to anything but an interesting side dish on its own, w/o a bun needed. It was not satisfying enough to me to be considered the main stage of the meal. I had some leftover cooked basmati rice and used that instead of the bread crumbs as it was a healthier and, in this case, handier addition. The 'burgers' chilled for over an hour but still were difficult to turn over in the pan w/o breaking up. For me, this was just a nice alternative side dish to less healthier choices of white rice and potatoes and nothing much more.

A good start. Nice texture, but a bit bland, and the rosemary was almost lost. I added shredded carrot for moisture, but--best of all-- served this open-faced for breakfast over a piece of toast with sliced tomotoes and a fried egg on top. Added chopped fresh cilantro, tobasco for kick, and served with garlic jelly on the side. Maybe next time I'll incorporate some chopped jalapeno into the burger mixture and serve with black beans.

These burgers were outstanding. The burgers also freeze well.

These were excellent, and I made exactly as written. I used canned bread crumbs becuase I didn't have the time for homemade and they turned out great. So easy, and much better than store-bought. Even my meat-eater husband, who has never eaten a veggie burger in his life, thought they were good (though I still think he would have preferred a steak). Will definitely become a regular for me.

Have been making these since they first appeared in Gourmet. We're not vegetarians, but sometimes just don't want any meat. These are delicious just as they are. Experiment with different buns: the whole grain varieties are fabulous with these.

Flavor was great. Much better than any veggie burger I have ever had. They didn't hold together very well, but that may have been my fault. Next time I will process them less.

I was skeptical, as many veggie burger recipes are disappointing, but I have to agree with other reviewers. These were very, very tasty. I especially like that they don't fall to pieces when cooked. I loved the nuts, the chickpeas, the parsley and halilujah! I finally found a recipe with rosemary that I actually LIKE!

Rating: 3
Awesome! I browned the burgers quickly on both sides, then put them in the oven at 400 until heated through. Next time I will process the nuts along with the chickpeas, maybe add some carrots. It'll be fun to play with this one, although it is good as written.

I really love these burgers. I made them again today for my son's "playgroup." Tips for perfection - add grated carrot (about 1/2, fine grate) to mixture for moist burgers. Never skimp on the rosemary - I am not a big rosemary fan and 1T usually smells so strong but now I use that and a little more even! I dredge them in flour before chilling them, and lay them on wax paper so they don't stick together or on the plate. Gotta fry them - -they just don't cook up well anyother way. I serve them with Greek cucumber salad (your basic cuke, tomato, parsley, lemon juice, kalamala olive...) and use pitas instead of buns.

This was a great, fast, veggie burger recipe. I loved the flavour that the nuts brought to the taste. I didn't have fresh rosemary or parsley, so subbed dried. I probably use about 1/3 tsp. rosemary, and about a tbs. dried parsley. I also served it in mini pita rounds, rather than on a bun. Loved it, and will definitely make again!

These burgers are very good.Much better than the overpriced veggie burgers at my market.I used pecans instead of wallnuts because I did not have any and worked fine.One thing I will try next is to serve them with tzatziki.

Can't see how these could be considered bland, unless maybe fresh rosemary was substituted with dry? I love these veggie burgers, and they've always been a hit with meat and non-meat eaters alike. They may be a bit dry, but not bad really - nothing a little ketchup or mayo or some other condiment couldn't fix!

Surprised by the rave reviews - found they were really DRY. However, flavour was good (could be a little spicier) so will try adding grated zucchini or carrot next time.

I really wanted to like this one, but it just didn't do it for me. We thought it was very bland - a sort of flavorless falafel. I would have to add other things to this before I would make it again. I'm still wondering how they could be described as amazing?!

Rating: 4
After reading the other rave reviews of these burgers, I tried them for myself (as well as my veggie b.f. and his vegan sister. The verdict: they're amazing! A few notes - if at all possible, use the fresh parsley and especially the rosemary, it'll make all the difference. Also, at times I have substituted crushed saltine crackers (when I couldn't find vegan-friendly bread) to good effect, though they end up being more fragile.

I really love this recipe! As a vegetarian since I was 15, but married to a meat eater, I love to find quick and delicious recipes - this one will definitely become a stand-by. I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I used dried and I didn't have any parsley so I just left it out. Also, when I cooked the burgers, I just used a non-stick pan so I didn't need the oil. I was very impatient when I made these yesterday and I could only bare to let it chill in the fridge for a half hour and they still held together perfectly. I just made one this afternoon for lunch that had been chilling all night and I didn't notice any difference between the two. If anything, the one I made today was more crumbly. I thought these really were fantastic. The walnuts add great texture. I thought they were great plain, just on a bun and also with your standard burger toppings. These are easy, healthy and yummy!

These veggie burgers are great! Sure beats the hockey pucks you get in the frozen food section. The texture and flavor is extremely good. Even my very carniverous husband like them.

This dish was delicious and satisfying! My (non-vegetarian) dinner guests gobbled up their burgers. My husband added avocado slices to his burger -- but then again, he's a big avocado fan.

These are great meatless burgers. Instead of using the spices listed in the recipe, I sauteed the onions and garlic a few minutes then added 1 tsp. each of turmeric, cumin and curry, plus 1/3 tsp. cayenne pepper. Let that cook another minute or so and then added it to the food processor and followed the recipe from there. Very tasty served with plain yogurt.

Every year we have a BBQ for Mother's Day. My brother has recently turned vegitarian, so I need a quick yummy recipe for him. 3 years later, I have to triple the recipe, because every eats them up first! My only thing is that I sub out the onions for scallions. Make these.

Amazing flavor. I would certainly recommend this to anyone wanting to make veggie burgers from scratch. It's easy to make and a pleasure to eat.

Liked it a lot. Ate it as a burger with "Bleu L'Hermite" (a Quebec blue cheese made by monks), slice of tomato and lettuce for a great combination. May include crumbled blue cheese in the patties mix next time.

These burgers are excellent. I didn't serve them on buns. I put them on the plate with vegetarian gravy over them mixed with a little creme fraiche. As a side dish I made rice with almonds, roasted peppers and zucchini. It was one of the best dinners I ever cooked. And it was easy!

I've become wary of veggie burger recipes, since most either fall flat w/ taste or fall apart - literally. These burgers however, not only hold together, but they're delicious. I loved them. As a new vegan, it's nice to find delicious, easy and interesting recipes that actually work.
