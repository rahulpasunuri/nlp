Just so so. The all-time best compote recipe is on this site under "blueberry compote". Substitute for strawberry, and it's even more phenomenal. As to Milwaukee, I have found that the best foods are the simplest.

This is a great recipe for summertime. As to Milwaukee's comment, note that the recipe is from the COOKING CLASS. Not everyone is a gourmet cook!
