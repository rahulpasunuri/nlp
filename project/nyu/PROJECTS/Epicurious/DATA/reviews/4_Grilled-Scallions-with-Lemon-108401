if you get small scallions wrap them in foil, you can also use this recipe for grilling asparagus

Simple and good. You need larger scallions AND they only need to be flash grilled on high.

Simple and easy. I just toss them on the grill a few minutes before the meat finishes.

I did not grill the scallions as descibed but instead grilled them in a vegetable basket. Much easier and just as tasty!
