ok this is the only recipe and sorry I do not know the exact amounts. Cut bacon into small pieces and fry. Drain fat leaving a little take out bacon and saute green onions, green peppers, red peppers, garlic and celery all depending on how much clams or oysters you want. Saute till soft add lemon juice, hot sauce and ketchup saute for a couple of minutes till mixed and add bacon back in. Put seafood into a shell or whatever top with the sauted mixture and top with grated parmessan cheese. Bake at 350 for about 10 minutes or until bubbly. Sorry for the unexact amounts but I have been making this for years for parties and caterings and it is just by the chin. Enjoy

Listen: Clams casino? Where are the breadcrumbs? Here's what I do, to rave reviews: Grate breadcrumbs out of stale good white bread. Add to the breadcrumbs chopped parsley, grated asiago cheese, garlic powder, Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. Put these crumbs aside and address the raw cherrystone clams in their shells. Realizing that you'll likely cut your arteries if you try to open them raw, scrub them with a brush to get the sand off and put them into a 400 oven on a cookie sheet til they pop open. When they are open, take them out immediately and take your chances cutting the clams out of the shells. Reserve the shells and drop the almost raw clams into a bowl with liquor. Cook bacon, allowing half a slice per clam shell, til just short of done. Build clams casino like this, after draining and patting the clams almost dry with paper towel: bacon on the bottom of the shell, then the clam, then add the doctored bread crumbs. Put a very thin slice of butter on the top of each clam (on top of the breadcrumbs). Pop into the preheated 350 oven for 5 minutes, maybe a couple more minutes, just til they are heated through. There you are, you see: Sublime!!!)))How much of this and that? You decide. Enjoy! Finger food!

Very nice, I omitted the vinegar the second time & it wasn't as good. Make it just as is and enjoy.

didnt make this, but since its the only one on the site and doesnt sound very good, here is an alternative from the palm restaurant in denver. 24 clams. 4 pieces bacon in 1 inch pieces. 1 stick soft butter, half a roasted red pepper, 1 stick minced celery, 2 garlic cloves minced, 1 TB minced parsley. steam clams, and cool. mix butter and veg. stuff clams on half shell with butter, top with a piece of bacon. broil. serve with tabasco and lemon wedge. we like this with dry white wine. can make butter a little ahead. i precook the bacon just a little. enjoy!

I made this for guests on Christmas Eve...not too impressive. It definitely needs some jazzing up! I roasted the red and green peppers first and added white wine to the onions and garlic while they cooked. It just didn't do it for us! Unforunately, this is the only Clams Casino recipe on this site!

Lots of prep, but the end result was lackluster in taste.

This is a wonderful way to enjoy little neck clams. The ones we had were only about the size of a quarter. Can't wait to make it again!

We learned a recipe for clams casino from our good friends in Atlantic City, where clams are bountiful. Instead of the parm. cheese we use monterey jack(I prefer the pepper jack) and in lieu of the wine vinegar, try worcestshire. You won't be dissapointed!
