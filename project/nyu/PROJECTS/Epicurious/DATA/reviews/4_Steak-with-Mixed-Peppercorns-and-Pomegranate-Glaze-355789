This was awesome, perfect for a quick weeknight dinner. Used 2 12oz NY strip steaks and served with roasted baby red potatoes. It was just the right amount of glaze. At first, I was hesitant to cook such a nice steak on the stovetop...but they came out incredible with a cast iron skillet! 5-6 mins on each side for the perfect rare.

Had some extra pomegranate juice, a bed filled with arugula, a rosemary plant, and steaks in the freezer, so we gave this a try. Excellent! Serve this with a Shiraz and you have a winner. I also agree with one of the reviewers, you could skip the dressing and just put some of the glaze on the arugula. We did served a baked sweet potato with this as well, with seemed to be a good match for those with a bigger appetite. Quick, easy, delicious, and unusual. Would make a great dinner for a small dinner party or a date night in.

The meat was delicious and we'll definitely make this again. The same thing that happened to a previous reviewer happened to us and the sauce solidified almost immediately when served. We think we may have used to high of a heat...but aren't sure. We'll try it again next time with a bit less sugar and more patience, and maybe reducing the sauce slightly less.

Thanks to the review, I chose the NY strip steak and avoided brown sugar. I followed the recipe and the result was: excellent. My husband who cooks like a chef fell in love with this meal and thanked me many times for cooking this dish. We even took pictures and posted on FB. I would definitely cook this dish again, thank you for sharing this with us.

The steak came out alright--the seasoning was nothing special--but something went wrong with my glaze because as soon as I got it out of the pan, it started to solidify until no longer edible. Perhaps my brown sugar was too hard to begin with or perhaps it cooked a bit too long...I'm not sure, but definitely watch the glaze when you make it to avoid this catastrophe.

I am not usually a red meat lover, but this was so good! I used tenderloin steaks, and was very generous with the pepper.

Really good. Used NY steak, but did not use the sugar. Added 1 minced shallot to the pan before adding the pomegranate juice. Loved the crunchy, spicy mixed peppercorns with the not-too-sweet juice. Surprisingly good combination. Will definitely do this one again!

This was excellent! This was my first time cooking a steak. After reading reviews, I used NY Strip Steak. I cooked the sauce ahead of time just in case something would go wrong, but it turned out great. I dressed the arugula with the oil and balsamic vinegar....next time I would just use plain arugula...I felt that the sweetness of the balsamic blended with the pomegranate juice sweetness therefore didn't taste the different flavors. I will make this recipe again.

because i had it on hand, i used pomegranate molasses in place of the juice and sugar. easy and delicious.

This was excellent. I served it over the arugula rather than next to it. I also made it with NY strip steaks rather than sirloin, just because I think if you're going to eat steak, it's depressing not to spring for the good stuff. I will say that I got impatient with the sauce and probably didn't reduce it long enough and I wish I had! The flavors needed to be just a little more concentrated, so don't take the reduction off the stove till it's nice and syrupy.

I have made this recipe several times and it is perfect every time. I always have a good amount of sauce so i sprinkle it on my arugula instead of the olive oil and vinegar.

So good! I got rave reviews and will defintely make it again. I used New York strip steaks instead of sirloin.

I'm not much of a beef eater so I was a little apprehensive. Surprisingly good. The pomegranate glaze was something very new (never eaten a pomegranate or had pomegranate juice before), but it worked perfectly. The light Arugala was just the right level of bitterness to balance out the sweetness of the glaze.

Loved it. Probably used too much pepper (the recipe doesn't list quantity) so it was really hot but yummy.

Amazing! My boyfriend comes from a butcher's family -- they eat A LOT of beef & this was a new twist for them. His 3 year old daughter even loved it! This has been added to my regular recipe stash!

Fast, easy, delicious! I made it once with top sirloin and once with ny strip steak; excellent both times. The reduction is also yummy as a salad dressing--I made some extra with a bit less sugar, and didn't let it reduce as much.

At first I was a little iffy about putting a pomegranate glaze on steak but once I took my first bite it was DELICIOUS!! I would 100% make this again I love it!

Delicious! The Pomegranate glaze is really great. Served this over a bed of arugula.

I made this for a birthday party and it was Fantastic! Concerned that Sirloin Steak may be tough, I opted for New York. I didn't want to be grilling or pan frying while the guests were waiting, so I pan fried the steaks before they arrived, only cooking them 3-4 minutes per side, letting them rest 20 minutes, then slicing very thin and arranging on a platter. I covered the platter with tin foil, put in the oven at 180 degrees, and served it 40 minutes later. The meat was PERFECT! I added 1 teaspoon of minced fresh rosemary to the sauce, while it was reducing. Immediately before serving, I heated the sauce, removed the meat from the oven, poured the sauce over the meat and it was impressive. I doubled the recipe for 6 people, and they ate every bit of it. This is a MUST-MAKE!

I tried this on my husbands birthday dinner with another new recipie, and he loved it. For once we had no leftovers! Says it makes to serve four, we found that it only really serves three adults. Will eat again.

Fantastic recipe! My husband raved about it and my six-year-old agreed that this is his favorite alternative to steak and red-wine sauce.

Really delicious! I followed the directions exactly, except I served it as a salad with the steak on top of the arugula and then added some pomegranate seeds for taste and color.

Made the recipe as written and thought it was exceptional. Glaze was definitely not too sweet, and it was wonderful paired with the arugula salad and the macaroni and cheese with goat cheese.

I used a venison skirt steak for this recipe. The pomegranate sauce went beautifully with the venison but it did seem a little thin.

I lived dangerously and made this recipe for the first time for a special occasion!! So much fun to make and so easy! I used dry aged steaks instead and a little too much pepper but this meal has a definite WOW factor. I topped the arugula with sliced farm tomatoes and slices of creamy blue cheese and paired it with an excellent Shiraz/Cabernet from Australia. Amazing!

Very nice balance of flavor. We used pork tenderloin instead of the beef for a lower fat alternative. We slightly pounded the tenderloin to the 1 1/2" thickness and cooked it the same way. We reduced the brown sugar by 1 teaspoon. This dish will become a mainstay for the family

Nice combination of the spicy peppercorns with the pomegranate juice. However it was a little too sweet for us. Next time I will lessen the sugar and put a little more balsamic vinegar. But very easy and gourmet tasting!

The sauce is tasty but I would recommend using a better grade steak such as filet or prime rib. Be sure that the steak is not too thich as mine was about 1 1/2" and it was too thick. I would recommend 3/4". I would not use olive oil to cook with as I tried it and it gave off an awful smell so I started over and used vegetable oil.

This recipe was easy, quick and had my husband and I raving! We are not huge meat eaters; however the combo with pepper and pomegranate was excellent and had us wanting more. I would make this again any night of the week that I was tight on time and wanted something special.

So easy and so delicious. I'm not a big red-meat eater and I pretty much licked my plate.
