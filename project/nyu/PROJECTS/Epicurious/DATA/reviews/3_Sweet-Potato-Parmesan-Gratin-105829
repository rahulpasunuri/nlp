This is a delicious dish and great accompaniment to steak. I added ground cayenne. I used canned yams since that's what I had. I therefore cut boiling time down to five mins, first round of baking down to 20 mins then last round of baking w/o foil to 30 mins. Let it sit at least 10-15 mins out of oven before serving. It needs to set. It looks too liquidy when you first take it out of the oven but was perfect 10-15 mins later.

I seriously modified this because it looked bland. I boiled the sliced sweet potatoes in about 4 cups of half-milk, half-broth, to which I added a bunch of sage and a bit of red pepper. I brought the potatoes to a boil and then let them simmer for about 10 minutes; then I used a slotted spoon to remove them from the pot & put them in the baking dish. I layered half the potatoes then added chopped sage, chopped garlic (about 3 cloves), half of a mandolin-sliced red onion, red pepper, and a bunch of parmesan. Then I layered the second half of the sweet potatoes, onion, more garlic, more sage, more parmesan, and finally added a cup of half-and-half. Then I let it bake for about an hour. My version probably tastes nothing like the original recipe, but this was the basis for mine, so I thought I'd review.

This was disgusting. I threw it out without even serving it. Stick to the traditional brown sugar version.

So simple and so delicious! I made this with parmesan pork chops. I would definitely make these potatoes for guests.

This was very tasty and easy - a worthwhile part of Thanksgiving dinner.

This was a simply and wonderful recipe to make. I did find that it had a bit too much liquid at the end, so it needed to be removed from the oven VERY carefully, but it was wonderful. Next time I might reduce the liquid and increase the parmesan cheese... just thinking about this dish makes my mouth water! It was a big hit at out Thanksgiving dinner (Canadian) and I will definitely make it again! YUM!!!

I've already made this recipe three times over the past three years for my company's annual Thanksgiving lunch and my co-workers seek this offering out every year now. I think the recipe is great; I haven't encountered the problems that other cooks here have encountered and in all of my times making it, wouldn't alter a single ingredient. I have altered my preparation -- just so I could use a smaller saucepan. Instead of slicing the yams and then putting them into the saucepan with the broth mixture, I "pammed" my baking dish, sliced the yams into it, and then poured the hot mixture over the yams along with the grated cheese and mixed. Oh -- and for those who said that this recipe wasn't sweet enough, be sure to use red sweet potatoes (yams).

It was good, but we didn't love it. I liked the idea of a savory sweet potato dish, but will continue looking for a better one.

different from marshmellow casserole. The kids and husband thought it was okay.

well - after reading other reviews I decided to add 1 cup of cream to the broth. I also used half sweet potatoes and half yukon gold. It was SO good. I didn't boil the potatoes in the broth, just layered the potatoes and cheese and then poured the broth/cream mixture over all and covered and baked - AWESOME addition to the pepper crusted rib roast

Not bad, but not terribly memorable, either. Though it is nice to see sweet-potatos treated in a more savory fashion than the typical "marshmallows and brown sugar" way, this just felt like it was missing something. It's worth experimenting with, and if you don't have access to fresh rosemary, it would also be good with sage.

This recipe is absolutely incredible. I cut the recipe in half, and the only change I made was to add about a tablespoon of melted unsalted butter. I poured half over the first potato layer and the other half over the top. This was an afterthought (the lack of fat in the recipe worried me, because butter and sweet potatoes are sooo yummy together) --next time I'll just melt the butter in the stock mixture. It added a nice dimension, although I'm sure it would have been delicious without it. Both my fiance and I loved it, and it's relatively low-maintenance. Will make again, often.

This recipe was easy and tasty. It was also a different twist on sweet potatoes instead of the candy-sweet variety of recipes. Everyone in our family loved them.

I made this recipe tonight exactly as written, except I cut the whole recipe in 1/2 and used a 9" glass pie plate. After baking it, I refrigerated it and plan to nuke it on XMAS day to serve with all the other stuff. Tonight these sweet potatoes tasted good, but I bet they will be better after being refrigerated for a couple of days, and then reheated. Also, I think that next time I would replace a bit of the chicken broth with half-and-half to add a bit more sweetness. Overall, a very good recipe. Diane from Alamogordo. Yum, Yum.

Yum! Even my mother-in-law, who gasped that there were no marshmallows on the sweet potatoes, declared it a fine addition to our Thanksgiving meal. The parmesan & broth keep the sweet potatoes from being too sticky-sweet. I've made it twice already.

Ok, so I went the other direction from low fat. I replaced 1/2 cup of the stock with half and half. And it was really good!

A great dish for sweet potato lovers! Easy to make with great flavor combinations. I got rave reviews from all.

I like this recipe because it is a great tasting, healty alternative to the usual potato gratin recipes that call for lots of cream, butter and cheese and the way too sweet, marshmallow topped version. The preparation is incredibly easy and the folks I served it to really liked this dish. In fact, two people asked for the recipe. When I made this recipe I did not butter the baking dish (used Pam instead) and I used no-fat chicken stock. I was also a little pressed for time so I actually allowed the potatoes to cook a bit longer on the stove. This definitely reduced the final baking time to around 15 minutes for a total baking time of 45 minutes. I plan to make this dish year round, not just for holiday dinners.

I really enjoyed the yam/sweet potato taste without the sticky sweet that often accompanies it. This is a new twist on scalloped potatoes that adds a lot of color to the table.

The directions seemed vague. I wasn't sure if it was a total of 45 minutes or 45 minutes longer. The potatoes did turn out tender and the flavor was good. I probably wouldn't make this dish again.

This dish was simple and easy to make, and tasty. However, you must be careful after taking off the foil and putting back in the oven. THe recipe says to cook for another 45 minutes, and when I took it out after 30, the edge of the dish was burnt to a crisp! (probably due to the butter) Was a tad dry, but most people seemed to like it.

I agree with the cook from Seattle, this was fabulous. My family went nuts. They HATE rosemary so I substituted chopped basil and increased the amount to about 2 tablespoonsful. Other than that I made it exactly like the recipe. This is a new family standard.

The way Americans do sweetpotatoes is way too sweet- one does not taste the actual vegetable (whihc has a great taste). I love this version. I would hold the broth and flour and use olive oil and lemon juice instead - lovely flavours.

I have never really appreciated sweet potatoes at a holiday dinner until now! They have always been so SWEET. This recipe was just fabulous and I will definitely make it again.

Totally wrong. The herbs are overpowering for the minute amount of fats included in the recipe. And despite the billing as an alternative to the usual cloying, marshmallow-topped side dish, the recipe really needed at least a touch of sweetness to balance the salty, herby mess. Finally, the sweet potatoes ended up too mealy in texture for the flavors given it. Solution: Do a savory "scalloped sweet potatoes," using the same herbs but instead of butter and broth, layerthe potatoes and then pour half-and-half or cream to cover, and then bake until brown.

This recipe was off in some way. I did not experiment for a solution, so I can only guess what went wrong. I would increase the amount of broth used to saute the sweet potatoes in the beginning, and I would add more to the final dish. This dish was rubbery and tasteless. I was not able to salvage it, but maybe someone else can.
