There really aren't enough forks in the world to award this recipe. We make a lot of blueberry pies in Maine, and I think this is the best one around, largely because of the cornmeal and lemon cream, which I would eat on just about anything. If I were to modify this recipe in any way, it would be to use tapioca flour instead of cornstarch.

I was underwhelmed. Without the lemon cream, it's a pretty standard pie, not as tasty as others. I'm going back to my James Naughton blueberry pie recipe, which has more lemon juice and zest in the filling, and a bit of cinnamon, and flour instead of cornstarch.

This is a great recipe. The cornmeal in the crust gives it a really nice texture. It's my new go-to crust recipe. I added the zest from the lemon to the berries along with the lemon juice. I swapped some of the cornstarch out for tapioca flour because I'm not fond of the taste of cornstarch. Make the lemon cream!

I've got this in the oven now...it's the second one I've made in the last few weeks. I found the crust not too difficult--I just rolled out on floured flexible board, which makes flipping it onto/into pan much easier. Both times I've had a lot of extra dough. I'm using a deep dish pie pan, too. I decreased the corn starch, added just a teensy bit of freshly grated nutmeg. I used some tiny cookie cutters to cut out star shapes on the top crust. Very pretty outcome.

This a wonderful pie. I've made it twice this summer with rave reviews. Make sure you use freshly picked blueberries--the fresher the better. I rolled my crust out on wax paper and it was a little sticky but I re-rolled it out onto a well-floured piece. Great crust to use for other pies also.

I made this pie along with several other desserts for a Mothers Day lunch. This pie was the most popular dessert. I received so many compliments on it and there weren't any leftovers. I skipped the lemon cream and served it with the sweet corn ice cream recipe that's on this site. I will definitely make this again.

I don't even like fruit pies, but my wife and I hurt ourselves eating this thing--it was too good to put down our forks! The cornmeal adds integrity to a crust (thick!) that would otherwise be soggy. The lemon creams bang is needed for both tartness and sweetness, but not too much. Wholesome yet decadent.

I didn't make the lemon cream so I may be shortchanging this recipe. In any case, I thought this pie was fine but not spectacular. The filling came out too jelly like for my taste (due to the high level of cornstarch). But the flavor was ok.

This was pretty much my finest pie experience of all time. The lemon cream was kind of intimidating at first and my mid-twenties kitchen didn't have all the right tools so I improvised a bit. It still came out well, which is a blessing! The crust is awesome and we now use it for all different types of pies - most often wild blackberry since the bushes out back are overflowing at the moment. (Is it okay to eat pie this often? It might not be. But we will do it anyway in the name of consuming natural resources..)

This was my first pie ever. While it was time consuming, probably because I had never made one, it was such a great reward afterward to share it with friends. The cornmeal crust was definitely worth the hassle. I realized how important it was to fridge my dough and roll out when still hard, not room temp. The pie tasted pretty darn incredible but I screwed up on the lemon sauce and forgot to add the lemon juice while cooking and it turned out too thin but still good accompaniment with the pie. I'm definitely making this again! I used fresh blueberries but I don't see any problem with using thawed frozen ones in the future. It probably would be even better since frozen berries are picked at the right time rather than fresh ones that are picked before they're ready to accommodate that shipping to the store time. I also didn't have any issues with the burning of crust that I've read others have had. And one other note, my pie was done prior to the suggested cooking time but then again my oven might need to be calibrated. I pulled it out when the juices were running thick and bubbling through the crust and I'm glad I made that judgement call.

I thought this pie with the lemon cream was exceptional. The cornmenal crust was breaking apart as I put it in the pie pan and I was cursing myself for not using a store bought crust.I patched it together and it worked out fine. The cornmeal crust adds a nice flavor and crunch to the pie and I would recommend using this crust. As another reviewer suggested, I did not bother with the egg white step and I thought the lemon cream tasted fabulous with the blueberries. My pie held together amazingly well even after being cut and it may be because I made sure my berries were dry after I washed them. I love desserts and this is now one of my favorties.

My 8 year old son asked for blueberry pie for his birthday and we all loved the way this recipe turned out. I actually used frozen blueberries, thawed, and based on other reviewers added an extra tablespoon or two of cornstarch. Came out great. I liked the extra crunch in the crust from the cornmeal. The dough was very easy to work with-- maybe because it's got more butter than most of my usual dough recipes-- Very delicious

My husband loves blueberry pie, so I made this as a treat, much to his delight. This is a tasty pie, but my main suggestion is to stick to the recipe exactly - I cut the butter in half to be healthy, but the crust came out a bit chewy. Pair this with the lemon creme, you won't be sorry!

The perfect pie. Great crust, great filling, was beautiful and easy to make. Didn't make the lemon cream but will next time-- it was fabulous alone and with vanilla ice cream, though.

This pie is delicious! For the lemon cream I purchased a very good quality jar of lemon curd, and folded some of it into already whipped heavy cream.The results were fantastic. Everyone loves it and is asking for the recipe.

Wonderful blueberry pie and the lemon cream is the perfect topping. Made one day prior to serving and held well. Definitely a repeat!

Loved this pie, and I don't even like blueberries! The crust was delicious but the best was the lemon cream topping. Followed recipe and had no trouble - will definitely make again.

Awesome pie and really good crust. I didn't make the lemon cream but it was absolutely delicious without it. I brought it to work for a meeting and everyone raved about it. My crust ended up cracking and splitting along the edges and the filling bubbled through there instead of the slits I cut, but it made for a pretty presentation. I will definitely make this again.

YUM! My guests and I all loved it. The crust was special and the lemon curd was amazing! I cut out stars for the top crust. Very festive for the 4th of July! I will certainly make it again!

I did not have time to make the crust, used a refrigerated pie crust and followed the recipe. This is the best I've ever made or eaten. The lemon creme was fabulous!

this pie is incredible! THe crust is amazing, an the pie is not too sweet. I have made it twice: it is better to cook the whole time at 350 so the crust doesn't overcook. Also, the first time I added a few tablespoons of tapioca along with the cornstarch, and it held together much better. I made it for two dinner parties in a row, and will make it for the fourth of july, too.

Pie filling was wonderful but overwelmed by too much crust! I suggest making 1/2 the crust recipe and not doing the top crust on this pie.

This pie came out very runny. I liked the crust and the lemon cream; however, the pie filling was a disappointment. I prefer the Berry-Berry Pie filling to this one.

This pie is okay - a very traditional blueberry pie. The epicurious recipe for the "wild blueberry pie with almond crumble topping" from July 2007 is a MUCH better recipe.

Made this pie for a party this weekend. It was good - a very traditional blueberry pie. However, the "wild blueberry pie with almond crumble topping" on this site from July 2007 is a MUCH better recipe.

Awesome. Don't even think about not making the lemon curd. I made this for my husband for his birthday and he ate the whole thing in a sitting.

I've made this twice already - it's delicious. I didn't do the lemon cream b/c I wanted the focus to be on the blueberries. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was easy + fabulous.

MMMM this was delicious. The cornmeal crust was a nice change and the lemon cream was FANTASTIC and you shouldn't make the recipe without it. What a great combination. Mine was a little runny, I think I let the blueberries stand in their sauce a bit too long. I actually made mine on a Friday, froze it, and Sunday morning, cut the steam vents, brushed with milk & raw sugar and baked it. (I put extra flour in it to offset the runniness but not enough? or as mentioned, the berries sat too long). A Definitely fabulous pie.
