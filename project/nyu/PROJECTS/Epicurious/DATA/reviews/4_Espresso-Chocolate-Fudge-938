I went a little overboard with the marshmallow fluff & thought that's probably why my fudge was a little sticky. So, I put it in the freezer & proceeded to eat it right out of there! Sent some to a friend in Hawaii & it arrived in good condition & he thought I'd purchased it!! Great compliment. I'll be making this again!

I have made this fudge so many times since 1995. It is my all -time favorite, but I love the espresso and intense chocolate. The recipe is easy. The only advise I can give is follow the instructions where it says DO NOT SCRAPE PAN. The stuff on the bottom of the saucepan is grainy.

I thought this was okay. I had to use instant coffee because I have never been able to find instant espresso. It was a good flavor, but be warned, this isn't just a touch of coffee in your chocolate as some might think. Espresso is the first word in the title! I don't think mine came out quite right. I had a big blob of fudge when I "poured" it into the pan. The butter seemed to separate and gather around the edges. But as I let it sit there, the butter reunited with the other ingredients and the fudge became fudge consistency. I actually prefer my fudge grainy and crystallized, and this recipe didn't convert me.

The espresso powder adds a nice aroma and really brings out the chocolate flavor. Use a small offset spatula to smooth the top after pouring it into the pan. I cut mine in smaller pieces because it's so rich (approx 3/4 inch square seemed perfect) and omitted the espresso bean.

I was looking forward to this so much, but both times I made it the results were very average. The fudge was not creamy. It seemed as though the cooking temp was a bit off, so for my third attempt I stopped cooking it at about 230. I then also added a bit more heavy cream & marshmallow creme. These changes made it perfect - smooth & creamy. I realize it may have been my thermometer, though. So, all in all, I do recommend. Very good!

I made this the first time Christmas of 2004 and it was a HUGE hit. It's the first fudge I ever made and it turned out perfectly. I will be making again this year for my Christmas party. NOTE: you need to use a really big pan because it WILL boil over in a regular sized one.

I followed the recipe exactly and for once my fudge didn't fail!! Creamy, rich, decadent fudge is the result! I plan to add this to my candy gift boxes this year.

I love the flavors, & zinfandel or port really bring out the great flavors. This has been added to my christmas cookie list to make annually.

Excellent fudge! I make it at Christmas and give it as gifts.

I tried this recipe and by the third try, it came out perfect. Brush the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush!! I also added the butter after the sugar was dissolved, so the sugar would dissolve more easily, preventing any grainy texture. It is creamy, rich and dark...perfect!

What happened? My fudge never set! Someone please help this beginner fudge maker. I made a double batch for a 9x13 pan (as recommended by one satisfied cook) and when I was boiling the mixture, I couldn't continue to cook it at med-high because it threatened to overflow my pan (and I used a big one!). So, I kept it boiling on med-low for 12 minutes and thought that would do it. Apparently not. The thermometer never got above 218F without threatening to boil over. (Will probably try again- the mixture tasted good on my spoon!) What do I do next time?

Oh Daddy! This is the best fudge I have ever made!! Best I have tasted since my Na-Na used to make it for us back in the 1960's. I did have a problem with the temperature on my candy thermometer rising to 234 degrees, so I tested the mixture for the "soft ball stage", and that was a success. The white chocolate "seized" on me since I used a microwave instead of a double boiler. It wouldn't "drizzle", so I just piped it on. This is indeed a supurb recipe for a basic dark chocolate fudge. I am interested to see add some other ingredients, and also see if it ships well. I recommend this to beginners. Yum!

A great recipe! The fudge is very smooth with a rich chocolatey taste. I also used strong coffee instead of the expresso powder. I couldn't find the expresso powder in the store.

Wonderful, rich and creamy. My husband considers himself an aficionado and he says that this recipe/fudge is several rungs above any other that he has had.

Fantastic fudge recipe! I'm always on the look-out for something new to add to my Christmas gift baskets and this fudge was a BIG hit w/ the recipients. I doubled the recipe without any problems and put it in a 9x13 pan (be sure to line the pan w/ buttered foil w/ the ends hanging over the edge for very easy removal from the pan). The only thing I did different (don't you just cringe when you read those words..)...I did not have marshmallow creme on hand. However 7 oz jar of marshmallow creme= 16 oz marshmallows (from the homemade marshmallow recipe on this site) gently melted w/ 3 1/2 T light corn syrup; I just used the appropriate measurement of creme from that substitution. The espresso powder compliments the chocolate so definitely use the full 2 T called for...it ups the rich-factor. A keeper fudge recipe.

Let me first preface this by saying this was my first time making fudge. I made a double batch because everyone raved about it so much. Well, I didn't realize that the combined ingredients I had to heat over the stove would expand so much and it started flowing over the pan! So I quickly had to transfer pots and basically start over the heating process. That was a pain and I thought I might have ruined the whole thing because it took almost 25 minutes to heat it to 234 degrees! Gladly, it set up in 2 hours just like the recipe said and it is sooooo good! I'm making some more tonight because I'm eating it all and it's supposed to be for Christmas gifts. I did use REALLY strong coffee instead of the instant espresso because I forgot to pick it up at the store. However it was very subtle and my guess is it turned out the same as with the espresso powder. Great first time fudge recipe!

What happened? I followed the recipe, but doubled it, and the fudge won't set. It tastes wonderful, but it's a wonderful sauce. any help?

Very nice recipe. Doubled it with no problem. Perhaps the cook from Essex used evaporated milk by mistake, or maybe the thermometer was not acurate?

I wanted to give this as a gift for our neighbors and doubled the recipe. It was a disaster. Will go back to my tried and true recipe from the Fannie Farmer cookbook. It is very frustrating at Christmas time to have to start over.

My wife and I gave out over 100 boxes of this fudge last year as Xmas gifts. We made two versions (one with nuts and one without), and gave everyone both versions. Everyone raved about it and expressed hope we would do it again this year. We just purchased the ingredients and are going to work! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this fudge last year and offered it with some trepidation to the chef boyfriend of my cousin. He declared it to be the best fudge he had ever eaten! I'll be making this again this year for sure.

I made several batches of this to give as Christmas presents this past year and I am still getting raves about it! Easy, beautiful, & deliciously rich, & not too sweet. I followed the recipe to a tee, & every batch turned out great. People hardly noticed the espresso flavor; it just seemed to give the chocolate more depth.

I made a quadruple batch of this fudge to give to friends and family at Christmas. I received compliments from all that tried it. It was very creamy, not too sweet and looked great with the white chocolate and beans. One small problem - was not able to melt the first batch of white chocolate that I purchased - it just wouldn't happen! Would not recommend using the Ghiardelli white chocolate baking chips. Bought another brand of white chocolate and all was fine! Also substituted instant coffee as was not able to find instant espresso anywhere.

I guess it's a bad idea to substitute instant coffee for instant espresso just because that's all you had in the house. That's what I did, and I didn't find the coffee flavor to be at all subtle, as other reviewers have described it. In fact, it was overpowering. Just a warning -- this might be a point to stick to the recipe on.

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make. I took another reviewers advice and added the orange extract...yummy!

A very easy recipe, however I didn't use instant espresso. I used instant cappuccino and it came out a little on the sweet side. Next time I will definately use a stronger coffee.

This is the best fudge recipe I've ever made - creamy and delicious. It also works well if you substitute either orange or peppermint extract (about 1 1/2 teaspoons)for the espresso powder. I made all three varieties for the holidays, and they all turned out great.

Incredible recipe!! coworkers couldn't believe i made this. they were sure it was some decadent treat bought from a candy store. for those of you who have home espresso machines, i would substitute the 1/2 cup water and the instant espresso powder in the original recipe with a fresh brewed 1/2 cup of espresso. also, if preparing ahead of time, watch out for the espresso bean garnish -it will get soggy and lose its crunch in about a day (if it hasn't already been eaten). when cutting fudge... great tip: use a pizza cutter!!

Fabulous! Perfectly smooth and intensely chocolate. I used 4 oz. of unsweetened chocolate and 3 oz. of Hershey's special dark chocolate (because I was a spaz and forgot to grocery shop before I started) with spectacular results. I can't wait to make this again with Dove dark chocolate. Hoooowahhhh!

I've made this fudge many times over the last few years for special occasions - it's been called "the best fudge of all time" by self titled fudge experts. The coffee flavor really just enhances the chocolate - delicious. And the drizzled white chocolate makes it look very pretty if giving as a gift.

Other recipes come and go, but I've been making this fudge every Christmas since I found the recipe. My family loves it and friends are constantly asking for the recipe. If you're really new to candy making, it's a good idea to read the introduction to the candy section of 'Joy of Cooking'. There is a really good explanation of the various stages of cooked candy (Thread, Soft Ball, Hard Ball etc).

This fudge is really good. The coffee is a nice accompaniment to the chocolate, and there's no need to worry that it will turn off any non-coffee lovers -- it's pretty subtle. I'm a novice at fudge making, but this was fairly easy to make and it tastes great. (It's also very pretty.)

Followed the recipe to the letter, and it turned out great. Everyone loved it -- those who love coffee flavor and those who don't. Very easy.
