This is a classic delicious coffee cake. This is a cake my mother made and having lost the recipe I was delighted to find it here. I feel the need to defend this recipe from those saying the filling sunk, there was too much, the cake collapsed, etc. No it does not seem that there is enough batter as the pan is barely half full, but there is. Yes you must test with a toothpick or knife, do not go by how brown the cake appears or you will underbake. I can't even imagine how you would get the filling to sink in the cake, as the batter is quite dense so they must just have done something completely wrong - started with melted butter rather than room temp? Butter and flour the pan assiduously as complete coverage is key to the well-cooled cake dropping easily and in-tact out of the overturned pan. Can't comment on the 9x13 pan idea as the result in a tube or bundt pan is so easy and beautiful. Dust this lightly with powdered sugar, set it on a paper doily on a glass cake stand and you have old fashioned perfection.

I substituted sour cream with plain greek yogurt... and added some blueberries dusted with flour in the centre with the brown sugar and cinnamon, leaving out the nuts. Fantastic!!

Forgot to mentioned I used a 9x13 pan and baked it 35-40 minutes.

Wonderful easy recipe. But like the many other reviewers, I also cut the sugar by half (1/2c brown sugar & 3/4 reg sugar in the cake mix)I also substituted half the butter with apple sauce. It turned out great both times. My family cannot get enough!

I have been making this for some time and it always gets rave reviews. Make sure the pan is really well floured--I actually have switched to a silicon pan. Make sure the cake is REALLY cool before turning out. The silicon lets me run a thin spatula to make sure all is well. LOVE this recipe.

I was really tired when I made this so I accidentally blended the streusel (i.e. pulverized it) and then blended it into the batter. It was amazing anyway. My only other change was using fage 2% greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I ate chunks of this with large glasses of milk and it was a perfect tea-time cake!

Boy, I made this cake twice this afternoon and both times the lovely crunchy nutty bit sunk to the bottom of the pan (top of the alleged coffee cake, once cooled and inverted). Used both a bundt and tube pan with equally disastrous results. Kudos to those who get the thing to work perfectly for years. Maybe the key is a 9x13 pan? And one hour is too long for a dark pan! Will seek another coffee cake recipe in the future.

I've been making this cake for years, and is always a hit! I make some modifications, I add thinly sliced apples on top of the 1st sugar/nut layer.

I made this in a 9x13 pan, following another reviewer's advice to cut the sugar in the topping by 1/2 and cutting the sugar in the cake down to 1 cup. The sweetness was just right. I also added a couple of tablespoons of butter to make a streusel, as advised, and was glad I chose to sprinkle it only atop the cake and didn't try to swirl it throughout. But there was so little cake! 1-1/2 cups of flour does not really make enough cake to fill a 9x13 pan. The flavor was yummy, though. I can see how a tube or bundt pan would be better because in my experience, sour cream cakes can be pretty heavy. Also, make sure to cream the butter and sugar together for a while so that it really gets fluffy.

This coffee cake is absolutely fabulous! Reduce the brown sugar and the white sugar by 1/4 cup and it is perfect (as mentioned in a couple of the reviews). It is hard to tell when it is done, so make sure that you use a toothpick or fork to test before pulling out of the oven. Also, I used a piece of buttered parchment paper in the bottom of the cake pan which kept the coffee cake from sticking. I would definitely make it again.

I am not sure what some of the reviewers are doing wrong, but this one of the best coffee cakes I ever made/tasted. I have also made it in a 9x13 inch pan, and cooked it for less time (35-40 minutes) and it turned out even better. Simple and very tasty.

This is the worst recipe. the nuts fall to the bottom absolutely awful...will never make again. yuk.

I made a few modifications to this recipe, mostly because the amount of sugar seemed excessive, and I was quite pleased with the end product. I substituted organic, unrefined sugar as it is naturally a bit sweeter and healthier than regular sugar. The following is a list of modifications made: topping: *reduced brown sugar to 1/2 cup *doubled cinnamon *added 1 1/2 tbsp butter to make streusel topping cake: *reduced sugar to 1 cup and used organic, unrefined *substituted 1 c. Greek yogurt for sour cream *added 1/2 c. sliced almonds preparation: *reduced oven temperature to 325 *used 2 small square cake pans instead of bundt pan *sprinkled topping on top of cake instead of swirling it throughout. The cake turned out beautifully; the streusel topping melted through the cake and the cake itself was tender and slightly chewy. It reminded me of the coffee cake my Grandmother used to make.

Ater reading the reviews I decided to try this recipe anyway. I would never make it again. First, to much sugar mixture, as other readers noted. Cake did not rise but instead fell with all the sugar mixture in the middle. Was moist until the third day.

Worked well for me. I, too, ended up with extra sugar and walnut topping mix.

The whole cake was a flop, it appeared done, but when cooled, sunk in on itself and was a giant blob of cinnamon and sugar.

I've been making this coffee cake for many years and it always gets rave reviews. For those of you who seem to be having trouble with the "look", may I recommend lining the tube pan with waxed paper? First grease the bottom of the pan and then put waxed paper, cut to size, on the bottom. It makes the cake come out of the pan easier and provides a slight "gloss" to the top. Easy and good. What more could a person ask for?

Rating: 2
First I have to say that I've made plenty of cakes from scratch, all to great result. But this one kind of bombed. I didn't use all of the sugar mixture, because of previous comments. Even so, the topping kind of sunk in the cake. When I took it our of the pan, part of the topping stuck to the bottom (top) of the pan and the cake looked rough on top as a result. It also seemed a bit overbaked (I did 1 hour as the recipe called for - should have checked 10 minutes earlier) and a bit sticky. All in all, a bit of a disappointment.

Rating: 3
This was moist and delicious. I made it in a 13 x 9 pan (baked for about 30 minutes) and did as another reviewer suggested and reduced the brown and white sugars by 1/4 cup (so I used 3/4 cup and 1 1/4 cups respectively). For icing, I mixed 1 heaping tsp sour cream with about 1 cup confectioner's sugar, added enough water to make the right consistency, and drizzled over cake. YUM.

Rating: 4
This recipe was so good just as is the first time I made it - I ate it morning & night throughout the week and loved it every time I had some. I'm trying it again now and reducing both the brown sugar and granulated sugar as I think both could be cut without taking away from the deliciousness factor, but this is mmm mmm good! Perfect for company or just when you want a delicious treat for yourself!

ok i'm an idiot but is a tube pan like a bundt cake pan? then wouldn't the topping actually be at the bottom? sorry if this is a silly question...

Rating: 3
This was a moist, delicious cake with satisfying, old fashioned flavor--however, I experienced some problems with the recipe as written. First, baking time must be reduced if a dark pan is used. Second, as another reviewer noted, there was way too much crumb topping to cake batter. I had to throw some of it away. I plan to make this again, with some adjustments.

This is a really nice coffee cake. It's important that the eggs be at room temperature, as well as the butter, because your butter/sugar/eggs emulsion will be better and result in a fine cake. I've made this several times, but somehow always have too much of the sugar/walnut topping. I add it anyway, to good results, and no one complains at my house or job.

I've made this cake dozens of times already, and it's always wonderful. I'd like to recommend putting between the two layers, rather than something sweet like chocolate chips or more of the streusel mixture, something moist and sour like sour cherries or sliced fresh plums. Also good is thinly sliced peaches. Incidentally, it might be my oven, but sometimes this cake tends to brown too quickly on top -- I'd suggest covering it with a loose layer of tin foil until you want it to brown.

Rating: 3
Yum. Served this at a morning meeting and got rave reviews from all not on a diet. Will definately make again, but next time I reserve all topping for the top, swirling some there and sprinkling the rest on top. Most of the topping in the middle migrated to the bottom of the dish my first try.

This recipe was just ok. The cake was moist and had a nice flavor, but the topping just didn't do it for me, it was too dry. Next time, I wil use a recipe that includes butter in the topping so it holds together better.

This recipe is an old stand by and a favorite of my husband's. I add raisens to the walnut and brown sugar mixture...make sure they are well coated in sugar so they don't sink! Dried cranberries instead of the raisens and a teaspoon lemon or orange extract in the batter makes for another interesting variation. Yum!

This may have been partly my fault, because I put more than half of the batter into the pan before adding half the filling, but I found that the cake collapsed under the weight of the topping. I ended up serving it in slices, which worked out fine for a church coffee hour. The taste was good, but I'll try a different recipe next time.

This is one of the best coffee cakes we've ever had !!! Just de'lish. I halfed the recipe since there are only two of us - perfect amount...this would be the 3rd morning having for b-fast!

This was the first dessert I ever attempted, and after many years, I keep coming back to it. It has been a great success in many different settings. As a matter of personal preference, I do cut down on the sugar a little - to about 1 1/4 cup sugar and 3/4 cup golden brown sugar. Very, very good!

Great and easy recipe that is quickly becoming a family favorite. However, I halved the brown sugar mixture as 1 cup is just too much and I swirl it into the mixture in the middle and on top.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe. It was easy to make and tasted great. Moreover, it was moist, a cronic problem with most coffee cakes. I did use the suggestion of the other reviewer to bake it in a spring form pan. Great idea!! Looked good. I might dust it with LIGHTLY with some powered sugar next time, for appearences only.

I have been baking a version of this coffee cake recipe for many years. To solve the ugly cake problem be sure to use a highly decorated bundt cake pan. I have also put a small amount of glaze or fresh organic nasturtiums on the side for decoration. My husband who does not like overly sweet cakes loves this recipe!

Rating: 2
I thought this recipe was just OK. The brown sugar mixture seemed like a lot so I didn't end up using it all but wish I had. The cake itself wasn't so sweet and I think the extra sugar would have made a difference. The recipe sounds like you leave the second half of the brown sugar mixture on top of the batter, but if I made it again, I would mix it in. I didn't like the taste of the browned miixture on the top. Used a non-stick bundt pan and 45 minutes was plenty.

Rating: 4
Absolutely a great recipe! I used fat free sour cream, reduced fat butter, and used 2 eggs + 2 egg whites to reduce cholesterol and calories. I also chopped the walnuts to almost a powder in a blender to improve the texture and upped the vanilla content to 2 teaspoons. For those reviewers who said it was an ugly cake, bake it in a springform pan and it will look beautiful! I will definitely make this again and again!

This is a great coffee cake recipe, and I liked the sweetness. I used half vanilla yogurt and half sour cream. I think my tube pan might be larger because the cake wasn't as tall as I thought it should have been, and it cooked for less than 45 minutes.

In spite of all the comments about this cake being too sweet, I decided to make it the first time as indicated in the recipe and thought it was perfect! I am especially pleased with how moist it came out. My husband and the people at work all loved it, so I am definitely keeping this recipe. As far as it being a bit difficult to remove from the pan - it is. However my tube pan has a removable bottom which helped a lot. Using a springform bundt pan might also be a good idea.

This was great. I also cut down on the sugar and used light sour cream. The cake was gone in no time. I used Baker's Joy spray so the cake came out beautifully out of the bundt pan. I cant wait to make this again.

According to the previous reviews I decided to cut down on the sugar in the actual cake. So i used only 1 cup. I retained all of the brown sugar mixture. It turned out very good. Still sweet as coffee cakes are, but at least not completely reminescient of a dessert. As for the cooling time, I would recommend letting it cool for much longer before turning it out, as this is a very moist cake. Overall all a winner.

In terms of presentation, I had a very hard time getting the cake out of the pan...it broke apart. However, I sliced it and put it in my fiance's lunch. He loved it and shared it with his co-workers--the cake received RAVES. What I thought turned out to be a disaster ended up a winner!

This was a delicious cake, though I agree with the other cooks that it was too sweet. I cut the brown sugar to 2/3 of a cup, but it was still too sweet. Next time I would cut down on some of the sugar in the cake recipe itself . Also, in the middle of preparing the cake, I discovered that my sour cream had spoiled prematurely. I substituted plain yogurt and it was delicious - and way less fat. I'll do that on purpose when I make this again. One more thing - my cake was done in 45 min. and my oven temp. is accurate. Don't know why, since noone else has mentioned that.

This was a delicious coffee cake. I made it for breakfast on Christmas morning. I used Creme Fraiche instead of sour cream.

This cake is wonderful, but there is a misprint. Instead of 1 Tbls. milk with the powdered sugar, it should read 2 Tbls. 1 is not enough to make it runny enough to be drizzled onto the cake. I left out the currants because no one in my family will eat raisins. It is delicious and very moist.....the perfect church or school functions dessert.
