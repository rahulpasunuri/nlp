This was extremely easy to make. I did make a couple changes - I used veggie broth instead of chicken and used a little more than 1/3 cup lowfat sour cream instead of the whipping cream. The result was very tasty (and a little lower fat) and I added a little cayenne to heighten the spice a bit. I served it with the Cornmeal Biscuits with Cheddar and Chipotle recipe from Bon Appetit (they are awesome!). My husband loved it. And it was so quick!

Solution to flavor problem...do a mash up. Go directly to the Epicurious recipe for Chicken Chile Verde...it's more complicated, and you don't have to follow it exactly, but it gives you some great ideas on seasoning this soup/stew better (cumin, cilantro, chili powder, paprika and cinnamon sticks.) I am basically making that version tonight with canned hominy vs. frozen corn. And I will say it again...home-made stock is the BEST way to go on every soup and stew recipe. Make and freeze in 2 cup increments. Unbelievable difference.

With a little tweaking, this soup is fantastic. I use a little less chicken broth, a little more corn and I puree more of the soup than the recipe calls for. This makes for a thicker, creamier soup. My family loves it and it's always a hit with guests.

Realy good, interesting flavor and oh so easy! Mine turned out plenty thick enough and in the end I added some chopped chicken breast I had left over. Enjoy! KIMBER

This recipe is so easy that I just couldn't help but like it. I first made this about a year ago, I thought I'd make it again, but I never have. So I guess it wasn't as great as I originally thought. It might be good as a last minute thing, but I'm not sure I would feature this soup on any menu of mine.

This recipe needs a LOT of help. It is not a thick chowder when finished, so I thickened it with 2 T of flour, then added a can of creamed corn. I also added a medium, chopped onion sauteed in a little butter. These changes made a delicious chowder which I would make again.
