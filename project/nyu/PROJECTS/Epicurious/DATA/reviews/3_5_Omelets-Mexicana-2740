Makes a great breakfast. Instead of ground beef I used chopped up bacon. Makes it less like an "egg taco".

What can I say but - Yummy! We were looking for a quick dinner to make with leftover ground beef and found this recipe. Even without tweeking the recipe was great! The filler would also be fantasic for tacos!

Healthy and good. Add 2-3 cloves garlic to the onions. Hot salsa works better.

Delicious, easy and quick. I love omelets for a light dinner and it's not all that easy to find interesting omelet recipes. Add 2 or 3 cloves of garlic to the onion for perfection.

This was a quick and easy meal, that left us with alot of leftovers. We ate it for brunch on Sunday and for breakfast the next morning. My boyfriend even made a request for one for dinner the same day. Once you have the meat cooked, you can save it in the fridge and make more the next day...simple, easy, delicious. I added more chili powder and adobo seasoning. I like it hot!

These were great and very easy. I added two cloves of fresh minced garlic with the onions and beef and later added the garlic salt as well. I did not add the sour cream, and it was still very tasty.

A delicious, quick and easy meal. I cut the recipe in half, since I was just feeding my husband and I dinner. It was a satisfying meal. As I cannot make omelets to save my life I scrambled the eggs and when they were almost set I threw in some cheese and the meat mixture and finished cooking the eggs. My husband liked the meal but recommended that I add tabasco next time. I agree with his suggestion, as the meal needed something to round out the spices in the meat. He said the meat mixture tasted like sausage, which leads me to believe that one could make this dish with sausage and have it as a lovely breakfast or brunch.

I gave this recipe a 4 because it tasted great for very little effort. I needed a recipe that could be cooked quickly as I didn't have a lot of time. I didn't use the chili powder as this can be tricky when in a hurry, but used double the amount in Taco seasoning.
