Wow - this cherry balsamic sauce was wonderful! I used dried cherries as cherries aren't in season.

I used 1 1/2 in. loin chops, seared them on both sides then transferred to baking sheet lined with a metal rack. Roast in 400 degree oven until 145 degrees for med rare. Remove from oven and tent while making sauce. I made sauce as directed but used dried cherries that were rehydrated in hot beef broth. I also added 1 T. demiglace to sauce to boast flavor. There is a good recipe for demi on this sight. It can be frozen in small amounts and used to impart great flavor to meat based pan sauces. Worth the effort. I made this for Valentine's Day and my husband said we could not have had a better meal at any restaurant!

This was quite tasty and fairly quick and easy. I used frozen cherries and they took nowhere near as long as the recipe says that they do, i probably had them on the burner for 15 minutes max. I will absolutely make this again!

This dish is surprisingly quick and easy to make- I pre-sliced and pre-minced ingredients the evening before the dinner party, and was able to throw it together in under 20 minutes. I used canned sour cherries packed in water, and the sauce turned out wonderfully! After draining the cherries, I added red food coloring along with the sugar to aid with color. (Canned cherries really do look awful) The sauce is amazing- don't skimp on the mint, as I was tempted to. It doesn't overpower the other flavors, just enhances them. Suitable for the most formal dinner party- looks VERY impressive when plated.

This does not live up to all the raves in my book. I used canned cherries but don't think that's the problem outside of color. Most of us don't have access to fresh sour cherries even in season.

My husband loves this dish because he is a meat guy and I love it because it's also sweet! I actually have used dried cherries each time and really like the taste so I stopped trying to find the other kind. The mint is also a perfect addition. A great recipe for two or entertaining!

Wow, this recipe was wonderful! I live out in the middle of nowhere so specialty foods are hard to come by. I couldn't find fresh sour cherries-- in fact the closest I got was frozen sweet dark cherries, so I substituted that without the sugar. It still tasted great!

I substituted dried black mission figs for the cherries and did not put the sugar and added more broth and vinegar. It was AWESOME

Extremely easy to make even for a novice like myself. Went over very well at our Christmas Eve dinner. My friend loved the sweetness of the sauce so much she would consider using it over ice cream.

This recipe is okay, but nothing to write home about. I give it a solid 'five'.

Quick and easy! Husband loved it. Couldn't find sour pitted cherries so used canned cherry pie filling.Added a tad of splenda and a bit more beef broth.( I bet red wine would go good in this-will have to try it). Broiled the chops. Used drippings in sauce. Left-over sauce went to work with husband. There it was used over Moose Meatloaf! The guys said it was great!

This was so delicious! I had to use canned cherries so the color wasn't as vivid as it might have been, but the taste was fabulous. Yummy combo of sweet and minty, and so easy to prepare. I will definitely make this again, and I can't wait to serve it for a dinner party.

We really enjoyed this dish. It was as beautiful as it was delicious. My wife commented that it tasted like it had chocolate in it. I grilled the lamp chops on the barbecue and made the sauce separate and it all came out great! Be sure to cook the sauce down so that it is not too watery.

I made this recipe for my Gourmet Club. It went over wonderful- and looked fabulous. I made 12 servings total, and was concerned about cooking the chops quick enough so they would still be hot to serve. I ended up using 2 family style George Foreman grills and cooking each round for about 4 1/2 minutes for medium rare. It turned out marvelous! Just make sure to turn them over once so both sides cooked evenly. Also I couldn't find fresh cherries so I had to use the canned tart cherries packed in water which were suggested earlier. The color wasn't as pretty so I added some frozed cherries for a darker red contrast. My husband is not a big lamb fan, and he had seconds. The sauce really makes the dish!

This was really easy and tasted like it must have taken hours. I had to use canned cherries which I think hurt the presentation/color aspect but it was still very very yummy. Can't wait to try it with fresh in the summer.

Really, REALLY good. The only change I made was to grill the chops on my grill pan, rather than saute them. The house smelled great for an hour and the food was excellent.

This was such a wonderful dish. The sauce was SPECTACULAR! My boyfriend even liked it and he doesn't really care for lamb. great presentation too. I did add a little more balsamic vinegar than the recipe called for, I was very pleased with the results.

Really tasty, interesting change-of-pace sauce, pretty presentation. I couldn't find fresh or frozen sour cherries so used canned tart pie cherries packed in water, which worked out fine. I'll try it with fresh or frozen when available but can't believe it'll be that much better.
