First, I need to admit that I will take a can of canned cranberry jelly (shlurped straight from the can with the ridges still showing) any day over whatever fancy-shmancy cranberry sauce one can concoct. That said, I haven't done the canned stuff in years because it's got high fructose corn syrup in it. This recipe was a trilling find for me because now I can make my own jellied cranberry sauce, no HFCS, and next year I may just mold it in a can so I can have the ridges too. Look out. I ended up with twice the amount of liquid (I didn't mind the leftover solids, we have chickens to feed that to, but it might bother some to toss it) and I didn't double the gelatin (or any other ingredient, for that matter)...PERFECT CONSISTENCY. I also didn't have a mold, so I just chilled in in a bowl and scooped it out at the table. Let's remember I'm going for the classy cranberry-sauce-in-a-can vibe. This will always and forever be on my Thanksgiving/Christmas dinner table. Excellent cranberry flavor, perfect sweetness, perfect consistency.

This looks lovely but prefer the taste of a chunkier cranberry sauce.

Not very exciting for the amount of work and cranberries that need to go into it. The pulp from the berries cooked out and mingled with the gelatin to give the sauce kind of an apple-sauce-meets-jello texture that I wasn't too fond of.

Good things about this recipe: 1) It needs to be made ahead, so it's not something you have to worry about on Turkey Day itself. 2) It doesn't taste horrible. Not so hot things about this recipe: 1) The texture is pretty jello-ish, even if the presentation is attractive with the use of a nice copper mold. 2) The unexciting flavor isn't enough to justify giving up the ease of the stuff from a can. I even jazzed it up with the addition of a bit of Grand Marnier. Still nothing to rave about. Too bad! The search for an improved cranberry jelly continues...

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it has been requested again for Christmas! I pressed the cranberries and ended up with about 6 cups of cranberry jelly vs liquid, but that worked out well since we had 2 dinners to attend. The mold was a bit firm, so I will reduce the amount of gelatin by a third and see how that fares. Otherwise it was very good!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner. My husband will never let me buy the stuff in the can again. I used 2 envelopes of gelatin instead of three. I got six cups of thick liquid from the cranberries so I was able to make two molds instead of one. I saved the solids and put them back on the stove, added 1/4 cup brown sugar a little cinnamon, ginger and a few chopped walnuts and so we had two kinds of cranberry on the table. This is a fantastic dish!!!!! I will make this at all future Thanksgivings and Christmases.

I wish I would not have tossed the leftover cranberry solids. The solids tasted much better than the geletin. It was very thick and gooey--way too much geletin. Considering the amount of cranberries the recipe called for, the final output was too little.

Not a hit with my guests. Although the taste was good, we found the consistency too firm (almost like a jello jiggler). I followed the recipe exactly but I'm thinking maybe one envelope of gelatin would have been enough.

Has a slight tartness that cleanses the palate.

An easy recipe. However the amount I yielded with was about 1.5 quarts (before adding the gelatin mixture). It was a thicker and more opaque consistancy than I had expected. I also cut the sugar by 1/2 cup. The taste was great, not tart, nor too sweet. The texture was smooth, kind of creamy and thick. I think I ended up with a mass amount because I was pushing/forcing the juices throught the sieve. I didn't have time to wait for it too drip through.
