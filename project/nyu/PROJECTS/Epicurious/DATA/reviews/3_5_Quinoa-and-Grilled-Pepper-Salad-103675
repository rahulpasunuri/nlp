I love bulgur and cous cous, but quinoa is a very interesting variation. This salad is simple, very flavorful, colorful and for summer, a perfect side for cold curried chicken. I live in Germany -- quinoa here needs a quick boil (less than a minute), a drain and a return to cooking, precisely as one would rice. A couple of suggestions: No grill? Roast the vegetables in the oven with a few garlic cloves and olive oil. Up the lime juice. Throw in a little cayenne pepper powder. Really a fine salad.

LOVE this recipe! It was very quick and easy. I brought it for a dinner party and everyone had seconds! I doubled the recipe and still only put 4 large orange andyellow peppers in it. We grilled it and they were so sweet and lovely. The only things I did differently were that I used red quinoa, I did not rince it at all and we squeezed 1 fresh lime per a single recipe (thus I used two fresh limes since I doubled it). Everyone loved it and people that love soy, loved the soy taste. Those that love cumin, loved the cumin taste. I had to add quite a bit of salt even though we used regular soy and boiled the quinoa in chicken bouillon. I also added quite a bit of pepper. I will definitely make this again.

After reading the reviews of this recipe, I read other methods of preparing quinoa. Finally I just used the directions on the package! It worked out just fine. The elaborate instructions for cooking quinoa that are included in this recipe would work for quinoa that has not had the saponin residue removed. However, the organic brand I bought at Wh**l F**ds stated that the residue had been removed. The directions said to rinse the quinoa once in cold water, drain, and then add to boiling water. Cover and immediately reduce the heat to low, just like rice. Cook 12 minutes. Remove from burner and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Spread on a cookie sheet to cool and fluff with a fork. Use in any recipe. This is quick, easy and works every time.

Very delicious, but I agree that this is missing something. I added more high quality e.v. olive oil, some lemon juice, and more salt. Also, you gain nothing by grilling the peppers. There is no smoky quality, so unless you are grilling anyway, just broil or roast your peppers to soften them up before adding. I used black quinoa from Christina's in Inman Square, Cambridge, MA, so it might taste different with a different quinoa.

This is a great recipe. I agree that the wet ingredients should be increased. Regarding the cooking method, I have made quinoa like rice and also by the method described in this recipe. Cooking it like rice works okay, but this method makes the quinoa lighter and fluffier, which is particularly important in a salad recipe.

I am about to make this recipe; it looks great, and I appreciate all the helpful reviews. However, most recipes provide tne NUMBER OF SERVINGS and this does not. Can we add that information? Thanks.

I agree with increasing the wet ingredients and adding more salt. I also did not cook the quinoa this burdensome manner. I simply rinsed it and cooked it like rice. I also added some fresh roasted poblano peppers. Fantastic result. Definitely will make again. I rated it a 3 due to my changes and the compicated quinoa cooking instructions.

I also cook quinoa like rice. Roasted and peeled peppers. Took advise and doubled the wet dressing ingredients. Needed more salt. Very delicious.

Great recipe. I added more lime juice for extra zing.

This is a wonderful salad, but I would add that if you do not like cilantro, you can easily substitute flat-leaf parsley and it tastes very good as well.

So laborious a task they have devised for cooking quinoa. There is no need for it. Rinse it well with water, do about 1 and a half cups quinoa to 2 waters and cook it like you do rice. Cripes! We have a lot of quinoa in my house because it is EASY, nutritious and versatile... not a job like this recipe. You can add any grilled or sauteed veggies to quinoa and it will always provide an interesting, textural backdrop. So 1 fork for the stupidity in process, 3 for taste.

This salad was great! In addition to following everyone else's comments about increasing the wet ingredients for the dressing, I also roasted and peeled the peppers rather than grilling them. Next time I am using red peppers--it'll look better.

This was absolutely delicious. i put in 1 Tablesoon of each of the wet ingredients instead of the amount listed and it worked great. i grilled the peppers on the barbeque which was very easy. definitely try this recipe!

This recipe makes for a healthy snack or meal that can be eaten any time of the day, even for breakfast! I add some red & green peppers too for even more colour sensation. I lost this recipe in a move & panicked until I found it here again. Whew!

I, too, added additional liquid ingredients to the dressing. The flavor was good, but I thought the cumin overpowered the dish. I liked the addition of the peppers.

My whole family loves this recipe. I double the dressing, and it's perfect.

I make this and other quinoa recipes often and wonder what all the fussy business about rinsing, steaming and so on is about. I cook the quinoa in stock, adding bit at a time (like with risotto)as the grain takes it up. It can even be done in the microwave to avoid any possibility of burning the bottom of the pan. And - I DO add more seasoning than this recipe gives, like other reviewers. I would urge people to persevere with quinoa - it is so amazingly good for you! (And it REALLY can taste nice...)

Pretty okay... I just made it tonight, and I have to agree with the portions - I stuck to the recipe and I think there definitely could have been more of the dressing. But it's a keeper and my husband really liked it. I put it over a mesculin salad and it worked well.

I've been looking for a good quinoa recipe since it's so healthy. This is the first I've tried and I'll definitely make it again. I used tablespoons instead of teaspoons like the reviewer before me suggested and it turned out great.

Actually this is a GREAT recipe *IF* you make the dressing correctly! I think the recipe as printed MUST be wrong. My version of the dressing (thanks for the tip Dad!) substitutes TABLESPOON for TEASPOON for all the liquid ingredients listed--olive oil, lime juice, soy sauce. The relative proportions are correct and the dry ingredients are correct. To add a little spice to this dish, drizzle a little chili oil on top!

I made this for a dinner party and unlike the last review everyone really liked this recipe. I was going to substitute couscous for the quinoa if it didn't turn out but it was light and fluffy just like the recipe said. Couscous is generally dry - this was not. I did an extra 1/2 recipe of the dressing, used additional scallions and cilantro. Next time I may add addional peppers.

I've been wanting to try a recipe for quinoa for a while. However, I was underwhelmed with this one. quinoa did not turn out to be what I would call "fluffy" even though I followed directions for preparation, and dressing amount was scant. I couln't bear to face the leftovers the next day.

I made this recipe but I substituted couscous for the quinoa. It was pretty good, the dressing was very tasty with the peppers, and it went very well with the rest of the meal.
