Good balance of potato and cheese flavor! Make sure to cook on the stove enough to ensure a brown crust.

Fantastic with the addition of fresh chives and a drizzle of truffle oil after removing from the pan. YUM.

Good, easy, and quick potato dish. I added more Parmesan and needed to cook a bit longer in a 425 degree oven.

These are my most favorite potatoes! They are creamy on the inside, crunchy on the outside and so simple to make! One time I added a bit of fresh rosemary... which was also delish!

Very good recipe & it was completed within the time stated. Thanks to all who reviewed this..next time plan to add spring onions as suggested. Used 1/4# more potatoes but with all else, followed the recipe.

Great recipe, easy to prepare & one I'll do many times.Added 1/4# potatoes & next time I'll add spring onions. I, rarely, prepare a receipe which is completed in the time stated but did with this one! Thanks to all who reviewed this; very helpful.

Nice alternative to fat-laden fries! Crispy on the outside. Made as is and it was yummy. Made it in 9-inch non-stick oven-safe pan and used 3 large potatoes (sliced thinly with mandolin). Flipped it over with ease. Make sure potatoes are cooked! I kept on pressing down during baking every few minutes. Served it with sirloin steaks. One could easily add herbs/seasonings/various cheeses and jazz it up to their taste.

Wonderful, wonderful. Husband wanted it twice in one week, Friends we made it for the first time a week ago have also made it again for themselves. And so easy!

Simple in preparation, and lovely in presentation. Enjoyed by all! Served four exactly as written and made a perfect side dish to our marinaded flank steak.

I too used a combination of yukon gold and red potatoes; left skins on. Doubled the butter and cheese (if not more cheese) and added fresh minced chives between the layers and added shredded parmesan to top. Did not turn it out on a board, but served directly from a presentation skillet.

Great flavor. My skillet was too big and that made a thinner product, which made it difficult to keep in wedges. For a nicer presentation, I would use a springform pan in the future. Carmalized onions or scallions would be a nice addition. Great alternative to scalloped potatoes.

This was terrific! We served it with beef tenderloin and it was a perfect match. I used a combination of Yukon gold, red, and purple spuds which gave it a nice flavor and color (I also left the skins on).

Perfect accompaniment for red meat (blue-cheese crusted filet mignon w/red wine sauce). Nice to present at table. Used a 9-10 inch cake pan (heavy duty) since we had no oven-proof skillets available. Remarkably flavorful without any "special" seasoning -- next time I might play with additions like herbs or whatever sparks the imagination.

YUM! Potatoes Anna without the cream! I've always thought the cream ruined an otherwise perfect dish (I usually use chicken stock anyway!) But these were too too good. However, creature of overkill that I am, I used twice the number of potatoes peeled half of them), cooked it in a 12" cast iron pan, added about 20 minutes to the cooking time and had heaven! And not a crumb leftover!

This is so good and so easy and terriffic leftover. It is so crispy outside and creamy inside. After making it the first time I started adding fresh herbs. First I tried sage and then rosemary. Last time I did both sage and rosemary. I was careful with the rosemary because I only wanted a hint. It was Great!! I used 5 unpeeled yukon golds and the cake was just perfect.

Delicious. Like several reviewers said, it isn't as thick as it looks in the photo, but that's no big deal. This tastes good.

The next time I will add some chopped onion. I had it with Pork Chops and a Salad. The leftover Potatoes will be wonderful for breakfast.

This was easy and yummy. It also seems to be a forgiving recipe. I used unpeeled russet potatoes and shredded parmesan, sliced the potatoes in the cuisinart, cooked them in a twelve inch skillet (used more potatoes and butter mixture) and the family loved it. I also had the feeling you could play around with the recipe even more -- different kinds of cheeses, herbs, garlic, onion -- and still have a great side dish.

GREAT!! I added an egg yolk and some flour to thicken it a bit. Plenty of salt and pepper. It was perfect! Had it with Tilapia

Loved it. As mentioned by an earlier reviewer, this recipe was not as thick as it appeared in photo. Will enhance all ingredients proportionately and try for a thicker cake next time. Yum!

This is a delicious potato recipe and easy to make, especially with a mandoline. I suppose a food processor would work well, also. I did note that mine was nowhere near as thick as the one pictured in Gourmet and I did not really expect it to be with all the pushing down with the spatula. But it certainly tasted great. It's a nice variation on pommes d'Anna with the cheese.

Yum! Simple & delicious. Love the crisp outside.

Excellent and easy, just don't make it in a grill pan or it's too difficult to flip over...
