My friend had made this in the summer and I made it last night for a dinner party. I roasted the tomatoes using Rachel Ray's recipe for roasting and using half the herbs from this recipe. Then I cut up the tomatoes added the lemon juice, the rest of the herbs, and a bit of olive oil. You can make the tomatoes ahead of time and let sit at room temperature. I did not make the cream sauce ahead but I think you can. I served with rice, roasted asparagus, buttered carrots, and cappuccino chocolate chip cheesecake recipe from this site also. Dinner party was a huge success and think you can do everything ahead of time except grilling fish !!

I buy sea bass at Costco when it is available and this sauce was easy and a real treat for a weeknight. I didn't put any oil in the tomatoes and I used a plain little onion instead of a leek.

This was a big miss in our house. A lot of work dicing the tomatoes and mincing the herbs but the tomato mixture was the best part of the recipe. The sauce was, well, cream! with not a lot of flavor. I made this for company and bought almost 2 pounds of sea bass ($20/lb!) for 4 of us. It was not overcooked but it was so dense you needed a knife to cut it. I have never had this experience with sea bass before and wonder if it was the large, thick piece that I got or the grilling. Who knows but I won't be making this again.

I made this last evening and it was wonderful! My husband thought it was better than a restaurant. Needless to say, I'll be making this again! I did grill the tomatoes slightly before cutting and I reduced oil to 1/4 cup. I think I will reduce it again as I thought it was still too much oil.

great recipe, cream sauce was nice, but the tomatoe topping carries the dish combined...each alone would be just "ok".....i let tomatoe sit for an hour then adjusted flavors...more tomatoe, more herb..etc...did not find it "oily"...as was careful to taste along the way....so many possiblities as well with this dish,..recipe lends itself to creativity

Made this recipe with broiled halibut for a non-traditional Thanksgiving dinner and it was wonderful. However, I don't know if I would make the tomato mixture again. The cream sauce was awesome, but the tomatoes almost seemed like overkill. And they were too oily.

Rating: 4
Excellent and Elegant. Time consuming because of the amount of chopping but worth it for a special occassion. It is best with Chilean Sea Bass but other sea bass or halibut can be used. Serve with a crisp Sauvignon Blanc (New Zealand style).

I own a restaurant, and I made this for Valentine's Day. I will make it again for Father's Day this weekend. Beautiful presentation! I suggest using only 1/4 cup of the olive oil. The tomatoes were floating in the oil, and they need not be.

I took the advice of others and used creme fraiche instead of heavy cream and also roasted the tomatoes. This turned out very good. My family and friends loved the combination of the two sauces in the presentation. You can't beat the sea bass flavor, but I would also try with any other white fish next time.

This really was spectacular. I agree that making the sauce prior to serving as opposed to refrigerating would be better. Mine separated a little also.

Rating: 4
I have been making this for years. We love it! I have made it for special guests, ie my husband's boss! It always is a smash hit. The presentation is fabulous as well. I usually make asparagus with it and dribble a bit of the tomatoes over it for a nice presentation and when the herb cream sauce runs over into it, it is delicious as well! I get this requested over and over, even from those who thought they didn't like fish!

I own my restaurant in a small town of North carolina, I prepared this dish thi weekend and the response was incredible. Personally I rate it an A+. The only variation I did was that I grilled my tomatoes and then diced them, giving it a bit of a charcoal flavor.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely wonderful! Restaurant quality, for sure! I would suggest making the sauce just as the fish goes on the grill as apposed to reheating it-mine separated a bit. The tomato mixture and sauce would work well on any fish or grilled chicken.

This is a great recipe...tastes so so good and makes a pretty presentation. Most of it can be made ahead, which makes for great dinner party food. Good sea bass is difficult to find and expensive here in Pittsburgh, but worth it for this recipe.

We had just caught some Sea Bass in Martha's Vineyard and decided to try this recipe. Wow! The combination of cream and a chunky tomato sauce was delightful! It was so fantastic and we will definitely make this again!

Rating: 4
Simple. Amazing! Unexpectedly found a 4-fork recipe. Don't let the simplicity or the common nature of the ingredients fool you into thinking this is something ordinary. OF COURSE the freshest possible ingredients (esp. herbs) will make this dish. The tomato topping would be perfect itself on any other fish or chicken or even bread (bruschetta); I normally don't care for tarragon but loved it here. The herb cream sauce also could be put to many other uses. Our house smelled great and it was so easy and we felt so pleased with ourselves. Even my husband who is not a big fan of tomatoes!!

Rating: 4
Four forks b/c it was excellent, but also b/c you can do so much of it ahead of time (both sauces can sit all afternoon). Don't cut corners on the cream or the fresh herbs -- the cream isn't overpowering, and the herbs are what really makes the dish. I have prepared this several times as it always impresses our guests, and is so easy to get done early!

This is such a good recipe for friends-over-for-dinner. It's quite easy, considering all the "parts". The cream sauce is excellent, so be careful to reserve some for those who want extra on their pasta. They will love it!

Yum. Yum, yum, yum. Came together very easily, easy to do most prep in advance and cook the fish at the last minute. The only thing I would change next time is to leave most of the olive oil out of the tomato relish.

this is easy and gorgeous.... i use tri colored pasta, put the fish in the middle of the plate and surround the fish with the pasta.... cream sauce on the pasta... tomatoes on the fish and when the two sauces meet.... voila......plate lickin' good.... make this for company always!!!

GREAT AND EASY RECIPE. THE CREAM SAUCE WITH THE SEA BASS WAS GREAT JUST BY ITSELF. THE TOMATO/SHALLOTS/HERB MIXTURE WAS AN ADDED BONUS AND WOULD BE GREAT SAUTEED AND PUT OVER ANGELHAIR PASTA!

Rating: 3
A taste of the sauce as it was reducing made me wonder about how the flavors would work together -- they worked great, despite my worries. Our sea bass was thicker, so we grilled it longer. I liked keeping the sauce & tomato mixture separate -- it made for a striking presentation. Made half the fish, and full recipe of everything else. Sauce was gone (good for bread soaking!) and I'll use the tomato mix for bruschetta.

I made this many times when it was first published in 1998 and am so glad to find it online because I want to make it tonight for guests. I've used dried Herb de Provence when I did not have fresh herbs in the past and that was great too.

Like the woman below I screwed up on the cream part.

I'm not quite sure what I was doing wrong, but I didn't have as easy of a time with this recipe as everyone else did. I attempted to make the cream sauce twice, and both times it curdled. Definitely not something you want to serve on an expensive piece of seafood.

I used canned diced tomatoes and used mostly dried herbs, except for the basil. We all enjoyed this dish and would definitely try it with halibut or swordfish. Make this!

Loved the cream sauce; next time I'll try adding the tomatoes directly to cream.

Rating: 3
I like the idea of adding a little tomato to the cream sauce to color it...I think it makes a better presentation. I'm not sure why you couldn't just mix most of the tomato mixture with the sauce before serving, reserving say,1/3 of the tomato for topping for the aesthetic appeal. In any case, FRESH FRESH FRESH herbs are key. I used grape tomatoes since it's the middle of winter in NY and any other tomatoes taste like cardboard. Served with green salad, warm bread and a nice Sauvignon blanc...this was a quick, easy, delightful meal.

Absolutely incredible recipe. I added sun-dried tomatoes to the cream sauce just for fun. Delicious!

I made this with mahi mahi and it tasted great! My boyfriend, who generally doesn't like cream sauces, ate every bite. It's a bit labor-intensive, but I assure you, well worth the effort for any firm white fish. This is a definite keeper - will make again, especially to impress guests!

I made this for a quick dinner and we were absolutely floored by how good it was! I used halibut steaks pan fried in a little olive oil and put the tomato mixture in the pan after the fish was done to heat it up a little. I also left out the tarragon (don't like it). Everything was ready in less than an hour and tasted heavenly!

My husband and I both loved this dish. The only thing I would change is the prep of the sea bass. Next time I will sprinkle the sea bass with salt and pepper and pan fry in olive oil till golden. I am making it for dinner guests this saturday. It is really good!

Learn from my disaster. I always try to "lightn" things up, like using milk or half and half instead of heavy cream. Well - you scientists know that when you add milk to a lemon juice/vinegar mixture you end up with Curdles! So use the real cream! We had to throw the sauce away, but the salsa was really good and is worth repeating.

I have made this dish several times now - usually with mahi mahi - and it is by far my favorite fish recipe. Perfect for company. The fresh herbs and tomatoes complement the tangy cream sauce perfectly! I wouldn't bother with dried herbs, though.

We added horseradish to the cream sauce the second time around! Delicious with Swordfish and Marlin too!

I was not impressed with the results. I thought the sauce was very plain. I love sea bass and order it often in restaurants; however, I did not think this was comparable in quality. Definately use FRESH herbs though.

Rating: 4
I absolutely LOVE this dish! It is very easy to prepare as the sauce and herbed tomatoes can be prepared ahead of time. I made this again the other night and grilled the sea bass in my rotisserie oven and served it over steamed rice, which soaked up the cream sauce beautifully. It came out perfectly! This is 100% luscious! My husband and I both would give it 10 forks if we could!

This dish was killer! Definitely restaurant quality. No guest will eat this without asking for the recipe. I improvised a little. Used Halibut steaks. Left out the tarragon. And included a peeled, diced, seeded plum tomato in the first stage of preparing the cream sauce. The tomato turns the sauce pink and really adds to the eye appeal of the dish when serving it.

I made this with a sea bass I caught myself in upstate NY the day before, and was very impressed with the simplicity and abundance of flavor. It was especially nice a few days later, after the leftover fillet had been marinating in the sauce. I would give this 3 1/2 forks if I could.

All I can say is YUM! My new husband and I hosted our first in-law dinner and needed a no-fail recipe.

The thyme-cream sauce definitely complimented the tomato-herb mixture, but I believe if I were to make this again, I might try creme fraiche instead of heavy cream and add a touch of garlic to the tomato sauce.

i agree with all the other rave reviews. i used chilean sea bass which i love but not convinced my husband on it. needless to say, he is a convert. he loved it! i used land o lakes fat free half in half instead of the heavy cream. i added some cornstarch in water to thicken. i also use rosemary instead of thyme in the cream sauce. i think it is important to use fresh herbs. i had all of them except the thyme, so i used rosemary instead. delicious recipe!!!
