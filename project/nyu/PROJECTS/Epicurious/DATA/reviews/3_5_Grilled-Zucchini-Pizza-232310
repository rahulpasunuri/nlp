This was a great hit during a dinner party. One suggestion - go to Trader Joes and pick up their pre-made pizza dough. The pre-made dough will make this recipe easy to make on the fly! Remember always shop local when you can!

i don't have a gas grill and so i made this recipe on a coal grill. to prevent some of the dough mishaps that other people encountered, after the dough had risen a little in my square pan, i stuck it into a 400 degree oven for a few minutes. i let it cook just enough that it would hold it's shape. it was still raw inside when i put in on the grill just long enough to add some color and flavor to the crust. i then brought it back inside, assembled all of the ingredients and put it back into the oven to melt the cheese and finish cooking the dough. also, i sauteed the zucchini as i didn't have a way to grill it properly, and i added some sliced onions, sundried tomatoes, and a parmesan/romano blend. my company loved it.

This was great! What a wonderful way to use up the zucchini that are taking over my garden. This was the first time I tried grilling pizza dough, and it came out wonderfully - kind of like brick oven. I will definitely make this again.

Haven't made this yet (sounds great though) but I just wanted to make a suggestion to the cooks who had trouble with dough on the grill - use a pizza stone! We use our pizza stone on the grill all the time, even to make frozen pizza. It works perfectly and is actually quicker than conventional baking. I saw recently that Williams-Sonoma sells an expensive pizza stone specifically for grills that has a backsplash and all sorts of useless gizmos. No offense to W-S - love 'em - but save your money and buy a regular pizza stone. Once you've had grilled pizza, you'll never go back to baked!

Fantastic - can't beat the flavors! Used my grill pan (indoors) to first cook the zucchini, then the dough rounds. Takes a bit of time (start to finish ~1.5hrs), but well worth it. Brushed pizza with garlic-evoo, layered mozzarella, oregano, zucchini, and topped with a sprinkle of mozzarella, feta & oregano. Finished in oven to melt the cheese. Perfect!

Made my own dough, otherwise followed the recipe. It's delicious! If you're having problems with sticky dough, dust it with enough flour (or cornmeal) so it will slide off the pizza peel. Remarkably, it doesn't stick to the grill. I have a Weber grill and kept the heat on med-hi, about 450 degrees. Did have to toss under the broiler for 2 minutes to complete melting the cheese.

I know this recipe has potential because the combination of ingredients is very appealing to me. Cooking the dough over an open flame, however, proved far more difficult and troublesome than I was prepared for. The uncooked dough did not come off the baking sheet intact and I had to slap it on the grill in a very odd form. As a result, the texture of the pizza was uneven: too crusty (and undercooked) in some places, and burnt in others. There must be some special sheet or something to cook pizza on a grill.

I really liked this recipe! I used a frozen pizza dough that I thawed and grilled on a gas grill. I cooked the zucchini on a veggie rack on the grill. I think grilling the dough and zucchini really gives the pizza a unique flavor and it wouldn't be as good if not grilled. This pizza was very good and I will definately make again!

I was skeptical here --something sounded wrong, so I had to give it a try. I used Trader Joe's fresh pizza dough and pretty much followed the recipe except I was afraid it would run down between the bars on the grill rack, so I grilled both the zucchini and the dough and then the pizza on a vegetable rack made for the grill. To my surprise, it was pretty good. I think I'd do it again, really pulling the dough out thin, so it gets crisp.

I also used a "canned" pizza crust. I baked the crust per can instructions. I grilled the zucchini, garlic & olive oil until tender, spread the zucchini mixture over the baked crust, sprinkled the cheese, oregano and the 2nd portion of garlic & olive over the cheese. Baked in oven till cheese was melted. I found it yummy and easy on hubby and my tummies due to acid relex. I sprinkled romano on my baked piece since it seemed to lack a kick and the romano added just enough bite. (Salt could be used). It was easy to prepare and would make this again.

Loved this recipe - but again, didn't follow it exactly. Used pillsbury pizza crust - in the oven - and grilled the zucchini in a grill pan. Added some red pepper flakes and served with a side of marinara dipping sauce. Also added some parmesan to the top.

We made this pizza over the weekend. Tasted great! We cheated and baked the pizza crust in the oven. We added sun-dried tomatoe paste because I think the recipe is missing the sauce ?? It turned out to be very tasty - really had that authentic Italian pizza taste. Am making it again tonight.

A reviewer refers to "fresh Basil sauce"...is the recipe missing something???

Followed the recipe exactly and it was so tasty.

Made it on my gas grill and it was quick and easy and it tasted great! Couldn't find the frozen pizza dough so I used a prepared whole wheat pizza dough. The olive oil, garlic, and fresh basil sauce made the recipe. I might try using roasted garlic and perhaps add some sweet onions next time but need to be careful not to overwhelm the rather delicate flavor of the sauce.

Very easy to make. Tasted great. A new take on pizza. It also inspired my daughter to have us make a pepperoni pizza on the grill.

Although I have not made this recipe yet--my zucchini will be ready this weekend--I have found a way to use fresh mozzarella without it getting the pizza wet. Slice it onto paper towels in a single layer, salt lightly and then top with more paper towels. Set something flat on top--like a pan or cookie sheet--and then weight down with a can of tomatoes or such. Gets most of the moisture out so you can enjoy that fresh flavor.
