This recipe is a longtime favorite, but I am reminded that it can taste very SWEET depending on the oranges that are used.

this is a delicate dish with a hint of orange. I maybe will put a little more vermouth next time. disregard calls for cilantro, saffron and other overpowering extras that have nothing to do with the recipe.

I found it a little bit bland. The next time I will add fresh chopped ginger and fresh coriander leaves, chopped. I will serve it over Jasmine rice instead of pasta.

I doubled the recipe except for the orange juice and it came out very nicely. I didn't cover the shrimp, since the sauce is a reduction, didn't see the need.

This is very simple to make, and has a nice, delicate flavor. Maybe a little strong on the orange for me. The boyfriend, after initially scoffing, said it tasted "classy." It was very nice, but I doubt I'd make it again - there are just so many other things I'd like to try.

I couldn't wait to try this after I saw it on TV. When I made it I tossed it with wild mushroom stuffed tortelloni, and it was fantastic!

I made this recipe and served it with over linguine, it was delicious. I have also served it with saffron rice. My guest loved it on both occasions. It is very easy to prepare and the end result is GREAT!

I just started Weight Watchers and was thrilled to find a recipe that fit the program, but was not a diet dish. My husband loved it as well. I did serve the orzo and roasted asparagus, which turned out to be a peerfect accompaniment. Just delicious!

Quick and easy to make. Instead of the veg/pasta side dishes I served the Shrimp Palermo on a bed of fresh arugula (1 bunch per person) that was dressed with fresh OJ, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, a sprinkling of orange zest and a hint of garlic.

The dish has a very pleasant blend of flavors. I prepared the suggested accompaniments (orzo and broccoli) and I think the meal was greater than the sum of its components.
