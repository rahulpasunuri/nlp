I've been making these for years now and my family loves them. I make double the recipe since the kids all want more...as do I!!

I love these and I even used low carb bake mix in place of the flour. We love to have them with shrimp scampi especially since we're not eating bread. It makes a great sustitution for garlic toast and it's actually better.

Have not made these yet, but could not help but remark about the comment from A Cook on 7/30/09, if you look, you can see that Gourmet Mag. printed this recipe in an older issue from 03. Also, A Cook on 8/04/09, not everybody realizes that all CAPS means yelling. Chill out ;)

another way to use these is as a 'frico' .. you can shape the cheese while it's still warm. drape over a small cup or mini cupcake tin for a cup to serve appetizers in, etc.

good but beware your house will reek after cooking these. Parm is notoriously a stinky cheese and this recipe manages to bring it all out! They are divine though :)
