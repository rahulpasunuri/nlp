I'll cook almost anything with cardamon. The sugar topping was great. However the baking times are much too high; watch the browning of the panettone carefully or you'll have dried bread.

My first introduction to Pannetone bread. Just by itself it is delicious. The added ingrdients made it over the top for Christmas Brunch. You will not be disappointed.
