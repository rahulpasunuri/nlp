Well, I'll be the first to review this one. It is clean and light and good. I steamed carrot, turnip, a bunch of green onion, and savoy cabbage for about 15 minutes, then added walnut oil, cider vinegar, dried dill, salt, and pepper to taste. It's kind of watery, in a steamy way, but that makes this dish taste fresh and light. We liked it. We had it as a side to sautéed catfish and enjoyed this as a new way to combine these vegetables, which I might previously have stir-fried, and then they would have been greasy. This was lighter and less caloric, which is good. P.S. We're trying to follow the "paleo" caveman diet, which avoids dairy, hence the use of walnut oil over butter to season. Try walnut oil -- it's great!
