I did caramelized the onions before and precooked the bacon with excellent results, although the bacon shouldn'nt be cooked too much otherwise it burns. For the reviewer who had bad results with cream cheese, I would suggest to use regular cream instead if creme fraiche is unavalaible.

I made this with cream cheese, carmelized onions and partially cooked bacon. i found it bland and not at all noteworthy. I much prefer a basic crust, carmelized onions with herbs, and maybe a few oil cured olives and anchovies. Pissaladiere, i suppose. The cream cheese ruined it.

I used cream cheese instead and it was awesome! I did use my natural gas BBQ and put a pizza stone on it. Grill gets to 700 degrees so it cooks quick and my dough is thin as I roll it out and it is crisp and you can eat a whole pizza! I let my secret out. Try it you will love it!

So easy and so yummy! I followed many of the suggestions (caramelized onions; pre-cooked bacon) and used plain yogurt, drained, instead of creme fraiche. It was a big hit!

Fabulous combination of flavors! I caramelized the onions first to bring out their sweetness (and I prefer them that way, anyway). Next time, I'll use more creme fraiche...can't get enough of it! YUMMY!!

This was good, but upon further trials I have some suggestions...here is what to do: add a little olive oil to the dough, caramelize the onions (I used 3-4 med. onions), use sour cream, and pre-cook the bacon (1/2 package).

How fantastic. I quadrupled the recipe (I live in a co-op), and made half with bacon and half with mushrooms for the vegetarians. Everyone was very, very pleased. Creme fraiche is such a lovely ingredient, and the onions were not too strong at all. Just a word of warning...the dough, since it was so moist, was very difficult to work with. For beginner bread-makers, I would strongly suggest flouring the piece of dough very well, and rolling it between wax paper.

We had loved tart flambe in Alsace, but I hadn't tried making it at home because we don't have a brick bread oven--when I saw this, I had to try it. Not the same, but excellent nonetheless. I used proscuitto instead of bacon, and it worked well. I used the oven for one pan and the outdoor grill for the other, but I liked the oven-baked just as well.

(I use this site a lot to figure out what to cook with a mishmash of stuff in my fridge.) I improvised with this a little and used Indian flatbread as the crust. It was still easy and delicious! I had no idea. I have a load of creme fraiche; will definitely make tomorrow night.

Fabulous!!!! We baked it on a pizza stone to get the crisp, thin crust as served in Germany. This brought back wonderful memories. Thank you!!!

A local pizza restaurant (Bertucci's) used to prepare a pizza like this except they used Prosciutto and caramelize the onions to a crisp brown. Anyway you try it it is delicious and a family favorite
