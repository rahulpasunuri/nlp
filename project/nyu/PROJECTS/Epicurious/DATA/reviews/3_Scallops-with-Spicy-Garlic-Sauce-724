Way too much salt. Remember, sea scallops live in SALT, there is very little reason to add more salt to a scallop unless you are a restaurant trying to sell more drinks. In place of extra salt and pepper, I mixed up 2 tbs of honey, crushed red pepper, and a touch of ginger. I used 1/8 cup of soy sauce, no sake, and no hon-dashi and the meal was PERFECT. If you need that much salt, YOU have no palette. I do not advocate shooting yourself in the face however - there are other meals.

I have to say, I loved this. I didn't use the dashi (didn't want to make the special trip), and opted for low sodium soy sauce. I've never seen my significant other inhale a meal quite so quickly. I'll be making this one again.

I know I'm risking being shot in the face by spence1 from NYC I'm sorry I have to agree with those who said it was too salty. I love Japanese food and I'm always looking for a new way to do scallops so I wanted to like it. I didn't use salted butter and I didn't salt the scallops before I sautéed them. I think the dish could be good using a low sodium soy sauce.

I thought that this recipe was delicious! Per previous suggestions, I also omitted the soy sauce. I also substituted the sake and hon-dashi for white wine--I have it around the house and eliminates the need to make a special trip to the asian market to make this. Overall, this is a tasty dish!

This recipe was really good, however, I did not add the dashi, I added extra sake and some water..no salt to the scallops and some sugar to even out the taste. It was still a lilttle salty but a few changes here and there and it will be perfect.

If jumbo sea scallops are beyond your budget, replace them in this recipe with a pound of bay scallops (less than half the price, same taste) and reduce the cooking time at the end. Delicious and far more economical!

This dish was dynanite. We took some of the suggestions & cut the soy sauce & hon dashi granules in half. We doubled the garlic,Sake, & Shitaki Mushrooms(you can never have too much garlic or mushrooms. Added a couple of snap peas along with the asparagus for a little extra crunch & touch of sweetness. Garnished with a sprinkling of Black Sesame seeds, and served over Japanese Rice. Next time, might try sauteeing the shitakis in the Hondashi broth instead of the butter.

My husband and I love Japanese food and I was eager to try this recipe. I was a little put off by the reviews, but the recipe looked delicious. It did turn out a little too salty. I used unsalted butter and left out the hon-dashi. One suggestion, hon-dashi is a concentrate like chicken boullion and perhaps in the resturant they added a teaspoon of the reconstituted broth. Next time I make this recipe I will make up some hon-dashi and have miso soup on the side and use a teaspoon of the dashi in the dish.

I'm sorry but this is one of the worst recipes ever. If you like very salty food, then you will love it. I used unsalted butter, and less soy sauce knowing what the other reviewers had written. The recipe sounds very good so I wanted to keep an open mind and give it a try. Wow...it was way to salty!! One suggestion...leave out the soy sauce then it might be passable.

DON'T BE PUT OFF BY THE RATING! This recipe is fantastic! I find it sad that this recipe has rated so poorly. It is one of my favorites on this site. And have never found it that salty. It could be two things: (1) people are using salted butter; (2)I always omit the hon dashi because I never have it on hand. I throw the scallops on plain white rice and it's yummy. Whenever I reheat it at work, everyone always comes out of the woodwork to try some.

It needed a generous blob of honey and bit more sake than the receipe calls for. With those additions it turned out fairly well.

This dish turned out horribly. I also used low sodium soy sauce and yet it was very salty. The taste I anticipated was not what I served. Everyone had leftovers on their plates.

The recipe was good. I put in a TBsp of honey to make it less salty and a little sweetness taste. It is much better then.

Although this dish was good, I found it to be very salty. I used low sodium soy sauce and did not add any salt??

Nobu Matsuhisa's food has always been special. In this recipe the delicate taste of the scallops has not been drowned by the spice. In fact it has added an extra dimension to the flavour. Way to go Nobu!
