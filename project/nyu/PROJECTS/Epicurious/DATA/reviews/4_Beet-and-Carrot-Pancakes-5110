this is delicious. squeeze out the excess moisture in cheese cloth before mixing in the eggs/flour. form into patties and fry in a smaller amount of oil. i served with greek yogurt and poached eggs.

We would definitely make this again. It is pretty simple and the kids loved it.

These were delicious... I subbed bread crumbs for the flour and topped with herbed feta and sriracha for a wonderful dish. Next time I would add more herbs.

These were so yummy! I multiplied this recipe by 4 and thought I would freeze some........they didn't make it to the freezer! I am making more tonight.

I am a card carrying beet hater but this is great recipe. I get so many beets from my CSA I had to do something. Followed the recipe exactly with the addion of a teaspoon of freshly ground, toasted fennel seed. Great with roast chicken.

This was easy and tasted great! Bought some beets at the farmers market, but roasting was not an option since it was a 100 degrees here. Doubled the recipe to get 10 big pancakes. Used half the onions, and kept everything else the same. Squeezing out the liquid from the measuring cup right before you put them in the pan helps keep them together. I also cooked them 5-6 minutes each side for extra crunch.

Pleasantly surprised by this dish. I made this dish twice, with less onions the second time and it tasted better, could taste more the beets and carrots. Also cooked it on med-high on both sides to give it a nice crunch before turning the heat down lower to cook the inside.

I too doubled this recipe and really really enjoyed it. I do agree though that shredder blade on food processor is key. We didn't even feel it needed sour cream, or garlic, or ginger (sig o lacto intolerant). It reminded me a bit of those turnip cakes you can get at dim sum, so next time I'll consider mixing in some ground pork into it and serving as main course. This time we ate it accompanied with sage turkey sausage and garlic bread.

What a surprising recipe! Appeals to everybody -- the beet skeptics, the kids, the fast cook, what more could you ask for? I shredded the beets & carrots in the food processor to contain the beet "ink". Taking other suggestions, I doubled the recipe (a lot of beets from my CSA), which happily served FOUR, not eight. We all thought the delicious flavor was exceptional with the sour cream, so we recommend it! Served it with a light pasta dish for a vegetarian meal, but could easily go alongside grilled meats. A new keeper for us!

Awesome! Great use for CSA Beets AND Carrots, and used leeks as well! Next time gonna try some ginger or garlic.... as mentioned by others.

Rating: 4
Great flavour...slightly sweet, nicely seasoned. Very easy to make. However, it does not make 8 servings! The print recipe says "8 pancakes" but I found that at 1/3 c. each it made 6. Good enough to serve two as a side or as breakfast with eggs.

Like everyone else, add me to the list: I LOVED THIS. Easy, healthy, and surprisingly delicious with such minimal ingredients. I took the advice of others and added a garlic clove, and I added dill to the sour cream. Mmm Mmm Mmm. Can't wait to make it again!

These were AMAZING. I love it when a very simple dish is so flavorful! And inexpensive! And quick (as long as you have a food processor)! I will definitely make these again. I added a dash of rosemary to the "batter" and improvised a yogurt sauce (cilantro, lime, garlic powder, salt and pepper) to use as a garnish. It turned out perfectly.

This recipe is absolutely delicious and so easy to make. It sounds strange at first, but definitely worth at least a try!

Wow. These are great. I made them to pair with salmon and a spinach salad and it was a delicious meal.

These pancakes were amazing, and I'm not a big fan of beets! So easy to make, and you don't have to roast the beets (unlike most beet recipes). Instead of sour cream, I made a dip with soft tofu, dill, lemon and honey (I don't do dairy).

Well I have to agree with fmoore from portland. I mean these didn't sound especially good to me, but it was a whole other story once I cooked these bad boys up. oh boy. goodness gracious. see you saturday evening.

I've joined a veggie delivery service which has all sorts of different vegetables coming to me at once which is inspiring me to look for new and different recipes. I found myself with a bunch of beets & carrots on hand when I came across this recipe. It didn't sound especially good to me, but it had a 4 fork rating, so I thought I would give it a try. I have to say, it is a definite keeper! The pancakes were simple to make & absolutely delicious! Everyone in my household wants them again. I will definitely make these again.

I looooved this. Very easy to make (w/a food processor, that is), very simple, and very delicious. And here I was just looking for a non-offensive way to use up farm-share beets. I roasted my beets first (cut off tops, poured on a little orange juice, covered and baked at 375 for an hour or so, then rubbed skin off cooled beets with a paper towel). Followed the recipe to a "T" other than that, and I can't wait to eat this again! I dare say they were better than potato pancakes, and that's saying a lot in my book.

This was very fast and easy to make. I used golden beets because thats what I had. My Dad never likes beets, no matter how they are prepared, with this he went back for seconds! (okay..I never told him there were beets in these, maybe it was the color that fooled him ;) ) My 2 1/2 year old loved them too.

I made these pancakes using leftovers from 'Beet and Carrot Salad with Ginger Vinaigrette', also from this site, and it was delicious!

This is a creative use of beets and very easy. As soon as I got them in the frying pan, someone came to the door, and I was able to let them sit a little longer than the recipe says without any trouble. I found the end result a tiny bit bland, though, and would try adding ginger next time to give it some kick. I also ended up leaving them in the oven at 300 for about 15 minutes - timing issues with the meat - and they stayed crisp, but the onions had a chance to cook a bit more, which was nice.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. my parents already have big plans for me to make these again for two seperate occasions. i might try using a milder onion next time, as the onion flavor was quite strong. they don't stay together very well when cooking, but it doesn't matter, as long as you are gentle.

Finally a beet recipe for those who are not crazy about beets! These were very tasty and attractive as well -- I added more flour (about 1 to 2 tablespoons more) and a couple cloves of minced garlic. Also, I found it helpful to squeeze out the excess moisture before frying to make the pancakes crisper.

Rating: 4
This recipe was delicious, easy to make, and sure to impress. I added about a half tsp of ground ginger to add a little "asian" flare to complement the seared tuna I served it with. Yum! A couple notes on the recipe: grating the beet is MESSY! don't do it wearing white. Also, I found that using my hands to press the mixture into pancakes worked best, to keep them from falling apart.

Everything a recipe should be: easy to prepare, nutritious and low fat, delicious, colorful, AND used up neatly all the veggies I didn't know what to do with from my CSA share! I'll definitely make again. Served plain without the sour cream since I can't have dairy but were fine on their own. Pair with a green veggie and any meat main dish and you'll have a very pretty plate.

Wow! These are beautiful and flavorful! Much easier, faster, interesting and nutritious than potato latkes. This one will become a family tradition.

I was telling everyone at work that I would be trying this recipe out because my mom had so many beets in her city garden this year and I am so bored with our same old beet salad. Their faces glazed over (sceptics!) but my instincts won out. My husband and mom gave it rave reviews. The pancake appearance is a little strange, reminds me of raw hamburgers, but very worth adding to our "keepers" file.

This was absolutely terrific and looked great served with sliced cold steak and sauteed spinach. Loved it as-is, but I'm looking forward to trying the cumin and garlic additions another poster suggested.

This recipe is easy to prepare, attractive on the plate, and delicious! Small children gobble them down without a second thought, and big people ask for the recipe. A wonderful way to use up all those carrots and beets from the CSA organic farm. Be sure to season well, and don't skimp on the onions.

I didn't have onion on hand so I shredded about half as much young fresh ginger root, added curry powder and whole yellow mustard seeds -- it packs more heat this way and tastes wonderful served with plain yogurt!

Rating: 3
What a great way to eat veggies. I was out of onion, so used 2 cloves garlic instead, and it turned out very tasty. Be warned that the "serving" size is very small. I would estimate 2-3 pancakes/person for a side dish, or 4-6 for an entree.

I love latkes with potatoes, but this is my vegetable pancake of preference from now on! A delicious way to eat beets, crispy and with just a touch of sweetness. And the beets and carrots make them such a stunning colour, too. I call them "Jewel Pancakes".

These things are great! Everything hash browns ought to be. Make sure you use young vegetables, though, or they can be bitter.
