These are SO good. And quick and easy to make. I went with the lesser amount of cayenne and I think I'd increase it a bit next time. The only problem is, I made them for a party two days away and my son and I can't stop eating them. I'll have to run out for more pepitas and make another batch. So much for getting stuff done in advance :)

Really good. I made these for Mexican snacks at church and am having trouble not eating them all myself. I'm going to try this spice mix with all the pecans in my freezer. Will definitely make again.

I make these often. It makes a nice garnish for butternut squash or pumpkin soup; tossed with salad, or they are good just eating out of hand. I am fortunate to live in a place where I can buy Chimayo chile powder so I don't need the cayenne.

I made this on the fly as a hostess gift for a taco party. I expected these might turn out like appetizer spiced nuts, but my result was more like spicy candy. These seeds have great potential for a spicy trail mix.

So totally delicious, and very easy to boot. The only drawback is that they are so good straight out of the oven you may not have enough left to serve later.

Interesting flavor combination. This was good but I prefer the spicy pepitas at FN

I will be making these for Christmas presents this year !!! I brought them over to a friend's house as a Thanksgiving snack and everyone wanted to know what was in them. A Big Hit!!!

Yummy. I added extra cinnamon and used 1 egg's worth of egg product because I don't keep "real" eggs in the house. Worked fine. Definitely stir during baking at least once and then stir after you take them out to release the moisture - they'll be more "toasty" that way. My co-workers request them! Too addictive, and a little high in fat, but "it's a good fat". Right?

Yum. Very Easy.

Made these on the fly last night for a party. They were delish and gone very quickly so grab a handful fast. Buy them in bulk at your grocer to save some money and enjoy! Take out the cayenne and they're really kid friendly.

These came out very tasty, however it was hard to know when to take them out of the oven. The spices make them very dark, so the instructions "bake until golden" was not helpful. I baked them quite a while and they did not look dry, but they were drier, so I took them out. Also, hard to stir! Clumpy, but separated after cooling off.

these are quite tasty, but i think they could be made w/o the egg white. mine are still cooling, and i'm curious to see how sticky they are after they've cooled. i think the sugar/spice mix would have been fine on its own, maybe just a little olive oil or something if the idea of the egg white was for making the sugar/spice mix stick to the seeds.

This is such a hit. Nothing more needs to be said. I swear we get invited just for this recipe.

Excellent! Served with other appetizers before a Mexican themed dinner and they were a big hit. I did increase the salt just a bit -- used 1 tsp kosher salt and that was perfect.

I made this for a fajitas and margaritas party and they went over quite well. They are a welcome alternative to our beloved chips and dips; salty and sweet with good spice. I added more heat, as we like things hot around here. They keep well, too -- I was munching them for a couple of weeks after the party.

This is a great, quick recipe. I've put it out with drinks before dinner, and plan to use for gifts this Christmas.

Excellent recipe! Will definitely try with other nuts like pecans & walnuts. I added these nuts to a salad of mixed greens, blood oranges & goat cheese w/a citrus vinaigrette. Fantastic!

These were excellent, fast and easy. Will make again for sure.

YUM! Made it as is, but a little more cayenne might be god too. The only problem I had was that the recipe says to cook the seeds until they're dry, but they don't really get dry until they're cooling, so mine ended up slightly burnt, but still great!

Very tasty. I also upped the cayenne to 1 t. and thought it came out just right. It has some building and lingering heat with that amount, so if you don't like that effect, stick with the recipe. Also, I used a silicone baking mat instead of cooking spray and that worked great.

These were a huge hit at a Mexican-themed dinner. I agree with other cooks that even 3/4 t. cayenne pepper isn't enough. Next time, I will use at least 1 t. for a little more heat.

These were so good!! I made them to contrast with the usual chips and salsa I served to friends last week. They were extremely tasty with margaritas. I did add a sprinkling od extra fine salt to offset a bit of excessive sweetness. Will make again for mexican themed get togethers.

Good Heavens! Wonderful!! I sit here munching away as I type this. Take care not to let them burn and enjoy this delicious snack!

I didn't have any cayenne pepper in the pantry so substituted chipotle pepper spice blend. Turned out great. Tucked pepitas in a cello bag tied with ribbon as part of a Hostess Gift. Very easy and quick to prepare!

I didn't add enough red pepper so it was a bit sweet, but still good.

These are delicious, easy to make and completely addictive. They can get sticky in humid weather...it helped to keep them in the fridge.

These are terrific...and addicting! The only problem is that they don't always make it to the serving platter...the are devoured the second they are cool!

Oh, my. These pepitas are THE best, whether eaten out of hand or tossed into a salad. Great for gifting if you can keep away from them long enough to get them wrapped...

My friends and I made this recipe as part of a menu for our "Gourmet Club" wine tasting tour in the Willamette Valley. We ate them early in the day before lunch accompanied by champagne -- and couldn't get enough of them! I'm going to make them this year as one of my Thanksgiving Day football game snacks.

These are great! Definitely would make them again. Only downside was they got sticky in all the humidity here.

These are to die for. Only suggestion is to up the cayenne to 3/4 to 1 tsp. for a little more zip. Very mild with 1/2 tsp. They're addictive.

Wonderfully easy and tasty. Different. I used pecans and took them to our family's Thanksgiving gathering. I had planned to sprinkle some on the field green salad, but they quickly vanished and everyone asked for the recipe.
