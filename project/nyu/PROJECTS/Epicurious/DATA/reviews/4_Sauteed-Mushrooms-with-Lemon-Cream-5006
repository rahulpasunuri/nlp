Love this recipe! Make it every year with filet mignon for Christmas dinner. I cut the mushrooms in half and pass it as mushroom gravy. Holds up well when made a day ahead, reheat right before serving. Delicious.

These were good. They were basically the sum of the ingredients-- which, of course, is very nice, but not outrageously good... and some things with butter, crem, mushrooms, and wine are outrageously good.

This has been a staple of our Thanksgiving dinner for about 7 years now, it is an absolutely delicious side dish that is creamy, lemony, and just perfect.

I loved this but I did make some variations. I used half crimini mushrooms and half zucchini. I eliminated the nutmeg and added a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes. I also added a bit of crushed garlic and some diced tomato with the wine. I served this over roasted tilapia and wild rice. It was wonderful.

Delicious! One caveat: Mushrooms really, really cook down. I made 1# for 4 people but more would have been better. Otherwise, I'd also suggest not making this ahead of time. It worked but in my opinion the sauce cooked down too much.

This is a simple recipe with a gourmet taste! Have been making them every Thanksgiving since recipe was first published. Have yet to meet anyone who did not love them. They are rich and addictive, so beware!

We had to cut this recipe into 1/4. That drastically shortened some of the cooking times. It turned out great, however, and we really enjoyed the mushrooms. We did double the lemon (and may triple it next time), but other wise followed the proportions of the recipe.

Even without the parsley and nutmeg, which I did not have, this dish was delicious. The lemon flavor is very complimentry to the mushrooms.

I made this dish for the first time at Thanksgiving 4 years ago. I've been requested to make it every year since. The flavors of the mushrooms with the nutmeg and cream are wonderful. It's a delicious dish for mushroom lovers and a nice change to your everyday side dishes. Not difficult to make and very few ingredients are needed which is always a plus!

This recipe was not a hit with my family. My husband, who normally enjoys anything with lemon, wouldn't eat it. I didn't think it was bad, but wouldn't bother to make it again.
