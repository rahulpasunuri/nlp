This was fabulous - I made it for thanksgiving, and everyone loved it. The flavor of the dried cranberries works really well in this dish, and the ketchup (!) cuts the sweetness perfectly. The only thing I did differently was to add the dried cranberries a minute or two before removing from the heat, to soften them a bit more. Also, I was only able to get "cherry flavored" dried cranberries - was a bit worried about that, but it worked just fine!

I love this. I made mine with Cointreau because it was what I had around. The dried cranberries help with sweetness. I plumped them in some of the liqueur before adding.

I thought this was the best cranberry sauce I had ever tasted last year when I made it, I'm going to be making it again this year.

Very good, simple to prepare, even for a novice cook like me. But nothing exotic about it. If you're looking for something workable, this does the job. Looking for something special, keep looking.

We love cranberries and creme de cassis --but not together. Also we thought that the dried cranberries did not add anything to the sauce.

A wonderful flavor, just the right blend of sweetness and tartness!
