I was reading the reviews and just saw that i already wrote one some years ago. i've played with the recipe and mix dried cranberries with the raisins and after all this time it has become more than a tradition...it's a staple. not sure what i'm doing for the holiday this year, but i'll certainly have a tart no matter what.

I have been making it since it came out in 1993 - for Thanksgiving and for Christmas. I have to make 2 - one for "us" and one for the company. It is easy to prepare the filing and pastry ahead of time, but I like to bake it fairly fresh. I find I have to watch it carefully to take it out of the oven before the bottom gets too dark. This tart is now a family tradition.

I make this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. It's easy delicious and gorgeous but even better the next morning with coffee or tea...delicious!

This was only okay. Tasted like cranberry sauce on pastry. The pastry was good, though.

I'm cheating, printing the recipe instead of pulling the magazine out of the cupboard. This makes a beautiful fall dessert. Adding nuts works well too, I mix them in after cooking the filling, they are crunchier that way.

i first used this recipe when it was "new" to gourmet in 1993 and it was the biggest hit of anything i baked that year (and i was living at an old shaker property then too). i lost the recipe and it took years to find it again. now that it's here i've got many copies all over the place...i'm a cranberry lover and this is one of my all time favorite cranberry recipes. it's differently wonderful, and always gets rave reviews. enjoy.

I didn't care for this dessert--reminded me too much of a fruitcake. However, everyone in my family loved it and, since people on this site love it too, I thought I'd share how I made it beautiful. Instead of making a free-form tart, I used a tart pan. I rolled the dough out to 12", then placed it in a buttered tart pan. I trimmed the overlapping dough, rolled that dough out again, and made tiny cookies using leaf and acorn cutters. I placed about 1/3 of the cookies on top of the filling, then gave the dough the egg bath. I baked the tart as directed, then baked the remaining cookies separately (they only need about 5 minutes, watch carefully). When I served, I placed the tart in the middle of a large glass plate, then scattered the extra cookies, gold raisins, cranberries, and pecans around the tart on the plate. It was gorgeous!!!! A beautiful fall dish.

I have made this for several Thanksgivings in a row. Can't stop because it's requested by many from my mother to cousin from California. Terrific (and easy!)

I've made this dish at holiday time for 3 years running, always to high praise. This year, I doubled the recipe and baked it as a pie rather than a tart. I was worried about the crust, but the recipe worked perfectly! Highly recommended.

My dad makes this with great regularity, and there are rarely leftovers (when there are, they are eaten rapidly, and with great relish!). It is a wonderful dessert, with an incredible butter-cookie like crust, and a wonderful filling.

Sweet yet tart, an added touch was using half of the raisins and subsituting some dried cherries, and adding some cinnamon and nutmeg.
