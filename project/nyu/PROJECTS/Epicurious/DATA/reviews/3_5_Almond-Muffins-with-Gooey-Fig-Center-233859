Really tasty and healthy too. I substituted whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour, and 1 tsp almond extract + a neutral oil instead of almond oil. I also skipped the almonds on top (didn't have any) but didn't miss them. Using a dab of fig butter in place of the fresh figs made it a quick recipe to put together. Next time, I will reduce the salt. These are not very sweet, so the salt was more pronounced than I would have like.

I made these for a potluck, and I love that they're kind of dessert, but you wouldn't feel too guilty eating them with your meal. I used dried figs, and as the first reviewer noted, you have to add warm water as you're pureeing them and a little more while you heat them. The puree is delicious and really sweet. I felt like they needed more like 15-20 min. to bake.

So tasty! I love these. BUT my figs didn't get smooth at all when I processed them--I had to add a lot of water to make into a paste. Do others have trouble with figs being to dry to become a paste? Also, oat flour can also be found in your pantry (not just specialty stores) buy processing oats! Buy oats in bulk and keep in your fridge. YUM.

Even without figgy filling (I ran out of time) these were fluffy and light. The following few changes did not harm my results: I substituted oat flour with finely ground cornmeal, left off the cinnamon, used soy instead of regular milk and finally, drizzled citrusy icing over one half, topped the rest with lemon curd I had around. Huge success with friends and a definite repeater!

I loved these muffins. I made them as the recipe read. It was difficult to give up the joy of fresh figs (difficult to get this time of year), but it is Christmas. I make them again when I can get the fresh figs without paying a premium. I agree with Cook from Las Vegas. Please don't review an altered recipe until you've made the original. If you don't, you're not really reviewing the Epicurious recipe, are you? You're just giving us your recipe. What a slap in the face to the chef or cook that submitted it. I'm sure that's not you're intent.

I used whole wheat flour in with the almond meal, added almond extract as someone else suggested lacking almond oil like them, and instead of figs, put in dried apricots that I soaked in hot water first so they wouldn't be too chewy. I also used buttermilk instead of skim milk because I love what it does for baked goodies. All these tweaks really change the recipe but I enjoyed the moist character of the muffins without adding butter/oil ~ they hold the promise of staying moist for several days, if I can hold off from gobbling them all up that long!

These muffins are amazing. I made them almost precisely with a few minor changes. I used rolled oats whole instead of the flour to give it some added crunch and used fig preserves. I also added a teaspoon of almond extract. Definitely will make these again and try adding some crunchy almond butter!

This is delicious. Light in texture with a subtle hint of almond and spice. I had to bake it for about 20-22 minutes. I didn't have almond oil, so I substituted it with walnut oil. I think with almond oil it might have brought out the almond flavor even more.

Fresh figs are such a precious resource it seems a waste to use them in something like this. And yet when I finally had some figs I didn't want to eat as is (years after I first noted the recipe), I took a chance. I'm glad I did. The muffins are wholesome and decadent at once. In a pinch you could use fig jam. It would be more dessert-y.

I haven't made these yet but I'm on my way up to the kitchen now. I feel compelled to mention to the Chef in Las Vegas that I have always taken the recommendations of others when they try these recipes. If someone varies it and still says their good, why not try it? So what if it's not to the letter? I rarely make ANYTHING to the letter. I'm glad you gave the muffin a good rating. It confirmed I want to try these.

Note to cook from Freeport, NY. Please rate/review fairly the original recipe before giving your substitutions! The chef clearly provided other alternatives. Now, I found these muffins to be perfectly most & delicious w/ the subtle hints of almond & spices! Not your typical muffin. Impress your morning guests w/ these.

When I made these muffins I substituted 1c almonds + 1/2c flour to make the almond flour, 1/2c ground quick oats for oat flour, 1/8c canola oil + almond extract for the almond oil. Overall the fig filling was quite delicious (especially if you have figs that are super sweet and ready to eat) and the texture of the muffin was hearty but not heavy or doughy. Overall, a nice healthy breakfast muffin.
