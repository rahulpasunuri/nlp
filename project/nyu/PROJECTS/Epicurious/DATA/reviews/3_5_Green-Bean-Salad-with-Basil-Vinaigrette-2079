Tremendous. Made the dressing early on and let sit at room temp. About 2 hours before dinner, cooked the beans and let cool slightly before mixing with the dressing. Used red onion and basil from the farmer's market; left out the Romano from the mix but grated it on top of the beans. As other reviewers noted, I didn't use all the dressing, just enough to coat the beans. Made a delicious side dish with a tomato tart and poached chicken tonatto!

I've made this salad on numerous occasions when my garden is overrun with green beans and basil. I rarely measure anything except perhaps the oil and vinegar and I hear rave reviews every time. The taste of summer!

A real disappointment and waste of fresh green beans-- way too much cheese, and bland flavor.

I also used Parmigianno instead of Romano. It was good and so easy as I had some beans from last night.

I'd like to give this one 3.5 forks. I made it first with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese because I didn't have Romano on hand and it was good. Then I made if for a potuck with Romano cheese and it was delish! I, too, heard lots of "who brought the green beans?" during dinner. I had to laugh because when it was time to put the food away after dinner, I saw that someone had helped herself to half of my remaining salad to take home and replaced it with the one she brought!

This recipe tasted great and it was so simple to make!

Wonderful! I cut this in half and used a combo of lemon juice and red wine vinegar. I used less cheese and tossed in pine nuts. Yummy!!

Just finished making this, and YUMMM. I mixed red wine vinegar with Balsamic, as sometimes the Balsamic i a tad intense. I also added more basil, as it was really nice with beans. Next time I might toss in some lemon, and maybe some roasted pine nuts.

This was excellent, although I don't think it really needs as much grated cheese as called for. I expected the basil to be overwhelming, but it wasn't. Great way to use all those beans from the garden.

Delicious & so easy! Great for entertaining.

Very nice recipe and easy to prep ahead of time. I made the dressing in the morning, then steamed the beans that evening and tossed about an hour before serving. I tripled the recipe, so cut back on the shallots (used three large shallots in total, so about 1/2-3/4 cup minced) so the basil wasn't overpowered. I inadvertantly got grated romano instead of shredded, so cut back the amount there too - shredded would look prettier, but grated tasted great. Several people asked for the recipe, so a success overall.

My health conscious guests raved about these beans. I used fresh from the garden beans, prepared them several hours in advance and added the dressing just before serving. Next time, I'll let the dressing sit for a bit longer and let them soak up the flavor. But overall, this recipe was easy and well received. Different, original and healthy.

Loved these beans and so did my guests. The fresh basil and hint of acidity from the vinegar made the bean flavor pop without being overwhelming. I used high quality frozen beans and cooked them as crisp-tender as is possible with frozen beans. They still turned out great. Can't wait to try this recipe with the beans from the garden in a month.

Good recipe but it leaves a very strong aftertaste. I would probably use less shallots next time.

I just looked up the recipe again, 15 years after I first made it. So happy to find it on epicurious as my 1992 Bon Apetit is not to be found at the moment. This salad is wonderful and has garnered rave reviews over the years. I have made it in advance and tossed the cheese in later for great results. A terrific summer staple for BBQ's, picnics or al fresco dining--super yummy! Enjoy.

Have made this several times now, and have experimented a bit with the ingredients. I used red onion instead of shallots, and sauteed a couple of minced cloves of garlic with finely chopped proscuitto. If adding the proscuitto, eliminate salt. I also tried this recipe (with changes I made, omitting basil) with blanched asparagus cut into 1 1/2 pieces. This is also VERY good!! If using asparagus, make the day before for best flavor. This simple recipe has gone into my "favorites" category.

I have reviewed this before but I tried something different that works. I steamed cut-up red potatoes and tossed them with vinaigrette while hot but waited to add the basil until the potatoes were cool so that it wouldn't turn black. Tossed with the cooled and dressed beans, this was even better than with beans alone. Don't skimp on the basil.

Very good - we enjoyed this as a side to grilled pork chops. Sadly, I didn't have fresh basil, which I'm sure would make this recipe better, but even with dried basil, it was terrific & easy.

My family liked this well enough and I thought it was terrific. Heed the advice to add the dressing only enough to coat the beans.

I did not like this at all! I expected to, as it had so many of my favorite ingredients. The basil and shallot was too much together, I guess?

When I called a friend who was organizing a fundraising pitch-in dinner, I volunteered to make whatever no one else would. She gave me the most boring assignment of all for a cook-out - the dreaded green vegetable! Not slaw or pasta salad. She needed beans for 45 people, so I brought this dish. All night I heard "who brought the green beans?" and "How did you make this sauce?" For a simple, homey, blue jeans and T-shirt dish, this is one of the very best. Four forks for best in its class. Don't forget to taste the finished dish - as I did, you may whis to add more balsamic vinegar.

I loved this easy, fresh salad and the blend of ingredients. I made the salad and refrigerated it before serving. Although I let the salad return to room temperature, I don't think the flavor was quite as robust as it was before refrigeration. Next time I won't do that.

Absolutely delicious! And so healthy!

Very, very good. Don't feel like you have to use the exact quantities of basil, olive oil, vinegar, and cheese. Add them to taste. Remember to be generous with the black pepper, too. Inspired by another, warm green bean/basil dish, I toasted a large handful of pine nuts and added them. They really added a nice flavor.

A refreshing and tasty summer salad that's very quick to prepare. I would recommend steaming or microwaving the beans to retain their color. Next time, I think I'll chop the beans into bite-size pieces before cooking them.
