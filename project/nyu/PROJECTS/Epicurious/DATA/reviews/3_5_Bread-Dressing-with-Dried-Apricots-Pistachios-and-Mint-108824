I used pine nuts as I could not find pistachio nuts. I also used dried cranberries. Really enjoyed this dressing.

Very interesting taste combination. I chopped the pistachios which might have diliuted their presentation. Will definitely make again but will leave the nuts whole or coursely chopped.

This was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving '03 -- ate it ALL! Use pomegranates instead of cranberries -- much better taste overall, I think, and worth the prep of the fruit for sure. I'll be making this again a LOT.

Oh my goodness, this was delicious! I baked some of the dressing on the side as directed, but I also used some to stuff Cornish game hens, which was really phenomenal. I used extra chicken broth as I like my stuffing a bit "moist" and it still crisped up nicely on top. I used dried currants instead of the pomegranates or dried cranberries. The lemon zest provides a great counterpoint to the sweet flavors. Also, I chopped the pistachios before adding.

Very good! I made it almost exactly as written. I used the dried cranberries instead of the pomengranate seeds as i didn't want to deal with cleaning the fruit. Also used more stock than indicated and made sure the bread was really moist before it went in the oven. My family LOVED this. ALL of them, which is no easy feat. We'll be making this again in the future for sure...

It was good, but a bit dry, and the pomegranate seeds aren't as good cooked as they are raw.

It was a pleasant change of pace from traditional stuffing and everyone enjoyed it at our Thanksgiving meal. We used herbed stuffing mix instead of the bread cubes. The dresing was a little dry and so next time we will use about 2+ cups of chicken broth to make it moister.

It was good, but not worth repeating. Very interesting and a nice go-with for the goose. It smelled heavenly when it was baking!
